    "## Predicting literary success through writing style\n",
    "\n",
    "Publishers and acquisition editors have a history of fancying themselves stylemakers, going with the gut, chasing a feeling when choosing what to publish. And as a result, publishers have followed the business model of operating in the red, while crossing fingers for another Dan Brown or E.L. James to pull them into the black with a runaway hit. When presented with the idea of doing market research or digging into the data, I've heard publishers dig in their heels and repeat the argument that success in the arts is unpredictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the big publishing house market shrinks and new streamlined self-publishing competitors enter the field, this business model is proving increasing less viable. And in this shifting landscapehe big houses are finally beginning to turn to data. Which presents the question, can the success of a novel be predicted?\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, many variables of success are out of predictive bounds -- storyline novelty, fame of the author, social trends, world events. Here, we will focus soley on the structure of the writing style and whether stylistic structure can be used to predict success.\n",
