0,0,"   She got of the plane and the wall of damp weight that is Texas in August enveloped her, pulled at her like an impatient, weighty child.  Made her want to lie down.  She had only been gone for two years, but this feeling was a misery intentionally forgotten.  She felt weighed down by her luggage, by her disappointment at returning home.  She had never intended to return home, to the US, much less Texas.     Since she was a little girl, she had dreamed to moving to France.  In hindsight she was far too young to be dreaming of escaping to foreign lands.  She would be Madeleine, she would be College Girl Abroad, she would be that girl from that Tango movie without the dairy.  She was going to live a sophisticated, cultured life filled with ballet and art, everything that was the opposite of her small west Texas town.  And she would never return.    Her high school boyfriend had laughed at her.  People from where they were from stayed where they were from.  It was the way of it, the rules of the land.  She knew by that first sideways smirk from him that he was not the one for her.  She knew after she met Josie that he really wasnt the one for her.    She had applied for the graduate program in Nice not expecting to be accepted.  Shed let her language skills slip.  They would know that people where she was from didnt go France, didnt go to graduate school.  They didnt even wear necklaces.  This drew attention to ones cleavage and the lord did not care for that.  There were many rules about what one was to do and not do in her home town.  But the admissions board seemed not to know them.  They called within a few weeks to welcome her into a new life.    Flooded with ambition, she had planned it all.  Go early.  Go to language school.  Perhaps train over to Barcelona and go to language school there as well.  A girl could learn both French and Spanish in a couple of months, right? And then she would study.  She would take the exams that certified her in French for business, she would open that <business here>, she would fall in love, and she would never, ever return to the States.  The States that were so archaic.  Where football was religion and religion was politics and politics was circus.  Where reality television replaced conversation.  And southern smiles masked judgement and disapproval.    In hindsight, her expectations may have been slightly unreasonable.    --   She took a cab to her sisters house.  She had sold her car and furniture and almost all of her belongings.  She had planned on replacing her american effects with new inherently improved european versions.  And so there she was, she thought.  Moving home, moving in with her sister -- her sister who had 3 kids and 3 cats  -- with just a couple of suitcases and some stamps in her passport.  She exhaled as she watched the flat, desert landscape slide by.  It was ugly and beautiful in its barren dry vastness.  The land emanated death, but the sky was enormous, full of hope and possibility.  The sky was what got you through when you lived here.  It saved you every day.  The cab driver was talking incessantly.  About what, she couldnt follow.  His wife? Her birthday party? Something.  It didnt matter.  He didnt seem to require her participation.  Texas.  She stared out at her and she stared back in that fierce, unyielding way she remembered.    He dropped her off in the suburban driveway littered with toys and balls and various other brightly colored plastic things.  She stood there unable to move toward the door.  The bedroom was waiting for her  -- that bedroom  -- the one she had dubbed the loser sibling room years before after her sisters brother in laws rotated one after another just crashing for a few days, bro.  And now.  Now she was crashing for a few days, until she found a job, until she found an apartment, until she found a new purpose, goals, dreams.    The front door opened, through which escaped an excited new puppy, and she barely managed to keep herself from fleeing back after the cab.     --   The day her resolve broke consisted of a series of nothings.  But there were just enough nothings that she couldnt keep up her good Texas girl everythings fine attitude.  The university canceled the language classes they had promised were part of the program  -- annoying.  The train workers were striking again and only one train was running in the morning and one in the evening for all the commuters along the cote dazur  -- frustrating, also exceptionally smelly.  And then while she was leaving the station, walking home, trying to shake of the lingering feeling of being cramped in an over stuffed train car while a white haired businessman pretended he had no other place to put his hand in such a crowded place, she stepped into the crosswalk.  She saw the cab inching forward.  She saw the cab driver see her, and she saw him make the decision to hit her.  She toppled onto the hood so that she was looking directly into the drivers expressionless face.  As she scrambled back onto her feet, he continued to look at her blankly and drove away.  Baffled by this, she shakily walked home trying to dissect the drivers thoughts, his bullshit behavior, and, for the first time after a year of successful sidewalk landmine navigation, she stepped in dog shit.  And not just an errant pile, but her most hated kind, the kind where the dog owner had taken the time to wipe her dogs hindquarters with paper and then stuck it in the top of the pile afterward.  Insult to ruined shoes; ego bruise to assaulted nostrils.  After a year of brave facing it, it was this pile of dog excrement that changed everything for her.     --    As she unpacked, niece number 3 sat on her bed and in her suitcase and on her leg asking questions.   Did you like France? Can you say my name in French? Did you get that shirt in France? You were gone too long.  How long are you staying? What did your room look like in France? Can I sleep in here with you? Your hairs too long.  Can we go swimming?   Technically, they werent all questions, but they all required some sort of response or side step and were equally exhausting.  But in the good way, she supposed.  She was embarrassed to admit that she had missed familiarity and ease, and yes, even (especially) little girl consta-chattering.  And at that thought, she let go of her back-in-Texas malaise and tackled niece number three into the cartoonishly large suitcase and threatened to zip her in to the protest of uncontrolled shrieking and heart-happy laughter.     --   The degree was an accelerated approach consisting of two classes per cycle, five hours a day each.  Classes were hard and the group work required after the long day made for tired, cranky students.  But they were in the battle together and she was enjoying the camaraderie via massive stress that they had all developed.  It was the second cycle in the program.  Advanced <thing here> design.  The professor was brutal, and toward her it seemed even more so.  He made aggressively abrasive comments about Americans regularly, so she assumed her homeland was working against her.  She didnt take it personally.  She knew the reputation had been well-earned over the past few years, and being from Texas with the current cartoon cowboy in office was not helping her win over euro hearts and minds.     He picked on her.  He made her take responsibility for her country, and like a good American feminist she fought back.  The constant bruising had caused a bit of patriotism to spring in her, and she hated him for it.  This was not why she was here.     After the first test he scheduled office hours to talk about it.  She walked in, steeling herself in preparation for the harsh verbal tidal wave that was surely to come, and sat in the chair facing him.  And it began.  He told her that she was a disappointment.  That her grades should be better, they should be perfect.  That she was American and she had to set an example for the other students.  And what was this? Average effort when she should be the best.  She was lazy.  She was spoiled.  She was arrogant.  American schools had made her this way.  She expected her grades to be handed to her.  She did not know the meaning of hard work.  She was from the land of advantage, and anything less than perfect was unacceptable.  He was ashamed for her.  She would be nothing with work ethic like this.  <this is crap.  total and complete crap>    She was shocked.  His words  didnt entirely make sense.  She had done okay on the test.  She participated in his class, even when he made it intimidating to do so.  She was one of the top students.  And then Professor Doom softened and told her that he knew what pressure she was under, that his class was hard and that she was unaccustomed to the rigors of a respected european institution.  He would help her.  He walked around the desk and sat next to her.  He had just the plan for how to help.     --   She threw on her favorite jeans with the hole breaking through in the ass with a t shirt and flip flops and headed to the backyard.  Her sister was bbqing in proper welcome home fashion.  She hadnt gotten five steps in before a hamburger was pushed into one hand and a beer into the other.  Home.  Was this home? This wasnt supposed to be her home.  For decades the plan was dreamed, dollars were saved, and verbs were conjugated.   She started to cry and blamed it on the smoke from the grill.  The kids, who are always good for a diversion, unknowingly played their parts well.  But her sister saw it in her.  She always did and she always knew.  Tonight she would break her 30 minutes of TV rule and plop the girls down in front of the latest feature length animated kid zombifier.  She would shed the no nonsense PTA persona that she bewilderingly acquired after college.  She would open two more beers and she would listen and she would hug and she would understand.  And she would feel like home.      --   She sat on the floor of her new apartment surrounded by an array of boards and planks and washers and screws and things that looked like screws but didnt screw they just pushed and then another thing turned and then suddenly everything was locked in place with the sturdiness of steel.  The piece of paper in her lap offered mild assistance but she suspected it was mostly mocking her  -- making her follow absurd dance steps that were somewhere somehow being recorded by a clearly sadistic furniture maker.  Was this table really worth it? Eating and working on the floor didnt seem so bad, she thought as she rubbed her sore back and tweaked knee.    She was thankful at least to have something into which she could obsessively pour her attention.  She had a date tonight.  A date.  She had a date.  She kept saying this in her head.  And occasionally out loud to the table of evil despite that fact that it had little to say on the subject other than occasionally stomping on her toe.  This would be her first date since Sabine.  And how long had that been? Months? Time had been slipping away so quickly since shed been back in the States.  It was disturbing how looking for a job and going out for drinks could become an entire life.    She met Willa out at a bar one night.  They had actually met before but that was before Willa was out.  They had been at the same parties and had some friends in common.  It was hard not to in this town.  In the past Willa had seemed smaller, unhappy, uncertain  -- she always looked like she was hiding behind her clothes, her hair, whatever larger thing she could find to stand next to, melt into.  And then she heard that Willa made a grand announcement to all the world, granted this world couldnt have been less surprised, but still, thats always a good day.  And that first night she saw her out after said grand announcement, the transformation was shocking.  Happiness looks good on people, but for Willa it had caused a makeover worthy of a Hollywood makeover special.  The new haircut and wardrobe were merely details.  It was the standing tall, shoulders back, face to the world, voice strong.  It was amazing to see a girl come into her herself.    She had casually mentioned to a friend that Willa looked great.  This friend of course mentioned this to Willa within hours.  And Willa being a modern girl had in turn proceeded to connect with her over all available sources of social media and then asked her to dinner.    Having her life in disarray and Sabine in the back of her mind  and the front and essentially the full circumference, volume, and surface area of her mind, her gut wanted to say no, to say not yet, to say anything to skirt the issue and skirt her issues.  But she had promised herself that for the next year she would always say yes, only say yes, to every and all things.  And so she said yes.  And then she did the usual things of thinking about which night to go, which jeans to wear, all while all these new inlets of social media were dripping little facts, little phrases, little images of this girl to her.  And she was growing to hate her.    Heading to the best sushi restaurant in town, she tried to tell herself that Sabine was the reason for her anxiety and negativity going in, but she knew the truth was that it was the tweet about the whore who dropped the gum she stepped in whereby ruining her entire day  -- nay, entire life.  She exhaled and forced a smile.  It would be fine.  Some people are not great with public expression.  Some people are at their best and completely charming over a dinner table with a glass of wine and yellowtail jalapeno roll in hand.  This would be that instance.  Yes.     Willa looked amazing.  Her smile was bright and open, and she relaxed.  She could do this.  Yes, she could do this.  Dinner went smashingly.  Great food, a great glass of wine, and the conversation flowed like they were old friends.  They traced the lines of their connections, they knew the same people, they both loved that one bar, running at the lake is the best, right? She lost herself in the initial ease of the night and finally unclenched her non chopstick holding hand.  And then the second glass of wine arrived.     Alcohol is a fascinating thing, she thought.  The great social lubricant that puts you at ease, relaxes you, loosens your tongue.   Given her tendency toward shyness, wine was a gift.  But for some, there are levels of ease and loosen tongue that should never be reached.  It began with the waiter.  He had been attentive, friendly, and on his waiterly game all night.  And Willa, three sips into said glass of destruction, began to boss him around and be dismissive.  Bring me this.   Take this now.   I want.   Give me.   I said I wanted that.   Dont you think its been too long? Dont you think it should be here by now?   Gross was her exact thought.  No --yes.  I am doing this because I said I would.  Yes.  The stories had turned un first date ish.  Her mother, her fucking mother.  Her ex boyfriend who let her sleep with women.  Who she was still kind of seeing (wait --what?) Her mother again.  It was clearly time to leave.  She really liked this restaurant and she really wanted to be able to come back.  With promises of more drinks at the new girl bar in town that she in no way intended to keep, she finally got Willa up and moving toward the door.  She could not believe that this was what two drinks looked like on anyone.  How did this happen exactly? It was okay, this was all part of the Yes Project.  There were going to be these nights.  Walking to the door she heard a noise and the vibe of the room changed from din to concerned murmur.  She spun around to find Willa face down.  Apparently the seam where a rug met the hardwood floor had taken her down.  That rug knows what its doing, she thought.  Note to self: doormats have spent years crafting a reputation only to be secreting a sinister side underneath.  She couldnt help smiling.  The evening was heading in a karmic direction.    Given that the evening was heading in a karmic direction, she should have been keeping her thoughts in a more karmic friendly place.  She understood that now.    She knew Willa shouldnt drive, and as she thought longingly of the taxis and subways of the city, she poured Willa into the passenger side of her car.  The change of venue seemed to reenergize Willa into a manic party girl.  She sighed as she walked around the back of the car.  She stopped to gather herself for a moment and think over her options.  This evening is on an undivertable path toward being a complete shitshow.  I havent been invited to one of those in a while.  I can either feign sushi sick or I can buy a ticket.  Whats it going to be, self?   She climbed in, started the car, and looked at Willa.  They really named that new bar Lips? Seriously.  Eventually we are going to give up on subtly entirely and just go with Vag Bar.    As it was only eight oclock by this one sided wasted point in the evening, the bar was empty.  She always enjoyed that.  It may not be the most fashionable hour, but hanging with the bartender was usually entertaining.  Last month in San Francisco a bartender told her shed just quit her job because her boss had said something crass to her in a meeting about on which of her body parts she should sit and in facing which direction.  The girls sister had made a t shirt out of it.  There were pictures.  And this bartender promised to live up similarly.    They sat with her in empty bar, listening to her tell her coming out story.  She hadnt known she was gay until she was seventeen and slept with her aunts girlfriend.  And now she had an arm full of rainbow colored tattoos.  Willa had transformed into a drunken party beast by the end of the story attached to the fourth piece of body art.     Every detail about her carried its own Im the drunk girl banner.  She stood/braced herself against the bar, in what was clearly a well practiced pose  --  breasts high, hip jutted out, hand aperch it.   Her lips and teeth dyed a shade of seemingly permanent burgundy.  And these merlot lips were pursed in premeditated sexypoutylip face.  It was amazing in a high entertainment sort of way.  She wanted to watch Willa like a summer blockbuster all night long.  She knew she would have to deal with the fallout in a few hours, but in the meantime she pushed that out of her head knowing so many fantastic horrors were about to unfold.    Willa began to get loud and repeat talk.  This is my date.  Isnt she pretty? She looks like gay barbie.  Im on a date with gay barbie.  Isnt she hot? The couple who had just entered the bar were highly amused and <indulged> her for a while.  Yes, her date was hot.  Yes, she looked like gay barbie.  Through sidelong looks, they assured her that she did not in fact look like gay barbie.  During this  she had asked the bartender to start giving Willa club sodas with lime and forgo the vodka.  Despite this brilliant plan of barroom subterfuge, Willa seemed to keep getting more and more drunk with each hydrating beverage she threw down.  Willas audience had fled to safety and silence and thus she was getting the full blast of Willas drunken attention/affection/stand up routine.     Im going home with you and youre taking me now.  And she promptly left the bar and began walking to her apartment.  How did she know where I live? It doesnt matter as she has my bag.  She heftily overtipped the nice auntie shagging bartender and trotted out after Willa, mostly fearing she would find her topless and singing in the middle of the street.     This girl was in her home.  And that was okay.  That was probably going to be okay.  She was rifling through her empty cabinets looking for wine to drink while they watched a movie.  She knew that Willa wanted to watch a movie but she anticipated a pass out coming any second now.  So she clicked through movie options waiting for the next  in her evening to reveal itself.  And no sooner had she thought that than she heard Willa on the phone.  With her mother.  This girl had called her mother on a first date.     20 minutes later Willa clicked off the phone and said, That was my mom.  Shes so sad.  Shes so fucking sad.  She expects so much from me.  I cant fix everything.  I cant fix everyone in my life.  Its why I became a therapist but I cant do it.  Shes so fucking sad.  As the heave crying started to set in so did the mix of wine and vodka and she fled to the bathroom and began to vomit.  Wine infused sushi.  Everywhere.  She left the  in the bathroom to retrieve towels from the kitchen.  When she returned, Will was sitting on the toilet already talking to her and wrapping things up.     Good God.  Really -- was all she could think before Willa flushed the toilet and came at her with bedroom eyes.  She immediately took her into the guest bedroom and tried to tuck her in but Willa was not having it.  She bent over the bed as she was turning down the sheets and looked over her shoulder.  The pursing had returned.     What do you think of my body? Do you think Im sexy.  I think youre sexy.  Willa asked.  And at that moment, she realized that sleeping with this girl was going to be much, much easier than trying to get her to understand the word no.  So  Yes?    .    She sat on the balcony staring at a book.  She had been staring at the same page blanky for 30 minutes, reviewing the night before in her head over and over again.  Weirdest sex ever.  Did all of that really happen.     They had tumbled into a tangle of spazzy maneuvers ending in what appeared to be Willa having a seizure which was confusing as that couldnt have resulted from anything she was doing at the time.  But this was not the time to question such things.  Willa immediate curled into her arm and began her post orgasm pillow talk.  That was amazing.  That was so great.  Didnt you think it was great? How many people have you done that to before me? I bet youve done that to everyone.  Are you just using me? Are you just using me for my body? Look at me.  My body is all I have.  When I lose it what will I have? No one will love me.  Will you love me when I lose my looks? Ill be so good to you.  Ill be better to you than anyone else.  I admire you so much.  Youre so out there.  Live my dreams.  Live the life I wanted.  The life Im too afraid to live.    And on.  And on.  And bafflingly on.  And so much crying.  She did the only thing she could.  She held her in close and pretended to be asleep.    And now here she was, up since 6:30, completely freaked out in the other room, willing Willa to wake up and get out.  She decided to make the noisiest breakfast ever.  This failed and so option two was lying.  You have to get up.  I need to go.  Im keeping my sisters kids today.  If this didnt work, she was not above faking  --- something? What gets a girl out of your house? Friend emergency? Work emergency? Heart failure? Something.    Willa finally padded out naked and looking pleased with herself.  That was sexy last night.  Didnt you think? I thought it was so hot and sexy.  Oh, and sorry about the crying.    Yeah, there was a lot of crying.  A lot.    Yep.  Sorry about that.  Willa chirped lightly while she was digging in her bag and pulling out a little sectioned box.  This one is for my anxiety.  And this one is for my ADD.  And this one is for depression.  And this one is a multi vitamin!   Anyway, last night was super fun.  My ex bf never let me drink more than 2 drinks, so I loved that we got to be wild.    Do you think maybe alcohol reacts badly with your medication? Because there was a lot of crying.    Huh.  Ive never thought about that.  Maybe! So when are we going to your sisters house?        She was walking down the Promenade des Anglais gazing out over the pebble beach at the impossibly blue water.  They called it a pebble beach, but these were not pebbles.  They were fist-sized rocks, small boulders, uncomfortable to lie on without a mattress under you, but it was pretty in its smooth, grey, ankle-twisting way.   She loved to sit and stare out at the horizon for as long as the day would let her.  She still couldnt believe she was really there, working, studying, living just a few blocks from the Cte d'Azur.  She had dreamed of this for so many years and here were her dreams before her waiting to be lived.  She took it in every day, grateful and full of life wonder.    Shed been sitting on the same bench every afternoon that week.  Shed been in Nice about 3 weeks, just trying to settle into a real life.  Shed conquered the mundane aspects of expatriation and they had turned out to be exceptionally entertaining.  A bank account was granted to her by a banker who oddly seemed to only know phrases involving horses.  Texas! You ride horse, yes? Tout le monde au Texas ride horse, oui? Oui, je ride horses.  (She did not ride horses, but who was she to deny this man his stereotype joy. ) Her cell, her mobeel as it would be called for the next stretch, was acquired by means of some sort of improv act where the stores six employees seemed to know only a few English words each, so through teamwork she managed to sign up for what she was sure was complete rip off of a plan.  She ended these days feeling triumphant over the small feats and utterly language deficient.  Her fluency at describing the weather or the size and color of household objects was not terribly helpful at the student visa administration office or at bars for that matter.  But as she sat on her bench staring at her ocean, she knew that these things would come.  She was certain.  She was taking classes in town and the university had promised daily classes during the program.  Her dreams of casually discussing the book shed just read or of giving directions to a stranger on the street in French were on their way.    It was after one of these city French classes that she was on her bench reviewing how her future progressive tense needed to improve if she was ever going to ramble on about her life dreams and how everything that Armenian girl in her class said was really racist.  She felt guilty for being jealous of her fluency.  She wanted to be fluent enough to be offensive.  Or funny.  But, she thought, you probably offend for quite sometime without meaning to, then you learn how to swear, then perhaps you can become funny.  And it was during this not quite logical thought chain that a girl sat down next to her.    Bonjour, tu es Americaine, non? My name is Sabine.  I want to meet you.    This sentence.  She would remember this sentence forever.  Sabine worked in a shop across the promenade and had been watching her bench-based gazing sessions.  She had thought she was a crazy person the first week she noticed her and then the second, decided she must be a romantic  -- a poet, a painter, deep in inspired contemplation.  And so she sat down to ask.  In hindsight, she saw that Sabine wanted to eclipse that view, to become a part of the verse, to be captured on canvas.  And if ever there were inspiration for such a thing. . .    Sabine had dark eyes that looked expertly lined when they were bare.  Her face was open and soulful, with a mouth that rested in a softly down turned pout that protruded in that overly muscled way that english speech doesnt develop.  It was easy to feel entranced by her european style of dress, of mannerism, of attitude.  She didnt understand why Sabine was there and immediately didnt want her to leave.    They walked down to outdoor Chagall exhibit, debating the merits of shine and tile and art and beholders.  They were standing in front of an exceptionally rotund figure that was embracing? dancing? wrestling? with another of equal magnitude, when Sabine turned to her, placed a hand on her face, and pulled her in by the waist with the other.  I wanted to know what it was like, she said.  I heard Americans lack passion.  But you burn of need and want and more.  You are French on the inside.    She stood dazed, feeling disoriented by the <something something> of this girl reflected so many times over in the mirrored tile of the sculpture.  She looked into those eyes and something broke.  and wordlessly she grabbed her by the scarf pulling her back into a kiss of magnitude to dwarf the figures behind.     They tumbled into her apartment tipping an unwatered plant and knocking coats off hooks, they found a chair.  Sabine pushed her into it, straddled her, and started to peel off her clothes all without lifting her mouth off hers.  She slid her hands around and under Sabine pulling her down onto her as hard as she could, her mind blank, her focus was nothing but this, here, now, Sabine.  She lifted her up and pushed her into the bedroom, onto her bed, under her, on top of her.  She couldnt get close enough.    They lay in a tangle silently watching the sun dim through the shuttered window and the shadows overtake the room and all memories of life before this moment.         Country music had made a hipster-led comeback in Austin.  It wasnt the good timing man, good hearted woman country culture of days past but more of a whiskey drinking, mustache sporting kitsch culture of the generation for which emotional sincerity was a relic.  The revival of pearl snaps and pearl beer provided a front of assumed irony for those who had kicked it country in the privacy of their homes and hearts.  Now the handlebar moustaches had brought it into the neon light for closet cases and fad followers alike.  She wasnt complaining.  A good country song pulled at your heart and made you rethink your life choices like no pop diva or shoe-gazer ever could.  She finally didnt hate a trend.    A new country dive bar opened on the east side of town.  Ignoring the fact that bars now opened with dive status, she was looking forward to Two Stepping Tuesday at the <Black Heart Saloon. > The hours she spent online learning to dance in her apartment with an invisible partner were finally going to be test driven, and most likely provide a few belt buckle gripping belly laughs for others.   She didnt care.  Armored up in her tightest jeans, new, embarrassingly unbroken in boots and a slub t shirt, she sauntered in to meet her girls.  Because in a country bar one saunters -- unless you are moseying of course.     The bar was sporting a standard alt country crowd  -- mostly cool kids, a few old rednecks who wore their moustaches with entirely different intention and could show a youtube-trained girl up on the dance floor, and also a few girls in weather inappropriate dresses and shoes of questionable structural integrity.  Because those girls are in every bar.  Always.  The laws of the bar universe decree it.  The bar smelled of wood and whiskey as every bar should, but also with a hint of old man tobacco.  She smiled.    Bellied up to the bar with her best friend, beer in hand and sobriety-maintained self-consciousness left at the bottom of her glass, she was ready.  She handed Jona her drink and her dignity to hold and took in the bar.  There was a dance partner in this room that was going to push her around this dance floor, be wowed by her boot scooting prowess, be incredulous that this was her first time in the circling sea of cowboys.  Which one was he.     It did not look promising.  Most of the southern tinged hipster boys were holding up the walls, deep in conversation of varying depths.  Most of the girls had gaggled and were pushing the limits on their ability to remain upright without swaying.  No good there.  Old rednecks, she knew they were the objects of her dancing desires.  Where was her fifty five year old salt and pepper, good mannered gentleman with wranglers that had weathered decades of real Texas life? He would make her boots sing.     Where was he? Was it too late? Had she missed her chance while <ratcheting> up her confidence to level beer three, also known as level <Im a good dancer>?    And then the unexpected happened.  She saw him  -- the person she had overlooked: country frat boy.  And he saw her.  And it was as if she had written this moment in the farce of her happiest imagination.  He raised his arm above his head and began to flawlessly execute the invisible lasso move, followed by the invisible roping of the girl, followed by the invisible hand over hand pulling himself in and toward her.  And then to her greatest joy he said these magic words: Is it hot in here or is it just you?   Yes he did.    And because the universe was for that moment <on her side in every way>, the band went on break and Dolly Parton flooded the sound system to fill the <void>.    Whyd you come in here looking like ---  before she could finish that thought, she had leaned into him and onto the floor.    ---and your painted on jeans.  He was talking.  Talking a lot.  But she couldnt hear him.  She was two stepping with a real, live partner.  She was wearing her new boots and stepping quick quick ---slow ---slow, quick quick ---slow ---slow.   ---like a cowgirls dream.  She was suddenly thinking this song was too fast.  She was shuffling.  He was swaying.  How drunk was this boy? But she was dancing! She was in Texas, being Texan, and two stepping.  Whoa.  I got you.  She had him.  She was dancing.  Sort of.  They were kind of dancerunshuffling.  She was still counting it.   ---He's got a wanderin' eye and a travelin' mind  There were a lot of people on the floor.  That they were narrowly missing.  Big ideas and a little behind She burst into laughter at her favorite line and beers and the look of <something something> on this poor boys face.  And just as Dolly was about to re ask her indignant question, he stumbled and they went down  -- him clawing at and taking her down with him.  <fix> <more> He immediately filled with embarrassment and panic, his frat boy pride damaged, his ladies man game bruised.  To his credit, he asked her if she was okay like a good gentleboy, but this was quickly followed by a near sprint out the front door.     And she layed in the middle of the floor uncontrollably laughing while the sea continued to swirl and Dolly was almost given a heart attack.         I sat on the couch across from her.     I had fled New York when I found out Donna was cheating again.  I had gotten on the next flight to Austin and melted down at my best friends house for days.  I had flown back the night before and stayed at an overly coiffed hotel whose every corner smelled of lemongrass.  I had ordered room service, taken multi-jetted showers which ensured that I too smelled of lemongrass, and then I watched a romantic comedy to remind myself through trite oversimplification that people could find love and happiness if they made the tough decision to break away now and then stood in line at a coffee shop shortly thereafter.      Early the next morning I walked into my apartment where she was sleeping and sat on the couch staring at the wall while her dog near-seizured with ironic joy at my reappearance.  The frantic scuttle of paws on the hardwood roused her, and then we sat  -- she in her pajamas, me smelling of lemongrass.    She began.  She had missed me.  She didnt think I was coming back.  She had freaked out not knowing what to do.  I sat very calmly, listening to the outpour of sadness, remorse, love from this tiny, beautiful girl that had been my life for the past three and a half years.  She had been my Donna Disaster.  What was an affectionate party girl bar name to her friends had a different meaning to me.  The flip side to the super! fun! out! every! night!, dance on bar tops girl that everyone loved  -- and everyone loved  -- was a darkness and lack of consequence awareness that I will never quite wrap my overly analytical mind around.  The fear of being alone for even a moment, the need of all of everyones attention, the ability to morph into the perfect <object of whomevers fantasy> at only a moments read on them, and the lying.  The lying was her greatest skill.  It was flawless and committed and virtually undetectable.  No one could lie like Donna.  She made it a sport, an art.  Television show characters dedicated to the practice would have studied her, taught her methods to students, been awed by her.    I sat on the couch across from her.  I watched her mouth form these amazing words.  I stared at her lips trying to absorb how they could be moving as they were, forming the shapes they formed.  How her eyes could hold such sadness and contrition.  My brain and heart were numb and the room around her blurred just slightly under the focus on those lips that were spewing the cruel insult of continued untruth, lips on which mine had spent so many nights, aching for a closeness that was impossible to attain.     She had brought her work computer home.  And I had read her email.  It was something I thought only the worst of characters did in movies.  I still do.  I was at my worst at the time, my most confused and anxious without really knowing why.  My stomach told me my world was atilt, but my brain couldnt find the source.  And so I opened it and I read.    Watching the end of my relationship, all of my life plans unravel before me on the screen, I felt dazed.  I felt my capacity for emotion slip from my ribcage and pool around my feet.  I suddenly understood the depth of how effortlessly and resolutely she could lie.  She hadnt cheated; she had another relationship.  She had an entire second life.  I saw the timeline.  I saw that when she wasnt cheating she abandoned our sex life.  During periods of trysts in barroom bathrooms and in lower east side nooks under the pretense of walking the dog, she wanted to have sex with me twice a day.  I logged in from my place afar in sequestration.  Now that she knew that I knew, I watched her make plans over those three days to transition from me being her public girlfriend to her being her public girlfriend.  Who would the shadow girlfriend be next.     I sat across from her.  I watched her craft her story  -- the one that would display her in the most flattering light, the one that would make me feel sympathy for her.  But I knew, my ill behavior had shown me the designs that she secreted.  I knew when she told me that she couldnt live without me that shed been sleeping with her every night that Id been gone.  I knew that when she said she couldnt imagine not being married to me, that she didnt know what was wrong with her, and that she was starting therapy to fix herself -- that she would be back on my doorstep when she did to win me back, propose to me, fulfill her promises and our plans  -- that she was about to walk out my door and and move in with her that very afternoon.    Seeing duplicity and absence of empathy of this depth in another person changes you.  It shakes your sense of fairness, your belief that good guys will win in the end, and bad guys always get their proper serving of karma.  But there is no karma.  And you know this.  And it changes you.    My eternal childlike clinging to the existence of honest people was shaken.  Not because she was the one for me.  If I am honest, I was relieved to be free of her.  She was unendingly needful  -- she needed attention and fixing and obsessive love <and your conquered soul>.  And even the most dedicated caretakers can be broken.  I did not miss her.  I never wished for her back.  This did not do the shaking.  My sense of humanity  -- of humans treating each other carefully, with respect and honesty.  This has been battered <more here>.    Discussions about infidelity bring out unexpected things in your friends and family.  You can see immediately who feels <guilty> and defensive at the sight of your pain, in the presence of something that is so clearly wrong, that has such visible fallout because they cannot imagine that they are like her.  People debate situational nuance and justifiable transgression.  They stiffen and retreat inwardly, and spout words that are not their own.    Im better at spotting it now, the overly detailed stories, the <something something> in eye contact.  But even if I had had this knowledge and had honed these skills, I never would have seen it.  She was exceptional.  And about this she was always honest.         She was watching the woman over her reader on the subway and thinking, Thats the hair of an emotionally healthy person.  Her bun was pulled high and tight leaving her not a strand with which to fidget, twirl, or hide behind.  It was the antithesis of the emo hair of trends past.  She was all face, all her.  She emits confidence and bravery, she thought.  I want to be brave, to sport the crown top hair ball of bravery.  And that's when she realized that she'd been staring down this woman for far too long, and she realized that the woman had also realized this.  Her undisguised brow beginning to furrow as she pushed further behind the shield of woman juggling three kids and guy rapping out loud in headphones.    In an attempt at clever deception, she held strong while flicking only her eyes over the womans shoulder to where shed of course been staring all along.  She knew the woman wouldnt buy it, but she was committed to her lazy rouse at that point.  Cringing on the inside at not just owning up with a sheepish, Ohsorry.  Spacing out.  Mondays.  and as she had this thought she realized she was verging on doing it again.    A together but casually dressed man was in her new line of stare, and he was smiling at her  on the subway.  That never happened.    Suppressing the punchy laughter about being the crazy on the train rising within, she smiled back.  Openly.  A Texas trained smile on the subway.  She never did that.    When the car emptied 3% more at the next stop, he weaved and bent and excuse med over to her with a smile of <friendly, non crazy train guy proportions  -- delete>.  Hi.    That never happened.     She looked up into his bespeckled face.  She liked the word bespeckled and the openness of his smile, and she decided she would take part in this unprecedented urban experiment.  Why not.  She never did that.  Hi.    I couldnt stop myself from coming over to mock you for not abandoning that series during book two.  Book three was unreadable.  Book four was an insult to the use of words.  And youre reading the prequel? By then it was clear that he was just fucking with us.    Bespeckled guy on subway, also books.  That never happened.    You are very right, however, if you dont finish all the books despite their decline into unintelligible garbage, you lose good indignant ranting credibility and mocking material for your jokes in bookish circles and with girls on trains.    She said so many words in a row and they mostly made sense.  She never did that.    Hm.  You may be right.  I am starting to feel better <something something wasting time, subjecting  eyes> to those 2000 words of self righteous pontification.  This is my stop.  I was on my way to the gym and then home to watch a bad movie, but Id give all that up if you wanted to walk and talk about bad books instead.    She pushed a strand of hair out of her face and tucked it behind her ear and got of the train three stops early <with a novel spring in her step>.         Dinner was taking forever.  They had ordered an hour and a full bottle of wine ago.  But this was typical in this sunkissed, romantic vacation region of the country.  And she was happy sitting across from this wonder.  Sabine talked about art, about installations in the city, about the dreadful pseudo  of Nice that was so pale in comparison to her perfect sister city of light.  They spoke Frenglish to each other  -- she learning more than she could absorb, Sabine pretending that she had nothing to learn.  Her disbelieving mind kept wandering to a birds eye view of this perfect   -- her here in this place, with this beautiful girl, speaking French, becoming French.    Sabine was an artist, an art student occasionally, a shop girl full time.  <details here>   Sabine sat next to a person at a table, sitting across the table was gauchely impersonal, unintimate.  She held hands on the table, she touched faces, fixed hair strands out of place.  <fix> And she was enveloped in Sabines attention, her complete focus, and the soulquake effect of her touch.    She flagged down the waiter, a heroic feat, and inquired on the food.  Dix minutes, he said in that way that made it clear he had forgotten to put it in at all.  That was all she needed to hear.    Sabine was mid sentence about something to do with the urban mythologies exhibit at the MAMAC when she grabbed her by the hand and pulled her to the back of the cafe and into a back closet.  Pushing stacks of napkins and clothes out of the way, she slammed her against the shelves.  Frantic hands and mouths making quick work of the stolen space.  Sabine gasped gripping her hair with feral intensity, and then collapsed against the wall, unclenching her hair and pulling her into a kiss.  <more>   They floated back to the still plateless table, finishing the dregs of the wine and smiling at each other silently.  Sabine slipped out front to make a call.  She was stirred from her instant replay day dreaming by the arrival of the food.     Shed been so deep in happy, amorous thoughts that she hadnt realized she was still sitting alone at the table and the streets were quiet.         On the train, she smiled to see the girl next to her reading Swingers.  She didnt know that movie was based on a book.  She stole a peak at the opposite page hoping to glance a Youre so money or even just a bunny or a baby.  Apparently Vince Vaughn did not pen a great novel on which his break out role owes its thanks.  Also apparently, the phrase Richard slid into her anus will never ever leave her branded brain.          She liked her new job.  The pay was insulting but the people were smart and enjoyable types with whom to spend her daylight hours.  And it was a start --a re start.  She had been working, going out, drinking like a Texas girl again, not speaking French, not speaking of France, or dreams or the future.  She was here and she was being here with no thought determination.  Life was all fun and no fantasy, little feeling.  This was needed sometimes, yes?   She got a call from Jen.  She had been ceaseless in her harassment lately.  Friends were arriving for the weekend from the east coast.  One of them liked girls, therefore Jen was certain that fact alone was the recipe for eternal love.  She was not interested.  Her last round at romance was brutal.  Dating was a repulsive thought.  She especially did not want to be set up by Jen.  Jen was a bar friend.  She was single and fun at happy hour but loud, so very loud and lacking in  anything but being single and fun in a bar.    She had blown Jen off for a week.  Passivity was becoming her new Texas version of self trademark <fix>.  So it should have been properly foreseen when she responded with, A rodeo? Are you fucking kidding me? I am not going to a rodeo.  Fine, she said.  Fine.  Listen, Im just going to send you this girls profile.  Just for fun, no pressure.    She immediately heard the ding of her phone.  She clicked through, saw the first photo, and thought, Fuck.  I cannot fucking believe Im going to a fucking rodeo.    She was pretty.  Her pictures did not lie.   She saw me , she flushed, and then an intensity set in her smile.  I could see it in her eyes.  She was locked on her target for the evening.    They had a few rodeo champagnes  -- which until this night were known as cheap, watery beers  -- and did the standard bio swap.  She was a Texas girl who had moved to DC, but she stayed true to her country roots and could rock a pair of cowgirl boots and a short skirt in a way that showed urban flare around the edges.    They took a walk to take in the spectacle.  They seemed without a destination so she asked D where she wanted to go.  Im trying to find a place to make out with you.  That worked its charms.  And so within minutes they were making out at a picnic table in a tucked away clearing just down a hill from the main festivities.  In proper Texas style, they soon were chased off by stetson topped cowboys.  The found their way into a barn, and made out in a horse stall, narrowly escaping the angry urine torrent of the unamused horse before again being chased out and after by still more curious cowboys.  Next on to making out on the bleachers behind the barn where an IROC Z drove up, turning its lights on them before our pursuers once again found and chased them.  We just want to talk to you about what you were doing! They eventually fled their way back to the F 150 that was their chariot and finally their safe haven for the evening where they could fog up the windows in peace.  It was definitely a most bizarre and exhilarating night of comedy.  She wouldnt say romance. .    Dea was pretty.  She was happy.  She was full of energy and excitement for jumping heedlessly into trouble.  She was the perfect antidote to the heavy seriousness of her last relationship.  Definitely not my type, she thought  -- she was too wild, too much of a party girl, her tastes too pop, her interests non existent.  And there was something else, she couldnt identify.  But wow she was fun.  There was always a story, always a , always a hangover.  The perfect fling.  She told everyone it was going to be a very fun month, maybe two.      <come back here>        It was the day she learned a shit ton of things about herself, about how he perceived her, about who she is two years in.  She'd always thought that she was the good guy.  It made her sick to think that she might be the delusional one, the martyr, the one who tells lies to self and circle.    Its all in your head, he said.  You pick the details you want to remember and those you want to throw away.  The ones that fit the narrative that youve constructed about this relationship.  You think youre the victim and that I don't love you enough.  You think I don't put in effort but you gloss over the effort I put in when its not convenient to you and to your story.  You resent me.  You act like you hate me, and who I am.  Youre annoyed at me all the time.  You take shots at me.  So yeah, that knocks me down and maybe I do get distant.    She went numb.  Was this really who she was.  Shed been her father her entire life and suddenly she was her mother.  Or was it suddenly.  she hadnt talked much with Dea.  She was a landmine.  And with him, she had never talked, never felt safe enough to talk.  But what would have been worse  -- demand talking her way into a breakup a year ago or find out that she's become this person now and break up anyway, wasting time and happy moments along the way.    It was brutal to hear but worse to think that it was true.  He had made her feel so small along the way, like she was a disappointment, like she would never be half the girl that SHE was.  And she had internalized that.  She spent the first half of their relationship trying to prove him wrong, to show him how nice and giving and thoughtful and fun and perfect she could be.  And he didnt care about any of that.  And so this second part, she had given up, handed over the responsibility of effort and care to him and she had become Unhappy.  The big kind.  The kind that eclipses rational thought and perspective.  And yet she stayed because who wants to end a relationship with the other thinking that you are lame, uncool, difficult.  Past loves had never thought such heresies.  She was the good one.  They had loved her.  Some still did.  So what was it.  She just couldnt take it that this match brought out the shittiest in her, that she didn't shine.  She wanted to shine for him just once, so he would see it.  So he could see what her friends saw and loved.  And maybe then he wouldn't take this version of her, this description of her with him when they parted.     Or was this all bullshit.  She couldn't tell anymore.  and it was just with him, she couldn't sort through what was good and what was bad, what was real, and what was in her head.  what he said, what he thought, and what he told others.    He had told his friend that she was lame, frail, never fun, that he wanted to end things the next month, that he did not love her, he only loved his art and his love from a decade before. and now here he was telling her that he was surprised by this talk, that he thought things were fine, that she broke him down and was mean.  She wanted to fight him to tell him that his confidant had broken her word to him and clued her into his real thoughts.  But she didn't.  and now she didn't know how to balance what she had thought of him, what she had substantiated,  his words now which rung so true and made her hate herself and fear who she had turned into so far from the glossy self projection in her head.     --   I don't want to break each other down.  I don't want to pick and nit and crush and accuse and point.  I think we both feel similar.  That we're good.  But we're not quite right.  I'd rather us agree to that now and hug and be kindly sad then spend all night doing the and another thing I hate about you war dance.  I have loved you but we don't have enough love.  I want to be someones sara.  it's making me sad, this stagnation.  we're not working toward something bigger than us.  i feel like we're passing time and we're not on the same page about where that time should be heading.  I don't want to be sad or mad or hurt or lacking or annoying or annoyed anymore.  let's be a cliche instead.         Never give up and good luck will find you.         Sabine had disappeared from two parties, two restaurants, and oddly, one supermarket.  She didnt know what to do with this.  She asked her where and why and somehow Sabine eluded her direct questions with misdirection that somehow succeeded every time.  The somehow most often involved clothes being removed and knees becoming wobbly and a sudden complete lack of caring for words being said on any topic.    And then they would lie there in the softened afterglow and whisper about the wind and wonder about wonders.  They would walk, attached and entangled always.  Out for food or wine to take back into her bed.  But then she would be gone suddenly.  Sabine would ghost into the night or the mid morning, and silence would fill the next few days until her laughter and lips would fill her bedroom for another 30 hours.    She was sitting on her couch welcoming the solitary hours in which to catch up in her classes.  Sabine liked to win at the game of attention and school had been the distinct loser.  It was worth it, she thought.  No one would look at her grades ever again, but Sabine could last a lifetime.  Could she? Couldnt she?    A knock on her door told her that she should holster her papers now.  The knock familiar, the strength of the assertive, the unvarying rhythm.  And last time, her drawings had seen demise at the hands of impatient girls and a broken coffee table.  She walked to the door, checking herself in the glass of the framed <something>, anxious to see what todays adventure would hold.  She opened the door.  Sabine was there.  She had brought a friend.    Anais was petite, curvy, and covered in shades of grey.  Her clothing combined with dark skin and eyes made her look strong and knowing.     Bonjour, love, Sabine said as she wandered in and to the kitchen looking for the wine opener.    Anais continued to lurk in the doorway, taking in this new <arrival> location.  And she didnt say anything to her, her <indoctrined> Texas politeness and welcoming ways stayed put in the pit of her stomach.  She just watched her.    A few moments more of Anais lingering  appraisal passed before she broken into a small smile.  She walked in and closed the door herself, and then turned to face her.  With a Bonjour, amie nouvelle, Anais when in for what she thought was the standard southern France greeting kiss but before the slight shift registered, she had gone in for a proper kiss, a kiss of her people and pressed her up against the entryway wall.    She should have panicked.  She stood there thinking, I should be panicking.  But she didnt push her away.  And within seconds she felt another pair of hands on her waist and lips on her neck, and all thought coherent thoughts slipped out of her head just as her body was being slipped out of her dress.    This <affair> was always tricky business.  She had done this before but she had always been the focus.  She had spent a week one summer picking up college girls in bars with a friend, but he had just wanted to sleep with her.  On a more than one occasion the other girl had gotten up to get water mid tryst.  Despite this, he had nicknamed her Tiger because he said she ignored him and pounced on the girl.  Poor girls.  They were not interested in girls.  They loved him.  He was beautiful and had reaped the beautiful boy benefits.  She supposed she had reaped them as well.  Never had she opened up such things within a relationship.  This had the possibility of too many fallout what ifs.    But none of this crossed her mind now.  Two bodies were pressed against hers, still in the hallway.  This was the smart approach  -- all attention on the unexpecting.  She would think later  -- when she could think.  She had tugged at Anais clothing  -- they were loose and easily dismissible.  She was pressed up against her straddling her right leg, pressing into her, hand raking down her exposed back as she pulled in closer.  Sabine had returned from the kitchen with wine on her lips and with her dress left on the counter.  She had never found a need to play coy.  She was on her left balancing Anais pressure and intensity with kisses down her face and body, light stroking of of her skin.  Slowly and traced her neck, then down the center of her chest, circling her navel and hip bones, the small of her back.  She traced and teased.  The evening was to be a long one.             She woke in the late evening in the middle of both warm, exhausted bodies.  How long had they tumbled? Hours.  Many bed shaking, multi climactic hours.  Sabine breathed steadily curled in front of her, holding her arms solidly in their <proper> place under her neck and over her chest, how they always slept.  And Anais was behind her, lightly touching front to her back.  She realized why she had woken.  A hand was almost imperceptibly <stroking> her back.  Anais sensed she was awake now and that hand began to wander farther and with more pressure.  The game playing of earlier behind them, she gently pressed up behind her, leg <slipping> in between hers and hand slipping over her belly and down.    Sabine woke to the sound of her orgasm, smiling she kissed her on the cheek and got up to make coffee.      She was sitting at the latest east Austin brand new dive bar, surrounded by good haircuts and irrationally ill fitting clothing.  She hadnt seen Jae in years.  They had been inseparable best friends before she moved abroad.  They had worked at the same company after college, had terrorized said company with their hijinx, had had entirely more fun on company hours than business conduct handbooks  would ever allow, and they had always told each other everything.  They were each others primary counselors in matters of love and lust and ditching that bitch at the bar.    And then shed moved away for school in a place too far for him to visit.  Hed had girlfriends that she didnt know.  Things changed as things tend to do.  But now she was back and she was ready to hop back into their best friendship.    So, youve been dating this one for a while, yeah? Tell me everything.  Whats her story? Whats your story about her story?   He sighed.    Have you ever read the Maltese Falcon? So theres this guy.  And hes hired to find this other guy who just walked out of his office one day and disappeared.  Left his job, his wife, his kids  -- just disappeared.    Okaaaay.    So the detective finds the guy a few years later and asks the guy so whyd you do it? Whyd you leave? The guy had gone out for lunch and a beam had fallen from a construction site almost killing him.  So the guy realizes that life is fragile and fleeting and that he hates his life and so he just leaves it all behind.    I know this dream well.    Yeah.  Yeah.  So the detective asks the guy if hes happy.  Asks him what his life is like now.  And the guy says, Not particularly.  I essentially have the same job.  Im married to the same woman.  Ive got the same kids as I did before.    Youre telling me that you dont like your new girlfriend?   No.  I do.  I mean that in the best possible way.    How could that possibly be interpreted as positive, Jae?   I just mean that before you left I had just broken up with Bella and I was going to be this totally new and improved version of myself, you know? Remember? We started going to the gym.  We went skydiving.  We traded movie nights for hitting on girls in bars.  I was going to trade in my introvert hat for a some skinny jeans and a pilots license.    Those were fun times.    Of course they were.  And now I have a girlfriend again.  And I watch movies with her on the couch while wearing my hat.        Youre not saying anything.    I was just thinking that we need to go out and get drunk.  What do you say?   I dont mind a reasonable amount of trouble.              She walked down the street of her adopted neighborhood, musing on how differently she felt about it now than when she had first moved.  Months ago, she had been wondrous, excited even about living here.  She had viewed the ultra orthodox community with the arrogant enthusiasm of the culturally ignorant.  She saw this now.  Of course, it would be different at first, but come on, this is the most diverse city in the world  -- it will be completely normal aside from the dress code.  And furthermore, she could win over anyone with her toothy smile and determined friendliness.    She sighed as embarrassment roiled in her cheeks at the thought while she walked fifteen minutes farther to a less intimidating Korean owned grocery store.  The Satmar owned store in her building was too stressful.  Never before had acquiring kale been such an outing of anxiety and panic.  It was always packed with wig topped, gaggle toting women radiating fury at the audacity of jeans, of skin, of sin, of her.  The aisles felt like an impossibly narrow obstacle course, dangers wheeling in front of each egg carton and tortilla chip bag.  An accidental brush against a woman was insult, against a man was a violation of religious law and a lifetime of vows and practice.  To reinforce this, shopping carts were aimed in her direction with the intention of clearing a path bowling pin style.  Refusal to speak or ring her groceries by exceptionally orthodox cashiers (she had touched the apples, and thus he would not) flooded her with a confusing shame.  She was a good liberal, thus everyones practices were to be respected with the utmost reverence.  Why did this make her feel this way  -- the stress, the anxiety, the shame of her sex and secular existence.    She attempted to connect with the other employees in the store.  The owner had hired a handful of hispanic men to stock and shelve and occasionally work the cash registers.  But they spoke little english and her spanish was dreadful.  This grocery store was a showcase of her many cultural failures.    She had not adopted this neighborhood.  She had invaded it.  And she felt it with each hurried step that kept her darting out of the way of the hyperbolically avoidant behavior of the men and the aggressive glowers of the women and children.  She had never considered that there existed a gap she couldnt bridge.  Again, she felt shame.  She was an intruder.  She was unwanted.  She was the worst offender of the obtuse inflood.    She broke her fierce staring contest with her shoes and dared a sweep of the faces around her.  No hatred today  -- mostly stony gazes looking through her.  Then one man looked at her.  He looked her in the eyes and held it.  He looked at her like she was a person  -- a woman.  The way men elsewhere looked at her sometimes, with acknowledgment and open interest.  She was jarred and then she cursed for steeling herself against the humans around her as many had against her.  She then humbly resolved to reenergize her Rosetta Stone Spanish lessons, readjusted her scarf against the biting March winds, and hurried on to pay far too much for kale.              She and Sabine were browsing the  artists market along the promenade looking at trinkets and bits that ranged from tourist trash to heart filled pieces of personal craft.  They were bundled up and wrapped around each other to stay warm.  Coffees in hand, sleepy distracted eyes more on each other than the goods for sale, they rounded the corner and headed down the third aisle of artists booths.  And thats when she saw him, the professor from her most challenging class.  The one who seemed to take issue with americans, who called her out the most, but with whom she seemed to have a handle on battling back.  She enjoyed their contentious banter and always left that class feeling like she had made her points and defended her arguments.  And she thought he felt that way too.   It seemed as if he had seen her first.  His eyes were on her but broke away when she looked up.  And then he turned out of sight, away from the fair and down an alleyway that led toward the town center.  She shook off her uneasy feeling.  It seemed there was something odd in his demeanor.  But that would have nothing to do with her.  He probably hadnt seen her at all.    <He had seen her.  He had right? Thats why things had changed? She didnt want to be paranoid,>  but that class, that professor had change.  Their debates had gone from good natured, intellectual tete a tetes to harsh core battering assaults.  She was wrong.  She hadnt understood the material.  Her world view was naive, skewed, uninformed.  He had not found it amusing when she had pointed out that she was in school precisely to inform that world view.  He had not only found in unamusing, he had been furious, turned beet red, assigned the class an project.  She pitied the classmates who would be forced to team up with her.  They were doomed.  What had happened? Had she offended him? Her most stimulating class had turned into a war zone, with her as the <enemy>.     America, what do you have to say about this work?   Well, I think that the author--   The author? Name please.  Are you even prepared.    I think that Metier presents the central protagonist as a mouthpiece for his belie--   Presents the protagonist? Mouthpiece  Where is your soul? You speak like a machine.  This is a creation of art.  Speak of it with the respect it deserves.  Luc, perhaps you can do better?   So had given up trying to let it blow over.  Their verbal sparring had been replaced with petulance that defied logic.  The other students in the class were equally as confused by the irrationality of the display.  They could only assume there was a reason for it to which they were not privy and kept their distance.  But she, the new class pariah, knew that there was nothing else to know.  She was just as confused as they.  Except she was also taking home the grades that went along with this classroom theater of the insane.    She had tried to schedule a meeting during his office hours and he had been too busy or had meetings or just walked away from her.  She kept thinking, This is a professor.  This is my teacher.  And my teacher is avoiding me.  Mostly she just thought, What the fuck.  She decided there was nothing she could do but keep her head down, swallow the F that was inevitably coming her way, and take the class again next section from another professor, preferably Mme.  Mannelle.  She was 70 years old and hopefully beyond a point of getting mad at students.    And because sometimes the universe likes to amuse itself by playing out like a movie, the day following her decision to take all this to a <zen> place, he held her after class and informed her that she was to come to his office that evening after school to discuss her performance.  She was failing.  He was going to yell at her.  At least there would be no audience to add public humiliation to her personal humiliation.    She arrived after French Modernists class, her final one of the day.  His door was closed and so to continue on with the im in a movie feeling she stood outside of it just staring.  She knew the moment she knocked the abuse would begin and the anterior lobby was feeling like the hug before the storm in that moment.  She knocked.  He barked.  And she entered.    She was sitting at his desk.  It was difficult to look imposing in an office filled with modern furniture.  A futuristic red chair behind a <stick like> thin eames desk did not hold quite the authority of a big leather chair behind a heavy grandfatherly bureau of decades past.  He gestured the simple shaker chair facing him and waited.    She had decided on the walk over that he was unstable.  He was clearly going through something in his personal life, maybe his marriage was in trouble, maybe his position as the university was being reviewed, whatever it was, it wasnt about her.  He was unstable.  She had become the misplaced focus of his crazy pants ire because she was outspoken.  And the way to deal with this was to keep her mouth shut, take it, and try to escape this class with a C.  And if not, there was always grandmere Mannelle.  Everything would be okay.  This was not about her.    This was entirely about her.  He looked at her steadily for a full moment.  She could see the color rise in his face while he just stared at her.  When the color in his face reached its peak he began to yell.  It started with her work in class -- she was arrogant, she was not working hard, she had thought she could charm him and win her grades rather than earn them.  And then it got personal.  She was american.  She was haughty with her contributions, with her clothing, with her behavior, her jokes.  Why so many jokes.  Was she there to perform or to learn? To become something better than the uncultured country rat that she was.    He was brutal.  And he was enjoying it.  She wished she couldnt see how much he was enjoying it.  The rant seemed to provide him some sort of  catharsis.  His face took on less of a vegetable like color the longer he unburdened his anger at her, until he became actually calm.  And again he just looked at her.  And she just looked back, too stunned to speak.  Ten minutes prior she had begun to defend herself but the rage in his voice was quick to shut her up and reconsider.  She was afraid he would strike her and was okay with letting crazy be crazy if it meant walking out of her unbruised.    Im sorry.  I have been harsh with you.    She looked up again into his face.    You started as my most promising student and I take this very personally.  You have potential and you have let me down.  I wont allow it.  It is, as I said, personal to me that my students succeed.  Especially the bright ones.  This would be the most offensive of failures if I let you fail.    She was trying to absorb this change in tone.  He was sounding noble but how had she failed him so terribly?   He walked around his anemic desk and sat on the chair next to her.    It is true you should be having a cultural experience here was well, but your academic experience is more important.  You are unfocused.  You are going out too much, studying too little.  Your work is atrocious.  You must make the choice to being your heart back here to your work.  I am going to help you.  Or you will fail.    He had his hand on her shoulder, looking at her with a confusing intensity.  He was searching for something in her face.  She remained silent, waiting for something she didnt quite understand what.    <I cannot let you fail.  It would be my failure.  I have a plan for you.  And if you do not commit, do not follow you will fail, and then what will you have? You will return to Texas? To the your small town void of culture, void of art? Will you work at a chain restaurant or a department store like your friends who never left? You will listen to me.  I have a plan for you. > (rewrite, reword>   His hand slid from her shoulder to her face.  He looked at her for a moment, still with uncomfortable intensity.  Then he brought his other hand to her face and pulled her into a kiss.  In her shock, her mind filled with static and she kissed him back.            <The next few weeks were a confusing blur. > She wasnt sure what had happened, what was happening.  <why it was happening?> She went to class.  He berated her.  He had begun to berate everyone to be fair, but she seemed to receive special berating attention.  She hoped at least that she was slightly less singled out now.  And as students began to fear becoming targets themselves, they looked at her less, noticed her less.  Somehow she was still marked though and it was like they instinctually knew to stay away from her.  Though now perhaps everyone was just keeping to themselves.  You never knew who else would be a target and therefore no allies were safe.  For the best.  No allies, no allied gossip.  Or so she told herself.    She had tutoring sessions with him.  They often kept to a similar script.  She arrived.  He started with a speech about all the subtleties in the writings she had missed, all the deeper meanings in the art that everyone missed but she should not have.  This speech was followed by instruction, lecture, a second class just for her.  And in these times, she lost herself in her passion for her studies, for this.  This was why she had come here.  For an hour, maybe two she would get a private lesson.  It felt intensely secret and <special>.  She wasnt just studying for tests and degrees, she was learning what the masters thought of the masters.  She never took notes.  She listened, asked questions and more questions, debated, shouted, and she could not get enough.  This education was <from a deeper perhaps darker place that she could not have dreamed of. > And then as the script progressed, usually in the middle of an impassioned argument or sometimes during an obscure question, he would get that look and come at her.  Sometimes while he was screaming at the insanity of being unable to teach a specific piece or tearing up a the beauty of a passage, she would come at him.    Today he was telling her about <some shite here> sitting across from her.  He has said something absurd.  She had told him that he was inventing symbolism and hidden rhetoric where there was none.  He proceeded to prove her wrong, pull phrases out of simple descriptions and match them to wartime propaganda speeches from the area, show her how seemingly banal descriptions of <banal> items in certain s matched iconic posters, iconic images, iconic paintings.  The author had written subversive pieces that the government had missed.  And so had she.  She marveled at his wit, his brilliance, and also at his ability to have her here now and somehow she wanted to be here, wanted to be here learning these things forever.  she was spending all of her time at university, in the libraries, validating his lessons.  She wanted to follow his plan for her.     He grabbed the back of her head and kissed her.  She climbed to the floor and knelt in front of him, her arms sliding up his thighs.  He grabbed her under her arms and lifted her onto his lap, straddling him and kissed her hard pulling her as close as possible pressing her into him, his hands dragging down her back and onto her hips.  <He kissed her forever. > He kept kissing her, not letting her face ever leave his.  He stripped her of her sweater and tank in one motion, hands touching every inch of her body.  Her skirt was already pushed up around her waist, her boots wrapped around the chair legs pulling herself down and toward him as if she couldnt get close enough.  She clawed at his clothes in return but he pushed her hands away by grabbing them, intertwining his fingers with hers, pulling them back around his neck.  Kissing.  He wanted more kissing, more her body pressed against him.  He was endlessly patient and it made her endlessly impatient<, it made all of this her idea. >   He stroked her back with deep pressure then brought them around to her breasts.  He pulled off her bra and broke his face from hers for only a moment to pay them proper attention at being unveiled.  Then more kissing, his hands caressing her, gently squeezing her nipples, then wrapping his arms back around her and down and pulling her roughly onto him.     She was losing her mind, squirming and rocking on him, when he picked her up, wrapping her legs behind his back.  He cleared the <items> on his desk with one hand and laid her down on the edge.  Slowly <they came together> and then he shoved her further on the desk and climbed on top of her.  Him never losing his professorial strength and control, her focusing solely on not releasing the <screams> that were building inside her.      What a fucking cliche I am, she thought on the train back to her apartment.  Then she thought about how much studying she had ahead to be prepared for the next days class.          She and Sabine had been fighting.  Above all other things, Sabine wanted her attention and in the past few weeks, her attention had been on her studies, on other things.  But their relationship had shifted before this, or so she told herself.  That evening with Anais had ended with Sabine getting up, making coffee, kissing her goodbye.  and leaving with a promise to call later.  Which of course she didnt.  She disappeared for a week and a half, like she usually did, although this was longer than her usual.  And when she appeared, and she always just appeared, she sat down next to her at the cafe they had made their own, and kissed her and promptly started to fight with her.     Do you fuck Anais after I left?   Did I fuck the girl that you brought over specifically to fuck after you left from fucking us both? No, Sabine, I did not.    And so the nonsensical argument began.  And it ended as they always did, with her naked -- this time in the cafe bathroom.  Again.  She felt sorry for the cafe owners.  They had to know and be repulsed.  Either that or they knew and had installed a camera.  She never seemed to care at the time, only <fretted> about it later.    They walked home hand in hand, still tense.  She didnt know what that fight was about but it seemed misplaced.  Sabine was not one to care about anything really, but especially such pedestrian concerns as she called them.  They made it home and slept together again, but this time it was slow and sweet and savoring, a kind they had never had before -- much different from their usual frenzy and fever.  Sabine even stayed the night, another first.     She woke to the click of the door in the morning.  Sabine had stayed but she had still escaped unseen.  She smiled at her need to appear a mystery at all times.  But to her surprise she found pastry and coffee both steaming in the kitchen with a note saying she would see her soon and signed it with love.  Wonders and their never ceasing, she thought.         But that thought of course was silly.  She should have known it at the time.  Her head should have ached from the piercing strike of a flash of obvious <foreshadowing>.    After two weeks of an absent Sabine, she went to her shop.  She worked on Tuesdays -- mostly, when she felt like, and so she had gambled.  The store was empty as it was the time of day that everything shut down for two to three hours.  She had expected the shop to be closed but with Sabine sketching at the counter.  But the door was unlocked and the shop was empty and of course to no ones great surprise Sabine was in the back, underneath Anais.    A transition threesome? Were those a thing? She tried to feel indignant but couldnt muster the righteousness.  This was Sabine.  She was  Sabine.  She loved her for her spirit and wasnt this just more spirit.  No it was something else.  A revenge fuck for one that hadnt happened.  She could see it in Sabines eyes, alive and proud of herself.  This is where youve been, what youve been doing instead of paying attention to me.  And now, I have returned the favor.    Oh.  She got it now.  And she had no idea what to do with it.  The thing was that Sabine wasnt hurt.  She wasnt jealous.  She wasnt feeling betrayed.  She just wanted to win.  And she was currently feeling like she had lost her attention and would not have such a thing.  And thus, this.  She wondered exactly how busy Sabine had been over the past two weeks and how much of it would crop up in the very near future.  For Sabine never did anything without the intention that it hang in a gallery for an audience.    Anais, swept up her clothes with one hand, silently kissed Sabine on the cheek, walked toward her standing in the door frame.  She kissed her on the mouth and kept walking, while slipping into her dress before she hit the outer front door as if she did this sort of thing every day.    Well.  That should clear that up.            It was her first birthday, first reason to celebrate anything since she'd been back in Texas.  She wanted to let it pass by unnoticed.  She wanted to cancel her birthday this year.  Birthdays were a time for taking stock of what had accomplished over one's life -- or at least over the past year.  And it was a time to scheme over the upcoming year -- what improvements to make, what goals to set, what dreams to chase.  She had left her goals on the pebbled beach among all the other <fast sinking rocks>.  So thinking about the past year -- her final months in Europe, her most recent months here back home, the fact that she kept calling this place home.  These were not happy thoughts.    So it was with these pathetic wistful thoughts that she climbed into her car to head to Jona's house.  Her best friends were throwing her a party.  Because of course they were.  These thoughtful considerate people were throwing a party for her to make her feel happy and loved, and she was sulking and complaining.  Perhaps she had not left behind all she had learned in France, she thought.  She started the car, turned on some you can't listen to this and not feel happy music, and headed toward this party where she would smile, and answer ""how'd say this in French?"", and smile some more.    She was not prepared.  They had decided to throw her a party in a proper ""welcome back to Texas"" fashion.  Texas themed, was inadequate to describe the .  It was as if every Texas stereotype had exploded in a single house.  And it was the most amazing thing she had ever seen.  There was queso and pigs in a blanket.  There were jugs of whiskey cocktails actually marked with an XXX on the front.  People were dressed as cowboys and sheriffs and bandits and there was actually a couple in a two-person horse costume.  How had they pulled this together? She was just about to freak out about the <amazing> sight of one girl lassoing another, when she saw it.  In the back yard was a mechanical bull.  They had rented a mechanical bull.  She was really truly seeing a mechanical bull, and struggling to stay on top of it was her straight-laced <mommytime> sister wearing an enormous foam cowboy hat and holding a toy pistol.    She almost passed out from the wave of happiness knocking all the ennui out of and as far from her as it could be knocked.  She downed a Texas Tea and made her way through all the hugs and well-wishes to try her luck on the electronic beast.  She stopped half the way there.  She was going to need that lasso for this.    ---   She was standing near the beast after he had beaten her for the third time, talking to the wranglers.     So, this must be a crazy job.  Having to work around a bunch of drunk idiots all the time seems like it would be really annoying.    No way.  I have the best job in the entire world.  I show up.  I bring something everyone's excited about.  And then people have the time of their lives.  I'm always at celebrations or positive events.  EVeryone is always nice, always having fun, always offering me drinks -- thank you, by the way.  I really love.  SEriously.    And she believed him.  She loved his attitude.  And she loved that he had helped make her birthday absurd.  Maybe this night was a little French after all?   She strolled inside to chat with the late night stayers.  A friend from California had flown in to surprise her.  How was she so lucky? She dipped a blanketed pick in a the melted processed cheese food and couldn't help but smile at all the cut out cactuses and and toy guns and the surplus of cowboy hats strewn about.  The pile of boots had grown over the past few hours and the cast of whiskey soaked couch crashers was starting to assemble.    She decided it was time.  She needed to let everyone one that she was an asshole and had been an asshole for months.  She wanted everyone to know that she appreciated them for who they were and everything they did for each other.  She crossed the room to the stereo and made hip-hop station come to a party foul stop.  And in a very loud, slightly slurring voice she said, Excuse me? Everyone? I think it's time.  And she put on ""All my exes live in Texas/I've got friends in low places/anything else?"" grabbed the girl standing nearest to her and pushed her into a very sloppy two-step around the living room floor.            She hadn't spoken French in a year.  When she traveled with her family to Canada, she wouldn't do it.  When her niece begged her, she wouldn't do it.  When anyone's French friend visited, she acted like she never learned a word of it.  It was too associated with dreams from her past.     She had new dreams now.  Sort of, she guessed.  Okay she didn't have new dreams    But she missed it.  Occasionally, she watched old French movies and tried to ignore the subtitles.  Usually they were dirty movies, so ignoring the subtitles was not so difficult.  And it was slipping.  She didn't understand as much as she used to.  Her vocabulary was slipping.  She'd decided to start studying Spanish instead.  She was in Texas after all.  It was supposed to be similar.  How hard could it be? And maybe it would satisfy this life goal left abandoned.  How was it that she didn't speak another language, didn't speak 4 other languages.  She'd always hated that about american education.  She was going to be different.  And now look.  She had there half-assing Rosetta Stone Spanish.  She had started dating a Venezuelan girl.  But she hadn't even told her she was studying Spanish.  What was she going to do? Wow her with the fact that she could say La bicicletta es roja and la fleur es peguinia? That would most certainly impress her and be the thing that moved them past their complete inability to laugh at the same joke or discuss a topic without fighting.  It was too bad.  She was a smart girl, but combative.  And what brought Venezuela joy felt like work to her.  And what made her happy felt like work to Venezuela.  She was not sure why they were still seeing each other.  She thought it was because they had so much conflict when talking about where to eat dinner that bringing up actual conflict might result in actual fire and property damage.    But she would deal with that next week.  This week: action verbs!    Her friend Joana spoke Spanish.  Maybe they could have Spanish nights? Except she was hesitant to speak Spanish too openly.  Her current boyfriend was Mexican and did not speak a word.  She didn't want to make him feel self conscious.  But maybe they could learn together? Make tacos and talk cervezas? oh god her life had gotten boring and aimless.  She looked around the coffee shop.  It had become her new brooding ground.  The door was marked with a no guns sign.  All establishments that you would actually consider entering should you wish to exit in one place had them.  It was the new sticker.  No shirt, No shoes, No service glued right next to No Guns.  The concealed handgun law had passed and now you had to explicitly state if you wished your patrons to be unarmed.  How was that the default? She wondered if it were the other way around if there would be more or fewer ""Firearms welcome here! stickers.  Last week the governor had shot a dog while running.  Because he runs with a handgun.  The governor goes for jogs with a gun.  And he shot a dog -- a poor dog that did not approach him but that looked like a coyote from a distance.  Apparently shooting coyotes is totally fine.    Where was she living? The state government was convening yet again in an attempt to make abortion illegal.  Politicians the year before a successfully whitened up the history books.  Church was being unseparated from State.  She was unsure how they had violated so many laws of the universe, but time was definitely moving backward in the great state of Texas.  This was why she left.    And then she shuddered.  She left to go someplace more enlightened, to be someone more enlightened.  Was she more enlightened? No.  She was cynical.  She was cynical and cranky and that was possibly worse.  She wasn't going to join a group or volunteer her time, she was going to sit in this coffee shop and complain.  She hated herself.  The most unpleasant people in the world behaved in this way.  They hated.  They complained.  They did nothing.    It was time to make a change.     What was that change going to be? Could she really be happy here? There was a lot of good -- mostly in the form  of people.  And weren't people the point? They were good.  And with a serious fucking soul make over she could be good too.    She would babysit the girls more.  She would volunteer.  She would learn to garden.  Happy people gardened, didn't they? She would work out more.  Endorphins made people happy.  They made people energetic and excited about life -- and made them sleep better.  She take classes -- painting, French --No, not French.  She wasn't ready for that.  Painting, pottery.  Some other bullshit.     Oh god.  What was she doing? If she joined a meetup group she was going to kill herself.  She wasn't this person and pottery wasn't going to make her happy.  What would Professor say? What would Sabine say? Jesus, if they could see her now, hear the positive, self-help bullshit in her head.  Why had she bottomed out so badly.  France has bled her out.  She knew it.  She didn't know how to get back to where she was.  Pottery? What the fuck.  Those places in strip malls were why she was feeling this way, who could she think they'd snap her out.  Just imagine sitting next to some positive 24 year old mother of three children making deformed flower vases? No it was time to stop hiding behind the beer and the queso.  She could be nothing here forever.  She could glaze over her life and watch it all pass by behind a haze of brown lagers and nachos.  hadn't that been what she'd been doing? she just keep doing it.      <yeah, self? just delete this entire section.  this is completely gross and a direct result of trying to hit a word count after falling severely behind.  don't do that again.  this is horrifying and makes no sense and gross.  really gross. >           i was walking home from a disappointing night out in nashville.  i had been certain that i would run out of time to see it all.  I had imagined sauntering bar to bar listening to old men play old country at every stop, my heart swelling with every lyric of a broken man or a good woman, my cheeks tear-streaked from the soulful heart-pourings of prairie-hardened men.  in reality the section of town to which i had been directed was bourbon street gone country -- in too many cases gone 80s cock rock.  the drunken sartorially-challenged gorillas stumbling about even sported the sequined hats and beads of mardi gras colors for some reason.  it was september.  and it broke my unswollen heart.    so back i strolled enjoying the night.  i walked up behind two men on a street corner.  one was probably the drunkest man in the world.  the other, id say he ranked around 4th drunkest.  they were not-so-slightly swaying from the nights revelries.  the drunkest man in the world looked up and his eyes went round.  Hi.  Whats your name? Youre pretty.  I want to hold your hand.  Can I hold your hand? i was particularly amused by this boy.  i think it was his absurd level of intoxication, that drunkenness brought out the sweetie-pie romantic in him, and that i could probably knock him over with an unstable thought.  at this point drunkests friend decided to be my shining knight, my protector, the self-appointed savior of my night and virtue.    exaggeratedly aghast, he pulled his friend away Dude, stop it.  Im sorry maam.  My friend has had a little too much to drink tonight.  Were from Detroit.  its okay.  its fine.  looks like you guys had a great night.  i walked on amused, possibly enjoying that i wouldnt be leaving the this legendary town without human interaction after all.    they continue their wobble home behind me.   Dude.  Dude.  But I just want to talk to her, you know? I mean, look at her ass.  I just want to touch it.  Dude! Stop it.  You cannot touch her.  But just look at it.  Isnt that a great ass.  Admit it.  It is It is.  But you cant touch her.  Leave her alone.  But i want to touch it.  I want to touch it so bad.    i was trying really hard to not huge-smile at this amazingly self-esteem boosting conversation, when drunkest boy decided to make a run for it.  it being my ass.  he broke away from fourth drunkests  grasp on his arm and made a running lunge -- or more like staggering forward somewhat-reaching motion -- at my backside.  The drunkard universe was not on his side and his flailing hand missed its mark.  fourth drunkest pulled him away.  Dude! What are you doing?! You cannot touch her! Im so sorry, maam.  Hes harmless.  Im so sorry.  Ill keep him in line.  Its fine, really.    again i resumed my entertaining walk toward the hotel.  drunkenness was hilarious in this harmless, puppy dog moony form.  drunkest could not quit his mission.  he made another running attempt at me, again missing, and almost going down because of the momentum of his swinging ass-grabber.  again, fourth, with a great show of chivalrous horror, pulled him away.  an argument about the quality of my ass and its touchability ensued.  i was swallowing my laughter with all my energy.    then the point arrived that sadly always does.  fourth, frustrated with Drunkests behavior and refusal to listen to knightly instruction, pushed him into a city planter.  anger finally flared in drunkest and he launched himself at his friend.  he swung the first punch.  and missed.  completely.  fourth then swung back.  and missed.  after four non-connecting punches they resorted to tackling with more success.  they went down to the sidewalk and sloppy, whiskey-weak wrestling began.     i fought the urge to stay and watch this play out.  i  really wanted to see the final  where they realize neither of them have a fight in them and that they are laying on the sidewalk in the middle of nashville, tennessee -- and hopefully laugh? but as i seemed to be the feather that set off the trigger of this little theater, i chose to walk away.     i headed to my hotel bar rather than my room.  nashville had turned out to be entertaining after all and i was suddenly  up for another act.            <eval order> She woke up to her alarm in a panic.  She had been holed up in one of the few houses that were still standing.  There were others with her, a survival team.  But she was the leader and she was responsible for all of them.  They had boarded up the house and and it was holding, but they were running out of food and they had to go out into the word.  She wasn't sure what was out there in the apocalyptic world -- other survivors were usually dangerous, and zombies -- there were almost always zombies.  But whatever was out there, it was always trying to kill her, kill them.    They went out to forage for food and friendly survivors and made their way to a house that looked completely untouched by the devastation around them.  Something was wrong in this house.  They had to investigate.  They broke in entirely too easily.  At first glance, the home looked like any other pre-disaster suburban home with old style carpeting and big furniture reminiscent of the comforts of old.    A team member found it first, just one door and then many.  The walls slid apart to reveal tunnels -- but not of the dirt and rock to cave variety that they had dug as means of back up escape.  These looked like the insides of a space carrier, tech they had never seen.  These hallways glowed with electricity the rest of the world hadn't seen in a year.  As they were about to enter, they saw the first child.  He was four.    They were shocked.  Most children hadn't survived.  And then many children emerged from hidden places.  The oldest was ten and the others ranged in age all the way down to the baby they hadn't seen sleeping in a nook in the living room.  Their instinct immediately kicked in.  Children? We have to save them.  They're just children.    But.  What was off about this, about them.  They all wore the same face -- not similar, the exact same.  And suddenly they knew exactly where they were.  He was cloning himself.  He was building an army of men with his face -- with his brain, the brain that wrought all the devastation the world now bore.    buzz, buzz, buzz.  Fuck, she hated alarms.  Wouldn't the world be a better place if alarms didn't exist, if people went to work when they woke up, when <apocolyptic wartime rescue missions> were allowed to play out to their conclusion?   She lay there gathering herself.  She wasn't sure if it was the contrast of the badass sci-fi humanity saving version of her dream self against actual beer-drinking ""just hangin out man"" actual version of herself, but <change was afoot/ she was ready blah blah something less lame here>.    ---   She was moving.  She didn't know where or how but she was going.  she had to get out of Texas.  She didn't fit and it made her lazy.  She had fun in this state but she didn't have goals.  She decided she would try out different cities.  She made a list.  She bought travel guides of each.  She had a plan.    Denver was first.  A friend from high school was there, so she had a place to stay.  She had an interview with a graduate program dean.  She had apartments picked out to visit.  She had a plan.    She was going through security in the Austin airport when she was pulled aside for the random thorough search.  No big deal.  This happened occasionally.  The pat down when smoothly like it always did.  she regathered her shoes and the agent performed the swab test on her carry on back pack.  He was calmly explaining to her that they were testing for explosive residue so she had nothing to worry about.  When suddenly she had something to worry about.  The machine beeped and flashed.  The agent wrinkled his brow and performed the test again.  He had that }this can't be right} look on his face that she knew did not come from a good place but she was feeling like working the system at the moment.  He swabbed a third time and she swore the machine beeped louder and flashed brighter with impatience.  He finally looked at her and sighed and let her go.  But not before telling her that she had automatically been put on a watch list by the machine.  She would be fully searched by TSA agents every time she flew for the next year.  Every.  Single.  Time.  She was running late and so she rushed on hoping that he was exaggerating and wondering where she could buy a new back pack in Denver.    She got off the plane in the wide open plains of Denver with its barren beauty.  She liked this town.  It was a city but still so close to nature, to the mountains, to rivers and lakes and hiking and skiing.  Who wouldn't like it here.  Plus it was so dry that her hair looked amazing.  Not a frizzed hair in sight.  She  smiled out at the rocky mountains in the distance pulling her rental car out onto the highway into town.     Cats.  Holy hell, Abby had so many cats.  How did she not know this.  She was so allergic.  Plus cats were mean and they were always out to get her.  She ignored them and they loved her for it.  They were just like girls that way.  They knew she didn't want anything to do with them so they spent all their energy trying to crawl into her lap and wrap around her neck.  Abbs seemed completely unphased by her red streaked swollen eyes and snotty nose to rival any four year old.  She saw and didn't care and bounced into her bed room for the night closing her door and leaving her cats on the other side with her on the couch.  And that night in between the seven total minutes of sleep she got, she learned that cats really, really like to sleep on faces.  Denver was pissing her off.    She got up upsettingly early and tried to shower the dander off her body.  First stop was definitely going to be the drug store.  She stayed in the gloriously cat-free bathroom for as long as she could drag it out.  Her nose wouldn't stop bleeding.  Denver was so dry.  She slathered the inside of her nostrils with neosporin to try to calm her angry nose down.  This was not mixing so well with the allergy snot fest, but it was either this or shove cotton balls up her nose for the interview.    She was driving down the stretch of road connecting Abby's way out apartment complex to the rest of Denver civilization when she realized why the car had been pulling to the left the day before.  A flat tire.  She couldn't fucking believe she had a flat tire.  She pulled to the side of the road, looked around for the hidden cameras, and then got to work staring at the sad, torn up back tire.  How had they let her drive off the lot with this thing.    Like any self-respecting girl who fancies herself wonderwoman, she took a deep breath, rolled up the sleeves of her interview-appropriate button down shirt, and started to read the owner's manual.  And on this day she learned that those things actually work.  20 minutes later she was hefting and leveraging and swearing the spare tire into place.  And because the universe likes to have fun, after she had the tire in place and was screwing in the second to last bolt, a nice gentlemanly type fellow pulled over to offer his assistance.  She laughed.  She was proud of herself.  And then she looked down at her grease streaked shirt and her watch and left less proud.  She kept laughing though.  What else could she do? Denver hated her.  This was undoubtedly clear.     She had her bag in the car.  There was no way she could stay at Abby's house of feline horrors again and she had planned on pulling a sneaker and staying at a cheap motel.  But she looked at her shirt, then suspiciously at the remaining three tires and decided that she would listen to Denver.  She would respect Denver's words.  She would smile and nod and back away from Denver very slowly.    At the airport, the fine gentleman behind the counter told her that she had nine hours ahead of her before the next flight to Austin -- oh and that for some reason there was a strange code on her ticket.  Did she know why she was on a watch list?      Toronto.  Toronto looked promising.  Or at least it read promisingly.  <promising?> All three Toronto travel books were in big fat lusty love with Toronto.  The art! The culture! The food! The friendly people! And the gay .  She did not know that the gay  in Toronto was considered the second best in the world behind San Francisco.  She was shocked.  She loved a vibrant cultural and arts .  She could not wait to see every sight, drink in every bar, meet as many friendly gay Canadians as Toronto could strut her way.    She was on the intra airport shuttle when she heard her first }aboot}, her first }eh?},  all in the same sentence talking about hockey.  She thought she had died and gone to stereotype heaven.  She hopped in a cab, taking no rental chances, and arrived at her gorgeous and crazy cheap hotel.  <All things were looking eh oooh kay so far. > And so she rushed out to see the things that the books said one had to see.     She hit the museum of < blah blah blah> it was lauded as the best in Canada.  It was  three rooms? How could any museum be only three rooms? Then to the <stuff here>   She decided it was time to call her cultural adventure <o a close>.  She knew what would make her feel better -- the gay quarter.  There was nothing better in this world than the gayborhood.  And this was going to be a Canadian gayborhood.  She could feel the warmth and acceptance already.  And second in the world to rival San Francisco? She couldn't wait.  Wait-- was she there? She couldnt be there.  How-- but-- it was four bars on a corner.  Four.  Four bars.  Fuck it.  She headed into the irish pub of the four, pulled up to the bar and ordered potato skins and a beer.  When in Canada. . .    <more here -- make it not about toronto sucking but about the universe messaging>   And then I went to Chicago.  A friend from California flew out.  She was there for work.  We were going to hit the downtown area, see a show, check out the city that is supposed to be just like New York, except liveable, affordable.  Holy frostbitten nose, Chicago.  No way.  Just.  Cold.  Freezing.  No way.            I was in Monaco -- land of ridiculousness -- the day before I returned home.  I had  been out dancing all night the night before and walked home at dawn, incredibly safe.  Because Monaco is clean and lit and watched.    I woke up to a message from a friend asking if I wanted to go out on so-and-sos boat.  And I thought the answer to that question is always yes, so yes.  I threw on clothes and headed down to Port Hercule in the main of Monaco to meet Louise.  As we spill out of the taxi she asks So you know who Stelios is, right? Hes that guy we were out with last night? He seemed to have too much money for his age and thus like hed have a tug boat on which we could take a quick afternoon spin.  Oh no.  was her reply.  Stelios is the founder of EasyJet.  Apparently it was his boat and other moguls of other industries were to be aboard talking about moguly type things.    We strolled up to the 100 foot beautiful black and fine-grain wood yacht named Strangers in the Night, and I thought -- yes, it makes total sense that I would spend my afternoon this way.  Lets do this.    My decided-upon confidence was slightly rattled when I was asked to remove my black soled boots as to not scuff the deck and I was left standing there in my purple unicorn socks, but still.  I was feeling good.  I was still excited to spend the day engaged in charming witty Euro banter with Euro industry greats.    The day was stunningly beautiful -- bright blue sky, deepest blue sea, a solid wind, and an incredible view of Monaco from the sea.  And thats when the universe looked down upon us and said, Oh, thats not right at all.  and decided to take me out.    I proceeded to spend the remainder of the voyage below deck vomiting my face off in the loo.  Oh did I vomit.  I vomited approximately forever, at which time I then dry heaved for another 20 minutes.  The kindly British kitchen head adopted me and eventually coaxed me back on deck with the functional humans.  There, a gorgeous Italian trophy wife sat me in the least queasy spot and gave me the low-down on how to sit back, relax my head, close my eyes, and not open them ever ever again.  And I recovered as we headed back into port.    Stelios began to raise the main sail and asked everyone to vacate the area below it for safety.  I moved inside to warm up, sat for 2 minutes, and belly suddenly, violently told me that our time below was not complete.  I ran downstairs, hurled myself at the door, and found it locked.  Panic does not begin to describe that moment.  I found a sink.  And there I vomited.  In the sink.  Of a bazillion dollar yacht.  With Frank Sinatra crooning Strangers in the Night over the sound system in the background as the namesake soundtrack to our return to land and to my crippling shame.    This is why I cant have nice things.  I know this now.              I lied when I said that we should break up because we werent in love.  What I meant and was afraid to say was because you werent in love.  Youve never cared for being told how you feel and saying that out loud felt too sad.    I know what I mean when I say love is different than what you mean.  I mean openness and affection and care.  Youve twisted it to mean something nebulous and unattainable -- something to withhold for self-protection and control under the guise of purity of concept.  Here were going with my definition.    I loved you.  I loved your from early on when I was so surprised and moved by the little things in the mail and in google documents brimming with thoughtful itineraries.  Its stupid that I never told you.  I tell everyone else.  I loved you for your initial effort and your dedicated selfishness and for the adventurous short-attention span life that we could have and for that face.  Im not sure how I feel now.  Love warps with lack of care and reciprocation into unpleasant jealous and needful versions of itself.    But you didnt love me back.  That is what was wrong.  That was always what was wrong.  I knew from the beginning.  And this awareness made me shrink.  Who I was wasnt loved so I retreated to hide her -- this person who was unloveable.  Distance improves clarity and it is strange to me that I behaved in that way or that I continued trying to win in a place that was never pulling for me.    Im not sure what the point of this is.  Possibly to give some structure to our breakup.  One should be careful of loneliness masked as missing and romanticism cloaked as longing.  I regret not telling you that I cared.  I regret not telling you that I wasnt getting what I needed.  I regret not standing tall and proud and full of self, regardless of how your felt.  After all, I was never really a contender in your garden of ghosts and left-open doors to the past.  Had I behaved differently, things most likely would have ended just the same but perhaps there would have been less frustration , confusion, and annoyance mixed in with the parting sadness.              They met at a cafe that left room for question as to whether they would have coffee or a meal.  It had been 12 years since their relationship ended --  since their relationship that became a no-rules non-relationship that imploded into years of silence.     They evaluated each other over the absurdly small table.  The size of which implied that, yes, they would only be having coffee and only if the mugs were of espresso stature.  They had aged.  They had finally become the old they had called themselves and each other long ago.  She supposed one holds more reverence for words when they begin to be accurate.  He had gained the weight of middle-age and wore the softness of his disinterest in exercise.  His hair had thinned and turned uniformly grey like his fathers, though now it was short after years of an unkempt shag.  Her grey was camouflaged by money and the skills of her stylist.  She was still thin, but thinness on a woman of her years tended to have an aging effect.  The angles in her face were too sharp and her skin told of a life in the sun.     They sat there quietly, awkwardly for a moment taking each other in, each revisiting their own memories.  Howve you been? seemed a preposterous question.  How to begin after all the time together -- then all the time apart.  Time distorts in strange ways.  The ways sometimes cruel, sometimes kind but the actual events always lay twisted and remolded on the timeline.  In which ways had she curated their memories? Had he?    Is he wearing a shirt that he always wore those years ago? And owned years before that? She smiled at this thought, at the consistency of it, of the maintenance  of a quirk.  She was after all wearing a necklace he had given her.  It was a gesture, perhaps.  Or perhaps it was a way for her to connect to this day, a ritual of remembrance.   She had spend an hour struggling over her appearance knowing it wasnt something that he would notice or would matter to him.  She smirked at the supposition that he was probably still in his underwear unconcerned 2 minutes before he needed to leave.  But he was on time.  And people change.     We dont allow people to change in our minds as time passes.  They pass from people into characters of our own fiction.  It was time to check in on her characters true life counterpart.  Again she didnt know where to begin and she felt nervous.  How silly an old woman feeling nervous.  So she did what she always did -- she just said the awkwardly honest thing she was thinking.     I cant believe I feel nervous.  I dont know where to begin.     They both laughed, softened -- and decided to begin with today.              She walked out of the bathroom staring at her feet, doing the math on how many hours and how many drinks she still had <left> in her, when she smashed into the body on standing directly on the other side of the door.  Flinching to attention she was standing 3 inches from him.  The one they called Hot Smith Handsome.  They hadn't tried terribly hard with that nickname, she would admit, but it served its primary purpose, did it not? And besides, who wouldn't be flattered by that? And Nice Smart Polite Smith didn't have the same zing.  She flushed as these thought sped through her mind, followed by the thought that she hoped he never discovered that they called him this.    She apologized for the trampling and yammered on something about appreciating his service in the washroom standing guard.  stupid.  stupid.  stupid.  she always said something stupid around HSH.  It was the pretty boy curse.  HIs hot handsomeness made her uncomfortable.  Why was she so funny around people she had absolutely no attraction to? The universe did enjoy toying with her.    She placed her left hand just above his right elbow as she was wrapping up her awkwardness show and was sliding past him, possibly a little too closely -- but didn't she deserve that after <embarrassing herself like she just had?> And at that moment, his left hand slid to mimic hers and came to rest on her elbow.  And then the other slid around her back and pulled her in those remaining inches.  He was smiling and looking into her face searching for  something, permission.  She hoped it was permission.  She paused, searching back.  She leaned in ever so slightly and he took his cue.  His hand left her arm and found its way behind her neck.  He pulled her into a rather ferocious kiss -- the kind that has been building strength from a long, slow burn.  He pushed her up against the doorframe, cradling her back, the ferocity never diminishing, and then he rolled her back into the bathroom and closed the door.    And thus proceeded the most amazing bathroom make out session in the history of make out sessions.  <Perhaps her terrible jokes had some magic in them after all. > <kill the end liners>           This section at school had been a beast.  Work, Sabine, class, private class -- they were all keeping her manically busy, keeping her from thinking, keeping her from breathing.  But this was why she was here in this place -- to stretch herself beyond what she thought possible, to have experiences, to grow up - grow out of her simple born framework and into someone new, someone better.  She was certainly learning.  A lot.    The current term would be wrapping up in two weeks.  She wasn't sleeping.  There wasn't time for such indulgences.  She had class.  She had to study.  She had to stare at Sabine while she danced her Sabine dance.  And she had four tutoring sessions left with the Professor.  Maybe five.  He couldnt decide whether she was shamefully unprepared for the exam or just insultingly so.  He had much work to do with the continued sculpting, much.  He never gave any indication that she was anything less than his most disappointing prospect.   But she could take it.  She was reveling in the extra learning.  She loved the avalanche of it.  And his ever radiating brilliance warmed her in a way she couldnt understand.  Just being near his brain made her grateful and small, appreciative for ever second he would share it with her.    And he  she didn't know what he thought.  He never cracked -- always the poised professor, always brilliant, always teaching, until his hunger for her grew to unfightable levels.  He loved that she battled him.  She could see it in his posture.  He loved their battles, their fights over meaning, nuance, societal impact.  He rose even taller when she fought him.  And each session, during a particularly heated point, he would stride across to her, poise intact, and pull her against him.  And then after, clothes and room in disarray, they would lie there and continue their talk, their debate, his lesson.  His education was never ending.  She loved it.  She wanted it.  But she admitted that she didn't quite know what it was.  Class was normal, perhaps additionally grueling given the state of wrap up.  The division of students leaving feeling destroyed seemed to increase over the number who left elated at receiving his approval, usually arriving my way of a nod and a lack of beratement.  The exam was in two days.  These students would not sleep, would consume more coffee than a nervous system should ever endure, and then it would be done.    She arrived for their final session.  She knocked.  He barked.  She entered.  He was sitting at his desk bend over a manuscript, <intently> focused, scribbling.  Editing maybe? She wasn't sure.  She sat in the chair facing him and waited.  After he had delayed noticing her for a length of time long enough to be effective, looked up.    We will not need out session today.    Why is that? The exam is ? We were not done discussing the manifesto of    He waved her off.  I believe you have learned enough.  Take it with you and apply it.    She stood -- confused, hesitant.  But he had returned to his work.  She didn't know what she was feeling right then.  And so she left for the library to study.  She had learned enough.  Perhaps she would just go home, call Sabine, get drunk.    A proctor administered the exam.  It was the most difficult exam she had ever taken, but she felt she would do well -- at least in comparison.  She saw the Professor once in the university after that.  He acknowledged her with a nod.            Sabine had completely forgotten any and all infractions she had made against our relationship, or any that we had made together.  It was just not spoken of.  And she wrapped herself around me as we strolled the museums or the beach or the stops and gazed at me with adoration.  The love stare she called it.  Le regard damour, ma une.  And things were good.    A new bar opened in Nice and we went on opening weekend.  It was a techno wonderland.  Tables in the front and a dance floor in the back.  And then as 11:00 arrived the dancing took over the front as well.  Patrons climbed on the tables and danced and shook and did other various moves of danger when drunk and jumping around on an elevated surface.    We were dancing on a long table in the front when Sabine -- garnering all the attention in the room as usual -- dove off the table.  Only she would be so confident that hitting the floor was not an option.  But she was Sabine, and thus a gaggle of gay boys caught her and cheered and hoisted her higher and out into the back.  Because her every move was a  from a movie.    I danced another song or two with a young german girl then hopped down to solid, unwobbly ground again to get a drink to become more wobbly.  A very handsome guy was leaning on the bar and struck up a conversation when I approached.  He]d been watching us dance.  We looked like we were having a smashing time.  And he knew Sabine a little, had met her several times around town.  And he offered to buy us drinks -- where was she now? In the back in the middle of a pile of club kids, I said.  Yes, let]s have drinks.  She]ll come up for and whisky air soon.    He ordered.  Three drinks came.  I decided -- something, I]m not sure what.  To channel Sabine in some meaningless way, and reached for her whisky instead of my wine.  He raised an eye brow but then toasted to the magic of nights on the riviera.  We pushed our way through the crowd to the pool tables in the side room for where we told random stories about the bars we visited and the music we danced to and the drinks we drank, and laughed, and he wiped the newly refinished floor with me at pool.    I heard banging.  So much banging.  What was that banging.  I finally awoke enough to realize that it was the door and it was loud.  The neighbors would be angry.  I sat up, pained.  I wrapped the sheet around my naked body and shuffled to the door.  Sabine was on the other side of it.  Why was she standing there.  Why was she banging.    What the fuck, she said.  What happened to you?   What? I don't.  What?   She pushed her way in.  I was confused.  I didn't understand.  I just wanted to sleep.  My body demaned that I return back to my bedroom, I noticed a broken jar of peanut butter on the kitchen floor as I passed by.  What? When I awoke again it was dark and Sabine was laying in bed staring at me.  She looked worried and angry -- each emotion fighting for dominance.    Do you live now? What.  The Fuck.  Happened to you last night? We had plans.  A whole night of plans.  You disappeared.    I  I don't know.  I]m confused.  I don't remember the night.  I must have gotten so drunk that I blacked out    When? When did you get so drunk? Did you do secret shots while I was in the toilet?   No.  I  I had one with you.  Then we danced.  Then I went to the bar and  had one more.  I don't understand.  I met a guy -- a friend of yours I think, we played pool and then it]s like a curtain came down on the night.  It is black.  It is nothingness.    You were with Kima? I saw him.  He said you were his date for the evening but you disappeared on him.  I was  worried.  Kima is not a nice man.    And we lay there and reconstructed the night.  I thanked my body for sensing danger and kicking into autopilot to take me home.  I must have fled home, stripped in the hallway, attempted to eat, I guessed? But only managed to destroy the kitchen.  And then I slept for 16 hours.  I never slept in, even after a late night the night before.  My body did not however flee to Sabine to care for me.  Odd.  Perhaps not unexpected.  Perhaps my brain acknowledged things that I did not and knew best.    Then I remembered the key detail.  I drank the whisky not the wine.  Was there a different plan? Incapacitate Sabine so he could leave with her? Or so he would have to help me take her home? Were both drinks tainted? None of the options were anything but vile.  You would think that such a charming man would be successful relying on his charms alone.  Sabine was right.  He was not a nice man.  And I was a very lucky girl.    I got a phone call the next day.  Heather? Heather this is Kima.  I am worried for you.  You left without saying goodbye.  I was surprised.  I would like to see you soon.  He has my phone number? And who is Heather? My name is not Heather.  I still felt cobwebs in my head.  Whatever Kima packs, it is not amateur.            Sabine threw a party.  A very large party.  Shed never actually been to her apartment before.  How was that possible.  Sabine had always been to her place or they were out in the world -- seeing it, being part of it, shaggin in it.  It always seemed normal until she was actually invited there.  And then it seemed very strange.  She had roommates, she had said.  They didnt like company.  She didnt like them.  It was never clear.  She did not talk of it unless pressed.    And so there was to be a party.  She spend time in the shops picking out something new, something interesting, something she thought Sabine would like.  She didnt know why she was being a girl about this party, but it felt special somehow, this invitation to her home, like she had passed a test, a milestone.  She put on her new dress, twisted her hair around in a way she knew Sabine liked it, and then for a change put on lipstick.  And then she wiped off the lipstick.  She was clearly getting carried away.    She strolled down the promenade to a part of town shed never passed through.  It was residential and wealthy.  She would never have had reason.  She a student and Sabine an artist and shop girl.  And yet here she was, rolling up to a massive brownstone and ringing the bell.  Was this the right place?    Sabine answered the door by throwing it open and throwing herself on her.  The toppley hug was a welcomed welcome.  Sabine was tipsy and happy, and she was excited to see and meet and greet more of Sabines world.  She played her life close, and this was a crack of a window in.  She was feeling good in her new dress of flattering fit and color.  She let Sabine drag her in, encircled in her arms with her head up.     And it was a fantastic party, unlike any she had seen outside of a television show.  The music was loud and the people were beautiful and seemed to never stop dancing.  She was swept up in the exuberance.  This dream was her life now.  She was here.    Passing through the kitchen, someone dropped a glass and it shattered on the floor.  The noise was met with whoops and cheers and more dishes hitting the floor.  No one stopped dancing.  Where was she? She wandered through the rooms of the multi-floored abode -- three stories in all, each floor a party to itself.  All of Nice was here.  The second floor had a dj and gardening tubs filled with ice and wine.  Glasses hung upside down from a cable with clips attached.  One booze ambassador would self-appoint every 10 minutes and sweep through filling glasses.  No one stopped dancing.  The third floor was a little calmer -- still dancing but no bar.  A few drugs were being done around the edges of the room -- all joy and sharing and humanity radiated from this floor.  She loved everything about this party.  So where was Sabine.    Back down to the first floor, the main bar and dance floor she saw Sabine dancing in the middle of the room.  Because of course Sabine was dancing in the middle of the room.  Sabine looked up and saw her.  She smiled.  She laughed and flew at her dragging her into the middle with her, pulling her body against hers, dancing all the while.  She kissed her.  She never stopped dancing.  And then she very suddenly broke away from her and climbed on to a tall floor speaker.  She yelled at the DJ and then started to yell at the room:   Tout le monde! Everyone! You must meet my love -- voila cest elle, la.  She is my heart, mon coeur! I am hers and she is mine pour toujours! Et maintenant, we dance!   And she jumped off the box, knocking over a potted tree as she flew at her, she tackle hugged her and knocked her to the floor, where she lay on top of her kissing her and kissing her as the party went on around them.  And no one stopped dancing.    --   She woke up the next morning curled into a two girl fetal ball in the middle of the living room on the second floor.  Various party girls and party boys were strewn about passed out in singles and twos and several threes.  The light shone in from the wide bay windows, casting a mystical blue glow on the chaos aftermath, giving it an angelic filter over the pain that was sure to come as the sleeping angels started to wake one by one.  But for the moment, she was the only soul stirring.  She replayed the evenings dream like happenings and s and smiled.  She pulled Sabine in closer and drifted off with her face buried in her hair.  The day would bring chores and aches and drama, but this moment was perfect.  She wished she could paint it, capture it, hold it, and stop the next moment from arriving.  She knew it could never be as sweet.            She met Sabine for brunch at their favorite cafe.  When they decided to sit, this was their resting home.  <ew ugly rewrite that> They were always here in the evenings and the weekend afternoons.  The owner brought them their coffees without being asked and they had long stopped noticing the stretches of time that the two of them locked themselves in the washroom.  They liked their little oiseaux that always lit and perched there for hours.  It had become their public home.    She was writing.  A poem had been poking at the back of her brain all week, scratching her, begging to be let out.  And Sabine was reading and chatting with the couple at the next table.  They were speaking quickly and she couldnt keep up with their French when she was only half-listening out of the side of her ear.  The poem.  It was there.  It was important.  But she just couldnt.       She had been taking breaks from studying by writing.  Sabine called it a lateral preoccupation, but she needed it, need to flex her brain in a different way.  Open it back up with the intensity of study forced it into deep ravines of focus.       Where was it.  This would eat her day if she did not find this piece in her mind.    Sabine was chattering something subversive, as usual.  The couple looked intrigued yet uncomfortable.  It was a look she had become accustomed to seeing on the faces of the stranger who Sabine engaged.  And very suddenly they moved away.  What did she say this time, she thought.  I hope it was ultra offensive this round.  I need jarring.     She lost herself in a word <here> losing interest in the distraction when her attention snapped back to the present and Sabine kneeling on both knees facing her on the neighboring table, the couple a few meters away with bemused expressions.    Mon Coeur.  Be my one.  I know that I will cannot be without you.  I would die in your leaving.  Be my one.  Pour toujour.  Say yes, amour? Dis oui?   She dropped her pen, dropped her poem, and nearly toppled the table as she <flew> at her.  Of course, yes.  Bien sur, oui.  Oui! Oui! This girl.  This girl that held the hearts of this town and held her own, wanted her.  Yes, yes, yes.   She threw her arms around her and swung her off the table.  She kept squeezing her and unable to break her kiss from here, afraid that this moment might not be real if she did.  As they continued to spin, they stumbled and they went to the floor.  She rolled on top of Sabine and kissed her and kissed her.  They laid on the floor of the cafe for quite sometime just staring at each other.  The owners scowled at anyone who passed by even slightly too close.  This was their moment.  And it had happened there.  And they were proud to keep if for their petites oisseaux.            She went out to meet Sabine at the harbor.  They were going out on a friends boat she said.  For the day.  For adventure.  And she there she was, waiting for Sabine, excited for the day, and wishing she had some sort of nautical hat to be in theme with the day.    Sabine arrived with a crew, of both the boating and social variety.  And they were all in white.  Sabine in a flowing ankle length flower child dress, and everyone else also in white -- pants, shirts, skirts, dresses.  All white.  Sabine arrived all smiles and volume.  Et pour toi! and threw the white dress in her arms to her and planted a large and loving kiss on her as everyone looked on.    She didnt get the theme or the joke but she didnt care.  She knew not to ask.  She knew it would be a day of fun and the unexpected.  So she stripped on the dock, dropping her clothes to the ground and pulling on the simple white cotton dress.  It tied around her chest and then flowed to her feet.  It was her style as well as the apparent style of the day.  She put her sunglasses back on and followed the monochromatic parade onto the boat.    Champagne was served, songs were sung, and the boat anchored out in a bay near the coast of Italy.  Bodies lazed on the front of the ship soaking up the sun that never got quite too hot at this latitude.  A clear day such as that had to be squeezed for every ray when they appeared.    The crowd was a pleasant level of tipsiness, when Sabine jumped on the seat under the main sail.  Merci tout le monde! Thank you for coming.  Thank you for joining us on this special day of our love.  For today, we belong to each other.  She pulled her up with her and kissed her passionately while the attending white angels cheered and hooted and toasted.    Sabine placed her back on the bench and climbed to the table to make a speech.  She began, I remember the day I first saw my love.  She was sitting alone on the water with a sketch pad and pencil looking so small and melancholy.  And now I look at the fierceness in her soul.  You can see it radiate from her face.  Can you not see it? It makes my heart grow to see this.  And today, I stare at my life and feel overcome at this joy.  This feeling that i will never feel such joy and happiness as I feel right now.     And she halted her speech.  She dropped her champagne flute to the table, letting it spill.  Life will never hold such joy again.  And she walked to the end of the table, hopped to the ledge, and looked back at everyone with tears on her face.  And she lept off the edge into the water.    She and Sabine sat shivering on the dock.  She would not look at her.  She had never felt so angry, such fear, such betrayal.  Rage boiled in her face and in her chest under the thin wet cloth.    Sabine had been attached by a line.  Sabine was now into performance art.  Everyone would watch the video later that evening and a painting of her final mournful glance at her lover as she stepped of the rail of the boat would later capture this inaugural piece from another perspective, another medium, and it  would hang in Sabines apartment.  Everytime she saw it she fantasized about all the ways to destroy it.  Her fear and anger immortalized above a modernist chair that was too uncomfortable to sit in.            Everywhere she and Sabine went now there was a crowd of friends, of fans almost.  She was Sabine.  Loved by all! We went to the bar.  We would know twenty people.  We would go for a walk.  We would run into ten friends.  They even started frequenting our cafe.  They were nice enough.  She didnt mind.  But they were also  adoring, which was odd to her.  They werent like her solid, give you a kidney if you needed it friends back in Texas.  It was more like Sabine was the It factory girl du jour.  But she hadnt seen any work from Sabine lately.  When they first met there were sculptures, impressively small in size -- but never to be called figurines if she wanted to see another sunrise.  And then she was painting.  Wispy watercolors quickly gave way to oils, and that is where shed stayed for most of the year.  And they were beautiful.  Perhaps Sabine had done a show when they were fighting? Perhaps.  That must be it.  She never really knew what Sabine did with her work, or her other time,< or really for money>.  But she always seemed happy and self-sufficient.  She did not worry about her.  Sabine had no worries for herself, so why should she.  There were no worries in the dream.    She continued to sip her cafe noisette and float along in the dream.  She didnt even mind when  three friends she didnt know sat down at their little cafe table and started to ask her questions about Texas and horses and cowboys.    And as if Sabine had heard her wandering thoughts she announced to her that she would have  show in the new gallery opening in the <something something> square.  She was excited to see Sabines latest work.  She had always been part of the process in the past.  Being able to witness the final finished fruits of her artistic labor was a thrill.  She threw on a combination of Sabines favorite items on her and floated out of her apartment.    The gallery was expansive with the usual white walls and light wood flooring.  Through the middle snaked labyrinth like build in three quarter walls, creating an art filled maze for gazers to get lost wandering through with wine in hand and flowery words on the tongue.    And on these walls hung it all.  A few water colors from when they first met, giving way to her oils -- the content taking on a heavier mood along with the paint.  The paintings transitioned from mild city scapes to images of dark turmoil -- abstract but frightening.  They were beautiful.  She stood staring in a corner at some of the darkest pieces -- a woman holding her own head while animals gathered at her feet for a feeding, pondering where this came from in her pretty girlfriends soul.  She had not seen any such depth or <darkness> in her.  Her thoughts were interrupted by the realization that people were noticing her as they walked by.  Whispers of which she caught glints of translation, cest elle, no? She was famous by proxy, she supposed.  And she sighed.  She loved Sabines work but the throngs might become wearisome.    She decided to move on from her spot as a particularly staresome man had taken up perch near her.  She rounded the edge of the inner wall, and found herself in the ending cove of the gallery.  And there she met Sabine, and a room full of paintings of her.    Photographers snapped photos of her seeing this work for the first time.  It seemed unfair, invasive that this should be captured.  That this moment didnt belong to her to  absorb this, to understand what she was seeing.  And what was she seeing? It was a gallery of their most intense moments -- their fights, their ecstasies, their defining moments.  All there on canvas.  The day on the boat.  A morning with Anais.  Them screaming on the promenade.  Her naked and drugged in her apartment.  It was so ugly to see their lives displayed like this.  But it was also beautiful <in that it was>  <rewrite> raw and bare and exposed.  <She was stunned.  She was speechless.  She felt sick. > Their life was life to her.  It was art to Sabine.     And Sabine beamed at her with pride, pride of her own work or of crafting this moment.  She didnt know.  she supposed.             They woke up early after the gallery show.  Sabine was thrilled at the number of pieces she had sold but even more thrilled by the number of art writers that were there.  She had been promised reviews and write ups in every publication she cared about.  Sabines name would be in bold, in all caps, just like she liked it.  And honestly, as it should be.  The world would be less illuminated place with out Sabine dancing on a table top or slathering a canvas with her spastic moods.    She got up and made coffee and toast for the two of them.  Sabine chugged the coffee that was too hot to be chugged, kissed her on the cheek then thought better of it and kissed her hard on the mouth, and then she left, nibbling on her toast-to-go and humming lightly to herself.    She smiled after this wonder and opened her notebook.  She had writing to do and so much swirling around in her head this morning.    ---   They had plans to meet at the shop where Sabine worked at five.  They would go to their cafe and then go for their walk along their promenade and this sit on their bench.  It was her perfect evening.  She arrived at the shop on time and found the couple that owned the shop there.  They were closing up and cleaning a bit.  They looked surprised to see her.    Sabine  isnt here.  Elle nest pas ici.  She is not here any longer You do not know this?   What are you talking about.  I was to meet her here at five.     They looked confused and angry? What was the second emotion.  Sabine is not here.  She left.  She works here no longer.  I dont know what to say to you.    Okay.  So it was anger.  This was clear.  But why anger.  Had she gotten fired? Oh.  She had gotten fired.  She laughed.  She would be at the cafe sulking.    The cafe was empty except for a couple in the back corner.  The owners smiled at her as she walked in -- but not their usual welcoming smile.  There was a wistfulness, a sadness in it.     Bon soir, ma petite oisseau.  Ca va? How are you doing, little bird? You must be so sad.  We cannot believe she is gone.  She paid her tab this afternoon and hugged us.  Told us she had to leave.  You must be a sad bird.  You still come here, oui? We will be your nest now.  Coffee here every day! We insist.    She smiled at them gratefully and fled.  She was stunned but could not stand there and be stunned.  She had to move.  She had to keep moving.  As fast as she could.  If she moved her body maybe her mind could catch up? What was happening.  Why did these people know her life when she was clueless.  What the fuck, Sabine.  She had to keep herself from jogging to Sabines apartment.  It was empty.  At least her floor was.  Someone was still living in the first floor, and he just shrugged at her and held up an envelope from Sabine with the last months rent inside in cash.  She spun without saying a word.  To her apartment, she kept moving.  Answers would be there.  Answers had to be somewhere.  Her apartment was just as she had left it, save a key on the small kitchen table.  Had the table been cleared before? Was it empty when she left? She couldnt remember but she flared with anger at the thought of Sabine clearing it to artfully place a key on it just so.    She walked outside with no coat, no scarf, no hat.  The sun had set and the wind had blown in as it did every evening in every town along  on a coast line.  She walked down the promenade and sat on the bench.  She stared out into the darkness of the black sky melting into the black sea.  She sat there, her mind blank.  It spun for answers no more.            She stood in front of the mirror.  She had bought a magnifying mirror, the kind with the brutal fluorescent lighting surrounding it -- the kind that while helpfully showing you ever pour and crease and hair where a hair should never be, also quickly teaches you to hate yourself.    She stood in front of the mirror.  She saw dark pores and felt revulsion.  She stared and picked and squeezed.  Then hunted for more.  a hair.  was that one darker than it should be? The tweezers.  More pores.  How do they get clogged? Her face was so disgusting, so flawed.  She stretched and searched and pushed on it.  Ten times the magnification showed her all the evils  hidden.  What would thirty times show her? She had seen one of that strength, hadn't she? No dirt, no sweat, no filth could escape her then.  She would see it all.  She would rid herself of it all.    Another hair.  It was short.  Beneath the skin? Just a little.  She scratched it out and went after it with the tweezers.  But she couldn't grasp it; it was too small.  She dug in anyway.  She created a hole where once a barely visible grey dot had been.  Now it was open and red and oozing clear liquid.  She would get it.  It would not mar her further.  But she couldn't and eventually the hair -- there had been one there, right? Retreated in cowardice beneath the pink pulpy exposed spot of flesh.    She searched on.  There were hairs out of line with her brows.  They must go.  A few in the middle? What did people call that -- a mono.  She would not have it.  Out.  Out.  Out! A few longer hairs on the sides of her face near her hair line.  What were those? Sideburns? Disgusting.  She plucked them and pulled them and searched on.    Back to her pores.  Everyone would be cleaned.  Every.  One.  No more dark.  No more dirt.  No more grime.  She would shed her ugliness one purged pore at a time.    She stood back from the mirror and looked at herself without magnification.  Her angry skin was red, swollen.  It did not look angry.  It looked furious, more grotesque than before, distorted, indignant.  She stepped away from the mirror and headed into the shower to scrub and exfoliate anything that she might have possibly missed.            She bought a pair of cowboy boots.  She saw them and they <stirred something in> <gross> her.  They were real leather of worn black color with some light stitching of white thread along the top and at the pointed snubbed toe.  They felt soft in her hands and she rolled them over and over feeling the curve of the leather transition from the shaft to the foot.  She must have been handling them too long, perhaps too thoughtfully, because the store clerk startled her with a startled look of his own.  Did she need help? Would she like to try them on? They were nice, yes? He eyed her purposefully.  They were expensive and she was not looking her most together.  Asshole clerk.     She wanted them.  They felt good, calming.  She wanted them.  She told him to wrap them.  She was taking them.  He hesitated, looked at her steadily, and then shrugged.  It wasn't his store.  What did he care if she bought them with a stolen credit card.  He rung up the five hundred euro boots and put them in a shopper bag with another shrug.  French clerks liked to shrug.  It must be part of their training, she thought.  But she didn't give a fuck.  She and her new boots went home.    She sat on the couch and opened the box.  The box had condensed the smell of the leather.  That most perfect of smells.  Her friend Joana always said that the smell of leather made her think of money.  It made sense to her.  Where they grew up, rich people always had big leather couches and big oversized leather chairs, these in addition to the ubiquitous cow hide rug always made their houses smell entirely of leather.  Her house smelled like green beans.  No matter what her mother was cooking, the house always smelled of green beans.    The smell.  She loved it.  She stuck her face in the shaft of the boot and just sat there smelling in that smell.  It felt good, that smell.  Odd that a smell could make you feel.  But it did and this one was visceral.  She sat there for ages, face in boot, just inhaling over and over again until the smell started to fade.    With an un-understood melancholy she walked into the bathroom and turned on the harsh spotlight of her magnified mirror.  Her face was covered in little specks of black -- leather? thread? boot.  Her face was covered in boot.  She laughed.  She had spent the last hour smelling a shoe.    She washed her face, put on her boots, and wandered out heading vaguely in the direction of the anglo-glot bar.  She hadn't been in quite a long time.            She sat through her graduation ceremony in a haze.  The day was hot.  She had not taken her professor]s advice to wear cotton and the jersey dress under the plastic feeling graduation robe was melting her into a puddle of sweat soaked misery.  Here she was.  This was her grand finale.  She had followed her dreams.  She had graduated.  She had done well.  Her heart wasn't in it.  The pomp around her felt hollow.    She thought of that annoying brat she and Sabine had taken a road trip with to Biarritz.  He was so whiny.  Any time they were discussing the sights around them, the history of the towns they were passing, the politics or history of France, the cultural differences between here and there, then and now, he had groaned.  He was put out the entire trip and had hated them by the end.  One night on the early end of the trip, he had given his great speech -- probably one he had given many times.    You talk of such meaninglessness -- history, politics, economics.  Who cares! It is shit.  It is worthless.  The only thing worth anything in this life is relationships.  That is the only topic that we should discuss ever!   She thought he was an absurd little child.  He must have just been dumped.  What ridiculousness to think only of relationships when there is a world of richness about which to learn and discuss and see and take in.  And now she felt guilty for dismissing him so harshly.  He was a drama queen, yes.  But she looked at herself now.  How easily had her heart taken the shine from her eyes.    Her name was called.  She walked on stage as the dean was listing out her list of talents and quirks, she <vaguely> heard him make a joke about her cowboy boots.  She regained her poise has he announced that she was graduating with <summa cum laude>.   And she smiled out into the auditorium.  How much history and art and culture she had absorbed to take with her on road trips and to dinner parties.     She walked off the stage with her piece of paper and her chunk of engraved glass.  She hadn't found a job in Nice and her student visa ran out at the end of the month.  She had been told that it would be difficult.  It was always difficult to work abroad but this area was especially sought after and the French fiercely protected jobs for their own.  She had been distracted by love and art and all the beautiful things she wanted.  She hadn't really fought for it.  She hadn't networked and interned and begged and camped out in the career office.  She had chosen Sabine instead.  And now she was heading back to the States for the first time in what seemed like a lifetime.     She went to the graduation party smelling of plastic clothing and left smelling of champagne with a fuzzy head and dress in disarray.  She took home a classmate, Eric.  He had always looked at her with that look -- a bit of wonder mixed with a bit of evil.  She kept him up most of the night fucking his French brains out.  She never took her boots off.    He drove her to the airport in the morning.  She was flying out at two o]clock.  She had donated most of her belongings the week before.  She kissed him on the cheek, refused to let him walk her in, and headed into the terminal pulling a single suitcase behind her.            You look like shit.     what?   You look like shit.  People always tell me that I look like shit.  Thats what yore supposed to say.  So I came in here to tell you that you look like shit.    She closed the office  door.    I didnt know you had issues with this stuff.  I hadnt noticed before.  Do you? You do.  I can see.  I dont actually think you look like shit.  But again, its what you are supposed to say.  So Im saying it to you.  Whats goin on with you?   I dont--   So weve never talked about me.  And we can.  Its not really a thing.  Its just one day I decided that I really wanted to be thin.  I like being thin.  I think it looks good and its just really important to me.  And so Im thin now.  Its not a problem.  I just like to be thin.  I dont know if its the same with you.    I-- But thats me.  I see a therapist.  I see a doctor.  Its fine.  Im not allowed to exercise.  At all.  Not even a little bit.  And I cant pick up my children.  But other than that, Im just normal.  Im just thin.  So I dont know if you want to talk about it.  But if you want to you can.  Im not shy.  Im not shy to talk about it.  People think they cant talk about it to me.  It doesnt bother me.  Except, it really bothered me when everyone kept telling Sue how great she looked after she lost all that weight.  That really made me bad.  I was really offended that they just kept saying it and saying right in front of me.  But if you if you want to talk, we can talk.  And you really dont look that bad.  I just wanted to say something.     Thanks.  I appreciate your concern.            She had settled into her new job making very close to zero dollars.  Her coworkers were good people and had become her new circle of friends.  Her old one seemed to have unraveled while she was in France due to life, she guessed.  Marriages and babies and affairs that led to un-marriages.  And her new friends were easy.  They went for beers every Thursday.  They showed up for birthdays and various other big celebrations.  But other than that, they werent terribly in each others daily lives and daily business.  It was frustrating at times but it was mostly nice.  It removed the risk of implosion, the risk of one couple breaking up with another couple because they brought the wrong casserole to the pot luck.  They seemed to be slightly lacking in attachment, but completely void in all that over- dramatic Texas bullshit that crushed her sense of social security.  And so it was nice.  She was in Texas and it was easy and beer- soaked and nice.  She hadnt spoken French since her return.  She hadnt read a French newspaper or French book either.  The local independent book store had a well stocked foreign language section so she had no excuse.  It was on her.  She was allowing her dreams to slip through her fingers and out of her world while she sat still in this life that was easy and nice.    She sat at the bar, their bar, drinking too late on a Thursday night.  A friend walked by, Tara.  They had picked her up along the way at a the St.  Patricks day festival.  On tends to make friends that day.  And Tara was now a regular.  It was nice to have a crew.  Perhaps even nicer to <usurp> one already fully formed.  She had been a rowdy addition that was fun once or twice but would not last long.  This group wasnt that group.  This group was mellow, local, and had their shit together.  Tara -- her shit was still in the wind and she was not interested in gathering it in just yet.  Every night she had another guy in tow.  Every night with said guy in tow she usually spent much of the evening talking about sleeping with the other guys in rotation.  She wondered how well that tactic really worked for Tara.  A stupid thought, she supposed.  Because here she was yet again with another.  Actually, she never saw the same man twice so either it was a good play or there was just an inexhaustible supply of willing males available.    Tara plopped down at the bar and nights accessory sat between them.  He was a coworker, (very brave of her), a scientist, and he was on work visa from France.  Shit.  She hated it to <something soemthing> levels when people played the Oh she lived in France/She speaks French card for her.  Partly because it was embarrassing and partly because she really didnt speak French anymore.  It was like it had fallen out of her head and been replaced with bean dip recipes when she decided to bed down here and forget the past.  Tara and Guy were solidly sticking to the were just friends facade.  It was so silly that she still thought that she needed to protect some sort of image with them or that they gave a shit or that they were that dumb.  But whatever.  Tara was a passing ship.  Better to get good stories out of her in the meantime.    She had escaped to the loo immediately just to breathe and get ready for what was coming, maybe prepare a couple of deflective jokes.  She retook her seat.  So, they told me not to bring up France to you.  What is your problem?   Oh.  Fun.    Why cant I talk about my home country?   Well, guy I just met, you can talk about anything you like.  I dont know what thats about.     You lived in France? A Nice?   I did.    You went to school?   Yes, I did that also.    Where? Which school? The <look up a school in Nice here>   No, The <look up another school in Nice here>   Oh.  Only rich people go to that school.  I hate rich people.  You must be rich, no? Tara said you have a house near her.  So yes, you must be rich.  How much money do you make?   Guy, you are a real charmer.    What?   Nothing.  Im not telling you how much money I make.  Im not rich.  School there was a third as expensive as it is here.  You are really aggressive for talking to someone you dont know.    What other way is there to be? Otherwise conversation is pointless.  A waste of words and breath.  People here they are too concerned.  It is boring.     And while she thought he was somewhat right, she also thought he was an asshole and completely tuned out his rant on social norms and how bored he seemed to always be by everything.  And then she caught out of the corner of her ear what she knew was coming   And why arent we speaking French? Pourquoi parlons- nous pas francais? Tu parles francais, non? Or are you that kind of lazy American who lived in Europe and didnt learn the language?   She muttered the insult or two she knew in French, threw twenty dollars at her friend, and walked out.    <Con> She had never hated someone so much on first meeting before.  What was his French asshole problem? Was she rich? Was she lazy? She may have hated Texan over-politeness, but come the fuck on.  It was all her good Texas training could do to keep from shoving him off his bar stool -- to keep her from turning around, going back into the bar and shoving him off his bar stool.     You know what? Politeness is pointless.  Politeness is a waste of a good storming away.  She spun around on her boot heels and walked back into the bar.  She hoped he knew how to fall </land?>.  Asshole.            Now reach to the floor.  Thats right.  Lift your right leg out toward the back wall while your right arm stretches for the sky.  Thats good, my beautiful yogis.  Thats very good.  Now release your leg back down and twist into a high plank.  Yes, now meet me in downward facing dog.  Yes, my loves, yes.  Very good.  Now, beauties, left leg to the sky and step through to your hands.  Lovely, my lovelies.  Now slowly raise up to warrior one with arms stretched to the ceiling, and bring those hands together and back down into the prayer position.  Gorgeous, my loves.  Im so grateful for your choice to practice here with me today.  Im so very grateful.  Okay, beautiful yogis.  Now twist to your left, bringing your right elbow over your left knee.  Good, good.  Now here you may find it hard to breathe.  You find yourself gasping for air and breathing quickly.  Try to calm your mind.  Youll get there, my beauties.  With time and practice you will get to where you want to go.  Now extend both of those arms.  Good.  Very good.  Now back into prayer, and come back down into a plank.  Remember, its all just energy.  All of it.  You cant control it.  You can just sync up with it and ride it.  And thats all were trying to do here, beautiful yogis.  Were just finding our energy, joining with it, and riding it.  Just like a surfer.  They dont control the waves do they? They cant control when the set will arrive or how big it will be.  A surfer just waits, takes what comes, and rides whats there.  And thats what were doing here today, darlings.  Okay, now <chataranga> and meet me back in downward facing dog.  Oh beautiful yogis, Im just so grateful to be practicing with you today.            Thats right.  Ungrateful kids today.  ungrateful.  Im tired of being around ungrateful people.  People acting like people owe them something.  The world dont owe them nothing.  Nobody owes them nothing.  God gives you everything you need.  Yes he does.  Hes blessin me right now.  Im eighty five years old and hes blessin me.  And thats why Im having a celebration.  Thats right.  Im having a holy celebrations because hes blessing me and I should celebrate it. Im grateful that I get to do his work through the children.  I am grateful for the children and that I am doing his good work.  I know I got a child like mine.  But Im doing his work through God.  Praise Jesus.  People just need to mind their business, thats all.  People need to get out of your business and mind their own.  Its a beautiful day.  Just beautiful.  Dont fool yourself.  Its for me.  God didnt tell nobody in this world to control you.  Its on you.  Thats right.  Its on you.  Now you go out there.  You have a blessed day.  God bless you.  Thats right now.            What? What? Why are you looking at me? So Im in a dress.  So I am.  Dont you think my legs look good in this dress? I look good in heels.  Dont matter.  I look good.  You know who dont look good? Lesbians.  Evil fucking lesbians.  I look way bettern them.  I know who I am.  I am a good lookin man.  Thats what I am.  You know who you are? You got a dollar, Ill tell you who you are.  For five, Ill tell you who you are and where you goin.  I know who I am.  Shit.  You the one who got no soul in you.  How bout that dollar?           Hi.  My coworkers husband died on Friday.  He was active and fit and he had a heart attack out of nowhere  and died at his hockey game.  Its tragic and terrible and I ache for her.     And yes, Im a cliche and in that place.  Life takes unexpected turns.  I dont understand exactly why were not speaking, but this is not how we should be.  We love each other.  Weve been best friends.  If youre mad or disappointed in me can we please fight it out?  I dont want to waste time.  I would regret every day we havent share a jalapeno themed joke with each other if something bad happened.    I miss you.    ~~~   I cant.    We will always be friends.  Even when we're not in contact.  That's a given and you know that.  I apologize.  Its hard for me to explain myself but Ill do my best.    After reading your email awhile back about your boy's ""turn around"" and him ""being the guy you always knew was in there"" I was bit floored.  Well maybe floored isnt the term.  I think exhausted is better.  I had just received the same email at least four times from you in the last 4 years and was just tired.   And just completely baffled that those words were coming out of your mouth.    I've always told you Id support your decisions without judgment as they were yours to make, and well, I love you regardless of anything.  Which is still the case.  Its just the ups and downs, sadness to happiness that you feel - I feel too.  And I guess Im just tired.  I guess I just took the ""if you dont have any thing good to say . . "" approach.    Its difficult to talk to you everyday and not ask about what is going on that is important in your life.  And we both know this boy has run the show with your heart for years.  Whether you admit it or not.  Again, for that, Im not upset.  It is what it is.  Love is hard.  Its not something you can turn off.  Alas, this person has consistently proved that he is not capable of doing it.  Anyone can do a complete ""turn around"".  Its keeping yourself pointed in the right direction for a long period of time that counts.  And this kid does not do that.    I hope that someday Ill be proved wrong and that you both are very happy.  I truly do.  But for now I guess I just need a break from it.  I am your friend forever and I am here whenever you need me.  Just know that my lack of correspondence is not because I don't love you or care.    Im so sorry about your friend's husband.  That is terrible, and yes, indeed sobering.    I hope all else is well with you.  I do love you and always will.              I maybe should have stalked earlier.  He called it Times Scare.    How am I hanging out with this person? Especially, how am I hanging out with this person when I really want to go to the Secret Science Club screening of a NOVA special on asteroids.  (You and Tim have fun. )   I will be bringing you back some really fun stories that go something like this:   Him: So multimillion dollar goldman sachs hedge investment whatzitwhostuffs.  Me: Oh, that's interesting.  So, like, comic book glutens and ghost robot loner pants?             She was in Chelsea.  She was inhaling New York.  The cold air, the mass of people, and culture culture everywhere.  She was feeling ambition and life-fire start to tingle in her body again.  How long had it been since shed felt that.  There was something about the speed.  The ability to do anything any time in this city was reawakening something that she had let hibernate.  What did she desire? Name it and in this city it would be so by nights end.    She was in Chelsea.  There was a gallery tour on her and half of the citys agendas for the day.  A publication had run a piece on the rise of graffiti photography as a sibling art style to actual graffiti art in the city.  Chelsea galleries had filled their walls with just such photography.  And the art  was making the rounds.  And entertainment guide had even drawn up a map of a walking tour.  She was following them intentionally out of order so as not to seem like a tourist, but she still planned to hit every one in the list.    Graffiti art is pretty awesome, she had to admit.  Momentarily trendy with people who would never actually venture to the place where it exists in its natural habitat or not, she liked it and she liked being able to see it in mass.  She was rolling out of her fourth gallery with her second glass of wine -- wine and wander, they called it.  When she  stopped short in front of the windows of the gallery next door.  This gallery was not part of the tour.  It did not house photography.  This gallery was showing paintings this weekend.  She knew that style.     She thought she was going to be sick.  She steadied herself.  She raised herself up, held her head high, and walked in.  She could handle this.    She was prepared to see her work.  She was prepared to tell herself that she was happy that Sabine was well and being prolific.  She was prepared to lie to herself and <say this was fine. > She was not prepared for this.  Everywhere she looked she was herself, her own face.    She saw herself in the cafe with Sabine in mid- profession <of love and commitment>.  She saw herself in Sabines shop looking pained, talking to the owners.  She saw herself in their cafe looking broken, staring off as the owners looked at each other pityingly.  She saw herself through the window of her apartment staring at the table with the lone key.  She was crying on the couch.  She was sitting alone on her bench staring sea- ward.    Sabine had made art.  No, she had staged it.  Their relationship was performance art and these were merely the snapshots of it.    She slowly walked outside, back into the comfortingly cold air, and in a near by bush, threw up and threw up until there was no more overpriced sushi to part with.            She had never met him.  That wasnt true.  She had.  But at a couple of parties.  There had been an introduction or two and then he had always been on the other side of the room with his unhappy girlfriend by his side.  She was beautiful but always tired, always complaining.  not complaining in the mean kind of way but just in the work was long, parking spaces eluded her, life is hard kind of way.  She always looked like a pouting doll -- large eyes always emanating a surprised sadness that life was a constant parade.  But she wasnt unkind, she always told herself, she just lacked perspective and you have to ease up on that sort.  She wondered what kind of a person that made him that he was with her? A care- taker, she guessed.  In her experience she did know boys to love a messy girl, a dramatic girl who needed to be taken care of.  It made her sad for boys.  And it made her distasteful of her own. .    She heard through her best friend that they had split up.  She wanted kids.  He didnt want kids.  They still loved each other.  It was cordial.  She assumed there was more to it than that.  They seemed such a mismatch, but regardless, that was a good reason, possibly the best reason to end a relationship.    A few weeks later he added her to his various social media connections -- first the original mega site, then the social photo site, then the business focused site.  It was unexpected given that they didnt know each other but she assumed he was doing the post break up routine of having more time than usual to browse around and the accompanying thoughts that he should make new friends and pick up new hobbies.    He was a participator but not annoyingly so.  So easily posting and commenting and photoing made you loathe people you once thought were stand up chaps.  But he was smart and adventurous and witty.  She followed him passingly at first and then sought him out.  And he apparently was doing the same.  He acknowledged all of her actions in some way -- commenting, hearting, endorsing, thumbs-upping.  They had sprung a very modern, post- contact friendship.  She felt like they knew each other, liked each other.  But, did they? Its possible that he is exactly this way with every person that he is connected to, she thought.  But it felt personal, or as personal as non- personal interaction can feel, and possibly because they had not hung out, they didnt work together, they didnt have a big overlapping friend circle.  He had nothing to gain by being digitally present.  And neither did she.    And thus a very modern crush was born.  On a boy she did not know.  At all.  She thought about him when she posted a status or a photo.  Would he see it? Would he acknowledge it? A comment seemed like a big event given that he had never made one out loud to her in person.  And she reciprocated.  And she felt ridiculous about it.  She liked many of his postings, but not all of them.  Because that would be too much, too obvious, too -- it was absurd.  She felt embarrassed at even the thought of her behavior of her thoughts of him.  And she did think about him often.  And sometimes she thought about him.  And she hated herself.  What was she doing.    She was planning a trip to his town over the first of the winter holidays.  She would be there for an extended time.  Nine days felt like an extended time these days at least.  How did these things work? Should she try to see him face to face, in real life, in human form? Would the thought even cross his mind? Perhaps she was just a poster of pictures he liked, end of story.  This was the most likely scenario.  She posted a status about an apocalypse survival dream he had.  He liked it.  She social photoed a photo of the outstanding sunset outside her office window.  He liked it.  He commented.  She posted another picture of a knitted, dissected alien that a friend had just sent her for a gift to say thank you in the way one said thank you these days.  Yep.  He liked it.  Maybe? Probably not.  But  maybe?   Swimming in embarrassment she allowed herself to wish and fantasize that some sort of romantic comedy plot would unfold, that he was sitting on the other end of the trucks and tubes looking at his phone and thinking the same thought.  How to let him know she would be there.  Clearly a status.  But ahead of time Im looking forward to  or just as she arrived Its been too long old town.  It all seemed positively ridiculous.  It was the holidays.  He wasnt thinking of her.  And even if he were, he would be with his family or friends or traveling or something.  She had rarely acted like such a girl.    Fuck it.  She would post when she arrived.  She would take no further action.  The electronic window into the lives of others was making her a crazy person.  And she was not a crazy person.  She was the most emotionally stable person she knew.  So back off, mega media.  She was going on a media fast and returning to the socially sane person she once was before this like- a- thon, fantasy faceball nonsense started.    Austin, youre lookin good.  Lets never be apart so long again.    Ding.  Like.  Ding.  Beers this week?   Yesssss.            They had a day of joy and cheer and silliness planned.  First stop, enormous swan paddle boats.  Next stop, the bar on the east side with the bowling lanes and movie clip projections playing everywhere.  This place had skeeball too.  She loved skeeball.  It was a simple game of rolling a ball into a hole, but she didnt care.  She was addicted.  Stop three, superhero night at the dive bar down south.  Traditional heros discouraged, heros made of duct tape and paper plates, highly encouraged.  It was promising to be the best birthday ever.    Swan fest, plus leg burn? Check.  They had paddled and raced and circled each other and played bumper swans.  And got yelled at for playing bumper swans.  And they quickly discovered that paddle swanning was a short lived activity.  But they had solidly earned their beers.  And off they headed to roll balls of various sizes and shapes while drinking drinks of various sizes and colors.    In they walk into the retro 1960 vibe, feeling cooler by proximity to the leather seating alone.  As her eyes adjust to the loungey darkness she sees what her best super friends have done.  They have gathered the crew.  And there is cake.  And there is . .  Crush.  He is sitting there looking exceptionally handsome in the non-online flesh and  smiling at her.      <okay this is boring.  abandon>            She was leaving the Home Depot on the east side of town with the air filter she had come to buy in hand.  She could not have listed the names or uses for any other single product in that enormous warehouse of a retail establishment for hard work and do- it- yourselfness.    She walked through the football field length of the parking lot avoiding the erratic movements of unaware drivers of loaded down trucks and mini vans.  And came to stand on the the street corner near the cross walk to wait for the little blinking man to tell her it was safe to cross.  A man drove up in a low- standing pick up truck.  It was a model that was some where between a truck and an el camino.  She loved el caminos, she thought as she gazed in that direction without much focus.  And then in a wave that startled her into a place of much focus immediately, ten -- maybe twelve, men raced toward the vehicle.  All men, all hispanic, all looking for work.  And some were far too young to be doing so.  And over weight sloppily dressed man in his mid forties lumbered out of the truck and appraised the men like they were livestock lined up at the county fair.  He looked disappointed, almost angrily so and he raised his hands in some sort of a shrug and come on now gesture. He was establishing something, his position among the crowd.  He was the boss and he was telling them this with is posture and disdain And she hated him immediately.  She hated the vibe that was shouting from every pore on his body, his every gesture and expression.    She wished she were handier than her lone air filter.  She wished she had grand home projects in progress so she could leave this man standing there worker-less as she showered the men with appreciation for their knowledge, skills, and willingness.    <blatant liberal crap? yep.  take this out>   He was telling the eager hopeful men that they were too small or too old or too something.  He was preparing to underpay them.  She could feel it in his dismissive statements.  Some of the men peeled off to keep watch for other opportunities.  Some stayed, hopeful, already moving toward the bed of his truck despite the hanging message of low pay and disrespectful treatment.    She was <something -- blank stunned shocked> She had the strange urge to follow him, them.  To keep watch over her fellow humans, to bear witness to what her belly told her was to come.  And so she did.    She followed the sweaty, squatty man and his band of workers through the east side and north to a bothersomely affluent neighborhood.  It was the kind of neighborhood where home owners could afford to pay higher wages for hard labor.  Asshole was the word that rocketed through her mind.    The asshole put the gentlemen to work with gruff instructions and told them to drink from the out door hose if they got thirsty.  Asshole.  And they went to work.  And she went to stalking.    <this is a throw away chapter right? right. >   She saw the unpleasant man come out of his house  an hour later.  The men had been digging a trench around the house.  They were putting in a french drain to help with water accumulation around the house.  It was back breaking work.  They worked intently.  They worked in silence.  He came to to bring them lunch to go with their garden hose water.  And, she nearly, choked, he brought them a bag of tortillas and a bag of tortilla chips to share.  Asshole.  Racist fucking asshole.  She frantically scanned the area.  What could she do? She had to do something.  But what? She was going to barrel into a group of men and do what? She had to think.    And then she decided.  She started the car and drove off, stopping at the grocery store on the way home.    At five in the morning the next day, she was in front of that house again, the french drain fully in place waiting to fulfill its water whisking duties.  She slipped under the front porch and planted a dozen eggs, cracking one.  She did the same under the back of the house, and there she also buried a raw brisket just below the surface of the dirt.  And then she rolled a few eggs under the house in a small crack in the siding, just for good measure.  And then for the finale, she dumped a bottle of liquid ASS along the boards on the side of the house.    Did she know her antics were juvenile? Yes, she did.  Did she feel extremely good about it anyway? She, she did.    She stopped by the Home Depot on the way home and left a big box of breakfast sandwiches and pieces of fruit by the day labor station.  And next to it another box of bottled water.     She had a spectacular rest of the day.            The blind date had been been bad, really bad.  3 rudes to the waiter, 2 semi- racist comments, and 1 holocaust joke that was all too quickly followed by a no- punches- pulled evaluation of her body.  He was a fan.  At least there was that.   Joana sat her down and looked at her seriously.    I guess I am not sure what you want in a partner -- not that I think every date needs to be a potential life partner.  I mean, I know you are not interested in being strung along for years again and youve got your abandonment issues for sure, but do you actually want to find someone to settle down with? a city to settle down in? Do you want a family, kids?  Sometimes you mention such things, but I don't think I have ever been sure.  And I know you well.  Do you know? Are you sure?  I have on occasion been jealous (in a good way) of your freedom to travel and to relocate.  I have never known if you really wanted a partner or if being free to flit the world suited you more.    -   I do want a partner and a home town.  I do like my freedom and to travel and hop around, but I would like to have a home base where I have a bit of community and some friends, and then go travel and have adventures from there with my person.  I do want a person, a travel companion, a partner in crime and silliness.  This seems possible, right? I don't want to move around every 3 years forever.     I don't know.  Does this sound unreasonable? Does this sound like the me that you know? I might like some tough love feedback from you.    LinkedIn sent me an email this morning asking me if I know <assla assface> who works at Some Company.  I swear to the interweb gods.  I do not seek out this girl but social media just dumps her on my doorstep and in my inbox constantly.    - Your wants make perfect sense to me.  They seem like you And yes, it is reasonable that you can both hop around and still have a home base.  That sounds ideal.  One piece of advice:  don't get a dog.     I do envy you.  You know, I realized today that I have six more days of vacation than I thought.  And I really dont think I have the time to take it.  Ill loose it at the end of the year.    - I will not allow this.  Were getting on a plane right now.  We can buy underwear when we get there.            The holiday party.  She had been looking forward to it for a month.  Her entire group at work had been talking about it.  the company had been in such dire financial shape that it had been canceled for the past several years.  Shed never experienced one in person.  And so she had made a game of it.  She and the boys from production were all wearing bowties.  The girls were dressing as wrapped packages and candy canes.  She loved it.  She loved festiveness.  She loved celebration.  And most of all, she loved people willing to make fools of themselves for the sake of silly fun.  Because why not.  She could wear a black dress any day.  A fake girl- tuxedo for no reason was a much better choice.    Her coworkers were good people-- smart and odd as all the best people are.  The party would feature a homemade karaoke machine (made from a macbook of course), a homemade photo booth (made from another macbook of course),  pin the candle on the menorah, and some sort of secret white elephant exchange thing.   Normally she would cringe at such things, but there was no cool happening here.  It was all joy.  And where most other workers in the machine would expect to take home a singing crab placard to be held onto for no reason other than next years exchange, she would no doubt open a gift containing something she had never seen before.    And she did.    Helen, renowned knitter and company stitch- and- bitch lead yarn spinner, had made something for her.  She had knitted an alien-- an alien that was mid- dissection,  splayed open and pinned to a frame with his entrails exposed to the world.  She had knitted little alien organs.  She had never received anything so work- intensive and sweet  and super fucking disturbing.  This thing was so disturbing that it could not live in her house.  She had just received the new office mascot, please let it never leave these walls.  Various other items of oddity made their appearance but she was the clear winner-- if winner was the right word.    The party worked.  Everyone was rejuvenated and filled with camaraderie as well as much, much mocking material.  Really? You really thought it was a good idea to sing every R.  Kelly song in the playlist? Yeah, that was going to be go for a very long time.  But as usual, the party only served as an appetizer.  Those with children and spouses and respectable lives went home like responsible adults.  The non- responsible adults had just begun to feel it.  Stage two -- holiday festivities out in the world for those brave enough.    And it got delightfully ugly fast.  Zack got wobbly far too early.  He was a leaner.  He would drink with out an off switch, to the point he could no longer stand, but that did not stop him from trying.  Or more accurately he just outsourced the responsibility to the rest of his companions in drink and revelry.  She was that companion.  Boys were heavy.  She had done her tour as leaning post.  An hour was enough, was it not? She offloaded the responsibility to a larger guy from the art department.  Take him.  Please.  And she headed out to feel the cold air.  Cold air was always cleansing and she needed to be cleansed of the weight of the intoxicated.    Back at the bar, a sweet young girl who was interning for the fall rolled up to her, eyes glassy and words jumbling together occasionally but at least she was still vertical of her own strength.  She rolled up, YOU!   Happy non-descript winter holidays, Em.  Having fun.    So much fun! So  tell me everything about you.  Are you dating anyone?   Its complicated.  What about you?, she said, knowing this was the destination they were headed from the start.    Ugh.  Well, Im in love with my roommate.  Im trying not to be.  He likes me as a friend.  But I cant help it.  I just love him.    Thats really tough, Em.  Im sorry.  Living with your crush seems like a bad idea, dont you think? You should save your love energy for a guy who recognizes the shining little star that you are, babe.    Yeah.  I know.  I know.  But I am saving my self  in a way.  Im actually a virgin.    What? No way.  How old are you?   Twenty four.    You are not twenty four and a virgin.  Are you really?   Yeah.  I mean, its not religious or anything.  I just want to save something for the man I really, really love, you know? I mean, its not like I dont hook up.  I do.  Ive had tons of anal.  Just you know, no sex- sex.    She sat there and just stared at her.  Just stared.  She would have tried to hide the expression that was going along with her gut reaction to this, but she could have no reaction.  Just the staring.    You know, I mean, I just wanted to save something.  And anal is great.  You just need tons of lube and to go real slow.    Yeah  so you know youve totally had sex right? But instead of having a normal conversation with your future husband about the previous number of partners youve had, you are going to have to say the words: Youre the first in my vagina, but Ive had TONS of anal.  And this is better?    She tried really hard not to think of young girls doing this as a way of hating their bodys.  Ill have sex that I will call non- sex, and thats okay because I wont enjoy it.  What must this girls one night stands be like? Because she had heard this girl talk about having one night stands.  Actually, she heard her talking about period sex on one night stands.  Sigh.  Why did people think this conversation was okay to have at work? This girl had scarred her.  She needed the cleansing of the cold air again.  And she had only had a few sips.    She had taken in her cold breaths and was trying to shake off this new knowledge that she would never, ever shake off.  She pushed back in the door to see what other adventures were waiting for her in the further of the evening.    Hey, can you help? Ryan just broke his ankle.  He broke it  walking.  He was attempting to go to the bathroom or some other death- defying feat.    Jesus.  What is it with the holidays.  Yeah.  Where is he? Ill call a cab.              She was out for the night.  It was combo birthday night with her best friend Joana and her man of the week.  They were dressed like girls who are out for their birthdays.  For her that meant showering and getting out of jeans for once.  And in Texas this was a rare thing in general.  They were dressed up in a sea of cargo shorts and flip flops.  Often this made her self- conscious but not tonight.  Tonight she was with her people and it was time to laugh and eat up all the joy in the world.    They took good care of her, the best care really.  Always.  Whenever life took a turn, they were there with queso and wine and a mountain of hugs.  She was lucky.  She knew it.  And they were doing it again.  Another break- up, another night out on the town spoiling her face off and making her feel loved.  Who had friends like that? Almost no one.  She was lucky.  She knew it.    The took her to the new most- lauded restaurant in town opened by a famous chef that she wouldnt know but others knew.  And others were impressed.  She knew the food would be good.  It would be tiny.  And therefore she would be drunk.  She cursed herself for not sneaking a hamburger before they went off.  But this was okay.  Joanas mister would drive them to a drive- thru for french fries when they needed it later.  They always needed it later.  And he always took care.  She was lucky.  She knew it.    Three courses of cartoonishly small portions and two glass of wine later, they were tipsy; they were happy; and they were all trying to pretend like they werent still hungry.  But onward! Ho! To the new French bar where all the stylish locals went trying to be stylish or actually being stylish.  There was always a mix and it was always impressive in a classic european kind of way.  More wine! More celebrating life and friendship! She was lucky.  She knew it.  They were getting out of the cab in front of their destination of fabulousness when Joana turned to her.  Oh.  I forgot to tell you.  I texted him in the cab ten minutes ago.  Hes stopping by for drinks.  Just to say hi.  I didnt tell him you were here.    They did always take care of her.    Where they would normally belly up to the bar, here, they glided and sat with straight classy backs like classy folks did having classy conversation.  That was a lie.  They never had classy conversation.  It was her favorite thing about being with her familyfriends.  It was all dirty jokes and high fives about those dirty jokes -- cocktail dresses or no cocktail dresses.  There would probably be a joke about cocktail dresses any moment now.  With the third glass of wine in hand, she was beginning to get a little sillier and a little fuzzier, but no fuzz could have stopped her from instantly noticing his very handsome entrance and him stopping short and him smiling at the sight of her.    Happy birthday to me.    They really did take good care of her.  She was lucky.  She knew it.            He called and asked her to spend the day together hanging out, starting with brunch and coffee and just see where the day progressed.  She was in.  She was excited and took entirely too long staring at her closet and eventually choosing the t shirt she knew she would pick.  It was the one she always wore.  At least she had a look?   And there he was, early, looking handsome.  She dropped herself into the chair opposite him and the day began with a surprising flow for two people who didnt know each other well.  But it was easy.  He had thought of an itinerary, he had made an actual itinerary and shared it with her.  She pulled out her phone and thumbed through it.  It was witty and it was packed with things shed love to do any day of the week.  Before the day was even rolling, she was hooked.  Effort worked every time.  She knew she was a goner.    They walked along the trail by the river before the day got to hot.  Then they went to an old jazz bar with ping pong and shuffle board and old tables with built in scrabble boards.  They played everything.  And then they moved on to an improv show in the early evening.  It was the worst comedy she had ever seen.  And that was fantastic.  Night had fallen and the mood changed.  They had been having fun all day and now it was dating hour.  She guessed they were on a date? It was always so hard to tell.  The rolled into an easy restaurant for burgers and beers.  They laughed for an hour replaying the comedy show.  And then rewriting it.  It had been the perfect day.    She got up to stop through the wash room before they called it a day.  On her way out, he was on his way into the adjacent mens wash room.  She looked at him and smiled.  All hopped up on beer and beef, she grabbed him by the shirt collar and spun him facing her as she backed herself against the wall, and pulled him into their first kiss.  It was pretty epic as far as bathroom hallway kisses went.  She was pleased.  And the amused smile on his face told her that he was as well.    They spend the next ten minutes making out in the corner of the restaurant.  And then making out in front of the restaurant.  They were being the worst spectacle that two people could be.  But this would not cross her mind until later.  At that moment, nothing was crossing her mind at all.  It was a complete blank.  All she could think was that she wanted her mouth on his pretty mouth.  That mouth.  She loved that mouth -- soft full lips with playful teeth behind.  The left corner always turned up betraying his amusement when he tried to hide it.  They proceeded to make out in the cab and on the side walk and up the stairs and all the way into his bedroom.    She woke up to an empty bed and the smell of bacon and coffee wafting in from the other room.  She was a happy girl.  She wondered if that hallway move would work a second time.            The past few month had been altering.  She was happy.  She was having fun.  She was letting life be and it was good.  They went out and saw bands.  They went hiking.  They jumped out of a plane.  They stayed home and wrote together.  They made videos of silly things and pretty things and sometimes of dirty things.    He was fun.  And he liked to do things.  It was so nice to be around someone who liked to do more than just watch television.  The did projects constantly.  Do you want to do Bob Ross paintings? Yes.  Do you want to learn how to waltz? Yes.  Do you want to build our own skateboards and then ride them down Piney Pass to celebrate with our new go- pros? Definitely, absolutely, right now, yes.  He was fun.  It was fun.  All was fun.    They had plans to go to Guatemala the following month.  There was an area where you could camp near a lake and somehow get massages and meals and internet access in the lodge to the north end.  He had asked her to go with him to spend the next weekend with his family.  It was a casual thing that carried none of the usual ridiculous weight of that scenario, and she liked the ease of it.    They had spent Sunday afternoon catching up on back episodes of Saturday Night Live.  She loved their Sunday morning tradition of Saturday Night Live and then brunch and then the crossword, maybe spend an hour or two on the latest project.  And after they would meet up with their friends.  It had quickly become her favorite day.  It was a perfect day.  The past few weeks they had not been able to get themselves out of bed.  They were tireless in their physical infatuation with each other.  And that had not eased up at all.  He told her everyday, your body is a wonderland.  And while it was a line, it was a good one.  And it seemed to be true.  And so when they finally had fucked each other senseless, they were ravenous and S N L had been postponed and postponed again for the most enjoyable of reasons.  Had she mentioned she was happy?   They were reaching the fake news portion of the previous weeks episode (her favorite part) when he got a phone call.  It was work.  They had a project launching the next day with a fussy client.  There might be a problem.  Could he come in? Flattery was abused, comp hours were promised, and so he broke away from their Sacred Sunday to head to the office.  He promised to be back for dinner and dessert -- wink wink -- and drug her to the door with him kissing and kissing and not letting go until he had to let go.  She smiled as she closed his door behind him and walked on the trail of clouds back to the couch to sit in her underwear and read.  She was sad he had to leave, but It was going to be a lovely Sunday anyway.    She squished into the couch, novel held to her heart when she noticed the stack of journals on the floor.  Were they always there or was he cleaning out his old high school heart pourings? Oooh, she thought.  Boyfriends high school angst.  This is going to be amazing.  She cast her novel aside for a much more entertaining hour and snatched up the top journal.  She closed her eyes, prayed the first words she read would be Dear Diary and opened to random page.    <date month, date day, date year.  No.  A month ago? He wrote in a journal now.  She looked more closely at the journals.  They had years written on them.  And they were the last eight years.  Boyfriend wrote in a journal.  And he wrote a lot.  She was disappointed that she was not going to have fodder to mercilessly mock him with when he returned.  And before she put the journal back, she decided to flip to the page after their epically beautiful date night with their best friends.  It was so a night of drinks and laughs and the best sex they or probably any two people have ever had.  It was amazing.  She felt warm just remembering the night.  It couldnt hurt to read how amazing he thought it was.  And then she would read no more.    But he didnt mention how amazing he thought it was.    Im frustrated with her again.  I wish things were better with us.  I think shes just not like me.  She almost seems like shes just going along with the projects, not like she really cares about them, not like being artistic and creative is part of her soul, like she needs it to feel alive.  We have fun, sure.  But sometimes I think the sex is what keeps us together.  I dont think she has an artistic vision for her life.  I dont even know what her goals are.  Sometimes when were painting I wonder if shes just doing it for me, to make me happy.  But what does she want.  Sometimes I just look at her across the room and my heart feels repulsed.  My body is always attracted, but her being just slides off my heart.    What.  The fuck.    I had dinner with L last week.  I guess im sexually attracted to her.  She just seems more like me.  She has to be an artist or shell die.  I have a crush on her.   L said that she seemed nice but like she was a different sort of person than me.  I think shes right.  No one will ever be R.  R is the only one Ill ever love, of course.  Thats my life.  I love travel and art and R.  Thats it.  Its just nice to have a girlfriend.  Its nice to have someone to do things with.  And we have fun and theres always something fun coming up on the calendar.  But shes not that fun.  But.  Its just not right.  Were just not right.  Sometimes things are great but sometimes I loathe her.  I dont care about her friends.  Id rather do anything than spend time with her family.  But its nice to have a girlfriend.  So I guess well just see.  I should end things.  But well see.  I really want to go to Guatemala next month, so maybe after that.    She wasnt sure how long she sat there just staring at the open pages.  She flipped back a few pages and forward a few pages, but it was all the same.  He had crushes on everyone else, anyone who was unattainable.  And her  he didnt love.  At all.  He constantly bemoaned his fate of having her.  He was all melancholy and discontent in print.  Who was this person? The person she had been dating had been so--- She thought they were so good together, so rarely peaceful and easy.  They were perfect.  Her newly built world came crashing down around her so fast she couldnt process it, couldnt cry, couldnt blink.    She left the journal open on the coffee table.  Yeah, she was openly telling him that she had read his journal.  Fuck it.  Fuck him.  She didnt care, couldnt care, couldnt think.  She grabbed her bag and her keys and walked out of his apartment in her underwear.  There is no way she could have operated a pair of pants.              She called Joana and heave- cried at her.  She couldnt form sentences.  She couldnt make the words come out.  Couldnt explain.  She just ached and all that would come out was unfiltered emotion, pain.  And Joana let her and cried with her and for the life of her couldnt figure out what she could do this time to take care of her and make it better.  She picked her up and brought her to their house and kept her there for three days.  And for three days, they got her out of bed and put a cup of coffee in her hand.  And then they talked and they hugged her.  And then they let her nap.  They got her up and put food in front of her and a glass of wine in her hand.  And then they put her to bed again.    On that third day, she took the cup of coffee and decided that this was the last of her wallowing.  She knew what to do.            the cab driver was late.  she knew better than to use technology rather than talking to live person when time was important.  she was not good at not being anxious.  he finally arrived thirty minutes late.  not late by normal going- places standards but very late when that going- place is the airport.  She was a mountain of stress.  she hated feeling this way but she was a nervous traveler.  arrive early, travel is easy.  arrive late, travel is the most stressful day of your life.  there were dealines and you had to depend on others to meet those deadlines.  she didn't like this combination.  the driver then-- what was he doing? driving in circles.  he was taking his time.  or he just didn't know where he was going.  or he just was not good at his job.  but she knew not to complain, not point out the time, not to mention that she needed to catch a flight.  cab drivers owned this town.  and no one got anywhere without them.  he could kick her out.  he could drive her far out of town and dump her.  and then where would she be? dependent on the kindness of other drivers, if any passed by and if any of the kind variety were to be found personal cars had been outlawed ten years ago.  They were deemed to dangerous.  Accidents had risen sharply.  Cars had become more automated to increase safety, but people had gotten lazy.  They had taken advantage of the increased autopilot features to dress and groom and work in the car.  There were podcasts and video channels broadcast while personalities commuted or drove cross country.  People did crazy things, and all of these crazy things were being recorded and broadcast to the world.  There was the woman who <something something>.  There was the all road head porn channel.  There was that group of teenagers whose band only performed in vechical.  They took out a bus of elementary school gymnasts on the way to a competition.  This was the end signal.  The autopilot still needed a human but humans had abdicated their role.  Humans needed to be busy.  she thought she'd read that in a science magazine somewhere -- humans needed to be engaged.  It was hardwired in their brains.  So when humans weren't engaged, they found something else to engage in.  <The wonders and troubles of our brains, she thought. > After cars were taken off the roads, motorcycles and other scooters went next.  These were deemed safer but suddenly the roads were flooded with an avalanche of individual machines.  It was a mess.  And why risk it? The League of Concerned Parents were the ring leaders.  Their impassioned pleas to congress, the constant screenings of the gruesome videos, the heart wrenching stories of children lost or left motherless.  Public pressure was huge.  Urban megacities fared okay.  They had subways and lightrails in place.  They immediately became over crowded even with the increase of cars and frequency.  But people could still get where they needed to go.  Remote work became the norm.  The government required companies to allow for it and provided incentives.  Who could get to work if it was not within walking distance? And the streets were unsafe, so keep the people home! Smaller cities and towns without the infrastructure suffered.  The government started a national project to set up city run city- wide access to the interconnection network.  Special concessions were made for labors on these projects.  They traveled by ultrabusses driven by highly educated, highly skilled, and most of all highly paid drivers.  This is probably were the idea took hold.  Exclusivity had crippled the country.  There was a huge opportunity.  For once, it started in the small towns -- towns where building autotrains were not feasible, too expensive, or just didn't make sense.  Permission was secured from the government and training schools cropped up.  These schools were military grade with ivy leage exclusivity.  Only a few vechicles were allowed in towns and they were highly sought after.  People paid for service, for preference.  Drivers quickly recognized their place in the new world hierachy and demanded more for emergencies or special occasions.  Car services became the new small town mob.  Within a year or two, subways and trains fell to attacks, sabotage, domestic bombs.  The big city heavy hitters were not going to miss out.  With politicians bribed or blackmailed, it was a rather easy and swift take over.  It was masterful, really.  A swell of fear in the people can so easily turn into control by the few.  And here they were.  She mentally calculated how much he could inflate the price before she'd have to get out and walk.  She kept a smile on her face and admiration in her voice.  She'd found this worked best.  Never ever show displeasure with the system.  This was the best system.  Be grateful for the system.  Feed the system.  She'd spent the first year like everyone else -- baffled that this had come to be.  Confused every time it happened, slowly realizing that it would happen every time.  Extortion.  She spent the next year wearing out a pair of walking shoes.  Bicycles had all but disappeared from existence.  They were stolen or destroyed -- sometimes while porting a rider.  It was unsafe.  She stayed put.  It was the tactic of many.  Stay home.  Stay within your immediate.  Stay in fear.  And then she became angry.  How was she trapped? How was she only able to visit far away friends over videoconnect? This was wrong.  There was growing dissent among the people.  They felt caged.  She felt caged.  Travel was unsafe.  The Government flooded the connectlines with stay- at- home propganda.  The world was unsafe.  They could protect them in their homes.  They cared.  This is why they trained and provided their transporters.  Because they cared about protecting them.  And protect them they did in their armored cars with armored tires that housed a back end remineincent of a steel box with seats.  It protected the riders from outside attacks, attempts at communte jackers, restisters to the system.  But it also protected the transporters from the riders and gave him the ability to lock them in and keep them locked in until authorities could arrive -- or until unofficial authorities could arrive.  This latter case was the most prevailent now.  And the transport authorities were almost always compromised, so it did not matter much.  She never traveled alone for the obvious reasons.  but sometimes traveling in groups did not discourage the most vile of transporters from doing their most vile.  She knew the risks.  She trained everyday.  She was fast and strong and knew every week point on the human body.  A group of resistors also held self defense classes.  These included classes on mechanics, lock picking, and general connect tech training at the local Home Depot.  These were often called ""stenciling borders in your kitchen!"" or ""planting the right vegetables for summer!"" In areas with large resistor pockets, ""lawncare and you"" would teach you how to hotwire a transport vehical.  She had learned a lot about lawncare in the past year.  She would not be caught unaware again.  She had been in a group transport to a farm an hour out of the city.  It was a montly and much needed trek.  Local establishments ran out of fresh food quickly.  Rooftop farms were doing their best but their patronage had grown times ten.  People could not cook regularly for themselves without home farms and few had the land or money for it.  There was a couple behind her.  They were so loud.  She knew at the time that they weren't that loud but they had those voices.  The ones that rang out, carried, and embedded themselves in your brain.  They echoed in the transport and breached even her two earphone system with noise canceling built in.  How were they so loud.  And didn't they realize that everyone was captive to their bellowing laughter, baby talk, and bleating curses and foul descriptions.  It was painful.  But the trip was only an hour.  You could endure anything for an hour.  And fresh vegetables were on the other end.  Her body was crying out for food that didn't come from a can.  Apparently she wasn't the only person bothered.  The driver had been . . .  listening? That was odd.  He could shut them out.  There was steel between them and he communicated rarely and then only through the sound system.  Had he been listening and just decided that he hated them? Or  The car came to a screeching halt.  He flew from the front armed and angry.  He pulled both of them from the back and had them lie on the ground where he assaulted them.  He continually kicked on in the belly and ribs holding his stun gun at the other making her watch.  He then stunned the man so he couldn't writhe.  He just had to lie there paralyzed unable to react to his pain.  And he had to be in so much pain.  Each breath must have been blinding.  He turned his attention to the woman, calling her an insufferable hyena, kicked her once in the soft of her stomach and then stunned her too.  He returned to the vehicle to climb back in, thought better of it, returned to the back and thought better of it.  He screamed at the remaining passengers to shut the fuck up that he would not tolerate and more distractions to his mission.  A drive to the country is a mission now? He should have known better.  He did know better but he was visibly upset but the violence he had just witnessed and couldn't help himself.  And then she was alone in the transport.  He made eye contact.  And do you have any suggestions or comments you'd like provide in response to my service? No.  What? No, sir.  I thank you for your service.  You serve our country and our people.  We grateful.  Thank you for your kind feedback.  My employer will be glad to hear that.  And I will be sure and note that you are a worthy recipient of our selfless service to man.  Unlike these ingrates.  You are welcome back in my transport anytime, dear lady.  And with an upturned right corner of his mouth, he turned his gun on her.  It was some time during the next week, after all the residual effects of the stun had worn off.  After the rubbery feeling of her limbs and the sluggish response of her muscles, the twitch in her eye, laziness in her tongue had dissipated.  It was when she was feeling more anger than pain and the bruise on her face was had begun to shift toward the yellow/green section of the color spectrum, that she decided to throw herself  wholly into lawncare education.  She had heard such work was stress reducing in these troubled times.     <salve for her wounded soul>   <there was seriously a video about beautiful people being discriminated against so they struck out to find other places (ny) where they could find other beautiful people like them.  there has got to be something there. >       It was her first date in ages, and her first blind date ever.  She had low expectations.  Low expectations were the key to happiness.  She'd read that somewhere.  She didn't actually have low expectations.  She was hopeful.  Why couldn't a friend of a friend be a good one or at least a good time or a good reminder.  Damnit.  Her low expectations were being replaced with hopefulness and wishful thinking.            She was riding through the streets of Nice on a <some bike name here> she had rented.  She didnt know why she had decided this was proper salve for her wounded soul.  Speed, wind, concentration on not Sabine, on not France, on not whatever the fuck had just happened to her life.  She just wanted to fly away and this was the closest thing she could think of and still make her exams.  Just fast.  Faster The winding road between Nice and the border of Italy stretched out before her.  It was gorgeous land.  The lush verdant cliff side, the sharp drop to the water on her right side, the technicolor blue water stretching out forever.  It occupied all her senses and was the first thing that had made her feel better.  Not that she felt better.  She was fucked in the mind and shattered in her chest.  It would take a lot to out- pace these feelings of loss and the undoing of life.    The day was gorgeous to match the ry, to amplify it.  She sat on the bike in an out turn taking in the surroundings.  The sky was bright blue, the kind of blue that makes you feel that you are looking at the world through a photo filter with the saturation and vibrance <cranked way up>.  It was too blue, too bright, too <something something>.  The wind was blowing at the perfect level.  Enough to keep you cool in the sun but not so chilling as to force you to stand in it.  She had heard that the area flooded the the waters with an algae to create the deep, soulful turquoise color to increase tourism.  She had researched and discovered that was not even remotely true.  But standing there, looking at the perfect water, she started to doubt it again.  There was much life in the air.  The birds must be on the move.  The hills were also impossibly green from recent rains.  Her senses were overwhelmed, this was making her feel more not less.  She needed to move again.  She needed the speed, focus, and assaulting winds.  She mounted again and fled the spot of still beauty.    She sped along at speeds shed not before dared.  Where was she going? Anywhere, as long as she got nowhere as fast as she could.  She was finally interrupted by a small village 20 minutes outside of the border of Italy.  It was small but sported a few lights along the coastal road.  She stopped, staring reproachfully at the glowing red light, when she suddenly flew forward off the bike and landed on her hands and knees on the ground as the bike fell over in the other direction.   Going into defensive mode she jumped up quickly to see what car had hit her and to get out of the way of it or any other danger on the road.  She was shocked to see that her assailant was not a tiny euro car at all, but a person.  And this person was straddling her rented escape bike, turning the key over and over.  She was first stunned that someone had knocked her to the pavement, then confused that the person who had knocked her to the pavement was trying to steal her bike yet didnt know how to operated one, and then all of her pain and frustration over Sabine volcanoed to the surface.  She launched over the fallen bike and lunged into the mans chest, powering him down.  She was shaking him, screaming unintelligibly at him, and as she drew back to throw her her very first punch at the struggling man pinned beneath her, a van screeched up to the light and three grey uniformed men jumped out yelling,  Arrete arrete arrete! Stop! No!   Jolted out of her dazed ferocity she looked down at the man and then inward at herself.  What the fuck was she doing? The men flew at them, removing her from on top of him, and dragging him into the car.     He had fled a hospital near by.  He was trying to escape.  He was trying to get anywhere else and be anyone else.  She burst into body spasming sobs.            She had been back in Texas for <this specific amount of time that makes sense>.            I am responsible in all things.  In most things.  And yet I cannot floss.  I floss for several days in a row, sometimes maybe a week, and then its like I forget that flossing exists.  Why would this be when I spend most of my waking hours concerned with my health -- diet, exercise, vitamins, water intake, am I drinking too much coffee (yes), am I getting the right about of sleep for optimum brain function? I am absurd.  And yet, flossing -- you vex me.    Every time while I am making my gums bleed after I realize I havent been flossing, I think this takes no time and I kind of like this and ohgod the floss smells dentist said that means death! And yet, 4 days tops and Im a walking warning sign for the gum disease known as gingivitis.  I paid thousands for my perfect teeth -- the fake ones that replaced the originals that were broken out during a beautiful life moment frolicking in the surf with my 4 year old niece.  I can see my gum lines receding.  I can see it.  I dont want that.  I dont want to lose my teeth, real or counterfeit.  So why, why brain?    Is it because you kind of like that feeling after the first floss of a stretch? You know the one.  Your teeth feel a little loose and you grind just a little.  It feels good.  I admit it.  It feels a little like doing drugs.  Is that feeling of lying in bed grinding just a bit remind you of the good (terrible) old days of fun and freedom? Could my inability to floss be linked to the grind/drug/lost teeth dreams that I have due to the sensation?    That cant be it.  Because that would be fucking stupid.  It would be better if I just started casually doing drugs again.  I live in NYC for oral hygienes sake and then at least I wouldnt be toothless at 40.  I dont think youre ever going to see that look at fashion week.    So I was at Whole Foods yesterday and saw floss.  I need floss.  I need to floss.  I brought the kind that cost ten times what it should, because, you know, Im at whole foods.  Because this will inspire me -- or more accurately make me feel guilty and obligated.  Its got xylitol! I dont know what that means, but the bold lettering implies that its way better than whatever death-causing things are in your regular mainstream floss, you asshole.  (Organic floss is really aggressive. ) Lets do this.    I should probably set an inspiring yet slightly shaming daily google calendar reminder, shouldnt I? Okay, NOW lets do this.            Fuck, massages are nice.  I cant believe he lives to do this.  And for hours.  And he volunteers.  So good.  So good.  I wish this would last.  I wish he would last.  I wish there were all this and love.  Stop it.  Just be present.  This feels so nice.  Hell never really love me.  Not in the way that feels right to me.  Hell never look at me that way.  That way she used to look at me.  The way she used to talk to me.  Be present.  Just be present.  Did I finish that script for work? I did.  I should probably test more.  Im lazy with testing.  How are you thinking about work right now.  Be present.  I shouldnt have gone to my exs post.  I cant believe shes getting married.  Of course shes getting married.  I cant believe after all these years of not that I want to get married.  My back -- focus on the amazing feeling in my back right now.  Fuck her and her cheating.  Her marriage will be a farce.  Stop.  Be present.  This boy knows how to use his hands.  Being married to the wrong person would be a miserable life.  It would make you a miserable person.  Be present.  Calm your brain.  Sometimes I miss being part of the gay community.  Its crazy though.  The supreme court better do the right thing.  Focus here.  Focus now.  Be present.  Why does he want all of my time and attention when he doesnt want me.  How do people pass time like that.  Technically I am passing time exactly like that.  Why am I not just moving on.  Im an idiot.  Stop.  It.  Be present now.  I need to call my mom.  Ack.  Be present.  Everything is fine.  Youre just being casual and enjoying his company and the fun and the killer massages.  It doesnt have to mean everything.  Be present.  Shake it out of your head.  I have so much to do before I leave for California.  I should start packing.  What suitcase should I bring.  I hate roller bags.  I need to bring my roller bag.  That knot in my shoulder blade kills.  How does he find them all.  Be present.  Enjoy this now.  I cant forget to submit my prescription.  I should get detergent while Im there.  I hate making the pharmacist ring up toilet paper when I pick up my medicine.  They must think I cant believe I went to 8 years of school to be a cashier.  Ill pick up the meds first, then buy detergent.  And toothpaste.  Travel-sized? Will that last me 3 weeks? Probably not.  But I could buy more once Im there.  Then Id just have to pack it home.  I should just take a normal size.  Be present.  Be here.  Seriously.  That cheese made my stomach hurt.  My stomach is gross.  I need to work out more.  I hate feeling gross.  Pilates tomorrow for sure.  Shh.  Be present.  That guy.  In your alter-ego town.  He looks at you that way.  That way youve always wanted this boy to look at you.  But no.  You love this idiot.  This idiot that is rocking the shit out of your shoulders.  God thats good.  And painful.  But so good.  What would that other alter-ego life be like.  Youd hate him.  Youd hate him for loving you.  Youd hate him for not measuring up to this level of attraction.  Be present be present be present.  I wonder if I am incapable of wanting someone who wants me back.  Im stupid.  BE PRESENT.  Quiet your mind.  I am attracted to this one.  That is his hand up my inner thigh.  Exhale.  My body freaks out when he is near.  My mind blanks.  My ever-spiraling crazy mind blanks.  Love? Lust? Suddenly not giving a fuck.  Just want to pull his body on top of my body.  Cant think.  Ill just be present.            It was a first date and an epic one at that.  Twelve hours of togetherness, twelve hours of constant talk, twelve hours of never running out of things to say.  Well, with the exception of their hour of shared silence, but that was intentional and perhaps a good litmus evaluation of a few things.  She could not abide people who could not sit, who could not just sit with their own thoughts, without talking talking talking.  Which always said validate me, pay attention to me, whats on the inside is terrifying.  It was rare to be able to sit in silence, so very rare.  they closed down the bar.  They had to be asked to leave.  They had to be asked twice.  They walked down the road in front of the restaurant heading toward the car.  They had parked as far as was possible to park and she was glad for it.  Despite the rain and the cold, they walked slowly, searching for words to wrap up this unexplainable day.  What words properly summarize, properly benedict the end of so many words that came before.     He stepped up for an attempt at it.  So, this project youre working on? The one where you have to say yes to everything? When does this project start? Do you think a person could get away with exploiting this?   I dont know.  I suppose a person could try.    He paused.  Can I kiss you?   Yes.    He unzipped his jacket and stepped closer to her.  She stepped forward in return and looked up at him.  He slid one hand into her coat, around her back, and pulled her into him.  He looked at her, smiled, and then leaned her into her.  <something else here>  The kisses were slow and light and teasing.  They were very intentional and connected.  He moved backward to lean against the car and pulled her forward shifting her across his left leg and running his hands up to her ribcage, gripping her tightly.  Kissing her more intensely, he ran his hands up to her throat, holding her head back and kissing her neck.  She shook in his hands feeling warm and out of control.  He brought her back down with smaller, softer kisses and then took her hands and leaned away, smiling at her, at them.    As the moment <something something - softened? waned? shifted out of>, they realized that they were drenched and standing in the pouring winter rain.  They flew into the car and shook uncontrollably for less romantic reasons.  She leaned back in the car seat and looked at him.  Totally worth the flu this will give both of us, she thought.    You only have one first kiss, he said.  And I hope it was memorable with me.    She kept looking at him silently, shaking from the freezing hold.  Yes.  Definitely worth it.              <something something> the throw from the diamond whispers and my heart like a head in sand and your arms on a cartoon tiger a little lie lost in your bed with your boots tapping country western your roots showing through again how your mouth makes the sound of the city now but your hearts still spewing southern twang the song of the morning threshes and the sun to come to paint it all warm <something all something> i can almost hear your heart unravel i can almost feel us getting old with the night full of starlight laughter how we fall through the <something> air see our breath hang in clouds above us see our words disappear there   sad old sun, send another one who <rode> and rambled you away holdin on till another one comes <when will it> may   sorrow the only sign of weakness as our eyes closes on our knees its the kick that gets us down its this gracelessness we need its the monster in our many closets its the demon in the rough in our stack of a thousand needles its the one thing that really cuts and its the turn of the screw that binds us and its our throats tightening slow its the fear, the fear of nothing its the first throes of letting go   sad old sun, heres another one the sigh and sing it anyway when the song is sung, well sing another one as long as were <made>   how your eyes were the <depths?> beauties and your tongue like a silver snake how i stood round your fires gazing how i trembled at the sight of your shape its the dew that beads in your lashes in the soft soft air and our hands under covers moving and the scent of your salted hair its the autumn in your iris its the chill setting in how i feel just like those leaves in freefall all just pawns to the wind   sad old sun, send another one the road will ramble you away same old song, come on sing along as long as you may           <what happened that got us to the point where she knows she has to go? i cant remember.  pull that back in and change this section to match>   She hadnt talked to him in the past few weeks.  Couple of weeks? Handful of weeks? She couldnt remember.  He was constantly trying to get in contact with her.  She read his impassioned messages and listened to his imploring voicemails the first week, but after that she had started leaving them unopened.  He had been so heartfelt in his pleas.  He had sent her lists of the reasons he loved her, written her songs, asked her to come back, to listen.  But she felt numb.  His words meant so little now.  Who could recover from reading such divergent words from where she thought they stood? Who could recover from reading that she was a way to pass the time and so clearly not even a small place in his heart.  What was that bullshit.  She vowed to never waste another minute.  He wasnt going to love her.  He just sought the sense of longing something from afar.  What a wasted life he would have.    She had spent the first few days, wallowing in stunned processing.  It was so hard to believe at first.  And then she started to replay their time together.  Maybe it wasnt so perfect in hindsight? She didnt know.  And it didnt matter.  She shook out of it one day.  She had been on a path for a dream life and had been conquering those goals one after another.  And then stalled.  And then what.  She had just  nothing.  Shed been having fun in a place she didnt fully belong or maybe she belonged but she didnt feel fully comfortable.  Maybe she would one day, but many adventures needed to be checked off her checklist before she was ready to settle in to slower and more comfortable.    She spent the next two weeks selling most of her belongings.  She rented a storage unit and saved those items she felt a fondness for or needed to hold on to for sentimental reasons -- books, gifts, her grandmothers stemware that she would never use, mostly books though.  She canceled the lease on her apartment and paid the fine for ending their contract early.    She was standing outside of her sisters big suburban house looking up at it, considering it and all that it held, when two overly energetic girls came racing out, throwing themselves at her.  Her sister walked out behind them with a knowing smile.  As the kids fought- talked over each other, her sister approached her slowly and gave her a hug squeezing her for a long time.  She took her face in her hands and looked at her for a moment.  Good for you.  Get out of here.    They hugged one last time.  She threw the cookies the kids had baked her for the road into the passenger seat of the car on top of the pile of French language study books.  She got in, queued up the first of her language study programs -- Advanced French Intro (Conversational), and then she set her navigation to Montreal, city centre and headed out of the suburbs.              She had a friend visiting from Texas.  He was someone shed known since undergrad.  He was kind of an asshole, no one else really liked him, but she always had.  He was smart and interesting and did not give in to the rules of southern politeness for a second.  She always respected that, even when it made a person a bit unpleasant at times.  He was traveling through Nice on his way to the Czech Republic.  He was going to visit his girlfriends family.  Or he was traveling and using my residence and theirs as excuses and free places to stay.  Somehow he had gotten a beautiful, sweet Czech girlfriend.  Everyone was baffled but she was happy for him.  She liked her so much and she had been happy to have a little international light in their friend group.  And now she was happy to have a little bit of home abroad.  You had days where you needed to feel like you were not an outsider.  It passed, but little moments became important <rich, blech, something> and reenergizing.  She took him down the main promenade and up through the <placa> filled with open air restaurants and shops with their sell ables out front.  They caught up, they told familiar jokes, they got into an enormous argument about religion.  It was just like old times, it was just like home.  It was interesting out a thing could feel so far behind you and exactly right at the same time.  And she still stood firm that morality could exist in the world without religion.  That was just crazy talk.    So after he told her that he could only date women that were conservative, traditional, were women who needed him to provide for them -- not like her, he could never be with someone like her.  They both agreed that he was kind of a dick and headed off for the bar.    It was an anglo bar that was sort of cheating on the cultural front, but she didnt care.  She liked it.  It was easy.  And someone who no doubt go on an anti- US government rant and her conservative friend would be in debating heaven.  It was the perfect place for him, really.  They hung out together over their first beer, staying mostly to themselves, and then began to mingle.  He started up a pool game with a scottish bloke, and she hung at the bar talking to a man from London.  He was overly friendly and very handsome.  She was into both of these qualities in him, so she decided to linger.  She told him she was here with her buddy and needed to collect him soon.  He offered to buy a round, which is exactly the way to get included into a new group of drinkers.    She went to grab some seats at the picnic table style benches, her friend returned, and so did the Londoner with a tray of three drinks, two beers and some sort of pink horrid girlie concoction in a glass that looked like it would tip over at the slightest breeze.  Thinking she was hilarious, she grabbed the second beer and made her friend suffer through the drink that looked like drag queen threw up.  Her new friend looked surprised.  Yeah, I do not drink things that color.  Seriously, friend.  They laughed and swapped stories of living in France.  They finished their drinks and headed to the pool table for a game of <what is the name of a three person pool game?>.    She woke up groggily, feeling terrible.  She was in her bed, naked, and there was some pounding.  What was that pounding.  The door? Who would be at the door? You cant even get into the building without a key.  She wrapped the sheet around herself and shuffled in pain to the door.  And there on the other side was her friend from Texas.  She had never been more confused.     What the fuck happened to you?   Wait.  What? I dont   What happened.  I looked up and you were gone.    I left? I left you at the bar? When? Wait.  What?   Yeah, asshole.  First you made out with that guy for a while.  And then I looked up and you were gone.  I stayed at the bar until they kicked me out.  I tried to get a hotel room because I didnt know where you lived, but no one would give me a room at four in the morning.  I finally wandered along the water until I saw what looked like your street.  I started banging on the door downstairs and screaming at eight oclock until someone let me in.  And then Ive been banging out here for two hours.  You seriously didnt hear me?   No.  I dont.  I dont remember anything.  Jesus.  I feel sick.  Im going to be sick.  She went to vomit in the sink and had to step over a broken jar of peanut butter on the way.  What happened there.    I dont.  Im sorry.  I have to go back to sleep.  Im sorry.    She woke up at six in the evening, which was remarkable for a girl who could never sleep in.  She snuck out for hangover food and returned to make up.  But she did not expect him to take her groveling.  There is no way she would have.  They sat at the table staring at each other for a few minutes, picking at their croissants.    So.  I.  Im so sorry.  I must have had too much to drink?   Yeah you must have.  Fuck.  Seriously.   but when did you do shots at the bar or something?   No.  I  we didnt drink at dinner, right? Then we had that first beer.  Then that guy bought us a round.  And then  I dont remember anything.  Its like a curtain fell down on the night.  Its just black from sitting at the table on.    Oh fuck.  That dude drugged you.  I knew he looked weird when you didnt come back from the bathroom.  We kept playing pool for a little while.  And he just looked  not surprised.     No way.  That cant be.  But  I do only remember the two drinks.  Did you see me drink more?   No.  Just those two and then your face was on his face so you didnt really have the time.    I made out with him? Super.  Friend, Im so sorry.  I dont remember anything.    No, it makes sense now.  I have done G H B for fun.  And thats pretty much how it goes.  Theres a singular moment when it all goes black and you dont remember anything.    Why would that be fun? Sorry.  Different conversation.  I am fucking blown away right now.  I mean, I am proud that my body went into protective mode and made me flee the situation.  Im shocked that I made it home in piece that fucked up.  And I cannot believe that I left my friend in a bar.  In France.  I left my friend in a bar in France.  That is so fucked up.  Im so glad youre okay.  Im just.  Im so sorry.    I know.  I know.  Im glad youre okay.  And all that shit.  Lets just leave it.  Buy me a pizza, yeah? Im tired as shit and Im hungover and France is pissing me off.    Fair enough.  Im really sorry.    I know.    Im really really so sorry.    I know.  Shut the fuck up.  Pizza.    Pizza.  Yeah.            MORE WORDS.    Okay.  So i need to write words.  I need to write so many words.  I need to brain dump.  That above story went pretty well.  It does not fit in terrible well.  but thats okay.  well bring it in.  it will work.  this entire thing is just an exercise in how i can vomit words and then editing SO MUCH EDITING will make it not the worst shit in the entire word.  i like editing better anyway.  then you get to choose pretty words and make it pretty and witty and more interest.  and good god to you need to work on that dont tell, show thing.  jesus.  this is the worst offender of that ever.  and you are totally cheating right now.  BUT.  the fact that you are going to have to replace ALL of that summary style writing with actually acting it out means that this thing will be twice if not three times as long once, you take this shizen out and add in the other stuff.  so youre good.  she says to herself to make her feel better.  okay you have to go to the christmas store with your family right now on black friday.  it will be the worsst thing ever.  steel self.    ---- ----   I lied when I said that we should break up because we werent in love.  What I meant and was afraid to say was because you werent in love.  Youve never cared for being told how you feel and saying that out loud felt too sad.    I know what I mean when I say love is different than what you mean.  I mean openness and affection and care.  Youve twisted it to mean something nebulous and unattainable -- something to withhold for self-protection and control under the guise of purity of concept.  Here were going with my definition.    I loved you.  I loved your from early on when I was so surprised and moved by the little things in the mail and in google documents.  Its stupid that I never told you.  I tell everyone else.  I loved you for your initial effort and your dedicated selfishness and for the adventurous short-attention span life that we could have and for that face.  Im not sure how I feel now.  Love warps with lack of care and reciprocation into unpleasant jealous and needful versions of itself.    But you didnt love me back.  That was what was wrong.  That was always what was wrong.  I knew from the beginning.  And this awareness made me shrink.  Who I was wasnt loved so I retreated to hide her -- this person who was unloveable.  Distance improves clarity and it is strange to me that I behaved that way or that I continued trying to win in a place that was never pulling for me.    Im not sure what the point of this is.  Possibly to give some structure to our breakup.  One should be careful of loneliness masked as missing and romanticism cloaked as longing.  I regret not telling you that I cared.  I regret not telling you that I wasnt getting what I needed.  I regret not standing tall and proud and full of self, regardless of how your felt.  After all, I was never really a contender in your garden of ghosts and left-open doors to the past.  Had I behaved differently, things may have ended just the same but perhaps there would be less frustration , confusion, annoyance mixed in with the parting sadness.      ---- ----   i was walking home from a disappointing night out in nashville.  i had been certain that i would run out of time to see it all.  I had imagined sauntering bar to bar listening to old men play old country at every stop, my heart swelling with every lyric of a broken man or a good woman, my cheeks tear-streaked from the soulful heart-pourings of prairie-hardened men.  in reality the section of town to which i had been directed was bourbon street gone country -- in too many cases gone 80s cock rock.  the drunken sartorially-challenged gorillas stumbling about even sported the sequined hats and beads of mardi gras colors for some reason.  it was september.  and it broke my unswollen heart.    so back i strolled enjoying the night.  i walked up behind two men on a street corner.  one was probably the drunkest man in the world.  the other, id say he ranked around 4th drunkest.  they were not-so-slightly swaying from the nights revelries.  the drunkest man in the world looked up and his eyes went round.  Hi.  Whats your name? Youre pretty.  I want to hold your hand.  Can I hold your hand? i was particularly amused by this boy.  i think it was his absurd level of intoxication, that drunkenness brought out the sweetiepie romantic in him, and that i could probably knock him over with an unstable thought.  at this point drunkests friend decided to be my shining knight, my protector, the self-appointed savior of my night and virtue.    exaggeratedly aghast, he pulled his friend away Dude, stop it.  Im sorry maam.  My friend has had a little too much to drink tonight.  Were from Detroit.  its okay.  its fine.  looks like you guys had a great night.  i walked on amused, possibly enjoying that i wouldnt be leaving the this legendary town without human interaction after all.    they continue their wobble home behind me.   Dude.  Dude.  But I just want to talk to her, you know? I mean, look at her ass.  I just want to touch it.  Dude! Stop it.  You cannot touch her.  But just look at it.  Isnt that a great ass.  Admit it.  It is It is.  But you cant touch her.  Leave her alone.  But i want to touch it.  I want to touch it so bad.    i was trying really hard to not hugesmile at this amazingly self-esteem boosting conversation, when drunkest boy decided to make a run for it.  it being my ass.  he broke away from fourth drunkests  grasp on his arm and made a running lunge -- or more like staggering forward somewhat-reaching motion -- at my backside.  The drunkard universe was not on his side and his flailing hand missed its mark.  fourth drunkest pulled him away.  Dude! What are you doing?! You cannot touch her! Im so sorry, maam.  Hes harmless.  Im so sorry.  Ill keep him in line.  Its fine, really.    again i resumed my entertaining walk toward the hotel.  drunkenness was hilarious in this harmless, puppy dog moony form.  drunkest could not quit his mission.  he made another running attempt at me, again missing, and almost going down because of the momentum of his swinging ass-grabber.  again, fourth, with a great show of chivalrous horror, pulled him away.  an argument about the quality of my ass and its touchability ensued.  i was swallowing my laughter with all my energy.    then the point arrived that sadly always does.  fourth, frustrated with Drunkests behavior and refusal to listen to knightly instruction, pushed him into a city planter.  anger finally flared in drunkest and he launched himself at his friend.  he swung the first punch.  and missed.  completely.  fourth then swung back.  and missed.  after four non-connecting punches they resorted to tackling with more success.  they went down to the sidewalk and sloppy, whiskey-weak wrestling began.     i fought the urge to stay and watch this play out.  i  really wanted to see the final  where they realize neither of them have a fight in them and that they are laying on the sidewalk in the middle of nashville, tennessee -- and hopefully laugh? but as i seemed to be the feather that set off the trigger of this little theater, i chose to walk away.     i headed to my hotel bar rather than my room.  nashville had turned out to be entertaining after all and i was suddenly  up for another act.    ---- ----   I too was thrilled when the Nicer Stuff trends began.  Beer that was interesting.  Cocktails with odd history.  Wine illuminated the difference.  Foods that never should have shared a plate but blew your mind.  Hailing from a land where food choices varied only among shades of brown and drinking anything but budweiser warranted a beatdown, I could not have been more excited.      I ate foods never imagined and learned odd tricks of chefs from far away lands.  I drank cocktails mixed of ingredients other than sugar and colored sugar.  I drank beers brewed with care by a guy who lived in town, whose passions were printed directly on the label (designed by his sister).  We had fun.    Then it changed.  Slowly at first.  A friend refusing to eat here.  A friend going without rather than drink a merlot there.  And then you all became wholly intolerable.     What once made for fun gastronomic adventures and lighthearted forays into fanciness planted a dark seed.  And nurturing this with just the right mixture of artisanal whiskey and locally sourced goat heart tartare, you have turned into unendurable snobs, irrationally rigid trend-sumers, and harrowingly boring conversationalists.    Eating frog livers is your new passion and only interest? You send back your sazeracs when the lemon rind is not singed just so? You complain through an entire outing that your beer is served in the wrong style of glass? You cut off my stories of good humor to interject,     You ate there?     The service was atrocious.  Well never go back.     That place couldnt make a decent French 75 to save its license.  You gape incredulously that I would eat at that restaurant -- the one my niece chose for her birthday dinner and called begging me to go.  When she turned 6.    Might I mention how recently you drank brandless beer from a bong? Everclear from an ice luge? That I have seen you eat pizza that has fallen on the sidewalk.  Twice.  That I have squired you to the Whataburger drive-through more times that I can count.  And that drink you love? In the NYT annual top cocktail list? You thought it tasted like diesel last year. .    And so you have driven me away.   I love to eat, to drink, to be merry.  But I loathe your company.  And so I retreat back to my taco joint -- the one that will never be discovered as a hidden gem, the one that sells average-tasting, run of the middle-american mill tacos.   Because the conversation is delightful.     ---- ----           She sat on the wall taking in the sprawling sea of orange below her.  On game days, the town was awash in team spirit.  Perhaps not just on game days, during sporting season.  Which was most of the time.  This was a sport town.  Everyone had a team.  Everyone cared about the prevailing of their team to the point of fist- to- cuffs once a few beers were in play.  It was a fascinating cultural phenomenon.  She watched the  flow back and forth.  There was screaming.  There was wooing -- which was not so different than screaming.  There were high fives and back slaps.  There were orange clothes -- some made in tiny child sizes so that full grown women could show team spirit.  The enthusiasm seemed to come in waves.  Woo! Drinkdrink.  Woo! The sun was dropping in the sky, giving the clouds a highlight quite similar to the human ground cover below.  The first crack in the camaraderie showed.  To now, everyone had been on the same team -- their choice of shirts had proved it.  But a man, that man right there had stepped backward into another man who was holding three beers at the time.  They spilled.  And this was enough to turn the team mates, the co-cheerleaders, into opponents.  First came the shouting.  Then came a curse thrown in one direction and then thrown back.  The curse caused the shove.  And then the shove caused the first punch.  It did not connect but the intention sufficed and fist was throw from the other side.  A few friends came to help.  This made the skirmish swell rather than retreat.  And the ripples radiated outward.  Once seed of aggression was enough to temper the homogenous jubilance of the crowd.  Additional scuffles did not immediately break out, but revelers now eyed other revelers.  Fans looked around casually now in self-awareness rather than in search of someone to toast.  She hopped from the wall and walked away.            She had a date.  She had met her in the bar the night before.  It was loud and she had been drunk, but she definitely had a date.  This detail she had not forgotten.  And with an exhalation of relief, she had gotten confirmation on the walk to the meeting spot.  See you in a short few.  It had read.  She was trying not to be excited.  They had kissed.  They had drunk kissed.  Okay, they had sloppy drunk bar made out.  She did not care.  She needed a sloppy drunk bar make out.  This was possibly the only option allowed to her by her psyche at the present time.  She had agreed to another round -- a date, possibly ending the same or ending further down the naked line of progression.  It was distraction and she was all about distraction.    Walking down the road, dressed for the night out, she was checking herself.  She reapplied chapstick and popped a breath mint.  A girl should be prepared.  A woman drove up in a mid model peugeot.  She pulled over and rolled down her window.  Hi, she said.  Hi  she said back.  Wait.  Was this the same woman? She  did not recognize her.  But, this was her, yes? Of course it was.  She was drunk.  Of course this was her, How embarrassing.     Do you want to get in?  Sure.  Thanks for picking me up on the way.  How are you?   Yes.  I am well.   So, we shall go to my place, then yes?   Oh.  Okay.  I thought we would have dinner first.    Dinner.  You want dinner? I thought we would get together.  Begin.    Well, we dont have to.  I just thought  ?   What is your name? How long have you been in Nice?   What? Wait.  Youre not Holly?    No.     Shitshitshit.    She opened the door and bailed out of the strangers car immediately.  The stranger who thought she was a prostitute.  How did that just happen.  Oh yes, she thought.  She drank too much.    She power walked away from the  and toward the meeting spot she and Holly had chosen.  She was there just as she said she would be, leaning against a post.    Bon soir.  Im so sorry I was late.  I got lost momentarily.  Im so sorry.    Non non.  Cest bon.  I was late aussi.  I have only now just arrived.  So dinner, yes? Je suis si faim.  Do you hunger for italian or seafood? I think fish.    Whatever you wish.  I am hungry too.  Lets go, yes?   They sat at the restaurant and ordered.  The wine came and began to calm her nerves and round her edges as it always tended to do.  The appetizer arrived and they dove in.  The food was good.  Thank goodness the food is good, Holly said.  I was about to ask to leave.  There are Armenians at the table by the window.  I hate Armenians.  They are a disgusting people.  Thank goodness they are finishing up.  I cannot be in the same room.  Disgusting.    She sighed so audibly that Holly stopped her diatribe.  But only momentary.  She paused long enough to realize her dates disapproval and took this as fuel to double down.  Haters do love to convince others to hate, dont they.  She threw back her glass of wine and ordered the rest of the bottle.              i keep thinking of this article that was posted and passed around and made women raise their fists and say hey yeah! it was half about lazy character development and half about the detrimental social impact of such lazy character development.  it was about manic pixie girls.  it was about stories and movies who follow that boy who is lost until he finds that magical girl who saves him through her lust for life and deep wisdom.  she always looks amazing.  she always says the insightful, inspiring thing that makes him say whoa and look at the world through different eyes.  she is not a person, she is a mythical creature whose only purpose is to Save Boy and turn him into the man he is clearly meant to be.    now that it has been pointed out, i see it everywhere.  i see it in every movie trailer and in every book i read.  the synopsis of 90% of media could be Lost Boy Saved by Angel Girl.  and i think i am most disturbed by how much i see it in myself.    im a saver.  im sensitive and empathetic.  i hug.  i comfort.  i advise.  i focus on others because it is the caring thing to do.  i dont know that i take joy in it.  i enjoy being nice to people and making them feel good, yes.  but i think i also expect the Lost to write me into their story as the do-gooder love-interest.  afterall, in the movie, the Saved Boy eventually realizes the Savior Girl has not only helped his life but holds his heart.    and this is crap.  because the piece is right.  boys -- people -- expect this.  they are entitled to this.  they read the books and watch the movies.  they can fuck up and be self-absorbed and the Girl will appear and finally make everything make sense.  she will make him finally want to change his ways.  she will give him a feeling that encompasses all things, all parts of his life -- work, family, friends, life enjoyment will all be fixed without work on his part.  she will inspire.  she will challenge.  she will motivate.  she will be all good.  but.  what the movies leave out is that she is a person.  she has a life.  no ones purpose is to inspire YOU.  she has a life and goals and dreams.  remember? she is not perfect because she is human.  just like him.  she has bad days at work -- and she actually works.  she has bad hair days and bad self-esteem days.  just like him.  and this is so very disappointing.  because where is she, this perfect girl who is to be my muse?    and now i sit.  still i have fleeting compulsions to fix his shit, to point out where his logic is so flawed, to show him where the cracks are.  cracks that exist in him, not me.  why does my brain do this? all fixing and saving should be focused on me and my life.  he does not see his narcissism, nor will he ever.  he continues to seek his perfect saving pixie.  and i do not want to play this role.  i dont even want a supporting role.  but still my mind spins and spirals.  with time and distraction, this will lessen.  but i hope to remain mindful of this.  of my own contribution to this phenomenon.  and engineers expect fewer mythical creatures in their lives.  remember this when the next one doesnt write or paint or play guitar.        The wind howled like she had never heard it before.  It sounded feral, wild, vicious.  The walls groaned against the unfamiliar force.  Windows shook in fear and uncertainty.  And she sat there looking out.  She watched pieces of trash and life fly by that should not be flying by, that should be too heavy and too properly grounded to be flying by.  It was unsettling.  She had never felt so unsettled.  Everything felt wrong, unstable.  The others in the house were in the interior, paying little attention to the swirl outside.  She could not look away.    In the common room they were playing music, making sounds that did not sounds like music, but rather a surreal 1960 science fiction sound track to the climatic madness in front of her.  She had a notebook in her lap for something, she was not quite sure what, but she could not break her gaze from this monster.    She decided to climb to the roof.  The door opened up to an eerie silence for sleepless city.  All human and mechanical sounds were <some adj> silent.  Nature was taking her stand this night.     She knew being rooftop was probably not wise, but how could she not feel this on her body.  She ventured out and let the wind knock her around for a bit.  It was fearsome.  It was invigorating to feel such a force, an invisible force capable of completely gusting its way with her, a force that could trump her force unexpectedly with no notice.    Back in the safetly of the door way, she looked across the city.  A semi- spherical neon green glow swelled the size of a small building  and receded within seconds.  And section by section, the city fell dark to match its quiet.            She was puttering around her sisters house.  She had been babysitting the girls while they went out.  They almost never went out.  The classic fears were so often true.  She was wandering around the television slash/ game slash/ junk room, looking for some way to be helpful or something to do besides raid a fully stocked refrigerator, such a rarity in her world.    She started browsing through the closet, filled with old games, many from their childhood.  She remembered spending so many summer days playing cards and monopoly and rumicube and sorry and legos and licoln logs.  She wondered if her nieces played these relics or if they were video game only kids.  There was a box of old odds and ends and dolls or parts of dolls.  There were tapes and cds and various other relics of the digital rebellion.  And then she saw a dvd labeled <hometown homefries>.  This is what she and her sister had called the version of themselves that had existed when they were small, when they lived in that small country town place.  It was easier to talk of themselves as different incarnations rather understand how they could have been that then and this now.  She smiled and grabbed it.  She had found her evening adventure.    She popped it in the machine that the kids used to play Barbie vs.  Alien (or whatever those little weirdlets played).  And up popped an image of herself at a very small age.  She was sitting on the couch with her sister and they were  being interviewed by their father? Yes.  Her sister must have converted old tapes when she did her big house clean up.  Her sister had inherited all the family memorabilia as she had been constantly been spouting her plans for a nomadic lifestyle.    He asked the classic question that all adults asked youngsters: what do you want to be when you grow up.  My sister said farmer -- both funny and very odd in hindsight.  She did love animals as a little one.  Now she did not have a house full.  Though she did have kids, and that totally counted.  And then she went back to playing with the two dolls that she was holding.  And then her father asked her, weetheart, what do you want to be when you grow up?   Little tiny version of her answered, I want to invent new food.  I want to take junk food and make it healthy for you so it still tastes like junk food but you dont get big.  Like, chicken fingers but that are healthy like vegetables.  I think it would be dots that you take and you sprinkle all over junk food and then you could still eat the junk food but you would be super really healthy.  And then I would get get super rich and super famous for inventing the dots that make everyone able to eat junk food.    And what would you do once you were rich and famous?   I would run away so no one could find me.    Really? Why is that? Where would you go?   So no one would bug me! But I would invite friends and family.  You could come, daddy.  I would build a biiiiiig mansion but I would hide it in a mountain so no one could find it.  And you would have to know the secret code to find it.  And then I would have to let you in.  And then once you were inside I would have only junk food! and slides.  I would have slides everywhere.  There would be water beds in the bed rooms and when you wanted to you could push a button and a slide would open up.  But it would be a different slide every time.  Like sometimes it would be a curly cue slide and some times it would just go straight down or it would go like this back and forth and back and forth or sometimes it would go like really high and then back down again and then up real high and then down again.  And then there would be a cabinet where when you opened it any food you wanted would be in there.  it would just magically know and it would be there and it would be delicious.  it would have a big yard.  like really really big, it would be like ten hundred yards and my friends could come over and we would play in it all the time.  And there would be a pool.  There would be ten pools! and they would have slides and super tall slides and water spray jet things.  And there would be dolphins in the pools that would play with us.  And we would play chase with the dolphins and have swimming obstacle courses.  And sometimes I would chase them with swimming bicycles.  And they would be my friends.    That is quite ambitious.  If there were a good reason to try to become famous playing with dolphins in your own obstacle course pool is definitely one of the best ones.    I know! And you can come! It will be sooooo fun.    You had better get working on that junk food dots idea.    What?   The dots that make junk food healthy?   Yeah! Then everything will taste so good!     She sat there for a minute a little stunned, a little amused at the spastic, ambitious little homefry.  That was a good plan, she thought.  She smiled at her hometown homefry heart.        She drove down the endless stretch of asphalt, the land to both sides was barren and dusty.  It was not charred but it looked as if it were.  It existed in the constant appearance of post- burn <raze? word for burn to ground>.  It too stretched out forever on both sides, morose and desolate.  She had never felt the land else where like she did here.  It felts so  lonely to her.     She hadnt been back in a decade, maybe more.  It felt different now.  She had hated it so much when she had been trapped here.  The lifeless <ugliness> was the perfect backdrop for the place that had only felt like ignorant judgement as a child.  Even so young, she knew the hate made no sense.  She had wanted out so desperately.  And now that she was no longer held here in this place, she could see the melancholy draw of it.  It was land forever.  It was ugly, but nothingness has always been attractive to some part of the soul, the part that flinches when the first building goes up to mar a wash of green in the distance.    New eyes.  She had a different perspective now.  She had seen the world.  She had seen everything.  And now she saw this again freshly.  It was not fresh.  After the expanse of pump jacks and mesquite, there came rough neck land, miles of oil field equipment manufacturers and warehouses.  This was where the pipes and drill bits were made that kept this entire region alive.  And then eventually there was an explosion of chain stores and restaurants that inevitably come on the opposite side of town, so the rough necks who make it and move up to operator have a place to go, have a place to go on the opposite of where they were.    She was drawn to ghost town style feel of this <another word for dusty> industrial sub town.  Her father had asked her to be careful.  She had made a joke in response.  Some word play to tell him that he was being silly for worrying.  He laughed, like he always did.  But then followed up with stories of how oil field workers toiled long hours and drove oversized trucks.  They were tired.  He said people died every day on these roads now.  Then it wasnt so funny.    She saw this all with new eyes.  She stopped to take photos of the foreverness, to take video of the slow cyclical movement of a pump jack, to take a snap shot of a barbed wire fence to post somewhere to show her northern friends.  She had a sudden uncomfortable awareness of herself, in aviator glasses, a beanie, skinny jeans taking photos with an expensive camera along the side of the road.  These were not sights.  These were the labors of men.  Men who worked harder than she would ever work.  She had a flash of recognition.     Her friends always said I dont understand Republicanism.  How do people become Republican? She thought she might be seeing it now.  The popular face of this industry was the fat, bald man in the two thousand dollar suit who made billions of dollars a year while killing baby seals and storks on the side.  But she was looking at the heart of the industry right now.  Dust, rust, grit.  Men who work too hard in one hundred and fifteen degree summer heat, going home dirty and sun burnt hoping to be foreman one day or operator.  Hoping to be one of them.  One day they might wear that suit and not have to wash their hands over and over and over again before being allowed in their own homes.     Her heart felt heavy.  She felt a kinship to this land she hadnt expected, to its hardships.  She had had different hardships.  They didnt quite compare, but she still thought this land changed you.  In one way or another.  This day, she didnt want it to end for a reason she could not quite place.  She wanted to just sit and stare at it, absorb it.  After so many years of blocking out this place, of making a joke of it, exaggerating it for laughs and sympathy, of compartmentalizing it in a way she didnt have to process, she wanted to remember it as it really was or as it was now.  Perhaps both.

1,0,"   1    Jebediah had a secret.   It was a weight, really.  Something the songs of church service couldnt lighten.  Even daily prayers and Scripture reading were no help.  It was always present.  Always hidden.   It is Gelassenheit, his father had said.  Surrendering yourself for others.   So Jeb bore the weight.  It was Gods will.  Like Abraham tying Isaac to the altar.  We hold the knife with the faith that God will stop us from using it.   With a groan, Jebediah pushed his way out of bed.  Beside him, Sarah sighed and rolled his direction.  Even with the passage of decades, she still appeared as beautiful to him as when they married.  A day twenty years ago now.  She in a simple white dress and kapp.  He in his best black suit.  Family and friends, similarly attired.  A simpler time.  A happier time.  An early spring.   Before the secret had passed to him.   Is it morning so soon? she whispered.   Jeb smiled.  Ya, it is.   She made to get out of bed, but Jeb frowned and held out a hand.  Stay in, he said.  At forty, youve earned a few more minutes.   She put the back of her hand over her mouth and yawned.  So much to do today.  The Troyers need breakfast.  And Eli will need help with that baby.  And the garden.   Jeb glanced out the bedroom window.  The sun had not yet begun to rise.  And neither moon.  Only a few distant stars and the mass of what was commonly called the Morning Nebbit.   Still very dark.  That was a comfort, at least.   Jebs yesterday pants were hung on a hook near the window.  Next to those, his white shirt.  He brought down the pants and slowly slid them on.  The Troyers can wait a few more minutes, he said, smiling.  And Eli will be fine.  That child isnt a jahrling, after all.  Not a newborn.  He fought the shirt over his shoulders, and watched as his wife again tried to rise.  He shook his head and placed a hand on her forearm.  Stay in, my sweet.  For me.  Just today.   With a sniff, she lowered herself back into the covers, watching him.  You are too good to me.  Perhaps you should rest more, as well.   Turning back to the wall, he fished his black hat off another hook.  Placed it on his head.  The cows never wait, he said, forcing a smile.  But maybe after.   From the bedroom he walked into the living room.  He felt around near the door for the tin container of matches.  Finding it, he brought one out and struck it on the doorframe.  It burst into light.  Two strides from where he stood was a small end table with an oil lamp, which he lit.  Smiled.   Though small compared to some in the community, the living room seemed large to him.  The floor was solid wood, as was the long table that dominated the far side of the room.  The chairs had all been hung on wall hooks, of course.  There was a large oval mat before the front door and a potbellied stove on the other side near the corner.   Also near the door were the large tin milk cans.  These he gathered in either hand, and after adjusting his hat, he opened the door and walked out onto the porch.   Forty feet beyond was the shadow of the barn.  Already he could hear the cattle start to low with impatience.  Their udders were full, in need of delivery.   On the way, he studied the sky.  It was something his father had trained him to do.  The bright northern twins were where they always were, to his right, hanging a dozen degrees over the northern pasture.  The David and Goliath constellation stood high over the barn, the Velvet Goose flew to their left.  And the Morning Nebbit was overheadan amorphous clump of stars, a haze of light.  Thousands of stars, hed been told.  The enormity of that notion vexed him.  He tried not to linger on it.   Just like the secret.   He entered the barn and lit more lamps.  To the left was the milking stall, a small wood-walled pen, complete with the new metal head brace the blacksmith had crafted for him.  Behind that, the bins of stored grain.  Overhead on both sides were lofts.  Alfalfa on one side, straw on the other.  To his right was the row of horse stalls, and behind that, the cow pen.  There was a large back door that allowed the cows to come and go as they pleased during fair weather.   Less frequently now than before, it seemed.  They too, sensed something was amiss.   The horses were awake.  They stood at attention, watching his every move.  Hoping that food would come their way soon.  Which it would, after the milking.   Jeb spread alfalfa in the feed trough at the end of the milking stall and went back to gather the first animal.  He tried not to look at the place where the secret was buried.  It all but called out to him this morning though.  It hurt his gut even to think about it.  He didnt want a change.  Didnt want anything to end.  There would be repercussions.   He led the cow, Clara, into the milking stall, and guiding her head through the brace, secured her.  Smoothed her back and neck.   Perhaps he should get a youngling involved? Pass the secret on to him? The penalties would be less severe  Jeb shook his head, patted the cow on the head.  No.  A man lives for his responsibilities.  It is part of the Ordnung.  The rules the community lived by.   He found his milking stool and a clean bucket.  Slid both next to the cow.  He took a seat and rubbed his hands together.  Blew into them a couple of times.  Admired the cows dark side.  The largeness of the animal.  The weight of it.  And the hooves.  He slowly reached out for the nearest udders.  Dont you kick this morning, Clara.  Im not in the mood.   As if in response, the animal gave a clipped Mawk.  Stamped a back foot.   Jeb frowned.  Began his work.  Milk spattered in the bucket.   When the time came, the secret would come out.  But he dreaded it.   The punishment would fall on him.           Daytime was the worst.  All day long it hung overhead.  The danger.  The responsibility.  He knew because he was trained to look.  To watch the heavens for signs and days and seasons.   But as with his secret, Jebediah tried to ignore what he saw.  To work around it.   It was harder now, though.  Harder than ever.   So, what do you think? Ezekiel asked.   Ezekiel was younger by ten years, a handbreadth taller, and fair in complexion.  He wore the bill of his dark hat wide, at the extreme edge of what the rules allowed.  His shirt was white, but yellowed by sweat at the back and armpits.  His dark pants showed the labor of half a day.  Together they stood on the trail that bisected Ezekiels farm from that of his neighbors.   In one hand, Ezekiel held the head of a stalk of wheat.  He rolled it with his thumb so that Jeb could see the entire head.  There were very few kernels, and they were tiny.  The effects of a blight? Shriver worms? Ezekiel smiled weakly.  Longday?  Jeb snorted.  Longday It was a generational joke, used to explain disorders of every kind.  A reference to the planets 26-hour rotation.   He glanced at the head of wheat, then gazed over the entire field.  Every stalk looked sickly, starved.  The heads were half the size of what they were ten years ago.  He turned and took a few steps toward the neighboring field.  That field was barley.  It looked better than the wheat, but not by much.  Jebs own land was wetter, but hed seen signs of change there as well.   After how poor last year was, Ezekiel said, I was hoping this year would be different.  Better.  He looked Jeb in the eyes.  Worried.  Weve had rain.  The heat hasnt been too extremeand we prayed, Jeb.  We all prayed, right?  Jeb nodded.  Ya, we did.  He looked toward Ezekiels barn, a fair walk distant.  It was painted red, with a green roof.  Not ostentatious.  All within Ordnung allowances.  Standards.  In fact, if it were all about obedience, their community did it best.  Helped each other.  Worked together.  Worshiped.   Jeb frowned.  He had written it off to the age of his eyes, this perception that the skys color had changed.  But now he wondered.  Has the breeze seemed warmer to you this year? he asked.   Ezekiel pushed his hat back and scratched his head.  Looked thoughtful.  I know I should notice such things, Jeb.  But I just dont.  The fieldsthe engagementtoo much on my labored mind.  He straightened his hat.  Smiled.  Thats why I ask you.  No one reads the world better.   Jebediah sniffed, forced a smile.  He knew he wasnt the only one noticing differences.  He couldnt be.  Some of the elders had twenty years on him.  Decades of watching the seasons.  They should know.  Yet no one talked about it.  They just worked harder.  Prayed harder.  Lived.   I sometimes wish for a device, Ezekiel said.  Something the smith or woodworker could construct for me.  Something that would keep track of all these millions of things.  Free my mind.  Save me time.   Jeb shook his head.  Such a thing wouldnt save you time, Zeke.  It would only add more complication.  Distract you from your calling.  From the Lords work.  Or so his grandfather had told him.   Ezekiel gave a quick bow of his head.  You speak true, Im sure.  I know, the more I have, the more I have to preserve.  The less time I ultimately have.   Jeb placed a hand on Zekes shoulder.  See there.  The beginning of wisdom.  Jeb motioned toward the path.  Lets walk back.   Ezekiel bowed again, crumbled the head of wheat in his hand and dropped it.  Looked over the field.  Looked worried again.  But about the field? The crops?  Jeb squeezed Zekes shoulder.  Tried to look confident.  To comfort.  I dont want to guess yet.  I want to study more.  Talk to a few elderspray.  He smiled.  Well get through it, whatever it is.  Were community.   Zeke returned the smile.  I knew I should ask you.  You always know what to do.   Jeb sniffed, began to walk.  He wished that were true.           Back at home, Jeb greeted Sarah quickly and walked outside again.  It was just after noon, and the suns current position was significant.  He didnt want to miss it.   Most of the cattle were outside now, grazing the north pasture.  The wooden fence line ran from the front of the barn due north for about two acres and turned west.  He noticed two calves as they chased each other.  Otherwise, the cows were quiet and content.  On the other side of the barn, the four horses clustered near the front fence.  Staring at him.  Again, hopeful.   Jeb shook his head, entered the barn and passed through the horse stalls and milking area to the back where he kept his tools.  The larger toolsshovels, mallets, and the likewere hung on the wall there.  The other, smaller tools, he kept in a long wooden work cabinet.  The top of the cabinet was large enough that it would easily support a fence post in need of repair, and the depth was better than six feet.  A sizable space for the type of work he performed on a daily basis.  The cabinet was heavy enough that few people would ever attempt to move it.  Which was good.   It also had lots of drawers.  Five across and either three or four going down, depending on the column.  The smaller drawers contained the finer tools.  Strapped to the back wall were glass jars containing smaller itemsscrews, nails, and wooden pegs.   Jeb knew right where to go for the particular items he sought.  He opened the leftmost drawer and pulled it all the way out.  When the back of the drawer became visible, he grabbed the sides of the drawer and lifted up a little.  He was then able to pull it farther out, revealing a second back.  In the space between was a folded piece of heavy cloth.  He brought that out and unfolded it.  Inside were two pieces of glass.  Special pieces of glass.  He pushed the drawer closed again and exited the barn.   In front of the barn were two vertical hitching posts for the horses.  They were hand-me-downs from his father that often brought comments for being a tad more than plain.  Usually hitching posts were crafted of wood, but these were made of metalan aluminum alloy, to be precise.   The horses just chew up the wood, he usually told the curious.  These were built to last.  To remain.  Like Fathers influence in my life.   That was usually enough explanation.  Family was the smallest representation of community.  In fact, true community required only two.  Just like Adam and Eve in the Garden.  They were both a community and a couple.   Jebediah approached the leftmost post.  The bottom quarter was covered with purple lichen, a reminder of Alabasters origins.  A minor annoyance.  He glanced first at the house behind him and then at the path that led from the house east, before squatting down near the post.  He spit in the heavy cloth he carried and pressed it to the metal.  Rubbed it up and down vigorously, clearing both dirt and lichen.   After a few seconds, he checked the posts surface and began rubbing again.  After a few more seconds, the post was clean enoughshiny enoughthat he could see the suns reflection in it.  He took another look at the house and raised one of his special glasses so that the light of the suns reflection passed through it.   The glass was a prism of sorts.  It separated the light into its primary components.  The post altered that rainbow so that the dark areas between the individual colors became visible.  These he stared at for many moments.  Comparing the pattern with what he remembered.  What hed been taught.   He shook his head.  Frowned.   He placed the cloth on the ground and put the prism on top of it.  He brought out the other piece of glass.  On its surface concentric circles had been drawn.  They denoted the eight seasons of the year, and the apparent size of the sun in the sky during those seasons.  The glass was also filtered to protect his eyes.   Jebediah turned toward the house.  Squinting, he brought the glass up and placed it over the suns circle in the sky.   He gasped.  The current image was larger than it had ever been.  At any time of the year.   That cant be right, he whispered.  Cant be.  He brought a hand to his chin, thought a moment.  He lifted the glass again.  Looked through it to study the surface of the sun.  He counted the spots of darkness there before checking the size a final time.  He brought the glass down then and placed it with the other.  Wrapped them up together.   He squatted there for a time, staring at the ground, chin wrapped in his hand again.  Thinking.   Finally, his knees reminded him of his age, so with a grunt, he collected the wrapped glass and stood.  He took a few short steps to let the pain and numbness subside.   Maybe what he was seeing was just the day? An effect of the atmosphere.  Heavy dust from the plants? Or something brought in with the wind.   He nodded.  Just interference.  That must be it.  He reentered the barn.  Ill check again tomorrow.           Three days later, Jebediah ran the glass tests again.  He couldnt bring himself to do it before that.  He didnt have the time.  He didnt make the time.  There were too many things to do.  Cows to milk, fields to hoe.  Too many things.   Sadly, the tests returned the same results.  It wasnt an atmospheric abnormality or a glitch in the test.  It was the sun.  Their sun.  Something was happening to it.   Now the question was: What to do?  Still frowning, Jeb returned the folded cloth holding the glass to the hidden portion of the work desk drawer and pushed it closed.  He turned around and leaned on the desk, crossing his arms and looking out toward the still open barn door.  He could see one of the metal poles there, and beyond, the dirt drive and the porch of the house.   The largest of his horsesEzrawas inside the barn enjoying the shade.  He watched Jebediah over the stable wall.  As the moments of contemplation wore on, Ezra snorted a few times.  Whinnied.  Lightly stamped his feet.   Finally, Jebediah walked across the barn and patted Ezras head.  He found where he kept dried apples and fed the horse a slice.  Ezra nodded his approval as he ate.  Jeb gave him a final pat and walked away toward the barn door.   Behind him, the secret beckoned.  Tugged at his mind, his feelings.   He paused at the door, but didnt turn.  It is sinful, he hissed.  Leave it be.   Yet the pull remained.  He felt a wave of heat and a new dampness under his arms.   I cannot.  He shook his head.  It is forbidden.   But dont you have to? Your father  His insides stirred.  Get thee behind me.  He strode stiltedly out the door.  Each step felt a little easier.  A little lighter.  He fixed his eyes on the house.  Kept walking.   The turmoil never really ceased, though.  The responsibility.   He entered the house to find the living room empty.  He could hear Sarah in the kitchen beyond.  The clanging of pots.  He stomped his feet on the mat and took his shoes off.  He pushed away his thoughts from the barn and walked toward the kitchen.  Toward comfort and reason.   The kitchen was large in comparison to the rest of the house14 feet by 12but that was because he knew it pleased his wife.  She loved company.  Loved to entertain.  Even though they had no children of their own.  Or maybe because of it.  She liked the presence of people, the conversation.  Serving.   The room had a small square table along the far wall.  To his right, on the same wall as the entrance, was a sink and ample counter space.  Perpendicular to that, along another interior wall, were the cast iron stove and more counter space.  There was a secondary entrance beyond that stove that led to a small utility room, complete with another sink.  Both sinks used hand pumps for water.  It was the height of convenience.  What his Sarah deserved.   She was positioned by the sink.  There was a large iron pot in one hand and steel wool in the other.  She wore the traditional long dark dress and had her head covered by a white kapp.  She was frowning.   Jeb approached and kissed her neck.   She rewarded his touch with a smile but returned to her scrubbing.  The frown returned, as well.   The Lord had blessed Jebediah with a wife whose emotions were always near the surface.  Other men in the settlement were not so fortunate.  A seemingly cloudless day could bring lightning in an instant.  Not so with Sarah.  What is wrong? he asked.   She shook her head, continued with her scrubbing.  She worked the sinks hand pump.  After a few strokes, water began to flow.  She held the pot under it.  Rinsed it.  Gave it the once over.  This stew doesnt want to let go, she said.   Jeb crossed to the table and took a seat.  Waited for a moment, just watching.  Sarah continued scrubbing.  Finally she set the pot aside and found an equally dirty skillet, started in on that.  So, youre not going to tell me? he said.   She shook her head again.  It is not important.  A worry.  It shouldnt be present in my mind.   Perhaps if you share it, it will leave.   She shrugged.  Perhaps.  She put down the skillet, wiped her forehead with her wrist.  Forgive me, my husband.  I should have gotten you a drink.  Youve been out in the sun.   Jeb straightened in his chair, placed an arm on the table.  Youre stalling, Sarah.   Sarah turned to look at him.  Both hands gripped the counter behind her, as if bracing herself.  How did your grandfather die? she asked.  Your grandmother?  Jeb raised an eyebrow.  Thats an odd question.   She stared at him, unblinking.  Just answer.   Well, I  Because I know the fall took your father, theres no helping that.  And your mother, her heart.  Again, it was obvious, unavoidable.  Sarah looked down, shook her head.  I still miss them.   Yes  But your grandparents were gone before I met you, and I dont remember you saying.  So, what was it? The fever? An accident? What?  Jeb couldnt hide his puzzlement.  They were old.  They worked hard  Sarah crossed her arms.  It wasnt the brain loss, was it? The wandering?  Jeb shook his head.  They were old, Sarah.  Things werent quite what they had been, but they were mostly all there.  Grandpa even helped shoe a horse the week he  So they kept themselves? Their whole lives? Their minds were good?  Yes, Jebediah said.  As much as I know.   Sarah chewed her bottom lip, watching him, arms still crossed.  Okay.  She turned and picked up the skillet again.  Started to scrub.   Jeb almost laughed.  Oh, no, you dont, he said.  You cant do that.   I was just asking, she said.  Nothing more.   Jeb feigned indignation.  My Frau! You must tell me why you boiled up all those questions.  It is the law!  Sarah paused, then her shoulders began to move as she giggled.  She turned again, and a smile filled her face.  Im sorry, husband.  I was just being silly.   Taming a planet is hard work, Sarah.  Alabaster was a gift, but like all the Lords gifts, it required hard work.   She flipped up a hand.  I know, I know.  They worked themselves to death with it.  Of course.  Everyones grandparents did.   He rested both hands on his knees.  So, why the questions?  She shook her head quickly.  I was spying, husband.  I shouldnt have.   Jeb felt a stirring in his stomach, but he kept a smile on his face.  Spying? On who?  On you.  Her eyes sought the floor.  I was looking out the window and saw youchecking the hitching post.  I didnt know what you were doing Redness enters her cheeks.  What were you doing?  You thought Id gone mad?  It is a sign, isnt it? Strange behavior.  Aimlessness.  So what were you doing?  In their life together there had been few reasons for Jebediah to lie.  Secrets, yes, but never outright lying.  He hated the idea, in fact.  He shouldnt start now.  It was sinful.  Forbidden.  But what to say? I was cleaning the post.   I guessed that.  But I saw you look at the house as if you were worried, she said.  And then at the sky.  She squinted.  Why were you looking at the sky?  So many questions, Jeb said, forcing a smile.  Such a suspicious tone.   She shook her head quickly.  I dont mean to be, Jeb.  I got worried.  Im your helpmate.   Jeb felt a tenderness at the words.  Smiled.  Yes, you are.   So, what were you doing?  Jebediah looked at the wooden floor beneath Sarahs feet.  He saw an oblong knotcommon for the trees that grew around them.  Unusual knot shapes.  Never circular.  Never simple.  There have been some problems with the crops.  Oddities.  He glanced up at her.  Not just this year, but the year before that, and before that.   Sarah nodded, listening.  She knew the last few years had been difficult.  Had required more time in the fields.  More watering.   Grandfather left me some things I could check with, he said.  Thats all.   So thats what you were doing? Checking what? The air? The sky?  Essentially.  He smiled, slowly got to his feet.  I was only trying to see if it would tell me anything.   And did it?  He drew closer, laid a hand on her arm.  Hoping the contact would calm her.  Distract her.  A little.  But nothing certain.  Nothing I can really do anything about.   Sarah nodded again quickly, then gave him a bashful wink that always warmed him.   He took her other arm in his.  Drew her toward him.  She didnt resist.  Anything else youd like to ask me? he said.  About the hitching post? Or why it is important?  Sarah blushed again.  I would, she said.  But Im afraid.   Jebediah laughed, relieved.  Thats probably wise.   Then, before she could say more, he kissed her.       2    Church service happened every other Sunday.  On this particular Sunday, the people from Jebediahs local district, roughly a hundred of them, gathered at the house of Bishop Samuel.  Samuel and his wife had produced a family of six childrennow grownso their dwelling was larger than most.  It was an opportune place for service.   Jebediah sat in the living room with the majority of the men.  Sarah was in the kitchen with the women.  The children were in an adjoining family room.   Wooden benches were brought in to make the seating arrangements easier.  Getting a hundred people into a single home was never easy.   The living room was similar in construction to Jebs own.  Wooden floors, plastered walls, heavy lacquer everywhere.  The room was longer than it was wide, and all the windows of the house had been opened.  It was a particularly hot day.  Only Jebediah had a true idea as to why.   Even the opening hymns, always sung in the same order, today seemed to echo Jebs hidden anxiety.  There were many verses about hunger, suffering, and grain.  With always the reminders of death and hell.   Deacon Mark stood to perform the first sermon.  Mark was in his mid-thirties.  A hard worker.  A broom maker.  His hat was on, but his coat was removed due to the heat.  There were dark suspenders over a starched white shirt.  He walked the house as he talked.  Occasionally, the floor creaked under his feet.   Cast your cares on the Lord! Mark said.  He will sustain you.  Marks style was to chant the sermon as he went along.  His opening Bible verse was Psalms 55:22.   Many of the men nodded their heads.  Jeb heard a respectful Yes, Lord, from one of the elderly women.   He will never, never, never let the righteous be shaken.   More nods.  More affirmation.   Like everyone present, Jebediah fanned his face with a paper fan.  It hardly helped.   Do you believe it? Mark chanted.   Yes, some said.   Mark repeated his question twice, until nearly the whole house answered.   Jebediah fanned himself.  Subtly glanced out the window.  How, though? How would the Lord sustain? Would He now alter the sun? Heal it somehow?  The pain in his gut grew.  The indecision.  He tried to stay still.  Tried to stay comfortable.  Help me, Lord, he prayed.   Mark repeated the theme of trusting God.  Continued to walk the house.  His eyes reddened, and he began to weep.  He was handed a handkerchief, but he refused to take it.  He let his eyes show his pain.  His faith.  The floor creaked.  More amens.  His focus verse changed to Luke 10:29.  Who is my neighbor? Who can tell me? Is it just your family? Your friends?  After nearly half an hour, Deacon Mark called for prayer.  Everyone rose from their seats and knelt beside them.  Hands were folded, heads were bowed with pious faces.   Jebediah thought of the heat and the crops.  He prayed for wisdom.  For a way out of his silent burden.  His secret.   He thought of Sarah in the kitchen.  His trusting and unsuspecting wife.  He hated keeping anything from her.  But it was the Miller duty.  The mans duty.   Everyone started to rise, and Jebediah missed the cue.  He remained on the floor, eyes tightly shut.  Teeth gritting with prayerful intensity.   He felt a touch on his shoulder.  A gentle hand.  He opened his eyes and nodded, almost embarrassed.  Got back to his seat.   Bishop Samuel spoke next.  In his seventies, he was one of their oldest members.  Their bishop.  Respected by everyone, though not necessarily liked by everyone.  He always seemed a bit too rigid to Jebediah.  A bit too harsh.  Samuels beard was greying, as was his hair.  He kept his coat on, despite the heat.   Brother Mark spoke well to remind us of the Lords sustenance.  He brought us here, He will sustain us.  Samuel gripped the front of his coat with one hand, began to slowly walk.  And how will he sustain us? By His mighty hand.  By His Spirits presence.  His eyes sought the floor, thoughtful.  Then he panned the faces of the men.  By our works for our neighbors.  Our Gelassenheit.   Jebediah glanced at the window again, then toward the kitchen.  Sarah was sitting on a bench near the back wall.  She smiled.   We are the salt of the earth.  The light on the hill.  Samuel turned his back on the men, and started walking toward the family room, and the children.  How much darkness does it take to extinguish a light?  The children sat in silence.   Samuels demeanor didnt change, but his voice rose.  I say, how much darkness does it take! Anyone? He leaned close to the front row of children.  Someone must know.  He pointed to a girl of blond curls and freckles.  I know you know, young lady.   The girl smiled shyly.  None?  Samuel pulled back, turned away, took a long step.  Nodded.  The young lady says none, and she speaks rightly.  There is no darkness that can extinguish light.  You can take all the darkness of the night sky, compress it together, but even so the light of a single candle wont be extinguished.  Samuel smiled.  We are that light.  He made a circling motion with his hand.  All of us.  Together.  The light that wont be wiped out.   Now often, just by the things we do, we keep that light burning.  Samuel turned toward the kitchen.  By that loaf of bread you bring the sick, by that child you watch for your sister, by the barn you help build.  Samuel smiled.  I love the family weve built here.  I love what it represents.  How it shows the love of Christ.  Every day in its actions.  Together, we can accomplish much.  Overcome any hardship.   The words did little to comfort Jebediah, but his feelings began to change.  He started to think that the thing he dreaded might be the very thing God wanted him to endure.  Could that be? Was there some way to know for sure?  If only there was someone to talk with.  To share the secret.  But there wasnt.  He would honor the settlement, yes, but he would also honor his forefathers with his silence.   He thought of the stars.  Lights in the darkness.  What he was contemplating doingwould it build community or shatter it? Save it or destroy it?  Samuels sermon continued for almost an hour.   Jebediahs confusion continued for much longer.           Later, after communion was taken, Bishop Samuel again became the focus.  He stood with his Bible spread open between his hands.  It was a heavy book and greatly worn, doubtless a gift handed down through the generations.  Nearly all their bound books were so.   Our fellowship has grown.  We are in need of another minister.  He stared down at the Scriptures.  If any man aspires to the office of overseer, he read, it is a fine work he desires to do.  An overseer must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, prudent, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not addicted to strong drink or pugnacious, but gentle, peaceable, free from the love of money.  He must be one who manages his own household well He continued through the entire third chapter of First Timothy, outlining the requirements of leaders and ending with the mystery of godliness.   At last, Samuel closed his Bible, and Mark stood to join him.  We will be in the dining room, Samuel said, nodding.  They wound through the seats to a door just right of the kitchen.  The edge of the long dining table was just visible from where Mark sat.  It was stained medium brown.  When the two pastors arrived there, they went deep into the room, out of sight from everyone else.   The remaining men looked at each other, waiting for someone to be the first.  Finally, one of the older menAmosstood and walked to the dining room door.  He stood just outside and whispered only a single word to the occupants before returning to his seat.  This process was repeated by every baptized man and boy.  When it came Jebs turn, he met both pastors eyes and whispered, James.   After the men finished, it was the womens turn.  When all the baptized had gone, the pastors exited the dining room, taking positions on either side of the door.   Mark stood with his hands clasped together in front of him.  We have made our selections, he said.  And the hymnals have been placed.  When I call your name, please enter the dining room and sit in front of one of the hymnals there.  He nodded.  Amos Shrock.   The older man rose again and made his way to the dining room.  Samuel watched him as he went in out of sight.  There was the sound of a chair being drawn out.  Amos sitting down.   Jebediahs stomach started to trouble him.  What if Sarah? He looked toward the kitchen, again sought his wifes face.  She flashed a smile.  His feeling intensified.  It took at least three votes to be selected.  Sarah might have voted for him, but he hoped no one else would.  Please, Lord, not now.  Not when Im so confused.   Luke Hochstetler, Mark said.   Jebediahs anxiety lessened.  In their district, usually three or four were selected for the lot drawing.  Being selected as a pastora deacon or bishopwas typically for life.  Only occasionally would someone resign the post due to illness or grief.  It was a hard life.  A heavy duty.  Hed never wanted it.  Few did.   There was the sound of Luke taking his seat.  Jebediah looked at the floor.  Prayed again.   Jebediah Miller.   Jebediah masked his feelings.  Numbly, he walked to the dining room.  Amos and Luke were seated on opposite sides of the table, a faded green hymnal before each.  There were two more hymnals available.  Either to Amoss left or to Lukes right.  Jebediah paused at the end of the table.  Breathed a prayer.  He took a step toward Luke, but then stopped himself, backpedaled, and moved to Amoss left.  He stared at the hymnal for some time before slowly sinking into the chair.   The pain in his midsection intensified.  The confusion.   A few moments later, James Stolfuz entered.  He was a heavyset man, balding beneath his hat.  He nodded at everyone in the room and took the final seat, looking white and nervous.   Samuel and Mark entered, stood at one end of the table.  The lot is cast into the lap, Mark said, But its every decision is from the Lord.   Samuel nodded in agreement.  You may open the hymnals now.   Jebediah felt his palms begin to sweat.  He wiped them together under the table.  To his right, Amos opened his hymnalthumbed through it.  Found nothing.  Next Luke went.  He also found nothing.   Jebs heart pounded.  Lord, why would You bring this to me?  You go first, James said.  He looked doubly nervous.  James was what passed for a physician in the settlement, and was typically quick to laugh.  Jovial even.  Nothing should make him nervous.   Jebediah girded himself.  Reached for the hymnal cover.  Opened it.  Saw nothing.  The slip of paper could be anywhere, though.  A piece of paper with the written form of the verse Mark had just quoted.  About decisions being from the Lord.   Jebediah could not bear the responsibility.  Not when mixed with his secret.  It would be like water and kerosene.  He picked the book up by the spine.  Held it over the table.  Shook it.  Waited for something to fall.   But nothing did.   Jebediah looked to see James holding a slip of paper in his hands.  His eyes were red and brimming with tears.  Others in the room, and then in the house, began to weep and pray with him.   Jebediah wept too.           That evening, after the livestock had been fed, Jebediah reclined in the living room in a chair he had built himself.  It had broad wooden armrests and leather cushions that had taken weeks to sew together.  In his hands he held the Bible his father had left for him.  Today, his daily reading was on the Exodus.  The part where the Israelites were standing on the shores of the Red Sea with the Egyptians bearing down on them.  Just the sea before them and the soldiers of the enemy behind.  Trapped and surrounded.  No escape in sight.   In the back of his Bible, Jebediah had a map of the route the Israelites had taken.  To get from Goshen, where theyd started, to Mount Sinai where the Ten Commandments had been given, there were other routes they couldve followed.  In fact, it appeared there was a much easier routean overland routetraveling north of the Red Sea.  That route even appeared shorter.  Furthermore, the whole route to the Promised Land seemed like a winding mess.  As far from a crow-flies straight line as one could get.   Yet the Lord had taken them the way He did.  Marched them out of their way to a place where they were absolutely boxed in.  The sea in front.  Angry soldiers behind.   Why would He do that?  Jeb heard a small ruckus from the kitchen.  The clatter of something hitting the floor.  He quickly straightened his seat and hurried that way.  He found Sarah leaning against the counter.  On the floor at her feet was a widening pool of water and an otherwise empty pan.  She smiled when she saw him.  He moved to help her, but after a simple hug, she nudged him away.   Im fine, husband.  Another smile.  Brighter this time.   Jeb couldnt take his eyes off her.  Are you? Really?  Yes! Just a little dizzy all of a sudden.   Jebediah pulled out a seat.  Rest for a moment.   Sarah seemed to contemplate it.  Jeb noticed a strand of hair had escaped her kapp.  A bit of dishevel she rarely showed.  Finally, with a nod, she took the seat.  Jeb took the seat nearest her.  Reached out for her hand.   She smiled again.  Arent we the hero, she said.  Looking out for your dainty wife.   Jeb managed a smile.  Looked at her face.   Sarah gazed at the floor, then back at him.  How do you feel about secrets? she asked.   Secrets? He wasnt sure what to say.  How to begin.  First questions about his sanity, now this? He wondered how his father had maintained balance.  Surely Mother had suspected something.  She didnt miss anything we kids did, thats for sure.   You know what the bishop says, Jeb said.  About how the devil loves them.   She nodded, looked at her hands, looked at him again.  Smiled.  Yes, that is right.  I just wanted to be sure.   He felt more terrible now than ever.  He was a hypocrite.  A liar and a hypocrite.   Sarah knotted her hands together.  Husband, I have been keeping something from you.   Jebs eyes widened.  Sarah? He felt a lump in his throat.  A condemnation of his soul.  His terribleness.  Sarah, I have something to say also.  Finally, freedom.  Someone to talk with.  He felt a twinge of guilt, though.  The words of his father.  Jeb looked at the floor.  Shook his head.  You first, he said.   It was clear she was struggling.  Emotions wanting to bubble to the surface.  Yet she didnt seem sorrowful.  Remorseful.  She seemed giddy.   Jebediah Miller, she said.  Im pregnant.           Jebediah rose early the next morning.  He and Ezekiel had an appointment to fix a section of fence together.  Before he got started with that, before the heat of the day, Jeb had another obligation to fulfill.   Sarah, pregnant? It wasnt supposed to happen.  Not with them both touching forty.  Not now.   Thankfully, the news had kept him from having to share his secret with her.  Too much excitement.  Too much surprise!  The night that followed had been terrible, though.  He hadnt been able to sleep.  The bed had felt softer than it ever had.  In need of tightening.  And the itches! Hed never remembered his bedclothes feeling so uncomfortable.  It was like there had been angry chigflies in the room.  Except there werent.  Just him, Sarah sleeping, and an extremely restless mind.   Even without yesterdays sermon, he knew what the Scriptures said about relying on the Lord.  He knew the importance of yielding to His will.  Believed it.  But what was most important now was that the people of Alabaster survived.   And who was to say that Jeb wasnt Gotts instrument in this? That in his own meager way, he might not enact the will of Derr Herr? Just like Moses.   It was still dark outside.  On the way to the barn, Jeb marveled at the stars overhead.  He wondered how many of them held planets like their own.  How many were occupied.  He knew that some were, but were any of them like their planet? Like Alabaster? Were the people the same?  Inside the barn, Jeb lit a lamp and walked back to the work table.  The table was heavy, solid.  Appeared impossible to move.  But that was only if you didnt know what to do.  Where to look.   He stooped to the left table leg and slid a hand along the back.  There was a small plate there, a stop, that with a pull he was able to disengage and slide up.  He did the same with the other leg and felt the table shift ever so slightly.  There were hidden wheels in the legs, and though they were never oiled, rarely used, they appeared to function just fine.   With only a slight tug, the table moved his direction.  He grabbed the left side and pulled it back more than a foot.  He hissed as one of his glass storage jars hit the barn floor and shattered.  He nervously checked behind him and stooped to pick up the pieces.  Thankfully, there had been only a couple of dozen nails in the jar.  He collected the broken glass and set them out of the way.  He gathered the nails and put them in a separate jar.   He checked to make sure no other jars were in danger of falling and pulled on the tables right side.  After a few more feet, working one side and then the other, the table stalled on a clump of straw.  Jebediah frowned, considered removing the straw and moving the table out farther, but he finally just shrugged.  It was enough space.   He made another check of the barn behind him.  In the lamplight, he could see only the closed door and the head of one of the horses looking over its stall at him.  There had been no sound from the cows yet.  Even after the jar broke.  A blessing.   He walked around to the back of the work table.  There was a hole in the wall there, a two foot high by one foot wide opening.  Jeb set his light next to the hole and looked inside.  The object was still there.  Exactly where his father had shown him.   He couldnt help but feel a bit of apprehension.  What if he were wrong?  Jeb slid both hands inside and touched the object.  It felt cool and smooth.  He ran his hands over the surface.  There were rounded ridges that reminded him of the metal skeps Zedekiah used to mind his bees.  He hoped that was where the similarities ended.   Jeb pulled the object out and set it on the floor in front of him.  It somehow seemed taller than when hed seen it as a young man.  Yes.  It looked exactly like a man-made beehive or an elongated and ridged bell.  Except it was much lighter than a bell or skep would be, and a lot shinier.  It reflected the light better than the hitching posts outside.  Plus, it had a circle of inlaid glass around the top and a singular square plate at the bottomthe activator, his father had called it.   This object, his secret, contained more technology than he had used his entire life.  It also had a built-in power source, somehow able to run for centuries.  To wait until it was needed.   He felt guilty just looking at it.   Jebediah heard a huffing sound behind him.  He felt a twinge of panic, and almostalmostpushed the object back into the hole again.  He had no business touching it.  It wasnt the time.  This wasnt right.  But then he remembered the tests hed run.  The failing of the crops.  The unusual heat.  The spectral lines.   his pregnant wife.   The noise was just one of the horses, he thought.  It was snorting because it couldnt see him any longer.  It wondered what he could possibly be doing that didnt include getting it food.   Jeb shook his head.  Smiled.  This is it.  Using this device is what I need to do.   Without further ceremony, he reached out and pushed the activator.  One of the glassed sections at the top immediately lit up blue.  Another followed, and another, until finally the whole top circle was glowing.  A few seconds went by, but nothing more happened.   Is that all it does? Just lights up? He scratched his head.  How would he even know it was working? His father had never told him what to look for or even what the strange device did.   Jeb sniffed.  Maybe his anxiety and indecision had been for naught.  Maybe the thing was broken  The lights flashed and Jeb scrambled back a few paces, finally stopping when he touched the surface of the work bench.  The intensity level steadily increased.  He wondered if he should stand up and get back even farther.  He instead brought his hands to his face and peered out through barely separated fingers.   The object began to emit a sound.  A droning hum that steadily increased in pitch until it became quite disturbing.  Jebediah shut his eyes and moved his hands to his ears.   There was another flash, a pulse really, and a shaft of light escaped from the top of the machine and stretched up toward the barn roof.   Then it was over.  The machine went completely dark and completely silent again.   Jebediah sat stunned, breathing hard.  Excited and frightened at the same time.  He heard another sound behind him then, a whimper, but not from a horse.  He stood and bringing up his lantern, looked out into the barn again.   Standing just three paces past the work bench was Ezekiel.   His eyes were wide, but otherwise he was completely rigid.  Almost frozen.  Jeb called his name, but only the younger mans eyes moved.  They looked at him, and then up toward the apex of the barn.  Then back at him.   Jebediah Miller, what have you done?      3    Captain Sealius Drake was in his personal study with the door closed.  The surface of his desk showed the delivery logs of his current vessel, the Raven, over the past solar year.  Seal hovered over the desk, staring intently.  One hand cradled his chin, the other manipulated the desks datasliding a row here, pushing a column there.  It was all very routine.  Very predictable.  Purposeful.   Which was how the Delivery Guild liked it.  Routine and predictable.  Schedules met and kept.  Objects transferred without interruption from Stellar Point A to Stellar Point B.  Colonies needing supplies, received them.  Without exception.   Commerce depended on Guild ships like the Raven, the Crow, the Oriole, and whatever other avian species theyd used to name the latestSwallow, maybeto do their job.  All needed to move.  To fly the heavens.  Do what you dowell move you.   Seal heard a knock on his door.  He frowned and swiped both hands together on the desks surface, closing the logs.  What is it? He brought both thumbs up to massage the bridge of his nose.  Stifled a yawn.   Message off the scraddlebox, sir.  A female voice, young and enthusiastic.  New assignment.   Seal nodded, bid the crewmember enter.  The door slid back with a slight wheeze.  The crewmember was blond and dressed in Guild finestblue pants and short sleeved shirt.  On the right breast of her shirt was the gold bird-like glyph of the Guild.  It resembled a smooth, flattened-out M.  Beneath it was a black name tag, which he ignored.  She wore a regulation cap too, with a matching glyph.  She found a place in front of his desk and stood at near attention, both hands clasped behind her back.  All very professional.   As it should be.   You couldnt just wire it to me? he asked.   HQ said no.  Said it was face only.   Seal sighed.  Someone at HQ liked dramatics.  Doubtless there was a new manager who wanted to strengthen his office empire.  Make it seem like he or she was running a military troop.  The Guild modeled their business on military precision, of course, so there was some precedent for that.  But the galaxy wasnt at war any longer.  Not even an inner system skirmish that he knew of.   He frowned.  Unless you counted the upstart StarRace delivery service, of course.  They handled packages of only two tons or less, though.  Hardly competition.  No war, he said aloud.   The crewmember looked startled.  Sir?  Nothing, Seal said, shaking his head.  So what is it? We have a schedule.   She gave a short nod.  HQ noted that we have no perishables on this ship.   Seal sniffed.  Is that so? Well, with twenty days of slipping ahead, Id hope not.   And that we have sufficient free space for the articles in question.  The crewmember remained rigid with eyes locked ahead.  She wasnt so much looking at him as through him.   Seal almost turned to see what she was staring at.  It certainly wasnt the office view.  Behind him was nothing more than a picture of an eagle flying over his birth home on Freehaven.  Lots of trees and mountains.  Irony of ironies, eagles seemed to be able to live anywhere.   Captains should get a space view in their study, though, shouldnt they? At least a little portal where they can watch the stars go by?  He sniffed.  Guild wouldnt have it.  Business to run.  No time for daydreaming.   Sir?  You know this isnt the military, he said.  Captain Drake is fine.  Or just Captain.  The latter was a bit of an honorarium, since in ships like the Raven, most of the piloting was automatic.   She nodded.  Okay, sir.  Captain, sir.   He just shook his head.  The cargo, he said.  Where and what?  Maple system.  Remains of experimental outpost Reclamation, sirumCaptain.   A non-standard size package?  Heavy cargo, but said to be properly sealed.   Seal thought of the Ravens partially full Bay 16.  Wondered if he could make this new cargo fit.  Is it rectangular? he asked.  Because if it isnt, we might have to use Bay 17.  Be unfortunate.  I was hoping to fill that one with grain at Mogex.  He looked at his desk.  Have to adjust the ledger.  Factor for it.  Might cost extra  Im told it is properly bundled, Captain Drake.  Ready for transit.   He sighed again.  On second thought, can you just call me Seal? he asked.  Feels better.   The crewmember seemed to relax a bit.  Seal, yes, I can do that.   So it is rectangular, this shipment? Or can it be made so?  Yes.  Two rectangulars, actually.  A larger containing the remains of  Seal held up a hand.  Wait, remains? So we are transporting hazardous materials? There were other such materials on board, of course, but it meant extra caution.  Extra caution meant extra union pay.  Extra time.  Extra cost all the way around.   They say it is inert now.  There was an accident, but it is contained.  Over.  Boxed and sealed.   Boxed and sealed, he repeated, smiling.  Sealed for Seal, eh? I like that.  He squinted at her name tag.  Crewmember Singer.   Her cheeks colored.  Thank you, sir.  Seal, sir.  I wasnt trying toI meanyour name  He waved.  I said I liked it, he said.  Now, I thought I heard you say two packages.   Her hands appeared from behind her back.  Swung free.  I did.  The second is a cryomatrix.   Seal leaned back in his seat.  Cryo? He touched his chin.  Havent seen one of those in a while.  So we have a passenger?  Singer nodded.  Yes, but HQ says no maintenance will be necessary.  Just pickup and delivery.   Seal frowned.  Someones trying to get around paying the passenger fee.  Im surprised HQ allowed  Singers hands went behind her back again.  She shook her head.  Shes injured, Seal.  An accident, apparently.  XP sealed the whole thing and are sending it to Obelisk for examination.  Mishap reconstruction.   Theyre going to reconstruct the mishap? That hardly seems advisable.   I dont know.  They only told me so much.  I just handle the scraddle.   He studied her face, twisted his lips in thought.  But HQ gives this all the okay?  Yes, she said.  The fees are already paid.  We just need to make the stop.   Seal shrugged.  Touched the desk to bring up the ledger.  Checked again the free space onboard.  The manpower.  Alright.  Well make the stop.   Singer nodded.  Very good, sir.  Should I tell the pilots?  Seal touched his side, felt the bit of physical padding that had developed over the last year.  No.  Ill do it.  I can use the walk.  Got to get out of this office sometime, you know.   Singer dipped her head, took a step back.  So, I can  Yes.  He smiled.  You can go.  And Ill go with you.           Early stories romanticized outer space.  Epic battles and sultry princesses.  Ancient wizards fighting maniacal villains.  Dogfights and laser beams.  Searches for galactic mysteries.  Or destiny.   In reality, space had none of those things.  At least, not in Seals lifetime.  Space was nothing more than a medium to be crossed, just like the continental landmass colonists might push through, or a sailors trip across the ocean.  It was not epic, or even romantic.  It just was.  Dangerous in some places, certainly.  Hostile to the ill-prepared.  But space was genuinely a very boring place.   Empty and useless.   And Guild ships steer clear of all the dangerous, he said aloud.  And are always, always prepared.   Sir? Crewmember Singer said.  I mean, Seal.   They rode one of the Ravens primary slideways together.  This particular slide stretched from the ships stem to its stern and was contained within transparent material.  It was tube-like, really.  Like a giant human-based habitrail.  Slides going both directions.  Handrails for safety.   Overhead was the dull crisscross of the crafts support structures, all brown.  To their left, more infrastructure and an occasional section of wall.   On their right and below was the second of the ships largest storage bays, the first being on the opposite side of the ship.  From their perspective, they could tell the bay was filled to capacity.  From top to bottom, there was only row after row of solid white rectangles, all sealed and properly labeled.  They contained anything from toothpaste to building supplies to ship parts.  They were all just parcels to him.  Things going somewhere.   Seal snorted.  Just reflecting on how this ship echoes reality, he said.   Singers hands were clasped behind her back.  She was an attractive female, he now realized.  A little young and gung-ho for his taste, but altogether striking.  Especially in her proper Guild uniform.  Doubtless she had a line of men in the office pool vying for her attention.   The Raven, he said, to someone of an artistic mind, is a traveling carbuncle.  Boxy.  Few curves.  Little more than a slip-enabled barge.   Singer smiled politely.  Yet it is a model of efficiency here, she said.  And there is beauty in that, dont you think?  Seal returned her smile.  Let his eyes linger.  Yes, definitely pretty.  How long have you been assigned here? he asked.   Since the Ash system.   Graduated from land-based operations?  The smile widened.  Yes.  Bumped up.  First in my class for communications equipment.   He nodded approvingly.  And how was your load test score?  She gave a polite nod, one that showed both disappointment and acceptance.  I was third, she said.  In a class of twenty.   And low-grav?  The hint of a smile.  Second, she said.  But a close second.   Seal raised an eyebrow.  Nothing to be ashamed of there.  I was third in low grav, myself.   Another nod.  Thank you, sir.   A mock frown.  Please  Seal.  Thank you.  You are kind.   Another bay approached.  Though inactive now, each had its own network of package-only slideway conveyors that, when they reached port, could quickly load or unload the space.  Very little human interaction was required.  Even now the boxes were categorized and positioned in such a way to make the procedure most efficient.  Seal liked to watch the loading process.  It was like a symphony to him.   Minutes later their slideway slowed, and the transparency around them ended, replaced by solid white walls.  On the ceiling overhead a sign identified the slow zone as a potential stopping point.  In this case it was the locomotive section, meaning the rooms and machinery that composed the ships engine.  Seal looked at Singer, wondering if she showed an interest in such things.  He certainly didnt.  He was relieved when she barely turned to acknowledge the sections existence, even when the slide opened up completely on their right for the stop.   She glanced at him once, smiled, and otherwise looked firmly ahead as they slowly slid by.  On to the bubble then, she said.   Yes, Seal nodded.  The bubble.   They passed more storage bays, though these were smaller than those near the back of the ship, where Seals office was located.  The slideway made a gentle curve then, toward the center of the ship.  Another slow zone approached, this one marked only as Technical.   When the tube opened again, Seal allowed Singer to step off and then followed.  They passed through a doorway that tabulated their passing with a loud ding and turned left, toward the front of the ship.  After a secondary doorway, they entered a large open room, generally triangular, that had been subdivided into dozens of triangular work areas.  The floor was an efficient blue color, and the walls were sandstone.  Everything was perfectly neat.  There were no windows here either.   There were a few potted plants scattered about, some exotic enough to look alien.  None of them really were.  Everything that populated the starsno matter how strangeultimately traced its origins back to Earth, and to humanitys urge to meddle.   Genesplicers, Seal muttered.  He gazed over the rows of work areas.  He glanced at Singer, now walking near his hip.  Where do they have you, Singer?  She nodded toward the peak of the triangle.  That way.  The most claustrophobic section.  But thats where the new girl starts, I guess.   Seal sniffed.  I remember those days.  Not being the new girl, of coursebut, the other  Singer smiled.  Do you need me to go with you then? she asked.   No, Ill be fine from here.  A smile.  It was nice walking with you Singer.   A nod, a bit of a smile.  You too.  Seal.  She turned into the nearest aisle and moved away from him.  Seal watched her depart over the triangular walls.  Sighed.   Continuing through the room, he reached a short corridor that led only to his right.  He followed it to a stairwell and ascended the sixteen steps.  At the top was a locked hatch.  He rapped on it.  There was a puff of air as the door released, and a brown ladder descended.  It was an archaic form of entry, of course, but regulations supported it.  The chamber above seemed needlessly dark, but again, regulations.  With a grunt, he ascended the ladder.   He entered a small spherical room.  Around the perimeter was a long, seamless deskin actuality, a single active control sheet.  The surface was filled with lists and tabulations, the excruciating data that made piloting the ship possible.  What little of it that wasnt handled by computer.  In front of the entrance, on either side, sat two young men.  Both had dark hair.   At the moment, one was crouched over the desk, with elbows resting on it and hands supporting his face.  He was either deep in thought or completely asleep.  Seal guessed the latter.  The other young man, the pilot, had a data tablet in his lap and was clearly reading.  Doubtless, nothing to do with ship maneuvering.  Crossed legs supported the tablet.   The bubble, as the chamber was called, was where the hapless pilot and co-pilot spent most of their waking moments.  The name came from the transparent ceiling overhead.  At the moment, the view was a 360 degree panorama of total grey, without even a star to break the monotony.  The fog of slip travel.   Hello, young men, how are we? Seal asked.   The man on the left startled and pulled away from the desk.  Rubbed his left eye with a palm.  His face showed a dull redness where his hands had been.   The otherthe pilotsimply looked up from his reading.  Oh, hello, Captain, he said, smiling politely.   His compatriot stretched both arms over his head.  What brings you to see us?  Seal tried to ignore the still waking co-pilot.  At least they were both wearing clothes.  Their shirtswhich should be dress shirts with a company-logo vest or top coatwere short sleeve, but still presentable.  They were solid dark colors.  Happily, they didnt bear the insignia of the latest shock band.  We need to make a stop at Maple, Seal said.   Now hugging himself, the co-pilot frowned.  Maple system? Thats Ospreys route.   Seal squinted for the name tagwhich, thankfully, was in place.  Egan, it read.  Yes, but theyre too far out, he said.  This is special rate delivery.   The pilot, Perth, shot Egan a look.  Dont spoil it, Egan.  This is a chance to cut grey for a day.  Dont complain.   Egan shrugged.  Just quoting the roster, sir.  Dont want to crush any toes.   Perth uncrossed his legs.  Grabbed his pants at the knees and straightened them.  Crossed his arms.  About twenty, he said to Seal.   The propellant costs?  Perth nodded.  Yes, thats my guess.  It is the drop from slip that costs you.  He pointed absently.  In-system maneuvers arent so bad.  Reaching slip again, not bad.  But the stop really wears on the engine.  Costs us fuel.   Seal only nodded.  He was well aware of typical start and stop costs.  Hed been a pilot once himself.  A long time ago.  When he was about twenty pounds lighter.   It was best to let the pilot tell him, though.  Gave him something to do.  A role.   Can we have some time at Maple? Egan asked.  Time to stretch our legs? Maybe a few days?  Seal shook his head.  Just long enough for pickup, he said.  You guys know that.   Egan feigned a pout.  But, Captain He gestured toward the canopy and the fog.  Look at that.  Could you stand it?  Ive done it, Seal said.  A smile.  Well have time at Obelisk.  I promise.   Thats ten days out, Perth said.  After the Maple stop.   Seal nodded.  Yes, Im aware.   And nothing remarkable in between, Egan said.  Just oceans of grey.  Of the two, Egan was slighter, and years younger.  His pants barely fit him.  Ill go goofy.   Seal resisted rolling his eyes.  Im sure youll survive.   Goofy!  Seal frowned, placed a foot on the upper rung of the ladder.  Just make it happen, okay?  Aye, aye, sir.  Egan looked across at Perth.  Did you like that? It is a nautical reference, I think.   Brilliant.   Yes Seal said, and descended out of sight.           Congi didnt even look up from his meal.   He was in one of the Ravens small lounges and had two quickfood bags opened on the table in front of him.  A sweet and a salty, his favorite complements.  Hed been alternating between them.  Enjoying the experience.  So he ignored the womans comment completely.   She repeated herself.  Mart said you could get things.   It was better to make customers wait, Congi knew.  It was a good way to measure them.  To understand what they were about.  Their motives.  And the more he knew, about everything, the better.   A huff.  Okay, sorry, maybe I was wrong.   Congi held up a hand.  Followed with his eyes.  The woman was moderately attractive.  Shorter.  Medium-brown hair.  Dressed in a solid blue shirt and khaki pants.  Nametag said Danielle.   Congi rarely wore his nametag.  His typical outfit was what he had on now: faded jeans and t-shirt.  Todays shirt bore the company taglineDo what you dowell move you.  You know Mart? he said.   Yeah, from security.   Congi nodded, a bit uncomfortable.  Hed been working the Raven for longer than any of the others.  Effectively.  Safely.  That meant being tactful.   Could you get me something for my nephew? It doesnt have to be much.   Congi raised an eyebrow.  What, a ball or something? Because the ships store has some of them.  They say Shipping Guild right on them.   Danielle shook her head.  No, not something like that.  Something unique.  Maybe something technical.  Hes real smart.  Likes science.   Congi looked down and brushed the crumbs off his shirt.  Middle-aged, thinning on top, and a bit thick around the center, he knew he wasnt going to charm anyone with his physical appearance.  But he was special nonetheless.  He had something everyone needed.  Ive got some asteroid fragments, he said.  Want those? High iron.   Danielle frowned.  He already has some, I think.  The kid has everything.   Congi frowned.  Might take some looking.  Lots of looking.  Time.   And that means expensive, right?  Congi took another green chip from the salty bag.  Crunched on it.  Looked bemused.  Probably you should go.  Ive got my lunch to finish.  A job to do.   Her eyes widened.  No, thats okay.  Mart says youre worth it.  Says what you get is good.  Whatever price you think is fair is fine.   He brushed his shirt again.  Im a little more flexible when someone isnt specific.  He flashed a smile.  Made a small rectangle with his hands.  So something whizpop, say about half a meter or less?  She nodded.   And does it need to function? Cause Im not sure Ill know.   Just something exotic.  Something he cant get on the netstream back home.   Congi nodded.  Picked up his napkin and rubbed his hands hard.  Said nothing.   So youll help?  You can go.   Danielle looked confused.  Hovered.   Congi frowned.  Ill look.   She smiled brightly.  Looked like she might hug him.  Thanks so much.   He nodded.  And tell Mart Ill find something for him too.   The woman nodded and hurried away.   Congi sat silently for a moment.  Studied the empty bags in front of him.  Finally, he smashed them together.  Grunted.  Time to work.       4    Seal stood just past the entrance to Bay 16.  Overhead, the entire bay was open to space.  He could see the distant double stars of the Maple system locked in their slow forever rotation.  There were countless stars visible, along with the extended tail of a comet now headed away from the suns.   More obvious, though, was the smartloader.  Its rectangular bulk filled half the visible area above.  It was a robotic vehicle used for extremely large or awkward packages.  Seal was a bit disappointed that the pickup had come to this.  That it required this level of handling.  But that was neither here nor there.  It would all be applied to the costs.  And since the Science Consortium was paying to move the gear from their outpost and whatever accident it had suffered, there was no problem with that.   It was the time he couldnt get back.  They had a schedule to meet.  A few days could be made up within the slip, but  The package itself was suspended via the loaders purely mechanical hand.  It was a cube about twenty meters square, and properly wrapped in white.  Large, but completely nondescript, aside from an external shipping label.  Some generic scientific gear inside, probably.  Seal wouldve preferred the use of a gravity lock to move it, but the order had specifically requested manual operation.  It was a common requirement.  A few gravity lock mishaps decades ago had made a galaxy of customers superstitious.   As a precaution, Seal wore a grey Tingle capcomplete with bill and company logoalong with matching gloves, belt, and boots, an entire Tingle suit.  Combined, the clothing produced a body-shaped force field.  It was enough to protect Seal from any stray radiation while the bay doors were open.  The Tingles also protected against hard damageif he bumped into a wall, for instance, or accidentally dropped something on his foot.   It wasnt enough to keep him from being squished to death if the package dropped on him though.  He was standing well back from that.   The Tingle belt also circulated fresh oxygen within the field.  With it on, he could walk in space, if he wanted to.   He didnt.   Standing near him was Greels, one of the loading supervisors.  He was a short man, thin and past middle age.  Greels wore a Tingle suit too.  In his hand, he held a camera that sent distance measurements to the loader.  It was strictly a precaution in this case.  There was a lot of clearance, and Bay 16 was only half full.  Lots of room.   Plus, the gravitation field in the bay had been turned off for this operation.  Gravity complicated everything.   Slowly the arm descended with the package.  Effortlessly it placed it on the floor.   Its a big one, isnt it? Greels said.   Seal heard the words through his Tingle hat.  They seemed to hover just above his ear.  Is this the whole science facility? he asked.  Everything?  All that was left, Greels said.  Im not sure how much compression they applied prior to packaging.  I assume it was vacuum-packed.  Greels raised an eyebrow.  Theyre planning on reconstructing elsewhere?  Reconstructing and investigating, yes, Seal said.  Thats what I heard.  They have all the remaining evidence inside.  Behind where the package was placed was a long and almost ceiling-high row of previously stored bundles, all sealed in white.  This new addition would be the cap piece on the end.   Seal raised his left foot and checked the shoe.  Though it resembled a simple work boot, the Guild-customized Tingle was much more than that.  Aside from the field it helped maintain, it could be magnetized.  A blue light on the side indicated the magnet was on.  He checked the right foot.  It was on, as well.  Okay, he said, nodding.  Make it slide.   Each Bay had an overhead control room that received the Tingle-band.  Usually the controllers were responsive, but sometimes they just slept.  Controllers saw only a bit more action during transit than pilots did.  Seal was relieved to hear Friction neutralized, Captain.   He nodded, and together he and Greels approached the near side of the rescue package.  With no gravity and the floors friction removed, they were able to easily slide it back into position.  Together they checked to see that it was properly centered.  Very little room was left between it and the packages on the adjacent rows, but very little was needed.   It was an almost perfect fit.  Seal smiled.  Efficient use of space.   Greels met him at the front of the package.  He was frowning and shaking his left hand.   Seal grinned.  What is it? he asked.  Pinch a finger? They both wore gloves, after all.  Finger damage tended to be minimal during loading operations.  Thanks to Tingle wear, all damage tended to be minimal.   Greels flexed his hand.  Shook it again.  Felt cold to me.   Seal grimaced.  The package? Tingle gloves allowed some temperature differences through.  Some sense of touch was deemed helpful, so it was configured in.  Never enough to bring discomfort, though.   Yeah, it felt cold, Greels said.  Did it feel cold to you?  Seal shook his head.  Didnt notice, no.  Space is awful cold, though.   Greels glanced up at the package.  Supposed to be insulated for space, right? Large packages.  They shouldnt absorb it or radiate it.   Seal shrugged.  I know the cryo unit isnt in there.  He nodded upward.  Should be coming in on a slide soon.  It is small enough.  Overhead, the loader had withdrawn, and now the door had begun to close.  As he watched, the comets tail was obscured, followed by the suns, and then space altogether.  A few moments later, yellow ceiling lights began to flash.  Gravity returned, and the latticework of slides descended over the rows of containers.  He and Greels moved away as slides fell into position near them.   Far above, toward the center of the ship, Seal thought he saw movementthe placing of a package on the slide.  Ah, he said.  I think this is it now.           The cryomatrix was rectangular and stood a meter higher than Seal.  It was two meters wide, and about the same in depth.  As per shipping specs, it was completely white-sealed, but it had a removable inspection flap on the top end.   Seal had requested the onboard medical official meet them in Bay 16.  It was a requirement for all living cargo.  Thankfully, she was prompt.   The med officials name was Darly.  She was a slight woman, Asian in descent, and she carried a square medicinal assistant in one hand.  She was outfitted in a medical variant of the Guild uniform, grey where it otherwise would be blue.  Instead of the Guild bird glyph on her shirt, there was a squiggle that, to some, suggested a snake.  Seal just saw a squiggle.   Greels was still present as well.  The package had yet to be pushed back to its final storage place.  Greels had to be there for that.  Union rules.   All the Tinglewear had been removed and stored, though.  Seal was glad about that.   Darly spent a few minutes just walking around the package.  It appeared she was looking for any breaks in the exterior wrap.  It was the same procedure he and Greels had already followed, but he guessed it was proper.  If nothing else, it showed she was a good Guild employee.   Is it all right? he asked.   Darly looked at her medicinal assistant and then at him.  Nodded.   Seal glanced at Greels, who just shrugged.  So, do you want us to open the window? Seal asked.   Darly leaned forward and squinted at part of the packages front exterior, twisted her lips, checked the assistant, and nodded again.   Seal approached one side of the package, while Greels walked around to the other.  Theres a pull strap on the top there, Greels said.   Seal found the four centimeter strap and gave it a tug.  The side of the exterior wrap split open with a pop.  He put his fingers in and loosened the flap all the way to the front.  Greels met him in the middle and together they folded the cover back.   Seal found himself face to face with the occupant.   Her eyes were closed as if she were sleeping.  Thankfully.  The last thing Seal wanted was someones vacant eyes staring out at him.   Her hair was long, dark, and straight.  Her head was bowed slightly, and her skin color was a bit lightcommon for those in cryobut otherwise she looked perfectly normal.  There was no sign of injury.  Only her head and shoulders were visible, however.   Greels took a spot to Seals left, a few paces back.  And Darly behind him.  Shes beautiful, Greels said.  Like an ice princess.   Darly just made a hunh sound and started looking at her med pad again.   Shes frozen, Greels, Seal said.  A scientist, presumably.  A survivor.  He nodded toward the mammoth package theyd already placed, not three meters behind.  Of whatever happened in there.   Greels stared at the woman, eyes wide.   Greels.  Frozen!  Huh? Greels looked at him.  Frowned.  Yes, I know.  I get that.   Seal sniffed.  So you cant date her.  Shes not coming out.  Shes just a shipment.   Greelss eyes flared.  I know, Captain.  I got it.   Good.   Darly stepped in front of Seal and got up on tiptoes to look at the woman and then the area inside.  She waved her assistant over the window, checked it again, and walked around to the side of the container.  There was a narrow strip of indicator lights there, which she squinted at.  Matrix appears to be fine, Captain, she said.  Working perfectly.   Seal nodded.  So, shes safe.  Sleeping tight.   Darly returned the nod.  Yes, she should require no further supervision.   Do you detect an injury? he asked.  A sign of trauma?  Darly nodded.  Matrix says she has some burns.  On her legs.  And some lacerations.   But thats it? Seal said.  Doesnt sound significant enough for He squinted at the cryomatrix, frowned.  You know.   Those burns would hurt a great deal, Darly said.  And it is not that uncommon for SciCon.  They are sticklers.  She flashed a smile.  I should know.  I used to work for them.   I see.  Seal glanced at Greels.  His eyes were still on the girl.  Seriously, Greels.  Have you never seen a female before?  Greels didnt budge.  Yes, just never one like this.  One so  Incapacitated? Unable to resist? To reject? What?  A grimace.  Beautiful.  I think shes lovely.   Ive heard that.  Seal looked at Darly, but she was focused on her assistant again.   Like putting a diamond in a cardboard box.   Were shippers, Greels.  We do that all the time.  Another glance at Darly.  Still occupied.  Seal approached the cryo and put a hand under the detachable flap.  Im going to close this back up.   Okay, Greels said, sounding disappointed.   Seal just continued the process, pushing the flap into place across the front.  When he reached the halfway point, he gasped and quickly drew back his hand.   What is it, Boss?  Seal peered at the face of the woman, watched her for many moments without speaking.   Sir? Darly said.   Seal scratched the back of his head, frowned.  He lightly touched the flap, almost expecting it to be either hot or cold.  He was surprised to find it was neither.  Just simple room temperature.  He quickly slid the flap over her face.  Continued until the process was complete.  Okay, he said.  You can push it back.   Greels nodded and reverently placed his hands on the sides of the package.  Eased it back a few steps to join the row of white.   Thats it, then.   Seal thanked Darly for coming.   This time she was staring at him, though.  Are you well? she asked.   Of course.  He motioned to the clearly-marked exit door.  Waved at Greels.  Just like any other day.   What he didnt want to admit, though, was what he thought he saw as he closed the flap.   For an instantfor a tiny fraction of a secondhe thought the patients eyes were open.           After the stop at the Maple System, Congi began his usual rounds of the storage bays.   Congis official title was Maintenance Supervisor, but that was only a fraction of what he really did.  He liked to think of himself as a finder.  Every bird in the fleet had at least one finder on board: a man or woman who filled in the cracks.  Someone who made things work a little smoother.  Greased the wheels.   In a typical cross-system transit, there were thousands of packages.  Millions of items.  A nearly incomprehensible amount of objects that could be misplaced or damaged.  Some might even split a seal and become partially emptied.  Many of those things were exceedingly valuable.   All of those things were valuable to someone.   So Congi took it on himself to locate things, and for a price, return them to their rightful owners.  Or barring that alternative, to other people that wanted to be the rightful owner, those who had more credits to spend.  Like Danielle and her science-loving nephew.   He had to be cautious about his finding, though.  There was a slim percentage of loss that was allowed for every journey.  He had to watch that percentage and not exceed it.  Make sure they always came in just below it.  Otherwise, someone might be suspicious.  Start an investigation.   Hed heard the latest pickup had gone to Bay 16, and that the number of packages were few.  The rumor was that at least one was a large item, and was classified as miscellaneous technical supplies.  That got his interest.  The larger the package, the better the chance that something would be lost.  And technical supplies were always in demand.   Congis standard equipment was a rectangular cart that held tools, cleaning supplies, and a small circular waste incinerator.  His cart hovered, so it was easily maneuverable around the ships slideways and elevators.  The only place he couldnt take it was the pilots bubble, but there was no reason for him to go there.  Those two rarely left their station, anyway, and the chances of them losing something was small.  Besides, he didnt like to be reminded that he was in space.  That others were in control.   Currently, Congi was in Bay 18.  It was best to take time when getting to the new arrivals.  Bay 18 was completely full, and had been for some time.  It was twenty long rows of packages, stacked tightly from floor to very near the ceiling.  The aisles between rows were narrowbarely wide enough to allow his floating cart to pass through.   Congi slowly circled the rows.  He occasionally stopped and picked up a bit of sealant or packing material that he saw stuck in some out-of-the-way crevice.  He threw the material in the incinerator and watched it flash and grow silent.  Always his eyes were scanning, though.  Looking for something he might have missed before.   At one turn he noticed that one of the topmost packages had a dented corner and a slight tear.   Thats too bad.  He removed a metal wrench from his cart, weighed it in his hand, And its too bad they have to go up so high.  He scowled.  Makes life difficult.  Sometimes he caught a break and cleaned a bay when the gravity field was down.  Then he had free rein.  But that rarely happened.  Gravity tended to keep things in place, so it was the norm.  Sadly.   He gave the wrench a hard throw toward the damaged package.  The wrench connected with a thunk and split the seal tear a bit more.  He caught it and tossed it again, and againand again.   After a dozen throws, Congi was rewarded with an opening large enough that something fell out.  Something wrapped in plastic.  It trickled down, bouncing off the edges of lower packages until it finally reached the floor near his feet.   Congi took out a red handkerchief, wiped his browmade a quick check of the areaand bent down to retrieve the item.  It contained six pairs of socks, all of them green with brown stripes.  Congi studied the exterior plastic for a moment.  The size was right.  Not sure about the color, though.  It hardly went with his blue pants.   He shrugged and tucked the socks away inside the rack.  His rule: Never leave a found item behind.  Someone would want it.           It was a full hour before Congi arrived at Bay 16.  He paused outside the sliding metal door.  It was closed, which wasnt unusual.  Nor did it bother him.  He had a passkey for every bay on the ship.  Part of the job description.   There was a large sign next to the door that identified it as Bay 16 in white letters.  Noting a dark smudge, Congi brought out a white cleaning rag and a spray bottle.  He worked the sign over, spraying and wiping until it gleamed.  When finished, he made another quick check of the area, shrugged, and brought out his passkey.  He slid it into the slot marked with a yellow arrow next to the door.  There was a hum, a click, and the door slid back.   Congi was surprised to find the bays lights on at full potential.  Typically, the lights were dimmed when no active loading was in process.  It wasnt the first time hed seen the lights left on, but it was the first time in quite some time.  Since Captain Drake had taken command, actually.   Bay 16 still had a fair bit of room left.  It was about three quarters full, with the rows nearest the door being vacant.  Beyond that, though, rows stretched as far as he could see.  The nearest full row was a good walk away.   He would have to work to look busy until he got there.  Reaching into his rack, he brought out a backpack cleaner and hefted it over his right shoulder.  From the bottom of the cleaner a long nozzle extended.  On it was a large on/off switch, which he flipped, bringing the cleaner to life.  His initial instinct was to turn left and make his way toward the interior part of the baywhere the new stuff would doubtless be placed.  But he turned right instead and began casually sweeping the corners along the nearest bay wall.   He had taken maybe thirty steps when he felt a hand on his shoulder.  He startled and quickly turned the sweeper off.   Theres nothing here for you, Congi.   Greels This was the loading supervisor Congi least liked.  Though Greels sometimes looked the other way, he didnt do so often enough.  Not nearly enough.   Congi shrugged.  Im just cleaning here.  I heard we got a new shipment.  Figured the bay would need cleaning.   Greels frowned, shook his head.  Well, it doesnt need your type of cleaning.  Not here.   Congi studied Greels, noticed the supervisor had a sunken look to his eyes.  As if he hadnt slept in a few days or had been working long shifts.  The last load shouldnt have required those sort of hours, though.  Not with just two packages.  Something was amiss.  You all right? Congi asked.   Greels scowled.  Of course Im all right.   Congi sniffed.  Well, you look beat, man.   Thats because I work for a living.   Congi pushed out his chest.  What do you mean by that?  Exactly what I said.   Congi pushed his cart a few steps back then drifted toward the first row.  He glanced that direction.  So what came in? he asked.  Anything special?  Ill say it again, Greels said.  Nothing for you.   He took a few more steps.  Still might need cleaning, though, right?  Greels moved to block the cart.  No, it doesnt.  Were talking accident remains here, Congi.  Nothing but burnt-out science junk.  Investigative seal.  Now get out.   Congi gripped the side of his cart, leaned his weight against it.  Awful grumpy there, boss.  Think you might need a nap.   Greels grabbed the cart, began to turn it toward the door.  Faked a laugh.  I dont need no nap, thief, now get your stuff out of here.   Congi didnt like anyone touching his cart.  It was a violation of personal space.  Of ownership.  Even by higher ups.  He contemplated raising the stakes, pushing back, but decided against it.  He could be patient.  He could wait.  Fine, Greels, he said.  Ill leave.   That seemed to surprise Greels.  His eyebrows rose and his voice softened.  Good, Congi.  Thats all I ask.  Just leave this bay alone.  A smile.  Lots more bays out there, right? Lots more lost packages.   Congi pushed toward the door.  Didnt look back.  Just moved on ahead.  Thats right.  Theres other things to clean.  Lots of other things.   For now      5    Seal was at his desk again, digital ledgers open, when the perimeter of the malleable surface began to flash red.  Frowning, he pushed the ledgers aside and touched the flashing ring.  The screen changed to the image of Crewmember Singer.   It was a not altogether unpleasant change.  She had her blond hair down today, with only a regulation Guild-branded hairclip to keep it in place.  Her blousethe only other portion of her outfit that was visible at the momentwas the pin-striped variety.  She looked very classy.  Competent.   Typically interruption brought a frown, but this one Seal could smile for.  Good to see you again, Singer.  Judging by the ring color, I assume this is an emergency message not requiring face-to-face.   Singer smiled, showing brilliantly white teeth.  Thats correct, Seal.  Just off the SB.  By wire approved.   Seal rested his chin in his hand.  Except we are speaking face to face, crewmember.   Not according to regulations.  This is by wire, utilizing the image option.   He smiled.  I find the designation less than satisfactory today.  Dont you?  Singer flushed.  So would you like me to remove the option, sir?  Oh, no, dont you dare.  He waved.  Just making conversation.   Her smile returned.  Very good.  Option continued then.   Yes, option continued.  A smile.  Option welcome, in fact.   Another blush.  Wellumthank you, sir.   Seal.   Yes, Seal.  Her head lowered so the light glinted off her hairclip.   Seal continued to smile.  Sothe transmission.  Another emergency? I was under the impression that there werent any pickup stations between Maple and Obelisk.  Seal pushed Singers image to one side and pounded the icon for the station list.  The impact was such that a ripple played across the desks surface.  The station list book opened, and with a series of finger pokes he was able to get it to sort by relative distance from their current position.   Seal?  He held up a finger.  He studied the list, sighed, and finally rested his chin in his hand.  Yes, it is as I suspected.  There are no stations from here on out.  Your transmission must be invalid.  A clerical error.   Singer shook her head.  It is quite authentic.  I double checked.  It isnt a mistake.  Not a neutron bounce  But did they send it to the wrong ship? Ive seen that happen.  New dispatcher comes in, gets her birds confused.  He snapped his fingers.  This ship has a sister shipthe Crow.  Maybe it is theirs?  Singers face flushed.  Captain, with all due respect, youre acting as if I dont know my job.   Seal sensed a fire coming.  Those were never good.  Thankfully, he was an expert at handling fires.  He made a calming motion.  My apologies, Crewmember Singer.  Im sure you performed competently.  Im sure you always do.   That seemed to soothe her.  She closed her mouth, squinted her eyes as if thinking, and smiled again.  Then what are you saying?  Seal shrugged.  Im not sure anymore.   That brought a pleasant laugh.  He had to admit, he admired Singers laugh.  He wondered if she might want to walk with him again.  Perhaps around the whole bay circuit? Stem to stern? It occurred to him that maybe he spent too much time holed up in this office.   Singer shook her head, cleared her throat, and glanced at something to her left.  Seal, this actually is quite important.  A certified emergency.  A between-station pickup.   Seal straightened in his chair.  Between-station? Now that is unusual.   Singer nodded.  Unusual.  Yes.  A colony in need of evacuation.   Evacuation? You mean with crowds of people, and woundedand children running about?  Singer raised an eyebrow.  You dont like children?  No, I.  Seal scratched the side of his face.  He felt a trace of facial hair.  Realized it had been a month since his last regulation-approved follicle annulment.  He quickly tapped a section of the table, had a blue note appear, and scrawled Beard/Obelisk on it with a finger.  How many people are we moving then?  Singers eyes averted again, clearly reading from another window.  The colony has been established for decades, she said.  But it has been labeled cloistered.  So any numbers I can give you are based on infrequent passing surveys.  Speculation and approximation.   Cloistered? By which they mean, Leave us alone.  And now they want help.  It figures.  He grimaced.  Made their bed and A head shake.  So, how many?  Could be hundreds, Singer said.  Plus livestock.   Livestock! Are you sure this isnt a joke? I mean Seal chuckled.  I had a friend once, Talken, who would do that sort of thing.  Send flowers to dentists, and the like.  Most people dont see our work as exciting.  Perhaps someone is trying to loosen things a bit?  No.  I dont think so.  I think this is quite real.  Quite necessary.  Drones are showing drastic changes to the colonys primary star.  It appears it is moving out of the main stage.  Becoming unstable.   Unstable? How inconvenient.   Singer nodded.  Do you want me to give you the whole report?  This was going to be an involved operation.  Possibly the most involved pickup Seal had ever overseen.  Livestock? There had to be an award in this.  He glanced at the walls near his door, where his collection of framed commendations hung.   There was some usable space onboard, of course.  As long as it was being paid for, it might as well be filled.  No, he said.  Id like to convene a meeting.  A smile.  Stay where you are, Im going to bring the heads all together.  He frowned, stared at the edges of his desk.  Now I know I can do that here.  It has been awhile  Intradesk meeting? Singer said.  Dont worry, Ill step you through it.   Seal smiled.  You can do that? Very good.  You are better than adequate, Singer.   Thank you sir, here we go          A few minutes later Seal had the images of Loading Supervisor Greels, Medical Officer Darly, Pilot Perth, and Crewmember Singer all neatly positioned on his desk in the form of a square.  At first he experimented with a strictly left to right horizontal ordering of their faces based on rank, but since that crowded out the important vertical edges of the desk, he attempted a diagonal arrangement, before finally settling on the square.   Squares were good.  Efficient.  He approved of squares.   Now, as Singer just got through saying, Seal said, we have a major schedule change ahead of us.  A certified emergency.   Greelss face occupied the lower left corner.  Emergency? he said, scowling.  Are we cleared for that sort of thing? Isnt that for rescue corps, or something? His hair was standing out of place in spots, and there was an extra bit of whiteness to his skin tone.   Up late playing cards again, Seal assumed.  It was a common ailment among those in the loading pool.   We are the closest and most logical choice, Singer said.  There are no other alternatives.  She was bottom right.   Seal nodded.  The colony founders apparently purchased rescue insurance.  Their plea came through a sanctioned and validated beacon.  The Guild already holds the credits.   The rescue was paid for in advance? Greels said.   Yes, Seal said.  At the time, such a plan was offered.  I doubt many colonial insurance companies do so now.  Not after StanCon went bankrupt.  Not since the loss of the Ash system.   Pilot Perth had a hand on his chin and appeared to be in regulation blue.  His rank demanded top left, of course.  But this is a one-planet evac, correct? he said.  Only one stop? Not a whole solar system.   Thats correct, Seal said.  No surprises there.   Perth stroked his chin.  So what surprises are there?  Seal couldnt help but look at Singers image.  Hed just had a similar conversation with her while organizing the meeting.  Well he said.  Theyre Amish.   Puzzlement on three out of the four faces.  Amish? Darly said.  Is that a genetic anomaly or infectious disease?  Singer chuckled.  No.  They are a religious group.  They shun technology, she said.  And outsiders.  Englishers, they call us.   Perths head shifted, as if repositioning himself in his chair.  Curious.  They dont use technology but they are okay with being picked up by someone using technology?  Yes, apparently thats on us, Seal said.  On our consciences, not theirs.  They would just be passengers, after all.  Not operating machinery.   Greelss face filled with color.  So it is okay if we burn in hell, he said.  Just not them.   Singer shook her head.  I dont think they think of it that way.  They make decisions based on community.  How the use of things affects the whole group.  Affects their cohesion.   Community? Greels snorted.  Ill give them community.  Let them move their own stuff!  That will be the end of that attitude, Greels, Seal said, letting ice fill his voice.  Youre under contract, and if I see any of that leaking into your subordinates  Yeah, yeah, Captain, I hear you.  Greels shook his head.  Probably out of line.  But you gotta admit, it is an arrogant position.   We arent here to judge beliefs, Singer said.  Just to fulfill the companys obligation.   Seal smiled, bowed his head to the bottom right corner.  Well said, Singer.  Thats exactly the case.   Darly looked worried.  I dont have the staff for this, she said.  What if theyre sick or wounded? There is just me and my assistant.   There shouldnt be many injuries, Singer said.  We have time.   Darly was all but vibrating with anxiety.  But with such a backwards people! Theyll need vaccinations, complete physicals The dental hygiene alone will keep us occupied until Obelisk.   Dental hygiene? Singer said.   They probably dont have dentists.  Darly frowned.  Do they have dentists? We inoculate against tooth decay now.  She shook her head.  Im not a dentist.   Seal raised a hand.  Relax, he said.  We have others with aid training, Seal said.  Enough that we can manage, I think.   Im one, actually, Singer said.   Seal smiled.  See there  No, no, Darly said.  We have barely enough for us to handle the accidents of the crew.  Clumsy loaders and  Hey! Greels said.  Weve had weeks without incident.  Twenty two days, seven hours, to be precise  And in one day you brought us five, Darly said.  Smashed hands and suit failures.  We could barely handle  Seal slammed both hands on the table.  A double wave of ripples.  Enough, he said.  Were doing this, and were going to do it well.  He looked at the bottom left image.  Greels, prepare your men for whatever we might have to move.  Every shuttle will need to be stripped and prepared to load these people and their animals and belongings.  No complaints, no whining.  He shook a finger.  We finally have something to do.  Your people should be happy.   Greels frowned but nodded his compliance.   Seal looked at top right.  And Darly, youll be fine.  Well take it as it comes.  If we have to, well convert a portion of one of the microbays into an extended facility for your use.  You can conscript from the crew if you need to.  We have lots of bored people in cubicles you can have.   Darly seemed to calm a bit.  The vibrations stopped.  She nodded finally.   Fires, always fighting fires.   Pilot Perth just looked amused.  His hand was still at his chin, with a smile leaking through between spread fingers.   Do you have something to add, Perth? Seal asked.  Any problem with the pickup?  Perth pursed his lips, shook his head.  Not at all, Captain.   Seal squinted.  The pilot was thinking about something.  Mulling it over.  So youre okay? he asked.  One of you two might get conscripted to medical.   Perth flipped his hand.  Been awhile since I wrapped a limb, but thats fine.   So what are you thinking about?  Perth shook his head.  Just trying to digest it all.  So, these Amish are a cloistered, low tech people.  Why would they be used to colonize planets? Wouldnt that put them especially at risk? No blaster, no guns He turned up a hand.  No medical technology.   Seal shook his head.  I would think so.  Theyve been used for colonies more than once, though.  A shrug.  Politics is beyond my station.   If I may, Captain, Singer said.  I think it makes good sense.  A culture devoid of technology wouldnt be able to use it as a crutch.  I cant imagine a better society to be dropped onto a newly terraformed planet than one who has so few dependencies.  For instance, they would know how to build habitation from whatever materials they could find.  Eke out an existence with the barest of requirements.   Perth nodded.  Yes, that may be so.   You still look like youre thinking about something, though, Seal said.   Perth brought his hand to his chin again.  Well, despite the cultural description, one thing is for certain.   Whats that?  Someone on that planet doesnt fully share that view.  Someone there activated the beacon that called us.  So who is that?          Seated at the small desk in his office, Greels watched as the images of the other three meeting participants winked out of existence: plip, plip, plip.  He frowned, leaned back, and ran a hand through his greying hair.  Exhaled loudly.   Glad thats over.   His eyes searched the room.  It was a small, dingy place, only a short slideway from both Bay 10 and Bay 12.  The location was convenient for his work, as it was essentially in the middle of it all.  Medical was close.  But this was barely an office.  Just four grey walls, a desk, and a floor-standing waste incinerator.  His only wall decoration was a fading color map of the ships bay positions and the slideways that serviced them all.  He didnt even have a guest chair.  No family photos.   Why do I stay at this job?  Greels rose from his desk and felt a wave of fatigue.  He yawned, stretched, and attempted to shake it off.  To no avail.   He walked to the door and out into the narrow hall.  The hall was cheerless: white, with an occasional yellow directional arrow to break up the monotony.  He turned right, following the arrows toward the nearest slide entry point.  He had almost reached it when an intern hustled up behind him.   Sir, I have a duty roster for you to look over.  The intern was short, male, and wearing a uniform that looked like it had just come out of the wrapper.   In general, Greels loathed the type.  It isnt important now, he said.  Ill look at it later.   But sir  Greels waved and purposely turned his back, heading in the direction he wanted to go.  He knew the intern was still there though, doubtless with a surprised look on his face.  Not important, he repeated, without looking back.  Greels smiled and continued his walk.   Let the intern find one of the assistants.   A few minutes later Greels reached the entrance to the feeder slideway, and rode it from his lower level office to one of the primary slideways.  From there he rode past first one bay and then another.  He felt a certain bit of pride as he surveyed the completed bays.  Aside from the automated slide loading, filling a bay to capacity was still a lot of work for his team.  Especially given all the guaranteed breaks and shift changes.  It was a constant fight against distraction for most of them.   Then there were the leeches like Congi.  Always adding to the spoilage and loss.   I should just report the mooch and get him reassigned.  Make him someone elses problem.   Finders like that always had connections higher up, though.  Better just to ignore them.  Let them get their small pickings.  At least Congi was fairly discreet about it.  Plus, occasionally he threw bones Greelss way.  Usually when Greels really needed it.  That wasnt altogether bad.   He saw the signs for Bay 16 ahead.   It was late, close to midnight by ships time.  He should be off duty.  Getting cleaned up and going to sleep.  Tomorrow would be a busy, busy day.  His quarters were on the opposite side of the ship, in the section reserved for the loading pool.  Not with the other group supervisors near the front of the ship, but in back with the losers and the rowdies.  He hated that too.  The place smelled of safesmoke and free-alch.  And whatever synthetic recreation the consumer splice groups had designed lately.   The exit for Bay 16 was just ahead now.  Greels frowned as the slide started to slow.  Then the walls became solid.  The overhead sign indicated that this was the stop for Bays 14 and 16.  Greels set his gaze ahead, decided not to look at the actual landing as he slid slowly by.  Maybe that would help.   It didnt, though.  He had slid only a few paces past when he found himself backpedaling against the slides motion and stepping onto the landing itself.  He frowned as he took the stairs from the landing down to the Bay 16 floor.  He shouldnt be here.  He should be on his way to his quarters.   But inside there was a tingle of expectancy.  A thrill of the moment.  Of the strangeness and hazards of it.  A need that he never knew he had.  Until now.  Until this trip.   He reached the entrance to the bay.  It was completely silent and empty.  Just the locked sliding door.  The bay itself should be silent too.  Silent and dark.  Greels took out his passkey and slid it into the verification device.  Somewhere, that use would be noted, he knew.  Logged and stored.  Loading supervisors didnt need excuses for entering a bay, though.  If he had lesser rank, maybe.  But not him.  It was his job to verify that loads stayed intact.  Whenever and wherever he wanted.   He still felt a twinge of guilt when the door slid open.  Guilt and excitement.   The lights inside were dim, as they should be.  The handplate for those were to his left by the door.  He adjusted the lights up to half potential, frowned at how dim it still seemed, and adjusted them up again.   The stacks of packages were before him.  White, pristinereminded him of childhood winters on Betalus.  How strange that even the darkest secrets, the worst of someones garbage, looked better when wrapped in white.   Just like your first wife, he said aloud, and chuckled.   The laugh lasted only a short time, though.  It seemed almost sacrilegious.  Out of place here.  Now.   No joking in here from now on.  What if she hears?  He walked slowly toward the end of the nearest row.  Stood before the white-wrapped package containing the cryogenics matrix.  He didnt even bother to look around.  There was no one else in the bay.  Just him and the woman.   He stood for some time staring at the white monolith.  From a few paces away, it seemed cold to him.  As if it was filled with snow.  Filled with the white fluff that covered over the sins.  The garbage.  It was a cryomatrix, after all.   Finally, he moved forward and released the inspection flap.  He gently, lovingly, freed it all the way along the matrixs top surface.  There was no coolness to the contact, though.  Not like the package containing the science facility remains.  That was abnormally cold.  It had been cold when hed first helped move it, and it doubtless still was, despite having been in storage for days now.   Greels hadnt mentioned that phenomena to anyone, though.  Since Seal hadnt felt itwell, no reason to look strange.  No reason to draw attention to himself.  Or to Bay 16.  Besides, Greels admitted to having some circulation issues.  Too much vacuum exposure.   But the womansthe ladyscontainer was different.  Cold inside, probably.  But outside, warm and smooth.  Clean.  Inviting.  Wonderful.   With the flap pulled back, he was able to study her face again.  The full pout of her lips.  The gentle curve of her cheeks.  The subtle hint of cheekbones.  Long jet black hair.  He could tell she was different from the other women hed known.  Different from his first and second wife.  Prettier, smarter.  Doubtless more understanding too.  The perfect woman.   Where was she from again? A failed science outpost?  You must be a tough one, princess, he whispered.  What went wrong? What did you see?  No response.   Greels frowned.  He was in love with her, even if hed never heard her speak.  Never even seen her move.   He would like to see her move.   Should he wake her? Free her from eternal slumber? Would he even know how to do that?  He thought of the buttons and lights on the right side.  The labels meant nothing to him.  Hed already looked.  Studied them.  They were too technical for his taste.  There was a green Resume button, but who knew what that did?  Dr.  Darly knew what they all meant, of course.  She could break the seal.   Greels studied the womans face.   No, I dont want you to do that, he imagined her saying.  Release me, and Ill melt.  Just like the ice.  Just like the snow on your mothers porch.   Greels nodded.  Continued to watch.  Continued to admire her face.   Hours passed.       6    The meeting was at Bishop Samuels house.  Samuel sat at one end of the long dining room table, Jebediah at the other.  Between them were four men.  On Jebediahs left were young Deacon Mark and new Deacon James.   On the other side, Jebs right, was Abrahama middle-aged peer of Jebsand Jebs young friend Ezekiel.  Most of the men looked stern and resolute.  Ezekiels head hung over the table though, seemingly conflicted and sad.   All had beards of differing lengths.  All wore white shirts with suspenders and dark pants.  All had brought their dark hats, but those were placed on the table before them.   Jebediah had always known this day would come.   I have spoken with your wife, Jebediah, Samuel said.  My congratulations on your upcoming child.  It is a sign of Gods favor He forced a smile.  Despite whether we deserve it or not.  Despite our failings.   Jebediah nodded.  Danki.  I agree on all counts.   Samuel pushed his hat back and placed his hands on the table.  Brought his hands together.  That now said, we have a difficult issue to face.  I wanted to make sure we understand the facts.   Jebediah nodded.  Im glad.  Grateful you thought enough of me to  Samuel held up a hand.  Gelassenheit is everything here, among us, he said.  Without it, we wouldnt have survived this planet.  Never been able to subdue it.  Never been able to thrive.  To build homes and families.   Jebediah nodded.  I know that, he said.  And again, I agree.  My intent was to practice Gelassenheit.  To serve and protect our community.   Samuel nodded.  We can assume your intentions were sound.  He looked at the others.  Everyone present has benefited from your dedication.  Your charity.  He frowned.  However, we have rules to follow.  They are based on the principles of Holy Scriptures and the traditions of our forefathers.  All share a common goal: to live in an ever closer relationship with God and our fellow man.  To dispel the sins of pride and envy, and to cultivate a more humble and Christlike spirit.   Jebediah noticed the grain in the wood of the bishops table.  There was a large knot in the board directly in front of him.  He wanted to reach out and circle it with his fingers, but he resisted.  I understand.   Most of the men were watching him.  Only Ezekiel sat with head bowed, eyes fixed on his own outstretched and folded hands.  His cheeks were flushed.   Very good, Samuel said.  So you understand that the use of electrical appliances is forbidden by the Ordnung.   Jebediah met Samuels eyes.  Yes.  I know that.   And do you admit to using such an appliance?  Jebediah shrugged.  Im not precisely sure what I used.  I mean, Im not certain it is electrical.  I did not connect it to any source of electricity.   Samuel frowned, glanced at the men nearest him.  From Ezekiels description, well assume it is electrical.   Ezekiel glanced his way and then returned to looking at the table.   Jebediah didnt blame him.  It was a beautiful table.  Must have taken weeks for the carpenter to make.  If it is electrical, Jebediah said, then yes, Im guilty.   Samuel nodded.  Very good.  The first step of correcting ones failure is recognizing it.  He straightened in his chair, drawing his hands back to the edge of the table.  Now, I must ask youis this an ongoing violation? Is this a habit in your life?  Jeb shook his head.  No.  It was just this one time.   Samuel looked relieved.  Nodded.  Thats good.  That makes the purpose of our meeting easier, though no less important.   Jeb nodded.  He reached for the table knot and put a finger on the middle of it.  Applied a little pressure.  Like pushing the activator  Do you repent? Deacon Marks face was serious but also understanding.  Young men usually understood a lot about temptation and sin.  They didnt know the half of it, of course.  It only worsened with age and became more complex.  More opaque.  Ezekiel probably understood better than most now.   Do you willfully turn from this sin? Mark asked.   Without question, Jeb didnt intend to touch the object again.  Once was enough.  I do, he said.   The men shook their heads in unison.   We accept your confession and your repentance, Bishop Samuel said.   Jebediah felt relief.  Regardless of what happened next, at least he wasnt an outcast.  At least he still had fellowship.   Deacon James scratched the side of his face, just at the beard line, and then smoothed the place with a hand.  James tended to keep his beard neater than most.  Like it was the one thing about his appearance he could actively control, and so he made it a priority.  Youve made this easier on us, Jebediah, he said.  We appreciate it.  A smile.  Often it is harder to be the one confronting sin than the one confessing it.   Jeb nodded.  I know thats true.  Hed sat in similar meetings in his day, confronting men for all manner of misdeeds.  It was never comfortable.   We have more questions, though, James said.  Purely as it pertains to our settlement.   Jeb glanced at the table.  At that large knot in the wood.  Yes?  This device you used, what does it do?  Jeb felt comfortable in the truth here.  The truth was his shelter.  I have no idea.   Bishop Samuel squinted.  You have no idea? he said.  I find that hard to believe.   Jeb just shook his head slowly.  It was given to me by my father, and to him by his father.   So this is a generational sin, Samuel said.  Like witchcraft.   The word gave Jeb pause.  He had little idea what it meant precisely, but the Scripture taught against it.  Equating it with a string of behaviors their group abhorred.  It was a responsibility, he said.  A responsibility borne for the sake of the community.   Samuel looked at the others.  Community? Yet none of us knew about it, Jebediah.  Not me in my old age, nor my father before me.  Your claim smells like wanton pride to me.   Jeb felt a touch of anger.  My father was an honest man.  A hardworking man.   Abraham nodded.  He was a good man, Samuel, he said.  You cant take that from him.  Very kind.   Samuel scowled.  But this hidden mission.  These secrets.  He thumped a hand on the table.  The devil loves secrets.   Deacon Mark nodded.  Ya, he does.  It is disturbing that such a thing would be hidden for so long.   But not used, Jebediah said, shaking his head.  Never used.   So why would you presume to use it now? Abraham asked.  Why now?  Jeb exhaled slowly.  I was given tests to do.  Procedures to follow.  Little things to look for.  I had almost forgotten, it had been so long.  But the crops  My crops? Ezekiel asked.  Is that what started all this?  Jeb shook his head.  All the crops.  Theyve been suffering for years.  We knew it.  He pointed around the table.  You all knew it, but nothing was said.  Nothing done.   What could we do? Samuel asked.  Relocate? It took decades of toil just to subdue this area.  To build our homes.  He hunched over the table, squeezed his hands together.  It isnt much talked about, but I know how it was.  This world was little more than a blank slate when we arrived.  Arable land, blue skies and waterbut little else.  The forests were minuscule compared to what we have today.  There was barely enough wood for houses and barns.   Lets not be negative.  We could do it again, Mark said.  Working together.  Wed just load up the wagons and go west or north until the growing is better.   Jeb stared at the table.  No, he said.  That wouldnt help.   Marks eyes widened.  Why not?  Because it is the sun thats wrong.  We cant outrun the sun.   What? Ezekiel said.  What is wrong with it?  Jeb shook his head.  It is changing.  The things that compose it are changing.  I have this piece of glass, a prism.  Using it, I can split the suns light.  See the individual elements that compose it.  Those are changing.   Looks of consternation.  How is that possible?  Our sun?  So thats why the crops  Jeb nodded.  Yes.  The light quality is changing.  We knew that, though.  You could see it.   So this machine of yours, Mark said, it can fix it somehow? The sun?  Samuel scowled.  Derr Herr made the sun.  How can man fix it?  Jeb took a deep breath.  Let it out.  I dont know.  I hope the device helps.  But I dont know.   So you dont know what it does? Samuel said.  This secret that has been kept for two generations.  And you dont know what will happen.   Jebediah forced a smile.  Thats right.  I dont know.   It may not do anything, James said, smiling.  Not a single thing.   It lit up, Ezekiel said.  It made lots of noise.   So what do we do? Mark asked.  Wait?  As always, we trust in the Lord, Jeb said.  And pray.           Congi was in a hurry.  There was a new shipment coming in, and the rumor was that it contained people this time.  Lots of people.  And farm animals.  There wouldnt be any finding in that.   Plus, the duty roster showed he was going to be reassignedaway from all the important bays.  His duty would be to clean Bay 17, the very place that was going to house all those new people.  And their smelly animals.  He didnt like smelly.   Hed been watching Bay 16 for days now.  Waiting for any opportunity to go inside.  Greels was the problem.  The guy seemed to always be there.  That only fueled Congis suspicion.  There must be something really good in there if the loading supervisor wanted to protect it so.  He was up to something.  Keeping something to himself.   Finally, Congi had a notion.  He remembered that Mart in security had access to some of the passkey logs.  So he paid Mart a visit.  It cost Congi a lot, more than he wanted to give, but he got what he was after.  The assurance that Mart would buzz him when Bay 16 was free of people.   Five minutes ago, Congi got the buzz.   Now he stood inside Bay 16, cleaning rack at his side.  The lights were at half potential.  Bright enough to work by but still dim.  That felt more comfortable somehow.   In front of him was the package in question.  The failed science one.  The remains of an accident or something? Regardless, it was a very large cube.  Lots of potential.  If it were placed in a house, it would fill an entire room.  It also appeared to be perfectly sealed.  Not a scrape or bump anywhere.  White and wrapped tight.  Smooth, smooth, and smooth.   Normally, he would give it a thorough going over.  Size it up from top to bottom and find the weakness.  There was always a weakness.  Expose it, find things, and reseal it again like new.  That was his way of operating.   Congi laid a hand on the packages side.  It felt oddly cool.  As if a refrigeration unit had cracked and was leaking coolant inside.  Hed have to be careful of that.   There were two problems with his normal methodology, in this case.  One, the front and back of the package were almost obscured, inaccessible, due to the packages around it.  He could attempt to climb atop the smaller package in front, but that would be hard work and might require he stand on his rack.  Never safe.  So he was left with only two sides he could fully inspect.   The big problem, though, was time.  He didnt have enough of it for any large operations.  Or for being subtle.  Greels could return at any moment.   Scowling, Congi bent over his rack.  He pulled out two instruments.  The first was flat, rectangular, mostly transparent, and fit easily between forefinger and thumb.  The other looked like a small blue plate with a raised handle portion on one side.   He placed the rectangle, a peeper as it was known in the trade, on the leftmost portion of the packages side at waist level.  He moved it slowly over the surface of the package, watching the transparent section.  The peeper wouldnt let him see the exact contents of the package, unfortunately.  What it did provide was space measurements.  Essentially, it told him how things were packed within.   He was searching for a spot that was emptier.  A place where he could safely cut through.  His first pass didnt find him anything.  Whatever was inside was pressed tightly against the side.  Not good.  He made another pass a little lower and got the same result.  Everything packed tight.   For a package that large, it might be necessary to not only see inside but to climb inside.   Congi shook his head, checked his com device.  No calls from Mart yet.  That was good.  Mart was watching the passkey scanners.  If anyone, Greels especially, started heading this direction, Congi would be notified, forced to flee.   A rush! He didnt like to rush.   Congi jogged around to the other side of the package.  He couldnt help casting a look toward the bays door along the way.  Even though it was fully shut, it made him nervous.  On this side of the package, his actions would be exposed to anyone who entered.   He stooped and placed the peeper on the package about a meter from the floor.  Right away, the screen flashed, indicating an open space beyond of about a meter and a half.  Congi smiled and brought up the circular toola small but precise molecular cutter.  It would not only sever the package wall, it would cut along molecular lines, saving details as it did so.  It made a perfect reseal possible afterward.  A wonderful, necessary finder tool.   Congi pressed a button in the handle, and a light near his thumb flashed green.  He made another quick pass with the peeper to make sure he knew the location of the open space and its extent in all directions.  Satisfied, he placed the molecutter on the package and began cutting.  Within minutes, he had a nice round hole large enough that he could fit his head and shoulders through.   He hurried to his rack and pushed it in front of the hole.  He returned the peeper and the cutter and brought out a flashlight.  Stooped and shined it into the hole.   It felt like opening an ancient tomb.  Congi could see shelving inside with lots of secured items.  Items that reflected the light.  Things made of metals and translucent materials.  Probably something in here for Danielles nephewand for himself, maybe.  And that was only what he could see directly ahead.  To the right was a separate section, almost like another chamber.  He could glimpse some large floor-standing machines there.   He wished he didnt have to be so quick.  Wished he had more time.  But that was the life of a finder.   He gathered a bag and a pair of gloves and pushed inside.           The Other noticed someone nearby.  It detected the activity and the slight change in ambient temperature.  It had been waiting, confined, for what seemed a very long time.  Fortunately, it had eaten well before it had been imprisoned.  It could survive for years in its present state.  Decades.   But it didnt want to just survive.  Survival was a goal for baser things.  For the things that crept, swam, and jumped.  It was not those.  Not anymore.   Over the course of days, the Other had been given reason to hope.  To expect.  First, there had been movement, and at brief intervals, light.  There had been visits.  Regular visits.  The Other felt those visits.  Reveled in them.   But always the entity was out of reach.  Always too far.   There was a new hope here.  Closer.  A new visitor.  One perhaps not so careful.  Perhaps not so reserved.  It would woo him.  Call him.   Then it would have him.           Congi crawled completely into the package, and sat hunched within.  It was a tight fit that made him wish hed skipped a few meals along the way.  There was nothing for that now, though.  Space was generally boring, delivery trips, generally long, and food was easy to come by.   He checked his com device for messages.  No messages yet.  He had more time.   He sat for a moment and tried to size it all up.  Scattered about the floor were some loose materialsawkwardly folded paper and some white cards.  The latter, he realized, were actually memory storage devices.  Part of a filing system of some sort.  He picked one up, touched the activation spot on the surface.  Nothing happened.  Broken or underpowered.  He tried another.  The screen on this one lit, but it was filled with complicated text and no pictures.  Science lingo.  Talk of trans-this, and splicing that.  Formulas.  Meaningless.  He frowned and cast it aside.   Directly in front of him were two white cabinets of some sort.  Both had doors.  Unfortunately, unless the doors slid, they would be difficult to open.  The cabinets were packed face to face and there was little room between them.  He managed to wedge a hand in, but he wasnt able to make the doors budge.  Frowned.   Smaller objects were preferable.  Things he could easily bag, carry, and sell.   Overhead was the bottom of another cabinet or a table or something.  There was nothing but smooth surface there and it extended a long way to his right, back toward the packages other end.  It was confining.   The remaining contents were packed in such a way that only a narrow crawlspace was available from where he sat to a deeper portion.  The portion that had looked like a secondary chamber was, he saw now, just a continuation of this space.   Arent there any small boxes here? Something I can just put a hand into?  Congi frowned.  Shook his head.  Shined the light on the crawlway again.   It looked really tight.  If he tried to go that way, he might even get stuck.  At the very least, it would be difficult to make a quick exit.  He contemplated giving up, calling it a night.  There would be other packages besides this one.  Maybe the people they were rescuing would have things other than ponies and quilts.   He felt a surge of anger.  Anger at the trouble hed gone to.  The stuff hed given Mart just to get this far.  And at Greels for making it all so difficult.   No.  He was going ahead.  Take it and bet it.  He would find something.   He got on all fours, grunting at how uncomfortable it felt.  He crawled ahead a few paces, until he reached a place where a metal rod stretched low in front of him.  No matter how hard he pushed, the rod wouldnt budge.  He would have to stoop lower.   He felt a stab of fear.  He wasnt afraid of confined places, obviously, but this was getting ridiculous.  What if he got stuck? What if he was found? Worse, what if he got stuck and was never found?  He shook his head.  No, youll be fine.  He felt a blast of courage, almost as if someone was patting him on the back, urging him ahead.  Just press on.  What you want is here.   Congi nodded and lowered to his belly.  He could make it if he just slid through.  He heard some of the memory cards flick across the floor as he moved his feet.  Felt one of them dig into his knee.  He winced and pushed with his toes.   His midsection moved.  The items on his right and left budged slightly.  Enough to give him more room.  He slid forward.  Finally broke through to a larger area, a place where nothing pushed against his back.  He brought his legs through and pulled them underneath him.  Even managed to sit up.  He shined the light around.  To his right was a piece of black machinery.  It had wide feet and dark legs.  Above that, it seemed to bend and swirl.  It reminded him of tightly wound piping or an exotic musical instrument.  Doubtless expensive, but much too large to move.   To the left of that was a transparent case of some sort.  It stood on four legs and there were cardboard boxes stuffed into the legs to fill the space.  Those boxes werent sealed, and they appeared to be within reach.  He also saw what he thought was a small refrigeration device.  The door stood slightly ajar.  Doubtless the source of the packages external coldness.   There were other devices here too, colored silver and bronze.  Corgi noticed black streaks on some of those.  There were also streaks on the floor and on a few of the wrapped items.  Something had caught on fire.  He also saw obvious water stains.  Something had spilled too.   The place was a mess.  No wonder they got shut down.  Packaged up.  Probably run by incompetents.  Government grant freeloaders.   Congi scooted forward and checked the boxes.  He found books in one.  He felt lots of ambiguous shapes in the other.  He managed to bring one of the smaller shapes out and shine his light on it.  It was a popular brand of holographic entertainment device.  He smiled and slid that into his bag.  Kept digging.  He found two similar devices and pocketed those too.   A portion of the floor near the refrigeration unit was damp.  Because of this, the third box was soggy.   Who packed this? he wondered.  Greels would skin them.  Such potential loss.   He slid forward a bit more, trying to put himself within reach of that third box.  He noticed for the first time a terrible smell.  Like something had gotten into the package and died.  Something large.  The smell was part rotten eggs, part animal carcass.  He fanned his face, but that didnt help much.  He fought off a feeling of sickness.   He shined his light on the refrigeration unit.  Had they even cleaned that out before packing it up? It appeared not.  Mustve been in a serious rush.   He noticed a change in the ambient lighta pulsingand froze for an instant.  He then realized his com device was flashing.  He shook his head, glanced at the screen, swore, and looked around him again.  Things were packed in so tight it would be difficult to turn.  But he had to.  He couldnt exactly back out.  And someone was on the way.   Congi moved his bag and light, attempted to pull his knees up and turn around.   He caught a whiff of the stench again.  Forced a cough.  Shook his head.  He managed to get partially turned, but his right hip stuck on something.  He shifted, pulled with all his might.   He heard glass break behind him.  He swore again.  Tried to see what it was, thought he recognized a broken bottle near the refrigeration device.  Swore again.   Maybe with all the previous spillage, no one would know.  The place was a mess already, right?  He finally freed himself and headed straight for the opening.   He heard another sound, something independent of his own movement.  He froze.  Listened.  Felt worry rise in his gut.  Stick in his throat.   Then he felt something else.  A presence.  An intelligence.  Something watching him.   It was too much.  He slid as fast as he could.  Dug his hands in.  Scratched and clawed his way forward.   There was pain on his hip again.  Sharp.  Probing.  Then on his lower back.  He panicked.  Dropped everything and pushed forward.  He had to get out.   Pain shifted to his upper back, his shoulders.  His neck.  He slapped at it and felt something snap.  Heard a crunch.  He checked his hand and saw a stain of red and green on his glove.  Remnants of a black body with lots of legs.   Things seemed to tumble in on him.  He lost the light.   Darkness followed.       7    There was a lot to be done.  Lots of numbers.  Lots of charts to maintain and update.  Calculations.  Organization and orders.  Seal was a master of such things, though.   At his desk, he worked like a madman.  Opening volumes, patching information, checking statistics.  Weight ratios.  He pulled up Greelss shift schedules.  Checked the bottom numbers.  Adjusted them slightly.  Slid them back Greelss direction.   He checked the report from medical.  Darly was nervous, as always.  The additional nursing recruits had helped some with that.  She was making progress in training them.  Shed also inspected Bay 17.  Felt it safe enough for their cargo.  Temporary wash facilities had been constructed, using warehoused plumbing supplies.  Fences for the animals.   There would be limits on the livestock theyd be transferring, obviously.  The amount of space they had wasnt endless.  But it would be enough, by regulations, for the settlement to ultimately survive on.  Until they got wherever they were going.   Seal queried the pilot bubble.  Perth arrived onscreen.  Face as unruffled as ever.   How much time do we have? Seal asked.   Less than 24 standard hours now, Perth said.  Twenty-two to near orbit, and another couple to reach shuttle range.  He smiled.  We could sit the whole Raven down, of course, if that would make things easier.   Egan appeared in the background, looking interested.  Looking like a whole ship landing would be the highlight of his trip.  Such landings were done on occasion.  They were generally messy, though, and required ledgers-more fuel.  Plus, it would mean exposing a nearly full shipment to whatever was below.  Planets generally had lots of dangers.  Even those without a shaky sun.   Not worth the risk, Seal said.  Well keep it in mind.  The star seems generally stable.  But if we have to rush  Perth nodded.  Understood.   Seal bobbed his head.  So, twenty-four hours then?  Perth nodded again.   Seal checked his virtual timepiece.  Not much time.   No.   Okay, lots to organize.  With a closing nod, Seal signed off.  This pickup was a mountain of details already.  That was in addition to his normal workload, the stressful task of captaining.   He thought of Singer again.  Snapped his fingers and queried her desk.   She appeared as attractive as ever.  Hair pulled back into a ponytail.  Controlled and active.  She wore the solid button-down crew shirt.  Polished and competent.  Just what he needed.   How are you today, Singer? he asked, smiling.   She returned the smile.  Fine, Seal.   Anything new from the SB?  Singer nodded.  Yes, I was just about to query you.  Theyve found a relocation planet for our future guests.  Another zoned low-tech.  Two systems from Obelisk.   Seal raised his eyebrows.  That was about as efficient as hed ever seen HQ.  A replacement already? Unbelievable.   Yes, isnt it? The policy must have included relocation expense.  A premium policy.  Doubtless costly.  Someone who was leaving all their possessions behind, perhaps?  Seal pushed Singers image to the side slightly.  Reached for another ledger.  One that showed their scheduled time in Obelisk.  Typically they followed a circular route.  These Amish would complicate matters.   Are you looking at our schedule? Singer asked.   Seal smiled.  Caught me, yes.  He sighed.  Just trying to predict what HQ will do with us after Obelisk.  What it will mean to the schedule.   Oh, we wont be delivering them, Seal.   No? Seal barely contained his relief.   No.  Their drop-off will be Obelisk.  The Crane will take them from there.   Oh.  Wonderful.   Singer smiled.  So relax.   He smiled again.  Dont take this the wrong way, but you are a delightful young lady.   Singer blushed, smiled again.  How could I possibly take that wrong?  Seal looked toward the ceiling.  Studied the lights.  I dont know, he said finally.  But it seemed the proper thing to say.  He brought Singers image front and center.  Studied her.  Singer, I would like to give you an additional responsibility.   Sir?  Seal frowned.   She smiled.  Seal? What responsibility?  He squinted.  You seem to have some empathy for these low techs.   Singer sat back slightly.  Adjusted her shirt.  Looked slightly embarrassed.  Why would you say that?  Im paid to notice details.  To organize them.   She looked down.  Smiled.  Yes, of course you are.  Right.   And you tend to defend them.  Their rights.   Singer shrugged.  I grew up on a farm.  Not an Amish farm, but on Newmarket.  We had a farm.   Livestock? Cows, pigs?  Some goats, is all.  Gener hybrids.   Seal nodded his head.  He kept a gener hybrida frog/lizard mixin an aquarium in his office.  A solitary pet.  Perfect.  Id like to put you in charge of the pickup, Singer.   Singers face flushed.  Me? But Im just the scraddle operator.   But there are others that can do that job.  At least one assistant.   We have two, actually.  An assistant and an intern.   Excellent.  So you are free for this.  Do you accept?  Youre asking me? Not ordering?  I wouldnt order something like this.  I just think youre qualified.   Singer looked thoughtful.  But I dont think Im in line for such a thing.  The promotion rules  Seal waved a hand.  Well throw the rules away this time.   I cant believe you said that.  A smile.   Me neither.  Seal studied his office again.  Realized for the first time that it had been unchanged for the whole time hed been onboard.  Same pictures, same awards.  Same frizard.  How strange.  Listen, there will be a lot of detail here, a lot of interpersonal interaction.  I will be involved, but I also have a ship to run.  I think a pickup like this needs a dedicated handler.  So will you do it? Can you? Id greatly appreciate it.   Singer nodded.  Okay, Seal.  I will.  Thank you.   Great, Seal said.  Ill assign the ledger to you.  Medical and loadingeverything except the pilots themselves.  All through you, all right?  Thats a lot, Seal.  Singer straightened, looked serious.  But okay.   Seal smiled.  Okay, I have to go.  More details to attend.  Thanks.   Seal put Singers image away, still smiling.  He frowned then, wondering if he had been too abrupt.  He thought for a moment, shrugged, and queried Greels.   The outer ring of his desktop pulsed blue as he waited.  Two, three, four, five pulses.  Seal frowned again.  It wasnt the first time Greels had been difficult to reach.  The ring froze blue, and then started pulsing again as it tried to reach Greels away from his desk.   It took four more pulses before Greelss face appeared.  He was clearly at one of the ships wall-mounted communication centers, though Seal couldnt tell which one.  One of the slideway intersections between bays, maybe? Greels still looked tired, and he had an arm partially in the picture.  He was leaned over the screen.   When did you sleep last? Seal asked.   Last night, Greels coughed.  Why?  No reason.  From the look of Greels, he probably smelled bad too.  Listen, I put Singer in charge of the Amish pickup.   Greels squinted.  The girl from the front? The stiff one?  Stiff? Since when was Greels discriminating? I needed someone to be a conduit.   Greels looked off-screen both directions.  As if distracted by something else going on.   Greels?  Greels glanced his way.  Yeah, thats all fine.  Ill work with her.   So, where are you?  What?  Seal sighed.  Where are you now?  Greels remained leaning against the screen, but pointed.  Near Bay 17.  You know, want to get that all ready.  Cleaned up.   Seal squinted at the image, thought the sign behind Greels read 16.  Frowned.  Were less than a day away, he said.  Youll be ready by then?  Greels finally pushed away from the screen.  Oh, absolutely, Captain.  Well be there.  Ready, I mean.  Lots of confidence.   Seal nodded.  Good.  Great.  So no problem with Singer?  Another wave.  No problem.  Whatever you want, boss.   The connection ended.  Seal shook his head.  Loaders          After a day spent checking over the horse mill, Jebediah returned home but found that Sarah was not in the house.  It took some searching before he saw through the windows that she was seated on the back porch.  She was in her favorite rocker, positioned in such a way that she could gaze over the fields at the setting sun.  She wore a soft blue dress with a matching kapp.  One arm was on an armrest, the other nestled firmly around her midsection.   Jebediah couldnt help but smile.  It was a beautiful moment.  He was almost afraid to disturb it.   Quietly he opened the back door and stepped out.  Sarah didnt look up initially, she just kept watching the sun, her back to him.  He stepped closer and gently touched her shoulders.  She smiled and reached back for his hand.  He began to massage.   That feels nice, she said.  Want to do my feet next?  Jeb smiled.  Do they hurt already? I thought that wouldnt be for months yet.   She frowned as Jebediah stooped beside her chair.  Months before I get large and awkward, yes, she said.  Months before I feel like someones sapping my energy, no.  She nodded at the distant circle of red.  I guess thats a common problem now, though, right? Loss of energy.   There was another rocker along the wall which he stepped back and collected, repositioning it so it was to Sarahs left.  Sat in it.  You know I dont know, he said.  It seems like it.  All I know is the sun is changing.   Sarah looked at him.  And you couldnt share that with me.  Any of it.   Jeb looked at his feet, still wearing his work boots.  It was my burden.  Why would I share that?  Why would you share it? Fire glinted in her eyes.  Because Im your wife, Jebediah.  Because Ill be the mother of your child.   Jeb sighed.  I went over this with the men  Were married, Herr Miller.  There should be no secrets.  Nothing between us.  She shook her head.  A hidden machine.  One youve known about your whole life? She looked away from him, toward the sun.  So what happens next?  Jeb began to rock.  Maybe nothing.  I dont know.   But something has to be done.  Ezekiel told Miriam about the crops.  About what the sun is doing to them.   Jeb frowned.  So everyone is talking now?  Everyone is concerned, and they should be.  Is this the Lords testing? Is it only a season?  Jeb sighed.  I dont think so  So if your machine doesnt work, what then? She looked at him.  Would you know if it did anything to the sun? If it fixed it?  Jeb nodded.  I did the same tests this morning.  So far, no change.   And if nothing changes?  Jeb shook his head.  Then that would beironic.   Jeb?  I mean, our entire way of life is based on resisting change.  About guarding against it.  Everything weighed by how it furthers unity.  Yet here we are waiting, praying, for a dramatic change to occur.  A miraculous change.   Sarah shook her head.  No, were praying for things to go back the way they were.  Thats not praying for change.  It is praying for normalcy.   Jeb slowed his rocking.  Brought his hands together.  But something always changes, he said.  Thats really what is normal.   Sarah shot him a look.  Jebediah.  Not here.  Alabaster doesnt change.  She pointed to him and to herself.  We dont change, right? Not ever.   But we are changing, Sarah.  Youre pregnant.  Going to be a mother.  Im going to be a father.  Thats a big, big change.   And thats why I dont want all this.  This uncertainty.  This unknown.  This danger.   Jeb leaned forward in his chair.  Watched the sun.  And thats why I did what I did, he said.  But I still dont know.  I have questions.   They lapsed into silence for some time, both of them watching the horizon.  The heads of grain blowing gently.  A handful of birds flapping and glidingcollecting the days final meal.  You dont think this is the end, do you? Sarah said.  Just now.  After all our waiting.  To lose the settlement.  The planet.   Jebediah remained silent, following the birds as they continued to swoop.   Jeb?  He frowned, straightened in his chair.  You know I dont know that.   But what do you think?  I thinkI think for certain well lose one or the other.  And my hope  Ya?  My hope is we dont lose both.   Abruptly, the birds stopped their hunt and darted out of sight.   Then the carriages began to fall from the sky.           The shuttle was fairly large, Singer thought.  It had a cramped pilots area in front, but the loading areathe place where she now satwas big enough to hold nearly thirty people.  Twice that, if they were standing.  They couldnt all be secured to a side wall like she was, of course, but the descent had been remarkably smooth.  They wouldnt need to be secured.   Still might want to have them sitting, though.   The difficulty would be the livestock.  She had done research on non-altered cattle and horses.  They were large and bony creatures.  Sometimes cantankerous.  Often smelly.  The domesticated versions were used to wearing straps and tiesthings to secure them with.   She searched the shuttles ceiling.  It was completely solid and painted light blue.  Nothing to secure with there.  The floor was similar to a bays floor, composed of a non-slide material that could, at the touch of a button, become frictionless.  No real places to tie on there either.  The gravity could be adjusted, but that hardly seemed wise.  Over-graving a shipload of methane producers? Recipe for asphyxiation.   She clearly needed more information from the owners.  She didnt want to think about it now.  Too many variables.  The priority was the Amish themselves.  They were the customers.  Their ancestors had paid the freight.   Singer looked across to the opposite side of the shuttle.  Seated in a similar drop seat was the medical officer Darly.  Like Singer, she was dressed in standard Guild bluesblue slacks and blue shirt/vest combo.  They both had Guild caps on.  The full uniform.   Darly noticed Singer looking, and she flashed her a quick-but-nervous smile.  She then looked at the floor.  Darly had been introspective throughout the entire operation.  Doubtless immersed in the task as much as Singer was.   Singer still couldnt believe she was in charge.  Seal was a generous man.  And despite her attempt to keep things categorized in her mind, to keep everything at a business level, she thought he had a bit of a shine for her.  Was he a romantic too? And on her ship? In all the galaxy, someone who could see beyond the societal norm? Someone who recognized the benefit of long-term companionship?  Singer shook her head.  Impossible.  Relationships were short and regulated affairs now.  Barely used even for family creation.  And her views, on nearly everything, were considered archaic.   She glanced to her right, where one of the ships security officers was strapped in.  He had a rigid jawline and a uniform similar to her own, except his had a few more labels and patches.  The largest one reading Security, of course.  He also wore a blue helmet instead of a hat.  He had barely said a word the entire trip.  Just stared forward, nearly at attention.   Across from him was the only other ship representativean intern from loading whom Greels had assigned.  He was a young man, with wide eyes and a high forehead.  He hadnt stopped fidgeting the whole time theyd been in flight.  Singer guessed Greels had sent him along as punishment for some perceived slight.  Greels was like that.  Foley was the interns name.   Ten minutes to landing, the intercom chirped.  Egan from the Ravens flight bubble was their pilot.  He had jumped at the chance to see something else besides grey, and Seal had okayed it.  Thankfully.  Otherwise, the ship wouldve been driven by one of the loader pilots.  She had little respect for loader pilots.  Singer, can you come up here? Egan asked.   Singer disconnected the belts that held her and stepped to the front of the bay, to the solid metal door there.  She gave it a couple taps, and it quickly slid open.  The cockpit was a small semi-circle with Egan in the exact center.  His control deck was essentially in his lap.  There was a wide band of windows in front of him.  Through it, she could see a vista of square fields on the planets surface.  A scattering of houses.   So there they are, she said, leaning forward.   Egan raised a finger.  Well, they are there, and there, and there, and there.  He smiled.  A pretty diverse grouping of people.  Hard to tell who might have called us.   Yes, well, they are farmers and tradesmen.  They would need lots of land between them.   Egan glanced at her.  For the crops.  Right.  But where do we set down? The other ships are asking.   There was a river that stretched from northwest to southeast.  There were meandering linesdirt trailsthat intersected that river and outlined many of the fields.  On a few she could see black animal-drawn carts.  Buggies, she thought they were called.  They were traveling in various directions.  Even now, there appeared to be some construction projects underway.  Barns and houses.   Singers eyes followed the trails.  There ought to be a city center of some sort.  A trading center.  A larger grouping of buildings.  Something.   Theyre religious, right? Egan said.  Shouldnt there at least be a church building somewhere?  She shook her head.  They dont build churches.  They meet in homes.   Huh.  Tragic.  He shrugged.  Ive never seen a church.  But from vids, you know, I expected one.   This isnt a Western, Egan.   Well, almost.   She rolled her eyes.  No.  There might be a school building, though.   So we can land there?  She shook her head.  Itll be small.  One room.  And I dont want to scare the kids.   As they dropped nearer, it was obvious theyd been seen.  Men in the fields stopped and raised hands to shield their eyes.  Children ran out of houses.  Buggies paused, and passengers exited to look up.   Weve made a scene, Egan said, chuckling.  This is wild.   Finally she saw it.  A larger building with a long, covered shelter beside it.  A garage for the buggies, she guessed.  A lot of buggies.  Must be a store of some sort.  In addition, there was a wide open area in front of it.  A place where they could land without crushing someones field or even blowing their clothes off the line.  There, she said, pointing.  Lets go there.   Egan nodded and began manipulating controls.  Ill let you know when were stopped.   Singer quietly made her way back to her seat.  Flashed a hopeful look at the other passengers.  Strapped herself in.  Here we go.       8    They were like a swarm of locusts as they descended.  A small cloud of blue and black objects falling from the sky.  At least a dozen of them.  Invaders.  Englishers, no doubt.   The most frightening scene Bishop Samuel had ever witnessed.   They were space carriages, doubtless similar to those that had brought their ancestors to Alabaster.  Each was slightly curved and transparent in the front, but otherwise rectangular.  They had three legs.  One large one in the front and two smaller, parallel ones in the back.  Each leg seemed to hang like a birds.  There were clearly talons on the ends.  Hands that could grasp and manipulate, yet flatten out to land.   Now standing on the steps of the trading post, Samuel clutched his Bible.  He brought it firmly to his chest.  Protecting his heart.   Surely this was what it was to see demons.   The carriages made little sound, yet each one plied the sky like a June swallow.  As they drew nearer it became apparent how awfully large they were.  As big as a house.  Solid.  Formidable.  Dangerous.  The stories from Amisher history didnt do them justice.   His mouth drifted open.  He lifted his free hand to cover it.  How could something so large stay in the air, aside from impurity? How could it fly? It had to use magic, didnt it?  Deacon Mark coughed from behind him.  Samuel turned to see the younger man at the top of the stairs, foot frozen in space as if hed been about to step down before chancing to look up.  His eyes were wide, staring.  Wavering, no doubt, between belief and apostasy.  Are those?  Craft, Samuel spat.  The work of the devil.   The lead carriage slowed and halted above them, maybe forty feet from the front of the Trading Post.   Samuel had come only for joint liniment, which he now carried in his pocket.  His knees pained him something awful.  Made helping his sons with chores next to impossible.  All the ache now, though, was in his gut.  Look what was happening! And there was nothing he could do to stop it.  This is Jebediahs doing, he said aloud.  The work of his forbidden machine.   Mark just nodded and continued to watch the flying carriages.  The nearest one had begun a final descent.  It was eerily quiet and smooth.  There wasnt even any air being displaced around it, like when a bird flapped its wings.  Only a slow drift to the ground.  Like a falling leaf.   Samuel wanted to run out and stand beneath it.  To wave his hands until it went away.  He knew that was no use, though.  The carriages would simply land somewhere else.  In a moment our way of life is shattered.   Mark closed up behind him.  Laid a steadying hand on his shoulder.  Strength, teacher.  We need your strength.   Samuel looked at the ground, feeling tears begin to well up.  But with a quick shake of his head and a wipe of his handkerchief, he was able to pull himself together.  He nodded once firmly.  The carriage was down now.  Resting on solid ground.  Derr Herrs ground.  Yes.  We knew we werent alone, he said.  That one day this could happen.  Another nod.  Lets see what they want.   To their left was a grove of large shade trees.  Small groups of mostly men had been eating their lunch there.  Now they were getting to their feet, dusting their hands, and looking to Samuel and Mark for direction.  Men and women alike were exiting the front of the buggy house to Samuels right.  They looked at the sky, at the vehicle resting on the ground, and then back at him.  Faces knitted with concern.   Leadership was needed.  Wisdom, strength, and leadership.   Samuel approached the space carriage, and the others fell in behind him.  When he was about halfway there, he noticed an unusual scent.  It wasnt sulfur and brimstone, exactly, but it wasnt far off either.  A jarring smell.  He scowled and made a quick wipe of his nose.  The scent didnt go away.   He continued on.  The carriage seemed a bit less boxy as he drew closer, but it maintained a utilitarian shape.  The legs were still the most disconcerting.  They hardly seemed large enough to support the crafts weight.  The ship had minimal ornamentation, a good thing, but the colorthese varying shades of bluewere extravagant.  Far beyond what the Ordnung allowed for moving vehicles.  Shipping Guild was written in bright yellow letters near the transparent section.  All made to get attention, made to say Here we are! See us!  Samuel noticed a man sitting in the transparent section.  No hat, no covering whatsoever over his uncontrolled brown hair.  No beard.  When the man noticed Samuel, he smiled and waved senselessly, like a child.   Is it a ship of the insane? Of narrisch men? Samuel muttered.  He took a position about ten feet from the side of the craft and planted his feet.  He crossed his hands in front of him, still clutching the Bible.  Men came up behind him on either side.   After a few seconds, he heard voices from the back of the craft.  He frowned and stepped that direction, being mindful to stay clear of the carriages legs.  As he reached the back he saw that a large door had opened and a ramp was being extended.  A young woman, wearing a blue hat and solid blue clothingmans clothingpeered out at him through the door opening.   Oh, hello, she said, smiling.  How are you?  Samuel nodded.  I am Bishop Samuel.  He introduced Mark, as well.   The woman smiled brighter, held her hands out.  Sorry, youll She pointed to her left ear.  Youll have to speak slowly.  Your dialect, your accent, is difficult for me.   Another woman joined the first.  This one was shorter, dressed similarly.  She looked as frightened as a mouse.  She still managed to smile, though.  She watched for him to return the gesture and appeared to be staring at his mouth.  She then checked the faces and mouths of the others around him.   Very odd.  What is she looking at? he asked, finally.   The first woman looked at her companion, and then waved dismissively.  Shes a doctor.  Shes used to staring at people.  SorryI think shes worried about your teeth.   Our teeth?  The shorter women shrugged and took a couple of paces back.  Not as bad as Id feared, she said.   The first woman took a step down the ramp.  A large man appeared at the door then.  He had on a hat that looked heavy and hard.  He stood quite tall and had a black object that Samuel thought was a weapon.  The shape was different from those they used to hunt with, but the way it was heldlooked dangerous.  Next to him was another shorter man.  Another mouse.   Samuel straightened himself.  So, youve come to invade us? he said, nodding in the direction of the man with the weapon.   The lead female glanced back, looked irritated.  Put that away, she said.  Back in the ship.   Security rules, the man said.   Fine, then you stay in the ship.   Maam, I need to be with you.   She groaned.  Shook her head.  Then leave the tarc in the ship.  Their culture is pacifistic.   Maam?  She looked at Samuel.  You dont fight, right? Over anything.   Samuel clutched his Bible.  Nodded stiffly.  We are dissidents, true.  But to yield often requires greater strength than merely to discharge a weapon.   Mark was on his left.  We follow the teaching of Christs Sermon on the Mount: But I say to you, do not resist an evil person; but whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also.   The young lady smiled.  Turned to the security officer.  See?  He only shifted his stance and searched the area beyond the crowd of people.  There might be animals here who dont share those feelings.   At that, Samuel smiled.  An honest answer.  He raised a hand.  Let him bring the rifle.  It wont bother us.   Are you sure? the young lady said.   She, at least, was respectful.  Samuel could give her credit for that.  She may be an instrument of the devil, but she was a polite instrument.  He nodded.   She waved the other people forward and walked to the end of the ramp.  My name is Singer, she said, smiling.  And weve come to rescue you.           Jebediah couldnt hide his surprise.  It was nothing like hed expected.  These incredible contrivances.  Hed heard stories as a child, but was it really possible? Could a man construct such a thing? He admired the work of woodworkers and blacksmiths, but these carriages  It would take dozens of skilled craftsman to build even one.  And even then, it would be infinitely heavy.  How would it fly?  Jeb got to his feet.  Walked to the end of the porch and stepped out into the grass.  He shielded his eyesmostly out of reflex, because the sky carriages didnt glow.  The sun did glint off of their blue surfaces somewhat.   Sarah joined him.  Is this what your machine brought? she asked, looking frightened.  Are they here to fix our sun?  His mouth was agape.  I dont know.  Could it be? he asked.  But they make my machine look insignificant.  He looked at her.  Can you believe it? They float.  The nearest carriage seemed to stop midair and slowly start to descend.  Hover like a moth.  Jeb strode past the end of the house and turned toward the barn.  He walked slowly, because he could barely keep his eyes from the craft.   What are you doing? Sarah asked.   He pointed forward.  Going to get a horse.  Going to see it.   And leave me? She swept a hand toward the sky.  With all this?  Jeb shook his head.  I dont think theyre dangerous.  He pointed east.  It looks like they are stopping near the store.  Thats where I want to go.  Where I should go, if Im responsible.   Sarahs hand was on her midsection again.  Im worried, she said.  Frightened.  I dont She looked at the ground.  Shook her head.  Go on.  Ill pray for you.  For all of us.   His eyes never left the sky.  Yagut.  I think that would be wise.           Jebediah arrived to find three of the flying carriages parked in a line leading away from the front of the store.  All had small groups of settlement onlookers around them, though everyone was keeping a safe distance.  The children were the hardest to contain, of course.  Mothers clutched young arms and shoulders, while admonishing to Be patient and Watch from here.  The men were generally sober, with brows furrowed or hands stroking their beards.   Jeb felt more like the children.   All three vehicles were open on the end, with ramps leading into what appeared to be a large, blue room.  At the end of that room was a door.  Doubtless an entrance to where the crafts controls were.  He wondered if the controls were buttons and lights like the object in his barn.  He guessed they were.  Power contained within a simple container.   Each carriage had a handful of Englishers near the entrance.  All were dressed in bluemodestly, he thought.  These strangers looked nervous too.  Lost.  Out of their element.   Jeb saw the local smith, Daniel, standing with a hand on his chin.  He was squinting hard at the nearest ship.  Jeb approached him and laid a hand on his shoulder.  What do you think, Daniel?  Daniel raised an eyebrow.  I dont know what to think.  Such large sheets of material.  No seams.  He shook his head.  It is a work of art, I tell you.  Stirs my stomach to look at it.   Jeb smiled.  But would you want to? he asked.  Up close?  Daniel snorted.  Id probably be shunned just for thinking about it.   Jeb laughed.  Nodded toward the Englishers.  Has anyone talked with them? Found out what they want?  Daniel indicated the sky carriage closest to the store.  I think the Bishop has.  I often hear Samuels raised voice.   Jebediah frowned.  Now my stomach is stirring He gave Daniel a closing nod and walked in the direction of the store.  Many of the onlookers turned to look at him as he passed.  A few acknowledged him with a nod, but most only watched.  Weighing him.  Everyone knew about his machine now.  That he had held a forbidden fruit to his lipsand brought this down upon them all.  Following his meeting with the pastors, all was to be forgiven.  But it didnt always go that way.   He reached the front vehicle.  Bishop Samuel and Deacon Mark were standing with four of the Englisherstwo men and two women.  Samuel looked stoic, mindful.  Not yelling now.  Not upset.  A good beginning.  Mark noticed Jebediahs approach but didnt say anything.  Didnt even nod.   This is the one who called you, Samuel said then.  Jebediah Miller.  He made a swatting motion at Jeb.  His hands went behind his back, holding his worn Bible.  Talk to him.  Perhaps hell understand you.  Im through.   The taller of the Englisher women turned Jebs way.  Her clothes were wrinkle-free, perhaps heavily starched.  Her hair was pulled back into a tail and covered by a hat.  Her hands were also behind her back.  She was accustomed to talking to men, he reasoned.  Not as a helpmeet but as an equal.   She smiled at him.  Hello, Im Crewmember Singer.  She introduced the others, making it clear she wasnt just an equal but that she was, in fact, in charge.  Jebediah noticed the larger mans rifle, and that the smaller womanwhose facial features and skin tone were unknown to himwas also staring at him.  Particularly at his mouth.  So you sent the signal? Singer asked.   He assumed she meant the machine, the way it lit up.  I guess I did, he said.  Though I didnt realize thats what the device did.  Was that what it was for? To call you? I didnt know.   Deacon Mark was watching him, looking thoughtful.  Weighing him.  Jeb recalled a Bible verse: Forgive them, they dont know what they do.  The Lords own admission that sometimes sin was unintentional.   But was still sin.   It was good that you did, Singer said.  Your sun is in an expansion stage.  Its hydrogen is becoming depleted.  It will soon become a red giant.   A red giant? You speak of fairy tales?  Singers smile returned.  No, I mean your star.  Your sun.  It will continue to expand, becoming quite large.  And dangerous.   He looked in the direction of the sun, now low in the sky.  A chill was already entering the air.  Night was coming.  And then morning.  This was the cycle they were used to.  The slow movement of the sun.  Hed never imagined it could do anything else.  It was unsettling.  How large, this giant? he asked.   Large enough to consume your entire world.  She brought her fingertips together.  To swallow it.   Deacon Mark frowned.  As Jonah was consumed by the great fish, he said, when he ran from God.   Singer smiled, turned to her colleagues.  Thats a story from the Bible, she said.  A man swallowed by a whale.   It is more than a story, Mark said.  It is a truth from our past.  A revelation of Gods truth.  Of His will, and the purpose of we as Christ-followers.   Singer frowned.  Yeswell, the world wont be spit out, in this case.  It wont be freed.  It will be vaporized.   The short man leaned forward.  More like hell, metaphorically-speaking.   Thanks, Foley, Singer said, a bit of ice in her tone.   Hell, Mark repeated.  It is what all men deserve.   Yes, Jeb said.  But Gods grace prevents.   Mark bowed his head.  Amen to that.  So it is.   Singer looked between the two of them.  Now that we have that out of the way Ive been trying to explain to the others that weve come to remove your people from this planet.   Jeb scanned the flying carriages.  They were large, would doubtless hold many people.  But their community was large, and there were other, smaller communities spread out across Alabaster.  And they certainly wouldnt all fit.  In only those carriages? he said.   Singer smiled.  Our shuttles? Yes.  Those will take you from the planet, but we have a larger carriagea larger shipoverhead.  A much larger craft.  And we have time for multiple trips.   A larger ship? Jeb said.  How much larger?  Thousands of times larger, Foley said.  Large enough to hold hundreds of your communities.  And your livestock.   Yes, Singer said.  But well need to limit the livestock.  Just enough to begin again when we get you to your new environment.  She smiled brightly.  Youll be pleased to know that another planet has already been allocated for you.   She said it like a world was something one might trade for at the store.  Something you could put in your pocket.  Incredible, he said.  And you want to take us there? Across the heavens?  She tipped her head.  Thats what we do, Jebediah.  Do what you dowell move you.   Samuel doesnt approve, Mark said, sighing.  This will have to be prayerfully discussed.   Singer looked at Mark.  There will be no cost to you, of course.  That has already been paid.   Samuel drifted back toward them again.  His lips still moved as if in prayer, though.  Eyes partially closed.   Already paid? Mark said.  How is that possible?  An insurance policy, Singer said.  From decades ago.   A covenant with Englishers.  Samuel frowned.  A lack of faith.   Singer shook her head.  We have no record of that.  Simply that the policy was paid.   A seed of promise planted long ago James murmured.   We have community funds to cover needs that arise, Mark said.   Can we cover the sun? Jeb asked mildly.   Samuel glared.  Nee, we cannot cover the sun, he said.  No more than we can cover past sins.   They say the star is failing, Jeb said.  That we need to leave.   It will have to be discussed, Samuel said.  This poses great danger to our fellowship.   Jeb looked at Singer.  But well be together, right? Well move as a group.   She nodded.  Absolutely.  We have space on the ship already allocated.  Time in the schedule.   The Lords schedule is His own, Samuel said.   Singer glanced at her colleagues.  Frowned.  We are ready whenever you are, of course.  But our ship has other obligations.  A schedule of its own to keep.  She nodded toward the heavens.  Plus, the star keeps its own schedule, as well.  We arent precisely sure  Samuel nodded his head slowly.  It will be discussed.   Our community depends on this, Samuel, Jeb said.  We need to leave or there will be no community.  I know this in my heart.   Samuel fixed him with a frown.  It will be discussed.           It took Congi a moment to remember where he was.  It was dark, cramped, confusing.  When he tried to sit up, he hit his head, blindingly, on something above him.  There was pressure against his back, against his hips.  There was a glow somewhere to his right.  A dim light.  He turned his head, squinted, and finally located the source of the light.  Stretching his hand toward it, he felt something smooth, something small.  Then he recognized the shape.  His handlight.  He brought it up.  Flashed it all around.  Grimaced.   He was still inside the package! He was still nestled in the small makeshift passage that led from one portion of the package to the other.  Ahead of him he thought he could see the abscess he had entered through.   Wheres my bag? He felt around until he found the bags smooth material an arms length in front of him.   He felt a little achy.  A little foggy.  But otherwise he felt good.  Strong.  He found a place where he could grip ahead, and he pulled hard.  Objects gave way around him.  Some of the pressure eased.  He grunted, pushed with his toes a little, and pulled forward again.  He slid cleanly ahead.   A touch of relief.  He crawled until he was able to fully crouch within the entry abscess.  He shook his head.  Pulled the bag close.  Gave it a shake to make sure things were still inside.   He wondered about the time.  He found his com device.  It was no longer signaling.  No longer alerting him to Greelss imminent arrival.   He checked the built-in clock.  That cant be right.  He brought the device close and then drew it farther away.  Tapped it.  Shook his head.   It said that over a day had passed.   Cant be right.  Greels had been on his way.  If hed found the open package, Congis things, he wouldve pitched a fit.  Written him up on the spot.   Maybe the date had been set wrong before hed passed out.  He thought the date was constantly synced with ships time.  But he could be wrong.  Tech had never been his thing.   Regardless, he needed to hurry.  He made a last check of the interior, climbed out through the opening, and stepped into the bay.  It felt good to stand upright.  To stretch his legs.  He scanned the bay around him.  The lights seemed dimmer but otherwise everything was the same.  His push cart was just where hed left it.   He remembered pain  He checked his hand again.  Saw the mix of green, red, and black on his glove.  He scowled, removed both gloves, and tossed them in the carts incinerator.   He felt along his neck and shoulders.  Then down his sides and lower back.  There was a little stiffness from having slept in such cramped quarters, but otherwise nothing.  Strange.  What had happened? He shook his head again.  He didnt have time to think about it.  He had his sack of stuff and he needed to go.  He examined the hole he had cut.  Still looked fairly clean, even after climbing in and out through it.   He retrieved the molecutter from the rack, squatted, and after smoothing the cut portion of the seal with his hand, pressed the molecutter to it.  A quick switch put it in repair mode.  A green light signaled the change.  He put it to the surface and slowly followed the cut.  In less than a minute, the cut was repaired.  The sealing material looked completely smooth and tear-free.   Congi spent a long minute examining his work, just to be sure.  He then shoved the cutter and his bag of found goods into the rack, making sure they were back far enough that they werent obvious.  He placed a few other tools over them to help conceal them.  Satisfied, he nodded, and hurried to the door.   All in all, it had been a pretty good day.       9    They met at Bishop Samuels house again.  None of the Englishers were invited.  It was the same group that had met with Jebediah before, minus his friend Ezekiel.  Jeb sat at one end of the long table, but no one sat at the other.  To his left were Samuel and Mark.  To his right, James and Abraham.  This configuration, Samuel felt, would be more equitable.  Jeb couldnt see how.  He was still at the foot of the table.  And the center of attention.   The discussion had gone on before hed arrived, though.  For hours.  He didnt understand how it could take that long.  Their sun was dyingwhat choice did they have?  The meeting started with prayer, and after the heads were no longer bowed, Mark looked Jebs direction.  Wed like to get your thoughts on what has happened.   I think we need to get our people together and leave.   Deacon James sat slumped in his chair, his stomach pressing into the tables side.  And the harvest? he asked.  The livestock?  Jebediah shrugged.  The harvest, what portion of it isnt blighted, will have to stay where it is.  Even if the Englishers have room for it, we dont have time to gather it.  We have weeks of work left, but they want to leave as soon as possible.   So our work is for naught, Abraham said.  The planting, the hoeing, the fertilizing  Scripture teaches that we are to have few ties to the world, Jeb said.  To be in it, but not of it.   James bowed his head thoughtfully.  Nodded once.   Mark laid a hand on the table.  Amen.  Is life not more important than food, the body more important than clothing?  Jeb nodded.  As for our livestock, the Englishers have agreed to take some.  So we should be busy making choices.  Separating those to be taken.   There would be some pain in that for the children, Abe said.  Animals that feel like family, left behind.   A sad choice, but necessary, Mark said, frowning.  Animals are tools for living.   Samuel had been quiet the whole time.  Even now, he stared at his folded hands.  Reflective.  How do we know? he said.  How do we know that what these Englishers offer will be a better life? Do we dare trust them? This new planet theyve found us, what do we know of it? What do we know of any of it?  It would be a faith walk, Mark said.  That may be beneficial.   Faith is always beneficial, Samuel said.  But we can practice faith by staying, as well.   We cant, Jeb said.  We shouldnt.   Shouldnt, Samuel repeated.  Please dont speak to us about shouldnt.  It is your shouldnt that brought us here.   A sin that has been forgiven, Mark said.   Samuel nodded.  Ya, I am aware.  But it has brought us a string of threats to righteousness.  Even now, children play alongside foreign space carriages.  Having their minds filled with strange ideas.  How will it be if we are inside those carriages? For weeks and weeks?  The Ordnung doesnt forbid it, Mark said.   Samuel sniffed.  We mustnt use an absence of specifics as license.   Even at forty, Abraham had a pronounced stripe of grey in his beard.  What do they intend to do with us? he asked.  In the ship?  Jebediah looked at the table, tried to find the knot hed traced during the prior meeting.  Strangely, he couldnt.  Had they turned the table? Well be together, he said, frowning.  Theyll have us in a large chamber together.   Yet surrounded by the trappings of their world.  Their influence.  Under their control.  Samuel looked at the rest of them.  I say that not for myself but for the settlement as a whole.  We would be at their mercy.  We have kinner to think of.   Ya, thats what Im thinking of too, Jeb said.  Our children.  His eyes swept the group.  We need to go.  You elders need to lead.  Ill help with organizing.  Everyone will help.  But like Moses and the Israelites, it is time to go.   James sighed.  But we arent fleeing slavery, Jebediah, he said.  God hasnt put a pillar of fire in front of us.   Jeb searched for the knot again.  I think He has.  Our sun is the pillar, and it will soon light the entire sky.  Or perhaps it is like the Angel of Death, soon to pass over all of Alabaster.  We have a promised land to go to, already chosen for us.  Even our travel has been paid for already.  What better symbol of Christs mercy is there than that? Our penalty is already paid.   Samuel smiled, snorted a laugh.  A convenient metaphor.  But what do we know of the person who did the paying? Their motives.  Do we now owe them?  Jeb sighed.  It was doubtless one of our forefathers.  Someone preparing for the worst.   Samuel scowled.  Like your great-grandfather? Or whoever left that infernal machine for you to mind?  Possibly.  My father never said, but possibly.   Well, I dont like it.  It is just more secrets.  More change.   Jeb shook his head.  We have to be reasonable.  The Englishers are here to help us.  They could be acting as Gods unknowing servants.  The answer to our prayers.   Deacon Mark nodded.  A good observation, Jebediah.  It will be taken into consideration.   So you havent made up your mind?  Nee, Mark said.  And in fact, the current crisis isnt the reason we invited you here.   Jeb straightened in his chair.  You asked for my opinion.   And we now have it, Samuel said.  But we brought you here to answer a question.   Jeb found another knot in the table.  Focused on it.  Traced the grain lines around it.  Realized how much the grains together looked like a misshapen human face.  One with very large teeth.  And what question is that?  Samuels eyes narrowed.  Will you be able to abide by the decision we reach? he asked.  Whatever that is?  Mark nodded.  We are concerned for you, Jeb.  Whether the machine, and now the Englishers, has affected you.  Changed your commitment.   Jebs heart fluttered.  What were they suggesting? Questioning his commitment? Such words were normally reserved for those caught in repeated sin.  Those in danger of being shunned.  No one is more committed to this community than Sarah and I.  Weve shown it countless times.   Yet you have a willful streak, Samuel said, frowning.  A tendency to do what you think is right, despite how it might affect others.   Jeb couldnt believe what he was hearing.  How could they be so blind as to think there was another path to follow? His tests showed their sun was in trouble, and the Englishers had confirmed it.  So you are contemplating staying? he asked.  Despite the danger? Despite our way of escape?  We havent decided, Mark said.  But we need to know that you will support whatever decision we reach.  That you will not interfere.   Jeb looked at the table again.  If he set aside his thoughts on the crisis, he could see that their concern for him wasnt unusual or out of line.  It was the responsibility of the bishop and deacons, all of them elected by lotby Gods choiceto look out for his soul.  To seek his greater good.  And good had always come from tradition, from adherence to the law.   So where did faith in that tradition stop? Was there a faith in God that superseded faith in their revered ways? How might he unhitch the two? Should he?  His physical mind, his conscience, told him that the destiny of their world was already decided.  That it, barring a miracle, would endwhether they were present or not.   Alabaster is not our home, he said.  We need to remember that.  Our home is with Gott.  And while we live, it is in His universe, wherever we make it.  Wherever Gott leads.   Deacon James slid back from the table some.  Grunted.  Turned more Jebs direction.  Then, since all eyes were already on him, he spoke.  You are determined to leave then, no matter what we decide.  Does Sarah agree?  Sarah? We havent discussed Im sure she will do whatever the community decides.   James smiled.  As long as that is to leave, correct? Just like you.   Anger gripped him.  He pushed his seat back.  Stood.  I think we have to go.   Samuel shook his head.  It is as I feared: willfulness echoing sinfulness.   So you will go, Abraham said.  Regardless of what others think?  Jeb bowed his head.  I think I have to.   Samuels face looked hollow, as did Marks.  Then we must admonish you against this path.  Your intent is outside the Lords will.  To quote Genesis, Sin is crouching at your door.   My intent is only to save the people I love.   As is ours, Samuel said.   Mark looked at Samuel.  We should meet on this again.   You must know that I have to follow my conscience, Jeb said.  Regardless.   And so will we, Samuel said.  Regardless.           Seal had barely stepped out of the steamer when his com device chirped.  He huffed, toweled off, and quickly searched for a robe to wear.   The first he found was a blue prestige-format robe from the company line.  The material came from a genetically-enhanced silkworm.  It appeared smooth and shiny on the outside but on the inside had the consistency of brushed cotton.  Warm, comfortable, yet sophisticated.   Now covered, Seal looked for his com unit.  The captains quarters were larger than most.  He had a queen-sized bed, a small circular table and chairs, an attached and private excretoriumwhat used to be called a bathroom.  He also had a small kitchenette, complete with a sink and a floor-standing temperature manipulator.  The latter device had been designed with a bit of a retro feel.  Instead of the typical rectangle atop rectangle, it was circle over circle.  The bottom cylinder was navy blue, the top, shimmering silver.   Regardless, the com unit wasnt on the kitchen counter where he usually left it.  Nor was it on the table or the chairs.  He had to wait for a second chirp before he realized the sound was muffled and in the direction of the temp-mani.  Frowning, he walked to it and opened the lower chamber.  The com was there next to the orangrape drink hed just taken out.   He shook his head, retrieved the com, walked to the table and sat down.  The tables surface lit up as soon as he placed the com atop it.  While he waited for the image of the caller to appear, he brought up the Ravens flight schedule.  It included the pilots scheduling estimates factoring planetary load time.  There was some wiggle room, but they would be close.   Seal was surprised when Singers face appeared.  He smiled, pulled a hand through his still-damp hair, and tried to look as official as he possibly could in a robe.  It was her first time in his room, in a manner of speaking, and he couldnt help but feel a little self-conscious.  He hoped his few grey chest hairs werent showing, but he fought to keep from looking.  Being self-conscious was permissible, but appearing self-conscious was not.   Thankfully, Singer smiled as soon as her image became active.  Seal She paused, clearly studying his background.  Youre in your quarters, arent you?  Yes.  He sat up straight to keep the robe together.   She frowned.  Sorry to catch you at a bad time.   He shook his head.  There is no bad time for a Captain.  Smiled.  Im sure it is important.   Yes, she said, frowning deeper.  Seal, I dont think theyre coming.   He drew his head back.  Not coming? Do they not have enough time?  Singer was standing outside somewhere.  Behind her was a wooden structure and a large animal tied to a pole.  It almost reminded him of the sort of on-the-scene reporting that news flix services did.  They would have enough time, she said.  Plenty of time, if we could just get them moving.   Seal had little patience for slacking.  Do they not understand the danger? he said.  I read the report you distributed about their culture.  I assume they have no astronomical instruments of their own.  No experience with this sort of phenomena.   Singer nodded.  Thats right.  Thats part of the problem.  Behind her, the animal flicked its tail and brought its long head up to look Singers direction.  Dropped its head again.  But I assumed our arrival would be evidence enough.  Would stir them to action.   He was surprised, frankly, that they hadnt scurried like ants.  So what are they doing exactly?  She frowned, looked to her right.  The leaders are discussing.  Lots of discussing.  She looked forward again.  Most just go on with their work.  Say theyre praying about it.   Praying? Seal looked at his hands, thought over all hed read.  Snapped his fingers.  Ah, yes, talking with this Lord of theirs.  Conversing with the divine.   Seal grinned.  Thats correct.  You really did read my report.   Of course.  A well-written missive.  Very informative.  He slowly brought a hand up and rested his head against it.  So what do we do? We have a schedule to keep.   Im aware, Seal.  But I dont want to push.  Or intimidate.  The animal flicked its tail.  Looked again.  Im not sure we could intimidate them anyway.  They are unusually calm.  Deliberate.   I have no problem with deliberation.  But were talking about a sun here.  A product of nature over which we have no control.  They need to know that.   And I think they do.  They just arent in any hurry.  Singer looked to her left again, giving Seal a chance to admire her profile.  Professional.  Dedicated.  Pretty.  We seem to have arrived during their harvest season.  Lots of work to do, though I understand the crops are poor this year.  With good reason.   Seal felt a breeze on his chest and sat up again.  What about the person who called us? Have you met him? Can he help?  Singers face brightened.  Actually, yes, I did meet him.  Seems reasonable.  Still dont know how he knew to call, or even what he used, but maybe he could help.  She looked both directions, and Seal noticed a breeze playing with the end of her ponytail.  Thats a good idea, Seal.  Finding him will give us something to do.   Very good.  Seal remembered the drink in the temp-mani.  Remembered how thirsty he was.  In the meantime, Ill make sure were ready here.  Greels has been hard to reach lately.  Hopefully that means hes busy.  A frown.  He needs to be busy.   Singer nodded.  Thanks again.  A smile.  For the opportunity.   I knew you could handle it.   They said their goodbyes and the link closed.  Seal stood and retrieved his drink.  He then returned to the table and with a sweep of his finger brought up the directory listing for Greels.  Queried him.  A blue ring formed on the tables surface.  Started to pulse.  Five minutes went by.   No response.           Greels was jittery, on edge.  Nearly jumping at shadows.   It was the sleep, he knew.  Or rather, the lack of it.  Every night he was restless.  Distracted.  An ache in his gut.  A desire.  Hed been alone a long time now.   But that was before hed seen her face.  Such a beautiful face.  A trapped bird.  He couldnt help but think of her that way.  An obsession, yes.  But a pure one.  A good one.  Just her face.   Hed been denied her presence for too long now.   Greels was on the slideway again.  Headed toward Bay 16 from his quarters.  It was break time.  His time.  There was no way he would be disturbed.   For nearly a day and a half hed been without her.  He didnt like that.  Too many distractions.  Loaders calling.  Didnt like it.  Needed to see her.  Felt it strongly.  In his gut.   Where a man should feel things.  Deep inside.  Where he should get his drive.   Only a day before hed been on his way to see her, but security had contacted him.  Diverted him.  Then it had been a report from the ground crew.  Every single person from loading who was down on the planet had felt the need to report.  Every little detail.  Who cared?  The people of the planet were weird.  And a little backwards.  A lot backwards.  And galactic freeloaders.  Wanting others to do the work for them.  To pick them up and move them.  Didnt have their own transportation.  Didnt want it.  Didnt believe in it, but didnt mind getting others to do it for them.  Freeloaders.   He shook his head.  So what? Just do the job.  Make it happen.   Greels reached the door for Bay 16.  He was nervous.  Excited.  He used his passkey.  Almost jumped when the door began to rise.  Felt a surge of warmth.  A whole-body tickle.   He entered the bay and turned the lights up full.  Looked around.  Smiled.  He bounced on his feet.  Clenched both hands.  Took a buoyant step toward the nearest row of packages, then the next.  He wasnt tired anymore.  He was exuberant.  Energized.  Her package was in sight.  He purposely slowed his stride.  Purposely acted in a more respectful manner.  As if he was approaching royalty.  A queen.   She was a queen.  His ice princess.   He went to the far side of her package and unsealed the viewing flap.  If he peeked, he knew he could see the side of her face, her profile.  But he didnt want to do that.  Didnt want to rush.  Slow and steady.  He was the master of control.   He moved slowly past the front of the package, the concealed cryomatrix, and around to the right side.  He reached up to unseal the flap there, and paused.  Dropping his hands, he squinted at the floor past her package.   Something looked wrong.   Hed made this journey dozens of times now.  He knew how everything was supposed to look.  But for some reason, the floor near the package beyondthe one containing the remains of the science outpostseemed disturbed.  He took a step that direction, stooped down.   Yes, there was a scuff mark on the floor.  A slight lightening of the floors otherwise dark material.   Greels clenched his fists.  Someone had been in the bay.  Despite his having locked it down.  Despite his warnings.   He felt panic.  It was a desecration! Who would do such a thing? Who had the nerve?  He got down on all fours.  Crawled closer to the scuff mark.  He ran his fingers across it as if he could get a sense for the shoes that had created it.  The person who had left it.   That person should pay.   He shook his head.  There wasnt anything about the scuff that would help.  Someone had been here, though.   Greelss com unit chirped.  He scowled.  It chirped a lot.  He ignored it.  A lot.   He glanced at the package near the scuff.  Saw nothing but a pristine white wrapping.  No breaks, no tears.  Thankfully, it hadnt been tampered with.  That ruled out one contender.   He sighed and was about to return to his feet when he noticed something about the exterior wrapping.  It wasnt a tear, nobut something else.  He frowned, moved his head so he could see the side reflecting the light.  Then shifted his head back again.   There was a slight dip in the wrapping.  Greels put his finger on it and made sure it wasnt a mirage.  He attempted to trace the dip.  Working slowly, he was able to make a complete circle.  The circle was at least a meter wide.   He grimaced.  Someone had cut the wrapping and repaired it.  The repair was perfect, nearly invisible and seamless.  But there was still evidence.  Still a trace.  He felt anger.  Shock.  Anger again.   Congi.  It had to be.   That little thief had snuck in andwho knew what? Broken into the package, for certain.  Stolen something? Probably.  Lots of things.  Valuable things.   Greelss heart began to race.  What if Congi had opened her package?  He darted to the cryomatrix package and leaned in really close.  He searched it slowly, first the sides, and then the front.  Many minutes passed.  The whole time, he was afraid.  Nervous he would find something to indicate that Congi had put his filthy hands on it.  Greels wouldnt share her.  Not with anyone.  Especially not finder scum like Congi.   Finally Greels stepped away from the matrix and checked the surface in the light.  He checked the viewing flaps too.  It was impossible to know for sure, of course.  The flaps had been dislodged often.  But in general the package looked good.  No surface anomalies.  No scuffing.   He was still angry.  Congi shouldnt even have been close.  Shouldnt have been in the room.  And to be messing with the princesss articles? That was an affront too large to ignore.  He looked at her package again.  Frowned.  He wanted to stay.  Wanted to spend time with her.  But he couldnt.  Congi had disobeyed, had been with her.   He would pay.       10    Jeb was surprised when he got home.  There was a buggy parked outside.  Ezekiels buggy.   Jeb wasnt unhappy.  He wanted to see Ezekiel.  They had things to discuss.  It was unusual to see him in the middle of the day, though.  In the middle of harvest.   This was no ordinary harvest, of course.   The second surprise came when he opened the front door.  Sitting in the living room with Sarah was Ezekiel and the Englisher woman, Singer.  She smiled when she saw him.  All four chairs had been removed from the wall hooks and placed on the floor.  Three were occupied.  The other empty.  Presumably for him.   Farthest from the door was Ezekiel.  His black coat was on the floor next to his chair.  He had elbows on his knees and hands together.  He gave Jeb a sheepish smile.   Mr.  Miller, Singer said.  How nice to see you again.   Jeb squinted, stooped to pull his shoes off and set them to one side of the circular door mat.  Frowned.  Ya.  Gut to see you too.   Singer glanced at the other two.  Sarah rocked in her chair.  Arms over her stomach.  A concerned look on her face.  Ezekiel seemed nervous.   What is this about? Jeb asked.  I feel Ive walked into a church service late.   Singers eyebrows rose.  She looked at the others again.  Have I overstepped something? Im sorry, your culture is still foreign to me.  You can only read so much.   That depends, he said.  What were you intending to do?  She got to her feet.  To see you again, of course.  I wanted to speak with you.   Jeb motioned for her to sit.  Walked to the open seat near Sarah.  Sat down.  We can talk, he said.   Singer smiled.  Good.  Great.  She leaned forward, mimicking Ezekiels posture.  Clasped her hands together.  I thought maybe you could help me.   Ya, Jeb said, smiling.  That is what I should do.  He glanced at the stove in the corner.  Realized he wouldnt be using it this year.  Felt a twinge of regret.  Especially for all the stacked wood outside.   Mr.  Miller?  Jeb smiled.  You may call me Jeb.   Okay, Jeb.  We are in a hurry.  Our ship, our business, has a schedule to keep.  See, we make deliveries  To where? he asked.   Well, we have a route we keep.  It generally covers ten star systems.  Thats twenty-seven inhabited planets, thirteen planetoids, a couple manmade stations  Jeb rocked back in his chair.  Twenty-seven planets? He looked at Sarah and Ezekiel.  And our new planet is one of those?  Singer smiled.  Actually, no, those are just the planets on our normal route.  There are nearly a hundred known habitable planets.  Many are in the process of being groomed.  Yours will be one of the newly groomed.   Groomed? Jeb asked.   Singer gestured toward the front windows.  The same process that engineered this planet, undoubtedly.  But decades more sophisticated.   Jeb frowned.  A new irony occurred to him.  The fact that, despite generations of hard labor, the planet they lived on was a product of technology, as well.  Not simply the hard work of the Amish.  If they were to board these rescue ships, the Amishers would be depending on others who were using technology.  He harrumphed to end the thought.   Jeb? Singer said.  Did I lose you?  He shook his head.  Not at all.  I think I understand perfectly.  You want my help in speeding the process along.   Decisions can be a difficult thing, she said.  I know.   And who knows what the pastors will decide, he said.  It is likely theyll decide to stay.   Concern touched her face.  Truly? But the evidence on your sun is irrefutable.  She pursed her lips.  Would it help if I met with them?  That would doubtless make it worse.   But theyll die! Theyll lose everything.   What does it profit a man to gain the world, but lose his soul? Sarah said.  Matthew 16:26.   Thats in the Bible, Jeb said, looking at Singer.  In case you didnt know.   She drew back a little.  Oh, I know, Jeb.  Believe me.   You people know the Word in your universe then?  Some do, she said.  In some places.   Jeb studied her for a time.  He then looked at Sarah and sighed.  And what do you think, my frau?  She looked at her lap, seeming sad.  I dont want to lose our settlement, our home.  But  He nodded.  Weve waited a long time to have a child on the way.   She looked at him, eyes wide.  Is that selfish?  He shook his head.  No.  I feel the same way.   Family is the first community, Ezekiel said.  The most important.   Jeb frowned.  Nodded.  Took a deep breath.  If I could, I would go to each family individually.  Attempt to convince them.  To save as many as I can.   Singer looked perplexed.  But you cant do that? She glanced at Ezekiel.  Ezekiel told me about the recent vote.  About how you were among the potential pastors.  That must mean something.  People would listen to you.   If I go behind the leaders back, the first family I talk to will go to the pastors with what Im doing.  And if not them, then the next family or the next.   Singers eyes widened.  Theyd report you? Turn you in?  To save my soul from damnation? That they would.  Jeb glanced at the stove again.  And perhaps I should thank them for their kindness.   Singer crossed her legs, leaned forward again.  And the consequences for you if the leaders found out youd been talking to families?  Jeb managed a smile.  Shunning, and excommunication.  He looked at Sarah.  And in a world like this, such a sentence might kill you.  Here, a man needs what others have grown.  The work of their hands.  As they need his.  He shook his head.  Repentance comes quickly on Alabaster.  It has to.   Singer looked from Sarah to Jeb to Ezekiel.  So what can we do? she asked.  Nothing?  Jeb sniffed, gave her a half-smile.  Nee, we can always do something, he said.   Whats that?  Pray.           A day later, the decision was reached.   There were other smaller communities on the planet, of course, each with its own bishop and deacons, some more than a days walk away.  But the others were philosophically linked to the Lancaster community, Jebs community, and even after generations, still had familial ties here as well.  Whatever they did, the others would certainly do.   A meeting was called at the Mast homestead.  Theirs was not the largest of homes, but they did have the largest barn.  And that was what it would require to house all those necessary to ratify the leaders decision.   During the time of their stay, Singer and the others had managed to procure clothing in keeping with the Ordnung.  It was a hassle, and absolutely outside her wardrobe comfort zonecertainly not Guild-approvedbut it was necessary.  She thought it would showcase her leadership and decision-making skills, so she had done it.   She and Darly, both dressed in grey dresses with kapps, rode inside Jeb and Sarahs buggy.  Sarah had felt ill and had stayed home.  Ezekiel had taken her place inside the Millers buggy.  Thankfully, it had seating enough for four.  It was modestly comfortable.  It wouldve been better if they couldve simply flown in one of the shuttles, of course, but that was out of the question.  Singer was just glad they didnt have to walk.  It was raining, hard.   They stopped at the end of a long row of black buggies, similar in construction to Jebs.  Some were a little longer, some a little shorter or wider, but all were exactly the same color.  And none screamed Look at me! like land vehicles on Freehaven would.  They were just vehicles that served a purpose.  Not that different from the Raven or any of the other delivery ships in the fleet, in fact.   The barn was quite long and painted white.  There was a white fence trailing off a long ways behind it.  Two teenage boys approached Jebs buggy, and taking the reins from Jeb, secured the horses.  Jeb and Ezekiel stepped out, and offered Singer and Darly their hands.  As she exited, she noticed how muddy and mixed with manure the ground on the other side of the fence was.  She was glad the approach to the front of the barn was mostly grass.  Though it was quite slick.   Ezekiel opened an umbrella and offered it to her.  He did the same for Darly, who smiled sheepishly.  Singer walked around behind the buggy, and together they followed the grass near the dirt road.  Some form of pavement would stay cleaner and more level, obviously, but she guessed that paving technology wasnt on the list of approved devices here.  A pity.   The large barn doors were wide open.  At the entrance, standing just out of the rain, were more men greeting the participants.  To each they nodded and, with a word and a hand motion, directed them inside.  The main room of the barn was vast and surprisingly well litespecially since there was only gas lighting available.  On the left side was a long cattle pen, and the exterior wall there had windows all the way down.  There were also large windows in the second story, above the loft.   Already hundreds of Amish were gathered.  There was some seating available, but a glance showed that to be designated for the groups elderly or ill.  Singer noticed Darly studying this group.  No doubt diagnosing afflictions and planning root canals.  Beyond the seats stood several groups of Amish.  All talking in quiet voices.  Some looked at Jeb.   Singer found herself walking with her head down.  Though she feared no ill treatment, she still felt the outsider.  And she was just present to observe.  Not interfere.  Better to be discreet.   She followed Jeb and Ezekiel to one corner of the room, over near the cattle pen.  She winced as the odor of the livestock became apparent.  Even though she was from a high-tech farming background, with animals engineered to be nearly maintenance-free, the smell of manure was impossible to eliminate completely.  And it never quite left the mind.   She glanced at the cattle, most of which were lying in the mud-caked straw.  They looked fairly sedate.  Moving them might not be too hard.  Right now, the loaders were constructing field barriers to keep the more aggressive animals hemmed in.  A black and white cow looked her direction, chewed, and snortedpushing a cloud of breath into the chill air.  Wow, but they looked large.  Heavy.  Awkward.   How did people live like this?  Minutes went by and a continual stream of people entered.  All were dressed the Amish way.  It was surprising how odd it felt, but also familiar.  It wasnt that different, after all, from how those in the Guild dressed.  She had a closet full of Guild clothing.  Just substitute blue for Amish black and grey, and it was all the same.  All a uniform.   Minus the beards.  No one on board had facial hair.  Most men had those follicles, or the growth ability, spliced out.  Why have the hassle? Women did the same with their legs and underarms.   A small commotion started near the barn door.  There was a row of people in front of them now, but Singer was able to see between heads.  Darly stood on her tiptoes, frowning.   The pastors had arrived.  The oldest, Samuel, was in the lead.  On either side of him were Mark and James.  One of the largest land owners, Abraham, came in with them, as well.  It was his barn they all now sheltered in.   There was lots of head nodding and hand clasping.  Aside from a few greeting smiles, though, most everyone looked somber.  Singer thought she understood some of what they felt.  To face leaving everything behind.  Shed done it twice herself.  Once, to school on Cedna, and then again, when shed joined the Guild.   She glanced down at her dress, smiled, and shook her head.  And look at her now.   Mark stepped forward.  He nodded and said, Lets pray.  They all bowed their heads.  Singer and Darly joined them.  Marks was predominately a prayer of thanksgiving.  There was little mention of the coming crisis or the decision at all.  Just a reflection of gratitude and a plea for wisdom.  Singer was surprised.   After the prayer ended, Mark nodded and stepped aside for Samuel.  The older man stood as if his legs and arms had been tied down.  Hands in front, with a black booka Bible, she presumedheld over his waist.   I know youre all aware of what faces us, he said.  Or what the Englishers tell us will happen.  Samuels eyes scanned the crowd.  We have no reason to distrust their sincerity or their honesty.  Indeed, we he indicated the deaconstruly thank them for their diligence and for their concern.  It is admirable.  It adheres to the Words teaching.  A slow nod.  Looking out for your fellow man.  For each other.  It is the foundation of our society, as well.   As you all know, your pastors have met to discuss the Englisher proposal.  He held his book up.  We follow rules.  Rules that are meant to preserve the community.  He grimaced.  But a community that someone is free to easily leave or rejoin is hardly a community at all.  It is just a loose gathering of people.  A gathering often governed by self-interest.  By selfishness.   On Alabaster, we share the good and the bad.  We take whatever God gives us with gratitude, remembering that our final home is not this world but the world to come.  A place where all live in fellowship with the Lord and with each other.   He lowered his head and took a few steps to his left.  So our deliberations led us to an uneasy place.  We are charged with preserving our way of life, yet we face the possibility that that life may end.  He held up a finger.  Took a few more paces.  Unfortunately, that life may end no matter which path we choose.  Neither option guarantees our way of life, so we were left to decide which guarantees more of it.   There are many unknowns, of course.  Will the calamity come, as it has been predicted? And how long will that take? Months? Years? Decades? He turned, began pacing again.  If we choose to go with the Englishers, can we trust them? Are they the good sort of Englisher? Or the bad? Will they take us to the world they promise? And would the long association with them forever change us? Already it has changed us  Samuel paused, looked at the floor, and then up at the people again.  So we decided to put our faith in what we know.  We know God brought us to this planet for a reason.  We know He allowed us to live in it, and to subdue it for our own use.  He controls the growing season from the rainfall to the heartbeat of the man who harvests.  A nod.  Knowing that, certainly He controls the sun and can repair it.  He paused, turning to acknowledge Mark and James.  Nodded at Abraham.  So weve decided we should stay.  Maintain our settlement here.  Trust in Gott.   Singer bit her lip, shook her head.  They cant be serious, she whispered.  This is ridiculous.   Ya, but it is a decision we want to place before the congregation, Samuel said to the crowd.  To hear your voice.  Since we are making no change, it doesnt require ratification by the community.  He smiled.  But your affirmation would be appreciated.   Jebediah had told Singer that typically these meetings were just that: an affirmation of whatever the leaders had decided.  These men were shepherds, after all, leaders chosen by lot.  They were trusted to do Gods will.   She wanted to scream though.  In this instance, their affirmation would be an act of throwing their lives away.  Their sun was dying.  This wasnt a discussion on whether to allow electricity or indoor plumbingit was life or death.   For many seconds, no one spoke.  Singer looked at Jebediah.  Hed said he couldnt help, but what would he do now? Would he challenge the decision? She sensed he was already seen as reckless, as someone who walked the line.  There was a penalty for his having contacted the Guild, whether it was recognized publicly or not.   Weve always been a people of peace, Deacon Mark said.  Every man knowing his heart and standing behind his decision.  With that in mind, wed like to have an affirmation by show of hands.   Hands went up across the barn.  It was unbelievable.  Unacceptable.  She would have to do something.   The bishop nodded, and the hands went down.  So we have a plurality, Samuel said.  The fellowships voice.   Singer couldnt let it stand.  She had to say something.  She started to raise her hand, but before she could, Jeb spoke.   I would like to give my voice, he said.   All heads turned their direction, kapps and dark hats alike.  Jeb stepped into the open space before Samuel and Mark.  As we all know, Jeb said, the Lord led our forefathers to come to Alabaster.  One of those forefathers, my fathers great uncle, was given a machine to hide and rules on how to use it.  He was also given two pieces of glass.   Jeb reached into his coat pocket and brought out something that glinted in the windows light.  He held it up so everyone could see.  These pieces of glass.  He brought that hand down and looked at the glass in his palm.  Moved it with his fingers.  Theyve been secret companions to me, these shining things.  A pair of glasses that, unlike those men commonly wear at my age, seemed to be of little benefit.  Glasses I hated having to use.   He frowned.  But like all of us, they were made for a reason: to reflect and amplify the light of the sun.  And what these pieces of glass tell me is that our sun is changing.  Growing.  Blighting our crops.  Becoming less like the sun we have loved and more like something else.  He gave a slow nod.  The Englishers tell us that this changing of the sun means that it will soon explode, and Im inclined to believe them.  He searched the room.  Even if you dont believe them, you can believe your own eyes.  We all know that something is changing.  That the crops arent as good as they once were.  Not in our fathers time, or our grandfathers.   Jeb slid the glass back into his pocket.  We can be, will be, a community no matter where we go.  Our fathers proved that when they came here to Alabaster from some other world.  They made the right choice to leave where they were and come here, to a new place.  Now it is our turn.  We can be a communitythis Lancaster communitysomewhere else.  You are good people.  People I trust and admire.  He indicated the pastors.  I know our pastors arent familiar with my special glass, with how it works.  Id be glad to show them if they like.  Jeb nodded.  But I believe we need to go with the Englishers.  To be a community on some other world.  We need to pack up our animals and, like the ancient Hebrews, go where God leads.   Mark looked stunned, almost hurt.  Samuel stood with his head bowed and seemed to be praying.  James shook his head.   Singer suddenly realized that Jebs speech was out of line.  A breach of some protocol, of the rules the Amish lived by.  The Ordnung.   Samuels eyes opened and he nodded slowly.  Danki, Jebediah.  The ministers have met with you previously and considered your opinion.  Samuel scanned the room.  We were aware of his tests when we made our decision.  He searched the room.  We will take another vote.  Those in favor of staying, as we have decided, please raise your hands where I can see.   Singer held her breath.  Looked around the room.  Fewer than half the hands were up now.  A few more trickled up slowly, but a couple also rose and came down.  She couldnt see for sure.  She couldnt really count them all, but she was hopeful.  Definitely Jebs speech had helped.   Samuel was silent for a long while, only his eyes moving as he counted.  Finally, he cleared his throat, straightened himself.  It appears that weve decided to leave then.  A nod.  We will prayerfully prepare for that.   Singer wanted to cheer, but she said nothing.  Bit her lip to keep from smiling.  Darly was now looking at the floor.  Shaking her head.  Possibly trembling.   Samuel frowned, glanced at the other leaders.  Sadly, we have another piece of business to attend to.  He raised his eyes to the crowd.  The leadership will accept the congregations opinion.  We will go with the Englishers and pray the Lord preserve us.  However He looked Jebs direction.  Jebediah Miller, in front of all these present, speak the truth: Were you warned by the leadership not to interfere? To abide by the leaderships decision?  Jebediah nodded.  I was.   And yet you spoke just now, clearly swaying the people from what their pastors had chosen for them.  A slow head shake.  It is therefore my unhappy duty to remove you from our fellowship.  At least until that time that you repent of your ways.   Singer clenched her fists together.  Hes being shunned, she realized, for doing whats right.  For saving their lives! She wanted to scream.  To lash out.  But that wouldnt help anything.   So, do you repent? Samuel asked.   I followed my conscience, Jeb said.   Samuel scowled.  Very well, he said.  We remove you from fellowship.   You should remove me too, Ezekiel said.  I agree with Jeb.   He was a noble young man, this Ezekiel.  He would make a good crewmember.   Samuel held up a hand.  Ezekiel, we will warn you for your support of Jebediah, but we will not excommunicate you today.  Willfulness and pride are not common to you.   But I helped him, Zeke said.  I encourage the move, as well.   And you have been warned, Samuel said.   But  Enough.   The wind shifted, and Singer got a strong whiff of cattle.  She brought her hand to her nose.  Coughed.   Sei se gut, for Jebediahs good, Samuel said to the assembly, do not associate with him until he is willing to confess his sins and ask for forgiveness.  Do not fellowship with him.  Do not share a meal with him.  Do not laugh or mourn with him.  Samuels frown deepened.  Now, it appears we all have work to do.  Please get instructions from the Englishers in regards to what you may bring.  We will have a meeting at a later time to wish Alabaster goodbye.   Be on your way, all of you, Deacon Mark said.  Go in peace.       11    Again in the Ravens fore section, Seal reached the maze of triangle offices directly beneath the pilots bubble.  He stopped at the first office he encountered.  It was occupied by a dark-complexioned man wearing a standard blue Guild sweater and beige slacks.   I need to get the latest scheduling ledgers from corporate, Seal said.  Can you tell me who the current SB operator is?  The man looked flummoxed.  Sorry, Captain, I really dont know.  Isnt it Crewmember Singer? He brought a hand to his head.  Blond hair.  Attractive.  A bit shy.   Seal shook his head.  Shes on the planet, he said.  Heading the relocation effort.  A scowl.  Dont you people read your bulletins?  The mans eyes widened.  Sorry, sir, everyones busy.  Weve lost people to medical and to loading and to  Seal raised a hand.  Frowned.  His com unit chirped then.  He waved dismissively and moved away, back toward one of the interior walls.  People were bustling everywhere, he noticed.  Though there was still way too much talking for him.  Productivity, people! He detached his com unit from his belt and brought it up where he could see it.  Accepted the link.   The screen flickered, and the image of a woman with a strange grey head covering appeared.  Who is calling me? Then Seal realized who it was.  What are you wearing, Singer? he asked.   She felt her head.  Smiled.  A kapp.  You like it?  He sniffed.  Is that local dress?  Yes  A pause.  I suppose I shouldve looked at the pictures.   The pictures?  In your report.  I read it.  He looked in the direction of the first triangle.  Unlike how most people treat the bulletins  Seal?  He shook his head.  Never mind.  Seal reached the interior wall, turned right, and started to pace along it, following the front row of triangles.  He smiled.  So how do things stand?  She smiled.  Theyve decided to go, she said.  Finally.   Seal felt a wave of relief.  They could still maintain their schedule.  Make their stops.  Thats good, he said.  I knew you could do it.   She shook her head.  It wasnt me.  It was Jebediah Miller.   Who?  Our signal sender.  Our contact? He convinced people.  Unfortunately.   Unfortunately?  Yes, unfortunately.  Unfortunately for him.   For him? I would think any outcome not including incineration is a good one.   Yes, well, it is complicated.  Hes been shunned.   Shunned Seal searched his memory.  I remember reading about that.  A loss of fellowship or something, correct?  Yes, hell lose all contact with the group.  It is a tragic turn.   Seal studied Singers kapp.  Is it?  Singer frowned.  Well, for them it is.  It means no one can talk to him.  His wife can live with him, but she might still participate in the shunning.  Take her meals at separate tables or have lessinterplay.  She shrugged.  You know.   Seal fought off a blush.  Singer.  That wasnt in the report.  Really?  Different groups have different rules, she said.  But Jebediahs situation has another complication: Sarahs pregnant.   Pregnant! On my ship? He felt a sudden need to get to his desk again.  To see what supplies they had in storage.  Baby supplies? What does a baby need? He should contact Darly.  Could they handle?  Shes a long time off yet, Seal.  Months.   Seal relaxed.  Ah A conversation started at the triangle to his right.  Two large women in overly tight Guild full body suits.  They looked like blueberries.  Seal winced and paced back the other way.   Singer shrugged.  The Amish have a penchant for children, however.  It is quite possible one of the others  I should be sitting down, he said.  At my desk.   Singer chuckled.  Children are fine, Seal.  Dont worry.  Theyre just little people.   Yes, but babies He wasnt sure why hed never pictured babies.  He also wasnt sure hed adequately pictured the livestock, either.  What about the animals? he asked.   She wrinkled her nose.  Smelly.  All of them.  Were going to have to have Darly tweak the air processors.   He nodded.  Well have her check those over.  Yes.   Anyway, the first load should begin tomorrow morning.   He really needed his desk.  Well be ready.  Anything else?  Yes, I wonder if we have quarters available.  Not in the bay with the others.   Seal squinted.  You mean crew quarters? For who?  For Jebediah.  The Amish wont have him.   Really needed his desk.  What! Indefinitely?  Well, hes shunned until he repents.  Im not sure how that will work out or if he will repent.  It isnt punishment, but they are trying to change his behavior.  She frowned.  Anyway, I just thought it would be good if he had a place away from the others.  In case he needed it.   Sounds like hes the only man there worth having aboard.   I wouldnt say that, Seal.  They just have their own ledgers to balance.   He smiled at the reference.  Nice, Singer.  Doesnt change my opinion.  He twisted his lip.  As to the quarters, Ill have to check.  We can probably find him something.  It is a big ship.   Singer nodded.  Thank you, sir.   No problem, Seal said.  And Singer.   Yes, Seal?  Where does your replacement sit? I need the updated schedule on the scraddlebox.  From corporate.   She smiled.  I can help with that.   I thought you might.           Greels made his way to Congis quarters.  If he was right that Congi had gotten into the science remnant package, then Congi wouldve had to have done so during his free timehis sleeping time.  That meant he would be tired and back in his room sleeping it off.   Greels checked the duty roster.  Congi was supposed to be on duty now, but he hadnt passed his first passkey check.  That meant he was at his quarters.  Another thing to bust him over.  After Greels squeezed the weasel for whatever hed taken.   Greels hadnt decided if hed just keep the material for himself or report Congi and let the captain, and ultimately corporate, deal with him.  It depended on what had been taken.  It would serve the cleaner right to spend the rest of the trip behind a field in confinement, though.  Bet that would seriously affect his side business.  Not being able to find every night.   Regardless, Congi was going to feel worse when Greels was through with him.  He had been where he wasnt supposed to be, and he would pay.  Thats what Greelss princess would want.  He was sure of it.  He was protecting her belongings, her honor.   All the cleaners quarters were in the same part of the shipport and aft.  More remote than even Greelss office.  As he entered the slideway from the main slide to the lower level, Greels noticed how dim and dusty it seemed.  How smeared the overhead surface was.  It was like the cleaners didnt work their own section at all.   Greels scowled.  Another thing to put on a report.  And he knew how much Captain Drake liked reports.  That guy was always pushing data.   Greels reached the bottom of the slideway and stepped off.  The floor was dirty too.  He even saw tracks of mud in some places.  How does that happen? We havent touched a planet in weeks.  He shook his head, grunted.  He made the short walk to the nearest hallway.  From there, he pulled out his com unit and checked the built-in Raven map.  Congis quarters were to the left and then rightnumber E75.  He turned left.  Scowled.   He passed a dozen doors and reached a small lounge on his left.  It contained a handful of comfortable looking chairs and an entertainment screen.  There was also a large grey pot on the floor in the far left corner.  Remnants of a plant stuck out of it.  It was a tropical blenda gene splice of three or possibly four different plantswith a silky looking trunk and broad leaves.  Every lounge had at least one such plant.  Green was deemed necessary for Guild space routes.  Supposedly it helped keep people sane.   Except the leaves here were all wilted and brown.  Again, he was surprised.  Usually shipboard plants were nearly indestructible.  Hed seen them survive being spit on, juggled, watered with illicit beverages, low light and low water.  But this one was just dead-dead.   Cleaners.   He reached the place where he was to turn, only to find a section of overhead lights out and one that was flickering.   He turned right.  Congis place was only seven doors away.  As he reached the midpoint, a door on his right opened and a short young woman stepped out.  She had tightly-curled hair and an off-grey outfit.  Her clothing was way outside of regulations, even for a cleaner.  She dragged a cleaners cart out with her, though.  It hovered and had an assortment of tools.  Her tools were stacked mostly into a small pyramid on top.  She gave him a little sad smile and pushed her cart past him, back toward the intersection.   Greels hoped she wasnt working anywhere near the captain.  Shed get busted out, for sure.  Demoted to dirt loader.  Or maybe clean the oncoming livestock.  Yeah, that would be a good job for her.  Right there with Congi.   Greels waited for the woman to move around the corner.  No sense yelling with people around.  She glanced once in his direction before passing into the dark area of the intersection.  When the one flickering light finally lit again, she was gone.   Greels turned to Congis door.  To the left was a control pad, which he passed his hand over.  It should alert Congi of his presence.   No response.  Greels tried the pad again.  Waited.  Still no response.   He checked both directions of the hall.  Wondered where else the cleaner would be.  Someone like Congi typically had few real friends.  People who wanted to buy stolen articles cheaply, sure.  But Hey, lets go to lunch! friends? No.   Greels used a knuckle to tap on the door as he bent closer and called Congis name.  He waited, listened, and thought he heard a cough.  Or something.  Enough to convince him that someone was in there.  He shook his head again.  Grunted.   Thankfully, he had a supervisor passkey.  It could get him into any subordinate room.  That meant loaders and cleaners.  So much for privacy.  He brought the key out and laid it against the control pad.  The screen flashed and went green.  The door slid open.   The first thing Greels noticed was the smell.  It wasnt the smell of rot, necessarily.  More like the scent of wet clothes left in a heap somewhere.  The smell of a heavy day of work, in the rain.  Yeah, that was it.   Directly ahead was the rooms excretorium, with the door standing wide open.  Perhaps that was the problem? Though ships restrooms were supposedly scent resistant, Greels knew that wasnt always the case.  Without thinking, he reached out and closed that door.  Smell still remained, though.   The door closure didnt reveal much of the room either.  To start with, the lights were very dim.  So dim that Greels had to squint.  He contemplated putting the lights full up, but something kept him from doing it.  An instinct, maybe.   The closet spaces were on the wall to his right, and every door there appeared to be open.  The nearest one was just past the excretorium.  It blocked out much of the room beyond.  Synthetic wrappers spilled out of the closet.  They were scattered about the floor too.  Some of these were clearly from finds Congi had made.  A lack of discretion on his part.  Others appeared to be the wrappings from the ships quickfood dispensers.  Greels stepped forward and glanced into the open closet.   Guild clothing was mounded into a heap on the closet floor, along with more synthetic wrappings.  Mostly food wrappings here: everything from fruit purees to Black Magic candy bars.  It was an outrageous display.  A hideous lack of discipline and hygiene.  Especially for someone who cleaned for a living.   Some clothing hung out of the closet like blue intestines.  Frowning, Greels gathered these up, threw them into the closet, and closed the door.  He closed the upper closet door as well.  Then there was a second door, and beyond that, another.  The floor was littered with clothing and sealing material and actual food remnants.   The reason for the smell was more obvious now.  Greels stepped around as much of the litter as he could, grimacing when his foot found something that squished beneath it.  He swore.  Congi, he said, no longer whispering.  No longer polite.  Are you in here?  The bedroom area was around a corner formed by the excretorium space.  A few steps more, a few more doors closed, and Greels could make out the shadow of the bed.  The bed was rectangular, of course, but this one looked rounded somehow.  Oddly shaped.   It took a few more steps before Greels realized what he was seeing.  The oddity of the bed was due to the large collection of refuse around it.  Large piles of wrapping material.  Most of it from foodstuffs.  An enormous amount.  Enough to feed five people for days.   There was the shadow of a prone figure in the center of the bed.  He was laid out completely straight, arms close to his side.  Greels brought his com unit up and held it so the screen illuminated the figure.  It was Congi.  And he was completely naked.   Greels winced and fished around on the floor until he found a shirt, which he then threw over the cleaners midsection.  As angry as he was with the cleaner for what hed done, for his unwanted invasion into Bay 16, Greels now felt really uncomfortable.  Like he really shouldnt be here.   Greels shook the feeling away.  He was the supervisor here.  Everything hed done had been legal and on the level.  But CongiCongi had overstepped.  He was wrong, wrong.  In need of punishment.   Greels played the com units light along Congis torso.  His chest and abdomen were much tighter than Greels expected.  More defined.  Especially with Congi lying down.  During the times Greels had encountered him, the cleaner had always appeared to be carrying a gut around.  But such was clearly not the case.  There was the possibility, of course, that Congi had always been hiding stuff in his shirt.  Hmm  Greels paused the light over a section of Congis chest and right arm.  The skin seemed odd there.  Slightly discolored.  Greyer.  Greels grunted and brought the light up to Congis neck.  It too was discolored.  Splotchy and grey.  Greels moved up to the cleaners face.  Congi, he said.  Youre missing your shift, bub.  And I know what youve been up to.   No reaction.   Despite his discomfort, Greelss anger percolated.  How does a guy sleep like that?  Congi, he said, a little louder this time, you need to get up now.  Get up and get some clothes on.  Weve got a big shipment coming in.  If we didnt need all the help, Id bust you to security.   Still no response, though the up-down of Congis chest appeared to increase in tempo.  Dreaming, maybe?  This is ridiculous.  Greels had work to do.  Everyone had work to do.  Plus, there was the princess to think of.  To check on.   Congi!  Congis eyes snapped open.  They stared, somewhat mindlessly, straight ahead and then slowly rotated Greelss direction.   Congi.  Sorry to wake you, but we need to talk.  I know what you did.  Going into Bay 16.  Opening the container.  It isnt right.  You got to give me the stuff backand dont do it again.   Congi just continued to look his direction.  Staring, unspeaking.   Realizing he was still hovering closely over Congi, Greels took a step back.  He kept the light on Congis face, though.  Congi, bud, are you up?  More staring.  Unblinking.  And no motion in the face at all.  Not even a twitch.   Fear crept up Greelss spine.  Something here was not right.  What is wrong with you? He motioned toward the shirt hed covered Congi with.  Sorry about the shirt.  You wereyou knowall out there, man.   Congi made a deliberate intake of breath.  Then he started to moan, low and harsh.  Almost unearthly.   Greels retreated so fast he almost tripped.  The light in his hand dropped.  He retrieved it and checked Congis face again.  Still staring.  Eyes framed in red.  And he was inhaling again.   Greels backed up, shoved debris out of the way, cursed.  Backed up some more.  Okay, man, Ill get you some help.  Youre not right.  Something He stumbled again.  Bad wrong with you.  He pushed past one of the closet doors that had somehow reopened.  Checked Congi.   He was still staring.  Still unmoving.  He moaned again, harsher, hollower.   Greels found the door.  Opened it.  Stumbled out into the hall.   Closed the door.  Almost felt relief when the control pad flashed red to show the room was locked again.   That was He touched his head, smoothed his hair on one side past his ear.  Ive got to get that Darly woman.  Yeah, thats it.  He hustled up the hall.  Wow          The transformation was nothing short of spectacular, in a rural-and-backwards sort of way.  Seal stood on one of the overhead outlooks just taking it all in.   One end of Bay 17the foreside, to his lefthad been subdivided into livestock pens.  In most places, actual wooden or synthetic fences had been erected, and within those pens were already dozens of animals.  Their brays and caterwauls echoed throughout the chamber.  Their scent was everywhere.   In other places, individual animals were restrained within small-scale field generators.  These were used, Seal had been told, primarily for those animals that were particularly difficult to controlrutting bulls and boars, stallions and the like.  Things with horns or tusks or hooves.  In some rare cases, fields were also used for those that were deemed most loud or odoriferous.   Seals preference wouldve been to enclose all the livestock within generator fields.  The ship had only so many units available, though.  And fields were steady power consumers.  Their use had to be limited.  Sadly.   Loading the animals had been a bit of a chore, as well.  They couldnt just open the upper bay door and drop them in, after all.  The ship hadnt come outfitted with temperature neutral and oxygen-rich packing cubes.  There was no reason it should be.  Live shipments were typically accomplished via low monitor cryomatrix, and even then, the responsibility of packing was all on the shipping customer.  Not on them.  Not on the Guild.  Your pet dies in transit because a seal slipped, thats your problem.   Seal shook his head.  The Guild motto claimed wed take care of the moving.  Not the packing.  Not the preserving.  But with this job, so much of it was about the packing.   Regardless, they had managed.  The larger or more dangerous animals had been shuttled directly to the bay floor.  As for the more docile animalscrates had been built to carry them down the slideways.  An interesting sight, to say the least.  Lots of video captures had been done by the crew.  Doubtless for later scraddle release to the universal network.  Look what the Shipping Guild is up to now! Boxing roosters and rabbits! The vid would be used by friends and rivals alike for centuries, no doubt.   Seal caught a whiff of something particularly noxious.  Active excretion by some animal.  On his ship.  With a little searching he was able to locate a large beasta cow, he thought it waswith its tail hefted high.  Dung dropping out vertically.  Even the ventilation systems couldnt keep ahead of that smell.  Especially when it was multiplied.   Seal was glad the floors could be rendered frictionless.  It would make cleanup so much easier later.  Provided they survived this shipment.   Seal shook his head.  Though it was a small amount of shipping weight, the job seemed very, very large.  Moving an entire settlement? Outrageous.  Hadnt been done in decades.   There were several people on the floor below, as well.  Most were on the aft end, opposite the animal pens.  Loaders assembling temporary housing for the Amish.  These were mostly synthetic cubicles.  Easy to clean yet large and private enough for families to live in.   Portable excretoriums had been installed at the end of every row of cubes.  Thankfully, the Amish didnt require much in the way of luxury.  And thankfully, the Raven had a few portables onboard.   Also on the floor below was Singer.  Even now she showed her worth.  Supervising, keeping the details in line.  As Seal watched, Singer conferred with a pair of loaders over some specific of the floor plan.  She held up a portable data device and pointed to it, and then to an area near the exterior wall.  The loaders nodded, checked her device, and studied the place where she had pointed.   Seal smiled.  Hed made a good decision with that one.  She was decisive, informed, and all-around useful.  Aside from the initial delay, there had been few hiccups.  Singer would have a ship of her own someday.   Somehow, that idea made Seal sad.  He brought his hands behind his back.  Frowned.  Wondered at himself.  At his lack of emotional objectivity with that particular crewmember.  She was quality.  Intelligent and attractive.   Pair bonding was complicated now, though.  More ledgers and charts than any shipping operation.  Lots of consequences and escape clauses.  A matter where the risks often outweighed the potential gains.   Even so, Seal considered riding one of the slides down to be with her.  To help her in any way he could.  To talk.  Smile.   But he decided against it.  He would just be in the way down there.  There were a hundred more cubicles to erect.  Supplies to procure or construct.  Would they need toys for the children? Plus, there were medical treatments to schedule.  Darly wanted to perform a checkup on everyone.  Especially the younger ones.  Make sure their inoculations were up to date.   Disease was always a worry with isolated communities.  The organisms they were accustomed to had decadescenturies evenof parallel development to those the crew was commonly exposed to.  Better to be overly cautious in that regard.  Better to be safe.  Already there had been some resistance to medical exams, of course.  Seal frowned.  Stepped back onto the slideway.   The Amish were coming.       12    Now Samuel knew how Jonah mustve felt.   He and dozens of others from the community were huddled on the floor in the belly of one of the flying carriages.  Leather straps gave them some form of security, though the Singer woman had assured them it was just a precaution.  Not a necessity.  The sensation would be like floating in a pond, shed said.  Like riding a raft.  They would be able to stand and not lose their balance, regardless of the motion of the craft.  Or sit comfortably, enjoying the ride.   Samuel did not find that to be true.  It seemed to him that he noticed every bump and turn the carriagethe shuttle, as the Englishers called ithad made since theyd left the ground.  Others in the party seemed not so afflicted, so perhaps it was his age.  His aching joints.  But so far, the trip had not been pleasant.   This is Egan, your captain.   It was a shocking thing, this voice.  Samuel knew it to belong to the young man in the head of the shuttle, the one steering, but he was outside of earshot.  And the door between the compartments was closed.  Doubtless locked.  Yet somehow he could still hear his voice.   I hope youre doing okay back there, Egan continued.  I know this is bound to seem weird to you, but we actually are moving.  Were many kilometers up, in fact.  A pause, perhaps so the full frightening impact of that statement could sink in.  Since I know this is a new experience for you all, I thought Id open the visors so you could look out.   Yes, Samuel thought.  This was very much like Jonahs journey.  Called, forced to do something he very much did not want to do.  When Samuel told the story he never left out how inherently brutal the Assyrians had been.  They were the embodiment of evil.  Their enemies werent just killed or subduedthey were flayed and their skin was spread over the city walls.  Many were crucified or impaled on pikes.  To reach Nineveh, Jonah would doubtless have had to travel a road lined with those pikes.  Who could blame the prophet for being a bit afraid? A bit hesitant?  Suddenly, the sides of the ship seemed to disappear.  There was a collective gasp from everyone around him.  Then there were shrieks and someone whimpered, Well fall out! Well fall out! All bent closer to the floor, and most clutched the restraining straps.  Some shut their eyes, shielded their children.   It was as if they were sitting atop a fuzzy white and blue mound.  The highest mountain that had ever been built.  Samuel held his tongue.  He just gaped, frightened and unsettled.   Im sorry, everyone, the pilot said.  I probably shouldve warned you.  There is no danger here.  Were all protected.  All safe.  The wall is still there, just transparent at the moment.  I wanted you to see out, is all.  Sorry again.   Samuel shook his head.  So this was the circle of the earth that the prophet Isaiah had written of.  Did the prophet have any idea? Had the Lord given him a glimpse of this perspective? Of His perspective? It was a monstrous thing.  Unfit for human beings.  Glory, glory, Samuel whispered.   The blue disc began to recede below them.  The darkness above only increased.  It was a starlit night without end.  A representation of Gods infinity.  And they hung amidst it.  No wheels.  No ground.  Trespassers in a place where only angels belonged.  Hed heard stories as a child, but they did it no justice.   Samuel put his Bible on his stomach and hunched over it.  Closed his eyes.  Whispered a prayer for strength and for Gods holy will.  For protection.   Deacon Mark was to Samuels right.  He placed an arm on Samuels back.  How are you, Samuel?  Samuel nodded to close his prayer.  Looked Marks direction.  I gird myself as to battle, brother.   Mark smiled tentatively.  It is disconcerting.   Unnatural, is what it is, Samuel said.  But we will persevere.   Mark nodded.  Let him who lays his hand on the plow never look back.   Oh, yes, Samuel whispered, rocking forward.  He purposely avoided looking at that exterior darkness.  At the stars that shone like predatory eyes at night.  Onward in the Lords will.  Always onward.   Deacon James would come in a later shuttle, but if he were here now, usually this was where he might break into song.  A hymn would be welcome at this point.  Anything to reinforce the feeling of togetherness.  Samuel wished James was with them.  But the shepherds were few.  And there was so much to be wary of.  To warn others of.   All right, Egans voice said, if you look off to your left, youll see our ship, the Raven.   Samuel raised his head again.  There were no birds known as ravens on Alabaster, but he was familiar with the name.  It was used often in Scripture.  The raven had been the first bird Noah had released from the ark after the Flood.  The prophet Elijah had been fed by ravens.   Samuel had always wanted to see a raven.   Who prepares for the raven its nourishment, when its young cry to God and wander without food? Mark said, quoting the book of Job.   Samuel nodded, straightened his hat, looked to the left.   And gasped.  It was a leviathan, this thing the Englishers were bringing them to.  It was incredibly large, angular, and deep blue.  Its size was hard for Samuel to judge, but he would guess it at over a mile in length.  Possibly more.  It was half again as wide.   It isnt as frivolous as I expected, Mark said.  At least theres that.   Samuel nodded.  It was true: Aside from the color and some gloss lettering, the Raven had very little distinction whatsoever.  It reminded him most of an elongated rhombus, with gradual sloping in front and in back.  The only real peculiarity he could see was a small area where it bubbled in the center on top, very near the front of the ship.   Yes, thats our ship, Egan said.  She isnt much to look at, but shes a workhorse.  Able to transport nearly two million metric tons of parcels throughout this spiral arm.  Entirely self-sufficient and staffed by a crew of only three hundred.   We will be the majority here, then, Mark said.  If all the communities come.   Samuel nodded again.  He held his Bible at his chest again.  He could feel his heartbeat through it.   If you look at the front, youll see a small circular area, a bubble, Egan said.  Thats where I typically work.  The pilots bubble, though some call it a nest.  A smile entered his voice.  Dont worry, though, the other pilot is up there now.  Probably can see us, and is worried I might scuff the paint.   Their perspective of the larger ship began to change.  It shifted to the left and then started to grow larger.  And larger.  Again Samuel was taken by the immensity.  How could men build such a thing? How could they be so bold and terrible? So haughty.   He looked around at those with them.  Mothers and daughters.  Fathers and sons.  Many looked at him in return.  Frightened but courageous.  As their people always had been.   Were starting our approach now, Egan said.  The landing bay is ahead.   A door in the side of the Raven became obvious.  It too was geometric.  Like a pyramid with a flattened point.  As they watched, it began to open.  Beyond, Samuel could see white lights.  If he squinted, he could almost imagine them as teeth.   Here we go then, he said.  Into the belly of the great fish.           It was a difficult time to be shunned.  Uncomfortable, uncertain.  Even more than it would be at any other time.  Jebediah had to rely on the kindness of his closest friends, Ezekiel especially, to look out for his livestock.  To ensure that some of his animals got loaded.  He hadnt been able to assist in the selection, though.  He had only to hope that the able bodiesthose most likely to make the tripwere the ones gathered and sent.  He still wasnt sure about his future livelihood at all.  What was a miller without his mills? His tools? No one was thinking about those things.  Not for him.   Even the last moments with Sarah, those times spent gathering the few items they shared, had been awkward.  Quiet.  Neither of them knowing exactly how it should transpire.  The Ordnung allowed them to still share the same home, because nothing should separate what God had joined.  In silence Jebediah watched her load boxes for the trip.  He noticed how difficult it was for her even to do her usual chores.  He helped, of course.  Loaded what boxes he could.  But silently.  Behaving like the shunned should behave.  As an outcast.   Then, when the scheduled day of departure had come, theyd gotten into their buggy and set out for the clearing near the trading post, the prearranged meeting place.  Thats where they were headed now.  Many had already left, he knew.  Reached the ship named Raven.  The bishop and Deacon Mark, for instance.  The crucial livestock had been gone for days.   It was an odd feeling, as they drove.  Their settlement had always been a quiet one, but now every house was silent.  The buildings and barns were just shells, holding nothing.  Remnants of a life lost.   Jeb frowned as they approached the Carpenter residence.  Their pasture was entirely empty, aside from one solitary Holstein cow, doubtless ill or elderly.  It raised its head to watch them.  Slowly chewed its cud.  Eyes dark as midnight.  Fur white with large black spots.  When they reached the fencerow, the cow gave a long mournful cry.  A final sendoff.  Or a warningJeb couldnt tell which.  Either way, it was sad.  A situation hed created, intentionally or not.   After more silent travel, they reached the trading post.  There were dozens of buggies lined up, more than had been at the meeting.  They filled the covered parking stalls and overflowed into the roadside beyond.  One black buggy after another.  All the same.  All now like salt that had lost its saltiness: cast out and useless.   Beyond those was a single Englisher shuttle.  Groups of Amishers were loading from the tail end.  Englishers directed them.  One held a rifle, as if the presence of a crowd was reason enough to bear arms.  There was no disturbance here, though.  Everything was orderly.   This is foolishness, Sarah said then.   Jebediah guided the buggy to the end of the long row and halted the horse.  Looked at Sarah.  Surprised.  What is? he said.  The leaving?  She shook her head.  Nee, not that.  Your shunning.  Our silence.  You saved us all.   Jebediah shrugged.  They are trying to maintain the principle.  I can respect that.  We should respect that.   Then why dont you just repent and give them what they want?  Jeb smiled.  Because I have principles too.   Fire lit her eyes.  You are a silly man.  A proud man.   He nodded slowly.  That may be.   Jeb got out of the buggy and hurried around to help Sarah.  With a guiding arm he brought her safely to the ground.  He offered her a quick smile, but she was having none of it.  She instead slid by him and bustled in the direction of the ship.  Jeb shrugged and followed.   A full minute later, they reached the head of the buggy line.  I apologize, she said to Jeb.  Our child plays with my emotions.  More so than you ever have.   I can be grateful for that, then, he said.  I have a fine son.   She turned and looked at him.  Wrinkled her nose.  Or daughter.  She lifted her skirt over a high stand of grass and stepped into the clearing.   The ship was maybe seven paces away now.  The remaining Amishers were beginning to board.  One was Abraham.  He was a large mana hay manand despite many blessings, often a bit cross.  He had his two older sons with him, David and Jonathan.  All three paused to watch Jeb and Sarah approach.  Others turned and looked too but then bowed their heads and moved into the craft.   The rifle man was stationed on the left side of the entrance.  There was an Englisher woman, one he wasnt familiar with, positioned on the right.  Smiling and motioning people in.   Sarah moved to the boarding ramp.  She wasnt yet to the point where the child was cumbersome, but she used extra caution.  This was their first, and theyd waited a long time.  Seeing her timidity, the Englisher woman stepped forward.  Abraham superseded her, though, stepping around in front.  He offered Sarah his forearm, which she grasped.  He led her up the ramp to the opening.   The younger of Abrahams boys, a blond lad, took a couple of steps down to stand in front of Jebediah.  Youre not allowed here.  Only community members.   Jebediah frowned.  Hed worried about such a thing happening.  Yes, hed been able to get most to agree to the move, but as the work of actually moving had progressed, so had the attitude about it.  There was enough momentum to keep it going forward, thankfully, but whispersand his shunningslowly made Jebediah the blame of any inconvenience.  Discomfort could affect even the most pious man.   Sarah was already inside, out of sight.  That, at least, reassured him.  She and the child were safe.  If it came to his staying, he could handle that.  As long as she was safe.   The rifle man had his back to the ramp, busy looking inside.  His finger moved in the air as if he were counting.   This is the last shuttle, the Englisher woman said, looking puzzled.  He has to come with us.   Abrahams oldest son, a brunette with only the start of a beard, joined his brother.  He isnt community anymore.  He isnt allowed to be with us.  It is the law.   Abraham walked back to join his sons.  Ya, my buwes are right.  Unless the shunned wants to repent, he will have to stay.  By himself.   The Englisher woman looked flummoxed.  She brought the shiny tablet she held up to her chest.  Covering it.  This is the last shuttle, she repeated.  Everyone, everything else is loaded.  We have a schedule.  She glanced toward the entrance.  Isnt his wife pregnant? Shell need him.   Abraham straightened.  Community helps community.  His frau will be taken care of regardless.  You wouldnt understand.  He motioned toward Jeb.  But I know he does.   Jeb nodded.  I do.  She will be fine.  He would miss her, though.  Her and the child.   The Englisher woman stepped close.  Gerald, she said in the direction of the entrance.  The man with the rifle was now inside the ship.  Doubtless doing more counting.  He didnt seem to hear.  Gerald! she said again.   Deacon James is aboard, Abraham said.  If you want to repent, Jeb, that would solve everything.   Jeb frowned.  Tell me my sin.   Abraham huffed.  You disrupted everything, he said.  You and your fool machine.   It was my burden.  I did what I was taught  What you were taught? Abraham sneered.  I had to leave my years work to rot in a barn.  A year of wasted effort.  He pointed at his youngest.  He broke an arm helping.  It may never be right again.  Yet all for naught.  Danki for that.  He straightened, shook his head.  You may have saved us, Jebediah.  He glanced at the sky, motioned toward the sun.  But we have sacrificed much.  You too should sacrifice.   Jebediah knew it was just emotions at play.  Regardless of devotion, emotions were always present.  A plow horse that perpetually wants to race.  So it isnt about my salvation, then, Jeb said.  My being right with the Lord.  It is about your hay.   Abraham raised a finger.  Dont paint me the sinner.  Youre the one under discipline.   He bowed his head.  I am.  Im praying our leaders reconsider.   So theyve made a mistake now, is that it?  The Englishers seemed to have disappeared.  As had Sarah.  She had to be worried, though.  Had to wonder what was taking him so long.  Jeb wondered if someone was preventing her from coming back, preventing the Englishers too.  Hed seen tragedy bring out the worst in people.  His mother had gone silent for a week when his father had died.  Didnt smile, didnt talk.  Didnt even go to services.   Or perhaps this was how God willed it to be.  He was to be a shadow Moses.  Able to move the people only so far.  Barred from entrance into Canaan.  Only able to see it from afar, and then never returning from the mountain.  Of course, Moses had sinned in the eyes of God.  Had he too?  Jeb nodded, took a couple of steps back.  God sometimes talked through Christian brothers, he knew.  He was no leader like Moses, but he was certain about the rightness of what hed done.  About informing people.  Sending the signal.  He backed all the way off the ramp.  Straightened his hat and himself.  I will stay here, then.   Abraham gave a slow nod, backed into the opening.  Come now, buwes, he said.   The boys nodded in turn and entered the ship.   Jebediah waited.  Stared resolutely into a darkened door.  Saw no movement.  No one coming to bid him enter.   The doors began to close.  A whining sound came from the front of the craft.  It was a brief introductory noise, one that would diminish and fall silent as the ship lifted into the sky.   Why hadnt he just given the leaders what theyd wanted? Return to fellowship?  Because ultimately, Jeb knew, his sin was nearly unpardonable.           Sarah was lost in the press of people.  Though everyone wore a mask of bravery, of serenity, the air tasted of uncertainty and despair.  The experience was like nothing they were used to.  It was as if they were all being born a third time.  The first physical, the second spiritual, the third now, an intellectual awakening.  Suddenly, they were no longer children of an earthbound God.  They were children of a heavenly One, a larger and more complete One, and that was a frightening thing.   There was no soil under their feet.  Only metal.  Nothing to till or plant.  No control whatsoever.   Abraham placed her, standing, among a group of women near the middle of the ship.  A protected position, not that dissimilar from a child in a womb.  What should be a comfortable position for her.   But Sarah was no less afraid.  What had Jebediah done? She had been so sure of him.  All through the years.  But now she felt so unsettled.  So alone.   And where was he? Why wasnt he here? Holding her hand?  The guardsman moved along the wall to the front of the ship.  In his hands he held a dark weapon.  Doubtless never used for hunting or protection from wild beasts.  Only for war or savagery.  The pervasive fighting the elders had often warned about.  One of the reasons their ancestors had fled to Alabaster long ago.   The guard made a motion with his hand.  Asked them all to sit.  He then instructed them on how to secure themselves to the floor.  Heads nodded, and all began to follow his instructions.  The woman to her right, Eliza, laid a hand on Sarahs side.  Helped her down.  Such kindness wasnt necessary yet.  But it was nice.   Community.   Now seated and secured in place, Sarah could see very little.  Just faces and bodies.  Worried faces.  Bodies hunched as if their last friend had been lost.  Their mood reminded Sarah of how her sister had been after her favorite horse had been shot.  Deflated.   But we shouldnt be so, Sarah thought.  We should be the people of Light.  Even here.  Even about to be swept into darkness.  Regardless of the discomfort.  Regardless of the reason.  Of what Jebediah had done.  She felt sick, but she still wished for his presence.  Wished he could comfort her.   Could he even do that here, though? She searched the surrounding faces again.  Jebediah was shunned.  Hehe knew the truth, their tradition, and had sinned against it.  That was the charge, wasnt it? The fault?  She frowned.  Oh, these men and their pride.  How much it stained them.  How much it held them back.   Her belly vibrated with a tiny movement.  The first reflex of inner life.  She gasped.  Looked behind her again.  Saw that the door was beginning to close.   Jebediah?  Sarah thought she saw Abraham and his two sons near the back.  They were in the process of stooping to the floor.  Strapping themselves in.   The female, the young Englisher, was sliding along the right side of the ship.  Looking concerned.  She reached the guard.  Started discussing something with him.  She nodded toward the back of the ship.  Toward where Jebediah should be.   Sarahs heart sunk.  And as if the child noticed, there was another internal movement.   Jebediah wasnt on the ship.  Not even back there with the men.  Abraham mustve stopped him somehow, pressured him to withdraw.  The Ordnungit was a hard kindness.  Meant to guide all toward salvation.  Away from darkness.   But it shouldnt mean this.   Sarah noticed Deacon James ahead of her.  He was seated to the right and about four or five people up.  How should she respond? What should she do? Deacon, she said.   Heads turned her direction.  Looks of concern.  She found that she was holding her stomach again.  How familiar that pose had become.  She had been nurtured from girlhood to be wifely and motherly.  But now it was authentic.  She was a creature of habit.  Predictable.   She called for the deacon again.  There were whispered messages.  Some appeared to be traveling in the right direction.  Deacon Jamess head turned slightly.  Talked to someone on his left.   The ship made a clanking sound.  Then it lurched upward.  The two crewmembers in front, the guard and tablet-lady, both clutched straps that hung from the ceiling.  Leaned back against the front wall.  They werent even talking anymore.   Where is my Jebediah! She first thought it, and then repeated it aloud.  Shrilly.   Everyone looked at her.   Jebediah is not on this ship! she cried.  He should be on this ship.   More discussion.  Words traveling in all directions.  There was no escaping the look of worry, though.  The uncertainty of everything.  It was like a wet towel being thrown over the head.  All perception was dampened.  Fogged over.   Sarah reached for the restraints at her waist.  Worked the funny latching mechanism.  Feeling the belt fall away, she started to get to her feet.   Elizabeth put a hand on her shoulder.  What are you doing, Sarah?  Sarah pushed the hand away.  Steadied herself, and then got the rest of the way up.  We need to stop, she said.  We need Jebediah.  She pointed at the Englisher woman.  You left my husband behind.   The woman seemed to shrink.  We were told not to interfere, she said.  To let you follow your own rules.   The ship lurched again and Sarah almost lost her footing.  She put out a hand to steady herself.  Deacon James! she yelled.  This is She rocked again.  We have left my husband.  She turned toward the back of the ship.  Saw Abraham cowering low.  Abraham Mast! You have done this.   She looked frontward again.  The guard was standing at attention now.  Holding his gun with both hands.   The young woman was talking into a small square device.  She pulled the device away from her mouth, and put out a hand.  You really need to sit down, miss.   Sarah.   Miss Sarah.   Sarah scowled, felt the floor move beneath her and crouched down.  Is the ship turning around? she asked.   He cant be with us, Sarah, Abraham said.  Hes not one of us now.  Its the rule.  He needs to repent.  Be brought back into fellowship.   How can he be brought back into fellowship if the fellowship leaves him behind? Did you think about that, Abraham Mast? Sarah pointed at the two crewmembers.  Theyre not part of us either.  But they are on the ship.   The young woman was talking into the rectangular device again.  The guard looked nervous.  Probably thought they were about to form a bonnet-and-black-hat mob.   Have you turned the ship around? Sarah asked  The young crewmembers eyes widened.  She kept talking into her device.  These people had a device for everything.  She was beginning to think the rectangle was no more than the young ladys pacifier.   She straightened her dress and grabbed her securing strap.  Well? she said.   The lady pulled the rectangle away from her mouth.  I think we have a solution.   Sarah could tell the woman meant it.  That somehow Jebediah would be rescued.  She nodded her head once.  Ya, gut, she said.  The Lord bless you.       13    Darly turned the corner toward Congis quarters.  With her was one of her newly converted medical interns, an older man named Dixon.  He was sweet but a bit of a slow walker.  He was strong enough to carry her small medcase, though, so that was something.   An emergency, Greels had said.  If there was anything Darly had learned during her time as a Guild medical officer, it was that all shipboard problems were emergencies.  It was a direct consequence of the results-oriented culture the Shipping Guild fostered.  She knew that, had documented it, and would someday write a book about it.  People rushed around, causing them to feel constant pressure on their head and shoulders.  Arteries constricted, neurons failed to function.  They made poor judgments.  Bodies got hurt.   More emergencies for her and her staff.   And the last thing they needed right now was another emergency.  Hundreds of people stepping from a grey age society onto their ship.  Most of her own people still couldnt find their way to an antacid tablet.  She shook her head, and without thinking, removed her med scanner from her hip and held it near her eyes.  She paused outside Congis door and waved the scanner down the hall to her left and then back toward Dixon on her right.   She had seen some strange medical cases brought on by environmental factors.  Loader decks were notorious breeding grounds for microscopic organisms.  Molds and fungi and what-have-you.  Greels had described something really bizarre, but sometimes loaders could over-see things, or over-describe them.   Another result of the pressure.  Another chapter for her book.   The scanner flashed some percentages at her.  Spore counts and air quality.  It was worse than she typically liked to see, but it wasnt bad enough to cause any issues.  She would check again when she got inside.   She turned to Dixon.  He smiled, and she pointed at her case.  He swung it forward in front of his chest and snapped it open.  She found a pack of individually-wrapped disinfection wipes.  She opened one and used it slowly and thoroughly on the control pad beside Congis door.  Even though she didnt intend to actually touch the pad, she didnt want to chance it being dirty beneath her hand.  What if she slipped? What if others did?  She put the wipe in the disposal canister in her med box, pressed the button to phase it, and gave Dixon another smile.  He closed the case and dropped it to his side.  She turned and fanned the control pad.  It made a chirping sound.  Two seconds passed.   Yes? Congi said through the pad speaker.   Darly frowned.  He sounded much better than hed been described.  Greels had exaggerated.  Not unusual.  I was told you were ill, she said.   Who said that?  The loading supervisor, she said.   A snort.  Figures.  Greelsnothing better to do, I guess.   She paused.  Greels may have exaggerated, but hed been upset over something.  Though hed appeared tired and stressed, he wasnt known for lying.  So youre not feeling sick at all? No breathing difficulties? No trance-like states?  Breathing difficulties? Trances? Did he tell you that?  Darly shifted her stance.  Brought her arms close to her body.  Felt the scanner at her hip.  Id rather not discuss it in the hall, crewmember.  May I come in?  A pause.  Are you alone?  Darly raised an eyebrow.  An odd question.  I have crewmember Dixon with me.   Another pause.  Dixon? From accounting? What happened to himwear out his desk from sleeping on it? Congi laughed and then quieted himself.  Sorry, that was rude.   Darly squinted, glanced at Dixon.   Dixon raised his shoulders.   Darly addressed the door again.  Can we come in?  Sure, one second.  Let me put something on.   She frowned at the idea of Congi being naked.  Even though it was occasionally part of her job, nakedness was something she never preferred.  They had perfectly good scanners for such things now.  No reason to remove ones clothes.  Please do.   More laughing.  An almost too happy laugh.  Darly had had few interactions with Congi, but hed never struck her as gleeful.  His last laugh was gleeful, though.   Or was she just being overly suspicious? Pulled along by Greelss description? Looking for anything odd?  The door slid partway open, stalled, and then quickly slid the rest of the way.  Darly frowned, peered into the door pocket.  She brought out her med scanner and waved it down the door frame.  Shook her head.   She turned and looked inside.  The cabinet doors were all closed to her right.  The door to the excretorium was closed, as well.  The floors were bare and cleannothing like Greels had described.  The lights were a little dim, but not extremely so.  Moody, perhaps.  Reserved.  She could just see the end of the bed past the excretorium.  It appeared to be made.  Bedding perfectly smoothed down.   The excretorium door opened and Congi stepped out, smiling.  His dark hair was slicked back, clearly just combed.  His shirt was regulation Guild wear.  Dark blue.  Neat and pressed.  His pants were on, thankfully, and equally pressed and per reg.  He could be ready for the accounting office himself.  He seemed slimmer somehow, taller.   She raised her med scanner.   Congi put out a hand.  You dont need that, Darly.  I can tell you how I am.  Im fine! Wonderful!  She eased the scanner down.  I just want to do a quick check.  Of your heart, lungs  Congi breathed in, smiled, blew his breath out again.   There was a scent of somethingalmost a floral bouquet.  Crushed roses, her subconscious told her.  Darly raised her eyebrows.  Shook her head.  You have nice breath, she said.   Why, thank you, Congi said.  It is natural.   I see.  A smile.  You should market whatever wash you use.   A tip of his head.  I use nothing.  Seriously.  Another smile, and a motion toward the interior of his quarters.  Would you like to see the place?  Darly nodded, smiled.  I would.  Congi took a few steps backward, allowing her access.   She walked in front of him, smiled again, and stepped into the room proper.  As she had glimpsed before, the bed was completely made.  Smooth.  As if it had never been touched.  There was nothingnothingon the floor or tables, aside from the mounted lights and standard accoutrements.  Odd, because shed heard that Congi was a bit of a packrat.   Satisfied? Congi asked.  I was sleeping.  Got cleaned up when you arrived.  He took another deep breath.  Feeling good.  Ready to go on the clock.   Darly felt suddenly ambivalent.  She knew there was something she should be doing.  Demanding, even.  But she felt no reason to do it.  Also, shed heard about some animosity between the loading supervisor and Congi.  This certainly wasnt part of a game, was it? Greels trying to badger a rival?  She didnt have time for games.   Shouldnt you check him out? Dixon said from behind her.   Darly scowled, turned.  What?  Dixons eyes widened.  He pointed halfheartedly toward her right hand.  The scanner.  You were going to check him out.   She looked at the scanner.  Right, I was.  She turned back toward Congi.  Smiled.   He returned the smile.  Wouldnt you rather give me a full examination? Sayat your medical office? Or your quarters?  Darly shouldve been offended by the implication.  But she found she wasnt.  What was it about this Congi, this maintenance man and rumored thief, that made him so appealing? She shook her head again.  So youre refusing a scan?  Congi straightened.  Smiled.  Im refusing nothing, young lady.  Ill allow you to do anything you would like.   This man is happier than I am, Darly thought.  Happier and probably healthier.  She glanced behind him at the room again.  And clearly cleaner.  I should  Congi raised both hands, as if leading them out.  You should, he said.  Im sorry for it, but you should go back to your work.  Ive heard you have lots of it.   She frowned.  I do, she said.  Lots of people.  Lots of work.  She found herself turning toward the door.   And you, Dixon, Congi said.  I can see youve found your place.  Your spot.  Miss Darly needs you.   Dixon looked puzzled, but he turned too.   In what seemed an instant, they both found themselves standing in the hall, pointed in the direction of the nearest slideway access.   Darlys heart felt hollow.  Longing to talk with Congi more.  To understand him.  His psychology, his intellect Well, it required investigation.  Of a purely medical sort, of course.   Both started walking, neither talking, until after many turns Dixon actually stepped on the back of Darlys shoe.   She winced, paused, adjusted the shoe, and shot Dixon a look.  Dixon!  Sorry, maam.  Dont know what happened.   She managed a nod.  Well, we need to get back to work.  Come on.           If I go up to the heavens, Jebediah thought, You are there.   In front of him was a wide expanse of gently curving transparency that provided almost 180 degrees of visibility.  The pilot sat directly behind that transparency, obstructing a small portion of the view.  But it was a singular seat.  Not much blockage.   Jebs rescue had been unexpected but wonderful.  A small carriageshuttlehad zoomed in from the south just as the larger one had taken Sarah away.  The pilot had told him to get on, that they had quarters for him on a larger vessel.  So Jeb had gotten on, and here he was.   Jeb was seated on a long bench along the back wall.  Strapped in.  It was one of the most comfortable chairs hed ever known.  Undoubtedly the result of forbidden technology, but it was wonderful.   And the view was incredible.  On Alabaster, the nights had always been a wonder to him, an inkling of heaven.  This experience made it seem like hed been looking through a fogged lens before though.  Everything was crisp and real.  A panorama of stars of all shapes and colors.   Then he saw a large mass of brightness on the edge of the starfield.  It was ball-shaped but not solid like the other stars.  There were dark spaces, making it clear it wasnt a single entity.  It was a structure composed of many individual lights.   What is that? he asked, pointing.   The pilot didnt turn.  To the right there? Thats the Palisade Nebula.  He made a circle with his hands.  It is a dense collection of stars.  Probably thousands of them.   Jeb nodded, continued to gape.  After a few seconds, he realized the overall shape of the Nebula was familiar.  It had greeted him nearly every morning of his life.  The Nebbit, he said.  The Morning Nebbit.   Nebbit? The pilot chuckled.  All right.  If you say so.   The craft made a wide turn to their left.  The planet Alabaster came into view.  It was another impossibility.  A brown and blue globe, now seemingly far enough away that he could hold it in his hand.  He hangs it on nothing, Jeb said, shaking his head.  How did He do it?  How did who do it? The pilot asked.   Der Herrthe Lord, Jeb gestured toward the planet.  He hung Alabaster on nothing.  Nothing holds it up.   The pilot glanced at the globe.  Shrugged.  I dont know how it works.  Something about gravitons.  A smile.  I dont have to know that to fly.  He pointed toward their right.  I just know the gravity of your sun keeps it where it is supposed to be.  And my instruments tell me where everything is supposed to be.  He glanced back at Jeb.  And we go from there.   Jeb looked toward the sun and then at the rows of gears and lights in front of the pilot.  It was a far cry from the tug of the reins and commanding voice he used to steer their buggy.  And what makes usthis, he motioned toward the floor, go?  The pilot chuckled.  Youre drifting into another area outside my expertise there, sir, he said.  I know it is a fusion-based engine, but I couldnt tell you what they are fusing.  I have some equipment on board that test and retest it as we fly.  There are also built-in routines to attend to any unexpected variations.  To keep us flying safely.  Plus, there are human mechanics that do routine safety inspections on the Raven and at HQ.  He shrugged.  Ive yet to have a problem.  It is all very routine.   Jebediah crossed his arms, looked out at the diminishing circle of Alabaster.  You dont know where we are.  You dont know how things out there move.  Dont know how this thing works.  Couldnt fix it if you had to.  He shook his head.  I hope you wont take offense, but what do you know?  The pilot laughed again, harder this time.  He checked the instruments in front of him, and then looked at the center of the transparent section.  Pointed.  Well, in this case, Mr.  Miller, I know the way home.   Jebediah noticed a place where the darkness of space was being obscured by something.  He leaned forward, and squinted.  It was rectangular, blue, and slightly-sloped.  He watched for many minutes as it grew larger and larger.  First it outgrew the pilots seat in perceived size, took nearly half the view, and then all of it.  In fact, only a small portion of the ship could be seen now, it was so big.   The pilot looked back at him, smiled.  What do you think of that?  Jeb shivered at the size of it.  Shook his head.  The largest barn hed ever helped construct could fit inside the ship a hundred times, maybe two hundred.   Well?  Jebediah could only gape.           Sarah couldnt wait for the ride to end.   Even with the assurance that Jeb was taken care of, that he was on his way as well in another vessel, she felt unsettled.  She had acted completely on her own too! She had allied herself with the Englishers over her own people.  Put her faith in them over Abraham and Deacon James.  Trusted in their mercy and generosity.  How unusual.  How wrong it must be.  But also right.  They wouldve left Jeb behind!  Finally she heard clanking noises, and the lighting in the room changed.  The two Englishersthe small woman with her talking device, and the security manunstrapped themselves and stood.  They scanned the room as if looking for any injured passengers, and after exchanging nods, the woman began talking into the device again.  A few moments later there were more heavy clanks, and the door behind them began to open.  There was more light, and a gentle breeze brought foreign smells into the vessel.  Unnatural smells.  A mixture of grease and lacquer and parchment.   Everyone can unstrap now, the Englisher woman said.  Stand up and stretch.  Turn toward the back.  Well take you to your settlement onboard.   Sarah could barely contain her agitation.  She freed herself, stood and turned with all the rest, but she wanted to push through to the back.  To make sure Jebediah was out there somewhere.  That she hadnt been deceived.   She noticed Abraham and his sons getting to their feet.  Abraham only glanced her direction before returning his eyes to the floor.  He then busied himself with making sure those around him were free and ready to go.   Ya, she thought grimly, hes a real helpful man.   Deacon James didnt even look her direction.  Was that because of his own shame? Or the shame shed brought onto herself for interfering? Her heart ached.  This situation.  Their lost homes.  Everything broken and asunder.   Those in front of her began to shuffle forward.  Heads looked up as they reached the opening.  Clearly the room beyond was large and held other Englisher shuttles.  She could see a portion of one shuttle behind them.  She thought she heard another touching down.  Where was Jebediah?  She finally exited the craft.  So many heads were in her way.  If only the men would remove their hats.  It was hard to take it all in.  To orient herself.  She saw a high dark blue ceiling with a crisscross of supports, a dark grey floor.  She counted more shuttlesat least ten.  There were groups of Amishers near each one.  Blue-suited Englishers leading them.  It was overwhelming.  More strange smells.  Everything foreign and wrong.  She fought her panic.  The child inside moved once in response.  No doubt sharing her distress.   The group thinned enough that she could move toward the side where the Englisher woman stood.  She was again talking on her device, but she acknowledged Sarahs approach.  Raised her eyebrows.   Where is my husband? Sarah asked.   One moment, the woman said to her device.  Im sorryyour husband? The woman recognized Sarahs expression of panic then and raised a calming hand.  Smiled.  Oh, right.  Sorry.  The outcast.  She nodded to her right.  He rode in an equipment shuttle.  A frown.  Not sure where they are now.  The device drifted near her mouth.  I can call someone.   I need to see him.  Where did he go? Where have you taken him?  Deacon James appeared at her side.  Laid a comforting hand on her elbow.  Youre always with family, Sarah.  Remember that.   She nodded.  I know that, Deacon.  But my service is to my husband, as well.   James nodded.  Scripture teaches that a believing wife can win over a lost spouse.  Your role is most important to his return.   Mrs.  Miller? A voice said.   Sarah turned to see the Englisher woman named Singer.  Though she wore no kapp or dress, she always seemed beautiful and modest.  A difficult feat for someone in such a manly leadership role.  Sarah felt certain she could trust her.   Singer pointed toward the side of the room, past a row of shuttles.  Jebediah is here, she said.  Waiting.  Weve made some special arrangements.  He wants you to join him.   Sarah tried to see past the shuttles.  To see him.  Her heart felt comfort, though.  Renewed strength at his presence.  He is here?  Singer smiled.  Yes, yes, hes here.  Safe and fine.   But hell not be with our group?  Singer shrugged.  I knew your uniqueum she glanced at Deacon James situation, so I took the liberty of finding you, finding him, separate quarters.  At least until you figure things out.   You should be with us, Sarah, Deacon James said.  You could always visit him.  The Bann doesnt separate man from wife.   Singer frowned.  Unfortunately, his quarters are on the opposite side of the ship.  It was the only place I could find.  Were pretty full now.   Sarah touched her midsection.  Felt disconcerted again.   I am unsure how to console you here.  Jamess eyes searched the room.  If I find Samuel or Mark  Sarah stepped so she could see around the nearest intervening shuttle.  She looked toward the rooms edge and saw a raised sectionan overlook of some sort.  Jebediah was bent over a metal railing there.  Looking her direction.  He raised a hand when he saw her.  Her heart swelled.  I need to be with my husband, she said.  It is the only way to win him, Deacon.  He will never come to it on his own.   James studied her for a moment.  Stroked his beard in thought.  I most wish for him to be with us again, Sarah.  I pray for it daily.   He is fearfully stubborn.  Like a mule at times.   James nodded.  You know what the Ordnung allows.  How you should behave?  Sarah nodded.  I do.  I will work to hasten his return to fellowship.   James nodded again.  I will inform the others.  May your efforts be fruitful.   Sarah looked Jebediahs direction again.  Tried to contain her smile.  They will be.       14    Greels was relieved when he heard the last ship had arrived.  It was madness, really, this idea of moving an entire group of reclusive people, a collection of farmers and sheep-huggers, in an interstellar delivery ship.  Ridiculous.  Way above his pay grade.  Way outside union rules.   There would doubtless be discussions at the next chapter meeting.  Complaints.  Undue stress from long hours and bad smells.  Some had even tried Tingle suits to shield themselves.  To no avail.   But now that the folks were all onboard, his work was nearly over.  He was the loading supervisor.  They had the ship loaded.  So his work was done.  He could get back to other tasks.  More important tasks.  In fact, if Captain Drake hadnt told him to meet him at the Bay 17 overlook, he would be onto his more important tasks already.  He needed some comfort.  Some beauty in his world of blue and grey.   Though he was on his way to Bay 17, Greels could gaze longingly down on Bay 16 from here.  He was on the blue slideway just before the changeover to the other side of the ship.  The lights in the bay below were dim, low level as they should be.  And her package wasnt easily viewablethankfullyfrom this perspective.  He still could pick out where her package was, though.  He didnt need a ceiling light pointed directly on it.  He could sense it, imagine the feel of the package wrapper.  The hissing sound it made when pried open.  The shine of the viewing window.   There was nothing wrong with noticing those things, was there? He was a details guy.  Part of the job.  He noticed things.   Greels frowned, stepped off at the changeover, and then rode the shorter green slide to the opposite side.  From there he entered the red slide.  Less than a minute later he was approaching the step off for the inspection overlook.  The slide slowed, he got off, and after a few short turns, he was in the overlook.  It was a narrow room, with railing on one side and a wall on the other.  There was only enough standing room for maybe three people.   The captain was already there.  He studied Greels a long moment before giving him a muted smile.  Youre late, loading supervisor.   Greels bowed his head, made a motion with a hand.  Ive been busy.  He pointed at the bay.  Well, you know.   The captains expression didnt change.  Ive been here almost an hour.  Didnt see you down there at all.   Greels almost sneered, but he contained himself.  If the captain only knew how tired he was.  How out of it.  Im loading supervisor of the whole ship.  And of this entire pickup.  This crazy, unrepresented pickup.  He gazed down at the bay.  There were hundreds of black-suited farmers down there now.  Isolationists.  Moralists.  And their wivesdaughtersall in their bland dresses and bonnets.  Hiding out.  Hiding their distinctness.  Their indiscretions.   You mean unprecedented, I think, Seal said.  And it is that.  He frowned, looked down at the bay.  It appears your team is ready, though.  Ill give you that.  A nod.  Good work.   Dang straight, good work.  Greels nodded.  Thank you, sir.  We try.   I want your team to stay loose, though, Seal said.  Ive been looking at the ledgers.  Some of the variables are hard to factor.  Not sure what will be required in the way of general supplies.  Plus, theres the medical staff  Greels got a flash image of Congis room.  Of the mess, and those eyes.  Staring.  Just watching without watching.  And the smells.  The feeling that something wasnt right.  He wondered what that Darly woman had found.  Had he warned her enough? That man was sick! Yeah, the medical staff.  We cant really help with that, Captain.  Union rules.   Seal shook his head.  Theres a clause that says emergency allocation.  It is in everyones contract.   Greels sniffed.  These people arent an emergency.  Just a bunch of  Who defines an emergency?  I dont know Id have to check my manuals.   Let me save you the effort.   Greels raised his hands.  Fine.  Im assuming you do.  Remember, we have days of travel yet.  And a ship full of packages to unload.   Seal straightened.  Squinted.  Are you threatening me, Loading Supervisor?  Greels felt a wave of fatigue and reached out to grip the forward rail.  No, Captain, Im not.  Just trying to keep the peace.  He pushed a smile.  Everyone in loading isnt as agreeable as me.   Seal chuckled.  I suppose they arent.  He smoothed the chest of his regulation captains coat.  Crossed his arms.  Ill try to keep requests as standard as possible, but I want you to know where were at.  As you said, this is unprecedented.   Greels nodded.  Stared at the bay again.  He tried not to think of that other bay.  Of the woman they kept on ice.  While these people filled an entire bay.   Greels surveyed the temporary dividers his crew had constructed.  The hygienic facilities.  Probably better than what the Amish had had on the planet theyd left, and certainly better than what theyd have on the planet they were going to.  He shook his head again and started to pick out the non-Amish on the floor.  A couple of his best men and women were down there, all easily recognizable because of the dress codes on both sides.   Black and blue.  Who wouldve thought?  Youve been hard to reach, Seal said.   Greels noticed something else on the floor.  Someone else.  Uh-huh, he said.  Like I mentioned before.  Been busy.  Real busy.   I gathered.  Regardless, I wanted to know if you had anything for me.  Any processes I might put in place? Any files you need moved along? Anything to make things easier?  Greels watched the person circle the periphery of the bay.  He seemed smaller, thinner, but there was no mistaking the swagger.  Some people just had a distinctive walk, and hed seen this one enough to know.  Except it couldnt be.  No way was it possible.   Anything?  Greels looked at the captain, tried to hide his feelings.  No, nothing  He couldnt keep his eyes away.  He had to check again.  It was a fair distance and the persons face was difficult to see.  He kept walking perpendicular to Greelss line of sight.  Or behind someone.  Then finally, the person turned around and looked straight toward the overlook.  Smiled.   Greels shook his head.  Congi.  No way.   The maintenance guy? The captain leaned over the rail, looked down.  Yeah, I see him.  Looks like hes slimmed down.   Slimmed down? He shouldnt even be here.   This isnt his assigned area?  No, it is his assigned area.  I That guy is sick!  Maybe he got over it?  Greels pushed away from the railing.  Not what I saw.  Not like that.  He needed to talk to Darly.  See what had happened.  What shed done.  Listen, I need to check on something.  Do you need me here?  Seal looked puzzled.  NoI guess not.   Greels nodded, made for the door.  Good.           Greels stormed into the medical office.   The first person he encountered was a nurse seated at a small white desk.  She might have been sixty years of age, though she appeared younger.  Her hair was red and it was woven tightly around her head.  She wore the standard Guild nurses gear: a lighter blue shirt and pants.  A small Guild bird emblem was present on the right side of her shirt, while the universal wings and snake-crossing symbol was on the left above her name tag, which read Nora.   To the left of the desk and through a door, Greels knew, were the examination rooms.  To the right was a small waiting room.  Already a few Amish were seated there: a man, two women, and a young child.  All heads were covered.   Greels scowled.   Can I help you? Nora asked.   The entire medical facility was small.  Tiny, when compared to the size of the larger storage bays.  But it was functional enough.  Rarely any backlog.  Especially during the travel portions of the delivery cycle.   But with the Amish here Im looking for Darly, Greels said.   Nora placed her hands flat on the desk.  Shes with a patient right now.  If you want to have a seat  Greels shook his head.  Im the loading supervisor.  I need to talk with her right away.  He noticed Nora had a chart of some kind displayed on her desk.  Probably a medical report on one of the Amish.  The chart looked plenty full.  Lots of preventable conditions, he guessed.   The screenings are private, sir.  A hand swipe banished the chart from her desk.  It was replaced by a large white medical symbol.   I understand that.  He glanced in the direction of the waiting area.  All eyes were on him.  Judgmental.  I need to speak to her for only a minute.  It is important.   The nurse shifted in her seat.  Im not supposed to leave this desk.  It is against  Greels ran a hand through his hair.  Felt his temperature rise.  Just go get her, Nora.  Im sure the Amish wont steal your desk while youre gone.   But  Greels scowled.  Did I mention Im the loading supervisor? You have packages on this ship? Belongings you want moved?  She did a little hop, lowered her eyebrows, but finally rose from her seat.  Ill tell her you threatened me.   He sniffed.  Tell her whatever you want.   Nora hurried into the examination area.  Closed the door behind her.  Greels was left, feeling agitated, with only the Amish for company.  He tried to avoid looking at them, studying instead the live areas of the walls that showed artwork.  There was one such area behind the desk.  It had the picture of a smiling doctorsignified by a white coatscanning a seated patient in a green robe.  The patient was smiling too.   Not very realistic.   The wall in the waiting area was on a three-image cycle.  One picture featured a sunset on a planet with lots of forests and a sky that was predominately purple.  The next showed city lights at night, probably in one of the near-Earth colonies.  The last was a close-up of a blend beast: Part tiger, part camel.  A made-to-order predator for a desert planet.  A splicer plaything.   The young Amish girl watched that picture with wide eyes.  Whispered to her mother.  Her mother just shook her head.   Its called a blend, Greels said aloud.  Never seen one before?  The mother and daughter turned to look at him, eyes wide.  They said nothing, though.   Greels just shook his head.   The door to the examination rooms opened.  The nurse and Darly came out, both looking annoyed.  Greels didnt care how they felt.  They both annoyed him, and nobody cared about that.   Im with a real patient, Mr.  Greels, Darly said.  What do you want?  I want to know what happened, he said.  What you did.   Darly pursed her lips.  Frowned.  What I did when?  Was she dense? At Congis! he said.  You know what I mean! He was  Darly shushed him, glanced at the waiting area, and shot him a look.  She then directed him back closer to the entrance.  We dont discuss patients conditions in public, she said in a lowered voice.  Whether they are real or imagined.   Imagined? Greels tried to lower his voice, as well, but it was difficult.  I didnt imagine what I saw.  That guy was He raised his hands.  Did you see his eyes?  Of course I saw his eyes, Mr.  Greels.   And the mess in that place, you had to see that.   Darly shook her head.  I saw no mess whatsoever.   No mess.  Where did  Darly held up a hand.  Mr.  Congi appeared fine.  He was clean, in fact.  Said he was getting ready for work.  She forced a smile.  I thought youd be happy with that.   Happy? A scowl.  I know hes at work.  I just saw him.  I cant believe I saw him.   Darly brought a hand to her hip and took out her med scanner.  Held it up to his chest.  Stared at the screen.   Greels took a step back.  What are you doing, woman?  Darly raised an eyebrow.  Woman?  He frowned.  Yeah, yeah, I mean doctor.  He indicated the scanner.  I think you should be using that thing on yourself if you didnt see what I saw.  I didnt hallucinate.  Im not crazy.   Darly squinted at her scanner.  It is too soon to tell on that.  However, you are showing signs of severe stress.  Her eyes moved rapidly as she read.  Fatigue, dehydrationsomething else.  Iron deficiency, perhaps? She looked at him.  Probably we should get you into one of the examination rooms.  Check you all over.  A glance at the waiting room.  If there werent people waiting, Id  Check me over? Greels was heating up again.  Ridiculous.  What was happening here? How had the doctor missed everything? Had she gone to the wrong room? How had Congi even gotten up, let alone gotten cleaned up? And how had he fooled her so completely? It didnt make sense.   Greels thought for a moment, then smiled, snapped his fingers.  Wait a minutedid he offer you something? Congi? Something to turn this around on me?  The nurse was back at her desk, head bowed over another chart.  Or perhaps a magazine.   Darly drew rigid, crossing her arms.  What are you suggesting?  Im not suggesting anything.  I just know how things work on Guild ships.  How some things get by.   Youre saying he bribed me? That he gave me something for a clean bill of health? How absurd! On the last, Darly raised her voice enough that it got the attention of those in the waiting room.  The Amish man smoothed his beard.  The rest raised large eyes.   All Im saying is that there is something wrong here.  Something really, really wrong.  Congi is sick.  Shouldnt be out.  Dont know why you didnt see it.  He raised his hands.  You know what? I really dont care.   Darly didnt look moved.  She put her scanner back on her hip.  Im going to give you an order, loading supervisor.  Im going to tell you to go back to your quarters and lie down.  Im not sure what your shift is  Almost over, he said.  Then I have  Good.  Then I want you to go get some sleep.  If you want me to give you an injection of something to help  You want to drug me? Just for being concerned about  Go home, Mr.  Greels.  Get some rest.  Uncharacteristically, she laid a hand on his shoulder.  Put pressure on it to turn him toward the door.   I dont want to, he said.  I have other things to do.   They will wait.  Im going to have security check your place in an hour.  You better be there.   Seconds later, Greels found himself outside the medical door, angry, confused and, as the doctor had said, more than a little tired.  He scowled, contemplated opening the door again, but finally resigned himself to doing what shed suggested.   But this wasnt the end of it.           The Englisher woman named Singer led Jebediah and Sarah through a ship so strange that he felt he was at a fall fair.  Each turn revealed a new marvel, a new item Jebediah wanted to ask about.  And most of the time, he did.   What is that circle there?  That device, what does it do?  How does that turn like that?  Why do you call that a field? It has no dirt and no crops.  Only a glow.   Where does the water come from?  The most perplexing curiosities to him were what Singer called slideways.  They were paths that moved.  So instead of walking, you rode.  Seemed counterintuitive, slothful even, but he foundhe and Sarah both foundthem simply incredible.   It is as if the ship moves around us while we stand still! Sarah said as they traveled one of the wider slideways, the one called simply blue.   The Englisher laughed.  Thats very similar to how the whole ship moves, she said.  Through space.  Space moves around us.  The engines create a field, ahem, an area, for us and moves space around that area.  If you could look outside when were in slip travel She tipped her head.  Well, it would look like an extremely foggy day.   Sarah put her hand over chest.  Took a deep breath.  Searched the ceiling overhead.  And the Lord allows such a thing? Pulling space over us like a blanket? Immersing us in this fog? She turned to him.  How is it possible?  Jeb shook his head.  Like Babel, Sarah.  Anything they can imagine.   But should they? The Ordnung  Jeb held up a hand.  We are in their world now, Sarah.  He noticed a heavily-lit area ahead.  Here were the Englishers.   Sarahs eyes dropped.  She turned to the right, looked over the storage area below.  Well, imagine that.  Us.  Englishers.   Again Singer chuckled.  She indicated the lighted area ahead.  Careful.  Well be stepping off at this stop.  The slideway seemed to slow somehowa trick that baffled Jebediah, since the slide appeared to be solid underneath his feet.  About that magic, however, he didnt ask.  He waited for Singer to step off and then he put a hand on Sarahs elbow and stepped with her onto the landing platform.   Oh, my, Sarah said as they again stood on solid ground.   Youre all right? he asked.   Her hand found her midsection.  Yes, Im fine.  A smile.  Nice to be stopped again.  She looked at Singer.  Though I guess were not really stopped, are we?  Singer just smiled and indicated a doorway with her hand.  This way.   They passed through a short walkway and took a number of turns before arriving at a hall with a series of doors on both sides.  Each door had a lit square to its left.  Singer brought them to the third door and waved her hand in front of its square.  The door slid open, and she motioned for Jebediah and Sarah to enter.   The interior was clearly a living space.  Jeb could see the tail end of a bed ahead.  Every surface had a blue-green tint to it.  At first glance, it almost seemed too pressed, too perfectand too small in a ship so largeto be someones home.  Of course, the whole ship was home for these Englishers.  Singer had mentioned that most rarely left it, even at stops.  Jeb smoothed his beard.  So these were the quarters Singer had said she was bringing them to.   Sarah paused at the door.  What is this?  The room we allocated the two of you, Singer said.   Sarah frowned.  But our people are  Singer nodded, smiled.  Yes, they are back at one of our bays, along with the animals.  But I knew your husband was An uncomfortable frown.  Well, I knew he wasnt to be with them.   Sarah frowned.  He is in the Bann, Miss Singer.  Shunned.  There is no harm in saying it.   Another nod.  Yes, maam.  Very good.  A nervous look into the room.  So I thought this might work better for you both.   Sarah walked slowly inside.  Jeb tipped his hat at Singer as he entered.  Smiled.  He noticed cabinetry on the left side of the entranceway.  It appeared flimsy in construction, but when Jeb tried one of the doorsopened it and gave it a tughe realized it was another enigma.  Much stronger than it looked, yet light and thin.  Not made of wood, certainly.   Plus the hinges were completely hidden.  Fused to the door somehow.  Doubtless the community carpenter would like to see that.  Probably lose the rest of his hair trying to figure it out.   Singers voice lifted.  And you helped us, she said.  Helped us keep to our schedule.  She followed Jeb inside.  The captain is pleased with that.   There was another opening to their right.  Sarah immediately turned into it, and a light snapped on by itself.  The room was all shine.  There was a sink and something Jeb guessed was an indoor outhouse.  There was also a transparent rectangular area at the far end.  A bath of some sort? Sarah took it in with wide eyes.   Hes a man of structure, your captain? Jeb said.  A man committed to time?  Singer nodded.  You could say that.   They gathered together in the area near the bed.  The bed itself had a shiny blue bedspread.  There was an emblem on it, along with the letters S and G.   Hmm Jeb said, studying the bed.  The initials of the last tenant?  Singer chuckled.  No, it stands for Shipping Guild.  All the beds come with that spread.   Not very homey, Sarah said.   Singer indicated the cabinets.  There are different coverlets in the storage units there.  Those might be more to your liking.  Or maybe we could get some articles out of your personal parcels.  She shrugged.  I mean, theyre all marked.  Stored nearby.  We can certainly locate them.  She looked at Jeb.  Theyd have to be resealed, of course.  But we do that all the time.   Jeb touched Sarahs arm.  One of your favorite quilts?  Sarah looked hard at the bed, clearly thinking.  Are you letting others unpack? The rest of the settlement?  We hope not to.  It adds to our reported loading hours.  Our union bills.   Union? Jeb asked.  Union of what?  Singer smoothed the side of her head.  Smiled.  Yes, you wouldnt have those, would you? A sigh.  It is hard to explain.   There were two large chairs and a table on the other side of the bed, plus what looked to be a large darkened window.  Jeb drifted that direction and examined the nearest chair.  It was odd-shaped, somewhat triangular.  The supporting structures were cut at almost impossible angles.  Yet the cushion appeared comfortable.  He decided to put his faith in it and sat down.   Perhaps if we had a book, he said.  To help explain.   Singers eyes lit up.  Sure! Theres a whole library available on that surface there.  She motioned to the nearby table.  The completely empty table.   Jeb squinted at the table, and then at Singer.   She smiled, blushed.  Umyes, if you just lay a hand on it for a few moments.  She stepped closer and did so.  After a few seconds the table seemed to open up.  There was a dark void filled with lots of shapes.  Little pictures rotating in three dimensions.   Jeb gasped.  I feel ill.  He tentatively touched the edge of the void.  It was still a table.  Still flat.  But it responded.  Like molding clay under his fingers.  And the shapes moved.  Theres a way to read this? he asked.  Is it really small?  Sarah brought a hand to her head.  This is too much, Jebediah.   He made a calming motion.  Well be all right, Sarah.   A light flashed at Singers hip.  She detached the square device that hung thereher communication device, Jeb knewand brought it up to her face.  Frowned.  Im sorry, she said.  I have things I need to attend to.  She scanned both their faces.  Can I leave you here? Will you be all right?  Sarah held her arms close and gingerly sat on the bed.  She looked to both sides of her.  Well, this isnt too bad.  More comfortable than I expected.   And fully adjustable.  Singer said.   Sarahs eyes widened.  Oh, please dont adjust anything.   Singer held up a hand.  Certainly.  No problem.  She took a step toward the door.  Again, will you be all right? Her eyes searched the room, the wall cabinetry, the interior of the bathroom.  You cant really hurt anything here.  It is all pretty idiot-proof.   Idiot? Sarah said.  Are we idiots here?  Now, Sarah  Singer took another step back.  Looked more embarrassed.  I didnt mean that.  Really.  I mean, you cant hurt yourself either.  Its a term we use in engineering to mean She put out her hands.  Relax.  Explore, if you want.  Youll be all right.  She moved to the door.  Okay?  Jeb nodded slowly.  Yes.   But Jeb  He held up a hand.  Let her leave, Sarah.  She has work.  Then to Singer.  Well be fine.   Singer gave a short nod and a wave, then passed through the door.  The door closed.   Sarah looked at him.  Jebediah?  He turned to the table again.  I think I can do something here.  Find a manual for the outhouse or something.  He squinted, searched the whole surface.  Do you suppose Im to touch it? Or talk to it?  Still seated on the bed, Sarah chuckled.  Oh, you silly man.   Jeb smiled.  Raised his shoulders.  I really dont know.   She laughed again.  Then paused.  We are out of our element here, Jeb.  We should be with the others.   He returned to the table.  Hmmyesdoubtless.   So what are you going to do?  He shrugged.  Im not sure.  Right now, Im afraid to even move.   Again, she laughed.   And for now, Jeb thought that was okay.       15    Seal was back in his office and feeling good.  Content.  Things appeared to be progressing well.  Efficiently.  He took that as a sign that he was doing what he was supposed to be doing.  Being the best captain he could be.   In his mind, he imagined the ledger on the admirals desk back in HQ.  He saw images of the Guild fleet captains all positioned in stack rank orderin order of perceived importance.  A nice neat and efficient assortment.  Everyone with smiling faces and Guild dress blues on.  The captain of the Eagle was doubtless in the number one spot.  He always was.   Seal envisioned the admiral selecting Seals own image from somewhere in the middle of the group and sliding it slowly forward.  Forward and up.  Hiding the images of other captains behind his.  Those smiling captain images.  Finally putting Seal in the fifth, maybe fourth, stack-rank position.  Seal sighed.  Smiled to himself.  It was a nice dream.   He leaned over his desk and began searching for the Intradesk Meeting indicator.  He found it right where hed left it after the last meetingall curled up in the bottom right-hand side of the screen.  He pressed it, and when squares began to appear, he filled them with references from the ships crew ledger: Singer, Greels, Darly and that pilotwhat was his name? Ah, yes, Perth!  Forgetting the name of his own pilot? Whew.  Better not let that continue.   Just for that, he gave the pilots image top left status again.  Then Singer was on the top right, and Darly got bottom left.  Hard-to-find Greels? Bottom right.   Perfect.   The images flicked, swirled, and became solid as each person answered.  Greels was last, of course.  Even though his location showed that he was in his quarters, he had taken a long time to respond.  He also looked angry.   Thank you for joining me, Seal said.  I know this is a busy time.  An unusual time.  He looked Singers direction.  Our status, crewmember?  Singers hair was down, mildly curled.  Another good look on her.  Did she even have a bad one?  Singer smiled.  All are aboard, sir.   Youre certain?  We cant afford to wait much longer, Perth said.  Ive pulled the ship back out of the projected expansion range, but I feel uncomfortable even here.  That star is dangerous.   The end is soon, then.   Perth frowned.  Pilots instinct.   Seal nodded.  So is everyone comfortable for a pull-away then? A return to the slip? He searched for the ship schedule, found it hanging near the top portion of the desk.  He pulled it into view, over Perths head.  The estimated time to Obelisk now is  Nine days and six hours, Seal, Perth said.   And hows that look for our schedule?  Brings us in right on time.  Just a few hours to spare.   Seal breathed out slowly.  Thats closer than Id like, obviously.  He thought of the admirals stack ranking again.  Straightened in his seat.  Any reason not to leave immediately? Anyone?  All shook their heads.  Seal couldnt miss the look of displeasure on Greelss face, though.  Greels? he said.  Your people ready to go?  Greels made a retching sound.  In more ways than one, sir.   And why do you say that?  Greels shook his head.  Never mind.  The issues are mostly personal His eyes shifted to his left.  Aint that right, darling?  Darly bristled.  Mr.  Greels, your confinement is for your own good.   Confinement?  Greels shrugged.  If you say so.   Seals eyes flitted between bottom left and right.  I sense tension, he said.  Tension leads to inefficiencies.   Greels smiled.  Nothing we cant work out.   Seal frowned, checked the images of the other two participants.  Perth was frowning, not wanting to get distracted.  Singer was just standing by.  Looking attentive.  Ready to assist.  I wont ask what this is about right now, Seal said.   Just visit me in my quarters, Greels said.  Ill tell you what it is about.  A smile.  Or maybe Darly can visit you.   Mister Greels, Darly said.   Okay, now Im going to have to inquire.  Seal touched the image of Perth and Singer, effectively freezing them in place.  They would see only a screen showing his face and the words Please stand by.  He didnt like to be so abrupt, but sometimes it was necessary.  What is this about? he asked.   Darly stared straight at him.  Mr.  Greels sent me on a blind chase.  Involved me in one of his personal games.  And I have work to do.  A roomful of patients to treat.   Is that true? Seal asked Greels.   If she says so, Greels said.  Fine.   Seal grimaced.  Greels.  We dont have time for pettiness.  What is going on?  He is on the verge of exhaustion, Darly said.  He needs time to rest.  To come to his right mind.   Greelss eyes did look sunken.  Tired.  Hed appeared that way for a while now, though.  Seal credited that to actual work being done.  But maybe there was something more.  Seal didnt want to have to mess with it, though.  Greels had always been reliable.  There were already enough variables.   Greels shook his head.  This is what I get for trying to look out for someone else.  He scowled.  And a cleaner, to boot.   Seal raised a hand.  Are you both ready to leave this system?  Both paused, then Greels said, Absolutely!  Darly just nodded.  Any time.   All I need to know.  He put their images to sleep, brought the other two to life.  Perth was resting his head on a finger, lookingit appearedat his lap.  He looked up again.  Captain?  Get us back en route, he said.  Back on schedule.   Perth nodded.  Right away, sir.   Seal nodded and closed the pilots image.  He looked at Singer.  As for you A smile.  Thank you for all youve done.  Youve been a great help.   Singer blushed, lowered her eyes.  Youre welcome, Seal.  Anytime I can be of assistance.   Seal nodded.  There will be other opportunities.  Especially the way it is going.   Seal?  He shook his head.  Never mind.  You did well.  A nod.  I appreciate it, both as your captain and, I hope, your friend.   Singer raised her eyebrows.  Of course, sir.  On both.   He nodded.  Very good.  Now I have a dispute to mediate.  You really dont want my job, do you?  Seal?  He sighed.  Well talk later.   Singer nodded.  I hope so.   Seal closed her image, hesitated before bringing the others live.  He thought about the admirals stack rank again.  Shook his head.  Touched both images.  Now, where were we?          Soundlessly the Raven moved again into slip space.  The planet Alabaster, its sun, and all the objects that circled that dying star disappeared, replaced by a solid grey fog.   Patrolling the perimeter of Bay 17, Congi noticed the delicate change in stellar motion, the subtle drop from normal space into slip space.  At first he felt a twinge of primal fear, but then, when intelligence asserted itself, when higher order brain functions informed, he smiled.  Bit his lower lip.  The ship would be alone for almost two weeks now.  It would pass through systems empty of life.  A graveyard of stars.   Congi had his maintenance cart with him.  It hovered to his right, and one hand rested on it.  The cart was merely a prop, though.  A necessary accessory to his role.   Bay 17 was in nighttime mode, the lights on their lowest setting.  The bays lighting schedule had been adjusted to fit that of the majority of the newcomers.  Nighttime began an hour ago, and it would last another six, as the elders had arranged.  Most of the communitys usual chores were no longer required, of course.  But there were some, animal-related, that still had to be done before daybreak.  The milking, for instance.   That gave Congi limited time for what he intended to do, but it was enough.   From where he stood he could see the section that had been partitioned into animal pens.  Directly ahead, after a short row of sealed parcelsAmish belongingswas a pen of sheep.  All were lying together near the starboard end.  Next to that was a pen of goats.  These were at rest, as well, though occasionally one bleated aloud.  Or looked around nervously.   Everyone was nervous tonight, Congi knew.  So much had changed for them.   And for him.   He was hungry.  It didnt show, but he was always hungry.  Hed tried items from the cafeteria, raided the vending units, but none of it pleased him.  Nothing satisfied.  It was as if he were unable to metabolize human foods anymore.  As if he were eating stones.  And even the little he was able to ingest was insufficient.  There was too much need.  Plus, none of it tasted right.   Congi knew he wasnt himself, but whatever he now was, he liked.  It was what he should be.  He felt stronger, more confident.  More significant.  He was a finder always, but now he would find only what was most important: sustenance.   He drew a synthetic duster from his cart.  Swished it around the top of the nearest parcel, made his way slowly toward the end of the row.  He glanced across the row of pens, toward the square habitations on the opposite side of the bay.  It was very dark, with little motion whatsoever.  There wasnt even a guard posted.  Hed heard that was part of the Amish disposition.  Trust in their fellow man, reflecting their trust in a higher power.  Protection that came from above.   He wondered what the Amish thought of the heavens now that theyd truly seen them.  How very dark it all was.  How empty.  How chaotic and unpredictable.  Part of him used to blanch at such things.  Chaos.  The loss of control.  But now he found himself embracing them.  Running to them.  All parts working together.   He checked the shelters again.  Saw nothing.  Still dusting, he moved his cart slowly to the end of the parcels, and then around to the other side.  He was closer to the animal pens and to the Amish themselves.  His view of their area was obstructed in places by the small-scale force fields that held the larger animals.  The fields stood out like shimmering areas of uncertainty.  Blurred areas.   So much like life.   Just beyond the sheep a large bull was so enclosed.  It rested on its feet.  Head bowed, but occasionally a heavy snort of anger could be heard.  A reaction to a dream predator, perhaps? Or an imagined bovine rival?  Congi shook his head.  He knew little about animals.  Such traditional stock was rarely seen anymore.  Everything was engineered and manipulated.  That didnt matter, though.  The animal itself intrigued him.  He wondered how it would taste? All of it.  He began to salivate.   That was not for now.  Most important for now, was that the animal wasnt looking Congis way.   He knew every spot in the bay where peopleor camerascould be watching, of course.  This particular spot was best.  The pens directly ahead.  Plus he had his cart to crouch behind, if necessary.  He pushed it in front of him.  Slid the duster inside and then partially shielded himself as he slowly moved ahead.  He reached the plastinium fence the loaders had constructed.  There was a narrow gate in this section.  He searched the area again, saw no one watching, and released the mechanical latch.  Swung the door open.  It was silent on its hinges.   He had no experience with this, but somehow he knew he could do it.  Directly ahead were the sleeping sheep.  There was no ram in this pen, thankfully.  Nothing with a sense of purpose, of responsibility.  There were just the white, fluffy animals.  They werent even huddled together.  They lay meters apart from each other.  Hed been watching the pen for some time.  Had his eyes on one animal in particular.  A female.  It stood a bit shorter than the rest and had a discernible limp when walking.  Black ears and face, but otherwise white.  He approached it, looked around, and then crouched over its midsection.  The animals head and neck were stretched out on the ground, facing away from Congi.  Perfect.  He knew right where to strike.  The map of the body was visible.  Where the warm spots were.   He felt a rush of hunger.   Not here! Congis intellect warned.  Too exposed! Too dangerous!  But I want it, hunger responded.  We need it to survive.   Suddenly, he was soaked in sweat.  We need to plan.  Plan and survive.   He heard a noise, a heavy snort.  He turned to his right to see the shielded bull staring in his direction.  Curious.  Noticed him, somehow.   Congi shook his head.  He felt the chill of his body, still perspiring.  He put his arms around the ewe and hefted it, standing upright.  It awoke but made no sound.  Still dazed.  He pulled it close and bolted for the gate.  He was surprised at how light the animal was.   Strong, he was strong now.   The animal made a single bleat before Congi brought a hand over its mouth.  That stifled a second bleat as he reached the gate and swung it closed.  He lifted the edge of his cart, placed it in the shallow pan on top.  He pushed the cart and animal quickly away.   He would eat.  He would survive.  He would plan.           THREE DAYS LATER    Samuel was a tired man.  A worried man.  He knew his feelings werent appropriate.  Werent justified.  The Lord had a plan in all this.  Obviously He did.  He always did.  But Samuel knew there was much danger here.  Even with the community together in one place, it was vulnerable.  Surrounded like sheep in the wilderness.   Samuel was seated in one of the two chairs in the shelter the Englishers had given him.  It was a stiff blue chair, made out of an unusual material.  But it was functional.  Sturdy enough.  He sat with both feet firmly on the floor.  And he thought.   The shelter itself seemed foreign.  It was just three walls and a sliding curtain on one sidenow partly open.  There was an air-filled mattress in one corner, the two chairs, a small desk with just enough room to spread his Bible and a piece of paper on.  A desk that also doubled as the dinner table.  Otherwise it was an empty shell.  Just like Samuel often felt now.  Empty and tired.   Typically, his wife Ruth shared the space with him, but todaytheir fourth inside the leviathanshe was busy with some of the other wives.  Robbed of their usual chores, the most difficult task so far had been keeping everyone busy.  Keeping idle hands from forming into sinful hands.  So some of the women had reinstated school for the children.  Kept both women and children busy.  It wasnt a bad solution.   Some of the men helped with that too.  Helping to teach the survival skills they would need for their new world.  It was all based on assumptions, of course.  None of them had lived long enough to remember the original taming of Alabaster, so none of them knew what to expect.  All they had were the promises of these Englishers that the world would be ready.   What were their assurances, really? Just words.   Samuel grunted.  It was difficult being a leader.  It weighed on him.  Perhaps it was time to move on with life.  To ask that they appoint someone else? Mark was able.  James  Samuel noticed a shadow moving outside the curtain.  It started at one end of their room and moved toward the curtain opening.  Then Deacon Marks face appeared at the doorway.  He removed his hat, brought it to his chest.  Brother Samuel?  Samuel nodded.  Ya, what is it?  Marks eyes showed sympathy.  How are you feeling?  I am fine.  Strong for the day.  Why do you ask?  A smile.  I know you havent been resting well, he said.  Ruth told me.   Samuel sniffed.  That woman.  A wave.  Never you mind her.  I am fit for what the Lord brings my way.  He forced a smile.  Not what are you bringing me?  Mark stepped into the room.  We seem to have a, um, problem with the animals.   Samuel nodded slowly.  I expected as much, he said.  These surroundings are so foreign.  The routine.  We brought the heartiest of stock.  I hoped theyd survive the trip.  He looked at the floor.  Becca had spread a small throw rug over the otherwise black surface.  There are many unknown elements, though.  He grimaced.  And these Englishers, they dont know anything.   Mark shook his head.  The livestock appear to be generally healthy, Samuel.  Thats not the problem.   No? Are the hens no longer laying? Because that is to be expected, as well.  The roostershow can we expect them to perform?  Mark placed his hat back on his head.  Nee, that isnt it either.  Some of the stock have apparently gone missing.   Samuel straightened in his chair.  Missing? They had checked the pens thoroughly upon arrival, and they had appeared solid.  The pens had been constructed by Englishers, though.  Englishers who never had to pen anything living in their life.  Theres a break in the fence somewhere then.  He wagged a finger.  Or is it those force pens they used? I dont know how they could stay solid.  A head shake.  Price we pay for conforming.  For breaking our rules.   Mark frowned.  Perhaps you should just talk with the men themselves.  Get the story straight from them.   Samuel nodded.  Got to his feet.  Well get to the bottom of it together, wont we?  They made their way through the labyrinth of portable dwellings, occasionally being stopped by an elderly member, or someone asking a question.  Many of a spiritual nature.  There was a certain usefulness to their makeshift settlement here, Samuel realized.  A convenience, a closeness, that went unrealized when everyone lived so far apart.  The Lord worked in the unlikeliest of circumstances.  Samuel smiled at that.   They turned a corner to find one woman shaking a metal pan at another woman.  Both were red in the face.  The Yoder schwestern, Mark whispered.   Ach, ya, Samuel said.  The two sistersboth married with childrenhad a hard time being amiable at three miles distance.  Unfortunately they were near neighbors now.   There are disadvantages too, it appears, Samuel muttered.   Whats that? Mark asked, to which Samuel just shook his head.   The sisters quieted as the men approached.  The metal pan relaxed, lowered.  Both smiled.  Bishop, they said, nearly in unison.   Young ladies, Samuel said.  How are you getting on?  Well, Bishop Samuel, the pot-less sister said.  Getting on for dinner.   Samuel smiled, gave a slow nod.  Very good.  The finest charity.  Continue.  They walked past the women and Samuel wondered if hed hear the tension return behind them.  He was comforted when he did not.   He and Mark reached the outside of the settlement.  Then they had only a bit of a walka distance adequate to keep the smell awayto the start of the animal pens.  The nearest pen contained a half dozen calves.  Playful things, they approached the fence as soon as they caught sight of the men.   Samuel held a hand over the fence.  The lead animal drew near, smelled his hand, and gave it a slow lick.  Samuel smiled.  Typical behavior.  Bovines loved salt, even the small measures found in human skin.  Plus, they were probably hoping for some hay.   Mark motioned toward the pens farther on.  Zeke and David are over there.  They walked past an area where one of the Englishers force pens obscured the view of what lay beyond.  Then the younger men became visible, standing amidst the sheep.  Both had their hats and coats off.  Their suspenders were evident over white shirts.  Zeke had his hands on his hips and was surveying the area around them.   David, Abrahams oldest son, was also looking about.  As they drew closer, though, Samuel noticed that Davids eyes were reddened.  What is it, my sons? Samuel asked.   I count two gone now, Zeke said.  And possibly one of the goats.   Mark grimaced.  Three animals in three days? he said.  And youve checked the fence?  A thousand times.  No breaks.  And the gate is secure too.  Latches perfectly.   David sniffed.  We even changed a latch yesterday.  Got a new one from the smith.   Samuel studied Davids face.  Have you been crying?  David pulled a red handkerchief from his pants, blew his nose.  Started waving the handkerchief as he talked.  Delta was the first lamb my father gave me.  Shes only been sheered twice.  He shook his head.  Im sorry.  I know.  It shouldnt bother me.  He looked around.  Things arent right here, Bishop.  Something just isnt right.   Samuel placed a hand on his shoulder.  I know, son.  This is our wilderness.  Our time of testing.  Be courageous.   David just shook his head.   The Israelites dwelled in booths in the desert, did you know that? Samuel said.   Booths, bishop?  Samuel motioned toward the settlement.  Yes, for a short portion of their journey.  They dwelt in square dwellings made of temporary material.  Just like us.  He nodded at the nearest group of sheep.  They doubtless lost some animals along the way.  Sheep especially.  He brought his hands together.  The Lord protected them, though.  They made it to the Promised Land.   David nodded, wiped at his nose again.  Yes, sir.  They made it, sir.   Samuel began to subtly rock on his feet.  Ya, but that doesnt solve the mystery.  His eyes searched the perimeter of the bay.  Outside the settlement, there werent many places to hide.  Few dark areas.  Some rows of storage boxes, but he knew the men had checked around them too.  One thing we know is that theyre on this ship.  They cant walk off.   Zeke nodded.  Hadnt thought of it like that.  But it is true.  They cant leave.   Have you talked to the Englishers? Samuel asked.   Not yet, Zeke said.  His eyes found the floor.  You warned against it.   Samuel nodded.  I did, son.  Our contact needs to be limited.  Yet if I were to theorize, Id say this somehow has to do with them.  He looked at Mark.  We are at their mercy here, though.  In their vessel.  They might have ways of finding lost things that we do not.   Mark pointed toward the ceiling.  I remember hearing of a device that could observe a mans appearance.  Perhaps they have something similar in this room.   The young men glanced at each other, nodded.  Father said they are such things as photographers, David said.  Machines that draw onto a piece of paper.  Make exact likenesses.   They do, Samuel said, but I asked that those devices be shut off.  Remember the commandment: No graven images.   Mark bobbed his head, frowned.  They might have other means that could help.   Samuel nodded again.  We should ask.  He searched their faces, motioned for them to come closer.  Let us use our best discretion here, though, men.  As Scripture says, Wise as serpents, but innocent as doves.   Since the move, the Englishers had generally left them alone.  The woman Singer was acting as a liaison between the two groups, but there was something about her that Samuel disliked.  Perhaps it was her siding with Jebediah.  Perhaps it was just the idea of a woman being in such a positionfar outside the role the Lord had ascribed her sex.  That might not be entirely her fault, Samuel thought aloud.  Perhaps there are no men who know their place here, either.   Bishop? Mark said.   Samuel snorted.  Yes, like the biblical Deborah.  He waved at the others.  Yes, my apologies.  I was ruminating on whom to take this to.   Crewmember Singer is their representative, Mark said.  She is here often.   Yes, but Im not sure she has our best interests at heart.  She is caught in a situation she should not be in.  Whether they realize it or not.   We see few of them here, Zeke said.  He glanced upward.  Though I often feel that some are watching.   Samuel shook a finger.  Then thats who you should talk to.  Find one of the watchers.  One of the men.  And tell them.   The young men nodded in unison.   Samuel touched each of their shoulders.  Nodded.  Ya, gut.  And until we know, perhaps we should post our own watch at night.  Againbeing wise.  Being serpents.   Mark frowned but nodded.  Ill talk to some of the men.       16    Everything seemed small to him.  Everything insufficient for his needs.   Congi sat on the floor of his quarters.  He had rearranged the room to more suit his taste, but it still didnt feel like enough.  The bed, the table, the chairseverything was now pushed to the exterior.  He also found that he preferred the room dim, the temperature warm, and the humidity level set to the point that the surfaces nearly dripped with moisture.  For all intents and purposes, he had crafted his own little therapeutic sauna.  His own little cave.  But it was still very small.  He would need more room someday soon, he knew it.   One thing the room size did make easier, though, was the hunt.   The first animal, the lame one, hed slaughtered and eaten without stopping.  Hed left only a pile of clean bones and hooves to testify that the animal had ever existed.  Those he had disposed of in his carts incinerator, of course.  Evidence eliminated.   The problems with that meal, though, had been manifold.  Something about the feed itself had been wrong.  It was too visceral, lacked nuance.  Plus it hadnt lasted long enough.  The meal had been over in minutes.  Then hed been hungry again.   Now with the second animal, he was experimenting.  The room had been cleared, so he let the animal roam for a few minutes.  He watched it circle the room, looking lost and concerned.  It bleated a couple of slow bleats, ran some more, then finally settled at a spot near the door.  It stood parallel to the door itself, watching Congi through one eye.  Its mouth stayed open, as if it would bleat again at any moment.   Congi continued to watch it.  He used his new sense, an ability he had only just begun to understand, that let him see where every major artery on the sheeps body was.  Even though the animals outer covering, the fleece, was incredibly dense, Congi could see through it.  See inside.   Not like a medical scanner would, of course.  Not in great detail.  But it was like his eyes could detect the infrared portion of the spectrum.  He knew where all the warmer spots were.  He could detect every one of them.   And just like his other new abilityto influence others with his breath somehowthis ability must have come for a reason.  If he still did any finding it would certainly help with that.  He could get an outline picture of the contents of a package.  But that behavior, those goals, no longer interested him.   Other crewmembers were beginning to wonder, of course.  Some had even subtly asked.  Whats in the latest shipment, Congi? Have the Amish got anything good? Did you find anything for my nephew? But he didnt care.  Only shrugged away the comments.  Let them find their own stuff.   This visual ability, thoughwell, that was something else.  It had a reason.  A purpose.  It was telling him something.  Leading him somewhere.   So he watched that second sheep until he knew what to do.  Then he acted.  He approached the animal slowly, watching those warm spots.  Zeroing in on them.  The animal stirred, but not much.  Congi remained calm, kept his arms out in front of him.  He made comforting noises, soothing gestures.  Then he touched the beast, worked his fingers into the fleece, and gripped it firmly.  Held it in place.  He sought out the largest warm area, pushed his face toward it, licked, nibbledand felt the blood begin to flow.   The animal didnt even bleat.  He held it tight as he fed, but his grip was unnecessary after the first incision was made.  The animal became more placid.  It just stood there, and after many minutes of perpetual drinking had passed, it slumped into his arms.   The experiment proved two things.  First, that he preferred drinking blood to devouring an animal whole.  He remembered reading once that the fluids that required the least processing by the stomach and other organs got into the body quickest.  Such a thing must have happened with the sheeps blood.  It was instant energy.  And he felt fuller.  Stronger.  There was a definite dietary advantage to it.   The second thing the experiment proved was that there was a sedating effect in his touch and his bite.  He would have never expected such a thing.  More abilities? He wasnt surprised, but he was fascinated.  Fascinated by his continual growth.  His continued ascension.  What else would become possible for him?  As to what had initiated these changes, he didnt care.  They were beneficial changes.  He had clarity now.  Purpose.   Soon he was ready for the next experiment.   Congi had a goat with him now.  By all measures, it was a more formidable animal.  Less puffy.  Less cute.  Two horns and exposed bones.  Like the two sheep before, the goat circled the room.  Bleating and looking lost.  Congi just sat and let it circle.  Let it do whatever it would do.   Again it found a place by the door, but instead of paralleling the door, the goat turned to face him.  The hornstwo straight and pointed spineslowered so they looked formidable.  This goat was not to be trifled with.   Congi smiled.  Would his persuasive powers work here? He got up on all fours and crept toward the goat.  Slowly, one sparse movement at a time.  Closer.   In return, the goat just watched him.  When Congi reached the middle of the room, the goats head lowered a bit more.  There was a short bleat of warning, a scrape of a front hoof, and the goat charged.   Laughing, Congi rolled out of the way.  The goat smacked into the beds side rail.  Made a loud thump.  Bleated again.  Turned to face him.   Still smiling, Congi shook a finger.  He got to his feet, crouched, and put his hands in a soothing pose.  No more of that.  He moved toward the animal again.  The animal glanced at the door behind him, looked at Congi, shuffled its back feet.  Then it gave a short bleat.  But it did not lower its head.  It watched.  Congi moved toward it.  Its head drifted lower but then popped up again, the animal looking Congi in the eyes.   Indecision.   You are fine, Congi said.  You are a necessary experiment.  My next step.  Somehow he got close to the animal without it charging again.  He rested a hand on it.  Caressed it.  Then held it fast.   Hunger gripped him.  But simple nourishment wasnt the only goal this time.  He again sought the warm spots.  Found the largest one in the neck region.  Moved in to bite it.  The animal startled a bit at the prick of Congis teeth, but then it grew calm again.  Congi fed, but he did so slowly.  Sparingly.  He used his new sensing ability.  Watched the warmth inside the animal.  When he saw the warmth fading, felt the heart slowing, he paused in his feeding.  Waited, sometimes hours, for the animal to recover.  Then started feeding again.   He was learning something here.  Something important.           After much of a day had gone by, Congi knew something was still eluding him.  Unfortunately, he thought he had missed it.   He was able to use the same animal for food over an extended period.  To pierce its neck, take its blood, again and again.  That was a small breakthrough.  Not only had he been able to keep the animal alive, but he was able to control his thirst, as well.  Again, a small discovery.  It was not necessary to kill a host to feed.  That gave him more options.  An endless supply of food.  Endless! As long as a planet or vessel had life, so would he.  It was a comforting feeling.  A superior feeling.  The hunter forever loose in a galaxy of prey.   The third test wasnt a complete success, though.  Yes, hed been able to control himself, but his ability wasnt precise enough.  Now seated on the bed, Congi frowned at the results.   The goat lay prone in the middle of the floor.  Congis senses told him it wasnt quite dead, but they also told him it wasnt quite alive, either.  It hadnt moved since hed finished with his last feeding.  Its head was stretched out, mouth open, tongue distended.  Its eyes were open too, but they just stared toward the excretorium entrance.  Unresponsive.   The animals breathing was sporadic.  A dozen heavy draws followed by a pause long enough that the animal seemed dead.  Then it would breathe again.  Begin another cycle.   It was in a coma of some sort.  That much was obvious.  But how long would this last? Would the animal recover or would it stay as it was until it died of hunger or thirst?  Congi frowned, shook his head.  He was beginning to hunger.  He would have to find again.  Yet he didnt want to miss anything important.  Leaving a dead or dying animal alone in his quarters came with a new set of risks.  Typical humans werent as perceptive as he was now, but they werent completely numb either.  Too much noise, too much smellsomeone would question.  Someone would come.  Perhaps he should just end the animal.  Incinerate the remains.   Hunger beckoned.  Surged.   Finally he made a decision.  He would take his chances.  Leave the animal as it was.   Perhaps there was more to learn from it yet.           An hour later Congi guided his cart back toward his room.  The ship was such a changed place now.  The captain, the crewmembersall tried to act like it was business as usual.  Another shipment to be made.  But it was not.  With so many new humans onboard, so many issues to look out for, everyone was distracted.  Overworked.   He was hardly noticed at all anymore.  Doubtless other finders on the ship were having the best days of their lives.  Behaving like ancient tomb raiders.  Filling their quarters with newfound items.  Trading and profiting.   He was glad to have left that life behind.  He had more important things to attend to.  Experiments of galactic consequence.  He thought of the chicken he currently had concealed within his cart.  It wouldnt last him long, obviously.  Such a small creature.  Not many fluids.  But it was something.  Not his preference, of course, but something.   The newcomers seemed to be more active around the sheep pen now.  Even during their sleeping periods.  Perhaps they had noticed his earlier acquisitions.  Grown wary.   Ah, well.   He was versatile.  Flexible.  All predators were.   As Congi was about to turn down the hall where his room was located, he nearly collided with one of the newcomers.  A woman! Oh! she said.  My pardon, sir.   Her face was flushed with color.  Congi detected that warmth distinction right away.  She wore their traditional white head covering and a long blue dress.  Despite the larger and more complex map a human presented, Congi also noticed an unusual warm spot around the womans midsection.  What did that mean?  He felt a wave of discomfort.  He drew his cart back, closer to himself.  It is no problem, maam.  Happens all the time around here.  He glanced at the hallway walls, distracting himself.  They were solid blue, and solid in temperature, as well.   She gave a little curtsy.  My apologies, all the same.   Congi remembered how far they were from Bay 17.  Are you lost? he asked, narrowing his eyes.   The woman smiled.  Yeswell, in many ways, yes.  This ship, it is a puzzle to my troubled mind.   Congi nodded.  Moved ahead slightly so he could look down the intersecting corridor.  His corridor.  Yes, but why are you here? he asked.  Alone?  The womans face changed subtly.  The warmth disappeared.  Im not alone.  My husband is nearby.  Werenearby.  For now.   In crew quarters? he said.  I wasnt aware He smiled again.  Noticed the effect even that had on her face.  Warming it.  He smiled brighter.  Well, where are you trying to go?  She brought her hand to her hip.  Subtly massaged it.  I was told there were food devices somewhere? A place to get something to eat?  Congi kept smiling, turned toward his left slightly.  Yes, they are back that way.  At the next intersection.  But, um He gave a little disarming shrug.  They were sort of empty the last time I checked.  Might want to wait a few hours.  Thats when they usually refill them.   She smiled politely.  Looked past him.  Nodded.  I think Ill go check, anyway.  Just in case.   Congi grabbed his cart.  Started to push it around the corner.  Yeah, you might get lucky.  Find something still there.  The chicken made a one-note muffled cluck.  Congi brought his hand to his stomach.  Pardon.  Guess Im hungry too.  He pushed the cart farther up the hall.  Anyway, welcome to the neighborhood.   The woman tipped her head.  Thank you.  Youve been most kind.   Only the womans head was visible to Congi now.  Dont mention it.  The chicken clucked again.  He hurried forward, checking back a couple of times to make sure the woman wasnt lookingwasnt following.   No denying it.  The ship was changing.           Congi opened the door to his quarters and immediately felt the change in temperature.  He hurriedly pushed the cart inside, enjoying the sensation as the rooms atmosphere enveloped him.  It was like he had his own little domain here.  His own little world.  Wasnt that what hed been looking for all along?  The chicken clucked again.  Congi frowned, pushed the cart so it was even with the excretorium doorway, and turned to make sure the room door had closed by itself.  It had.  If anyone would recognize the sound of a chicken on this ship, it would be the newcomers.  And they were apparently everywhere now.  Perhaps things werent getting as easy as hed thought.   His hunger tugged at him.  Congi took a few steps into the room, laid a hand on the top of the cart, and then paused.  Searched the ground briefly.  Felt a trickle of fear.   The goat was not where hed left it.  It shouldve been on the floor just past the cart.  But it wasnt.   Someone had moved it.   Or?  He pushed past the cart, strode fully into the room.  He could see only the outlines of the different appliances and furniture he had moved.  The chairs, a storage cabinet, the bed.  But nothing stuck out at him as unusual.  Nothing seemed more out of place then hed left it.  He searched for the goats heat map against the temperature background.  The bright crisscross of arteries and veins.   Congi was struck hard in the side, knocked to the ground.  He yelped as he hit and rolled instinctively to his left.  He tried to get his hands up, but a weight hit his stomach, something hard.  He felt pressure from another pointed object, then another and another.  Every place they impacted felt dug into, felt pain.   There was a low moan, like a goats bleat, but a couple of octaves lower.  More primal.  Congi felt heavy breathing and the weight of what he assumed was the goats forehead on his face.  Then something touched his neck.  Congi got a hand up to where the goats left ear should be.  Searched for a horn near there, found one.  Grabbed it and attempted to push it back.   The goat resisted hard.  Wailed an angered cry and lunged again for his neck and shoulders.   No, Congi said.  I want you to stop.  He felt a sudden influx of energy and managed to get both hands on the animals face and then down to its neck.  He pushed up and back.  Pried the animal slowly away from him.   Its garbled wail returned.  Congi glimpsed its left eye.  It was bulging, but not out of fear, out of need.  Raw hunger.   He maintained his grip on the goats neck and slowly rolled it off him and onto the floor.  He held it down and got up on all fours over it.  Well now, he said, looking the goat in the nearest eye.  Thats quite a recovery.   The chicken cackled, and the goat jerked again.  Its eyes moved in the direction of the sound.  It gave another moan-bleat.  Snorted.   Thats my lunch, Congi said, smiling.   He bent closer to the goat.  The animals warmth pattern was all different now.  Almost a solid walljust like in the hallway.  Muted.  Hardly registering.  And what are you now, huh? Not what I left.  Not merely a goat.   The longer Congi stayed near the goat, the more its resistance seemed to wane.  The bleats ended and the eyes focus seemed to soften.  It looked at him, now almost pleading.   Ah, so you know me now, do you? Congi smiled, not really knowing why he said it.  For some reason, talking to the animal just seemed the proper course of action.  Are we friends again?  The goat snorted and began a softer whining sound.  Congi eased his grip, and when the goat didnt immediately lurch, he eased it some more.  Finally, he was able to let go altogether.  He took a few steps back, sat on the bed, and let the goat recover itself.  It slowly got to its feet, shook, and turned to look at him.  Bowed its head.   Congi reached out and stroked the goats head between the horns.  The animal made a throaty sound, something between a bleat and a growl.  Pulled closer to him.   And somehow, Congi sensed a bond.  A new closeness.  The animal was like an extension of him somehow.  Another arm.   He got up and walked past the goat to the area near the excretorium.  To his cart.  Behind the carts incinerator were the shelves.  The top one was now visiblestacked with tools and cleaning supplies.  The middle shelf was covered on both sides and actually a lot larger than most people might assume.  He opened the nearest cover and found the chicken, all huddled in the far corner of the shelf.  He reached in and pulled it toward him.  It resisted, flapping its wings and continually clucking, shedding feathers.  He brought it out where the goat could see it.   The goats eyes locked on the chicken.  It stared at it for many seconds before lookinglike a major might look at a generaltoward him.  Congi expected it to bleat, but it did not.  Only watched.   Curious, Congi said.  You see them now, dont you? The lines of warmth.  Even in this chicken.  A smile.  Trust the lines, goat.  And with that, he tossed the bird into the air.  It clucked and flapped, but before it could touch the ground, the goat was on it.  It gave it a single forehead butt, eliciting only a startled cluck.  It held the stunned avian on the ground, nose in its feathers, searching over the surface.   Find it, Congi said.  The perfect spot.   The movement of both animals stopped.  There was only an occasional snorting breath to show that the goat was doing what now came naturally.  Drinking the blood of the hen.  For its part, the hen lay with wings extended.  Both eyes glazed and staring.  Mouth partially open.   The goat was like him now.  The repeated feedingsthe coma.  Another like him.   Congi felt hunger again.  Finish that one off, he said.  Well get more.           It was Davids turn to watch the animals.   He sat alone on an elevated chair in the middle of the pens.  All around him were thousands of animals.  He felt as if he was at the center of a stampede, with only the safety of the Englisher building material to protect him.  Plastisteel or synthium or some such thing.  Whatever it was, it made narrow and light fence rails.  And somehow those rails were anchored tightly to the ground.  They were as firmly planted as if theyd been dug and backfilled.  Magnetics, Zeke had guessed, but David hardly believed that.  How could a magnet be used so selectively? To be certain, he had tried his belt buckle on the floor.  Nothing had happened.  Didnt stick at all.  Couldnt be magnetics.  Had to be something else.   With the help of the deacons, David and Zeke had convinced two other young men to help with watching the animal pens.  They worked a rotating shift throughout the night.  The previous disappearances had all happened during the sleep period, of that they were certain.  The other two men had been sworn to secrecy, however.   The deacons didnt want the others knowing of the disappearances.  There was already too much distraction.  People going to the Englishers doctors and being given strange substances, having their teeth worked onand in some casesrepaired.  Too many new things.  Too much temptation.  No reason to augment the sins of fear and worry, Deacon Mark had said.  There was already enough exposure to those two already.   The community was one of faith, not fear.  That fact had been cemented only the day before, at the first church meeting since the abandonment.  It echoed in the hymns they had sung:  We cry to you, Lord God, and tell you about our suffering here in the prison and chains into which others have put usOur treasure is the community when we live together.   To his left, a horse snorted, lifted its head to look at him, gave a quick shake, and lowered its head again.  Doubtless awakened from a dream.   David yawned.  Dreaming sounded good right about now.  He tried to keep his eyes working, scanning the pens around him.  To his right were most of the smaller stocksheep, goats, young hogs.  To his left and behind were most of the larger animals.  The cattle and horses.  Some of these were behind him as well.  A few were enclosed in an Englisher field.  One of those fields was behind and to his left.  It made a slight buzzing sound that caused him to want to swat for flies, but this position gave a good view of the small animal pens, so thats where he would stay.   Directly ahead, and past three rows of pens, a line of stacked chicken cages formed a boundary on that end.  Hed seen one of the male Englishers in that area the day before.  Even mentioned the loss of animals to him, as Samuel had suggested.  The man had seemed concerned, had said he would pass it on.  But so far, nothing.   Now he just thought the man a busybody.  Hed seemed to do some cleaning, but hed also seemed to have circled the settlement as if he was visiting a fair back on Alabaster.  Only there to look things over.  He suspected other Englishers of the same behavior.  Even if they had official reasons.   David looked to his left, past the pens there to the settlement proper.  The outline of the exterior walls were visible.  There were also some stretched clotheslines on either end.  Pants and dresses hung out to dry.  David shook his head, looked back at the pens again.  First the boundary left and front, then directly ahead, then right.  On that side was also where their extra belongings were stacked.  Wrapped in white in Englisher style.  Like large and non-descript Christmas gifts.  Theyd searched that area, of course.  Found not even the scat from the lost animals.  Nothing.   He tried not to think of his lost pet again.  It only pained him.  It was a connection to a simpler time.  When there wasnt so much uncertainty.   David yawned again, repositioned himself on the chair.  His shift was almost over.  He hoped Isaacs ability to wake himself was as consistent as he said it was.  So far it hadnt failed, but tonight David felt extra tired.  He reminded himself of his biblical namesake.  How he had probably done the same thing: watched the sheep at night.   He shook himself, patted the sides of his arms despite not being cold.  There was no cold on the ship, hed heardexcept for special storage boxes.  All the cold was outside.  Inside, everything was controlled and pampered.  Englishers.   David noticed movement to his right, near the storage rows.  He turned and focused his attention that direction.  Squinted.  Waited.  Didnt see anything.  Waited several seconds more.  Scanned the packages, looked hard at the shadows.  Frowned.  Rubbed his eyes.  Looked once more.   Again he saw movement.  A dark figure strolled out of the shadows and followed the line of white packages to about the midpoint.  It was a four-legged shadow.  Hard to tell what it was from Davids position, but it was definitely an animal of some sort.  Livestock.  One of the lost ones come home? It had to be.   David climbed off the chair.  He held his hands apart and walked slowly through the pens toward the distant row of boxes.  He passed the young pigs and the sheep pens after them.  Kept his eyes always on that dark shadow.  As he drew near, he realized it wasnt his lost sheep.   It was a goat, and a large one.  Strong looking.   The goat remained where it was and watched David draw ever closer.  It was sandy brown with lighter coloring underneath.  Two straight horns jutted out at an angle from its forehead.  Its ears were down, as if it werent concerned at all.  When he got to within twenty feet, the animal slowly lowered its head, pointing those horns his direction.   Not only are you free, David said, youre obstinate.  A slow nod.  Ive seen your type before, Herr Goat.  We have a pen full of you.   He searched the fence row behind him, saw a circle of rope hung on one corner and walked to it.  He measured it out in his hands as hed been taught, straightened it, and then circled one end to form a noose.  He put the noose end in his right handhis throwing handand jiggled it a bit.  Made sure it felt right.  Smiled.   The goat continued to watch.  He was surprised it hadnt moved.  Hadnt made even a single sound.  It was one bold goat.  He fully expected it to charge.  Depending on what it had been doing, though, it might be tiring.  Also should be hungry and thirsty.  Maybe it wasnt so much bold as exhausted.  David had seen that behavior before too.   What he really hoped was that this animal had been traveling with the other missing animals.  That it somehow might lead him to his prized sheep.  His thoughts returned to the bay itself.  And how he and Zeke had thoroughly searched it.  Where have you been? he asked quietly.  He took another step.   The animal skipped and bolted away.  David threw his lasso, missed, gathered it again and gave chase.  He followed the goat the length of the row of packages and around the corner.   Into shadows.       17    Jeb stared at the table, trying to make more sense of it.   It had become an obsession for him, this Englisher desk.  Over four days of trying, hed managed to awaken the shapes, to move some of the shapes within their orbits, to cause some to line up along the right side of the void.   Hed found one shape, circular with lots of lines, that produced a ship map when he held his hand on it for a few seconds.  This last had been of some use.  It had taken him a few hours to realize he could rotate the map upon the tabletop surface.  And zoom and flip it.  To peer at the ships underbelly like it were some afflicted animal.  Hed even managed to find the cabin where they were staying, though he couldnt see into their actual roomfind himself hunched over the table, with hand scratching the side of his belabored head.  Perhaps that wasnt possible.   He hoped that wasnt possible, actually.   Regardless, he was learning, and that was a good thing.   The outhouse, excretorium, whatever-it-was, was a different story.  He could find the right places to do the most important things, but all the other dials and lights and moveable piecesthose were beyond him.  Made him grateful hed brought his own straight razor.  He was appreciative of the design, though.  The extreme effort and dedication it mustve taken to create such a ship and such contrivances.   What a gift, the human mind.  Even those who didnt walk in fellowshipeven the outsiderswere incredibly gifted.  It made him wonder if the people of Alabaster had missed some good things for their exclusion from it all.  They had certainly lost the full grandeur of the stars.   He looked up when he heard the door open.  Sarah entered holding sealed packages of some food item.  Her food quests were increasing in regularity.  Sarah smiled when she saw him.  Greeted him.   So it was where I said? he asked.   She nodded, held up a green package.  Exactly where you said.   He thumped the desk lightly with his hand.  Smiled.  So Im useful, after all? The desk-void flashed and a persons image appeared on the screen.  It was a middle-aged man like himself.  Very well groomed, dressed in a blue uniform.  Hair combed back and even.  No beard.  Whos this, I wonder?  Sarah walked his direction, shaking her head.  Are you still playing with that thing, Jebediah Miller?  He looked at her.  Shrugged.  Just trying to be useful, he said.  There is no grain to mill here, after all.   She held up one of her sealed finds, squinted at it through the transparent portion of the packaging.  Frowned.  Sometimes I wish we could, though, she said.  Bake our own bread, at least.  Some of this food is terrible.   He nodded.  But doubtless useful to the body.  A hand wave.  These people survive on it.   She drew closer and set one of the packages on the tables edge.  And some of them quite well.  You should have seen some of the Englishers Ive seen.  She formed her arms into a circle in front of her.  Their roundness.  Like our stove back home.   Jeb shook his head.  Not very merciful of you, frau.  These people have machines to do much of their work.  Harder for them to use up their food.   Then either they shouldnt use their machines so much or they shouldnt eat so much.  She sat beside him.  She selected a brown food item and fought with the packaging until Jeb took it from her and, using his pocket knife, cut it open.   He returned it to her, smiled and turned to the table again.  Handsome fellow.  He laid a hand on the image, hoping to get more information.  He was surprised when a red ring formed around it and started to flash.  Now what is it doing?  The flashing continued.  Jeb noticed tiny letters that read contacting and felt a bit of trepidation.  He began to search the rest of the table for something that would make the flashing stop.  Tried pressing a few of the tiny shapes.  The flashing continued.  He shook his head, looked at Sarah.  Not sure what Ive done  Finally, the flashing stopped, but the image itself changed.  Same person, different outfit.  A little less blue, but still Sunday-best quality.  The persons face seemed a little more real, as well.  He was leaning forward and looking directly at Jeb.   Hello, the image said.  This is Captain Drake.  Who is this?  Jebediah looked at his wife, widened his eyes.  She shook her head.  Moved her chair back.   The captain looked away, squinting at another portion of his own desk.  Ah, youre the outcast, correct? Jebediah Miller?  Jebediah brought a hand to his chin.  Smoothed his beard.  I suppose thats true.  A glance at Sarah.  And youre the man who steers this ship?  The captain chuckled.  No, not really.  I leave the steering to younger minds.  Younger hands.   Jeb gave a slow nod.  But you tell them where to go?  Another laugh.  Only if I have to, he said.  Primarily our schedule dictates that.  A smile.  Are you enjoying your stay with us?  Jeb glanced at Sarah, at the empty food packaging in her hand.  There was a hint of blue cream on her chin.  In a manner of speaking, he said.  My wifes concerned about her weight, however.   The smiling continued.  So you found our cafeteria, then?  Cafeteria? Im not sure we have, Jeb said.  Is that the food boxes?  Food boxes? The captain sniffed.  Oh, now.  Let me send you some location ledgers.  He looked busy, eyes darting from one spot to another.  Arms seeming to move.   The next thing Jeb knew, new shapes were filling his tabletop void.  Looking like tiny red stars.  I see something here, he said.  Full of stars.   Yes, stars.  If you activate those stars, youll see a location ledger keyed to a map.  Itll direct you.   Activate, Jeb straightened.  Scooted his chair closer.  Ill activate them then.   The captain looked concerned.  Put a finger on the largest star.  Hold it and A scowl.  Listen, did no one show you how to use your table?  Jeb made a low clucking sound.  Im not sure I know how to use anything here, Mister Drake.   Praise the Lord, Sarah whispered.   Jeb shot her a stern look, waved with one hand.   Waving doesnt do anything, the captain said.  That was tried once.  People waving in the air to interface.  Ended up in lots of accidents.  People getting hit.  He straightened, smiled.  Better to keep things contained, I say.  Keep them inside the desk, then theres always less mess.   Jebediah squinted, unsure of what he just heard.  I had a desk in my barn.  Had lots of tools on it.  A head shake.  Wasnt very contained.   And now you have a desk that is a tool in itself.  Ironic, isnt it?  Jeb nodded.  I suppose it is.   So, Mr.  Miller, Im curious how you contacted us.  How you managed to be the one.   It was a family secret, he said.  Something my father passed to me.  And his father before him.  It wasnt easy.   The captain studied him.  Nodded.  I think I understand.  A legacy of some sort.  The device you used.  Your responsibility.   Jeb nodded, slid his hands on both sides of the table, careful to avoid anything that looked like a star.  Yes.  A glance at Sarah again.  But I have other responsibilities.  Sometimes they get confused.  Are at odds.  The Lords plan seems difficult.  Hidden.   The Lord?  The Almighty.  The Creator of the heavens and Earth.  A smile.  All the earths.   The captain frowned.  But your earth, Alabaster, is lost.  Or will be soon.   Jeb nodded again.  Stroked his beard.  And we are here.  Outside our element.   On my ship, the captain said, smiling again.   So it would seem.  Jeb returned the smile.  So, tell me about this ship, your ship  The conversation lasted many minutes.  The captain described his position and vessel as best he could, though many terms and situationshistory and technologywere beyond Jebs experience.  The same could be said for Jebs portrayal of life on Alabaster.  The beauty of newly-plowed ground, the green of seedlings breaking the surface, the sunrises Jeb had witnessed every morning, these the captain could barely understand.  He could only listen and nod.  But he didnt see it.  Not really.   The talk was beneficial, though.  Jeb discovered that he liked this captain.   Englisher or no.           The connection closed and Seal leaned back in his chair, reflective.  He surveyed his office.  It was very neat, very controlled, but suddenly felt very plain.  His walls contained framed commendations from the Guild.  One for twenty shipments made without incident, another for forty.  Another frame containedalong with a picture of him shaking the admirals handthe certificate of his having reached the position of captain.  Another showed him standing outside this very office, the door marker showing his name.  His position.  He was smiling in that shot.  It had been a good day.   It all seemed artificial now, though, and he didnt know why.  He was a top performer.  A champion schedule maker.  But what else? He felt unsettled.  Very, very strange.   He had used to say that he only ever felt odd when the ship did.  When there was some crisis standing in the way of their deadline.  But such a crisis did not now exist.  Everyone was onboard.  They were in the slip.  The ship was running fine.   Still strange.   The Amish man, this Jebediah, seemed like a good man.  Seal didnt understand much of what Jeb had said, didnt see the point in the dress and belief system, but at least Jebediah seemed genuine.  Genuinely good.  A shame that such a minor eventand a correct choice, at thathad separated him from his people.  More cultural intricacies.  Things diplomats and anthropologists studied.  Seal had trained in neither.   Jebediah had saved their lives, whether they liked it or not.   Seal frowned and shook his head.  He leaned over his desk, thought to check the duty ledgers, maybe go over the latest from the scraddlebox.  The updated regulations and company initiatives.  There were always some of those, and he typically enjoyed reading them.  But after a skim of a few of the headlines, he swiped the reg ledger away.  Studied his empty desk.   Then he brought up the personnel ledger, slowly scrolled the alphabetical listing.  He played over it with his finger before finally straightening in his seat and searching with purpose.  After a few moments he found the name he wanted.  Selected it.  Paused.  Searched the room again.  And with a nod, initiated a call.  He waited for the call ring to flash.   Singers face filled the void.  She looked as pretty as always.  Hair hanging straight this time.  Perfect blue outfit with gold highlights.  Stellar.  She was smiling.  Extra stellar.   Seal? she said.  Yes, Ill have a report for you soon.  Our new guests seem to be doing well.  The facilities weve installed are  Seal held up a hand.  Shook his head.  Singer.   Yes, Seal? Is there something else? Another issue Im not addressing? Or are the scraddle messages not reaching you again? I dont know why  He sniffed.  Smiled.  Singer.   She looked at him.  Bit her lip.   He felt unsettled again.  More so than before.  But different.  Would you like to share lunch with me?  Her eyebrows rose.  A working lunch, Seal? Yes, we could do that.  Which cafeteria were you thinking?  He shook his head.  No.   Seal?  He cleared his throat.  I mean, cafeteria maybe.  Work, no.   Singer drew back a bit, studied him.  Ohbut what will we talk about?  He hadnt thought of that.  Was he really that locked in? That focused.  He glanced at his office walls again.  Frowned.  Of course he was.  Well be creative, he said.  Talk about your homeworld, for instance.  Where you grew up.   The hue of her face changed.  Warmed.  That sounds fairly personal, sir.   Not more personal than regulations allow, I assure you.   A smile leaked through.  And you would know.   He nodded.  Put both hands on the desk.  Yes, I would.  So how do you want to proceed?  Her eyebrows arched briefly, but she still smiled.  I believe we can make that happen.  Seal.   He found that he was holding his breath.  Why would he do that? Very good, he said.  Singer.           Greels shut his eyes and reached to where he knew the leftmost side of the flap to be.  He unsealed it and folded it back using only his sense of touch.  He slowly worked from left to right, unsealing and folding, until finally reaching the other side.  The entire process took nearly a full twenty seconds.   Eyes still closed, he stepped back, and took in a full lungful of Bay 16 air.  Held it.  Savored it.  It was a climate-controlled scent, clean and animal-free.  An Amish-free scent.  He smiled.  It was like coming home.   He slowly opened his eyes, and nearly gasped.  He was seeing the face of a lost love again.  The perfect features, the dark hair.  The woman, the scientist, resting like a babe in front of him.  Frozen in her cryomatrix like an ancient sculpture.  Real, yet still beyond his grasp.   All his fatigue, all his anger at Congi and the doctor, all of it faded away.  Greels just breathed the air and took in her beauty.  Many minutes went by.   What was your life like? he asked finally.  On the station? He searched her eyes.  Did you dream? Did you dance? He sniffed.  Or were you one of those all-business ladies? Like that Singer chick.  Tighter than a loading spring, that one.  All sass and gas, if you know what I mean.   Greels glanced at the ground.  He had placed a mug of dark halfcaff there that hed almost forgotten.  He picked it up, took a sip, rested one arm on another.  NoI dont think so.  Not you.  Youre a good one.  A real one.  Someone I can trust.   He shook his head.  Can you believe it, that med? Had me sent to my quarters! For asking a question! He took another sip, gazing into the womans silent face.  That man was sick, honey.  Crazy sick.  And now hes running around like nothing happened.   He paced to the right.  And then there are all these Amish.  They all look the same, you know.  Using our facilities.  Our medical.  Eating some of our food.  I cant even find a snack anymore.  Machines all empty.  He swore, wiped his mouth, then felt remorseful.  Excuse me, maam.  My talk.  Comes from being in loading.  Goes with the job, you know?  He watched her, suddenly wishing she could be free.  You probably dont, though, do you? Probably like a library where you work.  All neat and clean.  He raised his cup.  Scientific.   He took a couple of steps left.  Sipped again.  Nothing scientific here, my lady.  Just a ship full of packages and a schedule to keep.  Im not even sure our engineers know how it all works, the ship.  They just sit around swiping code here and there.  It would scare them to get their hands dirty.  To actually feel the insides of things.   He studied the frostline that formed a large circle around her face.  It gave the impression that she was trapped inside a snowflake.  A diamond within a crystal.  How long have you been in there now? he asked.  A month? Another sip, to chase away the chill he suddenly felt.  Not long enough to be damaged, I know.  Cryo is safe for years, they say.  He chuckled.  Those scientists.  He shook his head.  I guess at least you have some trust in what you do, right? Putting your full weight into the seat of science.  A frown.  Maybe not by choice though.  Probably not by choice.   He raised his mug in half-salute.  Bah, Im rambling now.  Using air for nonsense.  Still, it is good to have you to talk to.  Im glad were at this point.  A smile.  Where we can talk.  To be past the awkward glances and smiles.  I need someone to listen.  Someone sane.   Greelss communicator beeped.  He scowled, and removing it from his waist, brought it up where he could see the small screen.  He had to hold it a good distance from his face to see it.  Eyes didnt focus like they should, and no medic knew how to fix that.  He hated the small screen.  Hated the medics.   The communicator showed the image of the young male intern.  The one hed sent to the planet to get him out of the way.  Pity they didnt have any more stops before Obelisk.  More places to send him.   What do you want? Greels growled.   The young man startled, then attempted to recompose himself.  I have a new issue at Bay 17, sir.  Thought I should share it with you.   Greels was careful to keep the communicator as close to his face as he possibly could, despite the legibility disadvantages.  He didnt want anyone to be able to ascertain where he was from the background.  Or ask questions.  He paced far away from the matrix to be sure.  The Amish again? he said.  I thought they were all settled.  Handling themselves.   Yes, sir.  But apparently they have had someone go missing.  A young man, early twenties.  Name is something unusual.  The intern squinted at something to his left.  Doubtless the pad he always carried.  Ah, yes, Day-vid.  Or Da-veed, Or something.   Greels nodded.  One of those crazy Amish names, okay, fine.  He shrugged.  Doesnt matter.  So he went for a walk and hasnt come back yet.  I thought those people were all over the island now.  Off getting our food and medical treatment.   I think the medical exams have ended.  But yes, there has been some of that.  Following a schedule Singer arranged.   Singer.   Yes, Crewmember Singer.   Greels scowled.  Right, so she has them out taking tours.  He mightve gotten lost somewhere.  Distracted.  Caught the wrong slide.   The intern shook his head.  Ive checked the schedules, sir.  This David hasnt been out of the bay.  Officially, anyway.  He glanced behind him.  The Amish settlement was just visible there.  They like to stick to their own.  They have things they do.  Together.   Greels rolled his eyes.  Obviously.  But he mustve walked off on his own.  They probably still have some curiosity, these Amish.  Probably get whipped for it, but still.   Whipped, sir?  Greels shook his head.  Never mind.  So why are they concerned?  Because he had a night duty.  Watching the animals, I guess.  And his relief didnt find him.  Hasnt shown up for chores since then either.  Chores, thats what they call  I know what chores are.   Right, well, apparently he never misses.  Plus they have some classes set up.  They discuss their new planet.  Singer has shared all the information we know there.  He didnt show up to that, either.   Greels felt the tug of responsibility.  He drifted toward the door but then remembered the cryomatrix.  He couldnt leave without resealing it.  So why dont they just get Singer on this disappearance? Shes obviously up on everything.  Shes in charge.   The intern shrugged.  I dont know that they like Singer, sir.  Or maybe it is just women they dont like.   Greels thought of the cryomatrix again.  His own affinity for the woman within.  They have women.  Theyre married to women.   The intern twitched nervously.  Women in authority, I mean.  I dont think theyre comfortable with it.  A pause.  Some of them.  I think I was the first man they found.   Greels scowled.  No, probably not.  He looked at the door, frowned.  Have you told the captain?  The intern shook his head.  Should I?  No.  Not yet.  It happened in my bay.  Ill handle it.  Greels brought the conversation to a close, then walked over to the cryomatrix again.  Took the flap of the seal.  Started to lift it.  Have to go now, darling.  Im sorry.   And in his mind, he heard her sigh.       18    Greels arrived at Bay 17 to find a group of Amish men standing just inside the door.  As always, they were all in hats and dark coats.  Some held sticks in their hands.  Possibly canes or handles from farm tools.  They surrounded his hapless intern, who looked truly overwhelmed.   The intern hadnt mentioned it was approaching this.  Theyre like villagers chasing a monster now, Greels thought.  An uncontrollable mob.   Greels squared his shoulders and approached the group.  What do we have here? He brought his hands up, started waving slowly.  We all need to back off.  Need to go back to your business.  Let the boy have some room.   The men looked at him like he was speaking another language.  Many crossed arms.  Stared.  All were serious.   Greels scowled and raised his voice.  I know you can understand me.  Do I need to say it slower?  The intern lifted a hand.  Called Greelss name.  Sir, he said then.  Im all right.  Theres no problem here.  No problem.   Well, it looks like a problem.  Greels moved into the circle of men and slowly worked his way toward the center.  The Amish parted to let him by.  Arms remained crossed, though.   Greels resisted the urge to shove, even though the smell of Amish clothing threatened to smother him.  Hed never realized how strong non-synthetic materials smelled.  Musky.  Part of that was probably the Amish too.  Dont wash enough.  Well, what is this about? he said when he finally reached his man.   They just want to help, the intern said.  Want to form a search party.   Greels sniffed.  Yeah, thats just what we need: more people getting lost.   The intern nodded but looked nervous.  I explained that we have cameras.  Ways to track movement  A larger man stepped out of the crowd.  Big hands.  Heavy.  We need to find my boy, he said.   Greels crossed his arms.  And you are?  Name is Abraham, he said.  It is my boy thats missing.   He nodded once.  Tried to show compassion.  And hes been gone for how long?  At least ten hours now.  It isnt like him.   Greels shrugged.  It is a big ship.  Lots of places to hide.  Does he play games, your son?  Abraham scowled.  Nee, hes too old for games.  In his second decade.  Has a wife.  Put away childish things.   Greels shook his head.  Early bonders, these Amish.  A wife already? Not even a bonding learners permit would be approved so early, much less a license.  Better to spend a long time talking to the woman first.   Especially when they arent talking back.  Greels almost smiled.   We have over a dozen able men here, Abraham said.  We could find more.  The whole community, if necessary.  Just let us search, Englisher.   We have ways of finding things.  Greels pointed up in the general direction of one of the bays ceiling corners.  We have things that watch.  Ways to log peoples movement.  We can find him.   Abraham indicated the intern.  He said they were turned off.  Said there was no record of my son leaving.  That your ship hasnt seen anything.   Greels looked at the intern.  You need to hold more things in.   Im sorry, sir.  Just trying to  There was a shouta female squealfrom behind the crowd of men.  Somewhere near the settlement area.  Then came more commotion.  The crowd of men started to stir.  Turn in the direction of the noise.   Greels saw a number of dress-and-bonnet-wearing women, and behind them, a young man.  No hat, but otherwise Amish.  Otherwise seemingly unharmed.  Smiling.  One of the women clung tightly to his hand.  The group walked along the outskirts of the settlement.  Following the row of temporary dwellings.  Who is that? he asked.   Abraham pushed away from the others.  David! he called.   Greels glanced at his intern, who watched the reunion as well.  Shrugged.  Must be the missing boy, he said.   Greels felt a sense of relief.  People didnt disappear on the Raven.  They could hide a few things, yes.  Find things.  But disappear permanently? Never.  Excepting delivery stops, it was a closed system.  So it looks like were okay, then He contemplated what he should do next.  Now that hed temporarily broken free of the other bays spell.  The one with her in it.  He took a breath, noticed a scent of animal waste.  Shook his head.  Started to turn toward the bay door.   Then he saw something that stirred his stomach.  Made him remember a situation he wanted to forget.  Just beyond the settlement boundary.  On the other side of the reunion.   Congi.   Greels stormed that direction.  When he reached the midpoint, Congi seemed to notice him and brought a hand to his cheek.  Stroked it.  Smiled.  That only made Greels more unsettled.  Angry.  He was almost to Congi when his path was blocked by a large Amish man.  The boys father.  That Abraham guy.   Abraham was looking straight at Congi, though.  Both hands were outstretched.  I hear I have you to thank.   Congi looked genuinely surprised.  His eyes widened and he raised a hand to stop any embrace.  Its okay, he said.  No big thing.   Greels could tell from the reaction of those standing nearby that Abrahams demonstrative behavior was unusual for them too.  I dont think they touch, Greels muttered.  I dont think they hug.   Abraham didnt try to hug Congi, though.  He only extended a large hand.  I would shake your hand.   Something about that didnt seem right either.  Greels remembered again the image of Congi.  How very sick hed been.  How strangely sick.  He took a few hurried steps.  Put an arm between the men.  Where did you find the boy? he asked.   Congi smiled.  Between Bay 14 and here, near one of the entrance slides.  He was following an animal.   An animal?  Yes, a goat, I think.  It was injured.  Mustve fallen into a slide gear.  Something.  Pretty chewed up.  He looked at Abraham.  Sorry for your loss.   Abraham nodded.  That is unfortunate.  But my son is here.  Among us again.  He glanced in the direction of the group of women with his son in the middle.  Nodded.  As it should be.   Greels wasnt buying it.  There was no record of his leaving.  Thats hard to believe unless someone helped him.  Someone used to being undetectedsneaky.   Congi pulled back, feigning outrage.  I have never been sneaky.  Quiet, perhaps.  Not barging around like a gorilla.   Greels found hed clenched his fists.  What are you insinuating?  Were talking, Greels.  Just speaking together.  He looked at Abraham.  It is the start of fellowship, isnt it?  Abraham looked slightly puzzled, but he bowed his head anyway.  It is.  So says the Ordnung.   Greels frowned.  I dont trust you, Congi.  I know this is where youve managed to be assigned, but theres something wrong here.  Theres nothing you should be interested in.  No fancy tech you can steal.   Im an honest man, Greels.  An honest, hardworking man.   Greels laughed out loud.  I know you better.  What if I write a report? Start an investigation into why the boy disappeared.  Talk to the captain.   You can do what you like.  Im sure the captain will see it my way.  If I can speak to him.   Greels smelled animal waste.  Felt disgusted.  He frowned and turned to look at Abraham.  Dont trust him.  Not around your animals, or your sons.  Not around anything.   And with that, he walked away.           ONE DAY LATER    It was nearly lunch time.  Samuel was in his shelter with the curtain pulled.  He had his Bible spread out on the small desk before him.  Trying to outline a sermon for his upcoming message.  It would be their first while inside the leviathan, and he wanted it to be a good one.  He needed to ward off the feeling of danger that surrounded them.  To pull them closer.  To keep them together.   The return of David would help with that.  He could use it as an example.  A tangible result of praying and working together.   As for Jebediah and Sarahs continued absence Well, he could use that too.  Illustrate the effects of the outside world.  How easily we could all be led astray.  Taken in.   There were some illnesses to pray about, as well.  Strange maladiesfevers and sleepfulnessdoubtless the result of exposure to these new surroundings.  Regardless of the Englisher assurances.  A sterile environment, they called it.  Filtered and controlled.  Safe.   But it was not.  One was never able to control as much as they liked.  Samuel knew that for certain.  Life refused to be controlled.   He smoothed the pages of the book.  Squinted.  Certainly something in there would apply.  But what? There were so many distractions.  So little peace.   Samuel heard someone clear his throat.  He looked up to find another shadow outside the curtain.  The profile was unmistakable, as it was the roundest of his deaconsJames.  Samuel scratched his beard, bid him enter.  Are more sick? he asked.   James removed his hat, exposing his hairless head.  I am concerned, Samuel.   About the sick?  James shook his head.  Yes, though I shouldnt be.   Samuel glanced at his sermon notes.  Sighed.  I am confused, brother.   James sighed.  Those who were counted as sick all seem better now.   Samuel nodded.  Ah, gut.  And not because of the Englisher doctor?  I dont know that any have seen her.  Theyve been obeying our latest admonition, Samuel.  To avoid mixing ourselves as much as possible.  To include the Englishers only in the most severe cases.  Initial exams notwithstanding.   So she hasnt seen any with the fever?  James shook his head.  Not that I know of.   Samuel breathed a sigh of relief.  The coming of the fever had been sudden, but no more so than other diseases theyd weathered.  There were some disturbing symptoms, certainly.  But again, their society had been on its own for a long time.  Who knew what was commonplace now? There are no remaining ill effects?  Nee, none that Ive seen, James said.  After the fever comes, the affected tend to rest.  When they awake, they seem better than they were before.  Energized.   Samuel smoothed his Bible.  Ya, it is a passing thing then.  An adjustment to our surroundings.   James nodded.  Only a few hours.  No more.   Derr Herr listens to our prayers.  Rewards the faithful.  Samuel waited a moment, expecting the younger deacon to bring his update to a close and leave.  He remembered then that James had spoken of concern.  You are still troubled, he said.  What drives your trouble?  James shook his head.  It doesnt feel right.   Nothing will feel right here.  We are no longer our own men.  We are indebted to the Englishers.   Nee, it is not that.  James shook his head again.  Nee, it is the healing.  Those people.  They are different.   You said there were no ill effects.   Ya, but that doesnt mean they are right.   Samuel shook his head.  The Scriptures warn against using feelings to guide us.  Be aware, brother.   James laid both hands on his midsection.  Nodded slowly.  Perhaps I am wrong.  Perhaps I have given in to fear.   Samuel nodded, returning his attention to his desk.  His sermon.  Be at peace, deacon.           The next morning, Deacon Mark stood with his older boy, Benjamin, inside one of the cattle pens.  This particular pen contained his familys three first-calf heifers and two not-yet-weaned male calves.  The cattle were all black-and-white Holsteins.  The genesis of the breed went back to ancient Earth, Mark knew.  They had been bred to make milk, and even now, millennia later, on planets scattered throughout the galaxy, they still did just that.  Made milk.  It was an animal that truly fulfilled its purpose.   Mark nodded at the nearest heiferDoe, the boys had named herand started to walk in her direction.  Tracking him, Benjamin circled around to the far side of the animal.  Together they raised their hands in a sign of comfort.   Doe, for her part, seemed unworried.  Her dark eyes glanced Marks direction as he approached, but she didnt raise her head from the tuft of hay she was invested in.  Only when the boy placed a hand on her backside did she stomp a few times and begin twitching her tailswatting Marks direction as if he were a fly trying to land.  She raised her head and looked at the boy then.  Stomped again.   Now, now, Doe, Mark said.  We dont need to go through this every time.   Does calf had been placed in another pen with similar aged males.  All had already been castrated, and so were more manageable.  Docile.  Doe didnt miss her calf.  That wasnt her problem.  She was just ornery.  Some always were.   Deacon Mark, may I speak with you?  It was a feminine voice, coming from the opposite side of the cow.  Mark frowned, raised an eyebrow.  Tried to place the voice.  One of the young wives, he thought.  For some reason, most of the women came to him before going to Bishop Samuel.  Same could be said for many of the men, as well.  Maybe because he was younger, or less stuffy.  Ah, yes, it was Davids wife.   He nodded to Benjamin.  Got up and walked around the cow.  Deborah was standing along the fence there.  Blond hair barely visible under her kapp, small hands clasping the fence rail.  Arms close to her body.  Nervous.  Timid.   Yes, Deborah, what is it?  Deborah looked over his shoulder to where Doe and Benjamin still stood.  Pardon me for interrupting.  I know milking time is important.   Mark nodded.  It is difficult to keep the schedule here, with no sun.  And so much going on.  But if we dont, theyll dry up.   Deborah nodded.  I understand.  Ill try not to take too much of your time.  You see, it is David.   He is unharmed, correct? I know he was lost for a time.  Does he remember where?  She shook her head.  Nee.  But it is very strange.  He is very different.   Different? How so?  Up all night.  Sleeping at odd hours.  Seems hungry, but he barely touches his food.   Mark noticed that another AmisherZechariah Stronghad entered the pen behind Deborah, intent on milking.  He and his two sons were approaching one of their cows, a tan and white Guernsey.  It was standing completely still, of course.  Waiting.   Perhaps he was eating while he was gone, Mark said.  They have strange food, the Englishers.  Small pills that can suffice for days, Ive heard.   Deborah looked nervously at the blue floor near her feet.  There are other things, she said.  That trouble me.   Doe mooed.  Impatient.  Wanting to get it over with.  What things? Mark asked.  What is it that troubles?  He watches me at night.   He what?  Last night, when I stirred.  I noticed he was sitting up in bed.  Watching me.   Mark smiled.  I sometimes watch my wife at night, as well.  It is a Mark searched for the proper word serene time.  The days toil fades from her face.  I think most highly of her then.   Deborah shook her head.  It is not like that.  It is not in appreciation, like Solomon gazing on his lover.  It is a look of hunger, Deacon.   Mark glanced back at his boy.  Made sure he was out of earshot.  This is not a subject we should be discussing.  Perhaps one of the ladies  Deborahs eyes widened and she shook her head quickly.  Nee, I do not mean that.  Not lawful desire.  Hunger, Deacon.  Her eyes scanned the nearby cattle.  Like a man looks at a steak.   Mark squinted.  And you saw all this while feigning sleep? His watching you with hunger?  It was a sense.  And his breath now: It is unnaturally pleasant.   Ive heard the Englishers have devices for that, as well.  Perhaps he found something while he was gone.   Ive never seen him use it.  And theres something else.  Something worse.   Worse?  Here Deborah looked at the floor, and Mark noticed the muscles in her arm flexing as she gripped the fence rail.  She didnt look up again.  Yes, with others.   Others?  Other women, Deacon.  I see him with them.   Adultery? It was unheard of.  Could the Englishers have corrupted young David so quickly? With who? When?  The Yoder sisters.  I saw him talking to them.  Laughing.  Touching.   Mark frowned.  It was hard to imagine the incorrigible Yoder sisters agreeing over anything.  Especially the company of a man.  And all parties were married! Certainly it wasnt so.  When? Mark asked again.   Last night.  Deborah looked at the ceiling, as if searching for the sun.  Last sleep cycle.  He said he was going out for water and to relieve himself.  But he didnt.  He was meeting with them.  I saw them.  She pointed toward the stacks of boxes that lined the far side of the pens.  They were over there.  Giggling.  She shook her head.  And I dont know what else.  There weresounds.   Mark held up a hand.  You dont need to tell me more.  I will discuss it with Samuel.  Well meet with David.   Deborah shook her head.  I dont think I can stay with him any longer.   First adultery, and now separation? Lets not do anything rash, Deborah.  The marriage bond is most sacred.  For life, as God intended.  I dont know what David is going through.  Perhaps his time away has affected him somehow.   It was only a few hours.  Not even a whole day.  Are the Englishers so strong?  Mark rested a hand on the fence.  Samuel believes so.  It troubles him, I can tell.  Doe snorted behind him.  Work waited.  Always more work.   Tears formed in Deborahs eyes.  I dont know what to do  Be patient.  This is Mark shook his head something we will get through.  Together.  He motioned toward the cow.  I will finish this and then go to Samuel.  You have my word.   Deborah looked him in the eyes.  Nodded once.  She then turned and walked away.   Mark watched her go.  There was something here he did not like.  Perhaps Samuel was right.  Perhaps they really were inside Jonahs fish.       19    Jebediah felt a hand on his shoulder, followed by a hard squeeze.  Jebediah Miller, Sarah said.  You need to leave that thing immediately.   He looked up from the table with its ever-present void, much of which was now filled with text.  Some of the spellings were different than he was accustomed to, but he found he could read it all right if he took it slow.  Let his mind fill in the missing details.  I dont know if I can, he said.   It was early morning.  Milking time, he knew.   Sarah was wrapped in a white floor-length nightgown, having just arisen from slumber.  She stepped back, crossed her arms, and tapped her foot on the floor.  You should be studying the Word, she said.  Or reflecting on the Ordnungs wisdom.  Finding a way to rectify yourself and return us to fellowship again.  Thats what this time is for.  What it is supposed to be for She leaned back against the bed.  Even in the dim light, it looked like she might tear up.  I miss them all.   Jeb nodded.  And you think I do not? I have many friends among them.  I have animals I should be minding.   Yet youwestay here.  Living among the Englishers.  Dabbling with their devices.  Eating their manufactured food.  She glanced down.  Who knows what that will do to our child?  Jeb sighed.  The Englishers have children, Sarah.   Yes, but they are used to their food.  She shook her head.  I am not.   Sarah He stretched out a hand.   She shook her head.  She would stay where she was.  I think highly of you, Jebediah.  But I am unhappy with you.   He attempted a smile.  Such seasons must happen.  Like winter or fall.   She scowled at him, shook her head, stared at the floor again.   I am sorry, he said.  I know I disappoint you.   Have you given any thought, she asked, any thought at all to what it will be like when we arrive? On the new planetNew Alabaster, or whatever they will call it? She held up a hand.  We cant be separated from everyone there.  We cant live on our own.  Im sure there will be winters.  Droughts.  Fires.  Wild animals.   Ill be armed, he said.  Ill build us shelter.   Sarah shook her head.  Jebediah She breathed heavily and put both hands on her knees.  She then leaned forward as if to make herself more comfortable.  Probably it did help, Jebediah thought.  Body changes.  Sarah glanced up at him, at the desk.  What is it youre reading? Not the Scriptures, I gather.   Jeb turned toward the display of text.  No, I havent found them yet.  Doesnt mean theyre not there, though.  A smile.  But I am searching the past.   What past?  He indicated the desk.  Their past.  Their systems.  The stars and planets they travel to.  The places people live.  Ive even seen our new home.  Beautiful place.   It is?  Ya.  A gift, but  Sarah raised an eyebrow.  But? There should be none of those.  They promised.   He sniffed.  No, not there.  Not with the planet.  I just never realized He sought Sarahs eyes.  Weve missed much.   Have we?  Jebediah looked at the lights in the ceiling.  He sniffed.  I dont understand it all, obviously, he said.  Dont understand much of it, actually.  But theyve discovered a lot of ground.  A lot of tillable land out there.  Many more planets than were known even when the Lancaster colony was founded on Alabaster.   And theyve filled them all with their things, Id venture, she said.  With their whirring gadgets and toys and tasteless food.  Distractions from reality.  From walking with Derr Herr.   Jeb nodded slowly.  Ya, that is doubtless true.  It is hard to see the Lord in any of it.  He shrugged.  But He must be there.  Thats what Scripture promises: that Hell always be there.  Depths of sea or heights of heaven.   Sarah shook her head.  But none of that is for us, Jebediah.  None of it builds community.   Jebediah sighed, looked at his hands.  Im not so sure.  I know more now.   Sarah straightened.  Are you becoming an Englisher, Jeb? Youre troubling me.   He sniffed.  No, I  What?  Do you know, they can blend animals together? Like you making cake batter.  A pinch of this, a scoop of that.   Her brow furrowed.  Like cow mixed with pig? Or goat with chicken?  Ya.   Horrendous.  Abysmal.  Abominations.   Jeb nodded slowly.  Though it isnt new, this practice.  Some of our animals were altered too over the generations.  The original animals.  The first ones on Alabaster.  Made more hearty.  Able to survive our world.  Designed that way.  So all along, weve been dependent on them to some extent.  On what theyve done.  Even though we didnt admit it.   Sarah laid a hand on her stomach.  Weve been eating abominations? I feel ill.  She shook her head.  But it was still our grandparents that cleared our land.  That cultivated it.   Jeb raised a finger.  Yes, but theres more.   Sarah stood and walked slowly past him.  Day lights, she said aloud, and the rooms blue lights turned to a more violet shade of white.   Jeb squinted, frowned.  Some warning next time?  Like you warned me about your call to the stars?  Fair point, my frau.   She rested a hand on her right hip.  Made a thoughtful face.  I am hungry.  Will you run and get me something.   But these cafeterias can provide all that we  She glanced down.  My feet are starting to hurt.   The floors were soft and cushioned.  But then Jeb remembered Sarahs burden, put both hands on his knees.  Of course.  I will.  But I want to tell you more.   Im not sure I want to hear more.  It isnt important.  Not to us.   He stood, took a step toward her, but she was already turning, shuffling toward the excretorium.  But I think it is, he said to her back.   She stopped, turned.  So what is it, Jebediah? What more do you want to share?  He found himself looking down.  Examining the cloth and cushioned floor.  Blue with dark patterns like the numeral eight.  There have been wars, he said.  Ones that ranged from one planet to the other.  In the space around the planets.   And that surprises you? The Englishers are always fighting over something.  That is their nature.  Part of the reason we separated from them.  You know the histories.   Jeb nodded.  Yes, but there were battles in our system.  Not far from Alabaster.   Near us?  Yes, I dont understand all the motivations.  All the characters.  But one warlord wanted to land on Alabaster, to take it.  This was in our grandfathers time.   Ya, so?  He was stopped.  Sent away.   Sarahs hands found each other.  Knitted nervously together.  So again the Lord protected us.  As the Scriptures promise.   Jeb moved closer, touched her elbows.  Yes, Sarah.  Of course He did.  But dont you see?  See what?  When He protected us, He used them to do so.  The Englishers! Even when we didnt know.  Even when we werent involved.  They were fighting to keep us safe, and we never knew.  Never thanked them.  He shook his head.  Many died to keep us safe.   Sarah shook her head.  I think youve stared at that desk too long, Jebediah.  I dont see your point.  But I am still hungry.   Jebediah sighed.  He walked to the cabinet nearest the door and opened it.  Retrieved his hat and put it on.   Sarah watched him.  So what are you trying to say, my husband?  The Amish are lovers of our community, ya? Jebediah reached for the door handle.  Opened the door.  But now I wonderperhaps community is larger than we thought.           Samuel was again huddled over his desk.  Still searching, struggling, for the exact words to give the people.  Something to speak to their current circumstance.  To unify them.   The story of Jonah remained foremost in his mind.  Could he preach from that? In Jonahs case, the prophet was specifically called by God to visit the heathen.  To go to wicked Nineveh.  It didnt seem to apply here.  There had been no call, only coercion.   Samuel knew more about the story of Jonah than most.  Most ministers focused on Jonahs disbelief and his unwillingness to serve.  The reluctance of a Hebrew prophet to go to an unwashed Gentile nation.  How cold, how unloving.  Isolationist.   He remembered the brutality of the Assyrians, that road lined with pikes.   Every step, death wouldve been staring Jonah in the eyes, yes.  But every stride also wouldve reminded him of why his people were different.  Special.  Chosen.  Set aside.   Samuel turned in his Bible to the book of Jonah.  Furrowed his brow.  Perhaps it wasnt so irrelevant to their situation, after all.  He took a pencil and some package wrap hed found in a corner of the bay, and he began to make some notes.  Twenty minutes went by.   He noticed the curtain move.  Mark stepped in, followed closely by James.   Marks hat was off and pressed to his chest.  His face showed concern.  I A glance at James.  We need your guidance.   Jamess hat remained on.  He nodded and smiled when he entered.  A different demeanor than the last time hed visited.  He seemed to have regained some of his jovialness.  Perhaps the Lord had brought him comfort.  Reassurance.   Im glad youre both here, Samuel said.  I am preparing the sermon.  I have some ideas.   I look forward to hearing it, but Mark dipped his head.  Looked at the floor.  Im sorry, this is a difficult matter.   Samuel closed his Bible and folded his hands over it.  Straightened himself.  Is this about the sick again?  Mark glanced again James.  Sick? No, I didnt know we had more sick.  How many?  Weve warned against rumoring, James said.   Have you come spreading rumors? Samuel asked.   James smiled.  Nee.  Our warnings have been effective, is all.  And my opinions have changed.  My concerns have lifted.   Mark looked puzzled.  I see, he said.  I apologize.   Samuel nodded.  So why are you here? he asked.   We have a problem to discuss.  A problem of sin.           Seal felt different inside.  Stronger.  More alive.  But also fragile.  Insecure.  Nervous.  Working way outside his comfort zone.  Out of his office, literally and metaphorically.  Beyond any desk or schedule ledger.  And the reason for his discomfort sat across from him, smiling and unaware.  What a peculiar situation.  Uncharted.   He and Singer were in the cafeteria together.  Again.  The third time in as many days.  The cafeteria was purposefully homey.  The walls were a medium green with mounted light fixtures.  There were large ceiling fans over various portions of the room.  And despite what most people pictured when they thought cafeteria, the room wasnt a wide open affair.  It was subdivided by numerous interior walls, creating dozens of partially obscured eating areas.  Perfect for privacy.  Perfect for intimacy.   Was that what he sought now? Intimacy?  How distracted he had become.  The search for additional commendations had lessened.  His quest to rise in the admirals estimation.  Even their schedule seemed secondary nowa near blasphemy for the old Seal.   He forced himself to smile larger than he normally would.  Tipped his head slightly forward.  He watched as Singer sipped her drink and placed it back on the table.  She looked completely comfortable.  In control.  The opposite of how he felt.  Her hair fell in small perfect curls.  Her lips were reddened but not excessively so.  There was just the hint of shadow to her eyes.  Her complexion was warm.  She was dressed in a non-regulation blue dress, and Seal adored it.  There were matching bands around her right wrist and left middle finger.   Seal distracted himself.  Looked down at his food.  The preparers are outdoing themselves tonight.  The brown square on his plate wasnt real steak, but it absolutely tasted like it.  Cut like it.  And the vegetables, the carb dishexquisite.   Singer brought a napkin to her mouth.  Tapped it lightly.  Smiled.  It is wonderful.   The wall to Seals right displayed a simulation of a coastal dock scene.  Calm water, lots of large boats gently rocking.  Occasionally a bright bird would swoop into the picture.  He thought the planet might be Reymal.  I wish we could see outside, he said.  I never realized it before, but I enjoy reality.  Not these simulations.  He sighed.  Except, now theres the fog.   Singer nodded.  It can be claustrophobic, cant it? The ship.   I suppose thats a good word for it.  Even though the Raven is large, the fog makes it small.   Singer nodded, drew quiet.  Yes, it is a small ship.   Seal raised an eyebrow.  I suspect youre alluding to something else.   She speared a bite of her white meat-like substance and raised it to her lips.  Glanced to her left.  Chewed.  This isnt allowed, what were doing.   Having lunch?  She frowned, indicated them both with her fork.  Us, together.  Like this.   Seals turn to frown.  We discussed this.  Im suspending those rules.   Singer sat back.  So you sent out a bulletin? Suspended it for everyone?  Seal looked at the dock scene again.  There was a city across the water, he noticed.  Lights.   Seal?  Of course not.  He motioned toward his chest.  Just in here.  With us.  Ive suspended them.  I need some flexibility.  A change.   But we still have a schedule  He felt a touch of anger.  Fought it back.  And well make it.  Thats my job.   Singer shook her head.  Took a drink from her glass.  Never mind, I dont want to talk about our schedule.  Im sorry.  She noticed the wall scene now.  Squinted at it.  I wouldve loved to live on the water like that.   On your homeworldNewmarket, was it? Was it a dry place? We havent talked about it.   She frowned.  Not worthy of discussion, really.   Of course it is.  I want to know everything.   Im sure you dont.  It was a boring place.  And yes, dry.   Seal nodded slowly.  You said there were farms.  Animals, wide open spacesdoesnt sound too boring to me.  Sounds peaceful.   Singer startled.  Really, sir? I wouldve never imagined  I like to save some surprises.  Keep you guessing.   She smiled, chuckled a bit.  So do I.   It gave him confidence.  Helped.  Listen, I enjoy your company.  Youve taken some of the routine out of my life.  And thats a good thing, I think.  Since the planetary expansion so long ago, the protocol for relationships had gotten very messy.  Complicated.  Yet at the same time, regimented.  There were lots of forms and applications.  He hadnt filled out any of them.  He had started to research, and hed found that the relationship ledger was larger than their cargo ledger.  Exhaustive.  Problem isIm not sure where to go next.   Singer shifted in her seat.  So we are going somewhere, then?  Well, Id like to.  A smile.  I am a captain, after all.  We go places.  He scratched his arm.  But first theres the application for temporary cohabitation, then theres the offspring matrix, the naming sub-ledger, the weekly and monthly status updates, the  Cohabitation?  Seal felt a flush of embarrassment.  Thats the first relevant form I could find.  Or should we start with personality refraction? Probably shouldve done one of those already.  See if either of us will injure the other.  A trip to the splicers is typical these days too.  Full mapping and overlay.  He frowned.  See, there is so much  Singer just stared at him.  Hands clasped together over her plate.  Not saying a word.   What?  She shook her head.  My expectations.  I mean, Im not sure  He leaned forward.  That would be helpful, yes.  What do you expect?  Something different.  Not thatlistwhatever it was.   Seal put down his silverware.  Wiped his mouth with his napkin.  But Im trying to do the right thing.  At least, I think I am.  Those items are the accepted way now.  At least for Guild members.   Well, thats not what I want.   He nodded.  See, I need to know those things.  We can start with what you want.  Thatd be good.  There are different planetary traditions, obviously.  Most of those were superseded by the Perlot Treatybut still, we can allow for Newmarket customs.  Are there any? Do you have different forms?  Singer looked away, shook her head.  Looked at Seal again.  I dont want to cohabit with you, lets start there.   Seal drew back.  Oh, well thats different.  He felt himself deflating, retreating into those insecurities.  A more casual relationship then? I have to admit, I had been hoping that  Singers eyebrows raised.  Not casual, no.  Not at all.   Seal paused.  Stared at Singer.  Wait.  You arent one of those romantics, are you? Have some inherent attachment to a value system? Like our cargo?  Im not Amish, if thats what you mean.   Seal felt suddenly embarrassed, and he wasnt sure why.  No, no, of course not.  You use things.  Technology.  I know youre not Amish.   But value systems bother you.   This was not going well.  Seal gripped the edge of the table for comfort.  Again, of course not.  Guild rules incorporate a value system, after all.  I just want to know if, you know, if there is something weird.   And what is weird?  Seal looked at the seaside image again.  The sky seemed darker.  There were new clouds, as well.  UmI dont know.  Devotion to a historical figure long dead, I guess.  Like the Amish.   So you know what they believe?  A frown.  I read your report.  Did some research.  There are a lot of dead Earthmen that influence them.  Theres this Amman character  Singer nodded.  He was in favor of strong church discipline.  Including shunning.  Felt the Mennonites were drifting from sound teaching.   Seal raised a finger.  Yes, thats right.  And then there was Isaiah Wellspring, who proposed the settlement of Amish colonies.  And Felix Manz and Conrad Grebel and a palette of other oddly named characters.   She shook her head.  Yes, but I dont follow any of them.   Seal smiled.  Hope rose again.  See then.  Youre not weird.   No, I dont have any devotion to dead men.   Seal relaxed.  A little romance is a good thing.  A little mystery.   Singer pushed her plate slightly forward.  Im glad you think that.  Im a Christian.       20    It was all playing better than he imagined.  His needs were being fulfilled in new ways.  Whereas before, hed thirsted for things, whereas hed dug through packages to collect trinkets and shinies, now hein essencecollected men.  One by one, soul by soul.  Men.  And women.   Congi turned to look at the young beauty on his arm.  Pale complexion, without facial enhancement of any sort, but clearly still beautiful.  She was dressed in a simple grey dress tied at the hip.  Nondescript in every way.   Yet to him, her body and face were alive with activity.  Pulsing with color.   She was coming willingly, eyes hardly moving from his face.  Devotion, pure and simple.  It was more than hed ever had from any woman in his life.  That alone would thrill him if it werent for the thirst.  The thirst always dominated.   Enlisting David to his cause had been the best decision hed ever made.  True, the process felt a bit unnatural at times, a bit uncomfortable.  But now the young man was every bit the servant that the goat was.  It was nothing for him to share.  And he would continue to share out of gratitude for the new life he had been given.   It was a new life, wasnt it? A rebirth.   Congi led the Amish woman away from Bay 17, onto a minor slideway, and up to one of the major slides.  From there, he took her on a short tour of the ship.  There was nothing suspicious about their trip at all.  Certainly some cameras would note his presence with the Amish woman, but he had friends in security.  Close friends now.  Additional servants.  If he wanted to, he could steal anything in any bay.  His power was growing.   Was he more powerful than the captain? Maybe not yet.  But soon.   The womans eyes looked away from him, making a full sweep of their surroundings.  She paused when she saw one of the dimly lit lesser bays passing them on the left.  She gasped and brought a hand to her mouth, reactinghe presumedto the sheer size of the space.   A simple elbow touch brought her attention back to him.  Ahead was a stopping point, brightly lit.  She winced a bit at that too, but other than gripping his arm tighter, she stayed on course.  Stayed with him.  They reached that stopping point and continued on.  Ten minutes later, they exited the major at another stop and descended to Congis floor.   You are an amazing person, the woman said.  To live in such a place.  And to guide someone like me.  To take your time.   Congi smiled but made no response.  He just blew into her face.  Her eyes showed ecstasy.  She returned the smile.  Nodded.   They entered the hallway leading to his room.  It was completely quiet.  Most of his neighbors were working during this hour.  He rarely worried about schedules anymore, but this lull in activity was convenient.  He held the young lady tight.  She smelled as if shed recently washed.  There was a hint of some spicecinnamon, perhapsaround her as well.  Had she scented herself especially for him? He wanted to think so.   A door ahead opened.  A middle-aged man stepped out, dressed in dark pants and white shirt.  He held an Amish hat in his hand.  Bearded.  Congi startled.  What was an Amish man doing here? Hopefully not looking for the young woman.  He had yet to use his newfound strength in violence.  He was hoping not to start now.   He remembered the Amish woman he had met in the hall earlier.  The one who had made him feel unsettled.  Ah, yes, the outcasts! This must be where they were being quartered.  How inconvenient.   The man froze when he saw Congi, staring hard at both him and the young woman.  Lucile? he said finally.  Why are you here?  At first, Lucile didnt respond, but after a nudge from Congi, she turned to look in the mans direction.  Who are you? she asked.   The man placed his hat on his head, squinted.  Im Jebediah Miller, he said.  I used to mill your fathers grain  Many pardons, she said, dipping a bit at the knees.  Have you met my friend, Herr Congi?  Jebediah acknowledged him with a slow nod.  I have not.  He didnt offer his hand.  Rude, but not uncommon for their guests.  They were all a trifle standoffish.  Doubtless afraid to touch an Englisher.  To interact.   Congi contemplated using his breath, his pheromonal influence, but if he did so he risked losing some of his sway over Lucile.  There were limits with the unconverted.  Boundaries.  He decided not to push it.  He wanted the woman where he could give her his full attention.  Trace her map of warmth.  Feed his hunger.   So, why are you here? Jebediah asked again.  Away from your family? From the settlement?  Congi sneered.  She could ask the same of you, couldnt she? He fought the tickle of hunger.  The need.  He hoped antagonism would cause the man to back off.   But it didnt.  Jebediah seemed to stand taller, in fact.  Have you been shunned, as well, Lucile? he asked.   Lucile giggled.  Shunned? Oh, no, no.  Shunning is for the lost.  The faulty.  Im not either of those, am I, Congi?  He smiled slightly.  Of course not.   That seemed to deflate the man a bit.  Clearly the sting of shunning was important to these people.  Congi understood being an outsider, though.  Hed played that role all his life.  Dont take that personal, Mr.  Miller.  Congi smiled.  Who needs them, right?  Jebediah raised an eyebrow.  Pardon.  Who needs who?  Those people, Congi said.  The ones who put you and your wife out.  Youre better on your own anyway.   Jebediah glanced at the door he just exited.  I dont know that I am.  It is very different.   Congi clapped a hand on his shoulder.  Well, you are, bub.  Believe me.   The contact seemed to unsettle Jebediah.  He shrunk back a bit.  Frowned.  He addressed Lucile again.  You shouldnt be here, he said.  It isnt right.  Your reputation is at stake.  The working out of your salvation.   Congi sniffed.  Is that what youre doing, Jebediah? Working out your salvation?  The man paused.  Clearly thinking now.   Congi took that moment to coax the young woman farther down the hall.  She came willingly.  Smiling both at him and at his Amish neighbor.  They had only a few more doors to go, and he would be able to feast again.  He felt a shiver of expectation.  Hoped the woman didnt sense his need, whether it would make a difference or not.   Jebediah took a step to follow.  Release her, he said.  This instant.   Lucile snuggled into him.  I want to be with him, Herr Miller.  I like him.  He likes me.   Congi smiled.  Pulled her close.  I do, he said.  I really do.  He studied Jebediah.  There was something fun about manipulating the man, without really manipulating him with his breath.  Ive done some research.  Dont you have a thing where you allow young people their freedom? To go out and experience the world? Free of the rules? He nodded.  The boring clothes?  Jebediahs hands were clenched.  Rumspringa? We never practiced it on Alabaster.  It wasnt possible.  He motioned toward Lucile.  And shes too old for that.   Congi shrugged.  Well, perhaps you should have found a way.  All that curiosity left unmet.  Generations of it.  He nodded.  Im sure you have some yourself.  If you want, I can show you around later.  Enlighten you.  He took another couple steps back, reaching his door.  He worked the pad and heard it snap open.  Smiled.  Tugged Luciles arm.  Anyway, think about it, Mr.  Miller.  It was nice meeting you.  With one final pull, he brought Lucile inside and quickly worked the door control.   Lucile looked up at him longingly.  She had no idea what was about to happen to her.   And neither did the man outside.  Life had gotten so interesting.  So incredibly enjoyable.           Samuel felt pain in his gut.  He placed an elbow on the desk and rested his forehead against his hands.  Savored the coolness of his own skin.  He sighed, breathed a quick prayer, and massaged the scalp below his hat.  Uncovered his face again.   The two deacons just stared at him.  Waiting.   David is cavorting with how many women? Samuel shook his head.  How did I miss this?  Deborah says at least the Yoder sisters.  But she suspects others.   Deacon James nodded slowly.  Ive witnessed him with other women.  I didnt recognize it as what it was.  Wanted not to think evil of my brother.  But now  Samuel straightened himself.  Tried to shoulder off the burden.  And where are their husbands?  Both of them have been among the afflicted, Samuel.   Samuel shook his head again.  Using their husbands weakness as license? He looked up at the bays dark blue ceiling, a seeming ribcage of blue metal.  This shiplook what it has done to us already.  Samuel placed both hands on his legs.  Pushed himself to a standing position.  We need to get to the bottom of this, bruders.  And it needs to be now.   He walked between them to the curtain and parted it.  The bustle of people outside was noticeably light.  He knew there were some training meetings happening and that the women were doing wash today.  But still, it seemed light.  He noticed the large sliding door far to the left of him.  He heard a cow lowing.  A worried bleat from a sheep or goat.  All the dwelling curtains were pulled closed around them, though.  Every interior a mystery.  Closed off.   How had that happened? And so quickly?  He turned to Mark.  Remind me, which way is Davids dwelling?  Ill lead you, Bishop.  Mark stepped around him, pointed to the left, and led that way.  Samuel and James followed.  The settlement dwellings were generally clustered in groups of ten, with five facing one way and five the other.  Despite the proximity, the material the Englishers had used for construction was surprisingly noise-reducing.  Seemed more so today, Samuel thought.   They passed row after row of dwellings.  Occasionally they would pass an Amisher, but all seemed more stoic.  Even the children.  Two small girls passed them holding hands.  They walked slowly and properlyas they shouldbut it was almost too slow.  Too proper.  The skips were no longer merely contained; they were non-existent.   Samuel felt another twinge of loss.  How did I miss this change?  Lord, I underestimated Satans power.  We shouldve stayed on Alabaster.   Finally Mark stopped at a corner dwelling.  The curtain was closed, so heas was the unwritten custom nowknocked on the exterior next to the curtain.  A female voice bid them enter.  Mark opened the curtain.   Within was a single woman.  Deborah, Samuel thought her name was.  She was seated on one of the dwellings two chairs.  Tears streaked her face.  Hes not here, she said.   Where is he? Samuel asked.   She shook her head.  Wiped an eye.  I dont know.   But where do you think he is?  He spends lots of time near the possessions now, she said.  Near the crates and boxes.  Another dab at her eyes.  They all do.   Samuel felt anger and sadness.  They.  He nodded at the other men.  Let us go.   They passed four additional dwellings to reach the edge of the settlement.  From there, they crossed the intermediary space to the livestock area.  One of their older members was seated in the elevated watcher chair.  He was slightly hunched with his hat resting on one knee.  When he saw them approach, he raised a hand in greeting.  Scratched beneath his chin.  Returned to scanning the pens.   Samuel frowned, passed him by.  After what seemed a long walk later, they reached the row of wooden crates and sealed boxes.  The possessions had been arrangedwith the Englishers helpin such a way that the most necessary supplies were closer to the settlements and lower to the ground.  Easily accessible.  He hadnt realized how much of a metaphor that was: that the most important things are always the most exposed.  Most open to anyones hands.   He reached the first row.  It looked normal, so he turned and walked to the far right edge and then around it.  Glancing down the interior row, he saw nothing unusual.  Perhaps he isnt He squinted with a second look, and noticed that some of the crates appeared out of order.  There seemed to be a large hole in the middle of the row.  He turned and walked that direction.  When he reached the hole, he paused and glanced back at the others.   What is it? Mark said, jogging up behind him.  James came too, but with more effort and labored breathing.   Samuel was surprised at how little his joints were aching since hed entered the ship.  It was as if the air was lighter.  That was one positive in a world of negatives.   He pointed at the hole.  It was more doorway than hole, actually.  The crates had been rearranged to give the feeling of a short, cave-like opening.  Looks like someone has made their own dwelling back here, he said.  Outlandish.  He stooped to look inside, only to have the opening darken with the shadow of someone coming out.  He stepped back, feeling righteous fire in his bosom.  Straightened himself.  James and Mark took supporting places on either side of him.   The person who exited was a woman, though it took him a moment to recognize her as one of their own.  Her kapp was gone, and her dark hair hung free and loose over her shoulders.  Her dress was a mockery of what the Ordnung required.  It had started out appropriate, obviously, but the bottom had been slashed to expose one of the young womans legs.  The shoulders and arms had been ripped off too, exposing more bare skin.   Mary Magdalene Salter, Mark said, what is the meaning of your dress? You shame yourself.   Mary smiled, looked down, and made a sweeping motion.  Dont you love it? Im so free.   Another shadow moved at the opening.  A second young womanthe other Yoder sisterstepped out.  She was equally ribald in both dress and demeanor.  Long blond hair being the most notable difference between her and her sister.  She smiled at Mary and then clung to her, touching heads as they chuckled at a joke only they knew.   Where is David? Samuel asked.   Mary motioned toward the opening.  Hes in there.  Hes busy.   Please have him come out, Samuel said.   The other sisterKatie, he thought her name waslooked at the opening and shrugged.  I can ask him, but I dont think hell want to.   Why not?  She giggled with her sister again.  Because hes busy.   Doing what? There are chores he could be doing.  Training.   She crossed her arms, swung her hips a little playfully.  Hes eating.   Away from his family? Mark said.  Away from his wife? He pointed in the general direction of the settlement.  The young woman we just left crying in her room?  Deborahs an old coat, Mary said.  A real horseless plow.  Going nowhere.  The sisters giggled again, touching hands.   As much as he was trying to be merciful, Samuel could barely contain his anger.  This was the sort of behavior hed worried about most.  The sort of situation hed hoped to avoid.  And a single day of Davids unsupervised absence had led to such a thing? The Englishers with their technology.  What had they brought about? Samuel took a deep breath.  Steadied himself.  I need you to bring David out, he said.  We need to talk with him.   Mary smiled, twirled her hair with a finger.  I could talk with you, Bishop.  Discuss new things.  She brushed her bare thigh.  Show you things.   For the first time, Samuel noticed the sweat on his brow.  He wiped at it.  Clenched his fists.  Renewed his resolve.  David needs to come out here, he said.  This instant.   Mary rolled her eyes.  Such a demander, she said.  Look at him, sister, how absolutely rigid he is.  How tight.   Think we could loosen him up? Katie said.  More giggles.   Samuel looked at the deacons.  Should we enlist his father? he asked.  Abraham has always been reasonable.  Sometimes with the young men, it worked to treat them like they were still children.  And Abraham was a big man.   Mary shifted her hips.  David doesnt worry about his father, Bishop.  Hes too much for that now.   Too much what? Samuel scowled.  The other men seemed as perplexed as he was.  What do my bruders think?  Go think somewhere e Katie looked at the opening.  Oh, here he is.   Samuel saw another shadow in the cave opening.  Davids head appeared first, followed by the rest of him.  He wore no hat, and his beard was completely gone.  His pants were still dark, though his white shirt was missing the top three buttons.  The top of his chest was exposed.  He wiped his mouth as soon as he straightened, drew a breath.  What do you want?  David, Samuel said, what has bewitched you? Why do you leave a wife at home and come here to associate with these he indicated the sistersmarried women.  And all while their husbands are sick?  Oh, theyll be better, Mary said, fanning a hand.  Dont have anxiety over that.  Everyone will be better.   Ya, much better, Katie said, smiling.  Much, much better.   Samuel sighed.  Such disrespect, bruders.  We never shouldve come.  This ship  This ship is excellent, Sam, David said.  Incredible.  We need a ship like this.   Sam?  The sisters giggled together.  The places we could go, David.  Mary put out a hand to stroke Davids hair.  The people we could meet.  First says there are hundreds of planets.  Billions of humans.   David kissed her hand.  No one goes hungry.   Samuel shook his head.  What has brought you to this, David? You openly defy the Ordnung? He held his hands open.  Please, son, come back to us.  We can talk this through.   David chuckled.  Talk? Seems thats all you do, old man.  All my life, you talk.  You scold, you warn.  He took a deep breath.  Smell that? It is freedom.  And Im loving it.   Again, the women laughed.   James crossed his arms over his stomach.  You are asking to be shunned, David.   David laughed louder.  Shunned? He raised his arms, pivoted on his hips.  Look around, donkey.  Ive shunned myself.  More laughs.   When the laughter died down, Samuel heard a new sound.  It was so soft and low, he was surprised his old ears could hear it.  But there it was.  An injured moan from somewhere behind the boxes.  Within Davids new world.  What is that? He took a bold step forward, toward the opening.   Never mind that, David said.  Its one of the animals.  He indicated Mary.  She has a pet or two.   So youve stolen animals too? Mark said.  Your father will be disappointed.  Im disappointed.   Father is sick, David said.  For now.  But hell get better.  They always do.   Samuel glanced at James, who only shrugged.  If Abraham was sick, he hadnt heard it.  Samuel wanted to do something more here, but the Scripture warned that there were times to shake the dust off ones boots and move on.  With David, it was nearing that time.  They would alert the family and the other elders, but shunning was a foregone conclusion now.  For the sisters, as well.   Samuel found himself gripping his chest.  Holding the pain in.  It was an epidemic! How many more would they lose?  Are you all right, brother? Mark asked.   Samuel just stared at the floor, breathed a silent prayer.  I am fine, he said then.  But both hands crossed his chest as if he were keeping his innards contained.  He motioned toward the end of the row.  Slowly followed the others toward the way out.  The path of light.   Yes, it is time to go, old men, David said from behind him.  Well find our own way from here.       21    Seal felt suddenly uncomfortable.  Like he was standing in his bathing robe at an awards ceremony.  Or as if he had just deleted the ledger containing the working man-weeks for every union employee on the ship.  Im not sure I understand, he said.  So you are like our passengers? A follower of someone long gone?  Singer shifted in her seat, then glanced at her plate while squeezing the stem of her glass with her fingers.  I dont think so, she said, finally meeting his eyes.  I mean, thats not what I believe.   Seal shrugged.  Well, I cant claim to be an expert.  I let you do most of the research, after all.  A smile.  So why dont you explain it to me?  The differences? she said.  Im not sure I know them all.  The Amish do revere, worship, Jesus, yes.  As I do.   But he was a man, Seal said.  That died millennia ago.  How could he possibly be relevant here, today? Seal noticed that the wall image near their table had changed to a desert scene.  Cactus and a snake slowly sidewinding his way across a dune.  Interesting.   Singer smiled.  Well, yes, He did die.  But Christians believe He didnt stay that way.  Christians believe He came back to life.   And the Amish believe that too?  Singer nodded.  Yes, they do.  From what I understand.   Seal sniffed but not disrespectfully.  Singer was an asset to the ship, obviously.  It was profitable to hear her out, no matter how crazy she sounded.  So why dont you wear the dresses? he asked.  The bonnets?  I wear dresses on occasion.   Obviously, Seal blushed.  You know what I mean.   Another smile.  I do, sorry.  A pause.  Okay, there is a verse that says Religion that is pure and undefiled, is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world.  The Amish take the latter portionto remain unstainedto what I think is an extreme.  They stay away from everything that non-Amish do.  Like using powered vehicles or scraddleboxes.   But they are still okay being here.   Survival requires flexibility.  Singer speared a bite of her meat substance with a fork.  Held it near her mouth.  But typically their focus is on avoiding all technology that occurred following the invention of electricity.   Sounds arbitrary, Seal said.  They still live in dwellings like everyone else.  They still wash their clothing.  They use tools.  Use transportation, even though it is animal driven.  Certainly those mark steps in mans development, as well.  The wheel was a large change.  Why not forbid that?  Singer chewed her food.  Nodded.  Their rules, their ordnung, is arbitrary.  Though they probably dont see it that way.  Not to mention that their lifestyle overlooks other important verses from the Bible.   Seal felt his discomfort subside.  It was interesting, this talk.  Such as?  Well, for one, Christians are commanded to be in the world, but not of it, she said.  Most think that to mean that Christians ought to live beside non-Christians, but to live differently.  So they can see us.  Whereas the Amish withdraw and therefore cannot be seeds planted in a larger field.  She speared a green bean simulation.  Then theres the verse that Jesus gave his disciples before He left.   You mean before he died?  Singer shook her head.  No, after that.  After He rose from the dead but before He ascended into heaven.   I wont ask.  Seal sat back in his seat, straightened his napkin.  So, it was a final charge of some sort.  Marching orders?  Yes.   And what were they?  To go into all the world and preach the gospel, Singer said.  The gospel is the way to become reconciled to God.   Thats what Jesus taught?  Correct, but it is difficult to go out and preach to those who dont yet know the gospel if your whole planet already believes it, isnt it? And if its a place where people get exiled if they stray even one little bit from the official traditions.   Seal reached for his drink, sipped it thoughtfully.  Ah, yes, like our special passenger, Mr.  Miller.  I met him.  Very nice man.  Surprisingly smart.   Singer squinted.  And why did you at first doubt his intelligence? Just because he doesnt use cryomatrices or splice animal genes?  Seal frowned.  No, of course not.  It is just easy to overlook such people, isnt it? To think they cant because they wont.  But obviously, those are different states, arent they? Another sniff, followed by a smile.  Your man figured out his desk well enough to call me, after all.  A small rodent appeared on the walls desert scene.  It stopped, nibbled at something on the ground, and bolted out of the picture again.   Singer chuckled.  He called you.  Thats funny.   Yes, I think it was a complete accident.  Whoever showed them the room didnt give them any desk instruction.   Singer blushed, raised a hesitant finger.  That would be me.  I got so busy.  I guess I never made it back.  Sorry.   Seal smiled.  Well, he appears to be figuring it out on his own.   Strange that he would want to, Singer said.  But Jebediah is different by Amish standards.  Very different, it seems.   Do you think hell rejoin them?  Probably.  It is all he knows.  Plus, his wife is with him.   Yes, and pregnant, Im told.  Shell want the support.   Singer nodded.  Slid her glass slightly.  I suppose she will.  Probably wouldnt want Englishers involved, anyway.   Seal crossed his arms and rested them on the table.  So, what other differences are there? Between you and them?  Well, theres the rule thing in general.  The ordnung.   Yes, the rules that govern their behavior.  Dont all beliefs have such things? A code of behavior?  The Bible has commands, yes, but we dont generally look to those to save us.  She gestured, opening her hands.  To bring us into a right relationship with God.   What? So it isnt about behavior?  Not to save us.  But with the Amish, it is a lot about the rules.  Theyre never quite sure if they are okay, spiritually.  In the clear with the Almighty.  Thats why they worry so much about how they behave and look.  They are afraid that they wont make it.   Into the afterlife?  She nodded.  Yes.  Not all of them are like that.  But many.  Most, from what I can tell.   Seal started to feel uncomfortable again.  Singer was just as beautiful as shed been when theyd started, but there was another level to her that was so very outside his experience.  It was a lot to take in at one sitting.  Plus, he had ledgers to attend to.  A ship to administrate.  His communicator beeped, and he was happy it did.  He detached it from his hip.  Brought it up where he could see it.  Squinted.   A message from Mr.  Greels, he said.  I wonder what this is about.           Jebediah walked into his Englisher quarters, deep in thought.  He noticed that the excretorium door was closed, and there was a sound of motion from within.  He slowly walked past it to the row of overhead cabinets.  Two of the doors were ajar, so he pushed those shut.  He placed a hand on his hip and stepped deeper into the room.  Glanced at the desk, now completely dark.  Shook his head.  Frowned.   None of it was for them.  Not really.  Despite how he enjoyed experimentation, how he enjoyed learning about Englisher devices, he was a man outside his element.  He didnt fit here.  Never would.  And neither would Sarah, he guessed.  Hadnt she just finished saying exactly that, in no uncertain terms?  He was most worried about the young lady, Lucile, however.  Her behavior wasnt right.  Did her family know? The rest of the community?  And that Englisher, Congi.  Jeb didnt trust him.  Didnt like his nature.  If it werent for the Amisher pledge of nonaggression, he might find himself kicking in the mans door right now.  Interfering.  But it wasnt his place.  Especially as one of the shunned.  He had no place in anything community-related.  So what to do?  The excretorium door slid open.  Sarah exited with her hands near her nose.  Her eyes widened when she saw him watching.  She lowered her hands, smiled sheepishly.  I dont know how that washing device does it, but it comes up with some remarkable scents.  She raised her hands his direction.  My hands smell like theyve been dried in a summer breeze.  Smell them.   He walked closer and took his wifes hands.  Held them warmly.  He smiled and made a passing attempt at smelling them.  He thought there was a hint of some spicesaffron, maybein the scent.  It was hard to tell with the Englishers, though.  They doubtless had a different name for it.  Perhaps it was one of those spliced genes hed read about.  Then he remembered the young lady, Lucile, and his smile faded.   What is it, husband? Sarah asked.   Jeb held her hands for a few moments longer before releasing them.  I met someone in the hall.   Sarah frowned.  Was it that Congi man again? Ive seen him at the strangest hours.  You would think he was pregnant.  She looked toward the door.  I almost think he doesnt sleep.  Always pushing that cart of his.   Jeb walked over and leaned back against the desk.  Crossed his arms.  He didnt have a cart with him this time.   Well, Im sure he was on his way to get it.   Jeb shook his head.  I dont think so.  He recounted what hed seen.   The story brought Sarahs hand to her mouth.  Thats terrible, she said.  Unheard of.  What has happened to her?  Perhaps the bishop is right: This trip is a danger to the community.  He felt a twinge of guilt.  He glanced at their bed.  Covers were as smooth as the day theyd moved in.  Sarah mustve made it already.  Yes, she was usually the one to set things right.  And Im responsible.   Youre not responsible for the decisions others make, Sarah said.   Im not? I thought that was what our way of life was all about.  Keeping each other in the path.  So which is it? Am I responsible for others, or arent I?  Sarah laced her fingers in front of her.  Jeb  He removed his hat, tossed it onto the bed.  I know youre not happy here, Sarah.  And I know Im to blame for that too.   She shook her head.  Thats just emotion.  Im she looked down, shook her hands in frustration not altogether myself right now.  Dont take me at all seriously.   No, youre right.  You always were.  I was just being thickheaded.  Prideful.   She took a step toward him.  I dont know about that.  Ive never known you to be so.  I always thought you humble.  Truly.  Even if I didnt say it.   Jebediah gave a thoughtful grunt.  Said nothing.   We need to do something for that young lady, Sarah said.  Perhaps no one knows.   Jeb pushed up from the desk.  Difficult to tell.  Things change quickly on this ship, I think.  Perhaps no one knows.  Perhaps no one still cares.   I wont believe thats true.  She drew closer, laid a hand on his arm.   Jeb studied her face, attempting to read what she wasnt saying.  You think I should go to them? he said.  Find out whats going on.  He frowned.  Except I cant.  Ill be ignored.   Not if you went in the right spirit.   Jeb brought a hand to his beard.  Stroked it thoughtfully.  You mean in full repentance.  Regretting all Ive done to bring us here.  He shook his head.  Looked at the floor.  I do, but I dont.  There was no other way.  I truly believe that.   Has the sun exploded? she asked.   I wouldnt know that.  He glanced at the desk behind him.  Im sure theres some way to find that out He looked at her again.  But that would take more experimenting.  Or bothering someone important.  He managed to smile.  Should it matter?  It would be a fleece.  A way of knowing Gods will.   Would it?  Sarah brought her hands to her hips.  Studied him.  So should I go then?  Jeb shook his head.  I would feel better if you were here.   She brought a hand to her face and tucked a few loose curls into her kapp.  Looked at him again.   He felt another wave of guilt.  Frowned.  I will go, he said.   Sarahs eyes lit up.  Do you remember the way?  He indicated the desk again.  Im sure I can find it.  I found you food, after all.   She nodded.  Smiled.  And the captain.   Yes.  He retrieved his hat from the bed.  Perhaps that was one of your fleeces.  He positioned himself at the desk.  Very well.  A little more study, and tomorrow Ill go.           Samuel returned from the meeting with David to find his wife, Ruth, lying prone on their bed.  Her eyes were tightly closed and there was a sheen of perspiration on her forehead.  On Alabaster, she had often taken afternoon naps, but since entering the leviathan, that routine had necessarily disappeared.  There was much to plan for and discuss.  And still plenty of chores.  Clothes still needed to be washed.  Meals still needed to be prepared, even if there was some help from Englisher machines.   Samuel hovered over Ruths form.  Watched her sleep.  Her chest slowly rising and falling.  The hint of activity behind closed eyelids.  Her face showed the wrinkles of time.  Of decades of labor beneath Alabasters sun.  But she was still a fine worker.  A fitting helpmeet.   A soft moan escaped her lips.  Samuel moved closer.  Patted her covered head.  It felt strangely cold.  Strikingly so.  Like metal in winter.   A throat cleared behind him.  Deacon Mark.   Samuel frowned and turned toward the makeshift door.  Told Mark to enter.   I know we need to meet, Samuel said.  To start the shunning process.  Well get everyone together.  I just wanted a few moments to collect myself.   Mark shook his head.  I want you to see something first.  I went to check on Abraham.  I  Is he sick, as David said? Another case of the fever?  Mark nodded.  I believe so.  Yes, very sick.  His wife hasnt been able to rouse him.  A frown.  Deacon James is there now.  He didnt want me to bother you, but  Samuel nodded once, checked his wife again.  Hoped she slept well.  Rested from her labors for a time.  He made a cursory glance at the desk where his notes and Bible were still laid out.  Awaiting his attention.  A message hed all but forgotten.   He shook his head.  Turned to follow Deacon Mark.           Abraham laid as if in death.  His hat rested atop his bare chest.  His hands were clasped together near his overlarge abdomen.  His pants, though thankfully present, appeared to be soaked with sweat.  Drenched as if hed fallen into the Swaylo River.   His eyes were most alarming.  They were wide open and staring straight ahead.  Unmoving.   Samuel remembered when his father had died.  An aged heart had taken him in the middle of a bean field one day, hoe still in hand.  Hed given a lurch, slumped to the ground, and was gone.  Not a word, little movement.  Only distant eyes reflecting the sky.  That memory held more peace than what Samuel now saw.  Everything about this felt wrong.   Abraham blew out a breath, breathed in through closed teeth, and then pushed out another breath again.  Repeated.  Again and again.   The dwelling was much like everyone elses.  A double bed, a small table.  Two chairs.   Where is his shirt? Samuel asked.   Abrahams wife sat on the floor near a corner.  Her eyes were wide, clearly frightened.  A lock of salted hair escaped her bonnet near her brow.  Her fingers pinched her bottom lip.  Twisted it.  He just said he was heated, she said then.  And dreadful tired.  Pulled off his shirt and hat.  Dropped into bed.  Her eyes looked Samuels direction.  I thought hed overexerted again.   James was seated on the edge of the bed, near Abrahams feet.   Is this how the other fevers have been? Samuel asked.   James nodded.  Ya, more or less.  He shrugged.  This time will pass.  It always does.  There is no reason for fear.   Samuel nodded.  Our God isnt one of fear.  It is true.   Mark stood near the far side of the bed.  This isnt strange to you? His eyes darted between James and Samuel.  He looked troubled.   Ive seen wounds on him, Abrahams wife murmured.  On his neck and shoulders.  Like small round sores.   Sores?  James raised his hands in a calming motion.  They all get better, brothers.  A few hours sleep is usually all it takes.  Prayer and sleep.   And no Englisher knows of this fever? Mark asked.   Weve agreed to limit our interaction with them.   Any idea what causes it, though? Mark looked at Abraham again.  It looks terrible.   James frowned.  Weve weathered many a sickness in our day.  He indicated Abraham.  This is not the worse weve seen by any means.   Samuel remembered how hed left his wife.  How very cold shed felt.  Could she be affected too? He attempted to push the anxiety away.  Prayed silently in his head.  Yes, but the cause? he asked.   James sighed, placed both hands on his knees.  There are thousands of new things on this ship.  Who knows what he couldve gotten into?  But we were assured of Mark paused as Samuel raised a hand.   Now then.  We know better than to trust Englisher assurances, Samuel said.  But to be justis there any chance we brought this disorder with us?  James looked toward the dwellings blue wall, clearly staring into the past.  I dont recall any being sick.  He frowned, looked Samuels direction.  All were examined when we arrived.  By the  Samuel raised a hand again.  Englisher doctor, yes, I know.  So theyve both assured us of no danger and assured us that were well.  He brought a hand to his beard.  Gave it a thoughtful stroke.  Englishers fight wars all the time, were you aware? Perhaps this is a purposed thing.  Something they wanted us to contract?  For what reason? Mark asked.   For whatever reason they desire.  I know not their ways.   But it only lasts a few hours! James said.  Abraham will be up and around in no time.   Mark squinted.  Who else has gotten the fever?  James shrugged.  I havent kept count.  A few dozen, perhaps more.  Fifty at the most.   Fifty!  Abraham shot up in his bed, eyes wide.  His wife gave a frightened chirp and pressed a hand over her mouth.  James didnt move.  But Mark quickly joined Samuel near the door.   Still staring, Abraham did a slow pan of the room, his gaze stopping first on Mark, then on Samuel, and then to where his wife sat, her knees pulled to her chest.  The first will be first, he said.  The hunger unceasing.   Abraham? Mark said.  Are you well?  Abraham turned Marks direction.  Heavy eyebrows moved up and down, but no sound exited his lips.  Only a heavy stare.   Everyone exchanged looks, not knowing what to do.  Finally, Samuel whispered, Perhaps we should pray.  But before even a salutation could be uttered, Abraham laid back down, bringing the hat precisely back into place across his chest.   It is too late, he said.   What was that? Mark asked.  What did he say?  Samuel felt ice run down his spine.  He knew what Abraham had said, and it had the hint of prophecy.  He suspected it wasnt Abraham whod said it, though.  Not really.  He suspected something far worse.  David, the sisters.  It made perfect sense.   Each moment on this ship brought another shadow.  Another evil.  How many days did they have left? If he talked to the Englishers, could he convince them to just let them offanywhere?  He backed toward the curtain opening.  We need to get the community together, he said.  We need to form a plan.  All he could think of was his wife, though.  Put a stop to this.  To all of this.  Somehow.       22    The overhead bay lights were darkened now, simulating evening for the residents of Bay 17.  The circumference of the settlements was marked by self-lighting lanterns on polesEnglisher constructionas were the animal pens.   Initially, Deacon Mark had thought the lighting gave the settlement a warm and together feel, marking their boundaries while encircling them in light.  But now he wasnt so sure.  He felt, almost like Samuel did, that this technology symbolized an encroachment on their way of life.  An unknown element.  A cancer.   Regardless, he carried a lantern with him.  He had already bid his wife and children to bed.  He wound his way through the maze of Amisher dwellings.  He was surprised by how many he found outside tonight.  It seemed he was often tipping his head to one of their number.  All gave him broad smiles.  Acted as if it were the middle of the day.  It was very strange.  Another sign that things were different here, whether he liked it or not.   Still deep in thought, he reached the edge of the animal pens.  To his right he could see the elevated chair the watchers used at night, but surprisingly no one was in it.  Mark frowned.  He knew the young men could be irresponsible at times, get distracted by little things, but so far the routine had seemed to go well.  Of course, it was hard to be vigilant when nothing seemed to be happening.  They hadnt, that he knew of, lost another animal in days now.  There hadnt been any reports.   Except for whatever animals David and his friends were using for pets  The chairs emptiness still troubled him.  He adjusted his hat and walked the fencerow all the way around to the stained wooden seat.  He doused his light, set it on the floor, and climbed up into the chair.  It was more comfortable than hed expected.  The carpenter had done good work.  Even without padding, it felt relaxing.   Mark made a sweep of the pens.  Most of the animals seemed bedded down for the night already.  To his right, the sheep and goats were clustered into small groups.  To his left, the larger animals had mostly done the same.  The horses were all standing, however.   That was odd, in and of itself.  Yes, horses could sleep standing up, and typically did so throughout the day.  But for really deep sleep, they laid on their sides, with only a single animal standing watch.   Here all were standing though.  As if they were in the wild.  As if there were lions nearby.   Hmm Do they know something?  Marks chair rocked forward slightly.  He startled and quickly looked behind him.  One of the young men stood there.  Eli.  The person Mark was supposed to relieve.   You frightened me, Mark said.   Eli smiled.  My apologies, Deacon.  It was not my wish.   Mark shook his head.  I am not bothered.  Where have you been?  The smile broadened.  I like to walk, Deacon.  I cannot sit long.   Mark thought again of his encounter with David.  David and his group of women.  Marks eyes drifted to the right, toward the rows of packages.  Stay away from over there, he said, nodding.  When youre walking.   Eli looked that direction, smiled.  Theres nothing over there but boxes, Deacon.  Nothing that will hurt us.  He patted the back of the seat.  I can take my post back now.   Mark shook his head.  No.  Your shift is over, Eli.  You can go back to your home.  Find some sleep.   Eli chuckled, loud enough that Mark winced.  I dont mind, Eli said.  I can wait for the next man.   Mark rested his elbows on his knees.  Im the next man.  Figured it was time I took my turn.  Shouldered some of the burden.  Mark noticed movement along the exterior of the bay beyond Eli.  A group of people walking past the edge of the settlement.  They followed the wall of the bay.  He frowned.  Now whatre they doing?  Eli didnt look.  Only smiled.  People walk a lot these days, Deacon.  People get bored.  Not as tired.  Lonely.   Mark watched as the group followed the bays wall, walking in a cluster.  They slowly drew even to where he and Eli stood, and continued on.  A few young women looked his way and smiled.  So this happens every night? he asked.   Eli shrugged.  Most nights lately.   Mark continued to watch them.  And where do they go?  Eli made a non-specific hand wave.  Generally, they go all over.  Circle round the pens He smiled, looked at Mark.  Other places.   Outside the bay, you mean?  Eli shrugged.   Marks stomach flipped.  Going outside the bay meant encountering the Englishers, and more communication with the Englishers was not what they needed.  At least, that was what Samuel taught, and when it came to obedience to God, he was usually right.  Samuels leadership had taken them through many hard spots over the decades.   Eli watched Mark as if still waiting for him to exit the seat.   Im not leaving, Mark said.   Another shrug.  Thats fine, Deacon.  I may just walk around some more.  He flipped his head casually toward the other walkers.  Maybe Ill join them.   Mark squinted.  Now why would you do that  Eli only smiled at him and started walking toward the group, which was now very close to the far side of the pens.  The place where the storage boxes were stacked.   Davids place.           EARLY MORNING    Greelss obsession with the female scientist pulled at him.  Even though there were other responsibilities, other things he should be taking care ofthe issue with Congi, for instancestill his ice princess beckoned him.  He couldnt help himself.  She was the one thing in his life that was truly beautiful.  Untarnished and pristine.  Like virgin snow on a mountainside.   Hed lost track of how much time hed spent with her.  Even now as he reclined in his apartment alone, he found himself thinking about her.  Desiring her.   But he should be sleeping.  His shift would start in only a few hours.  He sprawled on his bed with both feet dangling over the sides.  His coverings were in a heap around his midsection.  He stared up at the blue ceiling.  The interior lights were on, but dim.  And even though modern tech should make it impossible, one of the lights seemed to have a slight flicker.  Hed watched it for hours, and it clearly was different than the rest.  Clearly pulsated.   He scowled at that.   Finally, he swung himself so his feet hovered over the floor.  He wiped his face.  Yawned and got out of bed.  The bed creaked as he stood up.  That shouldnt happen either.  No portion of the bed should allow for creaks.  There were no moving parts, no springs.  Creaks had been engineered out.  He sniffed.  Shook his head.   Something in the ship was deeply wrong.  He knew it.   Greels had never been a fan of superluminal flight anyway.  Any process that was able to accelerate matter faster than light was prone to side effects.  It just couldnt be any other way.  There were Guild storieslegends passed downabout objects and people being misplaced during slip travel.  Personal items shifting slightly.  People finding themselves in places they didnt remember coming to.  Faucets dripping.   Those were just stories, obviously.  Yet on the micro level, Greels thought there might be some truth to them.  Things were never the same in transit.  Some settling may occur, as the shipping warning said.   Then there was the fog outside.  He wasnt a big fan of that either.  He could sense it, even when he couldnt see it.  Only two crewmembers regularly saw it, and those guys were damaged.   Greels looked around the room.  Saw the clothes in heaps.  The half-finished bottle of found splic-ahol on his desk.  Stacks of broken harnesses and worn gloves.  The stuff his crew used during a typical load or unload.  All mundane and meaningless.   He picked up a pair of approved pants, held them up to check for any noticeable spots.  Then he gave them a heavy shake and put them on.  He repeated the process with his shirt, smoothing it down his chest and stomach after he was done.  He picked up his communicator, strapped it to his hip, and exited into the hall.   The hall lights were dimmed too.  No flicker, but dimmer than daytime nonetheless.  That part was normal.  A bit of nighttime simulation.  People needed that, they said.  Needed the routine.   The hallways walls were white with dual blue pinstripes down the middle.  Greels sort of despised the stripes.  He thought they were subtle reminders to increase his speed.  And he hated that.  Corporate interference.   He walked to the end of the hall, turned left, walked another hall, reached a short, yellow slideway.  He entered and rode it to the next floor up and stepped off.  He paused in the landing and briefly considered taking the slide all the way to the main slides and then to her, but he shook his head.  Decided to scrounge for food instead.   This hallway had red stripes instead of blue.  Still annoying.  The Union Caf was ahead, though.  So he pressed on.   The entire floor was generally a storage level.  There were a few rooms for crewmembers near the slides, indicated by nametags next to the entry pads, but after that there were just solid doors on either side.  After three minutes of soundless walking he noticed one of the storage doors ahead was ajar.  Another regulation breakdown.  He frowned.   Most of these storage rooms had nothing in them that people would want to steal.  Typically, they contained only food component items that were tasteless without proper processing in the cafeteria.  But a few rooms held product loads for the food machines around the ship.  Someone might steal them.   People seemed hungry this trip.  Slip travel would do that to you, though.  Monotony.   Greels drifted toward the open door and raised his hand to the level of the control pad, intending to quickly close it as he walked by.  He heard something thena human soundfrom inside.  Almost like muffled speech.   He paused.  It wouldnt be the first time hed discovered an amorous couple in a storage room.  These smaller areas were favorites for that sort of unlicensed activity.  Less surveillance than the larger bays.   He shook his head.  Why couldnt people just keep it in their rooms, where there was no chance of getting caught?  He chuckled to himself.  Then again, I talk to a woman in a box.   Greels brought his hand to his face.  Gave it a hard wipe.  Shook his head and took a few steps forward.  Another sound, but distinct this time.  Like something had been dropped or upset.   He stepped back to the door and worked the control pad to open it completely.  An off-duty interlude was one thing, but destroying company supplies? That had to be dealt with.   This storage room was larger than hed guessed it would be.  He could see at least a dozen rows of shelving facing him, plus two longer perpendicular shelves that ran along the side walls.  In front of those were narrow spaces.  Walkways that presumably went all the way to the back of the room.   Every shelf had items missing or disturbed.  Boxes were scattered over the floor.  All were mashed and heaped, but not necessarily opened.  Like kids had been playing in here.   The only people who had kids onboard were the Amish.  It made him despise them even more.  Cant they keep track of their children? Tie them up at night or something?  He clenched his fists and carefully stepped inside.  He moved to the rightmost walkway, tiptoeing around the mess as he went.  He didnt want to give any warning to the intruders.  He wanted them as frightened as they could be.  Wanted them to wet themselves with terror, bolt away screaming.  He passed one row of shelves and then another.  With each step, he was conscious of the mess, of the disruption that had been caused.   Anger.  He felt real anger.   He thought of his girlfriend.  Of her peace within the cryomatrix.  Her beautiful face.  The image soothed him a little.   But he was still angry.   Another sound, a groanclearly female.  Greels stopped again.  So the intruders werent kids, after all.  The fire inside increased.  He didnt care if it were the captain himself  It wouldnt be the captain, would it? Not out here.  Greels had seen him making eyes at that Singer chick.  Figured that was why hed put her in charge of the Amish anyway.  To try to soften her a bit, get her to be more agreeable toward him.  Though he didnt think much of the structure the captain represented, he didnt mind him as a person.  He was an alright guy.  And he couldnt blame Seal for pursuing Singer.  She was pretty enough.  Smart enough.   It hadnt been her voice hed heard, though.  Couldnt have been.   Greels shook his head.  Tired.  Getting tired.  And hungry.   Better to just get this over with.  Get on with my life.  He plodded ahead, not worrying about what noise he made.  Whoever was in here needed to clean this up and then get out.  Ship regs, and all.  He was the loading supervisor, not a janitor.   He reached the last row of shelves.  From here he could see, amid the chaos of wrecked packages, two people.  The light was dimmer here but bright enough to make out some detail.  There appeared to be a woman prone on the floor and a short man bent over her.  Greels nearly turned away with embarrassment, but then he realized both people were fully clothed.  There was an obvious intimacy to their posture, but not indecently so.   The woman moaned again.  Greels squinted.  Took a step closer.  The back of the mans head looked subtly familiar.  Jet dark hair.  The woman, he had no idea.  All he could see were pants-covered legs.  Strangely, the pants seemed cut in a few places.  Not torn.  Cut.  Or maybe bitten.   Weird style of dress, regardless.  Not regulation anymore.   As for the man, he was dressed okay.  Could have been someone from Greelss own department, actually.  Short of stature, though.  Not a loader.   Greels cleared his throat.  You two have made a big mess in here, he said.  I know these slips get boring, but  The man sat up and turned to look at him.  Greels staggered backward with surprise.   It was that intern kid.  The one hed tried his best to ignore.  His face was wet, hair dripping in front of his eyes.  And his expression was visceral, almost hateful.  His mouth opened in a mockery of a smile.  His teeth became visible, but they were darkened.  Coated in something.   In fact, Greels realized, the young mans lips were coated with something too, making them seem larger than they actually were.  Something dark.   Something red.   Greels found himself holding up his hands defensively.  What is going on here? he asked.  What have you done to her?  The young interns eyes widened, making them seem unnaturally large.  His mouth widened too.  And he hissed.   What the flame? Greels tried to think.  Tried to remember the interns name.  He snapped his fingers when he finally got it.  Foley!  Another hiss, and a full turn in his direction.  The young man repositioned himself but remained crouching.  Suddenly he didnt seem so small and scrawny to Greels anymore.  He seemed sort of dangerous.  Threatening.   Greels full anger returned.  He could partially see the young woman now.  He didnt recognize her, which probably meant she was from the front of the ship.  The offices.   Foley shouldnt have gone up that way at all.  Didnt have clearance for it.  His planetary assignment mustve gone to his head.  Made him feel more important than he was.   The young lady moaned again.  Greels felt a little better at that.  She was alive, at least.  But the blood  Greels remembered his communicator.  He grabbed it and brought it near his face.  Im calling security, Foley.  You can bid your career  Foley roared and leapt at him.       23    Morning found Jeb grateful.  Primarily because hed brought a writing utensil with him onto the ship.  He couldnt for the life of him find anything in their room that could be used for simple writing.  Nor anything to write on, for that matter.  Such a large desk, and not a single thing to write with or on? How very strange.   Hed managed to find a bit of torn wrapping material from one of their packages, though, and that was enough.  Using it and his graphite marker, he constructed a rudimentary map of the ship.  Enough that he could find his way first to the nearest short slide and then up to one of the major slideways above.   What Jeb hadnt found, though, was validation.  Sarahs fleece.  For all his mining of the desks wonders, hed seen little regarding Alabasters sun, aside from a few cryptic descriptions.  Words and phrases that meant nothing to him.  He took some comfort that they were all written in bright red letters, though.  That had to mean something.   As he stood waiting to enter the slide, he thought for a long moment if there was something he was supposed to do before stepping on.  Some way to alert other travelers, or even stop the thing so he could step on.  But after watching it move for a few moments, he realized it slowed enough that he shouldnt lose his footing, so he gave it a try.  He felt a bit of unease at the sudden speed change, but after regaining his balance, he smiled to himself, nodded, and stood tall again.  He eventually even brought his hands together in front of himself and attempted to relax.  Like he rode these things all the time.   The Lord was with him, even here.  Away from his home planet.  Outside the community.   He watched the transparent tube as it moved by him on all sides.  It appeared seamless.  Light, yet obviously strong.  He wanted to touch it, but he was fairly certain that was unwise.  The rails that moved along with the slide seemed to be in place partially to discourage such an action.   He took his eyes away from the tube and looked at the smaller bays to his right.  They seemed to be filled to capacity.  Rows and rows of boxes, all stacked neatly.  Doubtlessly filled with things he couldnt even imagine.  Why did Englishers need so many things? Was there no end to their appetite?  He was reminded of his wife.  Eating for two.  Now there was an appetite that was justified.  He hoped she would be alright on her own for as long as it took him to do what he had to do.   Jeb felt a twinge of wrongness to his goal.  Part of himhis sinful self, perhapsdidnt want to renew fellowship.  Not if it meant voicing repentance for something he thought right.  Plus, it would mean giving up their quarters.  And though they didnt belong, didnt really understand any of it, there was a portion of living there that was akin to exploring a new section of a forest on Alabaster.  A bit dark, a bit frightening, but also filled with unexpected delights.   Doubtless, there was sin in that, as well.   Jebediah saw signs for upcoming stops.  Frowning, he took out his map and held it up to get the full benefit of the overhead lighting.  The next stop should be the right one.  Or close enough, he hoped, that he could walk.  He determined to get off the slide, regardless.  Though he felt fine now, he worried that the slides motion would eventually make him ill.  It was no buggy ride.   He perceived himself slowing down.  There was a brightly lit banner ahead listing bay numbers.  The number range seemed right: all the odd bays over eleven.  The settlement was in seventeen, of that he was certain.  He nodded to himself again.  Put a hand up to steady his hat, and at the place where the rails disappeared, stepped off onto the landing.   He found an elderly Amisher woman standing there, as well.  It appeared she was waiting for the slide.   Jeb tipped his hat, studied her.  She was in a standard community dress and bonnet, except the colors were all wrong.  Not a light shade of blue or grey, as they should be, but bright scarlet.  Material she mustve dyed for herself special.   Morning, miss, he said, smiling.  He wondered if she might be a bit addled.  Hed seen strange behavior in the elderly before.  And with the added stress of their surroundings, who knew how it would affect an old mind.   The woman gave him a tooth-filled grin.  Though greying, she was surprisingly youthful in appearance.  And her teeth were quite white and straight.  Uncommon.  Not like an old ladys teeth at all.  Plus, what was she doing here? About to get onto the slide? Alone.  In red!  Are you lost? he asked.   Jebediah Miller? she said.   He squinted.  He didnt recognize the woman.  That wasnt altogether unexpected.  There were some smaller communities aboard.  He tipped his head again.  The same.  And you are?  Hanna, she said.  Hanna Overmeyer.  She continued smiling and backed into the slideway.  She watched him as she slid away.  Smiling.  Bright red.   Jeb shook his head.  Added her to the list of things to ask about when he arrived.  He noticed the doorway marked Exit and walked through.           Bay 17 had two entrances from this direction: a large sliding door and a smaller single-person door.  Neither was open when Jebediah arrived.  Both were painted dark blue against a lighter blue wall.  There were no locks, however, and the security on both doors had been deactivated.  Or so theyd been told.  The presence of humans in the bay meant the doors had to be accessible at all times.  Safety reasons.   Jeb suspected that someonea child, perhapswould be stationed on the other side to answer his knock, though.  He walked to the smaller door and tapped on its surface.   No response.  He moved closer and tapped again.   The door creaked slowly open.  There was a movement of air, and immediately Jeb noticed the scent of farm animals.  It was nearly overwhelming, even for someone accustomed to such smells.   Abrahams son Jonathan sat on a rocker just inside the door.  A few buttons were missing from his shirt, and the brim of his hat was rolled up all the way around.  Worse: There was the beginnings of a mustache on his top lip, as well.   Are the razors all dull? Jeb asked.   The boy smiled.  Clapped a hand on Jebediahs thigh.  Herr Miller! Youve returned!  Jeb frowned, searched the area inside the door.  The young man was the only one nearby, but Jeb could see lots of community folk near the settlements edge.  It was the first time hed seen the rows of blue dwellings up close.  They werent as uniform as hed expected.  Some had odd objects hanging on the outside walls: everything from rakes to quilts to kitchen utensils.  None of them looked particularly right.  Nor did the people he saw.  There was more color than there should be in everyones clothing.  More individuality.   What had happened here?  Jeb felt emptiness form in the middle of his stomach.  A dread deeper than hed expected for having been exposed to the group again.  He contemplated turning back.  Returning to his room with Sarah.  Maybe just sending a message back.  If their desk could contact anyone here.  Which, of course, it couldnt.   You look lost, Herr Miller, Jonathan said.  What are you here for?  He couldnt take his eyes off those nearby.  The lack of uniformity.  What had happened to the elders since hed been away? Certainly they wouldnt allow all this.  Was the whole settlement in Rumspringa?  He glanced at the young man, who now seemed to be staring at Jebs left arm and leg.  Smiling.  Almost dazed.   I want to see the bishopthe deacons.  Jeb felt a touch of emotion as he said it.  Conviction of guilt, possibly.  It would be good to be in communion again.  To feel absolved.  Even if it hurt his pride.  Even if things here were a little different now.   The bishop? Jonathan waved his hand in the general direction of the settlement.  Hes around.  Spoiling everyones fun.  A smile.  Do you like fun, Mr.  Miller? Do you like to drink?  Jeb clenched his fist.  Squinted at the young man.  Shook his head and pointed toward the nearest group of people.  I guess Ill find them myself, danki.   Jebediah drifted toward the settlement, but when he got far enough away from the doors he considered walking to the periphery of the bay just to observe.  To get the lay of the land.  Or possibly escape.  He searched the wall nearest him.  There werent many shadows there.  Not enough to hide in, anyway.  He still walked that way.  It would feel safer to have his back against something solid.  Something he didnt have to worry about.   He hadnt taken four steps before he saw a large figure move through the crowd: Abraham.  One person hed rather not see.  Not yet.   Abrahams head turned in Jebediahs direction, his eyes locked on, and he stared.   Jeb felt suddenly smaller.  Embarrassed.  Wishing to be ignored.   Abraham smiled and swam through people like he was a giant water sprite.  Large hands pushed and pulled.  Finally he reached the clear and held open his arms.  Jebediah Miller, he rumbled.  So glad youve returned.  Abrahams pants were black, but his coat was missing.  And his shirt wasbright yellow.  As he approached, his arms stayed in a position that made it clear he intended to embrace.   Jeb frowned and, holding out a hand, took a broad step of avoidance.   Thankfully, it was enough to deter Abraham.  His smile diminished and his arms lowered, albeit slowly.  It is good to see you again, my brother.   Jeb shook his head.  You shouldnt be talking to me, he said.  I havent repented yet.  Havent seen the deacons.   Abrahams arms finally touched his body.  He still exuded friendliness, with a smile threatening to show through.  But you will, wont you? he said.  Thats why youve come.   Jeb only nodded.  He glanced at the people beyond Abraham.  They had all stopped and turned to face him now.  They were quiet and expressionless.  Staring.  Hands folded in front of them.  As if they were a choir preparing to sing.   It was eerie.  These werent his people anymore.  Something was really wrong.  Like the young lady with Congi.  All out of character and out of place.  He felt like sprinting for the door.  Where is Samuel? he asked.  Mark? James?  Abraham made a sweeping gesture.  Oh, theyre here somewhere.  A shrug.  You are welcome to repent to me, if you like.  A glance at the crowd behind him.  Well all accept it, wont we? Absolve our brother.   Though hed practiced non-aggression all his life, at that instant, Jeb wished he had a wooden ax handle in his hand.  Something long and weighty.  He shook his head, again scanning the areas of the settlement he could see from where he stood.  He hoped he could find someone who would treat him like he was shunned.  Who would uphold their traditions.  I want to find them.  He started walking to his left, stepping away from Abraham, and toward the safety of the structures.   The crowd of people moved toward him, but Abraham subtly held them back.  Everyone stopped.  Jeb felt some relief.   Ahead was one of the long rows of individual dwellings.  There were heavy curtained entrances on both sides.  Most of these dwellings looked nondescript, normal, with no external decoration whatsoever.  That felt safe.  Without another word to Abraham, Jeb quickened his pace and entered the row.  He immediately felt shielded from Abrahams group.  He didnt look back, but he could sense them watching him.  Tracking him even through the dwelling walls.  He put a hand on his hat.  Ducked his head.  Walked faster.   Most of the curtains had been drawn shut.  Strange for early morning.  Hed expected more bustle.  People carrying pails for milking chores, morning washings, children being instructed.  Yet he passed by a dozen dwellings before he heard anything whatsoever.  Some groans and unintelligible talking.  As if someone were sick inside.  When he reached the far end of the row without anyone having come out, he decided to stop at a home and inquire.  He purposely chose the place three from the end on his left.  He walked to it and knocked on the frame next to the curtained door.   He heard a cough from inside, but got no response otherwise.  He glanced up the row in the direction hed come, almost expecting Abraham and his gang to be standing there waiting.  But they werent.  He shook his head and knocked again.   The curtain moved slightly, only enough for one eye to peer out.  The eye widened, and the curtain snapped shut.   Pardon, Jeb said, knocking again.  I need some help.  I need to see a deacon.   A few moments passed and the curtain opened a little wider, enough that he could see a face.  Deacon Marks face.  Are you here to repent? Mark asked.   Jebediah squinted.  I wanted  Because I dont think Samuel will see you any other way.   A nod.  I understand.  He checked the street again.  What has happened here? Why is there so muchdifferent?  Mark stuck his head completely out.  Looked both ways quickly, and then hurried Jebediah inside.  The room was nearly empty.  It had only a single wooden chair and a heavy patchwork quilt on the floor, predominately white with red and blue mixed in.  There was a Bible on the seat of the chair and a lit lamp next to the chair.  The light was unnecessary, the overhead lights were on.   Are all dwellings so simple? Jeb asked.   Mark glanced around the room, frowned, shook his head.  This dwelling was never occupied, he said.  Weve been using it as a prayer room of sorts.  A nervous smile.  Lately.  There are few places to be alone here, obviously.   Jeb frowned, examined the pattern of the quilt on the floor.  It had lots of arrows and a central starburst shape.  The arrows all pointed toward the star.  It seems like you are hiding out here, Mark.   Mark retrieved the Bible from the seat, and folding it into his arms, sat down.  Why would you say that? Mark stared at the lamp on the floor, shook his head.  Nee, were not hiding.  Withdrawing, perhaps.  Searching our hearts.  Waiting on Gods direction.   Direction on what? He pointed toward the door.  Has the Ordnung been changed? Because I saw  Mark shook his head.  No, it has not.  But the community He looked at the floor.  Rocked nervously.  It isnt what it was.  A glance Jebs direction.  Samuel says it is about the outsiders, about us being here.  But I dont think he believes that anymore.  I dont think he knows what to do.   What have you tried?  Mark squeezed his Bible between his hands.  Rocked again.  The usual, of course.  But there are too many now.  David has A head shake.  I dont know what he has done.  And there are more sick.   Sickness? I did not know.   Mark frowned, nodded.  A fever, yes.  Shakes, strange talk and behavior.  But it is brief.  Lasts no more than a day.   And many have become so inflicted?  Mark nodded again.  Dozens now.  But afterwards, they change.  They become like David.  Rebellious.  I believe it is connected.  It must be.   Jeb thought of their resident caregiver.  And what does James say?  Mark shook his head.  He thinks they are all fine.  That there is no correlation.  But there must be.  And the animals  Jebediah looked in the direction of the livestock pens but saw only the plain blue walls of the dwelling.  He had animals out there, though.  Horses, cattle.  Part of someone elses collection temporarily.  A lone mercy to the shunned member.  Animals that he and Sarah could survive with when they reached their destination.  They would need them.  As would their child.  What of the animals?  They are acting strange.  Mark looked into his eyes.  I have no proof that their numbers are diminishing, but I suspect they are.  That theyre being used somehow.  A pause.  I think were all being used somehow.   By who?  Mark shook his head again, gave his Bible another squeeze.  Rocked.  There is some connection here.  Something I cannot see.  I pray for the Lords guidance.  Sadness filled his face.  I have followed the Ordnung all my life, Jebediah.  As best as I can.  Why doesnt He answer now? When I need Him most.  When we need Him most.   This disease, Jeb said.  Has the Englisher doctor seen it?  Mark sighed.  Samuel has forbidden it.  And James  What of James?  Mark stared at the section of the floor where the arrow quilt rested.  There were visible indentations in it.  Where knees had repeatedly touched its surface.  He said everything is fine.  That theyd all be fine.  But obviously thats not the case.  I suspect A pause.  Another shake of his head.   What do you suspect?  That hes betrayed us.  There is no other explanation.  Ive seen him with the groups.  I watched them move last night.  And I saw him later.  He was with them.   Jebediah felt a wave of apprehension.  Like he was an animal in a pen.  Like they all were.  Where is Samuel now?  Preparing.  He wants to conduct service.  He wants to try to correct the course were all on.  To confront David and his group.  Mark reached for the lamps metal handle.  Brought the lamp to the right side of his chair.  Turned it.  Put it down.  There is so much sin here now, Jebediah.  I fear if we were to confront it all, there would be few of our number left.  All would be shunned.  A snort of derision.  And to where? Dispersed among the heathen?  Jebediah said nothing.  Just watched.   Mark looked at him.  My apologies, Jeb.  I didnt mean to affront you.  But you are no longer one of us.  A smile.  I should not be talking with you now, I know.  But sometimes it helps to involve an objective party.  Regardless of their state of salvation.   Jeb looked at the wall.  Solid blue.  So you feel I have lost it, then? My salvation.   You are out of fellowship, Jebediah.  No man is assured in such a condition.   Jeb fought confusion.  Did being out of fellowship with man truly mean being out of fellowship with the Lord? Were they really one and the same? Better to be in fellowship with all, as the Ordnung taught.  But they never had been.  Not really.  Alabaster had been a community unto itself, isolated.  Sowhat of those other worlds Jeb had been learning about? Wasnt that sort of isolation a form of being out of fellowship, if they had withdrawn from everyone who believed differently? Were they, Jebs people, called to go and preach the gospel as all Christians had been called, or were they not? Were they somehow exempted?  There was a sound of movement behind him, and Jebediah turned to see Samuel standing in the doorway.  His face was flushed already.  But when he saw Jeb, his eyes went wide.  Filled with the righteous anger the Scriptures talked about.  So the seed of our destruction has returned, Samuel said.  The Ninevite.       24    Samuel saw the startled look of the Ninevite and felt only pity.  It was a terrible thing to confront ones true self.  To see, possibly for the first time, the result of ones sinfulness.  Yet here they all were, surrounded by the results of this one mans transgression.  A string of poor decisions had followedsinful decisionsthat had led to a calamitous circumstance.  They were all trapped within the whale now.   Only by this same mans full repentance, by complete and heartfelt resolution, did they have a prayer of making it out.  Of embracing the light of Gods fellowship again.   Samuel said no more to their shunned member.  He just shook his head and looked toward Mark.  Young and faithful Mark.  It is time, Deacon.  We need to gather those who will come.  Before it is too late.   Mark glanced at the Ninevite and lowered his head over a clutched Bible.  What of James?  What of James? We should gather him too, of course.   Mark shook his head.  I dont feel that is wise, Samuel.   Our responsibility is to the entire flock.  That is why we were elected.  He straightened his frame.  I want everyone there.  Without exception.   Mark frowned but nodded slowly.  I will help call them.   Is that a good idea? the Ninevite asked.  From what Mark said  Samuel ignored the question, concentrating only on Mark.  And the task at hand.  We meet in the gathering place.   Mark nodded.  Rose from his chair.  He walked toward the curtain, and with a nod, exited.  The Ninevite remained.   Samuel turned to look at him.  He, at least, hadnt abandoned the proper attire while hed been away.  No indication of a mustache or blemish on his coat or pants.  He wasnt totally lost then.  Samuel hoped no one was, but he feared that this place was infested with real evil now.  The kind the Lord had cast into pigs.  Samuel was keeping that idea to himself for now.   Yet ever since Ruth had awakened He shook his head.  He didnt want to be alone with her.  She was not herself.   Samuel nodded.  Youve come to repent then?  Jebediah looked him in the eyes.  The idea has been much on my mind.   You admit that what you did was wrong? Sinful?  He brought his hands together.  Laced his fingers.  I admit it broke the rules of the Ordnung.  That it offended our sensibilities.  A frown.  But that wasnt my primary reason for returning.   Samuel felt sorrow again.  Fought not to hunch from the weight of it.  He instead looked away from the Ninevite.  Then I cannot talk to you now, he said.  Only when your heart is ready.  Perhaps if you attend the meeting.  Stand outside, of course.  Separate.  But listening.  A hopeful look.  You were a good man once, Jebediah.  Trustworthy and respected.  I want to see your honor returned.  For everyones sake.  Samuel pushed the curtain aside and exited.           Samuel left the prayer room, turned left and walked to the settlements edge, then turned right and followed the edge to the settlements far end.  There he turned right again and walked toward the one doorcomposed of two large curtainsthat was present on that side.   No one familys dwelling was large enough for everyone to meet in, of course.  So the Englishersspecifically, the female named Singerhad suggested the construction of such a room.  On Alabaster, such a large space would have been seen as wasteful.  Especially if it were to only be used once every other Sunday.  But here, under their current circumstances, he was forced to admit it made sense.  He was surprised that it took a woman to realize it though.  Clearly shed done her research.  Knew the Amisher custom of Sunday worship.   Yet were there no male leaders on this ship? Had Englisher society degraded to the point of being similar to the time when Deborah had led the Israelites? When military men like her General Barak were afraid to fight?  Samuel reached the curtains and pushed them aside.  They were equipped with ties, which he used to secure them back.  This would be an open meeting.  No one should be held out or excluded.  Like when Jesus had spoken on the mountain.  All were welcome.   There were rows of seats inside.  Uniform benches, really, with the addition of shallow backrests.  Samuel approached one of these and tested it by sitting down.  Though it appeared hard, there was a bit of padding on both the backrest and seat.  He frowned and tested the seat next to him with a hand.  He wasnt sure what the seats were made of.  It wasnt wood.  Doubtless some unnatural substance.  Machine made.  He looked at the ceiling far above.  Recalled the resemblance to a ribcage.  Shuddered.   He heard something behind him and stood, turned.  The first group of people entered.  A few of the older members.  Three women and two men.  They looked tired, drawn.  Doubtless weighed down by the cultural decline theyd witnessed.  Samuel approached them, welcomed them with a nod and a word of greeting.   Next came a pair of families.  One, the Blackwells, he recognized.  He remembered them having five children, however, not three.  Where were the other two? The second family was unfamiliar to him.  But they shared the same look of concern as the rest.  All found seats near the middle on his right.  He nodded at them.  Bowed his head for a prayer.   When Samuel looked up, Ruth, his wife, was making her way into the room.  She was wearing one of her usual grey dresses and a white kapp.  But there was a pink scarf around her neck.  She smiled brightly when she saw him.  He acknowledged the smile with a nod, but didnt return it.  Nothing that was happening now was worth smiling about.  She took a seat on the left side.  In the middle.   More and more people trickled in.  Samuel nodded, began to pace, pray more.  Soon the room was nearly half full.  The crowd remained quiet, though.  Contemplative.  That was proper.  He saw many bowed heads.  Silent prayers being uttered.  He was grateful for that.  He coveted the prayers.   Then things began to change.  It seemed to Samuel that the overhead lights dimmed, though it mightve been only perception.  Anxiety.  He wondered where Mark was.  And James.   No sooner had he thought it than James came into the room.  He wore no hat and no coat.  Only shirt, pants, and suspenders.  His shirt had been dyed light green.  In one hand was a Bible that he swung haphazardly.  He whistled as he moved up the central aisle.  He raised both eyebrows at Samuel, gave a little wave, and slid into a bench on the left.   Samuel tried to keep his emotions in check.  Fought off a scowl.  It appeared that James was a part of the problem now, as Mark had suggested.  Samuel felt sweat brimming his forehead.  He brought out a handkerchief and dabbed at it.  Slid the handkerchief into his coat pocket, where it would be close.   More people trickled in.  Samuel guessed that more than half had made it.  Mostly the orthodox ones.  Not those in need of discipline.   Mark entered with a couple of the other men.  Then his family entered too.  It was his whole family, it appeared, from youngest to oldest.  A strong show of togetherness.  There was a worried look on Marks face, though.  Not uncommon for anyone when thrust into a new experience.  Theyd had over a week of new experiences.  All of them.   Mark led his group to the middle of the seats on the right.  Guided everyone in and walked himself up to join Samuel at the front.  He leaned close.  Everyone has been told, he said.  Everyone.  But Samuel, I think  There was a commotion at the back of the room.  Through the curtains came David.  He was dressed in just blue overalls, which hed gotten from the Englishers somehow because the name of the leviathan ship was on it.  He had his arms around three women.  Two were the Yoder sisters, and the third was an attractive younger woman that Samuel wasnt sure who she belonged to.  He hoped she wasnt married, at least.  Not that it mattered to Abrahams son.   After their arrival, more of Davids people entered.  Some came in pairs, but more often they came in threes or fours.  And typically it was one male with multiple females.  An abominable mix.  Against the basic Ordnung teaching.   And the colors.  No two looked alike.  Bright reds, yellows, and blues.  Misshapen attire.  Individualism run amuck.  None were too salacious yet, thankfully.  But there was much more skin showing than was proper in public.  Bare arms and legs.  Heads uncovered.   Samuel felt ill.  These later attendees mostly took seats near the back on the left.  Many stood near the door, though.  The ambient noise increased a hundredfold.   Samuel held up his hands.  We need to be quiet now, he said.   Many in Davids group laughed.  Yeah, we need to be quiet, one of them said.  The word quiet was repeated a dozen times from different mouths, along with more chuckles and cheers.  The other side of the room, the side filled with mostly traditionalists, looked fearful and sullen.  Heads shook, eyes dropped.   Samuel straightened himself.  Raised his voice more than he was accustomed to.  For our God has not given us the spirit of fear, but of power, of love, and of a sound mind.  He emphasized the last phrase more than the others, hoping it would have an effect.  For by grace I say to you: Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment!  This brought some quiet, but the smiles from David and his group didnt diminish one iota.  Samuel closed his eyes, tried to focus and remember the passage.  So whether you eat or drinkwhatever you dodo it for Gods glory.  And dont cause anyone to stumble.  He opened his eyes again.  Saw the same disunity.  He pointed a finger.  That is why we are community, my brothers and sisters.  What made Alabaster strong.  And good.  We need to return to those ideals.   David was one of those standing.  His arms were still slung around two of the women.  Things have changed, Samuel, David said.  I see what it is all about now.  See so very clearly.  He searched the room, specifically looking at those on the right.  It will be easier if you come willingly.   Samuel cocked his head.  To where, David? To join you in your rebellious acts? By Gott, what has happened to you people? Do ye remember not your upbringing? He shook his head.  Nee, this needs to end.  That is why I called this meeting.  Away from the Englishers and their influence.  It is time for us to erect a memorial stone, an Ebenezer, just like the Israelites used to do for significant events.  To say that this is the time we became righteous again.  Where all outside sway was repented of and set aside.  Choose you this day whom you will serve! as the Scriptures say.   More giggles from Davids crowd.  Samuel felt sorrow and anger mix.  It never shouldve come to this.   It is too late for that.  David tugged at the straps of his overalls.  Smiled.  Weve started a new community.  And we plan to survive.   A community? Samuel raised a hand Davids direction.  Is that what you call this? You bring shame to your true community.  To your family.   David laughed.  My family is right here, he said.  And they fully approve.  Abraham, his wife, and Jonathan stood up from seats a couple of rows in front of David.   Samuel tried not to gape.  He didnt know how hed missed Davids family before, but then, they too were dressed in outlandish clothing.  They blended perfectly with the group of fallen souls around them.  Abrahams sleeves were off his shirt.  A green scarf was around his hat.   You too, Abraham? Samuel said.   It is the fever, Samuel, Mark whispered.  Those who get it always fall.   Samuel shook his head.  When has a fever done such a thing? he said softly.  Disease may lead to physical death, yes.  But to this? He straightened himself again.  We need to take ahold of this.  Is Jebediah outside?  Mark looked puzzled.  I believe so Yes, I think I saw him.   Go get him, please.   Mark hesitated, but then bowed his head and proceeded toward the back of the room.  Everyone watched him go.  A few of those on the left moved closer to Mark as if to hinder his exit, but David made a hissing noise and shook his head.  Mark exited the room unmolested.  David was still smiling though.  As if it were all a game.   A few moments later Mark returned, followed by an equally confused-looking Jebediah.  Samuel was taking a chance here, he knew.  But he suspected Jebediah was more ready for a return to fellowship than even he suspected.  And Samuel loved examples.   When the two men reached him at the front, Samuel held out both hands welcomingly.  Ah, yes, it starts with this.  Repentance, absolution, and then reaffirmation.  He smiled.  We are made for each other, bruders and schwestern.  To live together.   Mark again took a place at Samuels side.  Jebediah remained in front of him, waiting.   I believe it to be Gods timing that you are here, Jebediah Miller, Samuel said.  I believe that you have decided to rejoin us in precisely the moment He destined.   Jeb said nothing, but clearly he was thinking.  He was close to repentance, Samuel knew.  His heart was prepared.   We would like nothing better than to welcome you back to us, Samuel said.  Are you ready for that to happen?  Jebediah frowned.  As I mentioned before, Samuel, I have given it much thought.  I know my actions brought harm to our way of life.  He looked over his shoulder in both directions.  Clearly they have.   I disagree! David shouted, and was joined by choruses of yeses and amens from his group.   Listen, you, Samuel said.  By the name of Jesus, I command you to listen.   The group quieted, but only enough for David to say, Weve listened enough already.   Samuel ignored them.  Focused solely on Jebediah.  And what has the Lord brought you to?  Ive learned that much has happened since the founding of Alabaster.  Important events that weve had no portion of.  That couldve affected us, but by Gods grace, somehow didnt.   Samuel nodded.  Ya, the Lord takes care of His people, Jebediah.  We dont need to be concerned.  He has it in His hands.  I know you understand that.  Youve witnessed the celestial bodies and how theyre all kept in their paths.  A place for everything, and everything in its place.  And our place is to be together, but separate.   Jebediah squinted.  Well, is it now? Tell me, Bishop, where do the Scriptures teach that?  Was that a challenge? Here? Now? In front of the assembly? Surely not.  Surely an honest question from one who has been thinking deeply.  Samuel appreciated being able to pick from his scriptural garden.  The Lord said: You are the light of the world.  The salt of the earth.  He called us to be different from the rest.  Special.   Jebediah nodded.  Yes, but like the stars, light is only seen when it is surrounded by darkness.  And salt only tastes good when it is sprinkled on something else, Samuel.   Samuel sighed.  Perhaps Jeb wasnt as ready as hed thought.   David made a motion, and his whole group got to their feet.  Enough talking.  I think it is time we illustrate what community is all about, he said, smiling.  The group started to move toward the center aisle.  It wasnt clear whether they were attempting to leave or something else.  Perhaps they wanted to take the place of the speaker.   Sit down, all of you, Samuel said.   Davids smile broadened, and he looked slyly at the Yoder sisters in either arm.  Pulled them close.  My friends, its time.  And with that, one of his young women sprinted across the aisle, grabbed the first person she could findan elderly womanand put her arms around her.   At first, everyone who was watching, including the older woman, were surprised by the young womans apparently friendly gesture.  For many seconds they sat together like that.  Close and communal.  Others in Davids group crossed the aisle and sat with other traditionalists.  The community had never been one for public displays of affection, so there was some discomfort there.  But it was all so surprising too.  Unexpected but hopeful.   Then the first young lady smiled brightly, snuggled close to the older womans shoulder and neck.   And bit down.           Foleys leap was so swift and unexpected that it was all Greels could do to step out of the way.  His foot landed on a container and slid.  He stumbled into the corner of the room to his right, barely stopping before colliding with the front of the long shelf there.   He turned in time to see Foley recover, turn, and charge again.  Greels put up his left arm and met Foleys full weight with it.  Foleys mouth widened, exposing gleaming teeth.  Greels stabbed with his elbow and pushed with his body to get the young man off.   Foley impacted the long shelf to Greelss left, grunted, and started to stand again.   Greels sidestepped away from the shelf to his right, deeper into the room, and closer to the girl on the floor.  She was making no noise now.  Just lying completely still.  Dead? Unconscious? He didnt know.  He stooped to check.   Foley snarled and made another run at him.  Greels swung his right fist and managed to connect with the young mans chin.  This knocked Foley back a few feet.   He paused, took a couple of ragged breaths and smiled.  I dont need your permission anymore, Greelsand I am hungry.   Greels scowled.  Well, youre not eating me.  Foley was blocking his clearest route out though.   Very confident of you, sir.  Foley leapt again.   Greels grabbed a small container from the short shelf that faced him and threw it.  It made a heavy thunk when it impacted Foleys face.  Foley snarled and extended his hands, claw-like, and Greels let another container fly.  Another hit.  Foley shook that off and came for him again.   This time, the contents of the container Greels had stepped on earlier helped him.  Foleys right foot found the puddle it had produced, and his leg slid out from under him.  He again crashed into the long side aisle.   But immediately, Foley was regrouping.  Snarling.   Greels scrambled toward the exit, which was just a short distance away.  He could feel a slight breeze from the hallway.  He thought of the young woman, felt a twinge of regret, but couldnt think of anything else to do.  He couldnt help her, not with that maniac jumping at him.  Greels ran, stumbling and kicking, grabbing more containers off the shelves and hurling them to the floor behind him.   Foley cackled.  Now or later, boss, it wont matter.   A sickly sweet aroma enveloped Greels.  His head began to swim and he became very aware of every breath.  He coughed, waved his hand before his face.  He grabbed the side of the shelf on his right, pulled his way forward.  What was happening to him? He felt his left foot falter, fought to move the right one forward.  Locked his eyes on the doorway.   More movement behind him.  More laughter.  Greels shook his head again.  Plodded forward.  Pulled with his right hand.   First Congi gets sick and strange, and now Foleys a killer?  Greels looked up and felt a blast of fresh air from the hallway.  Have to move.  Make it one more step.  He summoned every bit of energy he had left.  Lunged through the doorway.  Somehow managed to hit the control switch.   The door slid shut.  He stumbled up the hall.   The slideway, he had to make the slideway.       25    No one was doing anything.   The right side of the church, the traditionalist side, just sat complacently while those from Davids group attacked them.  Sure, there was little violence in the attacks, but there was no doubt what was going on.  An attack.  An inhumane and selfish attack.   Jebediah found himself yelling.  First in shock and anger, then in desperation.  We have to get out of here! he cried.  We have to move now! He grabbed Samuel by the elbow.  Guided him down the aisle toward the front.  He looked back at Mark.  Called for him.   Mark remained completely dumbfounded.  Mindlessly watching the carnage.  Meanwhile, dozens of Davids peopleformer trustworthy memberswere now restraining and clearly biting the other members of the group.   There was little resistance.  And, of course, there wouldnt be.   We should not resist this, Samuel mumbled.  The Ordnung forbids violence in any form.   Jeb almost laughed.  Did non-aggression include sitting calmly by as monsters devoured your children? Your parents? Yourselves? He grabbed Samuels elbow and gave him a little shake, trying to get him moving in any direction.  But it doesnt forbid running, now does it?  Samuel continued to stare.  What are they doing to them? Im seeing blood  Jebediah turned toward the congregation.  He looked into the eyes of as many peopleas many real peopleas he could.  We all need to get out of here! he said.  Right now!  A few of the men on the far right side appeared to be waking up.  They rose from their seats.  And those with family began to move them out into the far right aisle.  They still looked lost, though.  Uncertain of where to go.   And there was a good reason for that.  The middle aisle, the one leading to the back exit, was partially blocked by Davids smiling, thirsty horde.  And they didnt seem anxious to move.   Dont resist an evil man! Samuel said.   Davids people knew they werent going to actively resist.  Knew they were like cattle to slaughter.   Jebediah felt sweat drip down his face.  He had to get as many out as he could.  And he needed to get back to Sarah.  To his future child.  He looked every direction.  There was a group of traditionalists forming to his right, behind Samuel and Mark.  But down the center aisle came the others.  Davids.  They were moving slowly but nimbly.  Some were even hopping up on chairs and stepping back down again as they moved forward.  Bouncing and happy.  Their dance was an odd swirling mix of bright colors and altered Amisher garb.   Flesh-eating colors.   The fever, Mark said.  I told you, Samuel.  Something about the fever.   Jebediah searched the exterior of the room.  Like every other dwelling in the settlement, there was no ceiling overhead here beside that of the bay itself, many yards above.  The makeshift walls were blue and completely solid.  Could they scale them? They were probably eight feet high.  With men lending a hand, he thought they could at least get the children and women out.   James moved up to join them.  This is for the best, my bruders.  If you dont struggle, it will be easier.  You will be protected.  Sheltered.  His hands touched together at the fingertips.  As if he were discussing a favorite pet or comforting a grieving widow.   Get out of the way, James! Mark said.   The outburst surprised Jebediah but didnt keep him from acting.  He zeroed in on the long wall to their left and moved that direction.  An extra bench was placed there.  They could use that.   I used to preach about a changed life, James said.  But I never actually felt it.  But thisthis is real living.   Deceiver! Jebediah took off his hat and tossed it at the startled deacon.  He waved the traditionalist group toward the wall.  Mark, if we use that bench, he pointed, we can climb.   Mark nodded, though he still looked conflicted.  Samuel seemed to be moving in the right direction, but he was stumbling along, distracted by something near the back of the room.   Jebediah turned to see where he was looking.  He spotted Samuels wife, Ruth, attached to a younger man.  Her lips to his neck.  Dont give in to the demons! Samuel called finally.  We must stand in faith!  Shes lost now, Samuel, Jeb said.  We need to move.   Nonsense, Samuel said without turning.  This battle is not with flesh and blood.  It is the Lords! He took a step in Ruths direction.  But Michael the archangel, when he disputed with the devil, did not pronounce judgment against him, but said, The Lord rebuke you!  The pronouncement seemed to have little effect.  Ruth didnt even twitch.   Samuel took another step, raised a hand.  I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!  This time, she did look up, but only to smile.  There was blood on her lips.   Finally, Mark seemed to fully engage.  Run! he shouted.   And the group really did begin to move.  The whole group, of which there were maybe three dozen, hurried toward the side of the room.  Toward the sideways bench.  Parents began to help children onto the bench.  Then pitch them over to the other side, escaping the large room.  Another group went toward the wall along the bench.  Started helping each other climb it.  Lifting each other up and over.   A few of Davids folk noticed their escape and started moving through the left-side aisles toward them.  Quickening their pace so as to not let their feast get away.   Jebediah looked at Mark, who was standing to his left, guiding people.  We need to stop them, he said, pointing.  Slow them down.   Mark looked crestfallen.  How can we do that?  Jebediah was struggling with it too.  Just when hed thought he was coming to some absolution, hed been thrust into a situation in which breaking the Ordnung seemed the only way out.  Hadnt Jesus said, Dont resist an evil man? There was no doubt that what Jeb was witnessing here was true evil.  I dont know, he said, shaking his head.  I He saw the rows of benches again with their low backs.  Can we move them? he asked aloud.  Make a barricade? But wasnt a barricade a form of resistance too?  Mark called to a couple of the larger men.  Immediately they all turned, and with a few words and hand gestures, they came to understand.  Together they started moving the nearer benches into a small semicircle to partially shield those trying to escape.   James was the first against the barricade.  Look at how easily you abandon your principles, he said.  Working with a shunned man.  Resisting our advance.  Hypocrites!  Neither Jebediah nor Mark responded.  They just worked to help the remaining Amishers out.  Davids group was snarling and cursing at the barricade.  Starting to climb it.  Jeb feared others would disengage, exit, and hunt from the outside.  He checked the way out behind them.  Only a few remained, along with the men who had helped.  He touched Marks arm.  Mark nodded, and together they hurried to the wall.   There is no escape here, James said.  Only delay.   Jebediah was the last one over.  He risked a last glance behind him.  A few of Davids people were over the barricade.  James stood still, smiling.  Beyond that, Jeb could see the forms of community members gripping others.  Glazed looks on the prey.  Smiles and frenzied feasting.  He thought of Sarah.  Of his baby.  Pushed himself over the wall.   Those who had preceded him over the wall had known enough to run for the exits, so there were very few waiting when he went over.  With Samuel in tow, Jeb followed Mark through the maze of dwellings.  They reached the exit to Bay 17 and were surprised to find no one blocking it.  Even Jonathans rocking chair was empty.   No one wanted to miss the feast, I guess.  Jeb said.   When they got through the bay door, Jeb made sure it was closed, and thenlacking any real knowledge of how to secure ithe kicked the control pad until it cracked.  He hoped that would help.   There was a large group of Amishers waiting.  All looking completely lost.  There were children cowering against their parents, wailing.  Many of the women were crying too.  Or tucked tightly against their husbands.   Uncle John bit Grandma! someone shrieked.   Marion, another said.  I left her.  Lost her  Samuel strode into the middle of the group but didnt say anything.  He just circled, eyes closed, and lips moving.  Praying?  What now? Deacon Mark asked.  Where do we go?  Jebediah pointed in the direction of the nearest slideway.  That way.  Ill show you.   Deeper into the belly of the beast? Samuel asked, suddenly active.  More intermingling?  Pounding started on the other side of the door.  Davids group had arrived.   Do we have a choice, Deacon? You would prefer to go back to your home?  Samuel pointed at Jebediah.  He is still not one of us.  We cannot follow him.  His heart isnt right.   Jebediah scratched the top of his head.  Remembered his hat was gone.  Frowned.  Im going that way, he said, pointing.  Follow me or dont.  Thats your decision.  But Im not staying here.           Seal stared at the videoconferencing image on his desk.  That it was Greels, there could be no doubt.  But the man looked worse than hed ever seen him.  His face was smeared with multiple colorsred, black, and green.  A dusting of white powder was present there, as well.  Mostly on his forehead and in his normally brown hair.  Made him look a decade older.   What happened to you?  That M-my intern! Greels stammered.  Foley!  Seal squinted.  You mean the short fellow.  Dark hair? Looks like a bright light would scare him?  Yes!  Greels was obviously back at his quarters.  Seal could see the pictures of bikini-clad women on the wall behind him.  Greelss eyes were shifting nervously, though.  As if he were checking the door.  Waiting for someone.   What did the little guy do?  Flipping attacked me, Seal! In one of the food storage rooms!  Why were you with him in one of the food storage rooms?  Greels looked to the sky.  I went to check noises, he said.  The room was open.  A sigh.  Does it matter, really?  Seal tipped his head.  The loading supervisor seemed to be having a run of issues with fellow crewmembers.  It happened occasionally on long trips.  Someone going strange.  People got bored and the brain chemistry got muddled.  Something.   Still looking at Greels, Seal reached for the lower portion of his desk.  Searched for the connection to the ships doctor.  He wanted Darly to hear this.  Hadnt she recently confined Greels to quarters? His desk began to flash as it tried to locate her.   So what happened? Seal asked.  Did he throw supplies at you?  No, I threw them at him.  Hes Greels looked away.  Shook his head.  I dont know what he is.  Insane! And there was a girl.  His eyes widened.  Shes hurt.  I left her! We gotta help.   A girl? You mean one of the Amish?  Greels scowled.  A woman, sir, sorry.  One of the up-front employees, I think.  Couldnt really see.   Seal felt a twinge of anxiety.  Human tragedy was always complicated.  Lots of ledgers to push around.  But to have the loading supervisor involved? The schedule could be affected.  Seal shook his head.  Whatever this was, it needed to be straightened out.   Darlys image became active on the lower portion of his desk.  He quickly stroked the edge, which would covertly signal her to remain quiet on her end.  To just listen.  He rested his chin in one hand.  Looked intently at Greels.  So did you fight with the young lady, as well? he said.   Greels cursed.  No, I didnt fight with the young lady.  Why would I do that?  He waved a hand apologetically.  I know it has been rough for you, Greels The desk indicated Seal had another call request.  This time from one of the service coms near the red slide.  There was no personal identification attached to the call, just the number of the calling com.  It was the sort of interruption he would typically ignore.  A misdial.  Or a malfunctioning com.  He would suspect children at play, if those werent all confined to one bay on the ship.   Seal frowned, watched the indicator flash.  We need to get security involved, then? he said to Greels.   Big time.  Someone with ropes.  Tarcs.  Something.   Ropes?  Or a big net.   Seal sniffed, finally pressing the incoming call indicator.  Another image opened up on his desk, bumping Darlys to the left side.  He squinted, because at first he didnt recognize who it was.   Seal? Greels said.   Seal held up a finger.  One moment.  He stroked his chin, frowned, and covertly muted Greels.  He brought the new call to the middle of the desk.  Enlarged it.  Studied the image.  He smiled and snapped his fingers.  Unmuted the new call.  Mr.  Miller! I didnt recognize you at first.  Youre missing your hat.   Jebediah touched his head, frowned, nodded.  Yes.  I seem to be lost on your ship, Captain Drake.   Seal barely hid his consternation.  Has no one instructed you yet? A head shake.  It gets harder and harder to find competency.  I am sorry.  Seal noticed that there were other Amish with Jebediah.  Traces of black hats and bonnets both behind and beside him.  A surprise.  Whos with you?  Jeb glanced both directions.  Were having some trouble in Bay 17.  Some of the community havechanged.  He frowned.  I have a portion of our group with me.  But Im not sure where to go.  We cant all fit in the room that was given to Sarah and I.   Changed? How many? Seal said.  How many are with you?  Maybe thirty.   And the rest?  Dangerously changed, Captain Drake.   Seal glanced at the wall picture of himself with the admiral.  All smiles and handshakes.   Dangerous? Hundreds of Amish? Loose on the Raven? He sat up in his seat.  Moved it closer to the desk.  Straightened again.  Okay, Im going to send someone to find you.  He started to look for Singers contact info, before remembering he kept it in his important heap on the left side of the desks void.  He wouldnt send her personally, of course.  Not if there was danger.  But it would be nice to see her face again, even if she was a bit of a religious oddity.  Their last lunch had ended awkwardly.   He touched her connection icon.  Let it begin to search.  He started to rearrange his desk in order of the time the calls had arrived.  Greels top left, Darly top right, Jebediah bottom left.  Singer bottom rightstill searching.   They had to get together on these issues.  Bring order.  He already felt the weight of the ledgers hed have to fill if there were casualties.  The process of reporting the violence would get involved.  He took a deep breath.  Let it out again.   He thought to check with the boys up front.  See how the actual progress was.  Getting the ship to Obelisk was most important.  He was hesitant to add another face to his desk array, though.   Soon.  After he got rid of one of these four.   Darly was still in quiet mode, he realized.  As was Greels.  He fixed that with another stroke of both of their image edges.  The desk rippled two directions.  Greels.  Mr.  Miller.  I have our doctor on the call with us.  I thought she would be a good addition.  He squinted at Jebediah.  Is there anyone with you who is hurt, Jebediah?  Jebediah nodded.  A few.  He looked quickly behind him.  But nothing life-threatening.  To be honest, Im a little concerned about our being pursued.  I managed to get everyone herewherever we are.  But, Captain  Youre talking to the Amish now, Seal? Greels said.  How are you talking to the Amish? Why?  Seal raised a hand, hesitated, shook his head, and put a call out for security.  The desk was getting fuller.  Singers image activated then.  There was a slight wave to her hair.  He smiled at her.  Held up a finger.  Theres a lot going on right now, Singer.  Would like your opinion.   She nodded.  Yes, Captain.   The security rectangle asserted itself, moving right atop all the other images on the screen.  Front and center.  And large.  The image was of a slight, brown-shaded young woman.  Reasonably attractive but not what he pictured when he thought security.  Regulations had changed a lot since hed first started with the Guild.   Sir? the woman said.   Seal frowned.  Read her the coordinates of Jebediahs group.  Asked her to send someone there to escort them.   And where should we take them? she asked.   For this he looked at Singer.  We need a place to temporarily put some Amishum He glanced at Jebediah, who appeared to be standing too close to the com now.  His face was very large.  Refugees, I guess well call them.   Singer nodded.  I can find a place, Seal.  Perhaps one of the cafeterias.   Excuse me, Darlys image said.  Why am I here again? Im sorry, Captain, but I have duties  Youre here because He scanned the images.  There are injuries.  Jebediahs group.  And Greels.   Greels scowled.  Im sore and a little spooked, he said.  But Im not injured.   It was quickly becoming complicated.  Too complicated.  But you need security, right?  Well, someone does.  The girl.   Seal put his hands up.  Okay, lets start over.  He pointed at the image of the Security woman.  We need two teams.  One to escort Jebediahs group to medical.  The other to go get Greels.  Get his story.  Go with him wherever.  He pointed at Darly.  You need to be ready for visitors.  In the meantime He pointed at Singer.  Singer will find a place for them to stay for now.  He stopped himself.  Got a sudden burst of clarity.  Wait, Jebediah?  Jebediah nodded.  Yes, Captain?  What is going on in my bay?  Another Amisher man, an older man, pushed in front of Jebediah.  Demons! Your ship is the storehouse of evil.   Seal sat back, eyes wide.  Excuse me?  Jebediahs face came in from an angle.  There is something wrong there.  We were attacked.   Attacked? He glanced at Greelss image.  Seems to be a string of attacks.  Lots of conflict.  He frowned at Jeb.  But I thought you avoided such things.   And dont forget the blood, Greels said.  Foley was after blood.  Drinking it.   Seal took another breath.  Held it.  Let it out slowly.  He looked at Jebediah.  Is that what you saw? Blood?  Jebediah nodded.   The life is in the blood! the older man said, now somewhere off-screen.  Seal thought he saw the top of his hat.   Seal cocked his head.  Looked at Darly.  A disease of some sort?  She shrugged.  I checked everyone when they come onboard, sir.  Even the Amish.  All clean.  Of courseI havent had any follow-ups.  Theyve been resistant to that.   I see.  But if not a disease, could it be something psychological? A reaction to their new situation?  Darly sighed.  Anything is possible, sir.  I would need to examine someoneone of these changed people to know for sure.   Seal nodded.  And we should have lots of them in Bay 17 right now, correct?  I wouldnt go in there again, Jebediah said.  It is dangerous.  Best to stay away.   Evil! the off-screen man said.   Seal sniffed.  With all due respect, Mr.  Miller, the Raven is a Guild ship under my command.  We wont be surrendering one of our bays to anyone, no matter how sick or changed they are.  It is a terrible precedent, business-wise.  He paused.  Well send in a security team.   The security womans eyes widened.  We only have a small group, sir.   Im aware of that, but you are armed.   Yes, sir.   Right, so get someone in there after you escort Jebediahs group.   Or, Greels said, they can just come with me.   With you?  Greels frowned.  Yes.  Foley.  I left him locked up.  With the girl.  The one who still needs help, remember?  Seal raised a hand.  Aha.  So it is all settled then.  He scanned all the faces.  Everyone knows their assignments, right?  All heads nodded, excepting Jebediah, who still looked a bit confused.   But how else would he be? He was Amish.   Seal smiled.  Okay, Im going to connect those of you that need to be connected so you can keep talking.  He swiped first Jebediahs and then Greelss face onto that of the security womans.  There was a spinning whirlpool as the images coalesced, then the mixture disappeared altogether.  He grabbed the image of Singers face and placed it onto Darlys with a final instruction for them to coordinate.  More swirling before the desk void became placid again.   Success.   Seal sat for a moment with his hand around his chin.  There was something else he was going to do  He snapped his fingers.  Ah yes, the bubble.  He found the indicator of the pilots area and activated it.  Waited as the desk ring flashed.   Ten seconds passed.   No response.   He frowned.  How strange.       26    In the end, they didnt use a net, but they probably should have.   It was as if Foley had been waiting for them.  Like hed somehow sensed their presence, despite them staying as quiet as possible.  Greels stood a long ways back from the door, but he warned the two security men to be alert.  Said they didnt know what they were dealing with here.  That the young intern was stronger than he looked.  Faster.  And had teeth.   To their credit, the others seemed to listen.  They stood in front of the door, dressed in blue with security displayed proudly across their backs, restraining tarcs in ready position.  But when the door opened, it was a young female that stood there.  Brunette, in standard Guild shirt and pants.  And she barely looked molested at all.  She even acted startled, bringing a hand to her chest.  As if a loud noise had somehow frightened her.   Wow, that was fast, she said.   The guards looked at each other, and then at Greels.   What was fast, maam? one guard asked.   She waved a hand at Greels.  Well, he said he was going to get some help, but I never thought hed bring security.  She looked behind her, where the storage room was still visibly in shambles.  We made a bit of a mess in there.  She blushed.  Mr.  Greels is such a passionate man  Greels scowled.  What? What splicer had a run at your code, missy? I dont even know you!  The guards looked at him again.  Lowered their guns.  So you were with the loading supervisor in here the taller of the two guards said.  Doing what? The second guard frowned and touched his hip, felt for his com unit.   Greels just shook his head.  She was on the floor.  Hurt.  Way out.  He leaned forward and peered into the storage room.  Dont pay attention to her.  To what shes saying  The taller one put a hand out.  Directed the girl.  Come on out, miss.  What was your name?  Candle, she said.  I work in accounting.   The guard nodded.  We should take you somewhere.  Talk this through.   No, no, no, Greels said.  He took a few steps toward the door.  I know what I saw.  They arent doing this to me again.   Doing what?  In that instant, Foley flew through the door.  His eyes flashed all directions, he smiled, and went racing to their right, back toward the slideway.  The girl, Candle, leapt on the taller guard, wrapped arms and legs around him, and bit into his upper shoulder.   Greels yelled.  The second guard fired once in Foleys direction, sending a blue pulse that impacted the grey hallway wall.  It crackled and diffused harmlessly.  A clear miss.   The first guard wasnt struggling with the young woman Candle at all.  He should be yelling, fighting.  Not standing there while the woman bit him.  Greels stepped closer and attempted to pry the gun from his hands, but the woman looked up and hissed, showing blood-covered teeth.  Long and pointed teeth.   Shoot her! Greels said.   The other guard hesitated, eyes flitting between the girl and the escaping Foley.  The girl released the first guard and climbed to the floor.  Moved toward Greels  Another burst of light caught her in the side.  She shook violently for a moment, then seemed to shrug it off.  She smiled and took another step toward Greels.  Raised her arms imploringly.  Darlingcome here.   The first guard mumbled and slumped to the floor.  The second guard watched him, clearly confused.   Fire again, idiot! Greels said.  Again and again.   The guard looked up, frowned indecisively, but managed to fire from the hip.  Once, and when it appeared Candle might shrug that off too, fired a second time.  Candle looked to the sky, attempted to step, but then slumped to the floor.   The remaining guard looked at his colleague, then at the girl, and finally at Greels.  Your intern got away.   Greels spit on the floor.  Shook his head.  He did? Gee, I didnt notice.   The guard bristled.  Are you insulting a man with a gun?  Greels waved, looked at the girl on the floor.  If the Amish are right, there are plenty more like Foley running around.  And I think I know where it all started.  He looked at the storage room.  Mostly just food in there.  Little that could be of use here.  Anyway, we only need one, and here she is.  But we need to restrain her somehow.  His eyes traveled to the fallen guard.  And him too, maybe.   The standing guard fiddled with something at his right hip, finally bringing out a fine translucent cable.  Binding cord.  He went to work on Candle, binding arms and legs.  He then moved to stand over the other guard, checking for a pulse at his chin.  I think hes alive, he said.  He might be all right.  A glance at the still-bleeding shoulder.  Nasty bite wound.   Greels shook his head.  Bind him.   But hes with us.   I wouldnt assume anything at this point.  He indicated the girl.  I thought she was dead.  Once.           Darly leaned against a counter in one of the medical offices two examination rooms.  Her current patient, Singer, stood fully clothed within what would appear to a casual observer to be a rectangular band of white cloth.  This band was supported by a seemingly delicate frame that attached to the wall.  The band and frame was all that was visible of the med scanner, the rest being integrated within that same wall.   The scanner started its diagnostic procedures at the floor and slowly moved up the entire length of the young womans body.  It paused awhile at Singers midsection, and again at her head, then with a small click it began to descend again.  When it reached the floor it folded into its surface, leaving little trace that the scanner even existed.   What was left was a nearly spotless white room.  The only decoration was the coiled snake medical pattern that had been pressed into the walls.  The floor was blue, of course.  As were the cabinets over the counter.  But the counter was white, which Darly preferred.  White and clean and controlled.   That was medicine.   Singer smiled at her.  So what did you see?  In her arms, Darly held her square medical pad.  The results of the test were already available on it, designated by a single green X in one corner.  She pressed it, and it swirled and grew until the test ledger filled the screen.  It listed rows of conditions followed by percentages and textual details.  Nearly everything here was green.  A cause for smiling.  Some percentages were more toward the red spectrum, but these were the ordinary genetic predispositions and the effects of aging.  Both were less prevalent than they were centuries ago, but not altogether wiped out.  Not yet.  Man was still mortal.   Wars had been fought to keep it that way, in fact.   You are fine, Darly said.  Above average for your age and body type.   Singer nodded.  You have the baseline you wanted, then?  Darly nodded.  It is good to check the scanner from time to time.  Against someone typical.   She heard voices from the waiting room outside.  A small commotion.  She exchanged looks with Singer.  Frowned.  Bobbed her head.   You think thats them? Singer said.   Darly clutched her med pad closer.  Im certain it is.  I can almost smell Mr.  Greels from here.   Singer didnt respond, only smiled and put out a hand indicating that Darly should lead.  Together they walked to the reception area.   The receptionist was standing, eyes wide with a hand at her hip.  With her were four menGreels, a security guard, and two other men who looked like theyd been volunteered somewhere along the way.  Possibly from the loading group, as they wore faded t-shirts and dirty pants.  Together they were carrying two incapacitated peoplea man and a woman.  Both late twenties to early thirties.  Both with visible signs of wounds.  Thankfully, the blood appeared to be coagulated.  They werent making a mess.   The scent of Greels was messing the air, though.  Plus hed outdone himself.  I thought you were bringing me only one patient, Darly said.   Greels grunted.  Where do you want them? He held the feet of the woman, while another man held her arms at the wrist.   Not the kindest way of carrying her.  Are you trying to pull her arms out of socket? Darly asked.   Greels looked at his companion.  Shook his head.  Neither of us are getting close to her mouth, he said.  Shes a biter.   Darly noticed the restraints that were around her wrists and ankles.  Decided not to ask.  She looked at the other patient, the man.  He was clearly from security.  Large man.  Appeared to be strong.  What happened to him?  Greels summarized the encounter with Foley and the woman.   All Darly could do was raise her eyebrows.  Greels had a knack for disruption.  Chaos.  She hated chaos.   She ruminated about which patient to look at first.  Bite wounds were always dangerous, especially from other humans.  Yet, in the unlikely event they were dealing with a new contagion  She looked at the receptionist.  Call two nurses.  Well take the man to room three and the woman to room one.  I want everyone to be extra careful.  Everyone should wear gloves, robes, and headgear.   Headgear? the receptionist asked.   Darly nodded.  Theyll find them in the hall closet.  Next to the bandages.  She waved a hand over her face and head.  It is a combination mask and hairnet.  Theyre antiseptic.  Made to keep microbes out.   She looked at the men carrying the guard.  Shell show you where to go.  She looked at Greels.  You two will follow me.  She turned to Singer, who was standing just to her left.  I want you to stay out here with the men.  No one leaves until I say so, all right?  Greels looked at the other men.  Scowled.  No one leaves? Weve got things to do, Darly.  Quotas of our own to meet.   Im sure your quota of quickfood can wait.  At least until I have an idea about whats going on.   One of the other men started to complain, but Darly just fixed him with an icy stare and a raised finger.  That ended it.   Four minutes later she had the woman patient in the same room that Singer had used.  She was reclined on a slanted examination table, one specifically designed to fit within the med scanner.  The womans wrists and ankles were no longer restrained, but she was strapped firmly to the table.  For her own safety.   Greels had been especially anxious about the restraints.  Only when shed assured him that the straps were more than capable of containing Candle had he seemed to relax.  He still remained in the room though.  Refused to leave until after the scan took place.  I have to know, he said.  Ive seen enough strange stuff.  You cant make me leave now.   Darly allowed it, against her better judgment.  He wore a blue robe and headgear now, after all, and those muted him.  Made him a little less Greels.  He helped her push the table into position.   Darly brought her med pad up to start the scanning process.  The young woman began to mumble and her head wagged slowly.  As if she were having a bad dream.  Then her eyes opened.   Miss Candle? Darly said.   Yes, Candles eyes scanned the room.  Where am I? Is this a med room? Why? I dont feel sick.   Greels coughed.  Dont start with the fresh and nice now, missy.  Ive seen enough of that.   Darly shot him a look.  Turned to the patient.  Were just trying to check you out.  See how you look on the inside.   I dont know why youd need that.  Im fine, really.   Darly noticed that the bite mark on Candles neck appeared to have fully scabbed over.  A quick healer? Strange, but not uncommon in a galaxy of gene tweakers.  She raised her med pad again.  Engaged the scanner.   Really, the young woman said.  You wont see anything.  Im sure of it.   The scanner went through its up and down sweeping motion, then folded back into the floor.  Greels watched the whole process intently.  Like a dog waiting for a treat.  He was even breathing hard.  That only made his presence more apparent.  Darly resisted scowling.   She waited for the results indicator.  After many moments, nothing had arrived.  She frowned and checked to see that the scanner was completely disengaged and stowed away.   What happened? Greels asked.  Do you have anything?  Not yet A green X appeared on her screen, and she smiled.  Ah, here it is.  She poked at the indicator.  It swirled, grew to fill the screen.   The ledger was completely empty.  All the percentages zeroed out.  She scrolled through the entire ledger again just to be sure.  Every line the same.  Nothing.  We just tested this scanner  Whats that? Greels leaned her way.  What does it say?  Darly shrugged.  Thats the problem: It doesnt say anything.  She looked at Candle, who was smiling innocently.  Lets try again.   I really want to go, Candle said.  I have responsibilities.  The scraddle is  Darly raised a hand.  It wont take a moment.  Im sorry.  She started the scanning operation again.  Again the scanning band ascended around the inclined table and patient.  Made its sweep, stopping in all the same places, and then returned into the floor.   The results came quicker this time: still nothing.  Darly shook her head and began to drill down into the individual elements of the report.  Typically, these would contain renderings of the patients internal systems and organs.  But in this case, there were only outlines.  An outline of a heart, a spleen, a liver, but insideall black.   Greels moved closer.  Attempted to look over her shoulder.   Darly turned away.  Thats privileged information, Mr.  Greels.   Im very uncomfortable with him being in here, Candle said.  Hes treated me so poorly.  After all weve meant to  Greels pointed a finger.  Stop it, you, whatever you are.  You know I dont know you.  And I only tried to save you.  From Foley!  Candle smiled without showing teeth.  Maybe I didnt need saving.  Maybe Im saved now.   I need to talk to the captain, Darly said.  Clarify some things.  She looked at Greels.  Youll need to go too.  Then to Candle.  Well have to leave you here for a bit.  Im sorry.   But I really need to leave now, Darly.  Im getting hungry.   Well have someone bring you food.   Id rather get it on my own.   Ill bet you would, Greels said.   Come with me, Greels, Darly said.  Now.           Darlys face stared up at him, and for a woman whose features were partially obscured by a blue mask, she looked very disturbed.  Nothing, sir.  I cant see anything.   Seal rested both arms on his desk, paralleling the edges of Darlys image.  Did you try another scanner? Seal asked.  You have more than one, correct?  Darly shook her head.  You dont understand.  I just tested that scanner, minutes ago.  It was working perfectly.  And Ive never seen one malfunction like that.  Come back with nothing? Not a single reading?  Seal frowned.  What else could it be, though? It has to be a technical issue, doesnt it?  She shook her head again.  I dont know.  I dont think so.  The patient seemed to know I wouldnt see anything.  She seemed to revel in it, actually.   Seal frowned.  Thats very strange.  Impossible, of course.   Yes, sir, I agree.  It is about as impossible as me standing in front of a mirror and not seeing my own reflection.  But thats what happened: The machine saw nothing.   Seal shook his head.  It seems to be a day for unexpected circumstances.   Why do you say that?  He reached up to scratch his head.  Frowned.  Oh, Ive been trying to reach the bubble for some time now.  Nothing.  Probably I should get out of my office and go up there.  Have a look around.  Make sure theyre awake.   Thats against Guild rules, is it not? Both of them out of touch?  Yes.  I try to give those two some freedom.  I know it is a thankless job, a lonely job, but  Well, I wouldnt go anywhere until we know what this is, I Darly glanced behind her.  Her move made it easier for Seal to see where she was.  He guessed it was the hallway outside the examination rooms.  Im sorry, but Ive left a patient strapped to a table.   Seal worked the side of his face with a hand.  Fought off a yawn.  You have other ways of looking inside, dont you?  You mean another machine? Because I told you I  Seal held up a hand.  No, I meanif were really in some kind of epidemic here, we need some answers soon.  We need to know what is going wrong so we can address it.   Yes, but  But that might mean that unusual procedures are in order.  You had some surgical training, correct? Aside from all your technical skills?  Darlys eyes widened.  You want me to cut her open? With a knife? Like some archaic  I assume you have other options for opening a body.  But yes, thats what I want you to do.   But shell refuse.  She didnt even want the scan.   Then sedate her.   Sir! That violates everything I swore  Seal waved a hand.  All superseded by Guild rubrics, which your patient, any crewmember, acknowledged when they came aboard.  We need answers, Darly.  Lots of them.   She only stared at him.  Rendered temporarily speechless.   It doesnt have to be too large a cut, does it?  Darly seemed to recover a bit.  Noprobably not.  No She looked down.  Well, it depends on what we want to know.   Start with diseases first.  Whatever you need there.   Darly nodded.  Okay, I can perform some discreet biopsies.  See what I find.   Seal nodded.  But be prepared to go further.   She shook her head.  Sir, I  It is for the safety of the ship.  And our schedule.  Thats whats most important.   Darly nodded.  Ended the call.   Seal sighed, sat back.  Looked at the pictures on his wall.  The awards.  One in particular caught his eye.  It said Gold Medal Decision Maker.  Hed almost forgotten about that one.  Forgotten when hed received it.  Probably for that time when hed found a way to reduce load time by beginning the process before they were officially stopped.  There were some union issues there, of course.  Some issues with morale.  Something.   The award surprisingly didnt seem important now.  Seemed almost undeserved.   He frowned and brought up the communication ledger.  Tried to contact the bubble again.   He waited.   And waited.       27    Jeb stood waiting near the communicator mounted on the wall.  On his right a group of Amishers sat along an exit stairway that led to a lower level.  The rest shared the small landing area with him.  Amishers of all ages and descriptions.  Young and old, male and female, predominately light in skin color, but not completely so.  There was still an occasional outburst or sob over what theyd experienced, spoken grief for lost family members.  But most were now quiet, staring at the ground or at each other.   It was a sad, terrible day.  One like theyd never seen.  Such violence perpetrated by their own? Unheard of.  And nowwhat?  We must not think evil of them, Samuel cautioned.  They are our bruders and schwestern.  Our neighbors and friends.   Mark searched the faces of the group.  Perhaps we should sing while we wait, he said.   Jeb frowned, smoothed the back of his head.  Realized how much he missed his hat.  How odd he felt here without it.  He turned to look at the moving slideway.  Anything or anyone could get off it.  I dont know if thats a wise notion, he said.   Mark scratched his beard on the side.  Why not?  Because we dont know whats out there.  He nodded at the slideway.  Anyone could find us.   But weve separated ourselves, Mark said.  Shut them in  Samuel raised his hands.  I believe a song is exactly what we need.  The devil hates it when we sing praises to Gott.  So let us sing! Something from Bauman, I think.  He began to sing, moving one hand slowly as he did so.  For a few moments he was joined by only Mark, but then others joined in.  It was a sorrowful tune.  One of being chased and driven.  Of sneaking around like a mouse, and friends who forsake.  Being sold into the hands of enemies.   Jeb had to admit, it was appropriate.  But all he could think of was his Sarah.  While the song continued he took out his folded map and studied it.  They were not far from where he and Sarah stayed.  Perhaps he should just go to her.  Let the ships security folks take the others wherever they would.  He was not their leader, after all.  He was still shunned.   And he might never be a part of them again.  The notion startled him, but he realized it was probably true.  Did that mean he was lost? Bound for hell? Thats what Amisher tradition implied.  He felt sorrow, a twinge of hopelessness.   A portion of the landing areas wall was transparent in both directions, as were the sides of the tube itself.  Jebs view was partially obscured by the others in the landing, so he moved to a place where he could watch down the length of the slideways tube-like structure.  Soon the security men would come to escort them.  Then he could return to Sarah.   Another thought clicked, and he started to feel more anxious.  Their neighbor! The man who was with the Amisher girl.  He had to be one of the afflicted too, didnt he? It would explain his strange behavior.  The girls behavior too.  He glanced over at the wall communicator.  Could he call Sarah to warn her to not open the door? Would she talk to the desk?  He noticed the shadow of someone in the tube traveling toward them.  He glimpsed grey headgear and what looked like a rifle.  Possibly it was two people.  One shorter than the other.   He glanced at his map again.  Nodded his head.  Theyve arrived then.   The Amishers stopped singing as the security guards stepped off the slide.  It was a male and a female, actually.  Both had helmets on their heads.  And carried silver guns.  The woman scanned the faces of those in the landing.  Which of you is Jebediah? she asked.   Jebediah stepped forward, only to have Samuel step in front of him.  I am sorry, Samuel said.  He is not one of us.  He cannot lead us.   The woman frowned but looked in Jebediahs direction.  Youre him, right? I remember you from the meeting.   Jebediah nodded.  I am.   She nodded.  Im Danielle.  Were here to escort you, all right?  Jeb returned the nod.  Yes, that will be good.  He held up his map.  I would like to return to my wife also.   Danielle squinted.  And where is she?  He turned the map so she could see.  I made a drawing of your ship.  He pointed to what he knew to be the rear section.  We have a place in this area here.   She nodded.  Thats a pretty good map you have there.  The new spot they have for your people is here.  She pointed to a spot more to the front of the ship.  We can take you to your place after we finish there, okay?  Jeb nodded.  That will be adequate.  Thank you.   She nodded again and waved a hand toward the slide.  Okay, everyone, lets start moving this way.  She indicated the other guard, a man who seemed to dwarf her.  My companion, Haden, is going to lead the way in the slide.  After he gets in, I want everyone to form a line behind him.  Single file, please.  No pushing, no hurrying.  Just line up and step on.  There is a handrail if the motion bothers you.  Any questions?  Samuel put both hands in front of his waist.  Looked serious.  And where are you taking us?  To a large cafeteria.  A temporary place until we can get this situation worked out.   Will there be many of your people there? he asked.   No, not many.  Danielle frowned.  I dont think so.   But this place, it is a cafeteria Englishers use regularly, ya?  Her frown deepened.  I suspect theyll close it.  Send people elsewhere.   Samuel didnt look convinced.  But he nodded anyway.   Haden approached the slide and prepared to step on.   Danielles waving got more pronounced.  Okay, if there are no more questions, we will begin loading now.  One at a time, please.   There were uneasy looks passed around.  Sadness in staying, and in going.  And fear, Jebediah knew.  Fear of changes that seemed to never end.  He looked at Samuel, still standing as he was.  Watching but saying nothing.  Lost in his own thoughts.  Mark looked at him, of course.  Always followed him.  Even though Jeb and Mark had been close at one time.   Jebediah said nothing.  Just approached the slideway.  With a nod, Haden stepped on, and Jeb followed.  He watched behind him as he moved.  A few moments passed and no one entered.  He said nothing, but he wanted to.  Wanted to encourage them on.  But he was no leader.  Just a shunned miller whod had a secret.   Lets go then, he heard someone say.  First Mark, and then Samuel stepped on behind him.  Probably a good seven feet behind him.  Others filed in, one after another.  Their communitywhat was left of itmoving as one again.   Together.           Congi reclined heavily on his bed.  Hed just finished feastinganother young Amish woman whom hed sent staggering away.  Back to the bay where she belonged.  Now he would rest, think.  Plan.   His animals, what he liked to think of as his pets, sat together on one wall.  Along with the original goat, there was now a dog and another hen that Congi had let the goat convert as an initial test.  It was an odd picture, the three sitting together, but he found it entertaining.  They kept their eyes always on him.  Obeyed his every command as if they spoke his language.   Servants were important to existence, obviously.  The difficulty was in keeping all of them feeling special, even when, in the end, they were all disposable.  Pawns in the ultimate goal.   Survival.   He was startled by a knock at his door.  The knock was followed by a digital whistle from the outside pad.  He groaned.  He had contemplated joining the others.  Moving to the larger bay, but that had seemed backwards somehow.  He needed new quarters, yes, but he wasnt going to move in with the lowly servants.  Not yet.  He had bigger goals in mind.   He shook his head and stood.  He walked to the interior pad and checked the image from outside.  It was the diminutive intern, and he looked anxious.  Sweating.  Foley.   Frowning, Congi opened the door.  He checked both directions outside before letting the young man in.  Why are you here?  I was almost captured.   And you came here? Risked exposing me?  I knew youd know what to do.  Youre the  Congi gave him an icy stare.  Never visit me.  If you need a place to hide, go to the bay.  I understand it is ours now.  But not here.   Foley lowered his head.  His eyes sought the ground.  Im sorry.  I was frightened.   There is no reason to be frightened now.  Youre more than you ever were before.  Youre a survivor.   Congi thought about how many had been converted now.  Frowned.  That was a mistake.  Letting David run the show in Bay 17 had been a mistake.  It always shouldve been a balancing act.  If the predators outnumbered the prey, the predators would turn on each other.  It wasnt that different from the supply and demand philosophy hed followed with his old line of work.   Thankfully, they would have more prey soon.  A few more days, and Obelisk.  Then anything would be possible.  It was good to plan ahead, though.  To get things under control.  Some things the Amish did were useful.  Portions of their life could be adapted.   He touched Foleys chin, raised his face so he could look him in the eyes.  I need you to convey something to David.  Make sure he understands the danger were in now.   Foley nodded.  Still looked jittery.  Nervous.   Who was it? Congi said.  Who tried to get you?  My old boss, Foley said.  Mr.  Greels.   Congi scowled.  Greelsand why would he be involved? Tell me what happened.  Everything.   Foley prattled on for many minutes.  Detailing his stalking of the girl.  His feasting.  A portion of that was proper.  Foley wasnt a complete screw-up.  More servants in the office poolwas good.  But the choice of venue.  The response.   And the young lady, what was her name?  Candle.   She was taken?  Foley shrugged.  I just ran.   So you still gave them what they wanted.  Just not you.   Another shrug.  A nervous shake of the head.   And theyre probably studying her now Congi had read a few books in his youth, typically stolen books.  He remembered stories of old kings and generals.  A position that he supposed he now found himself in.  Those who survived many battles always had one thing in common.   Adaptability.   Congi, walked to the reflective surface that was built into the wall near the excretorium.  Checked his look in it.  He still looked presentable in his middle-tier Guild blues.  Nice shirt and pants.  Would the doctor approve? He thought so.  He turned to look at Foley.  About that message to David? he said.   Yes, Foley said, nodding.   Congi looked past Foley to the animals by the wall.  They immediately stood.  The dog lowered its head and the goats tongue extended.  The chicken only stared.   Congi smiled.  Ill deliver it myself.   The goat hit first, and then the dog.  The chicken clucked and flapped, but eventually it feasted.  As did they all.           Darly lost track of time.  She could tell it was late in her shift because her communicator had chimed two hours ago, reminding her to make her final rounds.  She immediately called one of the nurses and assigned him the task.  They only had one additional patient with them, after all.  The injured security guard, and hed been resting peacefully the entire time.   So far, he seemed normal.  In every test.  Normal.  White blood count equivalent to the wounds he received.  Plus, the scanner worked fine on him.  Darly was able to digitally walk through every organ and system.  Get the full ledger of percentages.  There were a few anomalies, of course, but everyone had some.  He was a normal human being.   As for the restGreels and the othersshed sent them away.  Whatever was causing these behavioral changes, it wasnt a virus.  Not in the normal sense.  She checked the air around the young lady Candle again and again.  Nothing airborne.  Nothing unusual.  The ships filtration should wipe out anything unusual anyway.  Keep anything from spreading.  Shed been nervous before.  Overreacted.  No need for masks and gowns.  No need to have so many people around either.  She liked to think alone.   Shed also determined that there was no danger of incidental contact spreading the disease, either through touch or trace bodily fluids.  It didnt appear to be happening that way.  But clearly something was happening.   Darly straightened herself, felt the tightness in her back from stooping.  Candle was still unconscious.  She was strapped to the examination table, now configured so it paralleled the floor.  The examination room remained clean and uncluttered.  Darly had a rolling equipment rack with her.  It had many compartments.  Categorized.  Alphabetized.  Scientific.   The results of her initial biopsies were bizarre.  Shed tested samples of the liver, lungs, and skin.  The cells had seemed grossly cancerous.  Altered to the point of being non-functional.  Yet, they did function.  She could see the woman breathing right now.  Inhaling and exhaling.  Before being tranquilized, she had asked for food repeatedly.  Seemed ravenous.   One thing Darly had a theory on was why the scanner malfunctioned.  Candles organs, especially the lower levels of skin, had somehow become coated with a substance that obscured the image.  A metalloid of some sort.  A base element.  She needed a specific test to determine which one, though.   Frowning, she reached into the second level of her equipment rack and drew out a slender, finger-sized analyzer.  She held it up to the light to make sure it was set correctly.  On the top of her rack was a portion of the skin sample in a petri dish.  She opened that dish and brought the analyzer to it.  It beeped to show it had detected the sample.   Her med pad was on the equipment rack, as well.  After a few seconds it chimed with an indicator of the analyzers result.  A picture shaped like the miniature analyzer appeared.  She touched it and squinted at the results.  Brought her head back, surprised.   Arsenic? But nothing could live with that much in their system.   She stared at the patient again.  Shook her head.  Time for more exhaustive measures.           An hour later, Darlys stomach reminded her how hungry she was.   Shed had to dig a bit to find the equipment she needed.  Had to search every cabinet.  Ultimately she was surprised to even find it.  The main scanner had superseded so many pieces of equipment.  Made them redundant or obsolete.  Normally, ships like the Raven wouldnt have anything else.  In that case, she might have had to actually revert to using a scalpel and forceps.   Imagine that! Blood on the gloves!  She did find what she was looking for, though: a self-propelled micro scanner system.  It came in a white textured case with its own handle.  Its own readout screen.  It was so old it didnt even sync with her med pad.  Archaic, but still useful.  Still within her knowledge base.   She set the case on the top shelf of her equipment rack and opened it.  Brought out the triangular applicator.  Turned it a few times with her fingers.  It had a slot for the injectable probe on the back.  She found a couple of those sealed in plastic.  She tore one open.  It was pill-shaped and green.  But she knew that was only an additional case.  The probe was near-microscopic.  She loaded the pill into the machine.   The door slid open behind her and Dixon timidly stuck his head in.  Our other patient is up, he said.  Our security guard.  He wants to go.   Darly said nothing.  Patted the applicator in her hand, thinking.   I scanned him twice, Dixon said.  Checked all his vitals.  Hes healthy.  A smile.  Healthier than Ive ever been.   Darly nodded.  He can go.  Just tell him to keep his com on.   Dixon dipped his head and backed out.  Closed the door.   Darly frowned, shook her head.  She leaned over the equipment rack to where her med pad lay.  Candles vitals were displayed there.  The pulse was faster than it should be for someone at rest, but that hadnt changed.  The patients temperature was wrong too.  Too hot.   More mysteries.  She checked the applicator one last time, then took Candles hand and turned it so the veins of her right arm were exposed.  She lined the applicator up with the largest of these, pressed the button at her thumb.  There was a brief hissing sound as the probe entered Candles bloodstream.   Darly reached into the case again and took out the square monitoring device.  Already, readings were being listed there: internal temperature, pressure, vascular elasticity.  Important components of the bloodstream.  To the left of the listings was a rectangular visual display of the inside as the probe swam.  It was reddish, but a much darker red than she expected.  Lots of black flakes.   What has happened to you, Candle?  The first thing Darly was curious about was the digestive system.  One of the othersGreels, maybehad said something about consuming blood.   Hematophagy wasnt uncommon in the animal world.  Some of the most resilient mammals and insectsthe mosquito, for instancesubsisted on blood.  Though she didnt like to ruminate on it, blood was a highly efficient food source.  It was filled with proteins and lipids, and it required very little effort to procure.  Just locate a vein, open it, and drink.  Much quicker than the usual skinning, tearing, and chewing.  Or in the case of humans, the hours of intricate preparation.  Compared to every other species, humans were notoriously slow eaters.  Especially when you factored in the hunting and gathering time.   Finally, the probe reached the lower intestine.  It worked its way slowly up, mapping and processing.  Just like the planetary landers that had been used for early space exploration.  The readings here were still unusual.  Too hot, too fast, too high.   Next came the upper intestine.  The probe swam its way through the twisted twenty feet.  Continued to map and quantify.   Darly hoped to see something important.  To get some overall picture of the system.  The software in these old scanners wasnt as good at that.  Of drawing a large overview.  But she was hopeful.   The scanner reached the stomach.  Unfortunately, there wasnt much unusual there either, other than more indications of a heightened metabolism.  A faster rate.  Straight absorption into the stomach walls.   She twisted her lips.  Thought for a moment.  Blood.  Dare she try to introduce some? See what happened? She looked at the patient again.  Short dark hair.  Still breathing heavily.  Still under strong sedation.   The captain had said to learn whatever she could There would be no danger in trying.   Darly stood and left the room, returning a few minutes later with a sample of clean plasma in a sealed bag.  She loaded another probe, but this time with a drop of the plasma to be carried along within the case.  She sent the probe into the body.  Watched it.  Guided it to the stomach.  Dispersed the tiny amount of fluid.   Absorption was almost instantaneous.  Not like a human digestive system at all.   So, hematophagy?  Darly picked up her med pad.  Squinted at it.  She then pushed the medical functionality to the side of the pads void and accessed one of the ancillary functions.  Veterinarian functions.  She wanted to see how hematophagy played out in mammals.  There were very few mammals that subsisted through blood digestion, of course.  She made a quick scan of those.  Her eyes stopped on one entry:  the blood plasma is quickly absorbed through the stomach walls.  This allows the animal to quickly shed the weight of the liquid nourishment in order to take flight  She thought for a moment.  Glanced at the micro scanner screen again.  Could that be what was going on here? The sort of digestive specialization that was seen in animals like the vampire bat?  And what part could arsenic play? Aside from fouling up the scanner?  Darly straightened again.  Fought her ever-tightening back.  Winced.  She crossed the room to the cupboards and leaned against the counter there.  Brought up her med pad.  Performed another search.  She knew arsenic was a poison, of course.  But it had other uses certainly.  She browsed through the search results.  A couple items stood out.   at non-toxic levels, can serve as a mild stimulant  aids in respiration  The first item was from a section describing historic uses of the element.  The second, from a biology discussion on rare forms of bacteria.  Both seemed relevant to what she was seeing.  The patient clearly was stimulated.   Darly fought back a yawn.  Checked the time on her med pad.  Shook her head.  Speaking of needing stimulants.  Whew.  She wondered if the nurses had left coffee on when theyd left.  She set her medical pad on the counter.  Looked at the patient again.  Perhaps she should take a break.  She would perform better with a little time away.  Shed heard nothing from the group of Amish, so she assumed theyd been reassigned and hadnt had any injuries after all.  The situation seemed to be contained.  Controlled.   She checked the time again.  She should call Dixon back.  Let him mind the shop while she slept.  But there were answers here.  More to discover.   Perhaps that coffee.  She walked to the door.  Opened it.   And was surprised.       28    They rode the slideway in silence for some time.   To his right, Jebediah watched as they passed one barn-sized room after another.  Most were darkened, but there was enough light to tell that they were completely filled with sealed packages.  All white.  So many boxes.  So many material possessions.  More than hed ever seen in one place.  All going somewhere.  To some planet equally filled with possessions, no doubt.  He was amazed the spheres could still keep spinning with all that weight on them.   Gods handiwork was amazingly versatile.  Incredibly robust.   He shook his head.  Thought of Sarah again.  All by herself.  He needed to get back.  He turned to the male security guard.  How much longer do we have?  The guard made a quick check behind them at the rest of the group.  All were quiet and morose.  Most stared off to the side as Jeb had done.  Not much longer, he said then.   Jebediah feigned a smile.  I would like more specifics, son.  I have a pregnant wife to return to.   The guard frowned.  Well take the next cross slide to the other side of the Raven.  Then back toward the rear, past the even-numbered bays.   And then?  The guard turned away, fixing his eyes on the slide ahead.  Then well take you to the designated area.   This cafeteria? Jeb said.   The guard didnt turn his head.  Just nodded.   Jeb frowned.  Glanced at the view to their right again.  Found himself wishing for the views of Alabaster.  Even at night.  The Nebbit.  Dont you folks miss the sky? he asked.   The guard glanced at him again.  Grunted.  We see some while were loading and unloading.  He bobbed his head.  Most of the bay ceilings open.  We can see stars, suns, whatnot.   But thats only when youre stopped.   Yeah, we have furloughs.  Vacations.  Spent my last on Sperg.  Went skiing.   But the trips are long.  Jeb indicated the ceiling.  Why not at least see where youre going?  The guard grunted again.  Theres nothing out there to see now, Mr.  Miller.  Just a mass of grey.  A fog.  Makes people crazy.   Jeb heard a snort from behind them and turned to see Samuel wiping his eyes with a white handkerchief.  He repositioned the cloth and blew his nose into it.  Put the rag away.  His eyes were ringed in red.  And still looked wet.   Mark was standing next to Samuel.  He gave him a long look.  Are you all right, Bishop?  Samuel took a long breath.  Paused.  I apologize.  He shook his head slowly.  We have lost much.  Clearly I didnt seek the Lord as I should have.   Mark shook his head.  There was no way of knowing it would come to this.  We made the best decision we could, given the knowledge we had.   Perhaps if wed stayed Samuel gazed in Jebs direction.  Looked more sorrowful.  Yet we have found the trials of Job, Deacon.  The trials of Job.   The lights of a slide stop became evident ahead.  Jeb tried to focus on that.   The guard nodded.  Were getting off here.           The captain was beginning to feel nervous.  He found himself pacing his office.  Studying the plaques on the wall.  Standing long minutes over the aquarium of his spliced lizard frog.  Watching as it circled the water portion, pointed nose moving this way and that, searching for the food Seal floated for it.  Flick, flick, chomp.   He needed to do something, he was certain.  There were too many variables now.  It was an unmanageable ledger.  An entire bay lost? To an infection of some sort? And the pilots! Why werent they answering?  Dont go anywhere, Darly had said.  What did that mean? What were they facing?  Then there was Singer.  What to do about her? She was attractive and clever.  Intelligent.  Someone he could absolutely spend time away from his desk with.  But her beliefsfounded centuries ago? How did they mix with the rest? And could they possibly be relevant?  Yet there was somethingintangible, about her.  It went beyond confidence.   The frizard climbed out of the water and onto the simulated tree perch.  Looked up at Seal.  Shifted its head nervously.  Flicked its tongue.   Seal clenched his hands.  The bubble! The pilots were what was most important.  He needed to reach them.  He walked to the desk again.  Pushed forcefully on the call indicator for the pilots bubble.  The desk ring flashed red.  Once, twice.   A connection square materialized from the void.  Wavered, then resolved into an image of Perth.  He was reclining in his pilots chair with his arms leisurely folded in his lap.  His clothes looked rumpled and the collar of his uniform was turned up to hide his neck.  His face wore a scowl.  Why are you calling? he asked.   Seal squinted.  Why am I? Would you like to rephrase that question, pilot?  Perths scowl continued.  Not really.   Seal's chest began to burn.  You clearly need some time away from that chair, he said.  Wheres Egan?  Perth sniffed.  Reached off screen.  Hey, Egan! Captain wants to see you.   No response.  Perth shrugged, threw up his hands.  Hes been tired lately.  Hungry.  He gestured between himself and the off-screen Egan.  Were both hungry.   Seals insides felt empty.  Anxious.  Are we still on schedule?  Perth straightened in his seat.  Oh, certainly, Captain.  Straight on to Obelisk.  Only, what he looked to his right side, adjusted something two days out.  He stretched his arms out.  I cant wait to get there myself.  Get out of this place.  He bobbed his head.  This fog.   Is that right?  Perth pushed at the invisible Egan again.  This time, Seal heard a grunt.  Oh, yeah, we have big plans, dont we, Egan? See things.  Meet people.  A smile.  Everyone has plans.   Everyone?  Sure! All of us.  Were like a family.  This group.   Ive lost the ship, Seal realized with the chill of lost commendations.  The infection is everywhere.  There are no guarantees now.  Not anywhere.  Not anyone.  He tried to keep the dread off his face, out of his voice.  Our group?  Perth chuckled.  Not your group, captain.  Our group.  The little hive weve established up here.   Seal pictured the pilots bubble and the maze of cubicles below it.  The ships office help.  How many of them were infected too? He thought of Singer again.  Hurriedly had his desk begin to contact her.  Just to be sure.  He said nothing to Perth, though.  Just stared at his now-smiling image.  Held his breath.   Whats wrong, Captain? Perth said.  You look like youre coming down with something.  Have you been sleeping enough?  Im fine, Seal said.  No response from Singer yet.   Perth pointed a finger.  Well, no matter what, sir, you can count on us.  We will get this ship to where it is supposed to go.  We wont miss a stop.  He pushed at the out-of-sight Egan again.  Isnt that right, Egan? Another grunt.  Well get there on time.  Absolutely.  A smile.  So leave the piloting to us.   Seal found himself distracted by the call indicator for Singer.  Watched it continue to try.  He didnt even look at the pilot again when he said, Very good, and ended the connection.  He only watched for Singer.  He needed one thing to still be right.  One thing to still be as it should be.  A glimmer of light.   He waited.  And hoped.           Sarah didnt feel right.  She tried lying in bed, praying, but the feeling wouldnt subside.  She was anxious, obviously.  Afraid for Jebediah.  But was that all of it? The sharp aches and pains? The waves of discomfort that traveled down her midsection?  Sarah pushed herself out of bed.  The child was still very small.  Too small to arrive.  Not enough time had passed.  She searched the rooms blue ceiling.  The lights were dimmed, because that somehow felt better to her.  Shed become more sensitive to everything.  To light, odor.  She felt a wave of pain.  Winced.  Put a hand on her midsection.  Tried to breath deep.  Push the feeling away.   She missed everyone.  She needed the experience of the older women.  Their words of wisdom.  Amidst all their recent upheavals, she had one change coming that eclipsed everything else.  Yet she had no one to talk to about it.   She walked to the desk that Jeb was so fond of.  There was a chronometer in the lower left corner, a depiction of a round silver clock.  The drawing was so fine, so precise, that she could almost imagine it was real.  That she could just pick it up and hold it in her hand.  Incredible, these Englisher devices.   The clock followed the ships representation of time.  There was no correlation between it and their measure of time on Alabaster.  But why would there be? Alabaster was only one of many planets.  And it was lost to them now.  She supposed the clock represented some worlds time.  But perhaps not.  Perhaps there was no concrete form of anything anymore.   Regardless, the clock told her one thing: It had been many hours since Jebediah had left.  It was now well into the afternoon.  Shed thought he might try to call her, but so far, nothing.  It was also the case that he might not know how to call her.  The only call hed ever made, to the captain, had been completely by accident.   She felt a wave of anxiety.  Another twinge of pain.  She leaned over the desk.  Looked hard at the darkness it illustrated.  Waved her right hand across it.   Small images appeared everywhere.  At one point, Jeb had showed her how hed found the ships map.  She frowned.  Squinted.  Did she remember that now? Which image brought it to life?  There were a lot of images.  A confusing amount of them.  How had Jeb figured out anything?  She scanned from left to right, a row at a time.  Images both strange and familiar.  Finally, she thought she saw it.  Circular, with a dissecting skeleton.  She held her finger over it.  What would happen if she were wrong? What change would she bring about? Who would she accidentally call?  She shrugged and pressed the circle.  She held her finger there, waiting for something to happen.  After a few seconds, a model of the ship emerged.  She smiled.  Studied it.  Tried to focus without being overwhelmed.  It was extremely complex.  Like looking inside a dead animal.   The framework had a large red X indicated on it, though.  Doubtless her current location.  She remembered the specific number of the bay the settlement was occupyingseventeen.  The place where Jebediah was supposed to go.  The rectangles of the large bays had numbers on them.  They alternated from one side of the ship to the other.  One here, two there, three here, etc.  She counted through them until she found seventeen on the map.  Tried to get an idea how to connect her X to that location.  It didnt look too bad.   Another pain struck her.  Stronger than the last, she thought.  More intense.   She felt fear again.  Shook her head.  Leaned hard against the desk.  She needed to find Jebediah.  She shouldve gone with him in the first place.  She studied the map until she was certain she knew the way.  It was simple enough.  Very few turns.   Her kapp was on the arm of the chair to her right.  She retrieved it and fit it into place.  She checked her look in the reflective wall near the excretorium.  Noted that she looked a trifle flushed.  Tired.  The kapp looked fine, though.  She frowned, nodded, and opened the door.   This shouldnt take long.           Darly took a step back, shielding her chest with her medpad.  Then, when she realized what she was doing, she clutched it even tighter.  Tried to hide how off-kilter she felt.  What do you want? she asked.   Congis hair was slicked back and he wore a medium blue button-down shirt.  His pants were a slightly darker shade but still seemed to match perfectly.  Both were regulation Guild wear, but way beyond the typical dress for a maintenance man.  Not that different from the last time shed seen him, though.   He stood in the entrance to the examination room, blocking her way to the hall.  He smiled at her.   Again, she said.  What do you want?  The smile broadened.  Im here to help you.   There was a wave of floral fragrance.  An unforgettable scent.  The same crushed roses smell Darly had experienced in Congis presence before.  She wanted to breathe deeply, to just absorb the smell.  But part of her, a place deep in her brain, warned her to keep it out.  To not let the scent in.   She shook her head, brought a hand to her face.  Im sorry, she said, but you shouldnt be in here.  She motioned toward Candle.  This young lady has an infection.  And Ive yet to determine the cause.  She motioned him back.  We should both go out.  And possibly wear masks.   Congi wrenched his head back.  Masks? he said.  I dont like masks.   She fanned the air near her nose.  Sometimes theyre necessary.  They can protect us.   Congi took a step forward, turned to study the patient.  What are her symptoms? he asked.  She appears normal.   Darly still clutched her medpad.  If given a second, she could use it to call security.  A simple double finger-press maneuver.  She would need only to take her hand away from her face.  And to glance at the pad itself.  But right now, she was having a hard time drawing her gaze away from Congis eyes.  They were dark.  Incredibly handsome.  Like tiny black holes.   She shook her head.  Forced her gaze away.   Congi drew closer.  Why are you covering your face? he asked.  Is my breath bad?  Why are you here? She managed to look at her medpad.  Acted as if she were checking something.  She found she couldnt interact with it, though.  She couldnt even bring her fingers up.  You dont have an appointment.  A diversion.  A hopeless feint.   As I said, Im here to help.  With your investigation.  A smile.  Here now.  I know something of this disease.   She looked at the floor.  Using the tiles to guide her, she took a step back toward the patients table.  You do?  Yes, lots of information.  He stretched an arm toward her.  Come, Ill show you.   She shook her head.  I really dont have time for this.  She needed to at least get behind the examination table.  Use it as a second shield.  She took another step and realized she could hear Candles breathing.  The frequency seemed to be increasing.  Was she waking up?  Were all related, you know, Congi said.  With only a few variations, we all have the exact same DNA.  The same controlling structures.   Is that true? Even though Congi hadnt moved any closer to her, she had the feeling he was crowding her.  Drawing the air from the room.  Or somehow pressing it all up against her.  She wasnt certain.  She just felt wrong.  Vulnerable.   In a manner of speaking, yes.  Yet humans spin this roulette wheel to create new ones.  A genetic meat grinder.  He shook his head.  It is inefficient, this merging of genetic material.  Prone to errors.   She managed to get behind the examination table.  She glanced at Candle.  Her face looked flushed, almost to the point of looking sunburnt.  Her breathing was still very rapid.  It has worked well so far Now Darly thought she could hear Candles heart beating.  Thumpity, thumpity, thumpity.   Congi frowned.  That is open to debate.  He paused, crossed his arms, studied her.  Some animals communicate chemically, Congi said, Did you know that? Take ants, for instance.  Lacking verbal ability, obviously, but possessed of a highly developed use of pheromones.   The speed and volume of Candles heartbeat increased, so much that Darly wanted to bring her hands to her ears.  Congis odor was everywhere now.  It was like falling into a basket of roses.  She glanced at him.  He seemed irresistible yet deplorable.  She wrestled with herself for control.  She was sweating.  Uncomfortable.   Thump, thump, thump, thump.   Then silence.  Darly looked at Candle.  She was completely still.  Didnt appear to be breathing.   What had just happened? Darly searched Congis face.  What had he done?  He leaned back against the doorjamb with a bemused look.  Crossed his arms.  That was fun.   Darly bent over Candle and felt her neck for a pulse.  When she found nothing, she tried the wrist too.  She then put her ear to Candles chest.  Silent.  Empty.  Vacant.   Dead.   Darly shook her head, tried to fend off the roses.  The distraction.  She set her medpad on the edge of the table and placed her hands on Candles chest.  Tried to start basic CPR.  Her arms felt weak, though.  She could barely compress the chest.  She was afraid to breathe into the young woman.  Afraid of the contact.  What did you do? she asked.  How?  Im helping, he said.  Helping you.  Helping me.  He pushed away from the door.  Took a step in her direction.  You seem very tired to me, Darly.  He indicated Candle.  This complication, this search for answers, you really dont need to pursue it.  Better to just let it go.  To simplify.   He had killed Candle without touching her.  Stopped her heart.  Her breathing.   Darly numbly shook her head.  No.  She reached for her medpad again.  Tried to focus on the screen.  On what she needed to do.   Ill give you what youre looking for, believe me, Congi said.  A new life.  New purpose.  He opened his arms welcomingly, drew closer.   She could do nothing.           Singer stood at the slideway stop.  She felt a little nervous.  Strange.  The only sounds she could hear were the low hum of the crossover slide that ran in front of her and the fainter hum of the long blue slide to her left.  And even though the small room was lit and the tubes themselves were lit, it felt really dark to her here.  Really secluded.   She never felt really alone, though.  Not the kind of loneliness she sensed in others.  The reserved Darlyor the bombastic Greels.  Both seemed sad and lonely, despite their masks.   She brought her com device up and tried to contact security again.  Got no response.  Frowned.  She knew they were busy.  Aside from those who were escorting the Amish, there was another group that was supposedly checking on Bay 17.  Trying to contact the leaders.  See what was going on.   Singer prayed theyd be safe.  That they wouldnt run into anything too dangerous.  But from what Jebediah had described  She tried to call medical.  No luck there either.  She then dialed her replacement up front.  See if anything had come in on the scraddle.  No response from Candle.  It was as if the entire ship had been furloughed.   Deserted.   She shivered, wished for a jacket.  Her thoughts drifted to the captain.  About what he must think of her.  Christians were such a minority now.  Oh, sure, there were whole worlds that ascribed to some form of Christian thoughtlike Alabaster had, in some waysbut those were few and far between.  And even the modern ones like Freehaven seemed to get a little less friendly, a little more secular, every time she visited.   Better to be on a Guild shipping vessel than to watch a civilization slowly crumble.  Slowly lose its way.  Perhaps the Amish had something there.  Even with their archaic dress and unwritten rules, at least they kept each other honest.  Held on to what was important.  Relationships.  Most churches didnt do that.  Even most friends and families.   She noticed a shadow on the slideway tube.  As the figure grew closer, she recognized it.  Dressed in heavy loaders pants and Guild t-shirt.  She raised an eyebrow.   He was surprised too.  Almost looked embarrassed.  He bobbed his head.  Gave a little wave as he stepped off the slide onto the landing.   Greels, she said.  What are you doing over here?  He shrugged.  I was just He glanced in the direction that the blue slideway was traveling.  Toward the back of the ship.  The larger bays.  Things are strange now.  I felt like moving around.   She nodded.  Sometimes I ride the slides when Im nervous too.  She forced a smile.  Reminds me of childhood.   Greels grunted.  Yeah, it is something like that.  I have places I like to go to think.   She brought her hands behind her back.  Clasped them together.  Me too.  She squinted.  Though Id think youd want to stay far away from the bays when were not loading  His face flushed.  Another shrug.  Like I said, I like to travel.   There was something decidedly lecherous about Greels, Singer knew, and typically she wouldnt want to be alone with him.  But in this instance, she found he didnt bother her too much.  He was interesting company, at least.  Not an answer to prayer, but interesting.   What are you doing here? he asked.   Waiting for Jebediah, she said.  The Amish.   Greels snorted.  More trouble He took a hesitant step toward blue.  Stopped.  Knew we shouldnt have brought them on this ship.   Singer felt a flash of anger.  Pushed it down.  You think we shouldve left them to die, then?  Greels waved a hand.  Stepped toward the other slide, then back her way again.  Look at whats happened since they arrived! All sorts of crazy.   She just watched him.  So we shouldve left them.   Blamed right, shouldve left them.  Thats what theyre all about, right? Being left alone? He was pacing nervously now.  Animated.  You werent attacked.  You dont know.   She crossed her arm.  But Foley attacked you.   Yeah, but he was with them.  On the planet.  It all went bad after that.  They brought something with them.  Some sort of nutso.   Did they? Singer looked at the floor.  She wished she knew.  Darly said it was impossible that it was a pathogen.  Ships filters shouldve detected it.  And her initial physicals.  She shook her head.  I dont think they did.  Perhaps we did it to them.  Exposed them to something new.   Greels paused.  Brought a hand to his chin.  Scratched hard.  Swatted the air.  Bah, theyre just crazy.  From all their rules.  And the wool.  Squeezed their hats on too tight.   Singer rolled her eyes.  Looked at the screen of the nearby wall-mounted com unit.  Thought of her handheld unit.  Would a call to the captain be out of place?  Where are you taking them? Greels asked.  Because if you need more dwellings put up His hands found his pants pockets.  Well, I got union rules to deal with.  Already worked the loaders about twice what theyre supposed to be.   Singer nodded.  Theres not that many.  And hopefully this is only temporary.   Greels studied her.  So, where?  She brought up her com and studied the ship map.  For now, theyre going to the cafeteria near Bay 15, but I noticed You know, we have bit a space in 16 yet.  If this goes long, we could  Greels face whitened.  Sixteen?  She shrugged.  Im just thinking long term.  If  Mess up another of my bays with animals and folks who rarely wash? No.  Fifteen, sixteen, no.   I didnt know you felt so strongly.  She heard a commotion to her right.  She looked in that direction down the cross slideway.  There was a group of people there, dressed primarily in black and white.  Ah, the Amish.   They were running.   What are those fools doing now? Greels asked.       29    She shouldve made a map.   Sarah walked steadily down another grey hallway.  The markings on the wall told her nothing.  Just arrows and words that gave only room numbers.  Nothing about a bay, though.  Shouldnt every sign be in reference to some bay? They had certainly seemed large enough on the map.  But the rooms she was encountering now were all very small.  Inside were things made of metal, the use of which she couldnt begin to fathom.  All empty of people.   The ship seemed particularly empty.  It was as if someone had called a meeting somewhere.  Like one of their biweekly services.  How she missed those now.  Just like everything on Alabaster.   She reached a place where two halls met.  The corner to her right had a large upward-pointing arrow and the word slideway on it in yellow letters.  She knew she had to ride one of those at some point.  Given that the hallways werent helping, maybe that was the way to go? She followed the arrow to some stairs, and from there found a slideway entrance.  The last time shed ridden on one, she hadnt been alone.  It had felt a bit unstable then  She watched the slide floor closely as she neared it.  She noticed the handrail next to it, and focused on it.  She put her hand out and touched the rail, felt it slide slowly past her fingers.  She remembered being told to grab on slowly.  She checked her feet, closed on the rail, and with a start and a relieved smile, began her journey down the slide.   A few minutes later she became nervous that shed gone too far.  She saw signs for even numbered bays as different stops went by, but they appeared to be diminishinggetting closer to zeronot increasing.  And she was on eight now.  She decided to stop at the next stop.  Find a way to cross the ship.  Ride back the way shed come.   At the next stop she managed to make it off.  Again, she felt lonely.  The stop was empty.  Fairly well lit, but nobody around.  She felt a strong wave of pain, put out a hand for the wall.  Rested as the pain passed.  Shook her head.  She noticed a mounted screensimilar to the desk, but vertical.  Probably used for a similar purpose? Maybe it had a map on it? She walked over and placed a hand on it.  It flashed to life.  The look was similar but different enough to make her unsure.  She did manage to find the map image again, though.  Her current X was nowhere near where she wanted to be.  Shed gone exactly the wrong way.  She let out a hiss of exasperation.  Wished again that Jebediah was with her.   Of course, she couldnt get herself into too much trouble, could she? No matter what she did, shed still be on the ship.  Somewhere.   She noticed something on the map then.  Another familiar symbol.  It gave her a glimmer of hope.  She looked at the place where she was and the place where the symbol was.  If she was reading it right, it was just down these stairs and to the left a little ways.  She could make that, she thought.   It wasnt her first choice, but there ought to be someone there who could help.           The two security guards led them from one slide to another.  Their group remained silent, reserved.   When they reformed their line again, Jebediah was still in the front, but Samuel and Mark were a good ways behind.  At one point, he thought he saw them praying together quietly.  He respected them for that.  Even bowed his own head for a quick prayer.  He asked for comfort for Sarah and the others onboard.  And for some restoration.  And protection.  But mostly he asked for wisdom in knowing what to do.  How best to perform the Lords will.   But if he had lost his eternal salvation by losing his fellowship with his community, was God even listening?  Jebediah tried to engage the male guard in conversation again, but it was of little use.  The guard acted as if there was somewhere else he should be.  As if the idea of escorting Amishers around a ship made no sense.  And normally Jeb would agree with him.  The guard hadnt seen what theyd seen, though.   Overhead, beyond the transparent tube, he could see the ships infrastructure.  It was made up of large, impossibly long beams.  A latticework of them.  He shook his head.  Such an accomplishment.  It would doubtless withstand rust forever.   He heard two chirps.  One from the guards waist near him, and onehe guessedfrom the wrist of the guard near the end of the line.  The nearest guard brought his communication device up where he could see it.  The voice Jeb heard was that of the female guard, though.   Unit three here.   The next voice was female too but sounded decidedly nervous.  Keep your head clear, the caller said.  Then the voice cut out completely.   There was a pause.  The male guard stared at his device.   Come again, dispatch? the female said.   There was a garble of static.  Then the words lost, two, and bull.   Jebediah looked toward the rear of the line.  He had to lean so he could see the face of the female guard.  She looked confused.  Say again? she said.   No response.  Just more static.  The female guard started moving in his direction, excusing herself up through the line of Amishers.  She stopped between Jeb and the other guard.  She blew a lock of hair away from her face.  Her eyes were wide.  Did you hear that? she asked.   The male guard grunted.  Nodded.  What was it?  She shook her head.  I dont know.  She tried her communicator again.  She was close enough that Jeb could see the screen.  It was completely black.  Then it flashed, and the image of a dark-skinned female appeared.  Unit Three! Theyre coming your way! The image broke up, rolled, and finally froze.   What is going on? the male guard said.  Never seen that before.   The female looked back down the line of Amishers, and then in front of them.  What is coming? she said.  What? She motioned toward the line, raised her gun.  Ill be back there.   The male brought his gun up, as well.  No, he said.  Ill go.  And he started pushing roughly through the line.   There was an indiscernible noise.  A roar.  A strange mix of sounds coming from behind.  Someone back there yelped.  Samuels voice said Dear Lord.  Then there were lots of shouts.  Screams.  The group started to push toward them, and Jeb and the guards started moving ahead too.  The pace increased until it was nearly a jog.   Jeb really wanted to look, though.  To see what they were up against.  So he let others pass him on both sides, drifting to the back of the line with the two guards.  Two women and a young boy scurried past him, and thenstill jogginghe glanced back.  His mouth gaped with surprise.   It was like the contents of Noahs legendary ship enraged and set loose.  They came three and four across.  Cows and horses and pigs.  And though Jebs first instinct was to stop and try to halt the flow, there was something very wrong about these animals behavior.  Regardless of the breed or kind, they were sprinting together as one.  Their eyes were reddened and unblinking.  Their goal obvious.   The guards started to fire.  Pling! Pling! Blue balls of energy hit the lead animals.  They bleated and mooed, lurched and fell, but their brethren only stepped on or over them.  The guards fired again and again.  A horse and a pig were hit this time, but still the tide of animals came.  The fallen were trampled into the slideway floor, becoming rugs of white, brown, and red.  And the rest kept coming.   Jebediah stumbled against the slide rail, pushed away, looked ahead, and found a spot to jog in.  It was a bit disconcerting added to the slides own motion, but it was necessary and it allowed him to move faster.  He could see a lighted area farther on.  Another, larger, slideway stop.  Soon the head of the group would reach it.  From there, who knew?  More shots from behind.  Then a shout.  Jeb hazarded a look back, and winced as the female guard was hit by a leaping goat.  It gave a lone bray of victory and bit into the guards neck.  She screamed.  The male guard yelled and fired rapidly.  The goat was hitmany targets were hitbut it wasnt enough.  The animals barely slowed.   The remaining guard paused, clearly trying to decide what to do for his companion.  How best to help.  A white blura rabbit?struck the side of his face.  A line of blood formed there.  The guard felt his cheek, swore.  Then a hog sprang from the crowd, knocking the guard to the ground.   Jebediah looked away, looked forward.  Tried not to think about what hed just seen.  There were other stragglerschildren and heavier womenwho were behind him yet.  He urged them ahead.  They had maybe twenty feet of running room between them and the stampede.  It wouldnt be enough.   The group ahead started to exit the slideway to the left.  There were other Englishers standing there already.  Another woman and a man.  They were yelling, motioned with their arms.  And the Amishers were following.  They were directed toward a second, longer slide.  How would that help? Wouldnt it just continue the chase?  Jeb had no idea, but the Englishers urging only intensified.  So he decided they must know something.  He glanced behind him.  Thankfully, there werent too many horses in the stampede, and those that were there were being blocked by the smaller animals.  A large ram broke ahead, though, and caught the coattail of one of the stragglers.  An older man.   Take your coat off! Jeb screamed.   The man was confused and off balance, but after repeated shouts from Jeb, he managed to take the coat off.  Threw it behind him.  A woman was lost to a goat, though.  It nipped her, pulled her over.   Jeb felt anger.  Righteous anger.  He found himself wishing for something to use on the animals.  A staff or an ax handle.  Something he could swing.  Before all was lost.   He reached the slideway exit and turned left to follow the rest.  It was Miss Singer who was waiting for them, he realized.  And she was waiting.  She stood inside the exit, screaming and waving.   Jeb slowed up.  Veered to the side to join her.  He would help the remainder somehow.   Go on, she said, frowning.  I can get this.   He was about to protest, but as the last Amisher reached the exit, Singer ran back toward it, and with a quick movement, did something that caused the tube exit to seal completely shut.   Animals slammed against the seal, braying and moaning.  The whole group coalesced there.  Some got pushed over the handrails into the slide going the opposite direction.  Screamed as they were dragged away by the slide.  Horned animals started to attack the place where the exit had been.  A large ram made contact, and Jeb saw a small opening in the seal, a place where air could get through.   Singers eyes were wide.   How long will that hold? he asked.   She shook her head.  Were not waiting to see.  She motioned toward the longer slide, where the remaining Amish were now a long swiftly retreating line.  Into the blue slide.  Were getting out of here.           Seal fought his fear.   He felt isolated.  Alone.  Hed never before realized how much at the mercy of his desk he was, but now he understood.  He had been a slave to it.  To a faade of human interaction.  Of human management.  A prisoner in his own office.  He wasnt a captain at all! He controlled nothing.  He was no better than a boy pushing plasteel ships across a kitchen floor.  In fact, he was worse, because there was nothing tangible in his situation at all.  He was completely disconnected.   Seal looked at the plaques on his office wall again.  Swore, and with a swipe of his hands, knocked three of them to the ground.  He even crushed one of themthe picture of him and the admiralinto the floor with his feet.  What a fool he had been.  Purposeless.  As replaceable as a chair.  What now? Where to begin? He had to do something.   There were weapons!  He startled when his desk chimed with an incoming connection.  He hurried over to it.  Moved around it so he could clearly see.   Singer! Singer was calling him! He felt a touch of elation.  The stroke of a hand on his cheek.  Humanityit wasnt lost yet.   He slapped the connection indicator.  Smiled as the image resolved into Singer.  Then he frowned.  She looked disheveled.  Stark white and possibly afraid.  And it seemed she was moving.  Singer, he said.  How can I help?  Seal, thank God.   Where are you? He gripped the sides of the desk.  What is going on?  Were in blue, she said.  We have animals, sir.   He shook his head.  Animals? I dont think I  The Amish livestock is infected.  Large groups are running loose.  Her eyes averted, looking over her shoulder.  Chasing us.   Okay.  He paused, trying to take it all in.  Nodded finally.  And youre on blue?  Yes, sir.  Seal.   And the Amish are with you? Jebediahs group?  Yes.   He looked across the room.  Noticed the pictures hed smashed.  And how far are you from He shook his head.  Never mind, Ill look.  With a few touches of his desk surface he was able to determine the location of Singers com unit.  Not far.  Her image moved, and he was able to glimpse traces of beards and bonnets near her.  Singer?  Yes? Im here.   I want you to take the next stop.  I want all of you to come here to my office.  Can you do that?  Her head seemed to bob.  I think so.  Yes.  Well come there.   He nodded resolutely.  Good.  Ill be waiting.           The smell of roses was everywhere.  It engulfed her.  Darly was helpless to resist.  Her medpad slipped from her hands, clattering on the tiled floor.   Congi only smiled.   For the first time, she noticed his teeth, how irregular they were.  How long the incisors.  How had she not seen that before? What could make that happen? A radical genome change, maybe.  She was filled with questions but they were meaningless now.  Distant echoes in a mind that was no longer fully her own.  Her arms were locked to her side.  She was powerless.   And she found she wanted what Congi had.  Nearly trembled for it.  She felt waves of cold and hot.   Congi was within a few feet of her now.  I wish you knew how discerning I am, he said.  How selective.  His eyes seemed to drink her in.  Ive learned much over the last few days.  Made some mistakes, certainly, but made some good choices too.  One thing I know now: Food selection is important.  As is having a ready supply.  He raised his hand, placed it on her shoulders.  And here you are.  A gift.  Refined, no-nonsense.  Intelligent! A gift.   She tried to shake her head.  Engage some modicum of willpower.  Say something.  But it was no use.  Congi was here.  With her.  The room seemed to drift away, and along with it went the dead patient, her research, her work.   Congis mouth opened wide.  He leaned forward.  Lips brushed the skin above her jugular.  She shut her eyes.  Tried to wish it away.  Or to wish the process madly forward.  She felt a tingling sensation.   Is anyone here? someone said.  A message from another world.   The contact with Congi ended.  He pulled back, stepped away.   Oh, my, the voice said.  Pardon me.   The fog lifted a bit.  Darly shook her head.  Tried to return to the moment.  To her senses.  Her head throbbed.  She squinted her eyes closed.  What? she croaked out.   She heard Congi gasp.  He stepped farther away, backing around to a spot behind her.  Darly forced her eyes open.  Looked toward the door.   An Amish woman stood there.  Reasonably attractive, wearing a soft blue dress and white bonnet.  Blond hair.  An angel?  Darly shook her head again.  Groaned.  The woman was pregnant.  Not an angel.  Not too largely pregnant though.  Four or five months.  The woman leaned heavily on the doorjamb, like something was wrong.  Pain.   Darly felt a wave of empathy.  Suddenly remembered her calling.  Are you all right? she asked.   You dont belong here, Congi hissed from behind her.  He seemed to be cowering.  His hands were on Darlys shoulders.  Why are you here? Of all places?  The woman squinted at them both.  What happened to Lucile? Werent you with Lucile?  Darly stooped to retrieve her medpad, taking her a few steps farther from Congi in the process.  She then stepped around the end of the patients table, glancing at the still form as she did.  She had a twinge of guilt at losing Candle, even though she was clearly no longer human.  No longer just human.   She glanced at Congi.  His face looked flushed now.  Eyes a bit sunken.  The floral scent had disappeared too, she realized.  She found she despised Congi.  Feared him.  She was able to see all the imperfections of his face now.  He wasnt attractive at all, really.  Just a lowly thief.  A pretender.  You need to go, she said.   The pregnant woman narrowed her eyes.  Took a few steps forward.  You are walking in the path of unrighteousness, young man.  No good will come of your behavior.   Congi looked strangely weakened.  He shook his head as if fighting something.  Youre making me uncomfortable.  He moved to his right, into the open area of the room.  His eyes began to dart, like he was looking for a way to escape.   The pregnant woman moved farther into the room.  Placed a hand on her stomach, winced.  Im having some pains, she said to Darly.   Congi made a moaning sound and scrambled past the woman and out the door.  He looked back, squinted, shook his head.  Another time, Darly.  He disappeared into the hallway.  Out of view.   Darly tapped her lip with a finger.  That was strange.   Pardon, the woman said.  I know it is not my business, but that man Her eyes landed on Candles still body.  Is she passed?  Darly frowned.  Im afraid so.  I need to find out what happened there She looked at the womans belly.  You say youre having pains?  Yes, deep ones.  But it is too early.  Tears formed in her eyes.  My apologies.  I am not myself lately.  A head shake.  Feelings are jumbled.   Darly glanced at the door.  Tell me about it.  A quick smile.  What is your name?  Pardon, Sarah Miller.  My husband is Jebediah.   And you know Congi?  A frown.  A hand patted her stomach.  Better now.  She nodded.  Were neighbors, I think.  Ive seen him before, yes.   Darly looked at Sarahs belly.  Probably it is what is called Braxton-Hicks.   Pardon, doctor?  False labor pains.  Rare these days, but not unusual.  And no danger.  A quick smile.  Doubtless theyre more common in your group.  Before elasidium.  She thought of Congi.  Plus, the way this ship travels, slipping between stars, can accelerate other processes too.   Accelerate? Sarahs frown deepened.  Elasi?  Darly shook her head.  Its a medicine.  Ill get you some.  She looked at the blue floor.  Shook her head.  Listen, you saved me from something there.  Somehow.   He did seem to be in a bit of rush, didnt he?  Yes.  Darly tapped her finger on her lips again, thoughtful.  I wonder why? She glanced at Candles body.  Wondered what else she could learn there, then looked at Sarah again.  Okay, lets make sure youre okay first.  Well theorize later.   Sarah nodded.  Lord bless you.   Hmmyes, and you.       30    Suddenly his office felt very full.  Very real.  Important.   Seal was seated at his desk again, but his two guest chairs were filled by an older Amish gentleman named Samuel and a younger man named Mark.  Both were leaders in this group.  Standing or sitting around them were an additional twenty or so Amish, most now dressed in only shirt and pantsor in the case of the womenlong white dresses with full black aprons.  Gone were most of the hats and bonnets.  Victims of the chase across the Raven, across his ship.  Guild property.   To the right of the desk, leaning against the wall, was Singer.  Just beyond her, also on the wall, was Jebediah.  Greels was in the room as well, but he hovered near the door.  Pacing.   Greels, Seal said, will you seat yourself somewhere?  Greels shook his head.  Cant do it.  My heart is just thump, thump, thumping.  That was the craziest thing.  He scanned the Amish.  Guess your animals got out of their pens, huh? And you complained about field containment.   Greels, Singer said, leave it.   Samuel looked at the floor.  Shut his eyes.  His lips began to move.  His fists clenched in his lap.   Seal wasnt sure what to make of that.  Is he praying? he asked finally.   Mark nodded.  Yes.  Perhaps we should join him.  He looked around the room.  Everyone, we have family and friends that are in grave spiritual danger.  And livestock thats been lost.  Our lives and livelihood are threatened.   A tall, thin man pointed at Greels.  Your people killed our animals! This man had somehow managed to keep his hat, Seal noticed.  It was pressed against his chest.  He looked truly morose, though.  Like a man who had lost everything else.   Your animals? Greels said.  Your animals were trying to eat us.  I wish Id had a gun too.  He waved an arm.  Its you people who brought all of this on us.   Seal scowled.  Enough, Greels.  This is no time for blame.   The old one, Samuel, made a wheezing sound.  Touched his chest.  Shook his head.  Claiming to be wise, they become fools, he muttered.   What did he say? Greels said.  Did he call me something?  Mark leaned forward.  Rested both hands on his knees.  Please, Captain, much has been taken from us, but it is unfair to besmirch our reputation, as well.  This affliction, whatever it is, started here.  On your ship.   Seal nodded.  Yes, we need to get to the bottom of that.  What exactly are we up against? And where did it begin? He placed a finger on the surface of his desk.  Our medical officer, Darly.  Shes been looking into that.  She should have something by now.  A frown.  If she answers  With all due respect, sir, Samuel said.  I understand you are the leader of this ship?  I am.   Then, as a leader, how can you be so blind to what is going on here? To the spiritual state of your people.  The Scriptures teach that evil only begets evil.  Warns of Gods judgment for evil hearts.  For sin.   Sin? Seal asked, glancing Singers direction.   It means wrongdoing, Singer said.  It derives from an ancient archery term meaning to miss the mark.  Every time an archer would miss the target, the judge would call sin.   Seal squinted.  And how is that relevant?  Singer looked nervously over the group.  It has behavioral implications.  The Scripture, the Bible, uses the term to mean actions or thoughts that miss Gods perfect mark.  Like committing a crime, almost.   Seal nodded, indicated Samuel.  So he believes our actions, or perhaps my action, has brought the infection.  Another nod.  An interesting theory.  It might not be altogether wrong.   Dont give them that, Greels said.  We arent responsible for their crazy people.  Their crazy animals.   Seal shook his head.  Regardless, cause is only important now if it leads to a solution.   And for that, Samuel said, we can only pray.   Seal raised an eyebrow.  How do you mean?  I mean, only by prayer and fasting will we see deliverance.  What has taken our people, and your crew, is a power from high places.  Principalities.  Only God can deliver from that.   Seal looked at Singer again.  She shrugged.  You dont have anything to add? he asked.   It would take a long time to explain.   Seal sighed, brought both hands together.  And thats one thing we dont have.  He looked over the group.  Let me explain so we all know.  The pilots of this ship are infected, as well.  They appear to be keeping us toward our scheduled destination.  And we are only a day or so out.   So we can wait then, Jebediah said.  We can leave when we arrive.   Seal nodded.  Yes, but so can this infection, whatever it is.  These changed people can load up the shuttles and go to wherever they want.  Infect one world and then another.  There are protocols to prevent such a thing, of course, but this infection, this behavior, appears to avoid normal detection.   The room got quiet for a moment.   We need to get control back, Singer said.  And soon.   Seal gave a slow nod.  I agree.  So whatever plan we decide on, whatever course we take, somehow we have to regain the bubble.  Seal noticed the confused looks of the Amish.  The bubble is where the controls are located.  Where the pilots sit.  It is at the front of the ship.  Front and top.   There were some understanding nods then.   Seal took a moment to survey those in the room.  There were many women and childrensome being held or sheltering near their parents sidealong with some older folks.  Not much to work with.   Plus, they were Amish.   His stomach lurched, but he didnt show it.  If hed learned nothing else, hed learned that being a captain was as much about appearances as anything.   Mark glanced at Samuel, then at the captain.  Will this plan involve violence?  Seal glanced at Singer.  She was shaking her head at him for some reason, as if in warning.  He looked at Mark.  What we are up against is violent in nature.  I would say all of you witnessed violence just a short while ago, and those things are still out there.  So yes, there might have to be some violence.  At least in self-defense.   Samuel grunted.  Looked at the floor.  Appeared to be praying again.   Then you must understand, captain, Mark said, that we cant help you.   You cant! Seal was so surprised he didnt even ask Singer for clarification.  You cant help with your own self-preservation? To save your women and children? And whys that?  Theyre pacifists, Singer said.   We practice non-resistance, Samuel corrected.  We follow the Lords admonition to resist not evil, but whoever smite thee on one cheek, turn to him the other.  To do anything else would be un-Christian.   Greels laughed loudly.  Thats just great.  Lot of help they are, huh? But youll let us protect you, right? Maybe die trying? More laughing.  Arent we glad we brought them aboard? Once again, they survive on the blood and sweat of others.  Whos doing the bloodsucking now, huh? Might as well go find their animals.  Let em eat us.  Why delay it?  Seal looked at the dark void of his desk, quietly wishing for a simple ledger to move.  A schedule to crunch.  Normalcy.  No such luck.  You must realize, all of you, that these are unusual circumstances.  I dont know how much of the crew is left.  Security is non-responsive.  I havent heard anything from the team that went to check on Bay 17.   I think theyre gone.  Singer nodded at Jebediah.  Unit three got a call while they were on the slideway.  Seemed to be a warning from unit two.  I think they met the animals too.   Jebediah nodded.  Two was one of the words that were said, yes.  But there werent many words.   Seal frowned.  Well, since Ive heard nothing more, we must assume theyre lost.  We must assume anyone who doesnt answer now is lost.   I have a wife, Jebediah said.   I am sorry, Seal said.   Jebediah shook his head.  She wasnt with us.  Wasnt at the bay.  She is back at our room.  A glance at Singer.  The one we were assigned.  Where I was when I first talked with you, Captain.   Seal nodded.  Perhaps she is still safe.  We can try to call her after we finish.   Id like to go to her.  Shell need my help.  Shes probably worried about me now.   Seal noticed remnants of his smashed wall hangings near Jebediahs feet.  A frame broken in two pieces.  He frowned.  Well see what we can do.  It is a big ship.  There have to be lots of areas that are still safe.   Jebediah nodded.  She is with child.   I understand.  He swept his hand over the desk void.  But right now, we need some medical advice.           Darly gritted her teeth.  She found herself thankful for the company of the Amish woman, Sarah.  Even if she had no medical training, it was nice to have company.  Normal, human company.  Especially when she was doing something she absolutely hated to do.   Another thing she was happy for was the mask and gloves she wore.  The body of Candle was laid out before her on the examination table.  Sarah sat in a chair by the door.  She was fine, thankfully.  As was her baby.  A typical false alarm.  That was a small blessing now, but it was something.  Something normal.  Because this procedure wasnt going to be.  She pressed a button to raise the sides of the examination table, effectively blocking Sarahs view of the body.   What are you going to do with her? Sarah asked.   Darly reached for a small triangular cutting tool.  Im going to do some surgery here.   But you said she passed.  Certainly you cant save her now? With your devices?  Darly shook her head.  No, it is too late for that.  But what I want now is answers.   And youre going to look inside?  Darly nodded.  Yes.  The hard way.   Do you need me to help?  Only if you see me fall over.   Sarahs eyes widened.  Could that happen?  Darly leaned over Candle.  She engaged the lightest cutter setting and used it to cut through the clothes enough to expose the chest and abdomen.  The flesh was a grey color now.  Beyond pale.  Just make sure that door is locked.   She could hear Sarah press the doors control padthe third time since theyd been in the room together.  Heard the chiming sound that meant it was really locked.  It was better to be sure.   Darly brought the cutter down.  The flesh began to open, a trickle of internal fluids bubbled up and ran down Candles side.  First, Darly opened the intestinal area.  The upper intestine was a strange color.  Closer to the blue side of the spectrum.  The lower was similarly changed, and given the large amounts of the metalloid that was present, had to be functioning differently as well.   Next came the stomach, liver, and heart.  She increased the power on the cutter.  She sliced through the ribcage on the left side, and then the right, making a large enough window so she could really see inside.   Have you found anything yet? Sarah said.   Darly nodded.  Lots of things.  Lots of differences.  A real surgeon would be more careful here, she knew.  But since she didnt have to worry about closing again  She dabbed away fluids.  Squinted at what she saw.  Shook her head.  Biggest surprise here is that nothing is like it is supposed to be.  The size is wrong, and the placement.  She heard Sarah stand, begin to hobble in her direction.  She glanced at her.  I really dont think you should.  Most people are squeamish.  She paused.  Im squeamish.   Ive helped birth cattle before, Darly.  I think Ill be okay.   She frowned inside her mask.  Well, stand back a bit.  Itll be easier to look away.  Darly manipulated the stomach.  It was longer than it should be, and again the color was off.  A bit bluish.  The liver was above that, also darker than it should be, and smaller.  The heart and lungs were above that.  Should have been above that.  She prodded, pushed, felt around.  What is this?  Doctor?  Darly shook her head.  Pushed the kidney down.  Looked at the spiny thing between it and the heart.  Shook her head again.  There is something here that shouldnt be.  She backed up a bit and pointed, so Sarah could see.  It is connected, like an organ, but it isnt one from the books.  Another head shake.  Its not a human organ.   What could it be?  Id be afraid to speculate.  It doubtless has something to do with what were seeing.  The behavior changes.  The blood drinking.  But what?  On the counter behind her, Darlys medpad began to tweet.  Someone was trying to contact her.  She nodded toward the pad.  Can you get that?  Sarah nodded and moved toward the sound.  What do I do with it?  Darly lifted her bloodied gloves.  Rightumjust pick it up andsee whats there.   Sarah picked the medpad up with both hands.  It is like a small desk, she said.   A what?  Well, it looks like the desk in our room.  I think thats a picture of your captain there.   Ah! Good.  Touch him!  Sarah looked at her.  I beg your pardon!  His picture.  Touch it.           The captain was elated to see Darlys face, but cautious.  There were no guarantees anymore.  About anyone.  So he waited for any indication of change.  She appeared to be doing the same to him.  They exchanged generic greetings.  Watched each other.   Are you all right, Darly? he asked finally.   Yes.  Are you?  I think so, yes.  He looked at the others in his office.  Most looked tired but interested.  Aware.  Doubtless as uncertain about the future as he was.  But they hadnt given up yet, and that was something.  Sodo you know anything? he asked.   About what?  He sighed.  It was his Darly.  It had to be.  The young lady you were examining, Candle.  What have you found out?  Quite a bit, actually.  There appears to be a parasite of some kind.  She went on to recount everything shed discovered, including the reason her scanner had failed.   So it can alter body chemistry somehow? Seal said.  Purposefully, do you think?  Darly shrugged.  That I cannot know.  But it is a fair hypothesis.   Seal leaned back in his seat.  Touched fingertips together as he thought.  He glanced at Singer and Jebediah before sitting up straight again.  Now the question is how.  How did this creature get here? Where did it come from?  Darly shook her head.  I cant understand that either, sir.  Our people are checked out when they board.  Something airborne would be detected.  The only method of discovery might be to trace it back.  Find out where it started.  The first infection.   Seal looked at Samuel and Mark.  It seems to have started with your group, correct?  Samuel glanced at Mark.  Smoothed his beard.  Young David, perhaps?  Mark nodded slowly.  He is the first I remember.  But we never had problems with him before.  He watched the animals for us.  He was very dependable  For the love of Its Congi! Greels shouted.  It has to be him.  I warned you to stay away from him.  That he wasnt right.  Greels paced near the door again.  He was messed up! I saw him.  He growled and pushed through the Amish, moving closer to the desk.  Listen, I warned you too, Darly! Said he was in some sort of weird trance.  And you confined me.   Darlys face flushed.  She stayed silent.   Darly? Seal said.   I never scanned him, she said.  Congi seemed too normal.  And something else.  She looked down and shook her head.  Hes quite persuasive when he wants to be.  There are roses.  Andwell, he was just here, in fact.  Her hand found the back of her neck.  He tried to  He was going to bite you, a female voice said.  Right on the neck.  Probably leech your fluids like a mosquito.   Seal frowned.  Who is with you?  Darly wagged her right thumb.  One of the Amish women.  Shes pregnant.  Came here.  Saved me, actually.  Drove Congi off.   Off? Seal said.  Why would  Jebediah approached the desk.  Sarah? he said.  Shes there with you? Shes safe?  Seal managed a smile.  Is the woman who is with you named Sarah? Because her husband is here with us.  Jebediah.   There was a happy outburst.  Jebediah! Youre alive, youre safe.   Jebediah smiled.  I am, my frau.  Here with the captain.   Seal nodded.  Well get you two reunited as soon as we can.  We have larger problems now, though.  A pause.  So assuming Congis the one, the starting point, where does that leave us? How did he get infected?  Greels grunted.  That man is everywhere on this ship.  Hes like a grave robber.  Always getting into peoples stuff.  If this thing was on this ship, it couldve come from any bay.  Like lice on a rat, that Congi.  Blinking finder.   Wait, Seal said.  We have a thief on my ship? Someone who breaks into packages?  Greels frowned, crossed his arms over his chest.  Oh, come on, Captain.   Excuse me, crewman? Youve seen Congi steal things? Seen it yourself?  Wellits all rumor, of course.  Ive never seen him do it.  Never seen His eyes widened, but he drew silent.  He stared over Seals head at the blank wall behind him.  When his voice returned it was a whisper.  Son of a  All eyes were on Greels.   Greels?  Im thinking.  One hand smoothed the side of his black Well move you t-shirt, making it clear that Greels wasnt as lean as he should be.   So youve seen him break into something recently, Singer said.  Where? Were all in danger, Greels.  As is Obelisk.  Maybe the galaxy.   Greels shook his head.  Cant believe I forgot.  I was so angry, but I let it go.  Why would I do that? Thats probably Congi too.   Greels! Seal said.  Out with it.   Greels bobbed his head.  Yeah, okay.  Remember that science shipment? The one we took on at Maple?  Seal let his palms drift lightly across the surface of his desk.  Nodded.  I do, yes.  The shipment with the cryomatrix.   Greelss features seemed to soften.  Yes, that one.  With the lady in the box.  A smile.  Anyway, there was another package that came with her.  Sealed-up remains, I think.  Wreckage or something.  But Congi got in there.  Opened it up.   It was open when you saw it? Seal said.   Greels shook his head.  Naw, finders are good at hiding what they do.  It was sealed up just like everything else.  But, you know, I notice things.   And you just happened to be in Bay 16 to notice? Singer said.  I thought you loaders avoided the bays?  Greelss face reddened.  Is this about me? I can go wherever I want on this ship.  I have clearance! He looked Seals direction.  I like to check things, okay? Make sure loads havent shifted.  Im a perfectionist that way.   Seal gave Greels a visible once-over.  Noticed the hair at odd angles and the wrinkled shirt and pants.  I can see that, he said.   Whats that supposed to mean?  A head shake.  Never mind.  So Congi broke into this scientific shipment.  The one that came with a scientist in a cryomatrix He noticed confusion among the Amish.  We can put people to sleep for long periods of time.  Store them safely.  Wake them up later.   You store them in bins? one of the men said.  Like grain?  Seal snorted.  Something like that.  Yes.   Samuel coughed and turned to scan the faces of those behind him.  See that, my brethren? The degeneration these people now find normal? Canning people like fruit in a cellar.  Taking them out only when they need them.  When it is convenient.  He threw up his hands.  Dear Lord, what is life to them? Where is the value?  Now just a minute, Seal said.  I assure you, we value life.  And dignity.   We didnt put you people in a matrix, Greels said.  Mightve been better  Greels! Seal said.   Greels shrugged.  What are you going to do to me? Dock my pay?  Seal shook his head.  Id confine you to quarters if I knew we could get you there alive.   The room lapsed into silence.   Finally, Jebediah said, What do we do now?  I think there is only one thing we can do, Seal said.   Darlys image stared up at him from the desk.  Whats that? she asked.   We need to open the cryomatrix.  Ask that woman what were dealing with.   Greelss eyes widened.  Open it?  You have a problem with that? Seal asked.  Shes the only one who could shed some light on what were dealing with.  If this is something that came with herand even if it isnt, she has to have some knowledge that will help.   Greels returned to his spot near the door.  Leaned against it.  But isnt she injured? Hurt?  Her injures werent that severe, if I remember correctly.  Darly looked away, as if checking something on her pad.  Yes, I have it herenothing we couldnt treat.  Burns and lacerations.  Id be surprised if they werent healed already, though.  Matrix sleep fosters rejuvenation.   What about the infection? Seal asked.  The parasite.  Could she have it, as well?  I dont think so, Greels said.   Seal gave him a puzzled look.  What?  Greels shrugged, repositioned himself on the door.  I mean, she looked fine to meyou know, human  Darlys image frowned.  The cryomatrix ledgers shouldve shown the sort of anomalies I saw with Candle.  The heightened metabolism, for instance.  I wouldve noticed that on my medpad when we stowed her.   So we can assume shes fine? Seal glanced at Greels.  Like our loading supervisor suggests? Human?  It would be good to watch her for odd behavior.  Unusual smells.  Darly paused.  Strange teeth.   Samuel fidgeted.  Harrumphed.  She was worried about our teeth too  Seal snorted, shook his head.  So it seems theres no medical reason to delay, but there are Guild rules to consider.  We still have a shipment to deliver, and shes part of it.   Captain? Singer said, this is an emergency situation.   Yes, and this is a Guild vessel.  Despite what Congi has donehas been doing, apparentlyseal breaches are against interplanetary law.   Singer shook her head.  Certainly this falls under the emergency situation clause, article  Forget the book! Greels said.  Weve got roving bands of who-knows-what out there.  Animals.   Seal nodded.  I agree.  I just needed to mention it.  He smiled.  Now that Ive done my duty, lets proceed.  It wont take all of us to do this.  He looked at the desk.  Darly, I hesitate to ask you to leave where you are.  Youre a resource we cant risk.  A frown.  We really dont know whats out there.  And Jebediahs wifewe should try not to leave people alone, agreed?  Everyone nodded.   I dont need to be there with you, Darly said.  The process is fully automated.  The instructions are written on the side of the cryomatrix casing, actually.   Weapons! Greels said.  Weve got nothing!  Thats not entirely true, Seal said.  There are two weapons in my office here.  Per regulations.  But they have limited use.  The energy charge will deplete.   And were dealing with hundreds of animals and people, Singer said.   Seal looked over the Amish again.  A small group, a barely usable groupeven if they were willing to take up arms and fight.  And they were neither.  First things first, he said.  Someone needs to go release the scientist.   Ill go! Greels said.  I mean, I dont like going out there, but if you give me one of the weapons.   Seal nodded.  Anyone else?  You should stay here, Seal, Singer said.  Ill go with him.   Seal winced.  Id rather one of the men He searched the faces of the Amish again, eventually resting on Samuel and Mark.   We cannot be involved in violence toward our fellow man, Samuel said.   Were in a unusual situation, Samuel, Jebediah said.   Samuel didnt even turn.  Some of us still follow the Ordnung, he said.  And the traditions of our fathers.   Jebediah lowered his head.  Yes, thats true.  After a few moments, he looked Seals way.  I will go with them, he said.  As long as Sarah will be safe.   We have the door locked here, Darly said.  And we dont intend to go out.   She gets hungry, Jeb said.   Darly nodded.  I have some food stashed, as well.  Well be okay.   Jebediah nodded.  I will go then, Captain.  He looked Samuel and Marks direction.  I will obey the Ordnung as best I can.   Samuel only shook his head.  I somehow doubt that.   Jeb frowned.  Perhaps the Lord will be merciful.  Perhaps well encounter only animals.       31    It took little time for them to get under way.  The captains two weapons were called short-range thrust movers or sharqs.  They were shorter than the rifles Jeb was used to but longer than a handgun.  And of course, they were blue.  Lower powered, the captain had explained, but easier to handle than the guns Security uses.  Singer and Greels took these without even looking at Jebediah.  It did not bother him, of course.  He wouldve waved the gun away if theyd offered.   What about you? Singer asked the captain.   Well be okay here, he said.  My office is the most reinforced area in the ship, besides the bubble.   She nodded, and after a quick search of the hallway, she led Greels and Jeb out of the captains office and turned left.   The hallway here was a light blue color, broken up with an occasional picture of ships similar to the one they were on.  Jebediah was tempted to study each one as they passed.  But he couldnt.  They were hard to pull his eyes away from, though, because the background of each was some space phenomena that was completely foreign to him.  A planet with rings, or a field of floating brown rock-like objects, or in one case, a pinwheel-shaped construct with a swirling cauldron of light and darkness behind it.  There were words written on every picture as well.  Jebediah asked Singer about them, but she sneered and called them ads.  He had no idea what that meant.   They followed a series of turns and finally arrived at the entrance to another slideway.  It was lit and appeared to be unoccupied.   Were not too far from the bay, Singer said.  A short slide ride, and were there.   Greels seemed especially nervous.  His head was constantly turning and moving.  He held his gun up near his chest, with one hand on the trigger and the other gripping the side.  Hopefully without company.   Greels entered the slide first, but he didnt stop or even pause.  He jogged onto the moving walkway and kept on running.  He got quite a ways ahead with little effort.  Singer just shook her head yet motioned for Jeb to follow.  Running in the slide is a little alarming at first, she said.  Just get on carefully and then slowly increase your speed.  A smile.  Some call it fliding.   Jeb nodded and stepped on, jerking a little as he always did, but he started to walk.  Then jog.  Soon he felt like a deer in the open field.  The walls of the slideway seemed to hurdle by.  He was reminded of a Bible verse: They will soar on wings of eagles.  They will run and not grow weary.  Their hymnals had a song based on the verse.  He found himself humming it as he went.   After a few minutes of that, Greels slowed in front of him.  Jeb slowed as well.  Ahead, the slide took a gentle turn.   I want to be cautious here, Greels said.  Dont want to run into a herd.   Jeb nodded.  It is wise.   Greels snorted.  You mean like going into danger with a scraddlebox woman and a bearded fool who wont use weapons? he asked.  Because if so, then yeah, Im full of wisdom today.   Singer pulled up behind Jebediah.  What did he say?  Never you mind, sister, Greels said.  Nothing that will change anything.   Greels, Singer scolded.   Jebediah looked at her.  He is an interesting fellow, isnt he?  If you mean the type that shouldnt have a weapon, then yes.   They reached the curving portion of the slideway.  Greels focused all his attention ahead.  The next stop came into view.  The lights flickered there.  It was like a gas lamp in a heavy wind.  There was enough light to see that no one was waiting there, though.  The slide slowed and they all stepped off.  The communications screen mounted on the wall was completely dark, and there were hairline cracks in its surface.  Greels noted that with a grunt.  He held his weapon at the ready, walked to the exit stairway, and peered down over the edge.   Singer approached the screen.  That wasnt like that before?  Greels shook his head.  You see that sort of thing sometimes, regardless.  Long trips.   She nodded, and with Greels leading, they moved down the stairs.  At the bottom was a long, well-lit hallway that went both directions.  Jeb remembered a similar configuration on the ships opposite side.  It looked like the way hed taken to get to Bay 17.  He was surprised at first when Greels turned right, but then he remembered this side would be a mirror of the other.  They walked a ways in silence.   You dont have to do this, Singer said then.   You think I dont know that? Greels said.  Loading supervisors arent paid to be heroes.   Singer frowned.  I was talking to Jebediah.   Oh, Greels said, coughing a laugh.  Anyway, it beats staying with folks who dont bathe regularly.   Jebediah said nothing.  Clearly this Greels person didnt like Amish society.  Jeb wasnt sure why, since he guessed that most people in the galaxy had never encountered an Amisher.   Singer shook her head.  Again, I wasnt talking to you.   Ive strayed from the Ordnung, Jebediah said.  But I am still a believer.  I know the value of laying ones life down in love.  The value of Gelassenheit.  Perhaps my involvement will help.   Singer moved up beside him.  Help with what? she asked.   Samuel says Ive lost my salvation.  Maybe it is so.  He shrugged.  The Lord knows my heart, though.  Perhaps He will choose to use me yet.  To forgive me.  Set things right.   Singer shook her head.  It isnt like that, Jebediah.  Salvation isnt a checklist you have to fill.   Jeb placed a hand over his chest and bowed his head.  With all respect, Miss Singer, you wouldnt know.  You arent one of us.   She frowned.  No, Im not Amish.  But I know what the Bible teaches.  And it isnt that.  Paul said, I write to you so you will know that you are saved.  But how could he say that? How could anyone know hes saved if salvation was based on actions? You wouldnt know until you got to Judgment and found out what God decided.  But Paul said we could know now.  It isnt based on your works, Jeb.  It is based on Gods grace.  On what Jesus did, not on what you can do.   Jeb shook his head.  A shame this woman had studied the Word of Gott but had not come to embrace Amisher ways.  Nee, not for me.  I have fallen too far.  Look what Ive brought my people to.   Ahead was a pair of doorsone large and sliding, the other people sized.  White letters were painted on the larger door.  They read Bay 16.   And you think another action will make things right? That you can somehow offset your mistakes? Singers frown deepened.  Thats a hard world to live in.  The Bible also says  Halcyon, Greels said.  What crazy are you two mumbling about? He took a last look up the hallway in both directions and approached the smaller door.  He opened it deliberately, like a man returning home.  Come on.  Were here.           Singer hadnt been in Bay 16 before.  When Greels brought the lights up, she looked with some trepidation at the rows and rows of white-sealed packages.  They were stacked from floor to ceiling, and so many of them looked identical.  Similar sizes and dimensions.  She knew the loading crew used special coding on the seals to determine which box was which.  But lacking that, it would be an all-day chore to find the cryomatrix amidst all this.   Jebediah looked equally awed.  His eyes were wide and his mouth hung open.  A hand came up to absently stroke his beard.  Amazing.   Singer expected to see Greels pull out his com unit and use it to start locating the package, but he walked straight to the nearest row, turned left, and followed it to its end.  He paused in front of a package that was just a head or so taller than her, studied it, and gave a quick nod.  This is it here.  He drifted toward the packages left side.  Pointed.  I helped load it, of course.  And it has a zip seal, so it is easy to remember.  A smile.  Not too many of those in here.   He went to work on the seal on that side, slowly separating the two portions.  When he reached the midpoint, Singer took over, pulling back the flap of material until the dark surface of the cryomatrix was revealed.  There was a transparent section that was slightly frosted.  The scientists face was clearly visible, though.  Black hair and a rounded face.  Reasonably attractive, especially for someone from a profession where appearance wasnt typically a high priority.   Greels stared at the scientists face for a long moment before snapping his fingers.  What was I thinking? We need to strip the seal all the way off.   The process required additional pulling on both their parts.  Even Jebediah helped strip the matrix completely from its shell.  Singer noticed a small bank of controls on the right side.  A green one was clearly marked Resume.   So should we try to contact Darly now? Singer asked.   Greels was still staring at the front of the case.  Lost in thought.   Greels?  He started and looked her direction.  I think we just use that green button there.   I would guess, Singer said, but shouldnt we call anyway? In case something goes wrong?  Jebediah stood to Singers right.  How long has she been in there? he asked.   Singer shrugged.  Weeks, at least.  Possibly longer.  She glanced at the nearby packages.  So where is the one Congi broke into?  Greels pointed at the large package situated directly behind the matrix.  That one there.  I saw some scuff marks on the ground.  Assumed he cut it.  If you look close at the side, you can see where he resealed it.   Singer nodded and removed her com unit from her waist.  Im going to call anyway.  She worked the unit to call the medical officer.  The screen swirled as the unit worked.  She saw Darlys image, the image smiled in recognition, but then the screen started to swirl again.   We need to do this soon, Greels said.  We need answers, right? We need her free.   Singer scowled at her screen, but when the image continued to swirl, she nodded.  She reached toward the controls.   Greels stepped in front of her.  Here, he said, Ill do it.  He pressed the button.   A light on the control panel began to blink.  Next a small screen lit up, and biometric data started to displayheart rate, blood pressureother readings Singer wasnt sure of.   I think I did it, he said.   They all walked to the front of the case.  The frost on the transparent portion was gone already.  Clearly the thing was warming.  Bringing the scientistthe patient?back to consciousness.  Singer hoped there wasnt an immediate medical need.  She had some medical training, but if there was anything serious  She breathed a silent prayer.  Hoped for the best.           Greels could barely contain himself.  His stomach was flipping and his hands felt cold and sweaty.  He squeezed his hands together a couple of times, and when that didnt help, he purposely wiped them on his shirt.  What if he had to help her? What if she needed a hand? He didnt want her first contact to be with someone with hands like a caught fish.   This wasnt how hed imagined it would be.  Their first meeting.  He glanced at Singer and the Amish fellow.  First off, they shouldnt be here, not now.  And not like this, with an emergency and all the pressure to make a good impression.  It was maddening.   The light on the control panels stopped blinking and the screen blanked, taking all the biometric data away.  His heart found his throat.  Was she still okay?  Maybe we should try Darly he began, but then the front section of the matrix snapped free.  Next came a hissing sound and the smell of ozone.  Clouds of fog exited all around the break.  He waited for the door to open itself, but when it didnt, he rushed forward and grabbed the front at the seam.  Pulled it forward.  It swung away.   The scientists eyes were open.  Such beautiful eyes.  They followed the motion, but she didnt say anything.  She studied Greels for a moment, then her eyes panned to Singer, and then Jebediah.  She was dressed in a light blue jumpsuit, with yellow pin-striping at the side of the arms and legs.  Very technical looking.  There were blue slippers on her feet, blue gloves on her hands.   She was even more beautiful than hed imagined.  Soft color filled her cheeks.  Her eyes were blue and bright, her lips full and perfect.  He was speechless.   Im sorry, Singer said.  We dont know your name.  But Im Crewmember Singer.  And this is Jebediah and Greels.   The young lady looked at them all again, pausing an extra long time on him, Greels thought.  She opened her mouth to speak, but only a croak came out.  That was followed by violent coughing, to the point that she almost fell forward.  Greels stepped in and caught her shoulder.   She weakly raised a hand to her mouth.  Coughed again, and then shook her head and put out her free hand to grip Greelss shoulder.  Sorry, she said.  My throat is a little  Greels just smiled.  Shook his head.  Tried to decide what his first words should be.  She was touching him!  Singer scowled.  Ack, we shouldve brought you some water.  A look at Greels.  Darly wouldve known that.   The young womans hand was still touching him.  Yes, Greels said.  Im sorry.  He remembered the water dispenser that every bay had.  Held up a hand.  Wait here! He ran to the inner wall near the middle of the bay, found the square water dispenser and a cup, filled it, and brought it back.   The young lady smiled when he returned, thanked him, and took a long drink of water.  She leaned forward and put her hands against her knees.  Wow, thats really a strange thing.  She scanned their faces.  Leaves you feeling really odd.  Like your skeleton is missing.   Singer looked at Greels, her face showing discomfort.  Yes, were sorry about that.  We have a bit of a situation here.  What was your name again?  It is Tenra, thanks She slid her hands down her calves and, straightening, patted both thighs.  I think my burns are gone.  She touched her forearms and the back of her head.  Cuts too.   Singer nodded.  Cryo renewal.  Theres a positive.   Yeah Tenra squinted, searched the bay.  Are we in a warehouse?  Almost, Greels said.  A Guild delivery ship.  The Raven.   A ship? How did I get here?  Some accident in your science facility, Greels said.  You were evacuated, apparently.  Andwere not exactly sure, but we think you brought something with you.  Something that has changed people on this ship.   Brought something? Tenra slowly stood and looked back at the matrix.  The surface behind her was a dark, foam-like material.  There was still an impression from where shed laid.  I dont see anything I recognize.   You came with a scientific shipment, Tenra.  He pointed.  That large package there.  Something in it got out, we think.   Tenra took a step, and then paused and put out a hand for Greels again.  Whew, walking.  Is the room spinning?  Greels shifted to place Tenras arm over his shoulder.  Let me help you He was amazed at how light she was.  How lithe.   She smiled at him, then looked at Singer and Jebediah.  So you have something on your ship? Something dangerous?  Really dangerous, Singer said.  Bizarre abnormal and violent behavior.   Bloodsucking, Greels added.   Tenra looked at him, aghast.  Bloodsucking? Like a vampire bat?  I guess so.  He shrugged.  Never seen a bat.  Thats an ancient thing, right? Like from old Earth?  Yes  Greels smiled.  I spend most of my time here.   In this room?  Could we get into this later? Singer said.  We are all in danger here.  And the ship is out of our control.   Tenra nodded.  Okaythats not good.  Not sure how much I can help, but Ill try.   You were part of a science station, Greels said.  So you must be smart.   Tenra looked at the ground, smiled.  I dont know about that.   But you were a scientist, correct? Singer asked.  You had to know what was going on there.   Tenra nodded slowly.  Sort of.  Nothing too detailed.  I mean, I had a lot of exposure to everything that was going on.  The experiments.  But none of them were really, you know, mine.   Any knowledge will be better than what we have now, Singer said.  So what did you do there?  I was more of an assistant.   An assistant?  Tenra looked at the floor again, shrugged.  Okay, an intern, actually.       32    Seal spread his hands over the desk.  Panned the faces of those in the room with him.  Forced a smile.  Ive tried to reach all the sections of this ship, he said.  I either get no response or I do get a response, but from crewmembers that appear to be infected.  Or perhaps, given what we now know, I should say infested.   Deacon Mark nodded.  It is a tragedy, Captain.  For both our communities.  My wife, my sonnone of us here have complete families now.   Seal nodded.  I understand.  And we dont know what we can trust.  The only certainties we have, the only resources, are what is in this room.  Do you understand?  Samuel repositioned himself in his seat.  Grunted.  Just because we dont make use of your instruments doesnt mean were ignorant.   Seal shut his eyes.  I wasnt implying that you are.  I just want to emphasize the position were all in.  He pointed at his desk.  This device, the system it represents, contains thousands and thousands of regulations.  Thousands of rules and procedures I have to daily follow.  My life and profession are dedicated to upholding them.  Upholding the schedule were on.   Samuel nodded.  Life is full of obligations.  We understand that, as well.   Im sure you do.  But my point is Seal glanced in the direction of his frizard aquarium.  There were two young Amish children next to ita boy and a girl.  They werent yet to the point of being pressed against the glass, but they were leaned in very close.  Watching.  The frizard seemed unconcerned.  My point is this: Though I have always lived by those regulations, I would be willing to throw it all away to save the people on this ship.   Very admirable, Samuel said.  You would doubtless find that much of what you do is a chasing after the wind.  Meaningless to what is truly important.   Seal would give him that one.  Undoubtedly, thats true.  However, I am asking a similar sacrifice of you.  That, for this present crisis, you would close your rulebook, as well.   Mark leaned forward, placing both elbows on his knees.  You are asking us to forsake our Ordnung, correct? To commit violence.  Even against our own.   Theyre not your own anymore, I dont think.   Samuel coughed.  Shook his head.  Captain, may I ask you a question?  Seal nodded.  Of course.   You claim that you will now pick up servanthood? Forsake yourself for the good of others?  I intend to, yes.   Samuel turned and slowly pointed at the awards on the wall.  One after another.   What are you doing? Seal asked.   Counting, Samuel said.  Noting what you seemingly want noted.   Seal frowned.  I realize they dont mean anything to you.  Im not sure they mean anything to me either anymore  Samuel smiled.  You see why I dont believe you, then.   No  Samuel snorted, clucked a few times before drawing silent and leaning forward.  Servants dont hang awards on the wall, he said softly.  They dont need them.  True servants work for the Lord alone.   Seal frowned.  Duly noted.  He glanced at the pieces of the awards he smashed.  No one stood near those now.  Just fragments against a wall.  Ive begun to rethink things.  About myself.  All Im saying is that perhaps you should too.   Samuel harrumphed.  Sat back in his chair.  I should rest my voice now.   Mark glanced at Samuel, then looked at Seal.  One of our earliest forefathers, during a conflict which he wasnt a part of, found himself facing an attack from the most savage side.  Even then he forbade his sons to shoot in defense of their home.  As a result, he was captured and his family had their scalps cut away.   Barbaric on both sides, Seal said.  To what end was his sacrifice?  To an end only God knows, Mark said.  To the Kingdoms end.  And as an example of true Christianity.   Seal looked at his desk, suddenly wishing to study this Bible Singer talked about.  To understand a little about what he was up against here.  Did Christianity really require non-violence? But there was no time for that now.  This Jesus you follow, he said.  Did He ever meet a captain like me? Someone in authority?  Mark turned to Samuel, but Samuel said nothing.  He only nodded for the younger man to continue.  He did, Mark said then.  I remember one instance when a centurion, a soldier captain, came to Him regarding healing for a servant.   Seal nodded.  Interestingand did he get this healing?  Ya, he did.  Without the Lord even meeting the servant.  Sight unseen.   Seal felt a tingle of hope.  A frail perception of truth.  He brought his hands together on the desk.  So he was welcomed, this captain? Given what he asked for?  Mark nodded.  Ya, and he was commended for his faith.   Seal raised an eyebrow.  But wasnt he a violent man? A soldier?  Mark glanced at Samuel, but the elder still said nothing.  He was a leader of hundreds, Mark said.  So, yes, doubtless a soldier.   Seal squinted.  So now Im confused.  This soldier, this man of violence, was commended for being good.  Did your Lord ask him to leave his profession? To forsake his past and present?  Mark shook his head.  Such is not recorded.   So He didnt tell this violent man to stop being violent? This man with so much faith?  Samuel straightened in his seat.  Looked uncomfortable.  We have no quarrel against such men either.   Yet you wont be one of them.  Wont help them when they ask.  Seal felt a twinge of anger.  Shook it off.  I mean, as long as there is someone else to do the job, right? He panned the room, trying to make contact with each and every face.  Well, Ive got news for you ladies and gentlemen: Today, here, on this ship, there is no one else.           Singer frowned, looked intently at the woman scientist.  So, as an intern, you dont really know much about what went on there?  Tenras eyes widened.  I didnt say that.  I know things.  Lots of things.  But most of it is general.  She managed a smile.  Im a walking potpourri of knowledge, I guess.  I think I can help.   Singer felt only a little better.  She nodded slowly, brought up her com unit.  Im going to try Darly again.  Maybe if we get the two of you talking She found Darlys connection and touched it.  Watched as the screen began to swirl.   Your group, Jebediah said to Tenra, it was concerned with mixing creatures? Blending them?  Tenra nodded.  Yes, how did you know?  Ive done some reading.  Jebediah smoothed his beard.  How do you do it? Is it like a blacksmith or a carpenter? Or is it like churning butter?  Tenra paused, looked at Singer.  Im not sure what you mean  Well, are you working something over and over like a blacksmith works metal? Or are you cutting things away like a carpenter works wood? Churning is similar to smithing, I reckon, but youre turning one substance into another.   Tenra smiled.  A little of all of those, I guess.   Singers com unit darkened.  She made a sound of frustration.  No connection, she said.  Im worried.  She looked at Greels, whose eyes were fixed on Tenra.  Maybe we should try to go there? It is past the captains office, but he seemed to be able to talk to Darly from there.   My wife is with Miss Darly, Jebediah said.  I would like very much to be with her.   Tenra tipped her head, smiled.  Aww, youre married? How quaint.   Hes Amish, Greels said.  Doesnt get more quaint than that.  Horses, buggies, lack of hygienequaint all around.   Singer ignored the comment.  So, do we head for medical? Darly would have the most useful equipment too.  She looked at Tenra.  In case you came up with anything.   Tenra looked at Greels and smiled.  Im okay now.  She politely pushed away from him, standing firmly on her own.  I am a bit hungry, though.   Singer nodded.  There should be some quickfood machines along the way.  Normally, wed take you to a cafeteria, but under the circumstances  Right.  Machine food is good.   Greels frowned.  If there is any left.  We have a lot of hungry people around here lately.   Singer looked at the others.  Are we r  There was a booming knock on the bay door.  Singer quickly held up a finger and brought her gun to the ready.  Greels followed suit.   Another knock.  We know youre in there, so come out! Were hungry.   Greels swore under his breath.  He then looked at Tenra and apologized.   Singer resisted rolling her eyes.  She flipped her gun over and checked the charge.  It was ninety-six percent full.  A good sign, but they had no idea how many of the infested were out there.   Boom, boom, boom.  We got you.  We got you, a different voice said.  Now open up!  At least two, then.   Whoever they are, they dont have access to the bays, Greels whispered.   There was another, louder, impact on the door, and this time the door shrieked.  The four of them exchanged looks.   I dont think thats going to stop them.  Singer held up her gun and motioned toward the rows of white packages.  They needed cover, and thankfully, they were in a room full of it.  Greels nodded and tugged on Tenras arm.  She quietly paired off with him, moving back past the next row of packages.  Singer smiled at Jebediah, and together they moved deeper into the room, as well.   Another impact, followed by a heavy creak, and a clattering sound.  Then laughter.   We have you, a male voice said.  He repeated the phrase over and over, ending finally in peals of laughter.   If you come along easily, well be gentle.   Yes, a third voice said.  Well give you the best spot in the pens.  The best food.  Keep you fat and happy.   First instructs us.  First is wise.  We found you.   The third row had an odd-shaped package at the end, wider at the top than the bottom.  Singer led Jebediah around the corner, and then walked back and stooped low.  She peered around the edge of that end package, trying to see.  She needed to get an idea of how many they were up against.  More than three, she thought.   Oh, no, theyre hiding! one of the earlier voices said.  What will we do?  More laughter.   Who wants to do the honors? Another voice this time.   Thats four.   Several voices said Not me, followed by more giggling.  Singer thought she heard a fifth voice.   Fine.  Me.  But I hate this part.   Singer turned to check on Jebediah.  Gave him a puzzled look.  She had an unsettled feeling in her gut.  The beginning of fear.   Next came a high-pitched scream.  An unworldly and alien sound.  The sound wasnt particularly loud, but she found herself holding her ears anyway.  Next came more laughterand heavy footfalls.   Singer didnt know how she knew, but she knew they were coming straight for them.  That something in that shriek had given their location away.  She quickly stood, and grabbing Jebediahs elbow, urged him to run.   Within seconds, the first mancreatureslid around the corner.  He was clearly a former crewmember, because he had remnants of a uniform on.  But there was just as much missing.  And his hair made Greelss hair seem controlled.  His mouth opened when he saw her, and his teeth werefangs! He laughed.  Found you, we found you.  He sprinted toward her.   Singer raised her gun and fired.  The creature was knocked backward to the ground.  Grunted.  Pulsed with the energy of the shot.  She didnt wait to see what happened next, she just turned and ran.   Jebediah was near the far end of the row, many meters distant now.  He was watching her, though, waiting for her to catch up.  Just as Singer reached him another creature, a female, sprang around the corner to their right.  Singer yelped and shot blindly.  The shot clipped the creature at the waist.  It stumbled and fell to the floor.  Singer shot it again and again until it seemed to lie still.   Somewhere, Greels was yelling and firing too.  The others mustve found them.  We should help  Jebediah pointed behind her.  Look!  She turned to see the first creature lumbering toward them.  He was slower, but the heat of hunger remained in his eyes.   What are these things made of? she said, firing again.  The creature lurched, dropped to a knee, but maintained consciousness.  She fired another time, feeling relief when it finally heeled over.   More yells from Greels.  He was somewhere deeper in the room.  Singer and Jebediah ran toward his voice.  They passed one row and then a second.   The alien scream filled the room.  Singer felt naked.  Fully exposed amidst a full room.  She winced, grunted, and pushed herself forward.  At the seventh row she found the body of another of the man-creatures.  It was still pulsing from being shot.  She shot it again just to be sure.  Kept running.   Deeper and deeper.  One row after another.  Finally, she heard a muted yelp, and she spotted Greels seated on the floor to their left.  His back rested against a package.  There was the body of a fourth creature, another female, in front of him on the floor.  Dead or comatose.   Singer sprinted up to him and stooped down.  Greelss left leg was bleeding, deeply cut, and he was breathing heavily, wincing with each breath.   Shes around the corner that way, he said, motioning to the left.  Theres another after her.  I fired.  Think I got it.  But  Singer nodded.  She left Jebediah with Greels and ran to the end of the row, rounded the corner.   She saw a large creatureanother former crewmembersprawled face-first on the ground.  It was resting oddly, though.  Humped up higher than seemed natural.  She heard a whimper and realized the reason.  She rushed to the creature and attempted to push it.  Tensa was beneath it, gasping.  Together they managed to roll the creature off.   Tenra looked scared and exhausted, but otherwise okay.  No signs of blood.   What happened? Singer asked.   Tenra flustered a bit.  Coughed.  It just died.  I think Mr.  Greels shot it.  It shook, chased me.  But when I thought it had me, it She brushed at her clothes, climbed to her feet.  Well, it fell.  On me!  Singer looked Tenra over.  No cuts? No bites?  Tenra shook her head.  Bites? I dont think so.  Lucky Her eyes widened.  Mr.  Greels! Is he okay?  Together they returned to Greelss side.  Jebediah had already ripped the sleeve from his shirt and was winding it around Greelss leg.  I think hell be all right, Jebediah said.  It isnt bleeding too hard.  Not like he got an artery.   Thing had fingernails like razors, Greels said.   Singer frowned.  That sound they used.  That shriek.  she said.  Did you hear?  Echolocation, Tenra said.  Like a bat.  Well, that narrows down the list of projects my team was working on.   So that sound, it means something to you?  She nodded.   Okay, Darly will want to hear about that.  Singer looked at Greels.  Can you travel?  Greels grunted, and with Jebediahs help, struggled to his feet.  Just get me to medical.   Singer forced a smile.  That was my plan.       33    Samuel coughed again, then thumped his chest lightly.  He must remain strong.  Despite the loss of his wife.  Despite their small numbers.  Lord willing, the community could still survive.  Hadnt Alabaster been seeded with only a handful of their forebearers? Hadnt the Earth begun with only two? Male and female, He created them.  Placed them in a garden.  Gave them livestock.   That family had failed, though.  Alabaster had not.  It had thrived.  Received manifold blessings.  Because they followed the Ordnung.  Obeyed Gods laws.   They must continue to do so, regardless of the situation.   The flooring in this captains office had a pattern to it, Samuel noticed.  Symbols of some sort.  Diamonds and stars.  Doubtless a machine created it.  No man could stitch in such a way.  So precise and fine.  Samuels knees began to ache.  He winced.   Mark laid a hand on his arm.  Samuel nodded and looked at the young mans face.  Theyd lost James to sin, but this follower remained strong.  A true Timothy to Samuel, whereas James had been a John Mark.   Samuel patted Marks hand.  Forced a smile.  Im fine.  No need to worry.   Mark nodded.  I need to ask a question, Samuel.   Of course.  We will find answers together.  He turned his head so he could see those immediately behind him.  For all of us.  The Lord will provide.   The captain sat with legs crossed, elbow on the arm of his chair, and chin resting in that hand.  Waiting for a response from Samuel that would not come.  That could not come.   Yes, of course He will, Mark said.  But for our current dilemma, for the captains requestcouldnt we help?  Samuel frowned.  You know the Scripture, Mark.  The Lord is to fight our battles.  Not we ourselves.  Or is murder no longer a sin?  Yes, Samuel, but our community Marks voice trembled.  He looked at the floor.   Samuel knew that Marks children and wife werent in the room.  They were lost, like his own wife.  Samuel patted Marks hand again.  I know.  It is difficult.  Painful.  But think what the Lord suffered in our place.  Are we immune?  This is breaking me, Mark said.   We will wait for His provision.  Samuel said.  His will.  In his heart he knew, though: Sometimes the Lord gave.  But many times, often without reason, He took away.           Darly stood with a hand clutching her chin, thinking.  The body of Candle was now covered with a sheet and pushed to one corner of the examination room.  Darly had documented everything shed seen, everything that hadnt been right.  Hadnt been human.  There was a lot of that.   Sarah reclined in one of the rooms two chairs.  She held Darlys medpad in her hand.  She squinted at it and occasionally touched the surface.  Shook her head.  It is like Jebs desk, isnt it? But in something the size of a single slice of bread?  Darly grinned.  I suppose it is.  She lapsed into thought again, paced, looked at Candles body.  I think it is a symbiote.   A sim-be-what?  A symbiotic life form.  My first guess was parasite, but thats not right.  It doesnt just takeit gives back too.  Candles body is remarkably enhanced.  Her vocal chords have grown.  Her eyesight has been refined.  She pointed to Sarahs arm.  I would guess she could tell what portions of your skin surface are warmer.  Thats how sensitive it is.  And theres an extra flap of skin on her external ear.  A possible tragus.   And whats that, dear?  Darly took a few steps toward Candle, frowned.  Well, bats use them for locating things at night.  As part of their bio sonar.   All these new words.   Darly smiled again.  I apologize.  Im mostly thinking out loud here.  Bats are able to hunt, to see in the dark, by emitting sound waves.  They send out a high-pitched scream and are able to use the change in the echo to navigate and feed.   Oh, my  Right, Darly said.  Thats a big oh, my, because modifying the human genome is illegal on all Guild-serviced planets.  There was a war fought over the technology, in fact.   Sarah nodded.  Jeb mentioned that war.  Said it was near Alabaster.   Darly shrugged.  I wouldnt know about that.  I think it was fought all over.  But my guess is that this symbiote is a dodge of some sort.  A way of getting around the technicalities of the law.  See, it isnt man manipulating man if you can get another creature to do the dirty work for you, is it?  Darly looked at the floor tiles.  And it can clearly self-replicate.  Maybe one bite wont do it, but a prolonged feeding certainly would.  Expose the victim to enough of your tainted blood, weaken their immune system enough, and good griffin, they become one of you too.   Sarah nodded.  But the changes in behavior? The way it was described, it is like theyre a different person.  The symbiote does that too?  Darly nodded.  There are similar examples in nature.  For instance, there is a parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, that infects both rats and cats.  Or rather, it begins its life cycle in a rat but ends in a cat.  How? By convincing the rat that it is attracted to the odor of cat urine.  The rat seeks out the smell, finds a cat, gets eaten by the cat, and the parasite moves into the cat.  Ingenious, isnt it?  Sarah smoothed her belly.  Grew thoughtful.  Yes, I think I can understand that concept.  Being controlled by something within.   Darly hiccupped a laugh.  Yes, there is some similarity there.  What the baby wants is generally beneficial to you bothso, its like a symbiote in that respect.  She looked toward Candles sheet-draped body.  Except in this case, the symbiote doesnt want to leave the host body.  Ever.  She shrugged.  And from what Ive seen, I dont think the human could survive again without it.  The systems and organs have been so transformed She shook her head.  The symbiote needs to be there.   Sarahs face whitened.  So, theyre doomed.  All of them.   Darly brought a hand to her neck.  Massaged the base of it.  Unfortunately, I think so.  They are no longer human beings, exactly.  I  There was a loud rap on the door.  Darly looked at Sarah.  Mouthed, Congi?  Sarah pushed herself to her feet.  Im ready for him, she said.  Troublesome leech.  He wont attack you again.   Darly frowned.  We shouldve moved, she whispered.  Gone somewhere else.  Im sorry, Sarah.  Im dangerously curious by nature.   Sarah shook her head.  No troubling about it now.  What youve learned is important, I gather.   Darly remembered her cutting tool and quickly retrieved it from the examination table.  It wasnt much, but it could put a nice slash in something.  Sting a little.   Another thump.  Darly! Singers voice said.  Are you in there?  Singer! Darly exhaled, walked to the doorbut stopped herself before releasing the lock.  How do I know youre you?  A pause.  I dont know  Darly noticed the medpad still in Sarahs lap.  Motioned for her to give it to her.  Wait Darly held the device close to the door.  I dont know how well it will work through the door.  She put it in analyze mode.  Watched the readouts closely.  Are there four of you out there? Because thats what Im getting.   Yes, theres four, Singer said.  Greels needs some attention, but otherwise were fine.   Darly squinted.  Okay, I guess I can trust you.  She unlocked the door.   The blond crewmember, Singer, was there with Greels, an Amish man, and a woman Darly didnt recognize.  The woman was dressed in a blue jumpsuit that was unlike anything shed seen on a crewmember aboard the Raven.  She doubted it was in the company catalog.   Sarah gasped and hurried to the doorway.  Jebediah! She first touched Jebediahs arms and hand, but then she leaned through the threshold to hug him.   Jebediah put his arms around his wife and returned her embrace.  You look well, my frau, he said, pulling away.  The child?  Is fine, Darly said.  Normal.  Healthy.   He nodded.  The Lord is good.   Greels snorted but said nothing.   It was then that Darly noticed the bloodstained cloth around his left leg.  Youre injured, she said.  Come in where I can look at you.  All of you, come in.  Lock the door.   Greels took a hobbled step forward and Darly directed him to the seat Sarah had vacated.   The woman in the jumpsuit looked strained too.  Her face was flushed and her forehead was lifted so high it stood in wrinkles.  Like shed just run a long race.  She closed her eyes and began to massage her temples.  Wow, that hurts, she said.   Singer glanced at the woman, looked embarrassed.  Im sorry, Darly.  This is Tenra.  The scientistum intern?  Scientist is fine, Tenra said, still squinting.  Ill be okay, I think.  I just got out of a matrix, you know?  Darly nodded.  You probably need more water.  It isnt much different than scuba diving.  The more liquid you have in your system, the easier the recovery after.  She stooped to look at Greelss leg.  Slowly unwound the makeshift bandage.  Theres a water machine in the reception area.   Greels lurched.  Ill get it for you, he said.   Darly scowled at him.  You will not.  Stay still.  His was a nasty cut, but nothing a synthetic suture wouldnt fix.   I think I can find it, Tenra said and hurried away.   Sarah remained near the doorway.  If you dont mind, she said, I could use some water, as well.  And theumwater closet.   The excretorium? Darly nodded.  Follow Tenra.   Sarah placed her arm on Jebediahs elbow.  Not to worry.  My husband will escort me.   Jebediah smiled.  Put his hand over hers.  It will be a pleasure.   Singer watched the couple leave then entered the room too.  At least theres that.  She forced a smile.  Them back together.  She looked in the direction of the covered body.  Is that Candle?  Darly frowned.  I would say yes, but it is a bit more complicated than that.  She went to one of the cabinets and found some antimicrobial spray and a packet of suture material, then returned to Greelss leg.  He winced as the spray was applied.   A few moments later, Tenra returned with a cup in hand.  She didnt look much better.  Without being prompted, she walked to the rooms other seat and sat down.   Darly watched her closely.  Frowned.  No change?  The young woman smiled.  Actually, just sitting down feels better.  Thanks.   Darly nodded.  Then we need to talk.           Seal scowled at his desk.  Anger ruled him now.  Fear was a distant second.   On his desk, Darlys image was visible, as was another connection rectangle, currently being shared by Singer and the unfrozen scientist, Tenra.  Though she was attractive, and clearly quite timid, he had a difficult time not cursing her to her face.  It was a good thing Singer was in the frame with her.   So let me get this straight, he said.  We havent found any aliens on any planet weve discovered, so your people decided to make some.  Is that about it?  Tenras eyes widened.  Umno, Captain We meant to help.  Really.  At least, I know I did.   How? How does this symbiote genesplicer thing help? Who does it help?  For colonization, sir.   Seal slapped the desk, leaving an impression that lingered a few seconds.  Colonization? He looked toward the Amish in the room.  Im sitting with a room full of colonists.  They all seem normal.   Yes, sir, Im sure they are.  But the world they lived on took centuries to reach the point where genetically pure humans could occupy it.  We were looking for a better way.  A quicker way.   So you created bat people?  They arent bat people exactly, Darly said.  Theyre genetic hybrids.  More than a simple bat-human blend.   How much more? Seal said.  What more? He looked at the Singer/Tenra box.  Tenra?  She shook her head.  I dont know.  I was only an intern, remember.  But most of it is bat, I think.  It was Dr.  Scotts experiment.  He picked vampire bats for their resilience.  And the efficiency of their metabolism, their hunting abilities, their feeding method  Samuel cleared his throat.  We know all about their feeding methods, he said.  Like ticks on a bull.   Yes, Seal said.  Good metaphor.  Thanks.  He drew in a long breath.  Listen.  We are approximately nine hours from Obelisk.  We are outnumbered and have no control of the ship.  If your bloodsucking bat-people get loose on Obelisk Well, I think you can imagine the results.   And until then, were here with them on the ship for another nine hours, Singer said.  These things are good hunters.  They will find us.  All.   It cant be about just survival now, obviously, Darly said.  We need to stop this.  Or at least get a message out.   Unfortunately, the scraddlebox is right under the bubble, Singer said.   And there are doubtless hundreds of these Seal frowned.  Why dont we just call them vampires now? Hundreds of vampires in between us and the bubble.  Crewmember vampires, loader vampires, Amish vampires.   Animal vampires, Singer added.   Deacon Mark lifted his chin.  There is no hope for our people then, he said.  For those weve lost.  No way for them to be restored?  Darly shook her head.  They are modified beyond repair now.  Controlled by their symbiotes.   Which are programmed to survive, Tenra said.  All of our prototypes were geared that way: survival first.   Singers image took on a thoughtful look.  First? One of those that attacked us used that word like it was a name.  Talked about how First is wise.  Also talked about pens.  Like they may be confining people even now.   Tenra looked at her.  First could be a carryover from the bat genome.  Typically, bats are organized into harems, with a single male being the dominant one.   But there are many men on this ship who are vampires now.  Seal looked at Samuel and Mark.  You saw them, right? Dozens of men and women.   They both nodded.  But one young man did seem to lead them, Mark said.  Young David.   Wait, David? Darly said.  Then what about Congi? Wasnt he the first one infested?  There may be more than one group now, Tenra said.  With separate leaders.  But yes, he could be the first theyre talking about.  The real first.   So, Seal asked, would eliminating him change anything?  Tenra tipped her head.  It is all guesswork now, Captain.   But what do you think?  A shrug.  If he truly is First, and if you killed him, there would be some confusion, yes.  Possible despondency.  But I cant guarantee that.  Or how long it would last.   How did he get infected in the first place? Singer asked.  He couldnt have been bitten by another man-bat.   There was an initial delivery method, Tenra said.  A carrier organism.  He mustve found it somehow.   And someone packed it and shipped it? Seal said.  Like it was cargo? What sort of morons did you work with?  Tenras eyes misted.  We had a fire.  An explosion.  I dont know what was saved.  Or who packed it all up.  Only that I lost a lot of colleagues.  A lot of friends.  Her face sagged, and she shook her head.  I was in the matrix, sir.  I dont know.  Im sorry.   You should be, young lady.  I think your people probably got what they deserved.   Singer bristled.  Not helpful, Seal.   But it is honest, Seal said.  Absolutely.  He placed both hands on the desk.  Sighed.  Okay, what we need now are solutions.  Even if Congi is the key, I doubt wed be able to find him.  The ship is too big.  He has an army between us and him.  We are too few.   And we have limited weapons, Singer said.  Were charging them again now, of course.  But I must say, theyre not much help.  It took a lot of shots to bring just one of the vampires down.  And even then, Im not sure they were really dead.  They might have recovered after we left.  Theyre really strong.   And scary, Tenra added.  And heavy.   Seal sighed again.  He looked at the blue ceiling and nervously drummed on the seat padding near his legs.  So how do we stop them?  There was a long silence.   Would there be more weapons, bigger weapons, in the shipments somewhere? Singer asked.   Seal shook his head.  Transportation of armaments is against Guild regulations.  And theyre stringent about it.  It is possible some were smuggled on, of coursebut I wouldnt know what to search for.   Silence returned.   We were brought here in smaller carriages, smaller ships, Samuel said.  Could they not be used again? Take us away and leave the larger vessel to those who are lost?  Seal frowned.  Leaving is not an option.  Not while they have free rein in the ship, and certainly not while were in the slip fog.  So, no shuttles.  No abandonment.   Darly curled her lower lip, looked away thoughtfully.   Darly? Seal said.  You have something?  Its just Congi mentioned pheromones.   Tenra nodded.  Bats are affected by pheromones, just like many mammals.   He wasnt just affected by them, Darly said.  He used them.  Managed to kill Candle with them, without so much as touching her.   So there may be an answer there, Seal said.  A concoction that will disable or kill?  Possibly I wouldnt know where to start, though.   Seal threw up his hands.  Okay, thats a blind trail too.  Is there anything we can use besides the guns? Some way to really stop them?  A stake to the heart would do it, Darly said.  The symbiote positions itself right next to the heart.  A rupture of the organ or the entity itself, and the vampire is done.   Mark scooted to the edge of his seat.  Captain, I think we could help with that.   Brother Mark! Samuel said.  Must I remind you of your calling, even though the situation is dire? Remember Peters failure in Gethsemane.   Seal looked at Singer.   Part of the Easter story, she said.  Soldiers came to take Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane.  Peter, one of his disciples, sliced off a soldiers ear.  Jesus rebuked him.  Healed the soldier.  Let himself be captured and killed.   Mark held up a hand.  You misunderstand me, Bishop.  I wasnt advocating the use of force.  Just that we could build the stakes they need.  He looked at the faces behind them.  We have carpenters and blacksmiths here.  And if there is a chance we can help others, shouldnt we do that? Perhaps well save even our own.   By providing weapons to kill them with?  No.  Pens were mentioned, Samuel.  Some of our own might be in bondage.  Used for food.  Marks face hardened.  Jesus came to free the slaves.  So should we.   Samuel harrumphed, noisily repositioned his feet.  Winced.  What we could do does not matter.  We have no supplies.  And our tools are with our affected members.  I have no desire to return to that place.  I doubt anyone else here does.   Seal looked down at his desk and pushed the images of Darly and Singer/Tenra to the left side.  He brought up the shipping ledgers, searched for any malleable material, specifically wood or a plastic/metal/wood composite.  A results ledger appeared.  He smiled.  Finally something going their way!  We have a shipment of oak from Dantis to Rockport, he said.  It is sealed and stored in Microbay 8.  On the even side of the ship, thankfully.  And very close.  He brought up another ledger, searched for tools, but that returned a ledger of thousands of items.  He scowled, looked at the room of Amish.  What sort of tools am I looking for, exactly?  Mark looked at a man standing on the left side of the room, just in front of the aquarium.   He was dark-haired, heavyset, with hands hidden in his pants pockets.  The man answered Marks stare with a shrug.  Depends on what we want to build, he said.  To make bows and arrows, we would at least need saws, files, or some other shaping device.  String material, of course.  Bending a bow would take awhile.  Perhaps we could construct a crossbow or two But we have limited time.   Seal just stared at him.  Saws and files? He began to move his fingers blindly.  I could try to find those.   Wait, Singers image said.  I know where there are some tools.  Probably everything they need.   Seal grabbed her image and brought it front and center.  Where?  Jebediahs things.  Since he wasnt traveling with the others, I had his stuff put in crewmember storage.  Right across from Bay 8, in fact.   Seal couldnt help but smile.  Singer youre a jewel.  Do you think hell mind? Sharing his things?  I dont think so, Seal.  The bigger question is whether or not the Amish with you will be okay with using tools belonging to someone they shunned.   Seal looked at Samuel.  The old man wasnt smiling.  Are you okay with that, gentlemen? Seal asked.  Using the tools of  Samuel raised a hand.  There is no need of belaboring it, Englisher.  We will use whatever tools you provide us.   Seal tapped his desk.  Very good.  Then with whatever weapons you construct, we will attempt to retake the bubble.  He looked at the clock image on his desk.  We have only a few hours before we arrive at Obelisk.  Lets get started.       34    It almost felt like Alabaster again.   Microbay 8 was a room of considerable size, despite its name.  Jeb reckoned it to be at least as large as the inside of his barn.  The ceiling was approximately sixteen feet high and light blue.  Packages had been transported into the hallway or rearranged to expose a large section of the onyx-colored floor.  Jebediahs workbench now lined the wall opposite the door.   Tools were arranged along the benchs surface.  Three generations of tools.  His fathers tools, his grandfathers before him.  His tools.  Saws, different varieties of hammers, sanding blocks, fileseverything they needed for the task ahead.  Even his glass jars were present, still holding their collection of useful items.   A dozen men were at work, along with a couple of the women.  It was a quiet affair, with little talking.  Only occasionally was there the sound of hammering or sawing or sanding.  The smell of sawdust was heavy in the air.  The men all showed stubble on their top lips now, circles of sweat beneath their arms.   Samuel was part of the workforce, as well, though mostly in a supervisory role.  It was clear that his age was affecting him.  He mostly rested in a chair and had projects brought to him for inspection.  He would nod, and sometimes would take the piece and turn it in his hands.  Squint at it.   If nothing else, they knew how to work together, Jeb had to admit.  The processes were known by all.  The methodology of work.  There had been little food or drink since their flight from Bay 17.  And even now, the Englisher food that had been gathered and dispersed mostly lay unwrapped.  The cups of water were occasionally used, however.  Construction was thirsty work.   Jebediah stood near the door, unsure of whether to join in or not.  He was still officially shunned, even though internally he continually repented for what hed done.  The evil hed brought on his family and the community.  Regardless, he was able-bodied.  He could help, and he was anxious to.   Sarah stood next to him, along with the Englisher woman Singer.   Who brought all my things? Jeb asked.  I thought they would be left behind.   Sarah smoothed her dress above her belly and crossed her arms over it.  Ezekiel, she said.  I think he felt guilty for your treatment.  Wanted to make amends.  He put some of your things in with his, as well.  The milling equipment, for instance.  The donkey.   Jeb nodded.  Silently grateful for his young friend.  I have not seen him, he said.  Not before, when I visited the others.  He shouldve been in the crowd, but He frowned.  I dont think he was one of Davids, either.  He wasnt with them.   Maybe he is well, then, Sarah said.  Maybe he and his family have hidden.   I hope many have hidden.   One of the workers, a carpenter named Joel, searched the top of Jebs workbench, a frown stitching his face.  Deacon Mark was at the far end of the bench, clamping two pieces of wood together.  Joel said something to him, but Mark just shrugged and shook his head.   Pushing away his apprehension, Jeb walked to where Joel stood.  What do you need? he asked.   Joel looked at Jebediah.  Hesitated.  Glanced in Samuels direction.   Mark looked up from his work.  Saw what was going on.  You can talk to him, Joel.  These are his tools, after all.   Joel nodded.  I need a smaller hand plane.  Got a board that isnt quite the right shape.   Jeb returned the nod.  If all is where it was, I have one down here.  He stooped to a lower part of the bench, swung open a side door.  Amazingly, everything seemed to be where it should be.  Tools positioned on the appropriate shelves.  He reached for his smaller plane.  It was a triangular metal tool with a knob at the one end.  Ill tell you one thing, he said, standing again, these Englishers know how to move things.   Joel thanked him and took the tool.   Except people, you mean, Mark said.  Jeb looked at him, but the young deacon only smiled a bit and raised a hand.  That was wrong of me, Jeb.  Im sorry.   Jeb nodded.  He understood.  Everything was colored by sorrow now.  Sorrow and uncertainty.  Can I help somewhere? he asked.  Id like to help.   Youve done enough already.  Mark looked at the ground.  Shook his head.  I think I stepped in it again there.  What I meant  Jeb shook his head.  You have family with the others.  We all do.  I am guilty of much, I know that.  I should be the one to apologize.   God moves as He wills.  Mark said, but he didnt seem convinced.  He pointed across the room to where two young men were hunched over something on the floor.  Occasionally the sound of a hammer strike would ring out from their effort.  Those two are trying to reshape some metal for use in a crossbow.  Theyre full of ambition, but Im not sure they have the muscle.  Maybe you can supervise?  Jeb chuckled.  I can try, regardless.   A few minutes later, he held a hammer in his hands.  He brought it down on a chisel and watched the metal bend beneath it, reshaping into something closer to what they needed.  It felt good to be doing something.  To atone in some small way.   He would be a part of the solution, whatever that solution might be.           Seven hours later, they were ready.  Everyonethe captain includedwas gathered in Microbay 8 now.  They were formed in a circle, with the fruits of the Amisher labor stacked neatly on the floor in front of them.  It was an outstanding achievement, considering how little theyd had to work with.  Seal was grateful for it.  But it still didnt look like much to use against a blood-crazed superhuman army.   They had a small stack of arrows, a similar stack of crossbow bolts, four plain wood crossbows, and four standard bows.  Two of these latter weapons were smaller, perhaps for a female hand.   This is all we could do with what we had, Mark said.  Normally, we would treat the wood.  Stain and varnish it against the elements.  He frowned.  We figured they wont see many natural elements  Yes, we dont expect any rain Seal nodded slowly.  These will do fine.  I appreciate all youve done.  Now all that remains is to plan.   Seal scanned the faces in the room.  The crewmember and Amish remnant.  Wasnt much to work with there either.  I will lead the assault on the bubble.  Im the only one who knows how to fly the Raven, aside from the pilots.  We can expect to meet a fair share of resistance.  If what Tenra tells us is correct, there may be an entire community of vampires living there, amidst what used to be our office pool.  Or we may find it abandoned.  But since my desk tells me the ship is still maintaining course, I doubt that.  Someone is flying us.   Seal frowned.  I wont require anyone to act against their conscience.  I cant force you to fight, obviously, but I hope some will go with me.  I need someone to go with me.  I am stepping outside of my comfort zone here, since Im not exactly a military commander.  So Im hoping some of you will bend, as well.   Singer raised her hand.  Ill go.   Seals heart warmed.  Singer might be the first real person hed ever met.  The first he knew he could count on.  Thank you, but Id rather you stay here.  Somewhere where theres only one entrance to defend.   Singers face was stoic.  Either she was angry that he was a chauvinist, or grateful that he was.  But her expression wasnt telling.  She only shook her head.  I need to go, Seal.  Youre forgetting the scraddle.  I know how to run it.  No one else here does.  We may need to get a message out I can even fix it if I have to.   Seal shook his head.  If I make it, I can have you join me then.   Now she looked angry.  Make it? On your own? No.  Im coming.   I could order you to stay.  You still work for the Guild.   Im going.   Seal tried not to smile, but it was difficult.  I appreciate it, really  Jebediah stepped forward, head bowed and hands behind his back.  I will go along.   Seal frowned.  I need someone who can use a weapon, Jebediah.  He nodded at Jebs wife, who stood behind him now.  And you have a wife and child to look out for.  Can I count on you?  I have given it a lot of thought, Jeb said.  Im the one who brought my friends to this.  I know that if I take up the sword, it will mean He sighed and met Seals gaze.  But I will do what I have to do now.  To save as many as I still can.   A snort came from the portion of the circle to Seals right.  Samuel was standing there.  Are you beyond redemption now, Jebediah? he asked.  Will you take another step toward perdition? Kill your fellow man?  Jeb looked Samuel in the eyes.  I have always valued your guidance, Bishop.  Always respected your position.   And yet  Jeb raised a hand.  And yet, youve already said I am lost, so there are no more steps toward perdition, ya? If you are correct, then what I do now doesnt matter for my salvation.  He glanced at Sarah.  So if nothing matters, Im going to help the people I care about.  Because I know that that, at least, is correct.   Samuels face showed sadness.  He slowly shook his head.   Darly stood to Seals left.  They arent your fellow man anymore, she snapped.  Not even close.   Samuels eyes hardened.  Does that mean they dont have a soul? he said.  That the Lord has no use for them now?  Deacon Mark nodded.  If what youve told us is correct, Miss Darly, they are as much victims as we all are.  They are controlled by evil.  Scriptures teach that all are fallen.  All prone to evil.  On the edge of its control.   Greels was to Darlys left, with Tenra cozied up next to him.  These people arent just prone, he said.  Theyre evil outright.   Two young men raised their hands.  One was tall and red-haired, the other short with dark hairand both had only the beginnings of beards.  We will go with you, the taller one said.   Samuel looked aghast.  What is this now? he said.  More of our youth lost?  The shorter youth shrugged.  We are both of age for Rumspringa.  It is permissible.   Samuel scowled The running around? We havent followed that custom for decades.  A head shake.  This is the penalty for not being more strict with our kinner.   The taller boy nodded.  Our parents are among the others.  We have no one now.  We would like to help you.   Seal was at a loss.  He looked at Jebediah, hoping for some input.  Jeb said nothing, though, instead looking intensely ahead.  His wife had tears in her eyes.  Seal shook his head.  This was quite the team he was building.   Can the three of you use these weapons? Seal said, indicating the pile on the floor.   Ya, they all said.  We are hunters.   Seal nodded, looked around the room.  Is that it, then?  Nobody answered.   Greels? Seal said.   I want to go after Congi, Greels said.  I owe him.   Seal shook his head.  Out of the question.  We cant lose a good man on a witch hunt.  He could be anywhere.  He waved a hand at the others.  Id rather you stay here.  Guard those that are left.   Me and the Amish? Greels said.  Are you kidding?  Think of it as guarding the women, then, Seal said.  You seem to be pretty good at that.   Darly put up a hand.  There may be another option, Captain.   We have to take back the bubble, Seal said.  Without it, everything is lost.   Darly nodded.  Yes, but Tenra and I have a few theories.  Things that might help.   Tenra?  The young lady looked sheepishly at Darly.  Well, first theres sunlight, Captain.  The vampires would be hurt by it.   You mean, because of the bat genes? Im aware that bats sleep during the day.  I didnt know that daylight hurt them, though.  I figured they might get groggy, at best.   Yes, Singer said.  Night or day, it would be nice if our vampires slept at the same time.  But we dont have time to establish a regular sleep cycle.  And were on a ship.   Tenra nodded.  A bat during the day is primarily inhibited by the overabundance of light.  Their eyes are made for darkness, not for daylight.  So, yes, theyd be groggy.  Confused.  And depending on the symbiote, we might get that behavior in the vampires as well.  However, theres another factor.   Seal wore a watch on his wrist now.  A way to know precisely how much time they had left.  He felt the weight of it, even without looking at it.  We dont have much time, he said.  My groupwe need to get going.   I understand.  Tenra looked at Darly nervously.   Darly frowned.  What Tenra is trying to explain is that these vampires have higher than normal levels of a metalloid in them.  Something I think the symbiote uses for energy and respiration.  It is a naturally occurring substance: arsenic.  And w  Wait, thats rat poison! Greels said.  These things have poison blood too?  Darly shook her head quickly.  I dont think so.  The compound lines the organs.  It is why I couldnt view them with my scanner.   We still have a schedule, Seal said.  Lets try to be brief.   Darly huffed.  As I was saying, that level of arsenic should have another side effect.  It would make the creatures skin extremely sensitive to the sun.  In humans, just a small amount of arsenic increases the chance of skin lesions by a large amount.  But at these levels, and with a higher metabolism  The results of exposure would be astounding, Tenra said.   Fire and brimstone, Darly said, smiling.   Greels rumpled his brow.  So we, what, turn up all the lights on the ship?  The override controls for those would be in the bubble, as well.  Would that work? Seal asked.   Darly frowned.  Not the same.  There are no ultraviolet rays in the ship lights.  Too harmful for us.   But isnt some of it helpful? Greels asked, looking at Tenra.  Produces vitamins or something?  Tenra nodded.  Medium wave UV radiation, UVB, is helpful, yes, in small doses.   But we supplement the food for that requirement, Darly said.  Believe me, there is no UVB in our lights.  And the UVB is what we need here.   Seal glanced at the weapons again.  Thought of their upcoming assault.  The schedule.  So we need a sun then.  Fine, plenty of those out there.  But even if we had one  Greelss eyes went wide.  We can expose any bay we want! He looked at Tenra.  Youre like a dream, young lady.   I thought about that, Seal said.  We could open Bay 17 up.  Expose them all to space.  However  Some of our people are still in there! Deacon Mark said.  Some are being held against their will!  Seal nodded.  Yes, I would like to avoid more loss of life.  And cargo.   Greels paced away from the group excitedly.  No, dont you see? We could leave the atmospherics in place, but open the overheads like when we are using the smartloaders.  Let this UVB through.  Give the bad ones a sunburn.   Except the bad ones are all over this ship now, Seal said.  And not every room opens to space.   There are still some details to work out, of course, Darly said.  But if we have a little more time  Seal held up his left hand, the same one the watch was attached to.  We dont have more time.  He gave Darly an apologetic look.  It is worth considering as a final resort  But it may not have to be that, sir, Darly said.  Theres something else Im working on.   You can tell me about it after weve regained control.  We cant open any exterior doors until weve done so anyway.  He tapped the com unit at his hip.  Were still able to communicate.  You can talk to us at any time.   Darly nodded.  Yes, sir.   Seal scanned the faces of his volunteers, and then walked to the pile of weapons and selected a crossbow.  Hefted it.  It felt good.  Solid and real.  Like doing something.  We need to go.       35    Sarah followed Jebediah to the door of the microbay.  He turned to look at her, studying her face, touching her chin, before finally pulling her close.  When they disengaged he looked at her stomach and stroked it lovingly.  Take care of him, he said, smiling.   Sarah nodded, wiped at her eyes.  Nothing will be the same, will it?  He shook his head, fought back his own emotion.  I have sinned much, Sarah.  Forgive me.  I am not a perfect man.   You did what you thought right, Jebediah.  You always have.   He nodded.  I would rather do what the Lord thought right, but it is too late for that now.   Sarah shook her head.  Nee  Jebediah nodded again and turned to join the others, who were standing a short distance off.  Singer and the captain both had crossbows in their hands and satchels of bolts on their backs.  The two young men had bows and quivers of arrows.  Theyd chosen the weapons.  Said they had enjoyed hunting on Alabaster with them.  Jeb felt pain at the mention of their former planet.  If it wasnt for him, theyd be hunting there still.   Jeb took only a sharpened staff as his weapon.  If he was forced to kill anything, he didnt want it to be at a distance.  Abstracting sin was an easy way to continue it, he knew.  To forget.  He wouldnt forget.   The mere act of holding a weapon in his hands seemed to cement something, though.  A fundamental change.  A reinterpretation of Gelassenheit.  One that permitted both passive and active.  Absolved both servant and soldier.   Or condemned both.   They moved silently up the hallway, and through a series of turns, ending finally in the long slide named blue.  They entered at a point past the large bays.  Jeb didnt mention the horde of animals he and Singer had encountered on the slides previously, but they exchanged a knowing look as they boarded.  Held their weapons closer.  On the slide they flided again, everyone moving as fast as possible.  For their part, the boys seemed to enjoy this.  Running like children in a field.  Hands wide, as if touching the tassels of every head of grain.  Smiling.   Again, Jeb felt sorrow.   When they approached a stop marked Locomotive the captain held up a hand, slowed, and when the transparency ended, led them out onto the stop.   Why are we stopping here, Seal? Singer asked.   The next stop is too close to the bubble, he said.  Id rather not step off right into a room of them.   Singer nodded, and they exited the landing to the system of passages below.  They walked in silence for many yards, taking one turn after another.  The halls were all shades of blue, lit by dimly glowing overhead lights.  It was enough to see by, but just barely.  Like walking with only the light of the Nebbit in the sky.   Is it always this dark? one of the young men asked.   No, Seal said, and nothing more.   Jeb gripped his staff tighter, held it point-up ahead of him.  They reached a set of double doors to their right.  There was a square lit pad to the right of the doors.  Seal waved a card-like object over it and it turned green.  The door made a heavy cha-chunk sound as it slid open.  The sound seemed to echo through the hallway.   Seal said something that made Singer hush himJeb assumed it was a profanity.  They entered the room, though everyone showed signs of nervousness.  Eyes darted in all directions.  Bodies shifted so as to never be unguarded or exposed.   The room beyond was narrow, but to their right, through a transparent wall, was a vast chamber.  It was filled with dozens of floor-to-ceiling columns.  Each column cycled through the colors of the rainbow one at a time.  In fact, at any given moment, every shade of color could be seen somewhere.  It was incredible.   What is that? Jeb asked.   Seal only glanced at the transparency.  He shook his head and moved toward a set of doors on the opposite side of the room.  The engine, he said.  The thing that makes the Raven go.  I rarely come here.   It is wondrous.   Seal turned toward the engine again.  I suppose it is, if you squint at it long enough.  I find it unsettling.   Jeb could barely take his eyes off it.  He almost felt sorry when he had to leave.  The next room contained a desk similar to the one in Jebs room, except it was longer and completely dark.  There was a smaller window into the engine room here, as well.   A diagnostic area, Seal said.  We could stop the engine here, but then we couldnt steer the ship.  Unfortunately.   The captain led them on.  They reached a room with a narrow spiral staircase.  Seal led them to the stairway and then up.  The room above appeared much darker and had a bit of a red cast to it.  As they ascended, Seal brought out his com unit, and with an adjustment, was able to produce a narrow beam of light.  Singer did the same.   One more room, Seal whispered, and well be near the foot of the bubble.  He ascended into the room above and stepped clear.  The rest of them followed.  Quietly, they climbed free of the stairway.  Formed a half-circle around it.   The lighting was incredibly dim and there was a faint sickly sweet smelllike rotting apples.  Singer and Seal played their light over the floor of the room.   Wasnt this one of the office corrals? Singer whispered.  It looks entirely empty now.  Where are all the dividers?  There was an uneasy feeling to the room.  A sense of closeness that didnt seem right in a room that appeared so empty.  Their lights reached out only a few meters in every direction.  What were they missing?  Singer took a few steps, paused, and suddenly moved her light all around her.  Hey, she said.  I just felt a drop of something, I  Seal hushed her and slowly turned his light toward the ceiling.   All fell silent.           The microbay was quiet for many minutes after the captains party left.  The individuals in the room drifted into groups.  The Amish formed a group near Jebediahs work bench.  The few Englishersnamely Darly, Greels, and Tenraformed a small group of their own.  Only Sarah remained apart.  She stood near the now-closed doorway, one hand on the doors edge, another on her hip.  She smiled when she noticed Darly watching, but then lowered her eyes to the floor again.   What do we do now? Greels asked.  We cant just wait here.  Theyll find us.   No, we cant, Darly said.  But where would we be safer?  Greels snorted.  In a loading shuttle, he said.  About a hundred light years from here.   Impossible, she said.  Not while the  Greels scowled.  Dont lecture me, I know that.  He looked at Tenra.  This one really likes her rank.  Uses it all the time.  Even confined me.  For trying to save us  Tenra hung on each word, eyes wide.  Darly couldnt believe the internif thats what she truly wascould see anything in the greasy loading supervisor.  Yet she seemed genuinely interested in him.  Latent effect of cryo-sleep? Some sort of bonding behavior? Like hatchlings for a mother duck? Darly didnt know, but she suspected there was a research paper in it.  But first she wanted to smack them both.   Im going to my lab, Darly said.  To the medical office.  I want to test some things.  Try to see if there is another way I can help.  She looked at Tenra.  Youre welcome to come.  Im sure your knowledge would be useful.   Tenra glanced at Greels.  Will Mr.  Greels be coming?  Greels scowled.  Im supposed to stay here, he said.  Guard the flock.   Tenra nodded.  Then Ill stay with you.   This is no time for Darly looked to the sky, shook her head.  Tenra, we could make a difference, I think.   Tenra squinted her eyes together, brought a hand to her forehead.  Ahh! I cant She wobbled a bit, and Greels quickly steadied her.  Tenra smiled but kept her eyes closed, massaged her temples.  I dont know what this is, but I better sit here a while.  She eased to the floor but looked up at Darly apologetically.  I need more time to recover, I think.  You can call his communicator, right? If you have a question?  Darly nodded.  If I could, Id order you to come with me to let me check you out.  But since you arent really one of us She turned to find Sarah standing behind her.  She was listening but trying to appear like she wasnt.  Just the person I wanted.  Darly smiled.  Would you accompany me? I could use some help.  And some companionship.   Youre going to go by yourself? Greels glanced at the group of Amish.  You shouldnt go out by yourself.  Maybe one of the beards will go with you.  Give you someone to trip, if, you know, bat-things come your way.  Just trip them and run.   Darly narrowed her eyes.  Well be okay.  Medical is close.  The captains two guns were leaned against one wall.  She pointed at them.  Ill take one of those.   Greels looked unconvinced but nodded anyway.  Yeah, just leave one for me.  I dont want to use that Amish stuff.   Darly nodded.   Ten minutes later she and Sarah arrived safely at the medical center.  She unlocked the door to find the lights in the reception center flickering.  There was a new smell present, as well.  It was both pungent and synthetic, as if all the centers medicinal supplies had been emptied and mixed together.  Darly thought she detected the scent of roses in the mix, as well.  She brought her weapon up and tried to act like she knew how to use it.  Killing things was not something that came naturally, but she could learn.   What has happened here? Sarah whispered.   Darly shook her head.  To the right, the reception area was completely trashed.  The table was upended, one of its legs splintered off.  All the seats were shoved out of place.  Reading boards were scattered on the floor.  Active artwork torn from the walls.  There were dark smears on the walls, as well.   She brought her wrist to her mouth.  Concentrated on breathing, on staying in control.   The reception desk was out of place tooswung wildly to the right.  She noticed something on the floor behind it.  A heap of blue, roughly two meters long.  Her eyes went wide and she hurried to it.  She stooped and rolled it over.  Swore.   Behind her, Sarah gasped.  Who is it?  Darly shook her head.  One of my assistants, Dixon.  A kind man.  She pushed at her eyes, wiped wetness away.  Hes gone.  She did a visual check of his neck.  It had been pierced in two places.  The same bite wounds shed seen on Candle.  He mustve come in like normal.  She fought with her emotions.  Of course, there was no warning.  No real effort to warn anyone.  No time.   I am truly sorry, Sarah said.   Both drew quiet, studying the downed man.   Pardon me, Sarah said finally.  Could heget back up?  Darly felt a twinge of anger, but realizing the honesty of the question, she pushed the emotion away.  She searched the reception area, found the tables broken leg.  It had a jagged point on it.  It would work.  Only one way to be sure She positioned the leg on Dixons chest and used the end of the gun to drive it in.  Dixon did nothing, thankfully.   Again, Im  There was a rattle and a sound of movement followed by an uncanny shriek.  The snort of a pig with the wail of a jackal.  A chill ran down Darlys back.  Something swooped overhead.  Something large.   Sarah yelled.   Darly turned and backed away.  She felt the air moving above her.  More alien snorts.  She saw a dark shadow swoop into the reception area.  It was about a meter long and half a meter wide, with wings and feet.  The latter clattered along a wall as the animal banked and turned.  It aimed for Sarah, who was still standing in the middle of the room.  But when it got to within a meter of her, it squealed, made a midair backpedal, and moved away toward the hall that led to the examination rooms.   Darly recovered her gun and fired.  Missed.  The shot and the narrowness of the hall seemed to spook the animal further.  It growled, turned their way, attempted to swoop low, but got shaky in flight.  Seemed to lose its momentum.  Darly shot again and connected.  The animal sizzled with energy, screamed, and dropped to the floor.   They approached the creature warily, with Darly keeping the gun focused on it.  It rustled a few times as they got closer, snorted, but then grew very still.  It was brownish-grey and the face was pig-like, as were the limbs.  But above the forelimbs were two long webbed appendages, very much like bat wings.  Black.  There were sharp fangs at the end of the snout.   Is that a flying pig? Sarah asked.   Darly nodded.  I believe so.   I guess weve seen everything now, havent we?  I guess we have.  Darly frowned.  I wasnt expecting that.  The physical changes are much more pronounced now.  Shifting between baselines.  She poked at the creature with the end of her gun.  When nothing happened, she stooped over it and grabbed it at the crux of the wing.  Quick, help me get it to the examination room.  This could be important.       36    Samuels pain was omnipresent.  It saturated every fiber of his being.  His soul wept both remorse and regret.  Only a few dozen of his flock remained now: an even mix of men, women, and children.  Barely enough to sit around the table for dinner, much less start again on another world.   They were lost.  Lost like his wife and grown children.  Like everything theyd left on Alabaster.   It was not about how you felt, of course, but how you behaved.  And he would act righteously until the end.  Even in old age, he would be a rock.  A banner of truth.  That was all he had.   Standing amidst the objects from Jebediahs barn, he reflected on the irony.  On the mockery of making weapons using the tools of one so far from righteousness.  Wasnt that what the Scriptures taught, though? How one sin led to another, even larger sin? A cascade of decadence.  Sorrow pierced him again.  He felt for the souls of those that were gone.  And for Jebediah.  But the Lord had absolved Samuel of that.  He brought up his hands for the others to see.   We should pray now, he said.  We can do nothing more.  There were nods, and the Amishers formed a rough circle.  The two others, the one who always wore short-sleeve shirts and his new lady friend, just stood near the door.  The man attempted to act like he wasnt watching.  But the girl seemed distinctly interested.   You may join us, if you like, Samuel said, smiling.  I will not ask you to pray.   The young woman just shook her head.  Continued to watch.   Samuel only nodded and bowed his head.  He missed having a hat to remove, he realized.  His heart seemed exposed without it.  Oh Lord, we dont know why You have brought us to this present trouble, but we are certain You have a plan in it.  Protect our members wherever they are.  Protect the Englishers, as well.  Save all that can be saved.  Use us as You see fit.  Keep us ever on Your path.  Your will be foremost and forever.  Amen.   Deacon Mark prayed then, but Samuel barely heard what was said.  Though there had been much betrayalby both Jebediah and Jamesthe failure of the settlement ultimately rested with him.  He could not see his error.  He was blind to where he had gone wrong.  He had followed the Ordnung all his days.  Followed it diligently.   But now there was only confusion and sorrow.           Tenra tapped Greels arm, then tugged on it, causing him to stoop closer.  She brought her mouth next to his ear.  The closeness warmed him.  And the touch of her breath on his face? Exhilarating.  What are they doing? she whispered, cupping hand over mouth.   Greels snorted.  A crazy Amish thing.  Calling the wind for help or something.   A religious exercise?  Yeah, they call it praying, I think.  He shrugged.  Better than them talking to me, I guess.  Cause I wouldnt help em.   They believe they are talking to a deity?  He nodded.  They do it all the time.  They believe theyve got a leg up on the rest of us.  A com unit straight to God.  Cant fly a shuttle or run a smartloader, but God they can handle.  He frowned.  The nerve, right?  She smiled.  You have no proof they arent talking to God.  They could be.  Animals dont have com units, but they manage to do all sorts of things.  Communicate over large distances.  And sometimes without sound.   Greels smiled.  Why, arent you the little defender? Looking out for the backward.   Tenra blushed.  Does it bother you?  Greels shook his head.  Not at all, young lady.  I continue to be shamed by your presence.  Makes me want to He felt a wave of nervousness, of sudden insecurity.  He glanced at the Amish again.  They were starting to sing now.  Blazes, they were weird.   Want to what? Tenra fully turned his direction, looked up into his eyes.   So sweet, so perfect.  I want to get out of here, he said.  With you.   Tenras eyes widened.  But the captain saidhe said we cant leave.  Not while the ship is moving.   Yeah, but itll have to stop eventually.  My guess is it is on auto now, and that means itll stop at Obelisk, regardless.  The singing stopped.  Greels noticed the old Amish man was sorting through the pile of weapons.  He selected one of the sharpened sticks and seemed to be studying it.  He then turned it so the point was up and leaned on it carefully.  Used it to help him walk.  Greels rolled his eyes.  Anyway, we can get off at the stop.  Grab a shuttle and just head out.   Youre a pilot?  I can maneuver a smartloader through a microbay hatch.  I can steer a shuttle.  Especially one with auto.   But wont there be repercussions? Someone chasing us?  Listen, beautiful: This ship is doomed.  The chances of anyone making it out alive are slim.  And even if they do, there will be a big mess to clean.  Ledgers to fill and file.  Ive got no patience for that.  Greels grabbed the waist of his pants, pulled them higher.  Me and the Raven have had a good run, but it is time for us to part.   Youd steal a ship?  Steal.  You should see what finders clear out of these ships every year.  A shuttle is nothing compared to that.  Besidesthey can take it out of my retirement.  They owe me big.   Finders?  Thieves, robbers, burglarsyou know, finders keepers.  Like Congi.  The guy who scammed your stuff.  Started this whole thing.  Greels looked at the Amish again.  Really, the beards arent that different.  They just steal other peoples efforts in protecting them.   Tenra giggled.  OhI see.   Greels ventured a hand on her back.  When she didnt pull away, and in fact moved subtly closer, his face flushed.  But he tried to act like nothing happened.  Anyway, we just need to find our opportunity.  Wait for the right moment.  Then head for a shuttle.  Get out.  The Obelisk system has a few happy hiding places.  Well be safe.  Unfound, if you know what I mean.   Tenra nodded slowly.  I should hate that idea.  Im a scientist! But it is sort ofexciting, reckless.  Ive never been reckless.   Greels tightened his grip, smiled.  Well, youve found the right guy then.  Im all over reckless.   She chuckled.  Leaned closer.  And nothing more was said.           It was like theyd left the ship.   Like theyd been hiking a rocky crag on one of the planets that still allowed such things, and had somehow misstepped and fallen, sliding down until they plunged into a tear in the ground.  Slipping, tumbling amidst the dampness of the rock and the acrid smell of the underground.  Landing only to soreness and a steady drip, drip, dripping.  Then looking up to see what appeared first to be stalactites, but after a few moments, realizing the stalactites moved.  And made noises.  And were alive and hungry.   Seal couldnt believe his eyes.  Dozens of hanging bodies.  Dark and slick-looking.  Remnants of humanity, but only remnants.  Webbed appendages wrapped around themselves like an infants bundling covers.  Tufts of fur and skin.  Traces of blue regulation clothing, but hanging from odd places and positions.  Every entity swayed subtly, and if Seal listened closely, there were soft hissing noises being made.  Breathing or snoring? He wasnt sure.   It was terrifying.  And they were right in the middle of it.   His companions were speechless too.  All were trying desperately to comprehend what they were seeing in the fragments of light from his and Singers com units.  The two young men had their bows raised already, but their movements were unsteady.  Their faces were pale.  He doubted they could hit anything.   Seals first instinct was to lead them down the way theyd come.  To find another way to the bubble.  But there was no other way.  Every route led to this very room.  This was the back entrance!  They leaned close to each other.  Talked in hushed tones.   What are they now? Seal asked.  Not human.   Jebediah looked upward, shook his head.  I could not say.  I do believe weve found them sleeping, though.   Singer nodded.  Should we kill them?  Can we kill them? Seal asked.  The angles are difficult, and the first shot will doubtless wake all the others.   They have wings, the taller boy said.  Black devil wings.  He then walked to the stairwell and started down.   Titus, wait Jebediah hissed.  But the boy didnt stop.  He disappeared into the floor below.  Lost to the darkness.  And fear.   I should go after him, Jeb said.   Seal shook his head.  We need you.  He looked at the other boy.  I need all of you.   The boy nodded, and raised his bow higher.   If were quiet, maybe we can creep through, Singer nodded to her left.  The hallway to the bubble stair should be that way, right?  Seal said nothing, lost in searching the faces and bodies of those hanging above.  He focused his light on two creatures in particular.  Something about them seemed familiar.  I think those two might be the pilots, he said finally.  I recognize the clothes.   Their clothes?  Yeah, never much for regulations, those two.  Seal saw shiny tags on what remained of their clothing.  One clearly said Perth.  Seal repeated the name aloud and then frowned.  What was the other ones name?  Egan, Singer whispered.   Seal took a step to the right and studied the other nametag.  It was Egan.  The other pilot.  Whos flying the ship? he asked.   Singer pointed to the left, toward the hallway.   Seal nodded.  Right.  Well go find out.  He flashed his com unit that direction.  For the next couple of meters, at least, it appeared to be clear.  One advantage of sleeping on the ceiling, he thought: clear walkways.  He took only a few steps before his foot found something squishy and moist.  He didnt want to know what it was.  A portion of a meal? Or the byproduct of the vampire digestive process? Whatever it was, it was disgusting.  Doubtless ruined his shoes.  He did his best to wipe the sole clean, whispered a warning to the others, and watched the floor closely as he continued forward.  If he calculated correctly, they had maybe twenty steps to go before reaching the short hallway.  Then came the ascent to the bubble.   He remembered that the scraddle location was in this room somewhere too.  Was that still in place? It should be off to the right, near one of the corners.  He was tempted to head that way.  Possibly get a message out to someone.   No.  Not now.  The piloting controls were most important.  He took another step, then another.   Finally, they reached the short hallway.  The sixteen steps to the bubble were directly ahead.  The edges of the steps were demarcated by thin bands of light.  They wouldnt need their com units to climb them.  They were right there.   He remembered the opening at the top.  The fact that it was typically locked.  Even to him.   Who thought of that regulation? Locking the captain out?  He put a foot on the first stair, lowered his crossbow, found the handrail.   There was a heavy thunk, a puff of air, and the hatch above creaked open.  Seal got a glimpse of the bubble and the fog beyond it.  He could hear a steady beeping sound from the bubble.  A warning klaxon.   Seal felt his heart drop.  The sound meant they were dropping out of the slip.  They had arrived at the Obelisk system already.   They were too late.           Darly felt Sarah watching everything she did.  Sarah sat in one of the examination room chairs, in her proper blue dress and kapp, and watched.  She leaned forward as far as her small baby bump would let her.  Her eyes were wide with fascination.   Darly took samples from the pig and put them on the proper viewing surfaces.  The surfaces contained sugars and blood remnants that should keep the samples alive long enough to test with.  It was critical that they stayed as vampire normal as possible.  Darly verified the cells were still viable using another archaic piece of equipmenta small microscope.  The cells were moving and active.  Feasting on the meal theyd been provided.   All looks good, she said aloud.  She found a large swab, hiked up her shirt, and placed it under her own armpit.   Sarah blushed at Darlys brash exposure.  What are you doing? she asked.   Getting a control sample.  After a few minutes Darly removed the swab, returned her shirt to its natural position, and introduced her sample to the pig cells.  She hovered over the microscope, studied the image closely.   No effect.   She nodded once and selected another sterile swab.  She took it to where Sarah was sitting.  Held it out.  Your turn.   Sarah drew back.  My turn?  Darly nodded.  Yes, I need a sample of your pheromones.  Under your arm should do.   Sarah stared at the swab.  I dont know how Id put that up my sleeves.  The sleeves of Sarahs dress reached past her elbow.   Darly smiled.  Ill turn so you can partially undress.  But do so quickly, please.  This is very important.   Sarah nodded and took the swab.  Darly looked toward the examination table.  It was empty now, Candles body having been disposed of earlier by Greels and Jebediah.  Only a stained sheet remained.   Sarah tapped her on the shoulder.  Darly turned, and taking the swab, hurried it back to her pig sample.  She introduced it, bent down to watch it  She smiled.  I think we have something here.           A shadow moved above him and the ladder from the bubble began to descend.  Seal took a couple of steps back and held his crossbow up.  Next came a piercing wail, a sound shrill enough to wake the dead.  Seal tucked his crossbow and brought his hands to his ears.  He glanced back and found the others doing the same.  The young man seemed especially affectedhis eyes were pinched shut, as well.   The sound ended as suddenly as it began, but behind them were more chirping screams and the sounds of large bodies hitting the floor.  Next came grunts and whistles, movement around the room.  There were intonations that sounded human.  Broken and slurred words.   The shadow above shifted and the semblance of a human foot, yet grayer and clawed, found a rung in the ladder.  Then came the other foot.  There was a floral smell.   Fear screamed in Seals ears.  Form a circle, he whispered.  Backs to each other.   The creature reached the bottom rung of the ladder.  Its head turned their direction.  It was humanlike, but hairier around the edges.  The body was densely haired, as well.  There was a stretched and ripped Guild shirt over the chest.  Otherwise, the creature was naked.  The face had the semblance of someone he knew.  Someone from the crew, but not one of the pilots.   Thats Congi! Singer said.   The creature looked at her, opened its mouth to show pointed teeth, then cackled.  Seal could feel the other vampires closing in on them.  Watching and moving closer.   Captain, the creature hissed, Ive stolen your whole ship now.  It began to laugh again.   Seal raised his crossbow and fired.  The weapon worked like a precision machine.  The bolt flew straight and impacted the center of Congis chest.  He screamed, and Singer fired her own weapon.  Her bolt hit only inches below the captains.  Congi hissed briefly and dropped from the stairs onto the floor.   I wasnt going to wait for a monologue, Seal said.  Now, did that  The noise behind them became manic.  Infuriated.  But not confused.  Not distraught.  It was like being in a swarm of screaming bees.  A crowd of dark bodies scrambled toward them, livid and hungry.   All fired.  Even Jebediah stabbed with his staff, reluctantly at first, and then to protect the man next to him.  He gouged one creature only to pull free and stab again.  Blood flew everywhere.  They were pushed backward toward the ladder.   See if anyone else is up there! Seal said to the boy.   The boy scrambled up the ladder into the opening.  Seconds later his head emerged.  Empty!  Seal ordered everyone into the bubble.  Firing and slashing, they made it up and somehow secured the opening.   The creatures hissed and screamed below.  Banged on the door.   That went well.  Seal scanned the windows and the control panels.  They were in the Obelisk system.  The red star was visible in a portion of the bubble above and left.  They were on the way to the delivery point, but it was still a million kilometers away.  The Obelisk primary world was visible as a tiny blue crescent on their right.  They would reach the delivery point, and more humanity, in less than an hour.   The fact that Congis death hadnt helped them was demoralizing to Seal.  They really were stuck here.   Everyone was watching him.   What do we do now? Singer still looked perfectly beautiful, even with hair soaked in sweat and blood spattered on her clothes.  A deep scratch across her cheek.   Seal scanned the controls.  Tried to remember where everything was.  Im stopping the ship, he said, And then Im calling Greels.  He looked at her.  Frowned.  No reason for everyone to die.   Singer nodded.  Yes, no reason.   He flashed a smile.  And then Im hoping we might pray.       37    Greels sat with Tenra near the microbay door, he with his legs stretched out in front of him, she with her legs crossed.  But her knee touched his leg at the thigh.  The fingers of her right hand intertwined with those of his left.  Despite their danger, it was the best hed felt in a long, long time.  The most complete.  He even felt rested.   The Amish were still bugging him, though.  Aside from their prayers and songs, they always seemed busy.  While they waited they had produced another pair of crossbows and at least one bow with arrows.  They really liked to work with wood.  It was like being in a room full of termites.  If it werent for Tenras closeness, Greels would feel tired just watching them.   His com unit beeped, startling him.  Searching for it on his waist, he brought it up where he could see it.  The screen swirled only a moment before resolving into the captains image.  Seal looked terrible.  Worn and flecked with dark material.   Were in the bubble now, Greels.   Greels couldnt hide his surprise.  Hed figured the captains group dead already.  Blazes, Greels said.  Thats amazing.   The captain nodded.  And Congis dead.   Congis dead? He looked at Tenra.  Their first is dead.   Tenra looked just as surprised.  Any response? she asked.   Seal frowned.  It didnt help.  We have dozens of vampires right outside our door now.  The ship is stopped, but theres no way I can take it anywhere near a planet.  Even if I wanted to, regulations forbid it.   Greels said nothing.  Just made a clicking sound with his tongue.   Right, Seal said, but that doesnt mean we all should die.  I want you to try for one of the shuttles.  Get the remaining Amish to a shuttle and get out of here.  Can you handle that?  I can try, sir.  He looked at Tenra.  Naw, I can do it.  I can get us there.   The captain nodded.  Good.  And make sure nothing goes with you, you hear? Nothing infected.  Nothing.   Well check all the necks, Seal.  Everything.  No problem.   Seal nodded.  I knew I could count on you, Greels.  It was good working with you.   Greels gave a half-smile.  You too, sir.   The conversation ended, and after a moment of silence, Greels looked at Tenra.  We just got our ticket to go, young lady.  He stood, held out a hand.  Come on.           Sarahs face looked distressed.  So, aside from my ankles swelling and having to go to the, what-do-you-call-it, excretorium every hour, youre saying I smell too? She put both hands on her cheeks.  So that awful Greels man is right?  Darly searched in vain for her med pad.  It wasnt on the rooms counters.  Wasnt on the examination table.  Bwahh! she said, and throwing up her hands, moved to the wall communicator.  Hopefully it would work.   Sarah shook her head.  I thought it was just my nose that was sensitive.  But it has been awhile since my last bath.  Im really sorryyouve been with me often.   Pfft! Darly pushed the communicator screen.  When it didnt respond, she tapped it again, harder.  Scowled.  You dont smell any worse than the rest of us.  Greels is a bigoted baboon.   A baboon?  Darly looked at her.  Didnt have those on Alabaster? No, probably not.  The screen began to flicker.  It took her awhile to find the captains connection.  She didnt call him much, so he wasnt near the surface.  While she waited, she ran through all the items she needed.  There was synthesizer in one of the storage compartments in the hall, she knew.  A big, shiny cylinder thing.  I think I remember how to run it.   What?  She shook her head.  Im thinking.  Sorry.   The screen flashed and the captains face appeared.  I can do it, she said, smiling.   The captain didnt seem to hear.  Darly, where are you?  In medical.  Listen, I think I have a solution.   The captains face reddened.  You shouldnt be by yourself.  You need to go find Greels.  Hes leading a group to the shuttles.  Were going to scrap the shipment.   No, sir.   Do I need to order you?  No.  I mean, I cant.  I have a solution.  Sarahs pheromones.   A long pause.  What?  She threw up her hands.  Sarah, she said.  Jebediahs wife.  Her pheromones serve as a repellant.  My cultures prove it.   A repellant? WhaWhy would that be?  Pregnant women, their hormones change.  Their body chemistry changes.  Their scent changes.  Sometimes with strange results.  Particularly with animals.  Household pets have been known to act differently when their female masters become pregnant.  Suddenly fleeing and hiding.  Ignoring them completely.  She took a long breath.  In short, I think we got lucky.  I think Sarahs body happened to create the right pheromones at the right time.  When we needed them.   Seal squinted and drew quiet for a moment.  So what are you proposing?  Im going to synthesize more.  Take it to the air dispersers downstairs.  Spread it out.   To what end?  To drive the vampires away, sir.   Theyll leave the ship? On their own?  No, it wont drive them out the airlocks.  But we can send them anywhere we want, I think.  Any level.  Any bay.   Another long pause, and the captains mouth appeared to hang open.  Can we send them all to Bay 17?  Of course.   And you think this sun exposure idea will work?  She bit her lip.  Nodded.  I do.   Then lets try it.  Ill head us for the sun.   Darly nodded.  Ended the connection.  She looked at Sarah.  Okay, it will take some time to get things ready.  Then I need to take the synthesized pheromones downstairs.   Sarah slowly got to her feet.  Placed a hand on her hip.  What do you need me to do?  Darly smiled.  Only one thing.  Wherever I go, you go with me.           Greels took a last look at the group of Amish.  Only a few of them looked back at him, and then only as a courtesy.  Still felt they were better than him.  Better than everyone else.  More godly.   Ill show them.   He reached for Tenras hand.  She returned the grip, smiled at him.  He led her toward the microbay door.  She gave him a confused look the whole way but said nothing.  He palmed the door control and it slid open.  Without looking back, he stepped into the hall.  Pulled Tenra along after him.   Wait? she said.  Were not taking them? There are children  Greels snorted.  And theyre just like the rest of them.  Let them pray.  Let their God help them.   But what about the doctor? Darly? She treated your wound.   Doesnt mean she likes me.  If shed listened to me, we wouldnt be in this mess.   Tenra studied his eyes for a moment.  Im a scientist.  Im supposed to help.   Helping always ends in disaster, babe.  Dont take it personal.  He took another step into the hall.  He wanted to get away before the Amish noticed.  He didnt think theyd demand anything, but any interaction was a complication.  He looked both ways in the hall.  Grey walls and ceilings.  Blue pattern in the floor.  Nothing dangerous.  Good, the shuttle bays werent too far.   There were quick footsteps.  Someone tapped him on the back.  Mr.  Greels?  Greels scowled, kept walking.   Please, Mr.  Greels?  Tenra turned, and Greels found himself turning with her.  It was the young deacon.  Mark he thought his name was.  Yeah? Greels said.   Mark nodded.  Where are you going? Has the captain called for you?  Yeah, we have something to do.  Greels turned his back, took another step.   Tenra stopped him, though.  Gave him a hard look.  Greels, please?  He shook his head.  Looked at the beard again.  Fine, he said.  The captain wants us to get a shuttle.  Try to fly out.  The ship is stopped, so were going.  Not sure we have room for all of you, but if you want to follow, well see who we can fit.  Old and young first, got it?  Mark nodded.  So our others are lost then?  Yeah, theyre all gone.  It is just us for ourselves.  You better bring your weapons.  And better be ready to use them, because Im not saving you.  He lifted the gun.  This is just for me and the lady.  Thats it.   Mark nodded again.  Thanked him, and hurried back into the microbay.   Greels steamed, but Tenras hand on his arm helped.  Made it worthwhile.   So were leaving the doctor? Tenra said.  And the  Pregnant woman? Greels shook his head.  I know it seems icy, but I already have more burden than Im paid for.  We need to go.           Through the bubble, the four watched as the Obelisk sun drew closer.  It wasnt quite to the size of a basketball on the horizon, but it was close.  They would need to control the hanger screens correctly.  To set them for the right atmosphere simulation.  If they were certain that no normal humans remained, that there would be no hostages, no victims, then they could be more severe.  Bathe the bay in the full complement of star radiation.  The full spectrum.  But with a chance that they might save someone, the shields needed to simulate a Terra-normal planet.  So the worst that the humans would receive would be a mild sunburn.   In the hallway below, they could hear the vampires growling and cursing.  Occasionally one would bang hard on the door.  Thankfully, the position of the hatch made it difficult to exert weight on, even when hanging from the ceiling.  But it didnt keep the vampires from trying.   Their taunts were equally distressing.  We found you, a raspy voice would say.  We found the captain.  We found Singer.  Well pen you.  Well eat you.  First says, First says.   I hate them, Singer said finally.   Seal nodded.  Im inclined to agree.  He smiled.  Listen, if Darlys scheme works, I need you to go check the scraddle.  If that works, if you can get it to work, we need to report what has happened.  They may not come to help us because of the infection.  The war left lots of scars.  Just as likely to vaporize us.  He sighed.  But someone should know what that research group was up to.  I dont buy that it was for colonization.  These creatureswell, theyre more like a conquering force.   Singer nodded.  Military use? Invasion?  Seal shook his head.  I dont know.  But it cant be good.  He shrugged.  Im not a politician.  Not really even a captain.  I just move ledgers around.  Sit in my office.  But if we can save the galaxy from this he pointed to the hatch then I can say Ive done something good.   Singer smiled, touched the top of his hand.  Youve done many good things since Ive known you.  She looked at Jebediah.  As have you.  Youve been heroes.  I  The active portion of the bubble desk began to flash.  An incoming communication from somewhere on the ship.  Seal held his breath.  Prayed it wasnt another vampire calling to taunt them.   Darlys face filled the screen.  Im in the filtration room, sir.  Im releasing the pheromone now.   He nodded.  Asked for prayer again.           The shortest way to the shuttle bays was surprisingly slide-free.  Greels led his group down a long hallway, to a T.  From there he turned right, and they reached a small machine-based cafeteria.  Peering in, he could see the multicolored lights on the vending machines and felt his stomach growl.  He contemplated stopping.  Grabbing a couple of packaged treats for the ship.   But then he noticed stripes of color on the walls and saw pale bodies on the floor.  He formed a wall before the opening with his own body and waved the others by.  No kid should have to see that.  Even an Amish kid.   The experience made him more nervous.  He kept turning and looking behind them, looking between the Amish as best he could.  There were lots of things out there that could eat them.  Sure, there were a couple dozen Amish they might eat first, but he wasnt in the best of shape now.  Others might outrun him.  And he had Tenra to think of.   Next they came to another long hall.  The floor was shiny to the point of looking slick.  Some of the overhead lights were flickering.  Both ways looked empty, but Greels didnt like the exposure.  The next turn was many meters away.   Running here would be better, he said to Tenra.  If we didnt have the kids and grandpa back there.   She shushed him, but then he heard a noise that sent a chill through him.  Grunts and squeals and screams.  It was coming from the darkness to their right.  Suddenly, the darkness was in motion.  He swore aloud and warned the group back.  To run!  But they werent fast enough for what was coming.  The creaturessome human in appearance and some animal-likeroared down the previously empty hallway.  He pushed into the crowd.  Tried to make his way back to where theyd come from.  The clamor behind them continued, intensified.  The Amish were moving but were still bunched up and confused.  Tenra was to his right, eyes wide.   All were vulnerable.   The lead creatures ran by without pausinghumanoid, equine, or bovine.  What the? Greels began, but then a goat was pushed into their hallway.  A second later a hen clucked free and alighted atop the goat.  The goat had extremely large ears, horns, and teeth.  At the sight of the group, it lowered its head and pawed at the floor.  Gave a garbled cry.  The chicken cackled.   The goat charged.   Greels raised his gun and fired but missed cleanly.  The goat zigzagged, now heading straight for Tenra.  The chicken flapped free of its ride, extended black talons, and swooped toward Greels.  It was so fast he could only swat at it with his rifle.  The bird clucked and banked, but finally he made contact, knocked it off balance and away to his left.  He fired.   The animal sizzled and popped.  Screamed until it hit the floor.  A nearby Amish woman stomped it with her foot.  Its emanations ended.   Tenra shrieked as the goat reached her.  Its lowered head caught her side.  She flew to the floor.  It scrambled over her.   Hey! Greels yelled.  He sprinted toward them but was afraid to fire.  The goat was too close to Tenra.  His aim too poor.  He reached the goat and grabbed it by the hindquarters.  Pulled hard.   The goat snarled and turned to look at him.  Eyes red and hungry.  Mouth open, full of sharp teeth.  Another snarling bleat.   There was a clanking sound overhead, followed by a steady whoosh.  The goat bleated, hopped, and shot past Greels.  It reentered the intersecting hallway and the moving hoard of animals.  Disappeared.   Greels scowled and looked overhead.  He saw a mist of something coming out of a vent there.  He detected a slight honey-like odor.   Behind him he heard only silence.   He glanced over his shoulder again and saw just the reflected surface of the hallway floor.  No animals whatsoever.  He called after the others.  Told them to hold and then walked back to the long hallway.  It was empty in both directions.   Greels snorted, shook his head.  Weve gotta get off this crazy ship.           The sun filled enough of the bubble now that any bay that was opened would be bathed in its light.  There were no sounds from below the hatch.  The four occupants of the bubble exchanged questioning looks.  Hopeful looks.   Finally, Seal held up a hand.  He walked stealthily to the hatch and disengaged the lock.  Slowly pried it open.   The chamber below appeared empty.  He laid on the bubble floor so he could lean his torso down through the hole and look again.  No vampires anywhere.   Okaylooks like theyre gone from here, at least.  Go check the scraddle.   Jebediah and Singer both exited the bubble, leaving the young man with Seal.  A few moments later Seal heard a commotion from below.  Then Singers voice came up the ladder.  Scraddle is a no, she said.  Smeared with lots of stuff.  Itll take me awhile to figure it out.   Seal resisted swearing, but it was difficult.  But we have other forms of communication, right? Flashing the lights or something?  Singer was on the ladder, coming up.  Something like that.  Everything else we have is limited by the speed of light.  Semaphore strobing, radio  Which means?  She raised her shoulders.  Means that, from our current distance, it will take some time to get a message to Obelisk and back.  Hours, probably.   He scowled and swiped the pilots desk.  Navigated through the sundry command and control ledgers.  Miscellany galore.  Finally, he found what he was looking for: the bay door controls.  He moved down the list until he found 17.  Lets hope Darlys other theory works.   Singer took a seat in the co-pilots position to Seals left.  If nothing else, we have them contained now, right?  Do we? Anyone want to go out and search?  Singer started manipulating the desk.  Ripples formed and coalesced as her hands danced across its surface.  Soon it was filled with an array of interior views.  She studied them, then massaged a corner of the desk, filling the screen with still more images.  I cant see any yet from the onboard cameras.  Slides, bays, hallways  What about Bay 17? Seal asked.   Singer frowned, shook her head.   What?  The Amish asked for the cameras there to be disabled, remember?  Seal shut his eyes, giving a frustrated sigh.  Yeah, I remember that request.  Seemed trivial at the time.  I mean, there was no danger of theft.  Or violence.  He opened his eyes.  Did you check anyway?  She nodded.  Nothing but black.  A shrug.  Still, if I was to bet on anyone, it would be Darly.  I think it worked.  I think theyre there.   But arent there prisoners? the young man said.  My people? Maybe your people too?  Seal nodded.  You cant just contain evil, can you? He put his finger on the door control.  Lets let in a little light  He pressed the control.  It winked green, then went to red.   Uh-oh.           Jebediah returned to the bubble.  Everyone looked worried.  Frustrated.  Above, the sun of this new system shined brightly, obscuring the rest of the heavens.  Blanking the stars.  The visibility was good enough that he could see dark spots on the suns surface.  It made him wonder what it would look like through the prism he used on Alabaster.   So we cant do anything from here? Singer said.   Seal shook his head.  I have the shields calibrated correctly, but I cant open the 17s doors.  Lots of space between here and there.  Sometimes you see that.  Usually it isnt an issue.   Because we open them locally, Singer said, frowning.  From inside the bay itself.   Seal nodded.  There are two switches there, actually.  One is in the bay control center, the other on the floor.  Not that thatll do any good.  The place is filled with vampires by now.   The control center should be accessible, Singer said.   No, Seal said.  When the doors are closed, the control center is positioned near the ceiling.  Above the room.  He sighed.  We should probably just worry about the scraddle.  Take our chances on some help.  We have the situation controlled for now.   There is no other solution?  Seal looked at Jebediah.  The bay doors wont open.   Can we send the creatures somewhere else, Jebediah asked.  To another room that opens?  Not a bad idea Seal returned his attention to the desk.  Swiped and pressed on it a few times.  Scowled.  Looks like we cant open any of the doors from here.  So much for maintenance doing their job.   Could be sabotage, Singer said.  Like the scraddle.   There were goats all over your ship, Jeb said, frowning.  Hungry goats.   Seal cradled his head with a hand.  Makes no difference now, he said.  Were stuck.   And how long will Darlys pheromones keep them? Singer said.  The symbiote seems to adapt.   Seal nodded again.  Were on borrowed time, no matter what.   I will go, Jebediah said.   Go where? Singer asked.   To open the door, Jeb said.   Seal took a long breath.  Frowned.  I dont think you understand, he said.  The switches are inside the bay.  With the vampires.   Jeb nodded.  They were my people.  Perhaps they wont bother me.  Or think Im one of them.   Singer motioned toward the hatch.  They have changed quite a bit.  At least, the ones that were here.  I think theyll know youre different.   Seal looked at Jeb.  Smiled softly.  Listen, Jebediah, youre a good man.  Whatever sin, whatever wrong your people feel youve committed, well, I think youve more than atoned for that.  The rest of the ship should be fairly safe.  Seal motioned toward the young man.  Ive told Greels to get the survivors out on a shuttle.  You two should try to join them.  Singer and I can handle it from here.   Jeb shook his head.  There could still be prisoners in that bay.  Those that have not been affected.  They are my community.  His throat hitched, and he found himself looking at the floor.  As are you.  A nod.  I will go.   You cant earn it, Jeb, Singer said softly.  Salvation.  It is a gift.  Either accepted or rejected.  But still a gift.   Jeb nodded.  I understand.  The notion brings me comfort.  A quick smile.  This will be my gift.   She shook her head, bowed to look at the desk in front of her.  She started manipulating the void there.  Pushing maps and lists around.  Hiding.   Seal snapped his fingers.  Maybe we could get Darly to douse you in Sarahs pheromones.  That would help, wouldnt it?  But we just used those pheromones to get the vampires into 17, Singer said without turning.  Can we risk driving them out again?  Regardless, it would take time, Jebediah said.  Time the prisoners may not have.  He felt a lump form in his chest.  He scratched his head to try to distract himself.  To mollify the feeling.  Please tell Sarah she is an honorable woman.  A dependable helpmate.  Shell make a wonderful mother.  He nodded.  I love her dearly.  I will go, if only for her.   Ill go with you, the young man said.  Theyre my people too.   Jeb shook his head.  No, just me.  You should try to join the others.  He gave Seal an imploring look.   Seal nodded.  Yes, well loan you a com unit to help you find them He leaned forward and picked up one of the crossbows from the floor.  Held it out for Jeb.  At least take this with you.   Jeb nodded, took the crossbow and remaining bolts, and moved toward the ladder.   Singer waved him back, pointed at her screen.  On it was a wireframe design of some sort.  Like something a builder would use.  This is a schematic of the bay.  She pointed to a square near the top.  Theres an overhead door control here, in the control center.  She pointed to the right side of the drawing, And here, near the inside entrance.  She indicated the top again.  The control center is the only one you can probably get to, though, so memorize that location.  Youll have to climb to get there.   She gave him a moment to take it all in, and swiped the screen again.  A rectangle with two arrows was displayed.  The control itself is just a small screen, similar to the wall device you used to call the captain before, remember?  Jeb nodded.   It is like that, but smaller.  And hearty looking.  Like it can take a beating.  Because they usually do.  She paused, pointed at the arrow-filled rectangle.  It is hard for me to know exactly how the control face will look, because the operators arent necessarily consistent in how they leave them, but what youre looking for is this.   Seal smiled halfheartedly.  The door control operates just like a desk, Jeb, and I know you know how to use those.  Just move things around until you find that image.  Then press it.  The doors will open.   Jeb stepped away from the desk.  Singer didnt look back.  Take one of our com units too, she said.  So we can help you.  Guide you if you need it.   Seal tossed him his com unit.  That works just like a desk too.   Jeb bowed, looked at Singers back, then at the youth again.  Im sorry about your parents, son.  I am partially to blame.   He gripped the ladder.  Began his descent.       38    With a little guidance over the com unit, Jeb was able to find his way back to the long red slide that led back to the larger bays.  He considered fliding again, but decided to conserve his energy.  He didnt know what he would have to do.  In fact, he didnt know if he could do anything at all.  But putting himself in the place of opportunity, in the position to be used, seemed right and just.  So he would do that.  It was no longer about him and Sarah, or the people of Alabaster.  It was, it seemed, much bigger than everything hed known.   Who is my neighbor? It was a question from the Scriptures.  From Marks message long ago.  Jebediah thought he might finally have the answer.   He wore the captains com unit attached to his waist, like hed seen the others wear it.  It felt uncomfortable, even though it was light.  Its mere presence wouldve gotten him shunned on Alabaster.  Good thing he was shunned already.   Of course, he had a crossbow slung over his back, as well.  A double-shunning?  The com unit vibrated and he reached for it.  He was thankful when the image of Singer appeared without effort.  He wouldnt have to navigate its small screen.   Jeb? she said.  I figured some things out here.  A pause.  Where are you?  Jeb searched for a sign ahead.  Near bay number thirteen.   Youre close.  Okay.  Good.  Theres an overlook for Bay 17.  I need you to get off at that slideway stop.   The captain said the controls were within the bay  They are.  But there are two, remember.  Youll need to use the one in the control room.  It is the only way this can work.  Only way we have a chance.   Jeb nodded.  I appreciate you looking out for me.   Singer shook her head.  I know you feel responsible, but Im responsible too.  I helped you talk your people into leaving.   Perhaps we both have sinned then.   We did our best with the information we had.  Were not omniscient.  Either of us.   Samuel would say thats why there are laws.   Singer shook her head.  Perhaps.  But Id say thats why there is grace.   You are a thoughtful woman, Miss Singer.  My Sarah is like that.  Keeps me ever guessing.   Singers hand touched her eyes, and her cheeks seemed to redden.  Youre lucky to have her.  We all are now.  She touched her eyes again.  Shook her head.  Call me when you get to the overlook.  I need you to do something before you proceed.   Whats that?  I need you to change your clothes.   Now you really remind me of Sarah.           Jeb reached the inspection overlook.  The room was a small rectangle, with only a railing on the side facing the bay.  It reminded him of a milking stall more than anything.  Thats all there was room for.  Him and a hopefully-compliant Holstein.  Not Clara.   All memories of Alabaster were banished by the view beyond the railing, though.  The room was dim except in a few places.  The area where the Amisher dwellings had been was now a disorganized pile of belongings.  A heap of used and discarded things.  Portions of the dwelling walls still surrounded the heap, though, as if it was the approved dumping ground for this new community.   To the left of that section was the area where the animal pens used to be.  These pens were still in use, but they had been reconfigured.  Enlarged to hold their new livestockhuman beings.  There were places here where lights had been affixed.  He could see dozens of humans, both Amisher and Englisher, gathered in clumps.  Some sitting, some apparently sleeping.  Some eating.  All looked worn and abused.  Soiled.   What frightened him most, though, were the others.  There were hundreds of them.  Large masses huddled together on the ceiling amidst what hed once thought were support structures, but what he now thought were small pathways.  The creatures appeared to be resting, but they werent still.  There was constant movement and sound.  The noise was a mixture of squeals and human murmuring.  Occasionally a creature would drop from the ceiling, flutter its wings, and find another part of the mass to roost in.  The others would shift and make room for him.  Then another would wing across the air.  Perpetual motion.   On the floor near the pens were other creatures.  Some seemed more human, with traces of clothing and walking upright.  Others seemed less so, moving primarily on all fours.  These latter creatures could be the transformed livestock.  He could only speculate.   There was a definite odor to the place too.  An acidic fecal smell.  He didnt know how the prisoners managed it.   His task seemed impossible now.  Greels was right: They should all try to escape while they could.  Destroy the ship somehow.  This was undefeatable evil.   His eyes returned to the pens of humans.  Friends, neighbors.  Their children and grandchildren.   He had to try.   He contacted Singer and she directed him to a small cabinet at the far end of the overlook.  Inside was the clothing she suggested.  There was nothing about it that was Ordnung-approved.  What is this for?  It will help with what you have to do, she said.  Just put it all on.   He decided not to argue.  Nothing was normal anymore and he was already shunned.  After he was done, he described what he saw.  He even held the com unit up so she and the others could see.  His father had once told him stories of monsters.  He now knew what those were.   Okay, Singer said.  Dont look at all that.  Ignore it.  Can you see the control room? Look at the ceiling near the middle of the room.  Above the loading slides.   Jeb looked up at the crisscross of lines.  Traces of refinement in a world of chaos.  Long, narrow blue pathways.  In the exact center he saw a small windowed cube.  He described it to her.   Thats it.  Now if you climb out on the rail in front of you  Dear lady?  You can do it.  Those shoes you put on will help.  Above the rail is a short ladder, it leads to the bays slide lattice.  The conveyors that help load and unload the bay.  They are smaller versions of the slides that we use to get around the ship, really, except they arent active.  You need to get up there.  On them.   Jeb followed Singers instructions, reaching first the ladder, and then slowly ascending to the nearest slide.  He was now dozens of feet above the ground.  Higher than the highest barn hed ever helped raise.  He stepped carefully off onto the slide itself.   It was hard not to focus on the activity in the air around him.  Most of the airborne vampire clumps were a fair distance away, but occasionally a creature would flutter his direction.  The clothing he wore seemed to reduce their odor somehow, though.  For that, he was grateful.   He crawled along the surface of the slide, wishing the sides were higher.  Wishing he were a little less exposed.  Not far above now was the actual ceiling of the bay.  It was a darker blue.  Not surprisingly.   A vampire left the large mass to his right, flapped for a few moments, and then swooped past his slide before reaching another mass on the opposite side.  Jeb pressed his body low, prayed, and watched that mass for any signs of alarm.  There werent any, so he continued.   After about twenty feet of crawling, he saw an obstacle in front of him.  A three-by-four box.  Sealed in white.  He put a hand on it, tilted it toward him.  It was light enough to move.  The space between the slide and the ceiling was tight now, but it was enough to get the box up and around behind him.  He gritted his teeth as he lowered it into place.  Looking down, he saw the human prison far below.  He shook his head.  Continued on.   Finally, he saw the control room directly ahead and below.  He relaxed a little.  He would just have to step forward and drop onto it.  He raised himself up.  Tried to position himself.   A creature appeared to his right.  It hovered, flapping its wings with long strokes.  It was looking to avoid the slide, but when it saw him, it screamed.  The sound seemed to pound through him.  Jeb rolled back, felt the edge of the slide in his side, and tried to push back the other way.  He instead slipped off the slide completely, managing to stop himself only by catching the edge with a hand.   Another, smaller creature appeared to his left.  It hovered.  Wild eyes in a semi-human face examined him.  Widened.   Jeb realized that he recognized the face.  It belonged to a young girl with blond curls.  One Samuel had once questioned about darkness.  One who had rightly answered, None.  Jeb gasped.   Her fanged mouth opened to scream.   Jeb fell.           Seal felt terrible.  Jeb shouldnt have to do this alone.  What he showed them in the bayit was an impossible task.  Even with the little bit of help theyd given him.  The directions and supplies.  It would never be enough.   Just when it seemed theyd found a solution, another challenge.  Another shortcoming.  How many miracles did they have to perform?  The company policy said to clear the books on this one.  Let insurers and lawyers figure it out.  He needed to be here, though.  As did Singer.  He was glad the boy had gone.  Hoped hed found the others in time.   Greels, Darly  They needed something beyond themselves.  He, Seal, needed that too.  Structure brought him only so far.   He felt anger too.  No man should have to bear anothers sins.  Not like this.   He had more to do.  He swiped the desk.  Tried to communicate with Greels.   No answer.           The smell was much more pronounced now.  It was like Jeb had accidentally fallen into a pig stall.  But worse.   His eyes were squeezed shut.  He was trying to understand how he was still alive.  The last he remembered, he was falling.  But the distance had been dozens of feet.  There was no way he couldve survived.  He was sore, though, he realized.   Jebediah Miller, a raspy voice said.  Youve returned.  Youve found us.   He felt a push on his side, but it was strange.  Little pain, more momentum.  Cushioned.  Muted.   He opened his eyes and found one of the vampires standing over him.  It was large, with a tattered bright yellow shirt covering a portion of its otherwise hairy chest.  The face was leathery but smiling, with bright eyes and mouth hanging open.  Long, sharp incisors.  There was a familiarity there too.  It was someone he had known.  Someone from Alabaster.   Jeb sat up, looked his body over.  His shoes, cap, glovesall still in place.  Singer said there was something special about the items together.  They produced a field? The word seemed ambiguous when Englishers used it.   Are you looking for this? the creature asked.  It held up Jebs crossbow, then dangled it by the strap.  Did you make it?  Jeb squinted.  Abraham? he said.  Is that you?  The creature smiled.  Yes, and you know my sons.   More creatures approached, and each kicked at Jeb with their feet.  He felt the impact, but again, it wasnt as bad as it couldve been.  As it shouldve been.   The floor around him was littered with refuse.  Apparently hed landed on a great spongy pile of it, he realized.  He could see the prisoner pen ahead and to his left.  There were some people standing at the fence there.  Watching.  All looking helpless.  Sad.   More vampires encircled him.  All seemed remotely recognizable.  Abrahams son, David, was among them.  No longer as in charge as he was when last Jeb had seen him.  No longer as handsome.  Leathery and hairy.   There were females too, barely covered.  Slinking and dancing around him.  All put out hands or feet.  All attempted to scratch or claw, hit, or kick.  They growled and screamed.   But few of the attacks got through.  He almost laughed.  It was like a game.  A fight with down pillows.   Eventually the games would end, though.  And he doubted the suits effects were permanent.  Nothing in life was.   Another vampire rushed straight at him, jumped on his back, and attempted to bury its face in his neck.  He felt a pinch, but no skin was broken.  No blood.  The vampire screamed.   He has something protecting him, one said.  It is like a feed sack all around him.   A device, someoneno, it was Deacon Jamessaid.  An Englisher device.  They have lots of devices.   We have devices too, another said.  That one brandished one of the Englisher weapons.  Fired it.   Jeb fell to the floor.  It hurt, the shot.  Hurt a lot.  But he was still breathing.  Singers shield suit protected him again.   We have a community here, Jebediah, James said.  One anyone can be a part of.  One youll never be shunned from.  Can never fail.   And were powerful.  Abraham brought up a hairy fist.  Strong.  Better.   Dont you want to join us? David asked.  There is no Ordnung, few rules.  We survive.  Multiply.  Feast.   Join us, others echoed.  We found you.   The weapon bolt hit him again.  Jeb was thrown forward.  He smashed to the floor, a few dozen feet from where the shelters used to be.  Next to what was now the largest refuse pile.  His knees and back ached.  He got up on all fours, then remembered the com unit.  He checked that it was still attached to his waist.  It was.   What is the smell? James asked.  Outside? The one that makes us want to flee? We hate it.   Jeb managed a smile.  You wouldnt believe me if told you.   We will survive.  We will grow.  Endure.   Jeb had a hard time arguing.  Dear Lord he breathed.   Another gun rose.           The door to the shuttle hanger opened, and before them were four of the three-legged landing shuttles.  All looked unmolested.  There were a couple of uniformed bodies on the floor, though.  Security or crewmember types.  Not part of the loading team.  Not union.  That was little comfort, though.  Greels didnt want the Amish kids to see that either.  Even if they were Amish.   Anyway, it reminded him of how quick they needed to be.  The vampires appeared to be gone now, but he had no confidence that they would stay that way.  Better to be off the ship.  Safe.  He gripped Tenras hand, smiled at her.  Looked back at the group of Amish that remained.  Mostly women and children.  And older men.   Theyd lost some along the way.  A boy had shown up and there had been a conversation.  Lots of Lord-this, scripture-that, and Ordnung-whatever.  Then some of the more able-bodied had abandoned them.  Theyd seemed reluctant to leave the ship without knowing where the monsters had gone.  Or being certain about the rest of their group.  Something.   Greels frowned.  The Amish were crazy.  Now was not the time for sightseeing.   Okay, were going to make this quick, he said.  Going to use the first shuttle here.  Im going to open the back door and check that it is clear.  He grinned halfheartedly.  Ive seen enough horror vids to always check the shuttle first, right?  The Amish only stared at him.   He snorted, glanced at Tenra.  Look who Im talking to here A shake of his head.  Anyway, when Im done looking inside, youre all going to hustle on.  Then were leaving.  No waiting for nothing, understand?  No one said anything.   Greels nodded.  Good.  No questions was a good sign.  He looked at Tenra again.  Such a beautiful thing.  He could love her forever.   She smiled.           The abuse seemed to go on forever.  He was prodded, kicked, shot, and cajoled.  And with every gunshot, the field around him seemed to be weakened.  Every hit thereafter seemed to be harder.  More painful.  They had somehow worked their way nearly all the way around the refuse heapthe dwelling area.  He could see the doors that left the bay, but they might as well be a mile away.  There were dozens of angry vampires between him and the doors.   He also saw a glowing control board there.  Wondered if that was what he needed to operate.  A few times he felt the com unit move at his hip, but always another attack would come.  He thought of Sarah.  Of how he hoped she was getting away.  She should be safe.  And the child.  His child.   Funny how the childs presence had already changed things.  Would that it would ever be so.           Samuel eased himself onto the flying carriage floor.  His knees seemed to have worsened while on the leviathan.  Even the weapon hed turned into a walking stick didnt seem to be much help.  And all the running.  He wasnt sure how hed made it.  He wondered if his wifes aches had gone away with the coming of the fever.  With her change.  Probably they had.  Sin always had its benefits.  Its pleasures.  All end in death.   Women and children gathered around him.  Samuel tipped his head, tried to make room for more on the floor.  This was what the Lord had left him with: a smaller flock.  Nearly fatherless and lost.  Would they even have a home now?  Oh Lord, for even a leaf to keep the sun from my head.  Samuel shook his head.  He missed his hat.   This Greels man was already in the front drivers seat.  Samuel could see him through the still open doorway.  His illicit female friend was standing near that same door, watching them all.  Samuel didnt approve of her either.  Someone who had been frozen and then thawed out? Suspicious.   And also worthy of pity.  In need of Gods mercy and justice.   She looked his direction.  He made a motion with his hand.  Smiled.   She stepped closer.  Yes?  Young miss, where will you be taking us?  Her eyes brightened.  Oh, theres a nice blue planet not far from here.  Lots of people.  Clothing, shelter, food.  Obelisk.  I really like it.  She glanced toward the front, tipped her head thoughtfully.  But mostly were getting out of here.  Surviving.  It is all about survival, right?  Samuel narrowed his eyes.  Didnt answer, only acknowledged with a nod and a muted thank you.   He felt strange.  He bowed his head.           The com unit fell from his body.  It was kicked and then crushed.  Jeb hurt all over.  He could barely stand.   And the smell was overpowering.  Rot and death.  Pain and fear.  Lust and greed.   I think your shield is gone now.  Abraham struck him and then bent over him when he fell.  Smiled.  And now it is time for you to join us.  He grabbed Jebediahs right arm.  Pulled him up to bring his head near Jebs shoulder and neck.   It should be me first, James said.  Im your Deacon.   No, me, David said.  I started all this.  Made us a real community.   Jebediah groaned.  He wished theyd just kill him instead.  They were slaves now.  All of them.  Willing victims.   Me!  No! Me! Abraham screamed.  He pulled himself up.  Bared his teeth.  Me.   Something hit Abraham dead in the chest then.  His eyes widened, and clawed hands reached for the object.  He touched the stump of it but couldnt pull it out.  His face blanched.  He fell backward.   Jebediah looked in the direction the shot had come from.  Gasped.  Breathed hard.  There was Deacon Mark, crossbow in hand.  And other men.  At least fifteen.  The blond-haired boy was there too.  Jebediah crawled toward them.   There were screams.  High-pitched and shrill.  Followed by more shots and more screams.   More dark bodies began to fall from the ceiling.  More and more.  A cloud of them.  It was difficult not to fear.  To even see.   Are you all right, Jebediah? Mark said, helping Jeb to stand.   Never mind me.  Jeb looked about for the com unit.  Couldnt see it anywhere.   There are too many of them! someone shouted.   Waves of screams.  The air moving.  Attacks from above.  The Amishers continued to fire.  Vampires fell dead.  But more came.   Jeb held his hand over his nose.  Fixed his eyes on the control pad on the wall.  Stumbled toward it.  He thought of the desk.  How hed navigated it.  He swiped at the control, and felt relief when it responded.   Now what?          Greels felt better when Tenra joined him in the cockpit.  It was like all the tension he was feeling disappeared.  The grey hanger doors began to open.  The blackness of space became visible.  The stars.   When the way was clear, he engaged the engine and brought the shuttle up and forward.  It had been awhile since hed piloted a shuttle.  It wasnt quite as touchy as a smartloader.  A little more forgiving.  For that, he was grateful.  They exited the side of the ship and flew into open space.  Obelisks sun was to their right.  It dwarfed the body of the Raven.  Made Greels feel incredibly small.   He looked to the left, searched for the blue disk of Obelisk.  The loading station would be in orbit around it.  He should be able to find it.  Then theyd get another shuttle down.  Start enjoying life again.  Forget about the nightmare.  Congi, Foley, Candle, the flipping animals, Amish, everything.  Especially the Amish.  He pointed the ship in the right direction.  Set auto mode.  Leaned back.  Tried to relax.   He could feel Tenras presence.  She slid around behind him.  Put her hands on his shoulder.  You saved us, she said.  Saved me.  I dont know how to repay you.   It is fine.  My pleasure.  What I wanted to do.   Her hands slid down his arms.  He could feel her face near his ear.  Still, I need to reward you.  Somehow.   He smiled.  Enjoyed her nearness.  Her lips were on his neck now.  Kissing, moving, kissing again.   Then he felt pain.  She was biting him! What are you?  Space seemed to swim a bit.  The stars seemed to blur.   No  There was a retching sound, and the pressure on his neck eased.  His head seemed to clear.  A weight fell off of him and there was a heavy thump.   He turned and saw Tenras prone body, her pretty face smashed into the floor.  Protruding from her back was a wooden stick.   Standing over her, eyes wide and lips trembling, was an old man.  An Amish man.   Greels stood, and the man mustve thought that Greels was going to attack him, because he slumped to the floor.  Began to weep.   Greelss head suddenly felt strange.  Achy.  Like a minor hangover.  He squinted and rubbed his temples, neck.  He looked through the doorway and saw all the Amish watching him.  What was I thinking? He shook his head.  What was I on? I think she was messing with me somehow.  He looked at the weeping Amisher.  You saved me, old man.           There were screams.  Lots of bone-shaking screams.   Then, as if someone had flipped a switch, the vampires seemed to lose focus.  The attacks from above ceased.  Instead, the airborne only fluttered and swirled.  There were hollow thonks as some collided with the slides and rafters or with one another.  Those on the ground shambled around, taking ill-timed swipes with their hands.  They were angry and dangerous, yet disorganized.   Jeb was now able to think.  To concentrate on the controls.  Pictures moved amidst the void.  Rotated and spun.  He saw a shape that looked promising.  A long rectangle with arrows.  He brought it front and center.  Pressed it.   There was a heavy thump and a clank.  The dark roof started to open.  Sunlight streamed in.  Warm and beautiful.  Like summer on Alabaster.  A day by the river.   Screams.  Vampire hands reaching to leathery faces in agony.  Massive sores grew as he watched.  Like the leprosy of the Bible.  But faster.  Eating away at bodies like cancer until only piles of charcoal remained.   The Amisher men looked at each other, laughed, clapped hands to backs.  An emotional display unsanctioned by any Ordnung.  They then hurried to the prisoner pen.  Opened gates.  Hugged and yelled names: Deborah, EsterEzekiel! Friend Ezekiel! Youre alive!  Jebediah hugged his friend.  Hugged everyone.   Then he dropped to his knees.  And wept.       EPILOGUE    OBELISK LOADING STATIONFOUR DAYS LATER    Jebediah stood before one of the stations observation windows.  Dominating the view was the large globe of Obelisk.  It was an even mix of deep blue, warm brown, and medium green.  There were scattered wisps of clouds and solid white circles at both poles.  A slender portion of the world was under the shadow of night.   Sarah stood with him.  She reached out a hand to touch his, snagged a finger, then claimed his whole hand.  I once thought views like these were forbidden, she said.  Ones that only God was supposed to have.  Now Im not so sure.   Jebediah turned to look at her.  She wore a simple green dress but no kapp.  Her hair was tied back in a loose bun.  There was a bit of color to her cheeks.  The bump of the coming child was clearly evident.  He smiled.  It is beautiful, isnt it? He drew her closer, put an arm around her.  But you are just as beautiful.  And may you never be forbidden.   I wont be, she said.  Ever.   Jebediah caught movement out of the corner of his eye.  Smiled when he saw Seal and Singer approaching.  The former was in beige pants and a black shirt.  The latter was in a dress that seemed to change color as he watched itred, then purple, then blue.  Neither was Guild-approved, Jeb guessed, but they seemed happy.   Seal searched Jeb and Sarahs faces.  Raised an eyebrow.  You are sure about this?  Jebediah nodded.  At least until after the baby has arrived.  He winked at Sarah.  Until weve determined what community, or what sort of community, were supposed to serve.   Well, if you change your mind, the Guild has agreed to pay for transit to any planet they serve.  Including the new Amish world.   Jeb nodded.  We appreciate the kindness.   Singer frowned, lowered her head.  Sorry.  I still think they could use you as a leader.  With the loss of James and Samuel.   Samuel will be there, Jeb said.  Though he resigned as Bishop, I cant imagine hell be quiet forever.  It isnt in his nature.  And if he finds it in his nature there, then good on him.  I wish him only peace.   Mark will be a great servant, Sarah added, giving Jebs arm a squeeze.  And we suggested Ezekiel as one of the replacement deacons.  Hes young, but he has good sense.  Hopefully, hell get selected to be in the lot.  Then the rest will be up to the Lord.   Singer smiled at Jebediah.  And He has a way of picking the right man for the job.   He frowned, but nodded slowly.  I suppose thats true.   They fell into silence for a moment.  Jeb glanced at the window again, at the blue sphere of Obelisk below.  What will you do now, Mr.  Drake? he asked then.   Seal shrugged.  I dont know.  Something different, something active.  Involved.  Not requiring a desk.   We might go to where I grew up, Singer said.  Its a production planetcrops mostlybut a little more high tech than Alabaster was, of course.  She looked at Seal.  Itll give him a chance to get his hands dirty.  Try different things.   Were so sorry about your employment, Sarah said.  Or the ending of it.   Seal shrugged.  Guild rules.  Though the shipment was as intact as it could be, they were forced to scuttle the ship.  Plus, we still came in late.   Theyre filing a lawsuit against Tenras group, Singer said, but those things take a long time to resolve.  I hope thats all there is, that they were just a rogue team.  Thats hard to guarantee, though.  Space is large.   Was Mr.  Greels under her influence the entire time? Sarah asked.   Seal glanced at Singer.  Shook his head.  In one way or the other.  Technically, her pheromones shouldnt have been able to escape the cryomatrix, but no one knows for sure yet.  Her body will be studied for some time.  Clearly, she was the First the vampires mentioned, but was she a more advanced version? A later stage? It is all uncertain.   She couldve been using the whole thingCongi, Greels, everything and everyoneas a diversion, Singer said.  A way of getting free of the matrix and getting out into the public.  Surviving.   So what will happen to Mr.  Greels? Jebediah asked.   Well, hes symbiote-free, so thats something.  As to the restthats all still under investigation.  For now, hell be confined here on the station.  He sniffed.  Greels has a lot of Guild friends, though.  I doubt hell suffer too long.   Singer frowned.  Looked at Sarah.  Even though he tried to leave you and Darly behind?  I doubt Tenra wanted me with them either, though, Sarah said.   Singer nodded.  And Im sure hell use that in his defense.   Sarah placed her free hand on her stomach.  Smiled.  So, Miss Darlyshe will still be available?  Seal chuckled.  Shes taking some time away from the Guild.  Working on a book, I believe.  But if I know her, shes just marking time until your delivery.  Wouldnt miss that for multiple worlds.   Everyone smiled.   Speaking of worlds Singer brought out a large com unit.  Held it up so they could see the screen.  I wanted to show you something I found on the scraddle.  Came in while we were en route.  Probably about the time you went off to save the others.  She pressed the bottom portion of the screen.  An image of a bright sun appeared.  As they watched, the sun grew, finally filling most of the screen.  That was Alabasters sun, Jebediah.  The planet was completely lost.  Only five days after we left.  You saved them all.  Your belief was proven right.  Your faith.  And your actions.   Working as one.  Jebediah nodded.  As they should.   Sarah looked at him and smiled.  Makes me wonder what the people of Alabaster will select for the name of their new world.  I hope it is appropriate.   Jeb sighed.  My wife is practicing guile.  I believe she has made some suggestions there, as well.   Seal and Singer exchanged looks.  Really? Seal said.  What?  I would rather not say.           NEW AMISHER PLANETTWO WEEKS LATER    Samuel had a secret.  A weight.  His own portion of misguided Gelassenheit.  A hereditary sacrifice.   He sat beneath a stand of trees, watching.  Waiting.  The sky above was blue, with only a few scattered clouds.  The sun was guaranteed to be stable and full of life for millennia to come.   Before him was their settlement on this new world.  A small collection of Guild-provided tents.  Blue, with a bright bird-like insignia on every one.   It was a fertile place, this world, but decidedly untamed.  Trees were everywhere, growing sporadically.  The ground was covered with long grass and patches of purple lichen.  There wasnt anywhere that could serve as a field yet.  Land would have to be cleared.  Houses and barns built.  Crops planted.  Good work, hard workcommunity-building work.   What he was most concerned about now, though, was what was occurring in the tents.  Hed chosen to abstain from the voting, but he was fairly certain how it would go.  The Lord loved reminders.  Even painful ones.   The flap on the nearest tent opened and Deacon Mark stepped out.  He looked Samuels direction and with a wave began to walk toward him.   Theyve decided then? Samuel said when Mark drew near.   Mark nodded.  Yes.  He pointed toward the tent.  I told Ezekiel that he could tell you.  He wanted to, regardless of the outcome.   Samuel nodded stiffly and then winced as he repositioned his legs in front of him.  Lichen already stained his shoes.  So what do you seek of me?  Mark took a seat next to him.  He removed his hat, smoothed his hair, and put the hat back into place.  I wanted to talk with you.   Samuel nodded again.  Youre welcome to do that, friend.  Always welcome.   Mark nodded.  Paused.  Looked out at the collection of tents.  I had a talk with the Ravens captain before we left.  He shared something.   Samuel felt a twinge of anxiety.  Prayed the Lord would take it.  Nodded as He did.  I would imagine he had many things to say.  It was quite the experience we shared.  Moments of change.  Decision points.  The consequences of past failures.  Of lack of faith.   Mark frowned.  You know Alabaster is gone, Samuel.   Samuel didnt look at him, staring instead at a place above the tents.  An odd sort of bird flitted into view, swooping and dancing.  I am aware of that, ya.  Im sorrowed by it, but I delight in the Lords will, regardless.   Jebediahs decision saved us.  His use of the machine.   The bird flew away.  I am aware.  But now weve all taken part in bloodshed.  Even me.   Mark looked toward the settlement.  My mind is at peace with that.  Im not certain that what we fought was human.   Nee, that is merely balm for your conscience, Mark.  They were our bruders, our schwestern.   Perhaps.  Yet we acted to save others.  Many in the Scriptures did the same.   But our forefathers  Mark held up a hand.  Acted differently.  So Ive heard.  But not always.   Samuel scowled at him.  What are you saying? They resisted violence to the death!  Mark nodded.  But they didnt always walk in pure faith, did they?  Samuel held up a finger.  You are talking about Jebediahs machine again.  It is his familys legacy.  Their shame.  It isnt one the community shares.   Mark looked him in the eyes.  So what was your family legacy, Samuel? Your ancestors contribution?  Samuel huffed.  Faced the settlement again.  I do not know what you mean.   Mark chuckled.  Nee, I think you do, Samuel.   There was silence for many moments.  Finally, Samuel pounded the ground with his hand.  No more secrets then.  It was my great-grandfathers doing, he said.  Isaiah.  He was an Englisher who became unsettled with their ways.  Became an Amisher.  Helped lead the settling of Alabaster.  Samuel shook his head.  He wasnt pure in his heart, though.  Not like I have tried to be.   Mark nodded.  He purchased the insurance, didnt he? Made the way for us to come here.   Samuel gave a slow nod.  He did.  It is a secret Ive lived with.  My familys shame.   Mark scowled.  Not a shame, Samuel: something God used for his purposes.  Something that saved us.   Samuel indicated the tents.  For this?  Mark held his hands out.  Looked into the sky.  Yes.  And for this.  For all of this.  A blessing.   Samuel harrumphed, but his heart was barely in it.   The tent flap opened again.  Out strode Ezekiel, head high, a lightness in his step.  The new deacon.  He nearly ran to them.  It is decided, he said.   Samuel nodded slowly.  Our worlds name?  I find it fitting, he said.  A proper remembering for Jebediah.   And so?  We shall call it Millers Resolve!  Samuel nodded again.  Looked at the sky.   Many things had changed.  Many more things would change.

2,0,"Flirtation lasts the brief flutter of a butterflys wing.  True love endures the weathering of a mountain to dust.  -- Hun Proverb     Nikitas heart soared as she strode up the rocky slope to the plateau overlooking the battlefield.  It had been four long days since the death-sworn raiders had thundered down the mountains in seemingly unstoppable numbers.  Four agonizing days of blood-soaked chaos; four obsidian nights punctuated by heart-rending screams and groans.  Many good warriors had been slain.  She had almost lost hope.  It had been Nathan who had turned the tide.  Nathan, his five lieutenants, and their soul-deep commitment to holding the line, no matter what it took.  They had paid dearly for their efforts; each man bore wounds which would leave lasting scars.  But they had done it.  Against all odds, against the most brutal of foes, they had held the field.  She looked to her right, to where Nathan walked steadily at her side.  Warmth soaked her to the bone.  God, he was everything she craved.  His leather armor was pocked with ragged holes and countless stains.  Blood soaked through the bandage on his thigh, and she marveled that he was able to walk.  The sword at his hip was well worn; it had saved her life more times than she could count.  She drew to a stop as they reached the crest, and behind her Nathans five loyal lieutenants spread out, always vigilant for danger.  For so long their lives had been about war  about holding off the endless waves of bandits and raiders who sought to destroy all they had so carefully built.  Now, at last, the final threat had been dealt with.  After years of bloody conflict, they might have achieved that peace so long dreamed of.  It took her breath away.  She turned to Nathan, and his gaze was on her, steady, sure.  The eldest son of the neighboring noble, he had been the first to come to her aid when her parents had been ambushed and killed.  He had loyally stood by her side throughout the raids and sieges which followed.  And now there was peace.  Her heart wound with coiled wire.  For so long she had not dared dream of this day.  It had seemed like the long, hellacious storm would never end.  And now that the clouds were finally passing  would he leave as well? The coils drew tighter.  She could not imagine her keep without him in it.  Without his warm smile as they practiced swordwork in the courtyard.  Without his insightful conversations as they walked the battlements.  Without the warmth of being - just being - on the couch by the fire at the end of a battle which would have broken the will of most others.  And he had laid his arm across her shoulder  She wrapped her arms around her chest.  If peace was finally a reality, would he leave her to return to his own lands? Would her home become safe, secure  and cavernously lonely? She looked out to the field, and then past it, to the city of Aquarius.  Those sturdy walls had never been breached.  The innocents huddled within could finally emerge to furrow their soil and seed the ground.  They could laugh, love, and rebuild.  And it was all due to the man who stood by her side.  If he were to go  She blinked her eyes against the emotion, then turned to him.  She looked up into those amber eyes  and her voice caught in her throat.  It took all her strength to put breath behind her thoughts.  Nathan, I wanted to say  The words dried up.  Thank you? There were no trite platitudes which could express her feelings for all he had done.  He had put his life on the line for her more times than she could count.  He had been there in the darkest hours, when all hope seemed lost.  He had held her close when despair threatened to suck away the last of her will.  She knew what she wanted to say from the very depths of her soul.  Please dont leave me.  The setting sun shimmered behind him, casting shadows across his face, and she could not read his expression.  His hand, as always, rested lightly on the hilt of his sword, ready to defend her.  She wished she knew what he was thinking.  Was he grateful that he was finally released from his obligation? Was he eager to return home to his parents? She swallowed hard, clinging to the tiniest fragment of hope.  Could it be that he, too, found that their friendship tracing back to childhood had grown, through the blaze and fury of battle, into a precious metal forged to last the ages? Nathans gaze swirled, caught up in emotions she could not name.  He, too, swept his focus to rest on Aquarius for a moment.  Then he turned to each of his lieutenants in turn, their eyes meeting in some sort of understanding.  Her heart thundered against her chest.  He was leaving.  He was saying goodbye.  At last he brought his gaze back to her.  He lowered himself onto one knee.  Nikita swayed, the world taking on a dream-like glow.  Not in a thousand years, not in her deepest unspoken dreams, could she have hoped  He reached up to take her hand in his.  She felt the sturdiness of his fingers, the rough-worn strength which had grappled against death and clawed its way back from the edge of despair.  Now they held her fingers with the delicacy of a newborn chick.  The world faded away, and it was just her and Nathan.  His voice was rich, warm, and it soothed into the depths of her soul, into the ragged places which thought never to find solace.  Nikita, my other half, the one who makes me complete.  When I first came to you, it was as a loyal friend who respected our family ties.  But over these past four years  He shook his head as if he could not believe she was before him.  It took him a moment to continue.  Nikki, it has been an honor.  An honor to share your table, an honor to fight by your side, an honor to witness the depths of your care for those you watch over.  I have witnessed your blossoming from a stripling girl into a woman who takes my breath away.  Nikita forced herself to breathe, so lost she was in his gaze.  Nathans eyes shone with emotion.  You deserve far better than me.  You deserve the richest king and a castle carved from gold.  You deserve the finest destriers and the softest silks.  But I swear to you, if you would do me the honor of being my wife, that our home will be rich with laughter, security, and love.  He reached into his pocket and brought out a small wooden box.  Lifting the lid, he revealed a simple but finely crafted ring.  Joy filled Nikita, radiating out, seeming to light the entire valley below with golden brilliance.  Her world was complete.  There was nothing that could mar her sense of wholeness.  Nothing could put even the slightest shadow over the love which blossomed out from the innermost reaches of her soul.  She looked down into the eyes of the man who had won her heart.  She held her hand out to him, fingers splayed.  Her voice rang with the certainty that echoed in every cell of her body.  I love you.  I love you with every beat of my heart; with every breath.  Yes, I will be yours, Nathan.  Forever.  Nathans eyes glowed with emotion.  He took up the ring, preparing to slide - The golden glow around them intensified, then shimmered.  A deep, resonant voice surrounded them, seeming to come from their very bones.  Wait.       999 years later  Commander Jon Paxton smiled as he watched the languidly spinning, crimsonclouded sphere on the large view-screen.  This treaty would undoubtedly be a milestone of the century.  A combination of diligent effort and a sprinkling of luck had melded to ensure that he, despite only having ten years of service under his belt, would be present for this historic ceremony.  The Collective intended to firmly demonstrate their approval of this pact.  The warship he served on, the Zeta Nine, was briefly out of the trenches and marching on parade.  A deep voice spoke from behind him.  Ready to head down? Jon turned as Captain Smythe slowly pushed up from his command chair.  The man was in his late fifties, but beneath that scattering of grey hair lay a mind as sharp as any of the instructors at the Academy.  Smythe nodded to his second-in-command, and the two headed off the main bridge toward the elevator.  Anticipation coursed through Jons veins.  The final round of talks was still two days off, but he had heard fantastic stories about the grand parties preceding all of Nicole Bessams signings.  Everything about the woman seemed larger than life.  The tangled conflicts she had managed to delicately unravel were legendary.  She was said to be responsible for stopping more wars than anyone else in Collective history.  Jon pondered Bessam as the elevator whooshed down.  The files on her seemed almost criminally empty for someone with such a stellar reputation.  Apparently Nicole put a high value on her privacy and let few details about her background enter the public record.  She spent most of her days commanding a scout ship on the fringes of Collective territory, gathering intelligence.  According to the records, Nicoles only regular contact with other fleet members came when she arrived for these negotiations.  The elevator gently grumbled to a stop.  The two men stepped out into the transporter room to find the rest of the landing party ready for teleportation; all four crew members seemed eager to get under way.  Undoubtedly, like most Collective officers, they had fervently hoped that one of their tours would occasion an appearance at a signing.  With this treaty, they had been lucky enough to score an extremely important one.  All were anxious to see how the reality of a Bessam event held up against the many tales and reports.  Jon glanced at the reflective surface of the wall as he stepped onto his pad.  He gave his thick, brown hair a quick run-through with his fingers as he turned in place to face forward.  The lanky transporter operator gave them a nod and moved his hand over his console.  Blink.  Jon and his companions shimmered into life in the midst of music, laughter, and exuberant voices echoing through a large, ornately decorated marble hall.  A golden sunset streamed in through the bank of large, beveled windows, throwing rainbow streaks onto a myriad of curling streamers, floating balloons, and delicate paper lanterns.  The room was almost deafeningly loud, and a cacophony of languages sounded from all sides.  Jon looked around him with interest at the plethora of races and uniforms represented.  The negotiating parties were not allowed in the main hall until the morning of the talks.  Apparently this rule cut down on the number of violent confrontations which might spring up.  For now, the room was packed with visitors and observers, students and recorders, dignitaries and locals, and undoubtedly a few spies.  Tables laden with fragrant, exotic foods lined the walls, and moss-green-suited waiters circulated unobtrusively with an assortment of liquid refreshments.  Jon turned to his captain, grinning.  Quite a turnout, he commented dryly, eyeing a round-eyed Jarusian who slunk by in a shimmering emerald dress.  He nodded to her, then turned in place to take in the full effect of the hall.  Many of those present wore respirators or cybernetic body suits to preserve the environment necessary for life.  The variety of cultures present was staggering.  Apparently the top representative from every edge of the galaxy had made an effort to attend this celebration.  Many havent even arrived yet, replied Captain Smythe, chuckling at the effect the room was having on his awestruck crew.  The majority of guests will be arriving tomorrow.  He waved a hand in greeting to an admiral lounging by a wall, and in a moment the two men were clasping arms and laughing in delight.  Jon stood with them, barely hearing their shared stories, snagging a sapphire drink from a passing waiter.  The sunset slowly faded from the room.  The glimmering paper lanterns and colored lights added a mystical effect to the figures moving through the shadows.  By the time darkness had descended in earnest, Jon had eased into the rhythm of the exuberant environment, in tune with the cacophony of voices and kaleidoscope of colors.  It was almost a shock when a hush permeated, wave-like, across the hall.  All eyes turned to a raised dais at the far end of the cavernous room.  A willowy, blond man in a forest-green formal uniform lowered his hand and tentatively tapped his microphone.  As I was saying, the resort planet of Glandy is immensely proud to be able to serve as host to the Cybian-Patar negotiations.  These talks will join two powerful planets into the family of the Collective.  And so, I present to you Captain Bessam and her crew! The speaker motioned grandly to the pad, where five forms were already taking shape.  Jon was caught up in the holding-of-breath that seemingly blanketed the hundreds of people in the hall.  He watched with steady focus as the group of negotiators shimmered into being.  Nicole stood in the middle of the group of four men, her dark, chestnut-brown hair curling just past shoulder length over her flowing turquoise and gold dress.  The dress followed her slim curves, then swirled into a shimmering pool at her feet.  Her companions had matching colored uniforms, in the more formal Collective style.  Jon and his crew were wearing black versions of that same outfit.  Each of the negotiating team wore a silver diamond-shaped pin over his or her left breast.  As Jons eyes swept over the team members, a sharp pain in his breast staggered him.  He drew in a deep breath, steadying himself.  His mind raced back to that day, over a decade ago, when he had seen the group during his orientation at the Academy.  He had experienced that same visceral shock.  It was a feeling of  what, jealousy? Envy? He shook his head, letting his gaze rest for a moment on each team member, before settling it on Nicole.  Loneliness.  The rightness of the word echoed in his soul.  He wanted, with every fiber of his being, to be a member of that team.  He craved it with a longing that he had never felt for anything else in the world.  And he had no idea why.  He let out a breath, taking a long drink of his sapphire concoction.  Back at the Academy, as a new arrival, he had assumed his desire was simply a natural part of starting on his path.  He figured that all new recruits felt that same passion when looking at established teams and that his feelings would settle down once he was assigned his first ship.  But looking at the group standing before him, he knew this was something different.  No matter what team he had been grouped with, no matter what challenges he had faced, he had never felt an all-encompassing desire like this one.  Ten long years had passed.  Ten years of achievements and promotions, of victories and celebrations.  And yet, looking at that small group of men and women before him, he would trade it all in an instant to be able to stand at their side.       Nicoles years of successful negotiations had trained her well.  She knew exactly how the first impressions of the evening should unfold, from the way she held her eyes to the subtle tilt of her smile.  As her team materialized, she and her compatriots stood still, with welcoming smiles on their faces, then slowly looked around the room.  Every person there should have the opportunity to warm with the thought that she had personally seen them and acknowledged their presence.  Shortly would come the exhausting part, where she would actually try to meet and talk with each person, if only for a few minutes.  One never knew which person was somehow related to the negotiating team members and which moment of kindness would bring about spectacular results.  It was all necessary for the success of the event.  As she stepped down from the podium she willed herself to move slowly, to focus on each encounter, to not let her thoughts wander.  People could often sense if she was paying attention or if her mind drifted to other, personal musings.  She included the wait-staff and the local guards in her gentle greetings.  Every person there deserved to be included.  For example, in that corner - Nicoles breath caught, and time stood still.  A tall, well-built man in his early thirties was standing across the room.  His hair was dark brown and neatly trimmed, and he wore the formal, black uniform of the Collective military.  He stood amongst a group of similarly attired crewmates, talking with an older gentleman.  In many ways, he was identical to the countless other Collective officers who filled the hall.  The black boots, the toned body, the alert stance, the carefully-pressed attire  but it was his eyes that transfixed her.  He was a good distance from her, a part of the crowd, and yet she was sure she recognized those tawny eyes.  Eyes that were the window to the soul  His head turned, and he was staring right at her.  Her breath caught at the impact of his attention.  Warmth flushed down her skin, tracing its way to her very toes.  A yearning poured through her - She forced her eyes to the floor, taking in a long, deep breath, castigating herself for her lack of composure.  She had known he would be here.  She had thought she was prepared for this first encounter.  Apparently not.  She allowed herself a wry smile.  It was time to get back to work.  Rule number one in the initial greeting process - never reveal any preferences.  No person she met should ever feel less important than any other.  The evening would be a long one.  Surely at some point during the long, interminable process she would find time to be alone with him.  Then she could gaze into those eyes again, seek to fall within them, and try to discern if at last, at long last, he could be the one.  She raised her gaze to the next dignitary before her, a violet-haired, six-limbed Luxoid, his full body suit compensating for his frail skeletal structure which had developed in a far weaker gravity.  She gave him her fullest smile.  These party days both excited and drained her.  They were part of why she and her crew remained out on the fringes of the galaxy for months on end.  The isolation helped her feel fresh and new for these meetings  and the quiet was a much needed solace once she had been wrung dry by the participants.  Without speaking, her four crew members spread out in a flanking position as she slowly worked her way through the crowd.  There were always minor incidents at these gatherings  sometimes an over-enthusiastic, inebriated admirer, or sometimes a passionate individual opposed to the purpose of the truce.  The team had done this for many years.  Usually her alert teammates were able to intercept those people before they got within five feet of her.  The men were a part of her, moving as she did, anticipating her intentions.  Time trickled by in a slow but steady progression of greetings, discussions, and gentle retractions as she extricated herself from one conversation so she could move along to the next.  Richard, her second-in-command, would step in occasionally, presenting a glass of water, offering a quiet apology to whoever had latched onto her.  His short, blond hair and lean build was always a welcome sight.  His sense of the rhythm of the flow was impeccable.  Delicately prying herself loose from a garrulous, winged, beetle-like diplomat with a passion for flirting, Nicole turned and gave a genuine smile.  Captain Smythe, she warmly greeted the weathered man with pleasure.  Marcus! Its been so long.  How are your truffle recipes progressing? Captain Smythe puffed up with the personal attention and gave Nicole a fatherly hug.  Nicole, it has been too long, he smiled in return.  I have numerous new items I am sure you will adore.  I have just perfected a variety that involves a chocolate orange liqueur filling.  It is both delicate and full of flavor.  I had wondered if you would remember them.  Nicoles smile widened.  As if I could forget, Marcus.  That week on the space station was transformed from a tedious paperwork hell into an Eden of delight solely because of your presence.  Her eyes twinkled.  When I find myself in similar circumstances, I often fantasize that you will appear.  Marcus blushed under the praise and quickly introduced his crew which stood in a group behind him.  Nicole smiled and politely greeted the doctor, the military advisor, the helmsman, the science officer, and then  Nicole turned her eyes and found them caught once again in that tawny stare.  Her heart thundered against her ribs; only years of negotiation experience helped her to mitigate her response.  She heard Marcus mention his name, Jon.  Jon.  That is what he is called.  She willed herself to take a deep breath.  Jon slowly reached out a hand to take hers and gently brought his lips down to it for a formal kiss.  Holding her hand in his, he murmured in the Hun language,  Many years I sought your gaze  Yet when I see you again, It is as if we had never parted.   The room dissolved around Nicole; only Jon and she remained.  She found fascination in the texture of his fingers where they tenderly wrapped around her own.  She inhaled the rich musk of his cologne.  After all these years  Jons mouth quirked in a wry smile.  I heard you were a woman of many words, he teased with a soft chuckle.  Nicole found her voice.  That verse  it is from an ancient collection of the Hun planet.  Why did you choose that one to greet me? Jons eyes sparkled.  I did some research on your group before we came, he admitted.  Your official bio said that you spoke Hun, as did your crew.  I had always been drawn to that cultures code of loyalty.  The poem was one of my favorites.  I hope I did not offend you.  Oh, no.  The poem was beautiful.  But  do you believe we have met? Jons face eased to soft crimson.  Not that you would remember, I am sure.  It was when I first arrived at the Academy with my parents.  We were walking across the main green and looking across the quadrangle, I happened to see you and your crew moving along with the Academy Chairman.  And  Nicoles breath caught.  And? Jon looked as if he would not continue, but under her gaze he spoke in a softer tone.  The world fell away, and it was as if he were revealing a close-kept secret, one held within for long years.  I stopped in my tracks.  There was something about you all, something ineffable.  I felt a poignant sense of  of loss, I suppose.  He looked down at her hands.  I took a step to go over and talk to you, but you were moving toward the main offices.  My parents tugged me in the opposite direction, urging me to hurry to the dorm area before I missed the presentation.  His eyes seemed distant.  There was a small man at the back of the group.  I remember distinctly his shock of unruly blond hair.  He turned at that moment and caught me staring after you.  He stopped, winked at me, then turned to rejoin you.  His voice went hoarse.  And then you were gone.  Nicole wanted to look away, but was transfixed by the focus in Jons look.  That man, that  that was Christopher, she murmured, her voice tight.  He  Her voice faded as the memories swept in on her.  Jon gave her hand a squeeze.  Yes, I know, he offered.  He died a number of years ago, on one of your missions.  I am so sorry for your loss.  A round, squat, scale-skinned man in a garish sapphire version of the Collective uniform eagerly muscled his way between the two, breaking apart their hands.  Nicole saw the sharp flash of anger in Jons eyes  a glint that she doubted any others in the room were aware of.  For immediately came the powerful clamping down of control as he imposed self-discipline on his feelings.  She remembered well his amazing mastery of his emotions, his ability to maintain calm in any situation.  Longing grew within her, and with it her fury with Zaggat at destroying her first meeting with Jon  a moment she had dreamed about for so many years.  Zaggat barely looked at Jon as he came to a stop before her.  He glared up at her with heated frustration.  Nicole.  There you are.  You must come with me immediately  I need you to talk with the Ambassador from Chillia.  They have an issue they need to address.  Zaggats sharp eyes skewered hers, and he held out a pudgy hand to motion her down into the center of the maelstrom.  The noise and the press of the crowd swelled in on Nicole.  She found it hard to draw in a breath.  Jons brow creased into a frown.  He took a step forward as if he would interfere on her behalf.  She gently put up her hand to indicate he should wait.  Out of the corner of her eye she saw Stephen had also taken a step forward, his dark curls framing a growling countenance.  By the fires in his gaze, Zaggat might be lucky to leave the hall with his thick limbs still attached to his torso.  Nicoles eyes twinkled at the thought  but she flashed Stephen a subtle signal.  She would handle this.  Turning to Jon, she drew a smile onto her lips and asked, Is it true that you play an instrument? Jons eyes widened in surprise at this change of topic.  Yes, certainly, I play the saxophone, he confirmed.  I have for many years.  Nicole nodded.  Make sure you tune it up before tomorrow night, she requested with a wink.  Then, acquiescing to Zaggats prodding arm, she moved with him into the crowd.       Jon stared after Nicole, lost in thought.  What was it about her that caught his attention so strongly? He had many girlfriends, many lovers, over the years.  Each one had been different and compelling.  And yet, there was something about Nicole  He made his way up to a balcony overlook, where he could watch the gathering from a distance.  Nicole was like a salmon in a sea of fluttering goldfish.  She moved with a purpose; even from here he could feel the draw to her.  Three short days.  He would have three short days to get to know her, to soak in her presence.  Three short days  and then she would be gone.  A deep voice spoke at his ear, startling him.  Strange, commented Jamus.  Its almost as if . . .  What? Jon turned to the military officer in confusion, wondering if hed missed a part of the conversation.  Jamus crossed his arms.  His thick biceps rippled, sending a wave along his textured skin.  His Hun heritage had served him well in the hand-to-hand fighting the ship occasionally dealt with in ground combat.  He was inches taller than most humans, and his eyes glowed bright emerald.  Jamus nodded his head toward Nicole.  See the way her men are arrayed around her? His gaze sharpened.  Richard, her second-in-command, stays behind her.  Stephen, the guy with the black curls, watches on the left, his hand ready at his hip.  Sean, with the copper, shoulder-length waves, saunters along on the right.  Up front is Ian, with the light-brown brush cut, and theres this sense that he knows exactly what is going on.  Jon watched for a while and found that Jamus was indeed correct.  Wherever Nicole moved, the diamond guard moved with her.  The pattern was maintained regardless of who they encountered or how the crowd flowed around them.  I agree you are right.  The crew is watching over Nicole.  But surely that is part of their responsibility.  Especially this weekend, with the stakes as high as they are.  Jamuss brow creased.  Its not just any formation, he replied with emphasis.  Thats the formation used by Nikita.  Jon shook his head.  He should have known that Nikitas name would come up.  He turned to Jamus with a gentle smile.  Look, Jamus, I know your interest in your planets heroine borders on an obsession.  She came into being a thousand years ago, and she renews herself with each generation to dedicate her life to preserving peace.  That last Nikita iteration was stunning.  Facing down thirteen Hun warships  and was it two hundred fighters? That would be quite an achievement in any era.  He glanced at the laughing group below him.  However, I highly doubt the woman who was slain decades ago had any contact with that diplomat we met today.  Nicole would have been an infant.  Jamus wasnt listening.  They say Nikita wasnt killed, he growled.  She went into hiding and has created a secret school for elite warriors.  She and her team only open their doors to the faithful.  Jon sighed.  This was one of Jamuss most fondly held dreams.  To find Nikita, to receive her knowledge, and to fulfill his noble familys heritage.  He would be the one, at last, to lead the Hun into their finest hour.  Jamus, Nikitas team was slain by assassins, he pointed out.  It was a final act of treachery near the end of the Hun civil war.  Jamus snorted.  Lies.  I know that she and her team are waiting in a secret location, prepared to train me.  His frown deepened as he peered into the crowd.  Somehow, against all odds, Nicole has found Nikita.  Nicole must have somehow coerced Nikita into sharing what she knew.  He harrumphed.  Even though clearly Nicole is entirely unworthy of that attention.  Jon ran a hand through his hair.  Jamus, you cant honestly believe  Jamus cut him off.  It all fits, he insisted, his emerald eyes glowing with heat.  Nicole and her team have taken on nicknames which neatly mirror those the Hun royal families have used down the ages.  They have training and skills that only Nikita could have shared with them.  A growl emerged from his throat.  You cant tell me they learned that level of combat down in the slums of Vercador Sept.  Theyve been scouting the universe for over ten years now, pointed out Jon.  Theyve had plenty of time to  Jamuss gaze lit.  They had plenty of time to track down exactly where Nikitas hidden base was located, he breathed.  All I need to do is prove they have the training.  Then they would be forced to share the schools location with me! He pushed past Jon and strode down the small flight of stairs.  Jon found himself running to catch up with his friend.  Jamus was a fascinating person to work with and brilliant at military tactics.  However, his obsession with the history of his Hun culture was only matched by his fiery insistence on always being proven right.  Jon had no interest in dragging his friend out of a confrontation tonight  not when his time to spend with Nicole was already so cruelly short.  Ahead, Jamus shouldered his way through the crowd.  The tall man was soon staring down at Stephen.  Jon could see Jamus introducing himself as he came within earshot.  Stephen was talking in a congenial tone.  How can I help you, Jamus? He nodded to Jon as Jon came up behind his friend.  Is there something I can assist you two with? Jon found he could read Stephens stance as if the two had trained together for years.  The relaxation along his shoulder blades told that he saw no threat in the taller Hun.  The hand floating near his hip showed that he would be ready, just in case.  Jamus held Stephens gaze with fixed attention.  I was admiring your defensive formation, he stated with a snap.  A liquid diamond.  Im sure we know who you learned that from.  Id just like to know where.  Stephens eyes narrowed; the line of his muscles along his shoulders rose.  Jon could feel, viscerally, the reaction of the other three men in his team.  The slight turn of Richards head, the stilling in Ians stride, the tension rippling down Seans arm.  Stephens voice was cool.  Im sure if you sent your request to Nicole along proper channels, that she would  Jamus interrupted as if he had not heard.  Your teams fighting its way out of Raisa Dwa is well documented.  Ive seen some of the video.  That style of movement is only taught to Huns in the noble families.  His voice dropped to a growl.  I know.  My family is part of the high royal network.  He took a step forward.  Where did Nicole  an outsider - learn it? Who taught her? She has no right! Stephens jaw ripped with tension, and Jon saw that Richards attention was fully on them now.  Stephen laid a hand on Jamuss arm.  Jamus, it might be better if we  Before Jon realized what was happening, Jamus had ripped his arm free of Jon and launched a punch into Stephens ribs, putting the full weight of his body behind it.  Jon had seen Jamus in action before; this kind of blow typically laid his opponent out, unconscious and broken.  Stephen swept aside the blow as if it were a waving banner of silk.  At the same instant, a glasblade appeared in his other hand, the transparent edge pressed with sharp precision into the cleft of Jamuss neck.  Jamus froze, his eyes wide with shock.  The thinnest trickle of emerald-green blood trailed down his throat.  Stephen held the blade there for a heartbeat, then stepped back, slipping the weapon into its sheath at his hip.  Jamus drew in a staggering breath.  He did not make any move as the other three members of Stephens team closed in to surround him.  A few moments later Nicole herself came over, bringing with her Captain Smythe.  She pressed her badge.  Beam eight to the Zeta Nine.  In a few moments Jon was standing on the familiar platform, wondering just what had happened.  Captain Smythe took control of the situation with brisk efficiency.  Jamus, explain yourself immediately.  Jamus crossed his thick arms in front of his chest.  Nicole has been personally trained by Nikita, he stated with his habitual bluntness.  The combat style is the final, conclusive proof.  I know that move; I have seen it performed by the Grand Master himself.  No outsider should have that level of skill.  Jon shook his head.  Apparently Jamus saw no need to apologize for his actions.  The man had developed a theory, and it was logical for him to test it out.  Captain Smythes face darkened with anger.  Jamus, I want you to  Nicole put a hand on his arm, forestalling him.  It is all right, Captain, she assured him.  I know of Jamus and his family.  They take these matters of honor seriously.  She turned to gaze at him for a moment.  Your research is correct, Jamus.  While many cultures have similar systems, I have indeed modeled my teams style after that used by Nikita.  A small smile traced her lips.  I have studied Nikita for many years.  I do not hide my admiration of her.  Her gaze cooled.  I have not, however, ever met her, nor do I claim any other special training.  Just as you knew enough of her systems to recognize what I have done, I had learned enough to put together the security I have.  Jamus scowled.  For me to recognize it, given my family connections, and for you to actually have implemented these systems are far different matters, he countered with more than a hint of disbelief in his voice.  On your own? Without proper training? Nicole nodded at the implied compliment.  You see the end result of many years of trial and error, Jamus, she explained.  This is hardly how we started.  And it probably will not be how we end up.  And yet, she was my inspiration.  I am glad that you saw her touch in my work, but rest assured, it is all my own.  She glanced at the clock hanging on the opposite wall.  Are you done attacking my crew now? Captain Smythe spoke up again.  There was no excuse for Jamuss behavior.  He will be confined to the ship for the remainder of the event, pending a formal hearing.  I will handle his discipline personally, and I promise you that there will be no more trouble for your crew.  Nicole nodded her appreciation.  We do need to return promptly; we have a great deal left to do.  At a motion from Captain Smythe, Nicole and her crewmen were transported back down to the surface.  Jon stared into the space left by her shimmering departure as if through willpower alone he could bring her back.         2  Jon paced across the space of his room for the hundredth time.  He knew the steps exactly  ten solid footsteps and then a turn.  It was his duty to wait for the captain to call for him and to return to the event at his side.  Protocol dictated it.  And yet a complete hour had passed.  The party was in full swing, and Nicole was down there.  He could feel the draw to her as a palpable force, tugging at his soul.  His communicator pin chirped into life as it synced with the ships computer, and almost immediately he heard Captain Smythes voice.  Jon, are you free? Come by my room as soon as you can.  Jon held in his sigh of relief.  Right away, sir, he responded in a steady tone.  It was only moments before he was making his way down the hall toward the captains suite.  Marcus ushered Jon into the living area and offered him a seat at the small, ripple-textured ebony couch.  A bank of windows looked out over the swirling crimson planet below.  Marcuss eyes gleamed with intrigue.  You will find it was worth the wait, he stated without preamble.  He reached forward and picked up a black, shiny plastic card about three inches by four inches from the glass coffee table.  Do you know what this is? Jons eyes widened as he turned the rectangle over in his hands.  Is this really a Spider Invite? The captain took the card back without a word and pressed his thumb into its center.  Immediately, red words appeared on the card.  They gave a set of coordinates and a counting-down clock.  The countdown had just under an hour remaining.  I can only take one guest.  I know you love poker, but if you would rather not go, I am sure I can find someone else to accompany me.  It is after all one of the greatest floating gambling games in modern times.  Youre not kidding, responded Jon eagerly.  He had no doubt that Nicole would be there, and to attend would be the highlight of the decade.  Spiders game is the stuff of legends.  Maybe Spider himself will be there to play.  Is there a dress code? Keeping his thumb on the card, Marcus turned it over to reveal the other side.  In red, block letters, the card stated,  One guest only.  Discussing this event with anyone forfeits attendance rights.  Attire  formal red and black.   Best get ready, indicated Marcus with a smile.  Were running out of time.  Meet me in the transporter room in forty-five minutes, and well see what this is all about.  His brow creased.  Remember  not a word to anybody.  Ive heard that even a casual mention has caused people to get banned at the door.  Its better not to tempt fate.  Jon headed back to his room at a jog.  He showered quickly, acquired an elegant, formal black tuxedo from the replicator, and was back in the transporter room at the appointed time.  The captain arrived only moments after he did.  Marcus had memorized the coordinates and recited them out to the transporter chief.  The crewman programmed the coordinates into the computer, then looked up in surprise at the pair.  Thats in the middle of the desert, he said in confusion.  Theres nothing for hundreds of miles in any direction.  Are you sure those coordinates are correct? They are quite fine, replied the captain.  Beam us down.  The crewman shook his head and engaged the transporter system.  The dark desert shimmered into existence around them  and suddenly the black card in the captains hand gave a bright red flash.  Their surroundings slid out of focus, and then they appeared in a quite different environment.  They were now in a small ten-foot by ten-foot room.  The wall paneling was elegant black maple, and light came from a single overhead frosted-crystal ivory globe.  The carpet beneath them was finest cashmere.  A single carved-maple door on one wall, in a lighter shade of black, had a rectangular indention in it about chest-high.  Raising an eyebrow to Jon, Marcus walked forward to the door and pressed his card into the spot.  The card flashed red and then vanished.  The door silently slid open, and the two stood facing a large lounge.  A polished ebony-wood bar ran along the right side and a row of black velvet hangings covered the back wall.  Red couches and plush chairs were scattered in groupings around black marble oblong tables.  Admirals and Ambassadors in outfits of red and black mingled, chatting and drinking.  A deep voice hailed Jon from the right.  Hey there, we could use a hand! shouted Stephen from behind the bar.  Indeed, a group three-deep were pressed up against the wood, calling out drink orders.  Jon nodded to Marcus and headed over, easily vaulting the bar and joining the other men behind it.  Almost immediately the orders rained to him, and he fell into the rhythm of serving out drinks and chatting with the patrons as he poured.  How did you guys get pressed into bar duty? he called to Stephen as he placed a lavender concoction into a thin, robotic arm.  The arm was attached to a four-foot-tall transparent cylinder holding an iridescent liquid and, floating within it, an amoeba-like shape.  The arm retracted and carefully poured the drink into an opening at the top of the tube.  The diplomat within shimmered in ecstasy as the contents merged with his environment.  Stephens eyes brightened as he watched the drinker.  Sometimes I think we humans have it all wrong, he commented to Jon.  Many other races go for a far more direct route in their enjoyment of substances.  He gave himself a shake as he reached for another bottle.  In any case, as for why were pouring drinks, we volunteer, he explained.  It helps us get a lay of the land in one enthusiastic dose.  And in addition  A sultry Jarusian leant over the bar at Stephen, her outfit leaving very little to the imagination.  Im here with the Admiral, she cooed while she watched him mix up a triple martini, but I can always find a way to slide out early.  Her dark eyes glowed.  I hear you have wild times up on that ship of yours.  Stephen put down the glass and drew close to her as if she held the secrets of the universe.  Wild parties, every night, he hoarsely confirmed, his gaze seemingly lost in her eyes.  A long minute passed, and his hand half-reached for hers.  At last he dropped his eyes.  Without looking up he resolutely shook his head, his black curls framing his face.  I cant.  Not during negotiations.  Strict orders, for security reasons.  He looked up again, his dark eyes swirling with emotion.  Im sure you understand.  If it were any other weekend  The Jarusian hesitated, as if calculating her chances of pushing Stephen over the edge.  She gazed into his eyes  then sighed.  She lifted her drink with an elegant motion and sauntered off in the direction of her date.  Jon looked over at Stephen, eyebrows raised.  Stephens emotional angst shimmered away as if it had never been, and he grinned.  Gambling houses are betting millions on the outcome of the treaty, he explained.  It brings out some of the best grifters in the universe.  If they were an annoying cloud of mosquitoes earlier, tonight theyll be like leeches in a murky pond  doggedly determined.  Theyll be at us all night, trying to draw even a tiny detail.  He shrugged.  We try to head them off early, but they are paid to be tenacious.  So it becomes something of a game.  He glanced at the other men behind the bar.  I think I enjoy it a bit more than my fellow victims do.  There was a motion in the crowd, and he looked over.  His eyes danced.  Ah, I bet this one is for Ian.  Im afraid Ian isnt quite as fond of this part of our jobs as I am.  Jon turned.  A slim blonde with her hair delicately braided down her face, in an elegant dress of crimson tapestry, moved up to the bar.  She shyly brushed a stray curl of hair from her cheek before fluttering her lashes up to Ian.  All this noise is getting to me, she murmured.  Do you know of anywhere secluded I might go to rest for a few moments? Ian glanced over to Stephen, his expression one of quiet exasperation.  Then turned back to the young woman.  Im so sorry to hear that, miss.  I believe the womens restroom has a noise-dampened lounge with a sofa.  A waitress walked by, and he flagged her down.  This waitress will escort you there.  The blondes face fell in disappointment, but she nodded, allowing herself to be led away.  Another flurry of drinks, and then a pink-eyed Qatarian, her spiky hair dyed to match, was fluttering extravagantly long eyelashes at Jon.  Her tight black dress compressed her body into an unnatural, lumpy shape.  Maybe you could fulfill a life-long dream of mine, she murmured in a husky voice.  I have always wanted to see the scout ship for myself.  Will you be returning there tonight with your new friends? Jons eyes flickered over to Stephens; he was unsuccessfully holding back a wide smile.  John returned his gaze to the woman leaning over the bar toward him.  He pitched his voice low.  You are the most beautiful woman here, he confided to her.  How did you know that pink hair drives me wild? Her eyes lit up an eager anticipation, and the seams on her dress strained.  He let his mouth fall.  But I am afraid that I have sworn a vow of chastity for the year, he sighed.  There are two months left on that promise.  I shall be returning to my room on the Zeta Nine, alone, immediately after this event.  Her eyes lost some of their glow, but she rallied, pressing forward, laying her hand on his.  Are you sure I could not convince you to end that early? For me? He shook his head regretfully.  If I spent too much time even talking with you, I would be morally bound to kill myself.  Her mouth went wide in an O of shock, and she took the glass from him, backing away into the crowd.  Stephen shook his head with a smile.  Thats a new one, he teased.  Well see how long it works.  Jon grinned.  At least, if it doesnt, theyll start sending a flood of pink-haired girls at me.  Should be easy enough to pick them out of the crowd.  Stephen raised a glass in toast to him.  That it shall! Soon the first wave of drinks was complete.  Jon rolled his shoulders, breathing in the perfumes, colognes, and citrus aroma of fresh polish which wafted from the bar.  The room was full now, and a merry buzz of conversation swirled around him.  Stephen stepped over to Jon with a blood-red drink in a tall glass etched with lilies.  I believe theres a lady in red over by the far wall who would appreciate having this brought to her, he suggested with a knowing smile.  Jon glanced over.  Nicole was standing by the bank of curtained windows.  She was wearing a long, richly embroidered crimson dress with a plunging back.  She was deep in conversation with an older man who looked familiar.  Jon took the drink, his eyes never leaving her, and eased his way through the dense crowd.  Nicole looked up at his approach and smiled.  Jon, Im pleased to see you, she greeted.  This is commander-in-chief Xerxes.  You might remember him from the Academy days, when he headed up the training there.  Xerxes, this is Jon Paxton, second-in-command of the Zeta Nine.  Xerxes put out his hand, and the two men shook.  Xerxess grip was still strong, belying his wrinkled face.  Xerxes looked over Jon for a long moment, then gave a slight bow.  Ill leave you two alone then.  He turned and headed back into the room.  Jon offered Nicole the drink, which she gratefully took.  She sipped the concoction and closed her eyes, letting out a contented sigh.  Ah, perfect.  Let me guess.  Stephen? Jon nodded.  You know your men well.  I should, by now, she agreed in a low murmur.  She looked up, giving a soft smile.  Jon followed her gaze.  Her team had left the bar and was coming toward them.  He felt that same darting heat through his soul, a branding, but this time it came with a twining warmth.  He was the one here with Nicole.  The team was coming to join him.  They all wore outfits nearly identical to his  formal black tuxedoes, crisp white shirts.  When they came to a stop in a semi-circle before Jon and Nicole, a sense of completeness settled into his core.  It was right.  Stephen carried a pair of drinks in his hands, amber liquid in low, rounded glasses.  He handed one over to Jon.  Aged Hun brandy, he explained.  I thought you might enjoy it.  Jon took a sip and held in a groan of pleasure.  Stephen wasnt kidding.  Jon had tried a number of liquors during his years of service, but nothing had ever approached the smooth, rich flavor in the glass in his hand.  Stephens eyes gleamed in delight.  So it meets with your approval? Jon chuckled.  I would guess this isnt being stocked at the bar.  Richards mouth quirked.  Our private stash.  Probably not too many bottles of this left around.  He raised his glass to Jon.  Glad to see you appreciate it.  Jon smiled.  I do indeed.  There was a bright bubble of laughter from the far side of the room.  Richard glanced toward it before bringing his gaze back to Nicole.  His voice became serious.  Has she arrived yet? Nicoles smile faltered at the edges, and she shook her head no.  Not yet.  I imagine she will grace us with her presence at any moment now.  She took a long swallow of her cocktail.  Undoubtedly shell wait until the last possible moment to get through the teleporter redirect.  Then shell stall in the entry area to make sure shes the last person in.  Her eyes flicked toward the main door.  She wants to make her grand entrance.  Jon raised an eyebrow at Nicole, curious.  Nicoles voice was terse.  Captain Theresa Molloy.  A ripple of tension ran down Jons spine at the name.  He should have guessed that.  Captain Molloy was infamously involved in the events surrounding Christophers death.  According to official reports, her ship was simply in the area, and she was not directly entwined in the actual incident.  Xerxes had refused to release the full details of the situation, and many in the Collective felt he was covering up for improper actions on Molloys part.  Nicole and her men had never, to Jons knowledge, spoken publicly about the incident.  Jon wondered for the hundredth time just what had happened in that remote corner of the galaxy.  A hush fell across the room, and Jon instinctively turned to look toward the main entrance.  Beside him, he heard Nicole gasp in outrage, and Richard growled under his breath.  Jon had no doubt who the woman was who had just entered the room.  Captain Molloy was a beautiful woman  there was no denying that.  Her blonde hair fell straight to her waist, and her full breasts and wide hips were complemented by a narrow waist and well-defined legs.  Her choice for tonights outfit was to paint a delicately thin line of cherry-red latex paint in spirals around her body, barely covering the tips of her breasts and swooping downwards to touch the near-transparent red G-string she wore.  Her only real clothing was a pair of stiletto-heeled red shoes.  Equally shocking was the man at her side.  He was a swarthy man with ebony skin, wearing only a black loincloth.  A thick iron chain was attached to a collar at his neck Molloy tugged him along with her as if he were her pet Rottweiler.  Molloys gaze swept around the room and landed with laser focus on Nicole.  The blonde yanked at the chain.  The crowd parted in muttering waves in front of her as she made her way across the room toward them.  Nicoles voice was low and firm.  Easy, she warned her crewmates.  Hold to your roles.  Dont let her draw you in.  Jon didnt have time to ask what that might mean, for Molloy had reached them, and was preening for the group with sharp pleasure.  Up close, it was even more obvious how transparent her outfit  if one could call it that  was against her pale skin.  The woman offered a hand traced in spirals of red.  Neeecohhlll, she drawled.  It is so good to see you and your harem of beautiful boys tonight.  And what a charming little outfit you have on.  So vintage.  Did you pick that up on your last trip to Vercador Sept, that stunningly aromatic mud-pit you call home? Hows the family? Nicole took the proffered hand and shook it with a friendliness which surprised Jon.  His confusion grew when Nicole spoke.  Her normally rich, alto voice was suddenly light and playful Oh, Molly, what an absolute delight, smiled Nicole.  And just look at that jumpsuit you have on! Your fashion sense is amazing.  Stellar.  Look at how the red spirals interweave with the pale pink background.  Isnt that just right, Steve? Stephen responded in a voice reeking of effeminate languor.  Oh, Nikki, darling, it is the cats eye.  It is simply most luscious.  I shall have to find one for myself.  He turned his gaze on the blonde.  Do tell, Molly-o, where did you acquire such a spectacular piece of fabric? Captain Molloys face sagged at this interaction, but she regrouped, drawing a smile onto her face.  It is red latex paint, decorated on my skin, she insisted, turning to model the effect.  Sean stepped forward to peer closely at Molloys stomach.  Mmmmmmm, oh my, yes, he intoned with a droll, scholarly tone.  I do see the stretch marks here.  And this constellation of liver spots almost creates a parallelogram.  It does in fact seem to be your own skin, cherry angiomas and all.  Utterly fascinating.  Molloy flushed crimson, creating an incongruous match with the delicate red etchings on her face.  She turned roundly on Jon, her eyes sharpening.  Heres a new face in your menagerie, she hissed in a sharper tone of voice.  Let me guess - the newest boy toy for Nicole? Her gaze fixed on his, and her voice became snide.  Let me guess.  One look at her, and you could want no other.  You craved being by her side.  She snorted.  Let me warn you, boy, that in three days shell be gone.  Shell discard you like shes abandoned all the others in the past.  Youll be the trash left behind - worn out, used, and forgotten.  The dart carved into his heart, and he held his face neutral, understanding now why the others deflected her.  She could be insidiously keen with her attacks.  He eyes brightened.  Two could play that game.  His years of poker playing had taught him to size up an opponent, to sense where they were weak.  He put an arm out to Nicole, and she slid up against him as if she had been made to fit at his side.  He smiled fondly down at her before looking up at Molloy with contented relaxation.  Havent you heard? Nicole has been heralded as the greatest asset the Collective possesses.  I heard Xerxes himself say so.  He ran his eyes dismissively over Molloys curves.  I am finding that even a day with Nicole is worth years in the presence of a lesser woman.  He glanced down at the collared man at Molloys side.  I see you have a different technique for holding men to remain loyal.  Fascinating.  Molloys gaze narrowed, and she growled.  She turned on her heel and strode toward the bar, her man-servant in tow.  Jon found himself exhaling deeply as she left the area, and saw that the others had much of the same reaction.  So thats her, in the flesh, he said wryly to Nicole, taking a sip of his drink.  In the flesh is right, agreed Nicole under her breath, a twinkle returning to her eyes.  She looked up at Jon.  Thank you for playing along.  Im sure I dont need to explain to you the value of perceptions on ones opponents.  Jon toasted his drink to hers and smiled.  I understand completely.  A loud chiming sounded from further down the hall, and they turned to see what was going on.  The blond delegate who had introduced Nicole earlier was now standing by the bank of velvet curtains, delicately striking a small metal rod against a square chime.  When he saw he had the attention of the room, he put the instrument on a nearby table and expansively spread his arms.  Welcome to the first ever event held in Glandys core station! he proclaimed with enthusiasm.  This state-of-the-art research station will allow scientists from all over the galaxy to examine the actual workings of a planets core, safely within a shielded system.  They say a picture is worth a thousand words.  Then, take a look! All of the curtains on the outer wall pulled aside simultaneously, and the crowd gasped in collective amazement.  The room was suspended over an enormous, roiling cavern of lava, with spouts of hot liquid shooting up from the magma base.  Some of the squeamish in the group moved back toward the relative safety of the rear walls, but Nicole, Jon and their friends immediately moved forward to the glass to get a better look.  Sean practically had his nose against the glass.  The magma is fascinating! he gasped, looking over every new movement with a sparkling eye.  Jon felt Nicole press up alongside him and he automatically wrapped his hand closer along her slender waist, soaking in her heat as they both stared out at the landscape.  It was an awe-inspiring combination of liquid rolling, gaseous bubbling, and outcroppings of black rock.  The delegate broke into their musings with an announcement.  The main poker tournament is about to begin, he called to the room.  The players have been chosen based on the known standings of those present, with one sponsored seat.  You will find the selected names at each seat.  Will the players please take their places at the central table.  The crowd swirled and eddied as hopefuls scanned the place-cards and spectators found locations to observe the play.  Jon turned to talk with Nicole, but to her surprise she was gone  heading off into a corner with Xerxes.  He felt the loss as a tangible sensation.  A friendly hand jostled him on the shoulder.  Do not get too distracted now, teased Stephen in a low voice.  I see you have earned yourself a spot.  If your mind wanders, Richard and I will have to clean you out early.  Just try, returned Jon, drawing a smile back on his face.  Nicole had important business to attend to, no doubt.  And for him, the game was on.         3  Ebony place-cards, elegantly lined with crimson, lay before each of the seven chairs on an oval black marble table.  Jon found his name and settled into his velvet-lined seat.  A waiter appeared at his side, placing a glass of Champagne at Jons elbow.  There was movement at his right, and Richard slid into the seat, nodding to him.  May the best man win.  Stephen was two seats right of Richard, and he took a long sip of Champagne before raising his glass to the other two.  Do not get too used to those seats, he called across the table.  Molloy strolled past them with a scornful gaze before settling herself in at the far end of the table.  I hope at least Spider will be joining us, she huffed.  I would wish for some real competition tonight - not you chipmunks.  She plunked herself heavily into her chair, snapping her fingers for her glass.  A gruff voice sounded at Jons left.  You might just have it, he calmly returned.  Jons eyes twinkled as Xerxes settled into the seat at his left.  Jon knew the mans reputation, and competition might have been an understatement.  The willowy blond delegate took the seat at Stephens right, nodding to the group.  I am Martin, he introduced himself, elegantly reaching for his wine.  I represent the local interest in our little game.  Molloys eyes went to the remaining seat between Richard and Stephen with hawk-sharp interest.  So where is our final competitor? There was a movement by a side door, and a slim figure in a swirling crimson caftan emerged.  A turban encased his head and a full ebony face mask concealed his features.  A crimson spider was emblazoned across the center of the face.  Excited murmurs followed him as he moved across the room and took the remaining seat.  A glass of wine was presented, but he shook his head, waving it off.  Captain Smythe came up behind Jon, laying a hand on his shoulder.  It appears you are getting your wish and taking on the Spider himself, he chuckled with warmth.  Keep your wits sharp, my friend.  Remember, you are defending the honor of our entire ship.  I will not let you down, vowed Jon, looking over Spider with interest.  Ever since the first Spiders event, held several years ago on the infamous plains of Sidor X, the masked player had made his presence felt at almost every game.  His cool gameplay was legendary, with only the emotionless orbs shining from behind that flat mask.  A procession of seven servants flowed into the room, coming to stand behind each player.  With a flourish they placed down four stacks of chips  two crimson, two ebony.  A deck of cards was placed before Martin, and then the servants faded back into the eager throngs.  Molloy drained her wine and sharply set her empty glass down, drawing all eyes to her.  The movement of lava in the bank of windows sent a dappling of red and gold against her pale skin.  She gave a toothy smile to the collected players.  Well then, lets get this adventure started, gentlemen, she called out.  I say we start the kitty at 5,000 credits.  Martin paled at the figure, but one by one the men nodded their agreement.  In a moment Martin had passed around the cards, and the play began.  Jon found it took every ounce of his concentration to stay even with the players.  Each person there was at the highest level of gameplay, and it showed in every call, in every motion of the hand.  The crowd murmured in excitement with each turn of the card and slide of a chip.  The minutes drew out like taffy slowly easing from a warm pot.  A pale woman in a sleek, black dress, her hair the color of faded bubble gum, came up to his shoulder holding a flute of Champagne.  Her teeth sparkled as she placed it at his side.  Her voice was a low purr.  I thought I might bring you something for luck, she murmured.  I just know you will be the one on top tonight.  Stephens eyes glinted with amusement, and he riffed the top of his cards.  Jon nodded his head to the woman.  He was sure that she had been blonde when she arrived.  She must have done some quick work with the replicator to change her look just for him.  I appreciate it, but  She shook her head, laying an elegant finger on her lips.  Save your talking for later, she soothed him.  Well make every word count.  She slipped back into the crowd.  Richard raised an eyebrow.  Distractions come in all forms, he teased with a grin.  Dont say we didnt warn you.  Molloys sharp voice echoed across the table.  What are you playboys whispering about? Get on with the game.  Save your sweet nothings for each other for that bordello you call a ship.  Im sure by now youve turned Christophers empty room into a love nest.  He hardly needs it any more, does he? A frisson of anger skittered through Richards gaze, then his brow smoothed again.  Shall we? The minutes ticked by, the cards went around, and soon the marker was sitting before the blond diplomat.  Martins finger had a slight tremble to it as he pushed in a chip, one of only a few left in his pile.  Jon wondered for the sixth time if the delegate truly was in over his head or if this was an elaborate act.  Molloys eyes sharpened.  Buck up, Martini, she snapped.  Either you play with the big boys or you drop out.  Which will it be? Martin gulped, then with resolution he added his remaining chips to the pile.  All in, he announced, his voice cracking.  Molloy grinned widely.  About time, she triumphed.  She laid down her cards.  Full flush, she announced with pleasure to the group.  Martin groaned, dropping his head in his hands.  There were good-natured pats on his back from the crowd.  Then he stood, heading over to the bar with slumped shoulders.  Stephens eyes sparkled, and he glanced over to Richard and Jon.  The attrition has begun.  Molloy rubbed her hands together, looking out over the table.  All right, which of you mewling calves is next for the butchers block? The cards were dealt out, the bids went around, and Jon ran his eyes over each player in turn.  Xerxes could have been carved from granite, for all the emotion the man showed.  Stephen seemed amused with each hand.  Richard was steady, focused, his full attention on the table before him.  Jon drew his eyes, again, to the swirled woman at the end of the table.  Her acerbic comments had visibly unsettled Martin, but were having less of an effect on the remaining men.  He could see the frustration growing in her tight gaze as the table refused to rise to her escalating barbs.  And was that a slight tenseness in Molloys shoulders, where the red paint rippled into a wrinkling crevasse? Time for a test.  The marker came to him, and he held her gaze.  I raise a hundred credits.  Yes, there it was.  The creases deepened into small chasms.  Her hand was clearly not what she had hoped for.  Richard glanced at him for a moment, and Jon could see the glint of amusement there, one which flashed and then was hidden again in the steady focus.  Richards voice was cool.  A hundred credits, he agreed.  He smoothly slid the chips into the center.  Molloys caustic tone could cut glass.  Is that all? she snarled.  And to think I once thought you a real man.  Your time on that floating whorehouse has gelded you.  Richards face did not alter its steady focus.  To you, Spider.  The masked figure nodded, sliding a small stack of chips into the pile to match.  Molloys snort of annoyance could be heard across the room.  Stephen gave Richard a wink before reaching down to his own chips.  A hundred it is, my brother in arms, he agreed.  We will see if you can hold your own against these delightful cards.  Molloys voice carved its way down the table.  Do you two have one ounce of manhood left in you? She tossed her drink down her throat.  How could you, with that painted whore ordering you around all the time.  She should have been forced to spend that night with Caymus the Carver.  Her eyes glinted.  That would have put her in her place.  Stephens playful smile stilled, and Richards focus gained an edge which Stephen recognized instantly.  He wondered that Molloy did not ease back from the table at the palpable danger.  Instead, the woman seemed delighted with the reactions.  The swirls of paint on her cheek compressed as her grin grew.  She leant forward, her gaze sharpening.  I hear from a reliable source that you wouldnt have lifted a finger to protect her, she needled.  You would have just let him have her.  Both men were fully engaged now, their every ounce of attention on the woman.  Jon could see the tension rippling down their arms with the effort it took them to remain in place.  Molloy was nearly glowing with satisfaction at the effect she had caused.  She looked down at her cards again, and then placed them face-down on the table.  You know what? I am going to call your bluff.  Because I know your whole group is comprised of cowards.  You had to allow another man to step in and protect your Lady Fair on Vercador Sept.  When there was nobody to save you on Raisa Dwa, look what happened.  She spread her arms wide.  That weakling, Christopher, goes and gets himself killed by falling into a mud pit.  She gave a snorting laugh.  Talk about the stupidest, most idiotic  It was as if Stephen and Richard crystallized into honed steel.  Controlled fury etched their features; both men eased up out of their seats.  A bright flash of panic flared in Molloys eyes.  The pale blue veins in her neck pulsed in fast-paced staccato.  Spiders ebony-gloved hands came up to rest on the arm of each man at his side, gently holding them in place.  The crowd had hushed to a deathly silence.  For a long, harrowing moment, the room remained in a tableau.  Not a breath shook the stillness.  Then Molloy laughed, a brittle sound, and she flashed her teeth in triumph.  You see, boys, even Spider knows I am right.  Christopher was a cowardly, sniveling ant.  I hear he sobbed like a baby as he was sucked down into -  With a deliberate move, Spider released his hand from Richards arm.  Molloy gave a squeak of surprise; her voice gurgled to a whisper in her throat.  Richard remained still for a moment, as if to confirm that Spider had really set him free.  Then he slowly drew himself to his full height, staring down the table at Molloy.  Spider moved his hand to his mask and with careful precision undid the ties at the corners.  He brought the unit down to rest on the table, then stared evenly across at Molloy.  It was Nicole.  A soft murmur ran around the crowd, quickly hushed as Nicole turned to look at Xavier.  Her voice was low and even.  Do I have your permission to release our announcement early? His face was still recovering from the surprise of learning Spiders identity, but he nodded to her in acceptance.  I trust in your judgment.  She brought her gaze back to hold Molloys again.  The fingers of her left hand moved to rest against Richards, twining into them.  Jon noted that Sean and Ian had come to stand behind her.  Richard held Molloys eyes in a cold stare.  Raisa Dwa, he stated.  On Raisa Dwa, Christopher demonstrated the true meaning of honor, loyalty, and heroism.  We have held our tongue, all these years, and allowed your wild slanders to continue unchecked.  But now, at long last, it is time to make sure the truth is known.  It is time for Christophers reputation to be restored.  Molloys eyes were bright with panic, and she looked over to Xerxes, her tone wheedling.  Surely you cannot believe the wild ravings of these miscreants, she urged.  Nothing they say can have even a drop of truth in it.  Xerxes drew his eyes back to Richard.  Go on.  Richard nodded, his eyes never leaving Molloys.  Raisa Dwa was embroiled in a civil war.  The Collectives negotiating team was caught in the crossfire and Xerxes sent us in to rescue them.  The situation on planet was even more desperate than we had heard.  By the time we arrived, the safe-house the team was bunkered in was nearly destroyed.  The Irridium presence in the nearby mountains meant we had to get at least ten miles away before we could beam back up to our ship.  We desperately needed backup.  His gaze narrowed.  We knew that your ship was hiding in the nearby nebula, waiting to watch us fail.  Molloy huffed out in sharp disagreement.  We were there researching the cluster structure, she insisted.  We had no idea you were on planet or in trouble.  We sent your ship a distress signal, continued Richard, ignoring her interruption.  When we did not hear back in a few hours, the majority of us voted to run for it.  We knew your cowardice and antipathy.  We knew you would abandon us on the planet to face a brutal death.  Molloys face flushed crimson.  What utter balderdash, she snorted.  If I had known, of course I would have come to rescue you from your incompetence.  A ripple of muscle tightened along Richards arm, but the steady tone of his voice did not alter.  Only Christopher argued to believe in you.  He insisted that you would come; that your training and innate honor would win over any childish jealousies.  He took in a deep breath.  And so we waited.  His voice dropped.  For three long, hellacious days and nights we waited, while shells shook the stones from their foundations and rained shrapnel on us.  He looked down at Nicole for a moment.  When, at last, we were forced to abandon the remains of our shelter, Christopher felt the full burden of placing us in added jeopardy.  Our delay had given the enemy time to set up lava traps all along our route.  Those were the pet horror of this particular war.  A hybrid of quicksand and a bubbling cauldron, the trap looked like passable dirt road.  It would even hold a mans weight for a few steps.  The skin on his face tightened.  And then, that man would slowly sink, burning alive as he did.  He looked back across at Molloy.  Christopher insisted on going first, on testing all ground as we made our way toward the beam-up point.  He had several close calls, where the path gave way beneath him, but he was always able to crawl back out with only minor burns and injuries.  His lips pressed together.  We were nearly at the destination when two of the female delegates panicked.  They moved too quickly behind him, and their combined weight broke the top crust before he could stop them.  Their feet were all caught by the suction, and they were being pulled down.  His fingers twined into Nicoles, and he looked down for a moment.  Christopher grabbed each woman by the waist, and flung her with all his might back toward safety.  The action pushed him down deeper into the lava.  We tried to get to him, but the pool was too big.  There was no way to reach him.  Then he was sucked down, screaming in pain, all the while shouting for us to run, to get to safety, to get off the planet.  Molloy fumbled with her empty glass.  I had no idea you were in trouble, she muttered.  I was in the nebula.  I never heard any message.  Nicole slowly rose to stand at Richards side.  On her other side, Stephen stood as well.  Sean and Ian spread out to flank either side of their team.  Nicoles voice carried clearly across the room.  The announcement Xerxes and I were going to make in two days concerns a new form of communication my team has been testing for many years now.  Her eyes remained focused on Molloy.  It is a directed form of message beam.  It can create a pinpoint link between any two ships, regardless of cosmic interference.  She paused for a moment.  This style of transmission provides confirmation of receipt.  Xerxes swiveled his eyes to stare at Molloy.  His face held shock.  You received the message, and you did not act on it? Fury rose in Molloys face, her breath came in short draws, and then suddenly her anger burst from her, cascading in a shower of daggers.  How did she become the Golden Child? I had worked hard for my promotions, doing what had to be done, taking any route I could to victory.  I was the one who deserved the praise and attention.  And then this  She ran her eyes dismissively over Nicole.  This untried trollop comes waltzing into my world with her harem of miscreants, and suddenly I am cast aside? Her voice rose high.  She should be the one on trial, here, not me! Whatever that bitch does, whatever she says, it is as if God on high has come down and spoken through her mouth.  Not this time! Xerxess eyes became cool marbles.  Molloy, I think you will come join me on the command ship.  Now.  Molloys eyes sharpened.  I would like that.  Its long past time we got some things straight.  Xerxes gave a somber nod to Nicole, and then moved to stand next to Molloy.  A touch of the badge at his chest, and the two shimmered from sight.  Jon turned back to Nicole.  She was drawing in a deep, shuddering breath, and Jon could see that Stephen was supporting her from one side.  Richard spoke up.  A ten minute break, everyone.  Excited murmurings broke out all around them, but Jons world was solely the haunted pain in Nicoles eyes and the sturdy compassion of the four men who walked with her out to the balcony.  The door closed behind them, and they stood in a quiet group, isolated from the throngs at the party.  Jon wished with all his heart that he was there with them.       Nicole brushed the back of her hand across her eyes, wiping away the remaining tears.  She gave Richards hand a gentle squeeze before releasing it.  It is finally done, she murmured to the men around her.  Christopher can finally have the peace he deserves, after these eight long years.  She glanced back into the main room, and her eyes caught on Jon.  He was standing by the window, a drink in hand.  His gaze was steadily on the group, with an expression which was hard to read through the shimmering glass.  With an effort she drew her eyes away from him.  Shall we return to the game? By way of answer, Richard took a step forward and pulled open the door for her.  She walked through, and Jon fell in with the group as they made their way back to the table.  Jons voice was low and somber.  If there is anything I can do, you have but to ask.  She nodded in appreciation.  Do your best to win, she offered, her mouth quirking up in a half-smile.  That would be a pleasant distraction for the evening.  His eyes brightened with gentle amusement, and he gave a brief bow.  I shall do my best.  She settled into her seat, a sense of completeness washing over her as Richard and Stephen took their places on either side of her, as Ian and Sean resumed their watch from behind.  It was familiar and comfortable.  And if only  Her eyes automatically went to the right, to where Christopher would have sat alongside Stephen.  If only her dear, loyal companion were still alive.  Richards hand gently patted onto her own, and his eyes followed hers.  He lives in our memories, he murmured under his breath.  She gave a soft smile.  That he does.  Then the cards were in motion, and the symbols and numbers drew her out of her musings.  The play held a different timbre now.  It was steadier, deeper, more the stealthy creeping of a tiger and less the quick darting of a fox after a mouse.  Captain Smythe had taken over Xerxess cards, but in only a few hands he had folded, nodding his appreciation of the skill of the table.  The sense of a private game intensified, even with the throngs surrounding them.  Nicole knew these men around her, knew them intimately, knew every tweak of an eyebrow and lilt of a phrase.  She was sinking through the layers, watching for even the slightest hesitation.  There, Stephen was running his index finger along the top of his cards, just the tiniest of movements, but she held in a smile.  By Richards next bid, he had seen it as well, and in another round Stephen, too, had folded, shaking his head genially at his friends.  Perhaps someday she would advise him what gave him away.  But then again, perhaps not.  Now only Richard remained, with Jon flanking him.  She could feel Richards warmth at her side, steady, loyal.  She wondered for the hundredth time what his emotions must be as they began this weekend, this turning point which would change everything.  For so many years he had been her solid rock, the one she had depended on above the others.  He had been the last voice she listened to before making a decision.  And now it was likely he would be relegated to a secondary position.  Richard glanced up at her, then over to Jon at his other side.  He took up his glass, offering it in toast to Jon.  You are a talented player, Jon; one of the best I have ever seen.  If I were to lose to you tonight, I would consider myself thankful for the experience.  Jon nodded in appreciation and returned the toast.  As both man drank, Nicole could see it in Richards eyes, the respect and admiration that echoed to his very foundation.  A glow settled through her.  He was not simply resigned to the change which might soon overtake them all.  She forgot, sometimes, how deeply all of them felt it when their group was shattered.  She thought at times that only she could keenly sense the tear in their tightly-woven fabric.  Richard turned back to her, and he nodded quietly.  It is your move, he murmured.  Another round, and Richards cards were down.  He looked at them for a long moment, then shook himself and slowly moved his eyes between the people on either side of him.  He ran a hand fondly along Nicoles cheek, then stood and stepped back.  I leave the table to you, he stated evenly, melding smoothly back into the surrounding throng.  Nicole stared across at Jon, and time stopped.  His auburn eyes were rich, deep, and behind them she could sense the flickering of an immense pool, one currently hidden from sight.  She longed for that depth with all her heart, but she knew patience was critical.  The surface tension had become strong in his thirty years of life.  To sharply rupture it could mean disaster.  The world around them fell away, and every moment crystallized into the texture of his hand as it moved a chip, the sound of a card as it ruffled against its neighbor.  She glanced down at their respective pile of chips.  He was good  very good.  He could play it safe and draw her along for another twelve rounds.  She looked down again at her hand, carefully schooling her features to remain even.  There was no way he could beat what she now had been offered by the fates.  She had to draw him all in.  But how? Her eyes flickered toward the narrow door in the left wall, the one that had not been opened all night.  The one which led to the private room below this one, a special viewing room which held six people at the most.  And the treasure waiting on the table at its center.  Ian caught the motion and its significance.  His brow creased, and his lips pursed together.  He ran a hand along the top of his brush-cut hair.  Are you sure? She nodded at him.  His shoulders eased down in resignation, and he turned to disappear through the wall.  In a moment he had returned, cradling a square, bowling-ball sized box in both hands.  With a sigh he placed it between the two players.  Jons eyes lit up in curiosity, but he did not say a word.  He simply gazed at Nicole, waiting.  The corners of her mouth tweaked up in a smile.  My, but he was good.  She nodded, then reached forward to lift off the lid of the box.  With a flourish, she took hold of the glass neck of the squat bottle within, drawing it out and placing it securely on the table.  There was a rolling gasp of surprise around them as the throng took in the item.  The glass was turquoise in color, rich and glowing in the light, and the side of the bottle was embossed with a golden seal.  The local diplomat stepped forward, and his voice nearly cracked as he spoke, running a hand through his thick, blond hair.  Is that really  a bottle of hundred-year-old Hun liqueur? Nicole ran a fond hand along the side of the bottle.  Yes, it is, she confirmed.  She looked up at Jon.  I will add this to the pot, and consider it equal to your holdings.  It is that and more, agreed Jon with a nod.  He looked down again at the cards in his hand, then placed them face-down at the table.  He used both hands to push in his remaining coins.  Agreed.  All in.  Adrenaline surged through Nicole.  She had never faced an opponent like Jon, not in all of her years of gambling, and to be on the cusp of victory thrilled her soul.  She let the smile, finally, come to her lips, let the emotion surge through her as she leant forward and placed her cards face-up on the table.  A full house.  A warm murmur of approval echoed through the throng, and a scattering of applause.  Nicoles eyes held on Jons, ready for the sweet taste of victory, of his gracious capitulation.  But  there was that gleam in his eye, that gleam she knew so well, that she remembered from the battlefield at Kismet when they had stood two-hundred against two-thousand.  She remembered it from the night, so long ago, in the Paxton Hall, when they prepared to unveil the traitors plotting against them.  No.  It could not be possible.  His hand moved forward easily, steadily, and turned over his cards.  They were a royal flush.  She blinked.  In all her years of playing, from back-alley hellholes to elegant gold-etched parlors, she had not seen that hand more than four times.  It could not be true.  The roar went up from the crowd, the men at her side were patting him warmly on the shoulders, and her eyes moved from the cards up to his gaze.  He sat waiting, watching her.  His look melded with amusement, satisfaction, and something else, something warm and rich.  At last she brought herself to wave toward the pile with her hand, her eyes never leaving his.  It is all yours, then, she murmured.  Yours by right.  He leant forward.  She was intoxicated by the aroma, of musk, and spice, and something intangible which set her soul aflame.  His tone, when he spoke, was pitched for her ears alone.  His voice was rough.  All I have, you have but to ask, and it shall be yours.  He reached his left hand out for the bottle, snagging it by its neck, then drew himself easily to his feet.  He lowered his right hand to her, waiting, his eyes steadily on hers.  Nicole could scarcely believe it was real.  After the long years, after the longing and fears and heart-stopping efforts, he was there before her.  She slipped her fingers into his, and his were warm, sturdy, and all-together real.  He drew her to her feet beside him.  His eyes glanced over the men which stood around them, and his mouth eased into a smile.  We will all share this night together, he offered, holding up the bottle again.  Ians eyes sparkled, and in a moment he was leading the way for the group toward the small door.  They descended the tight, spiral staircase, and when they stepped into the small room Nicoles breath was caught, as it always was, by the spectacular beauty of it.  The room was barely ten feet in circumference, a round layout with glass all the way around.  Only the slimmest metal frames held each pane in place.  A red velvet bench with cushions circled the room, and the center pole held the spiral staircase.  All around them the open cavern yawned, with smooth rock and bubbling magma.  The construction of the glass kept away the heat, and it was a show of natures forces, constantly moving, always changing.  The men each stopped to take in the power of the display before finding their seat.  Jon waited until the rest were in their places before taking the open spot at Nicoles right.  She nodded at him, then reached to a button on the side of the staircase.  With a quiet click it retracted back up into the ceiling, and an ebony table rose from the floor.  He looked at the bottle in his hand for a long moment, then with a sharp twist he broke the seal on the cap, laying it down on the table.  He held the bottle out to the group in a toast.  To friendships, he offered, his eye moving to each man in turn and ending on Nicole.  And more, she expanded, flushing with a heat which did not come from the roiling liquid rock around them.  He nodded, then took a sip of the liquid.  His eyes closed in exquisite pleasure, and his breath eased through his lips.  It was a long moment before he blinked his eyes open again and passed the bottle to Nicole.  Her fingers brushed his as the bottle changed hands, and tingling electricity coursed through her body.  She looked down, holding herself in.  She had to go slowly.  Everything depended on it.  She yearned for his touch  she yearned  She blew out a breath, fighting off the desire.  She brought the bottle to her lips and sipped.  Ah, if anything could hold off her longing for Jon, even for a moment, this would be it.  The rich flavors of tangerine, vanilla, and hints of cinnamon swirled around her mouth, intoxicating her soul.  There was nothing in the world like it.  No replicator had ever managed to duplicate it.  And this was one of the only remaining bottles in existence.  A gentle nudge from her left brought her back to reality, and Richard was waiting there, his eyes dancing in delight.  He knew well where she had gone to, and she gladly handed the bottle over to him.  In a short while all present were lost in the intoxications of the liqueur, drifting in their personal memories of all it represented.  There was no need for words.  They had been together far too long for that.  There was simply the deep-seated joy in being side by side, the contented trust of a long-teamed pack of wolves curling up in their den after a long, arduous journey home.  The bottle had come around to her on its latest pass, and she took a sip, but it was hardly necessary.  The flavors coated her mouth, the emotions coated her soul, and she was utterly content.  Out of habit she eased against Richard, and his arm automatically came up around to support her, making a resting spot out of his broad chest.  Her eyelids fluttered closed.  Ians voice drifted into her thoughts.  Nearly two am, he advised the group.  And tomorrow is the final day of preparation.  Nicole nodded, not opening her eyes.  There was movement around her, a wrapping of arms, and Richard hefted her up against him as he stood.  She blinked her eyes open, and Jon was there before her, his eyes warm on hers.  He spoke to Richard without moving his gaze.  Take good care of her, he stated in a hoarse voice.  On my honor, I shall, agreed Richard.  It has been a privilege to keep her safe until now.  Something passed between the two men, an understanding that Nicole could not quite name, and then Jon stepped back.  He pressed the badge at his chest.  She was caught in his eyes.  They shimmered, and he was gone.         4  An insistent chime was sounding in Jons head.  It took a minute before it resolved itself into the ringing of his communicator.  He sat up in bed, shook his head to get his eyes to focus, and glanced at the clock.  Nine a. m.  Who in the world could be disturbing him at this hour? He wearily ran a hand through his hair before clicking the button.  Stephens face was there, fresh, alert, and a knowing grin spread across his face as he took in Jons disheveled look.  Officer living has made you soft, he teased.  Noon, on the Gumba plains, for some speed bike racing across the dunes? We should be done by then.  His mouth tweaked.  And little chance of pink-haired vixens bothering us at those speeds.  Jon was instantly awake; he pushed off the covers.  Yes, absolutely.  See you there, agreed Stephen, chuckling as his eyes moved to Jons hair.  And then he was gone.  It seemed as if the two hours eased by as molasses oozing down a gentle slope, and Jon swore his carpet was showing a ring from his feets constant movement by the time noon finally wrapped its way around.  He made his way to the teleporter room, gave the ID code of Stephens phone, and the world shimmered out of view.  He blinked against the bright sunshine.  He was standing in the shadow of a large bluff.  A grouping of finely crafted elm chairs around a rock maple table had been arranged alongside a winding stream.  A row of willows added a soft shhhh as their branches waved in the breeze.  Stephen was there at his side, and he raised a finger to his lips.  Jon nodded, his eyes moving over the group.  Nicole was standing by the table with six Cybians, their pale grey skin shimmering in the sun, their luxurious caftans of embroidered aquamarine and amethyst flowing delicately in the breeze.  They were offering her formal embraces.  Jons eyes moved outward from the group, and he saw the other members of the team stationed in a protective ring around the perimeter of the area.  Each wore an emerald outfit, a melding of the Collectives uniform and a softer, flowing material.  An elderly Cybian spoke to Nicole with warmth.  You know we appreciate all you do, Nicole, he praised.  Although how you spend time with those disgusting Patars is simply beyond our comprehension.  They are worse than slugs.  At least a slug knows its place.  I understand your view completely, assured Nicole, patting his arm.  The negotiations tomorrow will bring you exactly what you wish.  I promise it.  We have faith in you, intoned the Cybian.  And then they shimmered and were gone.  Nicole rolled her shoulders, then turned and smiled up at Jon.  Good morning, she called out with a smile.  She looked even more radiant than she had at the game last night.  Then she had been elegant and refined.  Now she was dressed in a loose-flowing dress of sapphire, and her hair danced in the breeze.  She held out a hand to him, and in a few short steps he had closed the distance between them to take it.  The group headed down to a dirt path that paralleled the stream.  She looked up at him as they walked.  So, is this your first visit to Glandy? He grinned.  No, but not that I could see it the first time.  She raised an eyebrow.  Oh? Some sort of a covert mission? And here I thought Glandy was known as a resort getaway.  He shook his head.  No, my parents came here on their honeymoon.  My mother always teased me that I was conceived under the full moon.  Her gaze stilled for a moment, and they walked a few steps in silence.  The willows whooshed in the breeze, and the brook burbled as it tumbled over a set of smooth stones.  He looked over.  How about you.  Have you been here before? She gave herself a shake, drawing back from the musings which had caught her.  Yes, certainly, she murmured.  A number of times.  She looked out over the dunes.  Its a special place.  It draws people from all over the galaxy with its landscapes.  He nodded.  Legend even has it that Nikita and one of her crew members came through here, escaping the assassins who had slain the rest of her group.  But, of course, nobody knows for sure.  Their trail simply vanishes.  Nicoles eyes went to the cliffs before them.  Her voice was a low murmur.  They vanished.  They rounded a bend and six air bikes waited for them, their lean metal shapes shining in the afternoon sun.  Then they were in motion, racing as a pack, skimming the dunes, curling around a towering mound, and sling-shotting off the top of a slope.  The cushion of air the bikes glided on sent trails of dust in their wake, and Jon laughed in delight as Nicole twisted in front of him, crossing his path to spiral around the edge of a dune.  The afternoon shimmered and spun, and it was all he could have wanted from life.  Nicole pulled away from the others, and he followed her as they moved closer to the cliffs, tracing their way up a narrow slope where the bikes could find traction.  The path was challenging, and Jon enjoyed the technical work involved, mentally mapping the next angle of attack and the proper place to cross over a fissure.  It seemed all too soon before the two had crested the bluff and come to a rest by a small stand of sagebrush.  Nicole smiled in satisfaction at him as she turned off her bike and dismounted.  You did well back there, she praised.  Many would have turned back.  Then they would not deserve the rewards, he grinned, looking out at the spectacular view.  The dunes and valley stretched out below them, twisting and undulating, a study in browns, reds, and ochres.  His gaze moved from the natural beauty to her upturned face.  For a long moment they stood there, together, and all else faded from view.  At last she gave herself a small shake, turning, breaking the eye contact.  She walked along the edge of the cliff, and he moved easily at her side, feeling as comfortable as if they had known each other for years.  Her voice eased out of her, soft and thoughtful.  This used to be one of my favorite spots, she murmured.  I adored it here; the sense of purity, of clean beauty.  The grains of sand eternally changing and morphing.  It would be where I came if I needed to nurture my soul.  Something in her tone of voice caught his attention.  And then what happened? She glanced down into the depths of the chasm before them.  Life happened, she replied, her tone haunted.  Life always happens.       Nicoles emotions echoed with the hollowness in her soul as she looked down into the dark depths of the shadows beneath her.  He had been lost.  She had searched, hoped, and waited, but he had been irrevocably taken from her.  His hand brushed hers; a frisson of electricity coursed through her system, pulling her from the depths.  He had been lost  and now he was found.  Somehow, incredibly, he was here, reborn, fresh at her side.  He had found her, just as Christopher had promised he would.  She had missed him for so long  She closed her eyes against the longing.  She just wanted one moment.  If she could just but lose herself in his embrace, just once, just for one long, all-encompassing moment  Snap! From the left, the sharp, unmistakable sound of a foot landing on a twig.  Adrenaline surged through Nicoles body.  Her entire world focused down into one, desperate thought.  She would not let it happen! She grabbed for her gun, drawing to shoot.  Her nightmare ticked off, frame by frame, in the sequence it did every night.  Her scream echoed off the bluffs; her fingers wrapped around the grip.  And there Jons body was, as it always was, as it did every night, despite every cell in her body screaming for it to stop.  He was leaping before her, shielding her with his lifes blood.  Her finger was squeezing the trigger, desperate to take the assassin down.  She was screaming  screaming  Her eyes caught the flash of emerald.  She veered her weapon just in time.  Two bolts of energy  one crimson, one the purest white - skimmed millimeters past Richards right side.  He froze in place mid-step, not a hair stirring, and for a long moment the world suspended.  And then her legs were buckling, Jons arm was around her, and Richard was running forward to help ease her to the ground.  Richards voice was hoarse.  My God, Nicole, I am so sorry.  I should have known.  Here, of all places, I should have thought  She shook her head, trembling, leaning against Jon, pressing her fingers against his chest.  He was alive.  Everything is all right, she murmured, relief coursing through her in wave.  Her nightmare had changed.  And if it could be changed  She leant in against him, and his arms came around her in a tight embrace.  Jon looked up at Richard, his eyes shadowed.  I nearly killed you.  Richard was shaking his head before Jon had finished.  I am the one who should have announced myself, especially on this bluff, he countered.  I knew better than that.  It is your quick reflexes  yours and Nicoles - which kept me alive.  Time passed, and Nicole soaked in the warmth of Jons body, the soul-saving relief that he was alive.  He was alive.  At last she drew back from Jons cocoon.  She ran a shaky hand through her hair and looked over at Richard.  You are sure you are unhurt? Richard brushed at his arm.  Had a good inch or so to spare.  She gave a soft laugh.  That much, then? He nodded, a smile coming to his lips.  Ive certainly had worse.  He looked between the two.  I was coming up to tell you that it is nearly six, he added.  We should be getting ready for tonights performance.  She moved to get to her feet, grateful for Jons steady arm at her side.  You are right, of course, she agreed.  Her hand was in Jons, and she looked up at him.  You will be there? Her heart thudded in her chest.  They had only been together for a scant day, and already the thought of parting from him for an hour filled her with a loneliness she could barely begin to fathom.  He nodded, his eyes full on hers.  It will be my honor.         5  Jon settled the handle to his saxophone case more securely in his grip as he eased his way through the noisy throng to Back Stage Suite A.  He had been in the Collective military for many years now.  He had faced civil wars, street riots, and ruthless gangs on backwater planets.  But there was a new kind of tension lacing through his shoulders tonight.  Nicole and her men had clearly earned the stellar reputation they enjoyed from all corners.  Somehow he fit as neatly in with them as if he had been carved by a master craftsman to nestle into their fine machinery.  It was not the challenge of finding his place, or of earning their respect which pulled on him with the sharpness of a razor-edged fishing hook.  It was the knowledge that it could all, within days, come to a soul-emptying end.  They would move on, and he would be left alone.  He would be abandoned with the keen awareness of all he had lost.  He took in a deep breath as he reached the silvery metal door, simply emblazoned with an embossed A at its center.  He let his breath out slowly and pressed open the door.  It was a smallish room, about twelve feet by ten.  Several padded chairs lay scattered around the periphery, along with a drum set, two guitars, several cases, and a collection of other miscellany.  The door eased shut behind him, and with it the din of the crowds vanished.  The room was apparently well soundproofed.  Three men were already here waiting for him.  Richard nodded in welcome, twirling a pair of drumsticks in one hand.  Right on time, he offered.  A trait I appreciate greatly.  He glanced down at the case.  That looks fairly new.  Jon nodded, giving it a gentle heft.  My parents were able to track down a classic Symborian on one of their vacations rim-ward, and they sent it along as a special present.  Richards eyebrows raised.  Special indeed, he agreed.  How does it play? Jons mouth turned up in a grin.  Like butter, he enthused.  The man was a genius.  Sean gave a strum on his guitar, an elegant creation of maple and rosewood.  A fine instrument should absolutely be treasured, he agreed.  The music one could make can fill the soul.  Jon nodded, then turned to Ian.  A bass guitar sat beside him in a stand, an understated work of art in ebony.  Yours? Ian nodded, his eyes holding Jons.  He stood, taking up the instrument and settling its strap around his shoulder.  He began playing a slow, steady progression.  Richard smiled and moved to sit behind the drum set.  The body shone with polish, the grain of the maple visible along each surface.  Soon a jazzy beat was counterpointing the bass line.  Seans strumming rhythm eased texture and movement to the music, weaving in and out with practiced ease.  Jon had his instrument out in moments, relaxing into the rhythm.  The men were leaving the room wide open for him, letting him guide the jam.  He put his lips to his instrument, and in moments his horn was layering into the mixture, setting a course.  The others took his lead, following with him as he wove in and out of the bass line.  Intrigued, Jon made an upward motion with his sax and, as the next measure rolled around, he slid the tune up a key.  The others followed with him smoothly, and Jon grinned, enjoying himself immensely.  It had been a while since hed played with musicians this talented.  From behind him, a lead guitar joined in the mix, mirroring his own melody in harmony.  Jon glanced back and nodded at Stephen, welcoming him.  Then his eyes moved further right, and he nearly hitched his note before he steadied himself.  Nicole was stunning.  The liquid gold dress draped along each curve of her body, bringing her athletic form into perfect relief.  Her hair curled at her shoulders, soft, inviting, and her full lips called to him with a power he could barely resist.  She smiled at him, sultry, knowing, and then she parted her lips.  A sirens song intoxicated his soul.  She sang with a deep, rich alto, and at first she simply let her voice float, wordless, along with the flowing melody.  It was as if her body was the finest instrument, and he was struck with the staggering desire to play her, to bring her to her fullest heights.  He fought to control his passions, refocusing his efforts, altering the tune slightly to segue into a well-known classic.  The group slid into the song without any hesitation, and Nicoles eyes glowed as the lyrics flowed out, rich with longing and desire.  They slid into another song, then another, and the music was all there was.  A loud knock at the door brought the group to an immediate halt, and Jon shook himself at the interruption, at the sudden cessation of the divine sound.  Sean went to the door, listened for a moment, then turned and nodded.  Five minutes; wed better get on stage, he informed the others with a grin.  Looks like we lost track of time here.  Jon took his saxophone from around his neck, nodding his thanks to the group.  It had been a privilege to jam with them, and an experience he would never forget.  Nicoles mouth quirked, and she moved to stand before him.  You have well proven your ability to work with our team, she offered in a low voice, her tone rich.  We would be honored to have you on stage at our side.  She was so close, he could feel the heat radiating from her form.  The urge to reach out and trace her face was almost uncontrollable.  His voice was rough.  I would like that.  She nodded.  Then she was turning.  The group moved from the quiet seclusion to the thunderous applause of the gathered throngs.  Jon knew in a remote corner of his mind that he should be nervous.  There were hundreds of important people gathered in the hall before them, expecting a high quality performance.  He had only jammed with these musicians for an hour at most, and had no idea what was on their set list.  But from the first moment of Nicoles announcement to the crowd of the songs name, to Stephens steady intro beat, Jon was immersed.  The groups musicianship was superb.  He was familiar with most of the songs, and the few he did not know, the others deftly guided him through the change with a nod or a whispered comment.  Each team members role in the group shone through in their playing.  Richard was the steady, reliable beat that all turned to in order to keep them together.  Ians understated, foundation bass line was always there.  Seans rhythm guitar added texture and interest.  Stephens lead guitar brought energy and fire.  Jon turned to Nicole, and her look caught at his very soul.  Her voice purred and curled around his notes, caressing them, holding them with tender harmony before releasing them to glide to new heights.  It was intoxicating.  Looking out at the crowd, he could see that they were enthralled with the music, with the passion put into aural pleasure.  Applause filled the air, and Nicole leant over, putting her hand over the microphone for a moment.  Her eyes shone.  I had not quite realized, until tonight, just what our music had been missing, she murmured.  Jons body flared with longing, and then they were in motion again, soaring, cascading, dancing for the world to see.  Ians steady eyes caught his attention, and the bassist flicked his gaze toward the front row of tables.  Jon waited a moment, then on the next chorus he turned slightly to see what Ian was motioning at.  It was strange he had not caught it before.  Where the rest of the audience was enthralled, almost lost in the music, the three swarthy Mercodians at the front table had eyes only for Nicole.  It was not a gaze of transfixed appreciation or even of raw lust.  Rather, the leather-geared trio was watching her with clinical evaluation, their eyes moving from the sculpted muscles of her arm to the firm stretch of her calves.  Jon looked back at Ian and gave a slight nod.  Mercodians were well known bounty hunters, ruthless and persistent.  He would be sure to stay close to Nicole from the moment the last encore ended.         6  Nicole sighed in exhausted contentment as she gave a final wave to the thunderous throngs and led the men off stage.  Three encores.  The crowd was insatiable! The door to the suite closed behind them, and it took a moment for her ears to adjust from the intense wall of noise to the hushed quiet.  A low ebony table at the center of the room held a pair of silver ice buckets, each presenting a bottle of Champagne.  Alongside them sat a ring of pink, chilled shrimp.  She was starving.  She sat in relief in one of the chairs, reaching forward for one shrimp, then two, her stomach rumbling.  At her side Richard eased open one of the bottles so it made the softest of sighs.  He poured out flutes for each person present.  The men settled down in a circle, and Richard held up his glass to the group.  A toast.  To fine teamwork.  To fine teamwork, came the echo, and each class clinked around to all others before they were lifted to grateful lips.  Oh, that was good.  She liked to stay sharp when performing, and this was her first drink of the night.  It made the first sip that much more wonderful.  She glanced at the bottle and smiled in appreciation.  Martin had certainly gone beyond the call of duty with this vintage.  She would have to offer him special praise.  It was delicious.  At her right, Jon took another sip, and she leaned her head against him in fondness.  He had been amazing, as she knew he would be.  He turned his head so his lips were against her forehead for a moment, and she smiled up at him.  Then she was leaning forward for a few more shrimp.  The men waited patiently, in no rush, sipping and eating as they came down from the energy of the performance.  Finally she sat back, and all eyes came expectantly to hers.  She took another drink of her Champagne, then began.  Tonight was an absolute pleasure.  End each of you deserves praise for helping that to happen.  I am sure this performance will be talked about for years to come.  The men nodded to each other, acknowledging what they had created together.  Which brings us, added Nicole, her tone edging with sturdiness, to the rest of this evenings plans.  As we had expected, kidnappers have been put in play.  To use Mercodians is not overly subtle, but then again neither of these groups are exactly the subtle type.  The hiring party probably knew of the Mercodians by reputation only and decided that they should go with the best.  She chuckled.  And the Mercodians, being the cocky bastards that they are, probably didnt think twice about making their presence so obviously known.  So we move forward with our plan.  Nicole took another sip of her bubbly, putting the glass down on the table.  As agreed.  Ill head out alone to the bar district.  This will give the kidnappers their chance to grab me.  When I sense them closing in, Ill broadcast the code word.  You come in, we capture them, and interrogate them.  Then, finally, we can find out just who is behind these growing interruptions to the negotiations.  Jon stared around the group as if they had lost their minds.  He voice burst from him as if tearing through well-wrapped bindings.  You must be kidding! Youre going to use Nicole as human bait against three Mercodians? Nicoles temper flared with heat.  We have been over this a thousand times! If you had a better idea, you should have brought it up - Suddenly she realized that the other men were looking at her with looks indicating two things.  One, they agreed fully with what Jon was saying.  And, two  It hit her in a flash that Jon had not been at any of those meetings.  He had fallen in with them so easily, had seemed such a natural part of the team, and she had completely forgotten .  She flushed crimson, looking down at her hands.  When she spoke again, her tone was tempered.  I apologize.  We have been so comfortable with you, these past few days, that I completely lost track that - Jons tenseness eased, and he nodded in understanding.  Ill take that as a compliment, he responded in a gruff voice.  His tone became edged However, if acting as a helpless lure is really is your master plan, then I insist on an alternative.  I will stay by your side.  Stephen leapt on the idea.  Nicole, you wouldnt take any of us because our reputations as fighters are well known.  But the kidnappers wouldnt fear Jon.  If anything, it would make them less wary.  If it was just you, alone, they would sense a trap.  Why would you be out on your own, after having guards around you all day long? If you were out walking with a new lover, it would explain why the rest of us would be sent away.  Warring emotions battled within Nicole.  Each minute away from Jon was sheer torture.  She could feel the sliding of grains in the sand-clock as a physical sensation.  The negotiations would be over in a few days.  Every moment was precious.  And yet, this was no casual evening out.  Mercodians are not known for their gentle nature, she warned.  While we have reason to believe they only mean to kidnap me until after the truces deadline has passed, they might have little qualms about killing you, Jon.  Her voice roughened.  I could not take on that responsibility.  Jon was shaking his head even before she finished.  I swore an oath to uphold the Collectives protection.  That includes those planets who wish to join us, he pointed out in resolute determination.  This clearly is an important treaty to get signed.  If my life needs to go on the line to help ensure its success, I will do that without hesitation.  Nicole hesitated, but the weight of her trusted friends gazes was heavy on her.  They all knew this was the best course of action.  She reluctantly admitted that in her own heart she agreed with them.  She just wished that fate had not created this dilemma for her.  If Jon was hurt  She took in a deep breath.  He would not be.  They were all trained soldiers, and these were only three kidnappers.  She looked up into Jons eyes.  His gaze was firm and resolute.  Thank you, she said simply.  I whole-heartedly accept your offer.  Richard glanced at the clock on the wall.  You two should head out shortly then, he suggested.  That way it seems like a natural progression from the bands conclusion to your walk.  He stood up and turned to Jon, who stood as well.  Richard pinned a diamond pin beneath the lapel of Jons uniform, where it was not visible.  The code word is orange, he said as he straightened the lapel over the pin.  The pin will pick that up and send it to the rest of us.  Do you have a glasblade? Jon reached down and tapped the side of his boot.  On an inside sheath, he responded.  Im well trained with it.  I may not have the reputation of your group, but I can hold my own in a fight.  Richard eyed him for a moment, then nodded.  His voice dropped to a low murmur.  We are trusting you with the most precious object in our world.  Jon held his gaze evenly.  His voice was a vow.  I will be worthy of that trust.  An easing came to Richards shoulders.  I know you are, he agreed, then took a step back.  Nicole held a hand out to Jon, and he turned, gazing at her for a long moment.  Then he took her hand in his own, bringing his head down for a courtly kiss.  Her heart melted at the touch, at the warm, steady texture of his fingers against hers.  She shook away her feelings with effort.  Three Mercodians were no laughing matter.  She had to be on her most alert behavior tonight, if they were all to get through this in one piece.  She looked around at the other four men in the room, meeting the gaze of each man for a moment.  The closeness of the group, the steady focus in their eyes, filled her with a warmth which went into the depths of her soul.  Her mind of its own volition switched to the Hun language.  For honor.  The men responded in one voice.  For honor.  Then she turned, leading Jon out into the quieting hall.         7  Nicole glanced around at the nearly empty room.  The large marble hall seemed much different with most of the guests having returned to their ships or rooms for the night.  The paper lanterns and colored lights sent dappled pools of shadow and stripes of color across the elegant floor.  Moonlight streamed in through the tall open windows down one side of the room.  Nicole led Jon towards the far wall, finding the door amongst the windows and heading out into the cool summer night.  Nicole knew they were on a dangerous mission, but she could not help to be swept up in the swirling emotions of a midnight interlude.  The flowers in the garden sent up an intoxicating aroma.  The moon trickled a silvery glow across the world, edging the petals and leaves with brilliance.  And Jon  She glanced up at the man at her side, and warmth flooded through her.  He was all she could want in a man.  His movements were sturdy and strong, and his eyes held a calm focus that nothing would deter.  He matched her step, moving easily alongside her as if they had been together for years.  A chill settled over her shoulders as she was reminded of the danger the night posed.  The bartender was an old friend of hers; he might provide an extra blade in the coming fight.  She glanced down the deserted path as they moved from the main gates and into the town proper.  She did not see the Mercodians, but that was to be expected.  She had no doubt that they were keeping track of her movements and would make their move once she was somewhere vulnerable.  Somewhere like an empty bar.  Up ahead, a local guard turned a corner and began walking down the quiet street toward the couple.  Nicole cursed under her breath.  If the guard recognized her, he might insist on accompanying the couple to provide protection.  She did not want anything to dissuade the Mercodians from acting sooner rather than later.  On impulse, she spun her back against the shop wall they were passing, pulling Jon hard against her.  Jon moved with her on instinct, and his eyes followed hers toward the guard.  He eased to the left, providing more cover.  Nicole glanced sideways as the guard approached.  He might still recognize her  Without thinking, she entwined her hand in Jons hair, pulling his head down to her neck.  Jon didnt need a second hint.  He pressed fully against her, shielding her with his body, his arms sliding up against her back.  Nicoles world illuminated in a golden glow.  It was if her soul had been hollow for her entire life, and it suddenly had been filled.  She had not realized how empty she had been until this moment.  If they could just stay this way, forever, without moving, without turning  just to be held in his arms  With an effort, Jon pulled back from her, his breath coming in deep draws.  His eyes were smoky with desire, and his voice was rough.  I think the guard is gone, Nicole.  Nicole wanted nothing else than to pull Jon down against her again, and damn the Mercodians.  Jons nearness was intoxicating.  It took all of her willpower to nod in agreement, to slide her hand down his chest to put a little space between them.  Right, you are right, she murmured.  She took a deep, steadying breath, forcing herself to set one foot in front of the other, to move down to the bar.  She needed her focus.  She was not a schoolgirl out on her first date.  She knew she must put this passion out of her thoughts  for now.  The outside of the bar was nondescript  a dingy window that could not be seen through, a small, fading wooden sign with the name AleHous.  Nicole pushed open the cracked door, waited in the doorway for a moment, allowing her eyes to adjust to the dim interior.  It looked as it always had.  The grey bar to the left with a scattering of stools, the four booths on the right with cracked plastic benches.  The small stage up front with faded plywood and a grand piano which had seen far better days.  Mark looked up from the bar, and was it her imagination, but did his glance seem a shade more furtive, a hint ashamed? Then it was gone, and he was waving her over with a smile.  Welcome, welcome, called the middle-aged man, the wrinkles on his weathered face showing the toll of his hard life.  The usual, I assume? Jon nodded.  Two, he agreed, a slur in his voice, half leaning over the bar.  Nicole held in a smile.  He certainly was doing his best to seem inoffensive.  By the looks of him, he would barely make it over to the booth.  Mark moved to the back of the bar for a moment, gathering the supplies, and then he was turning with a pair of tall, thin glasses sporting a dark purple concoction.  Enjoy! Nicole took the two glasses from him and moved deeper into the bar, to the booth furthest from the door.  She paused by the seat facing the door.  Why not sit next to me, so we can get to know each other better, she murmured.  He glanced at the door, then nodded, easing into the booth.  He gave the table a nudge forward so that it settled against the far bench, giving them more room.  She slid in next to him, setting the two drinks down before them.  She raised her glass.  Suddenly the dim shadows of the bar, the closeness of his breath, reminded her of the lingering tingles coursing through her body from the passionate embrace they had shared.  Her voice became husky.  To our first night alone together, she murmured.  His eyes grew smoky, and it was a moment before he clinked his glass against hers.  He brought his glass to his lips, and she noted with satisfaction that he did not drink; only gave the appearance of doing so.  She mimicked his actions.  If Mark had indeed turned on her, drugging their drinks might be the first step in the evenings adventures.  She put her drink onto the table.  So, Jon, tell me about your childhood, she whispered, running a finger along his arm.  He shivered under her touch, and she knew that she should stop distracting him, but the mans presence was too compelling to resist.  It was only by staying in contact with him that she could resist the stronger draw to pull him against her, to feel his strength, to lose herself in the embrace which reached into her soul.  My  childhood  he ground out hoarsely.  It was idyllic.  Serene and contented.  She blinked in surprise, momentarily shaken out of her emotions.  What? His gaze narrowed in concern.  Why, what had you heard? She shook her head, regaining her ground.  Oh, nothing at all.  Please, go on.  He eyed her for a moment, then nodded.  My parents had both done their stint in the military forces.  My father had been a medic, my mother a front-line marine.  I was an only child and had everything I could want in life.  When it came time for me to choose the next step in my life, they were supportive of my desire to enlist.  She smiled, shaking her head in wonder.  A quiet childhood, parents who loved you, free of trauma or political games.  Good for you.  His gaze was steady on hers.  So I take it your childhood was less than ideal? There was a movement at the door.  Three burly figures strolled in, standing in the entryway while the door swung closed behind them.  Marks eyes flitted nervously between the newcomers and the booth.  Nicole stood, giving a long, languid stretch, her eyes moving to the piano.  Mark, I think I will sing us a song for the night.  You missed my performance earlier.  She glanced down at Jon.  If you will accompany me? Of course, he agreed, moving to his feet, walking with her the short distance to the stage.  She slid her hand down his arm to catch at his fingers, pulling him with her to ease around behind the piano.  She drew her eyes up to his, and strength coursed through her at the steady, determined look in his eyes.  The corner of her mouth turned up in a wry smile.  I think our song should be Rhapsody in Orange.  What do you think? His gaze did not leave hers.  I will follow wherever you lead.  There was a movement, and the three Mercodians took several steps into the center of the bar area, separating out to flank the width of the narrow room.  The center one, more rugged than the other two, spoke up.  You know why we are here, Nicole.  This is a business transaction.  Let us get it over with.  Nicole glanced over at Mark, who was cowering against the far wall of the bar.  Her voice was calm.  Business? Mark winced.  I am sorry, Nicole, he rasped.  The Mercodian laughed.  Not sorry enough to turn down your fee, he coldly pointed out.  Nicole kept her voice even.  And who is it that paid your fee? she asked lightly.  The Mercodian shrugged.  While some of our clients want their name known throughout the galaxy, these particular individuals paid extra for discreteness.  Nicole raised an eyebrow.  They wanted to be discreet, and they hired Mercodians? He grinned at that and gave a short bow.  I did not say they were smart, he agreed.  He drew his weapon, and the two men at his side matched his move.  And now, Nicole, I do recommend that you come quietly.  While I was instructed to bring you in alive, I was not told to bring you in unharmed.  His grin grew toothy.  And Caleb was a dear friend of mine.  The man to his right snarled.  She is the one who killed Caleb? His gun lifted, and Nicole barely had time to duck beneath the piano before a blast blew a hole in the wall behind her.  Jon was crouched by her side; his gun was in his hand.  He bent under the piano and fired.  A loud retort echoed through the room.  The smaller Mercodian was thrown back against the bar, a chunk of his arm missing.  His howls of pain filled the room.  The remaining two Mercodians dove for cover, and Nicoles shot barely missed the lead mans chest as he tucked behind a bar stool.  A heavy blast came from the left, slamming into the piano, sending shrapnel of wire and timber flying in all directions.  Jon threw himself over Nicole, shielding her with his body as the splintered rain came down on their heads.  The heavy Mercodians voice shot out in anger.  Alive, you fool! he reminded his fellow.  The door to the bar burst open.  Richard and Stephen charged into the room, two sharp blasts stunning the Mercodians into unconsciousness.  Behind them, Ian and Sean rushed in, their guns sweeping the room and coming to rest on Mark.  Seans voice called out in Hun.  Six.  Ian took a careful step toward Mark.  Five.  Stephen strode forward to kneel behind the Mercodian sprawled face-down by the booth.  Four.  He jammed his gun into the small of the mercenarys back.  Richard stood over the lead Mercodian.  Three.  He reached for the restraining ties at his belt with his left hand.  Jons voice came from close at her side.  Two.  He then blinked as if in surprise.  Nicole knew she should speak, knew that it was her turn in the sequence to let them know she was all right.  But her tongue was heavy, and the world was weaving in and out of focus.  She looked down and saw to her surprise that a coiled, silver spring was implanted deep into her chest.  Crimson blood was slowly bubbling up around the wound.  Jons eyes swung down to meet hers.  His voice called out, sharp with urgency.  Nicole is hit!           Jons heart nearly stopped as Nicoles eyes closed and she fell back, unconscious, in his arms.  The chest wound was serious, and he knew it was beyond his ability to care for.  Richard had finished tying the hands of the Mercodian at his feet, and he motioned to Sean with his head.  Sean, get them back to the ship.  Institute a total lock-down.  Nothing gets in or out.  I will take care of things here.  Sean was in motion before Richard finished speaking, coming to kneel beside Nicole, placing his hand around the wound as a dam.  He tapped the badge at his chest.  The three shimmered into nothingness.  Jon was barely aware of the space they teleported into; a standard enough transport room, sized for six individuals standing fairly close together.  A red light flashed over Nicoles head as they came into full presence, and Sean glanced up at it.  He still had his hand pressed carefully on Nicoles wound.  His voice was even but quick.  You lift her; I will lead the way.  Jon curled his arms beneath her still form, and in a moment the two were moving across a narrow hallway and into an infirmary.  The turquoise walls were organized with transparent shelves fronted by closed glass doors.  A single bed took up the center of the room; Jon laid Nicole down carefully on its padded surface.  Sean kept his hand against the wound while with his other he reached up and pulled down a robotic brain on a swivel mount.  All right then, let us see what we have, he murmured.  Jon slid his arms out from beneath her, laying her hand at her side before stepping back.  Sean took a deep breath, then released his own hand from the wound, giving the medical robot a clear area to work with.  The unit began with a quick sweep down her entire body, moving in a smooth glide from head to toe.  Then it reset itself squarely above her chest.  Thin arms emerged to connect to the screw.  Its voice was soothing and clinical as it gently twisted the screw free.  One metal screw, penetrating two inches, punctured lung, no major blood vessels, it reported.  Lasers carefully cauterized the wound as the screw unfurled itself from her chest.  Other beams lit into action, delivering medicine and anesthesia.  Sean exhaled in relief.  Thank God, he muttered.  That could have been far worse.  The robot finished and slid to Nicoles right thigh.  Hairline fracture, right thigh, it reported evenly, sending out a beam of emerald light.  Jon shook his head in confusion.  Her thigh? But the piano was nowhere near  The machines voice answered smoothly.  Thigh injury is six months old.  It then slid down and left.  Double break, left calf.  Sean rolled his eyes.  Let me guess, nine months ago.  You are correct, answered the robot without pausing in its work.  Jon looked at Sean, shaking his head again as the robot moved on to her arm.  What, does she not like medical robots? Seans eyes lost some of their shadows.  She hates them like the plague, he agreed, the corner of his mouth tweaking up.  The only time we can get her fixed up is when shes drunk or knocked unconscious by something.  The robot moved a few more times, then drew up to a resting position.  All major repairs completed, it reported calmly.  I count forty-seven minor injuries still untreated.  Shall I begin? Sean shook his head.  No, she will be irate enough that we let you get this far, he sighed.  He glanced over at Jon.  Could you get her to her room and settled in? I should check in with Richard to see if they need help.  Of course, agreed Jon without hesitation.  He gathered Nicoles form up in his arms.  Sleeping quarters are to the left, pointed Sean.  Then he was in motion to the right, moving at a quick pace.  Jon took a step out into the hallway, turning left.  In a moment the hall opened up into a large, circular room.  The center area had a well-polished mahogany table with six chairs around it.  A bank of windows overlooked the swirling clouds of the planet beneath them.  The connecting rooms each had a name presented on it with black, embossed letters.  Nicoles was on the far left.  He moved up to it, then took her hand in his and waved it past the entry plate on its right side.  The door silently slid open.  He stepped into the room  and stopped.  He had been in many rooms over his thirty years of life, rooms of elegance, rooms of austerity, rooms that were glittering with jewels and oozing with atmosphere.  But never had he been in a room which felt so .  Right.  A large bed lay to the left, with an ebony and turquoise design which mimicked the flow of grain in marble.  Matching curtains were pulled closed over the two windows.  An open door to the far right led to a washroom, and a large display case to his right held a collection of weapons, photos, and other items.  A heavy, intricately embroidered cloak from the Sullon Empire was hung as a display tapestry on the far wall.  The floor was polished ebony wood.  He moved forward to the bed, laying her down on it, and easing off her high heels.  He gently rolled her on her side to unzip the back of her golden dress.  Her voice came in a mumble from against the pillow.  Dont let them use the machine on me, she insisted.  His mouth quirked into a smile.  No more than necessary, he promised.  We have to get you out of this dress.  She leaned against him as he eased her to sit up, her back to him.  She dutifully raised her arms over her head, and he slipped the dress free of her body.  She dug beneath her pillow for a moment, pulled out a flannel top, and drew it down over her torso.  Then she was sliding up the pants over her bottom half.  Jon eased down the covers, and in a moment she was beneath them, collapsing wearily back against the pillow again.  He gently lay the covers back up over her shoulders.  She drew his arm over her waist, curling up against it, his hand against her chest.  Stay, Nath, until I fall asleep.  He tensed, wondering who Nath was, but then she snuggled against him again and he eased down at her side.  She had nearly been killed.  The reality of the danger settled down on his shoulders.  He lowered his head to her neck, pressed a gentle kiss against the soft flesh there, and thanked all the Gods that she had made it through.  It was under ten minutes when soft snores were easing from her body, and he was able to gently extricate his arm from her sleeping form.  He stood, looking down at her for a long moment, then turned to look again at the room.  The display case caught his eyes, and he moved toward it.  The pair of long knives on the top shelf  they seemed familiar.  Had he seen images of them before, on one of the websites about the team, perhaps? The one on the left was smaller, elegant in design, while the one on the right seemed sturdier.  His hand moved to it of its own accord, and it slipped into his grasp as if it was made for it.  He did an experimental swing, then two, sighing in delight at the delicate balance.  The weapon was made by an artisan.  He tossed it in the air, giving it a triple spin, and it landed solidly in his hand, ready for the next blow.  On the shelf there was a hair pin to one side, a pattern of a wolf head on it.  He traced a finger along it, lost in thought.  It seemed so familiar, so important.  The shelf beneath had a photo in a simple, iron frame, and he took it out.  He recognized the group immediately.  It was Nikita, the last crown princess of the Huns, killed thirty years ago at the end of a violent civil war.  But it was a photo he had never seen before.  Nikita and her band were shown standing in what appeared to be a restaurant of some sort, quiet and elegant, and their faces held a haunting focus which called to him.  Everyone was there.  Krissolion, who had been killed on an espionage mission on the night of the final speech.  Rikindo, Stefford, Shawnald, and Eyanapolis, who had been slain by assassins as their world made its tumultuous transition to a democracy.  And there, by her right side, was Nathan, her Knight.  Jon looked between the two figures.  All through the past thousand years the tradition had been maintained.  The crown princess had come from the Hun family and had married outside the six main noble houses.  It was through her lineage that the family line traced.  And through those same thousand years, the Knight family had offered up to her a sworn protector, a man loyal only to her.  He took no wife, had no children, and focused solely on her safety.  There was a movement at the door; he carefully put the photo back into its spot.  Stephen stepped into the room, smiling as he found Nicole sound asleep in her bed.  That is good.  So she did not put up much of a fuss? No fuss at all, agreed Jon.  I think she was more worried about the robot than the wound.  Stephens mouth creased into a smile.  She would be, he agreed.  Come on, let me fill you in.  Jon gave one last look at Nicole, then followed Stephen as the two headed out of the room.  Stephen pulled to a stop by the table in the center of the room.  Richard has held a tight rein on any knowledge, and so far the story is that you and Nicole have been seriously injured or killed.  I realize this will upset your shipmates, but I would ask that you let it ride until morning.  This could be critical in our finding out what is going on here.  Jon felt a twinge of guilt at causing grief for his friends, but he nodded.  Of course, I understand.  Stephen nudged his head to the right.  That last room on the right was Christophers room; feel free to use that for the night, he commented.  In the morning, just come out in your bathrobe if you wish.  We are casual here.  Once we have all had our morning glogg, we will figure out our plan of action.  Jons brow creased.  Surely the negotiations will not go on as planned tomorrow morning? Stephen glanced at Nicoles closed door.  That will be up to Nicole to decide, but I imagine she will say yes, he stated.  Very little will cause her to slow once her path is set.  Somehow she will find a way to make this work.  His face shadowed.  That was a wild fluke, with the piano sending shrapnel.  Thank you for keeping her alive.  His gaze held Jons.  When this is all over with, whatever I can give you, it is yours.  Jon nodded.  I appreciate it, but no gift is necessary, he countered.  I could not have seen her come to harm.  Stephen looked into his eyes as if seeking something.  Then he let out his breath, turned, and headed back toward the bridge.       Jon wearily stumbled out of the door, easing his arm through the bathrobes sleeve.  He had only slept perhaps seven hours, but once he had woken he found it impossible to go back to sleep.  He blinked, thinking the main room empty, but a second glance showed him that a figure was sitting in a chair by the bank of windows, a cup of a steaming beverage in one hand.  Richard turned and smiled.  Good morning, he offered.  Jon shook his head, running a hand through his tousled hair.  Do you ever sleep? Not much, agreed Richard.  How would you like a cup of glogg? Is that a Hun drink? asked Jon, searching his memory.  Richard nodded, moving toward the replicator.  A murmured command, and in a moment a mustard-yellow mug swirled into view, fragrant and steaming.  Jon picked it up with both hands, gave it a cautious sniff, then drew in a taste.  His shoulders eased in pleasure.  This is quite good, he offered with a smile.  I thought you might enjoy it, agreed Richard, and the two went to sit before the windows again.  Jon marveled at the easy silence that connected the two of them.  There was no need to fill the space with talk.  He knew that eventually the rest would come, the day would begin, and all would be said.  For now it was simply the two of them, preparing for whatever it was the world would throw at them.  After a while Ian came out to join them, quiet, his eyes steady on the mug in his hands.  Then it was Stephen, groaning and stretching, and Sean, muttering about the incompetencies of the local police force.  Jon glanced at Nicoles closed door, then raised an eyebrow to Richard.  He chuckled.  Another twenty minutes, I would say, he murmured.  It was closer to thirty before her door slid open, and she staggered, still in her pajamas, over to the table.  Ian moved without a word to the replicator, retrieved an emerald green mug, and placed it before her.  Her eyes were barely open as she brought the mug to her nose, breathed in a deep inhale, and then took in a long swallow.  The sigh that resulted seemed almost soul-deep.  The men turned and moved their chairs to join her around the table.  She ran a hand through her hair, blinking once or twice, before beginning.  Ian.  The Mercodians were definitely hired by the Cybians, he told the group.  But we lose track of the finances once it gets into their banking system.  You know how infamously labyrinthine that is.  It would take us years to unravel.  She nodded.  Stephen? Only Mark seems to be involved, on-world, he reported.  There seems to be no infiltration of the local police or other agencies.  He snorted.  They are wildly incompetent all on their own, he muttered.  Nicole gave a low laugh.  Hardly a new thing, she pointed out.  Sean? You were impaled a full two inches by a sharp metal screw, he ground out.  If you had not had Jon there  Her hand went to the spot on her chest, and her eyes narrowed.  You set that insane mechanical laser beam loose on me, didnt you? Sean nodded.  Absolutely I did.  And while it was in there  Nicoles voice tightened.  In there?? Sean put his hands up in surrender.  A figure of speech, nothing more.  In any case, you are fine.  Nicole pulled her robe tighter against her body.  Of course I am fine.  I will be even more fine if that conglomeration of needles and lasers stays far away from my body.  Richards voice eased smoothly into the mix.  Jon did save your life, he pointed out.  She nodded, and her eyes came open fully as she turned to look at Jon.  Yes, you did, she said to him.  When this is all over, I will show my thanks more properly.  He took her hand in his, looking from the slender, strong fingers to the fierce resolution in her eyes.  God, she was beautiful.  Even right out of bed, after a night of fighting against ruthless bounty-hunters, she was everything he could hope for.  I need nothing at all, but to know you are safe, he murmured.  A smile creased her lips.  And yet, maybe you would be pleased by something more, she countered.  His body flared with desire at the memory of her ivory skin beneath his arm as she lay on the bed; at the sense of completion when he had embraced her in the midnight streets.  He could see the effort it took her to turn her head, to look back to Richard.  Richard, your report? We have kept all news of your status completely hidden from every person beyond those at this table, he stated.  Our ship is shielded.  The common talk is that you were slain and that Jon here was seriously injured.  That might work to our advantage.  She templed her fingers, pressing her brow down against them.  Good, good, but how? She drew her eyes to the man at her right.  Jon? He had been giving this very question thought while staring down at the planet, sipping his glogg with Richard by his side.  The question had spun around within his brain, swirled, and over time had intertwined with what he had heard of the Cybian culture.  He held her gaze, wondering if she would undertake what he proposed.  I think you should become a phoenix.  She blinked more awake at that, and looked around the table at the other men before returning her gaze to his.  What, the Cybian myth? He nodded.  They believe in their myths and legends quite strongly.  While they say they do not run their lives by them any more, I have seen more than one tap his heel twice at bad luck or twist a ring at the mention of a death.  It is too deeply embedded in their society to brush away.  Richard leant forward with interest.  The phoenix is their legend of someone murdered, seeking revenge.  The phoenix will rise from the dead, with five avenging angels in silver, to offer the murderer one last chance at redemption.  If he does not take it, they will wipe out his entire family, to the last distant relative.  Nicole looked again at the five men arrayed before her.  So we teleport in, dressed in silver? Jon nodded.  And we do not say a word.  We simply look at the Cybians, and you start to slowly raise your hand.  I have a feeling whoever is guilty will cave in and admit his guilt rather than sentence his entire family to death.  Stephens eyes sparkled.  I seem to recall it was a fairly horrific death, too, he commented.  No quick turning to ash here.  Nicole tapped her lip.  It does seem elegant, and likely to bring results, she agreed.  Any comments or questions? Sean chuckled.  Compared to some of our recent plans, this is a downright walk in a rose garden.  Nicole downed the rest of her glogg.  Well then, she stated, rising to her feet, let us do some research, and see just what these phoenix were supposed to wear!        9  Nicole gave one last look at the video screen.  The two negotiating parties were seated at the table.  The Cybian were to the left in their elegant caftans of turquoise, emerald, and amethyst.  To the right were the Patar, their skin rusty-brown and cracked, their sturdy forms covered by rough canvas in earth tones.  The two groups studiously avoided looking at each other.  Martin stood between the two parties, nervously running a hand through his blond curls.  Nicole turned from the screen to the men arrayed before her.  She had to admit, they looked stunning.  They were outfitted in dark silver leggings and a lighter tunic, with embroidery highlighting the width of their shoulders and the strength in their arms.  Avenging angels indeed.  She would trust each of these men by her side, no matter what dark alley she might head down.  She glanced down her own dress.  It was a mimic of the gold one she had worn the night of the attack, but done with silver embroidery.  It traced her curves and shimmered in the light.  Her hand went to the diamond at her chest, and she checked by habit that each man before her wore his.  Jon followed her eyes with his, looking down at the one they had created for him.  Warmth eased through her, to see him alongside the other men.  It was happening.  He was fitting in; over time his memories would return.  She just had to give it time.  She dropped her hand to her hip, reassuring herself that her glasblade was securely there, that the pistol was alongside.  The men did the same, bringing their eyes back up to join hers.  Remember, our aim is perfect silence, she instructed them.  Drawing to fire is only a last resort.  She put her hand into the center, and the men each added their own to the mix.  To honor, she murmured.  The words echoed around her, and together they moved into the teleporter room.  She closed her eyes to issue a silent prayer, and then she gave the command.  They materialized behind the negotiating table, looking out over the crowd.  A long, drawn out gasp greeted them, and a woman cried out, staggering back against the wall.  The delegates turned at the sound.  Their eyes went wide.  As one, the team turned to look at the Cybian contingent.  Nicole was careful not to focus on any one person, but to keep her gaze general, looking over their heads.  The men were open-mouthed in terror, and she waited for a long moment, knowing how completely she was relying on the men at her side.  Whoever the traitorous delegate was, he easily could have had a backup plan in place should she somehow appear at the negotiation table despite all his efforts.  An assassin could be in the crowd at this very moment, his finger slowly squeezing the trigger.  Her gaze steady, she brought her hand up from her side, drawing it straight-armed toward the cowering group.  No! Stop! It was a quivering, elderly man in vibrant amethyst, wisps of grey hair matted down on his slick, grey skin.  He plunged to his knees before the group, tremors racking his body.  I admit it! I only meant to stall you long enough to end this farce.  There is no way any solution with the Patar could possibly work! They are liars and thieves! But not my sweet grandchildren.  Not the innocent darlings.  Please take me instead.  Take me, and leave them in peace.  Richard nodded to the police who waited by the door.  They moved forward at once, pulling the man to his feet and hustling him out of sight.  Nicole offered a warm smile to the remaining Cybians.  And I assume none of you were involved in his machinations? A furious set of head-shakings came back at her.  He was always the lone vote against, insisted one of the younger delegates.  We had him on the committee to assuage the older generation, but he has been nothing but trouble.  Still, we had no idea he would go this far.  Another stared at her with round eyes.  So are you all right, then? She nodded, stepping forward to take her seat in the center of the room.  I am glad to report that I am quite fine, thanks to my guardian angels.  She smiled at the men, and they spread out into the room, taking locations around the perimeter.  She saw John move up to Captain Marcus; the older man gave him a warm hug in welcome.  She turned back to the two sides of delegates.  Both groups eagerly gazed at her with relief and anticipation.  Well, then, let find the path to this peace.  She turned first to the Cybians.  Let me first recap your position, as I see it.  You need labor to work the mines on your planet.  With your own citizens living in the cities in the clouds, you have no desire to do the work yourself.  You are willing to pay a credit a day per worker for that effort.  You wish to have little other contact with those workers.  The delegates looked at each other for a moment, nodding, and then turned back to her.  That would seem to sum it up, agreed the man.  Nicole then turned to the group on her right.  Now to the Patar.  Your race has been acting as miners for hundreds of years.  You seek more.  You would like to build schools for your children and homes above ground.  The atmosphere on Cybia is poisonous for both races, which is why of course the Cybians live in their cloud cities.  You would like better wages, in order to grow your civilization.  You would like a say in your working conditions and on the selling rates.  The rust-skinned group held her with a steady gaze.  Yes, that is it exactly, stated the larger member of the group.  One of the Cybians frowned.  You see why this is impossible, he ground out.  They just will not be reasonable.  Nicole held up a hand.  What have I said? The Cybian looked down, running a hand along his emerald caftan.  Trust in the solution, he murmured.  She nodded in agreement, then looked up and gave a wave of her hand.  Two men by the doors pulled them open.  In a moment six individuals in full body suits walked in a line toward the table.  They were about four feet tall.  The bulbous glass spheres around their heads revealed bulging, luminescent eyes and a nearly flat nose.  Their skin was a rich ochre color.  Let me introduce you to the Avigne, she presented, waving a hand forward.  The Avigne have a troubling problem, and I think we can help them.  There were soft mutters from either side of the table, and she swept her eyes over both groups before continuing.  The Avigne are a mining race on a planet far outside our mapped universe.  That planet circles a red dwarf star.  Unfortunately for them, all signs show the star is in the process of going supernova.  They have perhaps three months before their entire planet  and their entire civilization  is burnt to a cinder.  What they need is a massive rescue effort and a new place to live.  The Cybian youth turned his lips down in frustration.  As if we did not have enough problems with miners, he pointed out.  Another reason this destruction of the planet Avigne is distressing, continued Nicole without concern, is that it currently holds about four billion credits worth of plutonium.  A shocked silence filled the hall, and suddenly she had the attention of every person present.  Nicoles smile grew wider.  Here is what the Avigne propose.  They will spend two billion credits on a full fleet of ships for the Patar.  This with the understanding that every one of those ships has, at its first mission, to get to Avigne as quickly as possible and load up on both Avigne and plutonium loads.  Once both return to Cybia, the Patar can then use the ships to relocate their workers to the neighboring planet of Cathos.  Cathos is not an easy planet to live on - but it does have a breathable atmosphere, a climate where food can be grown, and ample mining opportunities as well.  She looked at the Cybians.  The workers will agree to work for you for free for a full ten years.  This will give you the same, matching benefit, so that each race is compensated equally.  That will also help to compensate you for the likely slowdowns associated with transitioning the cultures and settling in.  Her eyes moved back to the six standing before her.  The rest of the plutonium, they will keep to adapt the caves and environment to meet their needs.  As it turns out, the hostile environment of Cybia is fairly close to what they need.  They will have to set up some processing stations and air filters, but the money will cover those issues.  She swept her eyes first along the Cybian contingent, then the Patar.  We have set up side conference rooms, if you wish to discuss these new terms in private.  The Cybian groups eyes were glowing with joy.  After a quick huddle they eagerly nodded their heads.  Absolutely we agree, they stated in delight.  This is perfect! She turned her head, and the Patar were also grinning.  We could not have dreamed such a solution existed, admitted the burly one.  We whole-heartedly agree.  His eyes shadowed.  But where can we get ships so quickly? Nicole gave another wave, and a tall, elegantly dressed man with silver hair approached the table, carrying a mahogany box in both hands.  He laid it down on the table before Nicole.  Carefully opening the lid, he revealed several rows of neatly arranged keys.  His voice was deeply resonant.  On behalf of Scimitar Spaceships, let me offer my gratitude for being a part of these proceedings.  He motioned to the box before him.  These keys are symbolic, of course, but eighty spaceships are at this moment coming into orbit around the planet.  He turned to bow to the Avigne.  Your rescue fleet is ready, gentlemen.  The Avigness eyes grew, if possible, even larger, and in a moment they were enthusiastically clasping each other, crying out in relief.  Mary brought out a document which had a few paragraphs of text on it.  What this document holds is exactly what I stated.  We will keep this simple and sweet.  If you agree to these terms, come forth and sign your name.  A clamoring ensued with each delegate enthusiastically moving forward to add his name to the pact.  Finally the six Avignes made their mark.  Mary held the paper up to the crowd, and cheers rang out for long minutes.  At last she turned to the Patars.  I know this is a time for celebration, but we are also racing against the clock.  I understand completely, agreed the leader.  He moved around the table to the group of Avignes.  Come, let us get our plans in motion.  In a moment the Avignes and Patars had strode from the room side by side.  The Cybians faces were glowing.  Free workers! Happy workers! crowed one man to another.  Who could have thought it possible! They all bowed to Nicole, and then they were shimmering their way back to what she imagined would be an enormous, long-drawn-out celebration.  Martin moved up to her side, shaking his head.  I do not know how you do it, Nicole, he stated, his eyes wide.  I do not know what to say.  Nicoles mouth tweaked into a grin.  How about, let the celebration begin? He chuckled at that, waved his hands, and thousands of balloons cascaded down from the ceiling as the lively music filled the room.         10  Jon barely noticed as the cascade of turquoise and brown balloons flowed around him, rebounding cheerfully off of food-laden tables, empty chairs, and cheering observers.  The hollowness in his heart made him unable to hear the applause, to take in more than a general sense of movement.  It was over.  She was leaving.  The thoughts circled his mind, baffling him, refusing to settle down into any logical sense.  How could it have happened so quickly? One moment he was pinning the diamond on his breast, was standing shoulder to shoulder with the other men, was so close to Nicole that he could breathe in her intoxicating scent.  A heartbeat later she was shaking hands with Xerxes, was accepting a congratulatory embrace from Martin, and all too soon she would be shimmering out of sight.  Her ship, and the men in it, would retreat to the distant reaches of the galaxy, and she would be gone.  It was almost too much to fathom.  She made a spiraling motion with her hand, and Jons feet were in motion before he realized it, pushing his way through the crowd to her side.  As he approached he saw Richard on his right, Stephen on his left, and the other two quickly arrived as well.  Her gaze was apologetic as it came around to meet his.  I am sorry, Jon, but I need to talk with the others alone for a moment.  Jons cheeks flushed with heat.  Of course, he bit out.  He was not one of them.  He was not sure why he thought her call even included him.  He stood still as she turned and moved the men into a side conference room, one with the word Cybian still embossed in amethyst letters on the door.  And then that door closed solidly shut.  He stood staring at the door, oblivious to the swirl of music and celebration around him.  A green-suited waiter was at his shoulder, offering a flute of Champagne, and he absently shook the man away.  Were they planning how far to sail away this time? Would it be a year before they came back toward the core? At long last the door opened, but only Sean slipped out, moving through the throngs to stand at Marcuss side.  A whispered comment in his ear and Marcus was nodding, accompanying Sean back to the conference room.  The door sealed behind them.  Jon shook his head, desolation soaking into every bone, but he could not turn, not move away to sink into meaningless conversation with the laughing, joking people on every side.  If all he could do is be this close to them for these final few minutes, then he would do it.  He knew that in the mere beat of a heart it would all be over.  Long moments passed while his darkness swirled and thickened.  Then the door pressed open and Marcus was standing in the entryway.  He scanned the crowd, spotted Jon, and waved him in.  Jon nodded in acceptance.  They would be making their farewells now.  A few words, some handshakes, perhaps a brief, formal embrace, and then only empty space would remain.  He stepped through the door into the room.  An ivory marble table had been pushed to one side.  Seven plush chairs in a rainbow of colors lined the opposite wall.  Nicole stood in the center of the room, the four men behind her, all still decked out in their silver phoenix outfits.  The screw through Jons heart turned even more harshly.  Her honor, her strength, called to him with a power almost beyond his comprehension.  The men behind her would be more than brothers; they would be comrades in arms, men he could rely on with his life.  Nicoles brow creased as he came to a stop before her.  She started to say something, gave a slight shake of her head, and then asked in a low voice, Is everything all right? He steadied his face to be even.  I am fine.  The look in her eyes said that she did not believe it, and she glanced at Marcus for a moment before speaking.  This might seem an odd question but  what do you think of our group? What did he think of them? The pain of the imminent loss, the gaping hole, nearly threatened to pull him in.  He looked down at the diamond badge on her breast.  It was all he could do to grind out, You apparently are an immensely effective negotiator.  Far too efficient.  She blinked, and a flicker of nervousness shimmered behind her eyes before she pursed her lips.  Thank you, she returned, her gaze carefully drawing over him.  I was thinking more in terms of  She hesitated, and his eyes automatically went up to hers.  A wave of longing hit him, so powerful that it nearly buckled his knees.  Her mouth opened in surprise, and a sigh escaped from her lips.  He could almost feel its warmth wash over him, and it was all he could do to remain in place, to not take the short step that would close the distance between them, to take her in his arms and never let her go.  Her words came out in a rush, as if some inner barrier had been overrun.  We want to attach ourselves to your ship.  We want to become liaised with your crew, for a month, and then we can see  The words, their meaning, and the mixture of desire and hesitancy in her eyes all hit him with the force of a deluging waterfall.  His voice came out of him as a low groan.  Oh, Nicole  Richards voice came from one side, holding a lilt of amusement.  I take it that is a yes? Gods, yes, yes, murmured Jon, staring down into the green eyes before him.  He could become lost in those eyes, become completely submerged and he would never wish to surface.  The door pulled open, a cacophony of noise came with it, and Zaggat stormed into the room, his small eyes gleaming with frustration.  Nicole stepped away from Jon, turning to face the man, her movements sharp with annoyance.  Zaggats face twisted.  Nicole, there you are, he snapped, pulling up before her.  It took me long enough to find you.  Enough of this lolly-gagging.  We need to get going.  Going where? asked Nicole.  Jon could hear the effort it took for her to keep a civil tone.  Zaggat waved a hand towards the sky.  To Sygma Eight, of course! The trade negotiation between the Xyler corporation and the Capotans is of critical importance.  We must leave immediately.  She gave a shake of her head.  I know all about that negotiation.  It is a minor but tedious issue that needs months to untangle.  It can easily be handled by a junior team.  Zaggat took a step toward her, and Jon restrained his urge to move with him.  Around him he could see the other team members come to alert, their shoulders tensing, their hands flexing.  Zaggats finger raised to point in her face.  I swore to the Xylers that you would be there to protect their interests, he growled.  You will be there in three days if I have to hog-tie you and drag you there in chains.  Nicoles face went still, and Jon wondered that Zaggat remained so close to her, that he did not see the clear warning signs of the danger he was in.  Her voice, when it came, was deceptively cool.  That may be how you treat Xylers wife, when you seduce her in that grimy love-nest you take her to, but you will never lay one hand on me.  Zaggats face flared crimson, and his hands balled into fists.  You will not speak of Agatha, he growled.  Her husband is a jealous man; I will not have you recklessly endanger her.  Nicole shook her head, staring at Zaggat with more attention.  Surely you realize that the woman is putting on an act, in order to get you to support her husbands cause, she stated, half in surprise.  Her husband knows all about your liaisons and if anything is frustrated that she has not gotten you to act more quickly.  The only reason she has spread her legs  Jons world staggered into slow motion.  Zaggats hand raised, then swung with all the force of his bodys weight behind it toward her head.  Nicole began her dodge with the lightning-fast reflexes he had seen in action at the bar.  And yet, inconceivably, she stopped, held still, and Zaggats half-closed fist connected solidly with the side of her skull.  She went down hard to the floor.  The world spun up into motion.  Jon slammed Zaggats right hand into the far wall in perfect time with Richard pounding the left in place.  Stephens gun was out, and the gleam in his eyes indicated he was strongly tempted to use it.  Sean dropped to Nicoles side, his hand carefully cradling her head, looking attentively into each eye.  Are you all right? She carefully nodded, but it was a long moment before she put her hand up to his arm and allowed him to help her to her feet.  She moved to stand before Zaggat, a hint of a smile tweaking the corner of her mouth.  You do know you just assaulted a superior officer, she calmly informed him.  In quick succession Zaggats face moved between pride, confusion, and nervousness.  But you are a captain, as am I, he finally stuttered out in a defensive tone.  Nicole raised her left hand to her shoulder, sweeping her hair up and away from her collar.  Jon could see now that the three dots of captain were actually the four dots of an Admiral position.  Zaggats eyes widened with fear for a moment, then he swallowed and dragged a look of satisfaction back onto his face.  So I will be punished for a short while, he stated with pride.  I would gladly do that for my Agatha.  I will talk with my father, and he will force the committee to send you.  Especially now that youve lured me into this damaging action.  Nicoles smile grew wider, and her hand moved down to the insignia pin.  With a twist it was off in her hand.  She dropped it down onto the polished surface of the ivory table.  One by one Sean, Ian, and Stephen followed suit.  Richard took one last look at Jon, then released Zaggats arm, stepping away from him to move to Nicoles side.  His pin followed the others.  Zaggats voice rose to shrill heights.  You cannot do this! How will you leave? The scout ship is Collective property! The door slid open, and Xerxes stepped into the room.  He looked around first with interest, then with growing seriousness as he sensed the emotion of the room.  Nicole nodded at the man Jon still pinned to the wall.  I am sure Xerxes can explain everything to you, Zaggat.  The ship is mine.  And now, my time is my own as well.  I wish you the best of luck.  She turned then to Jon.  Her gaze held regret, satisfaction, and something more he could not quite pin down.  Then there was a shimmering, a fading, and they were gone.  Jon was left in the empty room, his heart echoing hollow, and his sense of loss was complete.

3,0,"  New Seattle Spaceport, Earth II  Kiri te Nala eyed the holovid marquee across the concourse.  Her insides knotted with nerves.  Starfall, which meant the display changed from Quasi-ball to the big event, StarLotto.  The game that was going to solve all her problemsshe hoped.   Intent on the brilliant turquoise levitating ball, she didnt notice her customer until he spoke.   Buy a Lotto marker? His deep, smooth voice was traced with amusement.   With an effort, Kiri focused on the man standing at her counter.  It was polished to a gleaming blackno thanks to the Lower Aquarian who had trailed slime all over it earlier in the evening and left a stench.  Shed broken out the big sprayer she kept for emergencies like Bartian visits.   This man was as smooth as her counter, in the metaphoric sense.  He certainly wouldnt slime anything he touched.  She had to look up to meet his gaze and his broad shoulders blocked a chunk of her view.  Unlike many residents of Earth II, his skin was clear and healthy, his gaze direct under his heavy, arching brows.   For a few secs Kiri gazed back, his words a pleasant echo in her mind.  Wow.  His eyes were the dark gray of the heavy clouds that always hung over the Sound.  Only when they narrowed slightly in speculation was she jerked from her reverie.   What? She straightened, her face heating.  Smooth, Kiri, very smooth.  Gonna drool and slime him like the Lo-Aq? For one crazy instant she visualized herself offering to spray him like her counter.   Yeah, I have a marker, she said, finally remembering his question.  Her voice, always husky, cracked with embarrassment.   Then a flash of turquoise over his shoulder caught her eye.  She held up one finger, her gaze riveted on the display over the gambling kiosk, heart pounding hard, as if it was trying to climb out of her throat.   Excuse me one sec.  You think about which coffee youd like.  Got some new Pangaean dark in today.  My flavors are all organic, no synthetics.   He ignored her suggestion, turning to watch with her as numerals began to pop out in long, glittering rows on the ballEarth numbers around the center, Galactic numerals just below, and the symbols of other planets arrayed above and below.  Some of them looked like irregular blobs.   Kiri took a breath and exhaled.  This was itthe day shed planned for.   One, she counted under her breath.  Without looking, she pulled her comlink from the pocket of her trim black smock and flicked it on.  The unit sputtered and she smacked it with the heel of her hand.  Seven.   She glanced up and back, checking the numbers against her marker, displayed electronically on the tiny screen of her comlink.  Although after spending the last three days figuring the probabilities, she knew them by heart.  Theyd danced through her dreams, luring her from sleep.   Sleep she needed after a week of rioting near the docks, accompanied by the faraway thump of flashbombs and tube rockets.  Night after night she woke in a cold sweat, wondering if that last explosion had been nearer to her tiny apartment.   Shed awakened in a sweat this morning, too, but from excitement this time.  If her plan worked, shed be able to afford a new apartment.  Not much larger, but if she could sleep safely and shower-dry in a clean tube, she wouldnt mind.  She was tough, but not too tough to appreciate that.   Three  nine.  Four, come on, four.  Yes! Just one more   The concourse rumbled as a big transport took off overhead.  Kiri ignored it, her comlink shaking in her hand, damp with nerves.  She rose up on her toes, gazing raptly at the holoscreen.   The final number gleamed.  Kiri blinked, unable at first to believe what she saw.  Eleven? She looked again.  No, it cant be.   It should have been a ten shining at the end of the row.  Around her, time stilled.  Her customer moved, folding his arms across his chest and leaning back against her counter.  The coffee machine sputtered as boiling water steamed in the well.  A Serpentian female glided past on the concourse, her red-gold snakeskin suit glimmering in the lights.  Travelers passed the other way chattering in Galactic, ciphers moving through their own world.   As their ranks parted, movement across the concourse caught Kiris eye.  The small, crouching figure of a Vulpean lurked behind the counter of the gambling kiosk.  His mouth opened in a sly grin, sharp teeth gleaming as he watched her.  As their gazes met, his beady eyes widened and he ducked behind the rack of cheap fabricated snacks on his counter.   You fanged pile of stinking skrog manure, she said through her teeth.  You cheated me!  She threw back the end of her counter and bolted through the opening.  Dashing across the concourse, she dodged a family of Barillians, leaping over their large luggage hovie-cart.  One of the adults trumpeted an indignant protest through the lavender pipes protruding from his head.   You cheated! she shouted at the cowering Vulpean.  Come out here, you little rat! Ill rip my credit out of your mangy hide.  You cant do this to me!  The Vulpean leapt aside with an agility that belied his rotund frame.  Just as Kiri reached the opening of the bay that held his kiosk, a network of glaring electrical charges hissed to lifea powerful security grid, capable of repelling even a huge Argonautian.   Kiri would have slammed straight into it, but a powerful arm clamped around her waist, yanking her back.  She found herself hanging off the floor, held against a hard body.  Electricity from the grid inches away crackled in her short hair and prickled the bare skin of her face and hands.   Her rescuer had saved her from injury, even disfigurement.  And not all the heat was coming from the grid.  She hadnt been held by anyone for months, and by a man this strong? Maybe never.   Not that she had time for that now.  Squinting through the hissing glare of the grid, she could just make out the Vulpean hiding in the shadows.   Let me go.  She kicked and twisted against her captors grip, beguiling as it was.  Ill kill the cheater.  Shed figure out some way to get to him.   Quiet.  He was already bearing her back across the concourse.  Youve attracted enough attention.  The port authority will be here in a few secs.   He was right.  The Barillian family had stopped to watch, their young wide-eyed.  Other travelers were slowing as well.  Humans, Serpentians and even a few Mauritians spilled out of the bar next door, grinning avidly at the disturbance.  Kiri glared back, daring anyone to ridicule her.   Give em trouble, girlie, one of the women called in a whiskey-soaked voice.   Ill help you, a Mauritian added, waving his heavy ale mug.  Well all help you.  The bar crowd laughed raucously.   That gambling stand is crooked, she protested.  The Vulpean will be arrested soonyou just watch and see.   One of the Barillians trilled in disgust.  The family trooped away.  A stocky man who looked like an off-duty Space Forces officer shook his head, grinning at her and her captor, but several of the bars denizens moved further out onto the concourse, muttering amongst themselves.   Quiet, you little fool.  Her rescuers arm tightened around her waist.  Do you want to start a riot? The city is on edge, and those drunks are ready for trouble.   He set Kiri down before her coffee stand and pushed her through the opening in the counter.  The end slammed down, the stranger crowding inside with her.  Kiri turned on him, taking care to stay clear of the steaming coffee machine.   But he cheated me! The port authority had better arrive, or Im calling them myself.   Why, because the random assortment of numbers you expected didnt come up? Let me guess, youve been watching it all week, and you had it all figured outcouldnt lose.   But I  I did have it figured.  Ive been watching it for more than a weekfor fourteen turns.   And he was watching you.  What in seven hells were you thinking, gambling there? Humans cant trust a Vulpean, you should know that.  They consider us easy marks.  He didnt add for obvious reasons, but then he didnt need to.   Kiri lifted her hands to her face, battling the urge to sink to the floor and weep.  Shed gambled money she didnt even have.   She was so quarked.   Ive been where you are, he added more gently.  And I know youre fighting mad, but violence wont help, just sink you deeper.   Yeah, he might have been this desperate once, but he clearly wasnt now.  She wasnt even sure she had enough credit to buy next weeks supply of coffee, unless she went without protein tubes, or sold herself along with her coffee.  She got plenty of those kinds of offers too.   Even going to Tal Darkrunner would be better than that.  At least he wouldnt expect her to share her body with other men.  He was the jealous type.   She had other friends, but none with credit to spare except Illyria, also her coffee broker, and Illyrias father watched every credit with a mean eye.  Her narrow array of options set panic beating inside her chest like the wings of something too large that wanted to devour her from the inside.   And she still had her uninvited guest to deal with.   She lowered her hands far enough to look up at the male crowding her coffee stand.  Sure enough, he was still watching her, and it wasnt with the abstracted kindness of a good-doer.  His gaze held enough latent heat to run that security grid.  Maybe hed help her.  And if he wanted something for it, well, he was certainly the most attractive man shed seen in a long time.   She tried a smile.  A poor effort, given the winged thing inside her, now hissing with a voice darker than the constant fog outside the space port.  It fed on her twinge of shame at even considering hitting up a stranger for money.   Thanks.  I guess you kept me from getting fried.  But you must have things to do, so   When his eyes crinkled slightly with amusement, her panic veered in a new direction.   Wait.  Youre not some uppity-up in the space port authority, are you? I wasnt really going to kill the Vulpean.  Well, she was, but not publicly.  Shed wait until the little sleazebag ventured out into the dark alley behind this section of port, and then shed   She didnt know what shed do.  Shed like to claw her credit out of the gambler, and she knew a few tricks from her years of living in the area near the port, but Vulpeans had claws too, and fangs.  She could always pour scalding coffee on him.  Teach him to mess with a barista.   Do I look like a helmet to you?  She let her gaze drift down over him again.  For the first time she noticed the charcoal gray business suit tailored to his lean, powerful frame.  Um, no.  You dont.  So who are you?  He smiled, creases grooving his taut cheeks.  He had a beautiful mouth, with thin, sensitive lips that belied the ruthless set of his jaw.  His teeth gleamed white and straight.  The twinkle in his eyes sent a curl of heat straight inside her.  Amazing, considering her turmoil.  This guy was truly a powerful force.   Why was he here, anyway? The wealthy didnt stop to buy her coffee.  In this old, shabby area of the space port, her stand was frequented by travelers and pilots on the small, discount flights and those of questionable legality.  So even if she had the credit for a flashy display like the big MoonPenny chain that had a choke-hold on the port coffee market, she still wouldnt get customers like this one.   Im the man whos going to take you to dinner.  Close down your machines, and lets go.   Dinner? She started to shake her head.  But her stomach growled, reminding her it was as hollow as an empty coffee mug.  Had she eaten anything but the soy in her latte that morning?  Besides, that smile of his . . .  Her light-headedness wasnt all from hunger.  Undecided, she pushed away from the counter and pulled the lever that emptied the unused coffee into the recycler.  Only a liter left, not too bad.  She hated wasting coffee, even the cheap stuff she could afford, but she refused to reheat it and serve it againsmelled like burnt veg and tasted just as bad.   Why do you want to take me to dinner?  Maybe I need a barista.  He waited by the opening in her counter as she finished tidying the area, cleaned her hands on a moist wipe and tossed it away.   She grinned over her shoulder, charmed in spite of her turmoil.  No, you dont.  Excuse me, I need to close that.  I go out the back.   Not today.  My cruiser is waiting across the concourse.  Come.   A private cruiser? Who was this guy? She planted her feet, facing him.  Im not going anywhere with you until I know who you are.  Name and credentials, please.   He gave her an approving look.  Wise of you to ask.   She shrugged.  Slavers have been out.  And you dont look like one of those either, but  The slave runners had been getting bolder lately, with all the rioting over jobs going to off-worlders.  The cops were preoccupied with keeping the unemployed workers and the crooked unions from blowing up entire city blocks in their battles, and had little time or energy left for individual disappearances.   When a strange slider with no markings cruised slowly along her block, accompanied by suited-up outriders on aircycles for the third time in recent weeks, it had been the final impetus behind Kiris reckless gamble.  She had to get out of the port slums before she disappeared as well.  The slavers had already taken more than she could bear to lose.   This man didnt look like a slave runner, but appearances could be deceptive.  Not every criminal inked their skin and wore leather and outlandish tails of hair like Tal.   Instead of answering her, he sauntered out onto the concourse, beckoned to her to follow him.  When she did, he nodded toward a huge holovid screen hanging from the vaulted ceiling.  The ever-present fog swirled high above, carrying the dank smells of cruiser exhaust, dirty streets and the mildew that pervaded the city, summer or winter.   Kiri frowned up at the display.  A panoply of stars against the midnight of space swirled through a complicated pattern that became a gleaming white space cruise ship speeding toward a guiding star.  As the ship neared the star, words became visible.   Fly LodeStar, she read aloud.  Where the ride is as good as the destination.  Starry.  Like she had credit for a cruise.   The ship accelerated out of the hologram, and a group of beings in silver flight suits filled the screen.  With muscular builds and direct gazes, they looked like the Intergalactic Space Forces pilots who came through the space port, tough and cool.   In their center stood her rescuer, the only one wearing business attire.  And clearly the man in charge.   Kiri peered at the man waiting beside her.  As arrogant as he was patient, those smoky quartz eyes fixed on her.   Thats you, she blurted.  Youre   Logan Stark.  He bowed slightly.  And you are?  Kiri.  She looked at the hand he held out and wiped hers surreptitiously on her smock before holding it out.  Kiri te Nawa.  Quark, he had credentials all right, solid iridium.   His hand engulfed hers, warm and powerful.  Kiri, he repeated as if he were tasting it.  It suits you.   Her gaze locked with his.  Was the gleam in his eyes that of a predator? Had he saved her so he could devour her himself? His grip tightened and she rocked forward onto her toes.  Her knees trembled, the warmth of his hand arrowing deep inside her as if he was touching her far more intimately.   And although his gaze held hers instead of sliding down to catalogue her physical assets in the overt way of many males, she felt uneasily that he saw far more than she wanted him to.  The lonely, vulnerable woman inside the veneer, starved for the warmth of a tender touch, for the knowledge that she belonged to someone.   Oh, quark, that was ridiculous.  He was just a guy, a rich one.  He wanted what all guys wanted from her, a quick fuck and someone to listen to them.  And that was all she could hope for here, someone to make one night less empty and cold.  She sure wouldnt be keeping warm with happy thoughts of how shed invest her winnings.   But her dark humor was tinged with excitement, the kind she felt when she was about to leap.  Much as she reminded herself she needed both feet firmly on the ground, sometimes she reached for stars that were out of her grasp.  Sometimes it worked, like investing her savings into this stand, going indie.   Todays leap had been an epic fail.  Shed been flung into empty space with nothing to grab onto.  And she quarking hated this feeling.  Played hell with her usual confidence.   Here was an escape from her current freefall.  Later shed figure how to get her credit out of the Vulpean.  Because she would have itshe didnt care if what the little vermin had done was legal, no one cheated a te Nawa.   If it was only for herself, shed tough it out, but she had another star to grasp.  One which might be unreachable, but shed never give up trying.   Coming? Logan Stark asked.        2  All right.  Kiri closed up her own kiosks security grid, and with a last vengeful glare at the now quiet gambling stand, she followed Logan Stark onto one of the small platforms that lifted travelers up to the hoverways.  He escorted her onto the moving walkway and they zipped off above the concourse, across a rotunda and along a newer, brighter concourse.   Hanging onto one of the supports, Kiri studied her escort covertly.  He had presence, a kind of force field around him, a magnetism that allowed him to draw others to him, bend them to his will.   Even now that he wasnt holding onto her physically, she wanted to stay close.   Quark, maybe he was Indigon and doing some kind of mind control on her.  Nah, he didnt have freaky dark blue eyes, and he certainly didnt have their cold demeanor.  His eyes were more like a locked hatch on a molten core of energy.   He led her off the walkway onto one of the platforms, and it dropped them to the broad, gleaming concourse, near a large MoonPenny coffee stand with a line of well-dressed beings waiting to order.   Kiri followed Stark into a narrow private docking bay.  Beside an open hatch waited a man in a gray flight suit like the pilots on the LodeStar holovid.  Beyond, Kiri saw a female flight attendant in a trim, feminine version of the suit.  She stood in a short podway, one of those that docked smaller cruisers landing at the space port.   Logan Stark owned a space corporation and his own cruiser.  He was a wealthy, powerful man.  Maybe that meant he thought he could do anything he wanted, treat humans as disposable.   She stopped, just out of earshot of his two employees.  He stopped as well, turning back to look down at her.   Why do you want to have dinner with me? she asked.  He hadnt really answered her the first time she asked.   His hooded gaze gleamed, sparking an answering flame deep in her own core.   Because youre beautiful, and you interest me, he said, his deep voice wrapping around her like a velvet leash.  Anything else youd like to know before we board?  She swallowed, suddenly breathless.  This man, who could probably have any female he wanted, thought she was beautiful? He must like the tired, pale type.   Just one.  Youre not into anything twisty, are you?  His brows lifted.  Over dinner? No.   Kiris face burned.  Right.  He hadnt exactly invited her to do him in the back of his cruiser.   However, he went on in that same smooth voice.  Should we make the mutual decision for sex later  I suppose it depends on how you define twisty.   She stared up at him, that heat leaping across the short distance between them.  She truly was a gambler at heart, because instead of dousing her desire, his warning only enhanced it.  She had a sudden, searing image of him over her, commanding her to let him do very naughty, intimate things.  And of herself agreeing.   Oh, black holes and quarks.  She was in trouble enough without getting into some weird sex tangle.  There were clubs where wealthy people did all sorts of things.  Some of the girls whod been in trade school with her had gone into prostitution before they were even of age, saying they were going to find a rich being to keep them in style, not work at a trade until they were tired and broken.  Kiri had considered it for about five secs, until she thought of nameless and possibly repulsive beings touching her.   Logan Stark was the opposite of repulsive, but if he expected her to go along to one of those places, shed have to be ready to run.  Unless  she used the opportunity to get some credit out of him.  If he wanted a particular sex act badly enough, hed be willing to pay for it, wouldnt he?  Except thatno.  Seven hells, no.  If she prostituted herself, even with him, shed end up hollow as a modelbot, moving and posing with an artificial smile and empty eyes.  What was she willing to do to stop her fall? Not that.  The decision was a relief, as if a heavy choice she hadnt even known shed been carrying had slid off her shoulders.   He took her arm and gently but inexorably guided her across the bay.  Lets take it one step at a time, shall we?  He nodded to the pilot.  Giles.  Ms.  te Nawa will be joining me for dinner at Jasmine.   Very good, sir.  The pilot nodded respectfully to both of them.   The attendant, a slim woman with silver hair, smiled as they walked through the podway.   Good starfall, sir, maam.   Opal, this is Ms.  te Nawa.  Kiri, Opal will show you where you can freshen up before we take off.   Kiri followed the other woman through the cruiser, taking in the sheer, quiet luxury of the compact interior.  It was all done in soft grays and blues, the floor firm but soft under foot, with chairs that were so wide and deep she could curl up in one and stay for hours.   She stroked her fingers over a chair back as she passed.  Was that skrog leather? It was as soft as the inside of her wrist, at least the parts that werent scarred from scalding-hot coffee.  She couldnt afford gesics that grew new skin, just the cheap kind that doused the pain enough to keep working.   The lavatory gleamed with spotless cerametal and mirrors of faultless reflective material.  Opal showed her how to work the toilet and cleansing unit and indicated a discreet section of storage stocked with cosmetics and toiletries.   As soon as the attendant left, closing the hatch behind her, Kiri touched the mirror wonderingly.  Real glass, slick and cool under her fingers.  Oh, shed smudged it.  Hastily she pulled a cleansing cloth from the commode and wiped the slight mark of her fingertips from the glass.  She cringed at the thought of Logan Stark or his employees knowing she was such a slummer she never saw real glass.   She stared at herself in the mirrorthe familiar reflection of short, dark hair framing an oval face with winged ebony brows, eyes that were brown or amber depending on the color she wore, but which currently had dark shadows beneath them and a mouth that was too soft for her liking.  Males liked it, though.  She could get them to add extras to their coffee order if she was in the mood to pour on the sex appeal.  When she was out at the clubs, she could get pretty much any guy who took her fancy.   Logan Stark thought she was beautiful.  She lifted her hands to her face, tracing the curve of high cheekbones and stubborn jaw.  Of course he could have just been saying that to get her to have sex, but he found her attractive, or he wouldnt want to have sex.   Kiri shivered as she again imagined him touching her.  Oh, glory.  Would she have time for a shower-dry first? She sniffed her armpit and grimacedcoffee and sweat.  Not too bad, but still.   She ran her fingers through her hair, trying to comb the unruly waves into a semblance of order.  Shed done a crap job cutting it.  In the cubby of toiletries, she found some hair cream that smelled wonderful.  She dabbed and tucked until her hair was in some semblance of order.   She used the lavatory, wishing she could spend some time in the sleek shower-dry.  The tube in her tiny apartment emitted water either too cold or too hot and smelled funky even after she ran the cleaning cycle.   She washed her hands, grimacing at them too.  She needed a manicure.  Her nails were clean, but her hands were rough and chapped, with burns old and new marring her golden skin.   Well, it was honest labor that had made them so, nothing to be ashamed of.  This was just a moment out of time for her.  Shed have dinner with Logan Stark and maybe more, and then it would be back to her life in the dark, gritty streets of New Seattle.   For a moment, remembering the black hole her life had imploded into with the loss of all that credit, she wanted to huddle on the floor and whimper.  But she wouldnt let herself crumble.  Shed get through this somehow, just as she always did.  She had a few friends, and she had her coffee stand, and she had her own lodestar, the purpose that kept her going every day.   This dinner with him was just an aberration in her orbit.  Hopefully a safe one.         Logan Stark waited with keen anticipation for his guest to return to the main cabin of his cruiser.  Kiri Te Nawa might not be polished, perfumed and physically enhanced as the women he usually took, but she was beautiful as a wild doe.   No, a wild cat, he corrected himself, amused.  With those tilted eyes spitting golden fire, and her slender hands clawed to attack the sleazy gambler, she resembled the Tyger females hed met on the planet Bryght.  She must have Tygean blood in her ancestry.   Her husky voice added to the illusion.  Perhaps shed suffered damage to her larynx at some point, but he found the slight roughness in her voice, the way it cracked under emotion, unexpectedly alluring.   Her slim, taut body had felt very good in his arms, too.  She had a curvy ass below her small waist, and in her snug uniform, her breasts were high and round.  Not as large as he usually preferred, but then that was what made women so fascinatingtheir endless variety, the mystery of discovering what made each one of them unique.   This one had a spirit as wild as the cats she reminded him of, and she shone like a sleek purebred in a pack of alley-bred mongrels.   Hed found her by accident.  With time on his hands after a meeting with space port authorities, hed been walking.  Out of curiosity, hed ended up in the oldest section of the space port.  He passed loading bays for discount cruise lines and smaller private bays that he guessed shrewdly were used by those who preferred to avoid the brightness of the new concourses, their trade better conducted in the shadows.   There were families and business travelers just like on the new main concourses, but these folk were shabbier.  A few toughs cast him avaricious looks, as if wondering whether he could be dragged into a dark alcove and robbed.  Stark watched them decide against aggression and move on, realizing he was no easy mark despite his grooming.  Wise choice on their parts.   His brother Joran would say he was slumming.  Because hed been here before, many times.  Once this shabby area had seemed palatial to youths looking for a safe place to get in out of the cold rain and scavenge something to eat and drink.   And while hed never mugged innocent travelers as these toughs would, in the darkest times he and Joran had rolled a few druggers in the dark streets outside the port.  With bellies so empty they hurt, and Creed to feed as well, it had been one of the choices between survival and death.   Stark had shaken off the dark memories and was about to turn away when lights caught his eye.  The holomarquee of a coffee bar glowed cheerily ahead, contrasting with the garish bar sign across the way and the dark, barred-up space alongside.  That valiant little sign drew him.  As he neared the stand, he saw that it was clean and bright, with neat racks of snacks and souvenirs.   Then he saw the barista.  A slim, vibrant figure in her fitted black, she moved with the grace of a dancer as she scrubbed the small countertop of her stand.  He stopped for a moment, simply appreciating.   A bent old man stumped up to her window, and laid one gnarled hand on the counter.  He said something that made her smilea glowing smile, with a flash of white teeth and flirtatious sweep of dark lashes.  In one smooth motion she turned, grabbed a disposable cup and filled it from the coffee machine steaming at her side.  Then she handed the cup to him, holding on until he had a grip on it.   The old man nodded his thanks.  She watched him walk away, then returned to her scrubbing.  No credit had changed hands.  Stark stood for a sec and then decided he wanted one of those smiles and that hed gladly pay the price of a coffee for it.   He strolled over to stand at her counter, thinking hed solved the mystery of the stands success.  Hed certainly been turned from his dark mood.   But, just as hed reached her, the display over the gambling stand changed and the lovely barista had been riveted, hardly noticing him although he stood directly in front of her.  He was not accustomed to being ignored, especially by women.   Maybe it was the old memories of lurking in the port, unnoticed and unwanted, coupled with her kindness to the old man, another ragged castoff, which strengthened his resolve to have her.   And now here she was, aboard his cruiser.  But Stark frowned as he walked to his cruisers compact bar to pour himself a snifter of moonpear brandy.  Shed obviously bet a large sum on the StarLotto game, to be so devastated at her loss.  Was she nave or just reckless? And was this an aberration or a habit? If the latter, this would be their only encounter.  He had good reason, the best, to steer clear of habitual gamblers.   Hed have the story out of her.   As she emerged into the cruiser cabin, he turned, eyeing her with pleasure.  Yes, she was lovely, but more than that, the fire of hard-won independence in her amber gaze called to him, challenged him to ruffle her self-possession.  A kindred spirit in some ways, but packaged in complete femininity that he wanted to tame.   Hed seen a gleam of calculation when he invited her to come with him, but far from despising that, he understood, even admired her for it.  He hadnt gotten where he was without constantly reading the beings with whom he dealt and deciding how to best use them to his advantage.  She was a woman alone, working her business in a rough area of the port.   Hed had painful lessons along the way.  Perhaps he could save her a few of those.  Not that he had any emotional connection in mind.  That was the last thing he was looking for.   She smiled as she crossed the cabin to him.   What? he asked, handing her a snifter with a small amount of the brandy.   A twinkle of humor gleamed through the shadows in her eyes as she indicated their surroundings.  Stark reality isnt so bad, not in this case.   He chuckled.  You like brandy?  She sniffed it delicately and then took a careful sip.  Her eyes widened and she took another sip.  I like this.   He indicated the two nearest chairs, and she sat.  She had a catlike elegance he appreciated.  Hed like to see her in a finely made evening gown, with jewels against her golden skinperhaps Tygean topaz.  Yes, a high collar, with a ring dangling from it.  The ring would rest on her chest and hide the vulnerable hollow of her throat from any eyes but his.   Even her scent pleased himthe faint sweetness of a healthy female, overlaid with coffee and spices.   Opal brought them a plate of crisp crackers, each topped with a dab of white cheese, russet jelly and a sliver of green.   Thank you.  His guest took an hors doeuvre and slipped it into her mouth.   Opal nodded, and disappeared into the cockpit.   Stark watched with interest as Kiri chewed.  He was not disappointed.  She hummed with pleasure as she swallowed.  Mm-m, is that real cheese?  His fingers flexed on his brandy snifter.  He wanted to see that look again, hear that little moan while he was touching her.   She took another cracker.  Im starving.  Forgot to eat today.   Then youll appreciate dinner.  Jasmine serves only fresh foods, most of it flown in from Pangaea.   She wrinkled her straight nose.  Im not really dressed for dinner.  Maybe you should take me someplace  simpler.   He shook his head.  No one there will mind.   Because Im with you, she said wisely.  You dine there often?  When Im on planet.   Her gaze brightened over her snifter.  You travel? Tell me.  Wheres the best place youve gone?  He couldnt resist her interest.  Every planetor nearly every planethas its own appeal.  Serpentia has golden deserts and fascinating rock formations.  The sunrises and sunsets there are spectacular.  Pangaea is almost completely green and bluegardens, farms and water.  Bryght is a small planet, but the sky there seems to be full of moons; three male moons and two female.   Frontiera  he paused, thinking how to describe it.  She has three moons as well, but most of all, shes like Earth II must have been before pollution and overcrowding.  Vast stretches of open country, with only wild creatures and nomadic tribes.  The wetter regions have some settled peoples.   She took another cracker, leaning closer.  Are there no cities at all?  Some, but mostly small towns and huge areas with no settlements at all.  Like Earth, she has climatescold at the magnetic poles and hot at the equator.  There are seas, and we dont yet know what creatures dwell in their depths.   His guest shivered, sipping her brandy, her gaze faraway.  Which region do you like best?  The tropical areas are beautiful, as are the more temperate boreal forests.  Ive mining interests in the north.  The mountains are spectacular, snow-capped and wild.  There are skrog.  Have you ever seen one?  She laughed, a husky sound with a catch in it that ricocheted straight to his groin.  Skrog? Only in holovids.  Are they as ugly in reality?  Uglier.  And their cry can shatter your eardrums if youre too closea great bellow that ends in a shriek.   She winced, still laughing.  How horrible.  She smoothed her hand over the arm of her chair.  They do make lovely leather, though.   He watched her hand, sheer lust seizing him.  He wanted her hands on his skin.  Hed have that.  Hed have all of her.   Whats the worst place youve been? she asked.   Stark gazed into the clear, dark gold brandy he was swirling idly in his glass, the same hue as her eyes.   It dimmed, replaced with another image.  Slamming forward through the years, a dirty alley closed around him.  Cold, wet, stinking of garbage.  Nowhere to shelter himself, or the two smaller boys shivering beside him, waiting for him to find food and a safe, warm place to sleep, unless he found it, or wrested it from someone else.   Nowhere youd care to hear about.  And closer than she knew.  He turned to look out the porthole at the lights of the city emerging from the fog and rain below.  He was above it all now, secure in his lofty perch, but no matter how many years buffered him from the cold and hunger, hed never forget.  And hed do anything necessary to assure he and his were never down there again.   And now were arriving at our destination.  Finish your drink if you like.        3  From the grim shadow that passed over Starks face, Kiris question had ignited dark memories of some kind.  So he had them too.   He carried himself like a man who knew how to fight.  Maybe hed been in the Space Forces and in some terrible battle.  The Solar Wars werent all that long ago.  A warrior, maybe? No wonder she felt safe with him.   The ship hovered, turning if the lights spinning past outside were an indication.  Another craft zipped by, so close the wake caused Starks cruiser to wobble.  Kiri gripped the arms of her chair nervously.  Shed only flown on the clumsy airbuses that traversed the city and tightly woven suburbs.  They werent light enough to be bothered by passing vehicles, but landing was a jarring experience.   Tal had offered to take her on one of his cruisers, but she wasnt setting foot in any craft that might have been hijacked.  With her luck, the police would choose that moment to close in on him, and shed wind up restrained in the back of a police cruiser.   To her surprise, Starks large hand covered hers.  Giles will set us down without a bump.  In fact, Ill wager you wont be able to tell weve landed.   Ill believe that when it happens, she retorted, but his touch was certainly taking her mind off her fears.  He could probably convince her to jump out of the ship with him if he just held her hand in this warm, sure gripand she hated heights.   Really? He raised a brow at her.  Youre a gambling woman.  How about a small wager?  I dont bet.  Well, today was the only time and you saw how that turned out.   This isnt that kind of wager.  He leaned closer, his eyes on her mouth.   Kiris breath caught in her throat at the sensual threat implicit in his gaze.  What kind is it, then?  His gaze rose to meet her own, locking with hers like a tractor beam.  If we land without you noticing, you owe me a kiss.   Her hand trembled in his.  When had she turned it to clasp his? Satisfaction gleamed in his gaze.  She shrugged, hoping he didnt notice her telltale shiver or the heat that blossomed on her cheeks.   Okay.  Shed kissed plenty of guys, so why did the thought of kissing him make her feel as if she were about to take another huge gamble?  Mr.  Stark, weve landed, said Opal, appearing as if conjured in the open door of the cockpit.   Kiri blinked.  Had he sent the woman some kind of secret signal on his comlink? No, they really were down, the lights of a rooftop landing pad reflecting on wet pavement.   Thank you, Stark said.  He tugged on Kiris hand, and she was startled to realize he was still watching her, ignoring the other woman.   Feeling like a small craft being sucked into the magnetic field of a powerful star, Kiri let him pull her across the soft skrog leather to him.  Her gaze locked with his, she let her body take over, leaning forward and tipping up her face to his.  She knew his flight attendant was still there, but somehow that didnt matter anymore.   She felt the heat of his skin first, the soft puff of his breath across her lips.  That strange magnetism engulfed her, sweeping her in, so that when his lips touched hers it was almost a relief.  His lips were warm, firm, softer than shed expected.  He didnt mash his mouth on hers, or try to shove his tongue in her mouth, but he still managed to invest the caress with some mysterious urgency.  When he angled his head and pressed more firmly, demanding entrance, she parted her own lips and gave it to him.  Pleasure swept through her, and her secret places softened and swelled in a paean of need.   The kiss deepened as he tested the damp softness of her inner lips, then used his tongue to taste her, a leisurely sampling that ended with his tongue in her mouth, tangling with her own.  A soft moan of shock and excitement emerged from her throat.  But who cared when he was sucking gently on her tongue, enticing it into his own mouth as if she were the most delicious woman hed kissed in eons.   His hand tightened on hers, and she curled her fingers about his in response.   When he let her go, lifting his head, she dragged her eyes open.  She pulled her wet lower lip between her teeth and let it go, tasting him on her lips.  Oh, glory, if he could do that with just his mouth and one hand holding hers, what effect would he wreak with his whole body? And judging from the predacious light in his gray eyes, hed been just as affected.   Well have dinner, he told her.  Then perhaps youll kiss me again, hmm?  Perhaps.  Her cheeks heated as he smiled at her again.  He knew exactly how much that kiss had affected her.  And that she wanted more.         Jasmine was hushed, elegant and dimly lit.  A Pangaean female in a leaf-green cheongsam led them to a table in a quiet alcove, bowing politely as she gestured them to sit.  Kiri was relieved to see that she didnt look twice at Kiris clothing.  Of course with lighting like this, her black smock couldve been crafted of the finest lii leaves.   Stark seated Kiri in the plush, semi-circular booth and slid in after her.  She was both alarmed and delighted by his nearness.  He smelled so good, as if the essence of some dark, wild forest lingered on his skin.  Some kind of cologne, she supposed, but she wasnt sure the scent would be half so inviting on any other man.   Whatever, it certainly wasnt a scent the men she knew could afford.  In fact, none of them could afford to even set foot in this place.  They frequented the crowded eateries with rock music thumping, surrounded by rowdy beings like Mauritians and Tygers arguing, fighting and laughing.   The denizens of her apartment complex were the same, or they were older, beaten down by life and reduced to living in the slums.   To distract herself from the memory that she might be on the verge of losing even such doubtful shelter, she looked around at the tasteful arrangements of tall plants screening them partially from other diners.   A party of Serpentians filled the nearest booth.  Their skin and hair, ranging from golden to gold-green, gleamed even in the low light.  They were laughing together, their table crowned with a carafe of steaming fire whiskey and glasses.   The gentle babble of Pangaean came from behind her somewhere.  The place smelled clean, no mildew, no stale grease and body odor.  Just the tantalizing smells of good food.   This place must be popular with travelers, she said.  An inane remark, but conversation was good.   She focused on Stark, a mistake, because as soon as she looked at him, she found herself reliving their kiss.  She couldnt believe hed locked lips right in front of his employees.  Public kissing was usually for dark, noisy clubs when everyone was drinking or drugging.   Yes.  Will you let me order for you? he asked, as another Pangaean approached their table, this one in the male version of the cheongsam, with pants.   All right.  But nothing slippery.  Shed seen the things beings from other worlds consumed, and she wasnt eating anything that looked as if it should be wriggling in a swamp somewhere.  Shed rather eat vegeproteinat least it was safe.   The creases at the corners of his mouth deepened.  Ill remember that.   He consulted with the waiter, and in a few moments they were served drinks in round goblets with small blossoms floating near the rim.  Pear brandy blossoms, Stark said, handing her one of the glasses.   He lifted his glass to her.  Kiri followed suit, sipping cautiously.  The same brandy hed given her earlier, mixed with some kind of fruit juice, perhaps the pears from which it had been distilled.  Faintly sweet, the drink left the taste of brandy lingering on her tongue.  She nodded.  Its good, thank you.   He looked quietly satisfied.  So tell me how you came to be a barista at New Seattle space port, Kiri te Nawa.   She glanced at him and away.  Like he really wanted to know her sad story.  But she could play the social game.  She waited while their waiter set a graceful tray on the table, full of delicate sprays of green leaves, a swirl of creamy filling centered on each one, topped with a single berry.  She picked one up carefully and slipped it into her mouth, chewing with relish.  Hmm, delicious, whatever it was.  Creamy, smooth and tart.  She chose another.   I didnt start out to sell coffee, she told him.  But after I left trade school, I got a job at a one of the big MoonPenny stands.  Then I realized I was spending all my credit just getting by.  I wanted something of my own, where I could keep the profits and invest them back in my business.  So I worked second jobs here and there, and saved until I had enough to lease my space.   Then shed had the encounter that changed her life and started her funneling credit to a far more serious pursuither search for what the slavers had stolen.  But she was hardly confiding in him about that on first acquaintance.   Kiris Kaffe, he said.   She grinned.  She never lost the thrill of pleasure at hearing her kiosks name.  An ancient people here on Earth II spelled coffee that way.  Its stardusty, I know, but everyone remembers it.   I think its the owner they remember.   Kiri picked up her drink.  Quark, but that look made her self-conscious, and hyper-aware of him as a manan extremely virile one.   Some of them, I guess.  Got that bar right across the concourse.  Guys sit in there and drink, start thinking theyre the galaxys gift to womankind.  She grinned at him over her glass.  I usually talk them into buying an after-drinks coffee and send them on their way.   Stark chuckled.  So you dont generally date your customers?  Not often, she said.  Kinda awkward for repeat business.   With free vaccinations for STIs and for pregnancy, hooking up with relative strangers was safeunless one picked a creeper.  But even when dates culminated in sex, none of those men had ever had this effect on her.   His face creased in that attractive smile, but he sobered quickly.  Wise.  There are some very ugly menand womenout there hiding behind attractive facades.   Thats for sure, she muttered.  Im pretty good at reading people.  If a guy gives off any creeper vibes, doesnt matter how golden he is, I tell him Im with someoneor that I prefer other girls.   She laughed at the look he gave her.  Yeah, that one never works.  Men cant believe a woman could possibly prefer a lover withoutum, certain equipment unless they see the evidence for themselves.   Stark raised his brows in silent inquiry and her cheeks heated.  She took another hasty drink, avoiding his gleaming gaze.  No.  Havent and dont.   There are those who enjoy both.  He calmly picked up another hors doeuvre, the green leaf delicate against his large, muscular hand.  Wow.  Did he mean he sometimes?  So, umyour skin is tanned, she blurted.  You spend time in the sunlight somewhere? Must be on another planet.  Not safe to spend too much time outdoors here on Earth II.  Of course in New Seattle the heavy clouds shut out the sun anyway.   He glanced at his hands, accepting her change of subject.  This would be the remnant of my last visit to Frontiera, he answered.  In general I visit the medical booths.   She nodded.  Anyone with credit could receive regular metered dose of faux sunlight to stimulate vitamin production.  She wore a vitamin patch, herself.  Not as expensive as the booths.  Just slap it on the midriff somewhere and leave it until it fell off, the vitamins having been absorbed by the body.  Real sunlight would sure be nice though.   Your people must be proud of you, he said, changing the subject yet again.  A business of your own.   Dont have any people.  She took another drink, swallowing the chill of things she didnt think about.   Ah.  He nodded as if her admission explained something.  Your stand is in a tough area of the space port.   What I can afford.  Rent there is stiff enough.  Astronomical in the new area.  MoonPenny can afford that.  I cant.  Especially now.  Panic beat at her, and she drained her glass, drowning it momentarily.   But youve plans to expand? he asked.  His calm reached out to her in a soothing wave.  The man could hire out as a psych therapist, the way he controlled the mood around him.   She set her glass down.  Eventually.  Im good with numbers.  I watch the markets, buy my beans at discount.  Took over the stand cheaply too.  You should have seen the mess it was in.  I cleaned it, fixed it up, called in a few favors from friends.   He nodded.  Your hard work shows.  Youve made it stand out in the surroundings.  I do wonder how you make a profit, however, when you give away your product.   She stared at him and he shrugged.  I watched you hand out coffee to two passersby in several moments.  Kind, but not good business.   Not like they have the credit to buy anyway.  Just flotsam and jetsam of the port, with no one to care.  Least I can do is give them a hot cup of java once in a while.   He picked up another leaf, but instead of eating it, he held it out to her, a new warmth in his gaze.  I see.  Here, have another.  Our dinner is on the way.   She opened her mouth to let him slip the treat between her lips.  She chewed and swallowed.  You look like you just closed a great business deal.   I never feed my business partners.  Not with his own hand, anyway.  The unspoken words hung between them, reminding Kiri that he was no uncomplicated man with partying on his mind.   Her dinner was set before her.  Breast of Pangaean pheasant, the waiter murmured.  Sauced with a light balayti cream.  Pureed root vegetables, crisp yam and moonberry compote.   It looked delicious and smelled heavenly.  Starks plate held the same selection.   Well have a light wine, he told the waiter.  Not too sweet.   Kiri spread her napkin in her lap, her eyes on the food.  She was going to eat every bite, slowly, so shed never forget this meal.  The waiter set a basket of rolls and a small bottle of oil on the table.  Stark broke a roll for her and trickled oil over it.  Her mouth full of succulent pheasant, Kiri nodded her thanks.   The food was as delicious as it looked, the flavors and textures blending perfectly.  Kiri hadnt eaten real meat or fowl for longer than she cared to recall, so she was glad the sauce wasnt too rich, hiding the flavor.  The bread was tender and flaky, the oil a tangy enhancement.   Not until shed worked her way through most of the food on her plate did Kiri surface from her haze of pleasure to realize that she hadnt spoken to her host for several moments.  She picked up her wine glass and took a sip, looking at him.  He was doing quiet justice to his own meal and didnt seem to notice her preoccupation.   The wine burst on her tongue, mellow and faintly sweet, perfectly complementing the food, with echoes of flavor that filled her minds eye with a sunny vineyard like those shed seen on holovids.  She gave a hmm of pleasure.   Good? he asked, taking a drink as well.   Wonderful, thank you.  She picked up her fork, determined not to leave a bite.   Stark poured her more wine and went back to his meal.  Finished, Kiri sat back with a sigh that was nearly a groan.   Dessert? Stark asked, wiping his mouth with his napkin.   Kiri shook her head regretfully.  No, thank you.  I couldnt eat another bite.  But you go ahead.   He shook his head.  I dont often eat sweets.   Really? How about your coffee? Ill bet you drink it dark.   Stark nodded.   I never did serve you a coffee, she remembered.  Stop by tomorrow and Ill make you one, on the house.   He didnt move, but his gaze touched her as surely as if hed reached out his hand to take hers.  Why dont you make me a cup at my penthouse in the morning?  Excitement and fear fizzed through her veins.   This was it, the moment of decision.  Did she shake her head and thank him for the meal, or did she leap again? God knew she wanted to.  Now that her belly was full, her body and mind relaxed with brandy and wine and plush surroundings, he was still the most attractive man shed ever met.  And after that kiss, she wanted more.  A lot more.   Hot and dark? she asked daringly, holding his gaze.   Just the way I like it.        4  Starks passenger amused him again by falling asleep as they approached the New Seattle Docks.  With her lashes lying on her cheeks in a dark fan, she looked more vulnerable, younger.  She was really outa rich meal, brandy and wine on top of what had evidently been a sleepless night.   Hed enjoyed watching her eat with such single-minded attentionreminded him of Creed and Joran when they were boys.  Any meal was a chance to fill up, especially when they never knew when the next one would arrive.  Kiri clearly wasnt accustomed to fine meals, although she had the perfect table manners that suggested shed been raised well.   He wondered why some man hadnt already snatched her up, as a mistress or even a bride.  She was a beauty, and a sensual creature if her pleasure in food and in their kiss was any indication.  And not above a casual hookup.   He had an idea that she would consume sexual pleasure with even more gusto than she had the food hed given her.  If shed been that lost in a simple kiss, what would her response be to his hands and mouth on her, his cock inside her? Would she remain as quiet and dainty as a cat, or go wild, screaming her pleasure to the night?  The desire that had simmered all evening arrowed straight to his groin, his cock twitching pleasurably.   Opal, he said quietly.  Bring me the medic kit.   Yes, sir.  Without question, she brought the small kit from a storage unit and watched without comment as he took out a palm-sized unit.  He opened it, revealing a tiny, sharp needle on one end.   Sir? Are you going to wake her? she murmured.   Stark lifted his brows at her and she sighed in resignation.  Would you like me to apply it, sir?  He nodded.  Shed have a lighter touch than he.  Just the standard infectious diseases and STIs.   She bent over the woman sleeping between them, one hand lying lax in her lap.  Carefully, Opal touched the needle to the inside of Kiris wrist.  Logan gave her a look of query and Opal nodded.  Shed gotten the sample.   Kiri started awake with the suddenness of a wild thing.  She clutched her wrist with her other hand, her eyes still dazed with sleep.   What? she demanded.  What did you give me?  She catapulted out of her seat, shoving Opal aside.  What is that? Some kind of drug?  Backing against the bulkhead, she glared from Logan to his employee.  The woman straightened from the chair shed fallen against, looking at Stark for direction, or maybe that was I told you so in her gaze.  He shook his head at both of them.   Its not a drug, he said.  Look at it.  Its a common blood test.   Opal held the sampler out to her.  Kiri took her eyes off of him long enough to peer at the screen.  I dont believe you.  Why would you want to test my blood?  He raised his brows at her and she blushed, but she was still scowling as if hed betrayed her.  Huh.  He shouldve listened to Opal.   Here, he said.  Opal can do mine, as well.  I wouldnt allow her to drug me, would I?  She watched silently as Opal applied the device to his wrist.  He took it and held it out to Kiri so she could see the readout.  She stepped forward to look at it.  After shed examined the results, she nodded once, but maintained her defensive posture against the bulkhead.   You should have asked me.   Understood.  He turned to Opal.  Are you all right?  Yes, sir.   Kiri turned her glower on Opal.  Im sorry if I hurt you.  I guess you have to do what he says.   Opal raised her brows.   Logan smiled wryly.  She could have broken your neck if she wanted to.  She held back because you were only trying to get away.   Oh.  Kiri eyed Opal with new respect.  Are you some kind of bodyguard?  Opal nodded with dignity.  Among other things.  Although Mr.  Stark doesnt really need a bodyguard.  She gave him a look that said he needed a conscience much more, but he ignored her with the ease of long practice.   All my personal employees are ex-Space Forces, Logan said.  And now I suggest you sit down, as were nearing our destination.   Where? His passenger leaned over to look out the nearest porthole.  Opal disappeared, the medic kit in hand.   Where would you like it to be? One finger across his lips, he watched Kiri, knowing what her response would be.  He was not disappointedin that at least.   She turned on him, those magnificent eyes full of amber fire.  Better go back to my place, if I cant even fall asleep without someone messing with me.   Youre angry.  Damn.  Definitely should have listened to Opal.   She flung herself into the chair across from him.  No kidding.  Just because you bought me a meal, you had no right to treat me like a  Dont say it, he interrupted, his amusement gone.  Dont even think it.  He gave her the look he used to bring tough beings and ex-soldiers to heel.   Whore, she said defiantly.  Im not one, wont be treated like one.   He was going to enjoy turning her over his knee.   If Id thought you were a prostitute, I wouldnt have invited you to dinner, he told her.  I would have given you credit and fucked you where and when and how I wanted you.   He watched that strike home, watched her wrap her slender arms around her middle.  Wisely, she said nothing further.   I would ask the same precaution from any potential sex-partner, he went on.  Vaccinations for STIs and pregnancy may be compulsory here, but that doesnt mean everyone obeys the law or shows common sense.  You know that.   Yeah, well you should have asked, she said stubbornly.  I wont have things done to me without my consent.   He bowed politely.  So noted.   She echoed the gesture, wrinkling her nose as she did so.  He let his anger slide back into amusement.   She was a wildcat, all right.  And he wanted her claws in his hide.  But hed wait, because he wanted her willing, eager when he took her.  So eager shed agree to all the extremely intimate things he wanted to do with her.  And to all the things he wanted her to do for him.   Take me home, she repeated, clearly not appreciating his smile any more than his plain speaking.   All right.  Whats the closest landing pad to your home?  The Astra quadrant, Landing Ten.   He scowled, all traces of amusement gone.  Thats the roughest area of New Seattle.  Unfortunately, he knew it well.  No place for a single woman, especially one whose looks would invite the interest of every ganger and slimeball on the streets.   Tell me something I dont know.  I get by.  She stared out the porthole, her hands clenched together in her lap.   So her business truly was in trouble if she lived in the crowded, dirty area near the port.  Her family must have left her with little credit, or perhaps it was all tied up in her coffee stand.   Or perhaps her gambling was the problem.  Shed said it wasnt.  Hed find out if that was true.  And then hed deal with itbecause his decision was made.  He wanted her, and for more than one night.  And what he wanted badly enough, Stark always got.   But right now, hed deal with protecting her from her dubious home.   Giles.   Yes, sir.  His pilots face appeared on holovid, lit weirdly by the multi-colored lights of the control panel.   Astra quadrant, Landing Ten.   Giles looked away, punching in the coordinates.  He frowned, his heavy brows shooting together.  Unemployed rioting in that area again.  Reports in the last hour say its bad.  I recommend against landing under these conditions, sir.   Stark jerked his chin affirmatively, letting his pilot know he agreed, and there was no way they were dropping off their passenger down there alone tonight, apartment or no.   Kiri bolted upright.  We must land.  I have to look after my place.  Besides, the fightings been three or four streets over, closer to the wharfs.  Really.   Take us over as low as you can, Stark instructed his pilot.  Use your judgment.   His guest crouched by the porthole to peer down at the lights of the city, visible in ragged drifts through the fog and clouds.  Her hand clenched on the rim of the window.   Kiri, come here.  Youll have a much better view on the holovid.  Giles, the forward and belly cams, please.   He held out his hand and, when she put her hand in his, tugged her to him.   The rioting had been getting worse in the past weeks.  Crooked unions, ruthless companies, swarming criminals, and hungry people who had little to lose made for a volatile stew, and it was all boiling over.   Kiri caviled at sitting on the edge of his chair, but only until the holovid changed to a view of the city below, then she perched quivering against his thigh.   Giles flew in low from the south, with the bay a black void on their left, and the lighted sea docks below.  The tall outlines of skyscrapers rose from the clouds, many windows lighted, some only black, gaping holes.   A sudden flash lit the streets below.  Kiri gasped, flinching against Stark.  He changed hands, holding hers with his right and slid his left arm about her, his hand on the curve of her small waist.  Flashbombs.   She nodded, then flinched again as another explosion rocked the night, this one bigger.   There.  Thats my building, between those two tall ones.  And theres the landing.   She gripped Starks hand, turning a pleading look on him, her eyes huge in her face.  We can  Warned by his expression, she whirled back just in time to see the street before her building light with an eerie red which flared to brilliant orange-yellow, scaling the buildings as if in obscene glee.  The cityscape below seemed to tremble, only to rock with another, much larger explosion.   Her building bulged outward, fire erupting from the windows.  Then the tall structure imploded, falling in on itself in slow, terrible inevitability.   She moaned, a hoarse cry of animal pain.  Flying forward on her knees, she smacked her hands flat on the porthole as if she could beat back the explosions.  Hed seen it before in these very streets as mayhem or accident destroyed what the denizens had worked to build.   Stark grabbed her, holding tight as she fought to free herself.  He hauled her back into his arms, cradling her against his chest.  Giles.  Get us out of here.   Opal appeared in the cabin door, grasping the frame for balance as the ship rocked with the concussion of the explosions below.  Your penthouse, sir?  Stark nodded and then turned his attention to the woman who had collapsed against his chest.  He tipped his head to the side to peer into her face.  She wasnt weeping, but his initial relief quickly changed to a deeper worry.  She lay against him, her face white as chalk, her eyes half closed.  She trembled with each shallow breath.  Shock.   He held her close, tucking her silky head under his chin and rocked her, his hand smoothing over her back.  Shh, youre safe.  Youll come with me.  In the morning well figure things out.   Without being asked, Opal glided to the back of the ship, to his private cabin and returned with a comforter, woven of Pangaean halfpaca, soft and warm, in Lodestars trademark gray.  She helped Stark tuck it around Kiri, wrapping her in a cocoon of warmth.   Its all gone, she mumbled.  My things.   Stark met Opals eyes.  Kiri couldnt have had much, in that place.  But losing it tonight, on top of losing her credit  that was one hell of a lot to process.   Mementoes, perhaps, Opal murmured, her eyes soft with pity.   Hed nothing to say to that.  Everything he possessed, hed fought for and won, or purchased for himself as a grown man.  But he knew that to people whod grown up with a family, such things were important.  Holographs, jewelry, pieces of furniture, even treasured clothing were passed down, squabbled over.   Hed started with nothing.  Was this woman strong enough to do the same?       5  Kiri dreamed that she ran through the dark, wet streets toward her apartment building.  In the way of dreams, her feet would not move, mired in helplessness as thick as glue.  Around her, the buildings burned, flames spurting viciously between the buildings, hissing in patches of old fuel and piles of garbage.  Beings shouted, their cries far away, muffled as if a curtain hung between her and their battles.   But she was not alone.  Whirling, she gaped at the tall form looming in the street behind her, a black silhouette against the flames.  Only his eyes glittered, reflecting fiery red and yellow of the flames, and yet she knew the flame that burned inside him was more powerful stillthat of absolute will.   Its gone, Stark told her, his deep voice slicing through the chaos like a steel blade.  Nothing left for you here.  He held out his hand to her in a clear command.   No, she protested, shaking her head desperately.  No, theyre still there; I just have to find them.   She turned away, trying to move on, but her feet were trapped in hot, enveloping folds.  She tried to scream, but nothing emerged but a whimper.   Kiri, he ordered, his heavy hands grasping her arms like manacles.  Kiri.  Wake up.   She woke to find herself lying in a soft bed.  Stark leaned over her, a powerful silhouette against dim lamplight.  His hands grasped her bare arms.  As she stared up at him, her heart thundering against her ribs, she knew a sudden, nearly overpowering urge to fling herself against his shoulder and weep.   He didnt give her the choice, pulling her into his arms.  He was living heat and strength, from the broad expanse of his chest to the length of his legs, clad in some light, clinging fabric.  Against her bare skin Someone had undressed her, although she still wore her soft bra and panties.   He was in the bed with her.  This realization should have shocked her, but instead, he was a bulwark against the nightmare.  She snuggled closer, shivering, her face in the curve of his throat.  His scent filled her nostrils, clean male musk, tinged with that delicious tang of the forest.  She spread her palms flat on the hair-roughened plane of his chest, her belly snugged against his, her legs opening to tangle with his longer ones.   Shh, he murmured, his voice a rumble in her ear.  Its all right.  Youre safe.   One of his arms was wrapped around her, his hand stroking her bare back.  The other hand cupped the back of her head, his long fingers spearing through her short hair.  From this warm nest, it seemed safe to examine her memories, terrible as they were.   My place . . .  is it really gone?  Yes.   She shuddered.  Not a nightmare then, but real.  I dreamt I was there.  While it burned.  And I couldnt do anything.   You were there.  His breath was warm on her temple, his lips brushing her skin.  And you cant do anything about it.   She took a sobbing breath, fighting the hot weight of tears pushing behind her eyes.  I wont be helpless.  I wont.  Im strong.   His hand smoothed over her back again, down into the curve and lower, over her ass.  Youre a fierce one, Kiri te Nawa.   The remnants of her fear morphed into anger, swift and hot.  She pushed at his chest, her fingers tangling in the mat of short, curling hair on his chest.  Are you laughing at me again?  His hand smoothed down her back again.  No, wildcat.  Im admiring you.  Youve been through a lot in the space of a few hours, and youre still hissing your defiance.  Hold onto that.  Sometimes defiance is the only thing that gets you through.  Although Id remind you recklessness does not necessarily denote strength.   Sometimes  its all Ive got, she whispered.  Then, ashamed of betraying vulnerability, she flexed her hands, digging her nails into the plush swell of muscle of his pectorals.  He sucked in a sharp breath, and she bared her teeth against his throat and nipped at him.   His fingers tightened painfully in her hair, and he pulled her head back, his eyes glittering.  Tyger kitten or no, do that again and Ill turn you over my knee.  His breath puffed warm and moist against her face.   She believed him, but she needed some outlet for the emotion tumbling inside her.  Sliding her hand up, she speared her fingers into his short hair, cupping the back of his head, hard and silky under her palm.   She tried to pull him closer, but he resisted.  She glared at him.  Couldnt he see she needed him, needed forgetfulness? She was just giving him what he wanted, wasnt she?  Are you sure? His face was taut, his square jaw set.  If I kiss you, I wont stop there.   Her heart thundering, trying to climb her throat, Kiri trembled clear into her feminine core.  She held male power in her grasp.  She wanted desperately to unleash it, use him to burn through the dark backlog of despair.  Yes.  I want this.   He swooped, his mouth opening over hers, his lips hot and demanding, his tongue licking into her mouth to claim hers.  It was more than a kiss, it was a claiming, and she reveled in it, her body softening against his, his taste and scent filling her senses.  This was sheer hedonistic pleasure, drowning her in sensation.   He held her in one arm, while his free hand stroked down over her shoulder, his fingers tracing the edge of her soft bra.  He cupped her breast in his hand, and she arched into his touch, loving the cup of his palm over her sensitive flesh, even through the thin, stretchy fabric of her bra.  He dragged his thumb over her nipple and she moaned as pleasure shot down through her body, straight to her pussy.   Kissing her deeply, Stark stroked his hand down over her belly, over the thin fabric of her panties.  His fingers delved between her thighs, and he cupped her mons.  Claiming her most private place, for now.   Another moan struggled up her throat, the soft sound hanging over them, above the rustle of sheets, the rush of their breath and the thundering of her heart.   Thats right, he urged against her mouth.  Let me hear your pleasure.   He let her go, just long enough to yank at her panties.  The soft fabric tugged at her hips and then tore, falling away from her.  She should care, but she wanted his hand on her again, so desperately that she whimpered instead, opening her thighs to him, lifting her upper leg to curl it over his hip, arching into him.   When he cupped his hand over her again, bared now to his warm, powerful touch, she cried out at the exquisite relief.  He kissed her again, closing his lips over hers to drink in her cry.   Then he stroked his long fingers into her waiting flesh.  His touch was sleek and easyshe was wet for him, so ready for the large pad of his finger to delve into her, drawing her wetness up, up and over the swollen knot of nerves hiding in her curls.   This? he asked gently, drawing his finger in a tiny, tantalizing circle.   Yes.  She strained toward him.   Say my name, Kiri.  He stroked her again, with the same teasing care, and her pussy contracted, aching for more.  She dragged her eyes open enough to find him watching her, his eyes hooded, gleaming with pleasure as if he were surveying a new acquisition, one that he planned to exploit to the fullest.  Who do you want touching you?  You.  Stark, she managed, wanting to hit him, wanting to kiss him.  Please, touch me.   Logan.  Youll call me Logan.  Say it when you come.  Can you do that for me?  How dare he sound so  tender, coaxing? She wanted to please him as much as she craved the pleasure his diabolically clever touch promised.   She had to get out of here.  Just as soon as he gave her what she needed.  This was just sex.  Any more of his tenderness, and she was afraid shed cling to him like a weakling, not wanting to let go.  Yes.   Good.  Lights, dim.  The room darkened around them, until he was only a darker shape in the shadows around them.  I want you only to feel, Kiri.  Feel me, feel my touch.   He stroked her again, slicking more of her wetness up over her clitoris.  His touch quickened, deepened, sure and swift.  She clung to him, breathing his breath, bowing into his touch as he stroked her up the cliff of need and tugged her over the top.   Logan  Logan.  She arched in his hands, her pussy spasming with delicious pleasure that spread outward, through her body.  With a shudder, she sank against him.   Mmm, he approved.  Again, I think.   She opened her mouth to protest.  She was relaxed, hazy with release.  And in her previous encounters, one orgasm had seemed a fortunate thing.  But he kissed her, and his tongue licking into her mouth, and two large, insistent fingers thrusting up inside her pussy was so lovely she surrendered, just for a little while longer, to the pleasure of being explored by a man who clearly knew his way around a womans body.   Youre very tight, he murmured against her mouth.  I like that.   She opened her mouth to reply, but gasped instead when he hooked his fingers, pressing hard against a magical pad of nerves still throbbing from her orgasm.  Need spiraled again and when he stroked his thumb over her clitoris, she moaned his name.   Logan  oh, that feelsthats so   He nipped at her lower lip, wet from his kisses.  Can you take your bra off for me? Id enjoy suckling you while I make you come again.   She would have done anything he asked in that moment.  Fumbling with the soft fastening between her breasts, she pulled her bra open and shrugged her shoulder out of it, letting it fall behind her.   Mmm.  He moved down in the bed and she felt his hot breath on her bare breast.  Put your nipple in my mouth, little cat.   Incredibly, she blushed, heat scalding under her skin in the darkness.  She cupped her hand around the back of his head and pulled him to her breast, arching her back to offer herself for his mouth.   He laughed, low in his throat.  Your pussy is squeezing my fingers like a hot little vise.  He moved his head, brushing his lips back and forth over her pebbled nipple.  Nice and long, I like that.   Then he licked her nipple into his mouth and began to stroke her again, inside and out.  He enjoyed her other breast as well, using his teeth carefully on her distended nipple and then pulling on it strongly, a soft, wet tugging that sent pleasure streaking through her in dark pulses, in time with his fingers.  And Kiri found that she could, after all, respond a second time, longer than the first.   Say my name, he commanded, his voice a velvet leash in the darkness, binding her to him.   Logan, she cried, riding his hand into delicious oblivion.  Then she simply whimpered as she came apart in his hands.   When she had finished, he pulled her close against him, her thigh across his hip.  Kiri lay in his arms, panting.  Her skin was damp and hot as if shed been running, her muscles lax.  She stroked her face against his throat, breathing him in and slid her hand over his shoulder, stroking the hard curve of muscle and down over the bulge of his biceps.   She shifted and felt another bulge, a hard rod that twitched against her mons, straining beneath his thin sleep pants.  Kiris eyes flew open as she realized that he had pleasured her twice and himself not at all.   She opened her mouth and nipped the tender skin where the strong column of his neck flowed into his shoulder.   He grunted.  The lights gleamed on and she found herself flipped onto her back, her wrists cuffed over her head on the pillow in his ungentle grip, gazing up into the eyes of a dangerous man.  I told you what Id do if you used your teeth or claws on me again.   Breathless with daring, Kiri showed him her teeth.  Why dont you have me, instead?  His brows shot together.  Because I dont take advantage of women who are traumatized.   What do you call what you just did?  He smiled slowly.  I call that making you very relaxed.   She licked her lips, suddenly dry from her swift breaths.  He had her completely in his power, and at this moment, there was nowhere she would rather be.  Then let me make you very relaxed, Logan Stark.   His eyes fired again, molten heat replacing the anger.  He moved, settling into the cradle of her open thighs with a lithe twist of his powerful body.  She moved to accommodate him, helpless to hide her response as she felt his cock lying on her belly, long and turgid even through his thin pants.   Are you sure? He moved again, driving himself against her.  Because I dont need to be repaid for anything.   Is that why women usually let you fuck them? To repay you for  things?  No, Kiri, its not.  But I dont suppose youll believe me until I prove it to you, will you?  Instead of waiting for her answer, he kissed her, still holding her wrists imprisoned.  His weight pressed her down in the soft bed, his powerful grip held her helpless and yet it anchored her, protected her.  Completely unlike her usual independence, but for now, strangely right.  Somehow, by demanding her compliance, hed removed the shame of wanting to do whatever he told her.  She was safe in his skilled hands.  She loved the abrasion of his hairy chest on her breasts, the hard press of his hipbones into her inner thighs, his mouth devouring hers.   He lifted up just enough that there was air between them and leaned on the elbow of the arm he held her hands with, reaching down with the other hand to shove his pants down.  His cock slapped against her bare belly like a hot, silken brand.   Kiri shivered with the intensity of her excitement, and he watched her closely as he took himself in hand, the back of his hand brushing her mons as he stroked his shaft, up and down.  He looked into her eyes as he stroked the broad, hot head into her swollen labia, and then pressed, thrusting into her.   She closed her eyes, suddenly shy, and his grip tightened on her wrists.  Dont look away from me.  I want to see those Tyger eyes while I fuck you.   He kissed her, a swift, hard kiss.  Kiri.   Yes, Logan.  She gazed into his eyes as he thrust again, deeper.  It burned a little.   Watching her closely, he pulled out a little and thrust again, his way easier this time as her arousal slicked his shaft.  Am I hurting you? Youre very tight.   She shook her head stubbornly and he kissed her again.  Little warrior.  Here, this will help.   Letting go of her wrists, he moved up over her.  Kiri tipped her head back to watch as he reached into a cubby in the headboard of the big bed.  He came back with a small vial of clear, golden liquid.  Sitting back on his haunches between her thighs, he squirted some into his palm and then stroked it over his cock with slow strokes, as if it was very pleasurable.   She watched raptly.  He was beautiful, his cock springing up from his groin, long and thick and suffused with blood, the broad head dark.  Sheathed in liquid, his shaft glistened under his stroking hand.   He watched her watching him, his face taut with purpose and pleasure.  What is that? she asked.   Gesics, with enhancers, he answered.  Safe organics.  Youll like it.   He poured more of the ointment into his palm and tipped his hand down to let the warm liquid flow over her mons and down over her pussy.  Then he stroked his wet fingers into her folds, watching as he did so.  A warm tingle spread from his fingers, delicious and a little frightening.   He looked up, watching her face as he thrust his fingers deep inside her.  It will feel even better with my cock inside you.   She dug her fingers into the bed, wanting to hide from his knowing gaze and yet thrilling to it.  Then what are you waiting for?  He withdrew his hand and knelt over her, wiping his fingers on his hard thigh.  Perhaps for you to ask me nicely to fuck you.   The independent side of her wanted to slide regally off the bed and walk away, tease him as he was teasing her.  But the ointment was working its magic on her pussy, making it throb and ache emptily.  Or perhaps that was just the sight of his cock, waiting arrogantly for her to surrender and take him into her body.  Perhaps it was all of him.   Shed never wanted anyone more.  She bent her knees back, opening herself to him.  Fuck me, Logan Stark.   He came down over her, his eyes blazing into hers.  Oh, I will, Kiri te Nawa.  Until you give me what I want.   Then he thrust into her, again and again, until he was seated deep inside her, the head of his cock lodged against the back of her pussy.  Filling her to the brim, to her limits, with virile, rampant male.  He lifted up just enough to look down between their bodies and grunted with satisfaction.  Ah, thats so good, little cat.  Now, give me your hands.   It was only when he kissed her again that she realized shed lifted her arms over her head for him.  His hand grasped her wrists, manacling them tenderly as he began to move inside her.  She moaned into his mouth at the overload of sensation in her pussy and he moved faster, thrusting into her with long, hard strokes.  He was too big, too much, too everything.  She fought him and he slowed, but kept moving.  He didnt let her go, either.   Shh, he murmured against her lips.  Ill stop if you need me to, little cat.  You know that, yes?  Looking into his eyes, she nodded.  He kept moving, slowly, holding himself back.  Kiri moaned again, this time in pleasure.  She moved her hips up to meet his, urging him onward.   What do you want? he asked roughly.   You.  Faster, she urged him.  Harder.   He groaned with pleasure and complied, driving into her with increasing force.  The slap of flesh, the succulent sounds of their joining filled the quiet room, and his cock filled her until she could hold back no longer and screamed his name, her pussy convulsing in pleasure around him.   He came with a silent shudder that stiffened his long, powerful body over her, heat flooding her.  He relaxed slowly and lay in her arms, a heavy, solid weight of hot, damp male.  His breath soughed against her temple, his heart thundering against hers.   His grip on her arms relaxed, and his thumb caressed the soft skin of her inner wrists.  Then he lifted up, slowly pulling out of her.  Ravished and exhausted, Kiri lay there, feeling wet heat trickle out of her pussy and not caring.   He looked her over, a slow, hot sweep, before lying down beside her.  If you dont mind, I wont have you wash.  I enjoy knowing my cum is in you, he murmured.   Kiri was too shocked to answer.  Was there no facet of sensual activity this man wouldnt discuss?  He smiled, stroked his hand down over her, breast to hip, and let her go.   The lights dimmed once again, and she lay beside him in the darkness, listening to his breathing.  What had she done? And what had she allowed him to do? Hed done more than have her, hed possessed her.  She should have been in control of her own body and her responses, not him.   She squirmed, heat burning down her face, her throat and chest, remembering the way hed held her wrists and the way shed let him.  Oh, God, shed allowed him to subdue her like aa sexual captive, not an equal.  Shed never let a guy hold her down like that, it was  unnerving.   If only it hadnt been so good, so intense.  Hed drawn response after response from her, of a power she hadnt though herself capable.   Go to sleep, he murmured, his deep voice lazy with satisfaction and amusement.  You can think it through tomorrow.   My thoughts are my own.  She turned on her side, away from him.  At least what was inside her head was off-limits.   Hissing again so soon, little cat? Well, I suppose I didnt bring you here for conversation, did I?  Kiri pulled the soft covers up around her ears, and scowled into the darkness.  Even her rebuffs amused him.        6  Kiri woke with a start.  She curled up, her hands and one knee under her, ready to spring.  Where was she? In a strange bed, a strange room, filled with the soft light of glow lamps.   Logan Stark stood in the doorway of the room.  She relaxed with a huff of breath, her heart pounding.   Good morning, he said.  All right?  Kiris gaze slid over him.  He wore a snug singlet and pants, both of the same thin, clinging fabric, in his signature dark gray.  His broad shoulders and his arms, long and powerful, were bare and gleaming with a film of perspiration.  His hard face was flushed, his eyes bright, short hair clinging to his well-shaped head.  He looked younger without his armor of business suit.   What are you doing? No, of course she wasnt all right.  Memories were crashing over her in harsh, discordant waves.  The loss of her money, the dreamlike trip in his cruiser and the dinner, then the fire, which meant the loss of everything else except her coffee stand.   She remembered her first, wild hope that it had all been just a nightmare and rolled her eyes at her own navet.  Her nightmares attacked awake and asleep.   Physical training, he answered, watching her.  On my way to shower-dry.  You neednt get up yet.   Of course I do, she said.  Ive things I need to take care of.   What things?  She grimaced, scrubbing her hand fretfully across her eyes.  Oh, just a new place to live, some clothing, and my credit back.  Nothing much.  She moved and then froze as the covers slipped soft and silky against her skin.  She was naked.   She lowered her hand, staring at him over her fingertips.  He smiled slowly at her and the heat of memory swept over her face and body.  And to top it all off, shed not only slept with this man, she was in his home.  He was a stranger, if an incredibly sexy, virile one, but shed let him do everything he wanted to her.  Even restrain her hands.   Where are my things? She needed her own armor.   He regarded her calmly.  Kiri.  Stop worrying.  What happens between us is no cause for shame.   His admonition was too close for comfort, but she certainly wasnt discussing that with him.  Of course Im worried, she said.  Im the woman who just lost her credit and place to live, remember?  He walked over to the bed, standing over her like a ruler surveying a concubine.  And despite her turmoil, something in her traitorous body responded.   And Im the man whos going to take care of you.  Get up when youre ready.  Your lavatory is through there, and there are a few things in the walk-in closet.  Im sure youll find something to fit you.   She cast a lightning glance around the luxurious room, understanding locking on like a tractor beam that yanked her up and slammed her into the wall of realityStark reality.  Hed brought her to his pleasure pad.  He did this kind of thing on a regular basis.  She was just one of many women.   She dragged the soft coverlet with her as she thrust her feet over the edge of the bed and stood.  Where are my things?  His face didnt change, but she knew with a visceral certainty that he was amused.   They should be hanging in the closet, he said.  Enjoy your shower-dry.   Turning, he strolled toward the door, which stood partly open, revealing a quiet hallway.  Kiri sighed.  Wait.   Stopping the doorway, he turned to look back at her over his broad shoulder.   Thank you, she said.  Youve been  really kind.  I appreciate that.   Well, at least shed managed to surprise him, although the flash of expression was gone as quickly as it appeared.  He didnt give much away.  He inclined his head in acknowledgement.   Youre welcome.  Thank you for the very fine fucking.  Come and eat when youve dressed.   She frowned at him.  So maybe you were nice to me, she said.  Doesnt mean were doing any ofof this again.   Duly noted.  His eyes gleamed.  Although I believe I still owe you a spanking.   He was laughing at her.  She growled under her breath at his presumption that she would ever allow him to spank her.  But heat arrowed straight down through hershe could imagine that circumstance all too vividly.   He turned away.  She let her gaze slide down over his long, tapering back to lean hips and a tight, stellar ass, his thin drawstring pants draping over legs taut with muscle as he walked away.  The recessed door slid shut behind him.   When he was gone, she blew out a long breath, forcing herself to relax.  So shed had a hot tryst with a quadrillionaireit was over now.  He was dominating and as irritating as aa stone in her coffee beans.  And she was the one whod said yes to everything hed asked.   Strong women admitted their own foibles and learned from them.  So what she had to do was to stay at least an arms length away from him.  No more touching, he was too good at it.   And far enough away she couldnt look into his eyes.  They were like some kind of tractor beam, pulling her in.   Also crucial to stay out of range of that deep, compelling voice of his.  She had an uneasy feeling that she would do a lot to keep that warmth in his deep voice.  Not good.   She groaned quietly.  So far the man could seduce her with a look, a word or a touch.  Clearly, she needed to stay completely out of his orbit.   Desperate for a distraction from her weakness, Kiri looked around, this time slowly, taking in every detail of her surroundings.  It was like a luxury hotel at the pinnacle of the one of the citys skyscrapers that shed seen on the holovids.   The bedroom was the size of her entire apartment, all in softest of yellow, like a shaft of pale sunlight penetrating the heavy clouds of New Seattle.  The walls were smooth, the fitments cerametal of gray so pale it was nearly white, as was the plush carpet under her feet.   She padded across the room, trailing her blanket.  She nearly tossed it on the bed, but eyed the door uneasily, not willing to trust it wouldnt open again to divulge one of his employees.  He probably had staff here.  She froze.  Oh God, they might have heard her cries last nightshed been pretty noisy.   Okay, not thinking about that.   The closet opened at a touch of her fingers, wide doors sliding open with a whisper.  Wow.  More than a closet, it was an entire small room, stocked with everything a woman could desireat least for the boudoir.   There were robes of lii leaf silk, light as wisps of steam on their hangers, slippers set neatly in racks.  A wide rack of drawers opened to reveal little lii silk tanks and panties, nighties and underthings of what looked like cobwebs, woven of delicate colors to highlight a womans skin.   She stroked her fingers over a pair of shell-pink panties, grimacing when a callus snagged the delicate fabric.  Spider laceshed seen it in the high end shops on the space port concourse, but never touched it.  It felt as lovely as it looked.   Stepping back resolutely, Kiri grabbed her black tunic and tights, hanging like a dead raven amongst the jeweled colors of the other garments.  She sniffedtheyd been cleaned, the fabric fresh.   She turned to leave, only to stop in her tracks as she realized her serviceable underthings were missing.  Her cheeks flamed with embarrassmenther panties and light bra were made of cheap fabric that had been recycled until the fibers frayed, but they were what she could afford.  And now they were gone.  That space magnate had ripped her panties off and probably thrown her bra away with it.   But most importantly, hed seen it and handled itand everything that lay underneath it.  She took a step and nearly tripped over the blanket.  Or perhaps she was stumbling over the truththat she had loved every moment of sex with Logan Starkand she wanted more.   She dropped the blanket, but the memory of his touch remained wrapped around her.         Stark stood in his lav, running the shaver over his jaw.  As the tiny blades hummed, he glanced from the mirror to the holovid hovering in midair to his left.   The penthouse was fitted with surveillance holocams in every room, for security purposes.   But he wasnt above using them to assuage his curiosity about his current guest.  He had half an idea that she would run without even saying goodbye.  If she wanted to go, hed see her safely back to the port.  That way hed know where to find her again.   Now he watched appreciatively as she let the coverlet fall to the carpet.   Kiri te Nawa was a beauty, all right, with her pale golden skin.  Slender and well-muscled, with long legs, a tiny waist and flat belly, but she had a full, heart-shaped ass.  Her breasts were small, but they were high and firm, with small, dark peach nipples.  She had fine ankles, slender, high-arched feet and capable little hands.  Scarred with old burn marks.  Scalds from coffee, probably.  Hed like to send her to a top plastic surgeon, have the damage repaired.  Her golden skin should be flawless.   His appreciation changed to amusement as she poked through one of the drawers in the dressing room bureau, her expression veiled.  Pretending even to herself she didnt care about whatever was in that drawer.  Her eyes brightened though, when she found something she liked.   He grinned to himself as she lifted a pair of red spider lace panties and bra from the drawer.  Wasnt a woman of his acquaintance who could resist lovely underthings.  She reached in again for a pair of delicate black stockings.  With them in her hand, she turned, and his gaze dropped to the feathery triangle of black curls on her mons.  His groin tightened and he grimaced wryly as he switched off his shaver.   Seemed once with her had only whetted his appetite.  Hed move to keep her for a time, then.  She could use his help, and he was more than ready for her in his bed again.   His last lover, the ex-mistress of a business rival, had been beautiful, inventive and full of information about her former husbands business, but theyd parted weeks ago.  Hed visited an exclusive sex club once since then, but while hed come away sated physically, he wouldnt mind a woman with whom he could talk, as well.   Kiri walked into the lav and Stark switched off the holovid link.  Seemed she wasnt going to run, at least not quite yet, so hed give her privacy.  Little cata man never knew when her claws were going to come out.   One thing about her, he wouldnt be bored.         Stark was waiting for Kiri when she emerged, clean and dressed.  He stood on the other side of a large, open room, a mug in his hands, looking out at the dark, foggy New Seattle day through floor to ceiling windows.  He was dressed now in black fitted trousers and low boots, topped with a shirt of purple so dark it was nearly black.  He had a brooding look, as if his thoughts were far away.  Probably plotting how to own everything he saw.   The room was furnished in the same exquisite style as the bedroom, although in dark colors from the black leather of the bold, square furniture to the pewter and grays of the cushions inviting one to sit down and watch the rain from this warm, plush haven.   Is that dark roast I smell? she asked, stopping in the middle of the room.   Stark turned, his gaze focused on her like a laser.  Kiri realized shed braced herself for the force of his attention.  Ah, and there was that smile as he looked her over, leaning one elbow on the wide ledge of the framework that traversed the windows.   Memories swirled between them with such heat she was surprised the windows didnt fog up.  Him, surging over her in the lamplight, his cock buried to the hilt in her.  Stroking her deep inside, possessing her.   She locked her knees against the urge to go to him.  Shed made him smile, that was only what she did for customers.  More than that was foolish.  He might have given her the best sex of her life, but that didnt mean they were true intimates.   Dark and hot, he agreed.  Come.  Ive real cream.   She crossed the room to him, or to his coffee.  On a table before the windows a coffee service was set out, as well as a number of covered dishes emitting intriguing scents.   Stark pulled one of the metal and leather chairs out for her.  His palm brushed the small of her back as she moved past him to sit.  Ignoring the thrill of pleasure rippling through her skin, Kiri sat.  She picked up the graceful cerametal carafe, pouring a stream of rich, dark coffee into her heavy mug.  She looked at him inquiringly and he held out his mug for a refill, looking quietly pleased.   She quelled the urge to wish she belonged here.  Better to pretend she was having a dream liaison in one of those fancy hotels.  Delightful, but soon over.   She accepted the small pitcher he handed her and poured some of the rich creamer into her coffee.  She took a sip and sighed with pleasure.  Rich and full-bodied, the coffee was delicious.   Pangaean, he said.  You like it?  She nodded, taking another drink.   Although of course you serve this at your stand, yes?  She gave him a look.  Oh, of course I do.  A vastly inferior grade, cut with so many grava beans it bore only a faint resemblance to this rich, dark brew.   Holding the hot cup in her hands, Kiri looked out the window at her side.   Wow.  How high are we? she asked faintly.   Thirty stories.  Like the view?  And shed thought her fourteenth-floor walkup was high.   Those buildings down there look like the building blocks my brother and I used to play with.  But at least from up here one couldnt see the dirt and squalor of much of the city.   Youve a brother? he asked.   She froze, and then took another drink too quickly, scalding her mouth.   Used to.   Ah.  Ive two, myself, he said quietly.   She jerked her chin in silent acknowledgement, but didnt look at him, hoping hed take the hint.  The pain was too big.  If she let it out now, after all shed been through, shed never get it contained.  And she had to contain it, had to hold on.  Even if it was only by her claws, with the abyss yawning beneath her.   She focused fiercely on the view.  A big transport barge dropped out of the clouds to hover, signal lights flashing.  The control room at the top held two humans and another being with a bulbous blue head.  A Lo-Aq, maybe.  If so, she pitied the quarkers stuck in that cockpit with him.  The barges hull was battered, scarred by collisions with small meteors, other craft, docks and perhaps more.   A small port authority cruiser zipped up to hover by the barge, and the huge craft followed, dropping down into the fog.   Dizzy, Kiri jerked her gaze back to the room.   Hungry? Stark asked.   She surveyed the covered dishes over her coffee mug.  Shed sworn shed never want to eat again after that meal last evening, but she was hungry.  When she nodded, Stark set down his mug and touched a button on the table.  The cerametal covers of the dishes retracted, revealing their contents.   Kiri inhaled the rich aromas.  The scones she recognized; she sometimes bought one from the bakery on the next concourse at the port.  The fruit was golden ripe gremel from Pangaea.  The fluffy yellow contents of the smaller dish next to it were a mystery, as were the crisp brown cylinders reposing in the third.   Moonhen eggs and vegeprotein sausages, Stark said.  Try some.  Delicious.   She eyed them doubtfully.  Real bird embryos?  Full of protein, he coaxed, his eyes twinkling.   All right, then.  Kiri allowed him to dish her some of the eggs and one of the sausages.  She took a small bite of the eggs, chewing carefully.  They were as tender as they looked and delicious, so she nodded at his look of inquiry and took a bite of the vegsausage.  It was salty and crisp, and melted on her tongue.  Thats really good.  She took another bite, looking greedily at those left in the dish.   He nodded, indicating that she should take more.  I thought youd like it.   The gremel fruit was sweet, the scones were light and flaky, laden with plump dried berries.  Kiri ate until she was full, setting down her fork with regret.  Delicious, thank you.   Stark nodded, but his eyes sharpened over his coffee mug.  Youre welcome to stay for the midday meal.   Her heart lifted, but only for an instant.  Much as shed love to stay in his luxurious orbit, it was not to be.   Ive things to do.  A new place to live, and  He merely looked at her and she broke off with a shrug.  He probably didnt recall what it was like down here at the bottom of the food chain.   I cant get your credit back, he said.  I know you dont like what the Vulpean did, but it wasnt illegal.  But I can help you.   Her heart gave another happy little leap.  She rubbed her damp palms over her thighs.  Oh.  What would that involve?  He shrugged, as if it were as inconsequential as which flavor to have in his coffee.  Well decide that later.   Later? She didnt have until later.  She only had now, and even that was debatable.  Time to wake up from this pleasant little dream.   Kiri slid out of her chair, rising to look down at Stark.  It should have been an advantageous position, but somehow it wasnt.  Only stubbornness held her straight and adamant, when she wanted to sink back into her chair and agree to whatever he was offering, except that she wasnt sure it was anything but a soft nest for a few days and nights.   Thanks, but I have a business to run.  I cant just take the day off.   Kiri  Look, I appreciate your offer, but Im a businesswoman, not one of your fancy whores.  I cant just lounge around here.  She waved her arm at the big room with its plush accoutrements.   His gaze iced.  Kiri bit her lip, wishing she could swallow her hasty words.  Quark, shed had better manners than that since she was nine.   It was just that her lovely breakfast was knotting in her stomach with nerves as she remembered the gaping hole of her credit account and the empty coffee bins in her kiosk and her apartment and all its contents, gone.   What she really wanted to do was fling herself into his arms and weep.  Not exactly a move of strength.   He held her there with just a look.  I dont want to hear that word from your mouth again.  It has nothing to do with you.   Sorry.  I didnt mean that.  Not that way, at least.   She couldnt very well tell him it was the thought of being only one more in a swift parade through this placehere this week, gone when another more beautiful woman caught his eye, that drove her hot words.  She was different, that was all.  Just a novelty for him in his shiny world.   Whereas the debacle awaiting her in hers was of such a magnitude that those sinister wings were flapping under her breastbone again.   Stark rose, setting his napkin down.  Well, that was fine, glad one of them was calm.   A pity in a way, he said.  Youd make an alluring courtesan.   Her face burned.  Okay then.  She knew what he thought of her.  Still a whore, just a higher class of one.   He shook his head, a crease between his brows.  Whatever youre thinking, no.  I wasnt offering to keep you, he said.  Though I would be glad to do that.   Hed be glad to keep her? She gaped at him.  When his gaze fell to her mouth, she closed it with a snap.  Exactly what were you offering?  He walked around the table toward her.  To help you.  We can discuss it later.  Over lunch, perhaps?  Umno, I cant.  Ive my business.   Dinner, then.  He pulled a comlink from his belt in one smooth motion.  Giles, Ms.  te Nawa is leaving.  Pick her up at the side entrance, please.   Giles will take you to the port.  Hell also pick you up later, if you wish.   She nodded, not sure what to say.   You can wait there, he indicated a passageway at the end of the large area.  Hell be up in a few moments.  Ive business of my own to attend to.   She waited for him to walk away, but he stopped beside her, his shoulder nearly brushing hers.  He lifted his right hand and stroked his fingertips down her cheek.  She stared at his collar, fighting the urge to turn her face into his warm hand.   Her gaze lifted as high as his cleft chin, then that firm mouth.  It curved up slowly in a smile of pure amusement, but there was heat there too.   Ill see you later, little cat.   That lifted her gaze to his.  She frowned.  Why do you call me that?  His smile deepened.  Dont you know? he murmured.  Because you remind me of a sleek, lovely little cat, purring one moment, then hissing and showing your claws the next.  Youve Tygean blood in you.   My mother, she answered, torn between charm and irritation by his description of her.   Ah.  Perhaps sometime well visit Bryght, and see what effect the mating moons have on you.   And with this outrageous suggestion, he pinched her chin gently, turned and strode away, through a wide door that hissed open at his approach, revealing a glimpse of a series of holovid screens glowing, and then shut again.   The big room was very quiet, almost empty without his vital presence.   Kiri forced herself to turn and walk into the passageway.  As she entered it, the hatch hissed shut behind her.   She looked back for a sec and then squared her shoulders and walked toward the landing pad.  Would she really be back, or was this the end of a brief, strange interlude?  Everything around her seemed slightly unreal, as if shed wake up any sec in her tiny, noisy apartment and find that it was time to rise and hurry to work, with Logan Stark not even a memory.   He wanted to see the effect of the mating moons of Bryght on her? Great God beyond, the man had no inhibitions when it came to making sexual suggestions.  She blushed again, this time all over.   Full-blood Tygers, both male and female, were known throughout the galaxy to be transformed by the pull of their mating moons into sensual creatures still mostly human in form, but more big cat in nature, who for a week or longer craved sex more than food or water.   Her mother had given that up to travel to Earth II with Kiris father, but Kiri had read enough to know that being part-Tygean herself, the female mating moons of her mothers home planet would have some effect on her too if she traveled there.  Which she would never do.  She might enjoy sex, but she had no intention of trusting her sexuality to the mercy of the lunar pull.   Foolish enough to trust it to this man.        7  What would it take to get her to trust him?  In his office, Stark poured coffee into the mug waiting beside a steaming carafe.  Taking a drink, he turned to pace before the streamlined space with its banks of waiting holovids and input station.  His little cat was going to be a handful.   He remembered the night before with a mixture of satisfaction and irritation.  It wasnt as if she was the type of woman he usually preferred.  She wasnt tall or bosomy, and her hair had been hacked by an inexpert hand.   There was just  something about the combination of feisty, independent cat and the pliant sweetness of her lithe body that drove him wild.  As well as her husky voice and that laugh of hers.  Even when shed been strung tight with nerves, hed still been able to make her laugh.  What had they been speaking of? Ah, skrog, of all things.  He smiled to himself, imagining her face when she first saw the creatures, as well as any number of other wonders in the galaxy.  She hadnt traveled, judging from her questions.   Shed known her share of loss, though.  No people, although shed let slip shed had a brother.  So shed lost him as well as her parents.  Now shed lost even her dubious shelter and most of her credit.   The dazed, animal pain in her eyes after the explosion of her apartment building had hit him hard.  He knew what it was to lose even ones shelter, to be cast onto the streets of this city with nothing, with survival hinging on every move, every decision.  Hed done it and she probably would too, but at what cost?  Hed slid into bed with her last night so that she wouldnt be alone when she woke.  He could have left Opal or his housekeeper, Natan, on night watch, or even set a holovid droid to hover by the bed, alert for any sign of agitation, but hed wanted to be the one to comfort her.   No hardship there, but he hadnt expected her to seduce him so determinedly.  He would have done many things to chase the shadows from those Tyger eyes of hers, but shed asked the very thing he wanted to do anyway.  And then shed delighted him by accepting his domination, even being comforted by it.   He wanted her to submit to him further.  He wasnt even sure all the ways yet.  Hed make them up as they went along.  She pleased him as few other women in his memory.   He froze, cup at his lips, steam curling against his face.  Surely that couldnt be true.  Hed had courtesans from several planets.  Beautiful women who knew tricks this little cat would never dream of.  No, he was just bored.  His businesses and investments were burgeoning on three planets and in space via his cruise ships, but lately hed been a bit  restless.   He smiled wickedly into his coffee cup.  The advice psychs did say to keep a pet.  So perhaps he owed it to himself to take on a Tyger kitten.   Hed keep his emotions out of it, of course.  He always did.  There were several beings in the galaxy he counted friends.  There were only two hed die forhis younger brothers, Joran and Creed.   Hed been in love once; for a time even nursed a broken heart.   Adora, his first and only love.  He grimaced, taking a swig of scalding coffee.   A less aptly named female had never been born.  Behind a face of sweet innocence had lurked a heart so mercenary hed been unable to believe the evidence of her betrayal.  Until, of course, hed seen it with his own eyes.  Then the truth had taken him down like a charging Mauritian.   Now he held himself apart from the idiocy that drove beings to make fools of themselves, risking fortunes and self-respect for hormone-ruled emotion.  Hed risked worse than thathis brothers well-being.   Hed never again allow himself to be led by his cock.  Sex was a necessity of life for him and Kiris cunt was sweet and wild, but he controlled when, how and all the rest.   It was merely curiosity that led him to bring up a one-way feed on the holocams.  Departure station and cruiser cabin, he said.   Two holovid screens sprang to life.  One showed the empty passageway out of his penthouse.  The other gave him a clear view of the cabin of his cruiser and the woman curled in one of the big chairs.  Kiri gazed out the porthole, arms wrapped around her slender midriff.  As he watched, she moved to tuck her feet up beside her in the chair, then stopped, casting a guilty look over at Opal, who stood in the passageway to the cockpit, chatting with Giles.   Camera, close up.  The holocam zoomed in on Kiris face as she turned back to the porthole.  Limned in the grayed light of another rainy day in New Seattle, her lovely face was taut, troubled.  Gazing past the holocam, she touched one hand to her lips and then blew out a sharp breath, nearly a sob in the sensitive microphones.   His guest was upset, was she? He sat in his big skrog leather and cerametal chair, taking another drink of his coffee.  Realizing just what a chore lay before her.  Shed attempt to scrape her life back together.  When shed had time to realize she needed him, hed move in again.  It was just a matter of time and strategy.   He looked away, satisfied.  Time for other business. News channels, up.  Earth II, primary.   An attractive blonde in a fitted suit filled the screen.  In our top local news story, rioting broke out again last night near the sea docks, and an entire block of buildings was destroyed.  Looters were seen leaving the area before the explosion.  Many are missing and feared dead in this latest wave of violence between the unemployed and the security forces for local unions and business owners.  According to the mayors office, Intergalactic Space Forces have been called in to police the docks.  More on that story shortly.   Stark watched without surprise.  This merely solidified his decision to consolidate his holdings here and sell the wharf-side factory to his employees.  His security people were doing all they could keep it from going up in flames until the IGSF was able to restore law and order.   The news anchor turned to another camera, which angled in.  In other news, we take you now to the New Seattle Spaceport, where safety concerns have been raised, after a local businessman was found murdered.  Lets join reporter Randy Mega on the scene.   Nothing new here, either.  Probably some poor sod in debt to organized crime.  Stark sipped his coffee as the holocam switched to a young man smiling toothily from a small, gleaming white hovie with the news stations logo.  Travelers filtered by behind him, gawking curiously.  One human boy broke away from his mother and made a face into the holocam before being recaptured.   The reporter furrowed his brow earnestly as he gazed into the holocam.  Yes, Gretchen.  Gral Roden, Vulpean owner of a gambling kiosk here on the Astrid concourse was found murdered this morning in the service passageway behind his place of work.  Roden was under investigation by local police and, weve just learned, by the IGSF for allegedly fixing several of his games.   Stark set his mug down on his desk, foreboding tightening his gut.   Randy Mega smirked confidentially into the camera.  Witnesses say that another local business owner, from this coffee stand The holocam swiveled to show Kiris Kaffe, closed and quiet, and then switched to a security feed of her standing at the counter in her kiosk, smiling and chatting with a customer as she handed him a disposable mug.  had a loud confrontation with Roden just yesterday evening, in which she accused him of cheating her out of a large sum of credit.  She is also alleged to have made actual death threats.  As you can see, she has not shown up to open her stand this morning.  Neighboring business people say they have no idea where she may be.   Seven hells.  Stark palmed his com unit from his belt.  Giles, if youre still in the air, turn around.  I need you to bring Ms.  te Nawa back here.   His pilots tough, square face filled the screen.  Sorry, sir.  Just dropped her off at the space port.  Problem?  Yes, a continuation of yesterdays, I believe.  Come and pick me up, please.   Opal and Giles had been monitoring him through the space port yesterday, a standard security procedure, so theyd seen him rescue Kiri from her attempted assault on the crooked gambler.   Be there in exactly twenty secs, sir.   Ill be waiting.  Logan rose and strode out into the main room.  Natan, a slender Pangaean, was clearing the table.  He straightened with dishes in his hands.   Good breakfast, Stark said.  Our guest will be returning for dinner.   Very good, sir.  Natans greenish-blond hair stirred slightly in excitement, although his slim, pale face remained politely impassive.  She has an excellent appetite.   Yes, Stark said.  She does indeed.  In more ways than his butler knew.   He collected his jacket from the closet by the passageway and strode down the passageway, just as the hatch at the end opened to reveal the cruiser, with Opal waiting.   Back to the space port, Stark ordered as he strode on board.  Your passenger is going to need rescuing again.   Really, sir? Opal didnt sound too surprised.   But then, reflected Stark wryly, neither was he.   As he sat back in his comfortable seat, he found himself chuckling.  He should have had Giles fly in the opposite direction.  The woman was a menace, to herself and possibly anyone in her vicinity.  Nothing sly about hershe broadcast her emotions for everyone to hear and see.   He wasnt even sure he could keep her out of trouble.         Kiri thanked Starks flight attendant, or guard, as the woman opened the cruiser hatch for her to disembark at the space port, but neither of them bothered with a smile this time.  Kiri wasnt wasting any friendliness on the woman after shed spent the entire flight keeping an eye on Kiri, as if that was the only thing preventing her from stealing the towels from the lavatory.   As Kiri exited the cruiser, she passed the cockpit.  It looked fascinating, full of gauges and lights and holovid displays.  She wished she could step in and see what it felt like to sit up there, mistress of her own destiny, instead of a rather unwelcome passenger.   Opal nodded curtly, and Kiri hurried along the podway toward the concourse, shivering in her thin tunic.  Even though they were enclosed, the podways were always cold and damp, and permeated with the harsh stench of the port.  Her shivers reminded her with a sickening jolt that she no longer owned a jacket, or indeed any clothes other than the ones she wore.   She stopped just before the entrance to the concourse, one hand to her face, light-headed even after her sumptuous breakfast.   Better get busy and sell some coffee, Kiri, she muttered to herself.  A fashionably dressed woman looked at her as she passed, then hurried on.   Kiri glowered after her.  The woman had looked at her as if she were a crazy, someone to be avoided.  Well, at least she had nice undies on, she thought with a flash of dark humor.  Probably nicer than those the fashionista wore.   And she wasnt entirely alone.  She had Logan Stark.  This memory lit a small, warm glow of hope in her chest.   Then she reminded herself not to depend on him.  Ships in the same port, that was all they were, docking for a short time and then moving on.         Kiri walked out onto the concourse and into yet another nightmare.   A crowd had gathered between her kiosk and the gambling den on the other side of the concourse.  She stared in amazement at a news reporter holding forth in the glare of the spotlighted holovid cams.  Even the space port police were here, their cycles hovering behind them as they worked the crowd.  They seemed to be asking questions.   At the back of the crowd was a familiar figure.  Maury was an older woman who worked the kiosks, selling packets of souvenirs.  Under a cloud of silver hair, her dark, lined face held the remnants of beauty.  She dressed in rag-tag ensembles, adding more layers in the winter, shedding some in the summer.   Kiri bought things from her when she could, but the magnets, clips and hovertoys were cheaply made, and she had trouble getting rid of them.  Sometimes she gave them away free with a latte just to clear the counters.  She would keep buying them, though, because Maury had an air of brave gaiety despite the grueling miles she put in every week.  She couldnt use the hoverways and stop at all the kiosks along the concourses, so she walked.  Of course a personal hoviecycle was out of the question.  They were very expensive, only for the space port guards and the wealthy elderly.   Kiri stopped beside the older woman.  Maury? Whats happening?  The peddler turned, eyes wide.  She dropped the handle of her hoviecart and embraced Kiri in a hug scented with stale perfume, hookah smoke and cooking odors.   My dear girl.  Youre all right.  I fearedwell.  Perhaps that youd been murdered, too.   Kiri pulled back, aghast.  Murdered? Whos been murdered?  Maury stiffened, her eyes fastened on something over Kiris shoulder.  Quickly, hide your face.  Theyre looking this way.   Too late.  There she is, called a raucous voice, rough with smoke.  Its her, the coffee seller.   Kiri froze as one of the bar habitus pointed at her.  Others turned to stare.  They conferred in hushed voices, watching her avidly.   Oh, dear, Maury fretted.  Theyve seen you now.   They were the space port police.  Kiri watched in horror as two of the helmeted, armor-clad officers leapt on their hovies and zipped over the crowd, dropping to either side of her and Maury, who clung to her protectively, her shabby shawl draped as much over Kiri as herself.   State your name and occupation, the taller of the two officers said through his microphone, stepping to the floor before Kiri.  She couldnt make out his face behind the reflection on his helmets clear face shield.   Kiri opened her mouth, closed it, tried to swallow the husk in her dry throat, and opened it again.  Kiri te Nawa.  I sell coffee  over there.  She nodded toward her kiosk.  Thats my shop.   Shes the one who had the altercation with the gambler, the other officer said from the height of her cycle.  Better bring her in for questioning.   Bring me in? Kiri repeated, ice creeping through her gut.  For what? Whats happened?  That awful little gambler, Maury said in her ear.  They found him behind his shopmurdered.   The Vulpean? Murdered right here? How horrible, even if the little rat had deserved it.  Butbut I didnt do it.  I wasnt even here.   Youll have the chance to call witnesses to attest to your whereabouts, the tall officer said.  Come along now.   We cant leave yet, the female officer told him.  We havent finished canvassing the witnesses to the altercation.  Hold her here until were finished.   Hey, wait a sec! Kiri protested, angry now.   The helmets ignored her.  Maury patted her shoulder fiercely.  Its all right, dear, she said.  You just need  well, you need  Kiri held herself stiff, outwardly defiant, staring back at the gawkers, their gaze avid, mouths busy gossiping.  A craven part of her wanted to bolt through the crowd.  The helmets were going to take her to space port police headquarters and question her.  She didnt know if she could stand itit would be too much like . . .  that other time.   You need a witness, Maury added, her eyes bright.  Someone to say you werent here.  I cant, because I was here.  But perhaps you were with a friend, hmm?  Stark.  Shed been with Logan Stark.  Relief filled her, buoyant and warm.   I was with someone, she told her guard.  I couldnt have killed anyone, I was with a man all night.   The officer held up his com for her to speak into.  State his name and occupation.   Stark, Kiri said.  Logan Stark.  Thatsthats him up there.  She pointed at the LodeStar hologram swirling above them.  As if summoned, Stark and his captains appeared, standing shoulder to shoulder, gazing down at the crowd.   The officer lowered his com.  Nice try.   Its true, Kiri cried, flushing with humiliation.  He thought shed seized Starks face and name from the holovid.  I was with him.   Well, vid him up, and he can vouch for you, the officer said cynically.   I-I cant, she admitted, her face burning.  I dont have his comlink code.  But I have one for his cruiser pilot.   The policeman showed her his back, his helmeted head turning back and forth as he scanned the crowd.   Oh, dear, Maury patted her again.  Thats too bad, dear.   Too bad? It was disastrous.  Hauled to port police headquarters? Shed never get her kiosk open, and if she didnt make a profit this week, shed lose her kiosk too.   Kiri ducked her head and pulled out her comlink.  Shed try to reach Starks pilot.  But her flimsy old unit chose this moment to flicker and sputter.  Come on, she muttered, fiddling with the controls.  Come on, work.   Hello-o, caroled a cheery, magnified voice.  The news hovie zipped over the heads of the crowd and stopped before them.  Kiri held up one hand to shield her eyes as lights glared into her face, nearly blinding her.  Are you Ms.  Kiri te Nawa, of Kiris Kaffe? How about answering a few questions? Is it true that you threatened to kill Mr.  Gral Roden?  The crowd moved closer.  Kiri edged behind the tall helmeted officer, wishing she could just disappear.  Her stomach roiled, her breakfast threatening to come back up.  She swallowed hard.   No! She glared at the smirking reporter.  I didnt kill him.   Stay back, warned the officer.  The news hovie retreated a few centimeters, but his gaze and his cameras stayed on Kiri.   But is it true that several witnesses heard you threaten to do so? The reporter trilled the word threaten with relish.   I didnt kill him.  Little quarker.  If she could reach those hovering cameras, shed smash them in his heavily made-up face.  Go on, leave me alone.   All right, were done here.  Bring the woman.  It was the female officer, aboard her hovercycle.   Come along.  A gloved hand grasped her arm, and Kiri was lifted off her feet and deposited in the back of the second cycle.  Youll come to headquarters.   No, wait, she protested, wriggling.  You have the wrong woman.   Sit down and be silent, prisoner.  A bar snapped around her, restraining her forcibly in the seat.  The armor-clad male officer stepped onto the cycle in front of her, and they zipped straight up, hovering above the crowd.  Faces turned up, eyes staring.   The last thing Kiri saw before she was whisked away was the newscaster pointing the cameras at her.  Behind him, the crowd shifted.  Her heart leapt.  Through a gap, she saw the face of the one man who could help her.  Logan Stark stood at the far side of the crowd, leaning on the wall of the concourse.  Watching the scene with detached interest.   Catching his eye, Kiri waited for recognition to spark, for him to forge through the crowd to her rescue.  Instead, he merely returned her gaze for a long, agonizing moment.  Her hands clenched into fists.  What was he waiting for?  Please, she mouthed.  Help me.   He looked away, his lips moving.  He was on his comlink.   He might as well have slapped her across the face.  The hovie rocked under her, but as she was swept away above the crowd, Kiri was blinded by tears.  Lying quarker.  What had he said to her? Im the man whos going to take care of you.   Right.  When she needed him the most, he was on a business call.  Guess he wasnt interested in saving her after all.  She was, as always, alone.        8  The new port authority headquarters was nice enough, if one entered through the front, with a reception area and pleasant, uniformed officers to answer questions.  Kiri had been there to fill out a theft form a few lunar months ago when someone stole her old display holocam.   It was considerably less pleasant when she was hustled in through a dark tube full of flashing beams and blipping monitors that held the stench of fear and sweat and other bodily functions, and ordered to stand still while droids scanned her body and clothing.  From there, more helmeted officers chivvied her into a small room with a large chair, holovid monitors humming ominously.   At least the officer on duty, a tired-looking Indigon with silver hair, was not wearing a full helmet.  But then he turned his piercing blue gaze on Kiri, and she pressed back into the chair, deciding she preferred faceless helmets to eyes that looked as if they could reach deep inside her and rip out all her secrets.   He gave her a slight smile as he scooted his rolling stool closer.  Youll be fine.  Just sit quietly.  The upturn of his thin lips did nothing to warm the chill of those deep sapphire eyes, or the trembling deep inside her.  She felt ready to fly into a million pieces.   What are you going to do? she demanded, eyeing the contraption of wires and small pads dangling from a metal arm projecting from the chair beside her head.   Question you.  It wont hurt, unless you try to get away.  Then youll receive an unpleasant shock.   Already had several of those today, she muttered.   I do not mean in the metaphorical sense, he said.  This would be physically painful.   Didnt he know that after having her world jerked out from under her and then having the only man who could have saved her refuse to do so, her pain was so deep it was physical? A cold, hollow void in her chest that made it hard to breathe.  Shed let Logan Stark fuck her, and hed turned away from her like a complete stranger.  Even Tal hadnt done that.   Now, the officer said, pausing with a thick black cuff in his hands.  Look at me.   Kiri did, and strangely, she felt calm flow through her, almost as if shed been drugged.   Youre doing that mind control on me, arent you? The panic was still there, but its wings were tethered now, as if wrapped in padding, along with her hurt and anger.   Yes.  You . . .  appear to need it.   Thank you, she remembered to say.   The officer gave her an odd look.  Must not get a lot of suspects with manners.   Kiri let him fasten a cuff around her wrist and attach one of the monitors to her inner wrist and another to her temple.   So, I just tell the truth and then youll know I didnt kill the gambler, right?  Correct.  He scooted away from her, and Kiri let her breath out in a whoosh.  If all she had to do was answer a few questions, she could do that.  And theyd soon see she was innocent.   We are ready.   A holovid sprang to life in the center of the room.  A grim being faced Kiri, with a grayish face that could have been carved from cerametala Freyan.   Even with the shot of whatever mind-padding the Indigon officer had given her, perspiration broke out on her upper lip and prickled under her arms.  With a supreme effort she kept her face stoic.  Freyans were known for their ferocity and lack of the softer emotions.  They made great wardens for places like the prison planet, Deep Six.  This one wore the uniform of the Port Authority, with epaulets across his blocky shoulders.   Kiri te Nawa, the Freyan rasped, his voice like the crushing of beans in her grinder.  You are here to be questioned in the death of Gral Roden.  Answer the questions truthfully.  If you are judged to be untruthful, you will be detained.  Do you understand?  Kiri nodded.  Although, did anything she said or did really matter? Shed lost her credit, her home and apparently her reputation in one day.  All that was left was for them to drag her off to jail.  Shed pinch herself to make sure this wasnt some bizarre nightmare, except that she could feel the cold of the monitor patch on her face, and she had to pee, so she must be awake.   First question.  Her attention jerked back to the holovid.  She was awake, all right.   The Freyan questioned her about every aspect of her argument with the dead gambler and then moved on to her activities of the evening and the night.   Kiri was too miserable to be more than fleetingly embarrassed about admitting that shed had dinner and then sex with a stranger.  She confessed every detail she could recall of meeting Stark, going to the restaurant and then to his penthouse with him for the night.  Fortunately the Freyan did not seem interested in what happened there, only that shed stayed the night and had not returned until this morning.   Finally, the Freyan turned to the Indigon, who sat quietly by the humming monitors.  He didnt seem to be paying much attention to them, just watching her with those eerie eyes.   He nodded once.  She speaks the truth.   Very well.  Release her.  The Freyans rock-like visage disappeared.   Kiri closed her eyes as they filled with sudden, hot tears.  She covered her eyes with her free hand, barely noticing as the Indigon removed the cuff and the monitors.   It is over.  Youre free to go.   Free to go.  That was a good one.  Go where? All she had left was her stand, and it was besieged with gawkers and news cameras.  Okay, she just had to think.  Shed let them gawk, but shed only answer questions to anyone who bought a coffee.  That would work.   She was fine, just fine.  Shed been alone before and gotten through.   Swiping her eyes with the back of her hand, Kiri slipped from the interrogation chair and followed the Indigon from the small room  In the passageway outside, he gestured toward a holovid display at one end.  Follow the signs, youll be out in a sec.   Kiri nodded.  She took a deep, shaky breath and continued along the passageway, only to stop as a female officer stepped out of a doorway.   Ms.  te Nawa? In here.  What now, were they going to issue a warning to stay out of trouble? Her face stiff with renewed humiliation, Kiri stepped into the small room.  The door shut behind her, leaving her facing the occupant.   She glared, resentment burning through her chill.  What are you doing here? Come to gloat?  Logan Stark rose from his chair.  Her hands fisted at her sides, nails digging into her palms.  How dare he look at her as if she were space trash, habitually in and out of jail.   Stay away from me.  Ive nothing to say to you.  You let them question me.  When you knew I wasnt herecouldnt have done it.   He looked startled, then his face hardened.  Kiri, this was the best way.   Thought he could intimidate her into believing him.  Kiri turned her back on him, ignoring her tears to reach blindly for the controls on the doorway.  Two strong hands closed on her arms, turning her back to him.   When she struggled, his grip tightened.  Kiri.  Listen to me.   She fought him.  No, let me go.   Stark pulled her hard against him.  When she kicked him on the shin, he shook her.   She glared at him.  You quarker.  Y-you wouldnt even speak up for me.  Thats all I wanted.  Instead you were on some business link.   Listen to me, he repeated and this time she froze, her gaze locked with his.  Of course I spoke up for you, little wildcat.  I wasnt on a business call; I was speaking with the captain.  I followed you here to the station, made a statement that you were with me the entire night.   Hed spoken for her? You did? Then why her lip trembled.  why did they question me like that?  His hand stroked up and down her back, warm and soothing.  Because if Id simply given you an alibi, youd have remained a suspect.  I may be a well-known businessman, but I wouldnt be the first man fooled by a beautiful woman, and the police know that.  Now that youve been questioned under the lie detector, they know for certain you had nothing to do with the Vulpeans deathor at least that you didnt kill him.   His words shocked her out of the warmth of knowing hed supported her.  What do you mean, at least I didnt kill him? You think I hired someone?  Its common enough.   She shoved at him and this time he let her go.  She gave him a scathing glare.  Oh, of course youd think that.  Because Im such a femme fatale, I have galaxies of males vying to do my dirty deeds, even though I cant pay them.   He gave her a wry look.  Look, we both know you could talk most menor womeninto doing what you want them to.  And dont tell me you dont know just how charming you are, because I wont believe you.  Youre an operator, Kiri te Nawa.   Kiris face flamed, and she fought his grip.  Let me go.  I dont have to stay here and listen to your sleazy insults.   His eyes narrowed, and as his grip tightened, Kiri froze.  In his own, urbane way, he was as forceful as that Freyan, his gaze nearly as penetrating as the Indigons.  And where will you go?  She lowered her gaze to his broad chest.  Ill go back to my coffee stand.  If they want to ask me questions, they can buy my coffee first.   I believe youd try it.  But youve no credit, no coffee and nowhere to sleep, he said.  And from the look of you, youve used up most of your emotional reserve.  Kiri, look at me.   When she finally did, her hands resting on his broad chest, his gaze was waiting, steady and certain.  Let me help you.  I wasnt insulting you when I called you an operator.  I know it isnt easy for a woman to make it alone in this city.   Her knees were trembling.  She locked them, and let go of him deliberately.  All right, but justjust until I get things settled.   He exhaled, pulling her against his side.  Good enough for now.  Come on.   His arm around her, Stark walked her along the corridor and out into the front hall, where they found Maury waiting, perched in a chair with her hovie-cart close at her side.  She hurried to hug Kiri, her lined face worried.   Oh my dear child, are you all right? You look . . .  well, they didnt use interrogation methods on you, did they? She pulled a disposable tissue from the depths of her capes and offered it to Kiri.   Kiri took it, wiping her wet face.  Not too bad.  Just some questioningan Indigon and a Freyan.   Maury straightened to exchange a look with Stark.  I see.  Well, I think you should go somewhere those news cameras cant find you.   She will, Stark promised.   Kiri found she didnt want to let Maury go.  Thank you.  She hugged Maury, thin under all her shawls.  Thank you for sticking by me.   Well, of course, Maury patted her back.  Youve stood by me, my dear.  Im only returning the favor.  But alls well that ends well, if you know what I mean.  She cast a significant look at the man behind Kiri.   Kiri grimaced.  Its not quite like that.   Perhaps, Maury said.  In any case, I must get on my rounds.  Goodbye.   She hurried away, hovie-cart following.  Leaving Kiri alone with Stark, who slid his arm around her again, as if she were his now.  Shes your friend?  I sell her souvenirs at my kiosk.  We look after each other.   Good.  Ready to go?  She shrugged.  Then, because he waited, she nodded.   There, he said, steering her back toward the hoverway.  That wasnt so hard, was it? Accepting my help.   Oh, Ive no doubt youll think of a way for me to repay you.   Of course, he agreed coolly.  Thats how I got where I am.   Kiri closed her eyes for a sec.  Yes, it had been a hellish day and a half, but she was snapping at his hand outstretched to help heragain.   Im sorry, she said.  That was petty.  I do appreciate your help.   He looked down at her, searching her face as if she were speaking in a foreign tongue without a translator.  I meant what I said, Kiri.  I do expect something from you in return.   What, free coffees for life?  He shook his head.  How could anyone as lovely as you possibly be so quarking blind?  Hey.  She wasnt sure if hed just complimented her, insulted her, or both.  She stopped in her tracks, pulling free of his arm.  Look, Stark, we both know Im not like the women you usually have  He gave her a look.  And how would you know that?  She waved a hand.  The kind of things they leave behind, for one thing.  Ive never owned underthings like that in my life, but if I did I certainly wouldnt forget them somewhere.   And besides, she went on, ignoring his smirk.  Youreyou, and Im me.  Were not exactly a matched set.  Unlike the undies.   His amusement disappeared.  He hadnt liked that, but it was the truth.   Be quiet.  Ignoring the travelers passing by, Stark backed her against the wall.  He held her there with the press of his much larger, harder body.  His warm hand cupped the side of her face, holding it turned up to his.  Kiri waited, her heart pounding with the suffocating excitement only he seemed to generate in her.   I want you, Kiri, he said baldly.  I want you in my bed and in my house.  I want to fuck you as often as I can.  I want you there to look at and perhaps even to talk to if youve anything intelligent to say other than that youre not worth my interest.  I want to dress you in lovely things chosen for you and then take them off of you, whenever, wherever and however I want.   He stared at her, his face taut.  Now do you understand me?  Mesmerized by the absolute determination in his gaze, she nodded.  He really did want her.  No man had ever wanted her for more than quick and dirty sex.  So this was how it felt.   He kissed her, hard.  His mouth closed over hers, hot and damp, his lips biting at hers, tasting and possessing them, demanding that she open to him.  His tongue swept into her mouth, tangling with hers, coaxing her to suckle it and then doing the same to hers.  She accepted it, reveled in it.  When he kissed her she could forget everything around her.   Finally the kiss gentled, and he lifted his head, just enough to look at her mouth, his thumb sweeping across her cheek to stroke between her wet lips.  She caressed it with her tongue, tasting him.  And would have done more right there, had he demanded it.   Soon, he promised, his gaze hot.  He straightened, his arm about her again, and propelled her back out into the busy concourse.  Now come along.   Kiri walked along with him, and on the hoverway, she leaned into him.  Not that she needed him to support her, but at least for however long this lasted, she wouldnt be alone.        9  Starks attendant didnt look too surprised to see Kiri.   Kiri dropped into the seat across from Stark on his cruiser.  He made sure her seat harness was fastened for takeoff and sat back in his own seat.   I do have one question, he said after a moment.  Why did you gamble more than you could afford?  None of your business.   He looked at her over his steepled hands.  It is.  If you have an addiction, I want to know before we become involved.  There are treatment programs.  But more than that, I will not tolerate that particular compulsion.   Her face burned.  He thought she was a total slummergambling, murder.  I dont have an addiction.  I told you Im good with numbers.  I used that to get my business going.  Also, I can see patterns, figure trends.  I started watching the display between customers.  After a while, I saw a pattern.  Did some figuring and made a few small wagers.  I won them all.   She rubbed her hands over the soft leather of the chair.  Then the fighting started to get really bad in my quadrant.  Been waiting to get flashbombed in my bed.  Or grabbed off the street by a slaver.  I decided to make one big wager and then have enough credit to get a better place, closer to the port.   Ah.  He nodded, and when she looked at him warily, she saw no judgment, only wry acceptance.  And the Vulpean saw you coming.   Little bastard changed the patterning, instead of finishing the set the way it would have played out organically.   His eyes narrowed.  You are good with numbers.  One of a thousand would pick up on a subtle pattern like that.   She let her head fall back on the chair.  For what good it does me.   He grunted in acknowledgement.  So in fact, your . . .  misfortunes have been cause and effect.  The fighting worsened, so you gambled.  The Vulpean was cheating his customers, so you lost and he was killed.   She stared at him.  But I didntoh.  You think he was killed by someone else he cheated yesterday.   Stark shrugged.  It is the answer that makes the most sense.   Well, I for one hope they never get caught, she muttered.   You may have your wish.  Security holovids from the back passageway are missing, according to the source I spoke with.   Really? That was more sophisticated than just a clout over the head from an enraged customer.  Kiri shuddered.   Organized crime was always slithering around the edges of the port, looking for merchants to strong-arm.  She had avoided the gangers attention herself by having so few profits she wasnt worth bothering with.  But she supposed the Vulpean had been worthy of their attentions.   She wondered if Tal was involved, and hoped not.  She didnt want to think a man shed been with was capable of murder, although he probably was if pushed.   She frowned at the dark, gloomy cityscape.  Where are we?  Headed south from the space port.   Kiri craned her neck to peer out the porthole nearest her.  A familiar tall, thin obelisk speared into the clouds.  Lights danced up and down its sides in an ever-changing display of colors and patterns.  Hey, theres the New Space Needle.  My apartment is near here.  Can we? She looked at him.   You know theres nothing left, he said quietly.   Kiri swallowed the hot lump in her throat.  I know.  But I need to see it.   He nodded.  Giles, fly over Astra quadrant.  When you reach Landing Ten, hover please.  And well want the belly cams.   Yes, sir.   The cruiser swung west.  Kiri gasped, grabbing the arms of her chair as a holovid opened before her.  It was as if her seat hung in midair, only drifting clouds and dirty fog between her and the rooftops of her old neighborhood.  She checked to make sure Stark was still across from her.  He was watching her, his face enigmatic.   Their flight slowed, and she looked down again.  There it was, the familiar tall, empty building on the corner, windows like empty eye-sockets.  And the odd yellow of the fastener factory.  But between them lay only a heap of blackened, twisted metal and fabrication, smoke still drifting in odd wisps from the depths.  The near wall of the factory had been scorched too, long black streaks contrasting with the garish yellow.   Streamers of pale blue substance lay draped over the rubble like ice shed seen on a holovid of Earth I.  Cryofoam.  No fire could withstand the intense cold and suffocation if enough of the foam could be sprayed from fire-fighting cruisers.  There was still one parked on the street, and she could see chartreuse-suited firefighters and police in red suits clustered on the ground.   Kiri drew a shaky breath and then another.  There was truly nothing left.  No way could anything of hers have survived that.  Not that shed had much.   Kiri, youre safe.  Thats all that matters. Stark said quietly.  Things can be replaced.   Not all of them, she whispered.   What did you lose that was so important to you?  She swallowed, hard.  I had a strongbox.  Cerametal, fire and waterproof.  Had some things in it.  Holovids.   Of your family.  No copies backed up anywhere?  No idea.  I dont know what servers my parents used, or if theyre even still up on the grid anywhere.   How old were you when they died?  It was a long time ago.  Can we go now, please?  Yes, Stark said.  Were going shopping.   She twisted to stare at him.  Shopping? she repeated blankly.  Uh, I dont really feel up for shopping.  More as if shed been put through a garbage recycler and hung out to dry.   You need something other than that to wear.  He flicked a look over her shabby smock and tights.   What about my coffee stand? she asked.  Although she wasnt sure the police would let her near it today.  Ugh, another day of lost business she couldnt make up.   That will wait til tomorrow, when the furor has died down.  Meanwhile, Im tired of looking at that smock.   She was tired of wearing it.  She wouldnt mind a comfortable knit outfit, like the tights, tanks and soft jackets she wore when she was off work.  She got them cheaply at a resale shop near the space port.  Occasionally there were pretty things, cast off by some well-to-do young woman her size.  But now her meager supply of clothing was gone, as well as everything else she owned.   A short trip to the discount marts would be a nice diversion.  She could do that.   She didnt realize shed spoken aloud until Stark replied.  I do not shop at the discount marts.  And while youre with me, neither do you.  Im taking you to Maitresse.   Kiri froze, a chill of new horror sweeping over her sweat-sticky skin.  No, she choked.  No, anything but that.         Stark didnt listen to her protests, even when she called him a quarking bully, her voice cracking with anger.   Instead, his cruiser landed atop a skyscraper crouched over the bay like a gleaming rampart, all cerametal and glass, and he stepped out of the cruiser, her wrist firmly manacled in his grasp.   When she tugged at his grip, he gave her a goading look.  After what youve been through, youre frightened by a clothing store?  This is not just a clothing store, she sputtered.  Itsits like the pinnacle of feminine apparelthe sun of clothing stores.  And Im in my old work clothes.   He chuckled.  Also, he did not let go until the cruiser had taken off and there was nowhere to go but inside.   When the glittering doors slid open at their approach, Stark finally let Kiri free her hand, but she stayed close by his side, her knees trembling all over again as he strode through the doors and into the hushed, rarified atmosphere of the most famous high-fashion house in New Seattle, perhaps in the whole country.   It was peopled by elegant, polite beings clad in the same cream hue of the walls and carpets who smiled respectfully as Stark walked in.   Kiri looked around in awe.  A different sort than that which had kept her quiescent at the port police station.  Shed been transported into a world shed scarcely dared to dream of.  One that smelled of exotic fragrances and held warmth that belied the damp chill outside.   Of course shed fantasized about being successful enough to shop at places like this, but she knew her current credit would not extend to even one of the lii silk scarves on a faceless model-bot gesturing gracefully from an alcove.  She also knew she looked like someone who could not afford to be here.   Quark Logan Stark.  Bringing her here when she was all grubby and sweaty, her face probably tearstained, and in her shabby work smock.  She wanted to scuttle off and hide behind one of the modelbots.  Only pride kept her head high.   This is totally out of my stratosphere, she whispered.   Stark stopped, as if they didnt have a room full of people waiting for them, and looked down at her.  Youll accept a gift from me, Kiri.  He looked as if he were willing to stand there all day, if necessary, until she agreed.   Stark, she tried again.  This is ridiculous.  This is not where people like me shop.  Much as it made her face burn to admit that here.   Kiri.  Do you really think it will be a hardship for me to give you a few pieces of well-made clothing?  Considering the place he lived and the cruiser he flew around in, no.  A cruiser which had left them here and would not be back until he summoned it, and his look said clearly that would not happen until he got his way.   She shook her head, resigned.   He slipped his hand behind the small of her back to tow her forward.   Haassea, he smiled warmly at the female in charge, a beautiful Serpentian with auburn hair sleeked back from her face.  This is Kiri Te Nawa.  Id like you to use your expertise to provide her with some new ensembles.   As Kiri tensed, he smoothed his hand down the curve of her ass, just enough to send a frisson of sensual awareness curling through her.  The man was a master at diversion.   Kiri, this is Haassea, a friend of mine.  Shell take good care of you.   The Serpentian eyed Kiri with an avaricious gleam.  I certainly will, Logan.  Shes quite lovely.   She also has excellent hearing.  Kiris cheeks were hotshe felt as out of place as a raven in a cage of Pangaean song birds.   Haassea raised her brows at this, but her sloe eyes twinkled.  Of course.  I beg your pardon, Kiri.  Its not often we have a client who will be such pleasure to work with.  Please come this way, and well find you some things you like.   Right.  Kiri knew when someone was laying on the sales pitch, but the woman was good at it, shed give her that.   Stark gave Kiri a little push, and she followed the Serpentian toward a doorway.  The woman didnt walk, she undulated with a sinuous grace that Kiri knew she couldnt emulate if she practiced for a year.   Inside a long room lined with doorways and mirrors, Haassea gestured Kiri regally to a settee.  A young Serpentian girl in a white smock poured her a cup of steaming tea.  There was a dish of dark squares on the tray as well.  They looked very intriguing.   Bring me gold and blush pink, Haassea said, waving the two young women who had followed them on their way.   I dont wear pink, Kiri said.  I like  gray.   Haassea shook her head chidingly.  No, no.  Thats his signature color.  We want you to stand out, to gleam like a pearl in the oyster.  Red, I think, but thats for later, once weve  buffed you a bit.   Kiri wasnt sure she wanted to be buffed.  I just need something else to wear, thats all.   Giving into temptation, she took one of the thin, dark squares and slipped it into her mouth.  Dark, rich flavor exploded on her tongue.  She nearly moaned.  Is this ?  Chocolate.  The Serpentian offered the dish to Kiri.  Lovely, isnt it?  Her mouth full again, Kiri nodded.   Chocolate was available only for those who could pay the astronomical prices.  She hadnt tasted it since she was a girl.  The flavor teased at her memory, a slim woman laughing as she handed Kiri a baked treat laced with tiny bits of chocolate.  Her mother.   She took another drink of hot tea, easing the constriction in her throat she always got when she thought about the happy times before.  Before what, she refused to think about.  Not now.  Oh, please, please not now.  She hadnt had a flashback at the port police authority, so why now?  Being herded through that police station, hands pushing her this way and that, voices echoing over her head while the explosions and cries echoed through her head, and their blood stained her skin and her clothing  What did you see? What did you hear? Do you know who did this? And the memories exploding in her mind, too much to bear, too much to speak of.   Her tea cup trembled in her hand.  With a supreme effort, Kiri brought herself back to the elegant shop.  She focused on the treats.  That chocolate wouldnt have been as dark as this, nor had the edge of pepper.  This was definitely an adult treat.  She hesitated and then grabbed another, not caring if she appeared greedy.   She closed her eyes as the chocolate melted in her mouth, the sweet richness coating her tongue, the fumes rising to fill her nostrils, consuming her senses, driving away the fear-sweat and the residue of hopelessness that hung around a police station.  Then she took another drink of tea.   When she peered warily at her hostess, the Serpentian was waiting with a slight, serene smile as if she had all the time in the world for a client who slipped off into a private black hole.  Kiri eyed her for clues, wondering how long shed been out this time.  She hadnt zoned out for a long time, not for over a year.   A hair cut, definitely.  Haassea mused, her soft voice breaking the silence.  Of course you havent time for our full spa treatment today, so well just do one or two nice things for you, hmm? Then you can try a few ensembles.   That sounded safe.  Do-able.  Nodding, Kiri finished her tea and rose to follow Haassea back into the mysterious depths of her domain.   I know what Stark likes, the woman added.   Kiri nearly stumbled.  Thats right, she was only one in a long line of women for him.  No one special, just an attractive face and body.   Didnt bother her, not a bit.  She was only here because her choices were limited to this or being at her kiosk.  Wasnt because she believed his fancy talk about how he wanted her so much.        10  Stark watched Kiri walk away and then turned to the slender Barillian who waited, her skull pipes shaded with same delicate rose hues as her eyes, to complement her lavender skin.  One of your private rooms, please.   Certainly, sir, she replied in a fluting voice, characteristic of her race.   He followed the young woman to a comfortable room with a desk, work station and a leather chairs, done in somewhat darker shades of Maitresses signature pale hues.   Coffee or tea, sir?  Coffee, black.  Stark sat down at the work station and used his comlink to bring up his private com network.   The Barillian brought him a tray with a carafe, mug and a plate of chocolates.   Thank you.  He chose one of the thin chocolates, knowing it would be his favorite, dark chocolate filled with strong mint.   It gave him a deep sense of satisfaction to bring his women here, not only to please them, but because he could.   He would never forget coming off shift from his first steady job in a cerametals factory, slaving all night in hellish din and heat and stink of chemicals.  He and his fellow laborers had emerged into an unusually clear morning.  Hed squinted up into the sunlight.  Far above the dirt and strife of the streets and factories, a skyscraper gleamed like a spire in the sky.   Hed sworn then that one day hed own one of those for himself.  He and his brothers would live in it, warm and clean, with more food than they could ever eat.  Perched high above all their fear and want like the ravens that perched on rooftops to croak their disdain at the humans toiling below.  The ravens were survivors.  So was he.   Hed done as he vowed.  Creed and Joran might not live in one of his high rises or shop in places like this, but they could if they chose to.  And so could his women.   Haassea and her staff had a way of pampering wealthy females of many planets while steering them toward purchases and services that promoted the boutiques reputation of bringing out a females best.  The owner didnt always take care of clients personally anymore.   He couldnt wait to see how she polished his sleek little cat.  She needed petting and pampering.  When she was escorted into the private room at the spaceport police headquarters, shed been a pale, hollow-eyed shell of the vibrant woman hed met the day before.   Hardly surprising.  A lesser woman would have crumbled under such sustained battering.  He shook his head, chuckling at the memory of her plan to face down the media and the curious, and demand they pay for access to her.  Shed no doubt have done it, too.   Kiri was a fighter and he respected her for it.  He had no use for the weak, men or women.  Children, he used his power to protect, and those adults who were willing to work.  Anyone who sat and whined about how they must be taken care of, he ignored.  Hed begun to build his empire when he was only fifteen years old; others could work for at least their own survival.   The door hissed open, and Haassea sauntered in.   Logan.  She smiled at him.  Stark smiled back as he crossed the room to her.   He bent to kiss her cheek, and she returned the greeting, her musky perfume slithering through his senses.  She slipped her arm through his, pressing her soft breasts against him.   Do you have everything you need?  Yes, as usual your staff is taking very good care of me.  Stark stepped back, reaching for his coffee.  As they will Kiri, Im sure.   Thats because you take such good care of us, she teased gently.   That was the simple truth.  Not only did he bring all his women here to shop, he had helped Haassea secure the loan to open this place.   Shes not your usual type, Logan.  Her searching gaze belied her soft voice.   He shrugged.  Perhaps it was time for a change.   Hmm.  Dont change too much.  Wed miss you.   He gave her a look.  You, perhaps.  Not sure your husband would.   She gave him back look for look.  Traay knows you and I have a long history.  And that I would never give you up.   He may have come from wealth, but hes still a man, Haassea.   She merely smiled, in serene acceptance that she was worth her husbands possessiveness.   Stark smiled back.  Ill see you and Traay at the Port Commissioners Ball.   She smiled. Really? Good.  Last years ball was a very  satisfying affair.   I remember.  The Ball might have a respectable title, but the elite of New Seattle knew better.  Held at the citys largest casino, it was an evening of unbridled revelry for the influential and wealthy, a celebration of another year survived in a harsh world.  Stark had attended with a woman whose name he couldnt even recall.   Perhaps we can have dinner together, Haassea suggested.   Stark nodded.  We will.   Starks comlink chimed, and he raised his brows.  And now, if youll excuse me, that will be business.   Of course, Haassea said easily.  Ill leave you to it.   She swept out, and Stark opened the hololink.  It was from his executive assistant, reminding him of a routine cyber-meeting that afternoon.  Stark thanked her and brought up the galactic web.   He could have gone to LodeStar headquarters at the space port, or back to the office in his penthouse, and had Giles deliver Kiri when she was done here, but he preferred to wait.  He wasnt entirely sure she wouldnt bolt, he admitted wryly to himself as he sipped the strong, hot coffee.   He spent some time going through the reports of the last day.  The oasis resort on Serpentia was progressing well.  Pirates had been sighted near Creeds mining operation on Frontiera, but thanks to the new sat-com system, Creed and his security people knew and would keep them at bay.  Like Logan, he hired the best and paid them well.   Stark hadnt checked in for a few days with the captain of the Orion, the flagship of his new space cruise line.  After the recent barrage of deadly sabotage attempts on her, everyone in LodeStar Corporation was on their guard.   He used his comlink to signal her.   Captain Steve Craig answered immediately.  His head and broad shoulders, silver gray flight suit crowned with the bars and stars of his office, filled the holovid screen, backed by the Orions command deck and two crewmen working quietly.  Close-cropped hair shone silver-blond in the lights.  His eyes, under heavy brows, were piercing light blue.  He smiled a greeting.  Logan, good to see you.   Hello, Steve, how are you?  Very well.  A quiet flight so far.  They exchanged a look of hard-won satisfaction.  Orions first four voyages had been fraught with danger, to the point that Stark and his crew commanders wondered if LodeStar would have to abandon the cruise line.   We had a bit of a problem at launch, Craig went on.  Two stowaways, but that was easily dealt with.  Theyre in IGSF custody now.   Really? Stark frowned.  Thats a new one.  With all our surveillance equipment, how did they think theyd remain undiscovered?  Theyll try anything, I guess.  They were in shipping containers, with an air supply to last until we were underway.  The interesting thing is, theyre both ex-soldiers, fighting men, who claim they have no idea how they ended up on the ship.   Ill want to hear the reports after the IGSF has questioned them, Stark said.  Anything else?  No.  These settlers are a good lot, focused on getting to their new home.   Not a party crowd?  Oh, the lounges are doing a brisk business, but were selling more ale than anything else, and the dances are more likely to be group jigs than a tango.   Orion, her crew and three hundred twenty-two passengers, mainly Earth II working-class folk looking for opportunity, were bound for Frontiera.  The verdant, Earth-like planet had only recently been discovered by the Alliance planets.  Home to a few nomadic tribes as well as small groups of settled beings in her tropical regions, the planet was ripe for conquest.  Pangaeans, Serpentians and humans were racing to stake claims on her.  So were space pirates.   Stark and a consortium of business partners were making sure they captured their share of available land and business opportunities.  Theyd just finished installing a system that blanketed the planet in satellite communications, making it light-years more difficult for pirates to isolate and pillage remote outposts as theyd been in the habit of doing.   Youll be picking up some additional passengers on Bryght, I see.   Yes.  Craig grinned.  Commander Panthar has convinced several of his ex-IGSF mates to emigrate with him.   Well, Bryghts a small planet, Stark mused.  Only room for so many Tygers.   They do need plenty of space to roam, especially when their mating moons are on the rise.   They both chuckled.  On Orions maiden flight, shed been held up by customs on Earth II.  By the time she approached planet Bryght, days later than scheduled, her Tyger navigator Tryon Jag had been drawn helplessly into the influence of his mating moons.  Hed morphed into a dangerous half-man, half-cat, terrifying most of the crew and demanding a mate.   Hed gotten one and managed to save his ship from being dashed on the dangerous asteroids of the Cattarus system, but Jags company, which still held the navigation contract for LodeStar, now maintained backup navigators as a failsafe, on Starks demand.   If, as Stark suspected, Kiri te Nawa had Tyger blood, his wild ride with her was only beginning.   Hows Tessa? Stark asked.  Is she with you on this flight?  Craigs face softened at the mention of his lovely half-Serpentian bride, a member of the ships guard.  Shes well, thank you.  Were going to spend a few days on Frontiera, take a look around while were there.   Ah.  If you make it out to New Haven, look up Stone Masterson and his wife.  Business partner of minehed be glad to host you and Tessa.   Thank you.  We may do that.  Dont you have a brother near there as well? Craig asked.   Creed has a mining claim in a valley a few clicks from Adamant.  Something of a loner.  Im his silent partner.   Craig nodded in comprehension.  Frontiera was a good place for beings who preferred solitude.   Ive another brother on planet, as well, Stark added.  Joran lives with one of the nomadic tribes.  He led one, actually, but that information was not to be shared.  Nor was their unique method of making a living.   Something, a change in the atmosphere of the small room, a certain look of surprise and dawning admiration in Craigs expression made Stark turn his head.   Kiri stood a short distance behind him.  She had her head tipped down, regarding him through her dark lashes, her full lips pursed in a bashful smile.   Her rounded hips and slender, curving legs were showcased in a pair of fitted tights of dull gold, her upper body in a tank of the same shade that appeared to be spun loosely of blossoms and spider webs, her skin shimmering through the weave.  The only thing that prevented the ensemble from being unfit for other eyes than his was the tiny soft sweater hugging her shoulders, arms and breasts, falling short of her slender waist.  It was the pale hue of blush rose petals.  She wore a matching pair of flats.   Later, sir, said Craig behind him.   Yes, said Stark without looking away from her.  Thank you, Captain.   Rising, Stark crossed the room to Kiri.  He crooked one finger underneath her chin and tipped up her head to admire her.  Theyd cut her hair.  Instead of waving wildly, it cupped her well-shaped head and framed her face in dark, silky tendrils, exposing the lower part of her shell-like ears.  Hed buy her earrings, he thought absently, to go with that jeweled collar he planned.   He gazed down into her face.  The same, but enhanced with subtle cosmetics, her eyes glowing in their dark lashes and smoky shadows.  Her moist, plump lips bore a coating of rosy gloss that made them somehow more intimate, like another, private part of her.   She looked refreshed.  The pampering had done her good.   Her winged brows rose.  Well? Youre staring at me as if Ive grown a third eye or something.   Stark chuckled, amusement and arousal blending in a heady mix.  Like an Occulan? No.  You are  luminescent.  He set his hands on her hips, enjoying the feel of her through the thin, soft fabric.   Like a pearl?  It was his turn to arch an inquiring brow.   She chuckled, a husky, sound that cracked in the middle.  Haassea said I must glow like a pearl in the oyster of your signature gray.  I certainly hope you think I do, because she insisted that I couldnt walk out of here without at least two ensembles and a wrap.  There are bags of things.  She widened her eyes at him, miming consternation.  She just kept adding things.   Stark pulled her closer, inhaling her scent.  Just a hint of some sweet, sensual fragrance that made him want to bury his nose in the curve of her throat and chase it to the source.  Haassea had chosen well.   I told her to go on adding things.  I particularly want to see what you chose to wear to bed.   She gave him a look that indicated she was worried about his sanity.  Logan, you have an entire closet full of womens nightwear at your place.   Ah, yes, shed mentioned there were a few things in the room he kept for female guests.  Saving my credit for me? He lifted one of her hands to kiss the inside of her wrist.   She watched, her lips parting.  Not used to the more refined caresses, evidently.  Good, hed know how to keep her off-balance.  He preferred her that way.   Hmm? she murmured, finally.  Well, yes, of course.  Wouldnt want you to waste credit.  She gave him a guileless look, and he had to bite back a chuckle.   You dont have to worry about the cost of things, little cat.  While I appreciate your care for my credit, it isnt necessary.   Of course its necessary, she began.   The door of the room opened, and he looked up with a scowl, ready to speak sharply to whoever had interrupted them.   But it was Haasseas prime assistant, Slidi, a slim redheaded Serpentian with full breasts and a smile that was surprisingly sweet for a Serpentian.   Oh, Mr.  Stark, she said, stopping in the doorway.  Im so sorry to interrupt.   Since her eyes were wide with contrition, he nodded politely.  Thats all right.  We were just going.   Of course.  Haassea is with another client.  II have a gift for you, sir.  The young woman held out a small package, wrapped in shimmering ribbon.  She handed it to Stark with a smile.  Your favorite chocolate.   He bowed.  Thank you.   She dimpled.  My pleasure.  Ive scheduled Ms.  te Nawa for a full spa day tomorrow, if thats convenient.   It will be, he assured her.        11  Kiri glared at the Serpentians back.  She had not liked the way the woman looked at Stark, as if she wanted to slither all over him and devour him.   But, she was the one leaving with him.  She walked with Logan out to the docking bay, followed by two young men laden with bags.  She settled back in the chair beside him with a groan, her eyes closing.   I feel as if Ill wake up any moment now, back in my coffee stand, or my apartment.   About your coffee stand, he said.  Id like to call in an employment agency, find you some help.   She opened her eyes, instantly wary.  What? I run that standits mine.  And I dont have time for any spa day tomorrow.  Thanks for the haircut and clothes, but thats more than enough.  I could do a lot of other things with the amount of credit you just spent on me.   So she did want credit.  Hed want details on that, later.  Kiris Kaffe is going to be overrun with gawkers and gossip runners the next several days.  Let me find you someone else to handle that for you.  Then when curiosity has worn off, you can return.   I run my business, she insisted.   Ignoring Opal, who sat quietly on the other side of the cabin, Stark flipped up the armrests between them, took Kiris hand and tugged her across the smooth leather.  He wanted her close where he could hold her hand in his and admire the silky texture of her skin and hair, even catch more of her intriguing scent.   Youll need an assistant eventually anyway.   Why?  He smiled at the suspicious look in her golden eyes.  Was she imagining him stealing her tiny business, or simply demanding her sexual favors day and night? Not a bad idea, actually.  For example, right now hed very much enjoy having her remove that little top so he could admire her pearly skin through the loose weave of her camisole.  Then hed pull her onto his lap and peel those leggings off.  His cock hardened at the notion of having her here.   But his little cat wasnt ready.  She shifted uneasily, her rounded thighs pressing together.  Im not abandoning all Ive worked for to be your plaything.  I can do both.   He looked up into her eyes.  He saw suspicion, but he also saw arousal there and in the pout of those soft, slick lips.  Of course you wont abandon your business, which is why you need help.  I travel a great deal, and I cant work around your schedule.  While youre with me, youll have to work around mine.   Then he slipped his arm around her, pulling her close so he could tip up her chin with his other hand.  He bent his head to nuzzle her temple, inhaling her fragrance, enjoying the silky hair and skin brushing his nose and face.   I cant think when you do that, she muttered, leaning against him.  Possessiveness surged as she turned into his touch, not away.  One day soon, he would have her here, in this seat.   Good.  Dont think.  With a swift, decisive movement, he pulled her up across his thighs.  Then he tipped his head to one side and kissed her.  Her moist lips parted under his, and he delved into the peppery sweetness of her mouth.  He flicked his tongue inside.  To his supreme delight, her hand tightened on his arm, and she sucked on the tip of his tongue.   When he lifted his head, they were both breathing hard, and Opal had discreetly disappeared.   Kiri stroked her hand over his chest and under the edge of his open jacket, her eyes heavy.  You do that . . .  well, she said.  It sounded more like a complaint than a compliment.   He smiled, enjoying the feel of her in his arms and the knowledge that she would be there frequently from now on.  Do I? Perhaps you inspire me.   Perhaps youve had too much practice, she shot back.  When he stilled, she flushed, her gaze skittering away.   I meant at getting your own way, she said quickly, pushing herself away.  What youve done in the pastwith other womenis certainly none of my affair.   No.  He let her go, knowing it wasnt wise to hold her when he was angry.  Nor is what youve done any of mine.  But while youre with me, there will be no other men, or women, unless I say so.  Are we clear on that?  She plopped into the seat across from him, disgruntled as a cat that had been stroked the wrong way.  Are you sure about this? she opened her hands, gesturing vaguely.  This whatever it is you envision between us?  A liaison, he put in smoothly.   Oh, very high-class term for fucking, she shot back and then blushed, her gaze falling away from his as he raised his brows at her.  And thats just what I mean.  Youre used to . . .  expensive females who know how to dress andand undress.  Im just a barista.  I dont want to expect more if youre going to get tired of me in three days.   House calls your bluff.   She stared at him.  What?  He raised an eyebrow at her.  I can see your markers, Ms.  te Nawa, and they dont match your bet.  Youre trying to color yourself as a poor slummer, when in fact you were raised as a lady.   She drew her knees up on the seat and wrapped her arms around them, eyeing him suspiciously over her knees.  How do you know that?  He smiled.  She didnt trouble to deny it, at least.  Ive had several meals and sex with you.  That was more than enough.  When youre not losing your temper like a Tyger kitten, youve lovely manners.   She scowled.  If she had a tail, it would be lashing.  Interesting, that she wished to hide her gentle upbringing.  Was she a runaway, either from autocratic parents or an abusive partner?  Listen, where I live it doesnt pay to put on a show.  I may not be a slummer, but neither am I a courtesan.   Shed find he was a bit harder than that to throw off track.  He smiled at her.  Kitten, if I want a courtesan, I know where to find one.  Everything I wish you to know about my sexual preferences, I will very much enjoy teaching you.   Her golden eyes widened.  He had no doubt that if they were anywhere but in midair, shed bolt.  And that hed run her down.  He was as aroused and edgy as a wild male beast himself.  Oh, no, she wasnt getting away.   Ive a business to run, remember.   So train an employee.  Great God beyond.  He was ready to flashbomb her coffee stand himself, just to get her mind off of it.   Perhaps hed punish her just a bit for making him wait.  The thought of her luscious ass reddened from his hard palm amused him, allowed him to watch her frown with renewed equanimity.  Later, when shed lost that fragile look, as if one harsh word or loud noise would have her clawing at the hull to escape.   I dont know if I want someone else running my stand.  And how am I going to pay them? I barely have enough credit to buy next weeks coffee.  And yes, I know its my own fault.  Sometimes I take foolish chances.  The look she gave him from under her lashes left no doubt that she considered him one of them.   Logan laid one arm across the back of her empty chair.  He sighed.  Ill compromise.  You may have a week to train someone.  And because Ive insisted you hire someone, Ill pay their wages.  And later hed move her shop to a safer, more lucrative location.   Her eyes widened.  She smoothed her hands over her knees.  Okay.   Because disbelief colored the word, he soothed her.  I want to know you better, Kiri.  I understand you feel rushed, but the chaotic nature of our relations so far stems from your life, not mine.   Heythe riots arent my fault.   Of course not.  But you were living in that area by choice.  And you gambled by choice.  There are consequences for all our actions.   So youve never gambled? she retorted.   Of course I have.  Business is one big gamble.  The difference between you and me is simply that Ive won many more times than Ive lost.  And I dont waste my credit on gamesI save it for real opportunities.  He softened his voice.  Im not judging you, kitten.  I told you, Ive been where you are.  Im simply stating facts.   Ill need at least two weeks, she said, watching him.  And a loan.  As long as Im going to have your help, I want to buy better coffee and other supplies for my stand.  You can have one of your accountants do a contract.   Done.  He regarded her with satisfaction.  Ill be leaving tomorrow, traveling to New Asia.  Whether Im here or gone, I want you at my penthouse.  One of my men will take you to work and anywhere else you need to go.   Starry, she murmured, her eyes dazed.  Who, this guy?  Stark shook his head.  Giles and Opal travel with me.  I keep the floor of apartments just below the penthouse for my staff.  Natan, my chef and housekeeper lives there, and Ill have the pilot bunk there as well.  Ill assign Rak to you.  Hes old enough not to be beguiled into any mischief even by a lovely wild cat.   She slid down in her chair, shoving at his knee with her slippered toe.  He caught her foot easily in his hand and held her there, chuckling at her childish gesture.  She stared at him, a smile dawning on her face.   What?  Ive never heard you laugh, she said.  I like it.   Stark leaned forward and caught her by the waist, pulling her forward and onto his lap, so she straddled him.  Youll like what Im going to do with you when I get you back to my bed, too, he said into her ear.   She shivered.  Maybe.   But this time she kissed him, tasting his lips with hers, teasing him with their plush sweetness.  Her slender arms slid around his neck, and her soft breasts pressed against his chest.  He filled his hands with her firm, round ass and kissed her.   With her soft heat so close, his cock reacted swiftly and predictably, stiffening demandingly.  He rocked into the soft notch between her thighs.  The moment I get you inside, he said against her mouth, I want you to walk into my bedroom, and wait for me there.  Understood?  She moved her face against his, inhaling.  Taking in his scent.  Good, he wanted to imprint himself on her, so shed know him in the dark, or blindfolded and bound, know him from any other man who touched her.   Is this the beginning of you . . .  teaching me? she whispered, her breath tickling his face.   His cock stiffened even further, and arousal roared up through him.  Quark, it was going to be so intensely sweet to mold her.  Yes, kitten.  Its the beginning.   Dont know where your room is.  She rubbed subtly against his cock, stroking him even hotter.  She was shivering, despite her attempt to be as calm as he.   Next to the room where you stayed last night.  From now on, when Im there, youll be in my bed.   Yes, sir.   He spanked her bottom, a sharp little smack that made her jump against him.  It also, strangely, sent an odd little thrill through her.   Yes, Logan will do very well.  And now weve landed.   She slipped to her feet, looking self-consciously toward the open hatch.  But Opal, ever discreet, had disappeared once she ascertained the craft was docked safely.   Go on.  Stark gave Kiri a gentle push.  Ill be a few secs.  I want to talk to Giles.   He wantedneededto get his arousal under control before he pinned her against the bulkhead and fucked her right here.   He didnt mind an audience, but not his employees.        12  Aroused, uncertain and shaken, Kiri walked through the podway and into Starks plush penthouse.  Quiet settled around her, the hush of seclusion that only wealth could buy.  The place even smelled of moneyso clean, with some faint echo of flowers or something.  She hadnt spent much time around live plants, but she thought she remembered how they smelled.   She much preferred it to the heavy perfume of Maitresse.  Not to mention those women tripping themselves to be the one to assist Stark.  She didnt like the way Haassea looked at him, or that other oneSlidi.  Oh, sorry to disturb you, Mr.  Stark, she mimicked under her breath.  More like Oh, take me instead of her, Mr.  Stark.   But she was the one who was here, so shed deal with her nerves.  She wanted more of what hed given her in the night before.  She wanted him to hold her in his arms, and help her forget her forced visit to the port police headquarters and everything else, just for a little while.   She half-expected someone to step out and demand to know who she was and what she was doing there.  But although she could hear activity from the closed doors beyond the sleek expanse of an ebony dining table, no one accosted her as she walked across the sitting room and turned into the short, wide hallway.   Starks bedroom was larger than the one shed stayed in the night before, but even this large room was dominated by the expanse of a huge bed covered in dark, silky pewter and mounded with luxe cushions.  The walls were gray as well, the fitments silvery cerametal.  And it smelled clean, too, but faintly of him.  Of that lotion he used.   Walking over to the bed, Kiri traced her fingertips along the plush coverlet.  It was soft against her skin.  Velvet.  Probably spun from lii silk bugs on Pangaea, or some such.  A customer had laid her jacket across Kiris counter once, and Kiri had picked it up to hand it back.  It had felt like this.   At a sound behind her, she turned.  Logan stepped into the room, and the wide doors slid shut behind him, enclosing them in this room that was meant for sleep and sex.   He regarded her, his eyes hooded in the look that now sent a shiver of heat straight down into her pussy and made her legs feel weak, as if she wanted to fall at his feet.  Which she did not do, even when she was reeling the way she was today.   You are indeed a pearl in my oyster, he said, his voice deep and soft.  I am fortunate to be the man who found you, Kiri te Nawa.   He tossed something on the bed beside her, and she looked down.  A twisted length of soft cord lay there.  Her heart skipped a beat, and she side-stepped away from the thing.  Whats that?  Soft restraints.   Alarm sent her heart leaping higher against her ribs.  He was unfastening his jacket with slow deliberation, watching her.   She shook her head, lifting one foot onto the bed and sliding back onto it, her fingertips bracing her on the bed.  I told you, nothing t-twisty.   He shrugged off his jacket, tossing it onto a leather bench, and began to unfasten his shirt.   She indicated the restraints.  Thats twisty.   He pulled his shirt off, and she stared, caught by the sight of his powerful shoulders and arms, his broad chest and hard abdomen, ridged with muscle.  Dont you trust me? he asked, casually as if he were asking her what shed like to drink.   She looked up into his eyes, heated now like molten silver.  He was the most irritating, stubborn, single-minded man shed ever met.  Well, pretty much, or I wouldnt be here, would I?  He shoved his pants down over his lean, hard hips, baring the flatness of his groin and the two deep grooves that arrowed down toward his cock, as it sprang up out of his slacks with arrogant beauty, rampant.  He stepped out of his pants and stalked toward her, naked and ready.   Perhaps you like an edge of danger with your sex.  Some women do.   She shook her head in a silent denial.  He smiled slightly, just with his eyes.   What? she snapped.   He lifted her chin on the edge of his finger and looked down into her face.  His was taut, his nostrils flared as if he were scenting her, breathing her in, his chosen female.   I dont believe you, he said softly.  You pit yourself against dangers of every kindwith your business, your gamble, even where you choose to live.   Thats different, she whispered.  Her body responded helplessly to him with a trembling deep inside her.  She wanted to sway against him, rub herself on his heat and splendor.  Beg him without words to take her, assuage the throbbing in her pussy.   Is it? Say my name, he commanded softly.   Logan.   His hand framed her face, caressing her cheek and the side of her jaw.  She turned her face into his hand, craving his touch.  Do you want me, Kiri?  She nodded.  His hand tightened, just a little.  Say it.   Yes, Logan.  I want you.  She did, damn him.  She craved him.  She wanted him to lay her back on the bed now and slide deep inside her.  She just didnt want to be tied up while he did it.   Good.  Then let me undress you, little cat, so I can please you.  He slid his hands down over her shoulders, taking the sweater with them.  Kiri let it drop behind her and then lifted her arms above her head, so he could pull the tank up.   The thin fabric slid up and away, baring her to him.  When it reached her wrists, he tugged gently, twisting the fabric so her hands were trapped.  She knelt there with her arms bound over her head, half nude, her breasts jutting out at him, and peeped up at him.  The look in his eyes, the feel of him holding her there to look at made her quiver with a deep, guilty pleasure.   Maybe  maybe it would be kind of hot to be tied up, for this.  But she bit her lip, holding back any incautious words.  Was she as twisty as those restraints to enjoy this? She knew there were clubs where people did this as well as acts a whole lot twistier, but shed never been interested.   He smiled slowly and cupped his free hand over her breast, fondling it with slow care, and then squeezing her nipple between his thumb and forefinger.  She wished he could do that all night.   Youre beautiful like this, he told her.  Many would kill to have you.  His warm, powerful hand moved to her other breast, cupping it.  And when I look at you like this, Id kill to keep you for myself.   She let her head fall against her arm, intoxicated by his voice and his words.  She was ready to dissolve in a heap on the bed, open for anything he wanted to do to her.   Now do you understand, kitten? He curved his hand around her throat, tipping her face up to his as he bent to kiss her.  She kissed him back, opening her mouth to him, and drinking in his taste, his touch.  Her pussy was throbbing in time with her thundering heart, so that she pressed her thighs together, seeking relief.   II dont know.  That kind of intensity wasnt for her  was it? She wanted pleasure, sure, but she wanted to be pampered and held, the way he had last night.   He studied her, and she resisted the urge to pull away, run from him.  But she quivered in his grasp.  Something in his heated silver gaze called to her to leap and let him catch her.  But would he? Or would she end up hanging by her fingertips while he took his pleasure at her expense?  Youre not ready for that.  He drew the tank away, freeing her, and she lowered her arms, watching him.  Not yet.   Not yet? Did that mean he meant to keep pushing? Was that part of what he planned to teach her? What would you want to do, anyway? she asked.  If I let you, um, tie me up? And why did her pussy clench harder just thinking about it?  Its all right, he murmured, his hands on her waist, warm and powerful.  Stay in the moment, kitten.  I dont want you helpless; I want you to submit to me.  Theres a difference.  For now, take your tights off for me.   She slid off the bed, hooked her fingers in the soft waist band, pushing the tights down and off her hips and thighs.  She drew one leg up and then the other, stepping out of the tights as he watched.  Baring herself to him.   Come to the edge of the bed, he urged, sinking to his knees between her feet.  Thats right.  Now open your legs for me.  Yes, very pretty.   She sat there, her legs spread wide, feet braced on her tiptoes, pleasure and need gathering beneath his gaze as he looked at her mons.  His gaze was hot, like a heat lamp directed on her bare flesh.  She wanted him to go on looking at her until she melted just from that.   He stroked her thighs, his thumbs tracing the curls between her thighs.  Youre very wet.   He looked up into her eyes and stroked a fingertip up through her swollen, wet labia.  He dipped it carefully inside and then back out again.  Her pussy released his finger with a succulent sound, and he smiled.  Now youll come for me, wont you, kitten?  Yes.  She was going to come all by herself in a sec.  When he stroked his broad fingertip over her clitoris, she whimpered, a small feminine sound of need.   Look at me, he ordered when her eyes slipped shut.  She dragged them open and gazed into his beautiful eyes as he stroked her clitoris, his touch wet and silken and perfect, until she was following his touch, jerking her hips into his touch.  She came, her pussy rippling with intense pleasure.   Logan.  She was drowning in that molten gaze.   He bent and kissed her, hard, his tongue sweeping into her mouth to claim her.  She kissed him back, sinking into the taste and wet heat of his mouth, loving the warmth of his hands on her, holding her safe as she came down from her swift release.  She leaned into him, her hands curling on the hard warmth of his bare shoulders, luxuriating in the chance to hold him.  She was sliding them around his neck when he moved away.  She protested wordlessly, forcing her heavy eyes open.   Stark stood before her, and Kiri looked up at him, at his face taut with desire, his cock standing up before her, rigid and flushed.  He flexed his hips, moving it toward her.  Then he pressed gently on her shoulders.   Will you let me take your mouth? he asked.   She let her gaze slide down over the power and beauty of his broad chest, with the curling mat of hair that arrowed down across his hard abdomen to flare again into a mat of dark curls around the base of his cock, and the heavy balls that were drawn tight beneath.  She reached out to touch it gently, examining him with her fingertips and her gaze.  Long and thick, dark with blood, a single drop of arousal glistening on the broad head.  Hot and silky under her touch, it twitched demandingly as she curled her fingers around it, and stroked up.   Sucking in a hard breath, he pushed himself into her grasp, and his hands tightened on her shoulders.  Your mouth, little cat.   Without a word, she slipped to her knees before him, her hands resting delicately on his hard thighs, dusted with fine hair.  Shed done this a few times and kind of enjoyed it as a warm-up, as long as he didnt try to shove it down her throat or expect to come in her mouth.   He touched her face tenderly.  Youre beautiful right now, he said.   She looked up at him from under her lashes.  She might be on her knees before him, but she held the power now, in this instant.  So are you.   His cock jerked, straining toward her.  He groaned.  Now, please.  Shifting closer, he touched her face, guiding her so that the velvet head of his cock nudged her lips.  She smoothed her hands down his thighs, cupping the back of his legs, hard and powerful under his warm skin.   He smelled so good.  She could drown in his scent, musky and clean with that faint edge of some wild forest.  He tasted faintly of saltthe glistening drop of arousal that she licked from the tender slit.  He pressed further, and she opened her mouth, taking him further in.  He filled her mouth, a hot, firm, velvet rod of flesh, male incarnate.   Again, he urged, his voice rough.  Ah, you have no idea how lovely you look.  Another time Illbut that will wait.   Another time, what? She hesitated, jolted out of her haze of pleasure  He withdrew a little and then thrust back into her mouth.  Look at me, he urged.  He looked down into her eyes as he thrust again and again, fucking her mouth.  She curled her tongue, caressing him with it each time he withdrew.   Its good, isnt it, little cat?  She nodded as best she could with her mouth full, surprised to find she meant it.  She liked doing this for him.   He withdrew with clear regret.  That was very good, he told her, lifting her up with his hands on her waist.  But now, I need to be inside your tight little cunt.   He kissed her deeply, cupping her mons with one hand and swallowing her hoarse whimper of eagerness at the thought of having him inside her again.  Are you ready for me?  Yes, Logan.   He thrust two fingers up inside her, his breath hissing in sharply as she contracted around his fingers.  Yes, I do believe you are.  Id like to take you from behind.   Okay.  She liked thatit meant she could touch herself and get off faster.   Such eagerness.   He guided her to climb onto the bed and lie on her stomach.  He tucked one of the fat cushions under her hips, so that her ass was tilted into the air, her arms braced before her.   This was a little weird.  She felt at once admired and exposed.  The bed shifted as he moved off of the bed and then came back again.  He trailed his fingertips through her wetness, pushing her legs wider apart.  Something warm dripped down the crevice of her ass, trickling over her labia.   Is that what you used last night? she asked, twisting to look at him over her shoulder.   He knelt between her thighs, looking down at her.  Mm, yes it is, he said.  Now, Im going to use it on your pretty little ass, kitten.  Hold still for me, thats right.   Kiri flinched as she felt his slick finger massaging the gesic into the tight ring of muscle.  I dont really like being touched there.   Are you sure about that? He leaned over her, bending his head to kiss a soft line up her back while he continued to stroke her.   Well, of course she was sure, or she wouldnt have said so.  But then the warm tingling seemed to dart inside her, and she gasped.  He made a sound of approval.   I believe youre ready for a very, very small toy.   A what? Kiri stiffened.  Youre not shoving some mechanical in me.   He smacked her bottom with the flat of his hand.  The sting distracted heralmostfrom the soft heat of something pushing inside her ass.  Of course not.  This is just a soft plug.   Too small and soft to be his finger, slicked with the gesic, and already tingling and heating her untried flesh.  It was a soft cylinder of some kind.  Strange, as if he were invading her everywhere.  She writhed, wanting to get away from it and yet wanting to push back against it at the same time.  She gripped the soft coverlet, moving restlessly.   Shh, just stay still for a moment, kitten.  Im putting one in myself as well.  It will increase the sensation when we fuck.   He was using one on himself? Kiri had to admit that the sensation of the soft plug coated with the gesic inside her ass was very  stimulating.  It was like him, maddening and beguiling at the same time.   Logan bent, spooning his body over hers, one hand sliding under her belly to cup her mons, surrounding her with heat and strength.  He nipped at her ear and then rimmed it with his tongue, teasing her there as he stroked her labia with his fingers.   She arched up against him, then retreated, struggling to deal with the onslaught of sensations as the move pressed the plug more firmly into her ass.   He rimmed her pussy with his fingers, spreading the gesic inside her and out, until she was throbbing with excitement.  He stroked her clitoris, and she whimpered, the soft, high sound cutting through the quiet room.   Do you need to be fucked, Kiri? His voice was deep velvet in her ear, beguiling her.   Yes.  She needed him to finish what hed begun, help her surrender to the dark, sweet flames hed kindled in her.  She pressed up into his touch, her fingers twisting in the coverlet.   How do you want it, kitten? Hard?  Yes, hard.   He reared up behind her, and Kiri moaned as she felt his shaft, hot and blunt and impossibly big, press into her swollen pussy.  The pressure increased the sensation of the soft plug in her ass, until she could scarcely bear the overload of sensation.   He grasped her hips with his hands and began to thrust.  Stretching her to the limits, his cock raked the walls of her pussy and landed against the perfect spot deep inside her.  Hot, she was so hot.  And she needed  ah, yes, this.  His cock pounding inside her, his hands holding her for his swift lunges, his groin smacking her ass with each hard thrust.   His, she was his, her most private places full of him and his desire.  All she had to do was accept what he gave her, and she was safe.  Safe to unfurl her claws and be wild.   The dark pleasure built and built until it imploded inside her pussy and surged outward, through her ass, through her body.  She came, crying out his name, and came again as he stiffened over her, flooding her with his own cum.  He made a deep sound in his chest, the low growl of a big predator, sated.   He relaxed slowly, bending to press a kiss to the small of her back as he pulled slowly out of her.  Kiri lay there, exhausted as he took the pillow away and sat back.  He turned her over onto her back, touching her face.  All right, little cat?  She dragged her eyes open.  His face was relaxed, his cheekbones flushed, his hair damp with perspiration, as was his long, powerful torso.  His cock hung replete and glistening on his thigh.   Next time I want to hold you, she complained, looking at his broad chest.   If you ask very nicely.  Now, do you want to sleep, or eat?  She was exhausted, but more than that she was hungry.  Eat.  But first I want to wash.  And get his toy out of her ass.   The toy will dissolve after a little time, he told her.  He cupped one of her breasts in his palm, his touch warm and sure.  Id like you to wear yours to lunch.   Was he joking?  Kiri.  He waited, petting her.   She rolled her eyes.  Fine.  If you will.   He smiled slowly.  Very well.  But then youll owe me a favor.   What?  He stroked his other hand up her thigh and traced her swollen labia, wet with his seed.  There are other toys designed to wear here, in your cunt.  They stimulate and arouse as you go about your day.   No way.  Thats really twisty.  Her face burning, Kiri rolled away from his beguiling touch and sat up.   He laughed, that deep sound in his chest that she loved.  He pulled her back against his chest and pressed his mouth to her ear.  Want to wager that you will wear it for me? That and other toys?  When he held her like this, surrounded by his heat and strength, she was afraid he could talk her into every wicked thing he imagined.  She didnt seem to have much willpower where he was concerned.   You dont own me, she muttered.   He nipped at her earlobe.  That could change if you like.   If shed like him to own her? What the quark kind of a thing was that to say?  His grip changed, a new tension humming between them.  Kiri, he said, a new note in his voice.  Theres only one facet of you I want to possessthat is your sexuality.  And one thing you must remember, as we go forward.  This, between ussex play is all it will ever be.   She froze.  How was she supposed to answer that? Was he already regretting his decision to bring her here?  He stroked his fingertips over her cheek.  It needs to be said.  I dont want you to waste your time wishing for more.   Turning her face into the soft coverlet, she let a soft sound escape her throat.   Oh, Logan, she choked.  II think its too late.  After all this, how can you expect me not to love you, at least a little? Ive been so lonely, so lost.  And youre so  so masterful.  You swept into my life and took care of me.   She shook her head, pressing her forehead into the bed.  I cant help it.  I do want to be yours  in every way.   It was his turn to freeze, his big body going hard over her.  Kitten. . .   She lost control then, her body shaking with the force of her emotion.   He grabbed her arm in a bruising grip and flipped her over.  Are you laughing?  He looked taken aback.  She let her laughter spill out in the quiet room, patting his chest in consolation.  It was starry to be one up on him for once.   Honestly, Logan Stark.  Are you for real? Ive got enough trouble without you bossing me around even more.  And as far as falling in love just because youre good at sexnot gonna happen.   He shook his head wryly.  One thing is certain.  You wont bore me.   She shrugged.  Same.   My only wish is to entertain and amuse you.  He swatted her lightly on the hip.  Now up.  Im hungry.   He slid off the bed and walked away toward his lav.  Kiri did the same, in the other direction.  He was right, it would be a waste of her time to long for more than sex, no matter how good it felt to be held in his arms.   She already one impossible star to reach for, she didnt need another.        13  Kiri showered in the private, feminine bath between Starks bedroom and the mistress room.  She was exhausted, her arms and legs trembling, and she leaned against the wall of the enclosure instead of standing erect.  She managed to wash off and then sank down onto the bench outside, her face buried in the soft towel.   Great God beyond, what chaos her life had become.  Like the explosion of a star, leaving the once bright glow scattered across space in chunks of rock.  Okay, so her future hadnt been all that starry, but at least shed had a place of her own.  Now, she wasnt sure what the seven hells she had.  Maybe a safe haven, maybe just a soft landing before she was catapulted out into the cold, dirty streets again.   Her stomach growled, reminding her that part of her ailment was that she needed nourishment.  Evidently being arrested took lots of nutrition.   So did sex with Logan Stark.  She shook her head, smiling with embarrassment at how he beguiled her into doing exactly what he wanted.  Drying herself off, she tugged her new panties up.  So soft and delicate.   She made a face as they snugged into place.  She could still feel the remnants of the plug in her ass, as well as the gesic.  And her pussy was tender from his cock pounding inside her.  She felt like a sexual creature.  This confused her, which made her want to snarl with irritation.   She was used to knowing exactly who she was, even after a night with an attractive guy.  Kiri te Nawa, owner of her own business, looking out for herself and working hard for what she wanted.  This man made her want to forget the world outside his penthouse, outside his bedroom.  And as he had just reminded her, that was the wrong thing to do.   Her new cosmetics had been placed on the counter before the lighted mirrors.  She opened the pots and tubes and carefully used the eye shadow and lip gloss as shed been shown.  Then, finger combing her damp hair into tousled waves, she gazed at her finished reflection in the mirror.   Tired, with shadows in her eyes, but she still looked pretty good.  Of course sex with him had put that flush in her cheeks, not the makeup and new clothes.  She frowned at her glowing reflection.  Shed was a tough, independent woman, had been since she was a teen.  She needed to remember that and not let him take over her lifebecause he might not want her clinging to him, but she didnt doubt that hed boss her around just as much as she let him.   Her gaze skittered away, her cheeks hot as she recalled just how good it was to allow him to take over in the bedroom.  She pressed her hands to her hot cheeks, blowing out a hard breath, remembering kneeling before him, pleasuring him with her mouth.  Lying spread on the pillows for him, able only to take what he did to her.   She caught her breath as her pussy contracted in remembered pleasure, the remnants of the gesic in her ass sending a tingle of sensation through her.  Shed never even imagined letting a man hold her still, or use toys on her, never considered it an attractive part of sex play, and here she was, going off to eat a meal with her body still preoccupied with the remnants of passion.   She didnt understand the pull he exerted on her.  Too much to try and cipher out now.  How could she explain to him that he wasnt to fall for her, either, as she had no intention of falling in love with any man? If she said it now, it would sound as though she was only trying to give him tit for tat.   She wrinkled her nose.  Shed just have to prove it to him.         They ate by the windows again, hot creamed vegetable soup with fragrant rolls and the soft white cheese to which Kiri was rapidly becoming addicted.  Stark poured her a glass of the white wine shed enjoyed at Jasmine, although he drank only water himself.  He refilled her glass as soon as it was empty, too.   Ive business to finish up for the next few hours, he told her.  Why dont you relax with a holovid or a reader?  The prospect of curling up with a good story was beguiling, but Kiri shook her head at Starks autocratic tone.  Have you another work station I could use? She should be doing something, although what?  She leaned her head on her hand and then covered her mouth as she yawned unexpectedly.   No.  He ignored her frown.  What I have is a state of the art holovid viewing area.  Youll relax for a few hours.  You can go back to fighting the galaxy tomorrow.   And with that he picked up her glass of wine and ushered her into a small, plush room with a large leather sofa.  He seated her, dropped a cloud-soft half-paca throw over her legs, showed her how to use the controller and left the room.  The door shut behind him.   Kiri sat for a moment, stunned.  She picked up her glass of wine from the elegant little hover-tray and toasted the huge holovid screen waiting her commands.   Okay, guess Im going to relax.  Weird.  Sex and a meal was all she ever had with a guy, but she was staying with this one.  She slid down in the comfortable depths of the reclining sofa, curling up under the throw.  A distraction was definitely what she needed right now.   She found a travel show about Pangaea and settled back to watch.  The tour guide, a slender Pangaean with green hair that fluttered around her head and throat, smiled.  Welcome to Pangaea, the garden planet.   Soon Kiri was along for a tour of gardens full of beautiful plants and flowers.  They proceeded to a farm which grew all manner of vegetables and then to a coffee plantation on a verdant, tropical mountainside.  Shed like to walk through the rows of glossy leaved shrubs, feel the leaves and berries for herself, smell the air.   She woke with a start when someone said her name.  Ms.  te Nawa?  Huh? What? Kiri sat bolt upright.  Shed fallen asleep in her nest.  The holovid screen was off, and a few large hoverlamps had been lighted.  In their soft glow, a slender man in a white smock and black pants stood beside the sofa.  He bowed with a polite smile, his pale green hair gleaming.  Would you care for dinner, Ms.  te Nawa?  Um, she responded, rubbing a hand over her face.  Who are you?  I am Natan, Mr.  Starks chef and housekeeper, the man said proudly.  I will serve you dinner.   She shook her head.  No, thanks.  Im not really hungry.   Natans round eyes widened in horror.  But, Ms.  te Nawa, you must eat.  I have prepared a pie with real pheasant and baby vegetables.  And there is a special wine to complement.   Real game bird and vegetables, instead of vegeprotein? That sounded really good.  Will Mr.  Stark be having dinner?  His expression went to neutral, although she noticed shrewdly that his hair fluttered around his throat.  Mr.  Stark is involved in a conference and will dine in his office.   She shrugged nonchalantly.  She didnt need him around all the time.   As Natan returned to his galley, Kiri stretched and then went to use the lav.   Could I just eat at the small table where we had lunch? she asked, popping her head into the galley to give Natan the smile that got her male customers to buy the extra-large size of coffee with special additions.   He beamed at her.  Of course.  I will set the table immediately.   He brought a dish of candles and a lovely place setting with a salad and a goblet of wine, then held her chair for her with a flourish.   Thank you, Kiri said, charmed.  This is really nice, Natan.   He bowed and then scurried away to bring her main course.   Kiri ate, and drank her wine, gazing out the windows at the lights far below.  It was a fairly clear night for onceshe could see the lights of space craft coming in to hover and land at the space port across a finger of the bay, and the lights of ships clustered along the docks.  Once, a cruiser zipped by the windows, so close she jumped and nearly spilled her wine.  It was closely followed by another with a bar of brilliant lights flashing across the topthe cops.  She laughedwhoever the daredevil was, he or she was busted.   She wandered over to the windows with her wine to gaze out at the foggy night for a while.  It felt strange to be here in this luxurious aerie, with time on her hands.  Nothing to do but entertain herself until Stark was done with his business.   She watched more travel videos, the next one about Serpentia, the desert planet.  Whoa, now there was a place about as different from Pangaea as you could get.  Expanses of golden sand and red cliffs, with oases and spectacular sunsets.  Strange beautiful snakes and beings.   Of course Serpentians looked nearly human, just more sinuous in their movements, and with that golden skin, almost like exotic statues.  Haassea and Slidi were Serpentian.  Kiri scowled as she remembered the sensuality both women wore like a cloak.  But they werent here, she was.  She curled into a different position in her cushions, leaning her head on one hand as she watched the holovid.   Serpentia had some nice resorts.  She couldnt get over how clean the air was there and on Pangaea.  Must be nice to go out in the sun and rain without worrying about being fried or even poisoned.   But as the evening turned to night, she found herself yawning alone on the divan, too sleepy to enjoy her leisure.  Well, it had been seven hells of a day, and the day before that.  She was exhausted, and she wasnt waiting for him any longer.  She could see herself to bed quite well.  How did rich people stand all this free time? Sitting still was exhausting.   She found her new clothing hung in the mistress closet, and the nightwear of previous guests relegated to the back.  She chose a lovely nightgown and peignoir in a deep teal lii silk.  It looked new.  The lii silk slipped over her bare skin like a caress, and when she belted on the robe, she stared at herself, barely recognizing the slim woman in the mirror.   You look like his mistress, she murmured.  She eyed herself uneasily.  She felt like one, too.  Well dressed, well fed and well fucked.         Stark sat back in his office chair with a sigh, rubbing his hands over his eyes.  They were tired and dry.  Natan had long since brought him dinner and then cleared away the remains, but Stark had worked on, making sure all the details were taken care of for his trip to New Asia.   Hed done this after spending much of the afternoon in a holovid conference with the captains of Orion and her sister ships, Cassiopeia and Andromeda, as well as the head of LodeStar security, Bronc Berenson.  Stowaways had been discovered on all three LodeStar cruise ships.  All ex-military males and females, all drugged, disoriented and claiming not to know how theyd gotten onto the ship.   Berenson, a large, stone-faced ex-soldier himself, looked even more grim than usual.   Sir, I believe theyre telling the truth.  Commander Navos himself questioned the pair on the Orion, and he says their last memories are of drinking in a bar on Earth II.   So they were kidnapped? Starks gut iced.  Do we know why?  I have my suspicions, sir.   And what are your suspicions? demanded Captain Aleah of the Cassiopeia.   She was ex-military herself, as was Captain Zeon of the Andromeda and Steve Craig.  All of them looked as enraged as Stark at the thought that LodeStar vessels were being used to victimize ex-soldiers.   Slavers acquiring gladiators.  Berenson bit out the words as if he were chewing off a chunk of rock.  Either as sport for large predators captured from the outlying planets or set against other sentient beings.   Or against each other, Zeon added somberly.  This was once a custom on my planet for soldiers defeated in battle.   On Earth I, too, Craig agreed, his disgust clear.  I hear there are still plenty of illegal fight rings there and on E II.   Stark nodded.  Yes, and on Serpentia.  As soon as one is found, the operation is simply moved to a new location.  Bronc, any idea who the handlers were?  Berenson shook his head.  No sir.  But were working with the IGSF and the IBI.  Well figure it out.  We do have one lead.  Two of the men were taken from New Seattle.  Place called The Flash.   Find out who owns it.   The conference ended with Berensons promise that Stark would know as soon as there were any breaks in the case.  Stark instructed his captains to give the kidnapped men a free voyage home, and treat them like royalty.  From the looks on their faces, this would not be a problem.   Stark called Natan for more coffee and some gesics for the headache that had begun to pound in his temples, and worked on.   Finally finished with his preparations for his journey, he sat back in his chair, and drank a glass of moon brandy to relax before going to bed.  He gazed absently into the glass.  The clear amber liquid was the color of Kiris eyes.   He thought back to their sex earlier, and found himself grinning as he remembered her indignant words.  Honestly, Logan Stark.  Fall in love with you over good sex? Not gonna happen.  His little cat was nothing if not brutally honest.  That was fine with him.  He was all too used to women trying to parse out what he wanted to hear and then cooing it in his ear.   He took another sip, then grimaced as memory soured it on his tongue.  The woman hed wanted first, the one hed thought would be by his side in his bed and on his arm, had been the mistress of lies.  Adora Crest had professed her love for him, and sighed happily as he laid out his dreams of success and wealth.   Hed reveled in protecting her, her fears made him feel strong.  Her longing for material things had made him feel a hero for giving them to her.  Shed also nearly drawn him away from his primary responsibilitytaking care of his younger brothers.   In his early twenties, hed been the oldest, the one responsible for keeping them safe, clothed and fed.  The bitch had nearly talked him into leaving them behind.  Shed teased him into a hormone-ruled frenzy with her soft arms and glimpses of her perfumed cunt, begging him to cash in his newly successful business and go away with her, somewhere they could be alone together.   Only when hed found her in the arms of another man had he been able to see the truththat she had plans for his money all right, but they didnt include him.  She and her lover had planned to take all his credit and disappear.   The shame of even considering deserting the boys for the whore, heavy as his responsibilities had been for a young man, had nearly killed him.  When hed sobered up from a three-day bender, his brothers had forgiven him and theyd gone on with their lives.   But it had taken him years to forgive himself.  Hed thrown himself into business, vowing hed never rest until the three of them had so much wealth they would never again be at risk.   With his powerful sexual drive, he hadnt been able to stay away from women for long, but hed made sure they knew explicitly that sex was all he wanted from them, and a few expensive gifts were all they could expect from him.   Yes, Kiri was definitely one of a kind.  But her strength, her defiance conversely made him want to tame her.  He had to shift in his chair to ease a sudden tightening in his groin at the thought of her sultry beauty, enhanced by pampering and polishing, displayed in one of the exclusive clubs he sometimes frequented.  A jeweled collar and the finest lii silk leash, tied to his wrist.   With a wry twist to his mouth, he drained his brandy and rose from his chair, reaching down to adjust his burgeoning erection in his pants.  His imaginings had rendered him unfit for further work.   Luckily for him, relief was only a room away.        14  She was in the apartment.  The one from long ago, warm and bright despite the dark gloom outside.  Her tiny bed cubby enclosed her.  Her parents had fixed it for her, under the L of the stairs, so she wouldnt have to share anymore, because she was a big girl.  It was full of her favorite things: an old stuffed dog that shed pretended was real when she was younger, her game console, a painting of red flowers, and the new comforter shed chosen herself.  But despite the cozy place, she lay stiff with terror, her heart pounding.  Something was wrong.  Noises outside in the apartment.  Voices crying out, and light flashing under her doorwrong.  All wrong.  A heavy thud of something falling against her door.   She sprang up, scrabbling backward in the bed, her heart pounding, ready to scratch and fight.   Kiri.   It was Stark, kneeling on the edge of the bed in the lamplight.  He was nude, his broad shoulders and lean frame a powerful shadow between her and the lamp.   All right? he asked quietly.   She collapsed in the pillows with groan of relief, one hand to her chest, where her heart still pounded.  Quark, you scared me.  I thought She hadnt thought, shed reacted as if she were back in her apartment, only partially secure from intrusion.  Remnants of a nightmare slid through her mind and disappeared under his steady gaze.   He nodded.  Hed showered and shaved.  His jaw, limned in gold as he turned his head, was smooth and he smelled of his special lotion.  She let her gaze drop down over his bare body, a thrill of awareness slicking through her.  His cock was erect, thrusting out stiffly from his lean thighs.  Her pussy quivered with recognition and desire.  He wanted her again.   Im leaving in an hour, he told her.  Id very much like to fuck you before I go.   Youre leaving? She sucked her bottom lip in and let it slide back between her teeth.  Shyness seized her, and instead of answering she pushed the covers back in silent invitation.  You havent even been to bed.   Ill sleep on the cruiser.  And Ill only be gone for two days.  He cupped one hand around her knee and pulled her leg up toward him, opening her thighs.  Then he moved between them and pushed her nightgown up, baring her from the waist down.   Kiri reached to pull the tissue thin gown the rest of the way up, and he shook his head, his gaze on her breasts under the thin lii silk.  Leave it, he murmured.  He bent his head and used his teeth carefully on her, nipping at her protruding nipples through the thin silk.  His fingers were already stroking deftly between her legs and drawing her wetness out to sleek her entrance for him.   She whimpered at the rush of sensation, and he lifted his head to watch as he petted her, his firm fingertip circling the swollen bud of her clitoris.  Mm, I like the gown just this way.  It accentuates your pretty cunt.   He looked up to watch her expression as he fucked her with his fingers.  Ill have a toy made just for you, with a gold chain that will trail up across your mons and connect to a belt that I can tug very gently whenever I want your . . .  complete attention.   He had her attention now.  And she was so twisted to even listen to his wicked promises.  As if shed ever let him do something like that.   He bent to kiss her, smiling against her mouth.  Oh, kitten, your face is so expressive.  Such longing, such uncertainty.  Now come for me.   She was appalled to discover she couldnt help doing so.  She clutched at his broad shoulders, his skin hot and smooth under her hands as she convulsed around his fingers.   He made a sound of approval as he levered himself between her thighs.  He thrust his cock into her still spasming channel, and Kiri cried out in ecstasy at the sudden sensation of fullness.   Ah, thats right, he groaned, shuddering as she enveloped his length.  Squeeze me, kitten, hard as you can.  So good.   Kiri curved up to meet him.  His very sureness made him irresistible as he filled her with himself, taking his pleasure with swift thrusts.  She slid her hands up across his broad, muscled back and held him close, reveling in his hard weight over her, his need for her.  Then her own body took over as his cock moving inside her ignited a deep, desperate need to come again around him.   Do you want this? He slid one hand under her bottom and held her there for his deepening strokes.   Yes.  She wrapped her leg around his tight, flexing ass to pull herself up against him.   Thats right, he approved.  I can feel your cunt squeezing me.   He watched her, his face taut with passion.  Helpless against the pleasure, arent you, little cat?  Yes, Kiri groaned as she gave into the dark waves of pleasure rolling through her.  Oh, Logan.   He stiffened in her arms, heat pulsing into her, but continued to move for a long time, with slow, languid strokes.  Her body clasped him with little aftershocks of pleasure.   He dropped a kiss on her lips.  That was good.  Thank you.   But when he moved off of her, he leaned on his elbow, his hand on the plane of her belly.  His face had that relaxed look she liked so much, a flush over his hard cheekbones, a dew of perspiration on his skin.   Ill speak with you again later today, he told her.  Via holovid.   Where are you going?  To New Asia, on business.  While Im gone, I want you to get your business in order for someone else to run.   What? Ill be working it.   Kitten, my next trip is to Frontiera, and Ill be gone for nearly two weeks.  Ill want you with me.   Kiri squirmed uneasily, although it was hard to worry too much while she was lying against him, his hand on her.   Logan, I hate flying.  Rather have my feet on the ground.  Around the city is okay, but deep space? Ugh.  No thanks.  Ill stay here and work while youre gone.   She had so much to do.  Use his loan to improve her kiosk and find a new apartment.  Better get going on that before this thing between them fizzled.  Although right now he certainly showed no signs of boredom.  She looked him over for the sheer pleasure of it, letting the back of her fingers trail over the smooth skin of his ribs.   Not that she wanted him to be gone, either.  Why do you have to go, anyway? Cant you just run all your businesses via holovid conferences?  Because my brothers are there.  Ill visit them while Im on planet.   That she could understand.  She just wished they were on this planet.  Deep space, ugh.   Space travel is quite safe, he told her.  Especially on one of my ships.   Oh, dont think much of yourself, do you? she teased.  But she eyed him with a tinge of awe.  He owned a quarking cruise line.   Simple fact.  I pay for the best, and I get it.  And youll come with me, because youre going to miss me the next few days.   Ill be much too busy.  She stroked her fingers up through the mat of hair on his chest.   He stroked his hand up under her nightie, cupping her breast, swiping his thumb over her nipple.  She lifted into his touch, silently asking for more, and he gave it to her, petting her.   Leave some time for shopping.  Ive asked Haassea to choose a wardrobe for you.  Youll have final approval, but youre going to need evening wear as well as some travel kit.   He was hard to deter, but she was just as stubborn.  I dont need any more clothing.  How about a new coffee machine instead?  He shook his head, his eyes on his hand as he moved it to fondle her other breast.  We can discuss that later.  Not interested in gowns? I should have known.  Hmm, perhaps well stop off at a certain resort I know on Serpentia.  They specialize in the training of naughty mistresses.   She eyed him with a frisson of alarm. Thats just another reason to stay here.   He chuckled.  Well see.  They teach a lover how to accept certain activities for a masters pleasure and how to use certain  toys.  Then he slid his hand down where his cock had been and smiled at her.   Youre not my master, and I already came twice, she told him.  Didnt come out quite as authoritative as shed hoped, though.  Shed work on that, just as soon as he was finished.   He shook his head chidingly.  Youll orgasm as many times as I want you to.  And I like touching you when youre soft and wet with my cum.   He stroked her clitoris with a light, teasing touch, and despite her recent satisfaction it felt starry.  She loved having his hands on her, and if he wanted to give her another of those cataclysms of pleasure, she wasnt going to say no.   His eyes narrowed.  And now I believe youd like to come . . .  wouldnt you?  Kiri nodded helplessly as pleasure tightened under his expert touch.   Now, little cat, he said and watched her as she came apart.   Then he kissed her goodbye.  In a haze of Stark-induced languor, she slipped her arms around him and held on to him, nuzzling her face into his neck, inhaling his scent.  His arm tightened, and for a moment he held her close, skin to skin, his heart beating against hers.   But when she was close to slipping back into sleep, he pulled away and slid out of bed.  He pulled the covers up over her, and traced his fingertips over the curve of her cheek.  Stay out of trouble while Im gone, hmm?  Mm-hmm.  She turned into the pillows, her body so relaxed she was sure shed go back to sleep.  Bye, Logan.   Goodbye, kitten.   Instead of going back to sleep, Kiri lay wide awake, wondering uneasily what it would be like to have some faceless being instruct her in pleasing Stark.         Stark was gone when she woke again.  A gentle chime sounded again, and Kiri sat up, looking around groggily.  A small comlink perched on the pillow next to hers.  She leaned on one elbow to pick it up and clicked it on.   Good morning, Stark said, his face and shoulders appearing in a small holovid above the link.  He looked fresh and rested, clad in one of his dark gray business suits.  He lifted a cerametal mug to his lips and drank, steam rising around his face.   Where are you? she asked sleepily.   On the way to rendezvous with one of my smaller ships, Arcturus.  Shell take me the rest of the way to New Asia.   She yawned, pushing the covers away and stretching.  He watched her over his cup and she remembered she wore the wispy, clinging nightgown.  She leaned on her elbow, letting one strap fall from her shoulder, enjoying the power of knowing he liked the way she looked.   However, speaking of his ships reminded her hed soon be going on a much longer trip.   What ship will you take to Frontiera?  The Orion, my flagship.  Youll enjoy meeting the captain and crew commanders.  Theyre a fascinating bunch.  Well land in Frontiera City, which is where people dress for the evening.   She wondered what the city looked like.  Dark and dirty like New Seattle, or clean and fresh? Shed look it up on the holovids, but that was all, because she was staying right here with both feet on planet.  The deep black void of space, ugh.  Not for her, even with him at her side.  Will you stay there, or go on into the wild lands?  Ive meetings with the mayor-potentate and a few of my business associates.  There will be parties.  Stone Mastersons wife enjoys entertaining and she has many  friends.   Including women, she realized, jealousy flaring.  And theyd all be maneuvering to be beside him, because no matter where he went, he would be the biggest catch.  And she wouldnt be there to guard him.   How about in New Asia? she asked, frowning.   He gave her a gleaming look over his mug.  Oh, the entertainments there are spectacular.  Dancing girls and flesh shows abound.   Will you go to those?  He shrugged.  You could be with me.   The bastard, he was playing her.  She mimicked his casual shrug.  Ill be so busy, Ill hardly know youre gone.  But enjoy your socializing.  I expect Ill be out myself.   Rak will be glad to take you anywhere youd like to go, he said agreeably.  And provide security while youre there.   Including fending off any males who got too close.  She opened her mouth to tell him what he could do with that suggestion and then remembered that she was in his bed and for the moment, living on his largesse.  She settled for raising her brows.   You think I need security when I go out? Ive been on my own for years.   His jaw set.  The city isnt safe.  Youre with me now, and youll have one of my men with you when youre out.  Not negotiable, Kiri.   Perhaps Ill have a talk with Opal, she muttered.  And ask her to do the same for you.   I can look after myself, he reminded her, his gaze softening.  Do you like your new comlink?  She examined the small device.  It was made of some semi-precious alloy that looked like it should be in a jewel shop.  Its lovely.  Thank you.  Maybe hed let her keep it.   Amber from Serpentia.  See the earpiece on the side? You can have it surgically attached if you like.   Kiri found the small earpiece.  Embedded with diamonds, it did look like expensive jewelry.  Really?  Its yours, Kiri.   She smiled at him, wishing she wasnt all sleep rumpled.  Thank you.   Just see that you keep it with you at all times.   She nodded.  For security, that was wise.  Hers was a cheap one with holish reception half the time.  Shed be happy to transfer her info to this one.  Have you another work station I could use?  Yes.  Natan will show you.  He looked away, as if someone else had arrived.  Dont be late for your spa day, he said, and the hololink winked out.   Yes, master, she muttered, wrinkling her nose.   Then she grinned to herself and hopped out of bed.  She wouldnt mind a spa day.  Never had one.        15  Kiri would have liked to order some coffee first, but when she used her new comlink to contact Illyrian Bean, her coffee supplier, her usual sales person was not available.  Kiri left a message.   She exited Starks penthouse to find a pilot waiting at the end of the loading podway.  A short, stocky man, his fit, wrestlers build belied his short, silver hair and the wrinkles on his face.   He eyed Kiri with what looked like suspicion as she approached him.  She sighed inwardly.  He was probably used to the high-society women Stark usually squired about.   After her attempt to order coffee, shed succumbed to the temptation to research Stark on the web, and she was feeling profoundly uneasy after seeing the beautiful, big-busted women who paraded through the holovids on Starks arm.  None of them resembled her, that was for sure.   Shed been overawed by the ornate surroundings of the gatherings, too, and recognized several famous faces among the people who fawned over Stark, or at least greeted him as an equal.  Singers and holovid stars as well as government officials.   Why should he want to keep her around? Maybe he was like a man craving vegeprotein snacks and a bubble soda when hed been on a steady diet of imported pheasant and champagne.  Shed better do her best to let them polish her up.   She stopped before the pilot and held out her hand.  Hello, Im Kiri.  You must be Rak.   The pilot took her hand gently in his calloused paw and nodded politely.  Yes, maam.  Im Rak.  Mr.  Stark said youll be spending the day at a spa.   I will, she agreed, wrinkling her nose.   She walked into the slider, looking around at the soft beige interior, with fitments of goldtone cerametal.  Starry, she approved.  Is she new?  Yes, maam.  His gruff voice held more enthusiasm now.  Just glided off the line a few weeks ago.   Shes a beauty.  She sniffed appreciatively.  May I ride in the cockpit with you, please? Ive only ever flown on the big airbuses.  I want to know what its like to sit at the controls and see everything coming right at you.   He eyed her as if shed asked him to let her dance on the nose, but then he shrugged.  I reckon it cant hurt.  This way, please.   She followed him into the small, sleek cockpit and sat down in the co-pilots seat.  Fasten your belt, there, Rak said gruffly, pointing at the harness on her seat.  Kiri fastened it quickly and then peered out the windshield with awe.  They were perched high on the side of Starks penthouse building, with the clouds drifting around them.   Another slider shot by a short distance away and Kiri rocked back in her seat with a gasp.   You sure about this? the pilot asked, scowling at her.   She nodded quickly.  I am.  Ill be very quiet, I swear.  You wont even know Im here.   The expression that flickered over his face was so swift she nearly missed it.  It said very clearly, Well see about that.   Kiri sat back in her seat and watched as he flipped levers and various lighted dials and gauges on the sleek dash.  There seemed to be a great many lights, red and green and yellow.   A soft hum filled the cockpit, and two large gauges glowed brighter.  He was powering up the engine.  Another slider shot by, on the same trajectory as before.  This time she only flinched a little.   How will you know when its safe to take off? she asked him nervously.  Shed played simu-games, pretending she was piloting all kinds of craft, but this was real and she didnt recognize all these controls.   He tapped a screen in the center of the dash, and she saw a number of small shapes.  After watching for a sec she saw that they slid in patterns just like the simu-game screens.  There are designated flyways around the city.  Well take off up to a higher level than the flights coming this way, so we dont collide.   Kiri nodded, relieved.  He knew what he was doing, of course he did.  She just wasnt sure she did, sitting up here.  Sitting with Stark in the passenger seats of his gliders, shed been distracted.  Here, that was not possible.   She clung to the arms of her seat as the craft lifted lightly in the air and slipped upward into the clouds.  Her stomach seemed to have stayed behind somewhere, and she swallowed hard, determined to quell her nerves.   Sitting in the cockpit, she could feel the subtle tilting of the craft as the pilot slipped around tall buildings and through a pair of towering lighted power stations.  Inside the cabin, she would have missed it and not known they were turning unless she peered out the window.  Slowly her nerves calmed and she began to enjoy the flight.  It was like being inside a game, only real.   As they landed softly on the dock at the shopping center, Kiri looked over at Rak and grinned.  Thank you.  That was starry.   He nodded.  You were, uh, a good passenger.  Didnt get in the way.   She unfastened her seatbelt and looked around her one last time.  Maybe Ill to learn to fly one of these.   She thought she heard him groan quietly as she walked out into the main cabin, but she magnanimously ignored it.  Really, Starks employees could stand to loosen up a bit.   The hatch slid open, revealing the shopping center landing dock and a waiting attendant in Maitresses tasteful cream.  This one was a pretty blonde with a friendly smile.   Hello, Im Taara.  Please come with me.   Kiri smiled back.  Then she took a deep breath.   Bye, Rak, she said.  See you around dinner time, I expect.  These people have some work to bring me up to Starks standards.   Ignoring the stunned look on the old pilots face, she strode out of the craft, her head high.         Haassea was not in, but she had left lengthy instructions for her new client.  Kiri was whisked away to a lovely little room, divested of her clothing, helped into a tiny pair of panties and immersed in a tub full of hot gooey mud by two young Egglantians with hairless, ovoid heads, lavender skin and meltingly lovely eyes.  She wasnt sure if they were male or female, then decided with an inward shrug that it didnt matter.  They werent interested in what a human had to offer.   You are a friend of Mr.  Starks, one said, batting long lashes.   Kiri nodded self-consciously.  And what are your names?  I am Blii, said the small one.   And I am Flo, said tall.   Kiri smiled back at them.  Nice to meet you, Blii and Flo.   We are honored to serve you.  Oh, you are so lucky, Blii breathed.  Mr.  Stark is starry.  So very masculine.   The two laughed together, the sound like soft chimes, and Kiri gave a half-hearted chuckle.  It seemed no one was immune to Starks charm.   After a short time, she was tenderly assisted out and offered a drink as she stood dripping on a mat, the goo sliding down her body and then drying quickly in the warm air blowing from small dryer bots that floated around her.   No, thanks, she said, wrinkling her nose.  Lets just get on with it.   Oh, youll want to drink it, Flo assured her, eyes wide.  It contains gesics.   Kiri gulped it, the two nodding approvingly.  She discovered why as Blii walked behind her and then proceeded to pull a long strip of dried mud from her, taking what felt like every small hair on her body, and skin as well.  It stung as if she had been whipped with fire.  Unprepared for the pain, Kiri let out a shriek.   The two attendants appeared before her, their heads cocked in identical looks of horror that would have been funny had she not been fighting tears.   Hurts, she managed.   Oh, no.  Haassea herself calibrated the gesics for you, Flo breathed.   Yes, you humans are so sensitive, Blii nodded.  We do our best to alleviate this.   Well, I think someone made a mistake.  Kiri took a deep breath and blew out.  Can you get me a stronger oneplease? She could work through coffee burns, and had many times, but that was because she had no choice.  If she was going to withstand more of this pain, she needed gesics.   At once.  Flo hustled away.   She returned in a very short time, out of breath, bearing another beaker before her like a grail.  I mixed this one myself.   Kiri drained the mug.  No sooner had she lowered the cup than a wave of well-being slithered over her like a soft, tickly blanket.   Whoa, she crooned.  That did the trick.  All righty then.   Flo watched anxiously as Blii began the next strip.  Kiri grinned at her.  Gwon, she said.  Hit it.   Flo ripped.  When Kiri stood still, smiling, Flo nodded happily.  I mixed the gesics right this time.   The mud gone, her skin tingling pleasantly, Kiri was ushered into a comfortable recliner, only to have the panties nipped away.  The two tipped their heads together, studying her mons with deep interest.  She clamped her thighs together.  What are you looking at?  Your pubis, Flo said.  Very pretty.   Oh, yes.  Lovely, Flii agreed.  I think just a trim, yes?  Yes, Mr.  Stark did say not to remove  Hey, Kiri broke in indignantly, her face and chest on fire.  You discussed my privates with Mr.  Stark? Well, I decide what happens there and no one else.   They blinked at her.  Then both broke into their chime-like laughter, leaning toward her conspiratorially.  Of course.   We did not know you had a preference.   That figured.  Stark had just ordered what he wanted done.  Well, it was her body, not his.   Look, just a trim.  I dont mind looking sexy, but not too bare, you know?  Oh, no, Flo agreed.  You are a natural beauty.  Mr.  Stark said so himself.   Blii brought Kiri another drink, this one a Pear Blossom, and they readied their treatment.  The first part wasnt bad, involving warm strips of a waxy substance.   Mr.  Stark is very handsome, sighed Flo.   Kiri opened her mouth to agree, and Blii ripped one of the strips of wax away from her pubis.  Kiri let out a squeak.  Shed felt that one.  She clutched her drink as Flo reached for another strip.   He is so masterful, Blii sighed.  Flo ripped.   And so rich, Flo added, ripping again.  Kiri whimpered.   All done, Blii crooned, patting her shoulder.  Now enjoy your drink.   Kiri gulped the rest of it and then lay back, enduring as her hands and feet were scrubbed, buffed, trimmed and then wrapped in luxurious oils and ointments.  Shed never realized rich women had to be so tough.   You could have laser surgery on your scars, Blii breathed confidentially.  They would disappear.   Kiri shrugged.  Shed bet that took a lot of credit.   She emerged from Blii and Flos ministrations and was tucked into a silk robe.   Thanks, she said.  That was . . .  interesting.   They giggled as if she had told the joke of the year and bowed.  Kiri bowed back and followed the red-headed Serpentian, Slidi, into the dressing area.  Kiri eyed the ensembles and garments hanging around the mirrored room.  At least this part wouldnt hurt.   Weve chosen a large assortment of clothing for you, Slidi told her, her auburn head cocked at an arrogant angle.  Lets start with this one.   She whipped a black lace gown off its hanger.  Kiri eyed her, lifting her own chin.  Lets start with this, she shot back.  Im Kiri.  Youre Slidi, right?  The girl blinked, as if shocked to be challenged.  Yes.  I am Haasseas prime assistant  Nice to meet you, Slidi.  Kiri bit her tongue against the urge to remind the woman that she was Logan Starks mistress.  She took the dress, eyeing it warily.  Im not much for black.  Have to wear too much of it for work.  But Ill try it, I guess.   She took off the robe, tossed it over a chair, and wriggled gingerly into the black lace.  Pulling it up over her shoulders, she turned to the mirrors.  Her jaw dropped.  The dress had more space than threads, and were those hershe peered at the mirror.  Her nipples showed through and so did her neatly trimmed pubic hair.   I dont think so.  She jerked the dress off her shoulders and wriggled out of it.  Nude, she stalked over to the clothing hanging on the walls.  She studied the array with increasing dismay and anger.  It was all either black, or crimson, or both, and made of translucent lace held together with bits of snakeskin and other slinky fabrics.   Kiri turned back to Slidi, who stood watching, arms crossed, a distinctly unfriendly look on her face.  I dont really care for any of these, Kiri said, gesturing at the clothing.  Can you bring me some other things to try, please? Something with a bit more fabric.   Are you saying our clothing isnt good enough for you?  Kiri stiffened, giving the redhead look for look.  At the prices Stark must be paying here, no way was she putting up with attitude.   Listen, she said clearly.  I dont know what your boss told you, but Im not a whore and I will not dress like one.  Now, are you going to bring me some other things, or do I walk?  Her ringing tones had exactly the effect she desired.  Two more faces peeked in the door.  The pretty blonde and a brunette slipped into the room, looking worriedly from her to Slidi.   Im sure there has been some mistake, the blonde said.  Haassea values Mr.  Starks business very much.   May we bring you some other ensembles to try? her brunette companion added.  Of course we want you to be happy, Ms.  te Nawa.   With a venomous look, Slidi glided from the room.  The brunette followed her.   Again, Im Taara, the blonde said, smiling at Kiri.   Slidis voice floated back clearly from the hallway outside.  You two fetch for her then.  Shes just some slummer Stark picked up for a sex weekend.   The blonde turned back to Kiri in horror.  Oh! Im so sorry  Kiri grabbed the nearest dress and clutched it in front of her like a barricade.   Id like my clothing back.  And then Ill be going.   Taara looked as if she might cry on Kiris behalf.  Yes, of course.  At once.   Kiri dressed quickly and then walked past the silent store clerks with her head held high.  Taara walked with her.  She looked back at her fellow clerks and then clicked her comlink.  The door slid shut, enclosing her and Kiri in the hushed elegance of the podway.   Im so sorry, the other woman whispered, stepping close.  I could be fired for saying this, but  Haassea and Mr.  Stark were once  you knowlovers.   I guess that explains a lot.  Like the mysterious lack of gesics in the drink Haassea had prepared herself.   Taara bit her lip.  Even so, Slidis behavior was very odd.   Odd? Try quarking rude, Kiri shot back.   The blonde nodded sorrowfully.  Yes.   Kiri had to smile.  Thanks.  Youre sweet.   Taara smiled back.  Then her eyes widened in mischievous glee, like a little girl.  Listen, I shouldnt say this, either, but  The docking hatch opened, revealing Rak.  He looked at Kiri and frowned.  Didnt buy anything?  Kiri shook her head, avoiding his gaze.  She started forward, but the blonde stopped her, a hand on her arm.   Wait.  As I was saying, my cousin has a boutique near here.  Very fun fashions.  Would you like me to give your pilot directions?  What Kiri really wanted to do was go and hide somewhere.  But Rak raised his brows at her, his chin tucked in.  She shrugged.  Sure.  And thank you, Taara.   You are welcome, Ms.  te Nawa.  Ill tell Daanel you are coming.  Hell be very excited to dress someone as lovely and unique as you.  She gave Kiri a coy look.  And of course if anyone asks where you got your ensembles, you might mention his shop.   Kiri surprised herself by laughing.  That was just good business, and business she understood.  I willif I find anything I like.  And call me Kiri.   Okay.  Bye, Kiri.  Taara hurried away, and Kiri followed Rak into the ship.   You wanna sit up with me again? he asked gruffly.   Sure, she said.  Anything to forget how little she fit into Starks world.        16  While the friendly Taara looked more human than anything else, her cousin was a full-blood Serpentian.  So slim he was nearly wraithlike, Daanel had golden skin, startling hair the color of the salad Natan had served her the evening before, and a sly, infectious grin.  He was clad head to toe in snakeskin that made him look like one of the reptiles Kiri had seen on the travelogue the evening before.  He welcomed Kiri into his boutique, which was as dark as a nightclub, with twinkling light balls floating about, reflecting from the windows and the sparkly cosmetics his assistants wore.   Welcome, lovely one, he said.  I am the incomparable Daanel, and I am going to dress you like an empress.  A sexy one, who dashes about on her slider when shes not slaying males with one look from her Tyger eyes.   Looking her up and down, he growled low in his throat.  Kiri burst out laughing.  He was so outrageous she couldnt take him seriously.   Rak, who had followed her in, shook his head.  Ill wait out here, he told her, pointing at a comfortable divan near the door.  Kiri followed Daanel back through his shop into the dressing area.  Thankfully, it was well lighted.   For the next hour, she tried on ensemble after ensemble.  Daanel even measured her feet and sent two assistants for a selection of boots, flats and sexy heels, saying his clothing must have the right footwear to be appreciated.   At the end of the whirlwind session, Kiri had several new ensembles, some warm and comfy, some daring and sexy, some fun and a bit outrageous.  None of them, even the sheer spider lace top and black leather vest and pants, worn with a pair of heeled black boots, made her feel like a whore.  Shed meant to say no after the second or third ensemble, but somehow she found herself just trying one more, and then one more, and loving them all.   She guessed she could always sell some of them for credit, although the idea made her want to cry.  But surely she didnt deserve this luxury, not when she hadnt earned any of it.   Not when all the extra credits she squeezed out of her shop like used coffee grounds went to finding out what happened that night outside her cubby in her childhood home.   But these were not her credits, and Stark had specifically instructed her to get new clothing.  And she guessed it might as well be nice things.   Seventh heavens, Daanel crooned, waltzing around her as she modeled the last ensemble for him.  You are going to make me, starry one.  Wait until they see you in that in the clubs.  And Ive a wrap thats perfect for you, as well.   He clapped his hands at one of his assistants, who grinned, obviously used to his drama.  Bring me the poppy-red halfpaca.   The purple-haired pixie dashed away and returned with a length of blazing red, which Daanel settled gently as a cloud around Kiris shoulders, flipping the end back over her shoulder, and then held out his hands, sighing like an artist who has finished a masterpiece.   Kiri stroked her newly soft hands over it reverently.  The bright color emphasized her eyes and hair, and it was so warm and light.  Oh, I have to have this.   Cosmic.  The Serpentians eyes gleamed fanatically.  Utterly cosmic.   Kiri wore her new leather and lace ensemble out of the boutique, the poppy cape over one arm.  She grinned sheepishly at Rak, who met her in the doorway.  He raised his shaggy brows at the three laden shop assistants.   Bought some things, she said.   Good.  The pilot nodded, as if shed completed her mission satisfactorily.   Two Intergalactic Space Force pilots in uniform stared at her as they walked past, appreciation written on their handsome faces.  A trio of women passed the other direction, eyeing her ensemble avariciously.   Daanel winked at her. Dont forget to take that look to the clubs.   She liked him, and she liked his cousin, but she wasnt really up for clubbing.   On the other hand, Stark was in New Asia watching naked women slither all over a stage and probably his lapor he would be when he concluded his business.  She could go out too.  Surely it was all right for her to enjoy herself a little.  Didnt mean she wasnt still working toward what was most important.   Also, showing these pretty clothes off in public might mean more business for Daanel.  She seemed to be his only customer this afternoon.  She knew how hard it was to gain recognition in this frenetic, crowded city.   Know any good places? she asked.  Maybe you and Taara could join me tonight.   He gave her a look of exaggerated delight that made her laugh.  Do we know clubs? Darling, have you never been to Le Tigre? Id love to show you off there.   My favorite.  It was the best dance club in the city and always packed.  Kiri had heard it was owned by Chaz Jaguari, although shed never seen him there.  Tal hung out there when he was flush, with some lovely on his arm.  Kiri wouldnt mind him seeing her looking successful.   Excellent.  Well pick you up.  Where?  Kiri turned to Rak, who managed to convey his disapproval without moving a facial muscle, like the good soldier he was.  Stark quadrant, Landing One.   Stark owned the whole quadrant? She might have known.   See you, Daanel caroled.   Rak led the way along the concourse to the landing pod, his posture stiff.  Im supposed to be with you when youre out, maam.   I dont want to get you in trouble, but I dont want you to be up late just because I am.  She stopped inside the slider and watched as he tipped Daanels assistants, who hurried away looking very pleased.  Want to drop me off? They could bring me back to Starks place.   Im paid to stay up late.  He closed the hatch with swift precision.  I will deliver you, wait for you, and bring you back to Landing One, miss.   Okay.  Kiri sat down in the passenger seat in the rear of the slider and then stood up and hurried after the pilot.  Can I still sit up here?  He nodded, already powering up the sleek craft, and Kiri belted herself in.  All right then.  She could do this; adjust to living in the lap of luxury  just for a while.         Flying in to Le Tigre was like approaching a battle site in one of the action videos Kiri loved to watch.  Colored lights pulsed across the low clouds hanging over the club, which was on the top of a building.  Fireworks shot into the night, with the low rattle of their explosions.  Vehicles jockeyed to land on the small space port pad, and far below in the streets people swarmed like bugs.  Against the grim backdrop of the city, the club exuded an edgy glamour.   Rak sent a droid to park the slider and followed Kiri into the foyer.  He had a disapproving scowl on his face again, but she was going to ignore that.   The high-ceilinged gilt and mirrored area was crowded with beings, all dressed to party, with shimmering, glittering clothing and cosmetics.  It was an upscale crowd, though, even the druggers with their eerie dilated eyes looked pretty healthy.   Well probably have to wait for a while, Kiri warned Rak.   He shook his head and marched through the crowd.  The guardshuge Argonautians in matching brief orange that showed off their impressive musculaturetook one look at him and Kiri and gestured them into the club.  She followed the stocky pilot, grinning with delight as those in line watched enviously.  She was used to dawdling in the lobby, waiting for the mysterious moment when the guards decided it was her turn to enter.   Kiri caught sight of Daanels crest of hair, highlighted to startling chartreuse, near the doors.  She beckoned.  The couturier slid through the crowd, his pretty cousin behind him.  Tonight he wore black snakeskin.  Taara wore a tiny, clinging gold dress.   Were in, Daanel crowed.  Darling, we must party together more often.   Daanel eyed Rak, striding ahead of them in his gray flight suit.  Is he supposed to help you get men or keep them away?  Daanel! Taara hissed.   Kiri shook her head at the irrepressible Serpentian.  Rak is a good guy.  Be nice to him.   Ill be at the bar, Rak told her, ignoring Daanel, keeping an eye out.  You dont go anywhere without me.   Kiri saluted, but she smiled as she did so.  Okay.  See you later.   Table, Daanel shrieked.  Kiri and Taara dove after him to a tall table.  Another couple was approaching from the other direction, but Daanel slithered onto a stool first and simpered at them, tilting his head coquettishly.  Sorry.  Taken.   They glowered but turned away.  First round on me, Daanel said.  What will you have, ladies?  Blue star for me, Kiri said.   Same, Taara agreed.   Daanel slid away through the crowd, and Kiri looked around.  This club was definitely more upscale than those around the port.  The crowd was well-dressed and for the most part well-behaved.  Probably due to the Argonautians patrolling the periphery, their craggy faces stern.   Ooh, look.  Taara pointed up.   Overhead, huge holovid cats prowled through the dark air with careless, predatory grace, their sleek fur striped with orange and black.  Tigers.  Kiri shivered pleasurably.  Must have been really something when the deadly cats roamed the wild places of this planet.   This place is starry, Taara said in her ear.  Its so nice of you to invite us.  So tell me about Mr.  Stark.  Whats he like at home?  Dance? A well-dressed blond man leaned over the table toward Kiri.   She shook her head, smiling.  Just got here.  Maybe later?  He was hot.  Taara widened her eyes at Kiri.  You should have danced.  Except maybe Mr.  Stark doesnt want you dancing with other guys, hmm?  Kiri shrugged.  I want a drink first.  I dont need a partner to dance.  Wasnt like shed be going home with one of them, or to some back hallway.   I know, Taara agreed.  I love to dance.  She waved her slender arms over her head, and Kiri admired her shimmery gold halter and tiny fuzzy skirt.  With gold glitter sprayed on her eyelids and hair, the blonde looked like some sexy fey creature.   She smiled gleefully at Kiri.  Im so glad you snagged Stark.  I think that bitch Slidi is jealous, you know.   It shows.  Kiri leaned closer.  What about Haassea?  Taara looked uneasy.  She and Mr.  Stark had a thing, years ago.  Before she married her boy toy.  Oops, I probably shouldnt call Traay that.  Dont tell.  She grabbed Kiris arm for emphasis, and Kiri shook her head, grinning.   Hes absolutely moonbeamy, Taara added.  Golden, if you know what I mean.  He helps run the business, so he comes in sometimes.   But she still wants Stark? That was disgusting.   Taara shrugged gracefully.  Serpentians have a hard time letting go, you know? Takes us a long time to uncoil once we get wrapped around someone.   Kiri understood the difficulty of letting go, but that bitch had bared her fangs the moment Stark turned his back.  And her prime assistant had hissed to back her up, or to try and get him for herself.   Daanel reappeared, his hands full of tall, fizzing beakers with glowing sapphire contents.  Blue stars.   The three of them saluted each other and drank.  Kiri winced at the intense cold and prickle of the drink and then sighed at the tart flavor and glow of well-being that filled her.  The drinks were a study in pleasure-pain, but delicious.  Made her think of Stark, and the twisty sex hed hinted at, as well as what hed already talked her into.   Like that anal plug and the way it had felt awful and then so very good with his cock inside her, filling her almost more than she could bear.  What else would he want to do? She squirmed in her chair, the seam of her tight leather pants abrading her through the thin lace of her panties.  Quark, she was getting turned on just wondering.   Two Serpentians appeared, smiling at Daanel and Taara.  Relieved by the distraction, Kiri grinned behind her glassthe men were identical twins, with the auburn hair that was so common among their kind.   Dance, gorgeous? they asked in unison.   Daanel and Taara exchanged a look of mutual thrill and nodded.  Watch our drinks, or shall we take them? Daanel asked Kiri.   Ill watch them for one dance, Kiri said.  The cousins hurried off to the huge dance floor, and Kiri took another drink as the singer slid into a throbbing love ballad.  Would Stark enjoy this place? Did he dance? She tried to picture him waving his arms over his head like a nearby dancer and giggled because neither the dancers loose action or shimmery orange shirt translated to Logan Stark.   Stark was a tough guy, hard and honed.  He could definitely move but in a very private way, tuned in to his own pleasure and hers.  She squirmed again, crossed her legs and took another hasty drink.  Okay, time to stop thinking about Stark or she was going to be linking him for long-distance sex right here from the bar.   Taara and Daanel reappeared long enough to claim their drinks.  Kiri finished hers, and when the blond man reappeared, she accepted his invitation to dance.  The music was fast, she knew she looked her best, and it felt good to move her body to the beat.   She took off her little jacket and tied it around her waist, raising her arms to the music.  Her partner moved in, his hands on her waist.  She let him do that much, but when he would have locked their bodies together, she put her hand on his chest and shook her head.   He disappeared after the song was over.  Kiri danced again and again, enjoying the music.  Other men and women joined her, then drifted away.  That was fine with her.   After a while, she made her way back through the club toward the glowing galactic sign for restroomsa circle with a stream of droplets burbling insouciantly through it.  The passageway was crowded, with people coming and going from the restrooms and from other doors that lined the passageway.  Two men and a woman emerged, all three of them flushed and mussed.  The woman seemed barely able to walk but smiled beatifically.   The light above the vacated room changed from red to green.  Another couple pushed toward it, jostling Kiri off her feet.  She reeled backward, to find herself caught against a wiry, tough body.  Another woman had broken her fall.   Thanks.  Kiri made to step away, but small hands tightened on her waist, yanked her backward and through a door into a dark room that smelled of sweat and sex and perfume, the odors so strong in the small space it nearly gagged her.   Hey.  She writhed, ready to claw, bite, whatever it took to get away from the bitch.   But her assailant was abruptly gone, the door thunking closed behind her.   Hello, Kiri te Nawa.        17  Kiri whirled, panting, her heart still pounding with fear.  A man leaned against the end of the narrow bed, arms crossed over his chest.  He wore a black leather duster, his black hair hung in long braids, and his face was tattooed so heavily that his light eyes gleamed in startling contrast.   He smiled, baring white teeth, beautiful and feral as one of the tigers prowling overhead.   Recognition jolted her.  Tal? What are you doing here? So it had been one of his gang who shoved her in here.  Why arent you at your own club?  Man gets tired of his own establishment once in awhile.  He looked her over, fingering the narrow beaker in his hand.  The contents sparkled crimson, like fresh blood, only with light captured inside.  Youre looking . . .  starry.   She bared her teeth at him.  Thanks.  What is this all about? You want to talk to me, Id appreciate if you did it out in the club.   Tal laughed, a whisper of sound that sent chills ghosting over her skin.  Too many eyes on the front entrance, if you know what I mean.  One thing about my place, I control who goes in and out.   Too bad for you, but I dont like being shoved into a sex cubby.   He cocked his head.  But weve been here before.   Kiris face burned with embarrassment.  They had, in a similar cubby at his club.   We could dance first.  You liked that.  You let me put my hands all over you.  You were hot as a flashbomb.  Did everything but fuck you on the dance floor.  Then I had youtwice.   Oh, she remembered.  Shed barely been able to walk afterward.  That was all the blue stars I drank.   He laughed that chilling laugh again.  No, that was you and me.  I could have you on your back in a few secs right now, if I wanted.   No, because Im with someone now.   Something moved in his eyes.  Kiri stiffened her legs against the urge to back away from him.  He was a predatorany sign of fear and hed seize the advantage.   That why you wouldnt stay with me when I invited? he asked softly.   She shook her head.  Their hookup had been months ago.  Shed met the ganger lord when she let one of her friends talk her into going out with her and her boyfriend, a member of Tals gang.   Tal Darkrunner was a beautiful man, and sex with him had been hot and daring, but when hed invited her be his woman, shed said no and meant it.   His gangers had been loitering when they emerged, a slick and rowdy lot, inked and leathered, the gazes of his men rapacious, the women envious.  They lived on the edge of the law, roaring through the city in droves, driving other traffic out of the airways before them with savage glee, their women hanging on the back of their sound-enhanced sliders.   Their presence had snapped Kiri out of her sexual daze.  She wasnt ending up like them, hanging around waiting on him, drugging and drinking to fill the empty hours.   Didnt know him then.  Turned you down because Id just as soon not lay my head where the police may come raiding any night.   Shed let Tal talk her into going out with him a few more times, but shed regretted it when she woke with a splitting head and the knowledge the credit hed blown on her could have been put to far more worthy use in her life.  At least Stark was helping her build her business.   Tal toasted her mockingly.  Heres to safety.  He tossed back his drink, then ran his tongue over his lip, considering her.  You think he can keep you safe, whoevers buying you pretty things?  His gaze sparkled, as if he was still laughing silently.  As if he knew things she didnt.   Ill keep myself safe, she said.  Show no fear; that was the only way through the maze of the tough streets, where choice hung on a razors edge.  Great seeing you, but Im here with friends.   He spread his hands in mock innocence.  Then go back to them.  No ones holding you.   She shook her head in disgust as she turned away.  Ganger lord, showing how tough he was.   He slid off the bed behind her and stepped close.  How about a kiss goodbye, starry girl?  How about not, she retorted, the hair on the back of her neck standing up.  He was hot as a flashbomb, but she had no doubt Stark would throw her out on her ass if she let another man touch her in any way except a public dance.  She slapped her hand on the control panel.   I have something you want.   His taunt made her pause for a sec.  Really? What?  He leaned closer, and she shivered, half with attraction, half with repulsion as he inhaled her scent, his braids brushing over her cheek.  Stay, and Ill give it to you.   Kiri closed her eyes, shivering as warm lips brushed her skin.  But they were the wrong lips.   Yeah, not happening.  He wanted to give her something, all right.   The door hissed open, and she emerged into the passageway and stopped short.  Rak was stood there and he looked angry, although his face relaxed slightly after he looked her over.  Several of Tals gangers waited, too, but they were giving the stocky ex-ISF pilot room.  A small redhead with facial piercings and eyes rimmed with heavy cosmetics smirked at Kiri.  Kiri glared back.   You okay? Rak demanded.   She nodded.  Im fine.  Tal just wanted a private word.   Rak glared over her shoulder.  Dont much care for his way of having that word.   Rak, please drop it, okay? Kiri asked.  Im fine.   The gangers stayed out of their way as Kiri followed Rak from the passageway.  The last glimpse she had of Tal, he held the redhead in his arms, his beringed hands on her ass, his head bent to give her a deep kiss.   That could have been her.  And if Stark hadnt stepped in to rescue her after her life went to black, probably would have been her, at least for a while.  Shed been so off-balance, she would have turned to Tal for help, and then shed have ended up mired in his world.   She shuddered and turned away to hurry after Rak.   Out in the club, the singer gyrated on the stage, ululating a wild song in some other tongue.  The dance floor was a mass of writhing bodies.  The noise and lights throbbed overhead, but now instead of an upscale club, Kiri saw a threatening maze.  The faces turned her way held leers instead of smiles.   Im ready to go, she yelled to Rak over the music.   They found Taara and Daanel, both of whom were still draped over a twin each, and said goodbye.  Taara hugged Kiri exuberantly.  Bye.  Lets get together soon.  Girls night! Ill bring Daanel.   Kiri nodded, grinning.  She liked the bubbly Serpentians, and a girls night in, even one that strangely included a man, sounded fun.   In the glider, Kiri turned to Rak.  I want to learn self-defense.  Will you teach me?  He gave her a narrow-eyed look.  That ganger pull you in there against your will?  Not him, one of his stupid friends.  Showing off for him.  This time.  But thered been some unspoken message behind the whole encounter.  But next time . . .  lets just say Id like it to be my choice.   Staying out of the clubs would be a good start.   Yeah, and I could give up my business at the spaceport and hide inside all day, too.  Trouble is everywhere.   Rak looked over at her.  Sure seems to find you, if you dont mind my saying.   She hugged her arms around herself, gazing into the past.  It always has.  So, you gonna teach me to fight?  He sent the craft into a gliding turn along an avenue of skyscrapers, lights reflecting in the tattered clouds above and below them.  If Mr.  Stark has no objection.   Good.  Kiri sank back in her comfortable seat, watching as Starks now-familiar building loomed ahead, a slim monolith through the fog and rain.  She was pretty sure hed approve of her getting better at defending herself.   Shed use her time with him to get smarter and tougher as well as stabilize her life.  And the next time one of Tals little gangers messed with her, shed do some damage.         It was weird being dropped off to the hushed elegance of Starks penthouse instead of making her way back to her tiny apartment, past the mumbled importuning of druggies and the threat of reeking alleyways with their slinking shadows.   She was never going back to that, Kiri resolved fiercely as she showered the sweat of dancing away and slipped into a nightgown and robe the purplish hue of plumquots in the market stalls.  Shed let Stark convince her that she was the woman he wanted at his side, at least for a time.   Not just for his credit, either.  But because she really, really liked the way his eyes went warm and relaxed, the way they had after he fucked her that last time, when theyd lain in his bed and just talked.  She wanted to see that look in his eyes again.  She wanted to put it there.   Shed seen a similar look in other mens eyes, but she hadnt felt connected to any of them, hadnt felt their strength wrapped around her, sure and steady.  Hadnt felt as if shed won some kind of award when they smiled at her, laughed at her jokes.  Hadnt felt as if their gaze held enough heat and power to warm her through one of the most frightening times of her life.   Might as well admit it to herself and quit pretending this was about credit, because it was, but it was also about being with Stark.  Tal was hot, but Stark was hotter and the police werent waiting for an opportunity to break down his door.   Although having free run of his huge place was quarking awesome.  Because she could, she padded barefoot into Natans kitchen galley, every surface polished and spotless.  A bowl of gremel fruit sat on the counter like an art display, their green rinds shiny.  She put the fattest on a plate, poked in the huge refrigerator for a pot of the creamy cheese she liked so much, and then found a package of herb crackers.  The tea maker was a quick study for a barista like her, and soon she had a mug of tea steaming aromatically.   She sat on a stool at the counter with her booty and cut the gremel open to reveal the sweet, juicy golden fruit.  She ate until she was stuffed, stacked her dishes in the washer and went back to clean her teeth.   In the mistress roomshe couldnt stop thinking of it that wayshe set her comlink on the bedside table and studied it before turning out the light.  What was Stark up to tonight, on his cruise ship? Shed looked up both Arcturus and Orion and been lost in admiration of the gleaming white ship with her huge arboretum and gracious staterooms, dining rooms and even clubs.  But idea of setting off into the black cold reaches of space still gave her the icy shudders.  Only one reason shed do that and until she knew where to go, no reason to take flight.   She was in her little bed cubby, alone but snug, because her family was just outside the hatch, in their apartment.  This was her special place, just for her, with all her favorite things.  No one could come in here unless she invited them.   But it wasnt a haven tonight.  Something bad was out there.  Noise and lightwrong lights flashing.  A voice crying out in terror, and then ending in a horrible wet gurgle.  Another screaming, high and thin.   Mama.  Dada.  Kai, she called, but her voice was only a whisper.   Something thudded against her door, and slid down, down.   As she stared in horror, crimson liquid slid under the door and widened into a pool that spread across the floor toward her.   She woke to find herself huddled in the soft bed.  The lights gleamed, and the room was quiet, except for her gasping breaths.   Oh, quark, her nightmare.  She was sweating, hot and chilled at the same time, as if shed been running outside in the cold, wet streets.   She pulled the comforter up around herself and sat, her chin on her knees, wishing Stark were here.  Shed wrap herself around him and let him fuck her until she couldnt think anymore, couldnt remember.   She rocked back and forth, eyeing her new comlink.  She could call him.  Then she shook her head.  What a babyshe didnt need a bedtime story to comfort her.  She was fine alone.  It was just being shoved into the sex room at the club by Tals gangers, that was all.   She was fine.  She was working toward her goals.  Stabilizing her business, getting a safer home for herself.  And soon shed be able to continue her search.   She was certain Tal had been lying about having something of hers, toying with her.  But if shed lost the last of her memories in the apartment fire, perhaps one day soon shed have something infinitely better.   The only other remaining member of her familyalive.        18  Kiri was waiting, wired on too little sleep and too much caffeine, when Rak arrived at the penthouse.  He ushered her into a room off the passageway that she hadnt even known was there.  It contained an elevated machine with a moving track to run on or hike up slopes or stairs, a bicycle, and lots of stretchy ropes and heavy looking pieces of metal with handholds.   The floor was covered with spongy mats, the walls with mirrors.  A holovid display unit hung over the elevated track.   Wow, a gymnasium, she marveled.  Heard of these.   You should use it every day, Rak said.  Make you stronger.   Kiri thought of the calm, quiet confidence that Starks people all had.  A look in their eyes that said, Mess with me and I will take you down.  She wanted that.   Does Opal do this stuff?  A certain look came into his eyes although his face didnt change.  She does.   Kiri nodded.  Then I will.  Opal is tough, but shes still very  womanly.  Thats how I want to be.  How she would be.   She could tell by Raks look that shed said exactly the right thing.  He nodded.   A strange metal statue stood in one corner, smooth cerametal face blank, long arms down.  The body and limbs were covered with thick padded leather.   What is that? she asked, wrinkling her nose.   Sparring robot.  Mr.  Stark likes to fightgood at it, too.  You leave it alone.  Things dangerous if you dont know what youre doing.   No problem.   Rak moved to the center of the room.  Now show me how they grabbed you last night.   Kiri flushed, humiliated by how easy it had been.  Shed thought herself tough and wary, but it hadnt been hard for the smaller woman to grab her and shove her into that room.  She kept her eyes open on the street, but in the club shed foolishly thought herself safe.   Rak held up his hand.  Remember how you feel right now, he told her.  You let me and Mr.  Stark and Opal teach you, and youll never feel like that again, okay?  Helpless, angry and unable to retaliateshe never, ever wanted to feel like this again.  Kiri set her jaw, accepted the emotions roiling inside her, and nodded.  Im ready.   At the end of their session, Kiri was breathing hard, her side hurt and she was going to have bruises on her arms and legs.  But she glowed with accomplishment.  Shed learned to react instantaneously to an attack from behind or the side.  Howd I do?  Rak set his hands on his lean hips.  You got a long ways to go, but youre a scrapper.  Time we get through with you, anyone who jumps you will be sorry.   Maybe I should carry a cutter.  Shed had one once, but broken it prying a coffee container open.   Rak shook his head.  Take too long for me to show you how to use one, and they can be turned on you in a heartbeat.  Got another idea that might work.   Tomorrow? she asked.   He shrugged.  Sure.  We can have a session every morning.  You want to go anywhere today?  Yes.  Kiri grinned at his look of resignation.  No more shopping, I promise.  I need to open up my coffee stand today at the space port.         Stark sent her a hololink as she was standing in the huge closet.  A hot shower-dry and some of her new lotions and cosmetics had taken care of her remaining soreness from the workout.   She smiled, delighted at the sight of Stark, seated in a private hotel room with a bouquet of some exotic blooms behind his shoulder.  He wore a silk robe, his hair damp, and a steaming mug sat on the table before him.   He smiled back at her, his gaze dropping over her, clad only in a towel.  Sleep late?  She shook her head.  Just finished a session with Rak in your gym.  Hes teaching me some self-defense moves.   Is that why youve a bruise on your arm?  Kiri rubbed the spot with her other hand, self-conscious.  No, that would be from the night before when that bitch had shoved her.   Its nothing.  Shed had worse in the public care dorms.   Natan has therapeutic gesics there.  Use them.  Why the sudden interest in self-defense?  She moved restively, standing with one foot on top of the other.  Im sure youve already had a report from Rak, so why ask me?  He took a drink of coffee, watching her over the rim, making her wait.  Id like your version of events.   Just an old acquaintance who didnt realize Im with someone else, she said.  She moved over the rack of clothing, pushing one ensemble aside.   Tal Darkrunner is an old acquaintance?  Kiri stared at him over her shoulder, cold shivering down her spine.  You know him?  He held her gaze with his.  I know of him.  I make it my business to know a great many beings, especially those who may . . .  impact what is mine.   Did he mean his businesses literally, or did he mean her? He doesnt.  I told him I dont want to see him anymore.   Good.  Im sure you wont mind if I have a word with him myself.   No.  Her face heated as he gave her a look.  I mean, hes not important enough for you to bother with.  Worse, God only knew what kind of outrageous things hed say, just to piss Stark off.  Probably tell him what theyd done and how many times.   Stark nodded, but she had the uneasy sense it didnt mean he was agreeing to back off.   He took another drink of coffee.  Kitten, that towel is covering up parts of you I would very much like to admire.  Take it off.   Heat flushed over her skin.  Now there was a change of subject.  One she was only too relieved to accept.  Still turned three quarters away from him, Kiri unfastened the towel and let it slip to the floor.   His gaze slid down over her bare body, lingering on her ass.  He sipped his coffee.  Now turn around.   Two could play at this game.  Kiri cast him a sultry glance over her shoulder.  Sorry.  Im getting dressed, not putting on a sex show for you.   She opened the drawer in front of her and grabbed a pair of spider lace panties.  They were cream with black scallop trim.  Her heart pounding, she stepped into them and pulled them up, rolling her hips to settle the panties.   She fumbled into the matching bra, feeling the heat of his gaze on her.  When she had the undies on, she turned, cocking her hip saucily.   He had one hand on the table, playing with something that glinted in the lights of his stateroom.  You do know youll be punished for that.  His eyes held the hint of a smile.   Kiri eyed him suspiciously.  What do you have there?  He lifted his hand, and a delicate gold chain dripped from his grasp.  At the end was a pair of golden balls that rolled lightly over the table.  Foreboding tightened in her middle.   A little something I picked up here, he said.  As promised.  Youll wear it for me.  Wont you, kitten?  It was the toy hed promised heror threatened her withthe one designed to be worn inside her.  Kiri had a sudden searing image of them seated at Jasmine, surrounded by other diners and waitstaff.  All hed have to do was tug gently on that chain, and those balls would move in her pussy.  Hed probably tease her until she was mindless with lust.  Quark, she was going to have to go and touch herself now.  Otherwise shed be twitchy for hours, just thinking about it.   She shrugged casually.  Guess it will give you something to dream about while youre in a meeting.   He chuckled, a dark and wicked sound.  Yes, it will.   Oh, God, if she was there in that room with him, shed climb onto his lap and ride him until the tight throbbing between her thighs was assuaged, and he forgot all about his dirty toys.   There are a variety of toys in my bedside cabinet, he suggested, his voice gentle.  Youre clearly aroused by the prospect of this device, so feel free to go and play.  In fact, Id like to watch.   Kiri opened her mouth but no words came out.  The man was incorrigible, and there was no way shed admit the idea of him watching her aroused her so much she wanted to squirm.   Stark smiled at her, and she had to press her thighs together, standing there under his knowing gaze.   Go on, get something and bring it back, kitten, he advised gently.   She gazed back at him, heat racing through her, pulling her pussy in a nearly desperate ache.  Ill be  right back, she managed.   Kiri left her comlink sitting on a hovertray and padded into Starks bedroom.  A single glowlamp came to life, the soft light swirling in the beautiful globe.  The big bed waited, the broad expanse dark and inviting.  Kiri looked around at the built-in cabinets of fine burlwood.  A tall narrow one had been fitted into the space beside the far side of the bed.   Her hearting thudding with excitement, she walked around the bed and opened the door.  The cupboard had a series of drawers.  She chose one at random and frowned, bewildered.  On a bed of charcoal velvet lay a group of balls of different sizes.  They were translucent, and jostled by the opening of the drawer, they began to glow.   Kiri touched one hesitantly, and a warm current buzzed into her skin.  She flinched.  But the spark had not been truly painful, just startling.  She touched another, smaller ball and received a lesser current.  She pulled her hand away and eyed the larger balls with a mixture of fear and low, clenching excitement.  Reminded her of drinking blue stars.   Youll enjoy those, Stark said behind her.   Kiri whirled, feeling guilty as if shed been caught in wrong-doing.  You followed me.   The hovertray bearing her comlink floated a few feet away, and Stark smiled at her from the holovid, leaning back relaxed in his chair.  You disobeyed me.  Since Im not there to spank you, this is the next best thing.  Now take off your bra.   She glared at him for a moment, wanting to hurl the comlink across the room and see how he liked that.  But his admiring gaze was like the current from the ballsit made her want to play, even through the sting of embarrassment.   Do it, kitten.   With him watching every move, Kiri unfastened her bra and let it slip from her arms.  Under his gaze, her breasts tightened, her nipples peaking into hard points.  Then she waited.   Take the drawer out, and set it on the bed, he ordered.  Then lie back on the bed.  Legs open for me.  Mm, thats lovely.  The panties are a tease.   Kiri did as he instructed, and the hover table followed her, floating above her knees.  She smoothed her hands nervously down her thighs.  Her palms were damp, and her pussy was throbbing with need, her panties rasping against her labia like bonds.   Now, take one of the smaller balls and slip it gently into your cunt.   Her pussy spasmed.  Her body was certain even if she wasnt.  She licked her lips.  Are you sure it wont hurt?  It may sting just a little.  He pulled his robe open, and the holocam moved back so that she could see his cock, lying hard and flushed against his abdomen.  Theyre electroplasm.  Capable of conveying a current, but not enough to harm.  Very pleasurable, Im told.  And it will please me very much to watch you.   Other women had told him.  How many other women had he watched do this, while he stroked himself with one hand as he was now, watching her with complete unselfconsciousness? Didnt matter, she was here now.  And she wanted him focused on her.   Kiri.  His voice snapped her into action before thought.  She leaned up on one elbow and reached into the drawer.  Grasping one of the smallest balls, Kiri held it in her fingertips for a sec.  The slight current and heat felt good.  Her pussy clenched with excitement at the idea of feeling it inside her.   Do you want to do it for me? Stark asked, watching her face.   Yes, she admitted, heat flushing her cheeks and down across her chest.   Yes, he echoed, approval warming his eyes.  Thats my little cat.   He watched as she reached down and stroked the ball inside her panties and down along her swollen, wet labia.  It slipped inside with slick ease, and she pressed it deeper, thrusting her fingers inside herself.  Inside her, the ball vibrated to life.  Kiri moaned.  Logan, its m-moving.   Heat, humming delicately inside her.  She needed to come, needed to stroke herself.   Thats just the current.  Add another.  The next larger one.   Her hand shaking, Kiri selected the next larger ball and slipped it into her pussy with the other.  More heat and more current.  She whimpered, her eyes falling shut.  It felt as if the balls were dancing slowly against each other.  Logan.  Theyretheyre petting me.   Good.  Would you like to come for me?  Her eyes flew open.  He was lying back in his chair, palming his cock languidly, a flush of color on his high cheekbones, his eyes hooded.  He looked like a beautiful, decadent ruler, and she wished she were the one with her hands on his cock.   Yes.  She wanted to come for him, wanted his eyes on her.   Use your fingertips.  Touch yourself very slowly.  Kiri did as he instructed.  With her legs splayed open for him, she pulled the narrow band of the panties aside and stroked her fingertips into her wetness and up over her swollen clitoris.  Pleasure gathered under her touch and inside her where the balls vibrated.   Slowly, he chided when her touch quickened.   Oh, please, Kiri choked, her voice husky in her dry throat.  I need to . . .  faster.   Hmm.  Will you wear the belt for me? To a social function, I think.   Yes, she whimpered.  Shed promise him anything, if only hed let her come now.   Very well.  Touch yourself more quickly.  Open your eyes.  Look at me while you come.   Gazing into his gray eyes, Kiri stroked fast, her fingers jerking over her clitoris and her hips moving, her feet arching, toes curling tight as the pleasure tightened until it imploded inside her, her pussy spasming deliciously around the balls.  She showed him every nuance of her joy.  And part of it was surrendering to him.   She let her head drop back and a husky laugh bubbled up, catching in her throat.  That was so weird.  But delicious.  Her body hummed with pleasure.   Oh, youre not finished, kitten.   Kiri opened her eyes.  He was still stroking himself, harder now, his cock glistening with ointment from the small bottle that stood on the table beside him.   Youre going to come for me again, he told her.  Take the largest ball.  Now, Kiri.   The ball sat in her hand, heat shimmering through her palm and up her arm.  Whoa, this one was powerful and a little scary.  Blue Stars.   Put it in your panties.   That wont fit inside me.  And she was not going to try.  It would hurt, and she did not do pain.  At least she was pretty sure she didnt.  Cant I just watch you now?  Youre not done.  Lodge it against your clitoris.  The panties will hold it there.   Kiri slipped the ball into her panties, where it perched on her mons.  She snickered.  It looks like I have a little penis in there.   Not from here, he assured her, his voice rough.  You look like a lovely, sensual creature being fucked by light.   The ball was glowing.  Heat flowed from it, and it began to vibrate subtly, as if reacting to her skin.  She moaned as the heat crackled softly against her swollen clitoris, and the smaller balls answered inside her.   Beautiful, he approved.  Intense, isnt it?  Yes, she gasped.  Oh! The currents getting stronger.  It stings.  Logan, I need She didnt know what she needed, only that she was going to come again, in spite of the sting, or maybe because of it.  You.  I wish you were here with me.   Take the two medium balls, he said, his voice hoarse.  I want you to stroke your nipples with them.   I need to come, she groaned.  And then she needed to get the balls away from her.   Youll come when I tell you.  Youre mine, little cat.   She looked into his eyes.  Yes.  In this moment she was, as surely as if he were in the room with her, holding her physically.  She touched the two remaining balls to her nipples.  The balls seemed to ignite each other.  Sharp prickles of pain and pleasure arced through her, from her nipples, across her skin, and deep inside her pussy, and out along her clitoris.  She whimpered, on the edge of orgasm, on the edge of bolting.  Logan!  Now, Stark said.  Come for me, Kiri.  His voice was like a velvet whip, cracking through her.  She came so hard a scream ripped from her throat.   At last the current died and let her fall back, spent.   She let the balls fall from her hands and cupped her breasts.  They felt tender, almost bruised.  Wincing, she pushed the ball away from her panties and then sat up.  She wrinkled her nose.  The other two were still inside her like a naughty secret, but at least they were quiet now  Stark lay back in his chair, his robe closed again, that warm light in his eyes, a smile on his mouth for her.  Thank you, kitten.   She blushed, her face and chest burning.  Then the absurdity of the situation struck her, and laughter bubbled up again.  When his eyes twinkled, she laughed even harder.  It felt good, a release of the tension of being coaxed into putting on his private sex show.  Hed talked her into playing with toys that were as painful as they were pleasurable, and he wasnt even here, not really.   I wanted to watch you, too, she complained, curling onto her side, hugging a pillow since she couldnt hold him.   He smiled at her over his coffee mug.  I enjoyed myself.  An unforgettable performance.   A performance.  That stung in a different way.  Kiri wrapped her arms more tightly around the pillow, kicking the largest ball away as it rolled against her leg.  You are deleting this link, right?  He took another drink of coffee.  If you were here, you wouldnt have to worry about that, would you? Now, Ive a meeting, and I find I need another shower-dry.  Stay out of trouble for the rest of the day, hmm?  Stark! The link.  She would not be just another sex show for him.   He shook his head.  Stop worrying, kitten.  What happens between us is private, unless we decide differently.  Now, theres another gift waiting for you.  On your work station.   Kiri eyed him suspiciously.   An employment agency, he told her with a smirk that told her he knew exactly what shed been thinking.  Theyre at your disposal.  The employment rosters are easily accessible so you can find someone you like.   Thank you, she managed.  I havent forgotten my promise.   He nodded.  Good.  Because I never forget any promise made to me.   She believed him, and that he would use this to manipulate and manage his businesses and people.  Stark reality.   Call Natan for anything else you want.  And dont leave the penthouse without Rak, hmm?  Kiri nodded.  That was easy enoughshe hated riding the airbuses.  Being piloted in a fancy new slider was starry, and she liked Rak.   The holovid winked out, leaving her there alone in the quiet of his bedroom, surrounded by the detritus of sex play with Stark.   She slipped off the bed, unease prickling through her in a sting that echoed the balls.  Logan Stark could talk her into nearly anything, it seemed.  She needed to be very careful of that.        19  Kiris new work station was small, sleek and fast.  It answered even whispered voice commands and brought up flat or holovid images of clarity that made her laugh with delight.   She had several messages waiting in her virtual mailbox.  She leaned her chin on her hand and scrolled through the hololinks.  Most were sales, two were from casual friends whod seen her on the news and wanted details, and two were important enough to answer immediately.  She began with the link from her coffee supplier and friend, Illyria Tate.   A pretty blonde in a neat business suit appeared on the holovid, sitting in a small office, a steaming mug of coffee at her elbow.  A window behind her revealed a large space that Kiri knew was her warehouse.  A hoviecart zipped by, piled high with bags of beans.   Kiri, the woman said, her big brown eyes soft with concern.  Are you all right? Saw you on the news, and your stand was closed when I went by to check on you today.   Hi, Illyria.  Things have been  a bit weird.  Kiri filled the woman in on the broad details of the murder, losing her apartment.   Illyrias look of concern deepened.  Do you need credit? I could help you.   Kiri shook her head.  Dont wanna get you in trouble.   Illyria flushed.  I have credit of my own.  Father doesnt control that.   Thanks, but Im fine, Kiri insisted.  She explained about meeting Stark, and his rescue.   Stark? Logan Stark? The other woman leaned so far forward Kiri worried she would fall over her desk.  LodeStar Enterprises Logan Stark?  Kiri nodded.  Wow, Stark was famous in certain circles.   Illyria let out a shriek of delight, tossing back her blonde curls.  Oh, I cant believe it.  And he rescued you, youre with him now, hesoh, I cant believe it.  This is so-oo moonbeamish! And you look starry, by the way.  Love that little sweater, is that spider lace?  Kiri could feel herself blushing, but she grinned.  Um, yeah.  She stroked her hand down over her clinging gold top and leggings.  So the good news is, I have credit to buy coffee.   Wonderful, although next time you tell me you dont have the credit and well work something out, understood?  Kiri nodded, her heart swelling.  Understood.   Illyria nodded.  So dishwhats Stark like? Is he as, um, hot as he appears? Ive seen him at city business functions.   Kiri just smiled.  She was not talking about Stark and sex in the same conversation.   But her expression was evidently enough.  The blonde sighed, one hand to her bosom.   Fabulous.  So many men are all show and no substance.  Like a decaffeinated bean, you know? Her arching brows lowered, indicating she might be thinking of one man in particular.   Then she tossed her hair back again.  I suppose wed better get back to business.  How can I help you?  With great satisfaction, Kiri placed an order for a supply of Pangaean coffee, both light and dark.  Illyria nearly burbled with joy at Kiris interest in the more expensive products, and when she invoked Starks name for the bill, the woman promised a delivery that very afternoon of a better grade of beans, along with a top-grade variety Kiri simply had to try.   Kiri hesitated, and then interrupted the womans effusive plans.  Thanks, Illyria, but I dont think itd be very wise for me to go top grade.  My customers cant afford that.   Sweetie, the other woman breathed.  With Stark behind you, you can afford to move.  Rent space in the newest, best area of the space port.  Give those MoonPenny bastards a run for their credit.   Kiri raised her brows.  The woman was practically bristling, her brown eyes as hot as the brew she sipped as she waited for Kiri to answer.   I take it the owner wasnt interested in your product, Kiri guessed.   Illyria snorted, taking another drink of coffee.  Marc Moon? Smooth bastard.  Not only did he refuse to talk business, he then proceeded to proposition me.   For sex? Hed put the moves on during a sales call? No way.   Whaddya think?  Wow.  Thats low, Kiri murmured.  But also easy to believe.  Illyria was very pretty, and she had a great figure, much more voluptuous than Kiris own.  So what did you say to him?  The blondes eyes narrowed with satisfaction over her cup.  I shoved my large sample bag of top-grade fresh-roasted Pangaean dark coffee beans in his sculpted abs and told him to fuck that, because hed never have me.   Oh, wow, Kiri breathed.  Wish I couldve seen that.   I was pretty good, Illyria agreed.  But, I not only didnt get the contract, I pissed off the owner of the largest chain of coffee stands in New Seattle, so all in all  She waggled her hand as if balancing scales.  My father is not going to be happy.   Totally worth it, Kiri assured her.  Your reply will reign in the annals of womankind forever.   Illyria smiled crookedly.  Thanks.  I needed that.  And on the upside, when you open your huge chain of competing stands, youll buy all your beans from me, right?  Absolutely.  Illyrian Bean is my supplier, no matter what.   Excellent.  Ill have your product to you in a few hours.  Where shall I have them delivered?  Kiri gave her Starks address.  They said goodbye.  Next, Kiri spent a little time perusing advertisements for several other upscale coffee purveyors, including the wildly successful MoonPenny chain.   Illyria was right, if she wanted to upgrade seriously, shed have to move.  She allowed herself to daydream a bit about keeping her small shop open for the discount travelers and those who needed an occasional free coffee, and opening a large, glossy, upscale stand in the newer section of space port near the LodeStar commercial docks.   Lot of wealthy travelers on and off Starks ships.  Heck, maybe they could even subsidize a coffee and soup kitchen in the poor end of the port.   Her new comlink was programmed with Logans link as well as Jasmine, Maitresse, and a few others she didnt recognize.  Should have knownthe man had a mind like a computer, ranging far and fast, taking care of things she hadnt had time to realize she might want.   She took great pleasure in erasing the link to Maitresse.  She wouldnt be shopping at that spiteful bitchs store any more.   Then she looked at the second link waiting in her virtual mail.  She rose from her chair, and paced restlessly to the windows to look out at the dark, foggy day, leaning her forearms on the window glass.  The cold seeped through the lace covering her arms.  Shed need more credit for that one and she wasnt sure how much Stark would let her borrow.   But Stark had family, brothers anyway.  Hed understand why she needed the credit, wouldnt he? She hated asking him for it.  Theyd agreed on the loan for her business, but this was another matter entirely.  And if she waited until she had the credit herself, it might be too late.   It might already be too late, hissed an all too familiar voice inside her.  She felt the brush of wings beginning to unfurl inside her, and shoved away from the window, turning to pace back and forth the length of the big room.  Quark, if she were really the cat Stark liked to call her, shed pounce on the fear and rip its head off with her teeth and claws.   She couldnt do that, but she would not let fear win.  Kai was out there, somewhere.  And she was going to find him.   She flung herself back into her chair, and concentrated fiercely on the work at hand.  This she could do right now, concrete and definite.  Shed deal with the rest later.   Bringing up the holodisplay of the employment agency, she stared at the soothing, professional smiles of the reps.  Logan Stark thought of everything.  And he wanted to control everything.  If she accepted an employee from the agency hed directed her toward, how did she know that person wouldnt really be working for Stark, instead of her? She didnt.   She curled her legs up into the chair, and wrapped her arms around her knees.  Logan Stark had powerful charisma, and he knew it.  Hed compelled her from the sec she met him.  She couldnt walk away from him nowshe craved him and his outrageous sexual play, even more than she wanted his credit.   But she had to keep her guard up.  He knew too much about her as it was, even her association with Tal.  Not that Kiri wanted to continue to associate with the ganger, especially after last night, but she chose her own friends.   Kiri scowled at the computer.  It wasnt that she didnt trust Stark on a personal level, because she did.  But give him a chance, and hed take her over like a business, managing her life as was most convenient for him, until he tired of her.  Stark realitysimply arrange everything the way he wanted it.   Who could she trust who was unconnected with him? She had friends, but they all worked, some of them off planet for much of the time.  She could think of one person who was always around and who could use a comfortable post.   She made the call.  Kiri smiled at the familiar face on her hololink.  Maury, Ill be opening my stand this afternoon.  Would you come and have a coffee with me?        Rak picked her up in the slider.  Kiri sat beside him, wondering if shed have a chance for the newness of sliding about in a small private craft to wear off.  She watched Rak manipulate the controls with calm expertise.   I really would love to learn to fly one of these, she commented.   He cornered them around an industrial block, following another craft, and avoiding an airbus lumbering along in the lane just below.  Have to talk to Mr.  Stark about that.   Kiri shrugged, accepting that.  She was in Starks world, everything flowed through him.   It was fun now diving down to the private docks at the space port.  Kiri watched the dock with the big star glimmering above it grow clearer through the dirty fog.  Theres Starks dock, she realized.  Shed been flown in and out of here before in his cruiser.   Yup.  LodeStar, Rak said.   She watched with fascination as they hovered over the platform, and then landed lightly, and taxied in under the graceful awning.  Rak stopped the slider right at the end of the podway, and the hatch slid open, revealing the walkway.   Got something for you, he said, reaching into a cubby on the dash.   Kiri took the small device.  It looked like a silver-toned tube of lip gloss but heavier.   What is it?  A shocker.  Keep it with you at all times.  Anyone gets too close that you dont like the look of, you pretend youre gonna pretty up.  But for the Great Gods sake, dont touch this round end to your own skin.  You touch them with it, and I promise you, theyre going down.   Starry.  She examined it.  Press this part here?  No, twist it.  That way it cant be zapping you by accident in your pocket.  You got pockets, dont you? He eyed her soft black knit leggings and gold fitted top with misgivings.   Kiri grinned.  So much for sex appealhe just wanted to know if she could hide weapons.   I do.  She examined the shocker and then tucked it into the pocket hidden in the seam of her top.   Okay.  Lets go, he said.  I got your beans.  Ill bring them and then go take care of some other business.  I wont be too far away.  You link me when youre ready to go.   Kiri walked onto the concourse with nerves pinging.  Her lessons in self-defense and carrying the shocker reminded her sharply that danger could come from any direction.   She half expected to find news cameras or crowds dawdling.  Instead, there were only the usual throngs of passengers passing to and fro.  The bar across the way was open, although the gambling kiosk was still shuttered.   Rak stowed her bags of coffee beans and then stood by as she powered up her coffee machine.  She ground some of her new coffee beans and poured them in to brew.   Illyria had included a gift of new disposable mugs with Illyrian Beans logo emblazoned on one side, Kiris Kaffe on the other.  Kiri set them proudly in the racks, ready to grab when customers ordered.   Rak stood on the other side of her counter, legs spread, arms crossed as she worked.   You dont go anywhere else without me, he reminded her gruffly.   Hey, Ive had this place for over a year.  And today the areas crawling with heroes.  Kiri waved her hand airily at the open bar across the concourse, where a trio of InterGalactic Space Forces pilots sat with mugs of ale.  One of them smiled at Kiri, and his companions turned to look.  She smiled back, because the pilots might come over and buy a coffee after they were finished drinking.  She wished Rak would stop the lecturing.  He was creeping her out, and she had a business to run.   Rak was not finished.  There are no nice areas on this damn planet, specially not in this old area of the port.  And with all the rioting, you never know.  Slavers have been sniffing around, too.   I know they have, believe me.  Ill be fine here.  Kiri opened her refrigerator unit to check on her supply of soy creamer.  Good, she had some vanilla, some sweetnut, and even gremel fruit.  She didnt understand how anyone could put fruit flavor in their coffee, but it sold, so she kept it on hand.   Straightening, Kiri waved a cheerful hand around her stand, showing that she had her coffee machine running, and she was ready to work.  You want a coffee? she asked.  My new stuff is pretty good.  Bet you like sweetnut creamer.   Drink my coffee black.   Got it.  She poured him a large cup, snapped cover on and handed it over.   Thanks.  How much?  She gave him a look.  No charge for my fight instructor.   He didnt smile, but she was sure she saw a slight softening in his weathered face.  Thanks.  Stay put.   Coffee in hand, he stepped on a lift and zipped up to the hoverway.  As soon as his gray-clad figure was out of sight, Kiri walked back out onto the concourse with her own coffee and stood out of the way of traffic, under the hoverway.   She sipped her coffee, which was very good, rich and dark, mellowed by the soy creamer.  So good, in fact, that for a moment she worried Illyria had somehow mixed up her order and shipped top-grade beans.  Then she shook her head.  The supplier was too good a businesswoman to make that mistake.   She studied her kiosk, imagining the improvements she was going to make.  Not too much, but definitely a new holovid sign, larger than the one she had now and with some rich, bright colors.  And maybe a new rack for snacks and baked goods, so customers got an eyeful of irresistible confections.   To the left of her kiosk ran a solid wall, with port infrastructure behind it.  On the right an empty shop, larger than hers, was closed and barred.  If only the space had a business in it that would attract more customers to stop, shop and then have a coffee.   Perhaps if her upgrade was successful, another business would be attracted to the area.  She caught a glimpse of movement in the shadowed depths of the space and paused to watch.  Starry, maybe someone was looking it over now.  Weird they didnt have the lights on, though.   Maybe she should call the port police.  Yeah, and wouldnt they be glad to hear from her.  Shuddering at the thought of having to deal again with a skeptical helmet, Kiri strode back into her shop and busied herself powering up her coffee machine and creating a new, just slightly higher price list.   Maury appeared with her cart just as Kiri was pouring herself a second cup of the new brew.   The older woman leaned one elbow on the counter and inhaled.  That smells good.   Kiri grinned.  It should, its a better grade.  What flavor will you have?  Sweetnut, please.  Maury folded up the handle of her cart and flipped up a seat.  She perched on it with a sigh, tucking her wrap around her.  Ah, that feels good.   Kiri handed her a steaming mug of coffee liberally laced with creamer.  How would you like a job that didnt involve so much walking?  Maury took a sip of hot coffee and hmmed with surprised pleasure.  My, that is tasty.  She regarded Kiri curiously over her cup.  What sort of position?  Running this place.   The older womans lovely, tired eyes widened.  Oh, my.   Within a short time, the two women had decided on a mutually satisfying trial business deal.  Maury would learn the coffee business and, if after a few weeks both of them were happy, take over running the stand for Kiri at least part time, with the right to sell her curios on one small display rack.  In return, Kiri would allow Maury to train her niece Fava to help in the stand.   If it worked out, theyd begin keeping the stand open continuously.  Business was slower at night, but if they built a rep as always there for the weary traveler, it might pick up.  Kiri didnt share her dream that someday theyd even compete with MoonPenny.  That was for latermuch later.   Kiri would furnish Maury and Fava with new smocks.  Since Stark was paying their wage, Kiri felt able to offer a good one.  They would also talk to the bakery on the next concourse about stocking some of their less-expensive treats.   My niece is very artistic, Maury said.  Perhaps a new logo ?  Kiri nodded.  Shes welcome to try.   Maury toasted her with her cup.  Thank you, my dear.  Youve no idea what this means to me.  My nephew is just out of trade school and unemployed.  He can take over my cart business.   Thank Stark.  Kiri nodded wryly at the holovid unfolding over the center of the concourse, where Stark and his phalanx of pilots stood tall, conquerors of space.  I find myself doing that a lot lately.   Maury twinkled.  Ill bet you do.   Kiri blushed.   Maury walked away with a determined set to her thin shoulders and a spring in her step.  Kiri smiled to herself.  She was not only getting an employee she could trust, but Starks credit would make Maurys life easier.   Time to use his credit again.  She activated her comlink.  Sam Finder, she said.        20  A man smiled into Kiris holocam.  His clothing was neat but faded, his thinning hair a grayed blond.   The holovid came to life, with the same man facing her from a dark background shimmering with the glaring colors of a gambling den.  He looked tired, rumpled, and somewhat irritated to be disturbed.  Ms.  te Nawa? What is it?  Kiri stared at him.  Mr.  Finder? Where are you?  He looked chagrined, then shook his head.  Ah, following up a lead for a client.  My work takes me many places, you know that.   She nodded.  Hed shared with her over the years some of the unsavory places hed been, chasing leads for her.   What can I do for you, young lady? You know I cant, ah, continue to work for you without more credit on your account.  Im sorry, but I have to make a living.   Kiri waved her hands, brushing aside his concern.  I know, you kept working long after my credit was gone.  But I have more, enough for you to travel to Serpentia.  Remember you thought perhaps Kai had been taken there?  He stared at her.  You do? II mean, yes, I did.  And thats great.  He glanced around surreptitiously and then got to his feet.  Lets take this outside.  Ill link back soon.   Okay.   Kiri blew out a frustrated breath.  She understood he didnt want to talk about a private case where others might hear, but after waiting this long, she wanted instant action.   As she waited, she watched the space port passengers traversing the concourse.  A human family passed by, luggage cart close behind them.  A father, mother and two children, each with their hands securely held by a parent.  As they passed, the younger boy pulled on his mothers hand, pointing at a bright holovid of toys further along.  The mother held tightly to his hand, shaking her head.  But the man said something that made both boys laugh.   Kiri watched them until they disappeared.  Her hands hurt, and she looked down.  She was gripping them together so hard they were bloodless and aching.  With an exclamation that was nearly a sob, she uncurled them and flexed them, working out the soreness.   This time, she promised herself.  This time, her search would get results.  Sam Finder would live up to his name and find Kai.  She refused to believe otherwise.  And then theyd be a family again, at least the two of them.   Ah, at last, said a stout woman, stopping on the other side of Kiris counter.  Coffeethe largest one you have.  Ive been up for twenty hours and another flight to catch.   Right away, said Kiri, already pulling the largest disposable cup and sliding it under the spout of her machine.  Flavor?  Ill have that sweetnut.  Mind you put plenty in.  No skimping.  The woman paid her new price without batting an eye, and Kiri smiled at the two Barillians who stepped up as soon as the woman walked away.  Caffeine was a universal need.   Two large gremel crmes.   Great choice, she approved politely.  Enhances the flavor of the Pangaean light perfectly.   She slid into her patter and for the next hour, served tired, grumpy customers coming off one of the big discount flights.  Rak appeared, and she poured him another cup without being asked.   Thanks.  He took an appreciative sip.  How much longer you gonna be?  Give me another half hour.  Nearly her usual closing time.   He nodded.  Ill wait over there.  He indicated a bench under the hoverway near a cluster of faux plants  Finder linked back, and Kiri walked into the back corner of her stand to speak with him.  She didnt need passersby or Starks pilot hearing her private business.   The detective was in an old slider now.  He looked even paler than usual, and though he smiled professionally, his eyes were tight as if he were in pain.   Are you okay? she asked.   Ill be fine.  Just a bit of a dustup with the, uh, security at the club.   Did you call the police? she asked.  They cant treat citizens like that.   No, no, he assured her bravely.  When Im on a case, I have to be willing to take my hard knocks.  Anything for my clients.  Now, about your renewed credit.   Kiri nodded.  I have plenty.  And I want you to follow up that lead you told me about.   His eyes widened.  You want me to go to Serpentia?  She nodded again, triumphant at his look of respect.  I do.   He nodded back eagerly.  Thats grand.  I can, er, leave tomorrow, in fact.  Best to leap on the tail of the comet, as it were.   Link me where to send the credit.   I will.  The investigator looked at her, his weary face softening.  You are a remarkable young woman, Ms.  te Nawa.  Well find him this time.   Okay.  As she broke the link, Kiri swallowed to tamp down the wild hope that flooded her.  Too soon for that, much too soon.  Shed done what she could, now shed stay busy building up her business, so that shed be ready.   And Stark would be home inshe consulted her linkfour hours.  She smiled to herself.  Oh, yeah.  That she was definitely ready for.         Back on the Arcturus, his business in New Asia concluded, Stark accepted a moon brandy from Opal and checked his comlink.  There were several link requests waiting.   Stark linked Bronc Berenson first.  The big man sat in a slider, a landing pad visible behind him.   Bronc.  What do you have for me?  Sir.  Found out who owns the New Seattle club where the ex-soldiers were shanghaied.  Place called The Flash.   Ive heard of it.  Who owns it?  Ganger whos done real well for himself.  Darkrunner, Tal Darkrunner.   Stark set his glass down hard enough that the hovertray beside him wavered, the brandy sloshing in the glass.  Anger and something else, a slick tendril of unease fought in his gut.   Berenson waited, his gaze not missing a thing.   I want to talk to him, as soon as you can set it up.   Berenson nodded.  Yes, sir.   Stark held up one hand in a gesture to wait.  He had nothing to gain by keeping secrets from his security chief.  The man was like a cerametal safehe would no more reveal confidential information than he would try to fly without a slider.   Darkrunner and I have  a mutual acquaintance.  He related Kiris recent encounter with the ganger, and what he knew of her past history with the ganger.   The two men exchanged a long look.   I need to know if he is involved in this, Stark said.  If hes profiting from slave running, I want him taken down, hard.  Slavers were among the most despicable creatures in the universe, and if he had the chance to put even one out of business, hed celebrate.  Thank God his people had saved at least a few beings from a hellish fate.   You and me both, sir.  Are you  concerned that she may be involved?  Not really, Stark said, and meant it.  I believe I know her character.  But Id be a fool not to have you follow this connection.   I understand.  Ill be discreet.   I know you will.  Get back to me as soon as you have anything.   You can count on it, sir.   Stark broke the link.  He reached for his brandy and drained it in one gulp.  It burned down his throat and settled in his gut, warming his insides.   He shook his head at his own doubts.  He was an excellent judge of characterhard won through years of reading business opponents and potential associates.  Kiri was not Adora Crest, just a woman whod had a series of hard knocks in her life and done the best she could.  So she had one past lover who was unsavoryhe did as well.   He answered the link from Haassea next.  His mood already bleak, he was not pleased with what she had to say.   After soothing her ruffled scales, he linked Rak.   Trouble? Stark asked dryly.  Let me guess, Ms.  te Nawa.   Not sure, sir, Rak replied.  Just thought youd want to know, she used some of your credit to pay a private investigator.  Overhead her when I arrived at her coffee stand this evening.   Stark scowled.  He wanted to throw back his head and roar in sheer frustration.  What would his unruly little cat want with an investigator? Was she trying to solve the Vulpeans murder or some other reckless scheme? Do you know why?  No, but she bought him a ticket on a flight to Serpentia.  He flies out tomorrow morning.   What the seven hells could Kiri want on Serpentia? Galactic flights were expensive, even on the discount lines.  Have our people get everything they can on him.   Figured youd say that, sir.  Already on it.   Thanks.  Keep an eye on her.   Rak nodded, shifting uncomfortably.  Shes a nice girl.  Hard worker.   The hardened warrior was not cut out to be a spy.  Guardian, yes.   This is for her protection, Stark reminded Rak.  Trouble  has a way of finding her.  The more I know about her activities, the better chance I have of keeping her safe.   Im giving her self-defense lessons.   Excellent.  Or at least so Stark hoped.  Perhaps everyone around her should now don high-tech armor.  He was beginning to think she was a loose laser charge.   The pilot grimaced.  She asked if Id teach her to fly the slider next.   I think not.  Perhaps when were on a planet with less traffic.  Or when she settled down a great deal.   The pilot sighed with relief.  Yes, sir.   Stark signed off and leaned back in his seat, rubbing the bridge of his nose with thumb and forefinger.  At the moment he felt more like a warden than a man with a new mistress.  This was one of the reasons why he let very, very few beings close.  Business, he could control.  People were much more difficult.   Beginning tonight, he was going to make very, very sure a certain little cat made all this trouble worth his while.        21  Kiri showered and dressed with Chaz Jaguari singing and dancing on her holovid.  She danced her way across the quiet of her bedroom and into the closet to choose an ensemble for the evening.  She was tired, but she felt good.  Shed opened her stand again, had the upgrade underway, and shed renewed her contract with Finder.   She took a sip of the sparkling wine Natan had left for her, and set her glass on the hovertable at her elbow.  She smiled at the small table and amused herself leading it around in a circle with her arm.  She was getting spoiled.   Hmm, what to wear when a sexy man was going to be taking her clothing off or at least commanding her to do so for his pleasure.  She pressed her thighs together and smoothed her hands over her bare breasts, anticipating his touch there.  Her pussy felt swollen and wet already.   She selected a pair of delicate gold lace undies but left the matching bra in the drawer.  She didnt need one just for the evening, and the gold spider lace knit dress hugged her body with clever bands of knit that just covered her breasts and hips.  She toed into the soft gold flats and admired herself in the mirror, running her finger through her hair and then shaking her head at herself.  Her eyes were huge in her flushed face.   A chime sounded, and a soft voice announced, Main door, opening.  Stark arriving.   Kiri hesitated, her toes curling in her slippers.  Should she saunter out slowly? Oh, quark it.   She dashed out into the living area, where Stark was standing by a table, divesting himself of his suit jacket, his back to her.  She watched his broad shoulders appear and then his long back, covered in a charcoal fitted shirt.   She could hear muffled noises from the galley.  Natan preparing dinner.   Hi, she said, her voice cracking.   Stark turned, his eyes narrowing as he looked her over.  Excitement bursting, Kiri ignored his bleak expression to launch herself across the room and into his arms.  She threw her arms around his neck and hiked her legs up around his hips, planting a kiss on his smooth cheek.   He staggered with the impact, and then his arms closed around her, and he took her mouth with his, hard.  His tongue thrust into her mouth.  Well, shed asked for it, hadnt she? Kiri curled her tongue around his, drinking in the taste of Stark, moon brandy and need.   One arm around her waist, his other under her ass, he hauled her tight against him and turned, carrying her across the room.  His cock hardened, riding the soft notch of her labia as he walked.   Kiri tightened her legs on him, whimpering as need furled out from that spot.  She swung through the air, and the leather divan hit her in the ass.   Stark pulled away just enough to look her in the eye, his own hooded, his face taut.  Such an enthusiastic greeting.  I believe you missed me.  There was an edge to his voice that both frightened and thrilled her.  What had she unleashed?  Perched on the back of the divan, she wrapped one leg around the back of his thighs, stroking his neck above his collar in feminine placation.  I did miss you.   Then lets fix that, he said, reaching between them to work his trousers.   Your bedroom, she gulped.  Natans here  Stark kissed her to shut her up, and when his cock slapped against her inner thigh like a hot, silken brand her pussy clenched with excitement and shock.  He was going to have her right here, where Natan might walk out at any time and see them.  But as Starks fingers slid under the edge of her panties in a slick caress, she moaned.   Stark positioned the head of his cock between the outer lips of her pussy and then paused there, lifting his head enough to look at her.  Now? he asked, his hand sliding up to cup her breast through the dress and fondle her, his thumb flicking her nipple.   Kiri nodded, tilting her hips to bring him into her.  Her heart was pounding, and if she didnt get that hot, beautiful cock of his inside her, she was going to melt with sheer frustration.   He pinched her nipple, hard.  I cant hear you, kitten.   Now, she pleaded, not caring that her voice was hoarse, or that she was moving helplessly against him, her heels digging into his ass, his cock caressing her just lightly.  Now, Logan.   He grunted with approval and then slid his arm down to cup her ass in his hand and thrust into her in one long, hard stroke.  Kiri whimpered.  It hurt to take him so fast, her pussy stretched around him, but it was also an exquisite relief to have him inside her, filling her.   Thats right, he said, his voice deep and harsh in her ear.  Ill take you whenever and wherever and however I want, kitten.   He moved, pulling out and then thrusting back in, raking every inch of her clinging channel, possessing her.  Kiri clung to him, shaking with the pleasure as he set a swift, steady rhythm, rocking her on her perch.  She couldnt move, could only hang onto him and take what he gave her.   My luggage will be arriving in a moment, he told her, nipping her ear.  We may be seen.   His voice sent her over the edge.  Pleasure imploded inside her, the succulent strokes of his cock the most perfect sensation shed ever known.  A high moan burst from her throat, and Kiri came, exquisite contractions clasping him in secret.   He fucked her through it, his hands clamped on her bare ass.   We have to move, she gasped, dragging open her eyes.   Oh, no, he said.  I havent come yet.   He watched her as he continued to thrust inside her.  Thats right.  Were not done until I fill you with my cum, little cat.  No matter what happens, no matter who walks through that door.  Do you understand?  His face was flushed, his breathing hard, his eyes glittering.  He was the most beautiful man Kiri had ever seen, ever touched.  And understanding blossomedhe was going to lead her along sensual paths shed never imagined.  And shed follow him.   Yes, Logan.   You like this, dont you? It gets you off, knowing someone may find me having you.   Yes, she did, and that meant she was twisty, but shed worry about that later.  She wanted the whole world to know she was his.  Yes, Logan.   She kissed him, and he thrust so powerfully their flesh slapped together, and she started to come again as a chime sounded, and the soft voice announced.  Main door opening.  Luggage.   Kiri whimpered with shock and Stark groaned, stiffening in her arms.  Kiri buried her face against his chest, shivering with pleasure and shame as he moved slowly inside her, and she came and came around him, even as footsteps and voices sounded in the foyer to her right.   Stark let out a long breath.  Next time perhaps Ill arrange an audience ahead of time.   Kiri let out a squeak of humiliation, and he laughed, a deep rumble under her ear.  Kiri, look.   She shook her head and then jerked in shock as he smacked her bottom sharply.  Look.   He turned her head with his fingers against her cheek.  An elegant screen of carved wood panels shielded the entryway.  Beyond it, Natans voice mingled with that of another man.  Then footsteps sounded again, and the galley door closed.   Theythey didnt see us?  Perhaps.  Or perhaps only Natan saw that we needed privacy.  He pulled out of her and she had to bite back a moan of disappointment at losing him.  Apparently she didnt do a good enough job, because his eyes lit with amusement.  She was too rattled by the whole encounter to waste time worrying about that.   I have to go . . .  freshen up, she muttered.   He patted her bottom as she slid from her perch, leaning against it for a moment to steady her trembling legs.  She watched him fasten his trousers and straighten his shirt, and he leaned down to kiss her.  Yes, go on.  Natan will be here in a moment with drinks.  Unless youd rather wear my cum?  Not when she was going to be vertical for the rest of the evening.  She grabbed her panties from the floor and escaped his teasing smile, hurrying into her lav to deal with the ravages of hot sex.  Her panties were ruined, so she threw them in the recycler.  After cleaning up, she slipped into a fresh pair.   Back in the sitting area, Stark stood by the window, a drink in his hand.  Kiri walked to join him.  She leaned against the window and smiled demurely.   Hello, dear, how was your day?  It certainly has had moments.  He handed her a glass from the hovertray.  She sniffed.  A pear blossom.  Youve been busy while I was gone.   She wasnt quite sure what to make of the look in his eye.  Yes.  I hired someone to work my coffee.   He raised his brows inquiringly.   Maury, she said.  You met her whenwell, at the space port authority station.   Ah.  You didnt use the employment agency.  Is your friend qualified?  Shell do fine.   The galley door chimed, and Kiri hid behind her drink as Natan appeared with the salad tray.  She felt her cheeks heating and peeped at him quickly, then away.  However, Starks butler smiled serenely as he set the small table for them with plates of bright salad and a basket of steaming rolls.  Welcome home, sir.   Thank you, Natan.  Did the special package arrive with my luggage? Stark held out his arm, indicating she should precede him, and Kiri walked to the table, clutching her drink like a talisman.   Natan bowed.  Yes, sir.  Where would you like me to place it?  In my bedroom.  Unpack it, please.  Well want it later.   Very good, sir.  Enjoy your salads.   Kiri slipped into her chair and set her drink aside, looking at the carefully arranged spray of fresh greens and cured olives on her plate.  She wasnt sure she was going to be able to eat a bite, with the butterflies in her belly.  Quarking weird having a servant around all the time.   Eat, Stark said mildly, and she picked up her fork, stabbing randomly.  She put a plump green olive in her mouth and chewed.  It was good, mellow and salty, with some piquant herb in the center.  She tried a bite of lettuce, and that was good too.  She attacked her salad with gusto.   Was your trip a success?  It was.  He forked up some greens.  Im selling off some of my holdings here.   Finished with her salad, she set down her fork and picked up the warm, flaky roll he had given her.  Because of the rioting? What if he moved away entirely, and she never saw him again? She set the bread down.   Eat your roll.  Im simply consolidating.  Part of business is knowing what to get rid of and what to keep.   Natan appeared with soft red wine and plates of steaming pasta in red sauce.  The pasta was plump with cheese and melted in her mouth.  While they ate, Stark spoke idly of business, and asked her a few questions about what she planned for Kiris Kaffe.  Cautiously at first, and then with growing enthusiasm, Kiri outlined her plans for upgrading the stand.  He listened attentively and nodded.   What, no advice from the business magnate? she asked, leaning her chin on her palm.   Not for your business, he said.  It sounds as if you have sound ideas and a plan to carry them out.   She frowned, uneasy.  Then what is it? Something was wrong, she could tell.   He leaned back in his chair, turning his wine glass slowly, a remote look on his face.   On a more personal level, you offended a very old friend, and I want to know why.   She sat up straight, her shoulders tightening defensively.  What? Oh, you mean Haassea?  He nodded imperiously.   Kiri growled under her breath, her hands fisting in her lap.  Your old friend seems to be under the impression thatlet me see, how did her lackey put it? Im a little back-alley whore you picked up for a sex weekend, and they should dress me like one.  Well, guess what? Im not parading my ass around in see-through lace with glitter.   That was a mistake.  The girl has been removed from staff.   Dont care.  Not going back there.   Stark looked down at his wineglass.  He lifted it and took a drink.  Then he looked at her over his glass.  I am accustomed, he said softly, to having my instructions followed.   Kiri bit her lip, the small pain distracting her from the chill in his voice.  So youre allowed your pride but Im not? Starry for you.  Her stomach knotted around her dinner.   I think youll find your reception quite different this time, kitten.  So sheathe your claws.  My business means a great deal to Haassea.  Well be socializing, and people will notice that youre wearing her things.   Kiri wanted to ask if the woman gave him a discount for having his whores advertise her clothing.  But she swallowed the words along with the last of her wine, draining her glass and then saluting him with it.  A mistake, as her stomach rebelled even further.   Okay, you bet.  Anything you say, boss.   She was just another employee, after all.  So shed do what he ordered until her business took off.  And then he could kiss her ass goodbye.   Youve an appointment tomorrow, he said calmly.  And I expect you to behave as the lady I know you can be.   Oh, wow, she breathed, shooting from her chair.  No more time to chat then.  Gotta go watch an etiquette holovid.   He held up his hand when she would have stormed away.  Kiri.  Is there . . .  anything else youd like to share with me?  Oh, quark no.  She batted her lashes at him, ignoring the odd, searching look in his eyes.  I wore some of my new pretty clothes and played with my little coffee stand.  And used his money to search for her hearts desire, but damned if shed share that with Mr.  Galactic Mogul.   He shook his head, looking down at his drink.  Ill see you later, then.   Fine with her.  Not like she wanted to sit around and gaze adoringly at him.         In the mistress room, the door shut behind her, Kiri let out a growl of irritation that echoed off the quiet walls and drapes.  She wanted to smash something, preferably over his thick head.  Arrogant man.  And to think shed been so happy to see him.   Too restless to sit with her angry thoughts, Kiri washed and donned a shell-pink nightgown and robe.  Shed been after the least enticing set of nightwear, but there was no such thing in the collection of his mistresses leftovers, so she merely belted the robe tightly around her waist and stalked into the viewing room, where she brought up a holovid.   She was in the mood for something violent.  Chaz Jaguari had a new action adventure out, in which he was trapped on Serpentia with a beautiful native girl, surrounded by space pirates.  That would do nicely.  Maybe the pirates would murder a business mogul or two.   She fell asleep at the end of the holovid, but woke when she was lifted from her nest and borne in strong arms into Starks bedroom.  She hadnt been carried in . . .  years.  Then she remembered she was angry at him.  When he set her on her feet by his bed, she scowled sleepily.   Go take over an unsuspecting planet or something.  She batted at his hands as he deftly untied her robe.   I have my hands on the only acquisition I want at the moment.  He tugged at her nightgown and she hunched her shoulders protectively.   Im tired.   Youre angry, which is entirely a different matter.  Now give me the damn gown or Ill rip it off.   Go ahead, its yours.   Yes, and so are you, but I dont want to hurt you.  This lii silk is soft, but strong.  Rather like you.   With a huff of disgust, Kiri lifted her arms and let him pull the gown over her head.  He did so, slowly, and then cocked his head, considering her.  You know, I think you need a small reminder of whos in charge here, he mused.   He sank onto the edge of the bed, still clothed, and patted his thigh.  Lie down.  Here.   She glared at him, her hands clenching.  No.   He grinned, his teeth flashing white as he grabbed her arm and gave her a sharp tug.  It didnt hurt, but with her muscles tense she fell over like a statue, landing face down over his hard thighs.  She struggled, letting out a screech, and he smacked her bottom with his palm, hard.  The sound was loud in the quiet room, and it stung.   Ow.  Her breath caught in her throat.  Logan Stark, you are a quarking tyrant.   Yes, he agreed.  I am.  And you are a recalcitrant little wild cat and I did promise you this.  He spanked her again, hitting both bare cheeks with a stinging blow.   Youve caused me a great deal of trouble.  Smack.  And so Im going to take it out of your delectable smack twitching tail.  Smack.   Hurts.  She fought the hot swell of hurt and indignation behind her eyes.  Shed never been spanked before in her life.   He smacked her once more, but then he stroked gently over the stinging places hed left, his touch now tender and soothing.   I believe Ive made my point.   I dont like you, she said, her voice thick.   Yes, you do.  Youre angry and you wanted a fight.  I want something different.  He pulled back the covers, depositing her in the bed.  Then he stood and yanked off his clothes.  He was fully aroused, she saw as she turned to glare at him over her shoulder.   He bared his teeth at her.  Theres only one way through this, kitten, he told her, yanking open the cupboard beside the bed and reaching into one of the drawers. Were going to fuck our way out.  Gah, that sounded like a bad holovid linehe was teasing her.   I should never let you touch me again.  She turned her back on him.  The bed moved under her as he knelt behind her.   Then she flinched as she felt his warm lips against her shoulder.  He pressed a trail of soft kisses across her back, and down.  But you will.        22  Mmm, Stark murmured, tugging the covers down as he kissed the swell of her hip, and then her ass.  Mmm, so pretty and flushed.  I may have to spank you more often.  Seems the perfect way to tame a naughty wildcat.   You wont.  She hated that it felt so good to have him kiss her there, and even better to have his warm hand stroke down her bare leg and urge her onto her back.  And better still to have his warm kisses trail across the flat plane of her belly and into the soft curls on her mons.  But if he thought he was going to tease her, shed knee him.   He didnt.  He attacked her clitoris with expert flicks of his tongue, a quiet growl of approval in his throat as she shivered in his hands.  But when she lifted up to him, begging silently for more, he stopped.  Moving up over her, he raked her with the length of his cock, hard and throbbing again.   Put me inside you, little cat, he said, biting at her lower lip.  She smelled her own scent on him, and she wanted him more than her next breath.   Just fucking? she taunted.  Sure thats twisty enough for you?  Youre right.  What was I thinking? Give me your hands.   Busy.  She curled her hand around his heat, and guided him into her sleek opening.   He thrust deep inside and stilled, waiting.  She gave a growl of frustration.  She needed him to move.  He waited.  She sighed loudly.   Slowly, Kiri lifted her arms, laying them on the pillow over her head.  Starks eyes warmed as he grasped both her wrists in one hand.   Then something closed around them, soft and resilient, yet too strong to fight.  She tipped her head back.  The quarkerhed used soft restraints on her.  They coiled around her wrists like metallic golden snakes against her pale skin.  She eyed him warily to see what else he planned.   Stark leaned on his elbow and surveyed her.  Beautiful.  Thank you for reminding me.  I purchased them especially for you.   He bent to kiss her breasts, each in turn.  Kiri lay under him, open and pliant.  Gah, why did she give in to him every time? Stark came down over her, but he startled her by sliding his arms under the crooks of her knees and then moving forward so that his forearms were planted on the bed, and he held her wide open to him.  It was disconcerting and embarrassing.   Just right, he approved.   Logan.  She started to lift her arms.   Would you prefer to have your legs constrained as well? he asked politely.  If youve a preference for that, I have more restraints.   He kissed her, soft, sipping kisses that made her forget her irritation with him.   No? he murmured.  Very well then.  He thrust into her, very slowly, so she squirmed with frustration to get him deeper, where she needed him.   Do you want me deeper? he asked.   Yes, she groaned.  Logan, let me loose, I want to hold you.   But thats the point, kitten.  You cant.  I have the control.  All you can do is tell me what you need.  Now, deeper?  Yes, damn you.  Deeper.   He flexed his hips, seating his cock so deep inside her she gasped.   Stark paused and kissed her again.  Now what, kitten?  Again.  Please.   Such a polite kitten, he approved.  I am yours to command.  Just indicate your pleasure.   Fury and arousal battled inside her.  Again, she growled.   He thrust once more, long and sweet, and then stopped, smirking down at her.   Kiri realized that he was going to make her verbalize every single move.  She was going to kill himstrangle him with his own stupid, quarking restraints.  But first, he was inside her, an instrument of exquisite pleasure waiting for her use, and she needed what he had to give.   Again, she demanded.  Again, again, again  To her chanted, breathless rhythm, Stark began to fuck her in earnest, long, hard, swift strokes of his magnificent cock, until she forgot everything but how good it was.   When she came, pleasure imploding around him until she moaned his name, he bowed in her arms and gave a hoarse shout of pleasure.  Heat flooded her, and he relaxed, weighing her into the bed.  Their hearts pounded together for a long moment before he withdrew slowly, his cum a hot spill on her inner thighs.   He slipped the restraints off and pressed a kiss to each of her wrists.  Then he rolled onto his side and pulled her close, pressing a kiss to the top of her head.  My sweet little cat.  You please me very much.   With the weight of his strong arm draped over her, his heart beating under her ear, she basked in his praise, pushing away the guilt at submitting to him so completely.  So she was as twisty as he wasshed worry about that tomorrow.         Kiri walked into the elegant pastel foyer of Maitresse the next day with her head high.  A young Serpentian shed never seen before bowed politely and led her back to the dressing rooms.  There were other clients looking at clothing, women with the ageless beauty that wealth could buy, and several employees working, all clad in the fitted cream smocks with the signature M on one shoulder.  Taara was nowhere in sight.  Perhaps she was in one of the dressing rooms.   Haassea herself was waiting for Kiri in the small sitting room.  Once again a pot of tea and small tray of treats awaited, this time airy beige scrolls dusted with sugar.  The Serpentian looked up as Kiri walked in, and although she smiled with perfect grace, for some reason the hair on the back of Kiris neck stood up.  This might be a truce, but it was an armed truce.   Kiri sank onto the divan across from the Serpentian, crossed her legs, and waited.  Quarked if shed be rushed into some gauche utterance.   Haassea leaned forward to lift the tea pot and poured two cups.  She handed one to Kiri, who took it, but shook her head at the graceful offer of the sweets.  She took a careful sip of tea.   Logan was so disappointed that you werent able to find anything you liked here, the Serpentian said smoothly.   So they were going to play it that way.  Kiri looked the other woman in the eye.  I was very disappointed in the selection I was offered.   Haassea made a moue of regret.  That was unfortunate.  I can assure you it wont happen again.   Kiri raised a brow.  If she spoke, shed just say something else to irritate Stark.   Haasseas eyes twinkled with humor.  Despite her anger, Kiri relaxed a little.  The woman was certainly charming.  No wonder Stark had sponsored her.   I see from your ensemble today that you like things with a bit of dash.  Haassea tipped her head to one side, looking over Kiris slim leggings of deep chocolate, and matching high-neck sleeveless top.  Her poppy throw lay across the divan behind her.  On her feet were a pair of short chocolate boots with tassels.  I think we can find you several things youll like.  And of course, a few gowns.   Gowns? Kiri took a sip of hot tea, hoping the motion hid her shock.  Stark wanted to dress her in evening wear?  Haasseas arching brows lifted.  Of course.  You do realize that Logan is a very wealthy man.  He attends the finest functions here and on the other planets where he has homes.   Of course he did.  Quark, why couldnt she have hooked up with a man who was a simple business owner like herself? Of course then they could have had a fine affair, but he wouldnt have had the credit to invest in her business and hire Finder again without blinking an eye.   Kiri managed a smile.  He did mention wed be traveling a great deal.  Not that she wanted to go, but she wasnt going to admit that to this woman.   Haasseas lashes veiled her eyes as she set her cup down.  Yes.  Now, do come along and well begin.   Kiri rose.  Im ready.  She didnt like tea anyway.   She was disappointed to see that when they entered the large dressing room, already hung with garments, the attendant was a stranger.   Sari will help you, Haassea said, gesturing at the slender, dark young woman.   Taaras not here? Kiri asked.   Not today.  I leave you in Saris hands.  Do have her call me if there are any problems.   She undulated from the room.  Kiri thought back to the evening before.  Taara hadnt answered the comlink Kiri sent her, so Kiri had left a message.  She hoped the bubbly blonde wasnt ill.   Sari had all the personality of a droid, but she was very attentive.   Kiri loved clothing and shoes, and someday shed like to have jewelry.  She slipped into the ensembles Sari offered one after the other, taking several along with some black leggings and jacket to wear until her new smocks arrived.  Stark had said he didnt want her working, but their liaison wasnt going to last forever.  She had to be ready to slip back into her old life.   Then Sari swung out a new section of the floating racks.  Kiri stared.  Shimmering lengths of stardust and moonshine drifted in the breeze of movement.   Silently, hardly daring to touch it herself, Kiri allowed the attendant to wrap her in a slick column of gold fabric.  The woman tugged at the fabric over Kiris hipbones and stepped away.   Kiri turned slowly, eyeing her reflection in the holovid mirrors.  Her image moved with her, the fabric accentuating the curve of her breasts, nip of her waist and the swell of her ass, then clung to her legs.  The neckline rested demurely just below her collarbone, but no one would label this garment modest.  It left her arms and shoulders bare and hugged her graphically everywhere else, with diagonal slits in the fabric at the waist and above her breasts.  She might as well be naked.   Miss is lovely, the attendant said, finally emerging from her shell enough to nod, her eyes gleaming.   Kiri glanced at her, her cheeks flushed.  You dont think its too . . . ?  Oh, no.  It is most alluring.  Here are the shoes and the wrap.   Kiri stepped into the metallic gold shoes, and admired her slender foot in the pointed toe.  The shoes appeared to have been made of beaten gold, but they were soft on her bare feet.   The wrap was a float of diaphanous gold shimmering with tiny beads in a swirling pattern, like a nebula.  The fabric has insulative qualities, Sari murmured.  Very warm.   Okay, Kiri said, tearing her gaze from her reflection.  Ill take this one.  You can put the rest of those away.   Saris dark, liquid eyes widened in distress.  Oh, no, miss.  You are to select several gowns.   Several of these lovely, frivolous garments? Stark must plan to spend nearly every night going from one fancy event to the next.  She was so quarked.   At least she didnt have to parade out of the store with her purchases.  She was already embarrassed by the quantity of clothing she was amassing, like some mercenary creature who cared only for Starks credit.  Sari assured her everything would be delivered to Starks penthouse, including the clothes shed worn into the store.  Kiri donned her new black jacket and leggings to spend the afternoon at Kiris Kaffe.   Haassea appeared to say goodbye as Kiri was leaving.  The woman smiled, standing in the midst of the elegance that was Maitresse.  Thank you for coming, Kiri.  Ill look forward to seeing you one evening soon.   Thank you.  Kiri hugged her poppy wrap around her even though the climate in the store was warm.   Stark will be so pleased, Haassea purred.   Kiris hackles raised.  She smiled back.  He certainly seems pleased . . .  so far.  Goodbye.   Haasseas face tightened, her eyes narrowing.  Kiri gave her look for look and then turned on her heel.   She strolled out of the store, head high.  Inside she was simmering.  Bitch, implying that of course she knew Stark better than Kiri.  So what if theyd slept together in the past? He wanted Kiri now, didnt he? At least shed gotten in one good shot.  The Serpentian had understood exactly what Stark was pleased about, and it had nothing to do with clothing.   A trio of exquisitely clad and coiffed women passed her on their way into the store from the podway.  I do hope Haassea is here today, one of them said.  She knows just what flatters my coloring.   Unlimited credit is what flatters your coloring, another retorted dryly.   Girls, girls, the third woman hushed them.  No arguing.  You never know who may be tucked away in one of the waiting rooms.   Ooh, come to buy an ensemble and take home a husband, the sarcastic one muttered.   Huh.  Kiri grinned to herself as she stepped out into the podway.  She wasnt the only one here to please a man.        23  Kiri spent a few hours at the coffee stand, working alongside Maury.  The older woman looked well, her flyaway gray hair tucked into a neat chignon.  Shed bathed too and smelled of herbal soap.   The new smocks arrived, and Maury donned hers, brushing away non-existent dust and straightening her shoulders.  What do you think?  Kiri nodded.  Very professional.  Youll have all the males under one hundred and fifty flirting with you.   Maury waved this away with pink cheeks.  Wait til you see the new logo Fava created.  That will bring in customers.   While Maury served a trio of pilots, Kiri studied the logo idea.  A mischievously smiling woman rode the tail of a comet, holding aloft a steaming mug.  Kiris Kaffeyoull soar, read the slogan.   Hey, this looks like me.   Maury finished wiping the counter.  Well, of course, dear.  Youre a very attractive girl.   Kiri laughed.  Its fun.  And it makes the point that our coffee will give you a lift.  But how did Fava make her look so much like me?  Maury winked.  Holovids can be tampered with, you know.  My nephew did that part.   Scary, Kiri said.  Hope he doesnt take to a life of crime.   Not if Ive anything to say about it.  Keep watching.  Fava designed a logo for the mugs and smocks, too.   Love it all, Kiri pronounced.  In the cartoons, Fava had emphasized the slant of her eyes, and the mischief in her grin, while exaggerating the size of the mug and the comet tail.  Ill go ahead and order the new signage.  Glad I got to your niece before she becomes famous and too expensive.   Something thumped against the wall of the stand, and both women jumped.  Kiri slipped off her stool, opened the counter and walked out onto the concourse, peering into the darkness of the empty space next door.  She could see nothing behind the security grid however.   Saw movement in there before, she told Maury.  Normally I wouldnt worry, but after the gambler was murdered in the back hallway . . .   Maury nodded.  Better call port security.   Kiri grimaced.  I was afraid you were going to say that.   Or you could have your handsome pilot do so, Maury said, gesturing at the hoverway.  Here he comes.   Kiri was waiting for Rak with an expectant smile.  He gave her a suspicious look, but she ignored it.  Just need you to call port authority.  I want to know whos in the empty shop next door with the lights off.   Rak nodded, one hand on his utility belt, where his laser was holstered.  Ill take care of it.   He walked over to sit on the bench under the hoverway where he had a clear view of the empty shop and brought up a link.   Kiris link chimed.  That will be Stark, reminding me I have to get ready to go out this evening.   Really? Have a wonderful time wining and dining with that handsome man.  And dont worry about me, I remember how to close.   Well . . .  if youre sure.  Just dont forget to power down the coffee maker before you lock up.  And make sure all the old coffee goes into the recycler, or well have to flush the system in the morning.   Maury nodded patiently, and Kiri realized guiltily theyd already gone over this twice.   Rak came back.  Just workers getting a new business ready to open up, he said.   What sort of shop? Kiri asked eagerly.   Dunno.  Didnt ask.   Kiri exchanged a look of feminine exasperation with Maury.  How could anyone be so incurious? I dont suppose you could link back and ask?  He frowned at her.  No.  The helmets have better things to do.   Yeah, like a murder to solve.  Kiri shivered as she looked over his shoulder at the shuttered gambling kiosk.  Shed sure feel a lot safer when they caught whoever had killed the gambler.  She turned back to Maury.  Remember, dont use the back passageway after you close.  Going down the concourse takes longer, but you wont be alone.   We gotta go, Rak reminded her, opening the counter.   Kiri followed him obediently but turned back to Maury.  And link if you have any problems.   Maury nodded solemnly, but her eyes were twinkling.   The lady will be fine, Rak said.  Youre new to bossing, a blind Bartian could see that.  Gotta give your employees room to work.   Okay, okay.  Kiri followed him away along the concourse, struggling not to look back.  Logically, she knew Maury would do well enough, but Kiris Kaffe was her business.  It was the only thing that was all her own.         Back at Starks penthouse, Kiri shower-dried, applied cosmetics and fixed her hair for the evening with a mixture of trepidation and excitement.  As she slipped carefully into the gold dress and smoothed it over her hips, she heard a noise behind her and turned.   Stark stood in the doorway of her dressing room.  Instead of his signature charcoal, he wore a suit of dark brown, the same hue as his hair.  Of some soft fabric, the vee of the snug collar was trimmed in satin, as was the front fastener.  Freshly shaven, his hair damp, he was the picture of urbane sophistication.  And dead sexy, too.   His gaze dropped over her in assessment.   Do you like it? she asked, nerves knotting her insides.   Very much.  He twirled his fingers.  Turn.   Kiri spun slowly on the slick soles of her beaten gold slippers and he nodded.  Happiness fluttered, dispelling some of her nerves.   However, he said.  I do believe that dress calls for one or two more things.   He held up a slim container and flicked it open.  Kiri stared.  A necklace that appeared to have been spun of filigreed stardust lay on a bed of midnight velvet.  Stark lifted it out and stepped closer.  He nudged her to face the mirrors, stood behind her to lift it over her head.   When he put it on her, she saw that it was made to fit high around her throat.  He fastened it in the back, and cocked his head to look at her in the mirror.   Kiri touched the necklace, tracing the delicate links with her fingertips.  Its beautiful.  Looks like something a faery should wear.   His eyes hooded with satisfaction, he pressed a possessive kiss to her bare shoulder, making her shiver with pleasure.  The necklace . . .  will do, for now.   He set his hands on her upper arms, and met her eyes in the mirror.  Do you know what it means?  His hands were warm, but premonition skated under his touch.  No.   Its a collar.  It means youre mine.  Everyone who sees you tonight will know you belong to me sexually.   Kiri frowned at him, taken aback.  You mean, theyll knowthat you like to  tell me what to do in bed?  He nodded.  And that you enjoy submitting to me.   Oh, just quarking great, now she was going to be wondering what everyone was thinking when they looked at her.  She scowled at him.  Afraid I cant say no if someone else puts a move on me?  He smiled slightly.  I move in a very . . .  sophisticated strata, kitten.  Jaded may be a better term.  Beings who are used to taking what they want, because they have wealth and power.  He stroked his thumb over the collar.  This says you arent available.  And that if they try to touch you, theyll answer to me.   Holy quark, she muttered.  Sounds like you hang out with criminals like Tal.   His grip tightened, almost painful.  She looked at him uncertainly.   Darkrunner is out of your life now, Kiri.  But he does specialize in getting people what they want, so some of these people likely have an acquaintance with him, yes.  Ah, one more thing.   He looked down, and she watched curiously as he pulled another piece of jewelry around her waist.  A gold chain with two shimmering balls and a ring hanging from it.  Kiris tension ratcheted up to fever pitch.  She shook her head, pressing back against him, her hands on his wrists.  In his arms, she felt at once safe and on the edge of some precipice.   Oh, no.  As she shook her head, her hair brushed his chin.  Oh, no you dont.   Laughter gleamed in his gaze.  You recognize it? I said youd wear it for me.   He fastened the fine chain around her waist.  Kiri shook her head pleadingly.  Logan, no.  I cant wear that in public.  Im nervous enough as it is.   Shh, its all right, he soothed.  Its simply ornamentation for the gown, kitten.   Watching over her shoulder, he lifted the ring and fastened it to a loop on the lower center of the collar, so one length of chain lay between her breasts.  Then he found one of the slits at her waist, and dropped the two balls into it.  They fell over the plane of her belly and dangled between her thighs, hidden by the dress.   There, you see? he chided, smoothing the fabric over her hips.  Just another piece of jewelry.   Kiri had to admit that while unusual, the chains made a pretty belt and the length down between her breasts lay in the folds of fabric, blending with the gown.  She was so relieved he wasnt going to make her wear the balls in her pussy she didnt complain that they tickled her thighs.   One more thing, Stark whispered and kissed her ear, nibbling softly on the shell as he cupped her breasts in his big, warm hands and then pinched her nipples.  Kiri gasped as they sprang to instant attention, and he made a low sound of approval as he worked them hard.   Then he let go, and smiled at her in the mirror.  There.  You look supremely fuckable, kitten.  Let me know if you get  bored this evening, and Ill take care of you.   Kiri didnt answer.  She was too busy staring at her nipples, poking through the thin fabric like little spears.  The fabric abraded them, and she had the horrid suspicion they werent going to subside anytime soonnot with him touching her.   Stark tugged her away from the mirrors.  Come along, No more time to admire your pretty self.   Im not admiring, she sputtered.  ImI look almost naked.   Yes, he agreed. I certainly wont be bored this evening.   He gave her just time to grab the evening cloak and bag, and they were on their way out to the cruiser.  Kiri wanted to dash back into the penthouse and hide in bed.  The evening ahead made her night out at Le Tigre seem as tame as a ride on the spaceport hoverway.        24  Kiri had seen the Grand Lava Hotel and Casino from outsideit was impossible to miss with the holovid volcano spewing lava and sparks night and day atop the skyscraper.  Silly, because the only volcanoes on Earth II had been harnessed for energy production long ago.   She knew from history lessons that Old Seattle on Earth I had had volcanoes that blew centuries before and covered the city in mud and debris hundreds of feet thick.  No picturesque lava involved.   However, this faux volcano was certainly spectacular.  Gaping at the fiery display, she nearly tripped on the carpet laid out on the landing pad.   Head down, kitten, Stark murmured, smacking her on the bottom.  Or shall I carry you?  Kiri gave him an indignant look.  They were surrounded by other beings in lavish evening wear, and hed spanked her?  He bowed to a Serpentian couple in brilliant evening wear.  Yes, he murmured to her.  And Ill do it again if needed, so behave.   Great, she grumbled.  I can dress you up, but I cant make you behave.   He crooked his arm for her to take. No, you cant.  Remember that.   A wide awning had been set up to shield the roof-top arrivals from the rain.  Kiri shuddered as the acid droplets pelted the clear sides of the enclosure.  Beyond them, sky traffic zoomed and hovered, signal lights a blurred wash of color against the black night.   Kiri hung on to Starks arm as they paced along the walkway toward the open doors ahead, which resembled the opening of a plant-edged grotto opening into the mountain under the volcano.  Holo-vines and holo-ferns swayed in an imaginary breeze.   The walkway was lined with huge Argonautians holding spears.  At first startled glance Kiri thought they were naked, but then she saw they wore brief purple loincloths nearly the same hue as their skin.   Inside, lights flashed and glittered, red and golden lava shooting up from a central holo-fountain to stream over the heads of the hundreds of guests mingling in the huge, sunken room.  Huge ferns and vines, so lifelike Kiri wasnt sure if they were real or not, walled the room, and every seat and table appeared to have been carved of some exotic wood.   Long bars were attended by beautiful women and men wearing brief, clinging garments, and overhead dancers writhed on long vines, twirling through the air.   Kiri had never seen anything like it, but the beings chatting and laughing, posturing in their gilded evening clothes seemed to find it nothing out of the ordinary.   She and Stark were the cynosure of avid gazes as he led her through the crowd.  In the lovely gown and wrap, she nearly felt as if she could hold her own.  Stark nodded to many men and women, but he didnt pause until theyd reached one of the bars.  Kiri was gladmost of the women seemed to be trying to use their heavily made-up eyes as lasers, on her at least.   What will you drink? he asked her.   Kiri eyed the variety behind the bar.  Something with fruit, please.   A tropical sun for the lady, Stark told the bartender.  And a moon brandy for me.   The bartender, her bare breasts painted with green and gold glitter, smiled at Stark, and Kiri gave her a warning glare.   What do you think? Stark asked her, turning his back on the bar to survey the room.   She looked around, letting her wrap slip down her arms to the crook of her elbows.  Other women wore their wraps that way, as did a few men.  Your associates sure know how to party.   His hand slipped from her waist to cup her ass.  Remember that.  These are just peoplewith a bit more credit or influence.  Some earned, some inherited, some stolen.   She looked up at him.  You earned yours.   He returned her look.  Not always in sunlight, kitten.  Dont romanticize me.   Even though he was holding her, she felt as if hed just pushed her firmly away.  She was surprised by how much that stung.  She forced a laugh and looked away.  So serious.  I thought we were here to party.  And if this is a casino, wheres the gambling?  I might have known youd want to gamble.  Through there.  He nodded toward one side of the ballroom, where lava poured through a rift in the rock and vines.  Youre welcome to it.  Ive set a credit limit for you.   Thank you.  Dont want to lose too much of your credit, she said.  Rather spend it on my coffee stand.   Stark bent to brush his nose and mouth along the curve of her bare neck.  Kiri shivered with pleasure.  Dont worry, he murmured in her ear.  Ill take it out of your sweet hide, little cat.   Kiri accepted her drink, a tall flute of golden liquid topped with a creamy froth and a bright fuchsia bloom.  She took a sip, avoiding looking at Stark.  She believed him.  And she was so bent that the mere thought of working off a gambling debt with sex made her pussy clench.   She peered down and saw that her nipples were hard again, or still.  Every breath sent the fabric of her dress whispering over them.   Stark took a drink of his brandy and clinked his glass gently against hers, his gaze warm.  Supremely fuckable.  Come along, Ive people to talk with.   The next hour was a blur of beings, from elegant to shocking, friendly to icy.  They all had one thing in common: wealth dripped from their fingertips.  Slowly Kiri realized this was just another decadent nightclub.  The patrons were simply a bit older and more richly dressed than those at Le Tigre and Flash.  There were heavy drinkers and even druggers in the crowd; she recognized the glassy stares and languid movements.   Stark introduced her to the mayor potentate, senators and commissioners of this and that.  She liked the mayor potentate immediately.  She was a tall, commanding woman with a sly twinkle in her eye, her stout figure encased in dark satin with the broad ribbon of her office draped from shoulder to hip.  Her partner was a stunningly lovely Serpentian in emerald diamante.   A collar, the mayor approved, looking Kiri over with clear appreciation.  Very wise, Logan.  Id be inviting her to join a threesome myself.   Kiri froze.  Quark.  These people knew what the collar meant? Stark had been serious.   He merely smiled lazily.  As a mere male, I thought it wise to forestall any such attempts.   The other two women laughed, and Kiri looked up at him through her lashes.  There was nothing mere about Stark.  He wore his air of command like an aura.  She couldnt believe that out of all the enhanced women in the huge room he wanted to be with her.   Perhaps well see you at one of the clubs? the mayor suggested, lifting her brows at Stark.   He nodded.  Eventually.   Excellent.  The two women were smiling as Stark led Kiri away.   You want to explain these clubs of yours? she asked suspiciously.   Already greeting another couple, Stark ignored her question.  Shed ask him later, that was certain.  She wasnt going to any twisty sex club where other women would want to touch him.   A loud gong sounded, ringing over the noise of conversation.   Ah, dinner time.  Stark turned Kiri to the stream of people already moving toward one of the openings.   He led her to a table in the center of the dining room.  The tables were decorated with centerpieces of lush greenery and the most beautiful flowers Kiri had ever seen, brilliant red, fuchsia and yellow.  Their heavy blooms nodded, with long waxy stamens protruding from the centers.  Kiri blinked as she sat in the chair Stark held for her.  The flowers were almost sexual.   She wriggled in her chair, letting the chained balls fall between her thighs.  She was looking forward to her dinner until she heard a smooth, familiar voice.  Logan, here you are.   It was Haassea, in a sleek gown of cream diamante, long earrings dripping to her shoulders and an ornate stole hanging from her arms.  Then Kiri looked at her escort and her eyes widened.  Lithe, auburn haired, clearly Serpentian with his golden skin, tilted green eyes and high cheekbones, he was quite possibly the most beautiful man shed ever seen.  He wore a fitted suit of olive raw lii silk, and a heavy gold choker, visible through the vee of his high collar.   He gave Kiri a solemn wink, and she snapped out of her trance, her cheeks heating up.  Quark, shed been staring like a teenie meeting Chaz Jaguari.   Haassea and her husband, Traay, Stark said.  She cast a guilty glance at him.  He looked amused, as did the other couple.  Well, okay.  Guess she wasnt the first to be dazzled.   The Serpentians sat on Starks other side, with Haassea between the two men.  Kiri nodded politely at Haassea and looked away, her stomach clenching.  Damn, she was going to have to spend the next hour or more listening to the Serpentian slithering all over Logan, verbally at least.  And if the woman touched his hand again, Kiri was going to leap out of her chair and claw her sly eyes out.   Two couples sat on Kiris other side, a pair of Pangaeans, and a human-Serpentian couple.  They all greeted Stark with obvious respect and admiration, and eyed Kiri with interest.  The Serpentian whispered something in his companions ear that made her smile wickedly at Kiri.  Kiri gave her a cool stare.   Stark alternated between visiting with them and Haassea and her husband.  Kiri joined in at times, but mostly she listened.   Theyd been seated for a while when another couple joined them.  The woman had elaborately arranged hair and wore a tiny red dress.  Kiri noticed her only peripherally.  Her escort was broad and muscular, with harsh features, dark blond hair tied back and arresting light eyes.  He wore a tailored gray suit shot with silver.  His demeanor said what he wore didnt matter, nor did his date, unless he chose to make them matter.   Kiri stiffened with instant dislike.  She recognized his face, had seen it on the holovids and business sites.  Marc Moon, owner and CEO of MoonPenny Coffee.  The man who was trying to put all other coffee stands out of business, and the man whod insulted her friend Illyria Tate.   The others at the table greeted him cordially.  He didnt bother to smile back except at Stark.  His gaze landed on Kiri, with interest and then amusement.  Starks hand tightened on the back of her neck.  Only then did she realize she might possibly have a less than friendly look on her face.   She took a drink of the excellent white wine, figuring it was better to do that than throw it in the coffee moguls face.   Stark caressed the side of her neck with his thumb, tracing over her collar.  He looked amused too.   My evening has just been ruined, she muttered.   Then Ill have to see what I can do to improve it, he replied.  She didnt trust the gleam in his eyes.  I could tell him youre in the same business, then youd have something to chat about.   Thanks, but no thanks.  Rather chat with a shark.   He chuckled.  Perhaps one day youll be competition for him.   Now that, I would enjoy, she said.  Its not just the business, though.  He insulted a friend of mine.  Propositioned her during a sales call.   She must be very attractive.   Kiri gave him a look.  That doesnt make it all right, Logan.   He didnt get where he is by not going after what he wants when he sees it, he replied calmly.  Like me.  I saw you, I wanted you, I asked.   That was true.  Kiri looked at Marc Moon again and wondered if Illyria was going to be able to hold out.  The man did have a certain raw magnetism.   Marc Moon glanced at her and smiled.  He had big white teeth, and his gaze held cool calculation, just like a shark.  Illyria was in trouble.   They were served wines and salads and then some kind of strange vegetable in a delicious sauce over fresh pasta, and finally tiny elegant desserts, almost too pretty to eat.   Something odd happened then.  Haasseas assistant, Slidi, slithered up to their table arm in arm with an escort.  Kiri stiffened.  Would the parade of her least favorite beings never end? Maybe Tal was next.   The Serpentian, who wore a striking gown of silver, with iridium and diamonds flashing at her throat and wrists, smiled invitingly at Stark.  She ignored Kiri, which was wise, because Kiri did not like the sheer lust in the other womans eyes when she looked at Logan.  Like she wanted to wrap around him and strangle him in her coils.   Glaring, Kiri watched Slidi flick a glance at Haassea and her husband.  Slidi smirked, then posed arrogantly as her escort greeted Marc Moon.  Moon rose, shaking hands with the man and bowing politely to Slidi.  They said a few words and then the two walked away.  Or rather the man walked and she undulated.   Kiri looked at Stark to make sure he hadnt been unduly impressed.  He was looking at Haassea.  The woman looked furious, her slanted eyes glittering, nostrils flared.  Her husband was leaning over to speak to her urgently.  Stark added something that Kiri couldnt hear.  At least Haassea was classy.  She had that same Serpentian walk, but she made it elegant.   A waiter poured a thin stream of coffee into the cup at Kiris place.  Across the table, Marc Moon watched smugly.  No wonder, probably MoonPenny coffee.  Kiri plucked the crisp chocolate wafer from the top of her dessert and snapped it in two with her teeth.   Stark put his hand on her leg.   Who was that man who just spoke to Marc Moon? Kiri asked.   Head of his security, I believe.  Why?  Just wondering who was stupid enough to date that snake, Kiri said.   Stark shrugged, clearly not interested in Slidi, which made Kiri smile at him.   Now come the boring speeches I warned you about, he said.   Kiri spooned up a bite of creamy gremel mousse.  Ill be fine.  She had Stark at her side and rich people to watch.  They were no more virtuous than the people who traversed her end of the space port, but they were certainly shinier.   His eyes glittered in the dim light.  But I wont.  I want you to do something for me.   The hair on the back of her neck rose.  She swallowed another mouthful of mousse.  What?  Time to use your gift.        25  Go into the ladies lav, and slip the balls into your cunt.  Then come back here.   Kiri stared at Stark in horror.  He watched her, stroking her thigh calmly as if he hadnt just announced he wanted to tease her in public.   She started to shake her head, but he nuzzled her ear, his warm breath tickling and arousing.  For me, kitten.  Youll enjoy it, I promise.   No, she would not.  She peered furtively at the other couples, but they were all looking toward the lighted stage, where a Pangaean in a suit studded with emeralds was strutting toward the podium, his hair curving up with pride.   Stark trailed his finger down her cheek.  Go.  Ill be waiting.   And somehow Kiri found herself on her feet, making her way through the tables toward the discreetly lit ladies lav.  She was full of turmoil.  Not shame exactly, but definitely conflicted emotion.   Tonight Stark was treating her as his sexual plaything in public, and she was not sure she was ready to play this new game.  The balls thumped gently against her thighs as she walked.  Her pussy quaked at the thought of putting them inside herself so he could torment her.   At least these balls werent full of current, like the electroplasm balls.  But that had been in the complete privacy of his bedroom.  This was in the midst of a huge crowd of New Seattles elite.  No, shed use the lav and then go back.  She wasnt his public toy, and that was that.   The womens lav had a lounge with divans and lighted holomirrors.  Kiri met Slidi coming out.  They exchanged a mutual glare, although Slidis ended in a little smirk as if she knew something Kiri did not.   Inside, women primped before the mirrors, conversation humming.  It died as Kiri walked in.  She smiled, but it was not returned.  Huh.  She recognized a few of these womentheyd ignored their partners to preen when Stark greeted them.   She lifted a haughty brow and stalked through the lounge.   Then one of them spoke just behind her.   Poor Stark, reduced to searching the slums for a thrill.  Another laughed snidely.   Kiri stopped in her tracks, anger burning in her middle.  Bitchiness knew no credit limit, apparently.   Thrown into the rough and tumble of the girls dormitories in the state-run school, she learned that anyone who didnt stand up to a bully was in for unending trouble.  Shed been tripped, shoved and even had food stolen off her tray until shed lost her temper and gone after the leader of the bullies.   She knew damned well she didnt look like a slummer in this gown, with her hair and makeup done.  Someone had been spreading rumors.  Slidi, at a guess.   Setting her hands on her hips, she turned with a swish of her skirt.  The speaker was readily apparent, a dark beauty with enhanced breasts bursting out of an ornate gown, her puffy lips smirking while the other women around her watched.   Kiri looked the woman up and down, and smiled back, showing her teeth.   Yes, Stark told me hed tried the pussy here, she drawled.  But he found all the enhancement much too artificial for his tastes.   Turning, she sauntered into the lav, hearing a gasp of outrage behind her.   Jealous bitches.  He might have been with every woman in the room, but they werent with him now.  She was the woman he wanted, and she was not afraid to do what he asked of her.  He might have some twisty ideas, but so far all of them had been for her pleasure as well as his.   As long as she remembered it was just sex, shed be fine.  She could play his games with him and come outor just comesmiling.   In one of the private stalls, she used the lav and then dealt with the dangling balls.  Being so small, they were easy to insert.  When she straightened and let her skirts fall, she could feel the chain riding across her mons.   Her head high, she walked out of the stall, cleansed her hands in the wash-dry basin, and stopped to check that her gold skirts fell straight before walking out of the lav.  The balls rolled against each other inside her as she walked.  It was strange, and arousing, but they were so small that she was more attuned to the chain stroking her labia.  On every other step, it rubbed her clitoris.  Wow.   Thus preoccupied, she barely noticed the stares of the other women in the lounge, until she met Haassea in the doorway.  The other woman gave her a searching look.  Kiri.  Enjoying yourself?  Oh, yes, Kiri returned just as sweetly, brushing past her.  Logan is so  attentive.   She turned to walk back to their table when she saw a woman rushing toward her, holding her long gown up, blonde curls bouncing.  It was Illyria Tate.   They met in the middle of the open space and Illyrias arms closed around Kiri in a warm hug scented with expensive perfume.  Kiri.  How delightful to see you herein person, for once.   Same.  Kiri returned the hug.  Illyrias father kept her so busy she rarely got out of their warehouse offices.  Love your gown.  The blonde wore a black halter completely spangled with tiny beads, the top deeply cut.  Jet earrings hung from beneath blonde curls, brushing her plump, pale shoulders.   Thank you.  The other woman dimpled.  Its Maitresse, like yours.  She stepped back far enough to eye Kiris gown.  Im so jealous of your figure.   Kiri grinned.  Yeah, right.  Most of the women here paid huge credit to get breasts like yours, which are real.   Illyria dimpled again.  Well, my date certainly seems to like them.  Her gaze sharpened.  Are you here with Stark?  I am.   Oh, good.  Hell take care of you.  I always make sure to attend these things with a reliable escort.  They can get pretty wild.  Anyone fun at your table?  Kiri wrinkled her nose.  No, no.  Just some boring business people.   Why, Ms.  te Nawa, Im hurt, drawled a deep voice behind her.  Especially since we have an acquaintance in common.   Kiri stiffened.  Illyria aimed a glare over her shoulder that was so hot Kiri was surprised she couldnt see a laser charge.   Mr.  Moon, Illyria said through her teeth.  The difference is, Kiri is my friend and you are not.   Marc Moon chuckled.  Thats all right.  Friends are not what I want to be with you, Illyria.   Kiri sidled from between the two, looking from one to the other.   The two were staring at each other as if theyd forgotten Kiri was even there.  The air was between them was full of heat, but it wasnt just anger.  And Illyria might be petite and round and feminine, but her militant stance said she was a match for the coffee magnate.   Still.  You behave, Kiri said to Marc Moon.  Ill be watching you.   He didnt even look at her.  Now Im scared.   Kiri opened her mouth to invoke the power of Stark, but Illyria smiled without looking away from Moon.  Her white teeth held a flash of ferocity as well.  Ill be fine, Kiri.  The day I cant handle an arrogant, conceited fool like this is the day I give up my Maitresse account.   Moons eyes narrowed.  You wont miss it, baby.  I keep an account there, and Ill buy you anything you want.   Illyria let out a hiss of outrage and Kiri winced.  If the man was wise, hed quit before he dug himself in deeper.   Link you tomorrow, Kiri murmured to her friend and walked away.  She was looking forward to hearing who came out on top in this battle of the sexes.   The mayor potentate was speaking, her enhanced voice filling the room.  Kiri had to search for Stark in the dark room.  She finally spotted him and made her way carefully through the tables.  She was almost to her seat when she felt a rush of sensation in her pussy.   She stumbled into her seat, staring accusingly at Stark, who sat relaxed, one of his legs crossed over the other, his arm over the back of her chair.  He bent his head to her ear, and she felt his lips curve against her skin.  Whats wrong, kitten?  Kiri sat back very carefully.  Theyregrowing, she hissed.  This is not good.   He smiled, a rakish flash of white in the lights from the stage.  Its all right, little cat.  They simply adjust to your cunt.  They wont hurt you.   She whimpered and then pressed her hand to her lips, afraid someone had heard her.  But everyone was laughing at a quip from the MP.  Stark laid his hand over hers.  His other arm encircled her, his hand on her waist.   And then he twisted his fingertips in the chain and tugged gently.  Kiri gasped as the balls caressed a magical spot inside her, suffusing her with pleasure.   Is it good? he asked gently, as the MP began to speak again.   Since he was tugging again, sending the balls slipping back and forth against the walls of her pussy, Kiri could only lean her forehead against his chin.  This was decadence beyond her experience.  He was playing her here in the middle of a social event.  Anyone who looked at her closely would see that she was aroused and guess that he was doing something to her.   Stark rimmed the shell of her ear with his tongue in the darkness and worked the chain.  Tell me, little cat.  His warm breath tickled her ear.   Yes.  And I hate you.   He changed the angle of his tugs, and the chain worked her clitoris.  Kiri bit back a moan of need as her pussy clenched on the balls, her need so intense she shook.   No one can see what Im doing, he told her, his voice dark velvet in her ear.  They dont know how aroused you are, little cat.   His free hand stroked down her thigh.  She clasped his hand in both of hers, holding on for dear life as he continued his slow, secret torture.  The chain slid over her swollen clitoris, and the balls teased and tormented, rolling against her G-spot.   Theyll know.  All they have to do is look at me.   Mm.  Does that excite you?  Kiri shook her head.  He nipped her ear.  Truth, kitten.   She nodded helplessly.  If he continued, she was going to come right here in public, surrounded by his wealthy friends and associates.  And she didnt care who watched because it was Stark caressing her.   Eyes open.  He began to tug the chain harder, faster.  Now, kitten.   Across the table, Marc Moon slid into his seat.  His date glared at him and turned away with a flounce.  He ignored her.   Over Starks shoulder, Haasseas husband turned his head and looked at her.  His eyes narrowed, and he smiled at her.  He knew.  Somehow he knew.  He bent his head and whispered in his wifes ear, and she turned her head sharply, her gaze cutting toward Kiri.  The woman sat perfectly still, her head close to her husbands, his hand playing on her bare arm, even leaned against him.  But Kiri felt strong emotion emanating from her.  Envy? Anger?  Then the balls moved again, and the sensual torment sent Kiri over the edge.  She was the woman in Starks arms, the one hed fuck later.  She turned her face into Starks throat and came, riding the balls with jerky little movements, pleasure imploding through her.   Thats my wildcat, he approved in her ear.   Around them the crowd broke into thunderous applause.   For one delirious moment Kiri thought they were applauding her, but she forced her eyes open and realized that the MP was bowing, her face wreathed in smiles.   Now for the dancing, the woman said with a roguish wink.  And have we got a surprise for you.  The Seven Hells Riders!  The applause applauded again, louder this time.  Kiri sank back against Starks arm and clamped her hand over his on the chain, imploring him silently to stop.  He lifted her chin with his hand and kissed her.   Now, he said, Well dance.   Kiri groaned, and he chuckled.   He pulled her to her feet.  She was glad of his strong arm around her, because she wasnt sure she could have walked alone.  The tables were moving back, the center of the floor clearing.  A long saxophone note wailed, and the crowd roared as a new stage appeared, holding a group of musicians and their instruments.  The musicians were all dressed in red leather, and their instruments appeared to be on fire, holo-flames burning as they played.   Kiri ducked as a gleaming black hoviecycle zoomed over their head, out around the ballroom and back toward the stage.  The riders head was a grinning skull, engulfed in flames.   Greetings, my lovelies, he said in a deep, smoky voice.  Welcome to hell.  Tonight we ride!  The crowd roared.  Stark swung Kiri into his arms, and she sank against his powerful torso, wondering how long she was going to last without coming again.  She certainly felt as if the devil himself had claimed her.   Stark was a very good dancer, moving smoothly with the music and leading Kiri among the other dancers.  He was also adamant in his diabolical assault.  As they danced, he twisted his fingers through the chain at the back of her waist and tugged it at random intervals.  Despite her orgasm, Kiri felt need build again.   She clung to him, nearly oblivious to the other dancers swirling around them.  Her legs trembling, knees weak, she dug her hand into his back, and shook her head.   Stark kissed her ear.  Ready to come again, kitten?  Kiri nodded.  Anything to get him to stop this sensual torment.   Hmm.  Would you like another partner? I could show him how to tug the chain.   Kiri clutched him, shaking her head.  Logan.  You wouldntwould you?  The bastard chuckled.  Not if youre very obedient.   He danced her backward through the crowd, and around a large clump of ferns, into a dark grotto.  Just outside, the music thundered, lights flashed and people passed by.  Inside, it was only the two of them.   Stark backed her up against one of the walls.  Kiri grasped the faux rock on either side of her hips as he kissed her, his mouth taking hers deeply.  In the dark, she could only feelhis mouth hot and masterful on hers, his hands cupping her breasts, pulling at her nipples until she moaned.  He shoved his knee between hers, claiming the space between her thighs.   He broke the kiss, his mouth moving to her ear, one hand moving down to cup her mons through the thin silk of the gown.  You are like a golden Tyger pussy in this gown.  Every man here wants you, and half the women.   You wont share me with anyone.  She cupped his hard jaw in her hand pleadingly.        26  No, kitten.  Tonight, youre mine.   Starks hand cupped her from without, the balls from within.  Kiri gave a sob of sheer surrender.  She was tired of fighting to keep her distance.  Yes, Logan, Im yours.   Lift your skirts.  He opened his mouth on the side of her neck and sucked, bringing every nerve there to life.  Her head fell back against the wall, and she arched into his mouth.   Logan.   He smacked her thigh, a little sting of reminder.  She fumbled for her skirts, and worked them up her thighs, until they were gathered up around her hips, and she could feel the air on her hot skin, his pant legs brushing the inside of her thighs.  What was he going to do?  To her utter shock, he dropped to one knee between her thighs.  She looked down at him.  He was a broad-shouldered silhouette against the flashing lights, his sleek head poised level with her mons.  He placed his hands over hers, guiding her to pull her skirts higher.  His warm hands spread over her thighs, caressing her soft skin.  Then he hooked his thumbs in the fragile lace of her panties, and tugged.   Her panties tore away, and she was bare before him, only the fine gold chain hanging over her mons.  He followed it with his touch, and she whimpered as she felt her arousal flow over his fingertips.   She was bare before him, in public, only a screen of faux plants separating her from the crowd outside.  And he was clearly intent on playing her more, in some new torment hed devised.  She was panting, her whole body flushed with anticipation and dread.  All any of the dancers had to do was stop before their grotto and peer inside, and they would see him kneeling before her, see her open to him.   Then he bent his head to her and pressed a warm kiss on her bare thigh, and she understood.  Clutching her skirt with one hand, Kiri put one hand on his cheek.  In a flash of red light from outside, he looked up at her, a smile as devilish as any given by the lord of the seven hells limning his face.   And then he put his mouth on her and Kiri moaned with shock, with pleasure.  Hed done this before, in the privacy of his bedroom.  But now he knelt before her nearly in public, his breath hot on her mons, bared except for the neatly trimmed triangle of curls, his mouth opening on her.  His deep hum of approval vibrated through her pussy as he inhaled, taking in her scent.   Then he used his tongue on her, licking up through her swollen labia and Kiri moaned louder as the silken caress of his tongue joined the abrasion of the chain on her clitoris.  Her fingers speared into his short hair, pulling him closer.  Her eyes nearly closed, she gazed at the red and gold lights sweeping the ballroom.  The rider was aloft again, crooning a deep love song, his voice searing, mocking, a perfect counterpoint to the pleasure spiraling tighter and tighter inside her.   Stark drove his thumbs into her labia, and pulled her open, spearing his tongue inside her.  He tugged the chain again, and she whimpered, arching against him.   His kiss was utterly delicious, like being whipped with velvet.  Pleasure built so fast she shook and trembled with it.  She would have done anything, dared anything to keep his mouth on her.   And then she did, because at that moment the rider cruised by again, and stopped, hovering just outside, he and his cycle blocking the entrance of the alcove.   Take what I give you and ride with me, he crooned in his deep, rough voice.  His head turned toward Kiri, the glow of his flames illumining her and the man kneeling before her.  He was watching Stark pleasure her.  No one else could see them, but he could.   Pinned by the singers fiery gaze, she came so hard she bucked in Starks hands, jerking against his tongue in a dance of sensual ecstasy.   Take what I give you and come for me.  Oh, yeah! The rider threw back his head and laughed, and then shot away, leaving Kiri gasping for breath, her body shaking with the aftershocks of pleasure as Logan rose to his feet, a dark bulwark between her and the lights outside.   The song ended on a long chord.   Oh, my God.  Logan, he saw us, Kiri panted.   Stark kissed her.  He saw a beautiful little cat in the throes of pleasure.  Now Im going to fuck you.   Kiri kissed him back, loving her scent and taste on his mouth, mingled with his.   This is so twisty, she muttered.  Then she moaned as he pulled the balls out of her, letting them dangle.  They shrank immediately, tiny metal balls flickering against her bare thigh.   I did warn you Id expect things of you.  Stark moved against her, his cock like a hot brand on her bare belly.  Do you want me inside you, kitten?  More than her next breath.  Yes, Logan.   He kissed her again.  Then guide me into your cunt, and Ill give us what we both want.   She grasped his hot, silken length, and lifted one leg to wrap it around his ass, opening herself so she could place the broad, smooth head of his cock in her wet opening.  He thrust inside tissues sensitized by the balls, lodging himself so deep his pants rubbed against her labia.   Kiri hung on, loving the feel of his much larger, more powerful body in her arms, and how he filled her, stretched her.  He slid his hands under the back of her thighs, and lifted her higher into her perch, so that she was completely open to him, impaled on him.   Outside, beyond the screen of ferns and rock, the dancers blurred into a shimmer of light and movement as another song began.  Stark began to move, taking her hard and fast, in a driving sexual dance of their own.  Kiris eyes slid closed as the sheer pleasure of having him took over.   Logan.  Dont want anyoneto see us, she managed.  Not like this.   No.  This is just for us, kitten.  Just for you and me.  He was thrusting into her so hard they were both jolting against the rock, but his arm protected her from the worst of it.  Although if they could see, every one of them would envy me.   No, they would envy her.  Because she was with the most exciting man in the entire casino.  And right now, he owned every part of her, not just her pussy, but all of her.  With a high moan, Kiri convulsed around him.  Logan.   Stark slammed into her one last time, his face pressed into her hair, a deep groan of completion rumbling in his chest.  She felt his heat flood her.  All she could do was cling to him, shattered.         Kiri woke to Stark brushing a kiss on her bare shoulder.  Time for you to wake up, he said.   She smiled without opening her eyes.  Go away, Mr.  Energy.  Some of us need to sleep.   He slid his hand under the covers to caress her bare ass.  Some of us are space slugs.   She rolled onto her back to look up at him.  He was flushed from exercise and damp from his shower, a towel wrapped around his hips.  Have you been fighting with your ugly robot friend? she asked, stretching luxuriously.   He smiled at her.  He does look like the back end of an old craft, doesnt he? Puts up a good fight, though.  Ill continue your defense training, if you like.   Okay, she decided.  If you go easy on me.  Everything youve got is bigger than mine.   He lifted his brows.  Very true.  And last night you certainly seemed to enjoy that.   Kiri froze, staring up at him.  Last night.  Oh, God, the banquet, the speeches and then the alcove at the ball.  A stranger watching.  She put her hands over her face, hiding from him.   Oh, my God, she mumbled against her palms.  I cant believe I let you talk me into that.   Stark chuckled.  I believe they heard you scream my name over the music.  He grasped her ankle under the coverlet in his warm hand.  Perhaps you need a reminder of how much you enjoyed it.   Nowhere to hide, so shed brazen her way through this.  She lowered her hands to bat her lashes at him.  Well, since you woke me . . .   He shook his head, although he did lean down to stroke one hand over her bare breasts.  Ive business waiting.  But he didnt move away.  Instead something in his face changed.   What?  Ive made a decision, he said.  Youre staying with me.  For as long as this works.   Ah  I am?  Yes.  He planted his hands on the bed on either side of her and surveyed her with sensual threat.  For now, youre mine.  And I have a great deal to teach you.   Kiri gazed up at him.  Even though she was lying flat on the bed, she had the sensation she was falling into his gaze.   She was his? She should be arguing with that, but her mind was full of some strange drum beat, like the music last night.  Her blood, pounding in her ears.  He wanted her with him.   Maybe she really could do it allbe with him, run her business and make a home so that it would be ready when she found Kai.   When she didnt argue, his face relaxed.  And at the end of the week youre coming to Frontiera with me.  Youll enjoy that.   I will?  He grinned, his face creasing with amusement.  You know, I believe Ill surprise you more often.  Makes you malleable.  He bent and grasped her chin firmly in his fingers and held her there for a kiss, his mouth warm and fresh.   Lifting his head, he released her.  Ill see you later then.   Kiri watched him saunter away and then slid out of bed.  She did a dizzy little dance on the carpet, grinning so hard her face hurt.  He wanted her with him all the time.  She was going to travel with him.  Except  that meant spending days on a space ship.  In deep space.   She tripped on the trailing comforter and landed on the bed with a thump.  She ran her fingers through her hair and clutched her head with both hands.  Deep spaceno light outside her window except the stars, no Earth II under her feet.  Depending utterly on a fragile ship and its crew to stay on course for a destination days away, past meteorites, space pirates and other dangers she didnt even want to think about.   She was so quarked.         Kiri couldnt swallow a bite of breakfast.  Not until she was ensconced at work did her nerves settle.  Clad in new smocks and with better coffee for sale, she and Maury took turns carrying samples out on the concourse to the other businesses nearby and to travelers.  Kiris Kaffe turned the biggest profit in its short history.   That afternoon, Illyria finally returned Kiris link.  She was clearly on edge.   So, Marc Moon  Kiri urged, glad to be distracted from her own worries.   Illyria gave a ladylike snort.  That man is impossible.  I dont care if he does kiss like a god, I never want to see him again.   Kiri grinned.  He kissed you?  Yes, the blonde blurted.  Against the wall, with his hands all over mywell, you know.   And then?  And then nothing.  He informed me that hed be glad to make me the happiest woman in New Seattle if I would ditch my escort.   Ow.  Thats a bit crass.  Kiri decided not to mention the man had had a date himself.   Illyria nodded, but then her gaze skated sideways.  Then he sent me this.   She held up an electronic tablet.  Its a contract to supply his New Seattle shops with coffeeif I have a late supper at his penthouse.   A chime sounded and she looked away.  Oops, must go.  Thats my dad.  Talk to you soon.   I want details, Kiri called.   As the link winked out, she revised her opinion.  She wasnt sure Illyria was going to be able to hold out against the coffee magnate.  This might be good if Marc Moon applied that steely determination to pleasing his partner.   Kiri grinned to herself.  She was happy.  She wanted everyone else to be happy too.        27  She and Stark had dinner together by the windows.  It was a rare evening, the lights of the city below visible through big breaks in the clouds.  She told Stark about her day and asked him about his.   Then he took her to bed, where he introduced her to the unique pleasure of being blindfolded and toyed with, first with the electroplasm balls and then with his hands and mouth.  After shed come twice, he untied the silk scarf and showed her how to please him with the balls.  Then he had her ride him and touch herself until she came again.  Finally he flipped her onto her back and took her hard and fast until he shuddered in her arms.  That might have been her favorite part.  Hard to choose from so many options.   Afterward, he held her, lying on his back with her draped across his side, her head on his shoulder.  She lay there, drifting in a haze of contentment.   May I ask you something? he asked quietly, his fingers moving slowly on her back.   Sure.  She tipped her face up toward his, admiring the line of his jaw in the soft lamplight.   Why are you funneling credit to a private investigator?  Kiri froze.  Then she lifted her head and pushed away.  He let her go, merely crooking one arm behind his head to watch her.   How do you know that?  I make it my business to know whats going on around me, kitten.  If you want to use my credit for something, I will know why.   She leaned on her elbows, focusing on the swirl of dark hair in his armpit.  Even that was sexy.  Of course the pose also made his biceps bulge and revealed the tender skin on his inner arm.   Kiri shot him a wary look.  She opened her mouth and closed it again, biting her lips to steady them.  Ill tell you.  II wasnt trying to keep it a secret, honestly.  Just hard to talk about.   What or who are you looking for?  Who.  Her voice cracked.  For Kai.   Who is he? Starks voice was cool and smooth as the glass in his big windows.   Kiri looked at him, but he blurred in a wash of liquid.  She blinked hard, scowling as her tears ran down her cheeks.   My little brother.  Atat least hes not little now, but   Starks face changed, softened.  He moved then, sliding his arm around her waist and pulling her against him once more.  Come here.  You said your parents are gone.   Yes.  Murdered.   Ah, kitten.  Tell me.  He used his thumbs to swipe the tears from her cheeks.   She nestled into the heat of his body, leaning her chin on her hand, on his chest.  He was so warm and she was suddenly cold, a chill that emanated from deep inside.   I was thirteen.  Kai was eight.  We lived in an apartment over my parents shop.  The neighborhood had been going downhill, and my parents were talking about getting out but they didnt have enough credit yet.   For my birthday the week before, theyd fixed a private sleep cubby for me in a storage area under the stairs.  My airbed and my thingsgames, a holovid reader.  It was night.  I woke because I heard my father calling to Kai to hurry, to come and hide with me.  But then  Starks hand cupped over the back of her head, his other arm around her.  His heart beat beneath her palm, strong and steady.   then other voices, rough and ugly.  Strangers.  Mymy mother screamed.  I didntI didnt know what to do.  Whether I should climb out and look for Kai, or stay hidden.   She closed her eyes tightly.  Then somethingsomeone hit the outside of my cubby and slid down.  Blood leaked under my door.  The pool grew and grew.  I thought  it would swallow my bed.   Stark cupped the side of her face, wiping her tears away again.  Finish it, Kiri.  Then you can rest.   I dont know much more.  I passed out, or something.  The next thing I remember was the police station.   She took a deep breath.  They told me later my mother died on the stairs, my father outside my cubby.  Theythey said if he hadnt, the slavers would have found me too.  His blood sprayed  Enough.  Stark turned, and pulled her into the hollow of his body, her legs between his, her face in his throat, his arms tight around her.  Enough, kitten.   But Logan, listen.  I have to keep looking for Kai.  You see that, dont you? Hes out there somewhere, I know he is.  They took him, but hes alive somewhere and I have to find him, have to bring him home.  He needs to be home, with me.   He spoke against her hair, his hand stroking warm up and down her back.  Yes, I see that.  And well find him.  At least well search.  You do realize, kitten, that he may bedead.   I know, she whispered.  But I  I think I would feel it if he was really gone.  Will youwill you help me?  Ill help you.  He stroked her back again.  Theres something else, he said.  What is it?  Kiri nerved herself to confess the last piece of her torment.  I was a coward.  I hid when I should have gone out.  I could have hidden him with me.  They wouldnt have found him, and hed be safe.  With me.   No.  Starks voice was hard, implacable.  Kitten, they would only have taken you as well.  You were a child.  Youre not very big now; then, Ill wager you were a skinny slip of a girl.   He thrust his fingers under her chin and forced her head up, looking into her eyes.  No more guilt, kitten.  None of what happened was your fault.  Its very common for survivors of an horrific event to experience, but you deserve none of it.  It stops here, tonight.   He waited, holding her gaze as she looked at him searchingly.  He meant it.  He didnt think she was to blame for Kais kidnapping.   Slowly, Kiri nodded.  She drew a sobbing breath of relief and relaxed against him.   Something unlocked around her heart, some hard band that kept it tightly locked away in cerametal, safe from breaking.  Stark might lead her on strange new flight ways, might inveigle her into acts shed never dreamed of, but he was beside her all the way, his arms around her, his deep voice in her ear, his will adamant.  She could trust him.   At long last, she was not alone.         The next morning Stark woke Kiri with a kiss.  She stirred and opened her eyes slowly to smile at him.  With her looking at him like that from his pillow, he considered getting back in the bed with her.  However, he was already dressed for his office, a full slate of meetings set.   All right? he asked her.   She nodded, looking shy.  II havent told anyone about my familyabout what happened since I was sent to the orphanage.  Thank you for listening.   A strange, sweet pain swelled in his chest.  He brushed his fingertips along her cheek.  Thank you, kitten.  You honored me by sharing it.  Ill see you this evening.  Well have dinner at Jasmine.   She grinned crookedly.  Starry.  This time I can dress appropriately.   He chuckled.  Yes you can.   When he walked into his New Seattle office, a slim, erect Indigon woman bowed politely from the desk outside his private office.  Sir.   He smiled at her.  He had a full day of meetings, but first he wanted Kiris affairs settled.   Azura.  Any information yet on the investigator, Finder?  The Indigon nodded gravely.  Afraid so, sir.  The man was once reputable, but no longer.  He gambles.   Stark bit back a curse.  More gambling.  Kiri te Nawa attracted trouble like a black hole attracted space matter.  Lucky for him he had learned long ago how to tip the odds in his favor.  How bad?  It is apparently an addiction, sir.  He had no credit left and was in debt to the Lucky Moon Casino in New Seattle until he received the credit from your account.  However, instead of paying his debt, he bought a ticket on a galactic transport.   And hes now on his way to . . .  where? Stark asked.   He is enroute to Frontiera, sir.   Not Serpentia, as hed promised his client.  Frontiera, the wild planet with plenty of room for a man or woman to disappear.   Would you like the authorities alerted to his arrival, sir? she asked crisply.   Stark nodded.  Yes.  I want to know if hes actually gotten any information for Ms.  te Nawa or if the entire search has been a fraud.   Finder might have information to pass on, at least a starting point.  Because Stark meant to involve the IBI, Intergalactic Bureau of Investigation, as well as a private investigator of his own who would work with them.  If Kai te Nawa was alive and on one of the planets that registered citizens, they would find him.   If he was dead, or elsewhere, Stark would help Kais sister deal with that.   That evening, he took Kiri to dinner at Jasmine again.  She was indeed appropriately dressed in a long wrap sweater and wide-legged slacks the color of a ripe orange.  She wore his collar, as Stark had informed her he wanted it visible on her throat when they were out together, and a wide cuff bracelet of beaten gold that he gave her before they left their rooms.   Every time she moved her hand, to pick up her glass or take a bite, he watched her eyes slide to the cuff and pause.   I take it you like the bracelet, he said, amused.   She smiled.  I may never take it off.   Good.  Ill enjoy fucking you wearing only my gifts of jewelry.   And he did.         The next day Kiri worked out with Rak, and then Natan gave her a cooking lesson.  This started when she asked him how he got the scrambled eggs so fluffy.  Upon learning shed never scrambled an egg, his pale green hair nearly stood on end, and he whisked her into his galley.   Since Stark was gone for the day and Maury had insisted on opening Kiris Kaffe herself that morning, Kiri followed Natan.  All shed had room or equipment for in her tiny apartment was to heat packaged foods and cut up the occasional aqua-farmed fresh fruit or veg.  Natan had every kind of cooking equipment shed ever seen and many she hadnt.   By the end of their session, shed learned to make several simple recipes including Starks favorite cookies with bits of real dark chocolate.  In return, she taught Natan a few things about choosing and grinding coffee beans for the most flavorful brew.   They then had a spirited discussion on creating the perfect latte.  Natan was adamant that one must have real cream and Kiri was just as adamant that flavored soy creamer was the best.  Their discussion was saved from degenerating into an actual argument only by Natans impeccable manners.  Plus, she was so fascinated by the way his hair waved around his throat when he was agitated that she kept losing her train of thought.   Then Rak stuck his head in the galley, brows raised.  Those cookies I smell?  Kiri waved her hand at the array of plump, crisp cookies on the trays.  Try one.  My first batch.   He picked one up, took a bit and nodded.  Almost as good as yours, Natan.   Natan smiled smugly.   I doubt theyll ever match Natans, Kiri admitted.  But my coffees better.   The chef nodded graciously.  It is indeed.   She grinned.  Hard to stay mad at a Pangaean.  They were too darn diplomatic.   All right, Rak swallowed his bite of cookie and grabbed another.  Time for your self-defense lesson.   Kiri hurried to change and meet the pilot back in the small gym.   Soon Kiri was not only perspiring, she was rubbing a new bruise on her thigh.   All right, lets try that one again, Rak said.   Ill need to go to the space port after lunch, she said.  She still had a business to run.   You should stay put.  Things are bad on the streets.  He frowned at her.   She frowned back.  Stark doesnt stay home just because things are bad.   Yknow, hes just looking after your personal safety.  He moved into a new attack pose, and Kiri watched him carefully.   I know, she said.  So sweet of him.   Rak gave her a look that said he didnt trust her compliance, but he merely showed her how to repel an attack from the rear.  After the third time, Kiri succeeded in slipping free.  She whooped in triumph.   If Id had a blade or a shocker, youd be down and out, he told her sourly.   She took a deep breath and faced him, ignoring the weariness tugging at her.  So show me how to avoid that next.   The most important thing is to always be aware.  Whos around.  Some of the races are too big to fight, and some are too fast.  A Serp can have you tied in a knot before you blink.  Better have a laser ready for one o them.  Now, that ganger that shoved you into the sex room? She was human and smaller than you, but she got the drop on you because you werent expecting trouble.   Next time I will be, Kiri gritted.  That bitch was going down if Kiri even saw her again.   Uh-huh.  Which brings me to the number one rule for personal safety.  Stay out of areas where trouble lurks.  And in this damn city, its everywhere.  Slavers, druggers looking for their next fix, and all the rest of the port garbage.   Kiri nodded respectfully.  That was the truth.  The concourse where she worked was safe during the busy hours, but the gambler had been murdered in the service passage behind his business.  But she had the shocker now.   She showered and Rak flew her to the space port.  Kiri looked around as the hoverway carried her through the space port.  Her heart gave a thump of excitement as she spotted an empty kiosk on a busy corner with a neat holovid sign that read For Lease.  Shed talk to Stark about that this evening.   She spent the afternoon working beside Maury and then turned the stand over to her niece for the evening.  Rak picked her up and they flew to Starks penthouse.   He was in his office, the door closed, so she smiled at Natan who was bringing a tray with a carafe and single cup and a glass of blush wine from the galley.  Stark, she had learned, could and did drink coffee at any hour of the day or evening.  Natan smiled back, handed her the glass of wine and carried his tray into Starks office.   In her room, she found a set of beautiful luggage waiting, cream with silver fittings.  There were two big cases and one smaller one, which she opened to find cosmetic and jewelry cases.  She fingered them.  Holy quark, she was really going to travel with Logan.  Her hand shook and she took another hasty drink of wine before she spilled it.  Her, in deep space? She wondered if ships doctors administered sedatives to travelers who were scared out of their wits?  She showered, changed into a poppy-red sweater and leggings, draining her wine as she applied light cosmetics, then hurried through the penthouse to Starks office.  Natan had left the door cracked and she could hear Starks voice inside.   She peered through the crack in the door.  He sat in his big office chair, his back to the door and two holovids open before him.  She wouldnt bother him if he was involved in business.  Maybe shed just go get another glass of wine to calm her nerves.  But Starks tone held her there.   I dont care if they think Im playing favorites, he was saying, a bite in his voice.  Masterson understands family comes first, the rest of them will just have to fall in line.  Ill be on Frontiera in two weeks.  Well discuss the deal in more detail when we tour the site.   On the left, a lean, hawk-faced man with burnished blond hair sat somewhere with a bowl of blue behind him and bright light on his face.  A clear sky and sunlight on snowcapped mountains.  Frontiera, and these would be his brothers.  That must be Creed, the precious metals miner.   In the other holovid, a man lounged against a backdrop of woven fabric.  His long hair was the darkest auburn Kiri had ever seen.  Jorans eyes were Starks, his face similar enough to tell they were brothers, but subtly different.  His skin was deeply tanned.   Kiri meant to announce her presence, but she was too fascinated with this glimpse into Starks two closest relationships.   Joran was grinning at Stark.  So youre bringing your latest woman with you? This one must be special, if you think you can abide her company for nearly a month of traveling.   The blond man cocked his head, looking cautiously hopeful.  Saw the two of you in the latest news from Earth II.  She special?  Kiri waited, biting back a smile of pure glee.  Starks brothers were teasing him about her.  She held her breath, waiting for his response.   What she heard pricked her buoyant mood like the slash of a cutter.   Stark shook his head, his voice calm, even cold.  Shes lovely, she doesnt bore me and shes half-Tygean, which I believe says it all, hmm?  Kiris smile slipped away.  She let out a huff of breath, pain striking her belly as if hed punched her.   Joran laughed.  Purrs for you, does she?  Creed frowned.  Thought maybe this one  Stark cut him off.  Creed.  Shes no one special, so dont start spinning moon dreams.  You know my requirements in a woman are simple.  A sweet cunt and not too much irritation.   Joran shook his head, grinning.  Stark grunted, clearly done.  He asked his brother a question and Joran answered, but Kiri noticed only peripherally.   She stepped back very carefully from the doorway and then turned and walked back to her room.  She sank onto the side of her bed.  Her stomach knotted, and she felt chilled despite the warmth of the room.   A sweet cunt and not too much irritation.  Thats all she was to him? Last night, the way shed shared with him  had his reassurance just been to calm her down so shed relax and go to sleep?  Her bitter laugh broke on a sob.  Hed warned her.  Hed told her that very first time not to read anymore into this than sex play.  But without even noticing, shed done it anyway.  Begun to think of herself as part of his life, as someone important to him.   God, she was so stupid.  Like a stray cat, rubbing up against anyone who threw some good scraps her way, thinking that meant she belonged.   She didnt  not here.        28  Kiris comlink chimed, jerking her from her bitter reverie.  She glared at the hovertray which waited at her side.  She had to clench her fists to resist the urge to throw the whole thing against the wall.  Unfortunately, the wine would stain the pretty walls, and comlinks were practically indestructible, so she ignored it, turning away to pace across the room, swallowing the tears of fury that wanted to erupt.   She was tougher than this.  She was not some stupid little twit whod sit around and whine over a man.  So what if Stark was using her for sex? So, shed use him too.  For credit.  As soon as she had enough she was out of here.  And if that made her a whore, she guessed shed learn to live with that.  Couldnt hurt anymore than his words.   She was alone again, all the warm certainty of the night before swept away with one careless wave of his hand.  Stark realityfor her, that meant depending on no one else.  Just like always.   The waiting link chimed again.  She swept up her comlink, ready to throw it this time.   Tal smirked at her from the screen, a twilight figure with his black braids and bold tattoos.  She hadnt planned to have any more to do with the ganger.  Stark certainly wouldnt like it.  Which was reason enough in itself.  Her jaw set, she opened the link.   Hey, star baby, Tal said lazily.  He was leaning against a dark wall, wind swirling around him.  His braids and the skirt of his leather duster stirred.  He was chewing somethinglicorice gum, probably.   What do you want?  His crystalline gaze slipped over her, and his eyes narrowed.  Drinking alone? I could fix that.   Maybe I like to drink alone.  She picked up the wine and took a long swallow.  It tasted sour on her tongue, but she forced it down.   He continued to watch her with the alertness of a predator.  Shame, a starry babe like you drinking alone.  Your man leave you home while hes off cruising and bruising?  She rolled her eyes.  That sounds like you, Tal Darkrunner.  Stark is more likely to be flying and buying.  Or soaring and whoring.  Actually he could do that right herewith her.   He chuckled, that whisper of sound characteristic of his dark humor.  How I keep my associates in line.  Him, nowhe should not be out whoring, not with you waiting alone at home.  Temper edged these last words.   Kiri took another drink of her wine, ignoring this hint that he would treat her differently.  And again, what do you want with me?  Told you I have something of yours.   The hair on the back of her neck stood up.  Something of mine? He couldnt.  The fire had completely destroyed her apartment.   He held up a small rectangular object, smirking at her.   My box? she breathed.  She was shaking, her mind popping with fizzes like Starks sex balls.  You have my strongbox? Shed been so sure it was destroyed in the explosion, she hadnt even bothered to ask if anything had been found in the rubble.   He nodded once.   Howhow did you get it?  He gave her a look.  Dont ask.  Plenty of looting went on before the fire.  Point is, you want it back, come and get it.   Wait.  She raked her fingers through her short curls.  I cant come to your place.  Will you meet me somewhere? Like at a club? Please?  The Flash.  Wear something sexy.   She started to nod and then groaned.  Wait, wait.  Hes here tonight.  Can we meet tomorrow?  He gave her a knowing smirk.  Gonna sneak around behind his back?  She mimicked his smirk, narrowing her eyes at him.  Dont worry about me.   Not tomorrow, I got a deal going down.  Has to be tonight.  His smile disappeared, leaving behind a dangerous man.  You make me wait, gonna cost you more, baby.   The link winked out, and Kiri blew out a shaky breath.  By cost, she knew he didnt mean credit.   Okay, she had to stay calm.  Shed worry about his price later.  Right now she had to figure out how to meet him.  She was under no illusions as to what Stark would think of her meeting a ganger.  Although she wasnt sure why she cared what Stark thought anymore.   Her hand shaking, she drained her wineglass.  If Tal had linked her even an hour ago, she would have asked for Starks protection, his help.  Her face crumpled, and she dropped the empty wineglass, hands to her face.   His words echoed in her head.  Shes no one special  half-Tygean, that says it all.  Because it amused him to make her purr for him?  Damn him to the seven hells.  Shed rather choke than ask him for help.  And she wouldnt ask Rak to go with her, because he and Natan had been with Stark for a while.  They probably saw her the way Stark did, just another throw-away sex-companion.   No, it would have to be someone outside his household.  Illyria? No, Taara.  Shed pretend she just wanted that girls night in.   That box was too important to lose.  Shed do whatever it took to get it back, and Stark be damned.  And if that was foolish pride, well, her pride was all that was holding her together.  And it would have to keep her warm as well, for the foreseeable future.         Stark gave Kiri a quizzical look across the dinner table.  Nervous about our voyage?  Hmm? Why? She looked up from her plate in polite inquiry.   He looked pointedly at the food she was pushing around.  Youve drunk a glass of wine but scarcely touched your food.   Oh, yeah, she said.  Youre right.  Im really nervous.   The Orion is state of the art, he reminded her.  With the best captain and crew available.  Should anything go wrong, there are other Alliance ships within com distance for the entire journey.  But in five voyages, shes had no trouble.   She gave him a look.  No trouble? I watch the news holovids, Stark.  She wasnt calling him Logan, ever again.   He shrugged.  Those incidents were all caused by a business rival attempting to sabotage my flagship.  He is now dead, and his company under the close supervision of the IGSF.   She managed a nod.  Keep the conversation going, anything but him watching her in silence.   Its just  deep space, you know? So, I thought Id drop by Taaras and visit for an hour or so.  Take my mind off the trip.   She resisted the urge to fidget as he studied her.  All packed?  Yup.  Got everything ready.  Thank you for the luggage.  Its beautiful.  Shed thrown things into the cases willy-nilly, more for something to do while she waited to leave than anything else.   He nodded, continuing to watch her, a line between his brows.  Youre sure thats all thats bothering you? You can tell me if youve a problem, you know.   Hurt roiled along with anger, a hot ball of pressure behind her eyes.  Oh, quark, she was not going to cry over a few kind words from him.  Not like he really meant them.  She stared back at him, only her long years of practice keeping her expression stony.   Yeah, thanks.  Thats . . .  so sweet.   The change in his expression was minute, but she smirked.  Not liking sweet? How about, Thats very businesslike of you, Stark.  Glad youre looking out for your latest acquisition.   He put down his napkin.  Yes, I am.  See to it that you do the same tonight.  Stay at your friends place until Rak picks you up, hmm?  She rose and he caught her with an arm around her waist, leaning down to brush a kiss on her temple.  I know youre nervous, kitten, he said.  It will be all right.   For an instant, unable to resist his pull, Kiri leaned into him.  His fingers under her chin, he tipped her head back, holding her there as he plundered her mouth with his.  She clung to him, part of her wanting nothing more than to stay there.  Instead she broke the kiss.  It would never be all right again.   See you later.   You could stay here, he said, his eyes slumberous as he stroked her ass.  Ive several new toys I havent shown you.   She stiffened and he smiled wickedly.   Yeah, I just bet you do, she said, her voice cracking.  Um, maybe you could bring one or two on the ship.  Im gonna need distracting from all that deep space.  If she boarded the ship.   She pulled free of his arms.  She could feel him watching her as she walked away.  But now it felt as if he was viewing an acquisition, not a person he valued.   Hed soon find this acquisition had a mind of her own.        29  Rak ferried her to the landing for Taaras apartment building and walked her to the door.  Kiri stiffened her spine against the guilt eating at her.  She was lying not only to Stark but this man, whod befriended her.  If Rak found out, hed be so disappointed in her.   If Stark found out  hed throw her ass out on the street.   For her strongbox, she reminded herself.  She couldnt believe it still existed, wouldnt believe it if Tal hadnt shown it to her.  And the memories it held were at least true, unlike the starry bubble in which shed existed for the last weeks.   Taara opened her door with a wide smile, bouncing on her toes with excitement.  Hi, she greeted Kiri.  Are you ready to party?  Right here, right now, Kiri agreed, holding up the bottle of Cremart Natan had given her.  When she asked him for a bottle of something to give a friend, hed assured her the sweet, powerful liqueur was a favorite of Serpentians.   Perfect, Taara squealed.  Come on in.  Are you coming in, Rak?  The pilot shook his head, already backing away.  Link me when youre ready to go, he told Kiri.   Taara gave Kiri a broad wink and whisked her into her apartment.  He didnt suspect a thing, she crowed, waving the bottle as she led the way into her tiny galley.  Come on, lets have a drink to celebrate before we head out.  This is gonna be so starry.  And I promise I wont take off with any guys tonight.  I felt kinda bad about that last time.   No problem, Kiri assured her.  She took the tiny glass Taara offered her.   Heres to a starry night, Taara said, and tipped back her glass, swallowing the creamy liqueur in one gulp.   Kiri followed suit.  She swallowed and then gasped.  The liqueur was liquid cinnamon fire, with only the cream to keep it from burning a hole in her insides.   Sorry, Taara was already pouring another glass for each of them.  Forgot to warn you.  Serpentians are a little tougher when it comes to hot stuff.   Kiri nodded, but she took the second drink.  She needed some liquid courage for what lay ahead.   Taara cocked her head, a slight frown on her face.  Are you okay? she asked.  We can just stay in, yknow.  Talk.   Im fine, Kiri protested.  Just nervous about the flight.  Lets go.   Taara nodded, accepting this explanation.   The two of them scurried down the back stairway and then took the elevator from two floors down, just in case Rak was watching the elevator on Taaras floor.  From the street, dark and wet and dirty, they climbed to the landing platform for the local airbus and rode it across the city.   Crowds of young people hung out on the street outside The Flash.  On the short walk from the airbus landing, Taara and Kiri were importuned for credit, sex and the dubious shelter of a religious cult.  Kiri paid the entrance fee for both of them and the huge bouncer let them in through the single front door.   Is Tal Darkrunner here? Kiri asked.   The Mau looked them over with insulting thoroughness and smirked at Kiri.  Tals table is in the back.   Her stomach jumping, Kiri led the way into the club, which was filled with an eerie purple twilight and the sharp lance of laser flashes through the air above the crowd.  Techno-barb music thumped and screeched from the band on the floating stage.  Smaller cages swerved through the air, with nude dancers writhing inside.  The air was full of smoke, sweat and perfume, the scent of sex in every dark corner.   Youre meeting Tal? Taara shrieked in Kiris ear, her eyes wide.  Why?  Kiri nodded.  He has something I need.   Taara recoiled.  Not drugs?  Kiri shook her head vehemently.  No, I dont do that crap.  Its aa memento.   Ooh, a love token?  No, Kiri said, although her cheeks burned.  More like something Tal stole.  Or his gangers did.   But what about Stark? her friend asked.  Wont he be angry? Kiri, I think this is a bad idea.   What about him? Kiri shot back.  This has nothing to do with Stark.  Tal has something very important to me.  Lets leave it at that.   Taara looked troubled, but she followed Kiri through the knots of people drinking and laughing, the laser flashes illuminating them in weird detail.  A flash of orange hair, a face picked out in glitter, a smile rimmed with metal, and clothing from the bizarre to the barely there.  A lower class of partier than Le Tigre, the laughter here tinged with despair and distorted by drugs.   There were small tables with people standing around them, but finally they reached the back, where larger tables were surrounded by chairs, all of them full.   Tals table was the farthest back, and he lounged with his back against the wall, a woman on either side of him.  The rest of the table was full of his gang.  Every man had a scantily clad woman on his lap.  Kiri stopped on the far side of the table, Taara at her shoulder.  Tal said something, and both his hangers-on pouted but rose from their chairs to move away.   Kiri expected Tal to beckon to her, but instead he rose, a lean dangerous figure in his black leathers.  He prowled around the table to them.  You stay here, he said to Taara.  Drinks on me.   He slid his arm around Kiri, his hand on her hip.  She wanted to slap it away, but that wouldnt get her what she wanted.   Ill be right back, she mouthed to Taara.  Her friends eyes were big.   Kiri frowned up at Tal.  You tell one of your guys to look after her.   He simply pointed at one of the younger men leaning against the wall.  The blond man nodded and beckoned to Taara.  He smiled at her as he motioned her to one of the empty chairs.  Taara sat, but she didnt smile back.   Shell be fine.  Tal propelled her through the crowd toward the shadows of the rear.  The crowd parted for them, wary gazes on Tal.   Kiri avoided the curious gazes turned her way.  She was the envy of many of these women, and some of the men, but her muscles were tight with dread.  Tal was taking her somewhere, which probably meant he expected sex.  She didnt want him touching her.  She didnt want any man who wasnt Stark touching her and that was just wrong because he didnt really want her, just her body.   She shivered, chilled despite the heat of the room and the weight of Tals arm.  The chill grew worse when the doors ahead groaned open, and Tal propelled her outside onto a landing pad.  Rain was pelting down on the awning overhead.  The air stank of old metal and pavement, and things she didnt want to know about.   Wheres my box? she demanded, digging in her heels.   A slider whispered to a stop before them.  Gleaming ebony with faint gold tracings.  The near hatch hissed open, and Tal pushed her forward.  Get in.   Inside, Kiri perched on the leather seat.  There was no one else in the cab.  She could see the driver in the cockpit.  Tal slid in beside her, and the hatch closed.  She felt the jolt as they glided forward.  The slider smelled of the spicy cologne he wore, and of leather and the night.   Tal looked down at her in the soft gold light of the small, ornate glowlamps.  His face gleamed like molded cerametal, his tattoos mysterious shadows with his light eyes glowing in their midst.  He reached out and touched her face, tracing a finger down her cheek.  You are a starry one, Kiri te Nawa.  A man would do a lot to have you for his own.   Cut it out, Tal.  I just want my box.   As if she hadnt spoken, Tal rubbed the pad of his thumb over her lower lip, pressing it slightly inside.  She could taste the salt on his skin.  He inhaled and hooked his hand around the back of her neck, pulling her toward him.  He was all bone and muscle and leather, hard and tensile against her.   Come to me, Kiri, he crooned, his breath warm and scented with licorice.  Be my lady.  No one else can touch you.  Ill give you everything you ask foreverything you can dream of.   Kiri pressed her hand against the smooth leather of his coat, trembling with the effort not to shove at him.  I told you, Im with Stark now.  Not for much longer, but Tal neednt know that.   His hands tightened.  Hes out whoring and youll stay with him anyway? I thought you had more spine than that?  I have plenty of spine, she said coldly.  I dont have to share my reasons with you, Tal.   Hes cheating on you.  I wouldnt, he ground out, almost unwillingly.   She laughed, a cynical burst of humor.  Yes, you would, Tal.  Youre just like him, on to the next woman that catches your eye, using your credit to get what you want.  Youd be faithful for about five secs.   For one terrified moment, she feared he was going to strike her or even strangle her.  His crystal eyes blazed into hers.  I could make you beg.   The slider swayed and turned under them.  The glowlamps flickered across the hard plains of his face and on the ebony gloss of his braids, on the metal studs on his jacket.   Kiri forced her voice through dry lips, her heart pounding.  Yeah, but we both know you dont need to.  Women are all over you.  Beautiful women.   He glowered at her for a long moment.  But then he laughed his strange, whispering laugh, and his grip relaxed.  Youre right, starry girl, on both counts.  I can have as many as I want at one time.  Hooray for me.   He stroked her cheek again, something like regret in his gaze.  So, if youre not gonna be my lady, gonna have to do something else with you.  Not safe.   Kiri jerked against his grip, terror slicing through her.  What are you talking about? Not safe? Tal, what have you done?  His heavy brows drew together.  Somebodys angry with you, girl.  Angry enough to want you gone . . .  for good.   What? No, she choked, fighting him now in earnest.  He hadnt brought her here to seduce her at alllike Stark, hed only been toying with her.   She clawed at his face, struck warm skin and dug her nails in before he grabbed her wrist.  With her other hand she scrabbled in her jacket pocket for the shocker, but as her fingers closed around it, something pricked the side of her throat.  Ice spread, sheeting across her vision, so she was stared at him through it, unable to reach him, or move.   Im sorry, star baby.  Tal cradled her close.  She guessed he couldnt feel the chill.  So quarking sorry.  You shouldve chosen me.  I wouldve kept you safe.   Then the ice thickened and locked out everything but the slow pounding of her heart, until even that faded into blackness.   Logan . . .        30  Stark stood before the windows in his penthouse, Raks holovid image hovered before him.  Outside rain lashed against the windows, the lights of craft glimmering like koi darting through a murky pond.  Stark ignored them, fury burning in his gut.   What do you mean, shes disappeared? he demanded.   I delivered Ms.  te Nawa to her friends apartment, Rak said, misery in every line of his stance.  She was supposed to stay there.  But according to her friend, the two of them slipped out and took an airbus to that club, The Flash.  Taara says Ms.  te Nawa told her she had to meet someone there and get back something that belonged to her.   Meet who? Stark had a blackish feeling he already knew.  Hed known she was up to something, his sly little cat, but hed told himself she was merely suffering an attack of nerves.  Instead shed gone off to meet a former lover, a ganger.   Tal Darkrunner, Rak confirmed heavily.  He led Ms.  te Nawa off into the crowd and neither of them came back.  Taara had a drink with his gang while she waited and then asked them to find Darkrunner for her, but they told her to go home.   Kiri went with him willingly?  Yes, sir.  But Taara says she just knows Ms.  te Nawa wouldnt take off and leave her like that, so she called the police.   Stark wouldnt have thought Kiri would sneak out to meet the ganger, either.  Perhaps neither he nor this Taara knew her at all.  This was beginning to feel like a hellish repeat of a very old nightmare.  And perhaps it was.  He remembered the way shed pouted when she asked why he had to travel to Frontiera.  At the time hed put it down to nerves, but perhaps it was jealousy.   And youve linked the police as well? he asked automatically.   Yes, sir.  They dont know anything yet.  Ive got our people on it, too.   Find Darkrunner, Stark ordered.  Hes the key to this.  I want everyone on it you can muster.  If shes with him of her own free will, then thats an end to it.   And an end to them.  He let the rage inside him grow.  It was better than the other emotion that waited to spring from the back of the night.  Fear, because he knew as well as any being on this planet what waited for the unprotected down there in the dirty streets, the filthy back alleys.   But if he took her . . .  I want him in front of me.  Ill beat it out of him if I have to.  Set watch on every place known to belong to him and every place he goes.  I want him, if it takes calling in every favor owed me.   Yes, sir.  Ill get back to you as soon as I hear anything.   Stark broke the link and started to pace back and forth in his living room.   Stark saw instead a pair of golden eyes and heard Kiris husky laugh that always broke in the middle, heard her moan his name as he thrust into her.  He knew her passion had been genuinethere was no mistaking the feel of a womans orgasm when his cock was buried deep inside her.   But had the shy admiration in her golden gaze, her pleasure in his company been real as well? Those could be faked and had been by women since time began.  Hed taken a gamble hooking up with her.  She was not a professional courtesan, who would please him and then slip discreetly away.  She was not one from the wealthy strata in which he now moved.  She was a wild card, and he knew very well she was a bit of a hustler, not averse to finding herself in the lap of luxury.   But at least hed believed her different than Adora.  Had he outsmarted himself with Kiri, thinking that because he knew her for a cat looking for a soft landing, he was immune to any plays she might make?  No, until he knew differently, he had to assume shed been taken.   Fear slashed again, with talons long and sharp.  His little cat was out there somewhere, perhaps taken for some unscrupulous purpose.  He would find her.  He had to.  And then hed collar her, with jewels and a leash if necessary.   And if Darkrunner had made off with her, the ganger would discover as others had that Stark had grown up in these mean streets of New Seattle.  Hed killed before to protect what was his, and if necessary, hed do it again.   But was she his, or was his credit worth so much to her that shed prostituted herself to him for it, even though she wanted another man?  He stopped in the middle of the room, shaking off his bitter doubt.  That made no sense.  Darkrunner was a ganger lordhe was involved in all manner of illicit commerce and probably had access at times to as much credit as Stark himself.  If Kiri wanted to go to him, why involve Stark first? Unless hed simply found her in a vulnerable moment.  Unless shed had a taste of him and decided she wanted Darkrunner after all.   Stark rolled his shoulders in his suit.  He wished Daron Navos was within range of a fast cruiser.  He could use an Indigons intuitive skills right now.  His admin assistant was part Indigon, but her intuition was limited to her family and an occasional sense about a business deal.  He had good people on Earth II, he reminded himself, and they were searching for Kiri and for Darkrunner.   Meanwhile, he needed to pound something.  Time for a workout with his sparring robot.         Haassea linked him as he was walking into his bathroom.  He was breathing hard, perspiring, his muscles tired from a hard workout.  Wiping sweat from his face with the towel around his neck, he nodded to her, although he was not in the mood for a conversation.   She wore lii silk nightwear, her hair tumbling about her shoulders, but her expression was somber.   Logan, she said.  Your people were just here, looking for KiriMs.  te Nawa.  Whats happened?  He took a deep breath and let it out.  Her gaze traveled down over his bare torso to his brief shorts then returned to his face.  Shes missing.   Oh.  She looked away, her winged brows lowering.  She fidgeted with a fold of her gown and then looked back up at him, distress clear in her gaze.  Logan, I received a very troubling comlink this evening.  I dont know what it means or why it was sent to me.  But you need to see it.   About what? Impatience simmered, and he wanted nothing more than to put her off and break the link.  If its business, I cant  Its Kiri, she cut in.  Its not good, Logan.  Link me back if you need to.  Ill be glad to come over, or  Haassea, he cut in sharply.  The link.  At once, please.   She nodded.  The link winked out.  Stark stood, his chest tight with foreboding.   The new link chimed.  He opened it, and the floor fell away beneath him.  The link was of Kiri, walking into a dark, crowded club, harsh music filling the dim air.  She wore a fitted leather ensemble that nipped her small waist and cupped her rounded ass.  Her short, sleek hair shone in the glowlamps.   The blonde Taara was at her side.  She leaned close to Kiri, concern clear on her pretty face.   What about Stark? the blonde asked over the music.   What about him? Kiri repeated, her face hard in a way Stark had not seen since that first night.   He braced his hands on the desk in front of him.  They tightened into fists, his arms shaking with the effort of not throwing the comlink against the wall.  What about him? Had he really heard her say those words, in that cold voice?  The scene changed, to Kiri walking down a hallway, threading her way through loiterers.   One of the doors lining the hallway opened just as the crowd shifted.  Kiri disappeared through the door, and it closed.  The link switched to inside the small room, mostly taken up by a plain leather divan.   Stark growled in sheer fury as he saw the lean man leaning on the end of the divan.  Darkrunner.   Kiri turned away, and the ganger moved close behind her.   I have something you want.   She cocked her head, in flirtation or caution, Stark couldnt tell.  Really?  The man leaned closer, inhaling her scent, his braids brushing over her cheek.  Stay, and Ill give it to you.   Kiri closed her eyes.  Stark froze as she shivered in a way he remembered all too well.   The link changed again, and the floor fell away beneath him.  He reached out one hand and steadied himself against the wall.  Kiri lay on the bed, nude.  Even in the dim light he could see it was her.  Hed know that lithe, curving body anywhere.   Even with another man moving over her, in the cradle of her thighs, ass pumping as he thrust inside her hard until both of them arched in completion.   Stark turned blindly back into the gym.  Rage burned inside him, more than he could bear.  With a growl that began low in his chest and built to a roar, he picked up one of the heavy weights waiting on a rack and heaved it across the gym.  It slammed into a wall and thudded to the mats.  He threw another and another and another, until the rack was empty and he was staggering in the aftermath of emotion, like a man buffeted by the wash of a craft taking off.   Shed snuck out of his home, out of his arms to go to that ganger.   And hed stood in this place before.  Only that time it had been in person.  Hed walked into his own bedroom and found his womanthe woman on whom hed hung all his youthful dreamsin the arms of another man.  Never again.  He would not go through this again, not for her or any woman.  No matter how beguiling.   Kiri te Nawa was a cat all righta clever, conniving, faithless little cat.  And he was done with her.  If Darkrunner was what she wanted, he was what shed have.   He turned to find Natan standing silently in the doorway, his eyes wide, hair wrapped tightly about his neck.   Make sure Im packed, Stark told him, his voice dull and hoarse.  I have a flight to catch.        31  Stark dined at the captains table on his flagship, Orion.  Hed boarded that morning, greeted his captain and crew commanders, and gone about his usual routine of attending their first meeting, touring the ship, visiting with members of the crew and several passengers.  And if those who knew him best, like Captain Steve Craig, watched him with dawning concern, he ignored this and expected them to keep it to themselves.   He enjoyed a vigorous workout with his Serpentian ships guard, stretched, showered and changed.   As he forked up fresh pasta, baby vegetables and Aquarian sole in a delicate cream sauce, Stark surveyed the large dining room of his flagship.  All around him, beings relaxed in elegant surroundings during their galactic traverse.  They ate and drank and chatted, enjoying the fresh gourmet cuisine, the best the galaxy had to offer.   There were wealthy tourists from several planets including humans, Serpentians, Pangaeans and even an Egglantian or two.  Barillians trilled in harmonic conversation.  Farther on, two tables of Tygers laughed and argued.  With so many of the volatile shifters on board, the crew commanders were hoping none of the Tygeans would experience the pull of their mating moons.  The Orion had been through that once before.   Beyond them several tables of sturdy, plainly clothed men, women and children ate and talked.  By now the Frontiera-bound emigrants had gotten over most of their awe of the elegant ship but were still on their best behavior.  From the rowdy look of some of them, Stark hoped that continued.   He wondered what their reaction would be if they knew the immaculate, urbane crew commanders seated with him around the captains table had all, at one time or another, engaged in violent battles aboard this very ship to save her from deadly saboteurs.   Captain Steve Craig was bent attentively toward his wife, Tessa.  Lovely and very pregnant, she was also part-Serpentian and capable of killing with one blow of her slender legs or arms.  Shed nearly died herself, fighting to stop two of her fellow ships guard bent on sabotage.   To her left sat an Indigon couple, with pale skin, black hair and compelling blue eyes.  Commander Daron Navos, second in command and one of the coldest beings Stark had ever met, and his bride.  It still amazed Stark that this bastion of intellect had unbent far enough to marry, apparently for love.  The two were eating silently, but as Nelah suddenly smiled and cast a secret glance at her husband, Stark suspected they were having a very private conversation of their own.  Theyd used their intuitive skills to vanquish an enemy on board Orion as well.   As Navos arched a brow at his wife, Stark looked away.  The last thing hed ever desire was a woman who could see inside his very thoughts.  In fact, from now on, hed be sticking to women who asked nothing of him, other than perhaps some form of payment for their services.   He took a sip of his wine and considered the next couple at the table.  Tryon and Calla Jag were both full-blood Tygeans.  With the golden skin, hair and eyes of their people, they exuded sensuality.  Jag was a big man, about Starks size, but Calla was much smaller.  About Kiris size and weight.  When she gave her husband a sultry glance from under her lashes, something clicked into place in his mind.  She bore more resemblance to Kiri than size.  It could only be hoped Calla did not share the same moral compass.   Jag narrowed his eyes at Stark.  I assume youve a good reason for staring at my wife.   Calla gave her husband a look of reprimand and looked apologetically at Stark.  Jag laid a long, heavy arm over the back of her chair.   Stark smiled briefly.  As a matter of fact, I recently met a . . .  woman and wonder if she might share some of your heritage.  Calla reminds me of her.  Although Calla is much more attractive.   Whats her name? Calla asked.   Kiri te Nawa.  And why in the name of the great God beyond had he brought her into the conversation? His gut knotted, and Stark pushed his plate away, revolted by the food remaining on it.   Both Tygeans shook their heads.  Te Nawa is not a Tygean name, Jag said.  But Kiri could be.   I went to school with a Kiri, Calla put in.  So yes.  Where does she live?  Earth II, Stark said.  Port of New Seattle.  But she was only a . . .  passing acquaintance, really.  He caught an odd look from Captain Craig and glanced away.  Of course Craig had seen her on holovid, so he may have gotten the wrong idea about Starks relationship with her.  No matter.   The Pangaean waitstaff appeared to clear their plates and offer coffee with dessert, a narrow sliver of cheesecake drizzled with plumquot sauce on a dark chocolate crust.  Stark refused the dessert but nodded his thanks as the waiter filled his cup with hot coffee.  Then the fragrance reminded him of sitting at his breakfast table, a flirtatious smile beaming at him from over another cup.  He reached for the wine instead.   Hear the riotings worse there, Craig said.  Are your holdings safe, Logan?  The others listened as Stark answered.  As safe as anything in the area.  Ive armed guards and laser security.   I dont know how you can bear to be so close to fighting, Commander Mra said.  Her green hair curled tightly about her throat.   Your own planet is one of the few that manages to remain peaceful, he told her.  Pangaeans could teach the rest of us about negotiation as opposed to fighting.   And he had no intention of giving up all his holdings on Earth II.  There was savage satisfaction in each and every flight over the dirty, dangerous city in one of his sleek, high-tech craft.  Too much triumph every time he took over a business thriving on forced labor and turned it into a viable piece of LodeStar Enterprises, with the former slaves now free employees, and the dark alleys in the area cleaned and well-lighted.   Yes, he would always maintain a presence there, even if he was uncertain he wanted to set foot back on the planet for a very long time  I regret your complimentary words about my race are not always true, Mra said, darting a look at the Tygeans.  A Pangaean with a bio-bomb had attempted to thwart the Orions maiden voyage.  Jag was forced to pilot the huge ship through the deadly Cattarus meteor ring without her sophisticated nav system.   The Tyger smiled lazily at her.  A few bad gremels in every crop, eh, Commander?  The work you and your interpreters do, Stark told Mra, with a bow to Calla, who had worked for her until the birth of her first child, has saved LodeStar from many a difficult situation.   Although Galactic was spoken as a universal language, and translators were implanted in the comlinks most sentient beings wore, the interpreters work was still crucial, as it involved steering Orions staff through the nuances of dealing with other races and their differing protocol.   Mra nodded primly, but Stark noticed her hair relaxed.  He turned to the Serpentian on his right.  Raile was a lean, intense Serpentian who had been promoted to acting commander of the guard.   Any news from the Dragolins? Stark asked.   Raile set his coffee cup down.  As a matter of fact, the royals do have an announcement they said I could pass on.  His handsome, golden skinned face lit with sly amusement as everyone turned to him.   And? Tessa Craig demanded eagerly.  She narrowed her eyes dangerously as Raile grinned at her.  Tell or Ill link her myself.   The prince has done his duty, he told them all with mock solemnity.  And the princess has been impregnated.   A collective sigh emanated from the women at the table.  Stark caught Steven Craigs eye and they both raised their brows.  Craig grinned.  The legendary seductress, pregnant? Nearly as hard to believe as the fact that she was mated for life.  But Stark had no doubt that her huge, smoky-voiced husband would keep her close and probably pregnant as often as possible.  One way to keep a woman from straying, he supposed.   For himself, he had no such plans.  And if he suddenly pictured a slim, dark-haired beauty swollen with his child, all the more reason to reach for the wine decanter again, and wash the vision away.  In fact, he needed something stronger.   Speaking of babies, Calla said with a reluctant sigh.  Ours will be waking soon.  Id better get back to the stateroom.   And this one seems to be doing training moves, Tessa Craig said, wincing as she pressed a hand to her swollen belly.  So I believe Ill walk for a while.   Her husband helped her from her chair and patted her back.  He watched her walk away with Calla Jag.   Jag chuckled.  Captain, you look as smug as a Tyger after his mating moon.  Enjoy it, because in a few weeks your wife will barely remember your name.  It will be all the baby this and the baby that.   Craig gave him a wry look.  Yes, youre clearly suffering greatly, Jag.   Jag smirked, his golden eyes gleaming.  I manage to get my wifes attention now and then.   Craig turned to Navos and his wife.  Watch out, Daron.  Youll no doubt be next.   Nelahs pale cheeks flushed a pale lavender, but Navos merely raised his brows.  Should that eventuality occur, I assure you we will not present it for dinner table amusement until it is absolutely necessary.   Craig chuckled.  A wise choice, my friend.   Stark refilled his wine glass.  He needed something stronger, like moon brandy.  Of course he wished all his crew commanders well with their progeny, et cetera, but as he had no intention of following suit, the talk was beginning to bore him.   Did the two ex-soldiers get home all right? he asked.   They did, Craig said.  Both seem to be doing well, no ill effects.  I dont think theyll be drinking with strangers anytime soon.   Stark nodded, already moving on.  Hows the new autonav? he asked Jag.  Working well?  Jag nodded.  It is.  Thanks for installing the new multi-level sequestered type.  Much more secure.   Stark nodded.  And with fail-safes built in, should they be needed.   A fail-safe is a wise choice in any situation, Navos said.   Unfortunate that beings dont come equipped with them, Raile said.  As if on cue, his comlink chimed, and he rose, bowing politely to Mra and Nelah.  Excuse me, I believe Im needed in the lido lounge.   Stark watched the guard captain glide away through the tables, a striking figure in the golden uniform of LodeStar ships guard.  After sparring with the Serpentians, he knew the power and explosive speed coiled in that lean, lithe body.   Raile had taken him down with skill and precision and then shown Stark how hed done it, while informing him regretfully hed never be fast enough to take on an opponent other than human.  Stark had assured him in that case, hed keep his laser weapon handy.  Eyes twinkling, Raile had agreed that was best.   Stark didnt mind being chivvied a bit by his employees.  They were the elite, and they knew it.  Only the best for LodeStar.   Speaking of which, hed noticed a particularly attractive young woman in the ranks of the Serpentian guard during their sparring session.  And there she was, just rising from her table, tossing her long blonde hair over one shoulder and smoothing her sleek gown over her very fine ass.  Shed provide an excellent diversion and drive away all thoughts of other women, at least for the moment.   Excuse me, he said to the others and rose, following her from the dining room with purpose in his stride.   He caught her just at the doors and smiled down at her.  Raava, isnt it? Have a drink with me.     Steve Craig watched his employer with a frown creasing his handsome face.   What is it? Navos asked quietly.   Craig shook his head.  None of my business, I suppose.   But later in the spacious captains quarters he shared with his bride, he adjusted the body pillow under her knees for her in their big bed, and then lay back beside her.   Tessa snuggled into her nest of pillows, and sighed.  Whats wrong, Captain? Youve something on your mind, I can tell.   This is just between you and me, baby.  He told her about the holovid meeting with Stark, and the lovely woman who had appeared.   I could have sworn he was bowled over by her.  The guy is an ice man, business all the way, but you shouldve seen the look in his eyes.   She smiled.  Oh, you mean the way you look at me?  He smiled back.  Yeah.  But then he frowned.  And she was on this ships roster, too.  Supposed to fly out with us.  But she didnt show.  And somehow I dont think hell be sleeping alone tonight.   Let me guess, she said dryly.  One of my fellow guard?  He nodded.  Raava.   Tessa yawned, her eyes drooping shut.  Too bad, she said sleepily.  Stark should be happy, like us.   Craig turned onto his side, and laid a protective hand on the swell of her belly, smiling as his son moved under his touch.   Yeah, he murmured contentedly, gazing at her lovely face.  Like us.        32  Stark stiffened over the blonde in his stateroom bed, shuddering with completion.   When he opened his eyes, his body replete, she smiled languorously.  The great Logan Stark lives up to his legend.   He smiled back.  You may be a legend in your own right one of these days.  Thank you.   He moved off of her and she stretched.  Would you like me to stay? she invited.   No, thank you.  I sleep better alone.  And after the workout your guard put me through today, twice is my sexual limit, I believe.   She sat up and gave him one last admiring look before sliding off the bed.  Well, they were two very fine efforts.   Stark watched her slip into her gown and out of his room.  Shed been an agile and inventive lover, and hed come twice, she many more times.  But instead of his usual mental glow of pleasure, he felt like something that had been used up and should go into the recycler.  He wasnt sure whywasnt as if he was cheating on a faithful lover.   He lay back in the bed and stared at the Serpentian fireglass sculpture in the niche across the room.  The glass captured the lamplight in myriad shades of golden brown.   He looked away, his jaw tightening.  Hed have someone remove the sculpture in the morning.  He couldnt stand to look at that color.  Reminded him of a pair of laughing eyes.  Even in the midst of the mess her life had been in, shed laughed with him.  And at him, a time or two.  Such as when hed warned her not to fall for him.  Not much chance thered been of that, with Darkrunner in her other hand.   With a muffled curse, he swept the covers back and vaulted out of bed.  Stalking across the room, he grabbed the sculpture from the niche and held it over the recycler opening in the wall.  Hed purchased the piece himself only the year before.  What the hell had he seen in it?  He tossed the priceless piece down the chute and turned away.  Crossing to the minibar, he splashed a generous amount of moon brandy into a glass, and took a long drink.  He pulled on his lii silk robe and belted it.   He was relaxed, sexually sated, his life and his business on track.  He would enjoy a drink in the privacy of his luxurious stateroom, followed by a nights well-earned rest.   He wished a certain faithless little hellcat a night of peaceful rest herself.  She did sleep well after a good fucking, that was certain.   Stark refilled his glass and then took the bottle with him to his chair.     He dreamed of her.  He walked down a dark, dirty street, with threatening creatures lurking in the shadows.  He was young again, vulnerable, and yet in charge of the safety of the only other beings who mattered to him.   But instead of his two younger brothers, when he turned it was Kiri at his elbow, her golden eyes haunted with fear.   When he turned on her, she looked up at him.  Then her face changed, and she shook her head, smirking at him.   I dont need you, Logan, she said.  I never did.  You needed to save me, to feel strong and successful.   The last sight he had of her, she was running away, toward someone waiting in the black at the end of the street.     He woke panting for breath, his face wet with perspiration and something else he refused to acknowledge.  He swiped the back of his hand over his eyes and turned onto his stomach, burying his face in the clean, soft pillows.   She was just a woman, easily replaceable.  Hed been more than kind to her and had nothing to regret.  Anyway, he was not a man to keep a woman around too long, and certainly not the kind to believe in the heart-rending emotion wept over in love songs and romantic holovids.   No, hed wanted to possess her, that was all.  Just another acquisition, another sign that he was a wealthy, successful man.  Light years from the frightened boy whod run those streets, his wits and fists the only balance between survival and a descent into degradation and death.   He owned the bed in which he lay, the ship that surrounded him, and land and businesses on three planets.  He was content.   It was only then that he realized hed just echoed her dream words.         He had the limber Raava the next two nights and then lost interest.  None of the other lovely women on the ship roused his desire, either.  He slept restlessly.  When he realized he was turning too often to the moon brandy, he ordered a sleep gesic from Dr.  Tentaclar, the ship physician.   He spent the fourth evening out on holovid with his brothers, each in turn.   Creed was hard at work on his mining claim, supervising the crew of laborers and mining droids working the titanium.   Logan, he said, nodding.  He sat alone on a verandah hewn of rock and wood, a wild mountain range in the distance.  Hows the voyage?  Fine.  Creed was alone too much.  Stark could still see the solemn, wide-eyed little boy hed been, hanging close by his older brothers sides, always hungry as his thin body fought to grow into the tall, lean man hed become.   Is your new, ah, lady with you? Creed asked.   No, Stark said shortly.  That didnt work out.   Creed frowned.  What happened to her?  She left.  Saved me the expense of a parting gift, so Im counting my blessings.  What about you? Been to the settlements lately?  Creed didnt answer for a moment, watching his older brother.  But finally he shrugged, letting Stark change the subject.  You know I dont frequent the settlements much.  Im busy here.   Youre alone too much, Stark said.  How are you ever going to meet a woman to share that huge house youve built, if you dont go anywhere?  Creed gave him a look.  Ill order one in with the next shipment of supplies, he said dryly.   Stark grinned as he was meant to, but the idea had a grain of truth to it.  Perhaps thats what it would take, was presenting his youngest brother with a woman.  One so enticing he couldnt resist her.   They talked about the new mining droids that were scheduled to arrive soon, and Stark signed off.   Joran he found lounging in his tent, playing holodice with two of his band of nomads.  A sloe-eyed temptress hung on his shoulder.   No woman with you, he said to Stark, cocking his head with interest.  She turn out to be more interested in your credit than you?  No, in another man, Stark said.  Did you get the new tech I sent you?  I did, thanks.  Itll come in very handy when were hunting  wild game.   Stark nodded.  Joran couldnt speak of the intended use of the tech in front of the woman, or perhaps the men.  He let very few into his confidence.   When he was alone again, Stark kept his thoughts focused on his brothers.  They were both nearing thirty years of age.  The time in a mans life when he should be settling down, starting a family.  He meant to see to that for both of them.   Creed first, as he was completely alone.  Might take a bit of manipulation behind his back.  Getting past his formidable personal barriers was the problem.  His youngest brother might be a deadly fighting machine with the eerie calm of the monk hed trained to be for a time, but he was lonely.  And Stark would fix that, one way or the other.   Joran, on the other hand, spread his favors freely among the women of his band and those he met in gambling tents and brothels.  The trick would be convincing him to choose a woman of quality, with whom he would want to raise a family.   The fifth evening, Stark spent playing holodice with Navos and Craig and drinking the ale Craig favored.  Stark was in no hurry for his bed.  The gesics turned out to be a questionable aidhe slept, but now he was unable to wake from the bad dream that continued to plague him.   The sixth evening he wandered the paths of Orions arboretum.  Somewhere a waterfall splashed softly into a pond.  Overhead, birds warbled and tweeted in the luxuriant tropical trees and vines, and outside the huge windows lay the panoply of space.   The three moons of Frontiera shone white in the distance, and the planet herself lay like a blue and green ball, with a crescent of darkness on one side, and the golden glaze of daylight on the other.  The planet was a place of new beginnings for many of the beings on this very ship.  Theyd fled the stress and clamor of their overcrowded homes to begin new lives.  Staking claims for themselves and their families.   He stared at the approaching world for a time and then continued restlessly along the path through the shrubbery.  A large gemcock strutted onto the path ahead of him, iridescent purple tail feathers trailing.  Stretching its neck, the bird cocked its gold-crowned head and goggled at Stark.  Deciding he was harmless, it preceded him like a feathered herald.   He smiled humorlessly to himself.  Yes, he was the ruler of all he surveyed, and captain of his fate, whatever the seven hells that might be.  But he couldnt seem to get one small, calculating cat out of his mind and his dreams.  He was as alone as the gemcock, his fine feathers availing him no mate, either.   Anger firing the impulse, he cued his comlink.   Raava.  Care to join me in my stateroom for a drink?  He could use the comfort of a warm, soft body.        33  Cold.  So cold, shivering so violently her teeth chattered together and her body vibrated against the hard surface underneath her.  Kiri reached for a blanket, but found only a thin insulating wrap that rustled in her grasp.   Moaning at the pain lancing through her head, she forced her eyes open.  A small rectangular shape sat directly in her line of sight, on the edge of a drab metal platform.  She knew that shape.  Memories chased through her foggy mind.  She winced, clutching her head as the pain grew worse.  Shed think later.   She drifted back into an uneasy sleep.  This time she dreamed.   She lay in the cubby, huddled under her comforter.  Outside lights flashed, and screams echoed, followed by a heavy thump against her door.  She stared at the floor, waiting for the crimson pool she knew would spread under the door, as it always did.   But instead, the door flew open, and a shadow fell across her bed.  She clenched her chattering teeth.  This time theyd kill her, too.  But it was Tal gazing down at her, a threatening scowl on his handsome face.   Get up, he said in a strange, grating voice.  Youre not riding for free.   The metal cot jolted with the force of a heavy kick.  Get up, repeated the voice in Galactic, the universal language.  Or Ill drag you out myself, and you wont like it.   Kiri jerked awake.  She squinted painfully at the squat figure standing over her.  He or she resembled nothing so much as an evil space pirate in an adventure holovid.   Mauritian; a humanoid with a strange purple-blue cast to skin and hair.  As Kiri gaped, the being smiled, not a pleasant sight.  Yellow eyes flared, crooked teeth gleaming among straggling braids.   Guess I get to help you up.   Kiri jolted upright, the pain in her head nearly sending her flat again.  She bent over, clutching her head.  Im up.  But, where am I? Who are you?  Why, youre on a top-line cruise ship, your majesty, cooed the Mauritian in a falsetto.  Allow me to escort you to your throne.   Nausea hit, and Kiri retched.  She clapped a hand over her mouth, in the imminent knowledge that she was going to be very sick.   Gahin here, the Mauritian commanded, recoiling to slap open a narrow hatch.   Kiri bolted into a tiny lav and vomited until her gut was empty and she was shaking with revulsion at the bitter taste.  She staggered to the basin and drank water from her cupped hands, then splashed some on her face.  Now her throat hurt to match her head.   She stared at her pale reflection into the tiny, fogged mirror.  Tiny, battered and stinking, the lav said clearly this was not a good place.  And the last thing she remembered was getting into Tals slider and hearing his soft, deep voice.   Hed sold her out.  Maybe literally.   If youre emptied out, you got work to do, the Mauritian barked.   Kiri staggered back out of the lav, one hand on the wall for balance.  The room was a sleep cubby, she saw now, with drab, scarred walls and no ornamentation of any kind.  The narrow, hard cot held only the thin blanket and a familiar cerametal box.   Tal had sent her strong box with her.  Was this his idea of a cruel joke? Give her what shed asked for and take away everything else?  Where am I? Was she in some back-alley den near the dock?  Come on.  The Mauritian shoved open the narrow hatch, and led the way along a narrow passageway lined with similar hatches, some open.  Kiri glimpsed other sleep cubbies, full of the clutter of occupancy.  There were others here.  Was that a good sign, or a bad one?  They passed into an open area, full of noise and bustle the smell of food, and her hope fled.   Past the dozen tables full of raucous beings of every race, and the smells of food and drink and clatter of food service on a large scale, the room was lined with portholes.   Beyond them all gleamed the star-filled, midnight reaches of deep space.   Kiris knees buckled, and she fell against the nearest bulkhead, only a railing holding her up.  Her head buzzed with shock.   She was in deep space.  And not on one of Starks beautiful ships with his ex-Space Forces pilot and crew.  But on a bucket of rust probably cobbled together with no more finesse than the old airbuses she rode on Earth II.   She was going to die.  Probably from horrible suffocation when an airlock broke, or something like that.   Ho, Gravia, what you bring us? called a deep voice.  Something shiny?  Nothing for you, space scum, Kiris captor called back.  Anyway, Im the beauty, not her.   Laughter rolled, but it echoed from far away as Kiri stared at the nearest porthole.  Space . . .  she was in space, shanghaied and bound for who knew what horrible fate.   Come on, immi, the Mauritian said.  She grabbed Kiris arm in bruising grip and hustled her across the big room, through a gauntlet of predatory gazes.  Kiri sank into herself, assuming the mantle of her youth, returning the looks with her own blank stare.  Never let anyone see the fear.   She was intensely relieved to reach the din of the galley at the other side.   The Mau shoved Kiri onto a stool and stabbed one clawed hand at a large, shiny machine standing on the counter.  Now, you show me how to work this.   Kiri blinked, unable to believe her eyes.  She turned to the Mauritian, ignoring the two Pangaeans and human who paused in their chores to watch curiously.   You . . .  you brought me here to run a coffee machine?  The human, a stout, freckled man, snickered, and the two Pangaeans hair wriggled around their throats, their eyes dancing.  The Mauritian bared her teeth at Kiri, her yellow eyes full of menace.   No, I brought you here to show me how to run it, she snarled.  Then I dont need you no more, and youll earn your keep another way.  We need another ships whore, the others are gettin worn out, the boys use them so hard.   ere now, Freckles protested, shifting uneasily.  No call to be so  Shut your maw, the Mauritian snarled at him, and he subsided, although with a disapproving air.   Her past wrapped its slimy tentacles around Kiri.  Death seemed less imminent, but now rape and injury yawned like a slavering mouth.   She stared out at the dining hall full of men and women, many of whom were still watching her through the open service counter, laughing as they talked among themselves.  One huge tattooed man grinned and then wiggled his long tongue suggestively.  Kiri rolled her eyes, revulsion tightening her face.  He and his cronies roared with laughter.   Shed been slammed back into her past as if shed never left the government-funded school, among the roughest street youths, all jockeying for position and status.   Well, hells.  She knew how to do this.  Shed just never thought shed have to again.   The Mauritian moved closer to Kiri, her claws digging into Kiris shoulder through her leather vest.  Get busy, she said.  Or youre theirs.   Kiri narrowed her eyes and glared back, refusing to show pain.  I get it.  Enough with the grabbing.   She turned to the coffee machine.  It sat in gleaming splendor.  Quark, it was the newest version of the brand she used in her stand.  This had cost a starry sum.   Okay, I know how to use this.  She could control one facet of this hellish situation.   She glanced down at herself.  She was surprised they hadnt stolen her clothing.  Shed chosen her leather pants, vest, and high boots to wear to the club.  Looked like it was going to have to last her for a while.  The spider lace top was fragile and wouldnt hold up, but the leather was top grade.   She looked the Mauritian in the eye.  I need an apron.  A clean one.   Freckles hurried to get an apron from the back of the galley, and Kiri tied it over her clothes.  It was stained, but didnt smell any worse than the rest of the place.   As she opened a package of Pangaean dark, her mind was racing.  She didnt know why she was here, or even what ship she was on.   The Mau had threatened her with prostitution.  And she was not going there, not with a bunch of filthy space transport mechanics.  She had to show these freighters that if they wanted good coffee, they needed her.  Then shed figure out the restlike why she was here, and where Stark was when she really needed him.   She flipped switches and poured in coffee beans with quick flourishes.  The machine rumbled to life, grinding the beans, funneling them into the filter, and then adding boiling water.  Soon the air was steaming with the scent of fresh coffee.  At least theyd purchasedor stolentop-grade beans.  Now for some sleight of hand.  If it didnt work, she was quarkedor fucked by some stinking crewman, which would be light years worse.   Ignoring the Mauritian, who hovered at her elbow, Kiri flipped more switches.  She took a deep breath, and set two carafes under the spigots, and filled them both.  Then she picked up two fairly clean mugs in one hand and the carafes in the other.   Wheres the captain? First cup for him.   The Mauritian scowled, but Freckles pointed across the dining hall.  Hes there.  Red cap.  Captain Argo.   Kiri walked out into the dining hall and strode through the tables with her burden, chin up, her narrowed eyes daring anyone to stop her.  She expected the Mauritian to follow and was relieved when she did not.   Captain Argo was a grizzled human, with weathered skin and gray hair, and the tough demeanor of a man accustomed to being obeyed.  His long hair was clubbed back, and he wore a leather utility vest over his flight suit.  He sat back in his chair, eyeing Kiri as she approached his table.  He looked like a surly version of Rak, so he didnt scare her.  Right.  Good thing shed just used the lav, or shed be wetting her pants.   The others at the captains table stopped talking as she set the two carafes down.   First cup from your new coffee maker, Captain, sir, she said.  Her voice only wobbled a little.  Demurely, she poured a steaming cup of dark brew and handed it to him.   The captain took the cup and saluted her with it before drinking.  Then his face twisted in revulsion, and he spat the mouthful of steaming coffee out, missing the cup with part of it.  It splattered on the table and his empty plate.   What the seven hells? he growled.  Thats the foulest brew I ever tasted, and thats saying a pile, considering the old wreck of a machine we been using.  His voice rose, his cheeks reddening as he yelled.  This new brew is sposed to taste better.  An youre sposed ta know how to run it.   His crew commanders moved restively, scowling at Kiri.   She stiffened her knees and poured a second cup.  She set it before the captain, whisking away the first cup.   Thats what java tastes like when you dont know how to use the new machine, she told him.  Heres what it tastes like when you do.   The captain eyed the new cup of coffee, still scowling dangerously.  Then he shrugged and took a small sip.  A look of pleased surprise crossed his face, and he took another drink.  Then he nodded wryly.  Thats more like it.   His crew commanders relaxed.  Ill have a cup of that, a lanky Indigon said.   So will I.  Serve it up, girl.  A Mau pounded his fist on the table.   Kiri kept her gaze on the captain.  Sir, I am a trained barista.  Had a shop of my own in the space port, until I somehow ended up on your ship.  You keep me in charge of the machine, and Ill serve up the best java you and your crew ever drank.   And I suppose we let someone else touch it, and we get more of that swill, he said dryly.   Kiri shrugged, her heart pounding, her face cool.   The captain laughed, a raspy chuckle that creased his cheeks and set his eyes twinkling.  He toasted Kiri with his mug.  I like you, girlie.  Darkrunner was rightyou got solid fuel.  All right, looks like we got us a barista.   He surged out of his chair, and the dining hall quieted.  This here, he said to his crew, is our new coffee girl.  Whats your name?  Kiri, she managed.  Wait a sec.  Darkrunner made a deal with you?  Kiri, the captain repeated, ignoring her question.  His gaze turned crafty.  What else you willing to do to earn your keep?  It was a challenge, and she knew it.  Ill cook, Ill serve.  I wont do sex work of any kind.  Tal had sent her on this ship, had made some kind of a deal with this rough captain.  Maybe this was even one of Tals ships.   The captain nodded and looked around the room.  Heads nodded, although some of them with clear reluctance.  A few of the crew merely stared.  The captain sat down, satisfied.  Bring my commanders some coffee.  The good stuff, mind you.   Yes, sir.  And then shed ask again, until he told her why Darkrunner had shanghaied her.  She wanted to know before she shocked the tattooed bastard in the balls.        34  Kiri walked back to the kitchen, skirting the table where two Serpentians, a man and a woman, sat watching her.  They were among those who had refused to nod.   Her skin crawled.  Shed likely have to deal with one or both of them soon.  Another Serp woman sat at the table with them, slim and pretty, but with body language that said she could take care of herself.  She jerked her chin in a nod as Kiri passed.   Kiri nodded back, shaking off her fear.  She had coffee to make.  In the galley, she quickly disposed of the bad batch of coffee in the recycler.  Then she poured four mugs of coffee and handed the first one to Gravia with a nod of respect.  She was going to be working with this kitchen crew, and she wanted them on her side.  Gravia scowled but took it.  Kiri handed the other mugs to the Pangaeans and Freckles, who winked at her.   She hurried back to the captains table, but he was gone.  His commanders accepted their coffee without thanks, although one of them, a lean man with a long dark braid, winked at her.  The next hour was a blur of work and activity as Kiri brewed more huge carafes of coffee and set them out along with a phalanx of mugs.  The ships supplies evidently didnt run to creamer and flavorings, which considering the plain protein and veg the cooks were serving up, didnt surprise Kiri.  Dessert seemed to be huge trays of strange red pastries that smelled of spoiled berries.   As the dining hall emptied out, she sank onto a stool with a mug of coffee for herself.   Here.  Freckles shoved a napkin into her hand.  It held a plump wrap, exuding flavorful steam.  You look like youre bout to hit the floor.   Kiri took a bite, and nearly moaned at the burst of rich protein and spice on her palate.  Mm, good.   Gravias specialty, one of the Pangaeans said with a sly twinkle.  Mauritian rat.   Kiri jerked the wrap away from her mouth and then watched as the other cooks all sniggered.  She saluted Gravia with the wrap and took another big bite.   Best rat I ever ate.  The texture was too soft to be any kind of meat, but the Mauritian was clearly enjoying her momentary discomfiture, and Kiri knew Gravia needed some kind of victory to even the score.   As she served coffee, most of the crew left her alone, although she was stripped by more than one gaze.  After a time, though, two Serpentian women flounced up to the counter.  They were both attractive in a hard way, with flowing hair and tight, bright clothing.   The one with turquoise stripes in her blonde hair set her hands on her hips and glared at Kiri.  You better not be slithering in on our business, bitch.   Or well cut you a new one, the redhead added, smirking.  She had very sharp teeth, as if theyd been filed.  Kiri wondered if she nibbled her customers with them.   She held out two mugs of fresh coffee.  I wont be.  Anyone tries to make me, Ill cut him a new one.  Hows that?  They looked at each other and then back at her.  The redhead took a cup and nodded.  Well be watching.   Course theyre not gonna look at you, anyway, the blonde said complacently, taking the other cup and trailing her free hand over her own deep cleavage.  No tits.   Kiri certainly couldnt hope to compete with the impossibly round breasts both of them sported.   Youre right, she said, trying to look put out.  With you two around no one will notice me.   And dont think youll be getting any of my trade either, added a new voice.  A slim Pangaean joined them, his green hair waving about his throat in agitation.  Just because youre built like a boy.   Kiri held out another cup of coffee.  Got it.   The three slithered away with their coffees, a wave of turning heads marking their progress.  Kiri sent a silent prayer of thanks that they were on board and hoped that there werent too many crew whod rather have an unwilling partner.   She closed her fingers over the small cylinder in her pocket.  She wasnt sure why theyd overlooked her shocker, but she was grateful to the point of tears.  Guess whoever had searched her wasnt partial to lip gloss.   Kiri followed Gravias orders to help clean up from the meal.  The dishes all went in the huge washers, and they set droids running on the floors and countertops.  The Pangaeans set about wiping down the dining tables.   As she cleaned the coffee machine and set a fresh batch to brew, Kiri had time to think.  And her thoughts were black holish.   What ship is this? she asked Freckles, whose name was Gim.  Who owns her?  The SixPac.  Owned by the captain.  Were a freighter, carrying tech goods and other stores for the shops.   Shops where?  Headed for Frontiera, he told her, his gaze curious.  Be there in a week, give or take meteor showers in the Cattarus system.   Kiri was glad she was sitting down.  Frontiera?  Gim nodded, his gaze faraway.  Yup.  Shes a beauty, I hear.  Lot of ships headed there carrying immis.   Kiri took another drink of hot coffee.  I hear wild tribes and pirates roam the place.   He shrugged, polishing a huge kettle.  I hear the airs clear, the rain dont ruin your clothing, and you can walk in the sunlight without getting eaten up with cancers.   She took another drink, only then noticing her cup was empty.  She rose to pour herself another cup.  I hear the wild beasts will eat you first.   Skrog, he said, nodding.  And catamounts the size of sliders.  He widened his eyes at Kiri in mock ferocity and she shuddered.   He chuckled.  You dont have to get off the ship.   Kiri didnt bother to answer.  She was getting off this ship, all right, if it was the last thing she did.  Then shed work until she had enough credit to get back to Earth II and her shop.  Stark might not know or care where she was, but she was a survivor.  Shed get through this.   She looked around nervously.  The Pangaeans had gone, and Gravia was mixing something in a huge bowl across the galley.  What do you do between meals?  Sleep.  Play games.  Always a game of holodice going on somewhere.  Watch a holovid if youre lucky enough to have a comlink that works.   He eyed her.  I was you, though, Id stay close between here and your sleep cubby.  Some rough ones in this crew, and youre a starry little thing.  Theres those thatll haul you into a dark corner and enjoy it even more cause you didnt want it.   Just like on the streets around the New Seattle port.  I noticed.  Would you mind walking me to my cubby?  She was exhausted.  She didnt know what time it was by New Seattle time . . .  not that that mattered.   Gim shrugged.  Sure.   They walked down the passageway.  As eyes turned her way from the denizens of the sleep cubbies along the way, Kiri was glad the burly cook was with her.   But as they walked, a loud siren sounded, and all other sound rumbled to a halt.  The ship shuddered and went silent.  The lights went out, to be replaced by the harsh glare of tiny emergency flares.  The only sound was Kiris panicked breath.   What is it? She grabbed the rail and Gims sleeve.  Whats happening?  He sighed and slumped against the side of the passageway.  Engine trouble again.  Just sit tight.  Yer hatch wont work without power anyways.   Are weare we going to die now?  He gave a snort of laughter and shook his head.  Naw.  Havent the six other times the engines quit on this voyage.  Probly not this time either, little Earther.   Kiri huddled beside him, fighting to concentrate on breathing in and out.   The lights and power came back on with a dull rumble, and she jumped.   Gim straightened, towing her on down the passageway.   Set your link for star rise, he told her.  We serve another meal then, and theyll be wanting coffee.   Uhdont have a link she remembered.  Stolen.   He shook his head.  Ill bang on your hatch.   Okay.  Umthanks.  Kiri forced herself to let go of his sleeve, step into her cubby, and slide the hatch shut.  She fumbled with the hatch, making sure it was locked before she sank down on her hard cot.  Very slowly, she curled over onto her side and pulled her strongbox against her chest.  She was both glad to be alone and sorry, for it left her with her thoughts  What was Stark doing now? Sleeping in his big bed, or working out in his gym, or eating a meal? No, theyd been scheduled to take off for Frontiera today on one of his ships.  Hed wanted her to travel with him.   But maybe that was days ago.  She didnt even know how long shed been out.   She let the tears come.  Logan would know by now that she was gone.  Did he care? Was he worried about her, or relieved that she was gone.  Shes no one important.  Pretty and good in bed, thats all.  Thats how hed described her to his own brothers.   What about his tenderness, the way he smiled at her and laughed at her jokes, the way he made love to her, ensuring she found pleasure every timedid that all mean nothing to him?  She couldnt think about that now.   What about Rak? And Taara, was she all right? Shed have told Rak about Tal taking Kiri out of the club.  And Rak wouldve told Logan immediately.  Did they think it was her own fault, for trusting Tal?  Maybe they even thought shed gone with him voluntarily.  That shed chosen him over Logan.  Logan.  She wanted his arms around her.  Wanted his deep voice assuring her he had her, and she was safe on solid ground, not on an old scow somewhere in deep space, where God only knew the perils that awaited.   The slow tears leaking, she lay there, staring into the darkness.  Damn Tal Darkrunner to the seven hells.   Hed given her back a piece of her past, but hed stolen her present and possibly her future.         Kiri worked through another long day of serving coffee and food, cleaning and serving more coffee and food.   The sirens went off again as they were preparing supper.  Gravia peered out a porthole and grunted, Asteroids.   Kiri fought the instinct to dive under the nearest counter.  Will we collide with them?  Gravia smiled cruelly, her jagged yellow teeth gleaming.  Yeah.  And theyll rip big holes in the side, and youll fly out and explode  Enough! Gim bellowed.  Gravia jumped, and so did the other workers, gaping at the stout cook.  He shook a dripping spoon at the Mau.  You want java? Then shut up.   To Kiris surprise, the threat worked.  The Mau closed her mouth and returned to her duties.  Gim winked at Kiri and went back to stirring his vat of stew.   We aint collided with any space rocks yet.  Reckon Captain knows what hes doin, he said placidly.   Peering out a porthole as jagged, gleaming asteroids sailed by, each one appearing more deadly than the last, Kiri prayed Gim was right.  But then they were through the belt, and the ships engines still throbbed.  So she guessed they were okayuntil the next thing happened.   By the end of the meal, Kiri was grubby, sweaty and tired enough to sleep sitting up.  But she ate the food Gim gave her and then headed for her cubby.  She needed a shower-dry, but shed settle for washing off with cold water and rinsing out her undies before she collapsed on the hard cot.   A knot of crewmen were hanging about in the corridor.  A couple of them eyed her as she passed and the hair stood up on the back of her neck.  She cast a hunted look back at them, and thats when the attack came.  Rough hands grabbed her and yanked her into a sleep cubby.  She was slammed against the wall and released.   She whirled, ready to fight.  Oh, quark.  Her usual luck lately.  Shed been grabbed by Serpentians, male and female, watching her with feral smiles.  How had Rak phrased it? Too fast for you, so stay away from them.   The male flicked his long, forked tongue at her and smiled.  Hello, pretty.  We want to play.        35  Like hell the Serpentians wanted to play.  Cold sweat broke out in Kiris armpits, and trickled down between her breasts.  She knew what that meant, and it was no game.   The only things she had going for her were her experience growing up in the rough and tumble of the state dorms, and her tiny gift from Rak.   Oh, yeah? She sneered back.  Captain says I dont have to play.  He says leave me alone.   The female tossed her auburn-braided hair, taunting Kiri with a smile.  Well, then, little Earthling, well make a deal.  Just you give me those fine leathers of yours.  Look much better on me.   Kiri slid her hand into her pocket.  Come and get them.   Drop the pants first, the male said, his hands on the fastener of his own pants.  Aint making no deal.   The woman shoved between him and Kiri.  I want her clothes in good condition.  Youll rip them.   Fear and rage spilling adrenaline through her in a flood, Kiri waited until the woman was close to twist the tube in her pocket.  Between their bodies, Kiri jammed the tube against the womans ribs.   A-aah! The Serpentian arched back, her eyes rolling back, body rigid, quivering like a laser beam.  A strangled hiss of agony emerged from her throat.  Kiri shoved her, hard.   The woman toppled to the floor, gasping for breath, and Kiri dodged toward the door.   Whatd you do to her? the male demanded, his face contorted with rage.  He strode toward Kiri, his pants gaping obscenely.  You bitch, now Im gonna hurt you.   Kiri opened her mouth and screamed like a banshee.  Help! Rape.   The Serpentian sprang at her, and she braced her back against a cupboard and kicked her legs at him, hard.  He fell back and she grappled for the hatch.  Help me!  He sprang again, on her in a flash, his hand closing around her throat in a painful vise.  Kiri shoved the shocker against him, but although he let out a hiss of pain, he struck downward, knocking her arms down so hard they went numb.  The shocker clattered to the floor and rolled away.   He grinned ferociously, flicking his leathery tongue out to lick her cheek.  Now youre mine.  His musky scent overwhelmed her and she turned her face away, grimacing as she struggled.   The hatch slid open behind Kiri.  What the seven hells is going on in here? a woman demanded.   Get out.  The Serp grabbed Kiri by the arms, jamming his cock against her belly.  This ones mine.   Let her go, you stupid snake.  It was the dark-haired Serpentian woman.  Her face was tight with disgustshe clearly wasnt in on the attack.   Kiri dug her nails into the mans ribs as hard as she could, choking on the pain in her throat and his fetid breath.  She jammed her knee up between his legs, and he grunted in pain as her knee struck his balls.   Kiris rescuer whirled so fast she was a blur, kicking her tormentor once and again.  His eyes bulged and he wavered, his grip loosening.   Kiri shoved at him with desperate strength, and this time he stumbled backward.  The woman kicked him again, laying him out on the floor with a thud.  He fell over his partner, who groaned.   Next time Ill kill you both, Kiris savior hissed.  I dont hold with rape.   She turned to Kiri, who leaned against the wall, shaking, her limbs like water in the aftermath of adrenaline.  Her throat hurt with every breath, her arms ached from being grabbed and her head and back where shed been jammed against the wall.   Thanks, she croaked through her sore throat.  They were going to  Rape you and steal your leather, the woman finished, with a curl of her lip.  I knowor I can guess.  Come on, lets get out of here.   Kiri leaned over and picked up the shocker.  The Serpentian led the way out of the room and glared at the crew members still skulking, now silent.  So this is how you welcome new crew? She bared her teeth at them.  Captain will hear about this.   Kiri stepped up beside her, one hand on her throat.  Wouldnt drink any coffee for a few days, she said hoarsely.  Never know what little surprises I may have for you.   She set her jaw against the urge to crumple now that the danger was over.  She would show no further weakness before these men.   Skrog crap, groaned one stocky man with a greasy cap.  Knew those two was gonna get us in a black hole.   The Serpentian woman shook her head.  No more than you deserve.  Space scum.   A new pair of women came down the passageway.  They paused when they saw Kiri panting in the open hatchway and the crewmen facing her.   Whats going on here, Scala? the older woman asked.  She was a hard-faced human with gray hair.   Those two in there need to go to the brig, the Serpentian told them.  Tried to molest our barista.   The other woman, younger but equally tough, peered into the Serpentians cubby.  She let out a low whistle.  Youre still in one piece? Must be tougher than you look, she said to Kiri.  She grinned and held out her hand.  Im Lottie.   Kiri shook her hand.  Kiri te Nawa.   Im Neda, the older woman said.  Youre gonna have a nice shiner.  She clapped Kiri on the shoulder, right where the man had grabbed her.  Kiri sucked in a breath at the pain.  Nice work, girlie.  Those two just signed on.  Didnt like em, but we were short handed after Captain kicked off three crew for fighting.   They can sit in the brig til we drop them off on our next landfall, Lottie said with disgust.   Said they was just gonna take her clothes, a lanky youth whined.   Never said nothin about no sexing, another man put in.   You fools really believe that? Neda demanded.  Shes an immi, doesnt take an Oculan to see that.  Shouldve been looking after her, not treating her like a peep show.   Kiri listened gratefully as the woman promised to laser their balls if they didnt look after Kiri for the rest of the voyage.  Neda was clearly a respected crew leader.   Come on, Scala said quietly.  You look pale as a moonhen.   The thought of going back to her cubby alone made Kiri shudder, so she followed the Serpentian along the passageway and into a larger cubby cluttered colorfully with clothing, cushions and other items.  Scala waved Kiri to one of the two bunks and shut the hatch behind them.   Opening a trunk, she took out a bottle and two glasses, and poured two small glasses of Cremart.  Kiri took one and sipped gratefully.  It burned her throat, but soothed her nerves.   Im Scala, the Serpentian said, sitting back on her cot with her long legs crossed.   She was very attractive, with sloe eyes and a sensual grace to her movements.  Her gaze was guarded, as if she were accustomed to judging others potential danger at all times.   Kiri te Nawa.  Kiri sighed as the Cremart burned down her throat and then soothed it.   Scala leaned forward, bottle in her hand.  Kiri held out her glass for a refill.   So tell me, Kiri te Nawa, howd you end up on this space scow?  Kiri huffed a bitter laugh, and leaned her head back against the wall.  Shanghaied by a ganger lord on Earth II.  Last thing he said before he iced me was that someone wanted me to disappear.   Scalas winged brows flew up.  Really? Do tell.   Kiri thought back over the last weeks of her life.  It all started with a wager.   She started to talk, and before she knew it, shed told her hostess about Stark and her meeting with Tal, to get her strongbox.   So who do you think wanted you to disappear? the other woman asked.   Kiri opened her mouth, and then shook her head.   Wild guess.   Sounds so ridiculous, but . . .  theres one person.  Kiri told Scala about Haassea and her possessive attitude around Stark.   Scala shrugged.  Rich people get the idea they can do anything.  And we Serps can be vengeful.   Thats what another Serpentian told me, Kiri said.  All I know is, when I get off this ship, Im going to get a job of some kind.  Then Im going to get enough credit to go back there, and Im going to kill Tal Darkrunner, if its the last thing I do.   Scala laughed, shaking her head as if Kiri were naive.  Youre going back to that dirty planet to mess with a ganger? Girl, cut your losses and consider your luck starry that you ended up on this ship.  Theres a lot worse rides you could have landed on.   Like what? Kiri looked around at the scarred walls of the tiny room.   Slave ships.  Scala gazed at something only she could see, her nostrils flared.  Ive seen them unloading their sorry cargo in some of the toughest space ports in the galaxy.  Pretty young things, boys and girls, herded like filthy, whipped beasts.   Kiri swallowed hard, as dark memories swamped her.   Sibilant voices outside her sleep cubby.  Murmuring in oily Galactic.  Heres a fine one . . .  bring a good price . . .  take him and go.  Lying frozen in the light of the glowlamp, eerily cheerful in contrast to the red pool spreading under the door.  A whimper, cut off sharply and then only receding footsteps . . .  and silence.   Her empty glass hit the floor and rolled with a small clatter.  No.   She clamped her hands to her head, slammed backward in time as if in a time warp.  She squeezed her eyes shut, shaking her head.  Which was real, that world or this?  Hey.  A warm hand smoothed her back.  Opening her eyes, Kiri came back to the present with a gasp.  Scala knelt beside her, frowning at Kiri in concern.  Hey, whered you go, little Earther?  Slavers, Kiri choked.  They took . . .  someone.  My brother.   Quark, you and yours have blackish luck, eh?  Kiri tried to laugh.  Yeah, guess so.  And now she understood a little of how Kai mustve felt when he was taken, as if hed been ripped from his world and dragged into the void, possibly to be devoured.   Scala squeezed her hands, and then let go.  Well, enough of that skrog crap.  Youll be okay.  Well get you to Frontiera, good place for the law-abiding.  They got a sat-com system now that spots strange ships as soon as they come in range, I hear.   Are you staying there? It would be good to have a friend while she sorted out what to do.   Scala smiled, although it didnt reach her eyes.  No.  Lets just say Im one of the ones the sat-com system is supposed to keep out.   Id vouch for you, Kiri said.  In case anyone wants to listen to a barista.   Scala gave her an odd look.  Youve more pull than that, starry girl.  Logan Stark is known throughout the galaxy.  His ships are famous.  Flew on one myself for a few months.   Bitterness twisted her mouth, but then she moved her slender shoulders as if shaking off a bad memory.  Anyway, you see him again, you tell him Scala helped you out.  Maybe thatll even the score a little.   Kiri wanted desperately to ask what the woman had done to anger Stark, but it was none of her business.  The Serpentian had saved her when the loutish crewmen wouldnt, so the least she could do was leave her privacy intact.  She nodded.   I will.  If she ever saw him again.  If he wanted anything to do with her.   Tell you what, Scala offered.  Why dont you bunk here with me for the rest of the voyage?  Kiri looked at her in surprise.  You wouldnt mind?  Scala shrugged, a sly twinkle in her eyes.  You liven things up, you know?  Oh, great, Kiri muttered.   Scala chuckled and Kiri found herself laughing with her.  It hurt her throat, but it felt good.  Really good.         Kiri confronted Captain Argo the next morning, bringing him a carafe of coffee flavored just the way he liked it, along with some bakery treats shed found in a freezer and heated.   I can get off on Frontiera, right?  He gave her an innocent look that didnt sit well on his rogues face.  Of course you can.  Didja think you were a prisoner or somethin like that?  She sighed, weary and bruised and unwilling to pretend with him.  I know Darkrunner paid you to take me, she told him.  I just dont know why.   He frowned at her over his coffee mug.  Why, to keep you safe, he said as if she were the stupidest crewman aboard.  From that old flame who was threatening to off you.   So that was what Tal had told him.  Yeah, sure am glad to be safe from him.  She looked around at the cockpit of the ship.  Listen, say we actually make it to Frontiera, I want to know about another ship that will be landing, the Orion.   He raised his grizzled brows.  Oh, wanting to ride high on the comet tail, are we? Thats one o them ships the rich ones ride, girlie.  Not the likes o us.   She managed a tight smile.  Yeah, Im aware.  Just need to know if shell be docking anywhere near us.   Frontiera City, thats where all the big ships put in.  He gestured to a holovid.  Kiri recognized the blue, green and white ballit was Frontiera.  A red laser dot blinked near the coast of the biggest continent.  Right heres the port.  And heres us.  A yellow dot hung in space near the planet.  We land in four days.  They land about  say five hours after us, not cause were faster, but because they gotta stop on Cirrius and Indigo.   He took a big bite of one of the pastries and sighed happily.  Oh, forgot.  Darkrunner said to give you this.  He pawed through a pile of items on a desk, and handed her a small object.   My comlink, she said, holding it in her palm.  Her heart lifted.  She could link Stark and Taara and Rakeveryone.  Let them know she was safe and well.  And ask for their help getting home  Thank you, she said.  Smiling at the captain, she pressed an impulsive kiss to his leathery cheek and then dashed away for the privacy of Scalas cubby.   Her elation didnt last long.  Her comlink had been erased of all links, except one.  When she tried to open the galactic directory, a tattooed face appeared on her screen.   Kiri closed the link and dropped the com in her lap, clenching her fists to her forehead.  Her one remaining link was to the one being in the universe with whom she least wished to speak.        36  Finally Kiri peered at the com again, to find the icon indicating a recorded message.  Reluctantly, she opened it.   Tal gazed at her.  You got this, star baby, you know I erased your com.  Before you link anyone, be sure you want to involve them.  This is bad shit goin on.  Get yourself where youre goin and then link me.  Well talk.   Scala walked into the cubby as he was speaking.  She stopped dead, staring at the image of the man hovering in the air.  Who in the seven hells is that?  The man who shanghaied me, Kiri said bitterly.  Tal Darkrunner.  Ganger lord and all-round black hole of male-dom.   Scala sank onto the edge of her bed, running her tongue over her lower lip as if to capture the last taste of something sweet.  Huh.  You forgot to mention how meteor-hot he is.   Kiri glared at her.   The other woman spread her hands.  What? Its the truth.  She disposed herself comfortably in her pillows.  Okay.  Tell me whats new.   My com, Kiri held up the gleaming little unit.  Empty of all the links.  And heres what he has to say about that.   She played the message again.  Scala watched raptly.  When the message was done, Kiri waited.  When the Serp said nothing, Kiri tossed a pillow at her.  A little help here, please.   Huh? Oh, yeah.  Youre not gonna like this, but I think you should do what he says.   I was afraid of that, Kiri said gloomily.  Its so damn frustrating.  I dont know what hes talking about.  I dont even know if I believe him!  Cant see any reason why hed make a move this drastic if he didnt want to keep you safe, Scala said.  He offered to take care of you at his place and you refused, right?  Kiri gave her look for look.  Hey, youve met Stark, she protested.  No contest, far as Im concerned.   Yeah, and its a good thing I like you, or otherwise Id be kicking your coffee-brewing ass out of here.  Two of the hottest males in the galaxy after you.   Kiris face heated.  So, you dont think I should link any of my friends either?  Scala shook her head.  Were only five, no four days out.  You hang on, wait til we get to Frontiera, then link your friends.   She played with the tattered trim on one of the cushions.  You could probably link Stark now, if you want.  Use my link to access the directory.   No.  Kiri was as surprised as Scala by her own outburst.  She bit her lip, but shook her head stubbornly.  No.  I  I cant.  Not yet.  Need to sleep on that.  Maybe then she could face him without his callous words hanging between them.   Scala sighed deeply.  Males.  Universe might be a much more pleasant place without them.   At the moment, Kiri couldnt see a single flaw in that logic.         Kiri was treated with new respect by the crew after the fight.  It seemed no one, even the burliest men on board the SixPac, wanted to mess with Scala, and after hearing the damage Kiri had inflicted on her attackers, even Gravia eyed her with reluctant respect.   It helped that she kept them all supplied with strong, hot java.   Even so, the SixPac was an old scow held together with ingenuity and constant welding, and each day/night cycle seemed to hold a new kind of terroron their fourth day out pirates were sighted, and all crew members were assigned lasers and flash grenades.  Scala showed Kiri how to use both.   If they can get past the laser cannons, they lock on with a flex-hatch, Scala said as they crouched in the passageway with other crew.  Then they grind a hole through the hull, and throw in a stun grenade.  If that happens, grab the nearest air-mask, and stay with me.  I can keep you alive, anyway.   Kiri nodded, but she could imagine all too well the things theyd have to do to say alive.  She didnt suppose pirates had much respect for baristas, even if she did make great coffee.   But the suspicious ship sailed past, and it was back to hard work and not enough sleep, of feeling increasingly grimier despite washing her body, underthings and top every night with tepid water and cleansing wipes.   Having survived yet another crisis, Kiris confidence grew.  Maybe just from utter terror to damn scared, but still an improvement.   And despite Raks lessons and her years on her own, she hadnt done any of it on her own.  Shed had help, from Gim, from Scala, and from Lottie and Neda.  Theyd each stepped up to look after her, with no reward but friendship.   Even the first mate, Petr, a lean human with a long braid and an obvious penchant for Scala, smiled whenever he saw her.  Hed showed up at Scalas cubby, looking startled but then pleased to find Kiri there as well.  Scala shook her head and told him to forget whatever he was thinking.  He shrugged, eyes twinkling, as if she couldnt blame him for hoping.   Trying unsuccessfully to cover her laughter, Kiri left them alone, going to have another cup of coffee in the common room.  She ended up playing holodice with Gim and the Pangaean prostitute, whose name was Latal.  He pouted when he lost and then winked at Kiri as he offered to pay Gim, the winner, in services.  Gim turned a dull red and looked everywhere but at Latal.  Kiri started to rise, but Latal stopped her with a sly grin and Kiri realized hed only been teasing the shy cook.   Scala and Petr strolled in looking pleased with themselves and joined the game.  Petr staked Kiri a small sum and they played for credit.  By the end of the game, she had enough to repay Petr and buy everyone a salty snack from the vending kiosk.   That was  fun, Kiri said to Scala as they walked back to their cubby together.   Scala gave her a crooked smile.  Was, wasnt it? Therere good beings out here, mixed with the bad.  Sometimes you have to find your people where you canwhen you cant be with your own, I mean.   Kiri looked at her with new respect.  Thats what youve done, isnt it?  Scala raised her dark brows.  Well, havent you? You dont have any family in your city, but you must have friends.   Kiri opened her mouth to disagree, and then stopped.  I do, she whispered.  I have Maury, and Illyria, and now Taara.  Although their friendship had barely had a chance to begin.   Her dawning smile slipped as she remembered that shed nearly begun to consider Logan and Rak and even Natan her people.   And youll have more, Scala said, opening the hatch to her cubby.  Wherever you decide to land.  Youre that kind of person, Kiri te Nawa.  You gather people around you.  Hells, Gim would do anything for youeven stand up to that bitch Gravia, and she ruled the galley with an iron claw before you came aboard.  Lottie and Neda like you.  She smiled wickedly.  And Petr too.  Hed like a threesome.   Kiri wrinkled her nose.  Um  no.  Not my thing.   Scala began to undress.  No matter.  Anyway, I hope you find that brother of yours.  But if you never do, you dont have to be alone.   Kiri lay back in her own bunk.  Scala dimmed the glowlamps, but Kiri lay awake, staring into the darkness.  Would she have to start all over again, on a new planet? And if she did, was Scala right, that she had everything she needed within her to make her own happiness?        Even with these new revelations about her own strengths, Kiri could not wait to get the seven hells off of the SixPac.   When she wasnt busy with her coffee machine, she helped Gim.  She drank coffee almost constantly herselfit was the only way to get through the long days stuck in the metal prison of the old ship.   The rumble of the enginesor lack of themthe thunk of the old ventilation system and clamor of all the beings on board was constant, and so were the smellsof sour sweat, stale food, and lavs that worked, but couldnt manage to vac odors.   But although the days were hard and long, the nights were harder, and longer.  Her new female friends did their best to help.   Scala gave Kiri a pillow, an extra top and a few toiletries, and Neda and Lottie lent her a blanket and an old airgel mattress.  After their shifts, the four of them watched holovids on Lotties little comlink.  They talked, about men theyd known, about what theyd do if they were independently wealthy, about their favorite Chaz Jaguari videos.   As tired as she was, Kiri hated to let sleep take her, for that was when the nightmares returned.   She woke to find Scala shaking her one night, her face taut with concern.  Hey, little Earther.  Bad dreams?  Kiri huffed a laugh that became a sob.  Yeah, you could say that.   Sometimes it helps to talk.  Scalas capable hand was warm on her shoulder.   I thought Stark cared, Kiri said brokenly.  II fell for him, even though he warned me not to.  And I really thoughtwell, turned out I was wrong.  I heard him talking to his brothers.  Guy talk.  Hehe said I was just a sweet cunt.  I hate that he said that about me.   Scala let out a hiss of disgust.  Males.  You know, they get together, they think theyre not allowed to show emotion.  Like it would make them look weak.  So they say skrog shit like that.   Kiri shook her head doubtfully.  Logan is so strong.  I dont think hed feel he had to do that.   Scala gave her a look.  Girl, youve got it bad.  He may be shiny, but hes just a man.  From what I hear, he came up from the worst part of that port city of yours.  Hes probably got thicker shields than you can see.   Kiri stared at her, fascinated by this glimpse into Starks past.  He seemed so self-assured, so in control of his world and everything in it.  Could it be that he armored himself against any vulnerability? That despite his careless words, he cared for her after all?  Scala yawned, rubbing one hand over her eyes.   Im sorry I woke you, Kiri mumbled.  You want me to move back to my old cubby?  You kidding? Scala teased.  This is the most fun Ive had since I let a sand snake loose on board.  Go back to sleeponly a few hours til breakfast.   Kiri nodded, but she lay awake until Gim banged on the hatch for her to get up.         Stark was sitting in his stateroom when his comlink signaled.  Seeing Creed and Jorans links, he opened them both.   Creed didnt smile, but then he rarely did.  Joran looked uncharacteristically grim.   Whats wrong? Stark set his glass on the hovertray.   You start.  Joran nodded to Creed.   Creed jerked his chin in acknowledgment.  Logan, dont know if this is important, but seeing how upset you are, all deep inside yourself lately, I think maybe it is.  Anyway, I cant get it out of my head, so Im telling you.  You decide.   Starks scalp tightened.  Anyone else speaking about his emotions he would have told to go fuck themselves, but because it was Creed, he nodded curtly.   Creed nodded back.  That day at your place in New Seattle, when I asked about your woman and you said she was no one important? Logan, she heard.   With all his control, Stark refrained from telling his youngest brother to stay the quark out of his personal life, that Kiri had had other intentions, even another man.   Not that it matters now, but how do you figure?  Saw her outside the door of your office.  It was cracked open.   Stark thought back and shook his head wearily.  No, that wouldve been Natan.   Creeds turn to shake his head.  Nope.  Saw him too, hes taller than her.  She was there; took off and he came along and shut the door.   Stark sighed heavily, lifting his hand to run it over his head.  Creed, she left me because she wanted to leave.  Thats the end of her, as far as Im concerned.   Creed frowned, leaning forward, his blue eyes intense.  Logan.  Youre not getting this.  Now Im not saying I know anything about women, but theyre human.  Men dont like overhearing they mean skrog shit to someone that matters to them, so I got to assume its the same for women.   Joran snorted.  Well, I do know women, and let me tell you, its worse.  Quantum leap worse, seeing as their emotions have them veering all over the place like a ricocheting laser charge.   Starry, Stark snarled.  But as I apparently meant nothing more to her than walking credit, I fail to see how it applies.   Creed gave him a look.  Logan, thats skrog shit too.  Dont think you realize the effect you have on people, brother.  Your people you got around you would follow you into Deep Six, you asked them to.  So would Joran and I.   Stark stared, taken aback by what was for Creed an outpouring of emotion.   Great God beyond, Logan.  Jorans lazy voice was exasperated.  Get your head out of your ass.  You keep this woman close for weeks, have her in your bed, get her all soft and starry eyed, then she hears you slap her down and then she up and disappears? Nope.  I dont believe in coincidence.  She ran.  Or she was upset; she let herself get put in a vulnerable position.   Vaguely, Stark heard his own voice, telling Kiri that none of her troubles were coincidence, that they were cause and effect.   Logan?  He picked up his glass and drained it.  Then he picked up the decanter and poured himself another shot.  I need to think.  Talk to you both later.   He broke the link and slumped back in his chair and he thought, long and hard.  His thoughts were not happy ones, nor were they self-congratulatory.   So, she might not have left him by choice.  Shed still hustled off to meet with Darkrunner.  She was still gone and he didnt know where she was.   His comlink signaled a new link.  He opened it immediately.  His admins face appeared.  Sir, weve found Darkrunner.  Would you like to link?  How convenient. What Stark wanted was the mans throat, bared to his hands.  He nodded curtly.        37  In a moment, Stark found himself staring into the face of Kiris old lover.  The ganger sat, or rather lounged, in an opulently fitted cruiser.  He wore leathers, his braided ebony hair bound back from his angular face.  Stark eyed the elaborate tattoos.  Women actually went for that skrog shit? Maybe it was those eerie eyes.   Darkrunner looked him over as if wondering the same thing.  The great Logan Stark, he murmured.  To what do I owe this honor?  Cut the crap, Darkrunner, Stark said coldly.  Youve been avoiding my people for over a week.  You know why Im here.  Where is she?  The gangers eyes flashed.  Kiri? Shes safe.   Safe from whom? Youre the criminal.   The ganger smirked.  Good at it, too.  People dont take care of their starry things, I do it for them.   Like Kiri.  If Stark could have reached through the link and gotten his hands around the other mans neck, he would have strangled him.   Darkrunners eyes narrowed dangerously.  Yeah, I had her, shouldve kept her.  Let her get away, thats the only reason you ever got near.  Then you werent taking care of her, so I had to.   Stark forced his own rage down.  He wanted information.  Once he got that, he could decide how best to annihilate the ganger and his enterprises.   What do you mean, I wasnt taking care of her? The only time she was alone was when she met you.   No.  Youre not getting it, Stark.  You sent her into the snakepit and she wouldve got bitten.  I sent her far away where they cant reach hernot yet anyway.   The snakepit? The only connection Stark could make was MaitresseHaassea was Serpentian, as were two or more of her assistants.  But that made no sense.  Haassea had no reason to hurt Kiri.  Was the ganger a drugger? Coupled with his lifestyle, one step ahead of the law, had he become paranoid, delusional?  Where did you send her? he repeated.  And Ill warn you, Darkrunner, my people now have a lock on your location.  Make them question you in person and they will not be friendly.  If shes with you of her own free will, thats all I want to see.  Then Ill leave you alone.   Stark, youre not the only one with ex-Space Forcers on the pay rosters.  Lets not waste our weaponry on each other when there are real slimers out there.   Darkrunner shook his head, as if disgusted with the choice he must make.  Shes not with me.  Hasnt been since she took up with you.  So, just do what you do out there on Frontiera.  If Kiri wants to talk, youll hear from her soon enough.  Who knows, big man, might be very soon.  No accounting for a womans taste.   She wasnt with the ganger? She hadnt trysted with him? Hadnt been conspiring with him? Or was this all a ploy to get her back in Starks good graces? Hed have this holovid analyzed.  Bronc and his people would parse out the tiniest hint that the ganger was lying.   Analyze the holovid.  A horrible truth hit Stark in the gut, as if the ganger had struck him.  He shouldve had the first holovid analyzed.  Was it even real? They could be doctored.  Damn it, hed let old angers blind him.   He couldnt think about that now.  The other man still wanted Kirihe was hardly going to want to chat about his sexual encounters with her.   Stark leaned forward.  Darkrunner.  If I dont hear from her by next starfall, you are a dead man.  And I can make that happen, make no mistake.   The ganger jerked his chin in wry acknowledgement.  In that case, lets hope she wants to talk to you.         The moment she set foot off the SixPac was one of the strangest of Kiris life.   The Frontiera City space port resembled New Seattles, except that it was much smaller, newer and quieter.  And nearly as frightening as waking up aboard the ship.   She was on a new world, another planet.  One with few beings and few settlements.  Through open ports in the awning over the port, she could see pale blue sky.  A welcome change from the black of space, but strange to one accustomed to clouds and fog.   Shed made it, survived deep space.  Landed on her feet on solid ground.   Turning back to look up at the ship, Kiri froze.  Shed flown across the galaxy in that beat-up old scow? She shuddered.  Thank God she hadnt been able to see much of it from the inside; shed have died of fright.   Crewmembers streamed around her, intent on their layover freedom.  Scala stood at the upper rail of the boarding platform, arms crossed on the rail, looking out at the port.  Kiris heart pinched.  She knew that bored look concealed the longing to follow them.   I wont forget to speak for you, Kiri called.   Scala shook her head, but she smiled.  Good luck to you, Kiri.  Better get going and find your man, since youre not cut out to be space crew.   Kiri laughed, surprising herself.  I mean it, she said.  I will help you.  I couldnt have made it without you.   And the othersGim, Lottie, Neda and even the captain, whod agreed to ferry her on his vessel to safety, from whatever chimera Darkrunner thought hed saved her.  They were a motley crew but good friends.   Scala leaned over the rail.  Listenyoure good at what you do.  Things dont work out with Stark, you link me.  I got credit saved up and nowhere to spend it.  We could set you up in business here, too.   Kiri stared, deeply touched by the impulsive offer.  Thanks.  That  means a lot.   I know.  Now go on.  Safe journey to you.  Ive got your link, stay in touch.   Ill be in touch.  Safe journey to you, friend.   Kiri walked through the port to the spotless, shaded splendor of the LodeStar docks, a bag containing her strongbox banging on her back.  She searched the holodisplay for Orions ETA.  Just as the captain said, the cruise ship had not yet landed.   She found a lav, used it, washed her hands and face, dabbed water in her unruly hair, grimacing at her pale, tired visage.  Gah, she looked worse than the first time Stark had seen her.   Then she straightened her shoulders.  She might look a bit rough, but inside she was better, stronger than the woman shed been then.  Shed learned not just to take help from someone stronger, like Stark, but to be part of a group.  She hadnt wanted to be aboard the SixPac, but shed pitched in and done her best, helped those who helped her.   Shed even spent her last day aboard teaching Gravia all her secrets of making great coffee.  Thanks to her, the SixPac had a permanent barista.   But Kiri had learned some things herself.  She didnt need to chase security.  She had everything she needed within her.  Scala was right; she could make her own family wherever she ended up.  Like many of the immis streaming into this port would do.  Some had brought their families or at least a mate, but as many were alone.  Didnt mean they had to stay that way.   Also didnt mean they had to accept less than they deserved.  Neither did she.  Shed give Stark a chance to explain himself and then  then shed decide.  Her heart yearned to stay with him, but she was perilously close to giving him her heart along with her body.  If he didnt return her feelings, that way lay heartbreak and shame.   She smiled wryly at herself.  Her voyage had shaken her out of her world, but maybe it had given her a bigger one.   Back on the concourse, she gaped at the cloudless sky overhead, and the green trees dancing in the warm breezes.  It was like a giant travel holovid.  It was late spring on this side of Frontiera, Gim had told her.  It would be hot in a month but now it was warm and balmy.   Scala had given her a pair of sun goggles to protect her eyes, and warned her to be careful in the sun when it was directly overhead, until her skin was used to it.  Kiri was glad of the eye protection.  This sun was not just part of a holovid, it was real, warm and very bright.   She pushed the goggles up onto her head and wandered through the space port, smiling back at friendly faces and enjoying the unfettered openness of the huge airy dome, with openings at intervals to let fresh air and sunlight in.  The dome made her feel protected, used as she was to the cloisters of life indoors.  But it let her experience the outdoors, too.   She sat again, out of the way of the busy luggage porters with their hovies, and the beings waiting either to leave or for someone to arrive.  Some of them were as scruffy as she felt.  Most of the beings immigrating here were workers, like her, here for a better life.   If she were going to stay here, she would take Scalas advice and open a coffee stand or two.  Everybody needed java, especially tired space travelers.  She could probably make a killing here, get in before MoonPenny or another big chain.  She hadnt seen one real coffee stand in the place, just a cheap dispenser in an open cafeteria.  Probably made lousy coffee.   Then a huge ship sailed into view, hidden by the dome but visible on the holovid screens.  Kiri forgot her musings, her stomach knotting.  The Orion had arrived.   She was beautiful, a graceful silver shape towed in by port authority craft to her landing dock.  Kiris heart began to pound a swift rhythm.  This was Logans ship; one of his fleet.   He would walk off the ship any sec and see that she was alive.  That she hadnt left him, not willingly.  Was Scala right, that hed only been barricading his emotions behind disparaging words? Did he really care for her? Or had he said exactly what he meant? When he saw her, would he consider her a fool whod gotten what she deserved?  Not that her future hung on this, or anything, she assured herself.  She just wanted some closure, that was all.  Before she got on with her life.   Once the huge ship docked, one section of the dome lifted, and the side of the ship was visible.  Landing ports slid slowly open, and port authority officials bustled to work, roping off landing areas and readying their rosters to register the new arrivals.   Unable to sit any longer.  Kiri eased closer to stand by the ropes designating a wide walk way for those disembarking.   Logan.         Steve Craig surveyed the holovid displays from the control room of his ship.  He had a clear view of the departing passengers, the landing zones, and the port terminal.  Everything routine, he noted with satisfaction.  Even the Tygers were departing in an orderly fashion.  Another successful voyageand a peaceful one.   Idly, he scanned those waiting for departing passengers.  Then his gaze stopped, caught by a slim form waiting at one of the gates.   Close-up, gate three.  The holocams zoomed in on a woman peering between other travelers.  He squinted then scowled.  She looked familiar.  Why? A passenger from a past voyage? She was very pretty but a bit bedraggled, her face dirty.  No, by the seven hells, that was a faded bruise.  A dockworker, perhaps?  But as he watched, the woman froze.  Her lovely face paled, as if shed seen a specter.  She shook her head once in denial, and then turned and bolted away from the cameras, disappearing into the crowds.   Craig flicked an assessing glance over the disembarking passengers, enjoying his little mystery.  What had she seen that so distressed her?  Then he saw itor rather them.  Logan Stark strolling off his flagship, a slight smile on his face as he looked down at the woman on his arm.  A lovely, Serpentian blonde with a smug tilt to her head and satisfaction in every step.   Quark it, Captain Craig swore viciously, startling the crew members working in the control room.  He knew now where hed seen the woman.   He cued his comlink.  Mr.  Stark, he said crisply.  Return to the command center, please.  Mr.  Stark to the command center.         Stark was not pleased to be summoned back onto his ship.  He wanted away, where he could link with his people, find out if thered been any new developments in the search for Kiri.  Barring that, he was ready to battle wild beasts or something equally barbaric.  That would certainly burn up some of the fire in his belly.  This waiting was hell.   Kiri was supposed to have been at his side when he walked off the ship.  Hed been looking forward to the expression on her face, to hearing that delighted chuckle when she saw new vistas, new creatures, and experienced the sheer freedom of being outdoors in the clean wild.   Now she was somewhere, God and Tal Darkrunner only knew where, and according to his Indigon security specialist, who had ascertained that Darkrunner had been telling the truth when he said hed removed Kiri from danger in New Seattle, this whole mess was Starks own fault, for failing to keep Kiri safe.   Please excuse me, he murmured to Raava.   Of course.   Stark walked back onto the ship and took an elevator up to the top of the ship.  He strode into the command center to find his friend and captain waiting for him, a peculiar look on his face.   You need to see this, Craig said without preamble.   Stark froze, staring at the holovid image of the woman waiting by the ropes, her eyes wide as she surveyed the landing ports.  She was here.  Right herehe neednt search for her any more at all.   But great God, was that a bruise on her face? What level of hell had she been through, to look like a battered wraith of herself? Shed lost weight, her leathers hanging on her.   Forget killing a wild beast.  He was going to kill Tal Darkrunnerwith his bare hands.  Slowly.  The ganger had not taken good care of his little cat.   Is that her? Craig asked quietly.   Stark blinked.  What?  Is that the woman I saw you with on Earth II?  Yes.  When was this made? Stark demanded.  How long ago? She might be gone already.   Less than ten minutes.   She was outside now.  Stark turned sharply, but Craig stopped him, a hand on his arm.  Logan, watch the rest, he counseled, a look of near pity in his blue eyes.   Quivering with impatience, Stark watched.  His gut tightened as Kiris eager look changed to one of denial, then pain.  She turned and disappeared into the crowd.   He froze, realizing what shed seen even before the holovid changedRaava sauntering off the ship clinging possessively to his arm, as he smiled down at her, apparently a man without a care in the world.  With no sign of the anger and tension roiling inside him.  Quark, maybe hed gotten too good at maintaining a facade.   He scrubbed a hand over his face, but it did nothing to clear away his shock or the shame spreading sickly inside him.  That look on her face . . .  undeserved.  And his fault.   Ive got to find her.   Port authoritys already on it.  Craigs comlink chimed, and he nodded.  In fact, that should be them now.        38  Kiri could not believe her quarking luck.   Had the entire universe turned against her? Shed finally made it off the ship from hell, onto a strange planet, just in time to see Logan cozying up to a leggy blonde.  And now she was being detained by the Frontiera Port Authority.   I havent done anything, she insisted, dodging the helmets who were trying to herd her toward a door in the side of the concourse.  I was shanghaied, worked my way to your backward quarking planet, just got off the quarking ship and I havent done anything!  She clenched her fists, glaring as passersby stared.  Why did all her most embarrassing moments happen in space ports?  Fighting tears, she followed as she was hustled through the door and into a quiet room.   The door closed behind her, and the room was silent.  Good, maybe theyd left her alone.  Except that she could feel someone in the room with her.  Fighting for calm, she turned, ready to give them a piece of her mind.   She froze and then stumbled backward, away from the man who stood, regarding her silently, face taut, gaze molten silver.   No.  She shook her head in fierce denial, a perverse part of her reveling as Starks face paled and creases of strain bracketed his mouth.   Stay away from me.  You quarking liar.   He said nothing, merely stared at her, as if he wasnt sure she was real.   Fine, then.  She had things to say, even if he didnt.  She paced, spearing her fingers through her hair as the story poured out of her in disjointed pieces.   First Tal shanghaied me.  I woke up on that stinking ship.  You know how scared I was to fly? Well, their engines failed twice.  I thought I was going to die out there.   I had to work and fightthey tried to rape me, did you know that? Tried to force me and steal my leathersthat Ive worked in and slept in for a week.  Bet I dont smell very sweet, huh, Stark? Better go back to your high-class whore, who gets to bathe every day and go to sleep without waking up at every quarking noise, wondering if theyre back to finish it.   His eyes blazed.  Just tell me why.  Why did you go to him, Kiri? Why did you leave Rak behind, when he was there to keep you safe?  She shook her head in disgust.  Simple.  So simple.  Because Tal had my strongbox.  She hugged her rucksack, feeling the familiar shape inside.   Why didnt you ask me for help? he demanded.   Why? She glared at him.  Because I heard you, thats why.  I heard you telling your brothers what you really think of me.  You made meI thoughtno, never mind that.  Guess my pride was all I had left, Stark.  So I went by myself.   He gave it to me all right.  And then he drugged me.  Said someone wanted me gone.  Was it you? Was it?  Stark shook his head sharply in pained negation then stepped closer, as if compelled.  Of course it wasnt me, you little fool.   She backed away.  Im a fool all right.  I cried for you.  Her voice was shaking now.  Wondered if you thought I was deadand then . . .  then you walked off your ship with your fancy womanyou had her, didnt you? While you were on that ship.   The look in his eyes, the dull creep of red across his cheekbones said it all.   She leaned against a table, her legs almost too weak to hold her upright.   Didnt take you long.  Did you even notice I was gone?  I noticed, he said harshly.   She grabbed at the table for support.  Bet you didnt.  I was just your current woman.  A sweet c-cunt.  She watched that strike home.   Striding to her, Stark swept her high in his arms and held her so tightly she couldnt move.   Kiri, I didnt mean itshouldnt have said it.  Youre more than that.  I noticed you were gone, all right.  And Im not letting you go again.   She should struggle, should insist he let her go her own way.  But she was so tired of fighting.   As he strode out through the door onto the busy concourse, Kiri closed her eyes and turned her face into his neck, hiding from curious eyes.  Hiding from reality.   Stark reality.     Opal was aboard the cruiser.  She actually smiled at Kiri.   Here, have a warm drink, she coaxed.  It will calm you.   Kiri shook her head.   Just tea with honey, the other woman said.  A little brandy.  No drugs.  I wouldnt do that.   Stark took the cup and held it to Kiris lips.  Drink it.   The habit of her time in his arms kicked in.  She did as he said.  Her eyes widened at the burn of the drinkit held more than a little brandy.   Slowly the shivering locked in her muscles subsided, but she was wary of relaxing into the powerful arms that held her close, into the hand that stroked through her tousled hair.   You can let me go, she muttered.   Stark snorted.  Not a chance.  Just be still.   He was so warm.  When she sank wearily against him, his heart beat a comforting rhythm beneath her ear.  It lulled her, as did his scent, his breath stirring her hair.   Logan.  Did she whisper it, or just think it? His arms tightened around her, pulling her head into the crook of his neck.   She woke a little as she was carried into a building, then slept again, this time deeply, in a bed soft as a cloud.   The next time she woke, she felt rested, but her stomach was growling, hollow.  She squinted, turning her head to look around.  She was in another strange place, but this was a room.  In a building, not aboard a ship.  The walls were a soft cream, with furniture of something that looked a lot like real wood shed seen in museums and a patterned comforter on the bed in greens and yellows.  When she sat up, she grimaced.  She still wore her much-laundered lace undies and the top Scala had given her.   A strange light shone around the edges of the coverings on the big windows.  She slid out of the bed and padded barefoot to the window.  Pulling back the shade, she peered outside.  She gasped in awe.   Outside the window lay nothing but green.  A meadow.  Shed seen them in the holovids.  Grass waved gently in the wind, as did the trees and shrubs that edged the meadow.  Many of the trees were as tall as a four-story building, with long heavy limbs, their needles a dark green.  Shed known they grew to be so monolithic from the holovids, but see them in reality was amazing.   Over it all rose a vault of sky so pure and blue she could scarcely believe it was real.   A man and two children were walking across the meadow.  They stopped to point every other step, and the smallest child bounced excitedly and then threw herself on the grass and rolled, while the boy and the man laughed.  Cute kid.  They must be immis, too.   What do you think?  Kiri froze.  Starks deep voice was gentle, as if he didnt want to alarm her.  Well, so what?  She turned away without looking at him, anger a tight ball in her chest.  I need a shower-dry.  And some clothes.   He walked past her to open a closet.  Your things are here.   Her things? She stared into the closet.  There were her pretty gold sweater and leggings and her slippers on the rack.  And an open drawer revealed undies.   You brought my stuff? Something like hope fluttered inside her.   He was silent for a moment.  Natan had your bags put in the Orions hold.   Of course it hadnt been Stark.  Hed sailed off as if she didnt matter at all.  She walked into the closet and grabbed the gold ensemble, along with a pair of undies.  Then she turned on her heel and walked into the lav, closing the door behind her with a thud.   It felt so good to be in a real shower-dry with unlimited hot water and scented soap, she stayed there until her fingers began to wrinkle.  Then at last she dried off in the jets of air and stepped out.  Her lotion sat on the counter and her cosmetics were in the mirrored cabinet.   She didnt feel like bothering with that nonsense, so she slapped lotion on her skin and pulled her clothing on, finger combing her hair.  Even clean, she looked like a ghost of herselfpale and tired, with dark shadows under her eyes.  The bruise on her cheekbone from her fight with the Serps was an interesting but ugly shade of yellowish green.   Her stomach growled again as she emerged into the bedroom.  As if summoned, Stark appeared in the long doors thrown open to the outside.  He was a tall silhouette, burnished by the sunlight pouring around him.  She looked away Hurt her eyes to look at him, in more ways than one.   Come and eat, he told her.   She stepped warily out onto a small verandah, set with a table and two chairs.  It was set with covered serving dishes and two carafes, one of bright orange juice and one that steamedcoffee she supposed.   Its afternoon here, but I ordered breakfast, Stark said, pulling out a chair for her.  Since you just woke.   She sat down in the other chair, scooting it in herself.  She wasnt looking at him in his fitted brown knit shirt that matched his hair, the sleeves pulled up over his powerful forearms.  He might look fine enough to be the captain of all he surveyed, but he wasnt her captain, not any more.   How long did I sleep?  She poured herself a glass of juice and then looked at him inquiringly.  He nodded, and she poured him a glass of juice as well.  When she looked up, he was staring at the bruise on her cheek, murder in his eyes.   Since yesterday.  Twenty-four hours, give or take.  Coffee?  She nodded, and he filled her cup.  Well, wasnt this a cozy domestic scene? She drained her juice and sat the glass down.   He was already sliding back the covers on the serving dishes.  Savory smells filled the air.  She licked her lips, surveying the array of food.  Shed eat, since hed ordered all this food, and then she was out of here.  Mmm, sausages, and eggs and gremel fruit, and muffins that appeared to be bursting with whole grains and dark bits of something.   Theres a bakery here now, Stark said, making conversation as she filled her plate.  Owned by an immigrant, Rose Masterson.  She trained at a school on Earth II and then moved here to be with her brother.  Shes quite good.   Good at what? Hed probably fucked her too.  Kiri bit viciously into the muffin.  It was delicious, moist and tender.  As she chewed, she discovered the dark bits were some kind of small berry bursting with flavor.  Well, whatever, his floozy could bake.  She forked up a bite of eggs and then paused as his words registered.   Here? Where are we? she asked suspiciously.   Stark continued to spread soft white cheese on his muffin.  We are in New Haven, at the Yolovana Inn.   She was hungry, so she finished her muffin, even if panic was taking flight in her middle.  She was somewhere new on this strange planet, away from where shed landed.  How far from Frontiera City, and why?  He gave her one of those looks that said he had a purpose, that he was manipulating events and people to suit him.  Just a few hours in a fast cruiser.  Because this town is in a lovely area, and because Ive friends here Id like you to meet.   Kiri set down her fork, and looked him in the eye.  I dont want to meet your friends.  I just need a ticket back home.  Although the thought of setting off again into deep space again made her shudder.  So maybe shed take Scala up on that loan to get her started here.   He handed her another muffin, and she bit into it without thinking.  They were really good.  Why? he asked.   Why? Because I have a business to run.  And a home to make  somewhere.  So when Kai was found, hed have somewhere to live.   He smiled, wry amusement chasing the shadows for a moment.  I thought it might be that.   Ha, ha.  Some of us only have one.  She picked up her fork again.   Some of us need to broaden our horizons.   Mine have been broadened plenty of late.  She glared at him, but he was looking out at the sunny meadow.  Kiri followed his gaze.  Wonder edged out the strain of being so near him.  She was actually on another planeta verdant, clean and beautiful one.  Thats if she didnt step off this verandah and discover it was all a giant holovid.  After the week shed endured, she wouldnt be surprised.   This is a beautiful planet, he said persuasively.  And a wild one.  Since youre here, you might as well see some of it.  Ill be here on business for two weeks, plenty of time to tour a bit.   I dont exactly have time to take a vacation, she pointed out.  Gotta get back.   He set his cup down.  I spoke with Darkrunner, he said.  He told me he sent you away from Earth II because you were in danger.  I dont trust the man, or understand his reasoning, but until I understand the situation, I dont want you going back there.   She stared at him.  Hes the one who put me in danger.   Yes, his rescue was dubious at best, and hell answer to me for that.  But he does believe you were in danger.  I want you here where its safe.   She opened her mouth.  He held up his hand.  I know, I know.  You can link Maury every five secs if you wish.  Hell, Ill hire three more employees to run your stand, if thats what it takes.  But youre here, and youre staying.  Are.  We.  Clear?  Crystal.  He cared this much about her safety? Why? For that matter, why had he brought her here?  Excellent.  He relaxed visibly.  I mentioned friends.  Rose and Stone Masterson live north of here, in Adamant.  Rose would very much enjoy meeting you.   So the baker wasnt one of his women.  Well, neither was she, not anymore.  She looked at him over her coffee cup.  Why was he smiling like that at her now, a kind of bittersweet look?  Just so you know, she said brutally.  Were not  fucking anymore.        39  Starks eyes narrowed, a dangerous look in them, before his lashes shielded them as he looked down at the cup in his hand.  Just so you know, I received a holovid the day we were to fly out, he said.  Of you and Darkrunner, in an extremely passionate encounter.   She slammed her cup down so fast the hot liquid sloshed out onto the table, stinging her thumb.  She wiped it on her napkin, scowling at Stark.  What? I havent been with him sincewell.  That one time nearly a year ago.   His gaze pinned her.  Really? You were wearing the leather outfit.  When you were clothed, that is.   Her face burned, but she held his gaze.  Yeah, I went to meet him, so what? I told you, he had something of mine.  The . . .  sex had to be from that other time.  She gave a disgusted hiss.  Should have known hed think it was hot to vid it.   Stark nodded.  I know now that someone doctored the holovid.  It was sent to me through a friend.  Whoever it was wanted me to think you were with him voluntarily.  At the time  it worked.  I was too angry to consider that it might have been faked.  I still dont know who did itDarkrunner perhaps.  Hes not a gracious loser.   Hed been upset by the video? Enough to lose his cool? Kiri felt a surge of mean satisfaction, as Stark steepled his fingers and pressed them against his mouth.   When he spoke, it was if the words were being dragged out of him.   I thought . . .  that youd decided I wasnt what or who you wanted.  Thats why . . .  the woman on the ship.  She meant nothing, just a casual encounter.   Kiri shook her head, forcing that out of her mind.  Shed deal with that later, she couldnt bear to think about it now.  Who sent you the holovid?  Haassea.  She was very perturbed.   Kiri snorted.  Yeah, Ill bet.  Logan, the woman still wants you.  Ill bet she made up that holovid.   Stark looked startled.  No, Im sure youre wrong.  It had to be someone else.  God knows Ive as many enemies as I have friends, probably more.   He rose in a swift motion and walked restlessly off the porch, a tall man with tension and anger in his broad shoulders, in the clench of his fists on his hips.  Perhaps this all happened because of me.  I may be the one who put you in danger.  Cause and effect.   Unable to sit still any longer, Kiri dropped her fork and rose from the table, stepping off the stone verandah and onto the flagstone path that led off around the building.   Tal Darkrunner put me in danger.  We may not know why he did it, but he didnt have to drug me and throw me on that ship.   Ill find out who it was, he swore.  And Ill destroy them.  Just as Ill destroy whoever did this.  He turned to her, cupped her face in his handso warm, and tipped her head so he could see the bruise.   You dont need to take care of thema friend did that.  Someone who used to work for you, matter of fact.   His grip tightened.  Whats his name?  She eyed him wonderingly.  Was he jealous of whoever had been there to rescue her?  Not himher.  A Serpentian, named Scala.  She said to tell you maybe this would even the score between you.   He scowled, and she pulled his hand from her face but held onto it, squeezing it to keep his attention.  What did she mean, Logan?  That woman is no good, he said.  Shes a thief and a deceiver.   Hey.  She helped me, Kiri reminded him indignantly.  When none of the men would.  She stopped two other Serps from raping me.  Then she let me stay with her.  She even advised me towell, never mind that.  He didnt need to hear Scalas comment about the relative worth of males.   A low sound rumbled from his chest, and he yanked her against him, his arms like bands of iron, one hand cupping her head.  Kiri let him hold her, astonished.  Was he growling?  You should never have had to endure all that ugliness, he said into her hair.  Youve been through enough.   Logan, Im fine.  Except I cant breathe.   He let her push him away but held onto her shoulders.  Little cat, I swear to you Ill keep you safe from now on, if youll let me.   I dont need you to keep me safe, she said stubbornly.  I just made it through a pretty tough spot, with the help of some good people.   He gave her a strange look.  You dont need me?  She stiffened her spine against the urge to melt against him, take that haunted look from his gaze.  I can stand on my own feet, Logan.  Anyway, beings are pretty thin on the ground on this planet, so I guess danger should be pretty easy to spot, she said, trying for a joke.  Maybe going home I can ride on your fancy ship, though.   He smiled, but it was a poor effort.  Yes, that I can guarantee.  You wont be riding on any ships but mine from now on.  He squeezed her shoulders and then let her go.  For an instant she wished he hadnt.   I know someone wholl be glad to know youre all right, he said.  Rak has been linking me all week, asking for news.  So has Natan.  Ive never seen either of them do that before.   Kiris heart swelled.  Theyre both good guys.  I need to link Maury, too.  And Taara.   In a moment, he said.  Right now, come for a walk.  He stepped off the verandah and gestured at the sylvan scene as if offering it to her.   Kiri forgot her sorrow as she followed him.  The grass covered earth was soft and lumpy under her feet.  She laughed, turning to Stark to share her delight.  Its like walking on thick carpet, only . . .  better.   He took her hand, and she walked out into the grass, watching her feet move through the long strands of tender green, knowing he would keep her from losing her balance.  The scent of the bruised grass rose up around her, mingling with a sweet, spicy scent that was somehow familiar.   Whats that wonderful smell?  The trees.  He waved his arm at the tall evergreens.  Theyve oil in their needles and pungent sap under their bark.  The sun brings out the scent.   Heat draped across the top of Kiris head and shoulders, as if someone had dropped a hot blanket over her.  She flinched and then turned back to squint at the fiery ball of the sun shining in the sky over the ridgeline of the building.   Thats the sun, she said wonderingly.  Its really warm.  Even hot.   Dont stare at it, Stark warned, shading her eyes with his free hand.  The rays will damage your eyes.  Quick glances only.   Kiri closed her eyes and saw bright spots against her eye lids.  She staggered, dizzy.  A powerful arm slid around her waist, steadying her against Starks hard body.  She stood for a moment, her eyes closed, absorbing the wonderful heat of both the sun and the man.   Then she remembered and stepped away, pushing his hand off her waist.  The meadow slid into a wash of green and blue as her eyes filled with tears.   I dont want you touching me.  Not yet.   He made no move to do so again, but she felt him close behind her.   Im not going away, Kiri.  His voice held pure cerametal.  Stark, the magnate, creating his own reality.   She wrapped her own arms around herself, looking out at the verdant scene before her, blinking away the hot tears that insisted on welling up again and again.  It was comforting to know he wanted her that badly, but still   Well, I hope youre good at waiting, then.  Really good.   Because she didnt know how long it would take for the image to fade of that woman giving him the intimate smile that said hed fucked her and done a really fine job of it.  Kiris breakfast roiled in her stomach.   Stark grasped her arm and turned her to him.  Cupping her face in his hands, he tipped it up toward his.  His eyes held absolute determination, though his grip on her was gentle.   Im a very patient man, Kiri te Nawa.  And you will be mine again.  No matter how long it takes.        40  Kiri glared at Stark.  You cant know that, Logan.  No one can but me, and I dont even know that yet.   He stared down at her for a long moment.  Then something moved behind his eyes, something raw and deep.   Come and walk with me.  I think its time to tell you a story.   Okay.  She muttered, but she was responding more to that look than to his words.  What kind of story?  He took her hand in his and they walked on through the meadow.   Once there was a boy, he began.  He was born in New Seattlenot in the wealthy part, but not the worst part, either.  He had a mother that loved him, when she thought about him.  She took care of him, fed him and sent him to school.  But most of the time, her attention was caught up in his father.  His father, who was rarely thereflew in once a month or so, ruffled his sons hair, took his wife to bed and hung around for a day or so, then disappeared again, off to wheel and deal.   Until the boy was fourteen and the father disappeared for good.  Things had been getting worse for a while, there wasnt quite enough food to eat and the boys mother sank deeper into depression.  Didnt pay attention to the boy, just sat and pined for the man.  Starving herself, getting sick and not caring.  The boy tried to take care of her, tried to fix what was broken, but he wasnt enough.   Kiri was listening now with every iota fixed on Stark, her heart pounding with dread for whatever was coming.  She knew it was going to be bad.   Then one evening another woman appeared at their little apartment.  She had a boy by the hand.  A dirty, skinny kid, about eleven, with dark red hair and eyes  just like the older boys.  She told them he was another son of the father, the credit hed given her was gone and she wasnt feeding him anymore.   Kiri gasped and Starks hand tightened on hers.   The mother would have turned her away but the boy  You, Kiri whispered.  Say it. Youre the boy, arent you?  He gave her a veiled look, but it was poor shield for the soul-deep turmoil she saw behind it.  Kiri held his gaze, gave him hers back.   Yes.  I said no, we had to keep him.  He wasit was obvious he was my brother.   Which one? she breathed.   Joran.  Ah, the one who looked like Stark.   And  your other brother?  His hand tightened again, his grip hurting her, but she didnt protest.   Creed.  We  found him, Joran and I.   They had passed into the shadows of the tall evergreens.  The earth was soft under their feet, layered with the dry needles.  The air was cool, and filled with that magical scent, so strong it was like perfume.   How did you find him?  Stark gazed out at the meadow, his eyes squinted slightly against the sunlight, but Kiri had the sense he saw none of the beauty before them.   Turned out my father hadnt been traveling far, just to his different women and gambling establishments, where he was a dealer.  He hooked up with whores and any woman foolish enough to believe his lies.   Thats why you were worried I was a gambler, she breathed.   He nodded.  He died in a crooked gambling house, lasered in some drunken argument.  My mother died not long after.  Walked in front of an airbus at the stop nearest our house.  Never figured out if it was an accident, or she just couldnt live with the knowledge hed been fucking around on her.  Though why in the seven hells it should have surprised her, Ive never understood.  Even I knew he didnt think of us when he was gone.  He never  brought me anything from his travels.  Never had stories to tell of where hed been.   Kiri clasped his arm with her free hand, her heart swelling with pain for the boy hed been.   Shed lost her family, but at least she knew shed been loved.  She took a deep breath, willed her voice to remain steady.  So then what did you do?  Lost the apartment, he said, almost absently.  They were going to put Joran in a crche, me in a labor school.  But I didnt like the looks of the men who came to pick him up.  He was  a handsome boy.  And he fought when they tried to take him, so we didnt let them.   Kiri stared up at him.  Twelve- and fourteen-year-old boys against two grown men and they hadnt let them do something? She nodded.  Ah, thatsthats good.  So then?  We were on the streets.  Joran had grown up in the slums, knew some hidey holes, some places to get food, so thats where we went.  And where we found Creed.   He looked at her for the first time.  Creeds not our blood brother.  Hes ours because we took him from a pimp.   Oh, Logan.   Stark nodded grimly.  Intended to whore him to pedophiles.  Im not altogether sure he hadnt already.  Hes never said.  Didnt speak for months, didnt do anything but stay close to us like a skinny little shadow with huge eyes.  Theyre blue, like that sky.   Kiri wrested her hand from his and threw her arms around him, pressing her face against his chest.  Oh, Logan.  Thank God you found him.   His arm closed around her and he curled his other hand around the side of her throat, his thumb tipping her head up so he could look into her eyes.  Kiri.  Im not telling you this so youll feel pity for me, or for Joran or Creed.  Im telling you so youll understand me and so youll knoweverything you went through on that ship, every fear, every discomfort, every threatIve been there.  Ive lived it, slept it, breathed it.  I may be wealthy now, but I didnt come from wealth.   Slowly, she nodded.  This was the past Scala had alluded to.  Stark might not be a woman, but hed known the fear of being smaller, weaker as a youth, and yet hed appointed himself guardian of two younger boys and refused to part with them.   His face softened, and she watched him come back to her, his gaze focused on her, not the cold and bitter past.  His hand worked, caressing her cheek.   I got through it, little cat, and I triumphed.  The places we hid out? I own most of them.  Theyre viable businesses now, with food kitchens and crches attached for those who need them.   So there wont be boys like Joran and Creed, she whispered.   He shrugged.  We cant save them all.  But LodeStar can help by giving jobs to their parents, those who are willing to work.   His hand tightened, framing her cheek.  And youIll keep you safe if youll let me.  Protect you so youre never vulnerable again to slime like Darkrunner and his kind.  And Ill prove myself worthy of your trust, as well.   The ice around her heart cracked, the image of that other woman not burning quite as harshly, muted by what hed just shared.   His past had made him a man who thought he always had to be in control, who blazed his way through obstacles and people when he could, but it had also made him a protector, a man who would look after those he considered his.   Shed remind him later that she didnt need protecting.  He wanted a chance to prove himself, and she had the sense hed apply every bit of his formidable will and intelligence to the task.  And that just might make it worth the work it would take a woman to get to the core of himat least she hoped so.   Logan Stark, what am I going to do with you?  His gaze went molten and his arm tightened around her, holding her close against his hard body.   Stay with me, Kiri te Nawa, and well find out together.
