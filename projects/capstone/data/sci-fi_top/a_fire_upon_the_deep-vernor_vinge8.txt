An audible message in Triskweline was repeating over and over, "Warning.Transition to Slowness detected.Execute back jump at once!Warning.Transition to Slowness detected.Execute"  "Turn that off!"Ravna grabbed a saddle and strapped herself down.She was actually feeling dizzy, though that could only be (a very natural) panic."Some bottom lugger this is.We run right into the Slow Zone, and all it can do is spout warnings after the fact!"Greenstalk drifted closer, "tiptoeing" off the ceiling with her tendrils."Even bottom luggers can't avoid things like this, My Lady Ravna"  Pham said something at the ship and most of the displays cleared.Blueshell: "Even a huge Zone storm doesn't normally extend more than a few light years.We were two hundred light years above the Zone boundary.What hit us must be a monster surge, the sort of thing you only read about in archives. "Small consolation."We knew something like this could happen," Pham said."Things have been getting awfully rough the last few weeks. "For a change, he didn't seem too upset."Yes," she said."We expected a slowing maybe, but not The Slowness. "We are trapped."Where's the nearest habitable system?Ten light years?Fifty?"The vision of darkness had a new reality, and the starscape beyond the ship's walls was no longer a friendly, steadying thing.Surrounded by unending nothingness, moving at some vanishing fraction of the speed of light entombed.All the courage of Kjet Svensndot and his fleet, for nothing.Jefri Olsndot, forever unrescued.Pham's hand touched her shoulder, the first touch in days?"We can still make it to the Tines' world.This is a bottom lugger, remember?We are not trapped.Hell, the ramscoop on this buggy is better than anything I ever had in the Qeng Ho.And I thought I was the freest man in the universe back then. "Decades of travel time, mostly in coldsleep.Such had been the world of the Qeng Ho, the world of Pham's memories.Ravna let out a shuddering breath that ended in weak laughter.For Pham, the terrible pressure was abated, at least temporarily.He could be human."What's so funny?"said Pham.She shook her head."All of us.Never mind. "She took a couple of slow breaths."Okay.I think I can make rational conversation.So the Zone has surged.Something that normally takes a thousand years  even in a storm  to move a single light year, has suddenly shifted two hundred.Hunh!There'll be people a million years from now reading about this in the archives.I'm not sure I want the honor We knew there was a storm, but I never expected to be drowned," buried light years deep beneath the sea."The sea storm analogy is not perfect," said Blueshell.The Skroderider was still on the far side of the deck, where he had retreated after questioning the Sjandra Kei captain.He still looked upset, though he was back to sounding precise and picky.Blueshell was studying a nav display, evidently a recording from right before the surge.He dumped the picture to a display flat and rolled slowly across the ceiling toward them.Greenstalk's fronds brushed him gently as he passed.He sailed the display flat into Ravna's hands, and continued in a lecturing tone."Even in a sea storm, the water's surface is never as roiled as in a big interface disturbance.The most recent News reports showed it as a fractal surface with dimension close to three Like foam and spray. "Even he could not avoid the storm analogy.The starscapes hung serene beyond crystal walls, and the loudest sound was a faint breeze from the ship's ventilators.Yet they had been swallowed in a maelstrom.Blueshell waved a frond at the display flat."We could be back in the Beyond in a few hours. ""What?""See.The plane of the display is determined by the positions of the supposed Sjandra Kei command vessel, the outflying craft that we contacted directly, and ourselves. "The three formed a narrow triangle, the Limmende and Svensndot vertices close together."I've marked the times that contact was lost with the others.Notice: the link to Commercial Security HQ went down 150 seconds before we were hit.From the incoming signal and its requests for protocol changes, I believe that both we and the outflyer were enveloped and at about the same time. "Pham nodded."Yeah.The most distant sites losing contact last.That must mean the surge moved in from the side. ""Exactly!"From his perch on the ceiling, Blueshell reached to tap the display."The three ships were like probes in the standard Zone mapping technique.Replaying the trace displays will no doubt confirm the conclusion. "Ravna looked at the plot.The long point of the triangle  tipped by the OOB  pointed almost directly toward the heart of the galaxy."It must have been a huge, clifflike thing perpendicular to the rest of the surface. ""A monster wave sweeping sideways!"said Greenstalk."And that's also why it won't last long. ""Yes.It's the radial changes that are most often long term.This thing must have a trailing edge.We should pass through it in a few hours  and back into the Beyond. "So there was still a race to be won or lost.The first hours were strange."A few hours," had been Blueshell's estimate of when they would be back in the Beyond.They hung around the bridge, alternately watching the clock and stewing about the strange conversations just completed.Pham was building himself back to trigger tension.Any time now, they would be back in the Beyond.What to do then?If only a few ships were perverted, perhaps Svensndot could still coordinate an attack.Would that do any good?Pham played the ultratrace recordings over and over, studying every detectable ship in all the fleets."But when we get out, when we get out I'll know what to do.Not why I must do it, but what. "And he couldn't explain more.Any time now There was scarcely any reason to do much about resetting equipment that would need another initialization right away.But after eight hours: "It really could be longer, even a day. "They had been scrounging around in the historical literature."Maybe we should do a little housekeeping. "The Out of Band II had been designed for both the Beyond and the Slowness, but that second environment was regarded as an unlikely, emergency one.There were special purpose processors for the Slow Zone, but they hadn't come up automatically.With Blueshell's advice, Pham took the high performance automation off line; that wasn't too difficult, except for a couple of voice actuated independents that were no longer bright enough to understand the quitting commands.Using the new automation gave Ravna a chill that, in a subtle way, was almost as frightening as the original loss of the ultradrive.Her image of the Slowness as darkness and torchlight  that was just nightmare fantasy.On the other hand, the Slowness as the domain of cretins and mechanical calculators, there was something to that.The OOB's performance had degraded steadily during their voyage to the Bottom, but now Gone were the voice driven graphics generators; they were just a bit too complex to be supported by the new OOB, at least in full interpretive mode.Gone were the intelligent context analyzers that made the ship's library almost as accessible as one's own memories.Eventually, Ravna even turned off the art and music units; without mood and context response, they seemed so wooden   constant reminders that there were no brains behind them.Even the simplest things were corrupted.Take voice and gesture controls: They no longer responded consistently to sarcasm and casual slang.It took a certain discipline to use them effectively.(Pham actually seemed to like this.It reminded him of the Qeng Ho. )Twenty hours.Fifty.Everyone was still telling each other there was nothing to worry about.But now Blueshell said that talk of "hours" had been unrealistic.Considering the height of the "tsunami" (at least two hundred light years), it would likely be several hundred light years across  that in keeping with the scaling laws of historical precedent.There was only one trouble with this reasoning: they were beyond all precedent.For the most part, zone boundaries followed galactic mean density.There was virtually no change from year to year, just the aeons' long shrinkage that might someday  after the death of all but the smallest stars  expose the galactic core to the Beyond.At any given time, perhaps one billionth of that boundary might qualify as being in a "storm state".In an ordinary storm, the surface might move in or out a light year in a decade or so.Such storms were common enough to affect the fortunes of many worlds every year.Much rarer  perhaps once in a hundred thousand years in the whole galaxy  there would be a storm where the boundary became seriously distorted, and where surges might move at a high multiple of light speed.These were the transverse surges that Pham and Blueshell made their scale estimates from.The fastest moved at about a light year per second, across a distance of less than three lights; the largest were thirty light years high and moved at scarcely a light year per day.So what was known of monsters like the thing that had engulfed them?Not much.Third hand stories in the Ship's library told of surges perhaps as big as theirs, but the quoted dimensions and propagation rates were not clear.Stories more than a hundred million years old are hard to trust; there are scarcely any intermediate languages.(And even if there were, it wouldn't have helped.The new, dumb version of the OOB absolutely could not do mechanical translation of natural languages.Dredging the library was pointless. )When Ravna complained about this to Pham, he said, "Things could be worse.What was the Ur Partition really?"Five billion years ago."No one's sure. "Pham jerked a thumb at his library display."Some people think it was a 'super supersurge', you know.Something so big it swallowed the races that might have recorded it.Sometimes the biggest disasters aren't noticed at all  no one's around to write horror stories. "Great."I'm sorry, Ravna.Honestly, if we're in anything like most past disasters, we'll come out of it in another day or two.The best thing is to plan for things that way.This is like a 'time out' in the battle.Take advantage of it to have a little peace.Figure out how to get the unperverted parts of Commercial Security to help us. "" Yeah. "Depending on the shape of the surge's trailing edge the OOB might have lost a good part of its lead But I'll bet the Alliance fleet is completely panicked by all this.Such opportunists would likely run for safety as soon as they're back in the Beyond.The advice kept her busy for another twenty hours, fighting with the half witted things that claimed to be strategy planners on the new version of the OOB.Even if the surge passed right this instant, it might be too late.There were players in this game for whom the surge was not a time out: Jefri Olsndot and his Tinish allies.It had been seventy hours now since their last contact; Ravna had missed three comm sessions with them.If she were panicked, what must be like for Jefri?Even if Steel could hold off his enemies, time  and trust  would be running out at Tines' world.One hundred hours into the surge, Ravna noticed that Blueshell and Pham were doing power tests on the OOB's ramscoop drive Some time outs last forever.The summer hot spell broke for a time; in fact, it was almost chilly.There was still the smoke and the air was still dry, but the winds seemed less driven.Inside their cubby aboard the ship, Amdijefri weren't taking much notice of the nice weather."They've been slow in answering before," said Amdi."She's explained how the ultrawave  "  "Ravna's never been this late!"Not since the winter, anyway.Jefri's tone hovered between fear and petulance.In fact, there was supposed to be a transmission in the middle of the night, technical data for them to pass on to Mr.Steel.It hadn't arrived by this morning, and now Ravna had also missed their afternoon session, the time when normally they could just chat for a bit.The two children reviewed all the comm settings.The previous fall, they had laboriously copied those and the first level diagnostics.It all looked the same now except for something called "carrier detect".If only they had a dataset, they might have looked up what that meant.They had even very carefully reset some of the comm parameters then nervously set them back when nothing happened.Maybe they hadn't given the changes enough of a chance to work.Maybe now they had really messed something up.They stayed in the command cubby all through the afternoon, their minds cycling trough fear and boredom and frustration.After four hours, boredom had at least a temporary victory.Jefri was napping uneasily in his father's hammock with two of Amdi curled up in his arms.Amdi poked idly around the room, looked at the rocket controls.No not even his self confidence was up to playing with those.Another of him jerked at the wall quilting.He could always watch the fungus grow for a while.Things were that slow.Actually, the gray stuff had spread a lot further than the last time he looked.Behind the quilt, it was quite thick.He sent a chain of himself squirreling back between the wall and the fabric.It was dark, but some light spilled through the gap at the ceiling.In most places the mold was scarcely an inch thick, but back here it was five or six  wow.Just above his exploring nose, a huge lump of it grew from the wall.This was as big as some of the ornamental moss that decorated castle meeting halls.Slender gray filaments grew down from the fungus.He almost called out to Jefri, but the two of him in the hammock were so comfortable.He brought a couple more heads close to the strangeness.The wall behind it looked a little odd, too as though part of its substance had been taken by the mold.And the gray itself: like smoke  he felt the filaments with his nose.They were solid, dry.His nose tickled.Amdi froze in shocked surprise.Watching himself from behind, he saw that two of the filaments had actually passed through his member's head!And yet there was no pain, just that tickling feeling."What  what?"Jefri had been jostled into wakefulness, as Amdi tensed around him."I found something really strange, behind the quilts.I touched this big hunk of fungus and  "  As he spoke, Amdi gently backed away from thing on the wall.The touch didn't hurt, but it made him more nervous than curious.He felt the filaments sliding slowly out."I told you, we aren't supposed to play with that stuff.It's dirty.The only good thing is, it doesn't smell. "Jefri was out of the hammock.He stepped across the cubby and lifted the quilting.Amdi's tip member lost its balance and jerked away from the fungus.There was a snapping sound, and a sharp pain in his lip."Geez, that thing is big!"Then, hearing Amdi's pain whistle, "You okay?"Amdi backed away from the wall."I think so. "The tip of one last filament was still stuck in his lip.It didn't hurt as much as the nettles he'd sampled a few days earlier.Amdijefri looked over the wound.What was left of the smoky spine seemed hard and brittle.Jefri's fingers gently worked it free.Then the two of them turned to wonder at the thing in the wall."It really has spread.Looks like it's hurt the wall, too. "Amdi dabbed at his bloodied muzzle."Yeah.I see why your folks told you to stay away from it. ""Maybe we should have Mr.Steel scrub it all out. "The two spent half an hour crawling around behind all the quilting.The grayness had spread far, but there was only the one marvelous flowering.They came back to stare at it, even sticking articles of clothing into the wisps.Neither risked fingers or noses on further contact.Staring at the fungus on the wall was by far the most exciting thing that happened that afternoon; there was no message from the OOB.The next day the hot weather was back.Two more days passed and still there was no word from Ravna.Lord Steel paced the walls atop Starship Hill.It was near the middle of the night, and the sun hung about fifteen degrees above the northern horizon.Sweat filmed his fur; this was the warmest summer in ten years.The drywind was into its thirtieth dayaround.It was no longer a welcome break in the chill of the northland.The crops were dying in the fields.Smoke from fjord fires was visible as brownish haze both north and south of the castle.At first the reddish color had been a novelty, a welcome change from the unending blue of sky and distance, and the whitish haze of the sea fogs.Only at first.When fire struck East Streamsdell, the entire sky had been dipped in red.Ash had rained all the dayaround, and the only smell had been that of burning.Some said it was worse than the filthy air of the southern cities.The troops on the walls backed far out of his way.This was more than courtesy, more than their fear of Steel.His troops were still not used to the cloaked ones, and the cover story Shreck was spreading did nothing to ease their minds: Lord Steel was accompanied by a singleton  in the colors of a Lord.The creature made no mind sounds.It walked incredibly close to its master.Steel said to the singleton, "Success is a matter of meeting a schedule.I remember you teaching me that," cutting it into me, in fact.The member looked back at him, cocked its head."As I remember, I said that success was a matter of adapting to changes in schedules. "The words were perfectly articulated.There were singletons that could talk that well  but even the most verbal could not carry on intelligent conversation.Shreck had had no trouble convincing the troops that Flenser science had created a race of superpacks, that the cloaked ones were individually as smart as any ordinary pack.It was a good cover for what the cloaks really were.It both inspired fear and obscured the truth.The member stepped a little closer  nearer to Steel than anyone had been except during murders and rapes and the beatings of the past.Involuntarily, Steel licked his lips and spread out from around the threat.Yet in some ways the dark cloaked one was like a corpse, without a trace of mind sound.Steel snapped his jaws shut and said, "Yes.The genius is in winning even when the schedules have fallen down the garderobe. "He looked all away from the Flenser member and scanned the red shrouded southern horizon."What's the latest estimate of Woodcarver's progress?""She's still camped about five days southeast of here. ""The damned incompetent.It's hard to believe she's your parent!Vendacious made things so easy for her; her soldiers and toy cannon should have been here almost a tenday past  "  "And been well butchered, on schedule. ""Yes!Long before our sky friends arrived.Instead, she wanders inland and then balks. "The Flenser member shrugged in its dark cloak.Steel knew the radio was as heavy as it looked.It consoled him that the other was paying a price for his omniscience.Just think, in heat like this, to have every part of oneself muffled to the tympana.He could imagine the discomfort Indoors, he could smell it.They walked past one of the wall cannon.The barrel gleamed of layered metal.The thing had thrice the range of Woodcarver's pitiful invention.While Woodcarver had been working with Dataset and a human child's intuition, he had had the direct advice of Ravna and company.At first he'd feared their largesse, thinking it meant the Visitors were superior beyond need for care.Now the more he heard of Ravna and the others, the more clearly he understood their weakness.They could not experiment with themselves, improve themselves.Inflexible, slow changing dullards.Sometimes they showed a low cunning  Ravna's coyness about what she wanted from the first starship  but their desperation was loud in all their messages, as was their attachment to the human child.Everything had been going so well till just a few days ago.As they walked out of earshot of the gunner pack, Steel said to the Flenser member, "And still no word from our 'rescuers'. ""Quite so," That was the other botched schedule, the important one, which they could not control."Ravna has missed four sessions.Two of me is down with Amdijefri right now. "The singleton jabbed its snout toward the dome of the inner keep.The gesture was an awkward abortion.Without other muzzles and other eyes, body language was a limited thing.We just aren't built to wander around a piece here, a piece there."Another few minutes and the space folk will have missed a fifth talk session.The children are getting desperate, you know. "The member's voice sounded sympathetic.Almost unconsciously, Lord Steel sidled a little farther out from around it.Steel remembered that tone from his own early existence.He also remembered the cutting and death that had always followed."I want them kept happy, Tyrathect.We're assuming communication will resume; when it does we'll need them. "Steel bared six pairs of jaws at the surrounded singleton."None of your old tricks. "The member flinched, an almost imperceptible twitch that pleased Steel more than the grovelling of ten thousand."Of course not.I'm just saying that you should visit them, try to help them with their fear. ""You do it. ""Ah they don't fully trust me.I've told you before, Steel; they love you. ""Ha!And they've seen through to your meanness, eh?"The situation made Steel proud.He had succeeded where Flenser's own methods would have failed.He had manipulated without threats or pain.It had been Steel's craziest experiment, and certainly his most profitable.But " Look, I don't have time to wetnurse anyone.It's a tiresome thing to talk to those two. "And it was very tiresome to hold his temper, to suffer Jefri's "petting" and Amdi's pranks.In the beginning, Steel had insisted that no one else have close contact with the children.They were too important to expose to others; the most casual slipup might show them the truth and ruin them.Even now, Tyrathect was the only pack besides himself who had regular contact.But for Steel, every meeting was worse than the last, an ultimate test of his self control.It was hard to think straight in a killing rage, and that's how almost every conversation with them ended for Steel.How wonderful it would be when the space folk landed.Then he could use the other end of the tool that was Amdijefri.Then there would be no need to have their trust and friendship.Then he would have a lever, something to torture and kill to enforce his demands.Of course, if the aliens never landed, or if "We must do something!I will not be flotsam on the wave of the future. "Steel lashed at the scaffolding that ran along the inner side of the parapet, shredding the wood with his gleaming tines."We can't do anything about the aliens, so let's deal with Woodcarver.Yes!"He smiled at the Flenser member."Ironic, isn't it?For a hundred years, you sought her destruction.Now I can succeed.What would have been your great triumph is for me just an annoying detour, undertaken because greater projects are temporarily delayed. "The cloaked one did not look impressed."There is a little matter of gifts falling out of the sky. ""Yes, into my open jaws.And that is my good fortune, isn't it?"He walked on several paces, chuckling to himself."Yes.It's time to have Vendacious bring his trusting Queen in for the slaughter.Maybe it will interfere with other events, but I know, we'll have the battle east of here. ""The Margrum Climb?""Correct.Woodcarver's forces should be well concentrated coming up the defile.We'll move our cannon over there, set them behind the ridgeline at the top of the Climb.It will be easy to destroy all her people.And it's far enough from Starship Hill; even if the space folk arrive at the same time, we can keep the two projects separate. "The singleton didn't say anything, and after a moment Steel glared at him."Yes dear teacher, I know there is a risk.I know it splits our forces.But we've got an army sitting on our doorstep.They've arrived inconveniently late, but even Vendacious can't make them turn around and go home.And if he tries to stall things, the Queen might Can you predict just what she would do?"" No.She has always had a way with the unexpected. ""She might even see through Vendacious' fraud.So.We take a small chance, and destroy her now.You are with Farscout Rangolith?""Yes.Two of me. ""Tell him to get word to Vendacious.He is to have the Queen's army coming up Margrum Climb not less than two days from now.Feel free to elaborate; you know the region better than I.  We'll work out final details when both sides are in position. "It was a wonderful thing to be the effective commander of both sides in a battle!"One more thing.It's important and Vendacious must see to it within the dayaround: I want Woodcarver's human dead. ""What harm can she do?""That's a stupid question," especially coming from you."We don't know when Ravna and Pham may reach us.Till we have them safe in our jaws, the Johanna creature is a dangerous thing to have nearby.Tell Vendacious to make it look like an accident, but I want that Two Legs dead. "Flenser was everywhere.It was a form of godhood he'd dreamed of since he'd been Woodcarver's newby.While one of him talked to Steel, two others lounged about the Starship with Amdijefri, and two more padded through light forest just north of Woodcarver's encampment.Paradise can also be an agony, and each day the torment was a little harder to bear.In the first place, this summer was as insufferably hot as any in the North.And the radio cloaks were not merely hot and heavy.They necessarily covered his members' tympana.And unlike other uncomfortable costumes, the price of taking these off for even a moment was mindlessness.His first trials had lasted just an hour or two.Then had come a five day expedition with Farscout Rangolith, providing Steel with instant information and instant command of the country around Starhip Hill.It had taken a couple of dayarounds to recover from the sores and aches of the radio cloaks.This latest exercise in omniscience had lasted twelve days.Wearing the cloaks all the time was impossible.Every day in a rotation, one of his members threw off its radio, was bathed, and had its cloak's liner changed.It was Flenser's hour of daily madness, when sometimes the weak willed Tyrathect would come back to mind, vainly trying to reestablish her dominance.It didn't matter.With one of his members disconnected, the remaining pack was only four.There are foursomes of normal intelligence, but none existed in Flenser/Tyrathect.The bathing and recloaking were all done in a confused haze.And of course, even though Flenser was "everywhere at once", he wasn't any smarter than before.After the first jarring experiments, he got the hang of seeing/hearing scenes that were radically different  but it was as difficult as ever to carry on multiple conversations.When he was bantering with Steel, his other members had very little to say to Amdijefri or to Rangolith's scouts.Lord Steel was done with him.Flenser walked along the parapets with his former student, but if Steel had said anything to him it would have taken him away from his current conversation.Flenser smiled (carefully so the one with Steel would not show it).Steel thought he was talking to Farscout Rangolith just now.Oh, he would do that in a few minutes.One advantage of his situation was that no one could know for sure everything Flenser was up to.If he was careful, he would eventually rule here again.It was a dangerous game, and the cloaks were themselves dangerous devices.Keep a cloak out of sunlight for a few hours and it lost power, and the member wearing it was cut off from the pack.Worse was the problem of static  that was a mantis word.The second set of cloaks had killed its user, and the Spacers weren't sure of the cause, except that it was some sort of "interference" problem.Flenser had experienced nothing so extreme.But sometimes on his farthest hikes with Rangolith, or when a cloak's power faded there was an incredible shrieking in his mind, like a dozen packs crowding close, sounds that scaled between sex madness and killing frenzy.Tyrathect seemed to like times like that; she'd come bounding out of the confusion, swamping him with her soft hate.Normally she lurked around the edges of his consciousness, tweaking a word here, a motive there.After the static, she was much worse; on one occasion she'd held control for almost a dayaround.Given a year without crises, Flenser could have studied Ty and Ra and Thect and done a proper excision.Thect, the member with the white tipped ears, was probably the one to kill: it wasn't bright, but it was likely the capstone of the trio.With a precisely crafted replacement, Flenser might be even greater than before the massacre at Parliament Bowl.But for now, Flenser was stuck; soul surgery on one's self was an awesome challenge  even to The Master.So.Careful.Careful.Keep the cloaks well charged, take no long trips, and don't let any one person see all the threads of your plan.While Steel thought he was seeking Rangolith, Flenser was talking to Amdi and Jefri.The human's face was wet with tears."F four times we've missed R ravna.What has happened to her?"His voice screeched up.Flenser hadn't realized there was such flexibility in the belching mechanism that humans use to make sound.Most of Amdi clustered round the boy.He licked Jefri's cheeks."It could be our ultrawave.Maybe it's broken. "He looked beseechingly at Flenser.There were tears in the puppies' eyes, too."Tyrathect, please ask Steel again.Let us stay in the ship all the dayaround.Maybe there are messages that have come through and not been recorded. "Flenser with Steel descended the northern stairs, crossed the parade ground.He gave a sliver of attention to the other's complaints about the sloppy maintenance around the practice stands.At least Steel was smart enough to keep the discipline scaffolds over on Hidden Island.Flenser with Rangolith's troopers splashed through a mountain stream.Even in high summer, in the middle of a Drywind, there were still snow patches, and the streams running from under them were icy cold.Flenser with Amdijefri edged forward, let two of Amdi rest against his sides.Both children liked physical contact, and he was the only one they had besides each other.It was all perversion of course, but Flenser had based his life on manipulating others' weakness, and  but for the pain  welcomed it.Flenser buzzed a deep purring sound through his shoulders, caressing the puppy next to him."I'll ask our Lord Steel the very next time I see him. ""Thank you. "A puppy nuzzled at his cloak, then mercifully moved away; Flenser was a mass of sores beneath that cover.Perhaps Amdi realized that, or perhaps  more and more Flenser saw a reticence in the children.His comment to Steel had been a slip into the truth: these two really didn't trust him.That was Tyrathect's fault.On his own, Flenser would have had no trouble winning Amdijefri's love.Flenser had none of Steel's killing temper and fragile dignity.Flenser could chat for casual pleasure, all the while mixing truth with lies.One of his greatest talents was empathy; no sadist can aspire to perfection without that diagnostic ability.But just when he was doing well, when they seemed about to open to him  then Ty or Ra or Thect would pop up, twisting his expression or poisoning his choice of phrase.Perhaps he should content himself with undermining the children's respect for Steel (without, of course, ever saying anything directly against him).Flenser sighed, and patted Jefri's arm comfortingly."Ravna will be back.I'm sure of it. "The human sniffled a little, then reached out to pet the part of Flenser's head that was not shrouded by the cloak.They sat in companionable silence for a moment, and his attention drifted back to   the forest and Rangolith's troops.The group had been moving uphill for almost ten minutes.The others were lightly burdened and used to this sort of exercise.Flenser's two members were lagging.He hissed at the group leader.The group leader sidled back, his squad shifting briskly out of his way.He stopped when his nearest was fifteen feet from Flenser's.The soldier's heads cocked this way and that."Your wishes My Lord?"This one was new; he had been briefed about the cloaks, but Flenser knew the fellow didn't understand the new rules.The gold and silver that glinted in the darkness of the cloaks  those colors were reserved for the Lords of the Domain.Yet there only two of Flenser here; normally such a fragment could barely carry on a conversation, much less give reasonable orders.Just as disconcerting, Flenser knew, was his lack of mind sound."Zombie" was the word some of the troops used when they thought themselves alone.Flenser pointed up the hill; the timberline was only a few yards away."Farscout Rangolith is on the other side.We will take a short cut," he said weakly.Part of the other was already looking up the hill."That is not good, sir. "The trooper spoke slowly.Stupid damn duo, his posture said."The bad ones will see us. "Flenser glowered at the other, a hard thing to do properly when you are just two."Soldier, do you see the gold on my shoulders?Even one of me is worth all of you.If I say take a short cut, we do it  even if it means walking belly deep through brimstone. "Actually, Flenser knew exactly where Vendacious had put lookouts.There was no risk in crossing the open ground here.And he was so tired.The group leader still didn't know quite what Flenser was, but he saw the dark cloaks were at least as dangerous as any full pack lord.He backed off humbly, bellies dragging on the ground.The group turned up hill and a few minutes later were walking across open heather.Rangolith's command post was less than a half mile away along this path  Flenser with Steel walked into the inner keep.The stone was freshly cut, the walls thrown up with the feverish speed of all this castle's construction.Thirty feet over their heads, where vault met buttresses, there were small holes set in the stonework.Those holes would soon be filled with gunpowder  as would slots in the wall surrounding the landing field.Steel called those the Jaws of Welcome.Now he turned a head back to Flenser."So what does Rangolith say?""Sorry.He's been out on patrol.He should be here  I mean, he should be in camp  any minute. "Flenser did his best to conceal his own trips with the scouts.Such recons were not forbidden, but Steel would have demanded explanations if he knew.Flenser with Rangolith's troops sloshed through water soaked heather.The air over the snowmelt was delightfully chill, and the breeze pushed cool tongues partway under his wretched cloaks.Rangolith had chosen the site for his command post well.His tents were in a slight depression at the edge of a large summer pond.A hundred yards away, a huge patch of a snow covered the hill above them and fed the pond, and kept the air pleasantly cool.The tents were out of sight from below, yet the site was so high in the hills that from the edge of the depression there was a clear view across three points of the compass, centered on the south.Resupply could be accomplished from the north with little chance of detection, and even if the damn fires struck the forests below, this post would be untouched.Farscout Rangolith was lounging about his signal mirrors, oiling the aiming gears.One of his subordinates lay with snouts stuck over the lip of the hill, scanning the landscape with its telescopes.He came to attention at the sight of Flenser, but his gaze wasn't full of fear.Like most long range scouts, he wasn't completely terrorized by castle politics.Besides, Flenser had cultivated an "us against the prigs" relationship with the fellow.Now Rangolith growled at the group leader: "The next time you come prancing across the open like that, your asses go on report. ""My fault, Farscout," put in Flenser."I have some important news. "They walked away from the others, down toward Rangolith's tent."See something interesting, did you?"Rangolith was smiling oddly.He had long ago figured out that Flenser was not a brilliant duo, but part of a pack with members back at the castle."When is your next session with Craddleheads?"That was the fieldname for Vendacious."Just past noon.He hasn't missed in four days.The Southerners seem to be on one big squat. ""That will change. "Flenser repeated Steel's orders for Vendacious.The words came hard.The traitor within him was restive; he felt the beginnings of a major attack."Wow!You're going to move everything over to Margrum Climb in less than two  Never mind, that's something I'd best not know. "Under his cloaks, Flenser bristled.There are limits to chumminess.Rangolith had his points, but maybe after all this was over he could be smoothed into something less ad hoc."Is that all, My Lord?""Yes  No. "Flenser shivered with uncharacteristic puzzlement.The trouble with these cloaks, sometimes they made it hard to remember things.By the Great Pack, no!It was that Tyrathect again.Steel had ordered the killing of Woodcarver's human  all things considered, a perfectly sensible move, but  Flenser with Steel shook his head angrily, his teeth clicking together."Something the matter?"said Lord Steel.He really seemed to love the pain that the radio cloaks caused Flenser."Nothing, my lord.Just a touch of the static. "In fact there was no static, yet Flenser felt himself disintegrating.What had given the other such sudden power?Flenser with Amdijefri snapped his jaws open and shut, open and shut.The children jumped back from him, eyes wide."It's okay," he said grimly, even as his two bodies thrashed against each other.There really were lots of good reasons why they should keep Johanna Olsndot alive: In the long run, it assured Jefri's good will.And it could be Flenser's secret human.Perhaps he could fake the Two Leg's death to Steel and  No.No.No!Flenser grabbed back control, jamming the rationalizations out of mind.The very tricks he had used against Tyrathect, she thought to turn against him.It won't work on me.I am the master of lies.And then her attack twisted again, became a massive bludgeoning that destroyed all thought.With Flenser, with Rangolith, with Amdijefri  all of him was making little gibbering noises now.Lord Steel danced around him, unsure whether to laugh or be concerned.Rangolith goggled at him in frank amazement.The two children edged back to touch him, "Are you hurt?Are you hurt?"The human slipped those remarkable hands under the radio cloak and brushed softly at Flenser's bleeding fur.The world blurred in a surge of static."No.Don't do that.It might hurt him more," came Amdi's voice.The puppies' tiny muzzles reached out, trying to help with the cloaks.Flenser felt his being pushed downwards, towards oblivion.Tyrathect's final attack was a frontal assault, without rationalizations or sly infiltration, and   And she looked out upon herself in astonishment.After so many days, I am me.And in control.Enough butchering of innocents.If anyone is to die, it is Steel and Flenser.Her head followed Steel's prancing forms, picked out the most articulate member.She gathered her legs beneath her, and prepared to leap at its throat.Come just a little closer and die.Tyrathect's last moment of consciousness probably didn't last longer than five seconds.Her attack on Flenser was a desperate, all out thing that left her without reserves or internal defense.Even as she tensed to leap upon Steel, she felt her soul being pulled back and down, and Flenser rising up from the darkness.She felt the member's legs spasm and collapse, the ground smash into its face   And Flenser was back in control.The weakling's attack had been astonishing.She really had cared for the ones who were to be destroyed, cared so much she was willing to sacrifice herself if it would kill Flenser.And that had been her undoing.Suicide is never something to hang pack dominance on.Her very resolve had weakened her hold on the hindmind  and given The Master his chance.He was back in control, and with a great opportunity.Tyrathect's assault had left her defenseless.The innermost mental barriers around her three members were suddenly as thin as the skin of an overripe fruit.Flenser slashed through the membrane, pawed at the flesh of her mind, spattering it across his own.The three who had been her core would still live, but never again would they have a soul separate from his.Flenser with Steel sprawled as though unconscious, his convulsions subsiding.Let Steel think him incapacitated.It would give him time to think of the most advantageous explanation.Flenser with Rangolith came slowly to his feet, though the two members were still in a posture of confusion.Flenser pulled them together.No explanations were due here, but it would be best if Farscout didn't suspect soulstrife."The cloaks are powerful tools, dear Rangolith; sometimes a bit too powerful. ""Yes, my lord. "Flenser let a smile spread across his features.For a moment he was silent, savoring what he would say next.No, there was no sign of the weak willed one.This had been her last, best try at domination  her last and biggest mistake.Flenser's smile spread further, all the way to the two with Amdijefri.It suddenly occurred to him that Johanna Olsndot would be the first person he had ordered killed since his return to Hidden Island.Johanna Olsndot would therefore be the first blood on three of his muzzles."There's one more item for Craddleheads, Farscout.An execution" As he spoke the details, the warmth of a decision well made spread through his members.The only good thing about all the waiting had been the chance it gave the wounded.Now that Vendacious had found a way past the Flenserist defenses, everyone was anxious to break camp, but  Johanna spent the last afternoon at the field hospital.The hospital was laid off in rough rectangles, each about six meters across.Some of the plots had ragged tents  those belonging to wounded who were still smart enough to care for themselves.Others were surrounded by stranded fencing; inside each of those was a single member, the survivor of what had once been an entire pack.The singletons could easily have jumped the fences, but most seemed to recognize their purpose, and stayed within.Johanna pulled the food cart through the area, stopping at first one patient and then another.The cart was a bit too large for her, and sometimes it got caught in the roots that grew across the the forest floor.Yet this was a job that she could do better than any pack, and it was nice to find a way she could help.In the forest around the hospital there was the sound of kherhogs being coaxed up to wagon ties, the shouts of crews securing the cannons and getting the camp gear stowed.From the maps Vendacious had shown at the meeting, it was clear the next two days would be an exhausting time  but at the end of it they would have the high ground behind unsuspecting Flenserists.She stopped at the first little tent.The threesome inside had heard her coming and was outside now, running little circles around her cart."Johanna!Johanna!"it said in her own voice.This was all that was left of one of Woodcarver's minor strategists; once upon a time, it had known some Samnorsk.The pack had originally been six; three had been killed by the wolves.What was left was the "talker" part  about as bright as a five year old, though with an odd vocabulary."Thank you for food.Thank you. "Its muzzles pushed at her.She patted the heads before reaching into the cart and pulling out bowls of lukewarm stew.Two of them dug in right away, but the third sat back for a moment and chatted."I hear, we fight soon. "Not you anymore, but "Yes.We are going up by the dry fall, just east of here. ""Uh, oh. "It said."Uh, oh.That's bad.Poor seeing, no control, ambush scary. "Apparently the fragment had some memories of its own tactical work.But there was no way Johanna could explain Vendacious's reasoning to it."Don't worry, we will make it okay. ""You sure?You promise?"Johanna smiled gently at what was left of a rather nice fellow."Yes.I promise. ""Ah ah ah Okay. "Now all three had their muzzles stuck into stew bowls.This was one of the lucky ones, really.It showed plenty of interest in what went on around it.Just as important, it had childlike enthusiasms.Pilgrim said that fragments like this could grow back easily if they were just treated right long enough to bear a puppy or two.She pushed the cart a few meters further, to the fenced square that was the symbolic corral for a singleton.There was a faint odor of shit in the air.Some of the singletons and duos were not housebroken; in any case, the camp latrines were a hundred meters away."Here, Blacky.Blacky?"Johanna banged an empty bowl against the side of the cart.A single head eased up from behind some root bushes; sometimes this one wouldn't even do that much.Johanna got on her knees so her eyes weren't much higher than the black faced one."Blacky?"The creature pulled himself out of the bushes and slowly approached.This was all that was left of one of Scrupilo's cannoneers.She vaguely remembered the pack, a handsome sixsome all large and fast.But now, even "Blacky" wasn't whole: a falling gun had crushed his rear legs.He dragged his legless rear on a little wagon with thirty centimeter wheels sort of like a Skroderider with forelegs.She pushed a bowl of stew toward him, and made the noises that Pilgrim coached her in.Blacky had refused food the last three days, but today he rolled and walked close enough that she could pet his head.After a moment he lowered his muzzle to the stew.Johanna grinned in surprised pleasure.This hospital was a strange place.A year ago she would have been horrified by it; even now she didn't have the proper Tinish outlook on the wounded.As she continued to pet Blacky's lowered head, Johanna looked across the forest floor at the crude tents, the patients and parts of patients.It really was a hospital.The surgeons did try to save lives, even if the medical science was a horrifying process of cutting and splinting without anesthetics.In that regard, it was quite comparable to the medieval human medicine that Johanna had seen on Dataset.But with the Tines there was something more.This place was almost a spare parts warehouse.The medics were interested in the welfare of packs.To them, singletons were pieces that might have a use in making larger fragments workable, at least temporarily.Injured singletons were at the bottom of all medical priorities."There's not much left to save in such cases," one medic had said to her via Pilgrim, "And even if there was, would you want a crippled, loose bonded member in your self?"The fellow had been too tired to notice the absurdity of his question.His muzzles had been dripping blood; he'd been working for hours to save wounded members of whole packs.Besides, most wounded singletons just stopped eating and died in less than a tenday.Even after a year with Tines, Johanna couldn't quite accept it.Every singleton reminded her of dear Scriber; she wanted them to have a better chance than his last remnant had.She had taken over the food cart and spent as much time with the wounded singletons as she did with any of the other patients.It had worked out well.She could get close to each patient without mindsound interference.Her help gave the brood kenners more time to study the larger fragments and the uninjured singletons, and try to build working packs from the wreckage.And now maybe this one wouldn't starve.She'd tell Pilgrim.He'd done miracles with some of the other match ups, and seemed to be the only pack who shared some of her feelings for damaged singletons."If they don't starve it often means a strength of mind.Even crippled, they could be an advantage to a pack," he'd said to her."I've been crippled off and on in my travels; you can't always pick and choose when you're down to three and you're a thousand miles into an unknown land. "Johanna set a bowl of water beside the stew.After a moment, the crippled member turned on his axle and took some shallow sips."Hang on, Blacky, we'll find someone for you to be. "Chitiratte was where he was supposed to be, walking his post exactly as expected.Nevertheless, he felt a thrill of nervousness.He always kept at least one head gazing at the mantis creature, the Two Legs.Nothing suspicious about that posture either.He was supposed to be doing security duty here, and that meant keeping a lookout in all directions.He shifted his crossbow nervously about from jaws to field pack and back to jaws.Just a few more minutes  Chitiratte circled the hospital compound once more.It was soft duty.Even though this stretch of wood had been spared, the drywind fires had chased the bigger wildlife downstream.This close to the river, the ground was covered with softbush, and there was scarcely a thorn to be found.Pacing around the hospital was like a walk on Woodcarver's Green down south.A few hundred yards east was harder work  getting the wagons and supplies in shape for the climb.The fragments knew that something was up.Here and there, heads stuck up from pallets and burrows.They watched the wagons being loaded, heard the familiar voices of friends.The dumbest ones felt a call to duty; he had chased three able bodied singles back into the compound.No way such feebs could be of any help.When the army marched up Margrum Climb, the hospital would stay behind.Chitiratte wished he could too.He'd been working for the Boss long enough to guess whence his orders ultimately came; Chitiratte suspected that not many would be coming back from Margrum Climb.He turned three pairs of eyes toward the mantis creature.This latest job was the riskiest thing he'd been a part of.If it worked out he might just demand that the Boss leave him with the hospital.Just be careful, old fellow.Vendacious didn't get where he is by leaving loose ends.Chitiratte had seen what happened to that easterner who nosed a little too close into the Boss's business.Damn but the human was slow!She'd been grunting at that one singleton for five minutes.You'd think she was having sex with these frags for all the time she spent with them.Well, she'd pay for the familiarity very soon.He started to cock his bow, then thought better of it.Accident, accident.It must all look like an accident.Aha.The Two legs was collecting food and water bowls and stowing them on the meal cart.Chitiratte made unobtrusive haste around the hospital perimeter, positioning himself in view of the Kratzi duo  the fragment that would actually do the killing.Kratzinissinari had been a foot trooper before losing the Nissinari parts of himself.He had no connection with the Boss or Security.But he'd been known as a crazy headed get of bitches, a pack that was always on the edge of combat rage.Getting killed back to two members normally has a gentling influence.In this case  well, the Boss claimed that Kratzi was specially prepared, a trap ready to be sprung.All Chitiratte need do was give the signal, and the duo would tear the mantis apart.A great tragedy.Of course, Chitiratte would be there, the alert hospital warden.He would quickly put arrows through Kratzi's brains but alas, not in time to save the Two Legs.The human dragged the meal cart awkwardly around root bushes toward Kratzi, her next patient.The duo came out of its burrow, speaking half witted greetings that even Chitiratte could not understand.There were undertones though, a killing anger that edged its friendly mien.Of course, the mantis thing didn't notice.She stopped the cart, began filling food and water bowls, all the time grunting away at the twosome.In a moment, she would bend down to put the food on the ground For half an instant, Chitiratte considered shooting the mantis himself if Kratzi were not immediately successful.He could claim it was a tragic miss.He really didn't like the Two Legs.The mantis creature was a menacing thing; it was so tall and moved so weirdly.By now he knew it was fragile compared to packs, but it was scary to think of a single animal so smart as this.He shelved the temptation even faster than he had thought it.No telling what price he might pay for that, even if they believed his shot was an accident.No altruism today, thank you very much; Kratzi's jaws and claws would have to do.One of Kratzi's heads was looking in Chitiratte's general direction.Now the mantis picked up the bowls and turned from the meal cart     "Hei, Johanna!How is it going?"Johanna looked up from the stew to see Peregrine Wickwrackscar walking along the edge of the hospital.He was moving to get as close as possible without invading the mind sounds of the patients.The guard who had stopped there a moment before retreated before his advance and stopped a few meters further on."Pretty good," she called back."You know the one on wheels?He actually ate some stew tonight. ""Good.I've been thinking about him and the threesome on the other side of the hospital. ""The wounded medic?""Yes.What's left of Trellelak is all female, you know.I've been listening to mind sounds and  " Pilgrim's explanation was delivered in fluent Samnorsk, but it didn't make much sense to Johanna.Brood kenning had so many concepts without referents in human language that even Pilgrim couldn't make it clear.The only obvious part was that since Blacky was a male, there was a chance that he and the medic threesome might have pups early enough to bind the group.The rest was talk of "mood resonance" and "meshing weak points with strong".Pilgrim claimed to be an amateur at brood kenning, but it was interesting the way the docs  and even Woodcarver sometimes  deferred to him.In his travels he had been through a lot.His matchups seemed to "take" more often than anybody's.She waved him to silence."Okay.We'll try it soon as I've fed everybody. "Pilgrim cocked a head or two at the nearby hospital plots."Something strange is going on.Can't quite 'put my finger on it', but all the fragments are watching you.Even more than usual.Do you feel it?"Johanna shrugged."No. "She knelt to set the water and stew bowls before the twosome patient.The pair had been vibrating with eagerness, though they had been quite polite in not interrupting.Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed the hospital guard make a strange dipping motion with its two middle heads, and  The blows were like two great fists smashing into her chest and face.Johanna fell to the ground, and they were on her.She raised bloody arms against the slashing jaws and claws.When Chitiratte gave the signal, both of Kratzi leaped into action  crashing into each other, almost incidentally knocking the mantis on her back.Their claws and teeth were tearing at empty air and each other as much as the Two legs.For an instant, Chitiratte was struck motionless with surprise.She might not be dead.Then he remembered himself and jumped over the fence, at the same time cocking and loading his bow.Maybe he could miss the first shot.Kratzi was shredding the mantis, but slow  Suddenly, there was no possibility of shooting the twosome.A wave of snarling black and white surged over Kratzi and the mantis.Every able bodied fragment in the hospital seemed to be running to the attack.It was instant killing rage, far wilder than anything that could come from whole packs.Chitiratte fell back in astonishment before the sight and the mindsound of it.Even the pilgrim seemed caught up in it; the pack raced past Chitiratte and circled the melee.The pilgrim never quite plunged in, but nipped here and there, screaming words that were lost in the general uproar.A splash of coordinated mindsound boomed out from the mob, so loud it numbed Chitiratte twenty yards away.The mob seemed to shrink in on itself, the frenzy gone from most of its members.What had been near a single beast with two dozen bodies was suddenly a confused and bloody crowd of random members.The pilgrim still ran around the edge, somehow keeping his mind and purpose.His huge, scarred member dived in and out of the remaining crowd, clawing at anything that still fought.The patients dragged themselves away from the killing ground.Some that had gone in as threesomes or duos came out single.Others seemed more numerous than before.The ground that was left was soaked with blood.At least five members had died.Near the middle, a pair of prosthetic wheels lay incongruously.The pilgrim paid it all no attention.The four of him stood around and over the bloody mound at the center.Chitiratte smiled to himself.Mantis splatter.Such a tragedy.Johanna never quite lost consciousness, but the pain and the suffocating weight of dozens of bodies left no room for thought.Now the pressure eased.Somewhere beyond the local din she could hear shouts of normal Tinish talk.She looked up and saw Pilgrim standing all around her.Scarbutt was straddling her, its muzzle centimeters away.It reached down and licked her face.Johanna smiled and tried to speak.Vendacious had arranged to be in conference with Scrupilo and Woodcarver.Just now the "Commander of Cannoneers" was deep into tactics, using Dataset to illustrate his scheme for Margrum Climb.Squalls of rage sounded from down by the river.Scrupilo looked up peevishly from the Pink Oliphaunt."What the muddy hell  "  The sounds continued, more than a casual brawl.Woodcarver and Vendacious exchanged worried glances even as they arched necks to see among the trees."A fight in the hospital?"said the Queen.Vendacious dropped his note board and lunged out of the meeting area, shouting for the local guards to stay with the Queen.As he raced across the camp, he could see that his roving guards were already converging on the hospital.Everything seemed as smooth as a program on Dataset except, why so much noise?The last few hundred yards, Scrupilo caught up with him and pulled ahead.The cannoneer raced into the hospital and stumbled over himself in abrupt horror.Vendacious burst into the clearing all prepared to display his own shock combined with alert resolve.Peregrine Wickwrackscar was standing by a meal cart, Chitiratte not far behind him.The pilgrim was standing over the Two Legs in a litter of carnage.By the Pack of Packs, what happened?There was too much blood by far."Everybody back except the doctors," Vendacious bellowed at the soldiers who crowded at the edge of the compound.He picked his way along a path that avoided the loudest minded patients.There were a lot of fresh wounds, and here and there speckles of blood dark on the pale tree trunks.Something had gone wrong.Meanwhile Scrupilo had run around the edge of the hospital and was standing just a few dozen yards from the Pilgrim.Most of him was staring at the ground under Wickwrackscar."It's Johanna!Johanna!"For a moment it looked like the fool would jump over the fence."I think she's okay, Scrupilo. "Wickwrackscar said."She was just feeding one of the duos and it went nuts  attacked her. "One of the doctors looked over the carnage.There were three corpses on the ground, and blood enough for more."I wonder what she did to provoke them. ""Nothing, I tell you!But when she went down, half the hospital went after Whatsits here. "He waggled a nose at unidentifiable remains.Vendacious looked at Chitiratte, at the same time saw Woodcarver arrive."What about it, Soldier?"he asked.Don't screw up, Chitiratte."I it's just like the pilgrim says, my lord.I've never seen anything like it. "He sounded properly astounded by the whole affair.Vendacious stepped a little closer to the Pilgrim."If you'll let me take a closer look, Pilgrim?"Wickwrackscar hesitated.He had been snuffling around the girl, looking for wounds that might need immediate attention.Then the girl nodded weakly to him, and he backed off.Vendacious approached, all solemn and solicitous.Inside he raged.He'd never heard of anything like this.But even if the whole damn hospital had come to her aid, she should still be dead; the Kratzi duo could have ripped her throat out in half a second.His plan had seemed fool proof (and even now the failure would cause no lasting damage), but he was just beginning to understand what had gone wrong: For days, the human had been in contact with these patients, even Kratzi.No Tinish doctor could approach and touch them like the Two Legs.Even some whole packs felt the effect; for fragments it must be overwhelming.In their inner soul, most of the patients considered the alien part of themselves.He looked at the Two Legs from three sides, mindful that fifty packs of eyes were watching his every move.Very little of the blood was from the Two Legs.The cuts on her neck and arms were long and shallow, aimless slashings.At the last minute, Kratzi's conditioning had failed before the notion of the human as pack member.Even now, a quick flick of a forepaw would rip the girl's throat open.He briefly considered putting her under Security medical protection.The ploy had worked well with Scriber, but it would be very risky here.Pilgrim had been nose to nose with Johanna; he would be suspicious of any claims about "unexpected complications".No.Even good plans sometimes fail.Count it as experience for the future.He smiled at the girl and spoke in Samnorsk, "You're quite safe now," for the moment and quite unfortunately.The human's head turned to the side, looking off in the direction of Chitiratte.Scrupilo had been pacing back and forth along the fence, so close to Chitiratte and Pilgrim that the two had been forced back."I won't have it!"The cannoneer said loudly."Our most important person attacked like this.It smells of enemy action!"Wickwrackscar goggled at him."But how?""I don't know!"Scrupilo said, his voice a desperate shout."But she needs protection as much as nursing.Vendacious must find some place to keep her. "The pilgrim pack was clearly impressed by the argument  and unnerved by it.He inclined a head at Vendacious and spoke with uncharacteristic respect, "What do you think?"Of course, Vendacious had been watching the Two legs.It was interesting how little humans could disguise their point of attention.Johanna had been staring at Chitiratte, now she was looking up at Vendacious, her shifty little close set eyes narrowing.Vendacious had made a project this last year of studying human expressions, both on Johanna and in stories in Dataset.She suspected something.And she also must have understood part of Scrupilo's speech.Her back arched and one arm fell raised weakly.Fortunately for Vendacious, her shout came out a whisper that even he could scarcely hear: "No not like Scriber. "Vendacious was a pack who believed in careful planning.He also knew that the best made schemes must be altered by circumstances.He looked down at Johanna and smiled with the gentlest public sympathy.It would be risky to kill her like Scriber's frag, but now he saw that the alternatives were far more dangerous.Thank goodness Woodcarver was stuck with her limper on the other side of the camp.He nodded back at Pilgrim and drew himself together."I fear Scrupilo is right.Just how it might have been done, I don't know, but we can't take a chance.We'll take Johanna to my den.Tell the Queen. "He pulled cloaks from his backs and began gently to wrap the human for the last trip she would ever make.Only her eyes protested.Johanna drifted in and out of consciousness, horrified at her inability to scream her fears.Her strongest cries were less than whispers.Her arms and legs responded with little more than twitches, even that lost in Vendacious's swaddling.Concussion, maybe, something like that, the explanation came from some absurdly rational corner of her mind.Everything seemed so far away, so dark   Johanna woke in her cabin at Woodcarver's.What a terrible dream!That she had been so cut up, unable to move, and then thinking Vendacious was a traitor.She tried to shrug herself to a sitting position, but nothing moved.Darn sheets are all wrapped around me.She lay quiet for a second, still massively disoriented by the dream."Woodcarver?"she tried to say, but only a little moan came out.Some member moved gently around the firepit.The room was only dimly lit, and something was wrong with it.Johanna wasn't lying in her usual place.There was a moment of puzzled lassitude as she tried to make sense of the orientation of the dark walls.Funny.The ceiling was awfully low.Everything smelled like raw meat.The side of her face hurt, and she tasted blood on her lips.She wasn't at Woodcarver's and that terrible dream was  Three Tinish heads drifted in silhouette nearby.One came closer, and in the dim light she recognized the pattern of white and black on its face.Vendacious."Good," he said, "You are awake. ""Where am I?"the words came out slurred and weak.The terror was back."The abandoned cotter's hut at the east end of the camp.I've taken it over.As a security den, you know. "His Samnorsk was quiet and fluent, spoken in one of the generic voices of Dataset.One of his jaws carried a dagger, the blade a glint in the dimness.Johanna twisted in the tied cloaks and whispered screams.Something was wrong with her; it was like shouting on empty breath.One of Vendacious paced the hut's upper level.Daylight splashed across its muzzle as it peered out first one and then another of the narrow slits cut in the timbers."Ah, it's good that you don't pretend.I could see that you somehow guessed about my second career.My hobby.But screaming  even loud  won't help either.We have only a brief time to chat.I'm sure the Queen will come visiting soon and I will kill you just before she arrives.So sad.Your hidden wounds were tragically severe"  Johanna wasn't sure of all he said.Her vision blurred every time she moved her head.Even now she couldn't remember the details of what had happened back in the hospital compound.Somehow Vendacious was a traitor, but how memories wriggled past the pain."You did murder Scriber, didn't you?Why?"Her voice came louder than before, and she choked on blood dribbling back down her throat.Soft, human, laughter came from all around her."He learned the truth about me.Ironic that such an incompetent would be the only one to see through me Or do you mean a larger why?"The three nearby muzzles moved closer still, and the blade in one's jaw patted the side of Johanna's cheek."Poor Two Legs, I'm not sure you could ever understand.Some of it, the will to power maybe.I've read what Dataset has to say about human motivation, the 'freudian' stuff.We Tines are much more complicated.I am almost entirely male, did you know that?A dangerous thing to be, all one sex.Madness lurks.Yet it was my decision.I was tired of being an indifferently good inventor, of living in Woodcarver's shadow.So many of us are her get, and she dominates most all of us.She was quite happy about my going into Security, you know.She doesn't quite have the combination of members for it.She thought that all male but one would make me controllably devious. "His sentry member made another round of the window slits.Again there was a human chuckle."I've been planning a long time.It's not just Woodcarver I'm up against.The power side of her soul is scattered all over the arctic coast; Flenser had almost a century headstart on me; Steel is new, but he has the empire Flenser built.I made myself indispensable to all of them: I'm Woodcarver's chief of security and Steel's most valued spy.Played aright, I will end up with Dataset and all the others will be dead. "His blade tapped her face again."Do you think you can help me?"Eyes peered close into her terror."I doubt it very much.If my proper plan had succeeded, you would be neatly dead now. "A sigh breathed around the room."But that failed, and I'm stuck with carving you up myself.And yet it may all turn out for the best.Dataset is a torrent of information about most things, but it scarcely acknowledges the existence of torture.In some ways, your race seems so fragile, so easily killable.You die before your minds can be dismembered.Yet I know you can feel pain and terror; the trick is to apply force without quite killing. "The three nearby members snuggled into more comfortable positions, like a human settling down for serious talk."And there are some questions you may be able to answer, things I couldn't really ask before.Steel is very confident, you know, and it's not just because he has me with Woodcarver.That pack has some other advantage.Could he have his own Dataset?"Vendacious paused.Johanna didn't answer, her silence a combination of terror and stubbornness.This was the monster that killed Scriber.The muzzle with the knife slid between the blankets and Johanna's skin, and pain shot up Johanna's arm.She screamed."Ah, Dataset said a human could be hurt there.No need to answer that one, Johanna.Do you know what I think is Steel's secret?I think one of your family survived  most likely your little brother, considering what you've told us about the massacre. "Jefri?Alive?For an instant she forgot the pain, almost forgot the fear."How?"Vendacious gave a Tinish shrug."You never saw him dead.You can be sure Steel wanted a live Two Legs, and after reading about cold sleep in Dataset, I doubt he could have revived any of the others.And he's got something up there.He's been eager for information from Dataset, but he's never demanded I steal the device for him. "Johanna closed her eyes, denying the traitor pack's existence.Jefri lives!Memories rose before her: Jefri's playful joy, his childish tears, his trusting courage aboard the refugee ship things she had thought forever lost to her.For a moment they seemed more real than the slashing violence of the last few minutes.But what could Jefri do to help the Flenserists?The other datasets had surely burned.There's something more here, something that Vendacious still is missing.Vendacious grabbed her chin, and gave her head a little shake."Open your eyes; I've learned to read them, and I want to see Hmm, I don't know if you believe me or not.No matter.If we have time, I will learn just what he might have done for Steel.There are other, sharper questions.Dataset is clearly the key to all.In less than half a year, I and Woodcarver and Pilgrim have learned an enormous amount about your race and civilization.I daresay we know your people better than you do  sometimes I think we know them even better than we know our own world.When all the violence is over, the winner will be the pack that still controls Dataset.I intend to be that pack.And I've often wondered if there are other passwords, or programs I can run that would actually watch for my safety  "  The babysitter code.The watching heads bobbed a grin, "Aha, so there is such a thing!Perhaps this morning's bad luck is all for the best.I might never have learned  " his voice broke into dischords.Two of Vendacious jumped up to join the one already at the window slits.Softly by her ear, the voice continued, "It's the Pilgrim, still far away, but coming toward us I don't know.You would be much better safely dead.One deep wound, all out of sight. "The knife slide further down.Johanna arched futilely back from the point.Then the blade withdrew, the point poised gently against her skin."Let's hear what Pilgrim has to say.No point in killing you this instant if he doesn't insist on seeing you. "He pushed a cloth into her mouth and tied it tight.There was a moment of silence, maybe the crunch of paws in the brush right around the cabin.Then she heard a pack warble loud from beyond the timbered walls.Johanna doubted that she would ever learn to recognize packs by their voices, but her mind stumbled through the sounds, trying to decode the Tinish chords that were words piled on top of one another:  "Johanna something interrogative screech safe. "Vendacious gobbled back, "Hail Peregrine Wrickwrackscar  Johanna trill not visible hurts sad uncertain squeak. "And the traitor murmured in her ear: "Now he'll ask if I need medical help, and if he insists our chat will have an early end. "But the only reply Pilgrim made was a chorus of sympathetic worry."Damn assholes are just sitting down out there," came Vendacious's irritated whisper.The silence stretched on a moment, and then Peregrine's human voice, the Joker from Dataset, said in clear Samnorsk."Don't do anything foolish, Vendacious, old man. "Vendacious made a sound of polite surprise  and tensed around her.His knife jabbed a centimeter deep between Johanna's ribs, a thorn of pain.She could feel the blade trembling, could feel his member's breath on her bloody skin.Pilgrim's voice continued, confident and knowing: "I mean we know what you're up to.Your pack at the hospital has gone completely to pieces, confessed what little he knew to Woodcarver.Do you think your lies can get by her?If Johanna is dead, you'll be bloody shreds. "He hummed an ominous tune from Dataset."I know her well, the Queen.She seems such a gracious pack but where do you think Flenser got his gruesome creativity?Kill Johanna and you'll find just how far her genius in that exceeds Flenser's. "The knife pulled back.One more of Vendacious leaped to the window slits, and the two by Johanna loosened their grip.He stroked the blade gently across her skin.Thinking?Is Woodcarver really that fearsome?The four at the windows were looking in all directions; no doubt Vendacious was counting guard packs and planning furiously.When he finally replied, it was in Samnorsk: "The threat would be more credible if it were not at second hand. "Pilgrim chuckled."True.But we guessed what would happen if she approached.You're a cautious fellow; you'd have killed Johanna instantly, and been full of lying explanation before you even heard what the Queen knows.But seeing a poor pilgrim amble over I know you think me a fool, only one step better than Scriber Jaqueramaphan. "Peregrine stumbled on the name, and for an instant lost his flippant tone."Anyway, now you know the situation.If you doubt, send your guards beyond the brush; look at what the Queen has surrounding you.Johanna dead only kills you.Speaking of which, I assume this conversation has some point?""Yes.She lives. "Vendacious slipped the gag from Johanna's mouth.She turned her head, choking.There were tears running down the sides of her face."Pilgrim, oh Pilgrim!"The words were scarcely more than a whisper.She drew a painful breath, concentrated on making noise.Bright spots danced before her eyes."Hei Pilgrim!""Hei Johanna.Has he hurt you?""Some, I  "  "That's enough.She's alive, Pilgrim, but that's easily corrected. "Vendacious didn't jam the gag back in her mouth.Johanna could see him rubbing heads nervously as he paced round and round the ledge.He trilled something about "stalemated game".Peregrine replied, "Speak Samnorsk, Vendacious.I want Johanna to understand  and you can't talk quite as slick as in pack talk. ""Whatever. "The traitor's voice was unconcerned, but his members kept up their nervous pacing."The Queen must realize we have a standoff here.Certainly I'll kill Johanna if I'm not treated properly.But even then, Woodcarver could not afford to hurt me.Do you realize the trap Steel has set on Margrum Climb?I'm the only one who knows how to avoid it. ""Big deal.I never wanted to go up Margrum anyway. ""Yes, but you don't count, Pilgrim.You're a mongrel patchwork.Woodcarver will understand how dangerous this situation is.Steel's forces are everything I said they weren't, and I've been sending them every secret I could write down from my investigations of Dataset. ""My brother is alive, Pilgrim," Johanna said."Oh You're kind of a record setter for treason aren't you, Vendacious?Everything to us was a lie, while Steel learned all the truth about us.You figure that means we daren't kill you now?"Laughter, and Vendacious's pacing stopped.He sees control coming back to him."More, you need my full membered cooperation.See, I exaggerated the number of enemy agents in Woodcarver's troops, but I do have a few  and maybe Steel has planted others I don't know about.If you even arrest me, word will get back to the Flenser armies.Much of what I know will be useless  and you'll face an immediate, overwhelming attack.You see?The Queen needs me. ""And how do we know this is not more lies?""That is a problem, isn't it?Matched only by how I can be guaranteed safety once I've saved the expedition.No doubt it's beyond your mongrel mind.Woodcarver and I must have a talk, someplace mutually safe and unseen.Carry that message back to her.She can't have this traitor's hides, but if she cooperates she may be able to save her own!"There was silence from outside, punctuated by the squeaking of animals in the nearer trees.Finally, surprisingly, Pilgrim laughed."Mongrel mind, eh?Well, you have me in one thing, Vendacious.I've been all the world round, and I remember back half a thousand years  but of all the villains and traitors and geniuses, you take the record for bald impudence!"Vendacious gave a Tinish chord, untranslatable but as a sign of smug pleasure."I'm honored. ""Very well, I'll take your points back to the Queen.I hope the two of you are clever enough to work something out One thing more: the Queen requires that Johanna come with me. ""The Queen requires?That sounds more like your mongrel sentiment to me. ""Perhaps.But it will prove you are serious in your confidence.View it as my price for cooperation. "Vendacious turned all his heads toward Johanna, silently regarding.Then he scanned out all the windows one last time."Very well, you may have her. "Two jumped down to the cabin's hatch while another pair pulled her toward it.His voice was soft and near her ear."Damn Pilgrim.Alive, you're just going to cause me trouble with the Queen. "His knife slid across her field of view."Don't oppose me with her.I am going to survive this affair still powerful. "He lifted back the hatch and daylight spilled blindingly across her face.She squinted; there was a sweep of branches and the side of the hut.Vendacious pushed and pulled her cot onto the forest floor, and the same time gobbling at his guards to keep their positions.He and Peregrine chatted politely, agreeing on when the pilgrim would return.One by one, Vendacious trotted back through the cabin's hatch.Pilgrim advanced and grabbed the handles at the front of the cot.One of his pups reached out from his jacket to nuzzled her face."You okay?""I'm not sure.I got bashed in the head and it seems kind of hard to breathe. "He loosened the blankets from around her chest as the rest of him dragged the cot away from the hut.The forest shade was peaceful and deep   and Vendacious's guards were stationed here and there about the area.How many were really in on the treason?Two hours ago, Johanna had looked to them for protection.Now their every glance sent a shiver through her.She rolled back to the center of the cot, dizzy again, and stared up into the branches and leaves and patches of smoke stained sky.Things like Straumli tree squigglies chased each other back and forth, chittering in seeming debate.Funny.Almost a year ago Pilgrim and Scriber were dragging me around, and I was even worse hurt, and terrified of everything  including them.And now she had never been so glad to see another person.Even Scarbutt was a reassuring strength, walking beside her.The waves of terror slowly subsided.What was left was an anger as intense, though more reasoning, than the year before.She knew what had happened here; the players were not strangers, the betrayal was not random murder.After all Vendacious's treachery, after all his murders, and his planning to kill them all he was going to go free!Pilgrim and Woodcarver were just going to overlook that, "He killed Scriber, Pilgrim.He killed Scriber" He cut Scriber to pieces, then chased down what was left and killed that right out of our arms."And Woodcarver is going to let him go free?How can she do it?How can you do it?"The tears were coming again."Sh, sh. "Two of Pilgrim's heads came into view.They looked down at her, then swiveled around almost nervously.She reached out, touching the short plush fur.Pilgrim was shivering!One of him dipped close; his voice didn't sound jaunty at all."I don't know what the Queen will do, Johanna.She doesn't know about any of this. ""Wha  "  "Sh. "And his voice became scarcely a buzzing through her hand."His people can still see us.He could still figure things out Only you and I know, Johanna.I don't think anyone else suspects. ""But the pack that confessed?""Bluff, all bluff.I've done some crazy things in my life but next to following Scriber down to your starship, this takes the prize After Vendacious took you away, I began to think.You weren't that badly injured.It was all too much like what happened to Jaqueramaphan, but I had no proof. ""And you haven't told anyone?""No.Foolish as poor Scriber, aren't I?"His heads looked in all directions."If I was right, he'd be silly not to kill you immediately.I was so afraid I was already too late"  You would have been, if Vendacious weren't quite the monster I know he is."Anyway, I learned the truth just like poor Scriber  almost by accident.But if we can get another seventy meters away, we won't die like him.And everything I claimed to Vendacious will be true. "She patted his nearest shoulder, and looked back.The tiny cabin and its ring of guards disappeared behind the forest brush.and Jefri lives!Crypto: 0 [95 encrypted packets have been discarded]  As received by: Olvira shipboard ad hoc  Language path: Tredeschk Triskweline, SjK units  From: Zonograph Eidolon [Co op (or religious order) in Middle Beyond maintained by subscription of several thousand Low Beyond civilizations, in particular those threatened by immersion]  Subject: Surge Bulletin Update and Ping  Distribution:  Zonograph Eidolon Subscribers, Zonometric Interest Group, Threats Interest Group, subgroup: navigational, Ping participants  Date: 1087892301 seconds since Calibration Event 239011, Eidolon Frame [66.91 days since Fall of Sjandra Kei]  Key phrases: galactic scale event, superluminal, charitable emergency announcement   Text of message:  (Please include accurate local time in any ping responses. )If you receive this, you know that the monster surge has receded.The new zone surface appears to be a stable froth of low dimensionality (between 2.1 and 2.3).At least five civilizations are trapped in the new configuration.Thirty virgin solar systems have achieved the Beyond.(Subscribers may find specifics in the encrypted data that follow this bulletin. )The change corresponds to what is seen in a normal period of two years across the whole galaxy's Slow Zone surface.Yet this surge happened in less than a two hundred hours and less than one thousandth of that surface.Even these numbers do not show the scale of the event.(The following can only be estimates, since so many sites were destroyed, and no instruments were calibrated for this size event. )At its maximum, the surge reached 1000 light years above Zone Surface Standard.Surge rates of more than thirty million times lightspeed (about one light year per second) were sustained for periods of more than 100 seconds.Reports from subscribers show more than ten billion normalized sophont deaths directly attributable to the Surge (local network failures, failures leading to environment collapse, medical collapse, vehicle crashes, security failures).Posted economic damage is much greater.The important question now is what can we expect in aftersurges.Our predictions are based on instrumented sites and zonometric surveys, combined with historical data from our archives.Except for long term trends, predicting zone changes has never been a science, but we have served our subscribers well in advising of aftersurges and in identifying available new worlds.The present situation makes all previous work almost useless.We have precise documentation going back ten million years.Faster than light surges happen about every twenty thousand years (usually with speeds under 7.0c).Nothing like this monster is on file.The surge just seen is the kind described at third hand in old and glutted databases: Sculptor had one this size fifty million years ago.The [Perseus Arm] in our galaxy probably suffered something like this half a billion years ago.This uncertainty makes our Mission nearly impossible, and is an important reason for this public message to the Zonometry newsgroup and others: Everyone interested in zonometry and navigation must pool resources on this problem.Ideas, archive access, algorithms  all these things could help.We pledge significant contributions to non subscribers, and one for one trades to those with important information.Note: We are also addressing this message to the Swndwp oracle, and direct beaming it to points in the Transcend thought to be inhabited.Surely an event such as this must be of interest even there?We appeal to the Powers Above: Let us send you what we know.Give us some hint if you have ideas about this event.To demonstrate our good faith, here are the estimates we have currently.These are based on naive scale up of well documented surges in this region.Details are in the non crypted appendix to this sending.Over the next year there will be five or six aftersurges, of diminishing speed and range.During this time at least two more civilizations (see risk list) will likely be permanently immersed.Zone storm conditions will prevail even when aftersurges are not in progress.Navigation in the the volume [coordinate specification] will be extremely dangerous during this period; we recommend that shipping in the volume be suspended.The time line is probably too short to admit feasible rescue plans for the civilizations at risk.Our long range prediction (probably the least uncertain of all): The million year scale secular shrinkage will not be affected at all.The next hundred thousand years will however show a retardation in the shrinkage of the Slow Zone boundary in this portion of the galaxy.Finally, a philosophical note.We of Zonographic Eidolon watch the zone boundary and the orbits of border stars.For the most part, the zone changes are very slow: 700 meters per second in the case of the long term secular shrinkage.Yet these changes together with orbital motion affect billions of lives each year.Just as the glaciers and droughts of a pretechnical world must affect a people, so must we accept these long term changes.Storms and surges are obvious tragedies, near instant death for some civilizations.Yet these are as far beyond our control as the slower movements.Over the last few weeks, some newsgroups have been full of tales of war and battle fleets, of billions dying in the clash of species.To all such  and those living more peaceably around them  we say: Look out on the universe.It does not care, and even with all our science there are some disasters that we can not avert.All evil and good is petty before Nature.Personally, we take comfort from this, that there is a universe to admire that can not be twisted to villainy or good, but which simply is.Crypto: 0  As received by: Olvira shipboard ad hoc  Language path: Arbwyth Trade24 Cherguelen Triskweline, SjK units  From: Twirlip of the Mists [Who knows what this is, though probably not a propaganda voice.Very sparse priors. ]Subject: The cause of the recent Great Surge  Distribution:  Threat of the Blight, Great Secrets of Creation, Zonometric Interest Group  Date: 66.47 days since Fall of Sjandra Kei  Key phrases: Zone Instability and the Blight, Hexapodia as the key insight   Text of message:  Apologies if I am repeating obvious conclusions.My only gateway onto the Net is very expensive, and I miss many important postings.The Great Surge now in progress appears by all accounts to be an event of cosmic scope and rarity.Furthermore, the other posters put its epicenter less than 6,000 light years from recent warfare related to the Blight.Can this be mere coincidence?As has long been theorized [citations from various sources, three known to Olvira;

"By the time the brothers reached the command deck, preliminary nav displays had been computed, and a jump sequence was awaiting confirmation.The two were grinning from ear to ear as they bounced in, and strapped themselves down at action posts.For a few moments there was little chitchat, only an occasional whistle of pleasure from the Dirokimes.They had rehearsed this over and over during the last hundred plus hours, and with the poor automation there was a lot for them to do.Gradually the view from the deck's windows sharpened.Where at first there had only been vague blurs, the ultrawave sensors were posting individual traces with steadily improving information on range and rates.The communication window showed the queue of fleet comm messages getting longer and longer.Tirolle looked up from his work "Hei, Boss, these jump figures look okay  at least as a first cut. ""Good.Commit and allow autocommit. "In the hours after the Surge, they had decided that their initial priority should be to continue with the pursuit.What they did then they had talked long on that, and Group Captain Svensndot had thought even longer.Nothing was routine any more."Yes, sir!"The Dirokime's longfingers danced across the controls, and 'Rolle added some verbal control."Bingo!"Status showed five jumps completed, ten.Kjet stared out the true view window for a few seconds.No change, no change then he noticed that one of the brightest stars in the field had moved, was sliding imperceptibly across the sky.Like a juggler getting her pace, Olvira was coming up to speed."Hei, hei!"Glimfrelle leaned over to see his brother's work."We're making 1.2 light years per hour.That's better than before the Surge. ""Good.Comm and Surveillance?"Where was everybody else and what were they up to?"Yup.Yup.I'm on it. "Glimfrelle bent his slender frame back to the console.For some seconds, he was almost silent.Svensndot began paging through the mail.There was nothing yet from Owner Limmende.Twenty five years Kjet had worked for Limmende and SjK Commercial Security.Could he mutiny?And if he did, would any follow?"Okay.Here's the situation, Boss. "Glimfrelle shifted the main window to show his interpretation of the ship's reports."It's like we guessed, maybe a little more extreme. "They had realized almost from the beginning that the surge was bigger than anything in recorded history; that's not what the Dirokime meant by "extreme".He swept his shortfingers down, making a hazy blue line across the window."We guessed that the leading edge of the Surge moved normal to this line.That would account for it taking Boss Limmende out four hundred seconds before it hit the Out of Band, and hitting us ten seconds after that Now if the trailing edge were similar to ordinary surges"  upgraded a million times  "then we, and then the rest of the pursuing fleets should come out well before Out of Band. "He pointed at a single glowing dot that represented the Olvira.Around and just ahead of it dozens of points of light were popping into existence as the ship's detectors reported seeing the initiation of ultradrive jumps.It was like a cold fire sweeping away from them into the darkness.Eventually Limmende and the heart of the anonymous fleet would all be back in business."Our pickup log shows that's about what happened.Most all the pursuing fleets will be out of the surge before the Out of Band. ""Hm.So it'll lose part of its lead. ""Yup.But if it's going where we think  " a G star eighty light years ahead " it'll still get there before they kill it. "He paused, pointed at a haze that was spreading sideways from the growing knot of light."Not everybody is still chasing. ""Yeah" Svensndot had been reading the News even as he listened to 'Frelle's summary.  "according to the Net, that's the Alliance for the Defense departing the battle field, victorious. ""Say what?"Tirolle twisted abruptly in his harness.His large, dark eyes held none of their usual humor."You heard me. "Kjet put the item where the brothers could see it.The two read rapidly, 'Frelle mumbling phrases aloud, " courage of Alliance commanders substantial destruction of escaping forces"  Glimfrelle shuddered, all flippancy departed."They don't even mention the Surge.Everything they say is a cowardly lie!"His voice shifted up to its normal speaking range and he continued in his own language.Kjet could understand parts of it.The Dirokimes that left their dream habitats were normally light hearted folk, full of whimsy and gentle sarcasm.Glimfrelle sounded almost that way now, except for the high edges to his whistling and the insults more colorful than Svensndot had ever heard from them: " get from a verminous cow pie killers of innocent dreams" even in Samnorsk the words were strong, but in Dirokime "verminous cow pie" was drenched in explicit imagery that almost brought the smell of such a thing into the room.Glimfrelle's voice went higher and higher, then beyond the human register.Abruptly, he collapsed, shuddering and moaning low.Dirokimes could cry, though Svensndot had never seen such a thing before.Glimfrelle rocked in his brother's arms.Tirolle looked over Glimfrelle's shoulder at Kjet."Where does revenge take us now, Group Captain?"For a moment, Kjet looked back silently."I'll let you know, Lieutenant. "He looked at the displays.Listen and watch a little longer, and maybe we'll know."Meantime, get us nearer the center of pursuit," he said gently."Aye, sir. "Tirolle patted his brother's back gently and turned back to the console.During the next five hours, Olvira's crew watched the Alliance fleet race helter skelter for the higher spaces.It could not even be called a retreat, more a panicked dissolution.Great opportunists, they had not hesitated to kill by treachery, and to give chase when they thought there might be treasure at the end.Now that they were confronted with the possibility of being trapped in the Slowness, of dying between the stars, they raced for their separate safety.Their bulletins to the newsgroups were full of bravado, but their maneuver couldn't be disguised.Former neutrals pointed to the discrepancy; more and more it was accepted that the Alliance was built around the Aprahanti Hegemony and perhaps had other motives than altruistic opposition to the Blight.There was nervous speculation about who might next receive Alliance attention.Major transceivers still targeted the fleets.They might as well have been on a network trunk.The news traffic was a vast waterfall, totally beyond Olvira's present ability to receive.Nevertheless, Svensndot kept an eye on it.Somewhere there might be some clue, some insight The majority of War Trackers and Threats seemed to have little interest in the Alliance or the death of Sjandra Kei, per se.Most were terrified of the Blight that was still spreading through the Top of the Beyond.None of the Highest had successfully resisted, and there were rumors that two more interfering Powers had been destroyed.There were some (secret mouths of the Blight?)who welcomed the new stability at the Top, even one based on permanent parasitization.In fact, the chase down here at the Bottom, the flight of the Out of Band and its pursuers, seemed the only place where the Blight was not completely triumphant.No wonder they were the subject of 10,000 messages an hour.The geometry of emergence was enormously favorable to Olvira.They had been on the outskirts of the action, but now they had hours headstart on the main fleets.Glimfrelle and Tirolle were busier than they had ever been in their lives, monitoring the fleets' emergence and establishing Olvira's identity with the other vessels of Commercial Security.Until Scrits and Limmende emerged from the Slowness, Kjet Svensndot was the ranking officer of the organization.Furthermore, he was personally known to most of the commanders.Kjet had never been the admiral type; his Group Captaincy had been a reward for piloting skills, in a Sjandra Kei at peace.He had always been content to defer to his employers.But now  The Group Captain used his ranking status.The Alliance vessels were not pursued.("Wait till we can all act together," ordered Svensndot. )Possible game plans bounced back and forth across the emerging fleet, including schemes that assumed HQ was destroyed.With certain commanders, Kjet hinted that this last might be the case, that Limmende's flag ship was in enemy hands, and that the Alliance was somehow just a side effect of that true enemy.Very soon, Kjet would be committed to the "treason" he planned.The Limmende flag ships and the core of the Blighter fleet came out of the Slowness almost simultaneously.Comm alarms went off across Olvira's deck as priority mail arrived and passed through the ship's crypto."Source: Limmende at HQ.Star Breaker Priority," said the ship's voice.Glimfrelle put the message on the main window, and Svensndot felt a chill certainty spread up his neck.All units are to pursue fleeing vessels.These are the enemy, the killers of our people.WARNING: Masquerades suspected.Destroy any vessels countermanding these orders.Order of Battle and validation codes follow   Order of Battle was simple, even by Commercial Security standards.Limmende wanted them to split up and be gone, staying only long enough to destroy "masqueraders".Kjet said to Glimfrelle, "How about the validation codes?"The Dirokime seemed his usual self again: "They're clean.We wouldn't be receiving the message at all unless the sender had today's one time pad We're beginning to receive queries from the others, Boss.Audio and video channels.They want to know what to do. "If he hadn't prepared the ground during the last few hours, Kjet's mutiny wouldn't have had a chance.If Commercial Security had been a real military organization, the Limmende order might have been obeyed without question.As it was, the other commanders pondered the questions that Svensndot had raised: At these ranges, video communication was easy and the fleet had one time ciphers large enough to support enormous amounts of it.Yet "Limmende" had chosen printed mail for her priority message.It made perfect military sense given that the encryption was correct, but it was also what Svensndot had predicted: The supposed HQ was not quite willing to show its face down here where perfect visual masquerades were not possible.Their commands would be by mail, or evocations that a sharp observer might suspect.Such a slender thread of reason Kjet and his friends were hanging from.Kjet eyed the knot of light that represented the Blighter fleet.It was suffering from no indecision.None of its vessels were straggling back toward safer heights.Whatever commanded there had discipline beyond most human militaries.It would sacrifice everything in its single minded pursuit of one small starship.What next, Group Captain?Just ahead of that cold smear of light, a single tiny gleam appeared."The Out of Band!"said Glimfrelle."Sixty five light years out now. ""I'm getting encrypted video from them, Boss.The same half crocked xor pad as before. "He put the signal on the main window without waiting for Kjet's direction.It was Ravna Bergsndot.The background was a jumble of motion and shouting, the strange human and a Skroderider arguing.Bergsndot was facing away from the pickup, and doing her share of shouting.Things looked even worse than Kjet's recollection of the first moments of his ship's emergence."It doesn't matter just now, I tell you!Let him be.We've got to contact  " she must have seen the signal Glimfrelle was sending back to her."They're here!By the Powers, Pham, please  " She waved her hand angrily and turned to the camera."Group Captain.We're  "  "I know.We've been out of the surge for hours.We're near the center of the pursuit now. "She caught her breath.Even with a hundred hours of planning, events were moving too fast for her.And for me too."That's something," she said after an instant."Everything we said before holds, Group Captain.We need your help.That's the Blight that's coming behind us.Please!"Svensndot noticed a telltale by the window.Sassy Glimfrelle was retransmitting this to all the fleet they could trust.Good.He had talked about the situation with the others these last hours, but it meant something more to see Ravna Bergsndot on the comm, to see someone from Sjandra Kei who still survived and needed their help.You can spend the rest of your life chasing revenge in the Middle Beyond, but all you kill will be the vultures.What's chasing Ravna Bergsndot may be the first cause.The Butterflies were long gone, still singing their courage across the Net.Less than one percent of Commercial Security had followed "Limmende's" order to chase after them.Those were not the problem: it was the ten percent that stayed behind and arrayed themselves with the Blight's forces that bothered Kjet Svensndot.Some of those ships might not be subverted, might simply be loyal to orders they believed.It would be very hard to fire on them.And there would be fighting, no doubt of that.Maneuvering for conflict while under ultradrive was difficult  if the other side attempted to evade.But Blight's fleet was unwavering in its pursuit of the Out of Band.Slowly, slowly the two fleets were coming to occupy the same volume.At present they were scattered across cubic light years, but with every jump, the Group Captain's Aniara fleet was more finely tuned to the stutter of their quarries' drives.Some ships were actually within a few hundred million kilometers of the enemy  or where the enemy had been or would be.Targeting tactics were set.First fire was only a few hundred seconds away."With the Aprahanti gone, we have numerical superiority.A normal enemy would back off now  "  "But of course, that is one thing the Blight fleet is not. "It was the red haired guy who was doing the talking now.It was a good thing Glimfrelle hadn't relayed his face to the rest of Svensndot's fleet.The guy acted edgy and alien most of the time.Just now, he seemed intent on bashing every idea Svensndot advanced."The Blight doesn't care what its losses are as long as it arrives with the upper hand. "Svensndot shrugged."Look, we'll do our best.First fire is seventy seconds off.If they don't have any secret advantage, we may win this one. "He looked sharply at the other."Or is that your point?Could the Blight  " Stories were still coming down about the Blight's progress across the Top of the Beyond.Without a doubt, it was a transhuman intelligence.An unarmed man might be outnumbered by a pack of dogs, yet still defeat them.So might the Blight?Pham Nuwen shook his head."No, no, no.The Blight's tactics down here will probably be inferior to yours.Its great advantage is at the Top, where it can control its slaves like fingers on a hand.Its creatures down here are like badly synched waldoes. "Nuwen frowned at something off camera."No, what we have to fear is its strategic cleverness. "His voice suddenly had a detached quality that was more unsettling than the earlier impatience.It wasn't the calm of someone facing up to a threat; it was more the calm of the demented."One hundred seconds to contact Group Captain, we have a chance, if you concentrate your forces on the right points. "Ravna floated down from the top of the picture, put one hand on the red head's shoulder.Godshatter, she said he was, their secret edge against the enemy.Godshatter, a Power's dying message; garbage or treasure, who really knew?Damn.If the other guys are badly synched waldoes, what does following Pham Nuwen make us?But he motioned Tirolle to mark the targets Nuwen was saying.Ninety seconds.Decision time.Kjet pointed at the red marks Tirolle had scattered through the enemy fleet."Anything special about those targets, 'Rolle?"The Dirokime whistled for a moment.Correlations popped up agonizingly slowly on the windows before him."The ships he's targeting aren't the biggest or the fastest.It's gonna take extra time to position on them. "Command vessels?"One other thing.Some of 'em show high real velocities, not natural residuals at all. "Ships with ram drives?Planet busters?"Hm. "Svensndot looked at the display just a second more.Thirty seconds and Jo Haugen's ship Lynsnar would be in contact, but not with one of Nuwen's targets."Get on the comm, Glimfrelle.Tell Lynsnar to back off, retarget. "Retarget everything.The lights that were Aniara fleet slid slowly around the core of the Blighter fleet, searching for their new targets.Twenty minutes passed, and not a few arguments with the other captains.Commercial Security was not built for military combat.What had made Kjet Svensndot's appeal successful was also the cause of constant questioning and countersuggestions.And then there were the threats that came from Owner Limmende's channel: kill the mutineers, death to all those disloyal to the company.The encryption was valid but the tone was totally alien to the mild, profit oriented Giske Limmende.Everyone could now see that disbelieving Limmende was one correct decision, anyway.Johanna Haugen was the first to achieve synch with the new targets.Glimfrelle opened the main window on the Lynsnar's data stream: The view was almost natural, a night sky of slowly shifting stars.The target was less than thirty million kilometers from Lynsnar, but about a millisecond out of synch.Haugen was arriving just before or just after the other had jumped."Drones away," Haugen's voice said.Now they had a true view of Lynsnar from a few meters away, from a camera aboard one of the first weapons drones launched.The ship was barely visible, a darkness obscuring the stars beyond  a great fish in the depths of an endless sea.A fish that was now giving spawn.The picture flickered, Lynsnar disappearing, reappearing, as the drone lost synch momentarily.A swarm of blue lights spilled from the ship's hold.Weapon drones.The swarm hung by Lynsnar, calibrating itself, orienting on the enemy.The light faded from around Lynsnar as the drones moving fractionally out of synch in space and time.Tirolle opened a window on a hundred million klick sphere centered at Lynsnar.The target vessel was a red dot that flickered around the sphere like a maddened insect.Lynsnar was stalking prey at eight thousand times the speed of light.Sometimes the target disappeared for a second, synch almost lost; other times Lynsnar and the target merged for an instant as the two craft spent a tenth of a second at less than a million kilometers remove.What could not be accurately displayed was the disposition of the drones.The spawn diffused on a myriad trajectories, their sensors extended for sign of the enemy ship."What about the target, is it swarming back?Do you need back up?"said Svensndot.Tirolle gave a Dirokime shrug.What they were watching was three light years away.No way he could know.But Jo Haugen replied, "I don't think my bogie is swarming.I've lost only five drones, no more'n you'd expect from fratricide.We'll see  " She paused, but Lynsnar's trace and signal remained strong.Kjet looked out the other windows.Five of Aniara were already engaged and three had completed swarm deploy.Nuwen looked on silently from Out of Band.The godshatter had had its way, and now Kjet and his people were committed.And now good news and bad came in very fast:  "Got him!"from Jo Haugen.The red dot in Lynsnar's swarm was no more.It had passed within a few thousand kilometers of one of the drones.In the milliseconds necessary to compute a new jump, the drone had discovered its presence and detonated.Even that would not have been fatal if the target had jumped before the blast front hit it; there had been several near misses in earlier seconds.This time the jump did not reach commit in time.A mini star was born, one whose light would be years in reaching the rest of the battle volume.Glimfrelle gave a rasping whistle, an untranslatable curse, "We just lost Ablsndot and Holder, Boss.Their target must have counter swarmed. ""Send in Gliwing and Trance. "Something in the back of his head curled up in horror.These were his friends who were dying.Kjet had seen death before, but never like this.In police action, no one took lethal chances except in a rescue.And yet he turned from the field summary to order more ships on a target that had acquired defending vessels.Tirolle was moving in others on his own.Ganging up on a few nonessential targets might lose in the long run, but in the short term the enemy was being hurt.For the first time since the fall of Sjandra Kei, Commercial Security was hurting someone back.Haugen: "Powers, that guy was moving!Secondary drone got EM spectrum on the kill.Target was going 15000 kps true speed. "A rocket bomb ramping up?Damn.They should be postponing those till after they controlled the battlefield.Tirolle: "More kills, far side of battle volume.The enemy is repositioning.Somehow they've guessed which we're after  "  Glimfrelle: Triumph whistle."Get 'em, get 'em  oops.Boss, I think Limmende has figured we're coordinating things  "  A new window had opened over Tirolle's post.It showed the five million kilometers around Olvira.Two other ships were there now: the window identified them as Limmende's flag and one of the vessels that had not responded to Svensndot's recruiting.There was an instant of stillness on Olvira's command deck.The voices of triumph and panic coming from the rest of the fleet seemed suddenly far away.Svensndot and his crew were looking at death close up."Tirolle!How long till swarm  "  "They're on us already  just missed a drone by ten milliseconds. ""Tirolle!Finish running current engagements.Glimfrelle, tell Lynsnar and Trance to chain command if we lose contact. "Those ships had already spent their drones, and Jo Haugen was known to all the other captains.Then the thought was gone, and he was busy coordinating Olvira's own battle swarm.The local tactics window showed the cloud dissipating, taking on colors coded by whether they were lagging or leading in time relative to Olvira.Their two attackers had matched pseudospeeds perfectly.Ten times per second all three ships jumped a tiny fraction of a light year.Like rocks skipping across the surface of a pond, they appeared in real space in perfectly measured hops  and the distance between them at every emergence was less that five million kilometers.The only thing that separated them now was millisecond differences in jump times, and the fact the light itself could not pass between them in the brief time they spent at each jump point.Three actinic flashes lit the deck, casting shadows back from Svensndot and the Dirokimes.It was second hand light, the display's emergency signal of nearby detonation.Run like hell was the message any rational person should take from that awful light.It would be easy enough to break synch   and lose tactical control of Aniara fleet.Tirolle and Glimfrelle bent their heads away from the local window, shying from the glare of nearby death.Their whistling voices scarcely broke cadence, and the commands from Olvira to the others continued.There were dozens of other battles going on out there.Just now Olvira was the only source of precision and control available to their side.Every second they remained on station meant protection and advantage to Aniara.Breaking off would mean minutes of chaos till Lynsnar or Trance could pick up control.Nearly two thirds of Pham Nuwen's targets were destroyed now.The price had been high, half of Svensdot's friends.The enemy had lost much to protect those targets, yet much of its fleet survived.An unseen hand smashed Olvira, driving Svensndot hard against his combat harness.The lights went out, even the glow from the windows.Then dim red light came from the floor.The Dirokimes were silhouetted by one small monitor.'Rolle whistled softly, "We're out of the game, Boss, least while it counts.I didn't know you could get misses that near. "Maybe it wasn't a miss.Kjet scrambled out of his harness and boosted across the room to float head down over the tiny monitor.Maybe we're already dead.Somewhere very close by a drone had detonated, the wave front reaching Olvira before she jumped.The concussion had been the outer part of the ship's hull exploding as it absorbed the soft xray component of the enemy ordnance.He stared at the red letters marching slowly across the damage display.Most likely, the electronics was permanently dead; chances were they had all received a fatal dose of gamma.The smell of burnt insulation floated across the room on the ventilator's breeze."Iiya!Look at that.Five nanoseconds more and we wouldn't have been clipped at all.We actually committed the jump after the front hit!"And somehow the electronics had survived long enough to complete the jump.The gamma flux through the command deck had been 300 rem, nothing that would slow them down over the next few hours, and easily managed by a ship's surgeon.As for the surgeon and all the rest of the Olvira's automation  Tirolle typed several long queries at the box; there was no voice recognition left.Several seconds passed before a response marched across the screen."Central automation suspended.Display management suspended.Drive computation suspended. "Tirolle dug an elbow at his brother."Hei, 'Frelle, it looks like 'Vira managed a clean disconnect.We can bring most of this back!"Dirokimes were known for being drifty optimists, but in this case Tirolle wasn't far from the truth.Their encounter with the drone bomb had been a one in billion thing, the tiniest fraction of an exposure.Over the next hour and a half, the Dirokimes ran reboots off the monitor's hardened processor, bringing up first one utility and then another.Some things were beyond recovery: parsing intelligence was gone from the comm automation, and the ultradrive spines on one side of the craft were partially melted.(Absurdly, the burning smell had been a vagrant diagnostic, something that should have been disabled along with all the rest of Olvira's automation. )They were far behind the Blighter fleet.and there was still a Blighter fleet.The knot of enemy lights was smaller than before, but on the same unwavering trajectory.The battle was long over.What was left of Commercial Security was scattered across four light years of abandoned battlefield; they had started the battle with numerical superiority.If they'd fought properly, they might have won.Instead they'd destroyed the vessels with significant real velocities  and knocked out only about half the others.Some of the largest enemy vessels survived.These outnumbered the corresponding Aniara survivors by more than four to one.Blight could have could have easily destroyed all that remained of Commercial Security.But that would have meant a detour from the pursuit, and that pursuit was the one constant in the enemy's behavior.Tirolle and Glimfrelle spent hours reestablishing communications and trying to discover who had died and who might be rescued.Five ships had lost all drive capability but still had surviving crew.Some ships had been hit at known locations, and Svensndot dispatched vessels with drone swarms to find the wrecks.Ship to ship warfare was a sanitary, intellectual exercise for most of the survivors, but the rubble and the destruction were as real as in any ground war, only spread over a trillion times more space.Finally the time for miracle rescues and sad discoveries was passed.The SjK commanders gathered on a common channel to decide a common future.It might better have been a wake  for Sjandra Kei and Aniara fleet.Part way through the meeting, a new window appeared, a view onto the bridge of the Out of Band.Ravna Bergsndot watched the proceedings silently.The erstwhile "godshatter" was nowhere in evidence."What more to do?"said Johanna Haugen."The damn Butterflies are long gone. ""Are we sure we have rescued everyone?"asked Jan Trenglets.Svensndot bit back an angry reply.The commander of Trance had become a recording loop on that issue.He had lost too many friends in the battle; all the rest of his life Jan Trenglets would live with nightmares of ships slowly dying in the deep night."We've accounted for everything, even to vapor," Haugen spoke as gently as the words allowed."The question is where to go now. "Ravna made a small throat clearing sound, "Gentlemen and Ladies, if  "  Trenglets looked up at her transceived image.All his hurt transformed into a blaze of anger."We're not your gentlemen, slut!You're not some princess we happily die for.You deserve our deadly fire now, nothing more. "The woman shrank from Trenglets rage."I  "  "You put us into this suicidal battle," shouted Trenglets."You made us attack secondary targets.And then you did nothing to help.The Blight is locked on you like a dumshark on a squid.If you had just altered your course the tiniest fraction, you could have thrown the Blighters off our path. ""I doubt that would have helped, sir," said Ravna."The Blight seems most interested in where we're bound. "The solar system just fifty five light years beyond the Out of Band.The fugitives would arrive there just over two days before their pursuers.Jo Haugen shrugged."You must realize what your friend's crazy battle plan has done.If we had attacked rationally, the enemy would be a fraction of its present size.If it chose to continue, we might have been able to protect you at this, this Tines' world. "She seemed to taste the strange name, wondering at its meaning."Now no way am I going to chase them there.What's left of the enemy could wipe us out. "She glanced at Svensndot's viewpoint.Kjet forced himself to look back.No matter who might blame Out of Band, it had been Group Captain Kjet Svensndot's word that had persuaded the fleet to fight as they did.Aniara's sacrifice had been illspent, and he wondered that Haugen and Trenglets and the others talked to him at all now."Suggest we continue the business meeting later.
