"If you win today, Ender, you will be the first student to do so.More than that I'm not at liberty to say. ""Well, I'm at liberty to hear it. ""You can be as petulant as you want, tomorrow.Today, though, I'd appreciate it if you would keep your mind on the examination.Let's not waste all that you've already done.Now, how will you deal with the planet?""I have to get someone behind it, or it's a blind spot. ""True. ""And the gravity is going to affect fuel levels    cheaper to go down than up. ""Yes. ""Does the Little Doctor work against a planet?"Mazer's face went rigid."Ender, the buggers never attacked a civilian population in either invasion.You decide whether it would be wise to adopt a strategy that would invite reprisals. ""Is the planet the only new thing?""Can you remember the last time I've given you a battle with only one new thing?Let me assure you, Ender, that I will not be kind to you today.I have a responsibility to the fleet not to let a second rate student graduate.I will do my best against you, Ender, and I have no desire to coddle you.Just keep in mind everything you know about yourself and everything you know about the buggers, and you have a fair chance of amounting to something. "Mazer left the room.Ender spoke into the microphone."Are you there?""All of us," said Bean."Kind of late for practice this morning, aren't you?"So they hadn't told the squadron leaders.Ender toyed with the idea of telling them how important this battle was to him, but decided it would not help them to have an extraneous concern on their minds."Sorry," he said."I overslept. "They laughed.They didn't believe him.He led them through maneuvers, warming up for the battle ahead.It took him longer than usual to clear his mind, to concentrate on command, but soon enough he was up to speed, responding quickly, thinking well.Or at least, he told himself, thinking that I'm thinking well.The simulator field cleared.Ender waited for the game to appear.What will happen if I pass the test today?Is there another school?Another year or two of grueling training, another year of isolation, another year of people pushing me this way and that way, another year without any control over my own life?He tried to remember how old he was.Eleven.How many years ago did he turn eleven?How many days?It must have happened here at the Command School, but he couldn't remember the day.Maybe he didn't even notice it at the time.Nobody noticed it, except perhaps Valentine.And as he waited for the game to appear, he wished he could simply lose it, lose the battle badly and completely so that they would remove him from training, like Bonzo, and let him go home.Bonzo had been assigned to Cartagena.He wanted to see travel orders that said Greensboro.Success meant it would go on.Failure meant he could go home.No, that isn't true, he told himself.They need me, and if I fail there might not be any home to return to.But he did not believe it.In his conscious mind he knew it was true, but in other places, deeper places, he doubted that they needed him.Mazer's urgency was just another trick.Just another way to make me do what they want me to do.Another way to keep him from resting.From doing nothing, for a long, long time.Then the enemy formation appeared, and Ender's weariness turned to despair.The enemy outnumbered him a thousand to one, the simulator glowed green with them.They were grouped in a dozen different formations shifting positions, changing shapes, moving in seemingly random patterns through the simulator field.He could not find a path through them    a space that seemed open would close suddenly, and another appear, and a formation that seemed penetrable would suddenly change and be forbidding.The planet was at the far edge of the field, and for all Ender knew there were just as many enemy ships beyond it, out of the simulator's range.As for his own fleet, it consisted of twenty starships, each with only four fighters.He knew the four fighter starships they were old fashioned, sluggish, and the range of their Little Doctors was half that of the newer ones.Eighty fighters, against at least five thousand, perhaps ten thousand enemy ships.He heard his squadron leaders breathing heavily; he could also hear, from the observers behind him, a quiet curse.It was nice to know that one of the adults noticed that it wasn't a fair test.Not that it made any difference.Fairness wasn't part of the game, that was plain.There was no attempt to give him even a remote chance at success.All that I've been through, and they never meant to let me pass at all.He saw in his mind Bonzo and his vicious little knot of friends, confronting him, threatening him; he had been able to shame Bonzo into fighting him alone.That would hardly work here.And he could not surprise the enemy with his ability as he had done with the older boys in the battleroom.Mazer knew Ender's abilities inside and out.The observers behind him began to cough, to move nervously.They were beginning to realize that Ender didn't know what to do.I don't care anymore, thought Ender.You can keep your game.If you won't even give me a chance, why should I play?Like his last game in Battle School, when they put two armies against him.And just as he remembered that game, apparently Bean remembered it, too, for his voice came over the headset, saying, "Remember, the enemy's gate is down      . "Molo, Soup, Vlad, Dumper, and Crazy Tom all laughed.They remembered, too.And Ender also laughed.It was funny.The adults taking all this so seriously, and the children playing along, playing along, believing it too until suddenly the adults went too far, tried too hard, and the children could see through their game.Forget it, Mazer.I don't care if I pass your test, I don't care if I follow your rules, if you can cheat, so can I.  I won't let you beat me unfairly    I'll beat you unfairly first.In that final battle in Battle School, he had won by ignoring the enemy, ignoring his own losses; he had moved against the enemy's gate.And the enemy's gate was down.If I break this rule, they'll never let me be a commander.It would be too dangerous.I'll never have to play a game again.And that is victory.He whispered quickly into the microphone.His commanders took their parts of the fleet and grouped themselves into a thick projectile, a cylinder aimed at the nearest of the enemy formations.The enemy, far from trying to repel him, welcomed him in, so he could be thoroughly entrapped before they destroyed him.Mazer is at least taking into account the fact that by now they would have learned to respect me, thought Ender.And that does buy me time.Ender dodged downward, north, east, and down again, not seeming to follow any plan, but always ending up a little closer to the enemy planet.Finally the enemy began to close in on him too tightly.Then, suddenly, Ender's formation burst.His fleet seemed to melt into chaos.The eighty fighters seemed to follow no plan at all, firing at enemy ships at random, working their way into hopeless individual paths among the bugger craft.After a few minutes of battle, however, Ender whispered to his squadron leaders once more, and suddenly a dozen of the remaining fighters formed again into a formation.But now they were on the far side of one of the enemy's most formidable groups; they had, with terrible losses, passed through and now they had covered more than half the distance to the enemy's planet.The enemy sees now, thought Ender.Surely Mazer sees what I'm doing.Or perhaps Mazer cannot believe that I would do it.Well so much the better for me.Ender's tiny fleet darted this way and that, sending two or three fighters out as if to attack, then bringing them back.The enemy closed in, drawing in ships and formations that had been widely scattered, bringing them in for the kill.The enemy was most concentrated beyond Ender, so he could not escape back into open space, closing him in.Excellent, thought Ender.Closer.Come closer.Then he whispered a command and the ships dropped like rocks toward the planet's surface.They were starships and fighters, completely unequipped to handle the heat of passage through an atmosphere.But Ender never intended them to reach the atmosphere.Almost from the moment they began to drop, they were focusing their Little Doctors on one thing only.The planet itself.One, two, four, seven of his fighters were blown away.It was all a gamble now, whether any of his ships would survive long enough to get in range.It would not take long, once they could focus on the planet's surface.Just a moment with Dr, Device, that's all I want.It occurred to Ender that perhaps the computer wasn't even equipped to show what would happen to a planet if the Little Doctor attacked it.What will I do then, shout Bang, you're dead?Ender took his hands off the controls and leaned in to watch what happened.The perspective was close to the enemy planet now, as the ship hurtled into its well of gravity.Surely it's in range now, thought Ender.It must be in range and the computer can't handle it.Then the surface of the planet, which filled half the simulator field now, began to bubble; there was a gout of explosion, hurling debris out toward Ender's fighters.Ender tried to imagine what was happening inside the planet.The field growing and growing, the molecules bursting apart but finding nowhere for the separate atoms to go.Within three seconds the entire planet burst apart, becoming a sphere of bright dust, hurtling outward.Ender's fighters were among the first to go: their perspective suddenly vanished, and now the simulator could only display the perspective of the starships waiting beyond the edges of the battle.It was as close as Ender wanted to be.The sphere of the exploding planet grew outward faster than the enemy ships could avoid it.And it carried with it the Little Doctor, not so little anymore, the field taking apart every ship in its path, erupting each one into a dot of light before it went on.Only at the very periphery of the simulator did the M. D.  field weaken.Two or three enemy ships were drifting away.Ender's own starships did not explode.But where the vast enemy fleet had been, and the planet they protected, there was nothing meaningful.A lump of dirt was growing as gravity drew much of the debris downward again.It was glowing hot and spinning visibly; it was also much smaller than the world had been before.Much of its mass was now a cloud still flowing outward.Ender took off his headphones, filled with the cheers of his squadron leaders, and only then realized that there was just as much noise in the room with him.Men in uniform were hugging each other, laughing, shouting; others were weeping; some knelt or lay prostrate, and Ender knew they were caught up in prayer.Ender didn't understand.It seemed all wrong.They were supposed to be angry.Colonel Graff detached himself from the others and came to Ender.Tears streamed down his face, but he was smiling.He bent over, reached out his arms, and to Ender's surprise he embraced him, held him tightly, and whispered, "Thank you, thank you Ender.Thank God for you, Ender. "The others soon came, too, shaking his hand, congratulating him.He tried to make sense of this.Had he passed the test after all?It was his victory, not theirs, and a hollow one at that, a cheat; why did they act as if he had won with honor?The crowd parted and Mazer Rackham walked through.He came straight to Ender and held out his hand."You made the hard choice, boy.All or nothing.End them or end us.But heaven knows there was no other way you could have done it.Congratulations.You beat them, and it's all over. "All over.Beat them.Ender didn't understand."I beat you      . "Mazer laughed, a loud laugh that filled the room."Ender, you never played me      .You never played a game       since I became your enemy. "Ender didn't get the joke.He had played a great many games, at a terrible cost to himself.He began to get angry.Mazer reached out and touched his shoulder.Ender shrugged him off.Mazer then grew serious and said, "Ender, for the past few months you have been the battle commander of our fleets.This was the Third Invasion.There were no games, the battles were real, and the only enemy you fought was the buggers.You won every battle, and today you finally fought them at their home world, where the queen was, all the queens from all their colonies, they all were there and you destroyed them completely.They'll never attack us again.You did it.You. "Real.Not a game.Ender's mind was too tired to cope with it all.They weren't just points of light in the air, they were real ships that he had fought with and real ships he had destroyed.And a real world that he had blasted into oblivion.He walked through the crowd, dodging their congratulations, ignoring their hands, their words, their rejoicing.When he got to his own room he stripped off his clothes, climbed into bed, and slept.Ender awoke when they shook him.It took a moment to recognize them.Graff and Rackham.He turned his back on them.Let me sleep."Ender, we need to talk to you," said Graff.Ender rolled back to face them."They've been playing out the videos on Earth all day, all night since the battle yesterday. ""Yesterday?"He had slept through until the next day."You're a hero.Ender.They've seen what you did.You and the others.I don't think there's a government on Earth that hasn't voted you their highest medal. ""I killed them all, didn't I?"Ender asked."All who?"asked Graff."The buggers?That was the idea. "Mazer leaned in close."That's what the war was for. ""All their queens.So I killed all their children, all of everything. ""They decided that when they attacked us.It wasn't your fault.It's what had to happen. "Ender grabbed Mazer's uniform and hung onto it, pulling him down so they were face to face."I didn't want to kill them all.I didn't want to kill anybody!I'm not a killer!You didn't want me, you bastards, you wanted Peter, but you made me do it, you tricked me into it!"He was crying.He was out of control."Of course we tricked you into it.That's the whole point," said Graff."It had to be a trick or you couldn't have done it.It's the bind we were in.We had to have a commander with so much empathy that he would think like the buggers, understand them and anticipate them.So much compassion that he could win the love of his underlings and work with them like a perfect machine, as perfect as the buggers.But somebody with that much compassion could never be the killer we needed.Could never go into battle willing to win at all costs.If you knew, you couldn't do it.If you were the kind of person who would do it even if you knew, you could never have understood the buggers well enough. ""And it had to be a child, Ender," said Mazer."You were faster than me.Better than me.I was too old and cautious.Any decent person who knows what warfare is can never go into battle with a whole heart.But you didn't know.We made sure you didn't know.You were reckless and brilliant and young.It's what you were born for. ""We had pilots with our ships, didn't we. ""Yes. ""I was ordering pilots to go in and die and I didn't even know it. ""They       knew it, Ender, and they went anyway.They knew what it was for. ""You never asked me!You never told me the truth about anything!""You had to be a weapon, Ender.Like a gun, like the Little Doctor, functioning perfectly but not knowing what you were aimed at.We aimed you.We're responsible.If there was something wrong, we did it. ""Tell me later," Ender said.His eyes closed.Mazer Rackham shook him."Don't go to sleep, Ender," he said."It's very important. ""You're finished with me," Ender said."Now leave me alone. ""That's why we're here. "Mazer said, "We're trying to tell you.They're not through with you, not at all, it's crazy down there.They're going to start a war, Americans claiming the Warsaw Pact is about to attack, and the Pact saying the same thing about the Hegemon.The bugger war isn't twenty four hours dead and the world down there is back to fighting again, as bad as ever.And all of them are worried about you.And all of them want you.The greatest military leader in history, they want you to lead their armies.The Americans.The Hegemon.Everybody but the Warsaw Pact, and they want you dead. ""Fine with me," said Ender."We have to take you away from here.There are Russian marines all over Eros, and the Polemarch is Russian.It could turn to bloodshed at any time. "Ender turned his back on them again.This time they let him.He did not sleep, though.He listened to them."I was afraid of this, Rackham.You pushed him too hard.Some of those lesser outposts could have waited until after.You could have given him some days to rest. ""Are you doing it, too, Graff?Trying to decide how I could have done it better?You don't know what would have happened if I hadn't pushed.Nobody knows.I did it the way I did it, and it worked.Above all, it worked.Memorize that defense, Graff.You may have to use it, too. ""Sorry. ""I can see what it's done to him.Colonel Liki says there's a good chance he'll be permanently damaged, but I don't believe it.He's too strong.Winning meant a lot to him, and he won. ""Don't tell me about strong.The kid's eleven.Give him some rest, Rackham.Things haven't exploded yet.We can post a guard outside his door. ""Or post a guard outside another door and pretend that it's his. ""Whatever. "They went away.Ender slept again.Time passed without touching Ender, except with glancing blows.Once he awoke for a few minutes with something pressing his hand, pushing downward on it, with a dull, insistent pain.He reached over and touched it; it was a needle passing into a vein.He tried to pull it out, but it was taped on and he was too weak.Another time he awoke in darkness to hear people near him murmuring and cursing.His ears were ringing with the loud noise that had awakened him; he did not remember the noise."Get the lights on," someone said.And another time he thought he heard someone crying softly near him.It might have been a single day; it might have been a week; from his dreams, it could have been months.He seemed to pass through lifetimes in his dreams.Through the Giant's Drink again, past the wolf children, reliving the terrible deaths, the constant murders; he heard a voice whispering in the forest, You had to kill the children to get to the End of the World.And he tried to answer.I never wanted to kill anybody.Nobody ever asked me if I wanted to kill anybody.But the forest laughed at him.And when he leapt from the cliff at the End of the World, sometimes it was not clouds that caught him, but a fighter that carried him to a vantage point near the surface of the buggers' world, so he could watch, over and over, the eruption of death when Dr.Device set off a reaction on the planet's face; then closer and closer, until he could watch individual buggers explode, turn to light, then collapse into a pile of dirt before his eyes.And the queen, surrounded by infants; only the queen was Mother, and the infants were Valentine and all the children he had known in Battle School.One of them had Bonzo's face, and he lay there bleeding through the eyes and nose, saying, You have no honor.And always the dream ended with a mirror or a pool of water or the metal surface of ship, something that would reflect his face back to him.At first it was always Peter's face, with blood and a snake's tail coming from the mouth.After a while, though, it began to be his own face, old and sad, with eyes that grieved for a billion, billion murders    but they were his own eyes, and he was content to wear them.That was the world Ender lived in for many lifetimes during the five days of the League War.When he awoke again he was lying in darkness.In the distance he could hear the thump, thump of explosions.He listened for a while.Then he heard a soft footstep.He turned over and flung out a hand, to grasp whoever was sneaking up on him.Sure enough, he caught someone's clothing and pulled him down toward his knees, ready to kill him if need be."Ender, it's me, it's me!"He knew the voice.It came out of his memory as if it were a million years ago."Alai. ""Salaam, pinprick.What were you trying to do, kill me?""Yes.I thought you were trying to kill me      . ""I was trying not to wake you up.Well, at least you have some survival instinct left.The way Mazer talks about it, you were becoming a vegetable. ""I was trying to.What's the thumping. ""There's a war going on here.Our section is blacked out to keep us safe. "Ender swung his legs out to sit up.He couldn't do it, though.His head hurt too bad.He winced in pain. ""Don't sit up, Ender.It's all right.It looks like we might win it.Not all the Warsaw Pact people went with the Polemarch.A lot of them came over when the Strategos told them you were loyal to the I. F. ""I was asleep. ""So he lied.You weren't plotting treason in your dreams, were you?Some of the Russians who came in told us that when the Polemarch ordered them to find you and kill you, they almost killed him.Whatever they may feel about other people, Ender, they love you.The whole world watched our battles.Videos, day and night.I've seen some.Complete with your voice giving the orders.It's all there, nothing censored.Good stuff.You've got a career in the vids. ""I don't think so," said Ender."I was joking.Hey, can you believe it?We won the war.We were so eager to grow up so we could fight in it, and it was us all the time.I mean, we're kids.Ender.And it was us. "Alai laughed."It was you, anyway.You were good, bosh.I didn't know how you'd get us out of that last one.But you did.You were good. "Ender noticed the way he spoke in the past good."What am I now, Alai?""Still good. ""At what?""At    anything.There's a million soldiers who'd follow you to the end of the universe. ""I don't want to go to the end of the universe. ""So where do you want to go?They'll follow you. "I want to go home, thought Ender, but I don't know where it is.The thumping went silent."Listen to that," said Alai.They listened.The door opened.Someone stood there.Someone small."It's over," he said.It was Bean.As if to prove it, the lights went on."Ho, Bean," Ender said."Ho, Ender. "Petra followed him in, with Dink holding her hand.They came to Ender's bed."Hey, the hero's awake," said Dink."Who won?"asked Ender."We did, Ender," said Bean."You were there. ""He's not that       crazy, Bean.He meant who won just now. "Petra took Ender's hand."There was a truce on Earth.They've been negotiating for days.They finally agreed to accept the Locke Proposal. ""He doesn't know about the Locke Proposal  "  "It's very complicated, but what it means here is that the I. F.  will stay in existence, but without the Warsaw Pact in it.So the Warsaw Pact marines are going home.I think Russia agreed to it because they're having a revolt of the Slavic helots.Everybody's got troubles.About five hundred died here, but it was worse on Earth. ""The Hegemon resigned," said Dink."It's crazy down there.Who cares. ""You OK?"Petra asked him, touching his head."You scared us.They said you were crazy, and we said they       were crazy. ""I'm crazy," said Ender."But I think I'm OK. ""When did you decide that?"asked Alai."When I thought you were about to kill me, and I decided to kill you first.I guess I'm just a killer to the core.But I'd rather be alive than dead. "They laughed and agreed with him.Then Ender began to cry and embraced Bean and Petra, who were closest."I missed you," he said."I wanted to see you so bad. ""You saw us pretty bad," Petra answered.She kissed his cheek."I saw you magnificent," said Ender."The ones I needed most, I used up soonest.Bad planning on my part. ""Everybody's OK now," said Dink."Nothing was wrong with any of us that five days of cowering in blacked out rooms in the middle of a war couldn't cure. ""I don't have to be your commander anymore, do I?"asked Ender."I don't want to command anybody again. ""You don't have to command anybody," said Dink, "but you're always our commander. "Then they were silent for a while."So what do we do now?"asked Alai."The bugger war's over, and so's the war down there on Earth, and even the war here.What do we do now?""We're kids," said Petra."They'll probably make us go to school.It's a law.You have to go to school till you're seventeen. "They all laughed at that.Laughed until tears streamed down their faces.15   Speaker for the Dead    The lake was still; there was no breeze.The two men sat together in chairs on the floating dock.A small wooden raft was tied up at the dock; Graff hooked his foot in the rope and pulled the raft in, then let it drift out, then pulled it in again."You've lost weight. ""One kind of stress puts it on, another takes it off.I'm a creature of chemicals. ""It must have been hard. "Graff shrugged."Not really.I knew I'd be acquitted. ""Some of us weren't so sure.People were crazy for a while there.Mistreatment of children, negligent homicide    those videos of Bonzo's and Stilson's deaths were pretty gruesome.To watch one child do that to another. ""As much as anything, I think the videos saved me.The prosecution edited them, but we showed the whole thing.It was plain that Ender was not the provocateur.After that, it was just a second guessing game.I said I did what I believed was necessary for the preservation of the human race, and it worked; we got the judges to agree that the prosecution had to prove beyond doubt that Ender would have won the war without the training we gave him.After that, it was simple.The exigencies of war. ""Anyway, Graff, it was a great relief to us.I know we quarreled, and I know the prosecution used tapes of our conversations against you.But by then I knew that you were right, and I offered to testify for you. ""I know, Anderson.My lawyers told me. ""So what will you do now?""I don't know.Still relaxing.I have a few years of leave accrued.Enough to take me to retirement, and I have plenty of salary that I never used, sitting around in banks.I could live on the interest.Maybe I'll do nothing. ""It sounds nice.But I couldn't stand it.I've been offered the presidency of three different universities, on the theory that I'm an educator.They don't believe me when I say that all I ever cared about at the Battle School was the game.I think I'll go with the other offer. ""Commissioner?""Now that the wars are over, it's time to play games again.It'll be almost like vacation, anyway.Only twenty eight teams in the league.Though after years of watching those children flying, football is like watching slugs bash into each other. "They laughed.Graff sighed and pushed the raft with his foot."That raft.Surely you can't float on it. "Graff shook his head."Ender built it. ""That's right.This is where you took him. ""It's even been deeded over to him.I saw to it that he was amply rewarded.He'll have all the money he ever needs. ""If they ever let him come back to use it. ""They never will. ""With Demosthenes agitating for him to come home?""Demosthenes isn't on the nets anymore. "Anderson raised an eyebrow."What does that mean?""Demosthenes has retired.Permanently. ""You know something, you old farteater.You know who Demosthenes is. ""Was. ""Well, tell me!""No. ""You're no fun anymore, Graff. ""I never was. ""At least you can tell me why.There were a lot of us who thought Demosthenes would be Hegemon someday. ""There was never a chance of that.No, even Demosthenes' mob of political cretins couldn't persuade the Hegemon to bring Ender back to Earth.Ender is far too dangerous. ""He's only eleven.Twelve, now. ""All the more dangerous because he could so easily be controlled.In all the world, the name of Ender is one to conjure with.The child god, the miracle worker, with life and death in his hands.Every petty tyrant to be would like to have the boy, to set him in front of an army and watch the world either flock to join or cower in fear.If Ender came to Earth, he'd want to come here, to rest, to salvage what he can of his childhood.But they'd never let him rest. ""I see.Someone explained that to Demosthenes?"Graff smiled."Demosthenes explained it to someone else.Someone who could have used Ender as no one else could have, to rule the world and make the world like it. ""Who?""Locke. ""Locke is the one who argued for Ender to stay on Eros. ""All is not always as it seems. ""It's too deep for me, Graff.Give me the game.Nice, neat rules.Referees.Beginnings and endings.Winners and losers and then everybody goes home to their wives. ""Get me tickets to some games now and then, all right?""You won't really stay here and retire, will you?""No. ""You're going into the Hegemony, aren't you?""I'm the new Minister of Colonization. ""So they're doing it. ""As soon as we get the reports back on the bugger colony worlds.I mean, there they are, already fertile, with housing and industry in place, and all the buggers dead.Very convenient.We'll repeal the population limitation laws  "  "Which everybody hates  "  "And all those thirds and fourths and fifths get on starships and head out for worlds known and unknown. ""Will people really go?""People always go.Always.They always believe they can make a better life than in the old world. ""What the hell, maybe they can. "At first Ender believed that they would bring him back to Earth as soon as things quieted down.But things were quiet now, had been quiet for a year, and it was plain to him now that they would not bring him back at all, that he was much more useful as a name and a story than he would ever be as an inconvenient flesh and blood person.And there was the matter of the court martial on the crimes of Colonel Graff.Admiral Chamrajnagar tried to keep Ender from watching it, but failed    Ender had been awarded the rank of admiral, too, and this was one of the few times he asserted the privileges the rank implied.So he watched the videos of the fights with Stilson and Bonzo, watched as the photographs of the corpses were displayed, listened as the psychologists and lawyers argued whether murder had been committed or the killing was in self defense.Ender had his own opinion, but no one asked him, Throughout the trial, it was really Ender himself under attack.The prosecution was too clever to charge him directly, but there were attempts to make him look sick, perverted, criminally insane."Never mind," said Mazer Rackham."The politicians are afraid of you, but they can't destroy your reputation yet.That won't be done until the historians get at you in thirty years. "Ender didn't care about his reputation.He watched the videos impassively, but in fact he was amused.In battle I killed ten billion buggers, who were as alive and wise as any man, who had not even launched a third attack against us, and no one thinks to call it a crime.All his crimes weighed heavy on him, the deaths of Stilson and Bonzo no heavier and no lighter than the rest.And so, with that burden, he waited through the empty months until the world that he had saved decided he could come home.One by one, his friends reluctantly left him, called home to their families, to be received with heroes' welcomes in their towns.Ender watched the videos of their homecomings, and was touched when they' spent much of their time praising Ender Wiggin, who taught them everything, they said, who taught them and led them into victory.But if they called for him to be brought home, the words were censored from the videos and no one heard the plea.For a time, the only work in Eros was cleaning up after the bloody League War and receiving the reports of the starships, once warships, that were now exploring the bugger colony worlds.But now Eros was busier than ever, more crowded than it had ever been during the war, as colonists were brought here to prepare for their voyages to the empty bugger worlds.Ender took part in the work, as much as they would let him, but it did not occur to them that this twelve year old boy might be as gifted at peace as he was at war.But he was patient with their tendency to ignore him, and learned to make his proposals and suggest his plans through the few adults who listened to him, and let them present them as their own.He was concerned, not about getting credit, but about getting the job done.The one thing he could not bear was the worship of the colonists.He learned to avoid the tunnels where they lived, because they would always recognize him    the world had memorized his face    and the they would scream and shout and embrace him and congratulate him and show him the children they had named after him and tell him how he was so young it broke their hearts and they       didn't blame him for any of his murders because it wasn't his fault he was just a child          He hid from them as best he could.There was one colonist, though, he couldn't hide from.He wasn't inside Eros that day.He had gone up with the shuttle to the new ISL, where he had been learning to do surface work on the starships; it was unbecoming to an officer to do mechanical labor, Chamrajnagar told him, but Ender answered that since the trade he had mastered wasn't much called for now, it was about time he learned another skill.They spoke to him through his helmet radio and told him that someone was waiting to see him as soon as he could come in.Ender couldn't think of anyone he wanted to see, and so he didn't hurry.He finished installing the shield for the ship's ansible and then hooked his way across the face of the ship and pulled himself up into the airlock.She was waiting for him outside the changing room.For a moment he was annoyed that they would let a colonist come to bother him here, where he came to be alone; then he looked again, and realized that if the young woman were a little girl, he would know her."Valentine," he said."Hi, Ender. ""What are you doing here?""Demosthenes retired.Now I'm going with the first colony. ""It's fifty years to get there  "  "Only two years if you're aboard the ship. ""But if you ever came back, everybody you knew on Earth would be dead  "  "That was what I had in mind.I was hoping, though, that someone I knew on Eros might come with me."I don't want to go to a world we stole from the buggers.I just want to go home. ""Ender, you're never going back to Earth.I saw to that before I left. "He looked at her in silence."I tell you that now, so that if you want to hate me, you can hate me from the beginning. "They went to Ender's tiny compartment in the ISL and she explained.Peter wanted Ender back on Earth, under the protection of the Hegemon's Council."The way things are right now, Ender, that would put you effectively under Peter's control, since half the council now does just what Peter wants.The ones that aren't Locke's lapdogs are under his thumb in other ways. ""Do they know who he really is?""Yes.He isn't publicly known,.but people in high places know him.It doesn't matter any more.He has too much power for them to worry about his age.He's done incredible things, Ender. ""I noticed the treaty a year ago was named for Locke. ""That was his breakthrough.He proposed it through his friends from the public policy nets, and then Demosthenes got behind it, too.It was the moment he had been waiting for, to use Demosthenes' influence with the mob and Locke's influence with the intelligentsia to accomplish something noteworthy.It forestalled a really vicious war that could have lasted for decades. ""He decided to be a statesman?""I think so.But in his cynical moments, of which there are many, he pointed out to me that if he had allowed the League to fall apart completely, he'd have to conquer the world piece by piece.As long as the Hegemony exists, he can do it in one lump. "Ender nodded."That's the Peter that I knew. ""Funny, isn't it?That Peter would save millions of lives. ""While I killed billions. ""I wasn't going to say that. ""So he wanted to use me?""He had plans for you, Ender.He would publicly reveal himself when you arrived, going to meet you in front of all the videos.Ender Wiggin's older brother, who also happened to be the great Locke, the architect of peace.Standing next to you, he would look quite mature.And the physical resemblance between you is stronger than ever.It would be quite simple for him, then, to take over. ""Why did you stop him?""Ender, you wouldn't be happy spending the rest of your life as Peter's pawn. ""Why not?I've spent my life as someone's pawn. ""Me too.I showed Peter all the evidence that I had assembled, enough to prove in the eyes of the public that he was a psychotic killer.It included full color pictures of tortured squirrels and some of the monitor videos of the way he treated you.It took some work to get it all together, but by the time he saw it, he was willing to give me what I wanted.What I wanted was your freedom and mine. ""It's not my idea of freedom to go live in the house of the people that I killed. ""Ender, what's done is done.Their worlds are empty now, and ours is full.And we can take with us what their worlds have never known    cities full of people who live private, individual lives, who love and hate each other for their own reasons.In all the bugger worlds, there was never more than a single story to be told; when we're there, the world will be full of stories, and we'll improvise their endings day by day.Ender, Earth belongs to Peter.And if you don't go with me now, he'll have you there, and use you up until you wish you'd never been born.Now is the only chance you'll get to get away. "Ender said nothing."I know what you're thinking, Ender.You're thinking that I'm trying to control you just as much as Peter or Graff or any of the others. ""It crossed my mind. ""Welcome to the human race.Nobody controls his own life, Ender.The best you can do is choose to be controlled by good people, by people who love you.I didn't come here because I wanted to be a colonist.I came because I've spent my whole life in the company of the brother that I hated.Now I want a chance to know the brother that I loved, before it's too late, before we're not children anymore. ""It's already too late for that. ""You're wrong, Ender.You think you're grown up and tired and jaded with everything, but in your heart you're just as much a kid as I am.We can keep it secret from everybody else.While you're governing the colony and I'm writing political philosophy, they'll never guess that in the darkness of night we sneak into each other's room and play checkers and have pillowfights. "Ender laughed, but he had noticed some things she dropped too casually for them to be accidental."Governing?""I'm Demosthenes, Ender, I went out with a bang.A public announcement that I believed so much in the colonization movement that I was going in the first ship myself.At the same time, the Minister of Colonization, a former colonel named Graff, announced that the pilot of the colony ship would be the great Mazer Rackham, and the governor of the colony would be Ender Wiggin. ""They might have asked me. ""I wanted to ask you myself. ""But it's already announced. ""No.They'll be announcing it tomorrow, if you accept.Mazer accepted a few hours ago, back in Eros. ""You're telling everyone that you're Demosthenes?A fourteen year old girl?""We're only telling them that Demosthenes is going with the colony.Let them spend the next fifty years poring over the passenger list, trying to figure out which one of them is the great demagogue of the Age of Locke. "Ender laughed and shook his head."You're actually having fun, Val. ""I can't think why I shouldn't. ""All right," said Ender."I'll go.Maybe even as governor, as long as you and Mazer are there to help me.My abilities are a little underused at present. "She squealed and hugged him, for all the world like a typical teenage girl who just got the present that she wanted from her little brother."Val," he said, "I just want one thing clear.I'm not going for you.I'm not going in order to be governor, or because I'm bored here.I'm going because I know the buggers better than any other living soul, and maybe if I go there I can understand them better.I stole their future from them; I can only begin to repay by seeing what I can learn from their past. "The voyage was long.By the end of it, Val had finished the first volume of her history of the bugger wars and transmitted it by ansible, under Demosthenes' name, back to Earth, and Ender had won something better than the adulation of the passengers.They knew him now, and he had won their love and their respect.He worked hard on the new world, governing by persuasion rather than fiat, and working as hard as anyone at the tasks involved in setting up a self sustaining economy.But his most important work, as everyone agreed, was exploring what the buggers had left behind, trying to find among structures, machinery, and fields long untended some things that human beings could use, could learn from.There were no books to read    the buggers never needed them.With all things present in their memories, all things spoken as they were thought, when the buggers died their knowledge died with them.And yet.From the sturdiness of the roofs that covered their animal sheds and their food supplies, Ender learned that winter would be hard, with heavy snows.From fences with sharpened stakes that pointed outward he learned that there were marauding animals that were a danger to the crops or the herds.From the mill he learned that the long, foul tasting fruits that grew in the overgrown orchards were dried and ground into meal.And from the slings that once were used to carry infants along with adults into the fields, he learned that even though the buggers were not much for individuality, they did love their children.Life settled down, and years passed.The colony lived in wooden houses and used the tunnels of the bugger city for storage and manufactories.They were governed by a council now, and administrators were elected, so that Ender, though they still called him governor, was in fact only a judge.There were crimes and quarrels alongside kindness and cooperation; there were people who loved each other and people who did not; it was a human world.They did not wait so eagerly for each new transmission from the ansible; the names that were famous on Earth meant little to them now.The only name they knew was that of Peter Wiggin, the Hegemon of Earth; the only news that came was news of peace, of prosperity, of great ships leaving the littoral of Earth's solar system, passing the comet shield and filling up the bugger worlds.Soon there would be other colonies on this world, Ender's World; soon there would be neighbors; already they were halfway here; but no one cared.They would help the newcomers when they came, teach them what they had learned, but what mattered in life now was who would marry whom, and who was sick, and when was planting time, and why should I pay him when the calf died three weeks after I got it."They've become people of the land," said Valentine."No one cares now that Demosthenes is sending the seventh volume of his history today.No one here will read it. "Ender pressed a button and his desk showed him the next page."Very insightful, Valentine.How many more volumes until you're through?""Just one.The story of Ender Wiggin. ""What will you do, wait to write it until I'm dead?""No.Just write it, and when I've brought it up to the present day, I'll stop. ""I have a better idea.Take it up to the day we won the final battle.Stop it there.Nothing that I've done since then is worth writing down. ""Maybe," said Valentine."And maybe not. "The ansible had brought them word that the new colony ship was only a year away.They asked Ender to find a place for them to settle in, near enough to Ender's colony that the two colonies could trade, but far enough apart that they could be governed separately.Ender used the helicopter and began to explore.He took one of the children along, an eleven year old boy named Abra; he had been only three when the colony was founded, and he remembered no other world than this.He and Ender flew as far as the copter would carry them, then camped for the night and got a feel for the land on foot the next morning.It was on the third morning that Ender suddenly began to feel an uneasy sense that he had been in this place before.He looked around; it was new land, he had never seen it.He called out to Abra."Ho, Ender!"Abra called.He was on top of a steep low hill."Come up!"Ender scrambled up, the turves coming away from his feet in the soft ground.Abra was pointing downward."Can you believe this?"he asked.The hill was hollow.A deep depression in the middle, partially filled with water, was ringed by concave slopes that cantilevered dangerously over the water.In one direction the hill gave way to two long ridges that made a V shaped valley: in the other direction the rose to a piece of white rock, grinning like a skull with a tree growing out of its mouth."It's like a giant died here," said Abra, "and the Earth grew up to cover his carcass,"  Now Ender knew why it had looked familiar.The Giant's corpse.He had played here too many times as a child not to know this place.But it was not possible.The computer in the Battle School could not possibly have seen this place.He looked through his binoculars in a direction he knew well, fearing and hoping that he would see what belonged in that place.Swings and slides.Monkey bars.Now overgrown, but the shapes still unmistakable."Somebody had to have built this," Abra said, "Look, this skull place, it's not rock, look at it.This is concrete. ""I know," said Ender."They built it for me. ""What?""I know this place, Abra.The buggers built it for me. ""The buggers were all dead fifty years before we got here. ""You're right, it's impossible, but I know what I know.Abra, I shouldn't take you with me.It might be dangerous.If they knew me well enough to build this place, they might be planning to  "  "To get even with you. ""For killing them. ""So don't go, Ender.Don't do what they want you to do. ""lf they want to get revenge, Abra, I don't mind.But perhaps they don't.Perhaps this is the closest they could come to talking.To writing me a note. ""They didn't know how to read and write. ""Maybe they were learning when they died. ""Well, I'm sure as hell not sticking around here if you're taking off somewhere.I'm going with you. ""No.You're too young to take the risk of  "  "Come on!You're Ender Wiggin.Don't tell me what eleven year old kids can do!"Together they flew in the copter, over the playground, over the woods, over the well in the forest clearing.Then out to where there was, indeed, a cliff, with a cave in the cliff wall and a ledge right where the End of the World should be.And there in the distance, just where it should be in the fantasy game, was the castle tower.He left Abra with the copter."Don't come after me, and go home in an hour if I don't come back. ""Eat it, Ender, I'm coming with you. ""Eat it yourself, Abra, or I'll stuff you with mud. "Abra could tell, despite Ender's joking tone, that he meant it, and so he stayed.The walls of the tower were notched and ledged for easy climbing.They meant him to get in.The room was as it had always been.Ender remembered well enough to look for a snake on the floor, but there was only a rug with a carved snake's head at one corner.Imitation, not duplication; for a people who made no art, they had done well.They must have dragged these images from Ender's own mind, finding him and learning his darkest dreams across the lightyears.But why?To bring him to this room, of course.To leave a message for him.But where was the message, and how would he understand it?The mirror was waiting for him on the wall.It was a dull sheet of metal, in which the rough shape of a human face had been scratched.They tried to draw the image I should see in the picture.And looking at the mirror he could remember breaking it, pulling it from the wall, and snakes leaping out of the hidden place, attacking him, biting him wherever their poisonous fangs could find purchase.How well do they know me, wondered Ender.Well enough to know how often I have thought of death, to know that I am not afraid of it?Well enough to know that even if I feared death, it would not stop me from taking that mirror from the wall.He walked to the mirror, lifted, pulled away.Nothing jumped from the space behind it.Instead, in a hollowed out place, there was a white ball of silk with a few frayed strands sticking out here and there.An egg?No.The pupa of a queen bugger, already fertilized by the larval males, ready, out of her own body, to hatch a hundred thousand buggers, including a few queens and males.Ender could see the slug like males clinging to the walls of a dark tunnel, and the large adults carrying the infant queen to the mating room; each male in turn penetrated the larval queen, shuddered in ecstasy, and died, dropping to the tunnel floor and shriveling.Then the new queen was laid before the old, a magnificent creature clad in soft and shimmering wings, which had long since lost the power of flight but still contained the power of majesty.The old queen kissed her to sleep with the gentle poison in her lips, then wrapped her in threads from her belly, and commanded her to become herself, to become a new city, a new world, to give birth to many queens and many worlds.How do I know this, thought Ender.How can I see these things, like memories in my own mind.As if in answer, he saw the first of all his battles with the bugger fleets.He had seen it before on the simulator; now he saw it as the hive queen saw it, through many different eyes.The buggers formed their globe of ships, and then the terrible fighters came out of the darkness and the Little Doctor destroyed them in a blaze of light.He felt then what the hive queen felt, watching through her workers' eyes as death came to them too quickly to avoid, but not too quickly to be anticipated.There was no memory of pain or fear, though.What the hive queen felt was sadness, a sense of resignation.She had not thought these words as she saw the humans coming to kill, but it was in words that Ender understood her: They did not forgive us, she thought.We will surely die."How can you live again?"he asked.The queen in her silken cocoon had no words to give back; but when he closed his eyes and tried to remember, instead of memory came new images.Putting the cocoon in a cool place, a dark place, but with water, so she wasn't dry; no, not just water, but water mixed with the sap of a certain tree, and kept tepid so that certain reactions could take place in the cocoon.Then time.Days and weeks, for the pupa inside to change.And then, when the cocoon had changed to a dusty brown color, Ender saw himself splitting open the cocoon, and helping the small and fragile queen emerge.He saw himself taking her by the forelimb and helping her walk from her birthwater to a nesting place, soft with dried leaves on sand.Then I am alive, came the thought in his mind.Then I am awake.Then I make my ten thousand children."No," said Ender."I can't. "Anguish."Your children are the monsters of our nightmares now.If I awoke you, we would only kill you again. "There flashed through his mind a dozen images of human beings being killed by buggers, but with the image came a grief so powerful he could not bear it, and he wept their tears for them."If you could make them feel as you can make me feel, then perhaps they could forgive you. "Only me, he realized.They found me through the ansible, followed it and dwelt in my mind.In the agony of my tortured dreams they came to know me, even as I spent my days destroying them; they found my fear of them, and found also that I had no knowledge I was killing them.In the few weeks they had, they built this place for me, and the Giant's corpse and the playground and the ledge at the End of the World, so I would find this place by the evidence of my eyes.I am the only one they know, and so they can only talk to me, and through me.We are like you; the thought pressed into his mind.We did not mean to murder, and when we understood, we never came again.We thought we were the only thinking beings in the universe, until we met you, but never did we dream that thought could arise from the lonely animals who cannot dream each other's dreams.How were we to know?We could live with you in peace.Believe us, believe us, believe us.He reached into the cavity and took out the cocoon.It was astonishingly light, to hold all the hope and future of a great race within it."I'll carry you," said Ender, "I'll go from world to world until I find a time and a place where you can come awake in safety.And I'll tell your story to my people, so that perhaps in time they can forgive you, too.The way that you've forgiven me. "He wrapped the queen's cocoon in his jacket and carried her from the tower."What was in there?"asked Abra."The answer," said Ender."To what?""My question. "And that was all he said of the matter; they searched for five more days and chose a site for the new colony far to the east and south of the tower.Weeks later he came to Valentine and told her to read something he had written; she pulled the file he named from the ship's computer, and read it.It was written as if the hive queen spoke, telling all that they had meant to do, and all that they had done.Here are our failures, and here is our greatness; we did not mean to hurt you, and we forgive you for our death.From their earliest awareness to the great wars that swept across their home world, Ender told the story quickly, as if it were an ancient memory.When he came to the tale of the great mother, the queen of all, who first learned to keep and teach the new queen instead of killing her or driving her away, then he lingered, telling how many times she had finally to destroy the child of her body, the new self that was not herself, until she bore one who understood her quest for harmony.This was a new thing in the world, two queens that loved and helped each other instead of battling, and together they were stronger than any other hive.They prospered; they had more daughters who joined them in peace; it was the beginning of wisdom.If only we could have talked to you, the hive queen said in Ender's words.But since it could not be, we ask only this: that you remember us, not as enemies, but as tragic sisters, changed into a foul shape by Fate or God or Evolution.If we had kissed, it would have been the miracle to make us human in each other's eyes.Instead we killed each other.But still we welcome you now as guestfriends.Come into our home, daughters of Earth; dwell in our tunnels, harvest our fields; what we cannot do, you are now our hands to do for us.Blossom, trees; ripen, fields; be warm for them, suns; be fertile for them, planets: they are our adopted daughters, and they have come home.The book that Ender wrote was not long, but in it was all the good and all the evil that the hive queen knew.And he signed it, not with his name, but with a title:   SPEAKER FOR THE DEAD   On Earth, the book was published quietly, and quietly it was passed from hand to hand, until it was hard to believe that anyone on Earth might not have read it.Most who read it found it interesting    some who read it refused to set it aside.They began to live by it as best they could, and when their loved ones died, a believer would arise beside the grave to be the Speaker for the Dead, and say what the dead one would have said, but with full candor, hiding no faults and pretending no virtues.Those who came to such services sometimes found them painful and disturbing, but there were many who decided that their life was worthwhile enough, despite their errors, that when they died a Speaker should tell the truth for them.On Earth it remained a religion among many religions.But for those who traveled the great cave of space and lived their lives in the hive queen's tunnels and harvested the hive queen's fields, it was the only religion.There was no colony without its Speaker for the Dead.No one knew and no one really wanted to know who was the original Speaker.Ender was not inclined to tell them.When Valentine was twenty five years old, she finished the last volume of her history of the bugger wars.She included at the end the complete text of Ender's little book, but did not say that Ender wrote it.By ansible she got an answer from the ancient Hegemon, Peter Wiggin, seventy seven years old with a failing heart."I know who wrote it," he said."If he can speak for the buggers, surely he can speak for me. "Back and forth across the ansible Ender and Peter spoke, with Peter pouring out the story of his days and years, his crimes and his kindnesses.And when he died, Ender wrote a second volume, again signed by the Speaker for the Dead.Together, his two books were called the Hive Queen and the Hegemon, and they were holy writ."Come on," he said to Valentine one day."Let's fly away and live forever. ""We can't," she said."There are miracles even relativity can't pull off, Ender. ""We have to go.I'm almost happy here. ""So, stay. ""I've lived too long with pain.I won't know who I am without it. "So they boarded a starship and went from world to world.Wherever they stopped, he was always Andrew Wiggin, itinerant speaker for the dead, and she was always Valentine, historian errant, writing down the stories of the living while Ender spoke the stories of the dead.And always Ender carried with him a dry white cocoon, looking for the world where the hive queen could awaken and thrive in peace.He looked a long time.
