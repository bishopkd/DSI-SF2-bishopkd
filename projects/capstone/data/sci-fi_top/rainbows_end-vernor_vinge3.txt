A woman's voice replied, "You're almost there; it's another two miles in the direction you are heading.If I might suggest, sir, you don't really need 411 to answer questions like this.Just  "  But Robert had already stuffed the paper back in his pocket.He set out eastward, his shadow breaking the trail ahead of him.It had been a very long time since he had walked two miles.Even before the Alzheimer's, walking two miles would have been the stuff of an emergency.But today he was not even out of breath, and the pain in his joints was muted.The most important thing about me is broken, while almost everything else works .Reed Weber was right, it was a heavenly minefield.I am so lucky .Over the wind, he heard the sound of electric motors torquing up.His car was driving off to do business elsewhere.Robert did not look back.His shadow grew longer, the air cooler.And finally he had reached the beginning of nature.A little voice spoke in his ear, announcing that he was leaving the tagged section of the park.Beyond this point, only "low rate emergency wireless" was guaranteed.Robert walked on, across the unlabeled wilderness.So this is the closest thing to being alone these days .It felt good.A cold, clean purity.For a moment, the recollection of Saturday's confrontation with Bob swept over him, more real than the desert evening.There had been times, years ago, when he raged at his son, trying to shame him for wasting his talents in the military.But last Saturday, the rage had flowed in the other direction."Sit !"the boy grown up had said to his father, in a tone that Robert had never heard from him before.And Robert had dropped onto the sofa.His son towered over him for a moment.Then Bob sat down opposite him and leaned close."Miri won't talk about the details, but it's clear what you did this afternoon, mister. ""Bob, I was just  "  "Shut up.My little girl has enough problems, and you will not add to them!"His glare was long and steady.   "I didn't mean any harm, Bob.I had a bad day. "Some distant part of him realized that he was whining , and that he couldn't stop."Where is Lena, Bob?"Bob's eyes narrowed."You've asked me that before.I wondered if it was an act. "He shrugged."Now I don't care.After today, I just want you out of here, but have you looked at your finances, Dad?"It was going to come down to that."Yes there's a finance package in my WinME.My savings, I was a multimillionaire in 2000. ""That's three bubbles back, Dad.And you guessed wrong on every one.But at this point you're nearly certified as self sufficient.You'd have a hard time scaring up any public assistance.The taxpayers are not kind to seniors; old people run too much of the country already. "He hesitated."And after today, my generosity has run out.Mom died two years ago  and dumped you decades before that.But maybe you should wonder about other things.For instance, where are all your old pals from Stanford?""I  " Faces rose up in Robert's mind.He'd been in the English Department at Stanford for thirty years.There were lots of faces.Some of them belonged to people who were years younger than he was.Where were they now?Bob nodded at his silence."Right.Not one has visited you, nor even tried to contact you.I should know.Even before today, I figured that when you got your strength back you'd start hurting whoever was nearest  and that would be Miri.So I've been trying to farm you out to one of your old buddies.And you know what, Dad?There's not one who wants anything to do with you.Oh, there are newsies.You won't have to look far to find as many fans as ever  but among them all there's not a single friend. "He paused."Now you don't have any options.Finish the semester; learn what you can.And then get out of our house . ""But Lena.What about Lena?"Bob shook his head."Mom's dead.You had no use for her except when you needed a servant or a kickball.Now it's too late.She's dead. ""But  " There were memories, but they clashed with one another.The last decade at Stanford.The Bollingen Prize and the Pulitzer.Lena had not been there to share them.She had divorced him just about the time Bob joined the Marines.And yet  "You remember.Lena got me into that rest home, Rainbows End.And then she was here , when things got really dark.She was here with Cara"  his little sister, still ten years old, and dead since 2006.His words stumbled to a halt.Something glittered in his son's eyes."Yes, Mom was here, just like Cara.A shame attack won't work on me, Dad.I want you out of this house.End of the semester at the latest. "And that was the longest conversation Robert had had with anyone since Saturday.It was cold.He'd walked a long way into the desert.The night had risen partway up the sky.Stars hung over a flat land that stretched forever be yond him.Maybe that should be the "Secret of the One Who Came Back" that he just wanted to go away again, walking forever into the bluish dark.He walked a bit farther, then slowed, stopped beside a huge rough rock  and stared into the night.After some minutes, he turned and started back into the bright twilight.Juan got sidetracked from Big Lizard's quest.School began to seriously intrude.Chumlig wanted them to complete their projects and she wanted real results.Worst of all, the school board had suddenly decided the class must demo their creative compositions at Parents' Night  in place of the final exam.Low grades and Chumlig's disappointment in him were bad enough; Juan already knew he was a loser.But such public humiliation was something he desperately wanted to avoid.So for a while he was on a different quest: finding someone to team with in composition class.The problem was, Juan was no good at writing.He wasn't more than so so with math or answerboards.Ms.Chumlig said the secret of success was "to learn to ask the right questions. "But to do that she also said you had "to know something about something. "That wisdom and "everyone has some special talent" were the drumbeats of her classes.But it didn't help.Maybe the best he could hope for was a team so big the losers would shield each other.Today he sat at the back of the shop tent with Fred and Jerry.The twins had missed their proper shop class that morning, so now they were wasting the rest of the day here rather than in study hall.It was kind of fun.The two were pretending to work on a magnetic orrery  a plagiarism so obvious that their plans still had the source URLs written on them.About half the class had completed something.Doris Schley's paper airplanes were flying, but just this afternoon her team had discovered terrible stability problems.They didn't know about Fred and Jerry's unofficial project: The twins had hijacked the tent's air conditioning.While they kicked back and fooled with the orrery, they were using the fans to tumble Schley's fliers.Xiu Xiang sat hunched over the transport tray she had been working on lately.She didn't look so blank and despairing these days, even if she had warped the transport surface to where it wasn't good for anything.Xiang practically had her nose buried in the equipment.Every so often she drew back and studied her view page, then returned to the unmoving wreck she had created.Winston Blount had been scarce since Juan had put him onto the Lizard's quest.Juan counted that as encouraging; maybe Mr.Blount was working on the affiliance.Juan leaned into the cool air from the fans.Back here it was nice.It was hot and noisy over by the outside entrance, but that's where Robert Gu sat.Earlier, the guy had been watching Dr.Xiang.Sometimes she seemed to be watching him back, but even more secretly.Now Mr.Gu mainly stared at the traffic circle, watching the cars that occasionally pulled up, picked up or dropped off passengers, and then departed.The table in front of the fake teenager was littered with Buildlt fragments, and several rickety looking towers.Juan zoomed in on a couple of them from a viewpoint in the tent above Gu's head.Huh.The gadgets had no motors, not even any control logic.So Gu was going to crash in this class just as sure as Juan was in Composition.It suddenly occurred to him that maybe he could resume the Lizard's game, and take one last whack at finding a teammate for Ms.Chumlig's project.But I tried him last week .Robert Gu was the best writer Juan had ever known.He was so good he could kill you with his words.Juan tucked his chin in and tried to forget last week.And then he thought, The guy isn't wearing, so he's staring at nothing.He must he bored out of his skull Juan dithered for another ten minutes, but shop class had thirty minutes more to run and the Radners were way too focused on their anti aircraft guns.Jerry  > Juan: <sm>Hey, where you going?</sm>  Juan  > Radners: <sm>Gonna make one more try with Gu.Wish me luck.</sm>  Fred  > Juan: <sm>It's unhealthy to want a grade that bad.</sm>  Juan meandered across the pavilion, walking along the lab benches as if he were studying the other projects.He ended up beside the strange old man.Gu turned to look at him, and Juan's casual cover evaporated.Gu's sweaty face looked almost as young as Fred Radner's.But the eyes looked right into Juan, cold and cruel.Last week, the guy had seemed friendly  right up to the moment he ripped Juan apart.Now all Juan's clever opening lines were gone; even the dumb ones were hiding.Finally he managed to point at the crazy towers Robert Gu had been working on."What's the project?"The young old man continued to stare at Juan."A clock. "Then he reached into a parts box and dropped three silver balls into the top of the tallest tower."Oh!"The balls bounced down connecting stairways.The first tower was directly in front of Juan.Going to the right, each tower was a bit shorter and more complex than the last.Mr.Gu had used most of the "classic parts" that Ron Williams kept in stock.This was a clock?Juan tried to match it against old time clock patterns.There were no perfect fits, though the thing did have levers that clicked back and forth against a whatchama google an escape wheel.Maybe the balls tipping down the stairways were like the hands on a clock.Gu continued to stare at him."But it's running fast," he said.Juan leaned forward and tried to ignore that stare.He captured about three seconds of the contraption's motion, enough to identify stationary points and dimensions.There was an old mechanics program that came in handy for medieval gadget games; he fed the description into it.The results were easy to interpret."You just gotta make that lever a quarter inch longer. "He poked a finger at a tiny spar."I know. "Juan looked back at him."But you're not wearing.How did you figure that out?"Gu shrugged."A medical gift. ""That's pretty neat," Juan said uncertainly."For what?To do what any child can do already?"Juan didn't have any answer for that."But you're also a poet. ""And now I'm good with gadgets. "Gu's hand twitched out, smashing through the levers and wheels.Parts sprayed in all directions, some of them breaking under the force of his blow.That got everyone's attention.The class was suddenly quiet  and blazing with sming.It was time to back off.But Juan really really needed help with Creative Composition.And so he said, "You still know about words, though, right?""Yes, I still know about words.I still know about grammar.I can parse sentences.I can even spell  hallelujah, without mechanical aid.What's your name?""Juan Orozco. ""Yes, I remember.What are you good for, Mr.Orozco?"Juan tucked his chin in."I'm learning how to ask the right questions. ""Do so, then. ""um. "Juan looked at the other parts Gu had collected, things he hadn't used in his clock.There were rotary motors, there were wireless synchs, there were programmable gear trains.There was even a transport tray like the one Dr.Xiang had messed up."So how come you don't use any of these gadgets?That would be lots easier. "He expected Gu to spout some Chumliggy thing about solving a problem within constraints.Instead, the other poked angrily at the components."Because I can't see inside them.Look. "He nipped a rotary motor across the table. "'No user serviceable parts within. 'It's stamped right in the plastic.Everything is a black box.Everything is inscrutable magic. ""You could look at the manuals," said Juan."They show internals. "Gu hesitated.His hands were gathered into fists.Juan edged back a few inches."You can see internals?You can change them?"Juan watched the fists.He's flipping crazy ."You can see them easy.Almost everything serves up its own manual.If it doesn't, just Google on the part number. "The look on Gu's face sent Juan into fast mode: "As for changing the internals often they're programmable.But otherwise, the only changes you can make are when you order, back at the design and fab stage.I mean, these are just components .Who'd want to change them once they're made?Just trash 'em if they're not working like you want. ""Just components?"Gu looked out from under the fringes of the shop class tent.An automobile was tooling up Pala Avenue, heading for the school's traffic circle."What about the fucking cars?""Unh. "The whole class was staring.Almost the whole class: Mr.Williams was on break and out of contact.Mr.Gu twitched for a few seconds.Then suddenly he was standing.He grabbed Juan by the collar."By God I'm going to have a look. "Juan bounced along just ahead of Robert Gu's angry, pushing hands."Break open a car?Why would you want to do that?""That's the wrong question, kid. "At least they were walking away from the traffic circle.Even if he went after an automobile, what damage could he do?The car bodies were a trashy composite, easy to recycle, but strong enough to take a fifty mile per hour crash.Visions of battle lasers and monster sledgehammers came to mind.But this was the real world.Jerry  > Juan: <sm>What is the goofball up to?</sm>  Juan  > Radners: <sm>I dunno!</sm>  Robert Gu marched him across the tent to where Xiu Xiang was sitting.By the time he arrived, the only evidence of madness was the faint twitchiness in his face."Dr.Xiang?"The crazy man actually sounded relaxed and friendly, but Xiang hesitated a long moment."Yes," she said."I've been admiring your project.Some kind of mass mover?"Xiang tilted the warped surface up toward him."Yes.It's just a toy, but I thought I could get a leverage effect by warping the surface. "Talking about the gadget seemed to distract her from Gu's weirdness."Very nice!"There was nothing but charm in Gu's voice."May I?"He picked up the panel and studied the ragged edge."I had to cut out gores so the microgrooves wouldn't bind," she said, standing up to point at her work.Transport trays were for shedding dirt or sliding small containers.For most things, they were better than robot hands, even if they didn't look as impressive.Juan's mother had remodeled their kitchen with fake marble transports; afterward, everything she wanted was where it should be, in the fridge or oven or on the cutting board, just when she needed it.Usually, the microgrooves couldn't slide anything faster than a couple of inches a second.What Xiang was saying gave Juan an idea.Maybe the warped board was not broken.He started to put the dimensions into a mechanics program   But Robert Gu already seemed to know what the thing could do."You could triple the delivered force if you adjusted it, here. "He twisted the tray.It creaked the way ceramics do when you've bent them almost to the breaking point."Wait  " She reached for her project."I didn't break it.This is even better.Come on over and I'll show you. "His words were all so open and friendly.But he was already walking away.Xiang chased after him, but she didn't act like a kid would when someone grabs their property.She walked along beside Gu, her head tilted to get a look at the wrecked transport tray."But there's no way to use that mechanical advantage with just the batteries it's rated for  " The rest of what she said was mathematical; Juan just saved it.As Gu swept by the Radner twins, his right arm flicked out, grabbing a jar of metal beads that Fred and Jerry were using for their orrery."Hey!"The Radners jumped to their feet and followed him, not saying much out loud.The Adult Ed students were like untouchables.You didn't mess with them and vice versa.Jerry  > Juan: <sm>What did we miss, Juan?</sm>  Fred  > Juan: <sm>Yeah.What did you say to him?</sm>  Juan danced backwards, lifting his hands to say that he was an innocent bystander.Almost an innocent bystander.As Gu walked past his workbench, he jerked his chin toward the tent entrance."Make yourself useful, Orozco.Get me some line current. "Juan scooted ahead.There were 110VAC sources on campus, though most were indoors.He looked up public utilities and saw a big arrow pointing down into the lawn.This outlet was used to power building reconfiguration when they needed an extra auditorium.It had a thirty foot extension reel.He ran to the spot and pulled the line up from the fresh cut grass.Now all the kids  minus Schley's team, which was suddenly overjoyed by the improvement in their fliers' performance  were following them out of the tent.The car coming up the traffic loop was gliding to a stop at the curb behind him.It was Ms.Chumlig, back from lunch.Robert Gu caught up, Xiang right behind him and looking upset.Gu was no longer making nice noises.He grabbed the power cord from Juan and plugged it into the transport tray's universal, bypassing the teeny battery pack that Dr.Xiang had used.He tilted the tray on edge and poured the metal beads from the Radners' project into the top edge opening.Chumlig was out of the car."What's going on  "  The crazy man smiled at her."My shop project, Louise.I've had enough of 'no user serviceable parts within. 'Let's take a look. "He leaned over the car's front hood and ran his finger down the printed words forbidding customer maintenance.The kids stood in clusters, awed.Juan had never heard of anyone at Fairmont High going wacko.Robert Gu was making history.The old man set the transport tray against the automobile.So where is your battle laser, Mr.Spaceman ?Gu sighted along the edge of the tray, then glanced to his right, at the Radner brothers."You really don't want to be standing there. "Xiu Xiang was frantic, shouting at the twins."Get back, get back!"And now Juan was getting way unbelievable answers from his mechanics program.He hopped back from the transport tray.Robert Gu didn't need a battle laser.For this job, he had something just as good.Gu powered up the tray.The noise was like tearing cloth but loud , a crack of doom sound.Real sparks sprayed from where the transport tray touched the car's hood.Twenty feet ahead of the car, where the Radners had been standing, there was an oleander hedge.Some of the branches were as thick as Juan's arm.Now the white flowers were dancing like there was a breeze; one of the largest branches snapped and fell on the sidewalk.Gu slid the tray along the curve of the automobile, driving dozens of metal beads per second into the hood, cutting an eighth inch wide slit in the composite.He turned the tray  the cutter  and made a corner.Now the lawn near his feet was ripped by the invisible ricochets.In less than ten seconds, Gu had brought the cut around to itself.The carved section fell into the dark of the car's drive compartment.Gu tossed Xiu Xiang's project onto the lawn.He reached into the drive compartment and flipped out the loose hull section.A ragged and maybe disdainful cheer rose from the kids behind him."Hey, dork!There has to be a latch.Why didn't you scam the lock?"Gu didn't seem to hear.He leaned forward to look into the interior.Juan edged closer.The compartment was in shadow, but he could see well enough.Not counting damage, it looked just like the manual said.There were some processor nodes and fiber leading to the dozens of other nodes and sensors and effectors.There was the steering servo.Along the bottom, just missed by Gu's cutting, was the DC bus to the left front wheel.The rest was empty space.The capacitor and power cells were in the back.Gu stared into the shadows.There was no fire, no explosion.Even if he had chopped into the back, the safeties would have prevented any spectacular outcome.But Juan saw more and more error flags float into view.A junk wagon would be coming real soon.Gu's shoulders slumped, and Juan got a closer look at the component boxes.Every one had physical signage: no user serviceable parts within.The old guy stood and took a step away from the car.Behind them, Chumlig and now Williams were on the scene, herding the students back into the tent.For the most part, the kids were fully stoked by all the insanity.None of them, not even the Radner brothers, ever had the courage to run amok.When they committed something major, it was usually done in software, like what the guy had shouted from the crowd.Xiu Xiang gathered up her weird, Gu improved, project.She was shak ing her head and mumbling to herself.She unplugged the gadget and took a step toward Robert Gu."I object to your appropriation of my toy!"she said.There was an odd expression on her face."Though you did improve it with that extra bend. "Gu didn't respond.She hesitated."And I never would have run it with line power!"Gu waved at the guts of the dead car."It's Russian dolls all the way down, isn't it, Orozco?"Juan didn't bother to look up "Russian dolls. ""It's just throwaway stuff, Professor Gu.Why would anyone want to fool with it?"Xiu Xiang leaned around him, saw the nearly empty compartment, and the boxes with their stamped on labels.She look up at Gu."You're worse off than I am, aren't you?"she said softly.Gu's hand twitched up and for a moment Juan thought he was going to punch her out."You worthless bitch.You were never more than an engineer, and now you have to reeducate even for that. "He turned and walked away along the traffic circle, down the hill toward Pala Avenue.Xiang took a step or two after Gu.From inside the school, Chumlig was demanding that everyone come indoors; Juan reached out to touch Xi ang's arm."We gotta go back inside, Dr.Xiang. "She didn't argue, but turned and walked back toward the tent, her transport tray held close.Juan followed her, all the time watching the crazy man as he departed in the opposite direction.Even with Robert Gu off campus, the rest of the afternoon was fairly exciting.The school board invoked cloture.Well, they tried to invoke cloture.But they had to allow the students contact with home, and most kids regarded this as an opportunity to grab a journo affiliance.Juan had been close enough to provide some of the best pictures of the "great automobile wrecking"; his mother was not happy about that.She'd be even less happy when she noticed that "the madman" was in three of Juan's classes.So anyway the campus was famous in San Diego and beyond, competing with the billion other bizarrities of the day, all over the planet.Students from other classes played hookey and came over.Juan saw a young, kind of plump kid talking in person with Ms.Chumlig.Miri Gu.By 3:00 p. m.  the excitement had faded.This was past the end of classes for most students.The Radners' betting pool on Gu's punishment had been bought out by some guys in LA.Lucky for the twins.The trouble with instant fame was that there was always something new coming to distract everyone's attention.Overall, it had been a wild day, but kind of sad.Juan was almost home when he got a phone call.A phone call?Well, Classic IM Lite was what Epiphany called it.This must be his great grandpa."Yes?"he replied, without thinking.The call came as a window view from a synthetic camera.He was looking upward, into a small bedroom.Bizarre decorations, though: hardcopy books stacked in cardboard boxes.A distorted face filled most of the screen.Then the caller sat back.It was Robert Gu, calling from his view page."Hi kid. ""Hi, Professor. "In person, Robert Gu was fully scary.In this cheap flat view, he just looked small and crumpled."Look, kid" The picture twisted and jerked.Gu was fidgeting with the page.When it settled, the other's face filled the screen again."What you were talking about last week.I think I could help out with your writing. "Yes !"That would be tragic, Professor Gu. "Gu gave him a blank look."I mean, that would be way cool.And I'd be happy to show you how to wear. "He was already thinking how he would explain this to his ma."Right. "Gu's face retreated, and he gave a shrug."I suppose that would be fine too.If they let me back in school, I'll see you there. "09    Carrot Greens  Make no mistake about it, this job of saving the world was no bed of roses.Alfred glared at Gnberk Braun's latest report: "Covert Search for Grand Terror in San Diego. "Things had been hard enough before Gnberk spotted Alfred's YGBM project, but since the Barcelona meeting, Alfred's duplicity had become steadily more difficult to maintain.He had never expected that Braun could keep such a careful watch on the San Diego labs.Alfred had had to shut down almost all his activity there, even canceling his regular specimen outshipments; this affair had set his schedule back by months.The only bright spot was that Gnberk and Keiko were going ahead with Plan Rabbit.In fact, Rabbit had resurfaced a week ago, along with his initial survey and his payment demands.The demands had been laughable, basically a wholesale shopping list of enhancement drugs, just what you might think South American drug lords could supply to a bright young businessman.As for his survey  Rabbit had come up with a list of contacts in San Diego and a complicated plan for getting direct surveillance equipment into the labs.Gnberk and Keiko had been respectively irritated and amused by the scheme, but all three of them agreed they could make it work.The Americans would know they had been probed, but unless things went very wrong, the operation would be deniable.Of course, what Gnberk and Keiko saw was the easy part.The hard part was what Alfred was hiding beneath Plan Rabbit.When this magnificent intrusion/inspection was complete, there would be no evidence of his research program.Working as the trusted leader of the operation, Alfred was confident that he could accomplish that much.The triumph would be to leave credible evidence that would point bird dog Gnberk somewhere far across the world  and leave Alfred's operation intact in San Diego.Failing that, Alfred would have to rebuild his research setup  and his security  at second rate sites.He could lose a year or two of development time.Would such a delay really matter?He had completed the hard part.The honeyed nougat test had demonstrated that he had a delivery system.In fact, his Pseudomimi viral was far more robust that Gnberk realized.If Grand Terror had been Alfred's goal, he was already in the winner's circle; he could trigger devastating psychosis, even customize for particular targets.The way to develop higher mental controls was clear.But meantime, the human race was still careening down a mountain road, with no one at the wheel.The Saturday night specials, the cheap delivery systems, the plagues  there was always the next precipice, the Next Very Bad Thing.What if the Next Very Bad Thing was the final, fatal Bad Thing, and what if they ran into it before he could take control?So yes, anything he could do to save a few months was worthwhile.He pushed away Gnberk's report and returned to planning just what he would do during the brief hours when this operation put Gnberk and Keiko and himself in control of the San Diego labs.He was so absorbed in his scheming that he almost didn't hear the sound behind him.There was a small popping noise and a little whoosh of air, typical game sound effects.They were sounds that absolutely did not belong here.Alfred flinched and turned.Rabbit had grown."Hi there!"it said."I thought I'd pop up and give you a special progress report, maybe ask for your help with some details. "Rabbit gave Alfred a bucktoothed grin and sat back to enjoy a carrot.Sat back in the big leather visitor's chair across from Alfred's desk.In Alfred's office.His inner office, the one here in the bombproof catacombs under Mumbai, at the heart of India's External Intelligence Agency.Alfred had managed covert operations for almost seventy years.It had been decades since he had been so rudely upset.It was like being young again  not a good feeling.He stared at Rabbit for a moment, absorbing the terrible implications of the creature's presence.Perhaps it would be best to ignore those for now .And so his reply was a random flail: "A progress report?We've seen your progress.I personally was somewhat disappointed.You've accomplished little  "  "That you can see. ""  beyond creating a fog of foolishness, self defeating as often as not.The 'local agents' you've recruited are incompetent.For example  " Alfred made a show of fetching records.Meantime, the people in the EIA analyst pool were tracing Rabbit's intrusion.They opened a graphics window above the creature's head.Rabbit was coming through routers on three continents."For example," Alfred continued, picking a name almost at random, "take this 'Winston Blount. 'Years ago, he was a top administrator at UCSD.But he never had any personal connection with the founders of the bio labs, and today" He waved his hand in dismissal."These people have so little connection with the San Diego labs that I might validly ask what we are getting for our money. "The Rabbit leaned across Alfred's mahogany desk.Its reflection in the deep varnish moved in perfect synchrony."You might ask.And what great ignorance that would reveal.You know what to look for and still this is all you have discovered.Think how invisible this must be to the Americans.I am a phantom that shows as brownian noise until  viola!the jaws of my operation spring shut. "A smile stretched across Rabbit's face.It gave its ears a wiggle, and gestured around Alfred's inner sanctum."In a very small way  just a proof of principle, really  those jaws closed on you today.You, the Japanese, the Europeans, you all thought you had me fooled.What of your anonymity now, eh?Eh?"Alfred glowered at the animal.No need to disguise his upset.But pray God this is all he has discovered .Rabbit settled its elbows on Alfred's desk and continued chattily, "Don't worry, I'm not being so open with your pals in Japanese and EU Intelligence.I figure it might panic them  and this is a project I've come to enjoy, meeting new people, learning new skills.You understand. "It cocked its head as if expecting some confidence in return.Alfred pretended to consider the matter and finally gave Rabbit a judicious nod."Yes.Knowing our cover was blown  even to an insider such as yourself  they would likely abort the mission.You did the right thing. "The numbers above Rabbit's ears were changing.The available routing information was mostly bogus, but the network latencies  the delays  made his analysts eighty percent confident that Rabbit was coming from North America.Without help from the European signals intelligence people, he wasn't going to get any better estimate.But telling Gnberk about this visit was the last thing Alfred wanted to do.So I must treat this son of a hitch as a respected colleague .Alfred sat back and essayed a mild demeanor."Between us then.What has been your progress?"The rabbit tossed the butt end of his carrot onto Vaz's desk and crossed his paws behind his head."Heh.I've almost completed assembling the operational team.That file you're looking at probably lists some of them, including the esteemed Dean Blount.I can pay off most of these people with my own resources.One of them may play ball in a spirit of good natured adventure.The others need inducements that the wealth of nations can satisfy.And the one thing the Indo European Alliance has is the wealth of nations. ""As long as it is totally untraceable and doesn't look like the wealth of nations. ""Trust me.If these loons think about it at all, they'll figure we really are South American drug lords.Anyway, I'll have their wish list for you in a week or so.If all goes according to plan, you'll have full access to the San Diego bio labs for almost four hours, sometime in late December. ""Excellent. ""And then maybe you'll tell me just what you're looking for in those labs. ""We believe the Americans are up to something there. "Rabbit's eyebrows raised."A Great Power betraying its own kind?""It's happened before," though not since the early part of the century, the Sino American misunderstanding."Hmm. "For a brief moment, Rabbit seemed almost thoughtful."I trust you'll let me in on what you discover. "Alfred nodded."If we can can keep this between the two of us. "In fact, Rabbit learning about Alfred's YGBM project would give new meaning to the phrase "worst case outcome. "Fortunately, Rabbit did not push the issue."There is one other thing," said the creature."One last contact, an interesting fellow  in a way more interesting to me than all your espionage hugger mugger. ""Very well. "Alfred resolved to accept whatever foolishness the other was spouting.A picture of a youngish Chinese fellow hung in the air.Vaz's gaze swept through the attached bio.No, this chap wasn't young."That's Bob Gu's father?You're going to fiddle with  " He spluttered into silence, remembering recent events in Paraguay.For a moment he forgot the need for placid acceptance; some types of foolishness were very hard to swallow."See here, this operation was to be discreet.How could you  "  "Not to worry.I have zero interest in Junior.It's just one of those crazy coincidences.See, Bob Gu's father is Alice Gu's father in law. "Hmm ?Alfred parsed the contorted language.Then he realized that Rabbit was talking about Alice Gong.Oh .Rabbit had left the land of the foolish and was trekking deep into madness.Alfred was speechless."Ah, you know about Alice then?Did you know that she is tooling up for a full scale audit of San Diego bio lab security?Just think!Real soon now, the Americans are gonna go ask Alice to tighten up the guard there.Tracking her is muy importante , old man. "" ..Yes. "The EU and Japan would bail out if they knew Alice Gong Gu was on this case.And Alice will surely detect what Ym doing at the bio labs ."So what are you proposing?""I want to make sure Alice is not guarding the labs when we go in.I've had Gu Senior on a line for several days.But that's going too slowly.Besides  " another challenging, toothy grin "  I'm dying to talk to the guy directly.We need a zombie contact. "Another picture/bio popped up."An Indian national?""Subtle, am I not?Yes, though for the last two years Mr.Sharif has been living in the U. S. A.  He really has no connection with any Indo European intelligence service.I'll contact him like the gentle cloud of coincidence that I am.If the Americans identify him, he will be a perfect red herring.Your EU and Japanese friends would be too cowardly to go for this.You , I think, have more courage.So I'm here to give you a heads up.Cover me on this.Keep your people out of Sharif's way.Sometimes he will really be me. "Vaz was silent for a long moment.He had not known that Alice Gong Gu was training for an audit of the San Diego labs.That was bad news.Very bad news.It wasn't enough that Gong be kept away one night.Then inspiration struck.Alice's genius came at a terrible sacrifice.He had stumbled on her secret several years ago; in her own way, she risked more than Alfred ever had.And my weapon, incomplete as it is, could stop her cold .He looked back at Rabbit."Indeed, you have my support in this.It should involve just the two of us. "Rabbit preened."But if I may make a suggestion," Alfred continued, one colleague to another."It may be best if we schedule things so that Alice Gu is on duty the night we go in.With proper preparation, we may be able to turn her presence to our advantage. ""Really?"Rabbit was literally bug eyed with curiosity."How is that?""I'll have the details for you in a few days. "In fact, there were lots of details, but not for Rabbit's ears.Alfred was already posting the mission requirements to his inner teams.How long would it take to build a Pseudomimivirus appropriate to Alice's special weakness?What was the surest delivery method?Indirect infection was probably not practical here.And what cover story would work best with this wretched rabbit?Said rabbit was still looking at him expectantly."Of course," Vaz continued, "there are aspects of the matter that I should best keep to myself. ""Heh.Of course.World shaking plans, and so forth?Never mind, I am content to remain your Great Cutout from Heaven.I'll be in touch.Meantime  " Suddenly he was wearing a gray uniform studded with medals and draped with aiguillettes.He stuck his arm out in a hitlerian salute."Long live the Indo European Alliance!"With that, the rabbit's image vanished like the cheap theatrics it was.Alfred sat motionless for almost two minutes, not responding to the shrill alarms that pounded through the office network, not responding to the various staff analyses that were already being generated.Alfred was rearranging his priorities.He hadn't known about Alice Gong Gu, but now he did and with enough time to turn her presence into an advantage.It was a sad thing that he would harm this woman who was actually fighting on his side, who had done more than almost anyone to keep the world safe.He forced his attention back on track.Besides dealing with Alice, there was another new priority: to learn more about Rabbit, to learn how to destroy him.Alfred Vaz had no official rank in the External Intelligence Agency, but he had immense power there.Even with modern compartmentalization techniques, he never could have cloaked his research programs otherwise.Now well, Rabbit's visit to EIA headquarters was arguably the most spectacular intelligence failure of the decade  but only if outsiders knew to argue about it!Alfred used all his power in the Agency and all the secret political levers he had accumulated over seventy years to keep the news within his own teams.If the EIA inspector general had got a whiff of it, all Alfred's plans would have unraveled.It was a sad fact that his own government would probably count him as a traitor if it knew of his efforts to save the world.All this made investigating Rabbit's jape a delicate affair.Somehow this enemy had penetrated the most secure isolation firewall known.Rabbit had even coopted hi res localizer support (evident from his perfectly positioned imagery).The obvious explanation was that Rabbit had succeeded in subverting the Secure Hardware Environment.If that were so, then the foundation of all modern security was suspect  and Rabbit's visit was a clap of doom.Surely Armageddon would not be announced by a silly rabbit?There followed almost eighty hours of uncertainty as Alfred's inner teams pounded away at the mystery.Finally, his EIA analysts discovered the true explanation, something at once comforting and deeply embarrassing to them: Rabbit had  admittedly with extraordinary cleverness  exploited a combination of buggy software and foolish registry settings, the kind of flaws that bedevil careless consumers.The bottom line: Rabbit was far more dangerous than Alfred had originally thought, but he was not the Next Very Bad Thing.Vaz suffered through every moment of the suspense.But in the end, the most infuriating aspect of the incident was the piece of carrot that Rabbit left on his desk.With all the resources and expertise of the modern Indian state, it took EIA signals intelligence almost three days to obliterate the logic that injected that image into his office network.10    An Excellent Thesis Topic  Miri kept a low profile around the house, even though that bothered Alice  which was kind of contradictory, since Bob didn't want her talking with Robert anytime soon.Either way, they both seemed to think that given the chance, Robert would just hurt her again.Okay.She let Robert have the living room whenever he pleased.She made sure she was outside when he was in.But she also snooped on him whenever she honorably could.Halloween was just around the corner.She should be over at her friends' sites, deep into final planning.She and Annette and Paula had done so much prep with SpielbergRowling.Now it all seemed kind of dumb.So Miri hung out with farther away friends.Jin's parents were shrinks in the Provincial Medical Care Group in Hainan.Jin didn't speak very good English, but then Miri's Mandarin was worse.Actually, language wasn't a problem.They'd get together on his beach or hers  depending on which side of the world was daylight or had the nicest weather  and chatter away in Goodenuf English, the air around them filled with translation guesstimates and picture substitutions.Their little clique had contributed lots to the answerboards; it was the most "socially responsible" of Miri's hobbies.Jin was full of theories about Robert: "Your grandfather was way gone dead before the doctors bring him back.No surprise he feel bad now. "He floated a couple of academic papers in support of his point.Today Jin was hosting several other kids who had senile or otherwise damaged old folks living at home.Mostly they just listened, as sand crabs or simply presence icons.A few presented human forms, maybe their real world appearance.Now one of those  she looked about ten years old  spoke up."My great great aunt is like that.Back in the twentieth, she was an account executive. "Hmm, account executive didn't mean anything like the English words might make you think."By the teens she was all crippled up.I've seen pictures.And she got drifty and depressed.My grandma said she lost her edge and then she lost her job. "One of the sand crabs reared back, a lurker drawn into the open."So what's new in that?My brother is all unemployed and depressed, and he's only twenty.It's hard to keep up. "The ten year old ignored the interruption."Gee grantie was just old fashioned.Grandma got her a job as a landscape artist  " The little girl slipped into pure picturing, showing old time cellphone advertisements for background scenery you could rent for when people call and you're in the bathroom."Grantie was good at that, but she never made as much money as before.And then video landscapes went fully irrelevant.Anyway, she lived with my grandma for twelve years.It sounds just like what you're talking about, Miri. "Twelve years!Vllgo bonkers after even a year of this .She glared at the little girl."So what happened then?""Oh, everything turned out fine in the end.My mom found a treatment site.They specialize in upgraded specialties.Forty eight hours at their clinic and Gee grantie had the skills of an ad manager. "Which was about the modern equivalent of "account executive. "Silence.Even some of the crabs looked a little shocked.After a moment, Jin said, "That sound like JITT to me. ""Just in time training?What if it is?""JITT is illegal," said Miri.This is not something I want to talk about ."It wasn't illegal back then.And this JITT wasn't so bad.Gee grantie lives pretty well as long as she keeps taking her upgrades.She seems happy, 'cept that she cries a lot. ""Sound like mind control to me," said Jin.The little girl laughed."It is not.You should know that, Jin Li!You, Chinese, with two shrink parents. "Her eyes danced about, searching on things the others could not see."Your parents were in the army, weren't they?They must know all about mind control.That's what you Han tried in Myanmar!"Jin came to his feet, and kicked sand through the little girl's image."No!I mean, that is year and year ago.Nobody do anything like that now.We certainly don't!"Miri decided she didn't like the little girl.What she said was more or less true, but Bob had talked to her once about the Myanmar Restoration, back when she was doing a history project in the fifth grade.She had quoted him as "an unamed source high in the American military"; in fact, he said the same thing as most websites.You Gotta Believe Me technology had been a Big Nightmare possibility for years.Myanmar was the only place where YGBM had been tried on a large scale."It all comes down to the delivery problem," Bob had said."The Chinese army had some new drugs, things that were very persuasive in a research lab.But in the field?The Chinese sank half their budget into YGBM and they didn't get as much payoff as a good propaganda campaign. "Humans had a million years of evolution learning to resist the power of suggestion; there was no magic way to beat that!Now Miri came to her feet, too."Hey!"she said, in the tone Alice occasionally used."I didn't come here to talk politics!I came for help with my grandfather. "The little girl stared at her for a moment, her face quirked in an odd smile.The air was full of support for Miri, unanimous minus one.After a moment, the little girl shrugged."I was just trying to help.Hey, I'll be good.I'm all ears. "And she demonstrated with a graphical exaggeration, growing wiggly rabbit ears.So they all sat down again and had a quiet moment.Miri looked out along the beach.She knew this was the true view even though she had never been to Hainan in person.It was beautiful, a lot like the Cove in La Jolla, but this beach was much bigger, with correspondingly more real people.Out near the horizon there were three white peaks, icebergs on their way to coastal cities farther north.Just like in California."Okay, then," said Jin."How we help Miri Gu?But no JITT.That's a dead end.Is your grandpa good at anything now day?""Well, he's always been great with words, better than anyone I know.He has poor clothes sense, but he's become very quick with numbers and mechanical things. "That brought a wave of interest; some of the crabs opened up with little stories about numeracy."But that just seems to send him into a rage. "She showed them the story of the disemboweled automobile.If Louise Chumlig hadn't stood up for him, that would have gotten him expelled.The little girl's big ears had shrunk back to normal size.Of course, she had more opinions: "Heh.I'm reading about him, what he was like before.He had a track record back in the twentieth century.'Famous Poet,' blah blah blah.But he was only beloved by people who never met him. ""That's not true!Robert never suffered fools gladly, b but  " She ran out of steam, remembering Lena and the stories about Graunty Cara.And remembering the Ezra Pound Incident.Jin dug his toes into the sand."Let's get back to track.Does he have any friends in school?""N No.He's been matched up with Juan Orozco.That kid is like most in those classes, a dumbhead. ""What about friends from before?"said the little girl.Miri shook her head.All the people Robert had known and helped when he was a great poet, none of them had made contact.Was being a friend such a temporary thing?"There are other old people in the class, but they're on different projects.They hardly talk at all. ""Go for a personality match.There must be hundreds of people with complementary problems. "The little girl smiled."Then arrange for an accidental collision?See, if your grandpa doesn't know you're working behind the scenes, he can't be resentful. "She looked up, as if surprised by insight: "Better yet  once upon a time your grandpa stirred up a lotta critical interest.I bet there are still graduate students who would love to fawn on him.Sell one of them a truly excellent thesis topic!"Afterward, Miri did a number of character searches.One of the guys in Robert's Fairmont classes had known him for years!She should have noticed that before.The two had so much in common!If she could just get them together.Hmm.Too bad that dummy Orozco was teaming with Robert But Winston Blount was into something outside of school, and that involved at least one other person who had been in grad school with Robert way back in the 1970s.How to set up something to bring them all together?She also searched for graduate students who might want to talk with Robert.She was confident that no grandparent of Miri Gu would be susceptible to false flattery, but it would be nice for Robert to meet an outsider who obviously respected him.If it was somebody with weak data skills well, that might be good, too; she might be able to help out directly.She did a world search, the kind of thing that drags in yak herders desirous of learning English.But this time  hey, she got a near perfect match in less than five minutes.And this Sharif fellow was in Oregon, just far enough away that most contact would be virtual and tweakable.For all her snottiness, the little girl had made some really good suggestions.Miri hesitated.In fact, all the really successful suggestions had been due to the little girl.Maybe the "little girl" persona was covering something.Miri started a query replicating out through everyone and everything that might provide identity clues.But even if the kid were really ten years old, it wouldn't prove anything.Some fifth graders were scary.The woman was tall, and dressed in black."I understand you're looking for some help," she said.Huh ?Zulfikar Sharif looked up from his beef taco.He hadn't heard her approach.Then he realized that he was still alone at his table in the back of the OSU caf.He frowned at the apparition, "I'm not accepting fantasies. "God protect me.I've been perverted still again .The woman looked at him severely.She wasn't more than thirty, but he couldn't imagine her on a date."Young man, I am not your fantasy.You are looking for help with a thesis topic, are you not?""Oh!"Zulfi Sharif was no lover of high technology, but now in his second year in the OSU Literature Department, he'd become a bit desperate.His thesis advisor was no help; Professor Blandings seemed most interested in having a permanent, unpaid research assistant.So way back in January, Sharif had put out feelers for help.That had provoked endless adverts for plagiarized and custom writ material.Annie Blandings was so obnoxious that Sharif was almost tempted by some of the early offers  till his geekier friends pointed out how badly that could go wrong.Sharif had filtered out the plagiarists and the sarcastic jerkoffs.That left very little.So much for high technology.He had spent the last two semesters propping up Blandings's career in Deconstructive Revisionism.In the remaining time, he worked at a 411 job for the American Poetry Association and did his best to craft a thesis out of vapor.He had come to America hoping for old world insight into the literature that he loved.Lately, he was beginning to wonder if he should have stayed home in Kolkata.And now, suddenly, this woman.The answer to my prayers.Yes, sure .He waved her to be seated; at least that would embarrass her.But the apparition knew exactly where it stood.It slid into the chair across the table with scarcely an overlap of body and furniture."I was really expecting an email," he said.The woman in black just shrugged.Her imperious glance did not wa ver.After a moment, Sharif continued, "In fact, I am looking for a thesis topic.But I'll have you know, I'm not interested in fraud, or plagiarism, or collaboration.If you're selling that, then please shove off.I simply want the sort of pointers"  and support  "that a good thesis advisor would give a student. "The lady smiled a cruel smile, and it suddenly occurred to Sharif that she might be connected to Annie Blandings.The old fart didn't even wear  but maybe she had friends who did."Nothing whatsoever illegal, Mr.Sharif.I simply saw your ad.I have a tremendous opportunity for you. ""And I don't have much money!""I'm sure we can come to an arrangement.Interested?""Well possibly. "The lady in black leaned forward.Even her shadow matched the cafeteria lighting.Sharif hadn't realized that such precision was possible."I don't suppose you know that Robert Gu is alive and well and living in Southern California?""Huh?Bullshit!He died some years ago.There hasn't been" His words dribbled off before her silent stare.He tapped briefly at his phantom keypad, calling up a standard search.Since he started working 411, he'd become rather good at this kind of ultra fast research.Results streamed across the tabletop."Okay.He just stopped writing.Alzheimer's and he's come back !""Indeed.Does this suggest possibilities?""um. "Sharif continued his guppy imitation for a second or two.If I had just looked for the right facts, I would have known this a month ago ."It does suggest possibilities. "Interviewing Robert Gu would run a close second to chatting up William Shakespeare."Good. "The lady in black tented her fingers."There are complications, however. ""Like what?"An opportunity this good must be a scam."Robert  " The woman's image seem to freeze for an instant, maybe a communications jitter.  "Professor Gu has never suffered fools gladly.And never less so than now.I can give you access capability in his private enum.It will be up to you to intrigue him. "Without the enum, getting through to the great man could be very difficult."How much?"he said.He had twenty thousand dollars in the student credit union.Perhaps his brother in Kolkata could be hit up for one more loan."Ah, my price is not in dollars.I simply ask to tag along, occasionally to make a suggestion or ask a question. ""But I'll have first use?""Of course. ""I, well   " Sharif wavered.Robert Gu !"Okay, you've got a deal. ""Very good. "The lady gestured for his hand."Give me a moment of full access. "Epiphany Rule Number One, what they pound on in all the instructions: Full access is only for parents and spouses  and then only if you like to take chances .Whether it was her tone or his need Sharif was never sure, but he reached out and touched the empty air.He matched the pointing gesture with a lowering of security.The tingle in his fingers was surely his imagination, but now the air between them was full of binding certificates.Then the paperwork was done.What remained in the air was a single enum.Sharif stared at the identifier with sudden apprehension."So I just call him?"She nodded."Now you have that capability.But remember what I said about his his intolerance for fools.Do you know his works?"Or course."Do you admire them?""Yes!I honestly and intelligently admire the hell out of them. "It was a claim that worked with all the profs Sharif knew.In this case, it was also the truth.The lady nodded."That may be enough.Keep in mind that Professor Gu is not feeling well.He is still recovering from his illness.You may have to be directly useful to him. ""I'll empty the man's chamber pot if that will help. "Again a brief freeze of expression."Ah!I don't think that will be necessary.But he misses things from the past.He misses the way books used to be.You know, those clunky things you have to carry around. "Who is this creature ?But he nodded."I know all about, um, physical books.I can show him plenty, and in person. "He was already looking up taxi services."Very good. "The apparition smiled."Good luck, Mr.Sharif. "And it was gone.Sharif sat for almost a minute, staring blankly into the space lately occupied by the woman in black.And then he was consumed by the desire to share this news with others.Fortunately, the caf was nearly empty this late at night, and Sharif was not one of those who could message as quickly as they were overcome by the whim.No, after a moment he realized that this was likely something he should keep under his hat, at least until he'd established a connection with Robert Gu.Besides second thoughts were percolating up.How could I be so stupid as to let her into my wearable ?He ran the Epiphany integrity check a couple of times.Widgets of purity floated in the air above his taco.Epiphany said he was clean; of course, if he'd been totally perverted that's exactly what it would say.Damnation.I don't want to fry clean my clothes.Not again !Especially in this case.He looked at the golden enum: Robert Gu's own direct identifier.If he took the right approach, he would finally have his thesis.Not just any ordinary thesis.Sharif considered Robert Gu to be from the highest rank of modern literature, up there with Williams and Cho.And Annie Blandings thought Gu was God.11    Introduction to the Librareome Project  Wearable computers, what a concept.IBM PC meets Epiphany brand high fashion.In fact, Robert might have mistaken his new wardrobe for ordinary clothes.True, the shirts and pants were not a style he favored.There were embroidered patterns both inside and out.But the embroidery was more noticeable to the touch than the eye; Juan Orozco had to show him special views to reveal the net of microprocessors and lasers.The main problem was the damn contact lenses.He had to put them on every morning and then wear them all day.There were constant twinkles and flashes in his eyes.But with practice, he got control of that.He felt a moment of pure joy the first time he managed to type a query on a phantom keyboard and view the Google response floating in the air before him There was a feeling of power in being able to draw answers out of thin air.And then there was what Juan Orozco called "ensemble coding. "A week passed.Robert was practicing with his beginner's outfit, trying to repeat the coding tricks Juan had shown him.For the most part, even the simplest gestures didn't work when he first tried them.But he would flail and flail  and when the command did work, the success gave him a pitiful spike of joy and he worked even harder.Like a boy with a new computer game.Or a trained rat.When the phone call came, he thought he was having a stroke.There were bright flashes before his eyes, and a faraway buzzing sound.The buzzing broke into words: " very muzzzz like to interview you zzzz'xx "  Aha!Spam, or some kind of reporter."Why would I want to give an interview?""Bzzzt a short int view. ""Even a short one. "Robert's reply was a reflex.It had been years since he'd had the opportunity to dump on a journalist.The light was still a glaring shapelessness, but when Robert straightened his collar, the voice became sharp and perfect."Sir, my name is Sharif, Zulfikar Sharif.The interview would be for my Lit in English thesis. "Robert squinted and shrugged, squinted again.And then suddenly he got it right: his visitor was standing in the middle of the bedroom.I have to tell Juan about this !It was his first real three dimensional success, and everything that the kid had claimed about retinal painting.Robert stood and stepped to the side, looking behind the visitor.The image was so solid, so complete.Hmm .And yet the visitor cast shadows contrary to the real lighting.I wonder whose fault that is ?His dark skinned visitor  Indian?Pakistani?his voice held a South Asian lilt  was still talking."Please don't say no, sir!Interviewing you would be my great honor.You are a resource for all humanity. "Robert walked back and forth in front of the visitor.He was still boggled by the medium of the message."Just a small amount of your precious time, sir!That's all I ask.And  " He looked around Robert's room, probably seeing what was truly there.Robert had not had a chance to set up false backgrounds.Juan had been going to show him that yesterday, but they had gotten sidetracked by Robert's side of the bargain  tutoring the kid in English.Poor, subliterate Juan.This Sharif fellow on the other hand: How bright are graduate students these days ?This particular graduate student was looking more and more desperate.His gaze caught on something behind Robert."Ah, books!You are one who still treasures the real thing. "Robert's "bookcases" were made from plastic slats and cardboard boxes.But they held all the books he had rescued from the basement.Some of them  the Kipling  he would never have bothered with in the old days.But these were all he had now.He looked back at Sharif."Indeed I do.Your point, Mr.Sharif?""I just thought  it means we share the same values.By helping me, you'll be advancing those noble passions. "He paused  listening to some inner voice?Since his lessons with Juan, Robert had become suspicious of people listening to their inner voices."Perhaps we could strike a bargain, sir.I would give almost anything for a few hours of your opinions and reminiscence.I would be happy to be your personal 411 agent.I'm an expert at such services; it's how I pay my way at OSU.I can guide you through the contemporary world. ""I already have a tutor. "And when he considered the flippancy, he felt a twinge of surprise.In a sense it was true: he had Juan.Another significant silence."Oh.Him. "Sharif  his image, perfect except for the misplaced shadows and the shoes that disappeared a quarter inch into the floor  walked around Robert.To get a closer look at the books?Suddenly, Robert had even more questions for Juan Orozco.But Sharif was talking again: "These are permanently printed?Not just in time chapbooks?""Of course!""Wonderful.You know I could show you around the UCSD library. "Millions of volumes."I can go down there myself, anytime. "But so far he hadn't quite dared.Robert looked at his little library.In the middle ages, a rich man might have so many books.Now people with books were rare once again.But at UCSD, there was a real, physical library.And going with his graduate student that would be a little like the old days.He looked back at Sharif."When?""Why not now?"Robert would have to let Juan Orozco know this afternoon's session was off.He felt an instant of uncharacteristic embarrassment.Juan was going to show him how to do glance searches, and Robert had promised Juan scansion.Robert pushed the regrets aside."Let's go, then," he said.Robert took a car down to campus.For some reason, he couldn't get a clear image of Sharif inside the automobile.There was just his voice chattering away, asking Robert for his opinion of everything they saw, offering opinions and facts whenever Robert seemed even faintly puzzled.Robert had driven past the outskirts of campus before; today he would see what the place had finally become.Coming out of Fallbrook, there were the usual subdivisions, unexceptional and dull.But just north of campus, he drove past endless gray green buildings.Here and there, windowless walkways stretched across the canyons."Bioscience labs," Sharif cheerfully explained."They're mostly underground. "He fed Robert's Epiphany with pointers to images and details.Ah.So these doorless, windowless structures were not some twenty first century experiment in communal living.In fact, there weren't more than a few dozen people inside them.The connecting corridors were for biosample transport.Monstrous things might gestate in these buildings and in the caverns below.But salvation, too.Robert gave them a little salute.Reed Weber's heavenly minefield was created in places like these.These were the anterooms to UCSD.He braced himself for unintelligible futurism: the main campus.His car drove down Torrey Pines Road.The intersections were almost as he remembered, though there were no traffic lights and no stopping.Cross traffic interleaved with smooth and eerie grace.Someday I must write a lighthearted piece about the secret life of automobiles .He had never seen one stop for much longer than it took passengers to get off and on.Out in the desert, his car had departed almost immediately, stranding him.But by the time he got back to the road, another had pulled up.The devices were always moving.He imagined them circling the county, forever maneuvering so that no customer ever need wait more than a few moments.But what do they do at night, when business is scarce ?That would be the topic of his poem.Were there hidden garages, hidden car parks?There had to be garages for repair work  or at least equipment swapouts.But maybe there was no other stopping.This was the stuff of both poetry and futurism: Maybe at night when demand fell and they otherwise would have to sleep without profit in some empty lot, maybe then they conspired to clump together like Japanese transformer toys to become freight trucks hauling cargo that was too big for UP/Express.In any case, the old parking lots on the north side of campus were gone, replaced by gaming fields and house of cards style office buildings.Robert had the car drop him at the edge of the old campus, near where Applied Physics and Math used to be."Nothing looks the same, even where there were buildings before. "In fact, there seemed to be more open space than he remembered from the seventies."Don't worry about it, Professor. "Sharif was still audio only.It sounded as if he were reading from a brochure: "UCSD is an unusual campus, less traditional than any other in the UC system.Most of the buildings were rebuilt after the Rose Canyon earthquake.Here's the official view. "Suddenly the buildings were sturdy, reinforced concrete, much as he remembered.Robert waved the fakery away, a gesture Juan had showed him early on."Hands off the main view, Mr.Sharif. ""Sorry. "Robert walked eastward across campus, sampling the ambience.On the gaming fields, there was just as much rushing around as in the 1970s, half a dozen separate games of touch football and soccer.Robert had never participated in those, but one thing he'd admired about UCSD was that the students played sports that were semi pro spectator events at other schools.Up close well, the people he passed looked ordinary enough.There were the familiar backpacks, with the handles of tennis rackets sticking out the top like assault rifles.Many people were talking to themselves, sometimes gesturing into the empty air, or jabbing fingers at unseen antagonists.Nothing new in that; cellphone addicts had always been one of Robert's pet peeves.But these folks were more blatant about it than the kids at Fairmont High.There was something foolish about a fellow walking along, suddenly stopping to tap at his belt, and then talking to the air.The new, numerate Robert couldn't resist keeping count of what he saw  and he soon noticed something the old Robert might not have: There were many college age kids running around, but there were too many old people.One person in ten looked really old, old as Robert truly was.One in three were lean and spry, the twentieth century cliche of "active senior citizens. "And some it took him a while to spot the few where modern medicine was all on target.Their skin was firm and their stride was strong; they almost looked young.Then the most encouraging sight of all: a pair of old duffers coming his way  and both of them carrying books!Robert felt like grabbing their free hands and dancing a jig.Instead he gave them a broad grin as they walked by.Sharif agreed that stepping into an ordinary building  or even the campus bookstore  wouldn't be an effective way to find real books."The university library is your best bet, Professor. "Robert walked down a gentle slope.The eucalyptus grove was more overgrown than he remembered.The dry crowns rustled in the breeze above.The debris of bark and twigs and branches crunched under his feet.Somewhere ahead of him, a choir sang.Then, through the trees, he saw the Geisel Library.Unchanged after all the years!Well, the pillared supports were covered with ivy  but there was nothing virtual about it.He walked out from under the trees and stared.Sharif's voice popped up, "Professor, if you'll bear to the right, the sidewalk goes to the main  "  That was the way Robert remembered, but he hesitated when the other's voice dropped away."Yes?""Oops, heh.Just detour around to the left.There's a mob of singers blocking the main entrance. ""Okay.What is all the singing about, anyway?"Sharif made no reply.Robert shrugged and followed his invisible guide's suggestion, walking around the north side of the building, down to what had been a lower level parking lot.From here the library towered above him.He remembered when it was built, the criticisms: "It's an expensive white elephant,"  "We've been hijacked by space cadets. "In fact, it did look like something brought down from outer space: the six aboveground stories formed a huge octahedron, touching ground on one vertex and clasped by fifty foot pillars.In Robert's time, the structure had been concrete and sweeping glass.Now the vines extended past the fifth story, obscuring the concrete.The library still looked like it came from heaven, but now it was an ancient gem mountain, and the clasp was the green of a supporting earth.The singers were louder.It sounded as if they were singing "La Marseillaise. "But there were also chants that sounded like a good old fashioned student protest.He was well under the overhang now.He had to look straight up to see the undersides of the fourth, fifth, and sixth floors, to see where the concrete finally emerged from the ivy.Strange.The edges of each floor were straight as ever, but the concrete was laced with irregular lighter lines.In the sunlight those lines glinted like silver wedged in stonework."Sharif?"No answer.I should look up the explanation .Juan Orozco could do such searches almost without thinking.Then he smiled: the silvery crack lines were a kind of playful mystery  and that might be their explanation.UCSD had a tradition of weird and wonderful campus art.Robert started toward the short stairway that led to a loading dock.This looked like the most direct way into the library.There was a faded au thorized staff only sign painted on the wall.The freight door was rolled down shut, but a second, smaller door was ajar.From within he could hear some kind of power saw  carpentry?He remembered what Juan had said about getting Epiphany's default local views.He waggled his hand tentatively.Nothing.He gestured again, a little differently: Oops .The loading dock was plastered with keep out signs.He glanced up the hillside; somewhere beyond the crest would be the main entrance.Epiphany showed him a mauve nimbus pulsating in time with the singing.Words floated above the music "A has la Bibleotome !""Down with the Librareome Project!"Now that he was hearing both real and remote voices, the music was close to cacophony."What's going on, Sharif?"This time there was an answer: "It's just another student protest.You'd never get in through the front door. "He stood still for a moment, filled with mild curiosity about what students demonstrated against nowadays.No matter .He could look that up later.He stepped nearer the half opened door, looked down a dimly lit hallway.Despite the phantasmic storm of warnings and rules, he saw no obstacle to free passage.But now the strange sound was louder than the choir: rough, tearing growls spaced by silence.Robert stepped through the doorway.12    Guardians of the Past, Handmaidens of the Future  From its beginning, the Elder Cabal had met on the sixth floor of the Geisel Library.Winston Blount, calling in favors from his years at Arts and Letters, had made that possible.For a while, he had even had a nice clubroom in the staff lounge up here.That had been after the Rose Canyon quake, when the bright young future freaks had been briefly leery of their own technological fixes and floor space was available to those willing to risk the heights.In the first years, there were almost thirty regulars.The membership had changed from year to year, but they were mostly faculty and staff from the turn of the century, almost all retired or laid off.Time passed and the cabal dwindled.Blount himself had drifted away from the group, discovering that there weren't many more favors left for him to call in.His plans for a resumed career had centered on the Fairmont Adult Ed program.Then the Orozco boy had unintentionally pointed him at a magnificent shortcut: the Librareome protest movement.And the inner circle of the cabal was perfect for that.Perhaps it was just as well that the inner circle was exactly the cabal's entire remaining membership.Tom Parker was sitting right beside the window wall.He and Blount peered down upon the protesters.Parker chuckled."So, Dean, are you going to preach to the choir?"Blount grunted."No.But they can see us up here.Give the folks a wave, Tommie. "Blount followed his own advice, raising his arms in a kind of blessing upon the singers at the main entrance and the slightly smaller mob on the terrace by the Snake Path.In fact, he had offered to speak at the demonstration.In the old days he would have been a featured speaker.Now he was still a critical player, but of zero publicity value.He flickered through some of the images that glowed above the crowd."My, this event is big.Layered in fact. "But some of the layers were counterdemonstrations, obscene ghosts that capered through the crowd to mock them.Damn them .He turned off all enhancements, and noticed that Parker was grinning at him."Still trying to use those contact lenses, aren't you Dean?"He patted his laptop computer lovingly."It just goes to show, you can't beat the genius of a mouse and windows environment. "Parker's hands slid across the keyboard.He was working through the layers of enhancement that Blount had been seeing directly with his contacts.Tom Parker might be the sharpest fellow left in the cabal, but he was hopelessly fixated on old ways."I've customized my laptop to pick out what's really important. "Images flickered on his tiny screen.There were things Winston Blount had not noticed in his contacts: someone had set a kind of nimbus over the demonstrators.Impressive.Tommie was still chuckling."I can't tell about that purple halo.Is it supposed to be pro or anti Librareome?"On the other side of Parker, Carlos Rivera leaned back from the window and stretched."Anti, according to the journalists.
