The first one was on my back  I think that shell doesnt fit right, gets creases.Maybe youve lost weight.Wise guy.Our caloric intake had been rigorously monitored ever since we left Stargate the first time.You cant use a fighting suit unless it fits you like a second skin.A wall speaker drowned out the rest of her comment.Attention all personnel.Attention.All army personnel echelon six and above and all navy personnel echelon four and above will report to the briefing room at 2130.It repeated the message twice.I went off to lie down for a few minutes while Marygay showed her bruise to the medic and the armorer.I didnt feel a bit jealous.The Commodore began the briefing.Theres not much to tell, and what there is, is not good news.Six days ago, the Tauran vessel that is pursuing us released a drone missile.Its initial acceleration was on the order of 80 gravities.After blasting for approximately a day, its acceleration suddenly jumped to 148 gravities.Collective gasp.Yesterday, it jumped to 203 gravities.I shouldnt need to remind anyone here that this is twice the accelerative capability of the enemys drones in our last encounter.We launched a salvo of drones, four of them, intersecting what the computer predicted to be the four most probable future trajectories of the enemy drone.One of them paid off, while we were doing evasive maneuvers.We contacted and destroyed the Tauran weapon about ten million kilometers from here.That was practically next door.The only encouraging thing we learned from the encounter was from spectral analysis of the blast.It was no more powerful an explosion than ones we have observed in the past, so at least their progress in propulsion hasnt been matched by progress in explosives.This is the first manifestation of a very important effect that has heretofore been of interest only to theorists.Tell me, soldier.He pointed at Negulesco.How long has it been since we first fought the Taurans, at Aleph?That depends on your frame of reference, Commodore, she answered dutifully.To me, its been about eight months.Exactly.Youve lost about nine years, though, to time dilation, while we maneuvered between collapsar jumps.In an engineering sense, as we havent done any important research and development aboard ship  that enemy vessel comes from our future!He paused to let that sink in.As the war progresses, this can only become more and more pronounced.The Taurans dont have any cure for relativity, of course, so it will be to our benefit as often as to theirs.For the present, though, it is we who are operating with a handicap.As the Tauran pursuit vessel draws closer, this handicap will become more severe.They can simply outshoot us.Were going to have to do some fancy dodging.When we get within five hundred million kilometers of the enemy ship, everybody gets in his shell and we just have to trust the logistic computer.It will put us through a rapid series of random changes in direction and velocity.Ill be blunt.As long as they have one more drone than we, they can finish us off.They havent launched any more since that first one.Perhaps they are holding their fire  or maybe they only had one.In that case, its we who have them.At any rate, all personnel will be required to be in their shells with no more than ten minutes notice.When we get within a thousand million kilometers of the enemy, you are to stand by your shells.By the time we are within five hundred million kilometers, you will be in them, and all shell compounds flooded and pressurized.We cannot wait for anyone.Thats all I have to say.Sub major?Ill speak to my people later, Commodore.Thank you.Dismissed.And none of this fuck you, sir nonsense.The navy thought that was just a little beneath their dignity.We stood at attention  all except Stott  until he had left the room.Then some other swabbie said dismissed again, and we left.My squad had clean up detail, so I told everybody who was to do what, put Tate in charge, and left.Went up to the NCO room for some company and maybe some information.There wasnt much happening but idle speculation, so I took Rogers and went off to bed.Marygay had disappeared again, hopefully trying to wheedle something out of Singhe.3  We had our promised get together with the sub major the next morning, when he more or less repeated what the commodore had said, in infantry terms and in his staccato monotone.He emphasized the fact that all we knew about the Tauran ground forces was that if their naval capability was improved, it was likely they would be able to handle us better than last time.But that brings up an interesting point.Eight months or nine years before, wed had a tremendous advantage: they had seemed not quite to understand what was going on.As belligerent as they had been in space, wed expected them to be real Huns on the ground.Instead, they practically lined themselves up for slaughter.One escaped and presumably described the idea of old fashioned in fighting to his fellows.But that, of course, didnt mean that the word had necessarily gotten to this particular bunch, the Taurans guarding Yod 4.The only way we know of to communicate faster than the speed of light is to physically carry a message through successive collapsar jumps.And there was no way of telling how many jumps there were between Yod 4 and the Tauran home base  so these might be just as passive as the last bunch, or might have been practicing infantry tactics for most of a decade.We would find out when we got there.The armorer and I were helping my squad pull maintenance on their fighting suits when we passed the thousand million kilometer mark and had to go up to the shells.We had about five hours to kill before we had to get into our cocoons.I played a game of chess with Rabi and lost.Then Rogers led the platoon in some vigorous calisthenics, probably for no other reason than to get their minds off the prospect of having to lie halfcrushed in the shells for at least four hours.The longest wed gone before was half that.Ten minutes before the five hundred million kilometer mark, we squad leaders took over and supervised buttoning everybody up.In eight minutes we were zipped and flooded and at the mercy of  or safe in the arms of  the logistic computer.While I was lying there being squeezed, a silly thought took hold of my brain and went round and round like a charge in a superconductor: according to military formalism, the conduct of war divides neatly into two categories, tactics and logistics.Logistics has to do with moving troops and feeding them and just about everything except the actual fighting, which is tactics.And now were fighting, but we dont have a tactical computer to guide us through attack and defense, just a huge, super efficient pacifistic cybernetic grocery clerk of a logistic, mark that word, logistic computer.The other side of my brain, perhaps not quite as pinched, would argue that it doesnt matter what name you give to a computer, its a pile of memory crystals, logic banks, nuts and bolts  If you program it to be Ghengis Khan, it is a tactical computer, even if its usual function is to monitor the stock market or control sewage conversion.But the other voice was obdurate and said by that kind of reasoning, a man is only a hank of hair and a piece of bone and some stringy meat; and no matter what kind of a man he is, if you teach him well, you can take a Zen monk and turn him into a slavering bloodthirsty warrior.Then what the hell are you, we, am I, answered the other side.A peace loving, vacuum welding specialist cum physics teacher snatched up by the Elite Conscription Act and reprogrammed to be a killing machine.You, I have killed and liked it.But that was hypnotism, motivational conditioning, I argued back at myself.They dont do that anymore.And the only reason, I said, they dont do it is that they think youll kill better without it.Thats logic.Speaking of logic, the original question was, why do they send a logistic computer to do a mans job?Or something like that  and we were off again.The light blinked green and I chinned the switch automatically.The pressure was down to 1.3 before I realized that it meant we were alive, we had won the first skirmish.I was only partly right.4  I was belting on my tunic when my ring tingled and I held it up to listen.It was Rogers.Mandella, go check squad bay 3.Something went wrong; Dalton had to depressurize it from Control.Bay 3  that was Marygays squad!I rushed down the corridor in bare feet and got there just as they opened the door from inside the pressure chamber and began straggling out.The first out was Bergman.I grabbed his arm.What the hell is going on, Bergman?Huh?He peered at me, still dazed, as everyone is when they come out of the chamber.Oh, syou.Mandella.I dunno.Whadya mean?I squinted in through the door, still holding on to him.You were late, man, you depressurized late.What happened?He shook his head, trying to clear it.Late?Whad late.Uh, how late?I looked at my watch for the first time.Not too Jesus Christ.Uh, we zipped in at 0520, didnt we?Yeah, I think thats it.Still no Marygay among the dim figures picking their way through the ranked couches and jumbled tubing.Um, you were only a couple of minutes late  but we were only supposed to be under for four hours, maybe less.Its 1050.Um.He shook his head again.I let go of him and stood back to let Stiller and Demy through the door.Everybodys late, then, Bergman said.So we arent in any trouble.Uh Non sequiturs.Right, right  Hey, Stiller!You seen  From inside: Medic!MEDIC!Somebody who wasnt Marygay was coming out.I pushed her roughly out of my way and dove through the door, landed on somebody else and clambered over to where Struve, Marygays assistant, was standing over a pod and talking very loud and fast into his ring.and blood God yes we need  It was Marygay still lying in her suit she was   got the word from Dalton  covered every square inch of her with a uniform bright sheen of blood  when she didnt come out  it started as an angry welt up by her collarbone and was just a welt as it traveled between her breasts until it passed the sternums support  I came over and popped the  and opened up into a cut that got deeper as it ran down over her belly and where it stopped.yeah, shes still  a few centimeters above the pubis a membraned loop of gut was protruding   OK, left hip.Mandella  She was still alive, her heart palpitating, but her bloodstreaked head lolled limply, eyes rolled back to white slits, bubbles of red froth appearing and popping at the corner of her mouth each time she exhaled shallowly.tattooed on her left hip.Mandella!Snap out of it!Reach under her and find out what her blood  TYPE O RH NEGATIVE GOD damn  it.Sorry Oh negative.Hadnt I seen that tattoo ten thousand times?Struve passed this information on and I suddenly remembered the first aid kit on my belt, snapped it off and fumbled through it.Stop the bleeding  protect the wound  treat for shock, thats what the book said.Forgot one, forgot one  clear air passages.She was breathing, if thats what they meant.How do you stop the bleeding or protect the wound with one measly pressure bandage when the wound is nearly a meter long?Treat for shock, that I could do.I fished out the green ampoule, laid it against her arm and pushed the button.Then I laid the sterile side of the bandage gently on top of the exposed intestine and passed the elastic strip under the small of her back, adjusted it for nearly zero tension and fastened it.Anything else you can do?Struve asked.I stood back and felt helpless.I dont know.Can you think of anything?Im no more of a medic than you are.Looking up at the door, he kneaded a fist, biceps straining.Where the hell are they?You have morph plex in that kit?Yeah, but somebody told me not to use it for Internal  William?Her eyes were open and she was trying to lift her head.I rushed over and held her.Itll be all right, Marygay.The medics coming.What  all right?Im thirsty.Water.No, honey, you cant have any water.Not for a while, anyhow.Not if she was headed for surgery.Why is all the blood?she said in a small voice.Her head rolled back.Been a bad girl.It must have been the suit, I said rapidly.Remember earlier, the creases?She shook her head.Suit?She turned suddenly paler and retched weakly.Water  William, please.Authoritative voice behind me: Get a sponge or a cloth soaked in water.I looked around and saw Doc Wilson with two stretcher bearers.First half liter femoral, he said to no one in particular as he carefully peeked under the pressure bandage.Follow that relief tube down a couple of meters and pinch it off.Find out if shes passed any blood.One of the medics ran a ten centimeter needle into Marygays thigh and started giving her whole blood from a plastic bag.Sorry Im late, Doc Wilson said tiredly.Business is booming.Whatd you say about the suit?She had two minor injuries before.Suit doesnt fit quite right, creases up under pressure.He nodded absently, checking her blood pressure.You, anybody, give Somebody handed him a paper towel dripping water.Uh, give her any medication?One ampoule of No shock.He wadded the paper towel up loosely and put it in Marygays hand.Whats her name?I told him.Marygay, we cant give you a drink of water but you can suck on this.Now Im going to shine a bright light in your eye.While he was looking through her pupil with a metal tube, he said, Temperature?and one of the medics read a number from a digital readout box and withdrew a probe.Passed blood?Yes.Some.He put his hand lightly on the pressure bandage.Marygay, can you roll over a little on your right side?Yes, she said slowly, and put her elbow down for leverage.No, she said and started crying.Now, now, he said absently and pushed up on her hip just enough to be able to see her back.Only the one wound, he muttered.Hell of a lot of blood.He pressed the side of his ring twice and shook it by his ear.Anybody up in the shop?Harrison, unless hes on a call.A woman walked up, and at first I didnt recognize her, pale and disheveled, bloodstained tunic.It was Estelle Harmony.Doc Wilson looked up.Any new customers, Doctor Harmony?No, she said dully.The maintenance man was a double traumatic amputation.Only lived a few minutes.Were keeping him running for transplants.All those others?Explosive decompression.She sniffed.Anything I can do here?Yeah, just a minute.He tried his ring again.God damn it.You dont know where Harrison is?No  well, maybe, he might be in Surgery B if there was trouble with the cadaver maintenance.Think I set it up all right, though.Yeah, well, hell you know how  Mark!said the medic with the blood bag.One more half liter femoral, Doc Wilson said.Estelle, you mind taking over for one of the medics here, prepare this gal for surgery?No, keep me busy.Good  Hopkins, go up to the shop and bring down a roller and a liter, uh, two liters isotonic fluorocarb with the primary spectrum.If theyre Merck theyll sayabdominal spectrum.He found a part of his sleeve with no blood on it and wiped his forehead.If you find Harrison, send him over to surgery A and have him set up the anesthetic sequence for abdominal.And bring her up to A?Right.If you cant find Harrison, get somebody he stabbed a finger in, my direction, this guy, to roll the patient up to A; you run ahead and start the sequence.He picked up his bag and looked through it.We could start the sequence here, he muttered.But hell, not with paramethadone.Marygay?How do you feel?She was still crying.Im  hurt.I know, he said gently.He thought for a second and said to Estelle, No way to tell really how much blood she lost.She may have been passing it under pressure.Also theres some pooling in the abdominal cavity.Since shes still alive I dont think she couldve bled under pressure for very long.Hope no brain damage yet.He touched the digital readout attached to Marygays arm.Monitor the blood pressure, and if you think its indicated, give her five ccs vasoconstrictor.Ive gotta go scrub down.He closed his bag.You have any vasoconstrictor besides the pneumatic ampoule?Estelle checked her own bag.No, just the emergency pneumatic  uh  yes, Ive got controlled dosage on the dilator, though.OK, if you have to use the constrictor and her pressure goes up too fast  Ill give her vasodilator two ccs at a time.Check.Hell of a way to run things, but  well.If youre not too tired, Id like you to stand by me upstairs.Sure.Doc Wilson nodded and left.Estelle began sponging Marygays belly with isopropyl alcohol.It smelled cold and clean.Somebody gave her No shock?Yes, I said, about ten minutes ago.Ah.Thats why the Doc was worried  no, you did the right thing.But No shocks got some vasoconstrictor.Five ccs more might run up an overdose.She continued silently scrubbing, her eyes coming up every few seconds to check the blood pressure monitor.William?It was the first time shed shown any sign of knowing me.This wom  uh, Marygay, shes your lover?Your regular lover?Thats right.Shes very pretty.A remarkable observation, her body torn and caked with crusting blood, her face smeared where I had tried to wipe away the tears.I suppose a doctor or a woman or a lover can look beneath that and see beauty.Yes, she is.She had stopped crying and had her eyes squeezed shut, sucking the last bit of moisture from the paper wad.Can she have some more water?OK, same as before.Not too much.I went out to the locker alcove and into the head for a paper towel.Now that the fumes from the pressurizing fluid had cleared, I could smell the air.It smelled wrong.Light machine oil and burnt metal, like the smell of a metalworking shop.I wondered whether they had overloaded the airco.That had happened once before, after the first time wed used the acceleration chambers.Marygay took the water without opening her eyes.Do you plan to stay together when you get back to Earth?Probably, I said.If we get back to Earth.Still one more battle.There wont be any more battles, she said flatly.You mean you havent heard?What?Dont you know the ship was hit?Hit!Then how could any of us be alive?Thats right.She went back to her scrubbing.Four squad bays.Also the armor bay.There isnt a fighting suit left on the ship  and we cant fight in our underwear.What  squad bays, what happened to the people?No survivors.Thirty people.Who was it?All of the third platoon.First squad of the second platoon.Al Sadat, Busia, Maxwell, Negulesco.My God.Thirty deaders, and they dont have the slightest notion of what caused it.Dont know but that it may happen again any minute.It wasnt a drone?No, we got all of their drones.Got the enemy vessel, too.Nothing showed up on any of the sensors, just blam!and a third of the ship was torn to hell.We were lucky it wasnt the drive or the life support system.I was hardly hearing her.Penworth, LaBatt, Smithers.Christine and Frida.All dead.I was numb.She took a blade type razor and a tube of gel out of her bag.Be a gentleman and look the other way, she said.Oh, here.She soaked a square of gauze in alcohol and handed it to me.Be useful.Do her face.I started and, without opening her eyes, Marygay said, That feels good.What are you doing?Being a gentleman.And useful, too  All personnel, attention, all personnel.There wasnt a squawk box in the pressure chamber, but I could hear it clearly through the door to the locker alcove.All personnel echelon 6 and above, unless directly involved in medical or maintenance emergencies, report immediately to the assembly area.Ive got to go, Marygay.She didnt say anything.I didnt know whether she had heard the announcement.Estelle, I addressed her directly, gentleman be damned.Will you  Yes.Ill let you know as soon as we can tell.Well.Its going to be all right.But her expression was grim and worried.Now get going, she said, softly.By the time I picked my way out into the corridor, the box was repeating the message for the fourth time.There was a new smell in the air that I didnt want to identify.5  Halfway to the assembly area I realized what a mess I was, and ducked into the head by the NCO lounge.Corporal Kamehameha was hurriedly brushing her hair.William!What happened to you?Nothing.I turned on a tap and looked at myself in the mirror.Dried blood smeared all over my face and tunic.It was Marygay, Corporal Potter, her suit  well, evidently it got a crease, uh   Dead?No, just badly, uh, shes going into surgery  Dont use hot water.Youll just set the stain.Oh.Right.I used the hot to wash my face and hand, dabbed at the tunic with cold.Your squads just two bays down from Als, isnt it?Yes.Did you see what happened?No.Yes.Not when it happened.For the first time I noticed that she was crying, big tears rolling down her cheeks and off her chin.Her voice was even, controlled.She pulled at her hair savagely.Its a mess.I stepped over and put my hand on her shoulder.DONT touch me!she flared and knocked my hand off with the brush.Sorry.Lets go.At the door to the head she touched me lightly on the arm.William She looked at me defiantly.Im just glad it wasnt me.You understand?Thats the only way you can look at it.I understood, but I didnt know that I believed her.I can sum it up very briefly, the commodore said in a tight voice, if only because we know so little.Some ten seconds after we destroyed the enemy vessel, two objects, very small objects, struck the Anniversary amidships.By inference, since they were not detected and we know the limits of our detection apparatus, we know that they were moving in excess of nine tenths of the speed of light.That is to say, more precisely, their velocity vector normal to the axis of the Anniversary was greater than nine tenths of the speed of light.They slipped in behind the repeller fields.When the Anniversary is moving at relativistic speeds, it is designed to generate two powerful electromagnetic fields, one centered about five thousand kilometers from the ship and the other about ten thousand klicks away, both in line with the direction of motion of the ship.These fields are maintained by a ramjet effect, energy picked up from interstellar gas as we mosey along.Anything big enough to worry about hitting (that is, anything big enough to see with a strong magnifying glass) goes through the first field and comes out with a very strong negative charge all over its surface.As it enters the second field, its repelled away from the path of the ship.If the object is too big to be pushed around this way, we can sense it at a greater distance and maneuver out of its way.I shouldnt have to emphasize how formidable a weapon this is.When the Anniversary was struck, our rate of speed with respect to the enemy was such that we traveled our own length every ten thousandth of a second.Further, we were jerking around erratically with a constantly changing and purely random lateral acceleration.Thus the objects that struck us must have been guided, not aimed.And the guidance system was self contained, since there were no Taurans alive at the time they struck us.All of this in a package no larger than a small pebble.Most of you are too young to remember the term future shock.Back in the seventies, some people felt that technological progress was so rapid that people, normal people, couldnt cope with it; that they wouldnt have time to get used to the present before the future was upon them.A man named Toffler coined the term future shock to describe this situation.The commodore could get pretty academic.Were caught up in a physical situation that resembles this scholarly concept.The result has been disaster.Tragedy.And, as we discussed in our last meeting, there is no way to counter it.Relativity traps us in the enemys past; relativity brings them from our future.We can only hope that next time, the situation will be reversed.And all we can do to help bring that about is try to get back to Stargate, and then to Earth, where specialists may be able to deduce something, some sort of counterweapon, from the nature of the damage.Now we could attack the Taurans portal planet from space and perhaps destroy the base without using you infantry.But I think there would be a very great risk involved.We might be  shot down by whatever hit us today, and never return to Stargate with what I consider to be vital information.We could send a drone with a message detailing our assumptions about this new enemy weapon  but that might be inadequate.And the Force would be that much further behind, technologically.Accordingly, we have set a course that will take us around Yod 4, keeping the collapsar as much as possible between us and the Tauran base.We will avoid contact with the enemy and return to Stargate as quickly as possible.Incredibly, the commodore sat down and kneaded his temples.All of you are at least squad or section leaders.Most of you have good combat records.And I hope that some of you will be rejoining the Force after your two years are up.Those of you who do will probably be made lieutenants, and face your first real command.It is to these people I would like to speak for a few moments, not as your  as one of your commanders, but just as a senior officer and advisor.One cannot make command decisions simply by assessing the tactical situation and going ahead with whatever course of action will do the most harm to the enemy with a minimum of death and damage to your own men and materiel.Modern warfare has become very complex, especially during the last century.Wars are won not by a simple series of battles won, but by a complex interrelationship among military victory, economic pressures, logistic maneuvering, access to the enemys information, political postures  dozens, literally dozens of factors.I was hearing this, but the only thing that was getting through to my brain was that a third of our friends lives had been snuffed out less than an hour before, and he was sitting up there giving us a lecture on military theory.So sometimes you have to throw away a battle in order to help win the war.This is exactly what we are going to do.This was not an easy decision.In fact, it was probably the hardest decision of my military career.Because, on the surface at least, it may look like cowardice.The logistic computer calculates that we have about a 62 percent chance of success, should we attempt to destroy the enemy base.Unfortunately, we would have only a 30 percent chance of survival some of the scenarios leading to success involve ramming the portal planet with the Anniversary at light speed.Jesus Christ.I hope none of you ever has to face such a decision.When we get back to Stargate, I will in all probability be court martialed for cowardice under fire.But I honestly believe that the information that may be gained from analysis of the damage to the Anniversary is more important than the destruction of this one Tauran base.He sat up straight.More important than one soldiers career.I had to stifle an impulse to laugh.Surely cowardice had nothing to do with his decision.Surely he had nothing so primitive and unmilitary as a will to live.The maintenance crew managed to patch up the huge rip in the side of the Anniversary and to repressurize that section.We spent the rest of the day cleaning up the area; without, of course, disturbing any of the precious evidence for which the commodore was willing to sacrifice his career.The hardest part was jettisoning the bodies.It wasnt so bad except for the ones whose suits had burst.I went to Estelles cabin the next day, as soon as she was off duty.It wouldnt serve any good purpose for you to see her now.Estelle sipped her drink, a mixture of ethyl alcohol, citric acid and water, with a drop of some ester that approximated the aroma of orange rind.Is she out of danger?Not for a couple of weeks.Let me explain.She set down her drink and rested her chin on interlaced fingers.This sort of injury would be fairly routine under normal circumstances.Having replaced the lost blood, wed simply sprinkle some magic powder into her abdominal cavity and paste her back up.Have her hobbling around in a couple of days.But there are complications.Nobodys ever been injured in a pressure suit before.So far, nothing really unusual has cropped up.But we want to monitor her innards very closely for the next few days.Also, we were very concerned about peritonitis.You know what peritonitis is?Yes.Well, vaguely.Because a part of her intestine had ruptured under pressure.We didnt want to settle for normal prophylaxis because a lot of the, uh, contamination had impacted on the peritoneum under pressure.To play it safe, we completely sterilized the whole shebang, the abdominal cavity and her entire digestive system from the duodenum south.Then, of course, we had to replace all of her normal intestinal flora, now dead, with a commercially prepared culture.Still standard procedure, but not normally called for unless the damage is more severe.I see.And it was making me a little queasy.Doctors dont seem to realize that most of us are perfectly content not having to visualize ourselves as animated bags of skin filled with obscene glop.This in itself is enough reason not to see her for a couple of days.The changeover of intestinal flora has a pretty violent effect on the digestive system  not dangerous, since shes under constant observation.But tiring and, well, embarrassing.With all of this, she would be completely out of danger if this were a normal clinical situation.But were decelerating at a constant 1 gees, and her internal organs have gone through a lot of jumbling around.You might as well know that if we do any blasting, anything over about two gees, shes going to die.But  but were bound to go over two on the final approach!What  I know, I know.But that wont be for a couple of weeks.Hopefully, she will have mended by then.William, face it.Its a miracle she survived to get into surgery.So theres a big chance she wont make it back to Earth.Its sad; shes a special person, the special person to you, maybe.But weve had so much death  you ought to be getting used to it, come to terms with it.I took a long pull at my drink, identical to hers except for the citric acid.Youre getting pretty hard boiled.Maybe  no.Just realistic.I have a feeling were headed for a lot more death and sorrow.Not me.As soon as we get to Stargate, Im a civilian.Dont be so sure.The old familiar argument.Those clowns who signed us up for two years can just as easily make it four or  Or six or twenty or the duration.But they wont.It would be mutiny.I dont know.If they could condition us to kill on cue, they can condition us to do almost anything.Re enlist.That was a chiller.Later on we tried to make love, but both of us had too much to think about.I got to see Marygay for the first time about a week later.She was wan, had lost a lot of weight and seemed very confused.Doc Wilson assured me that it was just the medication; they hadnt seen any evidence of brain damage.She was still in bed, still being fed through a tube.I began to get very nervous about the calendar.Every day there seemed to be some improvement, but if she was still in bed when we hit that collapsar push, she wouldnt have a chance.I couldnt get any encouragement from Doc Wilson or Estelle; they said it depended on Marygays resilience.The day before the push, they transferred her forward to Estelles acceleration couch in the infirmary.In her bed lucid and was taking food orally, but she still couldnt move under her own power, not at 1 gees.I went to see her.Heard about the course change?We have to go through Aleph 9 to get back to Tet 38.Four more months on this damn hulk.But another six years combat pay when we get back to Earth.Thats good.Ah, just think of the great things well  William.I let it trail off.Never could lie.Dont try to jolly me.Tell me about vacuum welding, about your childhood, anything.Just dont bullshit me about getting back to Earth.She turned her face to the wall.I heard the doctors talking out in the corridor, one morning when they thought I was asleep.But it just confirmed what I already knew, the way everybodyd been moping around.So tell me, you were born in New Mexico in 1975.What then?Did you stay in New Mexico?Were you bright in school?Have any friends, or were you too bright like me?How old were you when you first got sacked?We talked in this vein for a while, uncomfortable.An idea came to me while we were rambling, and when I left Marygay I went straight to Dr.Wilson.Were giving her a fifty fifty chance, but thats pretty arbitrary.None of the published data on this sort of thing really fits.But it is safe to say that her chances of survival are better, the less acceleration she has to endure.Certainly.For what its worth.The commodores going to take it as gently as possible, but thatll still be four or five gees.Three might even be too much; we wont know until its over.I nodded impatiently.Yes, but I think theres a way to expose her to less acceleration than the rest of us.If youve developed an acceleration shield, he said smiling, you better hurry and file a patent.You could sell it for a considerable  No, Doc, it wouldnt be worth much under normal conditions; our shells work better and they evolved from the same principles.Explain away.We put Marygay into a shell and flood  Wait, wait.Absolutely not.A poorly fitting shell was what caused this in the first place.And this time, shed have to use somebody elses.I know, Doc, let me explain.It doesnt have to fit her exactly as long as the life support hookups can function.The shell wont be pressurized on the inside; it wont have to be because she wont be subjected to those thousands of kilograms per square centimeter pressure from the fluid outside.Im not sure I follow.Its just an adaptation of  youve studied physics, havent you?A little bit, in medical school.My worst courses, after Latin.Do you remember the principle of equivalence?I remember there was something by that name.Something to do with relativity, right?Uh huh.It means that  theres no difference being in a gravitational field and being in an equivalent accelerated frame of  it means that when the Anniversary is blasting five gees, the effect on us is the same as if it were sitting on its tail on a big planet, on one with five gees surface gravity.Seems obvious.Maybe it is.It means that theres no experiment you could perform on the ship that could tell you whether you were blasting or just sitting on a big planet.Sure there is.You could turn off the engines, and if  Or you could look outside, sure; I mean isolated, physics lab type experiments.All right.Ill accept that.So?You know Archimedes Law?Sure, the fake crown  thats what always got me about physics, they make a big to do about obvious things, and when it gets to the rough parts  Archimedes Law says that when you immerse something in a fluid, its buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces.Thats reasonable.And that holds, no matter what kind of gravitation or acceleration youre in.In a ship blasting at five gees, the water displaced, if its water, weighs five times as much as regular water, at one gee.Sure.So if you float somebody in the middle of a tank of water, so that shes weightless, shell still be weightless when the ship is doing five gees.Hold on, son.You had me going there, but it wont work.Why not?I was tempted to tell him to stick to his pills and stethoscopes and let me handle the physics, but it was a good thing I didnt.What happens when you drop a wrench in a submarine?Submarine?Thats right.They work by Archimedes  Ouch!Youre right.Jesus.Hadnt thought it through.That wrench falls right to the floor just as if the submarine werent weightless.He looked off into space, tapping a pencil on the desk.What you describe is similar to the way we treat patients with severe skin damage, like burns, on Earth.But it doesnt give any support to the internal organs, the way the acceleration shells do, so it wouldnt do Marygay any good  I stood up to go.Sorry I wasted  Hold on there, though, just a minute.We might be able to use your idea part way.How do you mean?I wasnt thinking it through, either.The way we normally use the shells is out of the question for Marygay, of course.I didnt like to think about it.Takes a lot of hypno conditioning to lie there and have oxygenated fluorocarbon forced into every natural body orifice and one artificial one.I fingered the valve fitting imbedded above my hipbone.Yeah, thats obvious, itd tear her  say  you mean, low pressure  Thats right.We wouldnt need thousands of atmospheres to protect her against five gees straight line acceleration; thats only for all the swerving and dodging  Im going to call Maintenance.Get down to your squad bay; thats the one well use.Daltonll meet you there.Five minutes before injection into the collapsar field, and I started the flooding sequence.
