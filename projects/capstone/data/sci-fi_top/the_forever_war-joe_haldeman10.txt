It had been some time since Id done any delicate work in a suit.I remembered how in training, theyd made us practice controlling the strength amplification circuits by passing eggs from person to person, messy business.I wondered if they still had eggs on Earth.The diagram completed, I couldnt see any way to add to it.All those reams of theory crammed in my brain; there was plenty of tactical advice about envelopment and encirclement, but from the wrong point of view.If you were the one who was being encircled, you didnt have many options.Sit tight and fight.Respond quickly to enemy concentrations of force, but stay flexible so the enemy cant employ a diversionary force to divert strength from some predictable section of your perimeter.Make full use of air and space support, always good advice.Keep your head down and your chin up and pray for the cavalry.Hold your position and dont contemplate Dienbienphu, the Alamo, the Battle of Hastings.Eight more carriers out, Charlie said Five minutes.Until the first eight get here.So they were going to attack in two waves.At least two.What would I do, in the Tauran commanders position?That wasnt too farfetched; the Taurans lacked imagination in tactics and tended to copy human patterns.The first wave could be a throwaway, a kamikaze attack to soften us up and evaluate our defenses.Then the second would come in more methodically, and finish the job.Or vice versa: the first group would have twenty minutes to get entrenched; then the second could skip over their heads and hit us hard at one spot breach the perimeter and overrun the base.Or maybe they sent out two forces simply because two was a magic number.Or they could launch only eight troop carriers at a time (that would be bad, implying that the carriers were large; in different situations they had used carriers holding as few as 4 troops or as many as 128).Three minutes.I stared at the cluster of monitors that showed various sectors of the mine field.If we were lucky, theyd land out there, out of caution.Or maybe pass over it low enough to detonate mines.I was feeling vaguely guilty.I was safe in my hole, doodling, ready to start calling out orders.How did those seventy sacrificial lambs feel about their absentee commander?Then I remembered how I had felt about Captain Stott that first mission, when hed elected to stay safely in orbit while we fought on the ground.The rush of remembered hate was so strong I had to bite back nausea.Hilleboe, can you handle the lasers by yourself?I dont see why not, sir.I tossed down the pen and stood up.Charlie, you take over the unit coordination; you can do it as well as I could.Im going topside.I wouldnt advise that, sir.Hell no, William.Dont be an idiot.Im not taking orders, Im giv  You wouldnt last ten seconds up there, Charlie said.Ill take the same chance as everybody else.Dont you hear what Im saying.Theyll kill you!The troops?Nonsense.I know they dont like me especially, but  You havent listened in on the squad frequencies?No, they didnt speak my brand of English when they talked among themselves.They think you put them out on the line for punishment, for cowardice.After youd told them anyone was free to go into the dome.Didnt you, sir?Hilleboe said.To punish them?No, of course not.Not consciously.They were just up there when I needed  Hasnt Lieutenant Brill said anything  to them?Not that Ive heard, Charlie said.Maybe shes been too busy to tune in.Or she agreed with them.Id better get  There!Hilleboe shouted.The first enemy ship was visible in one of the mine field monitors; the others appeared in the next second.They came in from random directions and werent evenly distributed around the base.Five in the northeast quadrant and only one in the southwest.I relayed the information to Brill.But we had predicted their logic pretty well; all of them were coming down in the ring of mines.One came close enough to one of the tachyon devices to set it off.The blast caught the rear end of the oddly streamlined craft, causing it to make a complete flip and crash nose first.Side ports opened up and Taurans came crawling out.Twelve of them; probably four left inside.If all the others had sixteen as well, there were only slightly more of them than of us.In the first wave.The other seven had landed without incident, and yes, there were sixteen each.Brill shuffled a couple of squads to conform to the enemys troop concentration, and she waited.They moved fast across the mine field, striding in unison like bowlegged, top heavy robots, not even breaking stride when one of them was blown to bits by a mine, which happened eleven times.When they came over the horizon, the reason for their apparently random distribution was obvious: they had analyzed beforehand which approaches would give them the most natural cover, from the rubble that the drones had kicked up.They would be able to get within a couple of kilometers of the base before we got any clear line of sight of them.And their suits had augmentation circuits similar to ours, so they could cover a kilometer in less than a minute.Brill had her troops open fire immediately, probably more for morale than out of any hope of actually hitting the enemy.They probably were getting a few, though it was hard to tell.At least the tachyon rockets did an impressive job of turning boulders into gravel.The Taurans returned fire with some weapon similar to the tachyon rocket, maybe exactly the same.They rarely found a mark, though; our people were at and below ground level, and if the rocket didnt hit something, it would keep going on forever, amen.They did score a hit on one of the gigawatt lasers, though, and the concussion that filtered down to us was strong enough to make me wish we had burrowed a little deeper than twenty meters.The gigawatts werent doing us any good.The Taurans must have figured out the lines of sight ahead of time, and gave them wide berth.That turned out to be fortunate, because it caused Charlie to let his attention wander from the laser monitors for a moment.What the hell?Whats that, Charlie?I didnt take my eyes off the monitors.Waiting for something to happen.The ship, the cruiser  its gone.I looked at the holograph display.He was right; the only red lights were those that stood for the troop carriers.Where did it go?I asked inanely.Lets play it back.He programmed the display to go back a couple of minutes and cranked out the scale to where both planet and collapsar showed on the cube.The cruiser showed up, and with it, three green dots.Our coward, attacking the cruiser with only two drones.But he had a little help from the laws of physics.Instead of going into collapsar insertion, he had skimmed around the collapsar field in a slingshot orbit.He had come out going nine tenths of the speed of light; the drones were going .99c, headed straight for the enemy cruiser.Our planet was about a thousand light seconds from the collapsar, so the Tauran ship had only ten seconds to detect and stop both drones.And at that speed, it didnt matter whether youd been hit by a nova bomb or a spitball.The first drone disintegrated the cruiser, and the other one, .01 second behind, glided on down to impact on the planet.The fighter missed the planet by a couple of hundred kilometers and hurtled on into space, decelerating with the maximum twenty five gees.Hed be back in a couple of months.But the Taurans werent going to wait.They were getting close enough to our lines for both sides to start using lasers, but they were also within easy grenade range.A good size rock could shield them from laser fire, but the grenades and rockets were slaughtering them.At first, Brills troops had the overwhelming advantage; fighting from ditches, they could only be harmed by an occasional lucky shot or an extremely well aimed grenade (which the Taurans threw by hand, with a range of several hundred meters).Brill had lost four, but it looked as if the Tauran force was down to less than half its original size.Eventually, the landscape had been torn up enough so that the bulk of the Tauran force was able to fight from holes in the ground.The fighting slowed down to individual laser duels, punctuated occasionally by heavier weapons.But it wasnt smart to use up a tachyon rocket against a single Tauran, not with another force of unknown size only a few minutes away.Something had been bothering me about that holographic replay.Now, with the battles lull, I knew what it was.When that second drone crashed at near lightspeed, how much damage had it done to the planet?I stepped over to the computer and punched it up; found out how much energy had been released in the collision, and then compared it with geological information in the computers memory.Twenty times as much energy as the most powerful earthquake ever recorded.On a planet three quarters the size of Earth.On the general frequency: Everybody  topside!Right now!I palmed the button that would cycle and open the airlock and tunnel that led from Administration to the surface.What the hell, Will  Earthquake!How long?Move!Hilleboe and Charlie were right behind me.The cat was sitting on my desk, licking himself unconcernedly I had an irrational impulse to put him inside my suit, which was the way hed been carried from the ship to the base, but knew he wouldnt tolerate more than a few minutes of it.Then I had the more reasonable impulse to simply vaporize him with my laser finger, but by then the door was closed and we were swarming up the ladder.All the way up, and for some time afterward, I was haunted by the image of that helpless animal, trapped under tons of rubble, dying slowly as the air hissed away.Safer in the ditches?Charlie said.I dont know, I said.Never been in an earthquake.Maybe the walls of the ditch would close up and crush us.I was surprised at how dark it was on the surface.S Doradus had almost set; the monitors had compensated for the low light level.An enemy laser raked across the clearing to our left, making a quick shower of sparks when it flicked by a gigawatt mounting.We hadnt been seen yet.We all decided yes, it would be safer in the ditches, and made it to the nearest one in three strides.There were four men and women in the ditch, one of them badly wounded or dead.We scrambled down the ledge and I turned up my image amplifier to log two, to inspect our ditch mates.We were lucky; one was a grenadier and they also had a rocket launcher.I could just make out the names on their helmets.We were in Brills ditch, but she hadnt noticed us yet.She was at the opposite end, cautiously peering over the edge, directing two squads in a flanking movement.When they were safely in position, she ducked back down.Is that you, Major?Thats right, I said cautiously.I wondered whether any of the people in the ditch were among the ones after my scalp.Whats this about an earthquake?She had been told about the cruiser being destroyed, but not about the other drone.I explained in as few words as possible.Nobodys come out of the airlock, she said.Not yet.I guess they all went into the stasis field.Yeah, they were just as close to one as the other.Maybe some of them were still down below, hadnt taken my warning seriously.I chinned the general frequency to check, and then all hell broke loose.The ground dropped away and then flexed back up; slammed us so hard that we were airborne, tumbling out of the ditch.We flew several meters, going high enough to see the pattern of bright orange and yellow ovals, the craters where nova bombs had been stopped.I landed on my feet but the ground was shifting and slithering so much that it was impossible to stay upright.With a basso grinding I could feel through my suit, the cleared area above our base crumbled and fell in.Part of the stasis fields underside was exposed when the ground subsided; it settled to its new level with aloof grace.Well, minus one cat.I hoped everybody else had time and sense enough to get under the dome.A figure came staggering out of the ditch nearest to me and I realized with a start that it wasnt human.At that range, my laser burned a hole straight through his helmet; he took two steps and fell over backward.Another helmet peered over the edge of the ditch.I sheared the top of it off before he could raise his weapon.I couldnt get my bearings.The only thing that hadnt changed was the stasis dome, and it looked the same from any angle.The gigawatt lasers were all buried, but one of them had switched on, a brilliant flickering searchlight that illuminated a swirling cloud of vaporized rock.Obviously, though, I was in enemy territory.I started across the trembling ground toward the dome.I couldnt raise any platoon leaders.All of them but Brill were probably inside the dome.I did get Hilleboe and Charlie; told Hilleboe to go inside the dome and roust everybody out.If the next wave also had 128, we were going to need everybody.The tremors died down and I found my way into a friendly ditch  the cooks ditch, in fact, since the only people there were Orban and Rudkoski.Looks like youll have to start from scratch again, Private.Thats all right, sir.Liver needed a rest.I got a beep from Hilleboe and chinned her on.Sir  there were only ten people there.The rest didnt make it.They stayed behind?Seemed like theyd had plenty of time.I dont know, sir.Never mind.Get me a count, how many people we have, all totaled.I tried the platoon leaders frequency again and it was still silent.The three of us watched for enemy laser fire for a couple of minutes, but there was none.Probably waiting for reinforcements.Hilleboe called back.I only get fifty three, sir.Some may be unconscious.All right.Have them sit tight until Then the second wave showed up, the troop carriers roaring over the horizon with their jets pointed our way, decelerating.Get some rockets on those bastards!Hilleboe yelled to everyone in particular.But nobody had managed to stay attached to a rocket launcher while he was being tossed around.No grenade launchers, either, and the range was too far for the hand lasers to do any damage.These carriers were four or five times the size of the ones in the first wave.One of them grounded about a kilometer in front of us, barely stopping long enough to disgorge its troops.Of which there were over 50, probably 64 times 8 made 512.No way we could hold them back.Everybody listen, this is Major Mandella.I tried to keep my voice even and quiet.Were going to retreat back into the dome, quickly but in an orderly way.I know were scattered all over hell.If you belong to the second or fourth platoon, stay put for a minute and give covering fire while the first and third platoons, and support, fall back.First and third and support, fall back to about half your present distance from the dome, then take cover and defend the second and fourth as they come back.Theyll go to the edge of the dome and cover you while you come back the rest of the way.I shouldnt have said retreat; that word wasnt in the book.Retrograde action.There was a lot more retrograde than action.Eight or nine people were firing, and all the rest were in full flight.Rudkoski and Orban had vanished.I took a few carefully aimed shots, to no great effect, then ran down to the other end of the ditch, climbed out and headed for the dome.The Taurans started firing rockets, but most of them seemed to be going too high.I saw two of us get blown away before I got to my halfway point; found a nice big rock and hid behind it.I peeked out and decided that only two or three of the Taurans were close enough to be even remotely possible laser targets, and the better part of valor would be in not drawing unnecessary attention to myself.I ran the rest of the way to the edge of the field and stopped to return fire.After a couple of shots, I realized that I was just making myself a target; as far as I could see there was only one other person who was still running toward the dome.A rocket zipped by, so close I could have touched it.I flexed my knees and kicked, and entered the dome in a rather undignified posture.7  Inside, I could see the rocket that had missed me drifting lazily through the gloom, rising slightly as it passed through to the other side of the dome.It would vaporize the instant it came out the other side, since all of the kinetic energy it had lost in abruptly slowing down to 16.3 meters per second would come back in the form of heat.Nine people were lying dead, facedown just inside of the fields edge.It wasnt unexpected, though it wasnt the sort of thing you were supposed to tell the troops.Their fighting suits were intact  otherwise they wouldnt have made it this far  but sometime during the past few minutes rough and tumble, they had damaged the coating of special insulation that protected them from the stasis field.So as soon as they entered the field, all electrical activity in their bodies ceased, which killed them instantly.Also, since no molecule in their bodies could move faster than 16.3 meters per second, they instantly froze solid, their body temperature stabilized at a cool 0.426 degrees Absolute.I decided not to turn any of them over to find out their names, not yet.We had to get some sort of defensive position worked out before the Taurans came through the dome.If they decided to slug it out rather than wait.With elaborate gestures, I managed to get everybody collected in the center of the field, under the fighters tail, where the weapons were racked.There were plenty of weapons, since we had been prepared to outfit three times this number of people.After giving each person a shield and short sword, I traced a question in the snow: GOOD ARCHERS?RAISE HANDS.I got five volunteers, then picked out three more so that all the bows would be in use.Twenty arrows per bow.They were the most effective long range weapons we had; the arrows were almost invisible in their slow flight, heavily weighted and tipped with a deadly sliver of diamond hard crystal.I arranged the archers in a circle around the fighter (its landing fins would give them partial protection from missiles coming in from behind) and between each pair of archers put four other people: two spear throwers, one quarterstaff, and a person armed with battle ax and a dozen throwing knives.This arrangement would theoretically take care of the enemy at any range, from the edge of the field to hand to hand combat.Actually, at some 600 to 42 odds, they could probably walk in with a rock in each hand, no shields or special weapons, and still beat the shit out of us.Assuming they knew what the stasis field was.Their technology seemed up to date in all other respects.For several hours nothing happened.We got about as bored as anyone could, waiting to die.No one to talk to, nothing to see but the unchanging gray dome, gray snow, gray spaceship and a few identically gray soldiers.Nothing to hear, taste or smell but yourself.Those of us who still had any interest in the battle were keeping watch on the bottom edge of the dome, waiting for the first Taurans to come through.So it took us a second to realize what was going on when the attack did start.It came from above, a cloud of catapulted darts swarming in through the dome some thirty meters above the ground, headed straight for the center of the hemisphere.The shields were big enough that you could hide most of your body behind them by crouching slightly; the people who saw the darts coming could protect themselves easily.The ones who had their backs to the action, or were just asleep at the switch, had to rely on dumb luck for survival; there was no way to shout a warning and it took only three seconds for a missile to get from the edge of the dome to its center.We were lucky, losing only five.One of them was an archer, Shubik.I took over her bow and we waited, expecting a ground attack immediately.It didnt come.After a half hour, I went around the circle and explained with gestures that the first thing you were supposed to do, if anything happened, was to touch the person on your right.Hed do the same, and so on down the line.That might have saved my life.The second dart attack, a couple of hours later, came from behind me.I felt the nudge, slapped the person on my right, turned around and saw the cloud descending.I got the shield over my head, and they hit a split second later.I set down my bow to pluck three darts from the shield and the ground attack started.It was a weird, impressive sight.Some three hundred of them stepped into the field simultaneously, almost shoulder to shoulder around the perimeter of the dome.They advanced in step, each one holding a round shield barely large enough to hide his massive chest.They were throwing darts similar to the ones we had been barraged with.I set up the shield in front of me  it had little extensions on the bottom to keep it upright  and with the first arrow I shot, I knew we had a chance.It struck one of them in the center of his shield, went straight through and penetrated his suit.It was a one sided massacre.The darts werent very effective without the element of surprise  but when one came sailing over my head from behind, it did give me a crawly feeling between the shoulder blades.With twenty arrows I got twenty Taurans.They closed ranks every time one dropped; you didnt even have to aim.After running out of arrows, I tried throwing their darts back at them.But their light shields were quite adequate against the small missiles.Wed killed more than half of them with arrows and spears, long before they got into range of the hand to hand weapons.I drew my sword and waited.They still outnumbered us by better than three to one.When they got within ten meters, the people with the chakram throwing knives had their own field day.Although the spinning disc was easy enough to see and took more than a half second to get from thrower to target, most of the Taurans reacted in the same ineffective way, raising up the shield to ward it off.The razor sharp, tempered heavy blade cut through the light shield like a buzz saw through cardboard.The first hand to hand contact was with the quarterstaffs, which were metal rods two meters long that tapered at the ends to a double edged, serrated knife blade.The Taurans had a cold blooded  or valiant, if your mind works that way  method for dealing with them.They would simply grab the blade and die.While the human was trying to extricate his weapon from the frozen death grip, a Tauran swordsman, with a scimitar over a meter long, would step in and kill him.Besides the swords, they had a bolo like thing that was a length of elastic cord that ended with about ten centimeters of something like barbed wire, and a small weight to propel it.It was a dangerous weapon for all concerned; if they missed their target it would come snapping back unpredictably.But they hit their target pretty often, going under the shields and wrapping the thorny wire around ankles.I stood back to back with Private Erikson, and with our swords we managed to stay alive for the next few minutes.When the Taurans were down to a couple of dozen survivors, they just turned around and started marching out.We threw some darts after them, getting three, but we didnt want to chase after them.They might turn around and start hacking again.There were only twenty eight of us left standing.Nearly ten times that number of dead Taurans littered the ground, but there was no satisfaction in it.They could do the whole thing over, with a fresh 300.And this time it would work.We moved from body to body, pulling out arrows and spears, then took up places around the fighter again.Nobody bothered to retrieve the quarterstaffs.I counted noses: Charlie and Diana were still alive (Hilleboe had been one of the quarterstaff victims), as well as two supporting officers.Wilber and Szydlowska.Rudkoski was still alive but Orban had taken a dart.After a day of waiting, it looked as though the enemy had decided on a war of attrition rather than repeating the ground attack.Darts came in constantly, not in swarms anymore, but in twos and threes and tens.And from all different angles.We couldnt stay alert forever; theyd get somebody every three or four hours.We took turns sleeping, two at a time, on top of the stasis field generator.Sitting directly under the bulk of the fighter, it was the safest place in the dome.Every now and then, a Tauran would appear at the edge of the field, evidently to see whether any of us were left.Sometimes wed shoot an arrow at him, for practice.The darts stopped falling after a couple of days.I supposed it was possible that theyd simply run out of them.Or maybe theyd decided to stop when we were down to twenty survivors.There was a more likely possibility.I took one of the quarterstaffs down to the edge of the field and poked it through a centimeter or so.When I drew it back, the point was melted off.When I showed it to Charlie, he rocked back and forth (the only way you can nod in a suit); this sort of thing had happened before, one of the first times the stasis field hadnt worked.They simply saturated it with laser fire and waited for us to go stir crazy and turn off the generator.They were probably sitting in their ships playing the Tauran equivalent of pinochle.I tried to think.It was hard to keep your mind on something for any length of time in that hostile environment, sense deprived, looking over your shoulder every few seconds.Something Charlie had said.Only yesterday.I couldnt track it down.It wouldnt have worked then; that was all I could remember.Then finally it came to me.I called everyone over and wrote in the snow:   GET NOVA BOMBS FROM SHIP.CARRY TO EDGE OF FIELD.MOVE FIELD.Szydlowska knew where the proper tools would be aboard ship.Luckily, we had left all of the entrances open before turning on the stasis field; they were electronic and would have been frozen shut.We got an assortment of wrenches from the engine room and climbed up to the cockpit.He knew how to remove the access plate that exposed a crawl space into the bomb bay.I followed him in through the meter wide tube.Normally, I supposed, it would have been pitch black.But the stasis field illuminated the bomb bay with the same dim, shadowless light that prevailed outside.The bomb bay was too small for both of us, so I stayed at the end of the crawl space and watched.The bomb bay doors had a manual override so they were easy; Szydlowska just turned a hand crank and we were in business.Freeing the two nova bombs from their cradles was another thing.Finally, he went back down to the engine room and brought back a crowbar.He pried one loose and I got the other, and we rolled them out the bomb bay.Sergeant Anghelov was already working on them by the time we climbed back down.All you had to do to arm the bomb was to unscrew the fuse on the nose of it and poke something around in the fuse socket to wreck the delay mechanism and safety restraints.We carried them quickly to the edge, six people per bomb, and set them down next to each other.Then we waved to the four people who were standing by at the field generators handles.They picked it up and walked ten paces in the opposite direction.The bombs disappeared as the edge of the field slid over them.There was no doubt that the bombs went off.For a couple of seconds it was hot as the interior of a star outside, and even the stasis field took notice of the fact: about a third of the dome glowed a dull pink for a moment, then was gray again.There was a slight acceleration, like you would feel in a slow elevator.That meant we were drifting down to the bottom of the crater.Would there be a solid bottom?Or would we sink down through molten rock to be trapped like a fly in amber  didnt pay to even think about that.Perhaps if it happened, we could blast our way out with the fighters gigawatt laser.Twelve of us, anyhow.HOW LONG?Charlie scraped in the snow at my feet.That was a damned good question.About all I knew was the amount of energy two nova bombs released.I didnt know how big a fireball they would make, which would determine the temperature at detonation and the size of the crater.I didnt know the heat capacity of the surrounding rock, or its boiling point.I wrote: ONE WEEK, SHRUG?HAVE TO THINK.The ships computer could have told me in a thousandth of a second, but it wasnt talking.I started writing equations in the snow, trying to get a maximum and minimum figure for the length of time it would take for the outside to cool down to 500 degrees.Anghelov, whose physics was much more up to date, did his own calculations on the other side of the ship.My answer said anywhere from six hours to six days (although for six hours, the surrounding rock would have to conduct heat like pure copper), and Anghelov got five hours to 4 days.I voted for six and nobody else, got a vote.We slept a lot.Charlie and Diana played chess by scraping symbols in the snow; I was never able to hold the shifting positions of the pieces in my mind.I checked my figures several times and kept coming up with six days.I checked Anghelovs computations, too, and they seemed all right, but I stuck to my guns.It wouldnt hurt us to stay in the suits an extra day and a half.We argued good naturedly in terse shorthand.There had been nineteen of us left the day we tossed the bombs outside.There were still nineteen, six days later, when I paused with my hand over the generators cutoff switch.What was waiting for us out there?Surely we had killed all the Taurans within several klicks of the explosion.But there might have been a reserve force farther away, now waiting patiently on the craters lip.At least you could push a quarterstaff through the field and have it come back whole.I dispersed the people evenly around the area, so they might not get us with a single shot.Then, ready to turn it back on immediately if anything went wrong, I pushed.8  My radio was still tuned to the general frequency; after more than a week of silence my ears were suddenly assaulted with loud, happy babbling.We stood in the center of a crater almost a kilometer wide and deep.Its sides were a shiny black crust shot through with red cracks, hot but no longer dangerous.The hemisphere of earth that we rested on had sunk a good forty meters into the floor of the crater, while it had still been molten, so now we stood on a kind of pedestal.Not a Tauran in sight.We rushed to the ship, sealed it and filled it with cool air and popped our suits.I didnt press seniority for the one shower; just sat back in an acceleration couch and took deep breaths of air that didnt smell like recycled Mandella.The ship was designed for a maximum crew of twelve, so we stayed outside in shifts of seven to keep from straining the life support systems.I sent a repeating message to the other fighter, which was still over six weeks away, that we were in good shape and waiting to be picked up.I was reasonably certain he would have seven free berths, since the normal crew for a combat mission was only three.It was good to walk around and talk again.I officially suspended all things military for the duration of our stay on the planet.Some of the people were survivors of Brills mutinous bunch, but they didnt show any hostility toward me.We played a kind of nostalgia game, comparing the various eras wed experienced on Earth, wondering what it would be like in the 700 years future we were going back to.Nobody mentioned the fact that we would at best go back to a few months furlough, and then be assigned to another strike force, another turn of the wheel.Wheels.One day Charlie asked me from what country my name originated; it sounded weird to him.I told him it originated from the lack of a dictionary and that if it were spelled right, it would look even weirder.I got to kill a good half hour explaining all the peripheral details to that.Basically, though, my parents were hippies (a kind of subculture in the late twentieth century America, that rejected materialism and embraced a broad spectrum of odd ideas) who lived with a group of other hippies in a small agricultural community.When my mother got pregnant, they wouldnt be so conventional as to get married: this entailed the woman taking the mans name, and implied that she was his property.But they got all intoxicated and sentimental and decided they would both change their names to be the same.They rode into the nearest town, arguing all the way as to what name would be the best symbol for the love bond between them  I narrowly missed having a much shorter name  and they settled on Mandala.A mandala is a wheel like design the hippies had borrowed from a foreign religion, that symbolized the cosmos, the cosmic mind, God, or whatever needed a symbol.Neither my mother nor my father knew how to spell the word, and the magistrate in town wrote it down the way it sounded to him.They named me William in honor of a wealthy uncle, who unfortunately died penniless.The six weeks passed rather pleasantly: talking, reading, resting.The other ship landed next to ours and did have nine free berths.We shuffled crews so that each ship had someone who could get it out of trouble if the preprogrammed jump sequence malfunctioned.I assigned myself to the other ship, in hopes it would have some new books.It didnt.We zipped up in the tanks and took off simultaneously.We wound up spending a lot of time in the tanks, just to keep from looking at the same faces all day long in the crowded ship.The added periods of acceleration got us back to Stargate in ten months, subjective.Of course, it was 340 years (minus seven months) to the hypothetical objective observer.There were hundreds of cruisers in orbit around Stargate.Bad news: with that kind of backlog we probably wouldnt get any furlough at all.I supposed I was more likely to get a court martial than a furlough, anyhow.Losing 88 percent of my company, many of them because they didnt have enough confidence in me to obey the direct earthquake order.And we were back where wed started on Sade 138; no Taurans there, but no base either.We got landing instructions and went straight down, no shuttle.There was another surprise waiting at the spaceport.Dozens of cruisers were standing around on the ground (theyd never done that before for fear that Stargate would be hit)  and two captured Tauran cruisers as well.Wed never managed to get one intact.Seven centuries could have brought us a decisive advantage, of course.Maybe we were winning.We went through an airlock under a returnees sign.After the air cycled and wed popped our suits, a beautiful young woman came in with a cartload of tunics and told us, in perfectly accented English, to get dressed and go to the lecture hall at the end of the corridor to our left.The tunic felt odd, light yet warm.It was the first thing Id worn besides a fighting suit or bare skin in almost a year.The lecture hall was about a hundred times too big for the twenty two of us.The same woman was there and asked us to move down to the front.That was unsettling; I could have sworn she had gone down the corridor the other way  I knew she had; Id been captivated by the sight of her clothed behind.Hell, maybe they had matter transmitters.Or teleportation.Wanted to save herself a few steps.We sat for a minute and a man, clothed in the same kind of unadorned tunic the woman and we were wearing, walked across the stage with a stack of thick notebooks under each arm.The woman followed him on, also carrying notebooks.I looked behind me and she was still standing in the aisle: To make things even more odd, the man was virtually a twin to both of them.The man riffled through one of the notebooks and cleared his throat.These books are for your convenience, he said, also with perfect accent, and you dont have to read them if you dont want to.You dont have to do anything you dont want to do, because  youre free men and women.The war is over.Disbelieving silence.As you will read in this book, the war ended 221 years ago.Accordingly, this is the year 220.Old style, of course, it is 3138 A. D.   You are the last group of soldiers to return.When you leave here, I will leave as well.And destroy Stargate.It exists only as a rendezvous point for returnees and as a monument to human stupidity.And shame.As you will read.Destroying it will be a cleansing.He stopped speaking and the woman started without a pause.I am sorry for what youve been through and wish I could say that it was for good cause, but as you will read, it was not.Even the wealth you have accumulated, back salary and compound interest, is worthless, as I no longer use money or credit.Nor is there such a thing as an economy, in which to use these  things.As you must have guessed by now, the man took over, I am, we are, clones of a single individual.Some two hundred and fifty years ago, my name was Kahn.Now it is Man.I had a direct ancestor in your company, a Corporal Larry Kahn.It saddens me that he didnt come back.I am over ten billion individuals but only one consciousness, she said.After you read, I will try to clarify this.I know that it will be difficult to understand.No other humans are quickened, since I am the perfect pattern.Individuals who die are replaced.There are some planets, however, on which humans are born in the normal, mammalian way.If my society is too alien for you, you may go to one of these planets.If you wish to take part in procreation, I will not discourage it.Many veterans ask me to change their polarity to heterosexual so that they can more easily fit into these other societies.This I can do very easily.Dont worry about that, Man, just make out my ticket.You will be my guest here at Stargate for ten days, after which you will be taken wherever you want to go, he said.Please read this book in the meantime.Feel free to ask any questions, or request any service.They both stood and walked off the stage.Charlie was sitting next to me.Incredible, he said.They let  they encourage  men and women to do that again?Together?The female aisle  Man was sitting behind us, and she answered before I could frame a reasonably sympathetic, hypocritical reply.It isnt a judgment on your society, she said, probably not seeing that he took it a little more personally than that.I only feel that its necessary as a eugenic safety device.I have no evidence that there is anything wrong with cloning only one ideal individual, but if it turns out to have been a mistake, there will be a large genetic pool with which to start again.She patted him on the shoulder.Of course, you dont have to go to these breeder planets.You can stay on one of my planets.I make no distinction between heterosexual play and homosexual.She went up on the stage to give a long spiel about where we were going to stay and eat and so forth while we were on Stargate, Never been seduced by a computer before, Charlie muttered.The 1143 year long war had been begun on false pretenses and only continued because the two races were unable to communicate.Once they could talk, the first question was Why did you start this thing?and the answer was Me?The Taurans hadnt known war for millennia, and toward the beginning of the twenty first century it looked as though mankind was ready to outgrow the institution as well.But the old soldiers were still around, and many of them were in positions of power.They virtually ran the United Nations Exploratory and Colonization Group, that was taking advantage of the newly discovered collapsar jump to explore interstellar space.Many of the early ships met with accidents and disappeared.The ex military men were suspicious.They armed the colonizing vessels, and the first time they met a Tauran ship, they blasted it.They dusted off their medals and the rest was going to be history.You couldnt blame it all on the military, though.The evidence they presented for the Taurans having been responsible for the earlier casualties was laughably thin.The few people who pointed this out were ignored.The fact was, Earths economy needed a war, and this one was ideal.It gave a nice hole to throw buckets of money into, but would unify humanity rather than dividing it.The Taurans relearned war, after a fashion.They never got really good at it, and would eventually have lost.The Taurans, the book explained, couldnt communicate with humans because they had no concept of the individual; they had been natural clones for millions of years.Eventually, Earths cruisers were manned by Man, Kahn clones, and they were for the first time able to get through to each other.The book stated this as a bald fact.I asked a Man to explain what it meant, what was special about clone to clone communication, and he said that I a priori couldnt understand it.There were no words for it, and my brain wouldnt be able to accommodate the concepts even if there were words.All right.It sounded a little fishy, but I was willing to accept it.Id accept that up was down if it meant the war was over.Man was a pretty considerate entity.Just for us twenty two, he went to the trouble of rejuvenating a little restaurant tavern and staffing it at all hours (I never saw a Man eat or drink  guess theyd discovered a way around it).I was sitting in there one evening, drinking beer and reading their book, when Charlie came in and sat down next to me.Without preamble, he said, Im going to give it a try.Give what a try?Women.Hetero.He shuddered.No offense  its not really very appealing.He patted my hand, looking distracted.But the alternative  have you tried it?Well  no, I havent.Female Man was a visual treat, but only in the same sense as a painting or a piece of sculpture.I just couldnt see them as human beings.Dont.He didnt elaborate.Besides, they say  he says, she says, it says  that they can change me back just as easily.If I dont like it.Youll like it, Charlie.Sure thats what they say.He ordered a stiff drink.Just seems unnatural.Anyway, since, uh, Im going to make the switch, do you mind if  why dont we plan on going to the same planet?Sure, Charlie, thatd be great.I meant it.You know where youre going?Hell, I dont care.Just away from here.I wonder if Heavens still as nice  No.Charlie jerked a thumb at the bartender.He lives there.I dont know.I guess theres a list.A man came into the tavern, pushing a cart piled high with folders.Major Mandella?Captain Moore?Thats us, Charlie said.These are your military records.I hope you find them of interest.They were transferred to paper when your strike force was the only one outstanding, because it would have been impractical to keep the normal data retrieval networks running to preserve so few data.They always anticipated your questions, even when you didnt have any.My folder was easily five times as thick as Charlies.Probably thicker than any other, since I seemed to be the only trooper whod made it through the whole duration.Poor Marygay.Wonder what kind of report old Stott filed about me.I flipped to the front of the folder.Stapled to the front page was a small square of paper.All the other pages were pristine white, but this one was tan with age and crumbling around the edges.The handwriting was familiar, too familiar even after so long.The date was over 250 years old.I winced and was blinded by sudden tears.Id had no reason to suspect that she might be alive.But I hadnt really known she was dead, not until I saw that date.William?Whats  Leave me be, Charlie.Just for a minute.I wiped my eyes and closed the folder.I shouldnt even read the dammed note.Going to a new life, I should leave the old ghosts behind.But even a message from the grave was contact of a sort.I opened the folder again.11 Oct 2878  William  All this is in your personnel file.But knowing you, you might just chuck it.So I made sure youd get this note.Obviously, I lived.Maybe you will, too.Join me.I know from the records that youre out at Sade 138 and wont be back for a couple of centuries.No problem.Im going to a planet they call Middle Finger, the fifth planet out from Mizar.Its two collapsar jumps, ten months subjective.Middle Finger is a kind of Coventry for heterosexuals.They call it a eugenic control baseline.No matter.It took all of my money, and all the money of five other old timers, but we bought a cruiser from UNEF.And were using it as a time machine.So Im on a relativistic shuttle, waiting for you.All it does is go out five light years and come back to Middle Finger, very fast.Every ten years I age about a month.So if youre on schedule and still alive, Ill only be twenty eight when you get here.Hurry!I never found anybody else and I dont want anybody else.I dont care whether youre ninety years old or thirty.If I cant be your lover, Ill be your nurse.Marygay.Say, bartender.Yes, Major?Do you know of a place called Middle Finger?Is it still there?Of course it is.Where else would it be?Reasonable question.A very nice place.Garden planet.Some people dont think its exciting enough.Whats this all about?Charlie said.I handed the bartender my empty glass.I just found out where were going.9  EPILOGUE  From The New Voice, Paxton, Middle Finger 24 6      14/2/3143   OLD TIMER HAS FIRST BOY  Marygay Potter Mandella (24
