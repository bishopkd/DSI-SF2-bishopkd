that the old laws apply.Let us in.Inside, uniformed staff met us and made us welcome.Their anxiety was palpable but muted compared to everyone elses.There was a pretend normality in those secret halls: it was the only place Id been for weeks where rhythms didnt seem utterly sideswiped by the crisis.Carers went with drugs and charts in and out of rooms.I got the sense that this crew would continue with these day to day activities until word starved Ariekei broke through their doors and killed them.I suppose there were other institutions in Embassytown where the dynamic of the quotidian sustainedsome hospitals, perhaps some schools, perhaps houses where shiftparents most deeply loved the children.Whenever any society dies there must be heroes whose fightback is to not change.The infirmary was infirmary and asylum and jail for failed Ambassadors.As if it would work every time you tried to make two people into one, Bren whispered to me, in scorn.Ambassadors were bred in waves: we passed rooms of men and women all the same generation.First through the corridor of the middle aged, incarcerated failures more than half a megahour old, staring at the cams and at the one way glass that kept us invisible.I saw doppels in separated chambers, unlinked I suppose or linked loosely enough that the wall between them caused no discomfort.Looking into room after room I saw faces twice, twice, twice.Some cells were empty and windowless and spare, some opulent with fabrics, looking out over Embassytown and the city.There were inmates secured or limited by electronic tags, even straps.Mostly the infirm, as one of the doctors who guided us called them, said nothing, but one of those buckled in constraints screamed inventive filth at us.How she knew we were passing beyond the opaque glass I dont know.We saw her mouth move, and the doctor pressed a button that for a few seconds let us hear her.I disliked him for it a great deal.Everything was clean.There were flowers.Wherever possible over double rooms was the printed name of those inside, with honorific: Ambassador HerOt, Ambassador JusTin, Ambassador DagNey.Some had simply never had the empathy theyd needed, to pretend to share a mind, had only ever been two people who looked the same, despite training, drugs, the link and coercions.Many were insane to different degrees.Even if they had facility with Language, theyd been left unstable, resentful, melancholic.Dangerous.There were those whod been made mad through cleavage.Who hadnt, as Bren had, been able to survive the death of a doppel.They were broken half people.There was a huge variety of the failed.Many more than there were Ambassadors.I was horrified at these numbers.I never knew, I told myself.We were too civilised to end them: hence this polite prison where we waited for them to die.I knew enough Terre history to assume that some of these failed must be counted so because of political refusals.I was reading every nameplate we passed, and I realised it was for names I recognised, like DalTonthose of dissidents of whom only bad citizens like me spoke.No sign.Past an extreme section, men and women older than my shiftparents baying like animals and those talking with careful civility on coms to their carers, or to no one.Christ, I said, Christ Pharotekton.In its withdrawal,  unthinkingly defecated.It realised what it had done and said something in shame: the action was as taboo for the Hosts as for us.I think the doctors deliberately took us a long way to our destination, a room where we could hold our auditions.So we were voyeurs on chamber after chamber.We passed walls painted in brighter colours, where screens were uploaded with playware, and God help me the aesthetics were so incongruous that it took me seconds to understand.This was where they brought Ambassador young, some just 50 kilohours old.I didnt look through the windows in those doors, and Im glad I didnt see the unfixable children.IN A LARGE ROOM, we asked  to pay attention.One by one the doctors brought in what they thought the most likely candidates, all of them under guard.Those whod never mastered Language were no good to us, nor those too unstable.But some pairs held almost all their lives had been incarcerated for nothing but that there was something lacking when they spoke Language, a component we couldnt detect.Many of them retained a startling degree of sanity.Those were the people we tried.An aging duo stood before us, men without any easy Ambassador arrogance.Instead they seemed inadequate to the courtesy we gave them.They were named XerXes.The Ariekes entranced them: theyd seen no Hosts for years.They could once speak Language, a doctor told us, then suddenly they stopped being able to.We dont know why.XerXes had a polite and uninquisitive affect.Do you remember Language, Ambassador XerXes?Da said.What a question!What a question!XerXes said.Were an Ambassador.Were an Ambassador.Would you greet our guest for us?They looked out of the window.Sectors of the city were listless and discoloured in withdrawal, overrun by wens.Greet them?said XerXes.Greet them?They muttered together.They prepared, lengthily, whispering, nodding.We got impatient.They spoke.Classic words, that even I knew well., they said.Its pleasing to greet you and have you here.The Ariekes snapped its eye coral up.I thought, because I wanted to, that it was like the motion Ariekei made when they heard EzRa speak.peered slowly around the room.It was just looking because there had been a new noise.It might have reacted the same had I dropped a glass.It lost interest.XerXes spoke again, something like, Would you speak now to me?The Ariekes ignored them and XerXes spoke again and their voice fell apart, degraded, the Cut and Turn each saying half of a different entreaty.It wasnt pleasant.I dont quite believe there was no Language in it.I think there was something, a remnant, in what the Ariekes heard.Ive thought back to what I saw, to the way it moved, and I dont believe in fact it was exactly as it would have been to random noise.It made no difference, wasnt enough, but there was, I think, in XerXes and I dont know how many others, the ghost of Language.Ambassador XerXes were taken back to their rooms.They went tamely.One looked at us with I swear apology as he shuffled to his imprisonment.Others: older first; younger; then, appallingly, two sets of adolescents desperate to please us.Some were equalised and dressed the same; some were not.A pair about my age, FeyRis, attempted cold defiance, but still tried desperately to speak Language when we asked them to.stared at them and recognised something, but not enough.FeyRis were the first of our candidates to curse us as they were takendraggedaway.I stared at MagDa.I liked them, I admired them.Theyd known about this.WE MET SEVENTEEN Ambassadors.Twelve sounded to me as if they were speaking Language.Nine seemed to have some kind of an effect on the Ariekes.Three times I wondered if we had found what YlSib had hoped we might, what we were looking for, to take EzRas place and keep Embassytown alive.But whatever they had wasnt enough.If EzRas Language was a drug, I thought, perhaps some other Ambassadors, one day, would be a poison.We played  one of the last datchips.It slumped and shuddered at EzRas meanderings about the biggest tree Ez had ever climbed.There was nothing in the infirmary that could help us.You cant replicate that, a doctor said.These...She indicated the imprisoned mistakes beyond our room.They have imperfections.Thats not what there was in EzRa.Two random people should not be able to speak Language.You wont find anything like that.It wasnt just unlikely that wed find EzRa the first time: it was impossible.How do you propose to find it again?NO WONDER EzRa couldnt survive.The universe had had to correct itself.We sat in committee.We have to close this place, I said.Not now, Avice, MagDa said.Its monstrous.Not now, Christ!Theres not going to be anything to close......or any of us to close it, if we dont bloody think.So, silence.Once every minute or so, someone around the table would look as if he or she was about to say something, but none of us had anything.Someone was sniffing as if they might cry.MagDa whispered to each other.Get what researchers you can in here, they said at last.Riggers, bios, medics, linguists...Anyone you can think of.This Ariekes..They looked at each other.Do what you have to.Test it.Take it apart.They waited for dissent.There was none.Take it apart and see if you can find out whats happening.Inside.In its bone house.They glanced at Bren and me.When it hears EzRa.See if you can find out anything.Maybe we can synth it that way.Like that, by that leadership, we would murder a Host.Not even in self defence but calculation.Embassytown became something new.I was in awe of Mag and Da for their bravery.It was a dreadful act.MagDa had known it had to come from them.I dont think any of us thought wed discover in the Ariekess innards any secrets to its addiction, but wed try.And, too, we were all going to die soon, and it was time for new paradigms, and MagDa gave us one.They took it on themselves to tell us what it meant to be at war.They gave us a dirty hope.It was one of the most selfless things Ive ever seen.16  THE VIVISECTION on the addict in the infirmary told us nothing.Within days Embassytown knew that the committee had tried to stave off what was coming, to create a new EzRa, and had failed.Word spread because word will spread.Stories and secrets fight, stories win, shed new secrets, which new stories fight, and on.Mag and Da had us go to war.Too late, those of us not despairing put up barricades.Wed surrendered the edges of Embassytown.Now some streets in, we hauled out the contents of deserted houses, broke them up and threw them across our streets.Earthmovers cut trenches and piled up the ruins of our roads and the Ariekene earth below them into sloped revetments.We hardened them with plastone and concrete, stationed shooters, to protect the remains of our town in the city, from Ariekei in need.Buildings became gun towers.Wed always had a few weapons, to which we added those taken from the Bremen caches, and engineers and riggers made new ordnance.We checked all our technology for biorigged components, destroyed it at any sign of addiction.We burned the tainted, squealing machines in autos da f of heretic technology.All this was too late, we knew.Ambassador EdGar hanged themselves.EdGar had been on the committee.Their suicides shocked us all over again.Ambassadors were suicide pioneers, and other Embassytowners copied them.Men and women would suit up by the barriers at our borders, aeoli breathing into them, holding knives, clubs, guns they had made or bred.Theyd trudge over our fortifications and into territory that had recently just been the street, was now badlands.They left us, swivelling at side streets, weapons out in manoeuvres copied from the forays of our constables and the Charo City set policing dramas imported in the miabs.Sometimes, at the limits of our vision, the Ariekei would wait for them, by sickly indigenous buildings.We didnt try to stop these one way explorers.I doubt they thought they would escape Embassytowns fate by walking into bad air, into an exot city gone bad.I think they just wanted to do something.We called them the morituri.After the first few, little crowds began to come, to cheer them as they went.The Ariekei were horrifying now.All were sick, and starving.They were thin, or strangely distended by hunger gases; their eyes were unfamiliar colours; they jerked, or dragged limbs that didnt behave.Their fanwings quivered.Some still tried to work with us.They strived against their addiction.They gathered at the base of the barriers, ostentatiously not attempting to breach them, to prove goodwill.They would call us.We would fetch MagDa or RanDolph or another Ambassador on the committee, and they would attempt to parley.Sometimes the Hosts left us energy, fuel, miraculously untainted biorigging.We gave them the food or medicines they were no longer able to make.We promised them EzRas voice, which was all they begged for.Whatever inklings they had about how lies worked, about the nature of our promise, they showed no suspicion.They waited hopelessly.Often they dispersed only when driven away by their less controlled siblings.The most desperate oratees, incapable of planning, would come full tilt at the barricades, leap far and fast up them, grabbing with giftwings, shouting in Language.We repelled them.We killed them when we had to.Ive seen Ariekei shot, blown apart by explosives, burnt by the caustic sputum of biorigging, cut with blades.When anyone killed their first Ariekes, a life of conditioned respect would break: gunners would weep.The second time not.ANIMALS INFILTRATED the lost streets.Altbrocks, foxes, monkeys moving curiously down wheel ruts.Truncators climbed drainpipes and worried at loosening windows.Once in a while some depressive guard would shoot one and the beasts would scatter, but it quickly became bad luck to kill a Terre beast.It became instead a sport to take out the fluttering, tottering, strangely walking Ariekene animals that also came.No one was sure whether truncs, neither Terre nor indigene, were targets or not, and they were left alone.We avoided thinking about our inadequate stocks of food, of energy, of the stuff we needed.A narrative went up with our walls of torn up rubbish, of last stands and resistance, the onslaught of hordes.It helped.In the evenings, people gathered in the little neighbourhoods left to us.I was surprised at what gave us comfort.Artists plumbed our archives, digital archaeology, back millions of hours, to the antediasporan age.They pulled up corroded ancient fictions to screen.These ones are Georgian or Roman, I gather, one organiser told me.They talk early Anglo, though.Men and women bled of colour, in clumsy symbolism, fortified in a house and fighting grossly sick figures.Colour came back, and protagonists were in an edifice full of products, and sicker enemies than before relentlessly came for them.We read the story as ours, of course.WE KNEW THE Ariekei would breach our defences.They entered the houses that edged our zone, found their ways to rear and side doors, large windows, to holes.Some came out of the front doors into our streets and tore apart what they found.Those with remnants of memory tried to get to the Embassy.They came at night.They were like monsters in the dark, like figures from childrens books.There were other dangers: there were human bandits.A rumour circulated that one group of criminals included Kedis and Shurasi, as well as Terre.There was no evidence.Still, when, by what was certainly human action, a Shurasi was found dead by our main barricade, the excuse was whispered that it had been part of that predatory gang.They only died by violence or mishap, and for that race the death  every Shurasi death  was an abomination as epic as the Fall.Not all the Ariekene corpses we cleared were killed by us, nor by the random brutality of other afflicted Hosts.Some were destroyed with what seemed a more deliberate alien savagery.Thats those we saw, Bren told me.Without their fan wings.Were worrying about the addicts, but we need to think about them, too.Where are YlSib?I said.Theyre not lunatics, you know, he said.There are ways of being in the city.Yl, Sib...and others.You know ambassading doesnt always take.That place has to close, Bren.Christ.Those people cant be kept like that.I know.I stayed the night with him, for the second time.We said even less than we had the first time, but that was really alright, as alright as it got that night.Do you think there are languages made up of three voices?I asked him at one point.Its a big out, he said.Sure.And four, and five.I said, And places where exots speak Anglo in ways that mess up human heads.We stood naked by his window, his arm over my shoulder and mine around his waist, and listened to fires, shouts, shattering.BREN GOT A BUZZ early the next morning.He would not say from whom, to my anger.He raced us to the border.A tide of Ariekei were coming.They galloped at the barricades in a wave, an invasion organised with last gasps of sentience.I very much stress that I wish to hear the voice of EzRa please, the Ariekei shouted as they came to kill us.Is there a possibility that we could hear EzRa speak?The guards were calling for backup.MagDa, our comrades and Staff came.With animal guns fast bred without ears, with rapidly machinofactured bullets, with hurled clubs and polymer crossbows firing quarrels made of reclaimed stair rods, we staved the Hosts off.Ariekei burst, screaming their polite requests, we most sincerely ask.Zelles scuttled up our barriers and we shot them too.Kedis were with us.There were Shurasi playing out electrified wires.I saw Simmon firing expertly with what had once been his off arm.With only the tiniest organising the Ariekei would have taken us, but they were drugless and incompetent.They had to clamber over hillocks of their dead.Scavengers came: wild house antibodies.Our own birds tasted the air over the carnage and arced away again.My eyes were watering from acrid Ariekene innards.There was a commotion from side streets.Something was slamming into the Hosts.I shouted for Brens attention.It was a mass of those other, self mutilated Ariekei.Theyd come hidden among the others, a fifth column.Bren watched them without expression, while the rest of us gaped, as they dispersed our junkie attackers brutally.Bren was the first here, Da said quietly to me.She looked over to where Mag spoke to him.With you.He knew this would happen, didnt he?How?I shook my head.He knows people.Do you?I wasnt going to mention YlSib.Da was no fool: it wouldnt have surprised me if she was aware of everything, including relevant names.Come on, I said.What do you know, Avice?I didnt answer but I met her eye, to make sure I didnt seem embarrassed or ashamed; so if she could tell I was holding back, she knew it was because I was trying to show respect for something.I was buzzed right then, from an ID I didnt recognise, sound only, no trid or flat.The voice was muffled beyond recognition.Say that again, I shouted.Who is this?Say that again.Whoever it was did and that time I heard.I held my breath and hoped I was wrong and put it to speaker, so Mag and Da and Bren could hear.But I was right.The words came one more time, much clearer.CalVins dead.ALL WE FOUND in their rooms was the detritus of drink and of sex.There was no answer on CalVins buzz.We went to clubs theyd been known to visit, where to my disgust a last fervent few were still trying to blot out the end of the world.They told us CalVin hadnt been there for days.The last time, theyd been accompanied by some uninterested man.Down to other bars, and nothing and still nothing.I knew abruptly who had been with CalVin.We took a route to where Id once lived, where Scile had once lived, and to which now that Id gone, hed returned.My key still worked.Sciles stuff was everywhere, the flat was all his now, but he was absent.There was a note from him, to me, on the bed that had once been ours.It had been opened already.I unfolded it just enough to read the line This is to say goodbye, and stopped.CalVin were in another room.The message had been wrong: CalVin wasnt dead.Vin was dead.He dangled.Cal was watching him move pendulum precise.I saw another note, on another mattress.Cal looked at me.God knows what he saw in my face right then.I didnt feel it, he said.I didnt know.I. ..He touched his neck, his link.It was...but we turned it on again.I should have known.I didnt know.How could...I didnt know.He sounded bestial with loss.How?he shouted.Who is this?He threw out his hands at his dead doppel, his brother, impossibly alone dead.Part Six  NEW KINGS    17  I HELD SCILE'S letter for hours, and I dont think I even knew it.It was I who ended up alone with Cal, after wed taken him to the Embassy and given him drugs to calm him.Did you cut him down?he said.We took care of him, I said.Why are you here?he said to me as others came and went.MagDall be here in a minute, I said, theyre just organising some   I didnt mean...He didnt speak for seconds.I wasnt complaining, Avice.Vins gone...Why are you here with me?Even now it was hard to acknowledge something wed known for months, the fact of disparity.After a long time I just shrugged.I just didnt know.He spoke with wonder.I had to...we separate sometimes now, we have to, a little bit.And...I was just...He and Scile were working, I thought, and...He put his own note, from his doppel, on the bed.He let me pick it up.People brought food and murmured in sympathy: CalVin had collapsed fast into selfishness, as others fought to fix the world, but Cal, and CalVin, had been central enough beforetimes to retain something.CalVin had been a leading Ambassador.Tipped to head the Embassy when JoaQuin retired.For many of the committee, their failure hadnt been a failing but a sickness, and this was its dreadful result.I unfolded Vins message.Im not like you.Forgive me.Tell her something from me.Please forgive me.Im not so strong.Ive had enough.Perhaps Id expected or hoped for something like that second line.You see my orders, Cal said.So what shall I tell you?And though he tried to make it unpleasant, I couldnt bear the break in his voice.I looked at the other paper, Sciles letter.I think it was...Vin found that just before...Cal said.I hadnt heard MagDa and Bren come in.I realised they were there when Cal said something like, Avice Benner Cho and I are just comparing our valedictories.Dearest Avice, I read.Dearest Avice,  This is to say goodbye.I am walking.Out.I hope you can forgive me for this but I cannot stay, I will not do life here anymore   And then I stopped, refolded the thing.Even Cal looked at me with a bit of sympathy.He was something, once, I said.I wont indulge this.This isnt the man I married, I could have said, and I shocked them by laughing coldly.I pictured the visionary enthusiast Id loved traipsing through Embassytown to find a place to end himself.I wondered when we would find him.MagDa took the note from me.Da read it, handed it to Mag.You should read this, Da said.Im not going to read it, I said.It explains things.His...theories...Jesus fucking Christ Pharotekton, MagDa, Im not going to read it.I stared them down.He took the Oates Road.Hes gone.I dont care about his fucking theologies.I can tell you what it says.Language is the language of God.The Ariekei are angels.Sciles their messenger, maybe.And now its the fall.Our lies corrupt them?Brens expression was fixed.MagDa shifted and couldnt deny the accuracy of what I said.You think youre the only one suffering?they said.Get over yourself and do it now, Avice.It was when he read this  Mag or Da shook Sciles letter  that Vin did himself in, do you realise that?What were they doing?I said.What was Vin thinking?So does Scile say what...?I regretted asking.Just that he cant bear it here anymore, Bren said.So hes gone.And the reasons why.The ones you said.THE FANWINGLESS, self mutilated Ariekei were murdering more of their neighbours.Bren sent vespcams searching.He followed vague directions I was sure came from YlSib and other contacts.We saw the deafened Ariekeis raids, had camswarms enter the corpses of houses and the holes where dwellings had uprooted or sublimed.I didnt know what we were searching for.Hed given us no idea of which direction hed walked away to die, and I repeatedly imagined the lenses finding Sciles body.They did not.Where there was the new breed without their fanwings, they were bunkered down in ruins, touching each others skins, and pointing.If they caught our cams they destroyed them.They hunted the oratees.There were Ariekei not so far gone as the addict living dead, nor so enraged as the marauders: in biorigging nurseries or their skeletons, they talked frantically in Language so fast Bren found it hard to follow.Ive not heard talk like that, he said.Things are changing.They were trying to live.They shouted for EzRas voice, and built encampments around the speakers that had been silent for days now.They cleaned them like totems.They tended what few young survived, and protected the post sentient oldsters, also addicted, though they didnt know it.We saw a stand off between a tiny group of these at least residually civilised, and the walking ruins, who looked at the mindless elders and made mouth moves of hunger.On my own I watched other things.Grubbing through border cam footage from the night we found Vin  no one knew I was doing it  I found at last a few seconds of my husband, on his walk, out of Embassytown.One more change of shot after abrupt change, and I was watching him descending one of our lower barricades.He glanced up, at what must have been another cam, the stream from which I couldnt find, so I never saw his expression full on.I could tell it was Scile, though.He went, not walking slowly nor with obvious depression.He walked into the dangerous street like someone exploring, in those seconds I saw, before the signal stuttered, and there was just the street and he was gone.DURING THE WEEKS of his incarceration, Wyatt, Bremens redundant man, had repeatedly demanded to talk to us.At first, in a nebulous sense of due process, the committee had agreed.All hed done was shout in panicked bullying, denounced us.We stopped coming.Some people speculated that he had managed to send an emergency flare to Bremen: even if he had, and even if it was well programmed, it would be months before it reached them, and months again until they sent any response through the immer.Too late for us to be saved, even as mutineers.I didnt think much about it when MagDa first told me Wyatt was demanding to see us again.Wed been keeping him in solitary, in case of those imagined other Bremen agents in Embassytown to whom he might give orders.Hes finally heard about Ra, Mag said.He knows hes dead.Incommunicado or not, I was surprised it had taken so long for word to get to him.You should hear this, actually.We watched the feed from Wyatts cell.Listen to me!He addressed the cameras carefully.I can stop this.Listen!How long has Ra been dead, you idiots?How can I help if you wont tell me whats happening?Bring me to Ez.You want to rule, you can rule, be a republic, I dont care, I dont give a shit.It doesnt matter.Whatever you want, but if you want there to be an Embassytown at all then for Gods sake let me out of here.I can stop this.You have to take me to Ez.Wed seen him wheedling, and blustering, but this was new.At our perimeter, oratees and their Ariekei enemies came at us incessantly.At the start of what looked like our last defence campaign, MagDa, Bren, the best of the committee and I went to see Wyatt.EMBASSYTOWN JAIL was still staffed by a few guards who, out of helplessness as much as duty, didnt disappear.Wyatt had refused to explain anything to us until we took him with us  under guard  to see Ez.We watched the half Ambassador in his cell, in a dirty prison uniform.What did you think?Wyatt muttered.He was speaking to us while he stared at Ez.How did you think that worked?he said.He nodded and added, Hello, Avice.Wyatt, I said.I didnt know why he singled me out.Two strangers, two friends, just so bloody happened to get a score like that on the Stadt Empathy test?Christ Uploaded, are you stupid?He shook his head and held up his hands in apology  he wasnt trying to fight.Listen.This didnt just happen: this was done.Understand?He pointed at Ez.Scan that bastards head.His insinuation was that whatever he wanted to explain might change things, might give us a fingerhold of hope.If that was true, Ez must have known it too, but had done and said nothing.Hed pissed away even his own hope.Scan it, Wyatt said.Youll see.He was made.Made by Bremen.My eyes only, Wyatt said.You might still be able to get the orders off my datspace, if you havent destroyed it.Ez.Operative Joel Rukowsi.Ill give you the passes.Rukowsi had had a certain facility, a predisposition for mental connection unachievable for most of us: but it was generalised, not directed.He wasnt a twin: he had no close friends with whom hed achieved any particular intuitive bond.They didnt have language to give his talent an accurate name, so they misrepresented it calling it empathy.It wasnt that he felt as others felt, though: his ability manifested in nasty parlour tricks.Hed been an interrogator.Virtuoso  knowing when a subject would break, what to press for, what to promise, whether they were lying, how to make them stop lying.He was recruited young, and theyd honed his strange skills, with exercises, ways of focusing, and with more invasive methods, too.Theyd left him different.Some among our little group were murmuring, interrupting Wyatt.I clicked my fingers to shut them up.What?I said.I waved my hand at Wyatt, Go on.They made him...what...?A mind reader?Ez sat beyond our sound with his head down still.I wished the guards would hit him.Of course not, Wyatt said.Telepathys impossible.But with the right drugs, and implants and receivers, you can get brains into a certain phase.Enough.With a sensitive like him  I sneered at that and Wyatt waited.You know what I mean.Theres not many of them, but someone like him, when theyve worked on him, and get him to train with someone else with the right hardware plugged in...He tapped his head.Ez there can make himself read like that person.He waved his hand sine wave style.Same output.Its related to linktech but its much stronger, works on heads bugger all like each other, so long as one of thems...Well, a quote sensitive unquote.At first they were thinking about totally other stuff, under covers for id readers, get agents out of scans  mimic brainwaves and whatnot.Then something occurred to them.You know, he continued slowly, supposedly they once tried growing their own doppels?Back in Charo City?When the colony started.He shook his head.Didnt go so well.Story goes they sink years into it, without any Ariekei to listen to to keep the skills up, with no sense of Embassytown on the ground  miabs being even less frequent then  and end up with...well, pairs of people who are dysfunctional in Bremen.He indicated twoness with his hands.And everywhere.Hardly reliable.But then heres Rukowsi.The thinking was it might be a way to solve an old problem.The mystery of what it was the Hosts discerned in our Ambassadors voices remained unsolved: all that Charo City had ascertained was that after implants, augmens, chemicals and hundreds of hours of training, Joel Rukowsi and his fellow agent, linguist Coley Wren, codename Ra, had been able to score astonishingly on the Stadt scale.No one had known whether it would sound like Language to the Ariekei  but Stadt was the only test anyone had for that, and the operatives looked, at least, to have passed.If in fact it hadnt worked, if it had failed in the ways the paymasters had imagined it might possibly fail, if EzRa had spoken and elicited polite incomprehension, then nothing would have been lost.Two career agents would have a long and dull assignment, until the next Bremen bound ship.But what if they succeeded?None of you lot are fools, Wyatt said.Why would you think we are?You think we didnt get all your provocations, your fake meetings, your secret agendas, your disobedience, your tax skimming, your doctoring of biorigging, keeping the best, or making it so no one but Embassytowners can make it work?You think thats been invisible?For Christs sake, weve known for hundreds of thousands of hours that youve been building to independence.The silence after he said that would have meant a declaration of war, shortly before.In these new times it was only a silence.What he said felt not like a revelation but like something impolite.Wyatt rubbed his eyes.Its just history, he said.Its adolescence.All colonies do it.We can set our fucking clocks by you.This is my fifth stationing.Before this, I was in Chao Polis, on Dracosi, on Berit Blue.Does that mean anything to you?Christ, do you people not read?Dont you upload the dat that comes in the miabs?Im a specialist.They send me in where outposts are spoiling for a fight.You quash secession, said Bren.God, no, Wyatt said.You may be the mysterious old man here, but Im from the out, and you cant hide your ignorance from me.Berit Blue did secede, with only the tiniest war.He held thumb and forefinger minutely apart to show how small the war had been.Dracosis independence was totally peaceful.Chao Polis is midway through thrashing out a plan with us for regional autonomy.How crude do you think we are, Bren?They are free...and theyre ours.He let that sit.But there are exceptions.Youre too far from Bremen, too hard to reach, for easy management.And youre not ready.You werent going to be getting independence soon.Its the fault of Language: thats whats confused you.You think youre aristocracy.You thought, I should say.And that this colony was your estate.And you had a kind of point: unlike every other aristocracy Ive ever seen you really are indispensable.Were.So youve been choosing your successors since forever.Congratulations: you invented hereditary power.But every one of you, every Ambassador and every vizier, every member of Staff in Embassytown, is a Bremen employee.Ambassadors: get it?Who do you think you speak for?We can hire, and we can fire.And we can replace.EZRA HAD BEEN a test.An operation to strip our Ambassadors of power and hobble self government.Their success would have changed everything.In two, three ship shifts, the social system of this outpost would have been overthrown.If those other than our Ambassadors could speak Language, apparatchiks, career diplomats and loyalists could be sent to Embassytown for a few local years, and soon wed rely on Bremen for survival.Our Ambassadors would die slowly half by half, doppel by doppel, and be mourned but not replaced.The cre`che would close.The infirmary would empty as death took the failed, and there would be no others.It would have been a bloodless, elegant, slow assertion of Bremen control.How could we have asked for independence when our contact with the Hosts who sustained us relied on Bremen staff?All Embassytown had had was its monopoly on Language, and with EzRa, Bremen had tried to break that.A world destroying mistake.Not a stupid one: only the very worst luck.A quirk of psyche and phonetics.It made sense that they would try.It would have been an elegant imperial manoeuvre.Counter revolution through language pedagogy and bureaucracy.Bioriggings...good, MagDa said.Its invaluable.And, minerals and stuff from heres useful too.And a few other things.But still.Come on.Why all this?Were a backwater, they were saying.There was no false pride or denial.Most of us had wondered at some time why Embassytown wasnt just allowed to die.Id have thought it would make sense to some of you, Wyatt said.That youd realise exactly whats going on.And he looked up, straight at me.I stood and folded my arms.I looked down my face at him.Everyone turned their gaze to me.At last I said, Immer.Id been to towns in hollowed rocks and a planet threaded with linear cities like a filigree net, to dry places with unbreathable air, ports, and places about which I could say nothing.Some were independent.Many belonged, free or not, to Bremen.They never let a colony collapse, I said.Wed all heard it.Never.No matter if the cost of transportation outweighed the prices of trinkets and expertise shipped back, they wouldnt let this town go, so long as we were theirs.My companions were nodding slowly.Wyatt was not.Jesus, Avice, he said.What do you sound like?It is a foundation of our government...There was a strange glee in him, a functionarys dissidence, giving the lie to lines hed spoken many times.You know how many colonies have been cut off?Youve seen the charts, the gravestone symbols in the immer.I knew the stories of planets studded with human and human/exot ruins, where high rises sank into alien muck.Found landscapes deserted by design, failure, and in one or two instances, mystery.They were an immerser clich.I felt reproached by all that empty architecture: that, knowing of it, I could still have repeated my governments lines.If it were in Bremens interests, Wyatt said, wed let you go, and send me to oversee it.We didnt go to this effort because we leave no colony behind.He looked at me expectantly again.Have another go.I thought of the charts.I looked up, as if through the ceiling, at Wreck.I knew more about the immer than anyone else there, including him.I remembered conversations, the shy enthusiasms of a helmsman unaware he hinted at any secrets.Were on the edge, I said to my colleagues.Of the immer.Theyre exploring.Embassytown was going to be a way station.All the biorigging and so on, Wyatt said.Its nice.He shrugged.Nice to have.But Avice Benner Chos right.Youve had more attention than a little place like this deserves.None of us looked at Mag or Da.We all knew now what several of us had suspected before, that their lover Ra had been an agent, had betrayed them, and us.It was no surprise hed had an agenda, but that it was something so inimical to Embassytown shocked me.And that Ra, in the days of crisis when everything had changed, had not said.Though, I didnt know what MagDa knew.I missed the immer.The way the mess and mass of it gushed by ships on their way to impossibly far parts of the everyday universe, immersed in that infinitely older unplace.I imagined being an explorer on pioneering ships built for ruggedness, buffeted by currents through dangerous parts, through schools of immer stuff sharks, repelling random or deliberate attack.I didnt believe in the nobility of the explorer, but the thought, the project, compelled me.Theyd have to build fuelling stations, I said.And its a hard place to emerge: theyd have to put more markers in place.Buoys that jutted half in immer, half in the quotidian void, with lights and immer analogues of lights to guide incomers.The night over Embassytown was to have glimmered with more than just Wreck.It would have been strung with little colours.And while ships stored up on fuel, supplies, chemicals for life systems, and uploaded the newest dat and immerware, Embassytown would be where crews waited and played.They want to make us a port town, I said.Wyatt said, Last port before the dark.Embassytown might come to be a kilometres wide sprawl of bordellos, drink, and all the other vices of travellers.Id been to many such places in the out.Then we might have had our own street children, harvesting food and mutating the rubbish on town dumps.It wouldnt be inevitable.There are ways of providing port services without the collapse of all the civic.I had been to more salubrious stopover cities.But it would have been a struggle.To control a source of beautiful half living technology, of curios, of precious metals in near unique molecular configurations might have been desirable.To control the last outpost, a jumping off to an expanding frontier, was non negotiable.Whats out there?I said.Wyatt shook his head.I dont know.Youd know better than me, immerser, and you dont know at all.But something.Theres always something.There was always something in the immer.Whys there a pharos here?he said.You dont put a lighthouse where no ones going to go.You put it somewhere dangerous where they have to go.There are reasons to be careful in this quadrant, but there are reasons to come  to pass through, en route somewhere else.Theyll come, MagDa said.Bremen.To see how theyre doing.Ez and Ra, I mean.To check on them.They looked at each other.We might not have so long to wait.As wed thought.More than five bloody days is too long, now, someone said.Were at the end.Yes but...What if we  Wyatt was a clever man who had misplayed his hand, and was trying to salvage something: his life, at least.Hed told us everything, and not out of despair as it might seem, but as a gamble, a strategy.We looked at the glass that separated us from Ez.Ez raised his eyes to ours, to all of ours, as if he knew we stared.18  GROUPS OF ARIEKEI were on their rooftops, between dead buildings, roaming in armed gangs: all strategies to protect themselves from the mutilated rampagers.Ariekei dead were everywhere, and here and there the remnants of Kedis, and Shurasi, and Terre, dragged by Ariekene murderers for reasons beyond our reason.Packs of zelles wandered, hungry for food and EzRas speech, deserted by their erstwhile owners and gone incompetently feral.It wasnt a city anymore, it was a collection of broken places separated by war without politics or acquisition, so not war at all really but something more pathological.In each holdout, a few Ariekei tried to be the things they remembered.But they could concentrate only for hours at a time, before the equivalents of delirium tremens overtook them.Their companions would whisper words theyd heard EzRa say to whichever of their company was succumbing, trying to imitate the Ambassadors timbre.They were just words, just clauses.Sometimes those convulsing would return to half mindfulness: enough to remember that something needed rebuilding.Between those remnant settlements were the truly mindless that didnt even know that they shook when they did, and only hunted for food and for the voice of EzRa, and were hunted by each other.The self mutilated, though, were suddenly rarer.I wondered if they were dying.In places we had to haul our barriers back, abandon sections of Embassytown to the oratees.At the same time, there was an unexpected exodus of Hosts  we still called them that, sometimes, in unpleasant humour  from the city.Ariekei in small but growing numbers found the mouths and orifices where industrial guts linked the city to the meadows of biorigging and wild country.They followed them out.Do they think theyll find EzRa out there?We didnt know where they were going, or why.I thought perhaps they simply couldnt bear to live any more in a slaughterhouse of architecture, amid what had been their compatriots.Perhaps their need for quiet deaths was stronger than their need for EzRas voice.I tried not to experience too much relief, or even hope, at that notion, at the possibility that more would leave; but, cautiously, I felt some.WE EXHUMED Ra.I didnt see it.We thanked Christ that hed not been cremated or rendered biomass.It was MagDa whod saved his body: hed had no faith, but his familys listed tradition was Unitarian Shalomic, which abjured those usual local methods, and in an effort at respect MagDa had had him interred in a small graveyard for those of such heresies.We waited like parents to be while doctors worked with the schematics Wyatt provided.They removed from Ras dead head the implant, the hidden booster of his ordinary seeming link.It was the size of my thumb, sheathed in organics, though it was all Terretech.It made me wonder if, had the Bremeni designers used Ariekene biorigging, the implants themselves would have become infected like the Hosts, and the thing that let Ez and Ra be EzRa would have become hooked on their voice.What theology that would have been, a god self worshipping, a drug addicted to itself.THE COMMITTEE dragooned scientists from wherever they still worked: the stumps of hospitals; rogue ministering in the streets; of course from the infirmary.We begged and forced others to start work again.Southel, our scientific overseer, organised the researches.They moved fast.I believe Joel Rukowsi, Ez, thought himself a consummate game player.He thought how broken he looked was a front, I think.We asked him why hed said nothing about his hidden, embedded technology, why hed have gone to his death with the rest of us rather than do something that might keep us all alive.He implied some hidden agenda but I dont think he had an answer.He was just eaten by his own secrets.He didnt understand the mechanisms, could only truculently describe how it had worked for him.He looked at the insert we had dug out of Ra, warm in my hand.I dont feel anything, he said.I just knew...how he was feeling, what to say.I dont know if it was that thing made it easier, or what.The researchers had teased apart the filigrees that enmeshed it into Ras mind with disentangler techzymes.Its nanotendrils dangled from it like thin hair, twitched in my hand in vain search for neuro matter.It mimicked the theta, beta, alpha, delta and other waves detected from its companion piece in Joel Rukowsi, coordinated the two feeds into impossible phase.Whatever the brain states, the output would seem shared.Its an amp, too, Southel told us.A stimulant.Pumps the anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex.Emp centres.She took the thing away and learnt it, tried to uncover what it was and did, to take it apart and build another.MagDa spent hours with her, focused her energies on the project.Theyre up to something, Bren said to me.MagDa.You can see theyve had an idea.Ez never said hed help us, but we didnt give him any choice, and his only resistance lay in sulking.He would obey us.Will you do it?I said to Bren that night.I spoke quietly.He looked away.It was at these times that I felt we could speak, when he was naked and I watched the night lights of the city now made carnival with biofires glaze him through his windows, his aging athletes body.No, he said.I dont want to.Im too old, too stuck.I dont even think I could.I know there arent many choices.I wouldnt be any good at it: Id say the wrong thing the wrong way.Whoever does this needs very very much to want to live, and I dont, enough.Dont be offended.Ive no death wish but nor do I have the necessary...verve.Yes, I know.Ez is Cut, it has to be a Turn speaker.Well, we can always go to the Ambassadors and find someone desperate enough to cut themselves off from their doppel.That might not be so hard now.Ill lay you money...He laughed at that, at how silly money had become.Ill bet there are some new cleaved for us to pick from.And somell be Turn.But you know, anyway, who were going to choose.He turned to me.It has to be Cal.Neither of us spoke.I didnt even look at him.What do we know about Ez and Ra?They werent doppels.But maybe what they did share was important.Hate.Were not training a new Ambassador, were distilling a drug.We have to replicate every ingredient we know about.We need the Turn to hate the Cut.A voice tearing itself apart.Alright, Ez came and ruined the world.So, sure, why wouldnt the Ambassadors hate him?Why wouldnt I?He smiled at me, beautifully.But Im tired of this place and I dont hate Joel Rukowsi enough, Avice.We need someone who does.Cal hasnt just lost his world, he lost his doppel.He hates Ez enough.Me, Id be weak tea.My question is, do you think Cal knows hell do it, yet?Probably, I thought.He must know what his duty would be: to become symbiont with the man who had destroyed his history, future and brother.BEFORE HE WENT into surgery the committee gathered for what we all knew was a valedictory in case.Cal was like some foul tempered birthday boy.He sought me out.Here, he said.He was right up in my face, and I stepped back and tried to say something neutral, but he was shoving something at me.You should...have this, he said.Sometimes you could hear him pause like that, waiting for Vin to finish a clause.He gave me the letter Vin had left.Youve read it, he said.You know what you meant to him.This is yours, not mine.Sort of to punish him for various things I didnt shrink back but actually took it.What the hell were you doing with Scile, all that time?I said.Youre asking about this now?Not back then, I said, coldly.Folded my arms.Not at the Festival of Lies.I know perfectly well what you did then, Cal.You...have no idea...he said slowly, why we did what we...had to  Oh Pharotekton spare me, I interrupted in a rush.Because I think I have in fact a pretty solid fucking idea whyif you dont know whats happening to Language how do you know whatll happen to Ambassadors, huh?But in point of fact even if thats not your whole story I do not care.I dont mean then, I mean now.Since all this started.Surl Tesh echers long gone, but you were spending time with Scile since EzRa arrived.And everything went...Whatve you been doing?You and, and Vin?Sciles always full of plans, he said.We did a lot of planning.He and I.  Vin...got something else out of it, I think.He regarded me.It was when hed read Sciles note that Vin had taken his own life.Irrespective of what Scile was in himself, what he wanted, Vin had found a community with himof some grief or loss or something.A fraternity of those whod once loved me, or still did?My stomach pitched.WHILE CAL was under anaesthetic, Ez began to panic and insist that he wouldnt do anything, that he wouldnt help us, that he couldnt, that it wouldnt work.I heard from one of the guards how MagDa had arrived in the middle of his little meltdown.Mag had stood by the door while Da walked over to where Ez was sitting, and leaned over and punched him in the face.Her knuckles split.Shed said Hold him, to the guards, and brought her bust up fist down on him again.Hed shouted and wriggled, his head cracking side to side.Joel had stared up at Mag and Da in the utterest astonishment, bloodily whooping with pain.Mag had said to him in a quite flat and calm voice, In fact you will speak Language with Cal.Youll learn how, and youll do it fast.And you wont disobey me or any other Staff or committee members again.I wasnt there but thats how I was told it happened.19  THE STRATEGYLESS onslaughts on our barricades continued.Our new town edges smelled bad, of Ariekene death.Our bricks rubbled around Host corpses.Our biorigged weapons were hungry and dying.Our Terretech ones were failing.Within days wed be fighting hand to giftwing.It was the usual siege stuff that would finish us: the ending of resources.No food came through the dedicated loops of colon that linked Embassytown to our subcontracted farms, now, and our stores were hardly infinite.We had no power from the Ariekene plants, and our own backups would fail.Id never been able to convince myself that there was no harm to it, but I couldnt stop nostalgia.Just then, looking down streets with angles not as wed have built them, which terminated or twisted in ways that still seemed almost playfully alien, toying with our teleologies, there was no way I couldnt remember when Id stared down them in my early life and systematically populated that out of sight city with every kind of childs impossibility and story.From there followed a quick run through of everything.Learning, sex, friends, work.Id never understood the injunction not to regret anything, couldnt see how that wasnt cowardice, but not only did I not regret the out, but nor, suddenly, did I the return.Nor even Scile.When I unhitched my attention and let it wander down out of reach streetswhich have been clocked before as yantras for reminiscenceit wasnt that I thought well of my husband; it was that in those moments I remembered what of him Id loved.I was spare with all that, rationed it.We tended our aeoli.The poor things had been relocated, their fleshly tethers cut and cauterised, with as little trauma as possible, but they were suffering.We had no Terretech that could replace them, and our air gardeners frantically protected the biomes of them and their companion things, which shaped currents, sustained our rough air dome.They strived to keep them safe, unhearing, charged by unaddictable technologies, as protected as possible from cross contamination, but despite all efforts we knew we might not be able to keep our breath machines from addiction or sickness, and no Host savants would help us now.As the aeoli wheezed, so would we, and the Ariekei would breach our defences and walk in.When theyd finished with us we would lie with the deads traditional lassitude, and the Ariekei would prod us and ask us forlornly to speak like EzRa.Either they would all die, then, or new generations would be born and start their culture again.They would perhaps construct rituals around our and their parents bones.These were the bad dreams we were having.It was into this landscape that god drug EzCal arrived.ID LEFT BREN and MagDa and others to the task of bullying and nurturing our last hope.Id preferred to oversee other duties, the movement of supplies and weaponry.Despite knowing that Cal was waking, that he was being reintroduced to Ez, that they were making their first attempts, that they were sitting the Stadt test, that the results were being calculated, I didnt ask what was happening.I even avoided Bren.Rumours spread that something was being made, that an autom had been perfected that could speak Language, that the Ambassadors and their friends were preparing a miab, would risk immer, to escape.We didnt leak the truth because it seemed too tentative.When EzCal did emerge into our newly nightmared town, I realised another reason we had said nothing: for the performance of it.A promise fulfilled may be a classic moment, but prophecies mean anticlimax.How much more awesome was an unexpected salvation?I couldnt avoid picking up information: when Cal was woken, when he was healed.Though I avoided what details I could, I knew before he and Ez emerged into the Embassy square that they would do so, and I was there ready.Everyone in Embassytown seemed to be there, in fact.There were even Kedis and Shurasi.I saw Wyatt, flanked by security, to both guard and secure him.There were automa too, Turingware struggling, so some of them expressed inappropriate bonhomie.I couldnt see Ehrsul.It was only with disappointment that I realised Id been looking.We were close enough to the borders of our shrunken town to hear the gusting of Ariekene attacks on the barriers, and the missiles and energies of repulses.Officers kept Embassytowners back from the Embassys entrance.It struck me that I must have chosen to cut myself off from what had been happening in the hospital so that I could experience this as nearly as possible a member of the crowd.I looked up at the other committee members, who were parting, and stepping forward was Cal, with Ez behind him.EzCal, one of the official escort shouted, and Christ help me someone in the crowd took it up and it became, briefly, a chant.Cal looked like something horrific, made worse in the moving glare of lights.His head was shaved, his scalp the palest part of his pale skin, the link on his neck shining.I think he was kept alert by some concoction of drugs: he moved in little insect bursts.His skull was crossed with dark sutures: big physical stitches, a crude technique, supposedly dictated by dwindling supplies of nanzymatic healers, but one that so exaggerated the spectacle I wondered how medically necessary it had really been.He stared into the crowd.He stared right at me, though Im certain he didnt see me.Joel Rukowsi was Ez again.Physically he was unmarked, but of the two he seemed the less alive.Cal spoke to him harshly.I couldnt hear the words.It was Ez who was the empathic, the receiver, who had to make this work.So I lost everything, Cal said into the crowd at last.Amplifiers carried his voice and everyone was quiet.I lost it all and I went down, into that lost place, and then when I realised that Embassytown needed me, I came back.When I realised it needed us...And he paused and I didnt breathe, but Ez stepped forward and said in a voice that was, unlike his face, strong, ...we came back.Applause.Ez looked down again.Cal licked his lips.Even the local birds all seemed to be in the plaza, watching.We came, Cal said, and let me show you...and after another heart stopping pause Ez muttered, ...what well do.They looked at each other, and I could suddenly see an echo of what must have been hours of preparation.They watched each others eyes and something happened.I imagined the pulses of the implants, hot synching them, pumping out into the universe the lie that they were the same.Ez the Cut speaker and Cal the Turn counted each other in and opened their mouths and spoke Language.When we heard them, even we, humans, let out gasps.I went away a time and now Ive returned.THE CITY WOKE.Even its dead parts shuddered.We all bloomed like flowers, too.Through the wires below our streets, past the barracks and barricades, at the speed of electricity under brick and tarmacked roads empty of Terre and picked through now by Ariekei suddenly still, into the kilometres of rotting architecture, the house beasts waiting for death, up and through the speakers.From scores of loudhailers came the voice of the new god drug, of ez/cal, and the city came out of hermetic miserable withdrawal ez into a new high.Thousands of eye corals craned; fanwings that had been slack suddenly flapped rigid and strained to capture vibrations; mouths opened.Flights of collapsed chitin stairs raised in tentative display, suddenly stronger with the onrush of chemical fix that came with that new voice.I went away a time and now Ive returned, and we heard the creak of reinflating skin, of flesh responding, metabolisms far faster than ours sucking on the junk energy it drew from the dissonance of EzCals Language.All the way to the horizon, the city, its zelles and its inhabitants, rose and found themselves wherever in their walking death theyd stumbled.Ariekene towers and gas raised dwellings woke over the edges of Embassytown, looked down at us, opened their ears and listened.The addicted city came out of its coma of need.Our guards and gunners shouted.They didnt know what they were seeing.Their quarries, the oratees, were suddenly still and listening.There was to be nothing more about Joel Rukowsis life, it was clear.This was Cals script, not Ezs.In several different ways, varying the shape of the sentences so the Language wouldnt lose its efficacy, he and Ez repeated that EzCal had come to speak.Embassytowners were crying.We knew we might live.We would have to re establish ways of communicating our needs to the Ariekei, and working out what we offered.Somewhere in that city now trying to rouse itself there must be those Hosts with which we had established understandings, which might now be able to take some kind of control again, with which we could deal.It wouldnt be a healthy polity.A few in control of their addiction would rule over those not, compradors at our behest: a narcocracy of language.Wed have to be careful pushers of our product.Bren was on the stairs, and I waved, pushed through the crowd to him.
