He dived.He forced his way down, past the wreckage of the crushed seat Mipp had died in, and past the twisted panels of light metal which had made up the bulkhead.He could see light, vaguely green grey, forming a rectangle beneath him.Air trapped in his suit bubbled round him, along his legs, upwards to his feet.He was slowed for a moment, buoyed up by the air in his boots, and for a second he thought he wasn't going to make it, that he was going to hang there upside down and drown.Then the air bubbled out through the holes in his boots punched there by Lamm's laser, and Horza sank.He struggled down through the water to the rectangle of light, then swam through the open rear doors and into the shimmering green depths of the water under the shuttle; he kicked and went up, breaking out into the waves with a gasp, sucking warm, fresh air into his lungs.He felt his eyes adjust to the slanted but still bright sunlight of late afternoon.He grabbed hold of the shuttle's dented, punctured nose  sticking above the water by about two metres  and looked around, trying to see the island, but without success.Still just treading water and letting his battered body and brain recover, Horza watched the up tilted nose of the craft sink lower in the water and tip slowly forward so that the shuttle gradually floated almost level in the waves, its top surface just awash.The Changer, his arm muscles straining and hurting, eventually hauled himself onto the top of the shuttle, and lay there like a beached fish.He started to shut off the pain signals, like a weary servant picking up the litter of breakables after an employer's destructive rage.It was only lying there, with small waves washing over the top surface of the shuttle's fuselage, that he realised that all the water he had been coughing up and swallowing was fresh.It hadn't occurred to him that the Circlesea would be anything other than salt, like most planetary oceans, but in fact there was not even the slightest tang of it, and he congratulated himself that at least he would not die of thirst.He stood up carefully, in the centre of the shuttle roof, waves breaking round his feet.He looked around, and could see the island  just.It looked very small and far away in the early evening light, and, while there was a faint warm breeze blowing more or less towards the island, he had no idea which way any currents might be taking him.He sat down, then lay back, letting the waters of the Circlesea wash over the flat surface beneath him and break in small lines of surf against his much damaged suit.After a while he just fell asleep, not really meaning to, but not stopping himself when he realised that he was, telling himself to sleep for only an hour or so.He woke up to see the sun, though still high in the sky, looking dark red as it shone through the layers of dust above the distant Edgewall.He got to his feet again; the shuttle didn't seem to have sunk any lower in the water.The island was still far away, but it looked a little nearer than it had earlier; the currents, or the winds, such as they were, seemed to be carrying him in roughly the right direction.He sat down again.The air was still warm.He thought of taking the suit off but decided against it; it was uncomfortable but perhaps he would get too cold without it.He lay back again.He wondered where Yalson was now.Had she survived Lamm's bomb, and the wreck?He hoped so.He thought she probably had; he couldn't imagine her dead, or dying.It was little enough to go on, and he refused to believe he was superstitious, but not being able to imagine her dead was somehow comforting.She'd survive.Take more than a tactical nuke and a billion tonne ship impacting a berg the size of a small continent to polish that girl off He found himself smiling, remembering her.He would have spent more time thinking about Yalson, but there was something else he had to think about as well.Tonight he would Change.It was all he could do.Probably by now it was irrelevant.Kraiklyn was either dead or  if surviving  unlikely ever to meet Horza again, but the Changer had prepared for the transformation; his body was waiting for it, and he could think of nothing better to do.The situation, he told himself, was far from hopeless.He wasn't badly injured, he seemed to be heading for the island, where the shuttle might still be, and if he could make it in time there was always Evanauth, and that Damage game.Anyway, the Culture might be looking for him by now, so it wouldn't do to keep the same identity for too long.What the hell, he thought; he would Change.He would go to sleep as the Horza the others knew him as, and he would wake up as a copy of the captain of the Clear Air Turbulence.He prepared his bruised and aching body for the alteration as best he could: relaxing muscles and readying glands and groups of cells; sending deliberate signals from brain to body and face through nerves that only Changers possessed.He watched the sun, dimming through red stages somewhere low over the ocean.Now he would sleep; sleep, and become Kraiklyn; take on yet another identity, another shape to add to the many he had assumed already during his life  Maybe there was no point, maybe he was only taking this new shape on to die in.But, he thought, What have I got to lose?Horza watched the falling, darkening red eye of the sun until he entered the sleep of Changing, and in that Changing trance, though his eyes were closed, and beneath their lids also altering, he seemed to see that dying glare still   Animal eyes.Predator's eyes.Caged behind them, looking out.Never sleeping, being three people.Ownership; rifle and ship and Company.Not much yet maybe, but one day with just a little, little luck, no more than everybody else had a right to one day he would show them.He knew how good he was, he knew what he was fit for, and who was fit for him.The rest were just tokens; they were his because they were under his command; it was his ship, after all.The women especially  just game pieces.They could come and go and he didn't care.All you had to do with any of them was share their danger and they thought you were wonderful.They couldn't see that for him there was no danger; he had a lot left to do in life, he knew he wasn't going to die some stupid, squalid little combat death.The galaxy, one day, would know his name, and either mourn him or curse him, when eventually he did have to die He hadn't decided yet whether it would be mourn or curse maybe it depended on how the galaxy treated him in the meantime All he needed was the tiniest break, just the sort of thing the others had had, the leaders of the bigger, more successful, better known, more feared and respected Free Companies.They must have had them They might seem greater than he was now, but one day they would look up to him; everybody would.All would know his name: Kraiklyn!Horza woke in the dawn light, still lying on the wave washed shuttle roof, like something washed up and spread upon a table.He was half awake, half asleep.It was colder, the light was thinner and more blue, but nothing else had changed.He started to drift back to sleep again, away from pain and lost hopes.Nothing else had changed only him   He had to swim for the island.He had woken for the second time the same morning, feeling different, better, rested.The sun was angling up and out of the overhead haze.The island was closer, but he was going past it.The currents were taking him and the shuttle away now, having swept no closer than two kilometres to the group of reefs and sandbanks round the isle.He cursed himself for sleeping so long.He got out of the suit  it was useless now and deserved to be ditched  and left it lying on the still just awash shuttle roof.He was hungry, his stomach rumbled, but he felt fit and ready for the swim.He estimated it was about three kilometres.He dived in and struck out powerfully.His right leg hurt where he'd been hit by Lamm's laser and his body still ached in places, but he could do it; he knew he could.He looked back once, after he'd swum for a few minutes.He could see the suit but not the shuttle.The empty suit was like the abandoned cocoon of some metamorphosed animal, riding opened and empty, seeming just above the surface of the waves behind.He turned away and kept swimming.The island came closer, but very slowly.The water was warm at first, but it seemed to get colder, and the aches in his body increased.He ignored them, switching them off, but he could feel himself slowing, and he knew that he'd started off too fast.He paused, treading water for a moment; then, after drinking a little of the warm fresh water, set off again, stroking more deliberately and steadily for the grey tower of the distant island.He told himself how lucky he'd been.The shuttle crash hadn't injured him badly  though the aches still plagued him, like noisy relatives locked in a distant room, disturbing his concentration.The warm water, though apparently getting colder, was fresh, so that he could drink from it and wouldn't dehydrate; yet it crossed his mind that he would have been more buoyant had it been salty.He kept going.It ought to have been easy but it was getting more difficult all the time.He stopped thinking about it; he concentrated on moving; the slow, steady, rhythmic beat of arms and legs forcing him through the water; up waves, over, down; up, over, down.Under my own power, he told himself, under my own power.The mountain on the island grew larger very slowly.He felt as though he was building it, as though the effort required to make it appear larger in his sight was the same as if he was toiling to construct that peak; heap it up rock by rock, with his own hands  Two kilometres.Then one.The sun angled, rose.Eventually, the outer reefs and shallows; he passed them in a daze, into shallower water.A sea of aching.An ocean of exhaustion.He swam towards the beach, through a fan of waves and surf radiating from the reef gap he'd swum through   and felt as though he'd never taken the suit off, as though he wore it still, and it was stiff with rust or age, or filled with heavy water or wet sand; dragging, stiffening, pulling him back.He could hear waves breaking on the beach, and when he looked up he could see people on it: thin dark people, dressed in rags, gathered round tents and fires or walking between them.Some were in the water ahead of him, carrying baskets, large open work baskets which they held on their waists, gathering things from the sea as they waded through it, putting what they collected in their baskets.They hadn't seen him, so he swam on, making a slow, crawling motion with his arms and kicking feebly with his legs.The people harvesting the sea didn't appear to notice him; they kept on wading through the surf, stooping occasionally to pick from the sands underneath, their eyes sweeping and probing, scanning and searching, but too close in; not seeing him.His stroke slowed to a gasping, dying crawl.He could not lift his hands free of the water, and his legs stayed paralysed  Then through the surf noise, like something from a dream, he heard several people shouting nearby, and splashes coming close.He was still swimming weakly when another wave lifted him, and he saw several of the skinny people clad in loincloths and tattered tunics, wading through the water towards him.They helped Horza in through the breaking waves, over sun streaked shallows and onto the golden sands.He lay there while the thin and haggard people crowded round.They talked quietly to each other in a language he hadn't heard before.He tried to move but couldn't.His muscles felt like lengths of limp rag."Hello," he croaked.He tried it in all the languages he knew, but none seemed to work.He looked into the faces of the people around him.They were human, but that word covered so many different species throughout the galaxy it was a continuing subject for debate who was and who wasn't human.As in all too many matters, the consensus of opinion was starting to resemble what the Culture had to say on the subject.The Culture would lay down the law (except, of course, that the Culture didn't have any real laws) about what being human was, or how intelligent a particular species was (while at the same time making clear that pure intelligence didn't really mean much on its own), or on how long people should live (though only as a rough guide, naturally), and people would accept these things without question, because everybody believed the Culture's own propaganda, that it was fair, unbiased, disinterested, concerned only with absolute truth and so on.So were these people around him really human?They were about Horza's height, they seemed to have roughly the same bone structure, bilateral symmetry and respiratory system; and their faces  though each was different  all had eyes, mouth, nose and ears.But they all looked thinner than they ought to have been, and their skin, regardless of hue or shade, looked somehow diseased.Horza lay still.He felt very heavy again, but at least he was on dry land.On the other hand, it didn't look as though there was much food on the island, judging by the state of the bodies around him.He assumed that was why they were so thin.He raised his head weakly and tried to see through the clumps of thin legs towards the shuttle craft he had seen earlier.He could just see the top of the machine, sticking up above one of the large canoes beached on the sands.Its rear doors were open.A smell wafted under Horza's nose and made him feel sick.He put his head down onto the sand again, exhausted.The talking stopped and the people turned, their thin, tanned or anyway dark bodies shuffling round to face up the beach.A space opened in their ranks just above Horza's head, and try as he might he couldn't get up on one elbow or swivel his head to see what or who was coming.He lay and waited, then the people to his right all drew back and a line of eight men appeared on that side, holding a long pole together in their left hands, their other arms stuck out for balance.It was the litter he had seen being carried into the jungle the day before, when the shuttle had overflown the island.He watched to see what it held.Two lines of men turned the litter so that it faced Horza and set it down.Then all sixteen sat down, looking exhausted.Horza stared.On the litter sat the most enormous, obscenely fat human Horza had ever seen.He had mistaken the giant for a pyramid of golden sand the previous day, when he had seen the litter and its huge burden from the CAT's shuttle.Now he could see that his first impression had been close in shape if not in substance.Whether the vast cone of human flesh belonged to a male or a female Horza couldn't tell; great mammary like folds of naked flesh spilled from the creature's upper and middle chest, but they drooped over even more enormous waves of nude, hairless torso fat, which lay partly cradled in the vast beefs of the giant's akimboed legs and partly overflowing those to droop into the canvas surface of the litter.Horza could see no stitch of clothing on the monster, but no trace of genitals either; whatever they were, they were quite buried under rolls of golden brown flesh.Horza looked up to the head.Rising from a thick cone of neck, gazing out over concentric ramparts of chins, a bald dome of puffy flesh contained a limp and rambling length of pale lips, a small button nose, and slits where eyes must be.The head sat on its layers of neck, shoulder and chest fat like a great golden bell on top of a many decked temple.The sweat glistened giant suddenly moved its hands, rolling them round on the end of the bloated fat bound balloons of its arms, until the merely chubby fingers met and clasped as tightly as their size would allow.As the mouth opened to speak, another one of the skinny humans, his rags slightly less tattered than those of the others, moved into Horza's field of vision, just behind and to the side of the giant.The bell of head moved a few centimetres to one side and swivelled round, saying something to the man behind that Horza couldn't catch.Then the giant raised his or her arms with obvious effort and gazed round the skinny humans gathered around Horza.The voice sounded like congealing fat being poured into a jug; it was a drowning voice, Horza thought, like something from a nightmare.He listened, but couldn't understand the language being used.He looked round to see what effect the giant's words were having on the famished looking crowd.His head spun for a moment, as though his brain had shifted while his skull stayed still; he was suddenly back in the hangar of the Clear Air Turbulence, when the Company had been looking at him, and he had felt as naked and vulnerable as he did now."Oh, not again," he moaned in Marain."Oh hoo!"said the golden rolls of flesh, the voice tumbling over the slopes of fat in a faltering series of tones."Gracious!Our bounty from the sea speaks!"The hairless dome of head turned further round to the man standing by its side."Mr First, isn't this wonderful?"the giant burbled."Fate is kind to us, Prophet," the man said gruffly."Fate favours the beloved, yes, Mr First.It sends our enemies away and brings us bounty  bounty from the sea!Fate be praised!"The great pyramid of flesh shook as the arms went higher, trailing folds of paler flesh as the turret like head went back, the mouth opening to expos a dark space where only a few small fangs glinted like steel.When the bubbling voice spoke again it was in the language Horza couldn't make out, but it was the same phrase repeated over and over again.The giant was quickly joined by the rest of the crowd, who shook their hands in the air and chanted hoarsely.Horza closed his eyes, trying to wake from what he knew was not a dream.When he opened his eyes the skinny humans were still chanting, but they were crowded around him again, blocking out his view of the golden brown monster.Their faces eager, their teeth bared, their hands stretched out like claws, the crowd of starving, chanting humans fell on him.They stripped off his shorts.He tried to struggle, but they held him down.In his exhaustion he was probably no stronger than anyone of them, and they had no difficulty pinning him; they rolled him over, pulled his hands behind him and tied them there.Then they tied his feet together and pulled his legs back until his feet were almost touching his hands, and bound them to his wrists by a short length of rope.Naked, trussed like an animal ready for the slaughter, Horza was dragged across the hot sand, past a weakly burning fire, then hauled upright and lowered over a short pole stuck into the beach, so that it ran up between his back and his tied limbs.His knees sank into the sand, taking most of his weight.The fire burned in front of him, sending acrid wood smoke into his eyes, and the awful smell returned; it seemed to come from various pots and bowls spread around the fire.Other fires and collections of pans were littered across the beach.The huge pile of flesh the man named Mr First had called prophet was set down near the fire.Mr First stood at the obese human's side, staring at Horza through deep set eyes contained within a pale and grubby face.The golden giant on the litter clapped chubby hands together and said, "Stranger, gift of the sea, welcome.I am the great prophet Fwi Song. "The vast creature spoke a crude form of Marain.Horza opened his mouth to tell them his name, but Fwi Song continued."You have been sent to us in our time of testing, a morsel of human flesh on the tide of nothingness, a harvest thing plucked from the tasteless wash of life, a sweetmeat to share and be shared in our victory over the poisonous bile of disbelief!You are a sign from Fate, for which we give thanks!"Fwi Song's huge arms lifted up; rolls of shoulder fat wobbled on either side of the turret like head, nearly covering the ears.Fwi Song shouted out in a language Horza didn't know, and the crowd echoed the phrase, chanting it several times.The fat smothered arms were lowered again."You are the salt of the sea, ocean gift. "Fwi Song's syrupy voice changed back into Marain once more."You are a sign, a blessing from Fate; you are the one to become many, the single to be shared; yours will be the gaining gift, the blessed beauty of transubstantiation!"Horza stared, horrified, at the golden giant, unable to think of anything to say.What could you say to people like this?Horza cleared his throat, still hoping to say something, but Fwi Song went on."Be told then, gift of the sea, that we are the Eaters; the Eaters of ashes, the Eaters of filth, the Eaters of sand and tree and grass; the most basic, the most loved, the most real.We have laboured to prepare ourselves for our day of testing, and now that day is gloriously near!"The golden skinned prophet's voice grew shrill; folds of fat shook as Fwi Song's arms opened out."Behold us then, as we await the time of our ascension from this mortal plane, with empty bellies and voided bowels and hungry minds!"Fwi Song's pudgy hands met in a slap; the fingers interweaved like huge, fattened maggots."If I can " croaked Horza, but the giant was talking to the crowd of grubby people again, the voice bubbling out over the golden sands and the cooking fires and the dull, malnourished people.Horza shook his head a little and looked out over the expanse of beach to the open doored shuttle in the distance.The more he looked at the craft, the more certain he became it was a Culture machine.It was nothing he could pin down, but he grew more certain with every moment spent looking at the machine.He guessed it was a forty  or fifty seater; just about big enough to take all the people he had seen on the island.It didn't look particularly new or fast, and it didn't look armed at all, but something about the whole way its simple, utilitarian form had been put together spoke of the Culture.If the Culture designed an animal drawn cart or an automobile, they would still share something in common with the device at the far end of the beach, for all the gulf of time between the epochs each represented.It would have helped if the Culture had used some sort of emblem or logo; but, pointlessly unhelpful and unrealistic to the last, the Culture refused to place its trust in symbols.It maintained that it was what it was and had no need for such outward representation.The Culture was every single individual human and machine in it, not one thing.Just as it could not imprison itself with laws, impoverish itself with money or misguide itself with leaders, so it would not misrepresent itself with signs.All the same, the Culture did have one set of symbols it was very proud of, and Horza didn't doubt that if the machine he was looking at was a Culture craft, it would have some Marain writing on or in it somewhere.Was it in some way connected with the mass of flesh still talking to the scrawny humans around the fire?Horza doubted it.Fwi Song's Marain was shaky and ill tutored.Horza's own grasp of the language was far from perfect, but he knew enough about the tongue to realise Fwi Song did it some violence when he or she used it.Anyway, the Culture was not in the habit of loaning out its vehicles to religious nutcases.Was it here to evacuate them, then?Lift them to safety when the Culture's high technology shit hit the rotating fan that was the Vavatch Orbital?With a sinking feeling, Horza realised this was probably the answer.So there was no escape.Either these crazies sacrificed him or did whatever it was they were set on doing to him, or it was a ride into captivity, courtesy of the Culture.He told himself not to assume the worst.After all, he now looked like Kraiklyn, and it wasn't that likely the Culture's Minds had made all the correct connections between him, the CAT and Kraiklyn.Even the Culture didn't think of everything.But they probably did know he'd been on The Hand of God 137; they probably did know he'd escaped from it; they probably did know that the CAT was in that volume at the time.(He recalled the statistics Xoralundra had quoted to the Hand's captain; yes, the GCU must have won the battle He remembered the CAT's rough running warp motors; probably producing a wake any self respecting GCU could track from centuries away) Damn it; he wouldn't put it past them.Maybe they were testing everybody they were picking up from Vavatch.They would know in seconds, from just a single sample cell; a skin flake, a hair; for all he knew he'd been sampled already, a micromissile sent from the nearby shuttle picking up some tiny piece of tissue He dropped his head, his neck muscles aching with all the others in his battered, bruised, exhausted body.Stop it, he told himself.Thinking like a failure.Too damn sorry for yourself.Get yourself out of this.Still got your teeth and your nails and your brain.Just bide your time  "For lo," Fwi Song warbled, "the godless ones, the most hated, the despised by the despised, the Atheists, the Anathematics, have sent us this instrument of the Nothingness, the Vacuum, to us" As the giant said those words Horza looked up and saw Fwi Song point along the beach to the shuttle."But we shall not waver in our faith!We shall resist the lure of the Nothingness between the stars where the godless ones, the Anathematised of the Vacuum exist!We shall stay part of what is a part of us!We shall not treat with the great Blasphemy of the Material.We shall stand as the rocks and trees stand  firm, rooted, secure, staunch, unyielding!"Fwi Song's arms went out again, and the voice bellowed out.The gruff voiced man with the dirty pale skin shouted something at the seated crowd, and they shouted back.The prophet smiled at Horza from across the fire.Fwi Song's mouth was a dark hole, with four small fangs protruding when the lips formed a smile.They shone in the sunlight."This the way you treat all your guests?"Horza said, trying not to cough until the end of his sentence.He cleared his throat.Fwi Song's smile vanished."Guest you are not, sea wanton, salt gift.Prize: ours to keep, mine to use.Bounty from the sea and the sun and the wind, brought to us by Fate.Hee hee. "Fwi Song's smile returned with a girlish giggle, and one of the huge hands went to cover the pale lips, "Fate recognises its prophet, sends him tasty treats!Just when some of my flock were having second thoughts, too!Eh, Mr First?"The turret head turned to the thin figure of the paler man, standing with arms folded, by the giant's side.Mr First nodded:  "Fate is our gardener, and our wolf.It weeds out the weak to honour the strong.So the prophet has spoken. ""And the word which dies in the mouth lives in the ear," Fwi Song said, turning the huge head back to look at Horza.At least, Horza thought, now I know it's a male.For whatever that's worth."Mighty Prophet," Mr First said.Fwi Song smiled wider but continued looking at Horza.Mr First went on, "The sea gift should see the fate that awaits him.Perhaps the treacherous coward Twenty seventh "  "Oh, yes!"Fwi Song clapped his huge hands together and a smile lit up his whole face.For a second Horza thought he saw small white eyes beyond the slits staring at him."Oh let's, yes!Bring the coward, let us do what must be done. "Mr First spoke in ringing tones to the emaciated humans gathered around the fire.A few stood up and walked off behind Horza, towards the forest.The rest started singing and chanting.After a few minutes Horza heard a scream, then a series of yells and screams, gradually coming closer.At last the people who had left came back, carrying a short, thick log, much like the one Horza was held by.Swinging on the pole was a young man, screaming, shouting in the language Horza didn't understand, and struggling.Horza saw drops of sweat and saliva fall from the young man's face and spot the sand.The log was sharpened at one end; that point was driven into the sand on the opposite side of the fire from Horza, so that the young man faced the Changer."This, my libation from the seas," Fwi Song said to Horza, pointing at the young man, who was quivering and moaning, his eyes rolling about in their sockets and his lips dribbling, "this is my naughty boy; called Twenty seventh, since his rebirth.This was one of our respected, much loved sons, one of our anointed, one of our fellow morsels, one of our brotherly taste buds on the great tongue of life. "Fwi Song's voice chortled with laughter as he spoke, as though he knew the absurdity of the part he was playing and couldn't resist hamming it up."This splinter from our tree, this grain from our beach, this reprobate dared to run towards the seven times cursed vehicle of the Vacuum.He spurned the gift of burden with which we honoured him; he chose to abandon us and flee across the sands when the alien enemy passed over us yesterday.He did not trust our salving grace, but turned instead to an instrument of darkness and nothingness, towards the soaking shade of the soulless ones, the Anathematics. "Fwi Song looked at the man, still shaking on the post across the fire from Horza.The prophet's face went stern with reproach."By the workings of Fate the traitor who ran from our side and put his prophet's life at risk was caught  so that he might learn his sad mistake, and make good his terrible crime. "Fwi Song's arm dropped.The vast head shook.Mr First shouted to the people round the fire.They faced the young man called Twenty seventh and chanted.The ghastly smells Horza had sensed earlier came back, making his eyes mist and his nose tingle.While the people chanted and Fwi Song watched, Mr First and two of the women followers dug up small sacks from the sand.Out of them they brought some thin lengths of cloth which they proceeded to wrap round their bodies.As Mr First put his vestments on, Horza saw a large, cumbersome looking projectile pistol, held in a string holster beneath the man's grubby tunic.Horza presumed that was the gun fired at the shuttle the day before, when he and Mipp had overflown the island.The young man opened his eyes, saw the three people in their cloths and started screaming."Hear how the stricken soul cries out for its lesson, pleads for its bounty of regret, its solace of refreshing suffering," Fwi Song smiled, looking at Horza."Our child Twenty seventh knows what awaits him, and while his body, already proved so weak, breaks before the storm, his soul cries out, "Yes!Yes!Mighty Prophet!Succour me!Make me part of you!Give me your strength!Come to me!"Is it not a sweet and uplifting sound?"Horza looked into the prophet's eyes and said nothing.The young man went on screaming and trying to tear himself away from the stump.Mr First was crouched before him, on his knees, his head bowed, muttering to himself.The two women dressed in the dull cloth were preparing bowls of steaming liquid from the vats and pots around the fire, warming some over the flames.The smells came to Horza, turning his stomach.Fwi Song switched to the other language and spoke to the two women.They looked at Horza, then came up to him with the bowls.Horza drew his head away as they shoved the containers under his nose.He wrinkled his face up in disgust at what looked and smelled like fish entrails in a sauce of excrement.The women took the awful stuff away; it left a stink in his nose.He tried breathing through his mouth.The young man's mouth had been wedged open with blocks of wood, and his choking screams altered in pitch.While Mr First held him, the women ladled the liquids from the bowls into his mouth.The young man spluttered and wailed, choked and tried to spit.He moaned, then threw up."Let me show you my armoury, my benefaction," Fwi Song said to Horza, and reached behind his vast body.He brought back a large bundle of rags, which he startled to unfold.Glittering in the sunlight, metal devices like tiny man traps were revealed.Fwi Song put one finger to his lips while he surveyed the collection, then picked up one of the small metal contraptions.He put it into his mouth, fitting both pans over the pins Horza had seen earlier."Zhare," Fwi Song said, raising his mouth in a broad smile towards the Changer."What'oo you shink of zhat?"The artificial teeth sparkled in his mouth; rows of sharp, serrated points."Or zhese?"Fwi Song swapped them for another set, full of tiny fangs like needles, then another, with angled teeth like hooks with barbs, then another, with holes set in them."Goo', eh?"He smiled at Horza, leaving the last pair in.He turned to Mr First.Wha you shink, Nishtur Shursht?Ehs?Or" Fwi Song took out the set with the holes, put in another set, like long, blade like spades."Zheze?A "ink eeg a rar ah nishe.Esh, rert ush zhtart wish eez.Ret's punish zhoze naughty tootsiesh. "Twenty seventh's voice was becoming hoarse.One of his legs was lifted out in front of him and held by four kneeling men.Fwi Song was lifted and carried on the liner to just in front of the young man; he bared the blade teeth, then leaned forward and with a quick; nodding motion, bit off one of Twenty seventh's toes.Horza looked away.In the next half hour or so of leisurely paced eating, the enormous prophet nibbled at various bits of Twenty seventh's body, attacking the extremities and the few remaining fat deposits with his various sets of teeth.The young man gained fresh breath with each new site of butchery.Horza watched and didn't watch, sometimes trying to think himself into a kind of defiance that would let him work out a way to get back at this grotesque distortion of a human being, at other times just wanting the whole awful business to be over and done with.Fwi Song left his ex disciple's fingers until last, then used the teeth with the holes in like wire strippers.  ""Ery "asty," he said, wiping his blood stained face with one gigantic forearm.Twenty seventh was cut down, moaning, covered in streaks of blood, and only semi conscious.He was gagged with a length of rag, then pinned down flat, face up, on the sand, wooden spikes through the palms of his mangled hands and a huge boulder crushing his feet.He started screaming weakly again through the gag when he saw the prophet Fwi Song on his litter being carried over towards him.Fwi Song was lowered almost on top of the moaning form, then he struggled with some cords at the side of his litter until a small flap under his great bulk flopped open, over the face of the gagged, blood spattered human on the sand beneath.The prophet gave a sign, and he was lowered on top of the man, quieting the sound of moaning.The prophet smiled, and settled himself with little movements of his huge body, like a bird nestling down over its eggs.His vast bulk obliterating all trace or shape of the human under him, Fwi Song hummed to himself while the emaciated crowd looked on, singing very slowly and quietly, swaying together as they stood.Fwi Song started to rock backwards and forwards softly, very slowly at first, then faster as sweat appeared in beads on the golden dome of his face.He panted, and made a rough gesture towards the crowd; the two women dressed in the lengths of cloth came forward and started to lick at the trickles of blood which had spilled from the prophet's mouth, over the folds of his chins and down the expanse of his chest and breasts like red milk.Fwi Song gasped, seemed to sag and stay still for a moment, and then, with a surprisingly fast and fierce motion, clouted both the lapping women across the head with his mighty arms.The women scurried off, rejoining the crowd.Mr First started a louder chant, which the others took up.At last Fwi Song ordered himself to be lifted again.The litter bearers hauled his massive frame into the air, to reveal the crushed body of Twenty seventh, his moaning silenced for ever.They lifted him out, beheaded the corpse and removed the top of the skull.They ate his brains, and it was only then that Horza threw up."And now we are become each other," Fwi Song intoned solemnly to the youth's hollow head, then threw its bloody bowl over his shoulder into the fire.The rest of the body was taken down to the sea and thrown in."Only ceremony and the love of Fate distinguish us from the beasts, o mark of Fate's devotion," Fwi Song warbled to Horza as the prophet's vast body was cleaned and perfumed by the attendant women.Tied to his post, stuck in the ground, his mouth fouled, Horza breathed carefully and deliberately, and did not try to reply.Twenty seventh's body floated slowly out to sea.Fwi Song was towelled down.The skinny humans sat about listlessly, or tended the awful smelling liquid in the bubbling vats.Mr First and his two women helpers took off their lengths of cloth, leaving the man in his grimy but whole tunic and the women in their tattered rags.Fwi Song had his litter placed on the sand in front of Horza."See, bounty from the waves, harvest from the rolling ocean, my people prepare to break their fast. "The prophet swept one fat wobbling arm about to indicate the people tending the fires and cauldrons.The smell of rotting food filled the air."They eat what others leave, what others will not touch, because they want to be closer to the fabric of Fate.They eat the bark from the trees and the grass from the ground and the moss from the rocks; they eat the sand and the leaves and the roots and the earth; they eat the shells and the entrails of sea animals and the carrion of the land and the ocean; they eat their bodily products and share mine.I am the fount.I am the well spring, the taste on their tongues."You, bubble of froth on the ocean of life, are a sign.Crop of the ocean, you will come to see, before the time of your unmaking, that you are all you have eaten, and that food is merely undigested excrement.This I have seen; this you will see. "One of the attendant women came back from the sea with Fwi Song's freshly cleaned sets of teeth.He took them from her and put them in the rags somewhere behind him."All shall fall but we, all go to their deaths, their unmakings.We alone will be made in our unmaking, brought into the glory of our ultimate consummation. "The prophet sat smiling at Horza, while around him  as the long afternoon's shadows drew out across the sands  the emaciated, ill looking people sat down to their foul meals.Horza watched them try to eat.Some did, encouraged by Mr First, but most could keep nothing down.They gasped for breath and gulped at the liquids, but often as not they vomited up what they had just forced down.Fwi Song looked on them sadly, shaking his head."You see, even my closest children are not ready yet.We must pray and entreat that they are ready when the time comes, as it must, in a few days" time.We must hope that their bodies" lack of grasp, of sympathy with all things, will not make them despised in the eyes and mouth of God. "You fat bastard.You're within range, if you only knew.I could blind you from here; spit in your little eyes and maybe  But, Horza thought, maybe not.The giant's eyes were set so deep within the flabby skin of his brows and cheeks that even the venomous spittle with which Horza could have hit the golden monster might not find its way to the membranes of the eye.But it was all Horza could find to give him solace in his situation.He could spit at the prophet, and that was it.Perhaps there would come a point when it might make some difference, but to do it now would be stupid.A blind, enraged Fwi Song struck Horza as something to try to avoid even more than a sighted, tittering one.Fwi Song talked on to Horza, never questioning, never really stopping, repeating himself more and more often.He told him about his revelations and his past life; as a circus freak, then as a palace pet for some alien satrap on a Megaship, then as a convert to a fashionable religion on another Megaship, his revelation occurring there, when he persuaded a few converts to join him on an island to await the End of All Things.More followers had arrived when the Culture announced what the fate of the Vavatch Orbital was going to be.Horza was only half listening, his mind racing as he tried to think of a way out.   "We await the end of all things, the last day.We prepare ourselves for our final consummation by mixing the fruits of earth and sea and death with our fragile bodies of flesh and blood and bone.You are our sign, our aperitif, our scent.You must feel honoured. ""Mighty Prophet," Horza said, swallowing hard and doing his best to keep his voice calm.Fwi Song stopped talking, the eyes narrowing still further and a frown forming.Horza went on, "I am indeed your sign.I bring you myself; I am the follower the disciple numbered Last.I come to rid you of the machine from the Vacuum. "Horza looked over at the Culture shuttle, sitting with its rear doors open at the far end of the beach."I know how to remove this source of temptation.Let me prove to you my devotion by performing this small service for your great and majestic self.Then you will know I am your last and most faithful servant: the one numbered Last, the one come before the unmaking, to to steel your followers for the test to come and remove the Anathematics" temptation device.I have mixed with the stars and the air and ocean, and I bring you this message, this deliverance. "Horza stopped there, his throat and lips dry, his eyes running as the highly spiced stench of the Eaters" food drifted on a light breeze around him.Fwi Song sat quite still on his litter, looking into Horza's face with his slit eyes narrowed and his bulbous brows creased."Mr First!"Fwi Song said, turning to where the pale skinned man in the tunic was massaging one of the Eaters" bellies while the unfortunate follower lay moaning on the ground.Mr First rose and came over to the giant prophet, who nodded at Horza and spoke in the language the Changer couldn't understand.Mr First bowed slightly, then went behind Horza, taking something from under his tunic as he went out of the Changer's field of view.Horza's heart thudded.He looked desperately back at Fwi Song.What had the prophet said?What was Mr First going to do?Hands appeared over Horza's head, gripping something.The Changer closed his eyes.A rag was tied tightly over his mouth.It smelled of the foul food.His head was forced back against the stake.Then Mr First went back to the prone, groaning Eater.Horza stared at Fwi Song, who said:  "There.Now, as I was saying"  Horza didn't listen.The fat prophet's cruel faith was little different from a million others; only the degree of its barbarity made it unusual in these supposedly civilised times.Another side effect of the war, maybe; blame the Culture.Fwi Song talked, but there was no point in listening.Horza recalled that the Culture's attitude to somebody who believed in an omnipotent God was to pity them, and to take no more notice of the substance of their faith than one would take of the ramblings of somebody claiming to be Emperor of the Universe.The nature of the belief wasn't totally irrelevant  along with the person's background and upbringing, it might tell you something about what had gone wrong with them  but you didn't take their views seriously.That was the way Horza felt about Fwi Song.He had to treat him as the maniac he obviously was.The fact that his insanity was dressed in religious trappings meant nothing.No doubt the Culture would disagree, claiming that there was ample common ground between insanity and religious belief, but then what else could you expect from the Culture?The Idirans knew better, and Horza, while not agreeing with everything the Idirans stood for, respected their beliefs.Their whole way of life, almost their every thought, was illuminated, guided and governed by their single religion/philosophy: a belief in order, place and a kind of holy rationality.They believed in order because they had seen so much of its opposite, first in their own planetary background, taking part in the extraordinarily fierce evolutionary contest on Idir, and then  when they finally entered into the society of their local stellar cluster  around them, between and amongst other species.They had suffered because of that lack of order; they had died by the millions in stupid, greed inspired wars in which they became involved through no fault of their own.They had been naive and innocent, over dependent on others thinking in the same calm, rational way they always did.They believed in the destiny of place.Certain individuals would always belong in certain places  the high ground, the fertile lands, the temperate isles  whether they had been born there or not; and the same applied to tribes, clans and races (and even to species; most of the ancient holy texts had proved sufficiently flexible and vague to cope with the discovery that the Idirans were not alone in the universe.The texts which had claimed otherwise were promptly ditched, and their authors were first ritually cursed and then thoroughly forgotten).At its most mundane, the belief could be expressed as the certainty that there was a place for everything, and everything ought to be in its place.Once everything was in its place, God would be happy with the universe, and eternal peace and joy would replace the current chaos.The Idirans saw themselves as agents in this great reordering.They were the chosen  at first allowed the peace to understand what God desired, and then goaded into action rather than contemplation by the very forces of disorder they gradually understood they had to fight.God had a purpose beyond study for them.They had to find their own place, in the whole galaxy at least; perhaps even outside that, as well.The more mature species could look to their own salvation; they had to make their own rules and find their own peace with God (and it was a sign of his generosity that he was happy with their achievements even when they denied Him).But the others  the swarming, chaotic, struggling peoples  they needed guidance.The time had come to do away with the toys of self interested striving.That the Idirans had realised this was the sign of it.In them, and in the Word that was their inheritance from the divine, the Spell within their genetic inheritance, a new message was abroad: Grow up.Behave.Prepare.Horza didn't believe in the Idirans" religion any more than Balveda had, and indeed he could see in its over deliberate, too planned ideals exactly the sort of life constricting forces he so despised in the Culture's initially more benign ethos.But the Idirans relied on themselves, not on their machines, and so they were still part of life.To him, that made all the difference.Horza knew the Idirans would never subdue all the less developed civilisations in the galaxy; their dreamed of day of judgement would never come.But the very certainty of that ultimate defeat made the Idirans safe, made them normal, made them part of the general life of the galaxy; just one more species, which would grow and expand and then, finding the plateau phase all non suicidal species eventually arrived at, settle down.In ten thousand years the Idirans would be just another civilisation, getting on with their own lives.The current era of conquests might be fondly remembered, but it would be irrelevant by then, explained away by some creative theology.They had been quiet and introspective before; so they would be again.In the end, they were rational.They listened to common sense before their own emotions.The only thing they believed without proof was that there was a purpose to life, that there was something which was translated in most languages as "God', and that that God wanted a better existence for His creations.At the moment they pursued this goal themselves, believed themselves to be the arms and hands and fingers of God.But when the time came they would be able to assimilate the realisation that they'd got it wrong, that it was not up to them to bring about the final order.They would themselves become calm; they would find their own place.The galaxy and its many and varied civilisations would assimilate them.The Culture was different.Horza could see no end to its policy of continual and escalating interference.It could easily grow for ever, because it was not governed by natural limitations.Like a rogue cell, a cancer with no off switch in its genetic composition, the Culture would go on expanding for as long as it was allowed to.It would not stop of its own accord, so it had to be stopped.This was a cause he had long ago decided to devote himself to, Horza told himself, listening to Fwi Song droning on.Also, a cause he would serve no more, if he didn't get away from the Eaters.Fwi Song talked for a little longer, then  after a word from Mr First  had his litter turned round so that he could address his followers.Most of them were either being very ill or looking it.Fwi Song switched to the local language Horza didn't understand, and gave what was evidently a sermon.He ignored the occasional bout of vomiting from his flock.The sun dipped lower over the ocean, and the day cooled.The sermon over, Fwi Song sat silently on his litter as, one by one, the Eaters came up to him, bowed and spoke earnestly to him.The prophet's dome like head wore a large smile, and every now and again it would nod with what looked like agreement.Later, the Eaters sang and chanted while Fwi Song was washed and oiled by the two women who had helped officiate at Twenty seventh's death.Then, his vast body gleaming in the rays of the falling sun, Fwi Song was carried, waving cheerfully, off the beach and into the small forest beneath the island's single stunted mountain.Fires were stoked and wood was brought.The Eaters dispersed to their tents and camp fires, or set off in small groups with crudely made baskets, apparently to gather fresh debris they would later try to eat.At about sunset, Mr First joined the five quiet Eaters who sat around the fire Horza was by now tired of facing.The emaciated humans had taken little or no notice of the Changer, but Mr First came and sat near the man tied to the post.In one hand he held a small stone, in the other some of the artificial teeth Fwi Song had used on Twenty seventh earlier that day.Mr First sat grinding and polishing the teeth while he talked to the other Eaters.After a couple of them had gone to their tents, Mr First went behind Horza and undid the gag.Horza breathed through his mouth to get rid of the stale taste, and exercised his jaw.He shifted, trying to ease the accumulating aches in his arms and legs."Comfortable?"Mr First said, squatting down again.He continued to sharpen the metal fangs; they flickered in the firelight."I've felt better," Horza said."You'll feel worse, too friend. "Mr First made the last word sound like a curse."My name's Horza. ""I don't care what your name is. "Mr First shook his head."Your name doesn't matter.You don't matter. ""I had started to form that impression," Horza admitted."Oh, had you?"Mr First said.He got up and came closer to the Changer."Had you really?"He lashed out with the steel teeth he held in his hand, catching Horza across the left cheek."Think you're clever, eh?Think you're going to get out of this, do you?"He kicked Horza in the belly.Horza gasped and choked."See  you don't matter.You're just a hunk of meat.That's all anybody is.Just meat.And anyway," he kicked Horza again, "pain isn't real.Just chemicals and electrics and that sort of thing, right?""Oh," Horza croaked, his wounds aching briefly, "yes.Right. ""OK," Mr First grinned."You remember this tomorrow, OK.You're just a piece of meat, and the prophet's a bigger one. ""You ah, don't believe in souls, then?"Horza said diffidently, hoping this wouldn't lead to another kick."Fuck your soul, stranger," Mr First laughed."You'd better hope there's no such thing.There's people that are natural eaters and there's those that are always going to get eaten, and I can't see that their souls are going to be any different, so as you're obviously one of those that are always going to get eaten, you'd better hope there isn't any such thing.That's your best bet, believe me. "Mr First brought out the rag he had taken from Horza's mouth.He tied it back there, saying, "No  no soul at all would be the best thing for you, friend.But if it turns out you have got one, you come back and tell me, so I can have a good laugh, right?"Mr First pulled the knotted rag tight, hauling Horza's head against the wooden stake.Fwi Song's lieutenant finished sharpening the sets of gleaming metal teeth, then rose and spoke to the other Eaters sitting around the fire.After a while they went to some of the small tents, and soon they were all off the beach, leaving only Horza to watch the few dying fires.The waves crashed softly on the distant surf line, stars arced slowly above, and the dayside of the Orbital was a bright line of light overhead.Shining in the starlight and the O light, the silent, waiting bulk of the Culture shuttle sat, its rear doors open like a cave of safe darkness.Horza had already tested the knots restraining his hands and feet.Shrinking his wrists wouldn't work; the rope, twine or whatever they had used was tightening very slightly all the time; it would just take up the slack as quickly as he could produce it.Perhaps it shrank when drying and they had wet it before tying him.He couldn't tell.He could intensify the acid content in his sweat glands where the rope touched his skin, and that was always worth a try, but even the long night of Vavatch probably wouldn't give enough time for the process to work.Pain isn't real, he told himself.Crap.He awoke at dawn, along with several of the Eaters, who walked slowly down to the water to wash in the surf.Horza was cold.He started shivering as soon as he woke, and he could tell that his body temperature had dropped a long way during the night in the light trance required for altering the skin cells on his wrists.He strained at the ropes, testing for some give, the slightest tearing of fibres or strands.There was nothing, just more pain from the palms of his hands where some sweat had run down onto skin unchanged and therefore unprotected from the acid his sweat glands had been producing.He worried about that for about a second, recalling that if he was ever to impersonate Kraiklyn properly he would need to lift the man's finger and palm prints and so would need his skin in perfect Changing condition.Then he laughed at himself for worrying about that when he wasn't even likely to see the day out.He vaguely considered killing himself.It was possible; with only a little internal preparation, he could use one of his own teeth to poison himself.But, while there was still any chance, he could not bring himself to think of it seriously.He wondered how Culture people faced the war; they were supposed to be able to decide to die, too, though it was said to be more complicated than simple poison.But how did they resist it, those soft, peace pampered souls?He imagined them in combat, auto euthenising almost the instant the first shots landed, the first wounds started to appear.The thought made him smile.The Idirans had a death trance, but it was only for use in cases of extreme shame and disgrace, or when a life's work was completed, or a crippling disease threatened.And unlike the Culture  or the Changers  they felt their pain to the full, undampened by genofixed inhibitors.The Changers regarded pain as a semi redundant hangover from their animal evolution; the Culture was simply frightened of it: but the Idirans treated it with a sort of proud contempt.Horza looked across the beach, over the two big canoes towards the open rear doors of the shuttle.A pair of brightly coloured birds were strutting around on its top, making little ritualised movements.Horza watched them for a while, as the Eaters" camp gradually woke up and the morning sun brightened.Mist rose from the thin forest and there were a few clouds, high up in the sky.Mr First came yawning and stretching out of his tent, then took the heavy projectile pistol out from under his tunic and fired it in the air.This seemed to be a signal for all the Eaters to wake and set about their daily business if they hadn't already done so.The noise of the crude weapon frightened the two birds on the roof of the Culture shuttle; they took to the air and flew away over the trees and shrubs, around the island.Horza watched them go, then let his eyes drop, staring at the golden sand and breathing slow and deep."Your big day, stranger," Mr First said with a grin, coming up to the Changer.He put the pistol into the string holster under his tunic.Horza looked at the man, but said nothing.Another feast in my honour, he thought.Mr First walked around Horza, looking down at him.Horza followed him with his eyes where he could and waited for the man to spot whatever damage the acid sweat had succeeded in inflicting on the rope round his wrists, but Mr First didn't notice anything, and when he reappeared in Horza's view he was still smiling slightly, nodding his head a little, seemingly satisfied that the man tied to the stake was still well enough restrained.Horza did his best to stretch, straining at the bonds at his wrists.There was not even a hint of give.It hadn't worked.Mr First left, to supervise the launching of a fishing canoe.Fwi Song was brought out of the forest on his litter not long before noon, as the fishing canoe was returning."Gift of the seas and air!Tribute of the great Circlesea's vast wealth!See what a wondrous day awaits you now!"Fwi Song had himself brought up to Horza, and was put down to one side of the fire.He smiled at the Changer."All the night you have had time to think of what the day now holds; for all the darkness you have been able to look into the fruits of the Vacuum.You have seen the spaces between the stars, seen how much there is of nothing, how little there is of anything.Now you can appreciate what an honour lies in store for you; how lucky you are to be my sign, my offering!"Fwi Song clapped his hands with delight, and his enormous body shook up and down.The chubby hands went to his mouth as he spoke, and the folds of flesh over his eyes lifted momentarily to reveal the whites within."Ho hoo!What fun we all shall have!"The prophet made a sign, and his litter carriers took him down to the sea to be washed and anointed.Horza watched the Eaters prepare their food; they gutted the fish, throwing away the meat and keeping the offal and skins, heads and spikes.They removed the shells from the animals inside and threw the animals away.They ground up the shells with the weeds and some brightly coloured sea slugs.Horza watched all this happen in front of him, and saw just how run down the Eaters really were; the scabs and sores, the deficiency diseases and general weakness.The colds and coughs, peeling skin and partly deformed limbs all spoke of a very gradually fatal diet.The dead meat and animals from the sea were returned to the waves via great blood soaked baskets.Horza watched as closely as his gag and the distance would allow, but none of the Eaters seemed to take a surreptitious bite of the raw meat as they threw it from the baskets into the waves.Fwi Song, being dried on the sand just up the beach from the line of breakers, watched the food being thrown into the sea and nodded with approval, speaking quiet words of encouragement to his flock.Then he clapped his hands, and the litter was slowly carried along the beach to the fire and the Changer."Offertory thing!Benefaction!Prepare yourself!"Fwi Song warbled, settling down in his litter with little movements which sent ripples all over the great folds and sweeps of his massive body.Horza started to breathe harder, felt his heart pound.He swallowed, and strained again at the rope holding his hands.Mr First and the two women were digging at the sand for the thin robes in their buried sacks.All the Eaters gathered round the fire, facing Horza.Their eyes looked black or vaguely interested, nothing more.There was a listlessness about their actions and expressions which Horza found even more depressing than outright hatred or sadistic glee would have been.The Eaters began to chant and sing.Mr First and the two women were twisting the dull lengths of cloth around their bodies.Mr First looked at Horza and grinned."Oh happy moment in the ending days!"Fwi Song said, raising his voice and hands, his choked tones ringing out towards the centre of the island.The smells of the Eaters" foul cooking drifted past the Changer again."Let this one's unmaking and making be a symbol for us!"Fwi Song continued, letting his arms drop back in enormous rolls of white flesh.The golden brown surfaces gleamed in the sunlight as the prophet clasped his fat fingers together."Let his pain be our delight, as our unmaking shall be our joining; let his flaying and consummation be our satisfaction and delectation!"Fwi Song raised his head and spoke loudly in the language the others understood.Their chanting altered and grew louder.Mr First and the two women approached Horza.Horza felt Mr First take the gag from his mouth.The pale skinned man spoke to the two women, who went to the bubbling vats of stinking liquid.Horza's head was feeling very light; there was a taste he knew too well at the back of his throat, as though some of the acid from his wrists had somehow found its way to his tongue.He strained again at his bonds behind him, feeling the muscles shake.The chanting went on; the women were ladling the foul broth into bowls.His empty stomach was churning already.There are two main ways to escape bonds apart from those open to non Changers [the Academy's lecture notes said]: by acid sweat pulse on a sustained level where the binding material is susceptible to such an attack, and by malleable preferential tapering of the limb point involved.Horza tried to coax a little more strength from his tired muscles.Excessive acid sweating can damage not only the adjacent skin surfaces, but also the body as a whole through dangerously altered chemical imbalances.Over much tapering poses the risk of the muscles being so wasted and the bone so weakened that their subsequent use may be severely restricted in the short  and long term escape attempt.Mr First was approaching with the wooden blocks he would fit into Horza's mouth.A couple of the larger Eaters had stood up near the front of the crowd and advanced slightly, ready to assist Mr First.Fwi Song was reaching behind his back.The women started forward from the bubbling vats."Open wide, stranger," Mr First said, holding out the two wooden blocks."Or do we use a crowbar?"Mr First smiled.Horza's arms strained.His upper arm moved.Mr First saw the movement and halted momentarily.One of Horza's hands jerked free.It shot round in an instant, nails ready to rake Mr First's face.The pale skinned man drew back, not quickly enough.Horza's nails caught Mr First's robe and tunic as they flapped out from his dodging body.Already straining as far out from the stake as he could, Horza felt his clawed hand rip through the two layers of material without connecting with the flesh underneath.Mr First staggered back, bumping into one of the women carrying the bowls of stinking gruel, knocking it from her hands.One of the wooden wedges sailed from Mr First's hand and landed in the fire.Horza's arm completed its swing just as the two Eaters in the front of the crowd came forward quickly and caught the Changer by the head and arm."Sacrilege!"Fwi Song screamed.Mr First looked at the woman he had bumped into, at the fire, at the prophet, then back with a furious look at the Changer.He lifted one arm to look at the tears in his robe and tunic."The gift filth desecrates our vestments!"Fwi Song shouted.The two Eaters held Horza, pinning his arm back where it had been and his head to the stake.Mr First started towards Horza, taking the gun out from under his tunic and holding it by the barrel, like a club."Mr First!"Fwi Song snapped, stopping the pale skinned man in his tracks."Shtand gack!Hold gat am out; ee'll show gish naught goy how we geel wish hish short!"Horza's free arm was straightened out in front of him.One of the Eaters holding him put his leg round the back of the post, bracing himself there and trapping Horza's other hand where it was.Fwi Song had a set of gleaming steel teeth in his mouth, the holed ones.He glared at the Changer while Mr First stepped back, still holding the projectile pistol.The prophet nodded to another two Eaters in the crowd; they took Horza's hand and prised the fingers apart, tying that wrist to a pole.Horza felt his whole body shake.He cut off all feeling in that hand."Naughty, naughty gisht "rom the shee!"Fwi Song said.He leant forward, buried Horza's index finger in his mouth, closed the stripper teeth over them, cutting into the flesh, and then pulled quickly back.The prophet chewed and swallowed, watching the Changer's face as he did so, and frowning."Not gery tashty, genegiction "rom the oceansh currentsh!"The prophet licked his lips.An not shore enush "or you, eisher, sho it wood sheen?Letch shee "ot elsh nee can" Fwi Song was frowning again.Horza looked past the Eaters holding him to the hand stretched out over the pole, one finger stripped bare, the bones limp, blood dripping from the thin tip.Beyond that, Fwi Song sat frowning on his litter on the sand, Mr First near his side, still glaring at Horza and holding the gun barrel.As Fwi Song's silence continued, Mr First looked at the prophet.Fwi Song said, " not elsh nee can nee can" Fwi Song reached up and took the stripper teeth with some difficulty from his mouth.He laid them in front of him with the rest on their rag, and put one pudgy hand to his throat, the other onto the vast hemisphere of his belly.Mr First looked on, then back at Horza, who did his best to smile.The Changer opened his teeth glands and sucked poison."Mr First" Fwi Song began, then put out the hand on his belly towards the other man.Mr First seemed uncertain what to do.He transferred the gun from one hand to the other, and took the prophet's offered hand with his free one."I think I I" Fwi Song said, as his eyes started to open from slits to small ovals.Horza could see his face changing colour already.Soon the voice, as the vocal cords react."Help me, Mr First!"Fwi Song took hold of a lump of fat round his throat as though trying to undo a scarf tied too tightly; he stuck his fingers into his mouth, down his throat, but Horza knew that wouldn't work; the prophet's stomach muscles were already paralysed  he couldn't vomit the poison up.Fwi Song's eyes were wide now, glaring white; his face was going grey blue.Mr First was goggling at the prophet and still holding his huge hand; his own was buried somewhere inside the great golden fist of Fwi Song's."He ll p!"squeaked the prophet.Then nothing but choking noises.The white eyes bulged, the vast frame shook, the dome head went blue.Somebody in the crowd started screaming.Mr First looked at Horza, and brought up the big pistol.Horza tensed, then spat with all his might.The spittle splashed across Mr First's face, from mouth to one ear in a sickle shape which just took in one eye.Mr First staggered back.Horza breathed in, sucked more poison, then spat and blew at the same time, landing a second burst of spittle right across Mr First's eyes.Mr First clutched at his face, dropping the gun.His other hand was still caught in Fwi Song's grip as the obese prophet shook and quivered, his eyes wide but seeing nothing.The people holding Horza wavered; he could feel it in them.More people in the crowd were crying out.Horza jerked his body and snarled, spitting again, at one of the men holding the pole his hand was tied to.The man screamed shrilly and fell back; the others let go of him or the pole and ran.Fwi Song was going blue from the neck down, still quivering and clutching his throat with one hand and Mr First with the other.Mr First was on his knees, his face lowered, moaning as he tried to wipe the spittle from his face and remove the unbearable burning from his eyes.Horza looked round quickly; the Eaters were watching either their prophet and his chief disciple, or him, but they weren't doing anything either to aid them or to stop him.Not all of them were crying or screaming; some were still chanting, quickly and fearfully as though something they could say would stop whatever terrible things were happening.Gradually, though, they were backing off, away both from the prophet and Mr First, and from the Changer.Horza pulled and jerked his hand tied to the pole; it started to come free."Aah!"Mr First suddenly raised his head, hand clutching at one eye, and screamed for all his worth; his hand, still caught in that of the prophet, jerked out straight as he tried to pull free.Fwi Song still held him in his grip, though, even as he quaked and stared and turned blue.Horza's hand came free; he tugged at the bonds behind him and did his best with the crippled free hand to untie the knots.The Eaters were moaning now, some still chanting, but they were moving away.Horza roared  partly at them, partly at the stubborn knots behind him.Several in the crowd ran.One of the women dressed in the ragged vestment clothes screamed, threw her bowl of gruel at him, missing him, then fell sobbing to the sand.Horza felt the ropes behind him give.He got the other arm free, then one foot.He stood shakily, watching Fwi Song gargle and choke, while Mr First howled, shaking his head this way and that and pulling and swinging his gripped hand as though in some monstrous travesty of a handshake.Eaters were running for the canoes or the shuttle, or throwing themselves onto the sand.Horza struggled free at last, and staggered towards the grossly imbalanced duo of men linked by the hand.He plunged forward and grabbed the fallen pistol from the sands.As he knelt and then stood, Fwi Song, as though suddenly seeing Horza again, gave one last gurgling, gagging splutter of noise, and tipped slowly towards the side Mr First was pulling and tugging from.Mr First fell to his knees again, still screaming as the venom seared the membranes of his eyes and attacked the nerves beyond.As Fwi Song toppled and his arm and hand went slack, Mr First looked up and round, in time to see through his pain the vast bulk of the prophet falling towards him.He howled once, on an indrawn breath as he pulled his hand free at last from the now blue clump of chubby fingers; he started to rise to his feet, but Fwi Song rolled over and crashed into him, knocking him to the sand.Before Mr First could utter another sound, the immense prophet had fallen over his disciple, flattening him into the sand from head to buttocks.Fwi Song's eyes closed slowly.The hand at his throat flopped across the sand and into the outer edge of the fire, where it started to sizzle.Mr First's legs beat a tattoo on the sand just as the last of the Eaters ran away, jumping tents and fires and racing for the canoes or shuttle or forest.Then the two skinny legs sticking out from under the prophet's body were reduced to spasms, and after a while they stopped moving altogether.None of their movements had succeeded in shifting Fwi Song's huge body a centimetre.Horza blew some sand off the clumsy feeling pistol and moved upwind from the smell of the prophet's hand burning in the fire.He checked the gun, looking round the deserted stretch of beach around the fires and tents.The canoes were being launched.Eaters were crowding into the Culture shuttle.Horza stretched his aching limbs, looked at his bare boned finger, then shrugged, put the gun under one armpit, put his good hand round the set of bones, pulled and twisted.His useless bones snapped from their sockets and he threw them onto the fire.Pain isn't real anyway, he told himself shakily, and started for the Culture shuttle at a slow run.The Eaters in the shuttle saw him coming straight towards them, and started screaming again.They piled out.Some of them ran down the beach to wade out after the escaping canoes; others scattered into the forest.Horza slowed down to let them go, then looked warily at the open doors of the Culture craft.He could see seats inside, up the short ramp, and lights and a far bulkhead.He took a deep breath and walked up the gentle slope of ramp, into the shuttle."Hello," said a crudely synthesised voice.Horza looked around.The shuttle looked pretty well used and old.It was Culture, he was fairly certain of that, but it wasn't as neat and spanking new as the Culture liked its products to look."Why were those people so frightened of you?"Horza was still looking round, wondering where and what to address."I'm not sure," he said shrugging.He was naked and still holding the gun, with only a couple of strips of flesh on one finger, though the bleeding had quickly stopped.He thought he must look a threatening figure anyway, but maybe the shuttle couldn't tell that."Where are you?What are you?"he said, deciding to feign ignorance.He looked around in a very obvious manner, hamming up a display of looking forward, through a door in the bulkhead, to a control area forward."I'm the shuttle.Its brain.How do you do?""Fine," Horza said, "just fine.How are you?""Very well, considering, thank you.I haven't been bored at all, but it is nice to have somebody to talk to at last.You speak very good Marain; where did you learn?""Ah I did a course in it," Horza said.He did some more looking around."Look, I don't know where to look when I talk to you.Where should I look, huh?""Ha ha," the shuttle laughed."I suppose you'd best look up here; forward towards the bulkhead. "Horza did so."See that little round thing right in the middle, near the ceiling?That's one of my eyes. ""Oh," Horza said.He waved and smiled."Hi.My name's Orab. ""Hello, Orab.I'm called Tsealsir.Actually that's only part of my name designation, but you can call me that.What was happening out there?I haven't been watching the people I'm here to rescue; I was told not to, in case I got upset, but I did hear people screaming when they came near and they seemed frightened when they came inside me.Then they saw you and ran away.What is that you're holding?Is it a gun?I'll have to ask you to put that away for safe keeping.I'm here to rescue people who want to be rescued when the Orbital is destructed, and we can't have dangerous weapons on board, in case somebody gets hurt, can we?Is that finger hurt?I have a very good medkit on board.Would you like to use it, Orab?""Yes, that might be an idea. ""Good.It's on the inward side of the doorway through to my front compartment on the left. "Horza started walking past the rows of seats towards the front of the shuttle.For all its age, the shuttle smelled of he wasn't quite sure.All the synthetic materials it was made from, he supposed.After the natural but god awful odours of the last day, Horza found the shuttle much more pleasant, even if it was Culture and therefore belonged to the enemy.Horza touched the gun he was carrying as though doing something to it."Just putting the safety catch on," he told the eye in the ceiling."Don't want it to go off, but those people out there were trying to kill me earlier, and I feel safer with it in my hand, know what I mean?""Well, not exactly, Orab," the shuttle said, "but I think I can understand.But you'll have to give the gun to me before we take off. ""Oh sure.As soon as you close those rear doors. "Horza was in the doorway between the main compartment and the smaller control area now.It was in fact a very short corridor, less than two metres long, with opened doors to each compartment.Horza looked round quickly, but he couldn't see another eye.He watched a large flap open at about hip level to reveal a comprehensive medical kit."Well, Orab, I'd close those doors to make you feel a bit safer if I could, but you see I'm here to rescue people who want to be rescued when the time comes to destruct the Orbital, and I can't close those doors until just before I leave, so that everybody who wants to can get on board.Actually I can't really understand why anybody wouldn't want to escape, but they told me not to get worried if some people stayed behind.But I must say I think that would be kind of silly, don't you, Orab?"Horza was rummaging through the medkit but looking above it at other outlines of doors set in the wall of the short corridor.He said, "Hmm?Oh, yeah, that would be.When is the place due to blow, anyway?"He poked his head round the corner, into the control compartment or flight deck, looking up at another eye set in the corresponding position to the one in the main compartment, but looking forward from the other side of the thick wall between the two.Horza grinned and gave a little wave, then ducked back."Hi," the shuttle laughed."Well, Orab, I'm afraid that we're going to be forced to destruct the Orbital in forty three standard hours.Unless, of course, the Idirans see sense and are reasonable and withdraw their threat to use Vavatch as a war base. ""Oh," Horza said.He was looking at one of the door outlines above the opened one the medkit was protruding from.As far as he could guess, those two eyes were back to back, separated by the thickness of the wall between the two compartments.Unless there was a mirror he couldn't see, he was invisible to the shuttle while he remained in the short corridor.He looked back, out through the open rear doors; the only movement came from the tops of some distant trees and the smoke from the fires.He checked the gun.The projectiles seemed to be hidden in some sort of magazine, but a little circular indicator with a sweep hand indicated either one bullet left or one expended out of twelve."Yes," the shuttle said."It's very sad, of course, but these things are necessary in wartime I suppose.Not that I pretend to understand it all.I'm just a humble shuttle, after all.I'd actually been given away as a present to one of the Megaships because I was too old fashioned and crude for the Culture, you know.I thought they could have upgraded me but they didn't; they just gave me away.Anyway, they need me now, I'm happy to say.We have quite a job on our hands, you know, getting everybody who wants to get off away from Vavatch.I'll be sorry to see it go; I've had some happy times here, believe me But that's just the way things go, I suppose.How's that finger going, by the way?Want me to have a look at it?Bring the medkit stuff round into one of the two compartments so I can take a look.I might be able to help, you know?Oh!Are you touching one of the other lockers in that corridor?"Horza was trying to lever open the door nearest the roof by using the barrel of the gun."No," he said, heaving away at it."I'm nowhere near it. ""That's odd.I'm sure I can feel something.Are you sure?""Of course I'm sure," Horza said, putting all his weight behind the gun.The door gave way, revealing tubes, fibre runs, metal bottles and various other unrecognisable bits of machinery, electrics, optics and field units."Ouch!"said the shuttle."Hey!"Horza shouted."It just blew open!There's something on fire in there!"He raised the gun, holding it in both hands.He sighted carefully; about there."Fire!"yelped the shuttle."But that's not possible!""You think I can't tell smoke when I see it, you crazy goddamned machine?"Horza yelled.He pulled the trigger.The gun exploded, throwing his hands up and him back.The noise of the shuttle's exclamation was covered by the crack and bang of the bullet hitting inside and exploding.Horza covered his face with his arm."I'm blind!"wailed the shuttle.Now smoke really was pouring from the compartment Horza had opened.He staggered into the control compartment."You're on fire in here, too!"he yelled."There's smoke coming out everywhere!""What?But that can't be "  "You're on fire!I don't know how you can't feel it or smell it!You're burning!""I don't trust you!"the machine yelled."Put that gun away or "  "You've got to trust me!"Horza yelled, looking all over the control area for where the shuttle's brain might be located.He could see screens and seats, readout screens and even the place where manual controls might be hidden; but no indication of where the brain was."Smoke's pouring out everywhere!"he repeated, trying to sound hysterical."Here!Here's an extinguisher!I'm turning mine on!"the machine shouted.A wall unit spun round, and Horza grabbed the bulky cylinder attached to the inside of the flap.He wrapped his four good fingers on his injured hand round the pistol grip.A hissing noise and a light vapour like steam was appearing from various places in the compartment."Nothing's happening!"Horza screamed."There's loads of black smoke and its  arrch!"He pretended to cough. "Aargh!It's getting thicker!""Where is it coming from?Quickly!""Everywhere!"Horza yelled, glancing all round the control area."From near your eye under the seats, over the screens, under the screens I can't see!""Go on!I can smell smoke, too, now!"Horza looked at the slight smudge of grey filtering into the control area from the spluttering fire in the short corridor where he had shot the craft."It's coming from those places, and those info screens on either side of the end seats, and just above the seats, on the side walls where that bit juts out "  "What?"screamed the shuttle brain."On the left facing forward?""Yes!""Put that one out first!"the shuttle screeched.Horza dropped the extinguisher and gripped the gun in both hands again, aiming it at the bulge in the wall over the left hand seat.He pulled the trigger: once, twice, three times.The gun blasted, shaking his whole body; sparks and bits of flying debris flew from the holes the bullets were smashing in the casing of the machine."EEEeee" said the shuttle, then there was silence.Some smoke rose from the bulge and it joined with that coming from the corridor to form a thin layer under the ceiling.Horza let the gun down slowly, looking around and listening."Mug," he said.He used the hand held extinguisher to put out the small fires in the wall of the corridor and where the shuttle's brain had been, then he went out into the passenger area to sit near the open doors while the smoke and the fumes cleared.He couldn't see any Eaters on the sand or in the forest, and the canoes were out of sight, too.He looked for some door controls and found them; the doors closed with a hiss, and Horza grinned.He went back to the control area and started punching buttons and opening sections of panelling until he got some life from the screens.They all suddenly blinked on while he was fiddling with some buttons on the arm of one of the couch like seats.The noise of surf in the flight deck made him think the doors had opened again, but it was only some external microphones relaying the noise from outside.Screens flickered and lit up with figures and lines, and flaps opened in front of the seats; control wheels and levers sighed out smoothly and clicked into place, just ready to be held and used.Feeling happier than he had been in many days, Horza started an eventually successful but longer and more frustrating search for some food; he was very hungry.Some small insects were running in orderly lines over the huge body collapsed on the sands, one hand of which was sticking, charred and blackened, into the dying flames of a fire.The little insects started by eating the deep set eyes, which were open.They hardly noticed as the shuttle rose, wobbling, into the air, picked up speed and turned inelegantly above the mountain, then roared off, through the early evening air, away from the island.Interlude in darkness  The Mind had an image to illustrate its information capacity.It liked to imagine the contents of its memory store written out on cards; little slips of paper with tiny writing on them, big enough for a human to read.If the characters were a couple of millimetres tall and the paper about ten centimetres square and written on both sides, then ten thousand characters could be squeezed onto each card.In a metre long drawer of such cards maybe one thousand of them  ten million pieces of information  could be stored.In a small room a few metres square, with a corridor in the middle just wide enough to pull a tray out into, you could keep perhaps a thousand trays arranged in close packed cabinets: ten billion characters in all.A square kilometre of these cramped cells might contain as many as one hundred thousand rooms; a thousand such floors would produce a building two thousand metres tall with a hundred million rooms.If you kept building those squat towers, squeezed hard up against each other until they entirely covered the surface of a largish standard G world  maybe a billion square kilometres  you would have a planet with one trillion square kilometres of floor space, one hundred quadrillion paper stuffed rooms, thirty light years of corridors and a number of potential stored characters sufficiently large to boggle just about anybody's mind.In base 10 that number would be a 1 followed by twenty seven zeros, and even that vast figure was only a fraction of the capacity of the Mind.To match it you would need a thousand such worlds; systems of them, a clusterful of information packed globes and that vast capacity was physically contained within a space smaller than a single one of those tiny rooms, inside the Mind   In darkness the Mind waited.It had counted how long it had waited so far; it had tried to estimate how long it would have to wait in the future.It knew to the smallest imaginable fraction of a second how long it had been in the tunnels of the Command System, and more often than it needed to it thought about that number, watched it grow inside itself.It was a form of security, it supposed; a small fetish; something to cling to.It had explored the Command System tunnels, scanning and surveying.It was weak, damaged, almost totally helpless, but it had been worthwhile taking a look around the maze like complex of tunnels and caverns just to take its attention off the fact that it was there as a refugee.The places it could not get to itself it sent its one remaining remote drone into, so that it could have a look, and see what there was to be seen.And all of it was at once boring and frighteningly depressing.The level of technology possessed by the builders of the Command System was very limited indeed; everything in the tunnels worked either mechanically or electronically.Gears and wheels, electric wires, superconductors and light fibres; very crude indeed, the Mind thought, and nothing it could possibly interest itself in.A glance through any of the machines and devices in the tunnel was sufficient to know them exactly  what they were made of, how they had been made, even what they were made for.No mystery, nothing to employ the mind.There was something too about the inexactitude of it all that the Mind found almost frightening.It could look at some carefully machined piece of metal or some delicately moulded bit of plastic, and know that to the people who had built the Command System  to their eyes  these things were exact and precise, constructed to fine tolerances with dead straight lines, perfect edges, smooth surfaces, immaculate right angles and so on.But the Mind, even with its damaged sensors, could see the rough edges, the crudity of the parts and the components involved.They had been good enough for the people at the time, and no doubt they had fulfilled the most important criterion of all; they worked  But they were crude, clumsy, imperfectly designed and manufactured.For some reason the Mind found this worrying.And it would have to use this ancient, crude, shop soiled technology.It would have to connect with it.It had thought it through as best it could, and decided to formulate plans for what to do if the Idirans did get somebody through the Quiet Barrier and threatened it with discovery.It would arm, and it would make a place to hide in.Both actions implied damage to the Command System, so it would not act until it knew it was definitely threatened.Once it knew it was, it would be forced to risk the Dra'Azon's displeasure.But it might not come to that.It hoped it wouldn't; planning was one thing, execution was another.It was unlikely to have very much time either to hide or to arm.Both plans might perforce be rather crudely implemented, especially as it had only one remote drone and its own badly crippled fields with which to manipulate the engineering facilities of the System.Better than nothing, though.Better still to have problems than to let death eradicate them all  There was, however, another less immediately relevant, but more intrinsically worrying, problem it had discovered, and it was implied in the question: who was it?Its higher functions had had to close down when it had transferred from four  to three dimensional space.The Mind's information was held in binary form, in spirals composed of protons and neutrons; and neutrons  outside a nucleus, and also outside hyperspace  decayed (into protons, ha ha; not too long after entering the Command System, the vast majority of its memory would have consisted of the stunningly illuminating message: "0000000 ").So it had effectively frozen its primary memory and cognitive functions, wrapping them in fields which prevented both decay and use.It was working instead on back up picocircuitry, in real space, and using real space light to think with (how humiliating).In fact, it could still access all that stored memory (though the process was complicated, and so slow), so all was not lost there But as for thinking, as for being itself  another matter entirely.It wasn't its real self.It was a crude, abstracted copy of itself, the mere ground plan for the full labyrinthine complexity of its true personality.It was the truest possible copy its limited scale was theoretically capable of providing, and it was still sentient; conscious by even the most rigorous of standards.Yet an index was not the text, a street plan was not the city, a map not the land.So who was it?Not the entity it thought it was, that was the answer, and it was a disconcerting one.Because it knew that the self it was now could never think of all the things its old self would have thought of.It felt unworthy.It felt fallible and limited and dull.But think positively.Patterns, images, the telling analogy  make the ill work to good.Just think  If it was not itself, then it would be not itself.As it was now to what it had been before, so the remote drone was to it now (nice connection).The remote drone would be more than just its eyes and ears on the surface, in or near the Changers" base, keeping look out; more than just its assistant in the doubtless frantic preparations to equip and secrete which would ensue if the drone did raise the alarm; more.And less.Look on the happy side, think of the good things.Hadn't it been clever?Yes, it had.Its escape from the spare parts warship had been, though it thought it itself, quite breathtakingly masterful and brilliant.Its courageous use of warp so deep into a gravity well would have been foolhardy in the extreme in anything else but the dire circumstances it had found itself in, but was anyway superbly skilled And its stunning cross realm transfer, from hyper  to real space, was not simply even more brilliant and even braver than anything else it had done, it was almost certainly a first; there was nothing anywhere in its vast store of information to indicate that anybody had ever done that before.It was proud.But after all that, here it was, trapped; an intellectual cripple, a philosophical shadow of its former self.Now all it could do was wait, hoping that whoever came to find it would be friendly.The Culture must know; the Mind was certain its signal had worked and that it would be picked up somewhere.But the Idirans knew as well.It didn't think they would just try to storm in, because they knew as well as it did that antagonising the Dra'Azon was a bad idea.But what if the Idirans found a way in and the Culture couldn't?What if the whole region of space around the Sullen Gulf was now Idiran held?The Mind knew there was only one thing it could do if it fell into Idiran hands, but not only did it not want to destruct for purely personal reasons, it didn't want to destruct anywhere near Schar's World anyway, for the same reason that the Idirans wouldn't come charging in.But if it was captured in the planet, that might be the last time it would have a chance to destroy itself.By the time it was taken off the planet the Idirans might have found a way of stopping it from destructing.Perhaps it had made a mistake in escaping at all.Perhaps it should have just destructed along with the rest of the ship and saved all this complication and worry.But it had seemed like an almost heaven sent opportunity to escape  finding itself so close to a Planet of the Dead when it had been attacked.It wanted to live anyway, but it would have been wasteful to throwaway such a great chance even if it had been perfectly sanguine about its own survival or destruction.Well, there was nothing to be done about it now.It was here and it just had to wait.Wait and think.Consider all the options (few) and possibilities (many).Rack those memories as best it could for anything that might be relevant, that might help.For example (and the one really interesting bit would be a bad one), it had discovered that the Idirans had probably employed one of the Changers who had actually served with the caretaker staff on Schar's World.Of course perhaps the man was dead, or busy on something else, or too far away, or the information had been incorrect in the first place and the intelligence gathering section of the Culture had got it wrong But if not, then that man would be the one obvious person to send after something hiding in the Command System tunnels.It was part of the Mind's very construction  at every level  to believe that there was no such thing as bad knowledge except in very relative terms, but it really did wish that it hadn't had that bit of information in its memory banks; it would just as soon not have known anything about this man, this Changer who knew Schar's World and probably worked for the Idirans.(Perversely, it found itself wishing it knew this man's name. )But with any luck he would be irrelevant, or the Culture would get here first.Or the Dra'Azon being would recognise a fellow Mind in trouble and help, or anything.In darkness the Mind waited.Hundreds of those planets were empty; the hundred million room towers were there; the little rooms, the cabinets and the trays and the cards and the spaces for the numbers and letters were there; but nothing was written, nothing held, on any of the cards (Sometimes the Mind liked to imagine travelling down the narrow spaces between the cabinets, one of its remote drones floating between the banked files of memory in the thin corridors, from room to room, for floor after floor, kilometre after kilometre, over buried continents of rooms, filled in oceans of rooms, levelled ranges, felled forests, covered deserts of rooms. )These whole systems of dark planets, those trillions of square kilometres of blank paper, represented the Mind's future; the spaces it would fill in its life to come.If it had one.7.A Game of Damage  "Damage  the game banned everywhere.Tonight, in that unprepossessing building across the square under the dome, they'll gather: the Players of the Eve of Destruction the most select group of rich psychotics in the human galaxy, here to play the game that is to real life what soap opera is to high tragedy."This is the bi port city of Evanauth, Vavatch Orbital, the very same Vavatch Orbital that in about eleven standard hours from now is due to be blasted into its component atoms as the Idiran Culture war in this part of the galaxy, near the Glittercliff and Sullen Gulf, reaches a new high in standing by your principles regardless and a new low in common sense.It's that imminent destruction that's attracted these scatological vultures here, not the famous Megaships or the azure blue technological miracles of the Circlesea.No, these people are here because the whole Orbital is doomed to be blown away shortly, and they think it's kind of amusing to play Damage  an ordinary card game with a few embellishments to make it attractive to the mentally disturbed  in places on the verge of annihilation."They've played on worlds about to suffer massive comet or meteorite strikes, in volcanic calderas about to blow, in cities due for nuclear bombardment in ritualistic wars, in asteroids heading for the centre of stars, in front of moving cliffs of ice or lava, inside mysterious alien spacecraft discovered empty and deserted and set on courses aiming them into black holes, in vast palaces about to be sacked by android mobs, and just about everywhere you can think of you'd rather not want to be immediately after the Players leave.It might seem like a strange sort of way to get your kicks, but it takes all sorts to make a galaxy, I guess."So here they've come, these hyper rich dead beats, in their rented ships or their own cruisers.Right now they're sobering up and coming down, going through plastic surgery or behaviour therapy  or both to make them acceptable in what passes for normal society, even in these rarefied circles, after months spent in whatever expensive and unlikely debauchery or perversion particularly appeals to them or happens to be in fashion at the moment.At the same time, they or their minions are scraping together their Aoish credits  all actual; no notes  and scouting hospitals, asylums and freeze stores for new Lives."Here, too, have come the hangers on  the Damage groupies, the fortune seekers, the past failures at the game desperate for another try if they can only raise the money and the Lives and Damage's very own special sort of human debris: the moties, victims of the game's emotional fall out; mind junkies who only exist to lap at the crumbs of ecstasy and anguish falling from the lips of their heroes, the Players of the Game."Nobody knows exactly how all these different groups hear about the game or even how they all get here in time, but the word goes out to those who really need to or want to hear about it, and like ghouls they come, ready for the game and the destruction."Originally Damage was played on such occasions because only during the breakdown of law and morality, and the confusion and chaos normally surrounding Final Events, could the game be carried out in anything remotely resembling part of the civilised galaxy; which, believe it or not, the Players like to think they're part of.Now the subsequent nova, world busting or other cataclysm is seen as some sort of metaphysical symbol for the mortality of all things, and as the Lives involved in a Full Game are all volunteers, a lot of places  like good old pleasure oriented, permissive Vavatch  let the game take place with official blessing from the authorities.Some people say it's not the game it used to be, even that it's become something of a media event, but I say it's still a game for the mad and the bad; the rich and the uncaring, but not the careless; the unhinged but well connected.People still die in Damage, and not just the Lives, either, or the Players."It's been called the most decadent game in history.About all you can say in the game's defence is that it, rather than reality, occupies the warped minds of some of the galaxy's more twisted people; gods know what they would get up to if it wasn't there.And if the game does any good apart from reminding us  as if we needed reminding  how crazy the bipedal, oxygen breathing carboniform can become, it does occasionally remove one of the Players and frighten the rest for a while.In these arguably insane times, any lessening or attenuation of madness is maybe something to be grateful for."I'll be filing another report again some time during the course of the game, from within the auditorium if I can get in there.But in the meantime, goodbye and take care.This is Sarble the Eye, Evanauth City, Vavatch. "The image on the wrist screen of a man standing in sunlight on a plaza faded; the half masked, youngish face disappearing.Horza put his terminal screen back onto his cuff.The time display winked slowly with the countdown to Vavatch's destruction.Sarble the Eye, one of the most famous of the humanoid galaxy's freelance reporters, and also one of the most successful at getting into places he wasn't supposed to, would now probably be trying to enter the games hall  if he hadn't got in already; the broadcast Horza had just watched had been recorded that afternoon.Doubtless Sarble would be in disguise, so Horza was glad he'd bribed his way in before the reporter's broadcast went out and the security guards round the hall got even more wary; it had been hard enough as it was.Horza, in his new guise as Kraiklyn, had posed as a motie  one of the emotional junkies who followed the erratic, secretive progress of the major game series round the more tawdry fringes of civilisation, having discovered that all but the most expensive reserved places had been sold out the day before.The five Aoish credit Tenths he had started out with that morning were now reduced to three; though he also had some money keyed into a couple of credit cards he'd bought.That currency would shrink in real value, though, as the destruction time drew nearer.Horza took a deep, satisfying breath and looked around the big arena.He had climbed as high as he could up the banked steps, slopes and platforms, using the interval before the game began to get an overview of the whole thing.The dome of the arena was transparent, showing stars and the bright shining line that was the Orbital's far side, now in daylight.The lights of shuttles coming and going  mostly going  traced lines across the still points.Beneath the dome cover hung a smoky haze, lit with the popping lights of a small firework display.The air was filled, too, with the chanting of massed voices; a choir of scalecones stood banked on the far side of the auditorium.The humanoids forming the choir appeared identical in all but stature and in the tones they produced from their puffed out chests and long necks.They seemed to be making the ambient racket, but as he looked around the arena Horza could make out the faint purple edges in the air where other, more localised sound fields held command, over smaller stages where dancers danced, singers sang, strippers stripped, boxers boxed, or people just stood around talking.Banked all around, the paraphernalia of the game seethed like a vast storm.Maybe ten or even twenty thousand people, mostly humanoid but some utterly different, including not a few machines and drones, they sat or lay or walked or stood, watching magicians, jugglers, fighters, immolators, hypnotics, couplers, actors, orators and a hundred other types of entertainers all doing their turns.Tents had been pitched on some of the larger terraces; rows of seats and couches remained on others.Many small stages frazzled with lights, smoke and glittering holograms and soligrams.Horza saw a 3 D maze spread out over several terraces, full of tubes and angles, some clear, some opaque, some moving, some staying still.Shadows and forms moved inside.A slow motion animal trapeze act arced gradually overhead.Horza recognised the beasts performing it; it would become a combat act later on.Some people walked by Horza: tall humanoids in fabulous clothes, glittering like a gaudy night city seen from the air.They chattered in almost inaudibly high voices, and from a network of fine, golden coloured tubes branching all around their bright red and dark purple faces, tiny puffs of incandescent gas pulsed out, wreathing their semi scaled necks and naked shoulders, and trailing and dimming behind them in a fiery orange glow.Horza watched them pass.Their cloaks, flowing out behind as though hardly heavier than the air through which they moved, flickered with the image of an alien face, each cloak showing part of one huge moving image, as though a projector overhead was focused on the capes of the moving group.The orange gas touched Horza's nostrils and his head swam for a second.He let his immune glands deal with the narcotic, and continued to look around the arena.The eye of the storm, the still, quiet spot, was so small it could easily have been missed in even a slow and attentive scan of the auditorium.It was not in the centre, but set at one end of the ellipsoid of level ground forming the lowest visible level of the arena.There, under a canopy of still dark lighting units, a round table stood, just about large enough to accommodate at its rim the sixteen large, differently styled chairs which each faced a wedge of colour fixed to the top of the table.A console set into the table itself faced each chair, on which straps and other restraining devices lay opened.Behind each of the seats lay an area of clear space on which small seats, twelve in all, were placed.A small fence separated them from the larger seats in front, and another fence cordoned off the set of twelve seats from a larger area behind where people, most of them moties, were already quietly waiting.The game seemed to have been delayed.Horza sat down on what was either an over designed seat or a rather unimaginative piece of sculpture.He was almost on the highest level of the terraces of the arena, with a good view over most of the rest.There was nobody near by.He reached deep inside his heavy blouse and peeled off some artificial skin from his abdomen.He rolled the skin into a ball and threw it into a large pot that held a small tree, just behind where he sat; then he checked the Aoish credit Tenths, the negotiable memory card, the pocket terminal and the light CRE pistol which had been hidden by the paunch of fake skin.Out of the corner of his eye he saw a small, darkly dressed man approach.The man looked at Horza with his head tilted, from about five metres off, then came closer."Hey, you want to be a Life?""No.Goodbye," Horza said.The small man sniffed and walked off, stopping further along the walkway to prod a shape lying near the edge of a narrow terrace.Horza looked over and saw a woman there raise her head groggily, then shake it slowly, moving sinuous lengths of bedraggled white hair.Her faced showed briefly in the light of an overhead spot; she was beautiful but looked very tired.The small man spoke to her again, but she shook her head and made a motion with one hand.The small man walked off.The flight in the ex Culture shuttle had been relatively uneventful; after some confusion, Horza had succeeded in patching through to the Orbital's navigation system, discovered where he was in relation to the Olmedreca's last known position, and set off to find whatever was left of the Megaship.He'd accessed a news service while gorging himself on Culture emergency rations, and found a report on the Olmedreca in the index.The pictures showed the ship, listing a little and fractionally bow down, floating in a calm sea surrounded by ice, the first kilometre of its hull seemingly buried inside the huge tabular berg.Small aircraft and a few shuttles hovered and flew about the gigantic wreck, like flies above the carcass of a dinosaur.The commentary accompanying the visuals spoke of a mysterious second nuclear explosion aboard the craft.It also reported that when police craft had arrived, the Megaship had proved to be deserted.Hearing that, Horza had immediately altered the shuttle's destination, swinging the craft round, to head for Evanauth.Horza had had three Tenths of an Aoish credit.He had sold the shuttle for five Tenths.It was absurdly cheap, especially given the imminent destruction of the Orbital, but he had been in a hurry, and the dealer who accepted the craft was certainly taking a risk handling the machine; it was very obviously a Culture design, the brain had equally obviously been shot out of it, so there could be little doubt it had been stolen.The Culture would treat the destruction of the craft's consciousness as murder.In three hours Horza had sold the shuttle, bought clothes, cards, a gun, a couple of terminals and some information.All except the information had been cheap.Horza now knew that there was a craft answering the description of the Clear Air Turbulence on the Orbital, or rather underneath it, inside the ex Culture General Systems Vehicle called The Ends of Invention.He found that hard to believe, but there was no other craft it could be.According to the information agency, a ship fitting the CAT's description had been brought on board by one of the Evanauth Port shipbuilders to have repairs made to its warping units; it had arrived under tow two days previously, with only its fusion motors working.He could not, however, find out its name or exact location.It sounded to Horza like the CAT had been used to rescue the survivors of Kraiklyn's band; it must have come over the O wall on remote control, using its warp units.It had picked the Free Company up, then hopped back over again, damaging its warp motors in the process.He had also been unable to find out who the survivors might be, but assumed Kraiklyn must be one of them; nobody else could have brought the CAT over the Edgewall.He hoped he'd find Kraiklyn at the Damage game.Either way, Horza had decided to make for the CAT afterwards.He still intended to head for Schar's World, and the Clear Air Turbulence was the most likely way of getting there.He hoped Yalson was alive.He also hoped it was true about The Ends of Invention being totally demilitarised, and the volume around Vavatch being free of Culture ships.After all this time he wouldn't have put it past the Culture's Minds to have found out about the CAT being in the same volume of space as The Hand of God 137 when it came under attack, and to have made a connection or two.He sat back in the seat  or sculpture  and relaxed, letting the internal pattern of the motie drop from his mind and body.He had to start thinking like Kraiklyn again; he closed his eyes.After a few minutes he could hear things starting to happen down in the lower reaches of the arena.He brought himself to and looked around.The white haired woman who had been lying on the nearby terrace had got up; she was walking, a little unsteadily, down into the arena, her long, heavy dress sweeping over the steps.Horza got up, too, following quickly down the stairs in the wake of her perfume.She didn't look at him when he skipped past her.She was fiddling with an askew tiara.The lights were on over the coloured table where the game would be played.Some of the stages in the auditorium were starting to close up or go dim.People were gradually gravitating towards the game table, to the seats and loungers and standing areas overlooking it.In the glare of the overhead lights, tall figures in black robes moved slowly, checking pieces of the game equipment.They were the adjudicators: Ishlorsinami.The species was renowned for being the most unimaginative, humourless, prissy, honest and incorruptible group in the galaxy and they always officiated at Damage games because hardly anybody else could be trusted.Horza stopped by a food stall to stock up on food and drink; he watched the game table and the figures around it while his order was prepared.The woman with the heavy dress and long white hair passed him, still going down the steps.Her tiara was almost straight, though her long, loose gown was crumpled.She yawned as she went past.Horza paid for his food with a card, then followed the woman again, going towards the growing crowd of people and machines starting to cluster all around the outer perimeter of the game area.The woman looked suspiciously at him when he half ran, half walked down the steps past her again.Horza bribed his way into one of the better terraces.He pulled the hood of his heavy blouse out from the thick collar, stretching it over his forehead and out a little so that his face was in shadow.He didn't want the real Kraiklyn to see him now.The terrace jutted out over lower ones, slanting down with an excellent view of the table itself and the gantries above.Most of the fenced areas around the table were visible too.Horza settled onto a soft lounger near a noisy group of extravagantly dressed tripedals who hooted a lot and kept spitting into a large pot in the centre of their group of gently rocking couches.The Ishlorsinami seemed to have satisfied themselves that everything was working and was set up fairly.They walked down a ramp set into the surface of the arena's ellipsoid floor.Some lights went off; a quietfield slowly cut off the sounds from the rest of the auditorium.Horza took a quick look round.A few stages and sets still showed lights, but they were going out.The slow motion animal trapeze act was still going on, though, high up in the darkness below the stars; the huge ponderous beasts were swinging through the air, field harnesses glittering.They somersaulted and twisted, but now as they did so, passing each other in mid air, they reached out with their clawed paws, slashing slowly and silently at each other's fur.Nobody else seemed to be watching.Horza was surprised to see the woman he had passed twice on the stairs walk past him again and drape herself over a vacant couch which had been reserved near the front of the terrace.Somehow he hadn't thought she would be rich enough to afford this area.Without a fanfare or announcement, the Players of the Eve of Destruction appeared, coming up the ramp in the arena floor, led by a single Ishlorsinami.Horza checked his terminal; it was exactly seven hours standard to the Orbital's destruction.Applause, cheers and, near Horza at least, loud hooting greeted the contestants, though the quietfields muffled everything.As they appeared from the shadows on the ramp, some of the Players acknowledged the crowd who had come to see them play, while other Players totally ignored them.Horza recognised few of them.The ones he did know, or had at least heard of, were Ghalssel, Tengayet Doy Suut, Wilgre and Neeporlax.Ghalssel of Ghalssel's Raiders  probably the most successful of the Free Companies.Horza had heard the mercenary ship arrive from about eleven kilometres away, while he was making the deal with the shuttle saleswomen.She had frozen at the time; her eyes glazed.Horza didn't like to ask whether she thought the noise was the Culture coming to destroy the Orbital a few hours early or just coming to get her for buying a hot shuttle craft.
