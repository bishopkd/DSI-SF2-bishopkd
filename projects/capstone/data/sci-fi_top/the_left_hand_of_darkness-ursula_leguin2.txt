And trust no one.D'you know that?Trust no one.Damn that lying coldblooded traitor, I trusted him.I put the silver chain around his damned neck.I wish I'd hanged him with it.I never trusted him.Never.Don't trust anybody.Let him starve in the cesspits of Mishnory hunting garbage, let his bowels rot, never7mdash;" King Argaven shook, choked, caught his breath with a retching sound, and turned his back on me.He kicked at the logs of the great fire till sparks whirled up thick in his face and fell on his hair and his black tunic, and he caught at them with open hands.Not turning around he spoke in a shrill painful voice: "Say what you've got to say, Mr.Ai. ""May I ask you a question, sir?""Yes. "He swayed from foot to foot as he stood facing the fire.I had to address his back."Do you believe that I am what I say I am?""Estraven had the physicians send me endless tapes about you, and more from the engineers at the Workshops who have your vehicle, and so on.They can't all be liars, and they all say you're not human.What then?""Then, sir, there are others like me.That is, I'm a representative... ""Of this union, this Authority, yes, very well.What did they send you here for, is that what you want me to ask?"Though Argaven might be neither sane nor shrewd, he had had long practice in the evasions and challenges and rhetorical subtleties used in conversation by those whose main aim in life was the achievement and maintenance of the shifgrethor relationship on a high level.Whole areas of that relationship were still blank to me, but I knew something about the competitive, prestige seeking aspect of it, and about the perpetual conversational duel which can result from it.That I was not dueling with Argaven, but trying to communicate with him, was itself an incommunicable fact."I've made no secret of it, sir.The Ekumen wants an alliance, with the nations of Gethen. ""What for?""Material profit.Increase of knowledge.The augmentation of the complexity and intensity of the field of intelligent life.The enrichment of harmony and the greater glory of God.Curiosity.Adventure.Delight. "I was not speaking the tongue spoken by those who rule men, the kings, conquerors, dictators, generals; in that language there was no answer to his question.Sullen and unheeding, Argaven stared at the fire, shifting from foot to foot."How big is this kingdom out in Nowhere, this Ekumen?""There are eighty three habitable planets in the Ekumenical Scope, and on them about three thousand nations or anthrotypic groups "  "Three thousand?I see.Now tell me why we, one against three thousand, should have anything to do with all these nations of monsters living out in the Void?"He turned around now to look at me, for he was still dueling, posing a rhetorical question, almost a joke.But the joke did not go deep.He was as Estraven had warned me uneasy, alarmed."Three thousand nations on eighty three worlds, sir; but the nearest to Gethen is seventeen years' journey in ships that go at near lightspeed.If you've thought that Gethen might be involved in forays and harassments from such neighbors, consider the distance at which they live.Forays are worth no one's trouble, across space. "I did not speak of war, for a good reason; there's no word for it in Karhidish."Trade, however, is worthwhile.In ideas and techniques, communicated by ansible; in goods and artifacts, sent by manned or unmanned ships.Ambassadors, scholars, and merchants, some of them might come here; some of yours might go offworld.The Ekumen is not a kingdom, but a co ordinator, a clearinghouse for trade and knowledge; without it communication between the worlds of men would be haphazard, and trade very risky, as you can see.Men's lives are too short to cope with the time jumps between worlds, if there's no network and centrality, no control, no continuity to work through; therefore they become members of the Ekumen...We are all men, you know, sir.All of us.All the worlds of men were settled, eons ago, from one world, Hain.We vary, but we're all sons of the same Hearth...  "None of this caught the king's curiosity or gave him any reassurance.I went on a bit, trying to suggest that his shifgrethor, or Karhide's, would be enhanced, not threatened by the presence of the Ekumen, but it was no good.Argaven stood there sullen as an old she otter in a cage, swinging back and forth, from foot to foot, back and forth, baring his teeth in a grin of pain.I stopped talking."Are they all as black as you?"Gethenians are yellow brown or red brown, generally, but I had seen a good many as dark as myself."Some are blacker," I said; "we come all colors," and I opened the case (politely examined by the guards of the Palace at four stages of my approach to the Red Hall) that held my ansible and some pictures.The pictures films, photos, paintings, actives, and some cubes were a little gallery of Man: people of Hain, Chiffewar, and the Cetians, of S and Terra and Alterra, of the Utter mosts, Kapteyn, Ollul, Four Taurus, Rokanan, Ensbo, Cime, Gde and Sheashel Haven...The king glanced at a couple without interest."What's this?""A person from Cime, a female. "I had to use the word that Gethenians would apply only to a person in the culminant phase of kemmer, the alternative being their word for a female animal."Permanently?""Yes. "He dropped the cube and stood swinging from foot to foot, staring at me or a little past me, the firelight shifting on his face."They're all like that like you?"This was the hurdle I could not lower for them.They must, in the end, learn to take it in their stride."Yes.Gethenian sexual physiology, so far as we yet know, is unique among human beings. ""So all of them, out on these other planets, are in permanent kemmer?A society of perverts?So Lord Tibe put it; I thought he was joking.Well, it may be the fact, but it's adisgusting idea , Mr.Ai, and I don't see why human beings here on earth should want or tolerate any dealings with creatures so monstrously different.But then, perhaps you're here to tell me I have no choice in the matter. ""The choice, for Karhide, is yours, sir. ""And if I send you packing, too?""Why, I'll go.I might try again, with another generation... "That hit him.He snapped, "Are you immortal?""No, not at all, sir.But the time jumps have their uses.If I left Gethen now for the nearest world, Ollul, I'd spend seventeen years of planetary time getting there.Timejumping is a function of traveling nearly as fast as light.If I simply turned around and came back, my few hours spent on the ship would, here, amount to thirty four years; and I could start all over. "But the idea of timejumping, which with its false hint of immortality had fascinated everyone who listened to me, from the Horden Island fisherman on up to the Prime Minister, left him cold.He said in his shrill harsh voice, "What's that?"pointing to the ansible."The ansible communicator, sir. ""A radio?""It doesn't involve radio waves, or any form of energy.The principle it works on, the constant of simultaneity, is analogous in some ways to gravity " I had forgotten again that I wasn't talking to Estraven, who had read every report on me and who listened intently and intelligently to all my explanations, but instead to a bored king."What it does, sir, is produce a message at any two points simultaneously.Anywhere.One point has to be fixed, on a planet of a certain mass, but the other end is portable.That's this end.I've set the coordinates for the Prime World, Hain.A NAFAL ship takes 67 years to go between Gethen and Hain, but if I write a message on that keyboard it will be received on Hain at the same moment as I write it.Is there any communication you'd care to make with the Stabiles on Hain, sir?""I don't speak Voidish," said the king with his dull, malign grin."They'll have an aide standing ready I alerted them  who can handle Karhidish. ""What d'you mean?How?""Well, as you know, sir, I'm not the first alien to come to Gethen.I was preceded by a team of Investigators, who didn't announce their presence, but passed as well as they could for Gethenians, and traveled about in Karhide and Orgoreyn and the Archipelago for a year.They left, and reported to the Councils of the Ekumen, over forty years ago, during your grandfather's reign.Their report was extremely favorable.And so I studied the information they'd gathered, and the languages they'd recorded, and came.Would you like to see the device working, sir?""I don't like tricks, Mr.Ai. ""It's not a trick, sir.Some of your own scientists have examined "  "I'm not a scientist. ""You're a sovereign, my lord.Your peers on the Prime World of the Ekumen wait for a word from you. "He looked at me savagely.In trying to flatter and interest him I had cornered him in a prestige trap.It was all going wrong."Very well.Ask your machine there what makes a man a traitor. "I typed out slowly on the keys, which were set to Karhidish characters, "King Argaven of Karhide asks the Stabiles on Hain what makes a man a traitor. "The letters burned across the small screen and faded.Argaven watched, his restless shifting stilled for a minute.There was a pause, a long pause.Somebody seventy two light years away was no doubt feverishly punching demands on the language computer for Karhidish, if not on a philosophy storage computer.At last the bright letters burned up out of the screen, hung a while, and faded slowly away: "To King Argaven of Karhide on Gethen, greetings.I do not know what makes a man a traitor.No man considers himself a traitor: this makes it hard to find out.Respectfully, Spimolle G.  F. , for the Stabiles, in Saire on Hain, 93/1491/45. "When the tape was recorded I pulled it out and gave it to Argaven.He dropped it on the table, walked again to the central fireplace, almost into it, and kicked the flaming logs and beat down the sparks with his hands."As useful an answer as I might get from any Foreteller.Answers aren't enough, Mr.Ai.Nor is your box, your machine there.Nor your vehicle, your ship.A bag of tricks and a trickster.You want me to believe you, your tales and messages.But why need I believe, or listen?If there are eighty thousand worlds full of monsters out there among the stars, what of it?We want nothing from them.We've chosen our way of life and have followed it for a long time.Karhide's on the brink of a new epoch, a great new age.We'll go our own way. "He hesitated as if he had lost the thread of his argument not his own argument, perhaps, in the first place.If Estraven was no longer the King's Ear, somebody else was."And if there were anything these Ekumens wanted from us, they wouldn't have sent you alone.It's a joke, a hoax.Aliens would be here by the thousand. ""But it doesn't take a thousand men to open a door, my lord. ""It might to keep it open. ""The Ekumen will wait till you open it, sir.It will force nothing on you.I was sent alone, and remain here alone, in order to make it impossible for you to fear me. ""Fear you?"said the king, turning his shadow scarred face, grinning, speaking loud and high."But I do fear you, Envoy.I fear those who sent you.I fear liars, and I fear tricksters, and worst I fear the bitter truth.And so I rule my country well.Because only fear rules men.Nothing else works.Nothing else lasts long enough.You are what you say you are, yet you're a joke, a hoax.There's nothing in between the stars but void and terror and darkness, and you come out of that all alone trying to frighten me.But I am already afraid, and I am the king.Fear is king!Now take your traps and tricks and go, there's no more needs saying.I have ordered that you be given the freedom of Karhide. "So I departed from the royal presence eck, eck, eckall down the long red floor in the red gloom of the hall, until at last the double doors shut me off from him.I had failed.Failed all around.What worried me as I left the King's House and walked through the Palace grounds, however, was not my failure, but Estraven's part in it.Why had the king exiled him for advocating the Ekumen's cause (which seemed to be the meaning of the proclamation) if (according to the king himself) he had been doing the opposite?When had he started advising the king to steer clear of me, and why?Why was he exiled, and I let go free?Which of them had lied more, and what the devil were they lying for?Estraven to save his skin, I decided, and the king to save his face.The explanation was neat.But had Estraven, in fact, ever lied to me?I discovered that I did not know.I was passing the Corner Red Dwelling.The gates of the garden stood open.I glanced in at the  serem trees leaning white above the dark pool, the paths of pink brick lying deserted in the serene gray light of afternoon.A little snow still lay in the shadow of the rocks by the pool.I thought of Estraven waiting for me there as the snow fell last night, and felt a pang of pure pity for the man whom I had seen in yesterday's parade sweating and superb under the weight of his panoply and power, a man at the prime of his career, potent and magnificent gone now, down, done.Running for the border with his death three days behind him, and no man speaking to him.The death sentence is rare in Karhide.Life on Winter is hard to live, and people there generally leave death to nature or to anger, not to law.I wondered how Estraven, with that sentence driving him, would go.Not in a car, for they were all Palace property here; would a ship or landboat give him passage?Or was he afoot on the road, carrying what he could carry with him?Karhiders go afoot, mostly; they have no beasts of burden, no flying vehicles, the weather makes slow going for powered traffic most of the year, and they are not a people who hurry.I imagined the proud man going into exile step by step, a small trudging figure on the long road west to the Gulf.All this went through my mind and out of it as I passed the gate of the Corner Red Dwelling, and with it went my confused speculations concerning the acts and motives of Estraven and the king.I was done with them.I had failed.What next?I should go to Orgoreyn, Karhide's neighbor and rival.But once I went there I might find it hard to return to Karhide, and I had unfinished business here.I had to keep in mind that my entire life could be, and might well be, used in achieving my mission for the Ekumen.No hurry.No need to rush off to Orgoreyn before I had learned more about Karhide, particularly about the Fastnesses.For two years I had been answering questions, now I would ask some.But not in Erhenrang.I had finally understood that Estraven had been warning me, and though I might distrust his warning I could not disregard it.He had been saying, however indirectly, that I should get away from the city and the court.For some reason I thought of Lord Tibe's teeth...The king had given me the freedom of the country; I would avail myself of it.As they say in Ekumenical School, when action grows unprofitable, gather information; when information grows unprofitable, sleep.I was not sleepy, yet.I would go east to the Fastnesses, and gather information from the Foretellers, perhaps.4.The Nineteenth Day  An East Karhidish story, as told in Gorinhering Hearth by Tobord Chorhawa, and recorded by G.  A. , 93/1492.LORD BEROSTY REM IR IPEcame to Thangering Fastness and offered forty beryls and half the year's yield from his orchards as the price of a Foretelling, and the price was acceptable.He set his question to the Weaver Odren, and the question was,On what day shall I die?The Foretellers gathered and went together into the darkness.At the end of darkness Odren spoke the answer:You will die on Odstreth (the 19th day of any month)."In what month?in how many years?"cried Berosty, but the bond was broken, and there was no answer.He ran into the circle and took the Weaver Odren by the throat choking him and shouted that if he got no further answer he would break the Weaver's neck.Others pulled him off and held him, though he was a strong man.He strained against their hands and cried out, "Give me the answer!"Odren said, "It is given, and the price paid.Go. "Raging then Berosty rem ir Ipe returned to Charuthe, the third Domain of his family, a poor place in northern Osnoriner, which he had made poorer in getting together the price of a Foretelling.He shut himself up in the strong place, in the highest rooms of the Hearth Tower, and would not come out for friend or foe, for seedtime or harvest, for kerrimer or foray, all that month and the next and the next, and six months went by and ten months went by, and he still kept like a prisoner to his room, waiting.On Onnetherhad and Odstreth (the 18th and 19th days of the month) he would not eat any food, nor would he drink, nor would he sleep.His kemmering by love and vow was Herbor of the Geganner clan.This Herbor came in the month of Grende to Thangering Fastness and said to the Weaver, "I seek a Foretelling. ""What have you to pay?"Odren asked, for he saw that the man was poorly dressed and badly shod, and his sledge was old, and everything about him wanted mending."I will give my life," said Herbor."Have you nothing else, my lord?"Odren asked him, speaking now as to a great nobleman, "nothing else to give?""I have nothing else," said Herbor."But I do not know if my life is of any value to you here. ""No," said Odren, "it is of no value to us. "Then Herbor fell on his knees, struck down by shame and love, and cried to Odren, "I beg you to answer my question.It is not for myself!""For whom, then?""asked the Weaver."For my lord and kemmering Ashe Berosty," said the man, and he wept."He has no love nor joy nor lordship since he came here and got that answer which was no answer.He will die of it. ""That he will: what does a man die of but his death?"said the Weaver Odren.But Berber's passion moved him, and at length he said, "I will seek the answer of the question you ask, Herbor, and I will ask no price.But bethink you, there is always a price.The asker pays what he has to pay. ", Then Herbor set Odren's hands against his own eyes in sign of gratitude, and so the Foretelling went forward.The Foretellers gathered and went into the darkness.Herbor went among them and asked his question, and the question was,How long will Ashe Berosty rem ir Ipe live?For Herbor thought thus to get the count of days or years, and so set his love's heart at rest with certain knowledge.Then the Foretellers moved in the darkness and at last Odren cried in great pain, as if he burned in a fire,Longer than Herbor of Geganner!It was not the answer Herbor had hoped, but it was the answer he got, and having a patient heart he went home to Charuthe with it, through the snows of Grende.He came into the Domain and into the strong place and climbed the tower, and there found his kemmering Berosty sitting as ever blank and bleak by an ash smothered fire, his arms lying on a table of red stone, his head sunk between his shoulders."Ashe," said Herbor, "I have been to Thangering Fastness, and have been answered by the Foretellers.I asked them how long you would live and their answer was, Berosty will live longer than Herbor. "Berosty looked up at him as slow as if the hinge in his neck had rusted, and said, "Did you ask them when I would die, then?""I asked how long you would live. ""How long?You fool!You had a question of the Foretellers, and did not ask them when I am to die, what day, month, year, how many days are left to me you askedhow long?O you fool, you staring fool, longer than you, yes, longer than you!"Berosty took up the great table of red stone as if it had been a sheet of tin and brought it down on Herbor's head.Herbor fell, and the stone lay on him.Berosty stood a while demented.Then he raised up the stone, and saw that it had crushed Herbor's skull.He set the stone back on its pedestal.He lay down beside the dead man and put his arms about him, as if they were in kemmer and all was well.So the people of Charuthe found them when they broke into the tower room at last.Berosty was mad thereafter and had to be kept under lock, for he would always go looking for Herbor, who he thought was somewhere" about the Domain.He lived a month thus, and then hanged himself, on Odstreth, the nineteenth day of the month of Thern.5.The Domestication of Hunch  MY LANDLADY,a voluble man, arranged my journey into the East."If a person wants to visit Fastnesses he's got to cross the Kargav.Over the mountains, into Old Karhide, to Her, the old Kings' City.Now I'll tell you, a hearthfellow of mine runs a landboat caravan over the Eskar Pass and yesterday he was telling me over a cup of orsh that they're going to make their first trip this summer on Getheny Osme, it having been such a warm spring and the road already clear up to Engohar and the plows will have the pass clear in another couple of days.Now you won't catch me crossing the Kargav, Erhenrang for me and a roof over my head.But I'm a Yomeshta, praise to the nine hundred Throne Upholders and blest be the Milk of Meshe, and one can be a Yomeshta anywhere.We're a lot of newcomers, see, for my Lord Meshe was born 2,202 years ago, but the Old Way of the Handdara goes back ten thousand years before that.You have to go back to the Old Land if you're after the Old Way.Now look here, Mr.Ai, I'll have a room in this island for you whenever you come back, but I believe you're a wise man to be going out of Erhenrang for a while, for everybody knows that the Traitor made a great show of befriending you at the Palace.Now with old Tibe as the King's Ear things will go smooth again.Now if you go down to the New Port you'll find my hearthfellow there, and if you tell him I sent you... "And so on.He was, as I said, voluble, and having discovered that I had no shifgrethor took every chance to give me advice, though even he disguised it with it's and as ifs.He was the superintendent of my island; I thought of him as my landlady, for he had fat buttocks that wagged as he walked, and a soft fat face, and a prying, spying, ignoble, kindly nature.He was good to me, and also showed my room while I was out to thrill seekers for a small fee: See the Mysterious Envoy's room!He was so feminine in looks and manner that I once asked him how many children he had.He looked glum.He had never borne any.He had, however, sired four.It was one of the little jolts I was always getting.Cultural shock was nothing much compared to the biological shock I suffered as a human male among human beings who were, five sixths of the time, hermaphroditic neuters.The radio bulletins were full of the doings of the new Prime Minister, Pemmer Harge rem ir Tibe.Much of the news concerned affairs up north in the Sinoth Valley.Tibe evidently was going to press Karhide's claim to that region: precisely the kind of action which, on any other world at this stage of civilization, would lead to war.But on Gethen nothing led to war.Quarrels, murders, feuds, forays, vendettas, assassinations, tortures and abominations, all these were in their repertory of human accomplishments; but they did not go to war.They lacked, it seemed, the capacity tomobilize.They behaved like animals, in that respect; or like women.They did not behave like men, or ants.At any rate they never yet had done so.What I knew of Orgoreyn indicated that it had become, over the last five or six centuries, an increasingly mobilizable society, a real nation state.The prestige competition", heretofore mostly economic, might force Karhide to emulate its larger neighbor, to become a nation instead of a family quarrel, as Estraven had said; to become, as Estraven had also said, patriotic.If this occurred the Gethenians might have an excellent chance of achieving the condition of war.I wanted to go to Orgoreyn and see if my guesses concerning it were sound, but I wanted to finish up with Karhide first; so I sold another ruby to the scar faced jeweler in Eng Street, and with no baggage but my money, my ansible, a few instruments and a change of clothes, set off as passenger on a trade caravan on the first day of the first month of summer.The landboats left at daybreak from the windswept loading yards of the New Port.They drove under the Arch and turned east, twenty bulky, quiet running, barge like trucks on caterpillar treads, going single file down the deep streets of Erhenrang through the shadows of morning.They carried boxes of lenses, reels of soundtapes, spools of copper and platinum wire, bolts of plant fiber cloth raised and woven in the West Fall, chests of dried fish flakes from the Gulf, crates of ballbearings and other small machine parts, and ten truck loads of Orgota kardik grain: all bound for the Pering Storm border, the northeast corner of the land.All shipping on the Great Continent is by these electric powered trucks, which go on barges on the rivers and canals where possible.During the deep snow months, slow tractor plows, power sledges, and the erratic ice ships on frozen rivers are the only transport beside skis and manhauled sledges; during the Thaw no form of transport is reliable; so most freight traffic goes with a rush, come summer.The roads then are thick with caravans.Traffic is controlled, each vehicle or caravan being required to keep in constant radio touch with checkpoints along the way.It all moves along, however crowded, quite steadily at the rate of 25 miles per hour (Terran).Gethenians could make their vehicles go faster, but they do not.If asked why not, they answer "Why?"Like asking Terrans why all our vehicles must go so fast; we answer "Why not?"No disputing tastes.Terrans tend to feel they've got to get ahead, make progress.The people of Winter, who always live in the Year One, feel that progress is less important than presence.My tastes were Terran, and leaving Ehrenrang I was impatient with the methodical pace of the caravan; I wanted to get out and run.I was glad to get clear of those long stone streets overhung with black, steep roofs.and innumerable towers, that sunless city where all my chances had turned to fear and betrayal.Climbing the Kargav foothills the caravan halted briefly but often for meals at roadside inns.Along in the afternoon we got our first full view of the range from a foothill summit.We saw Kostor, which is four miles high, from foot to crest; the huge slant of its western slope hid the peaks north of it, some of which go up to thirty thousand feet.South from Kostor one peak after another stood out white against a colorless sky; I counted thirteen, the last an undefined glimmer in the mist of distance in the south.The driver named the thirteen for me, and told me stories of avalanches, and landboats blown off the road by mountain winds, and snowplow crews marooned for weeks in inaccessible heights, and so on, in a friendly effort to terrify me.He described having seen the truck ahead of his skid and go over a thousand foot precipice; what was remarkable, he said, was the slowness with which it fell.It seemed to take all afternoon floating down into the abyss, and he had been very glad to see it at last vanish, with no sound at all, into a forty foot snowdrift at the bottom.At Third Hour we stopped for dinner at a large inn, a grand place with vast roaring fireplaces and vast beam roofed rooms full of tables loaded with good food; but we did not stay the night.Ours was a sleeper caravan, hurrying (in its Karhidish fashion) to be the first of the season into the Pering Storm country, to skim the cream of the market for its merchant entrepreneurs.The truck batteries were recharged, a new shift of drivers took over, and we went on.One truck of the caravan served as sleeper, for drivers only.No beds for passengers.I spent the night in the cold cab on the hard seat, with one break along near midnight for supper at a little inn high in the hills.Karhide is no country for comfort.At dawn I was awake and saw that we had left everything behind except rock, and ice, and light, and the narrow road always going up and up under our treads.I thought, shivering, that there are things that outweigh comfort, unless one is an old woman or a cat.No more inns now, among these appalling slopes of snow and granite.At mealtimes the landboats came silently to a halt one after the other on some thirty degree, snow encroached grade, and  everybody climbed down from the cabs and gathered about the sleeper, from which bowls of hot soup were served, slabs of dried breadapple, and sour beer in mugs.We stood about stamping in the snow, gobbling up food and drink, backs to the bitter wind that was filled with a glittering dust of dry snow.Then back into the landboats, and on, and up.At noon in the passes of Wehoth, at about 14,000 feet, it was 82F.in the sun and 13 in the shade.The electric engines were so quiet that one could hear avalanches grumble down immense blue slopes on the far side of chasms twenty miles across.Late that afternoon we passed the summit, at Eskar, 15,200 feet.Looking up the slope of the southern face of Kostor, up which we had been infinitesimally crawling all day, I saw a queer rock formation a quarter mile or so above the road, a castle like outcropping."See the Fastness up there?"said the driver."That's a building?""That's Ariskostor Fastness. ""But no one could live up here. ""Oh, the Old Men can.I used to drive in a caravan that brought up their food from Erhenrang, late in summer.Of course they can't get in or out for ten or eleven months of the year, but they don't care.There's seven or eight Indwellers up there. "I stared up at the buttresses of rough rock, solitary in the huge solitude of the heights, and I did not believe the driver; but I suspended my disbelief.If any people could survive in such a frozen aerie, they would be Karhiders.The road descending swung far north and far south, edging along precipices, for the east slope of the Kargav is harsher than the west, falling to the plains in great stairsteps, the raw fault blocks of the mountains' making.At sunset we saw a tiny string of dots creeping through a huge white shadow seven thousand feet below: a landboat caravan that had left Erhenrang a day ahead of us.Late the next day we had got down there and were creeping along that same snow slope, very softly, not sneezing, lest we bring down the avalanche.From there we saw for a while, away below and beyond us eastward, vague vast lands blurred with clouds and shadows of clouds and streaked with silver of rivers, the Plains of Rer.At dusk of the fourth day out from Erhenrang we came to Rer.Between the two cities lie eleven hundred miles, and a wall several miles high, and two or three thousand years.The caravan halted outside the Western Gate, where it would be shifted onto canal barges.No landboat or car can enter Rer.It was built before Karhiders used powered vehicles, and they have been using them for over twenty centuries.There are no streets in Rer.There are covered walks, tunnel like, which in summer one may walk through or on top of as one pleases.The houses and islands and Hearths sit every which way, chaotic, in a profuse prodigious confusion that suddenly culminates (as anarchy will do in Karhide) in splendor: the great Towers of the Un Palace, blood red, windowless.Built seventeen centuries ago, those towers housed the kings of Karhide for a thousand years, until Argaven Harge, first of his dynasty, crossed the Kargav and settled the great valley of the West Fall.All the buildings of Rer are fantastically massive, deep founded, weatherproof and waterproof.In winter the wind of the plains may keep the city clear of snow, but when it blizzards and piles up they do not clear the streets, having no streets to clear.They use the stone tunnels, or burrow temporary ones in the snow.Nothing of the houses but the roof sticks out above the snow, and the winter doors may be set under the eaves or in the roof itself, like dormers.The Thaw is the bad time on that plain of many rivers.The tunnels then are storm sewers, and the spaces between buildings become canals or lakes, on which the people of Rer boat to their business, fending off small ice floes with the oars.And always, over the dust of summer, the snowy roof jumble of winter, or the floods of spring, the red Towers loom, the empty heart of the city, indestructible.I lodged in a dreary overpriced inn crouching in the lee of the Towers.I got up at dawn after many bad dreams, and paid the extortioner for bed and breakfast and inaccurate directions as to the way I should take, and set forth afoot to find Otherhord, an ancient Fastness not far from Rer.I was lost within fifty yards of the inn.By keeping the Towers behind me and the huge white loom of the Kargav on my right, I got out of the city headed south, and a farmer's child met on the road told me where to turn off for Otherhord.I came there at noon.That is, I came somewhere at noon, but I wasn't sure where.It was mainly a forest or a thick wood; but the woods were even more carefully tended than is usual in that country of careful foresters, and the path led along the hillside right in among the trees.After a while I became aware that there was a wooden hut just off the path to my right, and then I noticed a quite large wooden building a little farther off to my left; and from somewhere there came a delicious smell of fresh frying fish.I went slowly along the path, a little uneasy.I didn't know how the Handdarata felt about tourists.I knew very little about them in fact.The Handdara is a religion without institution, without priests, without hierarchy, without vows, without creed; I am still unable to say whether it has a God or not.It is elusive.It is always somewhere else.Its only fixed manifestation is in the Fastnesses, retreats to which people may retire and spend the night or a lifetime.I wouldn't have been pursuing this curiously intangible cult into its secret places at all, if I hadn't wanted to answer the question left unanswered by the Investigators: What are the Foretellers, and what do they actually do?I had been longer in Karhide now than the Investigators had, and I doubted that there was anything to the stories of Foretellers and their prophecies.Legends of prediction are common throughout the whole Household of Man.Gods speak, spirits speak, computers speak.Oracular ambiguity or statistical probability provides loopholes, and discrepancies are expunged by Faith.However, the legends were worth investigating.I hadn't yet convinced any Karhider of the existence of telepathic communication; they wouldn't believe it till they "saw" it: my position exactly, regarding the Foretellers of the Handdara.As I went on along the path I realized that a whole village or town was scattered about in the shadow of that slanting forest, all as random as Rer was, but secretive, peaceful, rural.Over every roof and path hung the boughs of the hemmens, the commonest tree of Winter, a stout conifer with thick pale scarlet needles.Hemmen cones littered the branching paths, the wind was scented with hemmen pollen, and all the houses were built of the dark hemmen wood.I stopped at last wondering which door to knock at, when a person came sauntering out of the trees and greeted me courteously."Will you be looking for a dwelling place?"he asked."I've come with a question for the Foretellers. "I had decided to let them take me, at first anyhow, for a Karhider.Like the Investigators I had never had any trouble passing as a native, if I wanted to; among all the Karhidish dialects my accent went unnoticed, and my sexual anomalies were hidden by the heavy clothing.I lacked the fine thick hair thatch and the downward eye slant of the typical Gethenian, and was blacker and taller than most, but not beyond the range of normal variation.My beard had been permanently depilated before I left Ollul (at that time we didn't yet know about the 'pelted' tribes of Perunter, who are not only bearded but hairy all over, like White Terrans).Occasionally I was asked how my nose got broken.I have a flat nose; Gethenian noses are prominent and narrow, with constricted passages, well adapted to breathing subfreezing air.The person on the path at Otherhord looked with mild curiosity at my nose, and answered,  "Then perhaps you'll want to speak to the Weaver?He's down in the glade now, unless he went out with the woodsledge.Or would you rather talk first to one of the Celibates?""I'm not sure.I'm exceedingly ignorant "  The young man laughed and bowed."I am honored!"he said."I've lived here three years, but haven't yet acquired enough ignorance to be worth mentioning. "He was highly amused, but his manner was gentle, and I managed to recollect enough scraps of Handdara lore to realize that I had been boasting, very much as if I'd come up to him and said, "I'm exceedingly handsome...  ""I meant, I don't know anything about the Foretellers "  "Enviable!"said the young Indweller."Behold, we must sully the plain snow with footprints, in order to get anywhere.May I show you the way to the glade?My name is Goss. "It was a first name."Genry," I said, abandoning my 'L'.I followed Goss farther into the chill shade of the forest.The narrow path changed direction often, winding up the slope and down again; here and there, near it or away off among the massive trunks of the hemmens, stood the small, forest colored houses.Everything was red and brown, dank, still, fragrant, gloomy.From one of the houses drifted the faint whistling sweetness of a Karhidish flute.Goss went light and quick, graceful as a girl, some yards ahead of me.All at once his white shirt blazed out, and I came out after him from shadow into full sunlight on a wide green meadow.Twenty feet from us stood a figure, straight, motionless, profiled, the scarlet hieb and white shirt an inlay of bright enamel against the green of the high grass.A hundred yards beyond him stood another statue, in blue and white; this one never moved or glanced our way all the time we talked with the first one.They were practicing the Handdara discipline of Presence, which is a kind of trance the Handdarata, given to negatives, call it an untrance  involving self loss (selfaugmentation?)through extreme sensual receptiveness and awareness.Though the technique is the exact opposite of most techniques of mysticism it probably is a mystical discipline, tending towards the experience of Immanence; but I can't categorize any practice of the Handdarata with certainty.Goss spoke to the person in scarlet.As he broke from his intense movelessness and looked at us and came slowly towards us, I felt an awe of him.In that noon sunlight he shone of his own light.He was as tall as I, and slender, with a clear, open, and beautiful face.As his eyes met mine I was suddenly moved to bespeak him, to try to reach him with the mindspeech I had never used since  I landed on Winter, and should not use, yet.The impulse was stronger than the restraint.I bespoke him.There was no response.No contact was made.He continued to look straight at me.After a moment he smiled and said in a soft, rather high voice, "You're the Envoy, aren't you?"I stammered and said, "Yes. ""My name is Faxe.We're honored to receive you.Will you stay with us in Otherhord a while?""Willingly.I am seeking to learn about your practice of Foretelling.And if there's anything I can tell you in return about what I am, where I come frommdash;"  "Whatever you like," said Faxe with a serene smile."This is a pleasant thing, that you should cross the Ocean of Space, and then add another thousand miles and a crossing of the Kargav to your journey to come to us here. ""I wanted to come to Otherhord because of the fame of its predictions. ""You want to watch us foretelling, then, perhaps.Or have you a question of your own?"His clear eyes compelled truth."I don't know," I said."Nusuth,"said he, "it doesn't matter.Perhaps if you stay a while you'll find if you have a question, or no question...There are only certain times, you know, when the Foretellers are able to meet together, so in any case you'd dwell with us some days. "I did, and they were pleasant days.Time was unorganized except for the communal work, field labor, gardening, woodcutting, maintenance, for which transients such as myself were called on by whatever group most needed a hand.Aside from the work, a day might pass without a word spoken; those I talked with most often were young Goss, and Faxe the Weaver, whose extraordinary character, as limpid and unfathomable as a well of very clear water, was a quintessence of the character of the place.In the evenings there might be a gathering in the hearth room of one or another of the low, tree surrounded houses; there was conversation, and beer, and there might be music, the vigorous music of Karhide, melodically simple but rhythmically complex, always played extempore.One night two Indwellers danced, men so old that their hair had whitened, and their limbs were skinny, and the downward folds at the outer eye corners half hid their dark eyes.Their dancing was slow, precise, controlled; it fascinated eye and mind.They began dancing during Third Hour after dinner.Musicians joined in and dropped out at will, all but the drummer who never stopped his subtle changing beat.The two old dancers were still dancing at Sixth Hour, midnight, after five Terran hours.This was the first time I had seen the phenomenon ofdothe  the voluntary, controlled use of what we call "hysterical strength" and thereafter I was readier to believe tales concerning the Old Men of the Handdara.It was an introverted life, self sufficient, stagnant, steeped in that singular "ignorance" prized by the Handdarata and obedient to their rule of inactivity or noninterference.That rule (expressed in the wordnusuth, which I have to translate as "no matter") is the heart of the cult, and I don't pretend to understand it.But I began to understand Karhide better, after a halfmonth in Otherhord.Under that nation's politics and parades and passions runs an old darkness, passive, anarchic, silent, the fecund darkness of the Handdara.And out of that silence inexplicably rises the Foreteller's voice.Young Goss, who enjoyed acting as my guide, told me that my question to the Foretellers could concern anything and be phrased as I liked."The more qualified and limited the question, the more exact the answer," he said."Vagueness breeds vagueness.And some questions of course are not answerable. ""What if I ask one of those?"I inquired.This hedging seemed sophisticated, but not unfamiliar.But I did not expect his answer: "The Weaver will refuse it.Unanswerable questions have wrecked Foretelling groups. ""Wrecked them?""Do you know the story of the Lord of Shorth, who forced the Foretellers of Asen Fastness to answer the questionWhat is the meaning of life?Well, it was a couple of thousand years ago.The Foretellers stayed in the darkness for six days and nights.At the end, all the Celibates were catatonic, the Zanies were dead, the Pervert clubbed the Lord of Shorth to death with a stone, and the Weaver...He was a man named Meshe. ""The founder of the Yomesh cult?""Yes," said Goss, and laughed as if the story was very funny, but I didn't know whether the joke was on the Yomeshta or on me.I had decided to ask a yes or no question, which might at least make plain the extent and kind of obscurity or ambiguity in the answer.Faxe confirmed what Goss had said, that the matter of the question could be one of which the Foretellers were perfectly ignorant.I could ask if the hoolm crops would be good this year in the northern hemisphere of S, and they would answer, having no previous knowledge even of the existence of a planet called S.  This seemed to put the business on the plane of pure chance divination, along with yarrow stalks and flipped coins.No, said Faxe,  not at all, chance was not involved.The whole process was in fact precisely the reverse of chance."Then you mindread. ""No," said Faxe, with his serene and candid smile."You mindread without knowing you're doing it, perhaps. ""What good would that be?If the asker knew the answer he wouldn't pay our price for it. "I chose a question to which I certainly lacked the answer.Only time could prove the Foretelling right or wrong, unless it was, as I expected, one of those admirable professional prophecies applicable to any outcome.It was not a trivial question; I had given up the notion of asking when it would stop raining, or some such trifle, when I learned that the undertaking was a hard and dangerous one for the nine Foretellers of Otherhord.The cost was high for the asker two of my rubies went to the coffers of the Fastness but higher for the answerers.And as I got to know Faxe, if it became difficult to believe that he was a professional faker it became still more difficult to believe that he was an honest, self deluded faker; his intelligence was as hard, clear, and polished as my rubies.I dared set no trap for him.I asked what I most wanted to know.On Onnetherhad, the 18th of the month, the nine met together in a big building usually kept locked: one high hall, stone floored and cold, dimly lighted by a couple of slit windows and a fire in the deep hearth at one end.They sat on the bare stone in a circle, all of them cloaked and hooded, rough still shapes like a circle of dolmens in the faint glow of the fire yards away.Goss, and a couple of other young Indwellers, and a physician from the nearest Domain, watched in silence from seats by the hearth while I crossed the hall and entered the circle.It was all very informal, and very tense.One of the hooded figures looked up as I came amongst them, and I saw a strange face, coarse featured, heavy, with insolent eyes watching me.Faxe sat cross legged, not moving, but charged, full of a gathering force that made his light, soft voice crack like an electric bolt."Ask," he said.I stood within the circle and asked my question."Will this world Gethen be a member of the Ekumen of Known Worlds, five years from now?"Silence.I stood there, I hung in the center of a spider web woven of silence."It is answerable," the Weaver said quietly.There was a relaxation.The hooded stones seemed to soften into movement; the one who had looked so strangely at me began to whisper to his neighbor.I left the circle and joined the watchers by the hearth.Two of the Foretellers remained withdrawn, unspeaking.One of them lifted his left hand from time to time and patted the floor lightly and swiftly ten or twenty times, then sat motionless again.I had seen neither of them before; they were the Zanies, Goss said.They were insane.Goss called them "time dividers," which may mean schizophrenics.
