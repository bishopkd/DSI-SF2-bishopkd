Massive cerebral hemorrhage.No He watched the dials.No  warning, no indication of anything out of the ordinary; blood pressure up, pulse up, but normal under the circumstances  nothing to  indicate He reached down and popped her suit.Her fine oriental features were distorted in a horrible grimace, both gums showing.Sticky fluid ran from under her collapsed eyelids, and a trickle of blood still dripped from each ear.Doc Wilson closed the suit back up.Ive never seen anything like it.Its as if a bomb went off in her skull.Oh fuck, Rogers said, she was Rhine sensitive, wasnt she.Thats right, Cortez sounded thoughtful.All right, everybody listen up.Platoon leaders, check your platoons and see if anybodys missing, or hurt.Anybody else in seventh?I  Ive got a splitting headache, Sarge, Lucky said.Four others had bad headaches.One of them affirmed that he was slightly Rhine sensitive.The others didnt know.Cortez, I think its obvious, Doc Wilson said, that we should give these  monsters wide berth, especially shouldnt harm any more of them.Not with five people susceptible to whatever apparently killed Ho.Of course, God damn it, I dont need anybody to tell me that.Wed better get moving.I just filled the captain in on what happened; he agrees that wed better get as far away from here as we can, before we stop for the night.Lets get back in formation and continue on the same bearing.Fifth platoon, take over point; second, come back to the rear.Everybody else, same as before.What about Ho?Lucky asked.Shell be taken care of.From the ship.After wed gone half a klick, there was a flash and rolling thunder: Where Ho had been came a wispy luminous mushroom cloud boiling up to disappear against the gray sky.13  We stopped for the night  actually, the sun wouldnt set for another seventy hours  atop a slight rise some ten klicks from where we had killed the aliens.But they werent aliens, I had to remind myself  we were.Two platoons deployed in a ring around the rest of us, and we flopped down exhausted.Everybody was allowed four hours sleep and had two hours guard duty.Potter came over and sat next to me.I chinned her frequency.Hi, Marygay.Oh, William, her voice over the radio was hoarse and cracking.God, its so horrible.Its over now  I killed one of them, the first instant, I shot it right in the, in the  I put my hand on her knee.The contact had a plastic click and I jerked it back, visions of machines embracing, copulating.Dont feel singled out, Marygay; whatever guilt there is, is  belongs evenly to all of us,  but a triple portion for Cortez  You privates quit jawin and get some sleep.You both pull guard in two hours.OK, Sarge.Her voice was so sad and tired I couldnt bear it.I felt if I could only touch her, I could drain off the sadness like ground wire draining current, but we were each trapped in our own plastic world    Gnight, William.Night.Its almost impossible to get sexually excited inside a suit, with the relief tube and all the, silver chloride sensors poking you, but somehow this was my bodys response to the emotional impotence, maybe remembering more pleasant sleeps with Marygay, maybe feeling that in the midst of all this death, personal death could be very soon, cranking up the procreative derrick for one last try  lovely thoughts like this.I fell asleep and dreamed that I was a machine, mimicking the functions of life, creaking and clanking my clumsy way through a world, people too polite to say anything but giggling behind my back, and the little man who sat inside my head pulling the levers and clutches and watching the dials, he was hopelessly mad and was storing up hurts for the day  Mandella  wake up, goddammit, your shift!I shuffled over to my place on the perimeter to watch for god knows what  but I was so weary I couldnt keep my eyes open.Finally I tongued a stimtab, knowing Id pay for it later.For over an hour I sat there, scanning my sector left, right, near, far, the scene never changing, not even a breath of wind to stir the grass.Then suddenly the grass parted and one of the three legged creatures was right in front of me.I raised my finger but didnt squeeze.Movement!Movement!Jesus Chri  theres one right  HOLD YOUR FIRE!For shits sake dont shoot!Movement.Movement.I looked left and right, and as far as I could see, every perimeter guard had one of the blind, dumb creatures standing right in front of him.Maybe the drug Id taken to stay awake made me more sensitive to whatever they did.My scalp crawled and I felt a formless thing in my mind, the feeling you get when somebody has said something and you didnt quite hear it, want to respond, but the opportunity to ask him to repeat it is gone.The creature sat back on its haunches, leaning forward on the one front leg.Big green bear with a withered arm.Its power threaded through my mind, spiderwebs, echo of night terrors, trying to communicate, trying to destroy me, I couldnt know.All right, everybody on the perimeter, fall back, slow.Dont make any quick gestures  Anybody got a headache or anything?Sergeant, this is Hollister.Lucky.Theyre trying to say something  I can almost  no, just  All I can get is that they think were, think were  well, funny.Theyre not afraid.You mean the one in front of you isnt  No, the feeling comes from all of them, theyre all thinking the same thing.Dont ask me how I know, I just do.Maybe they thought it was funny, what they did to Ho.Maybe.I dont feel theyre dangerous.Just curious about us.Sergeant, this is Bohrs.Yeah.The Tauransve been here at least a year  maybe theyve learned how to communicate with these  overgrown teddy bears.They might be spying on us, might be sending back  I dont think theyd show themselves if that were the case, Lucky said.They can obviously hide from us pretty well when they want to.Anyhow, Cortez said, if theyre spies, the damage has been done.Dont think itd be smart to take any action against them.I know youd all like to see em dead for what they did to Ho, so would I, but wed better be careful.I didnt want to see them dead, but Id just as soon not have seen them in any condition.I was walking backwards slowly, toward the middle of camp.The creature didnt seem disposed to follow.Maybe he just knew we were surrounded.He was pulling up grass with his arm and munching.OK, all of you platoon leaders, wake everybody up, get a roll count.Let me know if anybodys been hurt.Tell your people were moving out in one minute.I dont know what Cortez had expected, but of course the creatures followed right along.They didnt keep us surrounded; just had twenty or thirty following us all the time.Not the same ones, either.Individuals would saunter away, and new ones would join the parade.It was pretty obvious that they werent going to tire out.We were each allowed one stimtab.Without it, no one could have marched an hour.A second pill would have been welcome after the edge started to wear off, but the mathematics of the situation forbade it; we were still thirty klicks from the enemy base, fifteen hours marching at the least.And though you could stay awake and energetic for a hundred hours on the tabs, aberrations of judgment and perception snowballed after the second one, until in extremis the most bizarre hallucinations would be taken at face value, and a person could fidget for hours deciding whether to have breakfast.Under artificial stimulation, the company traveled with great energy for the first six hours, was slowing by the seventh, and ground to an exhausted halt after nine hours and nineteen kilometers.The teddy bears had never lost sight of us and, according to Lucky, had never stopped broadcasting.Cortezs decision was that we would stop for seven hours, each platoon taking one hour of perimeter guard.I was never so glad to have been in the seventh platoon, as we stood guard the last shift and thus were able to get six hours of uninterrupted sleep.In the few moments I lay awake after finally lying down, the thought came to me that the next time I closed my eyes could well be the last.And partly because of the drug hangover, mostly because of the past days horrors, I found that I really didnt give a shit.14  Our first contact with the Taurans came during my shift.The teddy bears were still there when I woke up and replaced Doc Jones on guard.Theyd gone back to their original formation, one in front of each guard position.The one who was waiting for me seemed a little larger than normal, but otherwise looked just like all the others.All the grass had been cropped where he was sitting, so he occasionally made forays to the left or right.But he always returned to sit right in front of me, you would say staring if he had had anything to stare with.We had been facing each other for about fifteen minutes when Cortezs voice rumbled:  Awright everybody, wake up and get hid!I followed instinct and flopped to the ground and rolled into a tall stand of grass.Enemy vessel overhead.His voice was almost laconic.Strictly speaking, it wasnt really overhead, but rather passing somewhat east of us.It was moving slowly, maybe a hundred klicks per hour, and looked like a broomstick surrounded by a dirty soap bubble.The creature riding it was a little more human looking than the teddy bears, but still no prize.I cranked my image amplifier up to forty log two for a closer look.He had two arms and two legs, but his waist was so small you could encompass it with both hands.Under the tiny waist was a large horseshoe shaped pelvic structure nearly a meter wide, from which dangled two long skinny legs with no apparent knee joint.Above that waist his body swelled out again, to a chest no smaller than the huge pelvis.His arms looked surprisingly human, except that they were too long and undermuscled.There were too many fingers on his hands.Shoulderless, neckless.His head was a nightmarish growth that swelled like a goiter from his massive chest.Two eyes that looked like clusters of fish eggs, a bundle of tassels instead of a nose, and a rigidly open hole that might have been a mouth sitting low down where his adams apple should have been.Evidently the soap bubble contained an amenable environment, as he was wearing absolutely nothing except his ridged hide, that looked like skin submerged too long in hot water, then dyed a pale orange.He had no external genitalia, but nothing that might hint of mammary glands.So we opted for the male pronoun by default.Obviously, he either didnt see us or, thought we were part of the herd of teddy bears.He never looked back at us, but just continued in the same direction we were headed, .05 rad east of north.Might as well go back to sleep now, if you can sleep after looking at that thing.We move out at 0435.Forty minutes.Because of the planets opaque cloud cover, there had been no way to tell, from space, what the enemy base looked like or how big it was.We only knew its position, the same way we knew the position the scoutships were supposed to land on.So it too could easily have been underwater, or underground.But some of the drones were reconnaissance ships as well as decoys: and in their mock attacks on the base, one managed to get close enough to take a picture.Captain Stott beamed down a diagram of the place to Cortez  the only one with a visor in his suit when we were five klicks from the bases radio position.We stopped and he called all the platoon leaders in with the seventh platoon to confer.Two teddy bears loped in, too.We tried to ignore them.OK, the captain sent down some pictures of our objective.Im going to draw a map; you platoon leaders copy.They took pads and styli out of their leg pockets, while Cortez unrolled a large plastic mat.He gave it a shake to randomize any residual charge, and turned on his stylus.Now, were coming from this direction.He put an arrow at the bottom of the sheet.First thing well hit is this row of huts, probably billets or bunkers, but who the hell knows  Our initial objective is to destroy these buildings  the whole base is on a flat plain; theres no way we could really sneak by them.Potter here.Why cant we jump over them?Yeah, we could do that, and wind up completely surrounded, cut to ribbons.We take the buildings.After we do that  all I can say is that well have to think on our feet.From the aerial reconnaissance, we can figure out the function of only a couple of buildings  and that stinks.We might wind up wasting a lot of time demolishing the equivalent of an enlisted mens bar, ignoring a huge logistic computer because it looks like  a garbage dump or something.Mandella here, I said.Isnt there a spaceport of some kind  seems to me we ought to  Ill get to that, damn it.Theres a ring of these huts all around the camp, so weve got to break through somewhere.This placell be closest, less chance of giving away our position before we attack.Theres nothing in the whole place that actually looks like a weapon.That doesnt mean anything, though; you could hide a gigawatt laser in each of those huts.Now, about five hundred meters from the huts, in the middle of the base, well come to this big flower shaped structure.Cortez drew a large symmetrical shape that looked like the outline of a flower with seven petals.What the hell this is, your guess is as good as mine.Theres only one of them, though, so we dont damage it any more than we have to.Which means  we blast it to splinters if I think its dangerous.Now, as far as your spaceport, Mandella, is concerned  there just isnt one.Nothing.That cruiser the Hope caulked had probably been left in orbit, like ours has to be.If they have any equivalent of a scoutship, or drone missiles, theyre either not kept here or theyre well hidden.Bohrs here.Then what did they attack with, while we were coming down from orbit?I wish we knew, Private.Obviously, we dont have any way of estimating their numbers, not directly.Recon pictures failed to show a single Tauran on the grounds of the base.Meaning nothing, because it is an alien environment.Indirectly, though  we count the number of broomsticks, those flying things.There are fifty one huts, and each has at most one broomstick.Four dont have any parked outside, but we located three at various other parts of the base.Maybe this indicates that there are fifty one Taurans, one of whom was outside the base when the picture was taken.Keating here.Or fifty one officers.Thats right maybe fifty thousand infantrymen stacked in one of these buildings.No way to tell.Maybe ten Taurans, each with five broomsticks, to use according to his mood.Weve got one thing in our favor, and thats communications.They evidently use a frequency modulation of megahertz electromagnetic radiation.Radio!Thats right, whoever you are.Identify yourself when you speak.So its quite possible that they cant detect our phased neutrino communications.Also, just prior to the attack, the Hope is going to deliver a nice dirty fission bomb; detonate it in the upper atmosphere right over the base.Thatll restrict them to line of sight communications for some time; even those will be full of static.Why dont  Tate here  why dont they just drop the bomb right in their laps.Save us a lot of  That doesnt even deserve an answer, Private.But the answer is, they might.And you better hope they dont.If they caulk the base, itll be for the safety of the Hope.After weve attacked, and probably before were far enough away for it to make much difference.We keep that from happening by doing a good job.We have to reduce the base to where it can no longer function; at the same time, leave as much intact as possible.And take one prisoner.Potter here.You mean, at least one prisoner.I mean what I say.One only.Potter  youre relieved of your platoon.Send Chavez up.All right, Sergeant.The relief in her voice was unmistakable.Cortez continued with his map and instructions.There was one other building whose function was pretty obvious; it had a large steerable dish antenna on top.We were to destroy it as soon as the grenadiers got in range.The attack plan was very loose.Our signal to begin would be the flash of the fission bomb.At the same time, several drones would converge on the base, so we could see what their antispacecraft defenses were.We would try to reduce the effectiveness of those defenses without destroying them completely.Immediately after the bomb and the drones, the grenadiers would vaporize a line of seven huts.Everybody would break through the hole into the base  and what would happen after that was anybodys guess.Ideally, wed sweep from that end of the base to the other, destroying certain targets, caulking all but one Tauran.But that was unlikely to happen, as it depended on the Taurans offering very little resistance.On the other hand, if the Taurans showed obvious superiority from the beginning, Cortez would give the order to scatter.Everybody had a different compass bearing for retreat  wed blossom out in all directions, the survivors to rendezvous in a valley some forty klicks east of the base.Then wed see about a return engagement, after the Hope softened the base up a bit.One last thing, Cortez rasped.Maybe some of you feel the way Potter evidently does, maybe some of your men feel that way  that we ought to go easy, not make this so much of a bloodbath.Mercy is a luxury, a weakness we cant afford to indulge in at this stage of the war.All we know about the enemy is that they have killed seven hundred and ninety eight humans.They havent shown any restraint in attacking our cruisers, and itd be foolish to expect any this time, this first ground action.They are responsible for the lives of all of your comrades who died in training, and for Ho, and for all the others who are surely going to die today.I cant understand anybody who wants to spare them.But that doesnt make any difference.You have your orders and, what the hell, you might as well know, all of you have a post hypnotic suggestion that I will trigger by a phrase, just before the battle.It will make your job easier.Sergeant  Shut up.Were short on time; get back to your platoons and brief them.We move out in five minutes.The platoon leaders returned to their men, leaving Cortez and ten of us  plus three teddy bears, milling around, getting in the way.15  We took the last five klicks very carefully, sticking to the highest grass, running across occasional clearings.We were 500 meters from where the base was supposed be, Cortez took the third platoon forward to scout, while the rest of us laid low.Cortezs voice came over the general freak: Looks pretty much like we expected.Advance in a file, crawling.When you get to the third platoon, follow your squad leader to the left or right.We did that and wound up with a string of eighty three people in a line roughly perpendicular to the direction of attack.We were pretty well hidden, except for the dozen or so teddy bears that mooched along the line, munching grass.There was no sign of life inside the base.All of the buildings were windowless and a uniform shiny white.The huts that were our first objective were large featureless halfburied eggs some sixty meters apart.Cortez assigned one to each grenadier.We were broken into three fire teams: team A consisted of platoons two, four, and six; team B was one, three, and five; the command platoon was team C.   Less than a minute now  filters down!when I sayfire, grenadiers, take out your targets.God help you if you miss.There was a sound like a giants belch, and a stream of five or six iridescent bubbles floated up from the flowershaped building.They rose with increasing speed until they were almost out of sight, then shot off to the south, over our heads.The ground was suddenly bright, and for the first time in a long time, I saw my shadow, a long one pointed north.The bomb had gone off prematurely.I just had time to think that it didnt make too much difference; itd still make alphabet soup out of their communications  Drones!A ship came screaming in just about tree level, and a bubble was in the air to meet it.When they contacted, the bubble popped and the drone exploded into a million tiny fragments.Another one came from the opposite side and suffered the same fate.FIRE!Seven bright glares of 500 microton grenades and a sustained concussion that surely would have killed an unprotected man.Filters up.Gray haze of smoke and dust.Clods of dirt falling with a sound like heavy raindrops.Listen up:  		Scots, wha hae wi Wallace bled; 		Scots, wham Bruce has aften led, 		Welcome to your gory bed, 		Or to victory!I hardly heard him for trying to keep track of what was going on in my skull.I knew it was just post hypnotic suggestion, even remembered the session in Missouri when theyd implanted it, but that didnt make it any less compelling.My mind reeled under the strong pseudo memories: shaggy hulks that were Taurans (not at all what we now knew they looked like) boarding a colonists vessel, eating babies while mothers watched in screaming terror (the colonists never took babies; they wouldnt stand the acceleration), then raping the women to death with huge veined purple members (ridiculous that they would feel desire for humans), holding the men down while they plucked flesh from their living bodies and gobbled it (as if they could assimilate the alien protein)  a hundred grisly details as sharply remembered as the events of a minute ago, ridiculously overdone and logically absurd.But while my conscious mind was rejecting the silliness, somewhere much deeper, down in that sleeping animal where we keep our real motives and morals, something was thirsting for alien blood, secure in the conviction that the noblest thing a man could do would be to die killing one of those horrible monsters   I knew it was all purest soyashit, and I hated the men who had taken such obscene liberties with my mind, but I could even hear my teeth grinding, feel my cheeks frozen in a spastic grin, blood lust  A teddy bear walked in front of me, looking dazed.I started to raise my laserfinger, but somebody beat me to it and the creatures head exploded in a cloud of gray splinters and blood.Lucky groaned, half whining, Dirty  filthy fucken bastards.Lasers flared and crisscrossed, and all of the teddy bears fell dead.Watch it, goddammit, Cortez screamed.Aim those fuckin things they arent toys!Team A, move out  into the craters to cover B.   Somebody was laughing and sobbing.What the fuck is wrong with you, Petrov?Strange to hear Cortez cussing.I twisted around and saw Petrov, behind and to my left, lying in a shallow hole, digging frantically with both hands, crying and gurgling.Fuck, Cortez said.Team B!Ten meters past the craters, get down in a line.Team C  into the craters with A.   I scrambled up and covered the hundred meters in twelve amplified strides.The craters were practically large enough to hide a scoutship, some ten meters in diameter.I jumped to the opposite side of the hole and landed next to a fellow named Chin.He didnt even look around when I landed, just kept scanning the base for signs of life.Team A  ten meters, past team B, down in line.Just as he finished, the building in front of us burped, and a salvo of the bubbles fanned out toward our lines.Most people saw it coming and got down, but Chin was just getting up to make his rush and stepped right into one.It grazed the top of his helmet and disappeared with a faint pop.He took one step backwards and toppled over the edge of the crater, trailing an arc of blood and brains.Lifeless, spread eagled, he slid halfway to the bottom, shoveling dirt into the perfectly symmetrical hole where the bubble had chewed indiscriminately through plastic, hair, skin, bone, and brain.Everybody hold it.Platoon leaders, casualty report  check  check, check  check, check, check  check.We have three deaders.Wouldnt be any if youd have kept low.So everybody grab dirt when you hear that thing go off.Team A, complete the rush.They completed the maneuver without incident.OK.Team C, rush to where B  hold it!Down!Everybody was already hugging the ground.The bubbles slid by in a smooth arc about two meters off the ground.They went serenely over our heads and, except for one that made toothpicks out of a tree, disappeared in the distance.B, rush past A ten meters.C, take over Bs place.You B grenadiers, see if you can reach the Flower.Two grenades tore up the ground thirty or forty meters from the structure.In a good imitation of panic, it started belching out a continuous stream of bubbles  still, none coming lower than two meters off the ground.We kept hunched down and continued to advance.Suddenly, a seam appeared in the building and widened to the size of a large door.Taurans came swarming out.Grenadiers, hold your fire.B team, laser fire to the left and right keepm bunched up.A and C, rush down the center.One Tauran died trying to run through a laser beam.The others stayed where they were.In a suit, its pretty awkward to run and keep your head down at the same time.You have to go from side to side, like a skater getting started; otherwise youll be airborne.At least one person, somebody in A team, bounced too high and suffered the same fate as Chin.I was feeling pretty fenced in and trapped, with a wall of laser fire on each side and a low ceiling that meant death to touch.But in spite of myself, I felt happy, euphoric, finally getting the chance to kill some of those villainous baby eaters.Knowing it was soyashit.They werent fighting back, except for the rather ineffective bubbles (obviously not designed as an anti personnel weapon), and they didnt retreat back into the building, either.They milled around, about a hundred of them, and watched us get closer.A couple of grenades would caulk them all, but I guess Cortez was thinking about the prisoner.OK, when I saygo, were going to flank em.B team will hold fire  Second and fourth platoons to the right, sixth and seventh to the left.B team will move forward in line to box them in.Go!We peeled off to the left.As soon as the lasers stopped, the Taurans bolted, running in a group on a collision course with our flank.A team, down and fire!Dont shoot until youre sure of your aim if you miss you might hit a friendly.And fer Chris sake save me one!It was a horrifying sight, that herd of monsters bearing down on us.They were running in great leaps  the bubbles avoiding them  and they all looked like the one we saw earlier, riding the broomstick; naked except for an almost transparent sphere around their whole bodies, that moved along with them.The right flank started firing, picking off individuals in the rear of the pack.Suddenly a laser flared through the Taurans from the other side, somebody missing his mark.There was a horrible scream, and I looked down the line to see someone  I think it was Perry  writhing on the ground, right hand over the smoldering stump of his arm, seared off just below the elbow.Blood sprayed through his fingers, and the suit, its camouflage circuits scrambled, flickered black white jungle desert green gray.I dont know how long I stared  long enough for the medic to run over and start giving aid  but when I looked up the Taurans were almost on top of me.My first shot was wild and high, but it grazed the top of the leading Taurans protective bubble.The bubble disappeared and the monster stumbled and fell to the ground, jerking spasmodically.Foam gushed out of his mouth hole, first white, then streaked red.With one last jerk he became rigid and twisted backwards, almost to the shape of a horseshoe.His long scream, a high pitched whistle, stopped just as his comrades trampled over him.I hated myself for smiling.It was slaughter, even though our flank was outnumbered five to one.They kept coming without faltering, even when they had to climb over the drift of bodies and parts of bodies that piled up high, parallel to our flank.The ground between us was slick red with Tauran blood  all Gods children got hemoglobin  and like the teddy bears, their guts looked pretty much like guts to my untrained eye.My helmet reverberated with hysterical laughter while we slashed them to gory chunks, and I almost didnt hear Cortez:  Hold your fire  I said HOLD IT, goddammit!Catch a couple of the bastards, they wont hurt you.I stopped shooting and eventually so did everybody else.When the next Tauran jumped over the smoking pile of meat in front of me, I dove to try to tackle him around those spindly legs.It was like hugging a big, slippery balloon.When I tried to drag him down, he popped out of my arms and kept running.We managed to stop one of them by the simple expedient of piling half a dozen people on top of him.By that time the others had run through our line and were headed for the row of large cylindrical tanks that Cortez had said were probably for storage.A little door had opened in the base of each one.Weve got our prisoner, Cortez shouted.Kill!They were fifty meters away and running hard, difficult targets.Lasers slashed around them, bobbing high and low.One fell, sliced in two, but the others, about ten of them, kept going and were almost to the doors when the grenadiers started firing.They were still loaded with 500 mike bombs, but a near miss wasnt enough  the concussion would just send them flying, unhurt in their bubbles.The buildings!Get the fucken buildings!The grenadiers raised their aim and let fly, but the bombs only seemed to scorch the white outside of the structures until, by chance, one landed in a door.That split the building just as if it had a seam; the two halves popped away and a cloud of machinery flew into the air, accompanied by a huge pale flame that rolled up and disappeared in an instant.Then the others all concentrated on the doors, except for potshots at some of the Taurans, not so much to get them as to blow them away before they could get inside.They seemed awfully eager.All this time, we were trying to get the Taurans with laser fire, while they weaved and bounced around trying to get into the structures.We moved in as close to them as we could without putting ourselves in danger from the grenade blasts, yet too far away for good aim.Still, we were getting them one by one and managed to destroy four of the seven buildings.Then, when there were only two aliens left, a nearby grenade blast flung one of them to within a few meters of a door.He dove in and several grenadiers fired salvos after him, but they all fell short or detonated harmlessly on the side.Bombs were falling all around, making an awful racket, but the sound was suddenly drowned out by a great sigh, like a giants intake of breath, and where the building had been was a thick cylindrical cloud of smoke, solid looking, dwindling away into the stratosphere, straight as if laid down by a ruler.The other Tauran had been right at the base of the cylinder; I could see pieces of him flying.A second later, a shock wave hit us and I rolled helplessly, pinwheeling, to smash into the pile of Tauran bodies and roll beyond.I picked myself up and panicked for a second when I saw there was blood all over my suit  when I realized it was only alien blood, I reIaxed but felt unclean.Catch the bastard!Catch him!In the confusion, the Tauran had gotten free and was running for the grass.One platoon was chasing after him, losing ground, but then all of B team ran over and cut him off.I jogged over to join in the fun.There were four people on top of him, and a ring around them of about fifty people, watching the struggle.Spread out, dammit!There might be a thousand more of them waiting to get us in one place.We dispersed, grumbling.By unspoken agreement we were all sure that there were no more live Taurans on the face of the planet.Cortez was walking toward the prisoner while I backed away.Suddenly the four men collapsed in a pile on top of the creature  Even from my distance I could see the foam spouting from his mouth hole.His bubble had popped.Suicide.Damn!Cortez was right diere.Get off that bastard, The four men got off and Cortez used his laser to slice the monster into a dozen quivering chunks.Heart warming sight.Thats all right, though, well find another one  everybody!Back in the arrowhead formation.Combat assault, on the Flower.Well, we assaulted the Flower, which had evidently run out of ammunition (it was still belching, but no bubbles), and it was empty.We scurried up ramps and through corridors, fingers at the ready, like kids playing soldier.There was nobody home.The same lack of response at the antenna installation, the Salami, and twenty other major buildings, as well as the forty four perimeter huts still intact.So we had captured dozens of buildings, mostly of incomprehensible purpose, but failed in our main mission, capturing a Tauran for the xenologists to experiment with.Oh well, they could have all the bits and pieces theyd ever want.That was something.After wed combed every last square centimeter of the base, a scoutship came in with the real exploration crew, the scientists.Cortez said, All right, snap out of it, and the hypnotic compulsion fell away.At first it was pretty grim.A lot of the people, like Lucky and Marygay, almost went crazy with the memories of bloody murder multiplied a hundred times.Cortez ordered everybody to take a sedtab, two for the ones most upset.I took two without being specifically ordered to do so.Because it was murder, unadorned butchery  once we had the antispacecraft weapon doped out, we hadnt been in any danger.The Taurans hadnt seemed to have any conception of person to person fighting.We had just herded them up and slaughtered them, the first encounter between mankind and another intelligent species.Maybe it was the second encounter, counting the teddy bears.What might have happened if we had sat down and tried to communicate?But they got the same treatment.I spent a long time after that telling myself over and over that it hadnt been me who so gleefully carved up those frightened, stampeding creatures.Back in the twentieth century, they had established to everybodys satisfaction that I was just following orders was an inadequate excuse for inhuman conduct  but what can you do when the orders come from deep down in that puppet master of the unconscious?Worst of all was the feeling that perhaps my actions werent all that inhuman.Ancestors only a few generations back would have done the same thing, even to their fellow men, without any hypnotic conditioning.I was disgusted with the human race, disgusted with the army and horrified at the prospect of living with myself for another century or so  Well, there was always brainwipe.A ship with alone Tauran survivor had escaped and had gotten away clean, the bulk of the planet shielding it from Earths Hope while it dropped into Alephs collapsar field.Escaped home, I guessed, wherever that was, to report what twenty men with handweapons could do to a hundred fleeing on foot, unarmed.I suspected that the next time humans met Taurans in ground combat, we would be more evenly matched.And I was right.SERGEANT MANDELLA  20072024 A. D.1  I was scared enough.Sub major Stott was pacing back and forth behind the small podium in the assembly room/chop hall/gymnasium of the Anniversary.We had just made our final collapsar jump, from Tet 38 to Yod 4.We were decelerating at 1 gravities and our velocity relative to that collapsar was a respectable .90c.We were being chased.I wish you people would relax for a while and just trust the ships computer.The Tauran vessel at any rate will not be within strike range for another two weeks.Mandella!He was always very careful to call me Sergeant Mandella in front of the company.But everybody at this particular briefing was either a sergeant or a corporal: squad leaders.Yes, sir.Youre responsible for the psychological as well as the physical wellbeing of the men and women in your squad.Assuming that you are aware that there is a morale problem aboard this vessel, what have you done about it?As far as my squad is concerned, sir?Of course.We talk it out, sir.And have you arrived at any cogent conclusion?Meaning no disrespect, sir, I think the major problem is obvious.My people have been cooped up in this ship for fourteen  Ridiculous!Every one of us has been adequately conditioned against the pressures of living in close quarters and the enlisted people have the privilege of confraternity.That was a delicate way of putting it.Officers must remain celibate, and yet we have no morale problem.If he thought his officers were celibate, he should sit down and have a long talk with Lieutenant Harmony.Maybe he just meant line officers, though.That would be just him and Cortez.Probably 50 percent right.Cortez was awfully friendly with Corporal Karnehameha.Sir, perhaps it was the detoxification back at Stargate; maybe  No.The therapists only worked to erase the hate conditioning  everybody knows how I feel about that  and they may be misguided but they are skilled.Corporal Potter.He always called her by her rank to remind her why she hadnt been promoted as high as the rest of us.Too soft.Have youtalked it out with your people, too?Weve discussed it, sir.The sub major could glare mildly at people.He glared mildly at Marygay until she elaborated.I dont believe its the fault of the conditioning.My people are impatient, just tired of doing the same thing day after day.Theyre anxious for combat, then?No sarcasm in his voice.They want to get off the ship, sir.They will get off the ship, he said, allowing himself a microscopic smile.And then theyll probably be just as impatient to get back on.It went back and forth like that for a long while.Nobody wanted to come right out and say that their squad was scared: scared of the Tauran cruiser closing on us, scared of the landing on the portal planet.Sub major Stott had a bad record of dealing with people who admitted fear.I fingered the fresh T/O they had given us.It looked like this:      I knew most of the people from the raid on Aleph, the first face to face contact between humans and Taurans.The only new people in my platoon were Luthuli and Heyrovsky.In the company as a whole (excuse me, the strike force), we had twenty replacements for the nineteen people we lost from the Aleph raid: one amputation, four deaders, fourteen psychotics.I couldnt get over the 20 Mar 2007 at the bottom of the T/O.Id been in the army ten years, though it felt like less than two.Time dilation, of course; even with the collapsar jumps, traveling from star to star eats up the calendar.After this raid, I would probably be eligible for retirement, with full pay.If I lived through the raid, and if they didnt change the rules on us.Me a twenty year man, and only twenty five years old.Stott was summing up when there was a knock on the door, a single loud rap.Enter, he said.An ensign I knew vaguely walked in casually and handed Stott a slip of paper, without saying a word.He stood there while Stott read it, slumping with just the right degree of insolence.Technically, Stott was out of his chain of command; everybody in the navy disliked him anyhow.Stott handed the paper back to the ensign and looked through him.You will alert your squads that preliminary evasive maneuvers will commence at 2010, fifty eight minutes from now.He hadnt looked at his watch.All personnel will be in acceleration shells by 2000.Tench hut!We rose and, without enthusiasm, chorused, Fuck you, sir.Idiotic custom.Stott strode out of the room and the ensign followed, smirking.I turned my ring to my assistant squad leaders position and talked into it: Tate, this is Mandella.Everyone else in the room was doing the same.A tinny voice came out of the ring: Tate here.Whats up?Get a hold of the men and tell them we have to be in the shells by 2000.Evasive maneuvers.Crap.They told us it would be days.I guess something new came up.Or maybe the Commodore has a bright idea.The Commodore can stuff it.You up in the lounge?Yeah.Bring me back a cup when you come, okay?Little sugar?Roger.Be down in about half an hour.Thanks.Ill get on it.There was a general movement toward the coffee machine.I got in line behind Corporal Potter.What do you think, Marygay?Maybe the Commodore just wants us to try out the shells once more.Before the real thing.Maybe.She picked up a cup and blew into it.She looked worried.Or maybe the Taurans had a ship way out, waiting for us.Ive wondered why they dont do it.We do, at Stargate.Stargates a different thing.It takes seven cruisers, moving all the time, to cover all the possible exit angles.We cant afford to do it for more than one collapsar, and neither could they.She didnt say anything while she filled her cup.Maybe weve stumbled on their version of Stargate.Or maybe they have more ships than we do by now.I filled and sugared two cups, sealed one.No way to tell.We walked back to a table, careful with the cups in the high gravity.Maybe Singhe knows something, she said.Maybe he does.But Id have to get him through Rogers and Cortez.Cortez would jump down my throat if I tried to bother him now.Oh, I can get him directly.We She dimpled a little bit.Weve been friends.I sipped some scalding coffee and tried to sound nonchalant.So thats where youve been disappearing to.You disapprove?she said, looking innocent.Well  damn it, no, of course not.But  but hes an officer!A navy officer!Hes attached to us and that makes him part army.She twisted her ring and said, Directory.To me: What about you and Little Miss Harmony?Thats not the same thing.She was whispering a directory code into the ring.Yes, it is.You just wanted to do it with an officer.Pervert.The ring bleated twice.Busy.How was she?Adequate.I was recovering.Besides, Ensign Singhe is a perfect gentleman.And not the least bit jealous.Neither am I, I said.If he ever hurts you, tell me and Ill break his ass.She looked at me across her cup.If Lieutenant Harmony ever hurts you, tell me and Ill break her ass.Its a deal.We shook on it solemnly.2  The acceleration shells were something new, installed while we rested and resupplied at Stargate.They enabled us to use the ship at closer to its theoretical efficiency, the tachyon drive boosting it to as much as 25 gravities.Tate was waiting for me in the shell area.The rest of the squad was milling around, talking.I gave him his coffee.Thanks.Find out anything?Afraid not.Except the swabbies dont seem to be scared, and its their show.Probably just another practice run.He slurped some coffee.What the hell.Its all the same to us, anyhow.Just sit there and get squeezed half to death.God, I hate those things.Maybe theyll eventually make us obsolete, and we can go home.Sure thing.The medic came by and gave me my shot.I waited until 1950 and hollered to the squad, Lets go.Strip down and zip up.The shell is like a flexible spacesuit; at least the fittings on the inside are pretty similar.But instead of a life support package, theres a hose going into the top of the helmet and two coming out of the heels, as well as two relief tubes per suit.Theyre crammed in shoulder to shoulder on light acceleration couches, getting to your shell is like picking your way through a giant plate of olive drab spaghetti.When the lights in my helmet showed that everybody was suited up, I pushed the button that flooded the room.No way to see, of course, but I could imagine the pale blue solution  ethylene glycol and something else  foaming up around and over us.The suit material, cool and dry, collapsed in to touch my skin at every point.I knew that my internal body pressure was increasing rapidly to match the increasing fluid pressure outside.Thats what the shot was for; keep your cells from getting squished between the devil and the deep blue sea.You could still feel it, though.By the time my meter said 2 (external pressure equivalent to a column of water two nautical miles deep), I felt that I was at the same time being crushed and bloated.By 2005 it was at 2.7 and holding steady.When the maneuvers began at 2010, you couldnt feel the difference.I thought I saw, the needle fluctuate a tiny bit, though.The major drawback to the system is that, of course, anybody caught outside of his shell when the Anniversary hit 25 Gs would be just so much strawberry jam.So the guiding and the fighting have to be done by the ships tactical computer  which does most of it anyway, but its nice to have a human overseer.Another small problem is that if the ship gets damaged and the pressure drops, youll explode like a dropped melon.If its the internal pressure, you get crushed to death in a microsecond.And it takes ten minutes, more or less, to get depressurized and another two or three to get untangled and dressed.So its not exactly something you can hop out of and come up fighting.The accelerating was over at 2038.A green light went on and I chinned the button to depressurize.Marygay and I were getting dressed outside.Howd that happen?I pointed to an angry purple welt that ran from the bottom of her right breast to her hipbone.Thats the second time, she said, mad.
