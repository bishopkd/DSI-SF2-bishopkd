That wayis this what love was, this desire for a feeling that remained unclear even when felt?Is that why people sometimes thought of it as a madness?The words stay the same, even the feelings stay the same, but there are slippages between the words and the feelings, hard to track.The desire to know, to be known, to be cherished for what you are and not what others think you should be But then, what you are It was hard for her not to feel that a person loving her was making a big mistake.Because she knew herself better than they did, so knew their love was given in error.And thus they must be some kind of fool.And yet it was precisely that misplaced love she wanted.Someone who would like you more than you do.Someone who likes you despite yourself, someone more generous to you than you are.That was how Alex had been.And when you see that, when you feel thatfeel loved beyond justice, from some kind of generositythat sets off certain other feelings.A kind of a glow.A spillover.It caused something to start that felt reciprocal.A mutual recognition.The hall of mirrors again.Set a lased beam of light between two mirrors, back and forth the beam bounces, two parts of something more; not just the beast with two backs (though that too, for sure, and a great thing, a great animal) but something else, some kind of pairing, like Pluto and Charon, with the center of gravity between the two.Not a single supra organism, but two working together on something not themselves.A duet.A harmony.She whistled one of the other Beethoven tunes Wahram had often whistled in the tunnel; she still had trouble sorting which was which, but knew this was the other song of thanks, the one after the big storm, when all the creatures come back out into the sun.A simple melody, like a folk tune.She chose it because it was one of the few tunes Wahram could whistle a descant to, forging an elaboration he said was in the original.He fired it up and joined in.He wasnt as strong as he had been before, though he hadnt been strong then.His whistle had pain threading it like a golden wire.He was not much of a musician, in all truth.But he had a good memory for the pieces he loved; and he loved them.She took off and trilled all around him, and he fell back into the main melody in relief.Maybe that was what duets were all about.Maybe I love you, she said.Maybe thats what Ive been feeling these past few years.Maybe I just never knew what it was.Maybe, he said.Did he mean that maybes dont count, or that maybes are better than nothing?Slow movement of the Seventh, he said, if you dont mind.And he was off into another tune from their time under Mercury, one she had always enjoyed riffing on, it had so many possibilities.Sometimes they had gone on with it for hours, for half a day or more.Stately, solemn, elegiac; something like Wahram himself, pacing through the days.On the march.Someone you could rely on.Maybe, she repeated.It may be.They fell into the song as of old, as when they were in the crucible and everything depended on how they went forward.As now, even now, just floating in space waiting for rescue, having faith it would come.Faith justified; for Pauline said, Ship approaching.One white dot among the rest bloomed, and in a matter of seconds became another little space yacht, a hopper hovering there before them like a dream, bizarre and magical.Oh good, Swan said.Now they too were Peters.She had to remember that.They were only continuing by way of a rescue.As they puffed over to the little ship, Swan tried to fix what this had felt likethe floating, Andromeda, Wahrams gaze, their duet.It could have been their last hours.She thought of Alex again.Our stories go on a while, some genes and words persist; then we go away.It was a hard thing to remember.And as the lock door closed and they were back inside, she once again forgot it.KIRAN ON ICE  It was while Kiran was still being stared at by the eyes in the box that it occurred to him that he should not be seeing something like this, and one quick glance at the tall security guard made it clear that this thought had also occurred to the guard.As the guard started relocking the box Kiran considered what this meant, and before the guard had finished tapping the keypad Kiran was off and dashing back the way they had come.He turned into the first street available and sprinted hard to the next intersection and turned again, with a single glance back; the guard was not yet in view.Off he went at a slightly slower pace, thinking about his options.The train that ran between Vinmara and Cleopatra would certainly be watched, and there was only the one.Much of the population of the town was still out celebrating the uneclipse and the end of the rain.And he knew where the gate was relative to his current position.He cut right yet again and so toward it.The streets of the seashell town were almost empty.Ahead the gate; none of his new work unit was visible, nor any security guards aside from the ordinary gatekeepers.He gave his original ID card to one of these as he came to the gate lock door, then went in the lock and checked to make sure his suit was secure.Out onto the snowy hillsides of Venus.People were trooping back down from the hilltop overlooking the bay, and he looked away as he passed them and headed around to the west of town.When he had gotten past the edge of town he slipped over the hill and out of view of Vinmara, then took a broad wash south, toward the distant ocean.They were still covering the frozen CO2 down there, so he hoped he could catch a ride from one of the super zambonis or foamed rock applicators.He wanted to get to Colette, but feared that the whole transportation system would be alerted to look for him.Now it was really hitting home what it meant to be a double agent or a mole or whatever it was he had turned into; it meant neither side would care about you, or care to defend you if problems arose.On the other hand, if he could get to Shukra, he had information Shukra had asked him to obtain.So getting to Colette was the obvious thing to try.Vinmara was located just south of Onatah Corona.Onatah was the Iroquois corn goddess, his faceplate map told him; no doubt a much friendlier goddess than Lakshmi, who after all was Kalis boss.Everything Kiran had heard about Lakshmi made him pretty sure that he might not survive her displeasure.At the thought he yelped and took the translation spectacles she had given him from his suits chest pocket.Reluctantly, with a final kiss in thanks for all they had done to improve his love life, he tossed them away.Really a shame he had not thought to do so back in the city, but there was no way he was going to return there now.Since he had been able to see the big rock foamers on the skyline from Vinmara, he had assumed that they could not be too far away.Now, as he walked over the crunchy and sometimes slippery snow downhill toward the dry ice sea, he realized that the new towns hillside perch might give it a view much farther away than he had reckoned.In fact it could be many kilometers.This thought was beginning to oppress him when he came over a small ridge in the ice and saw a super zamboni, not immediately near but just a couple of kilometers away, and lumbering along slowly in the usual manner.He broke into a trot and tried to pace himself for the run there.It was moving crossways to his approach, so he was going to be all right; no need to kill himself.Nevertheless he was huffing and puffing by the time he reached the thing.Unfortunately if there was a person or persons inside it, they were not looking out the cabin windows, which were up at the top and front of the thing.There was nothing for Kiran to do except jog next to it and jump up onto its side where a ladder came almost to the ground.Climb the ladder, get on the roof of the thing, which was not only railed, but full of instrumentation to hold on to.Alas it was a bit of exposure to hang over the front and try to reach down to where the windows started, and there was nothing much to hold on to.Seemed as if the windows were in fact still out of reach, which was frustrating.There was a hatch door, however, in the roof, and when he saw it he began to pound on it with his fists, then kick it with the heels of his boots.He was looking around to see if there was anything he could break off to hit the door with even harder when the behemoth shuddered to a halt, and soon after, he could hear voices below him, and the hatch door opened.Thanks!he shouted.I got lost out here!So two Venusians brought him inside, and he had a very difficult time making up a story for them that would explain his presence down there on the frozen oceanit had to involve an admission of recreational drug use and even worse, geographical disorientation, so he squirmed his way through it, feeling lucky that embarrassment was the appropriate emotion for his cover story and its lame particulars.Happily the two minders listened to their translator saying it all in Chinese, and merely nodded as if they had often witnessed such foolishness before, and went back to their screen game.They were headed for a working camp under Bahet Patera, they told him, and would be there in four hours.There was beer in the fridge if he was interested.The working camp they came to was one of a whole series of them, Kiran saw on the map, running west along the northern shore of the new ocean and sheltering the people who were getting the last of the CO2 sealed over.Kiran gave his original ID card to the people at the camp, but they only looked at it briefly and waved him over to the galley.He ate voraciously while he pored over the map on his tabletop screen.He had already seen that there were fast little snowmobiles out in the camps parking lot, and the map seemed to indicate that the camps dotting the shore were close enough together that a snowmobile could get from one to the next on one fuel load.Maybe that was even part of the plan.Very nice.And as they kept regular hours despite the perpetual night, he merely waited until everyone had gone to bed, and then went out to one of the snowmobiles, checked that it was full of fuel, fired it up, and took off west.These snowmobiles were neat little things, more like cars on skis than any of the monsters being used for the sequestration work.He had often enjoyed driving them in his first months on Venus, and now he sat back and gave the AI instructions and watched the eerie dim landscape slide by.The snow here had packed down to what they called firn, and his vehicle zipped right along.It would be an all night drive, so to speak, but then he could come into the next camp when they were getting up.Maybe just drive into the parking lot and jump into another snowmobile and keep going, why not?No one cared about these vehicles on the ice; they were no ones property.And there was nowhere to go in them.Or so he told himself as he fell asleep, and when he woke up and had the AI slide them into the parking lot of the next camp, it worked just as he had hoped.Out of that one, into another, off again; no one the slightest bit concerned.I love Venus, he told the AI pilot.His old translation belt said it in Chinese, although probably the vehicles AI understood English too.The old belt was a sad step down from the spectacles, but in this situation it didnt really matter.Two more camps, two more snowmobiles, and he came to a camp he had spotted on the maps, one that had a train line spur that would take him up through the Ut Rupes and the Vesta Rupes and eventually to Colette.As he came into the camp he saw a train, at what passed here for a station, which was just a loading dock and a small building.As he slid up on the snowmobile he saw that they were loading some of the cars from a siding, under big lights.Being in the light of the lamps, they could see little outside that cone of illumination, so he crept up on them, staying in the dark, and in the moment when they were finishing their work he threw a rock at the building by the tracks, and when they went to investigate the bang, he hopped up into the car and ducked down behind the boxes inside.Not long after that he was closed into the car, and felt the train jerk forward with maglev smoothness and head up the long slope to Colette, far above him on the Lakshmi Planum, so ominously named.He had fallen sleep, and woken up starving, when the car doors finally opened up.He waited for a clear moment, jumped out of the car and hustled away from it.No one around.He wasnt certain, but after he slipped out of the station he confirmed it: he was inside the dome of Colette.It was the third day since he had left Vinmara, and he felt a little spacy from hunger, but pleased as well.Now to find Shukra.He could return to his lodge, but that was where Lakshmis agent had always met him.In the end he strolled through the big city streets, trying to look innocent, and went to the offices where he had first been taken by Swan to meet Shukra so long before.Since that first meeting Shukra had always come to him, so Kiran didnt know where else to go.He had had a lot of time to think about this, but he still wasnt quite sure of the best approach to take.There was the distinct possibility that he was throwing himself from the frying pan into the fire, but because Shukra had contacted him, and had told him what to look for, it seemed like it could be more like getting out of the fire back into the frying pan, or hopefully off the stove entirely.Anyway he didnt see how he could avoid the risk of asking someone for help, and Shukra was his best bet.So he walked in the outer door of that first office, and went up to the security desk and said to the trio there, Im here to see Shukra, please.Please tell him that I have what he asked me for, and I want to give it to him.SWAN AND KIRAN  Taken in by what turned out to be an Interplan ship; cleaned up and fed; slept for twelve hours straight; up and eating again; and after that they were in Venus orbit, and then in a landing craft.The craft fell like a brick to the still shaded planet, then eased off at the end to thump onto a runway.When they emerged in the big atrium of the spaceport, Swan could see that they had landed outside Colette.There was a view to a rumple of snowy muscular hills to the north, all dim under swirls of dark cloud.Venus!What had happened in raw space still bulked large in her mind, so that what stood before her eyes now was like a dream.She was separated from Wahram as they went through their medical checkups and then a long security postmortem.The people talking to her were upset; it was obviously necessary to attend to the moment, transparent though it was.Later she could mull over what had happened and what she felt about it.She did not want it to slip away like everything else.Their hosts brought her a little feast in dim sum style, with tiny plates and morsels of food, no more than a mouthful each, or just a taste, each with a different sauce, until her palate was completely confused, and she felt stuffed after four bites.Her stomach rebelled; it grumbled and queased throughout the conversation that began at the end of the meal.Many there were drinking liquor and opioid mixers.Swan sipped soda water, watching people carefully.The Venusians there were looking very subdued.A leavening of jokesters, clustered mostly at one table, laughed at the gurneys of food, but the rest looked chastened, even grim.The salvation of the sunshield was all very well, of course, a great victory to be sure.But their defensive systems had failed them, and the danger inherent in the sunshield had been emphasized for all the world to see.Disaster had been staved off this time, but it still hung over them like a sword: a terrible fate, perpetually forestalled by a thing no stronger than a venetian blind, or a circular kite on a string.One particularly grim part of the room was absorbed in the problem of what had happened to the sunshields security; these people were poking at their tabletops graphs and talking rapidly to each other.It appeared most of them thought the failure to respond had been caused by an inside job.Wahram rolled into the room in a wheelchair and joined them, his left leg held straight out and swathed in white.He nodded slowly as they spoke to him.Once he glanced over at Swan, as if he had just heard something she would find interesting; then he was deep in it again.Swan would hear about it later, she hoped.Although then it occurred to her that he might feel he had to tell them about her telling Pauline about the group Alex had assembled when she had promised she wouldnt.How else was the story of what had happened going to parse?Well, in the end her rash act had saved Venus.Not that that meant she wouldnt suffer for it anyway.Be known as a completely untrustworthy reckless flibbertigibbet qubehead.It wouldnt be that hard of a case to make.She sat watching the Venusians.They stayed slumped in their chairs, depressed.She asked some questions and they answered, except sometimes they didnt.She came back to something they didnt seem to want to address: I suppose you have to stick with the sunshield, now that its there?One waved a hand impatiently.Some say no, that we should change.What do you mean?Wouldnt that take spinning the planet up to some kind of day night?Yes.But how?The only way there is, one said.A heavy meteor shower at a tangent.The very late heavy bombardment, someone called from the jokesters table.But wouldnt that wreck the surface you have?Swan said.Blast away the foamed rock, the CO2, the atmosphereeverything youve done?Not everything, the first one said.Wed just keep hitting the same spot.Things would just be disarranged.Disarranged!Look, we dont like this idea.Weve fought this idea of spinning it up.We all have.Gesturing around the room at the others there.But Lakshmi and her crowd have been arguing it could work without too much disruption.Just one more short deep ocean trench, and ejecta to the east of it.Other areas would suffer too, especially around the equator, but not so much that we would kill the bacteria we have out there now.And it wouldnt release more than a couple percent of the buried CO2.But wouldnt it take a few hundred years of heavy bombardment to get the spin you wanted?The idea would be to spin it to about a hundred hour day.We think most Terran life forms can tolerate that.So it would only take a hundred years.Only a hundred!A new voice: What these people are arguing is that we did it too fast the first time.This particular speaker, an old person, eyes alive in a weathered face like a mask, sounded a little regretful, a little disgusted.Did it too much like Mars!Took the way of the sunshield because it was fast!But once you have it, you have to keep it.You depend on it.And now people can see what could happen to it.So Lakshmi will win.The vote will go for bombardment now.In the Working Group, you mean?Yes.Well have to stay in shelters, or even retreat into sky cities, or even go back home for a while.Wait until things calm down again.Wahram, who had rolled over and joined them, said, But what will you bombard it with this time?You wont be taking any moons and cutting them up.No, the old one said.That was part of the going too fast.But there are many Neptunian Trojans to be sent down.Arent the Tritons developing those?There are thousands of them.And they are all Kuiper belt captures.We could replace from the Kuiper belt, if the Tritons want.So nothing need be lost as far as Neptune is concerned.The Tritons already agree to the principle.Well, Swan said, baffled.She didnt know what to say.She regarded their faces, so grim and irritated.Is it what the people here want?Can you tell?They looked at each other.The first said, Theres a network of cadre layers, like the panchayats in India.And everyone is talking.Theres only forty million of us here.Sothe Working Group will hear from us and from everyone.But in fact the idea was already gaining traction.Now with this thing, people see the need.Lakshmi has won.Later, when Swan was alone back in her room at the hospital, there was a tap at the door, and in came Shukra with Swans young friend from Earth, Kiran.She greeted them happily, immediately cheered by the sight of their faces, so vivid and real.Shukra, whom she had worked with a million years ago; Kiran, her newest friendnow they had the same look on their faces, serious and intent.They sat down by her bed and Swan poured them glasses of water.Listen to the youth here, Shukra said, tipping his head at Kiran.What?Swan said, alert to trouble.Kiran put a hand up as if to reassure her.You told me when you brought me here that there were factions.Thats turned out to be true, and its even kind of a little underground civil war, you could almost call it.Lakshmi, Shukra said heavily, as if this would explain everything.He got involved with her.Is that bad?Swan asked.I meanIm the one who told him to try her.Shukra rolled his eyes at this.Swan, you were here a hundred years ago.You should know that things have changed since then.Tell her, he said to Kiran.I started moving stuff and carrying messages for Lakshmi, Kiran said, and Shukra saw that was happening, and got me to look closer into what I was seeing when I did things for her.He was bait, Shukra said with a hard smile, and she took it.But probably she knew he was bait.Kiran nodded, with a look at Swan that seemed to say Look what you got me into here.He said, Theres a new coastal town that Lakshmis team is developing, its definitely her place, and its set too low for some reason.People thought she might want it drowned later on for an insurance scam or something like that.Anyway, theyre doing something funny in that town.I think maybe theyre making androids or something.Robots made to look like humans, you know?I do know, Swan said.Tell me more.Theres an office there that was closed off, a pretty big building.I saw a box of eyeballs get delivered there.I think they might be putting together artificial people.Some kind of Frankenstein factory.You saw that?The guard I was with opened a box, and it was eyeballs.He didnt like it that I saw, so I had to get to teacher Shukra here, and ask for help.Shukra nodded as if to say this had been a smart move.Swan said to him, So this place he was at is Lakshmis?Yes, Shukra said.Her work units built the whole town.So lookI dont know anything about this Vinmara operation, but shes got people coming into Cleopatra that we cant ID.I set up an office in Cleopatra myself, its supposedly an open city, although really she calls the shots there.I was trying to figure out where these new people were coming from.But nowwhen I heard about the attack on the sunshield, the first thing I thought was, Well, isnt that convenient for friend Lakshmi.People will be scared into supporting the plan to spin up the planet, and if we do that, the new hole theyll rip in the equator will shrink the reach of the ocean accordingly.These places like Vinmara, that are set too low?They wont be set too low.Ahh, Swan said.Wow.Butwhat about the Chinese?The Chinese hate this second bombardment idea, and so if it happens anyway, despite their opposition, they lose leverageagain, all the better for Lakshmi.And in truth none of us want Beijing telling us what to do.So this also helps her in the argument.And so these humanoids shes having built?Swan leaned forward and clicked on the table screen.Hereshow me where this Vinmara is on a map.Lets get Inspector Genette in here, and Wahram too.Theyll be very interested to hear what you have to say.Inspector Genette arrived in her room, then Wahram, wheeling himself along in his wheelchair, his left leg swathed in its medwrap.They listened to Kirans story and then sat pondering the implications.Inspector Genette said, I think we need to decide some things before we act on this.After whats happened, Im quite sure that I need to execute the plan we have been devising, which I have not yet described to you, Swan.So if you will agree to turn off Pauline again, I can tell it to you.Swan wasnt sure she wanted to go through that again, and the inspector must have known by now that she had told Pauline what had been said at the last off the record meeting, so she didnt see the point.But in any case she was forestalled, because Wahram now said to Genette, Im afraid we should perhaps go through with the plan without Swan knowing about it at all.She may turn off Pauline for the conversation, but she may then tell her qube what happened after she turns it back on, as she did the last time we did this.Swan gave Wahram a dagger of a look and said to Genette, It was Pauline who informed us of the attack in time to do something about it.And it was Wangs qube who set up the new surveillance system able to detect that pebble mob.So you can thank me for that later.But my point is, whatever these Venusians are up to with their qube people and their plots, there are other qubes who are clearly on our side.We need to be working with them!Inspector Genette agreed.Ive had a long talk with Wang and his qube, and what you say is true.There are factions among the qubes too, Im afraid.So we need ours informed!Maybe, Genette said.Although which are ours is an open question.And in this case, the fewer that know, the better.So look, with this information from Kiran, I am going to proceed with this particular Interplan operation as planned.And that is?Swan said pointedly.The inspectors little face, as beautiful and curious as a langurs, regarded Swan with a bright smile.Please let me tell you about it after we are farther along.Swan gave Wahram another black look.You see what youve done.Wahram shrugged.The plan needs complete secrecy to work.Even I am ignorant of the details.I should also add, Genette added quickly, that my plan also needed this information from your young friend here.So it is just now coming together.Please allow me to make the next move confidentially.Even Wahram, as he says, and really everyone here on Venusbowing toward Shukrais ignorant of our next step, and it has to be that way to succeed.Whether Genette was just helping Wahram to look better in Swans eyes, Swan couldnt tell; she was too furious to keep a good sense of the nuances of the situation.Her judgment was off.Genette was now talking to a colleague who had come into the room, finally turning to the rest of them and saying, If you will excuse us.I will not, Swan said, and stormed out.Wahram caught up with her down the hall and matched her step for step, rolling along in his wheelchair and capable therefore of keeping up with her no matter how fast she walked.Swan, dont be angry at me, I needed to tell the inspector what happened to stay in good faith on an important matter; this operation is delicate and the whole situation had to be told.So now it is.Yes, and soon youll know everything too.But for a while you have to trust us.Us?Im going to help the inspector.It shouldnt take too long.During that time I hope you will go back to Terminator and talk with your people there, about the situation on Titan and about us.You think Im still interested in any of that?I certainly hope so.Its more important than your bruised feelings here, if you will allow me to say so.Especially as they neednt be bruised.I think considering you and Pauline as an indivisible pair is a good thing, dont you?Its accurate, it describes you better, let us say.You are a new thing.And most especially to me, I might add.He reached out and clutched her hand, then stopped them both by braking his wheelchair with his other hand.They slewed around, and he held on to her hand even though she tugged on it.Come on, he said, be serious.Were you out there marooned with me or not?Were you in the tunnel or not?Turning her question around on her; and of course she remembered.Yes, yes, Swan groused, looking down.Well then, here we are now, and there is a situation that requires confidentiality, and so in that context you have to see what I just said to Genette as being under the light of utmost necessity.Especially given my own feelings for you, which arehe paused to pound his chest with his wheel handprofound.Confused but profound.And thats what matters.It makes life interesting.So I have been thinking that we ought to get married, in the Saturnian crche I am already part of.It would solve so many problems more than it would create that I really think it is the best thing for both of us.For me, certainly.So I am hoping you will marry me, and thats the long and short of it.Swan yanked her hand away, raised it as if to hit him.I dont understand you!I know.I have trouble with that myself.But thats not the main thing.Its only part of it.We would make that part of our project.I dont know.Swan began, then trailed off: there was so much that could follow this opening that she found herself at a loss.She didnt know anything!Im going to Earth, anyway, she said mulishly.I have a meeting there with the UN mammals committee; were making some progress there.And now I want to talk to Zasha too.Thats all right, Wahram assured her.You think about it.I have to go join Genette; we really are engaged in something urgent, and this information from Kiran is the linchpin, so let us complete that, and Ill come see you wherever you are, as soon as I can.And after an anguished clasp of hands to heart, he swiveled and wheeled back down the hall to the inspector.WAHRAM AND GENETTE  Wahram returned to Genette, who was leaving for Vinmara and did not want to waste time, saying only, Come on, and then hurrying off as fast as a terrier.As Wahram wheeled along in pursuit, Genette looked back up at him and asked if all was well with Swan.Wahram replied that it was, although he was none too sure about this.But it was time to focus on the plan.As they flew to Vinmara, Genette talked to some of his associates using his wristqube Passepartout as his radio, and Wahram gestured at it questioningly.With a shake of the head Genette said, There are qubes working for us, as Swan pointed out, and indeed hers may be one of them, it seems likely.But I havent been able to check it yet, and you were probably right to keep her out of this.Its hard to tell what she would do.But meanwhile Wangs qube and Passepartout have both been checked out, and are helping us as instructed.So I believe, he enunciated at his wristqube with a cross eyed frown.Wahram said, Do you think the qubes are beginning to function as their own society, with groups or even organizations, and disagreements?Genette threw up his hands.How can we tell?It may be they are only being given different instructions by different people and therefore acting differently.So we hope to apprehend the maker of these qube humans in Vinmara, and then maybe we can find out more.What about the Venusians?Will they allow you to do what you intend to here?Shukra and his group are backing us.They are in the midst of quite a tussle right now, and the stakes are high.Lakshmis people are either manufacturing these humanoids or else are benefitting from their existence, I cant tell which yet, but either way Shukras group is happy to assist us.I think the Working Group is divided enough that we can do what we need to and get off planet before they can react.This sounded ominous to Wahram.Jump through the middle of a civil war?Genette said with a quick shrug, No way now but forward.They came to the spaceport and hurried through it and down a jetway into a small airplane.After they were on board and in the air, Genette looked out the window and observed, Its a lot like China here.In fact they may still be ruled from China, its hard to be sure.Anyway, decisions are in the hands of a fairly small group.And theyre split now over what to do about the sunshield.How you regard it has become a kind of loyalty test for both sides.I thought most Venusians had come to accept reliance on it as just one danger among many.But the ones who object to it tend to be more vehement in their feelings.For them its a kind of existential issue.And so they are willing to be more extreme to get their way.So what do you think they did?I think what may have happened is that one of their programmers decided to instruct some qubes to help the effort to get rid of the sunshield.Maybe an open command, something like figure out a way to get this done.So that means some qube running a probable outcomes algorithm.And the algorithm could have been poorly constrained.Willing to consider anything, so to speak.Kind of like a person in that regard!Very lifelike.So, what if that qube then proposed to put qubes in humanoid bodies, so they could make attacks that immobile box qubes couldnt manage on their ownattacks that humans couldnt or wouldnt do?Sabotage, I mean.Or call them educational spectacles, meaning some arranged disasters.If they could make the majority of Venusians believe that the sunshield was in danger of an attackthat they could all be cooked like bugsthen public sentiment would surely back another era of bombardment to give Venus a spin.Scaring a civilian populace into making a certain political choice, Wahram said.Yes.Which we recognize is one definition of terrorism.But this might not be so apparent to a qube programmed to look for results.And so the attack on Terminator was a kind of demonstration?Exactly.And it certainly had that effect here on Venus.But this new attack on the sunshield, it could have been much more than a scare, Wahram said.If it had succeeded, it would have killed a lot of people.Even that might not register as a negative.Depends on the algorithm, and that means it depends on the programmer.There are lots of people on Earth available to replace anyone killed up here.China alone could easily restock the place.The whole Venusian population could be killed and replaced by Chinese and China not even notice.So who knows what people might be thinking?These programmers may have set their qubes off in new directions, even given them new algorithms, but whatever they did they wont have made human thinkers of them, even if they did get them to the point of passing a Turing test or whatnot.So these qubanoids definitely exist.Oh yes.Your Swan has met some, as have I.  The thing on Io was one.And Ive been interested to learn that a great many of them are on Mars, passing for human and involved in government.Marss problems with the Mondragon and with Saturnthey look a little suspicious to me now.Ah, said Wahram, thinking it over.And so you are doing what?We are apprehending all of them at once, Genette said, checking Passepartout quickly.I sent out the code to do it, and nows the time.Midnight Greenwich mean time, October 11, 2312.We have to pounce.They landed outside Vinmara and after that Wahram was thankful that he was in a wheelchair, because Genette terriered from one brief meeting to another at a terrific clip; even wheeling along Wahram could barely keep up.Kiran came in a few minutes later on another flight and met with them to show them which building the eyeballs had been heading for.Soon after that an armed group arrived and wasted no time surrounding this building.After a short delay they blasted down the front door and rushed in with weapons drawn, in full spacesuits.A thick pall of gray gas poured out of the interior from the very moment they broke down the door.In less than five minutes the building was secured.Immediately Genette was conferring with the assault team, and then with Shukra, who showed up with another contingent of armed supporters, there to make sure there would be no local resistance to a rapid extraction of the facilitys contents.Genette conversed continuously with people, in person and over mobiles, unflustered but very intentused to this kind of thing.Used even to the idea of plunging into a fight between Venusian factions, which Wahram thought must be extremely dangerous.When Genette seemed to be done for the moment, and was sitting on the edge of a table, drinking coffee and looking at his wristqube, Wahram said curiously, So these pebble attacksthey were a matter of one Venusian faction wanting to influence the population here?To get its way in a fight with another faction?Thats right.But if the attack on the sunshield had succeeded, wouldnt the terrorists have killed themselves too?Genette said, I think there would have been time for an evacuation.And the perpetrators could be off planet by now.Also, if qubes made the decision, they might not have cared either way.Whoever the original programmers were, at that point they might not have been in control of the decisions being made.The qubes themselves might have been thinking, Well, its a loss, but theres more of us where we came from.So they would get what they wanted whether the attack worked or failed.Wahram thought it over.What about that killed terrarium out in the asteroid belt?The Yggdrasil?I dont know about that.Maybe it was meant to make people feel vulnerable.Maybe they were just testing their method.But its odd, I agree.Its one of the reasons I want to see these qubanoids, and any people theyve picked up here.A group of people emerged from the front door of the complex, and Genette made a beeline to them.Many were smalls; the attack on the building had apparently had a Trojan horse component to it, with a bunch of smalls cutting in through air ducts and firing gas canisters to start the attack.All right, come on, Genette said when he returned to Wahrams side, lets get out of here.We have to get these things off planet as fast as we can.A line of about two dozen people, mostly standard size, but including a small and a tall, filed out the door, chained together by their security vests.Genette stopped them one by one as they passed, asking questions very politely, only detaining them for a few seconds each.Wahram inspected them also as they passed, and he noted their possibly too smooth motion, and an intent glassy eyed blankness to some of them; but he would not have put bets on his own ability to tell which ones were human and which manufactured.It was disconcerting, that was for sure.A little drop of dread seemed to have slid down his throat to his stomach, where it was spreading.Genette stopped the last person in line: Aha!Whos this?Wahram asked.This is Swans lawn bowler, I believe.Genette held up Passepartout and photographed the person, then nodded at the matched photos on the wristqubes little screen.And, as it turns outrunning a wand over the young persons heada human being after all.The youth stared at them mutely.Genette said, Maybe this is our programmer, eh?We can investigate on our way out.I want to get off Venus as fast as we can.This meant another quick crossing of the city, and a tense passage through lock gates to their impromptu helicopter pad.More than once, officials who should have had reason to question such a large group instead let them pass, sometimes while chattering nervously on their headsets through the whole process.When they were airborne again, Genette glanced at Wahram with a mimes round eyed wiping of the brow.Their helicopter headed for Colette, and at the spaceport there, they rushed onto a pad and got into a space plane, and rode it juddering up into lower orbit, there to be hauled in by an orbiting Interplan cruiser.It was the Swift Justice; and when everyone was aboard, they set a course for Pluto.In the weeks of their trip out, they brought the lawn bowler in for questioning more than once; but he never said a word.He was definitely human.A young man, thirty five years old.They were able to trace him back from Swans sighting in the Chateau Garden to one of the unaffiliateds, one that would not give its name to outsiders; Interplan had it listed, with accidental prescience, as U 238.During the flight to Pluto and Charon, Wangs qube was able to ferret out quite a bit more about the lawn bowlers brief life.It was a sad tale, though not uncommon: small terrarium run by a cult, in this case Ahura Mazd worshippers; strict gender division; patriarchal, polygamous; obsessed with physical punishments for demonic transgressions.Into that little world, an unstable child.Reports of aggression without remorse.Stuck there from the age of four until departure by defection at age twenty four.Learned programming on Vesta, known by no one; absorbed for a time in qube design at the Ceres Academy, but then left school; detached from the school culture.Eventually kicked off Ceres for transgressing its security codes one too many times; then a return to his home rock, where, as far as anyone knew, he had remained.But in fact no one had been watching.How he had come to the work on Venus was unclear, that sequence hidden in the fog that surrounded the Venus Working Groupin this case Lakshmi and her anti sunshield effort, a unit that had hidden all its actions very effectively.Thus Vinmara and the lab that made humanoids, including the ones that had gone to Mars and infiltrated the government.And the ones that had moved to Earth and then the asteroid belt, and built and operated the pebble launcher.So this young man had either invented the pebble mobs, or designed qubes that had invented them; and he or his creations had executed the attacks.Yggdrasil?Genette said to the bowler at one point.The diagnostic monitors attached to the youths body and brain showed a solid jump.Genette nodded.Just a test, eh?Proof of concept?Again the monitors showed the jump in the metabolism.The idea that these jumps constituted a reliable lie detector had long since been abandoned, but the physiological leaps were still very suggestive.Wordless as the youth remained, there was no way to be sure why any of these things had happened.But an association with Yggdrasil seemed clear.To Genette, this was what mattered.I think the attacks on Terminator and Venus were political, he said to Wahram, with the youth right in the room with them, staring mutely at the wall, the monitors jumpy lines speaking for him in a sort of mute shouting.I suspect they were approved by Lakshmi.But breaking open the Yggdrasil came first, and probably was this persons idea.A demonstration for Lakshmi, perhaps.Proof of concept.And so three thousand people died.Genette stared up at the youths tight face, then said finally to Wahram, Come on, lets get out of here.Theres nothing more to do here.In the three weeks it took to reach Pluto and Charon, Wahrams injured leg took a turn for the worse, and after a consulation among themselves, the ships medical team decided to amputate it just below the knee and begin the pluripotent stem cell work that would start the growth of a new left leg.Wahram endured this with as little attention as possible, quelling the dread in him and reminding himself that at 113 his whole body was a medical artifact, and that regrowing lost limbs was one of the simplest and oldest of body interventions.Nevertheless it was creepy to look at, and phantom itchy to feel, and he kept himself distracted by grilling Genette repeatedly about the plan the inspectors team was now executing.But no matter how much he distracted himself, he never got used to the sensation of the new leg growing down from his knee.Spacecraft from all over the solar system were converging to join them on Charon, because this was where the Alexandrine group and the Interplan agents working with them were gathering all the qube humanoids that had been apprehended, which, as far as they knew, were all that had been manufactured.All had been captured on the same day they had closed the facility in Vinmara, most of them in the same hour.Almost half of them had been on Mars.The entire operation had been planned and coordinated by word of mouth, and the precise moment for the execution of the plan communicated the day before, when Genette sent a single radio message, a performance of the old jazz standard Nows the Time.In every particular the plan had come off without a significant hitch, even though more than two thousand agents had taken part in the operation, and four hundred and ten humanoids captured.Not one of them had exhibited any sense that they might be in danger of arrest.Genettes plan now was to exile all these humanoids, along with the lawn bowler and about thirty other people involved with the qube attacks.An agreement had been made to use one of the starships being built out of Plutos moon Nix.This starship was in fact just a specialized terrariuman almost completely closed biological life support system, exceptionally well supplied, and with extremely powerful engines.It would now serve as a kind of prison ship, similar to the ones orbiting in the asteroid belt, but ejected from the solar system.The starship terrariums inside would be sealed, its navigating AI placed outside the sealed cylinder.And off it would go: four hundred qube humanoids, the lawn bowler, and the group of people who had been judged guilty of complicity in any of the attacks.It was not a big group, because the lawn bowler appeared to have conceived and designed the attacks in a way that did not need many human confederates to make it work.So: exile, from the solar system and from the rest of humanity.Surely Lakshmi should be in there too!Wahram objected to Genette.I agree, but we couldnt manage to grab her.The Venusians will have to deal with her, or maybe we can prosecute her on Ceres and see where it gets us.But this exile ship, Wahram said.What if the qubes break through to the controls?Reverse their voyage and come back, hungry for revenge and smarter than ever?The speeds are too great, Genette said easily.The fuel aboard will be quickly burned getting them to tremendous speed.By the time they dealt with the problem of refueling, it would take centuries to get back.By that time civilization will have worked out some way to deal with them.What do you imagine that will be?I have no idea.Were going to have to deal with qubes, theres no getting around that.We have the wolf by the ears.My sense is that if qubes are kept out of humanoid bodies, and out of the hands of angry programmers, theyll just be part of the scene, like Passepartout is now.Or Swans Pauline?Maybe keeping a qube in your head isnt a good idea, Genette admitted.I wonder if Swan would agree to move it into a wristqube like mine.Wahram doubted this, though he wasnt sure why.He was less and less sure of Swan, no matter what the issue in question happened to be.He went on to another uneasiness.Isnt this a clear case of cruel and unusual punishment?Its unusual, Genette allowed cheerfully.Even unique.But its cruelty is relative.Sent off with qubes?Isnt it a weird kind of solitary confinement, something out of a nightmare?Exile is not cruel.Believe me, because I know.The mind is its own place.They could in theory make quite a fine terrarium in there, and then settle an empty Earth somewhere off in the distance, and start a whole new wing of humanity.Theres nothing stopping them from that.So its just exile.I am an exile myself, and it is a recognized form of severe but nonlethal punishment.And this person killed three thousand people, just to test out a weapon.And also programmed quantum computers that now cant tell whether what theyre doing is good or bad.Theyve been given intentionality without adequate limits, and are an obvious danger, and we dont have a good defense against them right now.So I think sending them away is making a statement about how we treat qubes.We dont just turn them off and break them up, as some are calling for, but send dangerous ones off in exile, just like we send off humans.Thats got to be a good message to the qubes left behind.Well then keep them in boxes so we can keep them in our controlat least I hope we will.That may or may not work.But what Im hoping is that we can stop any more qubes of any kind being made, at least for a while, and take some time to look more closely into what smarter qubes or intentional qubes or qubes in bodies might mean.So to my mind, well have administered justice, and bought ourselves some time.So Im glad theres been agreement from the Plutonians and the Mondragon and all the other relevant parties, including Shukra.And hopefully Swan, when she hears about it, and everyone else.Maybe, Wahram said.He was still not comfortable with Genettes solution.But every alternative he came up with was either too harsh (death for all of them) or too lenient (reintegration into society).Exilethe first starship a prisonwell, there were prison terraria in the asteroid belt, locked from the outside and with conditions inside ranging from utopia to hell.So the lawn bowlers group and its creations could make what they wanted.Supposedly.It still struck him as a version of hell.When all was said and done, little Inspector Jean Genette could be quite as inhuman as the lawn bowler; sanguine, blithe, impenetrable; regarding Wahram now with a look that was the same for allsaint, criminal, stranger, brotherall of them regarded with the same birdlike gaze, frankly evaluative, interested, willing to be convinced.Still Wahram was uneasy, and he read the files on all the humans and humanoids they held captive, which at this point came to a few thousand pages.When he was done, he came back to Genette more upset than ever.Youve missed something here, he said sharply.Read the interviews and youll see that there was someone in that lab in Vinmara who was letting some of these qubanoids loose and sending them off to people elsewhere in the system who helped to hide them.The ones that Swan ran into in the Inner Mongolia, and at least four morethey all tell similar stories.Whoever was doing this told them they were defective, and that they needed to go on the lam if they wanted to keep from being demolished.The qubes didnt know what to make of that, and some of them acted strangely after they got loose.Maybe they were defective, I have no reason to disbelieve it.Anyway, this person in the lab was getting them away from Lakshmi!So does that person deserve exile also?And do the defective qubanoids that got away deserve exile?Genette frowned at this and promised it would get looked into.This was not satisfactory to Wahram.He had been involved with Genette and Alex in the problem of the strange qubes from the beginning, and now felt he was being somewhat shunted to the side.He rolled his wheelchair into a meeting of the Interplan investigators and other members of the group as they discussed the situation, and again made the case for these innocents caught up with the rest of their captives.In the end it was not unanimous, but a strong majority agreed: all the qubanoids were to go into exile; the lab assistant who had been setting the defectives loose would not.It turned out that this lab assistant had not only let them go, but also erased them from the labs records, in quite a clever bit of work, Genette informed Wahramas if it were the cleverness that justified the pardon.Wahram, still deeply unsatisfied, let the matter drop.The Venusian lab assistant, a young person scarcely older than the lawn bowler, would be free to go.And the poor defective qubes might be better off among their own kind.So when the time came, Wahram sat in the viewing chamber of the Interplan cruiser and watched with the rest of the people there as the matter antimatter engine fired up, and the First Quarter of Nix began its trip to the stars.It looked like any other terrarium on the move, maybe a little bit bigger.Ice formed a fair percentage of its mass, and the exterior looked like an ice statue of something like a great white dolphin, flying on a tail of lightning.What about the people who built it?Wahram asked.Wasnt that their starship?We have to replace it.They intend to send four in a kind of fleet, so we will make another one for them out of Hydra.We can take some of Charon too if we need it.So they will still have their four ships.Wahram remained troubled.I still dont know what I think of this.Genette did not seem concerned at that.Best we could do, Im afraid!It was a hard thing to manage offline and in utter secrecy.Quite a nifty little operation, if you ask me.Amazing what you can do with paper and synchronized watches.Every person involved had to behave with the utmost secrecy and completely trust the people they knew in the network, and they all had to be right about that for it to work.Its quite an accomplishment when you think about it.Agreed, Wahram said, but will it be enough?No.The problem remains.This just gives us a little breathing room.And you are confident you got all of them?Not at all.But it looks like the facility on Venus was the only one making them, or so Wangs qube believes.And weve got enough records from their energy use and input of materials to get a maximum count of how many could be made, and we got almost exactly that many.Possibly there are one or two still out there, but were thinking they will be too few to do any harm.They may be more of the defectives let free by that young lab assistant.Anyway, we will try to catch them if they are out there.Meaning, Wahram thought, that right now somewhere in the system there could be machines in human form, escaped into the crowd, doing their best to stay free, perhaps, when any X ray machine or other surveillance device would reveal what they wereout there hiding, trying to accomplish the goals they had been given, perhaps, or new ones they might choose for themselves, according to some self invented algorithm of survival.Damaged, dangerous, detached from any other consciousness, solitary and afraidin other words, just like everyone else.Quantum Walk (3)  on the edge of the marsh the

justice in human affairs, a good project.Other things we want to go slower: our own lives, the lives of those we love.Either way its a hunger for timemore time to do things, to experience things.Getting married at age 113 is the triumph of experience over hope.So many lives have already been lived.Ones hopes long since have been reduced to a focus on the things of the day.Experience has taught all it is going to teach; more experience will be a reiteration.But never quite reiteration.Life is always at most a pseudoiterative.Each day has its particulars.Performing the same actions day after day, in a ritual to ward off time, to hold the moment, does not remove these particulars, but rather burnishes them.The animals, our horizontal brothers and sisters, remind us; each day lived is a kind of adventure, a success.Nothing ever repeats.Each breath is a new suck at the atmosphere, a gasp for life.A hope for experience.Feel that and go on.Fitz Wahram sat in the meeting room of the Titan Planetary Relations council, thinking these thoughts.When it was his turn, he made his case to his colleagues.One would hope that after all this time the Terran nation states would have learned from experience and made their reconciliations with each other, such that their various ties with the off planet settlements were consistent and coherent, and all the confusion and discord that their current actions create been dispensed with.But no.They have not managed that.It may take them decades more, or even centuries.No one can say how Earth will go.Meanwhile, we have to restore some kind of relationship with our old patron Mars.The work around Saturn began as a Martian nitrogen hunt, as you know, and that was a big part of settling the Saturn system in the first place.So the complete break from Mars, while necessary in its time, does not have to stay permanent, nor should it.Were strong enough now that we can deal with Mars without being overwhelmed by them.Indeed, to engage them would be a sign of strength for us.So I propose that we go there and arrange to renew nitrogen exports from Titan to them, almost at the levels that existed before, but in a new arrangement that we control, in essence a fair trade.It would benefit both planets.The Titanic atmosphere still holds about twice as much nitrogen as we want it to have in the preferred state.That suggests a specific transfer quantity that we can set the conditions for.In return we can provide our part of a triangular trade: nitrogen from Titan to Mars, reconstruction and development assistance from Mars to Mercury, and heavy metals and rare earths from Mercury to Saturn.Also their help in assuring the Vulcan light imports.Questions and such from his interlocutors.Discussion.Then Wahram again:  The reinforcement of ties in all three directions would be helpful in the effort to band together in the face of Earths recidivist imperialism, and their internal conflicts and rivalries, which threaten to spill outward and overrun all of us.We might even help to heal some of these old problems.It would be a way of following up on the reanimation, which has produced such remarkable effects already.Like what?He was challenged.The Arctic League has become one of the most progressive and cooperative political organizations on Earth.The middle of North America is being repopulated as a buffalo grasslands to tremendous acclaim.The Amazonian rain forest is being expanded back into its full historical basin, now tended as parkland, somewhat as it was in the pre Columbian period.Southeast Asia, South Asia have achieved population balance and the biggest rewilding of all, which has helped their forests, water, and climate situation.These are all measurably improved situations since the reanimation occurred.There hasnt been anywhere near enough time to make those conclusions.The animal invasion is often described as a horrid botch that created a host of nightmare problems.Wrongly so.They wrangled about the situation on Earth for a while.Finally the senior advisor from the Saturn Administrative Group reminded them that the issue on the table was the creation of a three way trade with Mars and Mercury.Wahram pointed out that Mars had been considerably influenced and one might say infected by the qube humanoids that had infiltrated their system and only recently been ferreted out and sent into exile; the Martians were so pleased to be rid of them that they were revoking Jean Genettes exile status and welcoming the now celebrated inspector back home to be thanked for good service.Presumably the new dispensation there on Mars would include a more cooperative spirit.Many council members nodded at this good news, and they got down to details of quantities of nitrogen transport, schedules, and compensation.The ultimate millibar pressure of the Titanic atmosphere was debated.Wahram waited until most of the people in the room were feeling impatient about the matter, then called for a return to the question at hand.The principle of the proposal was approved by consensus and they closed the meeting.The last question had to do with how they would proceed to convey their agreement to their partners, and Wahram said, I am going to Mercury to propose marriage to Swan Er Hong.I hope we will take vows at the epithalamion on Olympus Mons.So we will be able to speak to the right people on Mars at that time.Ah, good, they all said.Congratulations.Some looked surprised; others nodded knowingly.That will make it all easier.Youll make something like a Saturn Mercury standing committee.Yes, Wahram said.SWAN  Swan left Earth feeling considerably pleased with herself for helping the qubical person light out for the territory, and pleased with Zasha too, which mattered to her much more than she had realized it would.She took the space elevator up from Quito and lived through the performance of Satyagraha yet again, and this time it was the peace of the final movement that struck her most, the scale rising in its simple octave over and over, like a meditation chant to lift you right off your feet; and dancing in the ever lightening g near the end made it a very physical feeling, a kind of euphoria as they were lifted on wings of song.She returned to Mercury in a terrarium called the Henry David.It was a classic New Englander, with a few small clapboard villages and some pasturage breaking up a hardwood and conifer mixed forest.It was October there, and the maples had gone red, so that there were trees violently yellow, orange, red, and green, all mixed and scattered together over the inside of the cylinder, such that when you looked up at it overhead, it appeared to be a speechless speech in some kind of round color language, trembling on the edge of meaning.Swan wandered through the forest on paths, went from one cleared hilltop to another.One day she took up leaves that had fallen and arranged them across a clearing so that they went from red to orange to yellow to yellow green to green, in a smooth progression.This colored line on the land pleased her greatly, as did the wind that blew it away.Another day she spent hours following a black bear and her cub.In the afternoon they came to an abandoned apple orchard, where one ancient crippled tree had nevertheless produced a lot of apples, so many that some branches drooped to the ground.The bears ate a ton of them.There was an upright half barrel next to the tree that had filled with rainwater, and the cub climbed into it and took a bath, its glossy fur going black and pointing in wet tips.Back on Mercury she settled into her life in Terminator.She woke out on her balcony, breakfasted in the morning cool, did her stretches to the sun, bowing uneasily to Sol Invictus.Looked over the city, registering all the familiar landmarks that had been rebuilt, and the new trees and shrubs, looking a little bigger every day, a little more in place.She had taken a postcard that Alex had had couriered to her long before, and tacked it to the wall over her kitchen sink, where Alexs handwriting proclaimed daily:  O joy of my spiritit is uncagedit darts like lightning!It is not enough to have this globe or a certain time,  I will have thousands of globes and all time.It was autumn now in Terminator too, and the row of Japanese fire maples on the terrace two down from her balcony had gone an incandescent red.Dust had settled on the royal blue roof tiles she could see below.The new weather program seemed to include more windy days than the old one had, and sometimes there were winds stronger than any she could remember.She liked that.Certain cold gusty winds would pull her loose from whatever she was doing and take her on long walks around the city.It was feeling very much bigger up front than before, the platform extended to provide more park and farm.There were new canals in the flat part of the city and the park.Bridges over canals, bike paths, broad boulevards and esplanades.Her town.Same but different.It occurred to her that the city could be expanded forward even farther into the night; in theory, as the decades and centuries passed they could cover the tracks westward all the way around the nightside of Mercury.She spent most of her days out in the farm, working on the pond and wetlands.The new estuary was not thriving and there were questions about salinity levels, and a little hydraulic tide they had going.Arguments, really.And she was still trying to understand why the Gibraltar apes didnt like the caves they had provided in a little hill with a west facing cliff face.The apes were gorgeous, and usually they didnt have problems the way people had problems.But there they were, hanging out on the flats under the caves, unwilling to go into them.At some point she might have to climb up there to take a look herself.While she was out there watching the apes, she thought about her life.Here she was, 137 years old.Body much abused the whole time; it would not last forever, or even necessarily go on much longer.On the other hand, the treatments were doing new things even compared to a few years before, and people were still working at improving them.Mqaret was almost two hundred.So it had to be thought about.Her close relationships were few, and perhaps no longer so close.She had everything she needed; her life was good.Her surviving child was out there somewhere, living her life in her own manner, not cratering to speak of.Occasionally in touch.Not the issue.Swan was closer to other people, and that was all right.Her young friend Kiran had stayed on Venus, had insisted on it, and was back in the thick of things there and sending her reports on a regular basis.It felt like more of a relationship than many she had, and there were more like that out there to come, no doubt; people were always grabbing her by the arm and pulling her into their lives, it seemed.Her farm crew was tight.She liked her work; she liked her play; she liked her art, the play that was work.So it was something else.Really the question became quite philosophical; how to be?What to care about?And how to become a little less solitary?Because now, with Alex gone, though she talked to many people, in the end she was missing someone to tell things to in the way she had always told Alex.Oh I miss you Hettie Moore  But theres no one here left to tell  The world has gone black before my eyes.In the farm by herself she sang the old ballad, and wondered what would make things right.Maybe nothing.There was a pruning of life by death.Parts died before the whole.When the people you loved died, part of you died.Some people by the time they went were like certain junipers she had seen, one live strip on a dead trunk.There was no way to counter that.No happiness but in virtue.No, that wasnt true.Each part of the triune brain had its own happiness.Lizard in the sun, mammal on the hunt, human doing something good.Whats good is whats good for the land.So when you worked as if on the hunt, in light and warmth, at making a landscapesome place for people to live in for ages to comethen you were triunely happy.Surely that should be enough.But then you wanted to share it.Just so there would be someone to be pleased together with.Alex had been pleased with her.She had seen the traveling isolatoes, solitary old spacers who made their own way in the world, who were not partnered in any fashion with other people.That was her crowd; she had been one of them herself for more than half her life.Had they all been on the hunt?She recalled something she had heard people say: I want to meet somebody.Meet; they meant mate.I want to mate somebody.Meet was the future subjunctive of mate, in the mood of desire.And when you looked around, you saw it: pair bonding kept coming back.It was a future conditional tense, a subjunctive verb: to mate somebody, and then meet them.It was an atavistic thing, as if they were swans, or some other creature with a genetic urge to pair off.Swan is not a swan, she told her baffled coworkers in the park.But how did she know?I want to meet somebody, she said to Mqaret experimentally.Mqaret laughed at her.You like this guy!This person Wahram from Saturn.So maybe what you mean is Ive met somebody.Swan stared at Mqaret.It still hadnt fully sunk in to her that it was possible to be loved.Or even to love.But I met him a long time ago.Ive known him for years now!Even better, Mqaret said.You know him.In fact you had to spend a lot of time with him.What happened in that utilidor?Didnt something happen?We whistled, mostly, she said.But yes.Something happened.Maybe thats what a marriage is, Mqaret said.Whistling together.Some kind of performance.I mean, not just a conversation, but a performance.Marriage, Swan repeated, marveling at the word.To her it was a concept from the Middle Ages, from old Earthan idea with a strong whiff of patriarchy and property.Not meant for space, not meant for longevity.One moved through ones life in epochs, each a stage in ones history, lasting some few or several years, and then circumstances changed and you were in a new life, with new associates.That could not be altered, not if you were out there riding the great merry go round; and so to deform ones life in the attempt to make a relation last longer than its natural term was to risk wrecking its end, such that it splintered back along its whole length and left a bitter wound and a sense that it had all been a lie, where really there should only be a passing on, in one of the little death and transfigurations of ones epochs.Thats just the way it was.At least so it seemed to her, and to many others she knew.It was the current structure of feeling in her culture and time.Spacers were free humans, free at last and human at last.So they all felt, and encouraged each other to feel, and she had always believed it, always agreed it was right.But structures of feeling were cultural, historical; they changed over time like people did; the structures themselves went through their own reincarnations.So if cultures changed over time, and an individual lived on through a change in that culture, then didnt the individual change too?Could they?Could she?But wasnt marriage a promise somehow not to change?She slogged around in the wetlands and kept on thinking about it.One day a frog the same color as the rocks hopped away from her accidental hand, then sat there staring up at her, alert and curious, calm but ready to leap again.Sorry, she said.I didnt see you.And yet now that she had, it sat there glossier than any rock, alive and breathing.She went out on a walkabout.Headed to the north of Terminators latitude, into the Tricrena Albedo.Out into the garbled chiaroscuro of the terminator, where sidelong rays of sunlight raked suddenly up the tilting land, blazing so violently that the still shadowed land appeared blacker than matter.Clashing shards of black and whiteher eye could scarcely put the landscape back together again.Just the way she liked it, sometimes.Her schizophrenic life space.She fell into sunwalker mode, oriented herself by the memorized maps inside her.She knew as she trudged blindly westward that she would soon come over the rise north of Mahler, pass some baked ballardian abandoned space plane runways, then find herself at the top of an escarpment, a little bulging crack in the land, very old, the land above overlooking a two hundred meter drop to the plains below.Luckily the escarpment sported a system of tilted ledges that served as a neat staircase down.She had been here before.These Ebersbacher Ledges were often trod by sunwalkers using this route, and had been swept clear of dust and rubble many years before.So it was a broken switchbacking path of clean stone tilts that led her down to the plain beyond.On Mercury the horizon was just the right distance away, she felt; not something you could reach out and touch, but something you could walk to and investigate.Out there now was a little group of sunwalkers, trudging patiently west.Little silver figures reminiscent of Inspector Genette, disappearing over the horizon.They would walk for a spell and then lie down in carts or travois to sleep while being pulled along by the others.Walking together, pulling sleeping people alonghow beautiful the sense of trust and care, the playful handing over of your life to strangerspart of being Mercurial.For a long time it had been all she had needed in the way of company.That and her city.She got to the bottom of the ledges and came onto the flat rubble plain of Tricrena Albedo.Here the trail disappeared, because any way was equally good.Here she could run into the night, gain ground on the dawn, stand on Yes Tor and watch the highest points of ground light like candles, then burn downward from their brilliant tips.To walk in the dawn perpetually, ah, so devoutly to be wished!Who could stand high noon or the wane of day?Leave the dawn behind, run back into the night.Forestall the daywho knew what it would bring?She had no plan, no idea.For a long time she ran and didnt think much beyond the rock under her, the lay of the land.Nothing more needed.They could tear the guts out of Mercury, take out every valuable mineral in it, and the surface would not look one whit different.It was already a clinker of a world.The battered face of an old friend.Rock scattered everywhere, rubble, kipple, ejecta.The blanket of dust.Gold in them thar hills.But friends talk.I want to be able to talk to someone and have it mean something to me.I want to hear things that interest me, that surprise me, no matter how impossible I am to surprise.Except in truth I am so easily surprised.How could it be that someone was not there to surprise someone so easily surprised.The saturnine person.What if there was a person you could depend on, someone who was steady, reliable, predictable, resolute; decisive after due thought; generous; kind.Phlegmatic, and yet prone to little gusts of enthusiasm, usually aesthetic pleasures of one sort or other.Happy in danger, a little drunk in danger.Someone capable of loving a landscape.Someone who liked to watch animals and chase them for a look.Someone who looked at her as if figuring her out was an interesting project and not just a problem to be solved, or part of the backdrop in some other more important drama.And looked at everyone else met with that same regard.Often with a little smile that seemed to express pleasure in the company shared.A reserved but friendly manner.If all our acquaintances were characterized in language only, we would look like collectors of contradictions, paradoxes, oxymorons.For every kind of this there was a balance of that.People cut both ways.In someone like him a little cheery laugh began to seem like boisterousness.She came to one of her most famous goldsworthies, from a time when she had been experimenting with setting slugs of lead and other metals that would melt in the heat of the day on slopes she had cut with channels, so that over the course of a brightside crossing, the slugs of lead or copper or tin would melt into the channels and form pictures or letters, always stretched such that they looked upright to observers on a viewing platform atop a nearby cliff.For this sculpture north of Mahler she had channeled two sets of letters carefully overlapping and intersecting each other, with gates for one word or other equally matched in their weakness.As the metal pigs melted in the sun they would run against the gates until one gate or other would fail, thus draining the reservoir of its molten contents.So, depending on what happened in the gates, the resulting letters of this installation would have spelled either LIVE or DIE.It was the last of a series of antinomies she had put to the landscape and the sun in those years, including all the seven virtues and vices overlapped, wrestling with each other like Jacob with God.So far the verdict was out; the process looked random.But in this particular instance both gates had broken at once, resulting in a flow insufficient to fill all the channels; some had filled preferentially over others, and the result, made of a bright swirl of silver and copper, had been the word LIE.Now she stood looking at it from the viewing platform.Even at the time it had struck her as apt; and now it was like a command.One could still see the empty troughs of the two overlaid words, the empty D and V; but certainly the word LIE, glowing metallically in the dark land, dominated.Very apt indeed.People said she must have arranged it that way on purpose, but she hadnt; the dams had been equal, their simultaneous break an act of their own, the letters filled a matter of the first surge, a clinamen.But it told the truth in some sense.They didnt live or diethey did bothand so lied.You lie and then you lie.So get on with it.After a while she turned south, to get over to the nearest platform before the city came gliding over the horizon.When she got over the low rim of the ancient crater Kenk, she would be able to see Terminators tracks, gleaming faintly in the valley below.From the top of Kenk, around to its southern side, she saw the tracks, and also a lone figure, toiling up the incline toward her.Round, tall; and she recognized the walk the moment she saw it, oh she knew that walk all right!She clicked on the common band: Wahram?Tis I, come hunting for you.You found me.Yes.Were you going to be coming back into town soon?Because I didnt bring anything to eat.Yes, I was.When did you get in?Yesterday.Ive just been hiking for a few hours.The city will be along anytime now.Good.Good.Lets go down to meet it.She walked down to him and gave him a hug.In their suits she still knew his body well, round and full, a bigger person than her.Thanks for coming out to get me.Oh, my pleasure, I assure you.I came all the way from Titan.I thought you might have.How is your new leg?He gestured down at it.I keep placing it and finding its not quite where I thought it was.Apparently the ghost nerves of the old leg are still speaking to me and messing me up.Just like my head!Swan said without thinking, and laughed painfully.Every time I grow a new one its not quite where I thought it was.Wahram regarded her, smiling.Im told it is a quick adjustment.Hmm.In fact, speaking of growing new headsI was wondering if you had thought about what I said when we were marooned.And also of course on Venus afterward.Yes, I have.And?Well, I dont know.Wahram frowned.Have you talked to Pauline about it?Well, I suppose.In fact this had not even occurred to her.Wahram regarded her.The sun was going to hit them soon.He said, Pauline, will you marry me?Yes, said Pauline.Hey wait a minute!Swan exclaimed.Im the one who has to say yes here.I thought you just did, Wahram said.No I did not!Pauline is very much a separate entity in here.Thats why you locked me out of your meetings, right?Yes, but because you two are one.And so we couldnt let you in without letting her in too.I am not the first to observe that since you were the one who programmed Pauline, and continue to do so, she is a kind of projection of you  Not at all!or, well, maybe she would be better described as one of your works of art.They have often been very personal things.My rock piles, personal?Yes.Not as personal as sitting naked on a block of ice for a week drinking your own blood, but nevertheless, very personal.Well, but Pauline is not art.Im not so sure.Maybe shes something like a ventriloquists dummy.Isnt that art?Some device we speak through.So I am very encouraged.Dont be!But he obviously was.Over time, Swan realized, that would matterthat he believed in Pauline.She walked down toward the nearest platform and he followed her.After a while he said, Thank you, Pauline.Youre welcome, Pauline replied.Extracts (18)  to form a sentence is to collapse many superposed wave functions to a single thought universe.Multiplying the lost universes word

Who decides when its time to act?No one decides.The moment happens.No.We decide.How we decide is an interesting question.But even if we dont know the answer to it, we decide  although the events right before and after the year 2312 were important and signaled changes latent in the situation at the time, nothing tipped decisively then, there was no portal they passed through saying, This is a new period, this is a new age.Events set in train were mired and complex, and many took decades more to come to fruition.That the Mondragon would unify much of Earth, that Mars would recover from its qube inflected withdrawal and rejoin the Mondragonnone of that was clear to us thenthings could have shifted into quite different channels and  of course the disparities between individual and planetary time can never be reconciled.What is to be noted here is less the unification of these disparate temporalities than rather their surcharge and overlap.Its the surcharge and overlap that create the feel of any given time.Out of this jumbled superimposition of different kinds of temporal models History does in fact emergeas a work of art, like any other work of art, but made by everyone together.And it doesnt stop.Things happen, events, accomplishments; wins and losses; Pyrrhic victories, rearguard actions; and though there can be crucial events, the plot does not end in a year like 2312, but rather several decades later, if that  what we see when we contemplate the formation of the triple alliance of Mars, Saturn, and Mercury, or the intervention of the Mondragon Accord into the balkanized Earth, or Marss return to the Mondragon, is a kind of unstable interregnum, a shift in the spinning of the great merry go round as the weights are redistributed and something new begins, and a shuddering thus torques the system for years, before finally slipping into some newly stabilized rotation  On Venus the backlash against the plot to spin up the planet caused a long and bitter civil war, largely invisible to the rest of the system, fought with knives and depressurization, and only resolved in the latter half of the twenty fourth century with a general referendum of the entire population, which decisively chose to renew the bombardment of the equator and initiate the spectacularly destructive creation of a hundred hour Venusian day  the so called invisible revolutions on Earth led to the recreation of its landscapes both physical and political, all of which followed the Reanimation.In that same period the integration of qube and human existence was another invisible revolution, a struggle vexing the minds of every engineer, philosopher, and qube who ever attacked the problem  on Mars it became clear that a small working group within the official government had been infiltrated and influenced by a cadre of qubed simulacra, who were summarily kidnapped and sent into exile, after which a profound reconsideration of their governance brought them closer to their democratic system as described, and reentry in the Mondragon Accord followed  with majorities on Callisto, Ganymede, Europa, Titan, Triton, and even Luna declaring the intention to fully terraform their worlds, all volatiles and nitrogen in particular became much more expensive; inflation struck the entire system at once; and by the end of the twenty fourth century the Saturn League had amassed a titanic fortune  all the invisible events make the history of that time hard to write.And all the events continued to occur against the most intense resistance of time, material, and human recalcitrancehuman fear, in fact, seizing with a desperate grip various imagined props out of the past that were somehow felt to hold the world together.Because of this, there is still and always the risk of utter failure and mad gibbering extinction.There is no alternative to continuing to struggle      Epilogue  Descending to Mars on its Pavonis space elevator, you look down through the clear floor at the red planet rising to meet you.The three prince volcanoes topping the Tharsis bulge bulk in a line, like mounds built by a mound building tribe of red people.Off to the west Olympus Mons rears like a round continent all its own, its encircling ten kilometer cliff from this vantage no more than a beveled line around its foot.All the rest of the planet is cut into enormous red polygons by the many green lines crisscrossing the planetthe famous canals, incised into the landscape in the first days of terraforming.They used orbiting Birch solettas that focused sunlight like a magnifying glass on the land, creating temperatures so high that the rock both vaporized and melted.Quite a bit of Mars had to be thus burned to get all the air and heat they wanted; so to distribute that burn they had decided to use the Lowell maps of the late nineteenth century as inspiration, and platted the burn accordingly.Having gone that far, they also adopted the old nomenclature for these canals, a witches brew of Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Egyptian, and other ancient languages, so that you now descend to places with names like Nodus Gordii, Phaethontis, Icaria, Tractus Albus, Nilokeras, Phoenicis Lacus.The greened strips crossing the red land are about hundred kilometers wide, and are only threaded by their actual canals.The strips sometimes run in pairs across the red desert.They meet at vaguely hexagonal angles, and the nodes are lush oases, with elegant cities clustered around complexes of waterways and locks, ponds and fountains.Thus a nineteenth century fantasy forms the basis for the actual landscape currently existing.Some call it bad taste.But they were in a hurry, back in the beginning, and this is what they had to show for it.North of Olympus Mons the wedding party walked out of the doors of a train station into the open air, just as if they had been on Earth.It was early in the morning, cool and breezy.The sky was a Maxfield Parrish blue; the trees scattered about in small groves were enormous sequoia, eucalyptus, valley oak.The canal ran across the plain below the hill they were on, one side of it lined with cypress trees.Between its levees the canals water looked as if it stood a little higher than the land around it.In many places the levee tops were broad high boulevards, green and crowded with buildings and people.Lower on the sides of the levees it could sometimes be seen that they were composed of endless mounds of black glass.Along the top of one levee they rode a tram, headed for Olympus Mons.Wide streets angled out into the green fields that flitted by below them.These grassy boulevards were flanked by blocky buildings that were often faced with ceramic murals and had an Art Deco look.They passed white plazas under palm trees and remarked to each other the lush beauty, also the uniformity of style, with its hexagonal suggestion of a hive mind.A green and pleasant land.They trammed from oasis to oasis, in a regular flashing of light and shadow created by the long rows of cypress trees by the tracks.Gardens in the desert.The hyperterran look combined with the Mercury light gravity created a dreamscape feel.Mercury would never look like this.Nowhere else could look like this.Inspector Genette, standing on the chair by the window and looking out intently at the passing scene, said, I lived there once, gesturing down at one swiftly passing town square.I think it was in that building right there.Their tram stopped in a train station in Hougeria, where they were going to transfer to a maglev train to ascend the northeast side of Olympus Mons.While they waited for their train, they took a walk out of the station and around the city center.All the canals were iced over here, and people were out ice skating, hands behind their backs.It was sunny but chill.Swan complained about the trip up the great volcano: Whats the point of coming to Mars if we go right up out of the atmosphere and have to stay in a tent again?Up there we could be anywhere.This was regarded by her companions as a rhetorical question, as they were all quite sure she remembered they were attending the epithalamion.Wahram shaded his eyes and looked south, up the side of the great volcano.They were at the only part of the circumference of Olympus Mons that was not guarded by an immense escarpment, a circular cliff ten kilometers high that was remarkably uniform all the way around the mountain; but here a flood of lava late in the volcanos active life had poured down and over the escarpmenthad fallen in a ten kilometer firefall, which Wahram was now attempting to imagineten thousand meters of free fall, cooling on the way no doubt, from red to orange to black, while the spill at the bottom piled up on itself and rose higher and higher, until the cliff was entirely erased under lava, after which the molten rock continued to flow northeast, leaving in the end a broad and gentle ramp extending all the way from the upper slopes of the volcano down to the plain.Thus the land under them now, its fiery past.After this we can tour the lowlands, Wahram said.Honeymoon at the beach, so to speak.Good.I want to go swimming in the Hellas Sea.Me too.When the time came, they got in one of the pressurized cars of their maglev train, along with many other wedding parties, and the train headed up the ramp toward the summit.It was a long lift, and took them through a Martian red sunset, and then a night of parties and troubled sleep.At dawn they woke to find the train entering the station on the southeast slope of the volcanos broad summit.Here on the apron of little Crater Zp a big clear tent covered the planets traditional festival space.They had arrived on the first morning of the epithalamion.From the inside, the tenting could scarcely be seen; it was much less visible than Terminators dome, and it seemed as if they stood in the open air, which was warm and aromatic.A black roof of starry space stood overhead, turning blue only just over the horizon; the atmosphere was almost entirely below them.They had to be inside a tent, and knowing that, one could just make it out here and there, prisming against the border of blue and black sky.Olympus Mons was so big that the distant horizon to the east and south was still part of the mountain; they could not see the Tharsis volcanoes over the horizon to the east, nor any of the planet below the encircling escarpment.All the land they could see was as bare and red as it had been in the beginning, with only the blue rind of air over the horizon to reveal what they had done to this world.All the tented land of the festival space was on a mild tilt, and had been terraced, therefore, to make flat surfaces.The result looked like certain terraced hillsides in Asia: a few hundred bands of level land ran down the slope, the terrace walls between them curving like contour intervals on a map.Three broad low angled staircases cut up through these terrace walls, and some of their wedding party remarked at how this reminded them a bit of the Great Staircase in Terminator; but these staircases extended for four or five kilometers each and spanned a vertical reach of perhaps three hundred metersit was hard to judge, given the vastness of the volcano outside the tent.The epithalamion was the wedding day for Mars and for visitors from all over the system.Now the festival space was busy with movement, and loud with voices, as a few hundred couples moved up and down the staircases with their groups, finding the terraces reserved for them.The three staircases were heaped with flowers for the day.One could not avoid stepping on flowers, and their bright colors stained the big quartzite flagstones covering the risers.Wahram and Swan and their group came to their terrace, number 312.When Swan saw that their friends had decorated the terrace in flowers so as to make it look somewhat as if Terminators Great Staircase were running through the seashell architecture of Iapetus, she smiled and gave Wahram a hug.They stood together smiling as their party of friends applauded them.Wahram was dressed in Saturnian black and resembled a dreadful Roman emperor or, yes, a giant amphibian.Mr.Toad was indeed beginning his wild ride.Swan was in a red dress that made it look as if she stood in a rose of fire.She would not let go of Wahrams hand as they ascended littler stairs onto the dais where they were going to conduct their ceremony.Music was playing all over the festival grounds, and they could hear very distinctly a gamelan from the terrace below, but the overlapping musics were part of the epithalamion experience, and their own ceremony was to be accompanied by the galloping finale of Brahmss Second SymphonyWahrams choice, but Swan had approved.She kept looking up at him as Inspector Genette tapped at Passepartouts screen to call up the poem they had asked him to read.Wahram seemed to be mostly looking out at the view.It was still morning, and the sunlight slanted in at them in almost Mercurial splendor.It was a huge planet.All the couples above and below them were performing their particular nuptials.The space was so big, the music so various, that each ceremony took place in a little bubble world of its own; but the sight and sound of all of them together was very much part of each one.In their particular space, Saturn and Mercury were well represented.Mqaret was there, also Wang, and Kiran, and some of Swans farm team.Zasha too.Wahrams crche was represented by Dana and Joyce, and the Satyr of Pan.They all stood in a disorganized mass around the dais, but the two populations could be easily distinguished, the Saturnians in their black and gray and blue, the Mercurials in their reds and golds.There was also a group of Genettes old Martian friends, many of them smalls.Apparently all the smalls at the festival were to congregate later to sing small favorites like I Met Her in a Phobos Restaurant and Lovely Rita, Meter Maid and Were Off to See the Wizard.Everyone on the terrace was looking pleased.They were eyeing each other and smiling: Our friends are doing something crazy, their looks said, something crazy and beautiful, isnt it great?Lovesome kind of leap of the imagination.Inexplicable.It was going to be quite a party.Inspector Genette, standing on a lectern to be almost at eye level with the two of them, raised their clasped hands together and said, You two, Swan and Wahram, have decided to marry and become life partners, for as long as you both shall live.Wahram, do you affirm this?I do so affirm.Swan, do you affirm this?Yes.Do it, then.Live it, and everyone here, help them to live it.I now recite some lines from Emily Dickinson that describe very well the symbiogenesis they intend to enact:  Brain of his brain  Blood of his blood  Two livesone beingnow  All lifeto know each other  Whom we can never learn  Just finding outwhat puzzled us  Without the lexicon!The inspector smiled at this thought, raised a hand.By the authority vested in me by you and by the Mondragon Accord, and even by Mars, I declare that Swan Er Hong and Fitz Wahram by mutual agreement are now married.Genette hopped off the lectern.Swan and Wahram faced each other; briefly they kissed.Then they turned and faced the group below them, and their friends applauded.The Brahms surged to its dizzy end, trombones blaring.Swan took a gold ring held up by the inspector, who made a lovely ring bearer, and pulled up Wahrams left hand.She saw he was squinting down the slope of Olympus, the look on his face pensive, almost melancholy.She squeezed his hand and he looked at her.Well, he said with the tiniest of smiles, I guess now we get to walk the second half of the tunnel.No!she cried, and thumped him on the chest, then jammed the ring over the knuckle of his ring finger.This is for life.
