But there were other factors in Bremens martial calculations.The Ariekei were not pacifists.They sometimes conducted obscure internecine murders and feuds, I had been told; and whatever Wyatt said, whatever the reasons, there had been violent confrontations, deaths, between our species, in the early years of contact.Protocols between us were very firm, and for generations, thered been no trouble in relations.So it felt absurd to imagine the Ariekei, the city, ever turning against Embassytown.But we were some thousands, and they were many many times that, and they had weapons.Wyatt was more than a bureaucrat.He represented Bremen, officially our protector; and as such, he must be armed.His staff were suspiciously athletic for office workers.It was well known that there were weapon caches in Embassytown, to which Wyatt alone had access.The hidden silos were rumoured to contain firepower of a different magnitude from our own paltry guns.There for our benefit, of course, the claim was.Bremen officials arrived with the keys deep coded in their augmens.It was impolitic and a little frightening of Wyatt to state so blatantly, even to me, an outsider of sorts and a friend of his, of sorts, that his staff were soldiers, with access to arms, and he their CO.It was true that he was patient.He ignored Embassytowns minor to moderate embezzlement when the miabs came, and every few years when Bremen taxes were collected.He encouraged his officers to mix with Staff and commoners, and even sanctioned the occasional intermarriage.Like all colonial postings, his was a difficult job.With communication with his bosses so occasional, initiative and flexibility were vital.Wed had officious women and men in his post before, and it had made ugly politics.In return for his softly softly stance Wyatt felt owed.That the Ambassadors were unfair.I liked Wyatt but he was nave.He was Bremens man, when the lights went out.I understood that and what it meant, even if he did not.Formerly, 5  HOSTS WOULD SOMETIMES bob into view, alone or in small groups, zelles at their feet, walking their slowed down scuttle through our alleyways.Who can say what their errands were?Perhaps they were sightseeing, or taking what, according to odd topographies, were shortcuts, into our quarter and out again.Some came deep into the aeoli breath, right into Embassytown neighbourhoods, and of these some were looking for the similes.These Ariekei were fans.Every few days one or two or a little conclave would arrive with dainty chitin steps.They would enter The Cravat, their fanwings twitching, wearing clothes for displaysashes fronded with fins and filigrees that each caught the wind with a particular sound, as distinct as garish colours.Our public demands us, someone said the first time I saw such an approach.Despite the faux weary joke anyone could tell that this audience meant a great deal to the similes.The one time I persuaded Ehrsul to come with me, ostensibly to store up anecdotes so we could later laugh at my new acquaintances, the arrival of some Hosts seemed to discombobulate her.She ignored my whispers about the Ariekei, did not speak much except in brief polite non sequiturs.Id been with her in Hosts company before, of course, but never in so informal a setting, never according to their unknown whims, not terms requested by Embassytown panjandrums.She never came back.The owners and regular clientele of The Cravat would courteously ignore the Hosts, which would murmur to each other.Their eye corals would crane and the tines separate, looking us over as we looked back.Waiters and customers stepped smoothly around them.The Hosts would talk quietly as they examined us.Says its looking for the one who balanced metal, someone would translate.Thats you, Burnham.Stand up, man!Make yourself known.Theyre talking about your clothes, Sasha.That one says Im more useful than you aresays he speaks me all the time.Thats not what it says, you cheeky sod...So on.When the Hosts gathered around me, sometimes I had to suppress a moment of memory of child me in that restaurant.I didnt find it hard to recognise repeat visitors, by that configuration of eye corals, those patterns on the fanwing.With the exhilaration of minor blasphemy we christened them according to these peculiarities: Stumpy, Croissant, Fiver.They, it seemed, recognised each of us as easily.We learnt the favourite similes of many.One of my own regular articulators was a tall Host with a vivid black and red fanwing, just enough like a flamenco dress for us to call it Spanish Dancer.It does this brilliant thing, Hasser said to me.He knew I was hardly fluent.When it talks about you.I could see him groping for nuances.When we talk about talking, it says, most of us are like the girl who ate what was given to her.But we might choose what we say with her.Its virtuoso.He shrugged at my expression and would have left it, but I made him explain.In the main my simile was used to describe a kind of making do.Spanish Dancer and its friends, though, by some odd rhetoric, by emphasis on a certain syllable, spoke me rather to imply potential change.That was the kind of panache that could get Hosts ecstatic.I had no idea whether many of them had always been so fascinated by Language, or whether that obsession resulted from their interactions with the Ambassadors, and with us strange Languageless things.Scile always wanted details of what had happened, who had said what, which Hosts had been there.Its not fair, I told him.You wont come with me, but you get annoyed if I cant repeat every tedious thing anyone said?I wouldnt be welcome and you know it.That was true.Why do you keep going if its so dull?It was a reasonable question.The excitement with which the other similes reacted to the Host visitors, and the range, or its lack, of what they talked about when there were no Hosts there, irritated me, greatly, every time.I think I had, though, a sense that this was where things might occur, that this was important.THERE WAS A HOST who often accompanied Spanish Dancer.It was squatter than most, its legs gnarled, its underbelly more pendulous, as it approached old age.For some reason I forget we named it Beehive.Ive seen it before, said Shanita.It spoke incessantly, and we listened, but it seemed a mixture of half sentences.We could make no sense of what it said.I remembered where I knew it from: my first ever journey into the city.It had competed at that Festival of Lies.It had been unusually able to misdescribe that untruth target object.It had called the thing some wrong colour.Its a liar, I said.I was clicking my fingers.Ive seen it before too.Hm, said Valdik.He looked rather suspicious.Whats it saying now?Beehive was circling, watching us, scratching at the air with its giftwing.Like this, like this,  Hasser translated.He shook his head, Ive no idea.Like, they are, similar, different, not the same, the same.The Cravat wasnt the only place we met, but it was by far the most common venue.Occasionally we might get together in a restaurant near the shopping districts, or the canalside benches of another parlour, but only when planned in advance and only from some vague sense of propriety, of not being hidebound.The Cravat, though, was where the Hosts had come to know they might find us, and being so found was very much the point.The similes thought of themselves as a salon of debate, but only a certain range of dissidence was permissible.Once a young man tried to engage us with arguments that turned from independence to seditionism, anti Staffist stuff, and I had to intervene to save him from a beating.I took him outside.Go, I told him.A crowd of the similes were gathered, jeering, shouting at him to come back and try impugning the Ambassadors one more time.He said, I thought they were supposed to be radicals.He looked so forlorn I wanted to give him a hug.That lot?Depends who you ask, I said.Yeah, theyd be traitors according to Bremen.But theyre more loyal to Staff than the Staff are.Plebiscite politics were absurd in Embassytown.As if any of us could speak to Hosts!And for The Cravat crew, even ignoring the fact of Embassytowns inevitable collapse in the event of their absence, without Ambassadors, who would speak these men and women so proud of being similes to the Hosts?Latterday, 7  THE ARIEKEI didnt respond to any attempts at contact.In those incommunicado hours, I more than once considered buzzing CalVin, or Scile, to demand information: they would be more likely than anyone else I knew to have some.It wasnt the confrontation that stopped me, but the conviction that I wouldnt be able to shame or bully anything out of them.It was a spring in Embassytown and the chill was dissipating.From high in the Embassy I looked over the roofscape of the city, to animalships and blinking architecture.Something was changing.A colour or its lack, a motion, a palsy.A corvid rose from an Embassy landing pad, moved through the sky to the citys airspace, edged from place to place, hovering, looking for somewhere to land; defeated, it returned.The Ambassadors aboard must have sent messages down to the various housebodies they overflew, without response.There were probably still plenty of Embassytowners who didnt yet know anything was wrong.The official press were loyal or inefficient.But there had been many people at that party, and stories were spreading.THE SUN still rose, and the shops sold things, and people went to work.It was a slow catastrophe.I called the number Ehrsul had given me, which she had extracted from a newly and imperfectly upgraded net, which she had told me was Ezs.Heor whomever it was Id calleddidnt answer.I kept swearing, as quietly as I could make myself, and tried again, again without result.Later I learnt that that day, in desperation, Ambassadors went into the city on foot.Pairs of desperate doppels accosted the Hosts they met, speaking Language at them through the transmitters of their aeoli helmets and receiving polite non answers, or incomprehension, or unhelpful intimations of disaster.Someone came to my house.I opened the door and it was Ra, standing there on my threshold.I stared at him in silence for long seconds.You look surprised, he said.Understatement, I said.I stepped aside for him.Ra kept taking his buzzer out and making as if to switch it off, then leaving it on.They trying to reach you?I said.Only Wyatt, he said.Really?No one else?No Ambassadors?You not being followed?How are you?he said.I was thinking...We sat for a long time on chairs facing each other.He looked over his shoulder, behind himself, more than once.There was nothing there but my wall.Wheres Ez?I said.He shrugged.Hes gone out.Shouldnt you be together?He shrugged again.In the Embassy?Look, Ra, how did you even get out?Id have thought theyd have you on bloody lockdown.If it had been me in charge, I would have incarcerated EzRa, to control the situation, or contain it, whatever the situation was.Perhaps they had tried.But if Ra was telling the truth, both the new Ambassador had got away.Yeah, well, he said.You know.Needs must.I just wanted to...Had to split.I had to laugh a second at that.There had to be quite a story there.So, I said eventually.How do you like our little town?He laughed in turn.Jesus, he said.As if hed seen something good and unexpected.Outside, gulls sounded.They veered, headed constantly for the sea they glimpsed kilometres away, were turned back constantly by sculpted winds and aeoli breath.It was very rare that any broke out into the proper local air, and died.You have to help me, he said.I need to know whats going on.Are you joking?I said.What do you think I know?Jesus, this is a comedy of errors.What do you think Ive been trying to find out, for Gods sake?Why have you come to me?Ive spoken to everyone I could find who was at that party  Didnt try very hard, did you, if you only just got to me...All the Staff, I mean, and other people from the Embassy.The higher up ones wouldnt say anything to me, and the rest...A couple of them told me to talk to you.Well, I dont know why.I thought you were in the middle of it all, I thought youd...Whoever up there does know something, theyre not telling me.Us.But these others, they just...They said you know people, Avice.Ambassadors.And that people tell you things.I shook my head.Thats just bloody outsider chic, I exhaled.You thought you could go a roundabout way, get something through me?Theyre just saying that because Im immerser.And because I was sleeping with CalVin, for a while.But not for months.Local months, not Bremen months.My own damn husbands a foreigner and he knows more than me, and he wont even talk to me.I stared at him.You seriously telling me youve got no idea whats happening?Does Wyatt know youre here?No.He helped me slip away, but...And neither does Ez.Its not their business.He bit his lip.Well, officially it is, I mean...I just wanted...After a silence, Ra met my eye.He stood.Look, he said, all of a sudden calm.I need to find out whats going on.Wyatt is worse than useless.Ezs trying to pull rank.Well see how far that gets him.And I hear you might know people who know things.In that moment he seemed not like Ezs luggage, but an officer and an agent of a colonial power.Tell me, I said at last.What you do know.Whats been going on.What youve heard, suspect, anything.The Hosts had come back.Two days of silence, and then they had been at the Embassy, a troupe of heavy presences swaying across a landing pod.At least forty of them, he said.Christ knows how they fit into their vessel.They were asking for me and Ez.The way he told it, the Ariekei had barely responded to Ambassadors questions and greetings.They demanded, repeatedly and with strange rudeness, to speak to EzRa.I trained for this, Ra said.Ive studied them, Ive studied Language.You saw the first group meet us at the party?That wasnt normal, was it?I knew it wasnt.This was the same, only more.They were...agitated.Talking nonsense.I was there already, but then Ez came in and then they recognised us.Started saying: Please, good evening Ambassador EzRa, please, please, yes.Like that.Some of the otherslike your friends CalVintried to get in our way.Telling us no.Wed said too much.He shook his head.And the Hosts are edging closer and closer.Weve got nowhere to go, and theyre huge.Its feeling...So we just...raised our voices and spoke Language.Ez and I.  We said good evening.Told them it was an honour.And when we did  When they spoke the same thing happened as had before, but this time to a larger little multitude.I might have been able to track down footage or trid of the occurrencethere must have been vespcams therebut Ra told me and I could easily imagine it.The crowd of Hosts stiffening; some staggering; maybe tumbling in carapace piles.Sounds, the double calls of Ariekene distress, becoming something unfamiliar, counterpoints.Were they swooning?Their noises went up and down in complex relation to EzRas voice.We tried to keep going, Ra said.To keep talking.But in the end Ez just petered out.So I did too.When they did, the Host in front rebudded open its eyes and craned them backwards at its companions, without turning its body, and said to them: I told you.The Ariekei had staggered in the wood walled stateroom, with the concrete of Embassytown beyond, and the sky dusted with birds in their air cage.The Ambassadors and Staff were left standing half to attention and bewildered.We thought of Ariekei in terms of stuff from an antique worldwe looked at our Hosts and saw insect horse coral fan things.Those were chimeras of our own baggage.There they were, the Hosts, humming polyphonically in reveries that were utterly their own.They left.Some Ambassadors were trying to stop them but short of actually getting in their way, what could they do?They were shouting at them to stay, to talk.EdGar and LoGan were screaming, JoaQuin and AgNes were...trying to be more persuasive.But the Hosts just marched back out.Me and Ez were saying what should we do, and CalVin and ArnOld were saying wed done quite enough.He held his head in his hands.Now not even MagDall talk to us.I havent seen them for days.Dont you want to know whats going on?Of course, I said.Dont be absurd.There was a lot of shouting.Whos Oratees?I said.I dont know, he said.Why?CalVin and HenRy mentioned them, I said.Simmons half heard insight.I think they might be who to find.I thought you might know...You mean Oratees, or CalVin, or HenRy might be who to find?I dont know, I said....Yes.I shrugged, Yes, why not?I thought you could help, he said.People have a lot of faith in your abilities.Did they tell you I can floak?I said.I wish Id never told them that fucking word.They think I can do anything now.Except they dont, really: they just want the opportunity to say floak.Theyre talking to the exots.Ra said.The Ambassadors have to let the Kedis and the others know somethings happening.They were obviously hoping theyd have things under control, but...My doorbell sounded again.Wait, he said, but I was already up and out of the room.I opened my door to constables and Security officers.Some were men younger than me, looking shy.Ms.Benner Cho?one said.Sorry to disturb you.I believe, uh, is Ra here?He stumbled over the lack of honorific.Avice, where is he?I knew that voice.MagDa?I said.Id not seen them behind the escort.The Ambassador pushed their way to the front.We need to talk to them.Urgently.Hello.It was Ra, come up behind me.I didnt turn.Ra.I thought theyd be furious, but Mag and Da looked just relieved to see him.Emotional.There you are.You have to come back.You need protective custody, sir, an officer said.MagDa seemed exasperated by that, in fact, but they didnt interrupt.For your safety.Until weve got things under control.Please come with us.Ra stood up tall.The officer met his eye.Ra nodded to me, after a moment, and let them take him.I nodded back.I was vaguely disappointed in him.When they led him away they didnt lock his hands together.They walked respectfully beside him, like what they said they were, a protective corps.It was a sort of courtesy, I suppose, though I dont think anyone with a passing understanding of Embassytown politics wouldnt have known he was more or less under arrest.I watched him go, to join Ez, and perhaps Wyatt, in what I was sure would be scrupulously well kept rooms, locked and guarded from the outside.Formerly, 6  IN ITS RELIGIOUS LAWS Embassytown was a cutting from Bremen.There was no established church, but as with many smaller colonies, its founders had included a reasonable minority of faithful.The Church of God Pharotekton was as close as we came to an official congregation.Its lighthouse towers jutted through Embassytown roofs, their beacons spinning, rotating spokes of light at night.There were other congregations: tiny synagogues; temples; mosques; churches, mustering a few score regulars.A handful of ultra orthodox in each tradition stood firm against ungodly innovations, attempting to maintain religious calendars based on Bremens thirty seven hour days, or according to insane nostalgia on the supposed days and seasons of Terre.Like the Hosts, the Kedis of Embassytown had no gods: according to their professed faith the souls of their ancestors and of their unborn were united in a never ending jealous war against them, the living, but they mostly displayed a far less bleak and embattled outlook than that theology would suggest.There were religious Shurasi, but only dissidents: most were atheist, perhaps because apart from through accident, they didnt die and were very rarely born.Embassytowners were free not to believe.I wasnt used to thinking about evil.BEEHIVE'S NAME was , we gleaned from its conversations with other Hosts.I told CalVin, mangling the name with my monovoice, saying the Cut and Turn one after the other.Can you find out when its competing at another Festival of Lies?I said.Its a loyal fan of mine, and Id like to...return the favour.You want to go......to another festival?Yeah.Me and another couple of the similes.It had occurred as a whim, mere curiosity about my observer, but having thought of it I could not let the idea go.When Id mooted it to Hasser and a couple of the others, theyd been enthusiastic.Do you think we could do that?Think you could get us in again?It had been a while since wed been summoned to any Languagefests, and though I was alone among them in being more intrigued by the lying than by my own deployment, the other Cravateers would hardly say no to any entry.CalVin did pursue this, though not with the best grace.I wondered at the time why they were indulging me at all.One or the other always behaved with surliness to me.The differences in their demeanours were tiny, but I was used to Ambassadors and could sense them.I thought that they were taking turns to be colder and warmer, in a variant of traditional police procedure.In The Cravat, conversations between the Hosts illuminated disagreements.They had camps, constituted by theories and arcane politics.Some seemed to love usof course I shouldnt use that wordas spectacle.Some rated our various merits: we called them the critics.The man who swims with the fishes is simple, one said.The girl who ate what was given to her is like more things.Valdik laughed but wasnt happy to hear that the trope of him was trite.Beehive, which I started to call Surl Tesh echer, a failure closer to its name, was the guru of another group.Champion liar.It had regular companions: Spanish Dancer; and one we called Spindle; and one Longjohnit had a biorigged replacement hoof.Of what any of us understood its hard to approximate what they said in Anglo Ubiq: think of people circling an exhibit in a gallery, staring at it, from time to time uttering a single word or short phrase, like Incomplete, or Potential, or Intricacies of fact and uncertainties of expression, and occasional longer opaque things.The birds circle like the girl who ate what was put in front of her,  Hasser translated.The birds are like the girl who ate what was put in front of her and are like the man who swims with fishes and are like the split stone...The other Ariekei, those not of s party, loudly answered these garbled claims.They responded to the presence of  and its companions with excitement or agitation.Contrariwise, , Spanish Dancer and the others didnt acknowledge the critics at all, that I could tell.We called s group the Professors.stretched the logic of analogythe birds were not like me, having eaten the food given to me, as far as most of the other Ariekei could see.They think its being disrespectful when it says they are, Hasser said.He looked unhappy.The birds are like the girl who ate what she was given, one of the Professors said again.It stuttered as it spoke, it mangled its words, had to stop and start and try again.AN EARLY winter day I came to The Cravatstill attending, I noted wrylydirty with leaf muck and cold dust from Embassytown alleys.Valdik was the only other simile there.He was uncomfortable with me, less talkative even than usual.I wondered if perhaps hed had some bad news about his outside life, of which I knew and wanted to know nothing.We sat in silence that was not companionable.After one coffee I was ready to leave, when Shanita and Darius came in together.She was a taciturn simile Id always sensed was a bit intimidated by me; he was frank and ingenuous, not very smart.They greeted me pleasantly enough.Why was Scile here?Darius said as he sat.I was aware of Valdik sitting still and not reacting.Scile?I said.He was here again, earlier, Darius said.A Host was here.Being really weird.Your husband, not the Host.He walked around putting little...He fingered the air for the words.Little nuts and bolts on all the tables.Wouldnt tell me why.Again?Here again?He had come once before when I was not there, it seemed, late at night, with three Hosts present.Darius hadnt seen it but Hasser had, and told him.That time Scile had been strangely dressed, in clothes all one colour.Shanita nodded at the anecdote.Scile had, she said, while Valdik said nothing, laid down the same objects that first time, too.Whats that all about?Darius said.I dont know, I said.I spoke carefully.I suspected from his stillness that Valdik had an idea, in fact, as I did, what this might have been.That Scile, by these unnatural attention getting rituals, was trying to stick in the mind.Trying to be good to think with, to be suggestive.To become a simile.What the hell did he think he might mean?I thought, but corrected myself: that wouldnt matter.A CORVID DROPPED us deep in the city, in astonishing rooms, catacombs in skin, alcoves full of houses organs sutured in place.The hall was full of the interplaited cadences of Language.Id never seen so many young, just woken into their third instar and Language.They matched their parents in size and shape, but they were children and you could tell by the colour of their bellies and the way they were given to swaying.They were avid spectators while the liars tried to lie.Most of the competitors could only be silent, failing in their struggle to say something not true.I was with Hasser, Valdik and a few others chosen from among our regulars I dont know how.We were chaperoned by ArnOld.They were there to perform and made it clear that they resented this babysitting duty.Hosts greeted them by their correct name: .Scile was with me.He was talking, tentatively, with my simile companions.It had been a fair time since hed seen Language in its home; it was for him Id asked for this: he knew it, had been shy with gratitude.We were not nearly so close as wed been at the time of our first festival, and I think the present surprised him.I hadnt heard of any more efforts to enLanguage himself.Id said nothing about any of them to him.Before now the humans came.A Host, a lie athlete, one of the Professors, I realised, was speaking.Before the humans came we were...and it stalled.One of its companions continued.Before the humans came we didnt speak so much of certain things.A sensation went through the audience.It was followed by another speaker: Before the humans came we didnt speak so much...Id learnt enough to know this trick, a collaborative faux mendacity: the last was repeating the previous sentence but dropping its voices to near nothing at the final clause.Of certain things was said, but so quietly the audience couldnt hear it.It was showmanship, fakery, a crowd pleaser, and the crowd were pleased.ArnOld stiffened and said together: .Beehive.It was swaying.Its giftwing circled, its fanwing stretched.It stepped up to the lying ground.THERE WERE two main ways the few Ariekei who could lie a little could lie.One was to go slow.They would try to conceive the untrue clausenear impossible, their minds reacting allergically to such a counterfactual even unspoken, conceived without signification.Having prepared it mentally, however successfully or un , they would pretend forget it to themselves.Speak each of its constituent words at a certain speed, at a beat, separated, apart enough in the mind of a speaker that each was a distinct concept, utterable with and as its own meaning; but just sufficiently fast and rhythmic that to listeners, they accreted into a ponderous but comprehensible, and untrue, sentence.The liars I had thus far seen with any success were slow liars.There was another technique.It was the more base and vivid, and by far harder.This was for the speaker to collapse, in their mind, even individual word meanings, and simply to brute utter all necessary sounds.To force out a statement.This was quick lying: the spitting out of a tumble of noises before the untruth of their totality stole a speakers ability to think them.opened its mouths.Before the humans came, it said in ornery staccato, we didnt speak.There was a long quiet.And then a convulsion, a riot.I wished very much that I had any understanding of Ariekene body language.might have been exuding triumph, patience, or nothing.It hadnt whispered the second half of any truth; or trudged sound by metronome sound through a constructed unconstructed sentence.What  had said was unquestionably a lie.The audience reeled.I reeled.THE HOSTS woke in their third instar suddenly fluent, Language a direct function of their consciousness.Millions of years back there must have been some adaptive advantage to knowing that what was communicated was true, Scile said to me, last time wed hypothesised this history.Selection for a mind that could only express that.The evolution of trust...I started to say.Theres no need for trust, this way, he interrupted.Chance, struggle, failure, survival, a Darwinian chaos of instinctive grammar, the drives of a big brained animal in a hard environment, the selection out of traits, had made a race of pure truth tellers.This Language is miraculous, Scile had said.I was somehow repulsed by it, in fact.It was astonishing, given what Language needs to do, that the Ariekei had survived.That, I decided, was what Scile must have meant, so I agreed.If evolution was morality they would be unable to hear lies, too, like two thirds of the fabular monkeys, but its more random and beautiful, so that was only the case for those few who managed to speak them, of their own little untruths.Unbacked by signifieds, the lies of Language were just noises to their own liar.Biologys lazy: if mouths speak truth, why should ears discriminate between it and its opposite?When what was spoken was, definitionally, what was?And by this hole in adaptation, though or because they were not built to say them, the Hosts could understand lies.And either believe thembelief being a meaningless givenor, where the falsity was ostentatious and the point, experience them as some giddying impossible, the said unthinkable.Its me whos monomaniacal, here: its unfair to insinuate that all Hosts cared about was Language, but I cant fail to do so.This is a true story Im telling, but I am telling it, and that entails certain things.So: the Hosts cared about everything, but Language most of all.RADICAL AND cussed,  got that lie out into the world, a vomit of phonemes, against its own mind.The public were rapturous.Wed witnessed a rare performance.I was delighted.Ambassador ArnOld was astonished.Hasser was bemused.Valdik and Scile were aghast.Latterday, 8  KEDIS AND SHUR'ASI were being escorted to the Embassy.The newscasts little vespcams saw them.Midlevel Staff gathered troikas and quads from the Kedis community, a few Shurasi think captains.Vehicles arced over our roofs, antennas and the girders of our construction, over the white smoke from our chimneys.One shot recurred on the bulletins: a young Staff member swatting at the cam through which we saw.He must have been very tense to be so unprofessional.The newscasts, voice and text, were flummoxed.Perhaps to most locals thered been no sense of crisis until this ingathering of our exots.The pods that took them to the Ambassadorial explanations flocked with birds, and fist sized cams that rose and fell among them.Beyond Embassytown, the oddness of angles and movements that had touched the city seemed to be spreading.I BUZZED Ehrsul, RanDolph, Simmon, but could get through to no one.After a hesitation I tried Wyatt, but he didnt answer either.My handset still contained Hassers number, and Valdiks, and several other similes.It had been a long time.I considered calling one.What does it matter now?I thought, but I didnt do it.Im sure I wasnt the only one doing so, but Id begun to prepare, for whatever it was.I was copying what data I thought precious, hiding treasured objects, packing essentials into a shoulder bag.Id always been fascinated at how my body ran things sometimes.While I felt like I was agonising, my limbs did what was needed.Night would come without my noticing, and the aeoli breath was still cool.Then at this crucial change moment I remember there were night bird noises and the gibbering of local animals.It wasnt yet so late there was no traffic.I wasnt tired at all.It was hard to make sense of the shots from Embassytown that I was watching.The newsware was still processing.A human commentator said, Were not sure what...we...were seeing something from the city...ah...movement from...The figures in cam view were Ariekei.The Ariekei were moving.On my screen and through my window, I saw corvids frantic in several directions in the air.I heard things.I was already leaning out of my house and I saw their source.The Hosts were coming out of their city into Embassytown.I RAN TO the interzone between Embassytown and the city.Lights came on as people woke to the noise, but though I was joined by more and more blinking citizens I didnt feel part of anything.I passed under light globes whispering where moths touched them.Below arches Id known all my life, and, tasting the thinning air, I knew I was only a street or two from the edge of the city.I was in Beckon Street, which swept downhill out of our enclave.It was an old part of Embassytown.There were plaster griffins at the edges of the eaves.Not far away, our architecture was overcome, the ivy that tugged it smothered by fronds of fleshmatter and Ariekene business.The biorigging probed plastone and brick in a rill of skin.The Hosts filled the road, jostling each other with odd motion.A single Host had grace but en masse they were a herd, in slow stampede.Id never seen so many.I could hear the slide of their armour, the tap tapping of thousands of their feet.Zelles scuttled.As they came into the human reach the streetlamps and the colours of our displays made them a psychedelia.Rumpled women and men in nightclothes lined the walkways, so the Ariekei entered Embassytown with us either side as if to greet them, as if this were a parade.Cameras darted overhead, little busybodies.There were Hosts in all their sentient stages, from the newly conscious to those about to slip into mindlessness.Hundreds of fanwings fluttered, and I wanted to be above looking down at that, a camouflage of shuddering colours.They passed me, I followed them.Many Terre watching could understand Language, but of course none of us could speak it.Some couldnt restrain asking in Anglo Ubiq: What are you doing?Where are you going?We trailed the Ariekei north, climbing the incline toward the Embassy, on the roadways and verges, crabgrass and our debris.Constables had arrived.They waved their arms as if moving us on, as if they were protecting our aging walls.They said things that had no meaning at all: Come on now!or Move away there!Human children had come to stare.I saw them play Ambassador, dueting nonsense noises and nodding wisely as if the Ariekei were responding.The Hosts took us a coiled route, amassing onlookers, cats and altfoxes bolting before the aliens.We came past the ruins.Several AmbassadorsRanDolph, MagDa, EdGar, I sawemerged from the dark, constables and Staff around them.They shouted greetings, but the Hosts didnt pause or acknowledge them.The Ambassadors said, !Stop.Wait.Stop.Friends, they shouted, tell us what we can do, why are you here?They retreated at the head of the Ariekene crowd, ignored.Someone had turned on the light of a church, as if it were Utuday, and its beam rotated overhead.The Hosts began to speak, to shout, each in their two voices.A cacophony at first, a mix of speech and sounds I think werent speech, and out of that came a chant.Several words I didnt know, and one I did..........THE ARIEKEI spread out before the black stone steps of the Embassy.I walked among them.The Hosts let me in, moving to accommodate me, glancing with eye corals.Their spiky fibrous limbs were a thicket, their unbending flanks like polished plastic.My littleness was hidden, and unobserved I watched the Ambassadors panicking., the Hosts kept saying.The people of Embassytown were saying it as best they could, tooEzRa...An undeliberate chant of the same word in two languages, the name.JoaQuin and MayBel debated in furious whispers.Behind JasMin and ArnOld and MagDa I saw CalVin.They looked stricken.Staff were bickering too, and the constables around them looked close to panic, their carbines and geistguns dangerously at ready.A Host stepped forward., it said: I am.One of those that had greeted EzRa, at the Arrival Ball.Hello,  said.We are here for .Bring .And on.JoaQuin tried to speak, and MayBel, and the Host paid no attention.Others joined in with it, its demand.They came slowly forward, and it was impossible not to have a sense of their bigness, the sway of their shell hard limbs....we have no choice!I heard Joa or Quin, and I thought it was to MayBel but saw with shock that it was to Quin or Joa.The Ambassadors unhuddled, and stepping out from among them, coming forth as if in a conjuring trick, was EzRa.EZ LOOKED anxious; Ra was cardsharp blank.As their colleagues parted for them Ez gave them a look of hatred.At the top of the stairs EzRa looked down at the congregation.The Ariekei spread the tines of their antlers of eyes wide to take in the two men..spoke again.The Language fluent among us meant what it said was quickly communicated.EzRa, it said.Talk.EzRa will speak to us or we will make it speak.You cant do this, someone from Staff or Ambassadorial ranks shouted, and someone else answered, What can we do?EzRa looked at each other and murmured a preparation.Ez sighed; Ras face remained set.Friends, they said.Ez said curish and Ra loahfriends.There was a snap of Ariekei thoraxes and limbs.Friends, we thank you for this visit, EzRa said, and the Ariekei reeled, buffeting me.Friends, we thank you for this greeting, EzRa said, and the ecstasy went on.Ra continued to mutter occasionally but Ez had gone silent, so Language decomposed.The Hosts hubbubbed.Some flailed their giftwings and wrapped themselves within them, some entwined them with others.shouted speak and  spoke again.They said pleasantries, emptinesses, polite variants of Hello, hello.The Ariekei concentrated, as if asleep or digesting.Around the plaza I saw hundreds of Embassytowners, and soundless hovering cams.You stupid, stupid bastards, someone said on the Embassy steps.The words were as ignored as the ivy.Everyone was looking at the Hosts.They were coming back from whatever it was that had happened to them.Good, said one.It wasnt .Good.It turned.did so too.The Ariekei all turned back the way they had come.Wait!Wait!It was MagDa.Pharos!We have to...One of them gestured to Ez and Ra: Dont speak again.MagDa conferred and shouted in Language.We must speak, they said.Whether out of pity, courtesy, curiosity or whatever,  and other leaders, if thats what they were, of the gathering craned their eye corals, twisted them backwards, looking behind them.I heard someone say, Put it down, Officer.Christ, man...We have much to discuss, MagDa said.Please join us.May we ask you to enter?Constables and SecStaff came through the crowd.Go.One stood before me.She held a stubby gun.She spoke to me rapidly, the same spiel she was giving everyone.Please clear the streets.Were trying to bring this under control.Please.Like everyone else, I obeyed my orders slowly.The Ariekei had arrived in strange coherence.Now most of them straggled away at random, leaving their scent and unique marks in the dirt.An urgent faced boy in a constables uniform whispered to me to please fuck off right now, and I sped up a little.The Ambassadors were trying to usher a few Hosts, those which had hesitated, into the Embassy.They didnt seem to be succeeding.Part Three  LIKE AS NOT    Formerly, 7  AFTER THE FESTIVAL, Scile disappeared.He wouldnt answer my buzzes, or did so only with terse comments and promises to return.Wherever he was he might be blanking me, but he had conferred, I suspected, with unlikely people.I was with Valdik and Shanita a day after the festival when Valdik was buzzed; when hed answered he shut up and glanced at me with wide open eyes.I had been abruptly sure that Scile was on the line.After a couple of days my husband came back to our rooms and we had the fight that had been simmering for a long time.As with most such, the specifics are uninteresting and largely beside the point.He was surly, and pissy, and made little quips about how I passed my time, barbs at least as anxious as they were nasty, not that I was in the mood to care about that.Id had enough of his recent predilection for gnomic pronouncements, and his bad temper.Who do you think arranged that trip, Scile?I shouted.He wouldnt answer or look at me, and I didnt put my hand on my hips or gesticulate, I folded my arms and leaned back and stared down my face at him like I had the first time Id met him.Some people might think thanks were in order, not days of this sulky shit.What makes you think you can behave like this?Where did you fucking go?He made some reference that made it clear he had been with Ambassadors.I stopped at that, halfway through a riposte.What in immer?I remember thinking.Who buggers off to high level meetings when theyre having a hissy fit?Listen, Scile said.I could see him deciding something, trying hard to calm our altercation.Listen, will you please listen.He waved a paper.I know what its trying to do.Surl Tesh echer.It practises, and it preaches, to its coterie.This is what its been saying.He didnt say how hed got the transcript.You, similes...he said.The Hosts arent like us, okay: its not exactly most of us whod get excited to meet a. ..an adjectival phrase or a past participle or whatever.But its no surprise some of them would want to meet a simile.You help them think.Someone with reverence for Language would love that.But whod want to lie?A punk, is who.Avice, listen.There are fans, and there are liars.And only Surl Tesh echer and its friends are both.He smoothed out the paper.Are you ready to listen to me?You think Ive just been sitting in a cupboard for the good of my health?This is what its been saying.BEFORE THE HUMANS came we didnt speak so much of certain things.Before the humans came we didnt speak so much.Before the humans came we didnt speak.He glanced at me.We didnt walk on our wings.We didnt walk.We didnt swallow earth.We didnt swallow.Scile was reading nervously, quickly.Theres a Terre who swims with fishes, one who wore no clothes, one who ate what was given her, one who walks backwards.Theres a rock that was broken and cemented together.I differ with myself then agree, like the rock that was broken and cemented together.I change my opinion.Im like the rock that was broken and cemented together.I wasnt not like the rock that was broken and cemented together.I do what I always do, Im like the Terre who swims with fishes.Im not unlike that Terre.Im very like it.Im not water.Im not water.Im water.No translations Id ever seen of Host pronouncements were properly comprehensible, but this read different.I realised a counter intuitive affinity.For all its strangeness it sounded a little, a tiny bit, more like, less unlike Anglo Ubiq than most Language did.It didnt have the usual precise and nuanced exactnesses.Its not like most competitors, trying to force out a lie, Scile said.Its more systematic.Its training itself into untruth.Its using these weird constructions so it can say something true, then interrupt itself, to lie.It didnt perform most of these, I said.Its been practising, he said.Weve always known the Hosts need you, right?You and the rest of you.Like the split rock, like they need those two poor cats they stitched into a bag.They need similes to say certain things, right?To think them.They need to make them in the world, so they can make the comparison.Yes.But...I looked at the paper.I read over it.was teaching itself to lie.Im like the rock that was broken,  Scile said, then not not it.It cant quite do it, but its trying to go from Im like the rock to I am the rock.See?Same comparative term, but different.Not a comparison anymore.He showed me old books in hard or virtua: Leezenberg, Lakoff, u senHe, Ricoeur.I was used to his odd fascinations, theyd helped charm me ages ago.Now they and he made me uneasy.A simile, he said, is true because you say so.Its a persuasion: this is like that.Thats not enough for it anymore.Similes arent enough.He stared.It wants to make you a kind of lie.To change everything.Simile spells an argument out: its ongoing, explicit, truth making.You dont need...logos, they used to call it.Judgement.You dont need to...to link incommensurables.Unlike if you claim: This is that.When it patently is not.Thats what we do.Thats what we call reason, that exchange, metaphor.That lying.The world becomes a lie.Thats what Surl Teshecher wants.To bring in a lie.He spoke very calmly.It wants to usher in evil.Im worried about Scile, I said to Ehrsul.Avice, she said to me at last, after Id tried to explain to her.Im sorry but Im not sure what youre saying to me.She did listen: I dont want to give the impression that all she did was tell me not to tell her.Ehrsul listened but Im not sure to what.I was hardly exact, I couldnt be.IM WORRIED about Scile, I said to CalVin.I tried them instead.Hes gone a bit religious.Pharotekton?one of them said.No.Not church.But...Id gleaned more scraps of Sciles emergent theology.I call it that though he was adamant it had nothing to do with God.He wants to protect the Ariekei.From changing Language.I told CalVin about the temptation, what Scile thought  planned.He thinks a lots at stake, I said.I still love this man and Im afraid of whats happening, I was saying.Can you help me?I dont understand why hes doing what hes doing, whats making him afraid, how hes able to make it even get to me.Something like that.Let me talk to him, CalVin said.The one who hadnt spoken looked with raised eyebrows at his doppel, then smiled and looked back at me.Formerly, 8  CALVIN, as theyd promised me, spent time with Scile.My husbands research was intense, antisocial, his memos to himself were everywhere and mostly not comprehensible, his files scattered across our datspace.The truth is I was a little scared.I didnt know how to react to what I saw in Scile now.The fervour had always been there, but though he tried to disguise itafter that one conversation he didnt talk about his anxieties to meI could see it was growing stronger.That he tried to hide it confused me.I wondered if he thought his concerns were the only appropriate ones to the shifts in some Hosts practice, and if the lack of such anxiety from the rest of us was devastating.If he thought the whole world mad, forcing him into dissimulation.I went through those of his thesis notes, appointment diaries, textbook annotations I could access, as if looking for a master code.It gave me a better sense, if still partial and confused, of his theories.What do you think?I asked CalVin.They looked put out by my uncharacteristic pleading.They told me there was no question that Scile was looking at things in an unusual way, and that his focus was, yes, rather intense.But overall, not to worry.What a useless injunction.To MY SURPRISE Scile started coming to The Cravat with me.Id thought we would do less, not more, in each others company.I didnt tell him I knew hed been previously, on his own.I saw no evidence of more efforts to persuade the Hosts to speak him.Instead, he began to exercise a subtle pull on some of the similes.He took part in the discussions, would imply certain of his theories, especially those according to which similes represented the pinnacle and limit of Language.Communication making truth.Slightly to my surprise, no one made him, unsimile outsider, other than welcome.The opposite, really.Valdik wasnt alone in listening.Valdik wasnt an intelligent man and I was worried for him.I mustnt exaggerate.I think Scile seemed himself, only perhaps more focused than previously, more distracted.I no longer thought we could stay together, but I wanted to know that he was alright.These were in other ways not bad times for me.We were between reliefs.It was always deep in those days that Embassytown became most vividly itself, neither waiting for something, nor celebrating something that had happened.We called these times the doldrums.Of course we knew the more conventional use of the term, but like a few other uncanny words, for us it meant itself and its own opposite.During those still, drab days, cut off on our immer outskirt, without contact, a long time after and before any miabs, we turned inwards.Fiestas and spectaculars, on the spareday at the end of each of our long months, our crooked alleys interwoven with ribbons and full of music.Children would dance wearing trid costumes, their integuments of light overlapping and crystalline.There were parties.Some formal; many not; some costume; a few naked.This doldrums culture was part of our economy.After a visit, we had luxuries and new technology to invigorate our markets and production: when one was due there was a rash of spending and innovation, out of excitement and the knowledge that our commodities would soon change, that new season goods would be in expensive vogue.Between, in the doldrums, things were static, not desperate but pinched, and these fetes were punctuations, and meant small runs on certain indulgences.One night I was in bed with CalVin.One of them was asleep.The other was stroking my flank, whispering conversation.It was a rare thing, to be with one doppel only.I felt a strong urge to ask his name.I think now I know which it was.I was running my finger over the back of his neck, the link in him, beautifully rendered in the hollow below his skulls overhang.I looked at its twin, on the sleeping half of the Ambassador.Should I be worried about Scile?I said.The sleeper shifted and we were still a second.I dont think so, my companion whispered.Hes onto something, you know.I didnt understand.Im not worried that hes wrong, I said.Im worried that hes...that...But hes not wrong.Or at leasthes pointing out something.I sat up.Are you saying?I stood and paced, and the sleeping doppel woke and looked at me mildly.Cal and Vin conferred in whispers, and it didnt sound like simple agreement.What are you saying?I said.There are some persuasive elements to what he says.It was the newly woken doppel who spoke.I cant believe youre telling me  Im not.Im not telling you anything.He spoke impassively.His doppel looked at him and then at me, uneasily.You asked us to keep a watch on him, and we are, and we have.And were looking into some of the things hes saying.An eccentric he may be, but Sciles not stupid, and theres no question that this Host...He looked at his doppel and together they said, .The half of CalVin who had been talking continued: ...is definitely pursuing some odd strategies.I stood naked at the edge of the bed and watched them: one lying back and looking up at me, the other with his knees drawn.I ADMIT DEFEAT.Ive been trying to present these events with a structure.I simply dont know how everything happened.Perhaps because I didnt pay proper attention, perhaps because it wasnt a narrative, but for whatever reasons, it doesnt want to be what I want to make it.IN THE STREETS OF Embassytown, a congregation was forming.Valdik appeared to be at its centre.It was Valdik who expounded the theories, now.My husband was a canny man, even in his obsessions.Valdik Drumans at the centre of it now?CalVin said.Valdik?Really?I know it sounds unlikely...I said.Well, hes an adult, hes making his own choices.Its not that simple.I knew CalVin were right and wrong at the same time.Most Embassytowners did not know or care about any of these debates.Of those who did, most would consider them pretty unimportant, secureand there was security in itin the certainty that Hosts could not lie, whatever a few agitated similes insisted.For those who knew about the festivals, a few Hosts determined to push at the boundaries of Language was too obscure a phenomenon to be any kind of problem, let alone a moral one.That left only a tiny number of Embassytowners, disproportionately the credulous.But their number was growing.Valdik speechified at The Cravat on the nature of the similes and the role of Language.His arguments were confused but passionate and affecting.Theres nothing like this anywhere, Valdik said.No other language anywhere in the universe.Where whats said is truth.Can you imagine what it would be to lose that?It isnt fair what youre doing to Valdik, I told Scile, on one of his rare visits to what had been our home.Hes not a fucking child, Avice, Scile said.He was collecting clothes and notes.He did not look at me as he rummaged.He decides what he wants.WALKING NEAR the ruins I was handed a flyer on cheap nantech paper that flashed a trid as I unfolded it.It made me start: it was Valdiks face, apple sized, in my hand.DRUMAN, it said, ON THE BATTLE AGAINST THE LIE.A time and place, not The Cravat but a little hall.With it brought to my attention, I noticed details of that and similar meetings guerrilla coded into wallscreens, hacked nuisance trids.I went.Id thought Id find Scile, but no.I stayed at the back of the room.Valdik wore a projector, and trids of him appeared throughout the temple, random and staticky.At the front of the room I saw Shanita, Darius, Hasser and other similes and tropes.Valdik preached.He was still a middling speaker.I dont know how this mediocrity amassed a followingsomething about the doldrums.He expounded religiose foolishnesstwo voices but one truth, because what is the truth but dual, bifurcated, not in conflict but two forms of one truth and so forth.The place wasnt a quarter full.It contained indulgent friends, the curious, refugees from other cults.A convocation of the hopeless and bored.When I got home, Scile was speaking down the line.He smiled an unconvincing greeting at me as I came in, turned so that I couldnt hear him nor see his mouth move.I wondered whether, if Valdik were removed from this self appointed office, with what I was convinced was Sciles instrument confiscated, his mania would dissipate.What should we do?CalVin said.These meetings arent illegal.You can do anything you want.Well...We could have Druman taken for Administrative Detention......but do you really want that?Yes!I said, but of course I didnt, and of course they wouldnt do it.Listen, they said.Dont worry.Well watch Scile.Well keep him safe.That they did, though neither in the way, nor from what, Id assumed.Formerly, 9  SOMEONE RELEASED a viral ware into the vagrant automa of Embassytown that gave them Valdiks mania.It made them preachers in his new church.
