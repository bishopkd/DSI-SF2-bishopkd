Much involved distributing handbills and such.No subversive literature was ever in her shop, nor our home, nor that hotel room; distribution was done by kids, too young to read.Sidris was also working a full day bending hair and such.About time she began to have too much to do I happened one evening to make walk about on Causeway with Sidris on my arm when I caught sight of a familiar face and figure  skinny little girl, all angles, carrot red hair.She was possibly twelve, at stage when a fem shoots up just before blossoming out into rounded softness.I knew her but could not say why or when or where.I said, "Psst, doll baby.Eyeball young fem ahead.Orange hair, no cushions. "Sidris looked her over."Darling, I knew you were eccentric.But she's still a boy. ""Damp it.Who?""Bog knows.Shall I sprag her?"Suddenly I remembered like video coming on.And wished Wyoh were with me but Wyoh and I were never together in public.This skinny redhead had been at meeting where Shorty was killed.She sat on floor against wall down front and listened with wide eyed seriousness and applauded fiercely.Then I had seen her at end in free trajectory  curled into ball in air and had hit a yellow jacket in knees, he whose jaw I broke a moment later.Wyoh and I were alive and free because this kid moved fast in a crisis."No, don't speak to her," I told Sidris."But I want to keep her in sight.Wish we had one of your Irregulars here.Damn. ""Drop off and phone Wyoh, you'll have one in five minutes," my wife said.I did.Then Sidris and I strolled, looking in shopwindows and moving slowly, as quarry was window shopping.In seven or eight minutes a small boy came toward us, stopped and said, "Hello, Auntie Mabell.Hi, Uncle Joe. "Sidris took his hand."Hi, Tony.How's your mother, dear?""Just fine. "He added in a whisper, "I'm Jock. ""Sorry. "Sidris said quietly to me, "Stay on her," and took Jock into a tuck shop.She came out and joined me.Jock followed her licking a lollipop."'Bye, Auntie Mabel!Thanks!"He danced away, rotating, wound up by that little redhead, stood and stared into a display, solemnly sucking his sweet.Sidris and I went home.A report was waiting."She went into Cradle Roll Creche and hasn't come out.Do we stay on it?""A bit yet," I told Wyoh, and asked if she remembered this kid.She did, but had no idea who she might be."You could ask Finn. ""Can do better. "I called Mike.Yes, Cradle Roll Creche had a phone and Mike would listen.Took him twenty minutes to pick up enough to give analysis  many young voices and at such ages almost sexless.But presently he told me, "Man, I hear three voices that could match the age and physical type you described.However, two answer to names which I assume to be masculine.The third answers when anyone says 'Hazel'  which an older female voice does repeatedly.She seems to be Hazel's boss. ""Mike, look at old organization file.Check Hazels. ""Four Hazels," he answered at once, "and here she is: Hazel Meade, Young Comrades Auxiliary, address Cradle Roll Creche, born 25 December 2063, mass thirty nine kilos, height  "  "That's our little jump jet!Thanks, Mike.Wyoh, call off stake out.Good job!""Mike, call Donna and pass the word, that's a dear. "I left it to girls to recruit Hazel Meade and did not eyeball her until Sidris moved her into our household two weeks later.But Wyoh volunteered a report before then; policy was involved.Sidris had filled her cell but wanted Hazel Meade.Besides this irregularity, Sidris was doubtful about recruiting a child.Policy was adults only, sixteen and up.I took it to Adam Selene and executive cell."As I see," I said, "this cells of three system is to serve us, not bind us.See nothing wrong in Comrade Cecilia having an extra.Nor any real danger to security. ""I agree," said Prof."But I suggest that the extra member not be part of Cecilia's cell  she should not know the others, I mean, unless the duties Cecilia gives her make it necessary.Nor do I think she should recruit, at her age.The real question is her age. ""Agreed," said Wyoh."I want to talk about this kid's age. ""Friends," Mike said diffidently (diffidently first time in weeks; he was now that confident executive "Adam Selene" much more than lonely machine)  "perhaps I should have told you, but I have already granted similar variations.It did not seem to require discussion. ""It doesn't, Mike," Prof reassured him."A chairman must use his own judgment.What is our largest cell?""Five.it is a double cell, three and two. ""No harm done.Dear Wyoh, does Sidris propose to make this child a full comrade?Let her know that we are committed to revolution...with all the bloodshed, disorder, and possible disaster that entails?""That's exactly what she is requesting. ""But, dear lady, while we are staking our lives, we are old enough to know it.For that, one should have an emotional grasp of death.Children seldom are able to realize that death will come to them personally.One might define adulthood as the age at which a person learns that he must die...and accepts his sentence undismayed. ""Prof," I said, "I know some mighty tall children.Seven to two some are in Party. ""No bet, cobber.It'll give odds that at least half of them don't qualify  and we may find it out the hard way at the end of this our folly. ""Prof," Wyoh insisted."Mike, Mannie.Sidris is certain this child is an adult.And I think so, too. ""Man?"asked Mike."Let's find way for Prof to meet her and form own opinion.I was taken by her.Especially her go to hell fighting.Or would never have started it. "We adjourned and I heard no more.Hazel showed up at dinner shortly thereafter as Sidris' guest.She showed no sign of recognizing me, nor did I admit that I had ever seen her  but learned long after that she had recognized me, not just by left arm but because I had been hatted and kissed by tall blonde from Hong Kong.Furthermore Hazel had seen through Wyoming's disguise, recognized what Wyoh never did successfully disguise: her voice.But Hazel used lip glue.If she ever assumed I was in conspiracy she never showed it.Child's history explained her, far as background can explain steely character.Transported with parents as a baby much as Wyoh had been, she had lost father through accident while he was convict labor, which her mother blamed on indifference of Authority to safety of penal colonists.Her mother lasted till Hazel was five; what she died from Hazel did not know; she was then living in creche where we found her.Nor did she know why parents had been shipped  possibly for subversion if they were both under sentence as Hazel thought.As may be, her mother left her a fierce hatred of Authority and Warden.Family that ran Cradle Roll let her stay; Hazel was pinning diapers and washing dishes as soon as she could reach.She had taught herself to read, and could print letters but could not write.Her knowledge of math was only that ability to count money that children soak up through their skins.Was fuss over her leaving creche; owner and husbands claimed Hazel owed several years' service.Hazel solved it by walking out, leaving her clothes and fewer belongings behind.Mum was angry enough to want family to start trouble which could wind up in "brawling" she despised.But I told her privately that, as her cell leader, I did nor want our family in public eye  and hauled out cash and told her Party would pay for clothes for Hazel.Mum refused money, called off a family meeting, took Hazel into town and was extravagant  for Mum  in re outfitting her.So we adopted Hazel.I understand that these days adopting a child involves red tape; in those days it was as simple as adopting a kitten.Was more fuss when Mum started to place Hazel in school, which fitted neither what Sidris had in mind nor what Hazel had been led to expect as a Party member and comrade.Again I butted in and Mum gave in part way.Hazel was placed in a tutoring school close to Sidris' shop  that is, near easement lock thirteen; beauty parlor was by it (Sidris had good business because close enough that our water was piped in, and used without limit as return line took it back for salvage).Hazel studied mornings and helped in afternoons, pinning on gowns, handing out towels, giving rinses, learning trade  and whatever else Sidris wanted."Whatever else" was captain of Baker Street Irregulars.Hazel had handled younger kids all her short life.They liked her; she could wheedle them into anything; she understood what they said when an adult would find it gibberish.She was a perfect bridge between Party and most junior auxiliary.She could make a game of chores we assigned and persuade them to play by rules she gave them, and never let them know it was adult serious    but child serious, which is another matter.For example:  Let's say a little one, too young to read, is caught with a stack of subversive literature  which happened more than once.Here's how it would go, after Hazel indoctrinated a kid:  ADULT:            "Baby, where did you get this?"BAKER STREET IRREGULAR: "I'm not a baby, I'm a big boy!"ADULT:            "Okay, big boy, where did you get this?"B. S. I. :            "Jackie give it to me. "ADULT:            "Who is Jackie?"B. S. I. :            "Jackie. "ADULT:            "But what's his last name?"B. S. I. :            "Who?"ADULT:            "Jackie. "B. S. I. :            (scornfully) "Jackie's a girl!"ADULT:            "All right, where does she live?"B. S. L:            "Who?"And so on around   To all questions key answer was of pattern: "Jackie give it to me. "Since Jackie didn't exist, he (she) didn't have a last name, a home address, nor fixed sex.Those children enjoyed making fools of adults, once they learned how easy it was.At worst, literature was confiscated.Even a squad of Peace Dragoons thought twice before trying to "arrest" a small child.Yes, we were beginning to have squads of Dragoons inside Luna city, but never less than a squad  some had gone in singly and not come back.When Mike started writing poetry I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.He wanted to publish it!Shows how thoroughly humanity had corrupted this innocent machine that he should wish to see his name in print.I said, "Mike, for Bog's sake!Blown all circuits?Or planning to give us away?"Before he could sulk Prof said, "Hold on, Manuel; I see possibilities.Mike, would it suit you to take a pen name?"That's how "Simon Jester" was born.Mike picked it apparently by tossing random numbers.But he used another name for serious verse, his Party name, Adam Selene."Simon's" verse was doggerel, bawdy, subversive, ranging from poking fun at vips to savage attacks on Warden, system, Peace Dragoons, finks.You found it on walls of public W. C. s, or on scraps of paper left in tube capsules: Or in taprooms.Wherever they were they were signed "Simon Jester" and with a matchstick drawing of a little horned devil with big grin and forked tail.Sometimes he was stabbing a fat man with a pitchfork.Sometimes just his face would appear, big grin and horns, until shortly even horns and grin meant "Simon was here. "Simon appeared all over Luna same day and from then on never let up.Shortly he started receiving volunteer help; his verses and little pictures, so simple anybody could draw them, began appearing more places than we had planned.This wider coverage had to be from fellow travelers.Verses and cartoons started appearing inside Complex  which could not have been our work; we never recruited civil servants.Also, three days after initial appearance of a very rough limerick, one that implied that Warden's fatness derived from unsavory habits, this limerick popped up on pressure sticky labels with cartoon improved so that fat victim flinching from Simon's pitchfork was recognizably Mort the Wart.We didn't buy them, we didn't print them.But they appeared in L City and Novylen and Hong Kong, stuck almost everywhere  public phones, stanchions in corridors, pressure locks, ramp railings, other.I had a sample count made, fed it to Mike; he reported that over seventy thousand labels had been used in L City alone.I did not know of a printing plant in L City willing to risk such a job and equipped for it.Began to wonder if might be another revolutionary cabal?Simon's verses were such a success that he branched out as a poltergeist and neither Warden nor security chief was allowed to miss it."Dear Mort the Wart," ran one letter."Do please be careful from midnight to four hundred tomorrow.Love & Kisses, Simon"  with horns and grin.In same mail Alvarez received one reading: "Dear Pimplehead, If the Warden breaks his leg tomorrow night it will be your fault.Faithfully your conscience, Simon"  again with horns and smile.We didn't have anything planned; we just wanted Mort and Alvarez to lose sleep  which they did, plus bodyguard.All Mike did was to call Warden's private phone at intervals from midnight to four hundred  an unlisted number supposedly known only to his personal staff.By calling members of his personal staff simultaneously and connecting them to Mort Mike not only created confusion but got Warden angry at his assistants  he flatly refused to believe their denials.But was luck that Warden, goaded too far, ran down a ramp.Even a new chum does that only once.So he walked on air and sprained an ankle  close enough to a broken leg and Alvarez was there when it happened.Those sleep losers were mostly just that.Like rumor that Authority catapult had been mined and would be blown up, another night.Ninety plus eighteen men can't search a hundred kilometers of catapult in hours, especially when ninety are Peace Dragoons not used to p suit work and hating it  this midnight came at new earth with Sun high; they were outside far longer than is healthy, managed to cook up their own accidents while almost cooking themselves, and showed nearest thing to mutiny in regiment's history.One accident was fatal.Did he fall or was he pushed?A sergeant.Midnight alarums made Peace Dragoons on passport watch much taken by yawning and more bad tempered, which produced more clashes with Loonies and still greater resentment both ways  so Simon increased pressure.Adam Selene's verse was on a higher plane.Mike submitted it to Prof and accepted his literary judgment (good, I think) without resentment.Mike's scansion and rhyming were perfect, Mike being a computer with whole English language in his memory and able to search for a fitting word in microseconds.What was weak was self criticism.That improved rapidly under Prof's stern editorship.Adam Selene's by line appeared first in dignified pages of Moonglow over a somber poem titled: "Home. "Was dying thoughts of old transportee, his discovery as he is about to leave that Luna is his beloved home.Language was simple, rhyme scheme unforced, only thing faintly subversive was conclusion on part of dying man that even many wardens he has endured was not too high a price.Doubt if Moonglow's editors thought twice.Was good stuff, they published.Alvarez turned editorial office inside out trying to get a line back to Adam Selene.Issue had been on sale half a lunar before Alvarez noticed it, or had it called to his attention; we were fretted, we wanted that by line noticed.We were much pleased with way Alvarez oscillated when he did see it.Editors were unable to help fink boss.They told him truth: Poem had come in by mail.Did they have it?Yes, surely...sorry, no envelope; they were never saved.After a long time Alvarez left, flanked by four Dragoons he had fetched along for his health.Hope he enjoyed studying that sheet of paper.Was piece of Adam Selene's business stationery:   SELENE ASSOCIATES  LUNA CITY  Investments                                                      Office of the Chairman  Old Dome     and under that was typed Home, by Adam Selene, etc.Any fingerprints were added after it left us.Had been typed on Underwood Office Electrostator, commonest model in Luna.Even so, were not too many as are importado; a scientific detective could have identified machine.Would have found it in Luna City office of Lunar Authority.Machines, should say, as we found six of model in office and used them in rotation, five words and move to next.Cost Wyoh and self sleep and too much risk even though Mike listened at every phone, ready to warn.Never did it that way again.Alvarez was not a scientific detective.11   In early '76 I had too much to do.Could not neglect customers.Party work took more time even though all possible was delegated.But decisions had to be made on endless things and messages passed up and down.Had to squeeze in hours of heavy exercise, wearing weights, and dasn't arrange permission to use centrifuge at Complex, one used by earthworm scientists to stretch time in Luna  while had used it before, this time could not advertise that I was getting in shape for Earthside.Exercising without centrifuge is less efficient and was especially boring because did not know there would be need for it.But according to Mike 30 percent of ways events could fall required some Loonie, able to speak for Party, to make trip to Terra.Could not see myself as an ambassador, don't have education and not diplomatic.Prof was obvious choice of those recruited or likely to be.But Prof was old, might not live to land Earthside.Mike told us that a man of Prof's age, body type, etc., had less than 40 percent chance of reaching Terra alive.But Prof did gaily undertake strenuous training to let him make most of his poor chances, so what could I do but put on weights and get to work, ready to go and take his place if old heart clicked off?Wyoh did same, on assumption that something might keep me from going.She did it to share misery; Wyoh always used gallantry in place of logic.On top of business, Party work, and exercise was farming.We had lost three sons by marriage while gaining two fine lads, Frank and Ali.Then Greg went to work for LuNoHoCo, as boss drillman on new catapult.Was needful.Much skull sweat went into hiring construction crew.We could use non Party men for most jobs, but key spots had to be Party men as competent as they were politically reliable.Greg did not want to go; our farm needed him and he did not like to leave his congregation.But accepted.That made me again a valet, part time, to pigs and chickens.Hans is a good farmer, picked up load and worked enough for two men.But Greg had been farm manager ever since Grandpaw retired, new responsibility worried Hans.Should have been mine, being senior, but Hans was better farmer and closer to it; always been expected he would succeed Greg someday.So I backed him up by agreeing with his opinions and tried to be half a farm hand in hours I could squeeze.Left no time to scratch.Late in February I was returning from long trip, Novylen, Tycho Under, Churchill.New tube had just been completed across Sinus Medii, so I went on to Hong Kong in Luna  business and did make contacts now that I could promise emergency service.Fact that Endsville Beluthihatchie bus ran only during dark semi lunar had made impossible before.But business was cover for politics; liaison with Hong Kong had been thin.Wyoh had done well by phone; second member of her cell was an old comrade."Comrade Clayton"  who not only had clean bill of health in Alverez's File Zebra but also stood high in Wyoh's estimation.Clayton was briefed on policies, warned of bad apples, encouraged to start cell system while leaving old organization untouched.Wyoh told him to keep his membership, as before.But phone isn't face to face.Hong Kong should have been our stronghold.Was less tied to Authority as its utilities were not controlled from Complex; was less dependent because lack (until recently) of tube transport had made selling at catapult head less inviting; was stronger financially as Bank of Hong Kong Luna notes were better money than official Authority scrip.I suppose Hong Kong dollars weren't "money" in some legal sense.Authority would not accept them; times I went Earthside had to buy Authority scrip to pay for ticket.But what I carried was Hong Kong dollars as could be traded Earthside at a small discount whereas scrip was nearly worthless there.Money or not, Hong Kong Bank notes were backed by honest Chinee bankers instead of being fiat of bureaucracy.One hundred Hong Kong dollars was 31.1 grams of gold (old troy ounce) payable on demand at home office  and they did keep gold there, fetched up from Australia.Or you could demand commodities: non potable water, steel of defined grade, heavy water of power plant specs, other things.Could buy these with scrip, too, but Authority's prices kept changing, upward.I'm no fiscal theorist; time Mike tried to explain I got headache.Simply know we were glad to lay hands on this non money whereas scrip one accepted reluctantly and not just because we hated Authority.Hong Kong should have been Party's stronghold.But was not.We had decided that I should risk face to face there, letting some know my identity, as a man with one arm can't disguise easily.Was risk that would jeopardize not only me but could lead to Wyoh, Mum, Greg, and Sidris if I took a fall.But who said revolution was safe?Comrade Clayton turned out to be young Japanese  not too young, but they all look young till suddenly look old.He was not all Japanese  Malay and other things  but had Japanese name and household had Japanese manners; "giri" and "gimu" controlled and it was my good fortune that he owed much gimu to Wyoh.Clayton was not convict ancestry; his people had been "volunteers" marched aboard ship at gunpoint during time Great China consolidated Earthside empire.I didn't hold it against him; he hated Warden as bitterly as any old lag.Met him first at a teahouse  taproom to us L City types  and for two hours we talked everything but politics.He made up mind about me, took me home.My only complaint about Japanese hospitality is those chin high baths are too bleeding hot.But turned out I was not jeopardized.Mama san was as skilled at makeup as Sidris, my social arm is very convincing, and a kimona covered its seam.Met four cells in two days, as "Comrade Bork" and wearing makeup and kimona and tabi and, if a spy was among them, don't think he could identify Manuel O'Kelly.I had gone there intensely briefed, endless figures and projections, and talked about just one thing: famine in '82, six years away."You people are lucky, won't be hit so soon.But now with new tube, you are going to see more and more of your people turning to wheat and rice and shipping it to catapult head.Your time will come. "They were impressed.Old organization, as I saw it and from what I heard, relied on oratory, whoop it up music, and emotion, much like church.I simply said, "There it is, comrades.Check those figures; I'll leave them with you. "Met one comrade separately.A Chinee engineer given a good look at anything can figure way to make it.Asked this one if he had ever seen a laser gun small enough to carry like a rifle.He had not.Mentioned that passport system made it difficult to smuggle these days.He said thoughtfully that jewels ought not to be hard  and he would be in Luna City next week to see his cousin.I said Uncle Adam would be pleased to hear from him.All in all was productive trip.On way back I stopped in Novylen to check an old fashioned punched tape "Foreman" I had overhauled earlier, had lunch afterwards, ran into my father.He and I were friendly but didn't matter if we let a couple of years go by.We talked through a sandwich and beer and as I got up he said, "Nice to see you, Mannie.Free Luna!"I echoed, too startled not to.My old man was as cynically non political as you could find; if he would say that in public, campaign must be taking hold.So I arrived in L City cheered up and not too tired, having napped from Torricelli.Took Belt from Tube South, then dropped down and through Bottom Alley, avoiding Causeway crowd and heading home.Went into Judge Brody's courtroom as I came to it, meaning to say hello.Brody is old friend and we have amputation in common.After he lost a leg he set up as a judge and was quite successful; was not another judge in L City at that time who did not have side business, at least make book or sell insurance.If two people brought a quarrel to Brody and he could not get them to agree that his settlement was just, he would return fees and, if they fought, referee their duel without charging  and still be trying to persuade them not to use knives right up to squaring off.He wasn't in his courtroom though plug hat was on desk.Started to leave, only to be checked by group coming in, stilyagi types.A girl was with them, and an older man hustled by them.He was mussed, and clothing had that vague something that says "tourist. "We used to get tourists even then.Not hordes but quite a few.They would come up from Earth, stop in a hotel for a week, go back in same ship or perhaps stop over for next ship.Most of them spent their time gambling after a day or two of sightseeing including that silly walk up on surface every tourist makes.Most Loonies ignored them and granted them their foibles.One lad, oldest, about eighteen and leader, said to me, "Where's judge?""Don't know.Not here. "He chewed lip, looked baffled.I said, "What trouble?"He said soberly, "Going to eliminate his choom.But want judge to confirm it. "I said, "Cover taprooms here around.Probably find him. "A boy about fourteen spoke up."Say!Aren't you Gospodin O'Kelly?""Right. ""Why don't you judge it. "Oldest looked relieved."Will you, Gospodin?"I hesitated.Sure, I've gone judge at times; who hasn't?But don't hanker for responsibility.However, it troubled me to hear young people talk about eliminating a tourist.Bound to cause talk.Decided to do it.So I said to tourist, "Will you accept me as your judge?"He looked surprised."I have choice in the matter?"I said patiently, "Of course.Can't expect me to listen if you aren't willing to accept my judging.But not urging you.Your life, not mine. "He looked very surprised but not afraid.His eyes lit up."My life, did you say?""Apparently.You heard lads say they intend to eliminate you.You may prefer to wait for Judge Brody. "He didn't hesitate.Smiled and said, "I accept you as my judge, sir. ""As you wish. "I looked at oldest lad."What parties to quarrel?Just you and your young friend?""Oh, no, Judge, all of us. ""Not your judge yet. "I looked around."Do you all ask me to judge?"Were nods; none said No.Leader turned to girl, added, "Better speak up, Tish.You accept Judge O'Kelly?""What?Oh, sure!"She was a vapid little thing, vacantly pretty, curvy, perhaps fourteen.Slot machine type, and how she might wind up.Sort who prefers being queen over pack of stilyagi to solid marriage.I don't blame stilyagi; they chase around corridors because not enough females.Work all day and nothing to go home to at night."Okay, court has been accepted and all are bound to abide by my verdict.Let's settle fees.How high can you boys go?Please understand I'm not going to judge an elimination for dimes.So ante up or I turn him loose. "Leader blinked, they went into huddle.Shortly he turned and said, "We don't have much.Will you do it for five Kong dollars apiece?"Six of them  "No.Ought not to ask a court to judge elimination at that price. "They huddled again."Fifty dollars, Judge?""Sixty.Ten each.And another ten from you, Tish," I said to girl.She looked surprised, indignant."Come, come!"I said."Tanstaafl. "She blinked and reached into pouch.She had money; types like that always have.I collected seventy dollars, laid it on desk, and said to tourist, "Can match it?""Beg pardon?""Kids are paying seventy dollars Hong Kong for judgment.You should match it.If you can't, open pouch and prove it and can owe it to me.But that's your share. "I added, "Cheap, for a capital case.But kids can't pay much so you get a bargain. ""I see.I believe I see. "He matched with seventy Hong Kong."Thank you," I said."Now does either side want a jury?"Girl's eyes lit up."Sure!Let's do it right. "Earthworm said, "Under the circumstances perhaps I need one. ""Can have it," I assured."Want a counsel?""Why, I suppose I need a lawyer, too. ""I said 'counsel,' not 'lawyer. 'Aren't any lawyers here. "Again he seemed delighted."I suppose counsel, if I elected to have one, would be of the same, uh, informal quality as the rest of these proceedings?""Maybe, maybe not.I'm informal sort of judge, that's all.Suit yourself. ""Mm.I think I'll rely on your informality, your honor. "Oldest lad said, "Uh, this jury.You pick up chit?Or do we?""I pay it; I agreed to judge for a hundred forty, gross.Haven't you been in court before?But not going to kill my net for extra I could do without.Six jurymen, five dollars each.See who's in Alley. "One boy stepped out and shouted, "Jury work!Five dollar job!"They rounded up six men and were what you would expect in Bottom Alley.Didn't worry me as had no intention of paying mind to them.If you go judge, better in good neighborhood with chance of getting solid citizens.I went behind desk, sat down, put on Brody's plug hat  wondered where he had found it.Probably a castoff from some lodge."Court's in session," I said."Let's have names and tell me beef. "Oldest lad was named.Slim Lemke, girl war Patricia Carmen Zhukov; don't remember others.Tourist stepped up, reached into pouch and said, "My card, sir. "I still have it.It read:   STUART RENE LaJOIE  Poet  Traveler  Soldier of Fortune   Beef was tragically ridiculous, fine example of why tourists should not wander around without guides.Sure, guides bleed them white  but isn't that what a tourist is for?This one almost lost life from lack of guidance.Had wandered into a taproom which lets stilyagi hang out, a sort of clubroom.This simple female had flirted with him.Boys had let matter be, as of course they had to as long as she invited it.But at some point she had laughed and let him have a fist in ribs.He had taken it as casually as a Loonie would...but had answered in distinctly earthworm manner; slipped arm around waist and pulled her to him, apparently tried to kiss her.Now believe me, in North America this wouldn't matter; I've seen things much like it.But of course Tish was astonished, perhaps frightened.She screamed.And pack of boys set upon him and roughed him up.Then decided he had to pay for his "crime"  but do it correctly.Find a judge.Most likely they chickened.Chances are not one had ever dealt with an elimination.But their lady had been insulted, had to be done.I questioned them, especially Tish, and decided I had it straight.Then said, "Let me sum up.Here we have a stranger.Doesn't know our ways.He offended, he's guilty.But meant no offense far as I can see.What does jury say?Hey, you there!wake up!What you say?"Juryman looked up blearily, said, "'Liminate him!""Very well?And you?""Well  " Next one hesitated."Guess it would be enough just to beat tar out of him, so he'll know better next time.Can't have men pawing women, or place will get to be as bad as they say Terra is. ""Sensible," I agreed."And you?"Only one juror voted for elimination.Others ranged from a beating to very high fines."What do you think, Slim?""Well  " He was worried  face in front of gang, face in front of what might be his girl.But had cooled down and didn't want chum eliminated."We already worked him over.Maybe if he got down on hands and knees and kissed floor in front of Tish and said he was sorry?""Will you do that, Gospodin LaJoie?""If you so rule, your honor. ""I don't.Here's my verdict.First that juryman  you!you are fined fee paid you because you fell asleep while supposed to be judging.Grab him, boys, take it away from him and throw him out. "They did, enthusiastically; made up a little for greater excitement they had thought of but really could not stomach."Now, Gospodin LaJoie, you are fined fifty Hong Kong for not having common sense to learn local customs before stirring around.Ante up. "I collected it."Now you boys line up.You are fined five dollars apiece for not exercising good judgment in dealing with a person you knew was a stranger and not used to our ways.Stopping him from touching Tish, that's fine.Rough him, that's okay, too; he'll learn faster.And could have tossed him out.But talking about eliminating for what was honest mistake  well, it's out of proportion.Five bucks each.Ante up.Slim gulped."Judge...I don't think we have that much left!At least I don't. ""I thought that might be.You have a week to pay or I post your names in Old Dome.Know where Bon Ton Beaut Shoppe is, near easement lock thirteen?My wife runs it; pay her.Court's out.Slim, don't go away.Nor you, Tish.Gospodin LaJoie, let's take these young people up and buy them a cold drink and get better acquainted. "Again his eyes filled with odd delight that reminded of Prof."A charming idea, Judge!""I'm no longer judge.It's up a couple of ramps...so I suggest you offer Tish your arm. "He bowed and said, "My lady?May I?"and crooked his elbow to her.Tish at once became very grown up."Spasebo, Gospodin!I am pleased. "Took them to expensive place, one where their wild clothes and excessive makeup looked out of place; they were edgy.But I tried to make them feel easy and Stuart LaJoie tried even harder and successfully.Got their addresses as well as names; Wyoh had one sequence which was concentrating on stilyagi.Presently they finished their coolers, stood up, thanked and left.LaJoie and I stayed on."Gospodin," he said presently, "you used an odd word earlier  odd to me, I mean. ""Call me 'Mannie' now that kids are gone.What word?""It was when you insisted that the, uh, young lady, Tish   that Tish must pay, too.'Tone stapple,' or something like it. ""Oh, 'tanstaafl. 'Means ~There ain't no such thing as a free lunch. 'And isn't," I added, pointing to a FREE LUNCH sign across room, "or these drinks would cost half as much.Was reminding her that anything free costs twice as much in long run or turns out worthless. ""An interesting philosophy. ""Not philosophy, fact.One way or other, what you get, you pay for. "I fanned air."Was Earthside once and heard expression 'Free as air. 'This air isn't free, you pay for every breath. ""Really?No one has asked me to pay to breathe. "He smiled."Perhaps I should stop. ""Can happen, you almost breathed vacuum tonight.But nobody asks you because you've paid.For you, is part of round trip ticket; for me it's a quarterly charge. "I started to tell how my family buys and sells air to community co op, decided was too complicated."But we both pay. "LaJoie looked thoughtfully pleased."Yes, I see the economic necessity.It's simply new to me.Tell me, uh, Mannie  and I'm called 'Stu'  was I really in danger of 'breathing vacuum'?""Should have charged you more. ""Please?""You aren't convinced.But charged kids all they could scrape up and fined them too, to make them think.Couldn't charge you more than them.Should have, you think it was all a joke. ""Believe me, sir, I do not think it was a joke.I just have trouble grasping that your local laws permit a man to be put to death...so casually...and for so trivial an offense. "I sighed.Where do you start explaining when a man's words show there isn't anything he understands about subject, instead is loaded with preconceptions that don't fit facts and doesn't even know he has?"Stu," I said, "let's take that piece at a time.Are no 'local laws' so you couldn't be 'put to death' under them.Your offense was not 'trivial,' I simply made allowance for ignorance.And wasn't done casually, or boys would have dragged you to nearest lock to zero pressure, shoved you in, and cycled.Instead were most formal  good boys!and paid own cash to give you a trial.And didn't grumble when verdict wasn't even close to what they asked.Now, anything still not clear?"He grinned and turned out to have dimples like Prof; found myself liking him still more."All of it, I'm afraid.I seem to have wandered into Looking Glass Land. "Expected that; having been Earthaide I know how their minds work, some.An earthworm expects to find a law, a printed law, for every circumstance.Even have laws for private matters such as contracts.Really, if a man's word isn't any good, who would contract with him?Doesn't he have reputation?"We don't have laws," I said."Never been allowed to.Have customs, but aren't written and aren't enforced  or could say they are self enforcing because are simply way things have to be, conditions being what they are.Could say our customs are natural laws because are way people have to behave to stay alive.When you made a pass at Tish you were violating a natural law...and almost caused you to breathe vacuum. "He blinked thoughtfully."Would you explain the natural law I violated?I had better understand it...or best I return to my ship and stay inboard until lift.To stay alive. ""Certainly.Is so simple that, once you understand, you'll never be in danger from it again.Here we are, two million males, less than one million females.A physical fact, basic as rock or vacuum.Then add idea of tanstaafl.When thing is scarce, price goes up.Women are scarce; aren't enough to go around  that makes them most valuable thing in Luna, more precious than ice or air, as men without women don't care whether they stay alive or not.Except a Cyborg, if you regard him as a man, which I don't. "I went on: "So what happens?and mind you, things were even worse when this custom, or natural law, first showed itself back in twentieth century.Ratio was ten to one or worse then.One thing is what always happens in prisons: men turn to other men.That helps not much; problem still is because most men want women and won't settle for substitute while chance of getting true gelt."They get so anxious they will kill for it...and from stories old timers tell was killing enough to chill your teeth in those days.But after a while those still alive find way to get along, things shake down.As automatic as gravitation.Those who adjust to facts stay alive; those who don't are dead and no problem."What that means, here and now, is that women are scarce and call tune...and you are surrounded by two million men who see to it you dance to that tune.You have no choice, she has all choice.She can hit you so hard it draws blood; you dasn't lay a finger on her.Look, you put an arm around Tish, maybe tried to kiss.Suppose instead she had gone to hotel room with you; what would happen?""Heavens!I suppose they would have torn me to pieces. ""They would have done nothing.Shrugged and pretended not to see.Because choice is hers.Not yours.Not theirs.Exclusively hers.Oh, be risky to ask her to go to hotel; she might take offense and that would give boys license to rough you up.But  well, take this Tish.A silly little tart.If you had flashed as much money as I saw in your pouch, she might have taken into head that a bundle with tourist was just what she needed and suggested it herself.In which case would have been utterly safe. "Lajoie shivered."At her age?It scares me to think of it.She's below the age of consent.Statutory rape. ""Oh, bloody!No such thing.Women her age are married or ought to be.Stu, is no rape in Luna.None.Men won't permit.If rape had been involved, they wouldn't have bothered to find a judge and all men in earshot would have scrambled to help.But chance that a girl that big is virgin is negligible.When they're little, their mothers watch over them, with help from everybody in city; children are safe here.But when they reach husband high, is no holding them and mothers quit trying.If they choose to run corndors and have fun, can't stop 'em; once a girl is nubile, she's her own boss.You married?""No. "He added with a smile; "Not at present. ""Suppose you were and wife told you she was marrying again.What would you do?""Odd that you should pick that, something like it did happen.I saw my attorney and made sure she got no alimony. ""'Alimony' isn't a word here; I learned it Earthside.Here you might  or a Loonie husband might  say, 'I think we'll need a bigger place, dear. 'Or might simply congratulate her and his new co husband.Or if it made him so unhappy he couldn't stand it, might opt out and pack clothes.But whatever, would not make slightest fuss.If he did, opinion would be unanimous against him.His friends, men and women alike, would snub him.Poor sod would probably move to Novylen, change name and hope to live it down."All our customs work that way.If you're out in field and a cobber needs air, you lend him a bottle and don't ask cash.But when you're both back in pressure again, if he won't pay up, nobody would criticize if you eliminated him without a judge.But he would pay; air is almost as sacred as women.If you take a new chum in a poker game, you give him air money.Not eating money; can work or starve.If you eliminate a man other than self defense, you pay his debts and support his kids, or people won't speak to you, buy from you, sell to you. ""Mannie, you're telling me that I can murder a man here and settle the matter merely with money?""Oh, not at all!But eliminating isn't against some law; are no laws  except Warden's regulations  and Warden doesn't care what one Loonie does to another.But we figure this way: If a man is killed, either he had it coming and everybody knows it  usual case  or his friends will take care of it by eliminating man who did it.Either way, no problem.Nor many eliminations.Even set duels aren't common. ""'His friends will take care of it. 'Mannie, suppose those young people had gone ahead?I have no friends here. ""Was reason I agreed to judge.While I doubt if those kids could have egged each other into it, didn't want to take chance.Eliminating a tourist could give our city a bad name. ""Does it happen often?""Can't recall has ever happened.Of course may have been made to look like accident.A new chum is accident prone; Luna is that sort of place.They say if a new chum lives a year, he'll live forever.But nobody sells him insurance first year. "Glanced at time."Stu, have you had dinner?""No, and I was about to suggest that you come to my hotel.The cooking is good.Auberge Orleans. "I repressed shudder  ate there once."Instead, would you come home with me and meet my family?We have soup or something about this hour. ""Isn't that an imposition?""No.Half a minute while I phone. "Mum said, "Manuel!How sweet, dear!Capsule has been in for hours; I had decided it would be tomorrow or later. ""Just drunken debauchery, Mimi, and evil companions.Coming home now if can remember way  and bringing evil companion. ""Yes, dear.Dinner in twenty minutes; try not to be late. ""Don't you want to know whether my evil companion is male or female?""Knowing you, I assume that it is female.But I fancy I shall be able to tell when I see her. ""You know me so well, Mum.Warn girls to look pretty; wouldn't want a visitor to outshine them. ""Don't be too long; dinner will spoil.'Bye, dear.Love. ""Love, Mum. "I waited, then punched MYCROFTXXX."Mike, want a name searched.Earthside name, passenger in Popov.Stuart Rene LaJoie.Stuart with a U and last name might file under either L or J. "Didn't wait many seconds; Mike found Stu in all major Earthside references: Who's Who, Dun & Bradstreet, Almanach de Gotha, London Times running files, name it.French expatriate, royalist, wealthy, six more names sandwiched into ones he used, three university degrees including one in law from Sorbonne, noble ancestry both France and Scotland, divorced (no children) from Honorable Pamela Hyphen Hyphen Blueblood.Sort of earthworm who wouldn't speak to a Loonie of convict ancestry  except Stu would speak to anyone.I listened a pair of minutes, then asked Mike to prepare a full dossier, following all associational leads."Mike, might be our pigeon. ""Could be, Man. ""Got to run.'Bye. "Returned thoughtfully to my guest.Almost a year earlier, during alcoholic talk talk in a hotel room, Mike had promised us one chance in seven  if certain things were done.One sine qua non was help on Terra itself.Despite "throwing rocks," Mike knew, we all knew, that mighty Terra with eleven billion people and endless resources could not be defeated by three million who had nothing, even though we stood on a high place and could drop rocks on them.Mike drew parallels from XVIIIth century, when Britain's American colonies broke away, and from XXth, when many colonies became independent of several empires, and pointed out that in no case had a colony broken loose by brute force.No, in every case imperial state was busy elsewhere, had grown weary and given up without using full strength.For months we had been strong enough, had we wished, to overcome Warden's bodyguards.Once our catapult was ready (anytime now) we would not be helpless.But we needed a "favorable climate" on Terra.For that we needed help on Terra.Prof had not regarded it as difficult.But turned out to be quite difficult.His Earthside friends were dead or nearly and I had never had any but a few teachers.We sent inquiry down through cells: "What vips do you know Earthaide?"and usual answer was: "You kidding?"Null program    Prof watched passenger lists on incoming ships, trying to figure a contact, and had been reading Luna print outs of Earthside newspapers, searching for vips he could reach through past connection.I had not tried; handful I had met on Terra were not vips.Prof had not picked Stu off Popov's passenger list.But Prof had not met him.I didn't not know whether Stu was simply eccentric as odd personal card seemed to show.But he was only Terran I had ever had a drink with in Luna, seemed a dinkum cobber, and Mike's report showed hunch was not all bad; he carried some tonnage.So I took him home to see what family thought of him.Started well.Mum smiled and offered hand.He took it and bowed so deep I thought he was going to kiss it  would have, I think, had I not warned him about fems.Mum was cooing as she led him in to dinner.12   April and May '76 were more hard work and increasing effort to stir up Loonies against Warden, and goad him into retaliation.Trouble with Mort the Wart was that he was not a bad egg, nothing to hate about him other than fact he was symbol of Authority; was necessary to frighten him to get him to do anything.And average Loonie was just as bad.He despised Warden as matter of ritual but was not stuff that makes revolutionists; he couldn't be bothered.Beer, betting, women, and work   Only thing that kept Revolution from dying of anemia was that Peace Dragoons had real talent for antagonizing.But even them we had to keep stirred up.Prof kept saying we needed a "Boston Tea Party," referring to mythical incident in an earlier revolution, by which he meant a public ruckus to grab attention.We kept trying.Mike rewrote lyrics of old revolutionary songs: "Marseillaise," "Internationale," "Yankee Doodle," "We Shall Overcome," "Pie in the Sky," etc., giving them words to fit Luna.Stuff like "Sons of Rock and Boredom/Will you let the Warden/Take from you your libertee!"Simon Jester spread them around, and when one took hold, we pushed it (music only) by radio and video.This put Warden in silly position of forbidding playing of certain tunes  which suited us; people could whistle.Mike studied voice and word choice patterns of Deputy Administrator, Chief Engineer, other department heads; Warden started getting frantic calls at night from his staff.Which they denied making.So Alvarez put lock and trace on next one  and sure enough, with Mike's help, Alvarez traced it to supply chief's phone and was sure it was boss belly robber's voice.But next poison call to Mort seemed to come from Alvarez, and what Mort had to say next day to Alvarez and what Alvaiez said in own defense can only be described as chaotic crossed with psychotic.Prof had Mike stop; was afraid Alvarez might lose job, which we did not want; he was doing too well for us.But by then Peace Dragoons had been dragged out twice in night on what seemed to be Warden's orders, further disrupting morale, and Warden became convinced he was surrounded by traitors in official family while they were sure he had blown every circult.An ad appeared in Lunaya Pravda announcing lecture by Dr.Adam Selene on Poetry and Arts in Luna: a New Renaissance.No comrade attended; word went down cells to stay away.Nor did anybody hang around when three squads of Peace Dragoons showed up  this involves Heisenberg principle as applied to Scarlet Pimpernels.Editor of Pravda spent bad hour explaining that he did not accept ads in person and this one was ordered over counter and paid for in cash.He was told not to take ads from Adam Selene.This was countermanded and he was told to take anything from Adam Selene but notify Alvarez at once.New catapult was tested with a load dropped into south Indian Ocean at 350 E. , 600 S. , a spot used only by fish.Mike was joyed over his marksmanship since he had been able to sneak only two looks when guidance & tracking radars were not in use and had relied on just one nudge to bring it to bullseye.Earthside news reported giant meteor in sub Antarctic picked up by Capetown Spacetrack with projected impact that matched Mike's attempt perfectly  Mike called me to boast while taking down evening's Reuters transmission."I told you it was dead on," he gloated."I watched it.Oh, what a lovely splash!"Later reports on shock wave from seismic labs and on tsunamis from oceanographic stations were consistent.Was only canister we had ready (trouble buying steel) or Mike might have demanded to try his new toy again.Liberty Caps started appearing on stilyagi and their girls; Simon Jester began wearing one between his horns.Bon Marche gave them away as premiums.Alvarez had painful talk with Warden in which Mort demanded to know if his fink boss felt that something should be done every time kids took up fad?Had Alvarez gone out of his mind?I ran across Slim Lemke on Carver Causeway early May; he was wearing a Liberty Cap.He seemed pleased to see me and I thanked him for prompt payment (he had come in three days after Stu's trial and paid Sidris thirty Hong Kong, for gang) and bought him a cooler.While we were seated I asked why young people were wearing red hats?Why a hat?Hat's were an earthworm custom, nyet?He hesitated, then said was sort of a lodge, like Elks.I changed subject.Learned that his full name was Moses Lemke Stone; member of Stone Gang.This pleased me, we were relatives.But surprised me.However, even best families such as Stones sometimes can't always find marriages for all sons; I had been lucky or might have been roving corridors at his age, too.Told him about our connection on my mother's side.He warmed up and shortly said, "Cousin Manuel, ever think about how we ought to elect our own Warden?"I said No, I hadn't; Authority appointed him and I supposed they always would.He asked why we had to have an Authority?I asked who had been putting ideas in head?He insisted nobody had, just thinking, was all  didn't he have a right to think?When I got home was tempted to check with Mike, find out lad's Party name if any.But wouldn't have been proper security, nor fair to Slim.On 3 May '76 seventy one males named Simon were rounded up and questioned, then released.No newspaper carned story.But everybody heard it; we were clear down in "J's" and twelve thousand people can spread a story faster than I would have guessed.We emphasized that one of these dangerous males was only four years old, which was not true but very effective.Stu Lajoie stayed with us during February and March and did not return to Terra until early April; he changed his ticket to next ship and then to next.When I pointed out that he was riding close to invisible line where irreversible physiological changes could set in, he grinned and told me not to worry.But made arrangements to use centrifuge.Stu did not want to leave even by April.Was kissed goodbye with tears by all my wives and Wyoh, and he assured each one he was coming back.But left as he had work to do; by then he was a Party member.I did not take part in decision to recruit Stu; I felt prejudiced.Wyoh and Prof and Mike were unanimous in risking it; I happily accepted their judgment.We all helped to sell Stu LaJoie  self, Prof, Mike, Wyoh, Mum, even Sidris and Lenore and Ludmilla and our kids and Hans and Ali and Frank, as Davis home life was what grabbed him first.Did not hurt that Lenore was prettiest girl in L City  which is no disparagement of Milla, Wyoh, Anna, and Sidris.Nor did it hurt that Stu could charm a baby away from breast.Mom fussed over him, Hans showed him hydroponic farming and Stu got dirty and sweaty and sloshed around in tunnels with our boys  helped harvest our Chinee fishponds  got stung by our bees  learned to handle a p suit and went up with me to make adjustments on solar battery  helped Anna butcher a hog and learned about tanning leather  sat with Grandpaw and was respectful to his naive notions about Terra  washed dishes with Milla, something no male in our family ever did  rolled on floor with babies and puppies  learned to grind flour and swapped recipes with Mum.I introduced him to Prof and that started political side of feeling him out.Nothing had been admitted  we could back away  when Prof introduced him to "Adam Selene" who could visit only by phone as he was "in Hong Kong at present. "By time Stu was committed to Cause, we dropped pretense and let him know that Adam was chairman whom he would not meet in person for security reasons.But Wyoh did most and was on her judgment that Prof turned cards up and let Stu know that we were building a revolution.Was no surprise; Stu had made up mind and was waiting for us to trust him.They say a face once launched a thousand ships.I do not know that Wyoh used anything but argument on Stu.I never tried to find out.But Wyoh had more to do with committing me than all Prof's theory or Mike's figures.If Wyoh used even stronger methods on Stu, she was not first heroine in history to do so for her country.Stu went Earthside with a special codebook.I'm no code and cipher expert except that a computerman learns principles during study of information theory.A cipher is a mathematical pattern under which one letter substitutes for another, simplest being one in which alphabet is merely scrambled.A cipher can be incredibly subtle, especially with help of a computer.But ciphers all have weakness that they are patterns.If one computer can think them up, another computer can break them.Codes do not have same weakness.Let's say that codebook has letter group GLOPS.Does this mean "Aunt Minnie will be home Thursday" or does it mean "3.14157. .."?Meaning is whatever you assign and no computer can analyze it simply from letter group.Give a computer enough groups and a rational theory involving meanings or subjects for meanings, and it will eventually worry it out because meanings themselves will show patterns.But is a problem of different kind on more difficult level.Code we selected was commonest commercial codebook, used both on Terra and in Luna for commercial dispatches.But we worked it over.Prof and Mike spent hours discussing what information Party might wish to send to its agent on Terra, or receive from agent, then Mike put his vast information to work and came up with new set of meanings for codebook, ones that could say "Buy Thai rice futures" as easily as "Run for life; they've caught us. "Or anything, as cipher signals were buried in it to permit anything to be said that had not been anticipated.Late one night Mike made print out of new code via Lunaya Pravda's facilities, and night editor turned roll over to another comrade who converted it into a very small roll of film and passed it along in turn, and none ever knew what they handled or why.Wound up in Stu's pouch.Search of off planet luggage was tight by then and conducted by bad tempered Dragoons  but Stu was certain he would have no trouble.Perhaps he swallowed it.Thereafter some of LuNoHo Company's dispatches to Terra reached Stu via his London broker.Part of purpose was financial.Party needed to spend money Earthside; LuNoHoCo transferred money there (not all stolen, some ventures turned out well); Party needed still more money Earthside, Stu was to speculate, acting on secret knowledge of plan of Revolution  he, Prof, and Mike had spent hours discussing what stocks would go up, what would go down, etc., after Der Tag.This was Prof's pidgin; I am not that sort of gambler.But money was needed before Der Tag to build "climate of opinion. "We needed publicity, needed delegates and senators in Federated Nations, needed some nation to recognize us quickly once The Day came, we needed laymen telling other laymen over a beer: "What is there on that pile of rock worth one soldier's life?Let 'em go to hell in their own way, I say!"Money for publicity, money for bribes, money for dummy organizations and to infiltrate established organizations; money to get true nature of Luna's economy (Stu had gone loaded with figures) brought out as scientific research, then in popular form; money to convince foreign office of at least one major nation that there was advantage in a Free Luna; money to sell idea of Lunar tourism to a major cartel    Too much money!Stu offered own fortune and Prof did not discourage it   Where treasure is, heart will be.But still too much money and far too much to do.I did not know if Stu could swing a tenth of it; simply kept fingers crossed.At least it gave us a channel to Terra.Prof claimed that communications to enemy were essential to any war if was to be fought and settled sensibly.(Prof was a pacifist.Like his vegetarianism, he did not let it keep him from being "rational. "Would have made a terrific theologian. )As soon as Stu went Earthside, Mike set odds at one in thirteen.I asked him what in hell?"But, Man," he explained patiently, "it increases risk.That it is necessary risk does not change the fact that risk is increased. "I shut up.About that time, early May, a new factor reduced some risks while revealing others.One part of Mike handled Terra Luna microwave traffic  commercial messages, scietitific data, news channels, video, voice radiotelephony, routine Authority traffic  and Warden's top secret.Aside from last, Mike could read any of this including commercial codes and ciphers  breaking ciphers was a crossword puzzle to him and nobody mistrusted this machine.Except Warden, and I suspect that his was distrust of all machinery; was sort of person who finds anything more involved than a pair of scissors complex, mysterious, and suspect  Stone Age mind.Warden used a code that Mike never saw.Also used ciphers and did not work them through Mike; instead he had a moronic little machine in residence office.On top of this he had arrangement with Authority Earthside to switch everything around at preset times.No doubt he felt safe.Mike broke his cipher patterns and deduced time change program just to try legs.He did not tackle code until Prof suggested it; it held no interest for him.But once Prof asked, Mike tackled Warden's top secret messages.He had to start from scratch; in past Mike had erased Warden's messages once transmission was reported.So slowly, slowly he accumulated data for analysis  painfully slow, for Warden used this method only when he had to.Sometimes a week would pass between such messages.But gradually Mike began to gather meanings for letter groups, each assigned a probability.A code does not crack all at once; possible to know meanings of ninety nine groups in a message and miss essence because one group is merely GLOPS to you.However, user has a problem, too; if GLOPS comes through as GLOPT, he's in trouble.Any method of communication needs redundancy, or information can be lost.Was at redundancy that Mike nibbled, with perfect patience of machine.Mike solved most of Warden's code sooner than he had projected; Warden was sending more traffic than in past and most of it one subject (which helped)  subject being security and subversion.We had Mort in a twitter; he was yelling for help.He reported subversive activities still going on despite two phalanges of Peace Dragoons and demanded enough troops to station guards in all key spots inside all warrens.Authority told him this was preposterous, no more of FN's crack troops could be spared  to be permanently ruined for Earthside duties  and such requests should not be made.If he wanted more guards, he must recruit them from transportees but such increase in administrative costs must be absorbed in Luna; he would not be allowed more overhead.He was directed to report what steps be had taken to meet new grain quotas set in our such and such.Warden replied that unless extremely moderate requests for trained security personnel  not repeat not untrained, unreliable, and unfit convicts  were met, he could no longer assure civil order, much less increased quotas.Reply asked sneeringly what difference it made if exconsignees chose to riot among themselves in their holes?If it worried him, had he thought of shutting off lights as was used so successfully in 1996 and 2021?These exchanges caused us to revise our calendar, to speed some phases, slow others.Like a perfect dinner, a revolution has to be "cooked" so that everything comes out even.Stu needed time Earthside.We needed canisters and small steering rockets and associated circuitry for "rock throwing. "And steel was a problem  buying it, fabricating it, and above all moving it through meander of tunnels to new catapult site.We needed to increase Party at least into "K's"  say 40,000  with lowest echelons picked for fighting spirit rather than talents we had sought earlier.We needed weapons against landings.We needed to move Mike's radars without which he was blind.(Mike could not be moved; bits of him spread all through Luna.But he had a thousand meters of rock over that central part of him at Complex, was surrounded by steel and this armor was cradled in springs; Authority had contemplated that someday somebody might lob H weapons at their control center. )All these needed to be done and pot must not boil too soon.So we cut down on things that worried Warden and tried to speed up everything else.Simon Jester took a holiday.Word went out that Liberty Caps were not stylish  but save them.Warden got no more nervous making phone calls.We quit inciting incidents with Dragoons which did not stop them but reduced number.Despite efforts to quiet Mort's worries a symptom showed up which disquieted us instead.No message (at least we intercepted none) reached Warden agreeing to his demand for more troops  but he started moving people out of Complex.Civil servants who lived there started looking for holes to rent in L City.Authority started test drills and resonance exploration in a cubic adjacent to L. City which could be converted into a warren.Could mean that Authority proposed shipping up unusually large draft of prisoners.Could mean that space in Complex was needed for purpose other than quarters.But Mike told us:  "Why kid yourselves?The Warden is going to get those troops; that space will be their barracks.Any other explanation I would have heard. "I said, "But Mike, why didn't you hear if it's troops?You have that code of Warden's fairly well whipped. ""Not just 'fairly well,' I've got it whipped.But the last two ships have carried Authority vips and I don't know what they talk about away from phones!"So we tried to plan to cover possibility of having to cope with ten more phalanges, that being Mike's estimate of what cubic being cleared would hold.We could deal with that many  with Mike's help  but it would mean deaths, not bloodless coup d'etat Prof had planned.And we increased efforts to speed up other factors.When suddenly we found ourselves committed        13   Her name was Marie Lyons; she was eighteen years old and born in Luna, mother having been exiled via Peace Corps in '56.No record of father.She seems to have been a harmless person.Worked as a stock control clerk in shipping department, lived in Complex.Maybe she hated Authority and enjoyed teasing Peace Dragoons.Or perhaps it started as a commercial transaction as cold blooded as any in a crib behind a slot machine lock.How can we know?Six Dragoons were in it.Not satisfied with raping her (if rape it was) they abused her other ways and killed her.But they did not dispose of body neatly; another civil service fem found it before was cold.She screamed.Was her last scream.We heard about it at once; Mike called us three while Alvarez and Peace Dragoon C. O.  were digging into matter in Alvarez's office.Appears that Peace Goon boss had no trouble laying hands on guilty; he and Alvarez were questioning them one at a time, and quarreling between grillings.Once we heard Alvarez say: "I told you those goons of yours had to have their own women!I warned you!""Stuff it," Dragoon officer answered."I've told you time and again they won't ship any.The question now is how we hush this up. ""Are you crazy?Warden already knows. ""It's still the question. ""Oh, shut up and send in the next one. "Early in filthy story Wyoh joined me in workshop.Was pale under makeup, said nothing but wanted to sit close and clench my hand.At last was over and Dragoon officer left Alvarez.Were still quarreling.Alvarez wanted those six executed at once and fact made public (sensible but not nearly enough, for his needs); C. O.  was still talking about "hushing it up. "Prof said, "Mike, keep an ear there and listen where else you can.Well, Mike?Wyoh?Plans?"I didn't have any.Wasn't a cold, shrewd revolutionist; just wanted to get my heel into faces that matched those six voices."I don't know.What do we do, Prof?""'Do'?We're on our tiger; we grab its ears.Mike.Where's Finn Nielsen?Find him. "Mike answered, "He's calling now. "He cut Finn in with us; I heard: "  at Tube South.Both guards dead and about six of our people.Just people, I mean, not necessarily comrades.Some wild rumor about Goons going crazy and raping and killing all women at Complex.Adam, I had better talk to Prof. ""I'm here, Finn," Prof answered in a strong, confident voice."Now we move, we've got to.Switch off and get those laser guns and men who trained with them, any you can round up. ""Da!Okay, Adam?""Do as Prof says.Then call back. ""Hold it, Finn!"I cut in."Mannie here.I want one of those guns. ""You haven't practiced, Mannie. ""If it's a laser, I can use it!""Mannie," Prof said forcefully, "shut up.You're wasting time; let Finn go.Adam.Message for Mike.Tell him Plan Alert Four. "Prof's example damped my oscillating.Had forgotten that Finn was not supposed to know Mike was anybody but "Adam Selene"; forgotten everything but raging anger.Mike said, "Finn has switched off, Prof, and I put Alert Four on standby when this broke.No traffic now except routine stuff filed earlier.You don't want it interrupted, do you?""No, just follow Alert Four.No Earthside transmission either way that tips any news.If one comes in, hold it and consult. "Alert Four was emergency communication doctrine, intended to slap censorship on news to Terra without arousing suspicion.For this Mike was ready to talk in many voices with excuses as to why a direct voice transmission would be delayed  and any taped transmission was no problem."Program running," agreed Mike."Good.Mannie, calm down, son, and stick to your knitting.Let other people do the fighting; you're needed here, we're going to have to improvise.Wyoh, cut out and get word to Comrade Cecilia to get all Irregulars out of the corridors.Get those children home and keep them home  and have their mothers urging other mothers to do the same thing.We don't know where the fighting will spread.But we don't want children hurt if we can help it. ""Right away, Prof!""Wait.As soon as you've told Sidris, get moving on your stilyagi.I want a riot at the Authority's city office  break in, wreck the place, and noise and shouting and destruction  no one hurt if it can be helped.Mike.Alert Four Em.Cut off the Complex except for your own lines. ""Prof!"I demanded."What sense in starting riots here?""Mannie, Mannie!This is The Day!Mike, has the rape and murder news reached other warrens?""Not that I've heard.I'm listening here and there with random jumps.Tube stations are quiet except Luna City.Fighting has just started at Tube Station West.Want to hear it?""Not now.Mannie, slide over there and watch it.But stay out of it and slick close to a phone.Mike, start trouble in all warrens.Pass the news down the cells and use Finn's version, not the truth.The Goons are raping and killing all the women in the Complex  I'll give you details or you can invent them.Uh, can you order the guards at tube stations in other warrens back to their barracks?I want riots but there is no point in sending unarmed people against armed men if we can dodge it. ""I'll try. "I hurried to Tube Station West, slowed as I neared it.Corridors were full of angry people.City roared in way I had never heard before and, as I crossed Causeway, could hear shouts and crowd noise from direction of Authority's city office although it seemed to me there had not been time for Wyoh to reach her stilyagi  nor had there been; what Prof had tried to start was under way spontaneously.Station was mobbed and I had to push through to see what I assumed to be certain, that passport guards were either dead or fled.
