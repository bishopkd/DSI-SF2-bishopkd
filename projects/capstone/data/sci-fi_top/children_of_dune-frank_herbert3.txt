"This doesn't sound like you, Tyek," Farad'n said."Then I can only speak from my new religion," he said, addressing the fountain.To speak of religion was, of course, why they'd risked bringing The Preacher here."Then speak from this religion," Farad'n said."As My Prince commands. "He turned, looked at this youthful holder of all the dreams which now were distilled into the path which House Corrino would follow."Church and state.My Prince, even scientific reason and faith, and even more: progress and tradition   all of these are reconciled in the teachings of Muad'Dib.He taught that there are no intransigent opposites except in the beliefs of men and, sometimes, in their dreams.One discovers the future in the past, and both are part of a whole. "In spite of doubts which he could not dispel, Farad'n found himself impressed by these words.He heard a note of reluctant sincerity in Tyekanik's voice, as though the man spoke against inner compulsions."And that's why you bring me this...this interpreter of dreams?""Yes, My Prince.Perhaps your dream penetrates Time.You win back your consciousness of your inner being when you recognize the universe as a coherent whole.Your dreams...well... ""But I spoke idly of my dreams," Farad'n protested."They are a curiosity, no more.I never once suspected that you... ""My Prince, nothing you do can be unimportant. ""That's very flattering, Tyek.Do you really believe this fellow can see into the heart of great mysteries?""I do, My Prince. ""Then let my mother be displeased. ""You will see him?""Of course   since you've brought him to displease my mother. "Does he mock me?Tyekanik wondered.And he said: "I must warn you that the old man wears a mask.It is an Ixian device which enables the sightless to see with their skin. ""He is blind?""Yes, My Prince. ""Does he know who I am?""I told him, My Prince. ""Very well.Let us go to him. ""If My Prince will wait a moment here, I will bring the man to him. "Farad'n looked around the fountain garden, smiled.As good a place as any for this foolishness."Have you told him what I dreamed?""Only in general terms, My Prince.He will ask you for a personal accounting. ""Oh, very well.I'll wait here.Bring the fellow. "Farad'n turned his back, heard Tyekanik retire in haste.A gardener could be seen working just beyond the hedge, the top of a brown capped head, the flashing of shears poking above the greenery.The movement was hypnotic.This dream business is nonsense, Farad'n thought.It was wrong of Tyek to do this without consulting me.Strange that Tyek should get religion at his age.And now it's dreams.Presently he heard footsteps behind him.Tyekanik's familiar positive stride and a more dragging gait.Farad'n turned, stared at the approaching dream interpreter.The Ixian mask was a black, gauzy affair which concealed the face from the forehead to below the chin.There were no eye slits in the mask.If one were to believe the Ixian boasts, the entire mask was a single eye.Tyekanik stopped two paces from Farad'n, but the masked old man approached to less than a pace."The interpreter of dreams," Tyekanik said.Farad'n nodded.The masked old man coughed in a remote grunting fashion, as though trying to bring something up from his stomach.Farad'n was acutely conscious of a sour spice smell from the old man.It emanated from the long grey robe which covered his body."Is that mask truly a part of your flesh?"Farad'n asked, realizing he was trying to delay the subject of dreams."While I wear it," the old man said, and his voice carried a bitter twang and just a suggestion of Fremen accent."Your dream," he said."Tell me. "Farad'n shrugged.Why not?That was why Tyek had brought the old man.Or was it?Doubts gripped Farad'n and he asked: "Are you truly a practitioner of oneiromancy?""I have come to interpret your dream, Puissant Lord. "Again Farad'n shrugged.This masked figure made him nervous and he glanced at Tyekanik, who remained where he had stopped, arms folded, staring at the fountain."Your dream, then," the old man pressed.Farad'n inhaled deeply, began to relate the dream.It became easier to talk as he got fully into it.He told about the water flowing upward in the well, about the worlds which were atoms dancing in his head, about the snake which transformed itself into a sandworm and exploded in a cloud of dust.Telling about the snake, he was surprised to discover, required more effort.A terrible reluctance inhibited him and this made him angry as he spoke.The old man remained impassive as Farad'n at last fell silent.The black gauze mask moved slightly to his breathing.Farad'n waited.The silence continued.Presently Farad'n asked: "Aren't you going to interpret my dream?""I have interpreted it," he said, his voice seeming to come from a long distance."Well?"Farad'n heard his own voice squeaking, telling him the tension his dream had produced.Still the old man remained impassively silent."Tell me, then!"The anger was obvious in his tone."I said I'd interpret," the old man said."I did not agree to tell you my interpretation. "Even Tyekanik was moved by this, dropping his arms into balled fists at his sides."What?"he grated."I did not say I'd reveal my interpretation," the old man said."You wish more pay?"Farad'n asked."I did not ask pay when I was brought here. "A certain cold pride in the response softened Farad'n's anger.This was a brave old man, at any rate.He must know death could follow disobedience."Allow me, My Prince," Tyekanik said as Farad'n started to speak.Then: "Will you tell us why you won't reveal your interpretation?""Yes, My Lords.The dream tells me there would be no purpose in explaining these things. "Farad'n could not contain himself."Are you saying I already know the meaning of my dream?""Perhaps you do, My Lord, but that is not my gist. "Tyekanik moved up to stand beside Farad'n.Both glared at the old man."Explain yourself," Tyekanik said."Indeed," Farad'n said."If I were to speak of this dream, to explore these matters of water and dust, snakes and worms, to analyze the atoms which dance in your head as they do in mine   ahh, Puissant Lord, my words would only confuse you and you would insist upon misunderstanding. ""Do you fear that your words might anger me?"Farad'n demanded."My Lord!You're already angry. ""Is it that you don't trust us?"Tyekanik asked."That is very close to the mark, My Lord.I do not trust either of you and for the simple reason that you do not trust yourselves. ""You walk dangerously close to the edge," Tyekanik said."Men have been killed for behavior less abusive than yours. "Farad'n nodded, said: "Don't tempt us to anger. ""The fatal consequences of Corrino anger are well known, My Lord of Salusa Secundus," the old man said.Tyekanik put a restraining hand on Farad'n's arm, asked: "Are you trying to goad us into killing you?"Farad'n had not thought of that, felt a chill now as he considered what such behavior might mean.Was this old man who called himself Preacher...was he more than he appeared?What might be the consequences of his death?Martyrs could be dangerous creations."I doubt that you'll kill me no matter what I say," The Preacher said."I think you know my value, Bashar, and your Prince now suspects it. ""You absolutely refuse to interpret his dream?"Tyekanik asked."I have interpreted it. ""And you will not reveal what you see in it?""Do you blame me, My Lord?""How can you be valuable to me?"Farad'n asked.The Preacher held out his right hand."If I but beckon with this hand, Duncan Idaho will come to me and he will obey me. ""What idle boast is this?"Farad'n asked.But Tyekanik shook his head, recalling his argument with Wensicia.He said: "My Prince, it could be true.This Preacher has many followers on Dune. ""Why didn't you tell me he was from that place?"Farad'n asked.Before Tyekanik could answer.The Preacher addressed Farad'n: "My Lord, you must not feel guilty about Arrakis.You are but a product of your times.This is a special pleading which any man may make when his guilts assail him. ""Guilts!"Farad'n was outraged.The Preacher only shrugged.Oddly, this shifted Farad'n from outrage to amusement.He laughed, throwing his head back, drawing a startled glance from Tyekanik.Then: "I like you,.Preacher. ""This gratifies me, Prince," the old man said.Suppressing a chuckle, Farad'n said: "We'll find you an apartment here in the palace.You will be my official interpreter of dreams   even though you never give me a word of interpretation.And you can advise me about Dune, I have a great curiosity about that place. ""This I cannot do, Prince. "An edge of his anger returned.Farad'n glared at the black mask."And why not, pray tell?""My Prince," Tyekanik said, again touching Farad'n's arm."What is it, Tyek?""We brought him here under bonded agreement with the Guild.He is to be returned to Dune. ""I am summoned back to Arrakis," The Preacher said."Who summons you?"Farad'n demanded."A power greater than thine, Prince. "Farad'n shot a questioning glance at Tyekanik."Is he an Atreides spy?""Not likely, My Prince.Alia has put a price on his head. ""If it's not the Atreides, then who summons you?"Farad'n asked, returning his attention to The Preacher."A power greater than the Atreides. "A chuckle escaped Farad'n.This was only mystic nonsense.How could Tyek be fooled by such stuff?This Preacher had been summoned   most likely by a dream.Of what importance were dreams?"This has been a waste of time, Tyek," Farad'n said."Why did you subject me to this...this farce?""There is a double price here, My Prince," Tyekanik said."This interpreter of dreams promised me to deliver Duncan Idaho as an agent of House Corrino.All he asked was to meet you and interpret your dream. "And Tyekanik added to himself: Or so he told Wensicia!New doubts assailed the Bashar."Why is my dream so important to you, old man?"Farad'n asked."Your dream tells me that great events move toward a logical conclusion," The Preacher said."I must hasten my return. "Mocking, Farad'n said: "And you will remain inscrutable, giving me no advice. ""Advice, Prince, is a dangerous commodity.But I will venture a few words which you may take as advice or in any other way which pleases you. ""By all means," Farad'n said.The Preacher held his masked face rigidly confronting Farad'n."Governments may rise and fall for reasons which appear insignificant, Prince.What small events!An argument between two women...which way the wind blows on a certain day...a sneeze, a cough, the length of a garment or the chance collision of a fleck of sand and a courtier's eye.It is not always the majestic concerns of Imperial ministers which dictate the course of history, nor is it necessarily the pontifications of priests which move the hands of God. "Farad'n found himself profoundly stirred by these words and could not explain his emotion.Tyekanik, however, had focused on one phrase.Why did this Preacher speak of a garment?Tyekanik's mind focused on the Imperial costumes dispatched to the Atreides twins, the tigers trained to attack.Was this old man voicing a subtle warning?How much did he know?"How is this advice?"Farad'n asked."If you would succeed," The Preacher said, "you must reduce your strategy to its point of application.Where does one apply strategy?At a particular place and with a particular people in mind.But even with the greatest concern for minutiae, some small detail with no significance attached to it will escape you.Can your strategy, Prince, be reduced to the ambitions of a regional governor's wife?"His voice cold, Tyekanik interrupted: "Why do you harp upon strategy, Preacher?What is it you think My Prince will have?""He is being led to desire a throne," The Preacher said."I wish him good luck, but he will need much more than luck. ""These are dangerous words," Farad'n said."How is it you dare such words?""Ambitions tend to remain undisturbed by realities," The Preacher said."I dare such words because you stand at a crossroad.You could become admirable.But now you are surrounded by those who do not seek moral justifications, by advisers who are strategy oriented.You are young and strong and tough, but you lack a certain advanced training by which your character might evolve.This is sad because you have weaknesses whose dimensions I have described. ""What do you mean?"Tyekanik demanded."Have a care when you speak," Farad'n said."What is this weakness?""You've given no thought to the kind of society you might prefer," The Preacher said."You do not consider the hopes of your subjects.Even the form of the Imperium which you seek has little shape in your imaginings. "He turned his masked face toward Tyekanik."Your eye is upon the power, not upon its subtle uses and its perils.Your future is filled, thus, with manifest unknowns: with arguing women, with coughs and windy days.How can you create an epoch when you cannot see every detail?Your tough mind will not serve you.This is where you are weak. "Farad'n studied the old man for a long space, wondering at the deeper issues implied by such thoughts, at the persistence of such discredited concepts.Morality!Social goals!These were myths to put beside belief in an upward movement of evolution.Tyekanik said: "We've had enough words.What of the price agreed upon, Preacher?""Duncan Idaho is yours," The Preacher said."Have a care how you use him.He is a jewel beyond price. ""Oh, we've a suitable mission for him," Tyekanik said.He glanced at Farad'n."By your leave, My Prince?""Send him packing before I change my mind," Farad'n said.Then, glaring at Tyekanik: "I don't like the way you've used me, Tyek!""Forgive him, Prince," The Preacher said."Your faithful Bashar does God's will without even knowing it. "Bowing, The Preacher departed, and Tyekanik hurried to see him away.Farad'n watched the retreating backs, thought: I must look into this religion which Tyek espouses.And he smiled ruefully.What a dream interpreter!But what matter?My dream was not an important thing.= = = = = =   And he saw a vision of armor.The armor was not his own skin; it was stronger than plasteel.Nothing penetrated his armor   not knife or poison or sand, not the dust of the desert or its desiccating heat.In his right hand he carried the power to make the Coriolis storm, to shake the earth and erode it into nothing.His eyes were fixed upon the Golden Path and in his left hand he carried the scepter of absolute mastery.And beyond the Golden Path, his eyes looked into eternity which he knew to be the food of his soul and of his everlasting flesh.Heighia, My Brother's Dream from The Book of Ghanima   "It'd be better for me never to become Emperor," Leto said."Oh, I don't imply that I've made my father's mistake and peered into the future with a glass of spice.I say this thing out of selfishness.My sister and I desperately need a time of freedom when we can learn how to live with what we are. "He fell silent, stared questioningly at the Lady Jessica.He'd spoken his piece as he and Ghanima had agreed.Now what would be their grandmother's response?Jessica studied her grandson in the low light of glowglobes which illuminated her quarters in Sietch Tabr.It was still early morning of her second day here and she'd already had disturbing reports that the twins had spent a night of vigil outside the sietch.What were they doing?She had not slept well and she felt fatigue acids demanding that she come down from the hyper level which had sustained her through all the demanding necessities since that crucial performance at the spaceport.This was the sietch of her nightmares   but outside, that was not the desert she remembered.Where have all the flowers come from?And the air around her felt too damp.Stillsuit discipline was lax among the young."What are you, child, that you need time to learn about yourself?"she asked.He shook his head gently, knowing it to be a bizarre gesture of adulthood on a child's body, reminding himself that he must keep this woman off balance."First, I am not a child.Oh... "He touched his chest."This is a child's body; no doubt of that.But I am not a child. "Jessica chewed her upper lip, disregarding what this betrayed.Her Duke, so many years dead on this accursed planet, had laughed at her when she did this."Your one unbridled response," he'd called that chewing of the lip."It tells me that you're disturbed, and I must kiss those lips to still their fluttering. "Now this grandson who bore the name of her Duke shocked her into heart pounding stillness merely by smiling and saying: "You are disturbed; I see it by the fluttering of those lips. "It required the most profound discipline of her Bene Gesserit training to restore a semblance of calm.She managed: "Do you taunt me?""Taunt you?Never.But I must make it clear to you how much we differ.Let me remind you of that sietch orgy so long ago when the Old Reverend Mother gave you her lives and her memories.She tuned herself to you and gave you that...that long chain of sausages, each one a person.You have them yet.So you know something of what Ghanima and I experience. ""And Alia?"Jessica asked, testing him."Didn't you discuss that with Ghani?""I wish to discuss it with you. ""Very well.Alia denied what she was and became that which she most feared.The past within cannot be relegated to the unconscious.That is a dangerous course for any human, but for us who are pre born, it is worse than death.And that is all I will say about Alia. ""So you're not a child," Jessica said."I'm millions of years old.That requires adjustments which humans have never before been called upon to make. "Jessica nodded, calmer now, much more cautious than she'd been with Ghanima.And where was Ghanima?Why had Leto come here alone?"Well, grandmother," he said, "are we Abominations or are we the hope of the Atreides?"Jessica ignored the question."Where is your sister?""She distracts Alia to keep us from being disturbed.It is necessary.But Ghani would say nothing more to you than I've said.Didn't you observe that yesterday?""What I observed yesterday is my affair.Why do you prattle about Abomination?""Prattle?Don't give me your Bene Gesserit cant, grandmother.I'll feed it back to you, word for word, right out of your own memories.I want more than the fluttering of your lips. "Jessica shook her head, feeling the coldness of this...person who carried her blood.The resources at his disposal daunted her.She tried to match his tone, asked: "What do you know of my intentions?"He sniffed."You needn't inquire whether I've made the mistake my father made.I've not looked outside our garden of time   at least not by seeking it out.Leave absolute knowledge of the future to those moments of deja vu which any human may experience.I know the trap of prescience.My father's life tells me what I need to know about it.No, grandmother: to know the future absolutely is to be trapped into that future absolutely.It collapses time.Present becomes future.I require more freedom than that. "Jessica felt her tongue twitch with unspoken words.How could she respond to him with something he didn't already know?This was monstrous!He's me!He's my beloved Leto!This thought shocked her.Momentarily she wondered if the childish mask might not lapse into those dear features and resurrect...No!Leto lowered his head, looked upward to study her.Yes, she could be maneuvered after all.He said: "When you think of prescience, which I hope is rarely, you're probably no different from any other.Most people imagine how nice it would be to know tomorrow's quotation on the price of whale fur.Or whether a Harkonnen will once more govern their homeworld of Giedi Prime?But of course we know the Harkonnens without prescience, don't we, grandmother?"She refused to rise to his baiting.Of course he would know about the cursed Harkonnen blood in his ancestry."Who is a Harkonnen?"he asked, goading."Who is Beast Rabban?Any one of us, eh?But I digress.I speak the popular myth of prescience: to know the future absolutely!All of it!What fortunes could be made   and lost   on such absolute knowledge, eh?The rabble believes this.They believe that if a little bit is good, more must be better.How excellent!And if you handed one of them the complete scenario of his life, the unvarying dialogue up to his moment of death   what a hellish gift that'd be.What utter boredom!Every living instant he'd be replaying what he knew absolutely.No deviation.He could anticipate every response, every utterance   over and over and over and over and over and... "Leto shook his head."Ignorance has its advantages.A universe of surprises is what I pray for!"It was a long speech and, as she listened, Jessica marveled at how his mannerisms, his intonations, echoed his father   her lost son.Even the ideas: these were things Paul might have said."You remind me of your father," she said."Is that hurtful to you?""In a way, but it's reassuring to know he lives on in you. ""How little you understand of how he lives on in me. "Jessica found his tone flat but dripping bitterness.She lifted her chin to look directly at him."Or how your Duke lives in me," Leto said."Grandmother, Ghanima is you!She's you to such an extent that your life holds not a single secret from her up to the instant you bore our father.And me!What a catalogue of fleshly recordings am I.  There are moments when it is too much to bear.You come here to judge us?You come here to judge Alia?Better that we judge you!"Jessica demanded answer of herself and found none.What was he doing?Why this emphasis on his difference?Did he court rejection?Had he reached Alia's condition   Abomination?"This disturbs you," he said."It disturbs me. "She permitted herself a futile shrug."Yes, it disturbs me   and for reasons you know full well.I'm sure you've reviewed my Bene Gesserit training.Ghanima admits it.I know Alia...did.You know the consequences of your difference. "He peered upward at her with disturbing intensity."Almost, we did not take this tack with you," he said, and there was a sense of her own fatigue in his voice."We know the fluttering of your lips as your lover knew them.Any bedchamber endearment your Duke whispered is ours to recall at will.You've accepted this intellectually, no doubt.But I warn you that intellectual acceptance is not enough.If any of us becomes Abomination   it could be you within us who creates it!Or my father...or mother!Your Duke!Any one of you could possess us   and the condition would be the same. "Jessica felt a burning in her chest, dampness in her eyes."Leto...  "she managed, allowing herself to use his name at last.She found the pain less than she'd imagined it would be, forced herself to continue."What is it you want of me?""I would teach my grandmother. ""Teach me what?""Last night, Ghani and I played the mother father roles almost to our destruction, but we learned much.There are things one can know, given an awareness of conditions.Actions can be predicted.Alia, now   it's well nigh certainty that she's plotting to abduct you. "Jessica blinked, shocked by the swift accusation.She knew this trick well, had employed it many times: set a person up along one line of reasoning, then introduce the shocker from another line.She recovered with a sharp intake of breath."I know what Alia has been doing...what she is, but... ""Grandmother, pity her.Use your heart as well as your intelligence.You've done that before.You pose a threat, and Alia wants the Imperium for her own   at least, the thing she has become wants this. ""How do I know this isn't another Abomination speaking?"He shrugged."That's where your heart comes in.Ghani and I know how she fell.It isn't easy to adjust to the clamor of that inner multitude.Suppress their egos and they will come crowding back every time you invoke a memory.One day  " He swallowed in a dry throat.  "a strong one from that inner pack decides it's time to share the flesh. ""And there's nothing you can do?"She asked the question although she feared the answer."We believe there is something...yes.We cannot succumb to the spice; that's paramount.And we must not suppress the past entirely.We must use it, make an amalgam of it.Finally we will mix them all into ourselves.We will, no longer be our original selves   but we will not be possessed. ""You speak of a plot to abduct me. ""It's obvious.Wensicia is ambitious for her son.Alia is ambitious for herself, and... ""Alia and Farad'n?""That's not indicated," he said."But Alia and Wensicia run parallel courses right now.Wensicia has a sister in Alia's house.What simpler thing than a message to  "  "You know of such a message?""As though I'd seen it and read its every word. ""But you've not seen such a message?""No need.I have only to know that the Atreides are all here together on Arrakis.All of the water in one cistern. "He gestured to encompass the planet."House Corrino wouldn't dare attack us here!""Alia would profit if they did. "A sneer in his voice provoked her."I won't be patronized by my own grandson!"she said."Then dammit, woman, stop thinking of me as your grandson!Think of me as your Duke Leto!"Tone and facial expression, even the abrupt, hand gesture, were so exact that she fell silent in confusion.In a dry, remote voice, Leto said: "I tried to prepare you.Give me that, at least. ""Why would Alia abduct me?""To blame it on House Corrino, of course. ""I don't believe it.Even for her, this would be...monstrous!Too dangerous!How could she do it without...I cannot believe this!""When it happens, you'll believe.Ahh, grandmother, Ghani and I have but to eavesdrop within ourselves and we know.It's simple self preservation.How else can we even guess at the mistakes being made around us?""I do not for a minute accept that abduction is part of Alia's  "  "Gods below!How can you, a Bene Gesserit, be this dense?The whole Imperium suspects why you're here.Wensicia's propagandists are all prepared to discredit you.Alia can't wait for that to happen.If you go down, House Atreides could suffer a mortal blow. ""What does the whole Imperium suspect?"She measured out the words as coldly as possible, knowing she could not sway this unchild with any wile of Voice."The Lady Jessica plans to breed those twins together!"he rasped."That's what the Sisterhood wants.Incest!"She blinked."Idle rumor. "She swallowed, "The Bene Gesserits will not let such a rumor run wild in the Imperium.We still have some influence.Remember that. ""Rumor?What rumor?You've certainly held your options open on interbreeding us. "He shook his head as she started to speak."Don't deny it.Let us pass puberty still living in the same household and you in that household, and your influence will be no more than a rag waved in the face of a sandworm. ""Do you believe us to be such utter fools?"Jessica asked."Indeed I do.Your Sisterhood is nothing but a bunch of damn fool old women who haven't thought beyond their precious breeding program!Ghani and I know the leverage they have.Do you think us fools?""Leverage?""They know you're a Harkonnen!It'll be in their breeding records: Jessica out of Tanidia Nerus by the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.That record accidentally made public would pull your teeth to  "  "You think the Sisterhood would stoop to blackmail?""I know they would.Oh, they coated it sweetly.They told you to investigate the rumors about your daughter.They fed your curiosity and your fears.They invoked your sense of responsibility, made you feel guilty because you'd fled back to Caladan.And they offered you the prospect of saving your grandchildren. "Jessica could only stare at him in silence.It was as though he'd eavesdropped on the emotional meetings with her Proctors from the Sisterhood.She felt completely subdued by his words, and now began to accept the possibility that he spoke truth when he said Alia planned abduction."You see, grandmother, I have a difficult decision to make," he said."Do I follow the Atreides mystique?Do I live for my subjects...and die for them?Or do I choose another course   one which would permit me to live thousands of years?"Jessica recoiled involuntarily.These words spoken so easily touched on a subject the Bene Gesserits made almost unthinkable.Many Reverend Mothers could choose that course...or try it.The manipulation of internal chemistry was available to initiates of the Sisterhood.But if one did it, sooner or later all would try it.There could be no concealing such an accumulation of ageless women.They knew for a certainty that this course would lead them to destruction.Short lived humanity would turn upon them.No   it was unthinkable."I don't like the trend of your thoughts," she said."You don't understand my thoughts," he said."Ghani and I. .. "He shook his head."Alia had it in her grasp and threw it away. ""Are you sure of that?I've already sent word to the Sisterhood that Alia practices the unthinkable.Look at her!She's not aged a day since last I. .. ""Oh, that!"He dismissed Bene Gesserit body balance with a wave of his hand."I'm speaking of something else   a perfection of being far beyond anything humans have ever before achieved. "Jessica remained silent, aghast at how easily he'd lifted her disclosure from her.He'd know surely that such a message represented a death sentence on Alia.And no matter how he changed the words, he could only be talking about committing the same offense.Didn't he know the peril of his words?"You must explain," she said finally."How?"he asked."Unless you understand that Time isn't what it appears, I can't even begin to explain.My father suspected it.He stood at the edge of realization, but fell back.Now it's up to Ghani and me. ""I insist that you explain," Jessica said and she fingered the poisoned needle she held beneath a fold of her robe.It was the gom jabbar, so deadly that the slightest prick of it killed within seconds.And she thought: They warned me I might have to use it.The thought sent the muscles of her arm trembling in waves and she was thankful for the concealing robe."Very well," he sighed."First, as to Time: there is no difference between ten thousand years and one year; no difference between one hundred thousand years and a heartbeat.No difference.That is the first fact about Time.And the second fact: the entire universe with all of its Time is within me. ""What nonsense is this?"she demanded."You see?You don't understand.I will try to explain in another way, then. "He raised his right hand to illustrate, moving it as he spoke."We go forward, we come back. ""Those words explain nothing!""That is correct," he said."There are things which words cannot explain.You must experience them without words.But you are not prepared for such a venture, just as when you look at me you do not see me. ""But...I'm looking directly at you.Of course I see you!"She glared at him.His words reflected knowledge of the Zensunni Codex as she'd been taught it in the Bene Gesserit schools: play of words to confuse one's understanding of philosophy."Some things occur beyond your control," he said."How does that explain this...this perfection which is so far beyond other human experiences?"He nodded."If one delays old age or death by the use of melange or by that learned adjustment of fleshly balance which you Bene Gesserits so rightly fear, such a delay invokes only an illusion of control.Whether one walks rapidly through the sietch or slowly, one traverses the sietch.And that passage of time is experienced internally. ""Why do you bandy words this way?I cut my wisdom teeth on such nonsense long before even your father was born. ""But only the teeth grew," he said."Words!Words!""Ahhh, you're very close!""Hah!""Grandmother?""Yes?"He held his silence for a long space.Then: "You see?You can still respond as yourself. "He smiled at her."But you cannot see past the shadows.I am here. "Again he smiled."My father came very near to this.When he lived, he lived, but when he died, he failed to die. ""What're you saying?""Show me his body!""Do you think this Preacher... ""Possible, but even so, that is not his body. ""You've explained nothing," she accused."Just as I warned you. ""Then why... ""You asked.You had to be shown.Now let us return to Alia and her plan of abduction for  "  "Are you planning the unthinkable?"she demanded, holding the poisonous gom jabbar at the ready beneath her robe."Will you be her executioner?"he asked, his voice deceptively mild.He pointed a finger at the hand beneath her robe."Do you think she'll permit you to use that?Or do you think I'd let you use it?"Jessica found she could not swallow."In answer to your question," he said, "I do not plan the unthinkable.I am not that stupid.But I am shocked at you.You dare judge Alia.Of course she's broken the precious Bene Gesserit commandment!What'd you expect?You ran out on her, left her as queen here in all but name.All of that power!So you ran back to Caladan to nurse your wounds in Gurney's arms.Good enough.But who are you to judge Alia?""I tell you, I will not dis  "  "Oh, shut up!"He looked away from her in disgust.But his words had been uttered in that special Bene Gesserit way   the controlling Voice.It silenced her as though a hand had been clapped over her mouth.She thought: Who'd know how to hit me with Voice better than this one?It was a mitigating argument which eased her wounded feelings.As many times as she'd used Voice on others, she'd never expected to be susceptible to it...not ever again...not since the school days when...He turned back to her."I'm sorry.I just happen to know how blindly you can be expected to react when  "  "Blindly?Me?"She was more outraged by this than she'd been by his exquisite use of Voice against her."You," he said."Blindly.If you've any honesty left in you at all, you'll recognize your own reactions.I call your name and you say, 'Yes?'I silence your tongue.I invoke all your Bene Gesserit myths.Look inward the way you were taught.That, at least, is something you can do for your  "  "How dare you!What do you know of... "Her voice trailed off.Of course he knew!"Look inward, I say!"His voice was imperious.Again, his voice enthralled her.She found her senses stilled, felt a quickening of breath.Just beyond awareness lurked a pounding heart, the panting of...Abruptly she realized that the quickened breath, the pounding heart, were not latent, not held at bay by her Bene Gesserit control.Eyes widening in shocked awareness, she felt her own flesh obeying other commands.Slowly she recovered her poise, but the realization remained.This unchild had been playing her like a fine instrument throughout their interview."Now you know how profoundly you were conditioned by your precious Bene Gesserits," he said.She could only nod.Her belief in words lay shattered.Leto had forced her to look her physical universe squarely in the face, and she'd come away shaken, her mind running with a new awareness."Show me his body!"He'd shown her her own body as though it were newborn.Not since her earliest schooling days on Wallach, not since those terrifying days before the Duke's buyers came for her, not since then had she felt such trembling uncertainty about her next moments."You will allow yourself to be abducted," Leto said."But  "  "I'm not asking for discussion on this point," he said."You will allow it.Think of this as a command from your Duke.You'll see the purpose when it's done.You're going to confront a very interesting student. "Leto stood, nodded.He said: "Some actions have an end but no beginning; some begin but do not end.It all depends upon where the observer is standing. "Turning, he left her chambers.In the second anteroom, Leto met Ghanima hurrying into their private quarters.She stopped as she saw him, said: "Alia's busy with the Convocation of the Faith. "She looked a question at the passage which led to Jessica's quarters.= = = = = =   Atrocity is recognized as such by victim and perpetrator alike, by all who learn about it at whatever remove.Atrocity has no excuses, no mitigating argument.Atrocity never balances or rectifies the past.Atrocity merely arms the future for more atrocity.It is self perpetuating upon itself   a barbarous form of incest.Whoever commits atrocity also commits those future atrocities thus bred.The Apocrypha of Muad'Dib   Shortly after noon, when most of the pilgrims had wandered off to refresh themselves in whatever cooling shade and source of libation they could find.The Preacher entered the great square below Alia's Temple.He came on the arm of his surrogate eyes, young Assan Tariq.In a pocket beneath his flowing robe, The Preacher carried the black gauze mask he'd worn on Salusa Secundus.It amused him to think that the mask and the boy served the same purpose   disguise.While he needed surrogate eyes, doubts remained alive.Let the myth grow, but keep doubts alive, he thought.No one must discover that the mask was merely cloth, not an Ixian artifact at all.His hand must not slip from Assan Tariq's bony shoulder.Let The Preacher once walk as the sighted despite his eyeless sockets, and all doubts would dissolve.The small hope he nursed would be dead.Each day he prayed for a change, something different over which he might stumble, but even Salusa Secundus had been a pebble, every aspect known.Nothing changed; nothing could be changed...yet.Many people marked his passage past the shops and arcades, noting the way he turned his head from side to side, holding it centered on a doorway or a person.The movements of his head were not always blind natural, and this added to the growing myth.Alia watched from a concealed slit in the towering battlement of her temple.She searched that scarred visage far below for some sign   a sure sign of identity.Every rumor was reported to her.Each new one came with its thrill of fear.She'd thought her order to take The Preacher captive would remain secret, but that, too, came back to her now as a rumor.Even among her guards, someone could not remain silent.She hoped now that the guards would follow her new orders and not take this robed mystery captive in a public place where it could be seen and reported.It was dusty hot in the square.The Preacher's young guide had pulled the veil of his robe up around his nose, leaving only the dark eyes and a thin patch of forehead exposed.The veil bulged with the outline of a stillsuit's catchtube.This told Alia that they'd come in from the desert.Where did they hide out there?The Preacher wore no veil protection from the searing air.He had even dropped the catchtube flap of his stillsuit.His face lay open to the sunlight and the heat shiverings which lifted off the square's paving blocks in visible waves.At the Temple steps there stood a group of nine pilgrims making their departure obeisance.The shadowed edge of the square held perhaps fifty more persons, mostly pilgrims devoting themselves to various penances imposed by the priesthood.Among the onlookers could be seen messengers and a few merchants who'd not yet made enough sales to close up for the worst of the day's heat.Watching from the open slit, Alia felt the drenching heat and knew herself to be caught between thinking and sensation, the way she'd often seen her brother caught.The temptation to consult within herself rang like an ominous humming in her head.The Baron was there: dutiful, but always ready to play upon her terrors when rational judgment failed and the things around her lost their sense of past, present, and future.What if that's Paul down there?she asked herself."Nonsense!"the voice within her said.But the reports of The Preacher's words could not be doubted.Heresy!It terrified her to think that Paul himself might bring down the structure built on his name.Why not?She thought of what she'd said in Council just that morning, turning viciously upon Irulan, who'd urged acceptance of the gift of clothing from House Corrino."All gifts to the twins will be examined thoroughly, just as always," Irulan had argued."And when we find the gift harmless?"Alia had cried.Somehow that had been the most frightening thing of all: to find that the gift carried no threat.In the end they'd accepted the fine clothing and had gone on to the other issue: Was the Lady Jessica to be given a position on the Council?Alia had managed to delay a vote.She thought of this as she stared down at The Preacher.Things which happened to her Regency now were like the underside of that transformation they inflicted upon this planet.Dune had once symbolized the power of ultimate desert.That power dwindled physically, but the myth of its power grew apace.Only the ocean desert remained, the great Mother Desert of the inner planet, with its rim of thorn bushes, which Fremen still called Queen of Night.Behind the thorn bushes arose soft green hills bending down to the sand.All the hills were man made.Every last one of them had been planted by men who had labored like crawling insects.The green of those hills was almost overpowering to someone raised, as Alia had been, in the tradition of dun shaded sand.In her mind, as in the minds of all Fremen, the ocean desert still held Dune in a grip which would never relax.She had only to close her eyes and she would see that desert.Open eyes at the desert edge saw now the verdant hills, marsh slime reaching out green pseudopods toward the sand   but the other desert remained as powerful as ever.Alia shook her head, stared down at The Preacher.He had mounted the first of the terraced steps below the Temple and turned to face the almost deserted square.Alia touched the button beside her window which would amplify voices from below.She felt a wave of self pity, seeing herself held here in loneliness.Whom could she trust?She'd thought Stilgar remained reliable, but Stilgar had been infected by this blind man."You know how he counts?"Stilgar had asked her."I heard him counting coins as he paid his guide.It's very strange to my Fremen ears, and that's a terrible thing.He counts 'shuc, ishcai, qimsa, chuascu, picha, sucta, and so on.I've not heard counting like that since the old days in the desert. "From this, Alia knew that Stilgar could not be sent to do the job which must be done.And she would have to be circumspect with her guards where the slightest emphasis from the Regency tended to be taken as absolute command.What was he doing down there, this Preacher?The surrounding marketplace beneath its protective balconies and arched arcade still presented a gaudy face: merchandise left on display with a few boys to watch over it.Some few merchants remained awake there sniffing for the spice biscuit money of the back country or the jingle in a pilgrim's purse.Alia studied The Preacher's back.He appeared poised for speech, but something withheld his voice.Why do I stand here watching that ruin in ancient flesh?she asked herself.That mortal wreckage down there cannot he the 'vessel of magnificence' which once was my brother.Frustration bordering on anger filled her.How could she find out about The Preacher, find out for certain without finding out?She was trapped.She dared not reveal more than a passing curiosity about this heretic.Irulan felt it.She'd lost her famous Bene Gesserit poise and screamed in Council: "We've lost the power to think well of ourselves!"Even Stilgar had been shocked.Javid had brought them back to their senses: "We don't have time for such nonsense!"Javid was right.What did it matter how they thought of themselves?All that concerned them was holding onto the Imperial power.But Irulan, recovering her poise, had been even more devastating: "We've lost something vital, I tell you.When we lost it, we lost the ability to make good decisions.We fall upon decisions these days the way we fall upon an enemy   or wait and wait, which is a form of giving up, and we allow the decisions of others to move us.Have we forgotten that we were the ones who set this current flowing?"And all over the question of whether to accept a gift from House Corrino.Irulan will have to be disposed of, Alia decided.What was that old man down there waiting for?He called himself a preacher.Why didn't he preach?Irulan was wrong about our decision making, Alia told herself.I can still make proper decisions!The person with life and death decisions to make must make decisions or remain caught in the pendulum.Paul had always said that stasis was the most dangerous of those things which were not natural.The only permanence was fluid.Change was all that mattered.I'll show them change!Alia thought.The Preacher raised his arms in benediction.A few of those remaining in the square moved closer to him, and Alia noted the slowness of that movement.Yes, the rumors were out that The Preacher had aroused Alia's displeasure.She bent closer to the Ixian speaker beside her spy hole.The speaker brought her the murmurings of the people in the square, the sound of wind, the scratching of feet on sand."I bring you four messages!"The Preacher said.His voice blared from Alia's speaker, and she turned down the volume."Each message is for a certain person," The Preacher said."The first message is for Alia, the suzerain of this place. "He pointed behind him toward her spy hole."I bring her a warning: You, who held the secret of duration in your loins, have sold your future for an empty purse!"How dare he?Alia thought.But his words froze her."My second message," The Preacher said, "is for Stilgar, the Fremen Naib, who believes he can translate the power of the tribes into the power of the Imperium.My warning to you, Stilgar: The most dangerous of all creations is a rigid code of ethics.It will turn upon you and drive you into exile!"He has gone too far!Alia thought.I must send the guards for him no matter the consequences.But her hands remained at her sides.The Preacher turned to face the Temple, climbed to the second step and once more whirled to face the square, all the time keeping his left hand upon the shoulder of his guide.He called out now: "My third message is for the Princess Irulan.Princess!Humiliation is a thing which no person can forget.I warn you to flee!"What's he saying?Alia asked herself.We humiliated Irulan, but...Why does he warn her to flee?My decision was just made!A thrill of fear shot through Alia.How did The Preacher know?"My fourth message is for Duncan Idaho," he shouted."Duncan!You were taught to believe that loyalty buys loyalty.Ohh, Duncan, do not believe in history, because history is impelled by whatever passes for money.Duncan!Take your horns and do what you know best how to do. "Alia chewed the back of her right hand.Horns!She wanted to reach out and press the button which would summon guards, but her hand refused to move."Now I will preach to you," The Preacher said."This is a sermon of the desert.I direct it to the ears of Muad'Dib's priesthood, those who practice the ecumenism of the sword.Ohhh, you believers in manifest destiny!Know you not that manifest destiny has its demoniac side?You cry out that you find yourselves exalted merely to have lived in the blessed generations of Muad'Dib.I say to you that you have abandoned Muad'Dib.Holiness has replaced love in your religion!You court the vengeance of the desert!"The Preacher lowered his head as though in prayer.Alia felt herself shivering with awareness.Gods below!That voice!It had been cracked by years in the burning sands, but it could be the remnant of Paul's voice.Once more The Preacher raised his head.His voice boomed out over the square where more people had begun to gather, attracted by this oddity out of the past."Thus it is written!"The Preacher shouted."They who pray for dew at the desert's edge shall bring forth the deluge!They shall not escape their fate through powers of reason!Reason arises from pride that a man may not know in this way when he has done evil. "He lowered his voice."It was said of Muad'Dib that he died of prescience, that knowledge of the future killed him and he passed from the universe of reality into the alam al mythal.I say to you that this is the illusion of Maya.Such thoughts have no independent reality.They cannot go out from you and do real things.Muad'Dib said of himself that he possessed no Rihani magic with which to encipher the universe.Do not doubt him. "Again The Preacher raised his arms, lifted his voice in a stentorian bellow: "I warn the priesthood of Muad'Dib!The fire on the cliff shall burn you!They who learn the lesson of self deception too well shall perish by that deception.The blood of a brother cannot be cleansed away!"He had lowered his arms, found his young guide, and was leaving the square before Alia could break herself from the trembling immobility which had overcome her.Such fearless heresy!It must be Paul.She had to warn her guards.They dared not move against this Preacher openly.The evidence in the square below her confirmed this.Despite the heresy, no one moved to stop the departing Preacher.No Temple guard leaped to pursue him.No pilgrim tried to stop him.That charismatic blind man!Everyone who saw or heard him felt his power, the reflection of divine talent.In spite of the day's heat, Alia felt suddenly cold.She felt the thin edge of her grip on the Imperium as a physical thing.She gripped the edge of her spy hole window as though to hold her power, thinking of its fragility.The balance of Landsraad, CHOAM, and Fremen arms held the core of power, while Spacing Guild and Bene Gesserit dealt silently in the shadows.The forbidden seepage of technological development which came from the edges of humankind's farthest migrations nibbled at the central power.Products permitted the Ixian and Tleilaxu factories could not relieve the pressure.And always in the wings there stood Farad'n of House Corrino, inheritor of Shaddam TV's titles and claims.Without the Fremen, without House Atreides' monopoly on the geriatric spice, her grip would loosen.All the power would dissolve.She could feel it slipping from her right now.People heeded this Preacher.It would be dangerous to silence him; just as dangerous as it was to let him continue preaching such words as he'd shouted across her square today.She could see the first omens of her own defeat and the pattern of the problem stood out clearly in her mind.The Bene Gesserits had codified the problem:  "A large populace held in check by a small but powerful force is quite a common situation in our universe.And we know the major conditions wherein this large populace may turn upon its keepers    "One: When they find a leader.This is the most volatile threat to the powerful; they must retain control of leaders."Two: When the populace recognizes its chains.Keep the populace blind and unquestioning."Three: When the populace perceives a hope of escape from bondage.They must never even believe that escape is possible!"Alia shook her head, feeling her cheeks tremble with the force of movement.The signs were here in her populace.Every report she received from her spies throughout the Imperium reinforced her certain knowledge.Unceasing warfare of the Fremen Jihad left its mark everywhere.Wherever "the ecumenism of the sword" had touched, people retained the attitude of a subject population: defensive, concealing, evasive.All manifestations of authority   and this meant essentially religious authority   became subject to resentment.Oh, pilgrims still came in their thronging millions, and some among them were probably devout.But for the most part, pilgrimage had other motivations than devotion.Most often it was a canny surety for the future.It emphasized obedience and gained a real form of power which was easily translated into wealth.The Hajji who returned from Arrakis came home to new authority, new social status.The Hajji could make profitable economic decisions which the planet bound of his homeworld dared not challenge.Alia knew the popular riddle: "What do you see inside the empty purse brought home from Dune?"And the answer: "The eyes of Muad'Dib (fire diamonds). "The traditional ways to counter growing unrest paraded themselves before Alia's awareness: people had to be taught that opposition was always punished and assistance to the ruler was always rewarded.Imperial forces must be shifted in random fashion.Major adjuncts to Imperial power had to be concealed.Every movement by which the Regency countered potential attack required delicate timing to keep the opposition off balance.Have I lost my sense of timing?she wondered."What idle speculation is this?"a voice within her asked.She felt herself growing calmer.Yes, the Baron's plan was a good one.We eliminate the threat of the Lady Jessica and, at the same time, we discredit House Corrino.Yes.The Preacher could be dealt with later.She understood his posture.The symbolism was clear.He was the ancient spirit of unbridled speculation, the spirit of heresy alive and functioning in her desert of orthodoxy.That was his strength.It didn't matter whether he was Paul...as long as that could be kept in doubt.But her Bene Gesserit knowledge told Alia that his strength would contain the key to his weakness.The Preacher has a flaw which we will find.I will have him spied upon, watched every moment.And if the opportunity arises, he will be discredited.= = = = = =   I will not argue with the Fremen claims that they are divinely inspired to transmit a religious revelation, it is their concurrent claim to ideological revelation which inspires me to shower them with derision.Of course, they make the dual claim in the hope that it will strengthen their mandarinate and help them to endure in a universe which finds them increasingly oppressive.It is in the name of all those oppressed people that I warn the Fremen: short term expediency always fails in the long term.The Preacher at Arrakeen   Leto had come up in the night with Stilgar to the narrow ledge at the crest of the low rock outcropping which Sietch Tabr called The Attendant.Under the waning light of Second Moon, the ledge gave them a panoramic view   the Shield Wall with Mount Idaho to the north, the Great Flat to the south and rolling dunes eastward toward Habbanya Ridge.Winding dust, the aftermath of a storm, hid the southern horizon.Moonlight frosted the rim of the Shield Wall.Stilgar had come against his will, joining the secretive venture finally because Leto aroused his curiosity.Why was it necessary to risk a sand crossing in the night?The lad had threatened to sneak away and make the journey alone if Stilgar refused.The way of it bothered him profoundly, though.Two such important targets alone in the night!Leto squatted on the ledge facing south toward the flat.Occasionally he pounded his knee as though in frustration.Stilgar waited.He was good at silent waiting, and stood two paces to one side of his charge, arms folded, his robe moving softly in the night breeze.For Leto, the sand crossing represented a response to inner desperation, a need to seek a new alignment for his life in a silent conflict which Ghanima could no longer risk.He had maneuvered Stilgar into sharing the journey because there were things Stilgar had to know in preparation for the days ahead.Again Leto pounded his knee.It was difficult to know a beginning!He felt, at times, like an extension of those countless other lives, all as real and immediate as his own.In the flow of those lives there was no ending, no accomplishment   only eternal beginning.They could be a mob, too, clamoring at him as though he were a single window through which each desired to peer.And there lay the peril which had destroyed Alia.Leto stared outward at the moonlight silvering the storm remnants.Folds and overfolds of dunes spread across the flat: silica grit measured out by the winds, mounded into waves   pea sand, grit sand, pebbles.He felt himself caught in one of those poised moments just before dawn.Time pressed at him.It was already the month of Akkad and behind him lay the last of an interminable waiting time: long hot days and hot dry winds, nights like this one tormented by gusts and endless blowings from the furnace lands of the Hawkbled.He glanced over his shoulder toward the Shield Wall, a broken line in starlight.Beyond that wall in the Northern Sink lay the focus of his problems.Once more he looked to the desert.As he stared into the hot darkness, day dawned, the sun rising out of dust scarves and placing a touch of lime into the storm's red streamers.He closed his eyes, willing himself to see how this day would appear from Arrakeen, and the city lay there in his consciousness, caught up like a scattering of boxes between the light and the new shadows.Desert...boxes...desert...boxes...When he opened his eyes, the desert remained: a spreading curry expanse of wind kicked sand.Oily shadows along the base of each dune reached out like rays of the night just past.They linked one time with the other.He thought of the night, squatting here with Stilgar restless beside him, the older man worried at the silence and the unexplained reasons for coming to this place.Stilgar must have many memories of passing this way with his beloved Muad'Dib.Even now Stilgar was moving, scanning all around, alert for dangers.Stilgar did not like the open in daylight.He was pure old Fremen in that.Leto's mind was reluctant to leave the night and the clean exertions of a sand crossing.Once here in the rocks, the night had taken on its black stillness.He sympathized with Stilgar's daylight fears.Black was a single thing even when it contained boiling terrors.Light could be many things.Night held its fear smells and its things which came with slithering sounds.Dimensions separated in the night, everything amplified   thorns sharper, blades more cutting.But terrors of the day could be worse.Stilgar cleared his throat.Leto spoke without turning: "I have a very serious problem, Stil. ""So I surmised. "The voice beside Leto came low and wary.The child had sounded disturbingly of the father.It was a thing of forbidden magic which touched a cord of revulsion in Stilgar.Fremen knew the terrors of possession.Those found possessed were rightfully killed and their water cast upon the sand lest it contaminate the tribal cistern.The dead should remain dead.It was correct to find one's immortality in children, but children had no right to assume too exact a shape from their past."My problem is that my father left so many things undone," Leto said."Especially the focus of our lives.The Empire cannot go on this way, Stil, without a proper focus for human life.I am speaking of life, you understand?Life, not death. ""Once, when he was troubled by a vision, your father spoke in this vein to me," Stilgar said.Leto found himself tempted to pass off that questioning fear beside him with a light response, perhaps a suggestion that they break their fast.He realized that he was very hungry.They had eaten the previous noon and Leto had insisted on fasting through the night.But another hunger drew him now.The trouble with my life is the trouble with this place, Leto thought.No preliminary creation.I just go back and back and back until distances fade away.I cannot see the horizon; I cannot see Habbanya Ridge.I can't find the original place of testing."There's really no substitute for prescience," Leto said."Perhaps I should risk the spice... ""And be destroyed as your father was?""A dilemma," Leto said."Once your father confided in me that knowing the future too well was to be locked into that future to the exclusion of any freedom to change. ""The paradox which is our problem," Leto said."It's a subtle and powerful thing, prescience.The future becomes now.To be sighted in the land of the blind carries its own perils.If you try to interpret what you see for the blind, you tend to forget that the blind possess an inherent movement conditioned by their blindness.They are like a monstrous machine moving along its own path.They have their own momentum, their own fixations.I fear the blind, Stil.I fear them.They can so easily crush anything in their path. "Stilgar stared at the desert.Lime dawn had become steel day.He said: "Why have we come to this place?""Because I wanted you to see the place where I may die. "Stilgar tensed.Then: "So you have had a vision!""Perhaps it was only a dream. ""Why do we come to such a dangerous place?"Stilgar glared down at his charge."We will return at once. ""I won't die today, Stil. ""No?What was this vision?""I saw three paths," Leto said.His voice came out with the sleepy sound of remembrance."One of those futures requires me to kill our grandmother. "Stilgar shot a sharp glance back toward Sietch Tabr, as though he feared the Lady Jessica could hear them across the sandy distance."Why?""To keep from losing the spice monopoly. ""I don't understand. ""Nor do I.  But that is the thought of my dream when I use the knife. ""Oh. "Stilgar understood the use of a knife.He drew a deep breath."What is the second path?""Ghani and I marry to seal the Atreides bloodline. ""Ghaaa!"Stilgar expelled his breath in a violent expression of distaste."It was usual in ancient times for kings and queens to do this," Leto said."Ghani and I have decided we will not breed. ""I warn you to hold fast in that decision!"There was death in Stilgar's voice.By Fremen Law, incest was punishable by death on the hanging tripod.He cleared his throat, asked: "And the third path?""I am called to reduce my father to human stature. ""He was my friend, Muad'Dib," Stilgar muttered."He was your god!I must undeify him. "Stilgar turned his back on the desert, stared toward the oasis of his beloved Sietch Tabr.Such talk always disturbed him.Leto sensed the sweaty smell of Stilgar's movement.It was such a temptation to avoid the purposeful things which had to be said here.They could talk half the day away, moving from the specific to the abstract as through drawn away from real decisions, from those immediate necessities which confronted them.And there was no doubt that House Corrino posed a real threat to real lives   his own and Ghani's.But everything he did now had to be weighed and tested against the secret necessities.Stilgar once had voted to have Farad'n assassinated, holding out for the subtle application of chaumurky: poison administered in a drink.Farad'n was known to be partial to certain sweet liquors.That could not be permitted."If I die here, Stil," Leto said, "you must beware of Alia.She is no longer your friend. ""What is this talk of death and your aunt?"Now Stilgar was truly outraged.Kill the Lady Jessica!Beware of Alia!Die in this place!"Small men change their faces at her command," Leto said."A ruler need not be a prophet, Stil.Nor even godlike.A ruler need only be sensitive.I brought you here with me to clarify what our Imperium requires.It requires good government.That does not depend upon laws or precedent, but upon the personal qualities of whoever governs. ""The Regency handles its Imperial duties quite well," Stilgar said."When you come of age  "  "I am of age!I'm the oldest person here!You're a puling infant beside me.I can remember times more than fifty centuries past.Hah!I can even remember when we Fremen were on Thurgrod. ""Why do you play with such fancies?"Stilgar demanded, his tone peremptory.Leto nodded to himself.Why indeed?Why recount his memories of those other centuries?Today's Fremen were his immediate problem, most of them still only half tamed savages, prone to laugh at unlucky innocence."The crysknife dissolves at the death of its owner," Leto said."Muad'Dib has dissolved.Why are the Fremen still alive?"It was one of those abrupt thought changes which so confounded Stilgar.He found himself temporarily dumb.Such words contained meaning, but their intent eluded him."I am expected to be Emperor, but I must be the servant," Leto said.He glanced across his shoulder at Stilgar."My grandfather for whom I was named added new words to his coat of arms when he came here to Dune: 'Here I am; here I remain. '"  "He had no choice," Stilgar said."Very good, Stil.Nor have I any choice.I should be the Emperor by birth, by the fitness of my understanding, by all that has gone into me.I even know what the Imperium requires: good government. ""Naib has an ancient meaning," Stilgar said."It is 'servant of the Sietch. '"  "I remember your training, Stil," Leto said."For proper government, the tribe must have ways to choose men whose lives reflect the way a government should behave. "From the depths of his Fremen soul, Stilgar said: "You'll assume the Imperial Mantle if it's meet.First you must prove that you can behave in the fashion of a ruler!"Unexpectedly, Leto laughed.Then: "Do you doubt my sincerity, Stil?""Of course not. ""My birthright?""You are who you are. ""And if I do what is expected of me, that is the measure of my sincerity, eh?""It is the Fremen practice. ""Then I cannot have inner feelings to guide my behavior?""I don't understand what  "  "If I always behave with propriety, no matter what it costs me to suppress my own desires, then that is the measure of me. ""Such is the essence of self control, youngster. ""Youngster!"Leto shook his head."Ahhh, Stil, you provide me with the key to a rational ethic of government.I must be constant, every action rooted in the traditions of the past. ""That is proper. ""But my past goes deeper than yours!""What difference  "  "I have no first person singular, Stil.I am a multiple person with memories of traditions more ancient than you could imagine.That's my burden, Stil.I'm past directed.I'm abrim with innate knowledge which resists newness and change.Yet Muad'Dib changed all this. "He gestured at the desert, his arm sweeping to encompass the Shield Wall behind him.Stilgar turned to peer at the Shield Wall.A village had been built beneath the wall since Muad'Dib's time, houses to shelter a planetology crew helping spread plant life into the desert.Stilgar stared at the man made intrusion into the landscape.Change?Yes.There was an alignment to the village, a trueness which offended him.He stood silently, ignoring the itching of grit particles under his stillsuit.That village was an offense against the thing this planet had been.Suddenly Stilgar wanted a circular howling of wind to leap over the dunes and obliterate that place.The sensation left him trembling.Leto said: "Have you noticed, Stil, that the new stillsuits are of sloppy manufacture?Our water loss is too high. "Stilgar stopped himself on the point of asking: Have I not said it?Instead he said: "Our people grow increasingly dependent upon the pills. "Leto nodded.The pills shifted body temperature, reduced water loss.They were cheaper and easier than stillsuits.But they inflicted the user with other burdens, among them a tendency to slowed reaction time, occasional blurred vision."Is that why we came out here?"Stilgar asked."To discuss stillsuit manufacture?""Why not?"Leto asked."Since you will not face what I must talk about. ""Why must I beware of your aunt?"Anger edged his voice."Because she plays upon the old Fremen desire to resist charge, yet would bring more terrible change than you can imagine. ""You make much out of little!She's a proper Fremen. ""Ahhh, then the proper Fremen holds to the ways of the past and I have an ancient past.Stil, were I to give free reign to this inclination, I would demand a closed society, completely dependent upon the sacred ways of the past.I would control migration, explaining that this fosters new ideas, and new ideas are a threat to the entire structure of life.Each little planetary polis would go its own way, becoming what it would.Finally the Empire would shatter under the weight of its differences. "Stilgar tried to swallow in a dry throat.These were words which Muad'Dib might have produced.They had his ring to them.They were paradox, frightening.But if one allowed any change...He shook his head."The past may show the right way to behave if you live in the past, Stil, but circumstances change. "Stilgar could only agree that circumstances did change.How must one behave then?He looked beyond Leto, seeing the desert and not seeing it.Muad'Dib had walked there.The flat was a place of golden shadows as the sun climbed, purple shadows, gritty rivulets crested in dust vapors.The dust fog which usually hung over Habbanya Ridge was visible in the far distance now, and the desert between presented his eyes with dunes diminishing, one curve into another.Through the smoky shimmer of heat he saw the plants which crept out from the desert edge.Muad'Dib had caused life to sprout in that desolate place.Copper, gold, red flowers, yellow flowers, rust and russet, grey green leaves, spikes and harsh shadows beneath bushes.The motion of the day's heat set shadows quivering, vibrating in the air.Presently Stilgar said: "I am only a leader of Fremen; you are the son of a Duke. ""Not knowing what you said, you said it," Leto said.Stilgar scowled.Once, long ago, Muad'Dib had chided him thus."You remember it, don't you, Stil?"Leto asked."We were under Habbanya Ridge and the Sardaukar captain   remember him: Aramsham?He killed his friend to save himself.And you warned several times that day about preserving the lives of Sardaukar who'd seen our secret ways.Finally you said they would surely reveal what they'd seen; they must be killed.And my father said: 'Not knowing what you said, you said it. 'And you were hurt.You told him you were only a simple leader of Fremen.Dukes must know more important things. "Stilgar stared down at Leto.We were under Habbanya Ridge!We!This...this child, not even conceived on that day, knew what had taken place in exact detail, the kind of detail which could only be known to someone who had been there.It was only another proof that these Atreides children could not be judged by ordinary standards."Now you will listen to me," Leto said."If I die or disappear in the desert, you are to flee from Sietch Tabr.I command it.You are to take Ghani and  "  "You are not yet my Duke!You're a. ..a child!""I'm an adult in a child's flesh," Leto said.He pointed down to a narrow crack in the rocks below them."If I die here, it will be in that place.You will see the blood.You will know then.Take my sister and  "  "I'm doubling your guard," Stilgar said."You're not coming out here again.We are leaving now and you  "  "Stil!You cannot hold me.Turn your mind once more to that time at Habbanya Ridge.Remember?The factory crawler was out there on the sand and a big Maker was coming.There was no way to save the crawler from the worm.And my father was annoyed that he couldn't save that crawler.But Gurney could think only of the men he'd lost in the sand.Remember what he said: 'Your father would've been more concerned for the men he couldn't save. 'Stil, I charge you to save people.They're more important than things.And Ghani is the most precious of all because, without me, she is the only hope for the Atreides. ""I will hear no more," Stilgar said.He turned and began climbing down the rocks toward the oasis across the sand.He heard Leto following.Presently Leto passed him and, glancing back, said: "Have you noticed, Stil, how beautiful the young women are this year?"= = = = = =   The life of a single human, as the life of a family or an entire people, persists as memory.My people must come to see this as part of their maturing process.They are people as organism, and in this persistent memory they store more and more experiences in a subliminal reservoir.Humankind hopes to call upon this material if it is needed for a changing universe.But much that is stored can be lost in that chance play of accident which we call "fate. "Much may not be integrated into evolutionary relationships, and thus may not be evaluated and keyed into activity by those ongoing environmental changes which inflict themselves upon flesh.The species can forget!This is the special value of the Kwisatz Haderach which the Bene Gesserits never suspected: the Kwisatz Haderach cannot forget.The Book of Leto, After Harq al Ada   Stilgar could not explain it, but he found Leto's casual observation profoundly disturbing.It ground through his awareness all the way back across the sand to Sietch Tabr, taking precedence over everything else Leto had said out there on The Attendant.Indeed, the young women of Arrakis were very beautiful that year.And the young men, too.Their faces glowed serenely with water richness.Their eyes looked outward and far.They exposed their features often without any pretense of stillsuit masks and the snaking lines of catchtubes.Frequently they did not even wear stillsuits in the open, preferring the new garments which, as they moved, offered flickering suggestions of the lithe young bodies beneath.Such human beauty was set off against the new beauty of the landscape.By contrast with the old Arrakis, the eye could be spellbound by its collision with a tiny clump of green twigs growing among red brown rocks.And the old sietch warrens of the cave metropolis culture, complete with elaborate seals and moisture traps at every entrance, were giving way to open villages built often of mud bricks.Mud bricks!Why did I want the village destroyed?Stilgar wondered, and he stumbled as he walked.He knew himself to be of a dying breed.Old Fremen gasped in wonder at the prodigality of their planet   water wasted into the air for no more than its ability to mold building bricks.The water for a single one family dwelling would keep an entire sietch alive for a year.The new buildings even had transparent windows to let in the sun's heat and to desiccate the bodies within.Such windows opened outward.New Fremen within their mud homes could look out upon their landscape.They no longer were enclosed and huddling in a sietch.Where the new vision moved, there also moved the imagination.Stilgar could feel this.The new vision joined Fremen to the rest of the Imperial universe, conditioned them to unbounded space.Once they'd been tied to water poor Arrakis by their enslavement to its bitter necessities.They'd not shared that open mindedness which conditioned inhabitants on most planets of the Imperium.Stilgar could see the changes contrasting with his own doubts and fears.In the old days it had been a rare Fremen who even considered the possibility that he might leave Arrakis to begin a new life on one of the water rich worlds.They'd not even been permitted the dream of escape.He watched Leto's moving back as the youth walked ahead.Leto had spoken of prohibitions against movement off planet.Well, that had always been a reality for most other worlders, even where the dream was permitted as a safety valve.But planetary serfdom had reached its peak here on Arrakis.Fremen had turned inward, barricaded in their minds as they were barricaded in their cave warrens.The very meaning of sietch   a place of sanctuary in times of trouble   had been perverted here into a monstrous confinement for an entire population.Leto spoke the truth: Muad'Dib had changed all that.Stilgar felt lost, He could feel his old beliefs crumbling.The new outward vision produced life which desired to move away from containment."How beautiful the young women are this year. "The old ways (My ways!he admitted) had forced his people to ignore all history except that which turned inward onto their own travail.The old Fremen had read history out of their own terrible migrations, their flights from persecution into persecution.The old planetary government had followed the stated policy of the old Imperium.They had suppressed creativity and all sense of progress, of evolution.Prosperity had been dangerous to the old Imperium and its holders of power.With an abrupt shock, Stilgar realized that these things were equally dangerous to the course which Alia was setting.Again Stilgar stumbled and fell farther behind Leto.In the old ways and old religions, there'd been no future, only an endless now.Before Muad'Dib, Stilgar saw, the Fremen had been conditioned to believe in failure, never in the possibility of accomplishment.
