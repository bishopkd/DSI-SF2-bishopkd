What diversion does mLord wish?Ill be in my sleeping chambers, the Baron said.Bring me that young fellow we bought on Gamont, the one with the lovely eyes.Drug him well.I dont feel like wrestling.Yes, mLord.The Baron turned away, began moving with his bouncing, suspensor buoyed pace toward his chambers.Yes, he thought.The one with the lovely eyes, the one who looks so much like the young Paul Atreides.O Seas of Caladan,  O people of Duke Leto  Citadel of Leto fallen,  Fallen forever   from Songs of MuadDib by the Princess Irulan    Paul felt that all his past, every experience before this night, had become sand curling in an hourglass.He sat near his mother hugging his knees within a small fabric and plastic hutment  a stilltent  that had come, like the Fremen clothing they now wore, from the pack left in the thopter.There was no doubt in Pauls mind who had put the Fremkit there, who had directed the course of the thopter carrying them captive.Yueh.The traitor doctor had sent them directly into the hands of Duncan Idaho.Paul stared out the transparent end of the stilltent at the moonshadowed rocks that ringed this place where Idaho had hidden them.Hiding like a child when Im now the Duke, Paul thought.He felt the thought gall him, but could not deny the wisdom in what they did.Something had happened to his awareness this night  he saw with sharpened clarity every circumstance and occurrence around him.He felt unable to stop the inflow of data or the cold precision with which each new item was added to his knowledge and the computation was centered in his awareness.It was Mentat power and more.Paul thought back to the moment of impotent rage as the strange thopter dived out of the night onto them, stooping like a giant hawk above the desert with wind screaming through its wings.The thing in Pauls mind had happened then.The thopter had skidded and slewed across a sand ridge toward the running figures  his mother and himself.Paul remembered how the smell of burned sulfur from abrasion of thopter skids against sand had drifted across them.His mother, he knew, had turned, expected to meet a lasgun in the hands of Harkonnen mercenaries, and had recognized Duncan Idaho leaning out the thopters open door shouting: Hurry!Theres wormsign south of you!But Paul had known as he turned who piloted the thopter.An accumulation of minutiae in the way it was flown, the dash of the landing  clues so small even his mother hadnt detected them  had told Paul precisely who sat at those controls.Across the stilltent from Paul, Jessica stirred, said: There can be only one explanation.The Harkonnens held Yuehs wife.He hated the Harkonnens!I cannot be wrong about that.You read his note.But why has he saved us from the carnage?She is only now seeing it and that poorly, Paul thought.The thought was a shock.He had known this fact as a by the way thing while reading the note that had accompanied the ducal signet in the pack.Do not try to forgive me, Yueh had written.I do not want your forgiveness.I already have enough burdens.What I have done was done without malice or hope of anothers understanding.It is my own tahaddi al burhan, my ultimate test.I give you the Atreides ducal signet as token that I write truly.By the time you read this, Duke Leto will be dead.Take consolation from my assurance that he did not die alone, that one we hate above all others died with him.It had not been addressed or signed, but thered been no mistaking the familiar scrawl  Yuehs.Remembering the letter, Paul re experienced the distress of that moment  a thing sharp and strange that seemed to happen outside his new mental alertness.He had read that his father was dead, known the truth of the words, but had felt them as no more than another datum to be entered in his mind and used.I loved my father, Paul thought, and knew this for truth.I should mourn him.I should feel something.But he felt nothing except: Heres an important fact.It was one with all the other facts.All the while his mind was adding sense impressions, extrapolating, computing.Hallecks words came back to Paul: Moods a thing for cattle or for making love.You fight when the necessity arises, no matter your mood.Perhaps thats it, Paul thought.Ill mourn my father later  when theres time.But he felt no letup in the cold precision of his being.He sensed that his new awareness was only a beginning, that it was growing.The sense of terrible purpose hed first experienced in his ordeal with the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam pervaded him.His right hand  the hand of remembered pain  tingled and throbbed.Is this what it is to be their Kwisatz Haderach?he wondered.For a while, I thought Hawat had failed us again, Jessica said.I thought perhaps Yueh wasnt a Suk doctor.He was everything we thought him  and more, Paul said.And he thought: Why is she so slow seeing these things?He said, If Idaho doesnt get through to Kynes, well be  Hes not our only hope, she said.Such was not my suggestion, he said.She heard the steel in his voice, the sense of command, and stared across the grey darkness of the stilltent at him.Paul was a silhouette against moonfrosted rocks seen through the tents transparent end.Others among your fathers men will have escaped, she said.We must regather them, find  We will depend upon ourselves, he said.Our immediate concern is our family atomics.We must get them before the Harkonnens can search them out.Not likely theyll be found, she said, the way they were hidden.It must not be left to chance.And she thought: Blackmail with the family atomics as a threat to the planet and its spice  thats what he has in mind.But all he can hope for then is escape into renegade anonymity.His mothers words had provoked another train of thought in Paul  a dukes concern for all the people theyd lost this night.People are the true strength of a Great House, Paul thought.And he remembered Hawats words: Parting with people is a sadness; a place is only a place.Theyre using Sardaukar, Jessica said.We must wait until the Sardaukar have been withdrawn.They think us caught between the desert and the Sardaukar, Paul said.They intend that there be no Atreides survivors  total extermination.Do not count on any of our people escaping.They cannot go on indefinitely risking exposure of the Emperors part in this.Cant they?Some of our people are bound to escape.Are they?Jessica turned away, frightened of the bitter strength in her sons voice, hearing the precise assessment of chances.She sensed that his mind had leaped ahead of her, that it now saw more in some respects than she did.She had helped train the intelligence which did this, but now she found herself fearful of it.Her thoughts turned, seeking toward the lost sanctuary of her Duke, and tears burned her eyes.This is the way it had to be, Leto, she thought.A time of love and a time of grief.She rested her hand on her abdomen, awareness focused on the embryo there.I have the Atreides daughter I was ordered to produce, but the Reverend Mother was wrong: a daughter wouldnt have saved my Leto.This child is only life reaching for the future in the midst of death.I conceived out of instinct and not out of obedience.Try the communinet receiver again, Paul said.The mind goes on working no matter how we try to hold it back, she thought.Jessica found the tiny receiver Idaho had left for them, flipped its switch.A green light glowed on the instruments face.Tinny screeching came from its speaker.She reduced the volume, hunted across the bands.A voice speaking Atreides battle language came into the tent.back and regroup at the ridge.Fedor reports no survivors in Carthag and the Guild Bank has been sacked.Carthag!Jessica thought.That was a Harkonnen hotbed.Theyre Sardaukar, the voice said.Watch out for Sardaukar in Atreides uniforms.Theyre   A roaring filled the speaker, then silence.Try the other bands, Paul said.Do you realize what that means?Jessica asked.I expected it.They want the Guild to blame us for destruction of their bank.With the Guild against us, were trapped on Arrakis.Try the other bands.She weighed his words: I expected it.What had happened to him?Slowly, Jessica returned to the instrument.As she moved the bandslide, they caught glimpses of violence in the few voices calling out in Atreides battle language:  fall back   try to regroup at  trapped in a cave at   And there was no mistaking the victorious exultation in the Harkonnen gibberish that poured from the other bands.Sharp commands, battle reports.There wasnt enough of it for Jessica to register and break the language, but the tone was obvious.Harkonnen victory.Paul shook the pack beside him, hearing the two literjons of water gurgle there.He took a deep breath, looked up through the transparent end of the tent at the rock escarpment outlined against the stars.His left hand felt the sphincter seal of the tents entrance.Itll be dawn soon, he said.We can wait through the day for Idaho, but not through another night.In the desert, you must travel by night and rest in shade through the day.Remembered lore insinuated itself into Jessicas mind: Without a stillsuit, a man sitting in shade on the desert needs five liters of water a day to maintain body weight.She felt the slick soft skin of the stillsuit against her body, thinking how their lives depended on these garments.If we leave here, Idaho cant find us, she said.There are ways to make any man talk, he said.If Idaho hasnt returned by dawn, we must consider the possibility he has been captured.How long do you think he could hold out?The question required no answer, and she sat in silence.Paul lifted the seal on the pack, pulled out a tiny micromanual with glowtab and magnifier.Green and orange letters leaped up at him from the pages: literjons, stilltent, energy caps, recaths, sandsnork, binoculars, stillsuit repkit, baradye pistol, sinkchart, filt plugs, paracompass, maker hooks, thumpers, Fremkit, fire pillar   So many things for survival on the desert.Presently, he put the manual aside on the tent floor.Where can we possibly go?Jessica asked.My father spoke of desert power, Paul said.The Harkonnens cannot rule this planet without it.Theyve never ruled this planet, nor shall they.Not even with ten thousand legions of Sardaukar.Paul, you cant think that  Weve all the evidence in our hands, he said.Right here in this tent  the tent itself, this pack and its contents, these stillsuits.We know the Guild wants a prohibitive price for weather satellites.We know that  Whatve weather satellites to do with it?she asked.They couldnt possibly  She broke off.Paul sensed the hyperalertness of his mind reading her reactions, computing on minutiae.You see it now, he said.Satellites watch the terrain below.There are things in the deep desert that will not bear frequent inspection.Youre suggesting the Guild itself controls this planet?She was so slow.No!he said.The Fremen!Theyre paying the Guild for privacy, paying in a coin thats freely available to anyone with desert power  spice.This is more than a second approximation answer; its the straight line computation.Depend on it.Paul, Jessica said, youre not a Mentat yet; you cant know for sure how  Ill never be a Mentat, he said.Im something else  a freak.Paul!How can you say such  Leave me alone!He turned away from her, looking out into the night.Why cant I mourn?he wondered.He felt that every fiber of his being craved this release, but it would be denied him forever.Jessica had never heard such distress in her sons voice.She wanted to reach out to him, hold him, comfort him, help him  but she sensed there was nothing she could do.He had to solve this problem by himself.The glowing tab of the Fremkit manual between them on the tent floor caught her eye.She lifted it, glanced at the flyleaf, reading: Manual of The Friendly Desert, the place full of life.Here are the ayat and burhan of Life.Believe, and al Lat shall never burn you.It reads like the Azhar Book, she thought, recalling her studies of the Great Secrets.Has a Manipulator of Religions been on Arrakis?Paul lifted the paracompass from the pack, returned it, said: Think of all these special application Fremen machines.They show unrivaled sophistication.Admit it, the culture that made these things betrays depths no one suspected.Hesitating, still worried by the harshness in his voice, Jessica returned to the book, studied an illustrated constellation from the Arrakeen sky: MuadDib: The Mouse, and noted that the tail pointed north.Paul stared into the tents darkness at the dimly discerned movements of his mother revealed by the manuals glowtab.Now is the time to carry out my father s wish, he thought.I must give her his message now while she has time for grief.Grief would inconvenience us later.And he found himself shocked by precise logic.Mother, he said.Yes?She heard the change in his voice, felt coldness in her entrails at the sound.Never had she heard such harsh control.My father is dead, he said.She searching within herself for the coupling of fact and fact and fact  the Bene Gesserit way of assessing data  and it came to her: the sensation of terrifying loss.Jessica nodded, unable to speak.My father charged me once, Paul said, to give you a message if anything happened to him.He feared you might believe he distrusted you.That useless suspicion, she thought.He wanted you to know he never suspected you, Paul said, and explained the deception, adding: He wanted you to know he always trusted you completely, always loved you and cherished you.He said he would sooner have mistrusted himself and he had but one regret  that he never made you his Duchess.She brushed the tears coursing down her cheeks, thought: What a stupid waste of the bodys water!But she knew this thought for what it was  the attempt to retreat from grief into anger.Leto, my Leto, she thought.What terrible things we do to those we love!With a violent motion, she extinguished the little manuals glowtab.Sobs shook her.Paul heard his mothers grief and felt the emptiness within himself.I have no grief, he thought.Why?Why?He felt the inability to grieve as a terrible flaw.A time to get and a time to lose, Jessica thought, quoting to herself from the O. C.  Bible.A time to keep and a time to cast away; a time for love and a time to hate; a time of war and a time of peace.Pauls mind had gone on in its chilling precision.He saw the avenues ahead of them on this hostile planet.Without even the safety valve of dreaming, he focused his prescient awareness, seeing it as a computation of most probable futures, but with something more, an edge of mystery  as though his mind dipped into some timeless stratum and sampled the winds of the future.Abruptly, as though he had found a necessary key, Pauls mind climbed another notch in awareness.He felt himself clinging to this new level, clutching at a precarious hold and peering about.It was as though he existed within a globe with avenues radiating away in all directions  yet this only approximated the sensation.He remembered once seeing a gauze kerchief blowing in the wind and now he sensed the future as though it twisted across some surface as undulant and impermanent as that of the windblown kerchief.He saw people.He felt the heat and cold of uncounted probabilities.He knew names and places, experienced emotions without number, reviewed data of innumerable unexplored crannies.There was time to probe and test and taste, but no time to shape.The thing was a spectrum of possibilities from the most remote past to the most remote future  from the most probable to the most improbable.He saw his own death in countless ways.He saw new planets, new cultures.People.People.He saw them in such swarms they could not be listed, yet his mind catalogued them.Even the Guildsmen.And he thought: The Guild  thered be a way for us, my strangeness accepted as a familiar thing of high value, always with an assured supply of the now necessary spice.But the idea of living out his life in the mind groping ahead through possible futures that guided hurtling spaceships appalled him.It was a way, though.And in meeting the possible future that contained Guildsmen he recognized his own strangeness.I have another kind of sight.I see another kind of terrain: the available paths.The awareness conveyed both reassurance and alarm  so many places on that other kind of terrain dipped or turned out of his sight.As swiftly as it had come, the sensation slipped away from him, and he realized the entire experience had taken the space of a heartbeat.Yet, his own personal awareness had been turned over, illuminated in a terrifying way.He stared around him.Night still covered the stilltent within its rock enclosed hideaway.His mothers grief could still be heard.His own lack of grief could still be felt  that hollow place somewhere separated from his mind, which went on in its steady pace  dealing with data, evaluating, computing, submitting answers in something like the Mentat way.And now he saw that he had a wealth of data few such minds ever before had encompassed.But this made the empty place within him no easier to bear.He felt that something must shatter.It was as though a clockwork control for a bomb had been set to ticking within him.It went on about its business no matter what he wanted.It recorded minuscule shadings of difference around him  a slight change in moisture, a fractional fall in temperature, the progress of an insect across their stilltent roof, the solemn approach of dawn in the starlight patch of sky he could see out the tents transparent end.The emptiness was unbearable.Knowing how the clockwork had been set in motion made no difference.He could look to his own past and see the start of it  the training, the sharpening of talents, the refined pressures of sophisticated disciplines, even exposure to the O. C.  Bible at a critical moment  and, lastly, the heavy intake of spice.And he could look ahead  the most terrifying direction  to see where it all pointed.Im a monster!he thought.A freak!No, he said.Then: No.No!NO!He found that he was pounding the tent floor with his fists.(The implacable part of him recorded this as an interesting emotional datum and fed it into computation. )Paul!His mother was beside him, holding his hands, her face a gray blob peering at him.Paul, whats wrong?You!he said.Im here, Paul, she said.Its all right.What have you done to me?he demanded.In a burst of clarity, she sensed some of the roots in the question, said: I gave birth to you.It was, from instinct as much as her own subtle knowledge, the precisely correct answer to calm him.He felt her hands holding him, focused on the dim outline of her face.(Certain gene traces in her facial structure were noted in the new way by his onflowing mind, the clues added to other data, and a final summation answer put forward. )Let go of me, he said.She heard the iron in his voice, obeyed.Do you want to tell me whats wrong, Paul?Did you know what you were doing when you trained me?he asked.Theres no more childhood in his voice, she thought.And she said: I hoped the thing any parent hopes  that youd be  superior, different.Different?She heard the bitterness in his tone, said: Paul, I  You didnt want a son!he said.You wanted a Kwisatz Haderach!You wanted a male Bene Gesserit!She recoiled from his bitterness.But Paul   Did you ever consult my father in this?She spoke gently out of the freshness of her grief: Whatever you are, Paul, the heredity is as much your father as me.But not the training, he said.Not the things that  awakened  the sleeper.Sleeper?Its here.He put a hand on his head and then to his breast.In me.It goes on and on and on and on and  Paul!She had heard the hysteria edging his voice.Listen to me, he said.You wanted the Reverend Mother to hear about my dreams?You listen in her place now.Ive just had a waking dream.Do you know why?You must calm yourself, she said.If theres  The spice, he said.Its in everything here  the air, the soil, the food.The geriatric spice.Its like the Truthsayer drug.Its a poison!She stiffened.His voice lowered and he repeated: A poison  so subtle, so insidious  so irreversible.It wont even kill you unless you stop taking it.We cant leave Arrakis unless we take part of Arrakis with us.The terrifying presence of his voice brooked no dispute.You and the spice, Paul said.The spice changes anyone who gets this much of it, but thanks to you, I could bring the change to consciousness.I dont get to leave it in the unconscious where its disturbance can be blanked out.I can see it.Paul, you  I see it!he repeated.She heard madness in his voice, didnt know what to do.But he spoke again, and she heard the iron control return to him: Were trapped here.Were trapped here, she agreed.And she accepted the truth of his words.No pressure of the Bene Gesserit, no trickery or artifice could pry them completely free from Arrakis: the spice was addictive.Her body had known the fact long before her mind awakened to it.So here we live out our lives, she thought, on this hell planet.The place is prepared for us, if we can evade the Harkonnens.And theres no doubt of my course: a broodmare preserving an important bloodline for the Bene Gesserit Plan.I must tell you about my waking dream, Paul said.(Now there was fury in his voice. )To be sure you accept what I say, Ill tell you first I know youll bear a daughter, my sister, here on Arrakis.Jessica placed her hands against the tent floor, pressed back against the curving fabric wall to still a pang of fear.She knew her pregnancy could not show yet.Only her own Bene Gesserit training had allowed her to read the first faint signals of her body, to know of the embryo only a few weeks old.Only to serve, Jessica whispered, clinging to the Bene Gesserit motto.We exist only to serve.Well find a home among the Fremen, Paul said, where your Missionaria Protectiva has bought us a bolt hole.Theyve prepared a way for us in the desert, Jessica told herself.But how can he know of the Missionaria Protectiva?She found it increasingly difficult to subdue her terror at the overpowering strangeness in Paul.He studied the dark shadow of her, seeing her fear and every reaction with his new awareness as though she were outlined in blinding light.A beginning of compassion for her crept over him.The things that can happen here, I cannot begin to tell you, he said.I cannot even begin to tell myself, although Ive seen them.This sense of the future  I seem to have no control over it.The thing just happens.The immediate future  say, a year  I can see some of that  a road as broad as our Central Avenue on Caladan.Some places I dont see  shadowed places  as though it went behind a hill (and again he thought of the surface of a blowing kerchief)  and there are branchings   He fell silent as memory of that seeing filled him.No prescient dream, no experience of his life had quite prepared him for the totality with which the veil had been ripped away to reveal naked time.Recalling the experience, he recognized his own terrible purpose  the pressure of his life spreading outward like an expanding bubble  time retreating before it   Jessica found the tents glowtab control, activated it.Dim green light drove back the shadows, easing her fear.She looked at Pauls face, his eyes  the inward stare.And she knew where she had seen such a look before: pictured in records of disasters  on the faces of children who experienced starvation or terrible injury.The eyes were like pits, mouth a straight line, cheeks indrawn.Its the look of terrible awareness, she thought, of someone forced to the knowledge of his own mortality.He was, indeed, no longer a child.The underlying import of his words began to take over in her mind, pushing all else aside.Paul could see ahead, a way of escape for them.Theres a way to evade the Harkonnens, she said.The Harkonnens!he sneered.Put those twisted humans out of your mind.He stared at his mother, studying the lines of her face in the light of the glowtab.The lines betrayed her.She said: You shouldnt refer to people as humans without  Dont be so sure you know where to draw the line, he said.We carry our past with us.And, mother mine, theres a thing you dont know and should  we are Harkonnens.Her mind did a terrifying thing: it blanked out as though it needed to shut off all sensation.But Pauls voice went on at that implacable pace, dragging her with it.When next you find a mirror, study your face  study mine now.The traces are there if you dont blind yourself.Look at my hands, the set of my bones.And if none of this convinces you, then take my word for it.Ive walked the future, Ive looked at a record, Ive seen a place, I have all the data.Were Harkonnens.A  renegade branch of the family, she said.Thats it, isnt it?Some Harkonnen cousin who  Youre the Barons own daughter, he said, and watched the way she pressed her hands to her mouth.The Baron sampled many pleasures in his youth, and once permitted himself to be seduced.But it was for the genetic purposes of the Bene Gesserit, by one of you.The way he said you struck her like a slap.But it set her mind to working and she could not deny his words.So many blank ends of meaning in her past reached out now and linked.The daughter the Bene Gesserit wanted  it wasnt to end the old Atreides Harkonnen feud, but to fix some genetic factor in their lines.What?She groped for an answer.As though he saw inside her mind, Paul said: They thought they were reaching for me.But Im not what they expected, and Ive arrived before my time.And they dont know it.Jessica pressed her hands to her mouth.Great Mother!Hes the Kwisatz Haderach!She felt exposed and naked before him, realizing then that he saw her with eyes from which little could be hidden.And that, she knew, was the basis of her fear.Youre thinking Im the Kwisatz Haderach, he said.Put that out of your mind.Im something unexpected.I must get word out to one of the schools, she thought.The mating index may show what has happened.They wont learn about me until its too late, he said.She sought to divert him, lowered her hands and said: Well find a place among the Fremen?The Fremen have a saying they credit to Shai hulud, Old Father Eternity, he said.They say: Be prepared to appreciate what you meet.And he thought: Yes, mother mine  among the Fremen.Youll acquire the blue eyes and a callus beside your lovely nose from the filter tube to your stillsuit  and youll bear my sister: St Alia of the Knife.If youre not the Kwisatz Haderach,Jessica said, what  You couldnt possibly know, he said.You wont believe it until you see it.And he thought: Im a seed.He suddenly saw how fertile was the ground into which he had fallen, and with this realization, the terrible purpose filled him, creeping through the empty place within, threatening to choke him with grief.He had seen two main branchings along the way ahead  in one he confronted an evil old Baron and said: Hello, Grandfather.The thought of that path and what lay along it sickened him.The other path held long patches of gray obscurity except for peaks of violence.He had seen a warrior religion there, a fire spreading across the universe with the Atreides green and black banner waving at the head of fanatic legions drunk on spice liquor.Gurney Halleck and a few others of his fathers men  a pitiful few  were among them, all marked by the hawk symbol from the shrine of his fathers skull.I cant go that way, he muttered.Thats what the old witches of your schools really want.I dont understand you, Paul, his mother said.He remained silent, thinking like the seed he was, thinking with the race consciousness he had first experienced as terrible purpose.He found that he no longer could hate the Bene Gesserit or the Emperor or even the Harkonnens.They were all caught up in the need of their race to renew its scattered inheritance, to cross and mingle and infuse their bloodlines in a great new pooling of genes.And the race knew only one sure way for this  the ancient way, the tried and certain way that rolled over everything in its path: jihad.Surely I cannot choose that way, he thought.But he saw again in his minds eye the shrine of his fathers skull and the violence with the green and black banner waving in its midst.Jessica cleared her throat, worried by his silence.Then  the Fremen will give us sanctuary?He looked up, staring across the green lighted tent at the inbred, patrician lines of her face.Yes, he said.Thats one of the ways.He nodded.Yes.Theyll call me  MuadDib, The One Who Points the Way.Yes thats what theyll call me.And he closed his eyes, thinking: Now, my father, I can mourn you.And he felt the tears coursing down his cheeks.MUADDIB    When my father, the Padishah Emperor, heard of Duke Letos death and the manner of it, he went into such a rage as we had never before seen.He blamed my mother and the compact forced on him to place a Bene Gesserit on the throne.He blamed the Guild and the evil old Baron.He blamed everyone in sight, not excepting even me, for he said I was a witch like all the others.And when I sought to comfort him, saying it was done according to an older law of self preservation to which even the most ancient rulers gave allegiance, he sneered at me and asked if I thought him a weakling.I saw then that he had been aroused to this passion not by concern over the dead Duke but by what that death implied for all royalty.As I look back on it, I think there may have been some prescience in my father, too, for it is certain that his line and MuadDibs shared common ancestry.In My Fathers House, by the Princess Irulan    Now Harkonnen shall kill Harkonnen, Paul whispered.He had awakened shortly before nightfall, sitting up in the sealed and darkened stilltent.As he spoke, he heard the vague stirrings of his mother where she slept against the tents opposite wall.Paul glanced at the proximity detector on the floor, studying the dials illuminated in the blackness by phosphor tubes.It should be night soon, his mother said.Why dont you lift the tent shades?Paul realized then that her breathing had been different for some time, that she had lain silent in the darkness until certain he was awake.Lifting the shades wouldnt help, he said.Theres been a storm.The tents covered by sand.Ill dig us out soon.No sign of Duncan yet?None.Paul rubbed absently at the ducal signet on his thumb, and a sudden rage against the very substance of this planet which had helped kill his father set him trembling.I heard the storm begin,Jessica said.The undemanding emptiness of her words helped restore some of his calm.His mind focused on the storm as he had seen it begin through the transparent end of their stilltent  cold dribbles of sand crossing the basin, then runnels and tails furrowing the sky.He had looked up to a rock spire, seen it change shape under the blast, becoming a low, cheddar colored wedge.Sand funneled into their basin had shadowed the sky with dull curry, then blotted out all light as the tent was covered.Tent bows had creaked once as they accepted the pressure, then  silence broken only by the dim bellows wheezing of their sand snorkel pumping air from the surface.Try the receiver again,Jessica said.No use, he said.He found his stillsuits watertube in its clip at his neck, drew a warm swallow into his mouth, and he thought that here he truly began an Arrakeen existence  living on reclaimed moisture from his own breath and body.It was flat and tasteless water, but it soothed his throat.Jessica heard Paul drinking, felt the slickness of her own stillsuit clinging to her body, but she refused to accept her thirst.To accept it would require awakening fully into the terrible necessities of Arrakis where they must guard even fractional traces of moisture, hoarding the few drops in the tents catch pockets, begrudging a breath wasted on the open air.So much easier to drift back down into sleep.But there had been a dream in this days sleep, and she shivered at memory of it.She had held dreaming hands beneath sandflow where a name had been written: Duke Leto Atreides.The name had blurred with the sand and she had moved to restore it, but the first letter filled before the last was begun.The sand would not stop.Her dream became wailing: louder and louder.That ridiculous wailing  part of her mind had realized the sound was her own voice as a tiny child, little more than a baby.A woman not quite visible to memory was going away.My unknown mother, Jessica thought.The Bene Gesserit who bore me and gave me to the Sisters because thats what she was commanded to do.Was she glad to rid herself of a Harkonnen child?The place to hit them is in the spice, Paul said.How can he think of attack at a time like this?she asked herself.An entire planet full of spice, she said.How can you hit them there?She heard him stirring, the sound of their pack being dragged across the tent floor.It was sea power and air power on Caladan, he said.Here, its desert power.The Fremen are the key.His voice came from the vicinity of the tents sphincter.Her Bene Gesserit training sensed in his tone an unresolved bitterness toward her.All his life he has been trained to hate Harkonnens, she thought.Now, he finds he is Harkonnen  because of me.How little he knows me!I was my Dukes only woman.I accepted his life and his values even to defying my Bene Gesserit orders.The tents glowtab came alight under Pauls hand, filled the domed area with green radiance.Paul crouched at the sphincter, his stillsuit hood adjusted for the open desert  forehead capped, mouth filter in place, nose plugs adjusted.Only his dark eyes were visible: a narrow band of face that turned once toward her and away.Secure yourself for the open, he said, and his voice was blurred behind the filter.Jessica pulled the filter across her mouth, began adjusting her hood as she watched Paul break the tent seal.Sand rasped as he opened the sphincter and a burred fizzle of grains ran into the tent before he could immobilize it with a static compaction tool.A hole grew in the sand wall as the tool realigned the grains.He slipped out and her ears followed his progress to the surface.What will we find out there?she wondered.Harkonnen troops and the Sardaukar, those are dangers we can expect.But what of the dangers we dont know?She thought of the compaction tool and the other strange instruments in the pack.Each of these tools suddenly stood in her mind as a sign of mysterious dangers.She felt then a hot breeze from surface sand touch her cheeks where they were exposed above the filter.Pass up the pack.It was Pauls voice, low and guarded.She moved to obey, heard the water literjons gurgle as she shoved the pack across the floor.She peered upward, saw Paul framed against stars.Here, he said and reached down, pulled the pack to the surface.Now she saw only the circle of stars.They were like the luminous tips of weapons aimed down at her.A shower of meteors crossed her patch of night.The meteors seemed to her like a warning, like tiger stripes, like luminous grave slats clabbering her blood.And she felt the chill of the price on their heads.Hurry up, Paul said.I want to collapse the tent.A shower of sand from the surface brushed her left hand.How much sand will the hand hold?she asked herself.Shall I help you?Paul asked.No.She swallowed in a dry throat, slipped into the hole, felt static packed sand rasp under her hands.Paul reached down, took her arm.She stood beside him on a smooth patch of starlit desert, stared around.Sand almost brimmed their basin, leaving only a dim lip of surrounding rock.She probed the farther darkness with her trained senses.Noise of small animals.Birds.A fall of dislodged sand and faint creature sounds within it.Paul collapsed their tent, recovering it up the hole.Starlight displaced just enough of the night to charge each shadow with menace.She looked at patches of blackness.Black is a blind remembering, she thought.You listen for pack sounds, for the cries of those who hunted your ancestors in a past so ancient only your most primitive cells remember.The ears see.The nostrils see.Presently, Paul stood beside her, said: Duncan told me that if he was captured, he could hold out  this long.We must leave here now.He shouldered the pack, crossed to the shallow lip of the basin, climbed to a ledge that looked down on open desert.Jessica followed automatically, noting how she now lived in her sons orbit.For now is my grief heavier than the sands of the seas, she thought.This world has emptied me of all but the oldest purpose: tomorrows life.I live now for my young Duke and the daughter yet to be.She felt the sand drag her feet as she climbed to Pauls side.He looked north across a line of rocks, studying a distant escarpment.The faraway rock profile was like an ancient battleship of the seas outlined by stars.The long swish of it lifted on an invisible wave with syllables of boomerang antennae, funnels arcing back, a pi shaped upthrusting at the stern.An orange glare burst above the silhouette and a line of brilliant purple cut downward toward the glare.Another line of purple!And another upthrusting orange glare!It was like an ancient naval battle, remembered shellfire, and the sight held them staring.Pillars of fire, Paul whispered.A ring of red eyes lifted over the distant rock.Lines of purple laced the sky.Jetflares and lasguns,Jessica said.The dust reddened first moon of Arrakis lifted above the horizon to their left and they saw a storm trail there  a ribbon of movement over the desert.It must be Harkonnen thopters hunting us, Paul said.The way theyre cutting up the desert  its as though they were making certain they stamped out whatevers there  the way youd stamp out a nest of insects.Or a nest of Atreides,Jessica said.We must seek cover, Paul said.Well head south and keep to the rocks.If they caught us in the open  He turned, adjusting the pack to his shoulders.Theyre killing anything that moves.He took one step along the ledge and, in that instant, heard the low hiss of gliding aircraft, saw the dark shapes of ornithopters above them.My father once told me that respect for the truth comes close to being the basis for all morality.Something cannot emerge from nothing, he said.This is profound thinking if you understand how unstable the truth can be.from Conversations with MuadDib by the Princess Irulan    Ive always prided myself on seeing things the way they truly are, Thufir Hawat said.Thats the curse of being a Mentat.You cant stop analyzing your data.The leathered old face appeared composed in the predawn dimness as he spoke.His sapho stained lips were drawn into a straight line with radial creases spreading upward.A robed man squatted silently on sand across from Hawat, apparently unmoved by the words.The two crouched beneath a rock overhang that looked down on a wide, shallow sink.Dawn was spreading over the shattered outline of cliffs across the basin, touching everything with pink.It was cold under the overhang, a dry and penetrating chill left over from the night.There had been a warm wind just before dawn, but now it was cold.Hawat could hear teeth chattering behind him among the few troopers remaining in his force.The man squatting across from Hawat was a Fremen who had come across the sink in the first light of false dawn, skittering over the sand, blending into the dunes, his movements barely discernible.The Fremen extended a finger to the sand between them, drew a figure there.It looked like a bowl with an arrow spilling out of it.There are many Harkonnen patrols, he said.He lifted his finger, pointed upward across the cliffs that Hawat and his men had descended.Hawat nodded.Many patrols.Yes.But still he did not know what this Fremen wanted and this rankled.Mentat training was supposed to give a man the power to see motives.This had been the worst night of Hawats life.He had been at Tsimpo, a garrison village, buffer outpost for the former capital city, Carthag, when the reports of attack began arriving.At first, hed thought: Its a raid.The Harkonnens are testing.But report followed report  faster and faster.Two legions landed at Carthag.Five legions  fifty brigades!attacking the Dukes main base at Arrakeen.A legion at Arsunt.Two battle groups at Splintered Rock.Then the reports became more detailed  there were Imperial Sardaukar among the attackers  possibly two legions of them.And it became clear that the invaders knew precisely which weight of arms to send where.Precisely!Superb intelligence.Hawats shocked fury had mounted until it threatened the smooth functioning of his Mentat capabilities.The size of the attack struck his mind like a physical blow.Now, hiding beneath a bit of desert rock, he nodded to himself, pulled his torn and slashed tunic around him as though warding off the cold shadows.The size of the attack.He had always expected their enemy to hire an occasional lighter from the Guild for probing raids.That was an ordinary enough gambit in this kind of House to House warfare.Lighters landed and took off on Arrakis regularly to transport the spice for House Atreides.Hawat had taken precautions against random raids by false spice lighters.For a full attack theyd expected no more than ten brigades.But there were more than two thousand ships down on Arrakis at the last count  not just lighters, but frigates, scouts, monitors, crushers, troop carriers, dump boxes   More than a hundred brigades  ten legions!The entire spice income of Arrakis for fifty years might just cover the cost of such a venture.It might.I underestimated what the Baron was willing to spend in attacking us, Hawat thought.I failed my Duke.Then there was the matter of the traitor.I will live long enough to see her strangled!he thought.I shouldve killed that Bene Gesserit witch when I had the chance.There was no doubt in his mind who had betrayed them  the Lady Jessica; She fitted all the facts available.Your man Gurney Halleck and part of his force are safe with our smuggler friends, the Fremen said.Good.So Gurney will get off this hell planet.Were not all gone.Hawat glanced back at the huddle of his men.He had started the night just past with three hundred of his finest.Of those, an even twenty remained and half of them were wounded.Some of them slept now, standing up, leaning against the rock, sprawled on the sand beneath the rock.Their last thopter, the one theyd been using as a ground effect machine to carry their wounded, had given out just before dawn.They had cut it up with lasguns and hidden the pieces, then worked their way down into this hiding place at the edge of the basin.Hawat had only a rough idea of their location  some two hundred kilometers southeast of Arrakeen.The main traveled ways between the Shield Wall sietch communities were somewhere south of them.The Fremen across from Hawat threw back his hood and stillsuit cap to reveal sandy hair and beard.The hair was combed straight back from a high, thin forehead.He had the unreadable total blue eyes of the spice diet.Beard and mustache were stained at one side of the mouth, his hair matted there by pressure of the looping catchtube from his nose plugs.The man removed his plugs, readjusted them.He rubbed at a scar beside his nose.If you cross the sink here this night, the Fremen said, you must not use shields.There is a break in the wall  He turned on his heels, pointed south.there, and it is open sand down to the erg.Shields will attract a  He hesitated.worm.They dont often come in here, but a shield will bring one every time.He said worm, Hawat thought.He was going to say something else.What?And what does he want of us?Hawat sighed.He could not recall ever before being this tired.It was a muscle weariness that energy pills were unable to ease.Those damnable Sardaukar!With a self accusing bitterness, he faced the thought of the soldier fanatics and the Imperial treachery they represented.His own Mentat assessment of the data told him how little chance he had ever to present evidence of this treachery before the High Council of the Landsraad where justice might be done.Do you wish to go to the smugglers?the Fremen asked.Is it possible?The way is long.Fremen dont like to say no, Idaho had told him once.Hawat said: You havent told me whether your people can help my wounded.They are wounded.The same damned answer every time!We know theyre wounded!Hawat snapped.Thats not the  Peace, friend, the Fremen cautioned.What do your wounded say?Are there those among them who can see the water need of your tribe?We havent talked about water, Hawat said.We  I can understand your reluctance, the Fremen said.They are your friends, your tribesmen.Do you have water?Not enough.The Fremen gestured to Hawats tunic, the skin exposed beneath it.You were caught in sietch, without your suits.You must make a water decision, friend.Can we hire your help?The Fremen shrugged.You have no water.He glanced at the group behind Hawat.How many of your wounded would you spend?Hawat fell silent, staring at the man.He could see as a Mentat that their communication was out of phase.Word sounds were not being linked up here in the normal manner.I am Thufir Hawat, he said.I can speak for my Duke.I will make promissory commitment now for your help.I wish a limited form of help, preserving my force long enough only to kill a traitor who thinks herself beyond vengeance.You wish our siding in a vendetta?The vendetta Ill handle myself.I wish to be freed of responsibility for my wounded that I may get about it.The Fremen scowled.How can you be responsible for your wounded?They are their own responsibility.The waters at issue, Thufir Hawat.Would you have me take that decision away from you?The man put a hand to a weapon concealed beneath his robe.Hawat tensed, wondering: Is this betrayal here?What do you fear?the Fremen demanded.These people and their disconcerting directness!Hawat spoke cautiously.Theres a price on my head.Ah h h h.  The Fremen removed his hand from his weapon.You think we have the Byzantine corruption.You dont know us.The Harkonnens have not water enough to buy the smallest child among us.But they had the price of Guild passage for more than two thousand fighting ships, Hawat thought.And the size of that price still staggered him.We both fight Harkonnens, Hawat said.Should we not share the problems and ways of meeting the battle issue?We are sharing, the Fremen said.I have seen you fight Harkonnens.You are good.Thereve been times Id have appreciated your arm beside me.Say where my arm may help you, Hawat said.Who knows?the Fremen asked.There are Harkonnen forces everywhere.But you still have not made the water decision or put it to your wounded.I must be cautious, Hawat told himself.Theres a thing here thats not understood.He said: Will you show me your way, the Arrakeen way?Stranger thinking, the Fremen said, and there was a sneer in his tone.He pointed to the northwest across the clifftop.We watched you come across the sand last night.He lowered his arm.You keep your force on the slipface of the dunes.Bad.You have no stillsuits, no water.You will not last long.The ways of Arrakis dont come easily, Hawat said.Truth.But weve killed Harkonnens.What do you do with your own wounded?Hawat demanded.Does a man not know when he is worth saving?the Fremen asked.Your wounded know you have no water.He tilted his head, looking sideways up at Hawat.This is clearly a time for water decision.Both wounded and unwounded must look to the tribes future.The tribes future, Hawat thought.The tribe of Atreides.Theres sense in that.He forced himself to the question he had been avoiding.Have you word of my Duke or his son?Unreadable blue eyes stared upward into Hawats.Word?Their fate!Hawat snapped.Fate is the same for everyone, the Fremen said.Your Duke, it is said, has met his fate.As to the Lisan al Gaib, his son, that is in Liets hands.Liet has not said.I knew the answer without asking, Hawat thought.He glanced back at his men.They were all awake now.They had heard.They were staring out across the sand, the realization in their expressions: there was no returning to Caladan for them, and now Arrakis was lost.Hawat turned back to the Fremen.Have you heard of Duncan Idaho?He was in the great house when the shield went down, the Fremen said.This Ive heard  no more.She dropped the shield and let in the Harkonnens, he thought.I was the one who sat with my back to a door.How could she do this when it meant turning against her own son?But  who knows how a Bene Gesserit witch thinks  if you can call it thinking?Hawat tried to swallow in a dry throat.When will you hear about the boy?We know little of what happens in Arrakeen, the Fremen said.He shrugged.Who knows?You have ways of finding out?Perhaps.The Fremen rubbed at the scar beside his nose.Tell me, Thufir Hawat, do you have knowledge of the big weapons the Harkonnens used?The artillery, Hawat thought bitterly.Who could have guessed theyd use artillery in this day of shields?You refer to the artillery they used to trap our people in the caves, he said.Ive  theoretical knowledge of such explosive weapons.Any man who retreats into a cave which has only one opening deserves to die, the Fremen said.Why do you ask about these weapons?Liet wishes it.Is that what he wants from us?Hawat wondered.He said: Did you come here seeking information about the big guns?Liet wished to see one of the weapons for himself.Then you should just go take one, Hawat sneered.Yes, the Fremen said.We took one.We have it hidden where Stilgar can study it for Liet and where Liet can see it for himself if he wishes.But I doubt hell want to: the weapon is not a very good one.Poor design for Arrakis.You  took one?Hawat asked.It was a good fight, the Fremen said.We lost only two men and spilled the water from more than a hundred of theirs.There were Sardaukar at every gun, Hawat thought.This desert madman speaks casually of losing only two men against Sardaukar!We would not have lost the two except for those others fighting beside the Harkonnens, the Fremen said.Some of those were good fighters.One of Hawats men limped forward, looked down at the squatting Fremen.Are you talking about Sardaukar?Hes talking about Sardaukar, Hawat said.Sardaukar!the Fremen said, and there appeared to be glee in his voice.Ah h h, so thats what they are!This was a good night indeed.Sardaukar.Which legion?Do you know?We  dont know, Hawat said.Sardaukar, the Fremen mused.Yet they wear Harkonnen clothing.Is this not strange?The Emperor does not wish it known he fights against a Great House, Hawat said.But you know they are Sardaukar.Who am I?Hawat asked bitterly.You are Thufir Hawat, the man said matter of factly.Well, we would have learned it in time.Weve sent three of them captive to be questioned by Liets men.Hawats aide spoke slowly, disbelief in every word: You  captured Sardaukar?Only three of them, the Fremen said.They fought well.If only wed had the time to link up with these Fremen, Hawat thought.It was a sour lament in his mind.If only we couldve trained them and armed them.Great Mother, what a fighting force wed have had!Perhaps you delay because of worry over the Lisan al Gaib, the Fremen said.If he is truly the Lisan al Gaib, harm cannot touch him.Do not spend thoughts on a matter which has not been proved.I serve the  Lisan al Gaib, Hawat said.His welfare is my concern.Ive pledged myself to this.You are pledged to his water?Hawat glanced at his aide, who was still staring at the Fremen, returned his attention to the squatting figure.To his water, yes.You wish to return to Arrakeen, to the place of his water?To  yes, to the place of his water.Why did you not say at first it was a water matter?The Fremen stood up, seated his nose plugs firmly.Hawat motioned with his head for his aide to return to the others.With a tired shrug, the man obeyed.Hawat heard a low voiced conversation arise among the men.The Fremen said: There is always a way to water.Behind Hawat, a man cursed.Hawats aide called: Thufir!Arkie just died.The Fremen put a fist to his ear.The bond of water!Its a sign!He stared at Hawat.We have a place nearby for accepting the water.Shall I call my men?The aide returned to Hawats side, said: Thufir, a couple of the men left wives in Arrakeen.Theyre  well, you know how it is at a time like this.The Fremen still held his fist to his ear.Is it the bond of water, Thufir Hawat?he demanded.Hawats mind was racing.He sensed now the direction of the Fremens words, but feared the reaction of the tired men under the rock overhang when they understood it.The bond of water, Hawat said.Let our tribes be joined, the Fremen said, and he lowered his fist.As though that were the signal, four men slid and dropped down from the rocks above them.They darted back under the overhang, rolled the dead man in a loose robe, lifted him and began running with him along the cliff wall to the right.Spurts of dust lifted around their running feet.It was over before Hawats tired men could gather their wits.The group with the body hanging like a sack in its enfolding robe was gone around a turn in the cliff.One of Hawats men shouted: Where they going with Arkie?He was  Theyre taking him to  bury him, Hawat said.Fremen dont bury their dead!the man barked.Dont you try any tricks on us, Thufir.We know what they do.Arkie was one of  Paradise were sure for a man who died in the service of Lisan al Gaib, the Fremen said.If it is the Lisan al Gaib you serve, as you have said it, why raise mourning cries?The memory of one who died in this fashion will live as long as the memory of man endures.But Hawats men advanced, angry looks on their faces.One had captured a lasgun.He started to draw it.Stop right where you are!Hawat barked.He fought down the sick fatigue that gripped his muscles.These people respect our dead.Customs differ, but the meanings the same.Theyre going to render Arkie down for his water, the man with the lasgun snarled.Is it that your men wish to attend the ceremony?the Fremen asked.He doesnt even see the problem, Hawat thought.The navet of the Fremen was frightening.Theyre concerned for a respected comrade, Hawat said.We will treat your comrade with the same reverence we treat our own, the Fremen said.This is the bond of water.We know the rites.A mans flesh is his own; the water belongs to the tribe.Hawat spoke quickly as the man with the lasgun advanced another step.Will you now help our wounded?One does not question the bond, the Fremen said.We will do for you what a tribe does for its own.First, we must get all of you suited and see to the necessities.The man with the lasgun hesitated.Hawats aide said: Are we buying help with Arkies  water?Not buying, Hawat said.Weve joined these people.Customs differ, one of his men muttered.Hawat began to relax.And theyll help us get to Arrakeen?We will kill Harkonnens, the Fremen said.He grinned.And Sardaukar.He stepped backward, cupped his hands beside his ears and tipped his head back, listening.Presently, he lowered his hands, said: An aircraft comes.Conceal yourselves beneath the rock and remain motionless.At a gesture from Hawat, his men obeyed.The Fremen took Hawats arm, pressed him back with the others.We will fight in the time of fighting, the man said.He reached beneath his robes, brought out a small cage, lifted a creature from it.Hawat recognized a tiny bat.The bat turned its head and Hawat saw its blue within blue eyes.The Fremen stroked the bat, soothing it, crooning to it.He bent over the animals head, allowed a drop of saliva to fall from his tongue into the bats upturned mouth.The bat stretched its wings, but remained on the Fremens open hand.The man took a tiny tube, held it beside the bats head and chattered into the tube; then, lifting the creature high, he threw it upward.The bat swooped away beside the cliff and was lost to sight.The Fremen folded the cage, thrust it beneath his robe.Again, he bent his head, listening.They quarter the high country, he said.One wonders who they seek up there.Its known that we retreated this direction, Hawat said.One should never presume one is the sole object of a hunt, the Fremen said.Watch the other side of the basin.You will see a thing.Time passed.Some of Hawats men stirred, whispering.Remain silent as frightened animals, the Fremen hissed.Hawat discerned movement near the opposite cliff  flitting blurs of tan on tan.My little friend carried his message, the Fremen said.He is a good messenger  day or night.Ill be unhappy to lose that one.The movement across the sink faded away.On the entire four to five kilometer expanse of sand nothing remained but the growing pressure of the days heat  blurred columns of rising air.Be most silent now, the Fremen whispered.A file of plodding figures emerged from a break in the opposite cliff, headed directly across the sink.To Hawat, they appeared to be Fremen, but a curiously inept band.He counted six men making heavy going of it over the dunes.A thwok thwok of ornithopter wings sounded high to the right behind Hawats group.The craft came over the cliff wall above them  an Atreides thopter with Harkonnen battle colors splashed on it.The thopter swooped toward the men crossing the sink.The group there stopped on a dune crest, waved.The thopter circled once over them in a tight curve, came back for a dust shrouded landing in front of the Fremen.Five men swarmed from the thopter and Hawat saw the dust repellent shimmering of shields and, in their motions, the hard competence of Sardaukar.Aiihh!They use their stupid shields, the Fremen beside Hawat hissed.He glanced toward the open south wall of the sink.They are Sardaukar, Hawat whispered.Good.The Sardaukar approached the waiting group of Fremen in an enclosing half circle.Sun glinted on blades held ready.The Fremen stood in a compact group, apparently indifferent.Abruptly, the sand around the two groups sprouted Fremen.They were at the ornithopter, then in it.Where the two groups had met at the dune crest, a dust cloud partly obscured violent motion.Presently, dust settled.Only Fremen remained standing.They left only three men in their thopter, the Fremen beside Hawat said.That was fortunate.I dont believe we had to damage the craft in taking it.Behind Hawat, one of his men whispered: Those were Sardaukar!Did you notice how well they fought?the Fremen asked.Hawat took a deep breath.He smelled the burned dust around him, felt the heat, the dryness.In a voice to match that dryness, he said: Yes, they fought well, indeed.The captured thopter took off with a lurching flap of wings, angled upward to the south in a steep, wing tucked climb.So these Fremen can handle thopters, too, Hawat thought.On the distant dune, a Fremen waved a square of green cloth: once  twice.More come!the Fremen beside Hawat barked.Be ready.Id hoped to have us away without more inconvenience.Inconvenience!Hawat thought.He saw two more thopters swooping from high in the west onto an area of sand suddenly devoid of visible Fremen.Only eight splotches of blue  the bodies of the Sardaukar in Harkonnen uniforms  remained at the scene of violence.Another thopter glided in over the cliff wall above Hawat.He drew in a sharp breath as he saw it  a big troop carrier.It flew with the slow, spread wing heaviness of a full load  like a giant bird coming to its nest.In the distance, the purple finger of a lasgun beam flicked from one of the diving thopters.It laced across the sand, raising a sharp trail of dust.The cowards!the Fremen beside Hawat rasped.The troop carrier settled toward the patch of blue clad bodies.Its wings crept out to full reach, began the cupping action of a quick stop.Hawats attention was caught by a flash of sun on metal to the south, a thopter plummeting there in a power dive, wings folded flat against its sides, its jets a golden flare against the dark silvered gray of the sky.It plunged like an arrow toward the troop carrier which was unshielded because of the lasgun activity around it.Straight into the carrier the diving thopter plunged.A flaming roar shook the basin.Rocks tumbled from the cliff walls all around.A geyser of red orange shot skyward from the sand where the carrier and its companion thopters had been  everything there caught in the flame.It was the Fremen who took off in that captured thopter, Hawat thought.He deliberately sacrificed himself to get that carrier.Great Mother!What are these Fremen?A reasonable exchange, said the Fremen beside Hawat.There mustve been three hundred men in that carrier.Now, we must see to their water and make plans to get another aircraft.He started to step out of their rock shadowed concealment.A rain of blue uniforms came over the cliff wall in front of him, falling in low suspensor slowness.In the flashing instant, Hawat had time to see that they were Sardaukar, hard faces set in battle frenzy, that they were unshielded and each carried a knife in one hand, a stunner in the other.A thrown knife caught Hawats Fremen companion in the throat, hurling him backward, twisting face down.Hawat had only time to draw his own knife before blackness of a stunner projectile felled him.MuadDib could, indeed, see the Future, but you must understand the limits of this power.Think of sight.You have eyes, yet cannot see without light.If you are on the floor of a valley, you cannot see beyond your valley.Just so, MuadDib could not always choose to look across the mysterious terrain.He tells us, that a single obscure decision of prophecy, perhaps the choice of one word over another, could change the entire aspect of the future.He tells us The vision of time is broad, but when you pass through it, time becomes a narrow door.And always he fought the temptation to choose a clear, safe course, warning That path leads ever down into stagnation.from Arrakis Awakening by the Princess Irulan    As the ornithopters glided out of the night above them, Paul grabbed his mothers arm, snapped: Dont move!Then he saw the lead craft in the moonlight, the way its wings cupped to brake for landing, the reckless dash of the hands at the controls.Its Idaho, he breathed.The craft and its companions settled into the basin like a covey of birds coming to nest.Idaho was out of his thopter and running toward them before the dust settled.Two figures in Fremen robes followed him.Paul recognized one: the tall, sandy bearded Kynes.This way!Kynes called and he veered left.Behind Kynes, other Fremen were throwing fabric covers over their ornithopters.The craft became a row of shallow dunes.Idaho skidded to a stop in front of Paul, saluted.MLord, the Fremen have a temporary hiding place nearby where we  What about that back there?Paul pointed to the violence above the distant cliff  the jetflares, the purple beams of lasguns lacing the desert.A rare smile touched Idahos round, placid face.MLord  Sire, Ive left them a little sur  Glaring white light filled the desert  bright as a sun, etching their shadows onto the rock floor of the ledge.In one sweeping motion, Idaho had Pauls arm in one hand, Jessicas shoulder in the other, hurling them down off the ledge into the basin.They sprawled together in the sand as the roar of an explosion thundered over them.Its shock wave tumbled chips off the rock ledge they had vacated.Idaho sat up, brushed sand from himself.Not the family atomics!Jessica said.I thought  You planted a shield back there, Paul said.A big one turned to full force, Idaho said.A lasgun beam touched it and  He shrugged.Subatomic fusion,Jessica said.Thats a dangerous weapon.Not weapon, mLady, defense.That scum will think twice before using lasguns another time.The Fremen from the ornithopters stopped above them.One called in a low voice: We should get under cover, friends.Paul got to his feet as Idaho helped Jessica up.That blast will attract considerable attention, Sire, Idaho said.Sire, Paul thought.The word had such a strange sound when directed at him.Sire had always been his father.He felt himself touched briefly by his powers of prescience, seeing himself infected by the wild race consciousness that was moving the human universe toward chaos.The vision left him shaken, and he allowed Idaho to guide him along the edge of the basin to a rock projection.Fremen there were opening a way down into the sand with their compaction tools.May I take your pack, Sire?Idaho asked.Its not heavy, Duncan, Paul said.You have no body shield, Idaho said.Do you wish mine?He glanced at the distant cliff.Not likely therell be any more lasgun activity about.Keep your shield, Duncan.Your right arm is shield enough for me.Jessica saw the way the praise took effect, how Idaho moved closer to Paul, and she thought: Such a sure hand my son has with his people.The Fremen removed a rock plug that opened a passage down into the native basement complex of the desert.A camouflage cover was rigged for the opening.This way, one of the Fremen said, and he led them down rock steps into darkness.Behind them, the cover blotted out the moonlight.A dim green glow came alive ahead, revealing the steps and rock walls, a turn to the left.Robed Fremen were all around them now, pressing downward.They rounded the corner, found another down slanting passage.It opened into a rough cave chamber.Kynes stood before them, jubba hood thrown back, the neck of his stillsuit glistening in the green light.His long hair and beard were mussed.The blue eyes without whites were a darkness under heavy brows.In the moment of encounter, Kynes wondered at himself: Why am I helping these people?Its the most dangerous thing Ive ever done.It could doom me with them.Then he looked squarely at Paul, seeing the boy who had taken on the mantle of manhood, masking grief, suppressing all except the position that now must be assumed  the dukedom.And Kynes realized in that moment the dukedom still existed and solely because of this youth  and this was not a thing to be taken lightly.Jessica glanced once around the chamber, registering it on her senses in the Bene Gesserit way  a laboratory, a civil place full of angles and squares in the ancient manner.This is one of the Imperial Ecological Testing Stations my father wanted as advance bases, Paul said.His father wanted!Kynes thought.And again Kynes wondered at himself.Am I foolish to aid these fugitives?Why am I doing it?Itd be so easy to take them now, to buy the Harkonnen trust with them.Paul followed his mothers example, gestalting the room, seeing the workbench down one side, the walls of featureless rock.Instruments lined the bench  dials glowing, wire gridex planes with fluting glass emerging from them.An ozone smell permeated the place.Some of the Fremen moved on around a concealing angle in the chamber and new sounds started there  machine coughs, the whinnies of spinning belts and multidrives.Paul looked to the end of the room, saw cages with small animals in them stacked against the wall.Youve recognized this place correctly, Kynes said.For what would you use such a place, Paul Atreides?To make this planet a fit place for humans, Paul said.Perhaps thats why I help them, Kynes thought.The machine sounds abruptly hummed away to silence.Into this void there came a thin animal squeak from the cages.It was cut off abruptly as though in embarrassment.Paul returned his attention to the cages, saw that the animals were brown winged bats.An automatic feeder extended from the side wall across the cages.A Fremen emerged from the hidden area of the chamber, spoke to Kynes: Liet, the field generator equipment is not working.I am unable to mask us from proximity detectors.Can you repair it?Kynes asked.Not quickly.The parts  The man shrugged.Yes, Kynes said.Then well do without machinery.Get a hand pump for air out to the surface.Immediately.The man hurried away.Kynes turned back to Paul.You gave a good answer.Jessica marked the easy rumble of the mans voice.It was a royal voice, accustomed to command.And she had not missed the reference to him as Liet.Liet was the Fremen alter ego, the other face of the tame planetologist.Were most grateful for your help, Doctor Kynes, she said.Mm m m, well see, Kynes said.He nodded to one of his men.Spice coffee in my quarters, Shamir.At once, Liet, the man said.Kynes indicated an arched opening in a side wall of the chamber.If you please?Jessica allowed herself a regal nod before accepting.She saw Paul give a hand signal to Idaho, telling him to mount guard here.The passage, two paces deep, opened through a heavy door into a square office lighted by golden glowglobes.Jessica passed her hand across the door as she entered, was startled to identify plasteel.Paul stepped three paces into the room, dropped his pack to the floor.He heard the door close behind him, studied the place  about eight meters to a side, walls of natural rock, curry colored, broken by metal filing cabinets on their right.A low desk with milk glass top shot full of yellow bubbles occupied the rooms center.Four suspensor chairs ringed the desk.Kynes moved around Paul, held a chair for Jessica.She sat down, noting the way her son examined the room.Paul remained standing for another eyeblink.A faint anomaly in the rooms air currents told him there was a secret exit to their right behind the filing cabinets.Will you sit down, Paul Atreides?Kynes asked.How carefully he avoids my title, Paul thought.But he accepted the chair, remained silent while Kynes sat down.You sense that Arrakis could be a paradise, Kynes said.Yet, as you see, the Imperium sends here only its trained hatchetmen, its seekers after the spice!Paul held up his thumb with its ducal signet.Do you see this ring?Yes.Do you know its significance?Jessica turned sharply to stare at her son.Your father lies dead in the ruins of Arrakeen, Kynes said.You are technically the Duke.Im a soldier of the Imperium, Paul said, technically a hatchetman.Kynes face darkened.Even with the Emperors Sardaukar standing over your fathers body?The Sardaukar are one thing, the legal source of my authority is another, Paul said.Arrakis has its own way of determining who wears the mantle of authority, Kynes said.And Jessica, turning back to look at him, thought: Theres steel in this man that no one has taken the temper out of  and weve need of steel.Pauls doing a dangerous thing.Paul said: The Sardaukar on Arrakis are a measure of how much our beloved Emperor feared my father.Now, I will give the Padishah Emperor reasons to fear the  Lad, Kynes said, there are things you dont  You will address me as Sire or my Lord, Paul said.Gently, Jessica thought.Kynes stared at Paul, and Jessica noted the glint of admiration in the planetologists face, the touch of humor there.Sire, Kynes said.I am an embarrassment to the Emperor, Paul said.I am an embarrassment to all who would divide Arrakis as their spoil.As I live, I shall continue to be such an embarrassment that I stick in their throats and choke them to death!Words, Kynes said.Paul stared at him.Presently, Paul said: You have a legend of the Lisan al Gaib here, the Voice from the Outer World, the one who will lead the Fremen to paradise.Your men have  Superstition!Kynes said.Perhaps, Paul agreed.Yet perhaps not.Superstitions sometimes have strange roots and stranger branchings.You have a plan, Kynes said.This much is obvious  Sire.Could your Fremen provide me with proof positive that the Sardaukar are here in Harkonnen uniform?Quite likely.The Emperor will put a Harkonnen back in power here, Paul said.Perhaps even Beast Rabban.Let him.Once he has involved himself beyond escaping his guilt, let the Emperor face the possibility of a Bill of Particulars laid before the Landsraad.Let him answer there where  Paul!said Jessica.Granted that the Landsraad High Council accepts your case, Kynes said, there could be only one outcome: general warfare between the Imperium and the Great Houses.Chaos,Jessica said.But Id present my case to the Emperor, Paul said, and give him an alternative to chaos.Jessica spoke in a dry tone: Blackmail?One of the tools of statecraft, as youve said yourself, Paul said, and Jessica heard the bitterness in his voice.The Emperor has no sons, only daughters.Youd aim for the throne?Jessica asked.The Emperor will not risk having the Imperium shattered by total war, Paul said.Planets blasted, disorder everywhere  hell not risk that.This is a desperate gamble you propose, Kynes said.What do the Great Houses of the Landsraad fear most?Paul asked.They fear most what is happening here right now on Arrakis  the Sardaukar picking them off one by one.Thats why there is a Landsraad.This is the glue of the Great Convention.Only in union do they match the Imperial forces.But theyre  This is what they fear, Paul said.Arrakis would become a rallying cry.Each of them would see himself in my father  cut out of the herd and killed.Kynes spoke to Jessica: Would his plan work?Im no Mentat,Jessica said.But you are Bene Gesserit.She shot a probing stare at him, said: His plan has good points and bad points  as any plan would at this stage.A plan depends as much upon execution as it does upon concept.Law is the ultimate science, Paul quoted.Thus it reads above the Emperors door.I propose to show him law.And Im not sure I could trust the person who conceived this plan, Kynes said.Arrakis has its own plan that we  From the throne, Paul said, I could make a paradise of Arrakis with the wave of a hand.This is the coin I offer for your support.Kynes stiffened.My loyaltys not for sale, Sire.Paul stared across the desk at him, meeting the cold glare of those blue within blue eyes, studying the bearded face, the commanding appearance.A harsh smile touched Pauls lips and he said: Well spoken.I apologize.Kynes met Pauls stare and, presently, said: No Harkonnen ever admitted error.Perhaps youre not like them, Atreides.It could be a fault in their education, Paul said.You say youre not for sale, but I believe Ive the coin youll accept.For your loyalty I offer my loyalty to you  totally.My son has the Atreides sincerity, Jessica thought.He has that tremendous, almost naive honor  and what a powerful force that truly is.She saw that Pauls words had shaken Kynes.This is nonsense, Kynes said.Youre just a boy and  Im the Duke, Paul said.Im an Atreides.No Atreides has ever broken such a bond.Kynes swallowed.When I say totally, Paul said, I mean without reservation.I would give my life for you.Sire!Kynes said, and the word was torn from him, but Jessica saw that he was not now speaking to a boy of fifteen, but to a man, to a superior.Now Kynes meant the word.In this moment hed give his life for Paul, she thought.How do the Atreides accomplish this so quickly, so easily?I know you mean this, Kynes said.Yet the Harkon  The door behind Paul slammed open.He whirled to see reeling violence  shouting, the clash of steel, wax image faces grimacing in the passage.With his mother beside him, Paul leaped for the door, seeing Idaho blocking the passage, his blood pitted eyes there visible through a shield blur, claw hands beyond him, arcs of steel chopping futilely at the shield.There was the orange fire mouth of a stunner repelled by the shield.Idahos blades were through it all, flick flicking, red dripping from them.Then Kynes was beside Paul and they threw their weight against the door.Paul had one last glimpse of Idaho standing against a swarm of Harkonnen uniforms  his jerking, controlled staggers, the black goat hair with a red blossom of death in it.Then the door was closed and there came a snick as Kynes threw the bolts.I appear tove decided, Kynes said.Someone detected your machinery before it was shut down, Paul said.He pulled his mother away from the door, met the despair in her eyes.I shouldve suspected trouble when the coffee failed to arrive, Kynes said.Youve a bolt hole out of here, Paul said.Shall we use it?Kynes took a deep breath, said: This door should hold for at least twenty minutes against all but a lasgun.Theyll not use a lasgun for fear weve shields on this side, Paul said.Those were Sardaukar in Harkonnen uniform, Jessica whispered.They could hear pounding on the door now, rhythmic blows.Kynes indicated the cabinets against the right hand wall, said: This way.He crossed to the first cabinet, opened a drawer, manipulated a handle within it.The entire wall of cabinets swung open to expose the black mouth of a tunnel.This door also is plasteel, Kynes said.You were well prepared,Jessica said.We lived under the Harkonnens for eighty years, Kynes said.He herded them into the darkness, closed the door.In the sudden blackness, Jessica saw a luminous arrow on the floor ahead of her.Kynes voice came from behind them: Well separate here.This wall is tougher.Itll stand for at least an hour.Follow the arrows like that one on the floor.Theyll be extinguished by your passage.They lead through a maze to another exit where Ive secreted a thopter.Theres a storm across the desert tonight.Your only hope is to run for that storm, dive into the top of it, ride with it.My people have done this in stealing thopters.If you stay high in the storm youll survive.What of you?Paul asked.Ill try to escape another way.If Im captured  well, Im still Imperial Planetologist.I can say I was your captive.Running like cowards, Paul thought.But how else can I live to avenge my father?He turned to face the door.Jessica heard him move, said: Duncans dead, Paul.You saw the wound.You can do nothing for him.Ill take full payment for them all one day, Paul said.Not unless you hurry now, Kynes said.Paul felt the mans hand on his shoulder.Where will we meet, Kynes?Paul asked.Ill send the Fremen searching for you.The storms path is known.Hurry now, and the Great Mother give you speed and luck.They heard him go, a scrambling in the blackness.Jessica found Pauls hand, pulled him gently.We must not get separated, she said.Yes.He followed her across the first arrow, seeing it go black as they touched it.Another arrow beckoned ahead.They crossed it, saw it extinguish itself, saw another arrow ahead.They were running now.Plans within plans within plans within plans, Jessica thought.Have we become part of someone elses plan now?The arrows led them around turnings, past side openings only dimly sensed in the faint luminescence.Their way slanted downward for a time, then up, ever up.They came finally to steps, rounded a corner and were brought short by a glowing wall with a dark handle visible in its center.Paul pressed the handle.The wall swung away from them.Light flared to reveal a rock hewn cavern with an ornithopter squatting in its center.A flat gray wall with a doorsign on it loomed beyond the aircraft.Where did Kynes go?Jessica asked.He did what any good guerrilla leader would, Paul said.He separated us into two parties and arranged that he couldnt reveal where we are if hes captured.He wont really know.Paul drew her into the room, noting how their feet kicked up dust on the floor.No ones been here for a long time, he said.He seemed confident the Fremen could find us, she said.I share that confidence.Paul released her hand, crossed to the ornithopters left door, opened it, and secured his pack in the rear.This ships proximity masked, he said.Instrument panel has remote door control, light control.Eighty years under the Harkonnens taught them to be thorough.Jessica leaned against the crafts other side, catching her breath.The Harkonnens will have a covering force over this area, she said.Theyre not stupid.She considered her direction sense, pointed right.The storm we saw is that way.Paul nodded, fighting an abrupt reluctance to move.He knew its cause, but found no help in the knowledge.Somewhere this night he had passed a decision nexus into the deep unknown.He knew the time area surrounding them, but the here and now existed as a place of mystery.It was as though he had seen himself from a distance go out of sight down into a valley.Of the countless paths up out of that valley, some might carry a Paul Atreides back into sight, but many would not.The longer we wait the better prepared theyll be, Jessica said.Get in and strap yourself down, he said.He joined her in the ornithopter, still wrestling with the thought that this was blind ground, unseen in any prescient vision.And he realized with an abrupt sense of shock that he had been giving more and more reliance to prescient memory and it had weakened him for this particular emergency.If you rely only on your eyes, your other senses weaken.It was a Bene Gesserit axiom.He took it to himself now, promising never again to fall into that trap  if he lived through this.Paul fastened his safety harness, saw that his mother was secure, checked the aircraft.The wings were at full spread rest, their delicate metal interleavings extended.He touched the retractor bar, watched the wings shorten for jet boost take off the way Gurney Halleck had taught him.The starter switch moved easily.Dials on the instrument panel came alive as the jetpods were armed.Turbines began their low hissing.Ready?he asked.Yes.He touched the remote control for lights.Darkness blanketed them.His hand was a shadow against the luminous dials as he tripped the remote door control.Grating sounded ahead of them.A cascade of sand swished away to silence.A dusty breeze touched Pauls cheeks.He closed his door, feeling the sudden pressure.A wide patch of dust blurred stars framed in angular darkness appeared where the door wall had been.Starlight defined a shelf beyond, a suggestion of sand ripples.Paul depressed the glowing action sequence switch on his panel.The wings snapped back and down, hurling the thopter out of its nest.Power surged from the jetpods as the wings locked into lift attitude.Jessica let her hands ride lightly on the dual controls, feeling the sureness of her sons movements.She was frightened, yet exhilarated.Now, Pauls training is our only hope, she thought.His youth and swiftness.Paul fed more power to the jetpods.The thopter banked, sinking them into their seats as a dark wall lifted against the stars ahead.He gave the craft more wing, more power.Another burst of lifting wingbeats and they came out over rocks, silver frosted angles and outcroppings in the starlight.The dust reddened second moon showed itself above the horizon to their right, defining the ribbon trail of the storm.Pauls hands danced over the controls.Wings snicked in to beetle stubs.G force pulled at their flesh as the craft came around in a tight bank.Jetflares behind us!Jessica said.I saw them.He slammed the power arm forward.Their thopter leaped like a frightened animal, surged southwest toward the storm and the great curve of desert.In the near distance, Paul saw scattered shadows telling where the line of rocks ended, the basement complex sinking beneath the dunes.Beyond stretched moonlit fingernail shadows  dunes diminishing one into another.And above the horizon climbed the flat immensity of the storm like a wall against the stars.Something jarred the thopter.Shellburst!Jessica gasped.Theyre using some kind of projectile weapon.She saw a sudden animal grin on Pauls face.They seem to be avoiding their lasguns, he said.But weve no shields!Do they know that?Again the thopter shuddered.Paul twisted to peer back.Only one of them appears to be fast enough to keep up with us.He returned his attention to their course, watching the storm wall grow high in front of them.It loomed like a tangible solid.Projectile launchers, rockets, all the ancient weaponry  thats one thing well give the Fremen, Paul whispered.The storm,Jessica said.Hadnt you better turn?What about the ship behind us?Hes pulling up.Now!Paul stubbed the wings, banked hard left into the deceptively slow boiling of the storm wall, felt his cheeks pull in the G force.They appeared to glide into a slow clouding of dust that grew heavier and heavier until it blotted out the desert and the moon.The aircraft became a long, horizontal whisper of darkness lighted only by the green luminosity of the instrument panel.Through Jessicas mind flashed all the warnings about such storms  that they cut metal like butter, etched flesh to bone and ate away the bones.She felt the buffeting of dust blanketed wind.It twisted them as Paul fought the controls.She saw him chop the power, felt the ship buck.The metal around them hissed and trembled.Sand!Jessica shouted.She saw the negative shake of his head in the light from the panel.Not much sand this high.But she could feel them sinking deeper into the maelstrom.Paul sent the wings to their full soaring length, heard them creak with the strain.He kept his eyes fixed on the instruments, gliding by instinct, fighting for altitude.The sound of their passage diminished.The thopter began rolling off to the left.Paul focused on the glowing globe within the attitude curve, fought his craft back to level flight.Jessica had the eerie feeling that they were standing still, that all motion was external.A vague tan flowing against the windows, a rumbling hiss reminded her of the powers around them.Winds to seven or eight hundred kilometers an hour, she thought.Adrenalin edginess gnawed at her.I must not fear, she told herself, mouthing the words of the Bene Gesserit litany.Fear is the mind killer.Slowly her long years of training prevailed.Calmness returned.We have the tiger by the tail, Paul whispered.We cant go down, cant land  and I dont think I can lift us out of this.Well have to ride it out.Calmness drained out of her.Jessica felt her teeth chattering, clamped them together.Then she heard Pauls voice, low and controlled, reciting the litany:  Fear is the mind killer.Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration.I will face my fear.I will permit it to pass over me and through me.And when it has gone past me I will turn to see fears path.Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.Only I will remain.What do you despise?By this are you truly known.from Manual of MuadDib by the Princess Irulan    They are dead, Baron, said Iakin Nefud, the guard captain.Both the woman and the boy are certainly dead.The Baron Vladimir Harkonnen sat up in the sleep suspensors of his private quarters.Beyond these quarters and enclosing him like a multishelled egg stretched the space frigate he had grounded on Arrakis.Here in his quarters, though, the ships harsh metal was disguised with draperies, with fabric paddings and rare art objects.It is a certainty, the guard captain said.They are dead.The Baron shifted his gross body in the suspensors, focused his attention on an ebaline statue of a leaping boy in a niche across the room.Sleep faded from him.He straightened the padded suspensor beneath the fat folds of his neck, stared across the single glowglobe of his bedchamber to the doorway where Captain Nefud stood blocked by the pentashield.Theyre certainly dead, Baron, the man repeated.The Baron noted the trace of semuta dullness in Nefuds eyes.It was obvious the man had been deep within the drugs rapture when he received this report, and had stopped only to take the antidote before rushing here.I have a full report, Nefud said.Let him sweat a little, the Baron thought.One must always keep the tools of statecraft sharp and ready.Power and fear  sharp and ready.Have you seen their bodies?the Baron rumbled.Nefud hesitated.Well?MLord  they were seen to dive into a sandstorm  winds over eight hundred kilometers.Nothing survives such a storm, mLord.Nothing!One of our own craft was destroyed in the pursuit.The Baron stared at Nefud, noting the nervous twitch in the scissors line of the mans jaw muscles, the way the chin moved as Nefud swallowed.You have seen the bodies?the Baron asked.MLord  For what purpose do you come here rattling your armor?the Baron roared.To tell me a thing is certain when it is not?Do you think Ill praise you for such stupidity, give you another promotion?Nefuds face went bone pale.Look at that chicken, the Baron thought.I am surrounded by such useless clods.If I scattered sand before this creature and told him it was grain, hed peck at it.The man Idaho led us to them, then?the Baron asked.Yes, mLord!Look how he blurts out his answer, the Baron thought.He said: They were attempting to flee to the Fremen, eh?Yes, mLord.Is there more to this  report?The Imperial Planetologist, Kynes, is involved, mLord.Idaho joined this Kynes under mysterious circumstances  I might even say suspicious circumstances.So?They  ah, fled together to a place in the desert where its apparent the boy and his mother were hiding.In the excitement of the chase, several of our groups were caught in a lasgun shield explosion.How many did we lose?Im  ah, not sure yet, mLord.Hes lying, the Baron thought.It mustve been pretty bad.The Imperial lackey, this Kynes, the Baron said.He was playing a double game, eh?Id stake my reputation on it, mLord.His reputation!Have the man killed, the Baron said.MLord!Kynes is the Imperial Planetologist, His Majestys own serv  Make it look like an accident, then!MLord, there were Sardaukar with our forces in the subjugation of this Fremen nest.They have Kynes in custody now.Get him away from them.Say I wish to question him.If they demur?They will not if you handle it correctly.Nefud swallowed.Yes, mLord.The man must die, the Baron rumbled.He tried to help my enemies.Nefud shifted from one foot to the other.Well?MLord, the Sardaukar have  two persons in custody who might be of interest to you.Theyve caught the Dukes Master of Assassins.Hawat?Thufir Hawat?Ive seen the captive myself, mLord.Tis Hawat.Id notve believed it possible!They say he was knocked out by a stunner, mLord.In the desert where he couldnt use his shield.Hes virtually unharmed.If we can get our hands on him, hell provide great sport.This is a Mentat you speak of, the Baron growled.One doesnt waste a Mentat.Has he spoken?What does he say of his defeat?Could he know the extent of  but no.He has spoken only enough, mLord, to reveal his belief that the Lady Jessica was his betrayer.Ah h h h h.   The Baron sank back, thinking; then: Youre sure?Its the Lady Jessica who attracts his anger?He said it in my presence, mLord.Let him think shes alive, then.But, mLord  Be quiet.I wish Hawat treated kindly.He must be told nothing of the late Doctor Yueh, his true betrayer.Let it be said that Doctor Yueh died defending his Duke.In a way, this may even be true.We will, instead, feed his suspicions against the Lady Jessica.MLord, I dont  The way to control and direct a Mentat, Nefud, is through his information.False information  false results.Yes, mLord, but   Is Hawat hungry?Thirsty?MLord, Hawats still in the hands of the Sardaukar!Yes.Indeed, yes.But the Sardaukar will be as anxious to get information from Hawat as I am.Ive noticed a thing about our allies, Nefud.Theyre not very devious  politically.I do believe this is a deliberate thing; the Emperor wants it that way.Yes.I do believe it.You will remind the Sardaukar commander of my renown at obtaining information from reluctant subjects.Nefud looked unhappy.Yes, mLord.You will tell the Sardaukar commander that I wish to question both Hawat and this Kynes at the same time, playing one off against the other.He can understand that much, I think.Yes, mLord.And once we have them in our hands  The Baron nodded.MLord, the Sardaukar will want an observer with you during any  questioning.Im sure we can produce an emergency to draw off any unwanted observers, Nefud.I understand, mLord.Thats when Kynes can have his accident.Both Kynes and Hawat will have accidents then, Nefud.But only Kynes will have a real accident.Its Hawat I want.Ah, yes.Nefud blinked, swallowed.He appeared about to ask a question, but remained silent.Hawat will be given both food and drink, the Baron said.Treated with kindness, with sympathy.In his water you will administer the residual poison developed by the late Piter de Vries.And you will see that the antidote becomes a regular part of Hawats diet from this point on  unless I say otherwise.The antidote, yes.Nefud shook his head.But  Dont be dense, Nefud.The Duke almost killed me with that poison capsule tooth.The gas he exhaled into my presence deprived me of my most valuable Mentat, Piter.I need a replacement.Hawat?Hawat.But  Youre going to say Hawats completely loyal to the Atreides.True, but the Atreides are dead.We will woo him.He must be convinced hes not to blame for the Dukes demise.It was all the doing of that Bene Gesserit witch.He had an inferior master, one whose reason was clouded by emotion.Mentats admire the ability to calculate without emotion, Nefud.We will woo the formidable Thufir Hawat.Woo him.Yes, mLord.Hawat, unfortunately, had a master whose resources were poor, one who could not elevate a Mentat to the sublime peaks of reasoning that are a Mentats right.Hawat will see a certain element of truth in this.The Duke couldnt afford the most efficient spies to provide his Mentat with the required information.The Baron stared at Nefud.Let us never deceive ourselves, Nefud.The truth is a powerful weapon.We know how we overwhelmed the Atreides.Hawat knows, too.We did it with wealth.With wealth.Yes, mLord.We will woo Hawat, the Baron said.We will hide him from the Sardaukar.And we will hold in reserve  the withdrawal of the antidote for the poison.Theres no way of removing the residual poison.And, Nefud, Hawat need never suspect.The antidote will not betray itself to a poison snooper.Hawat can scan his food as he pleases and detect no trace of poison.Nefuds eyes opened wide with understanding.The absence of a thing, the Baron said, this can be as deadly as the presence.The absence of air, eh?The absence of water?The absence of anything else were addicted to.The Baron nodded.You understand me, Nefud?Nefud swallowed.Yes, mLord.Then get busy.Find the Sardaukar commander and set things in motion.At once, mLord.Nefud bowed, turned, and hurried away.Hawat by my side!the Baron thought.The Sardaukar will give him to me.If they suspect anything at all its that I wish to destroy the Mentat.And this suspicion Ill confirm!The fools!One of the most formidable Mentats in all history, a Mentat trained to kill, and theyll toss him to me like some silly toy to be broken.I will show them what use can be made of such a toy.The Baron reached beneath a drapery beside his suspensor bed, pressed a button to summon his older nephew, Rabban.He sat back, smiling.And all the Atreides dead!The stupid guard captain had been right, of course.Certainly, nothing survived in the path of a sandblast storm on Arrakis.Not an ornithopter  or its occupants.The woman and the boy were dead.The bribes in the right places, the unthinkable expenditure to bring overwhelming military force down onto one planet  all the sly reports tailored for the Emperors ears alone, all the careful scheming were here at last coming to full fruition.Power and fear fear and power!The Baron could see the path ahead of him.One day, a Harkonnen would be Emperor.Not himself, and no spawn of his loins.But a Harkonnen.Not this Rabban hed summoned, of course.But Rabbans younger brother, young Feyd Rautha.There was a sharpness to the boy that the Baron enjoyed  a ferocity.A lovely boy, the Baron thought.A year or two more  say, by the time hes seventeen, Ill know for certain whether hes the tool that House Harkonnen requires to gain the throne.MLord Baron.The man who stood outside the doorfield of the Barons bedchamber was low built, gross of face and body, with the Harkonnen paternal lines narrow set eyes and bulge of shoulders.There was yet some rigidity in his fat, but it was obvious to the eye that hed come one day to the portable suspensors for carrying his excess weight.A muscle minded tank brain, the Baron thought.No Mentat, my nephew  not a Piter de Vries, but perhaps something more precisely devised for the task at hand.If I give him freedom to do it, hell grind over everything in his path.Oh, how hell be hated here on Arrakis!My dear Rabban, the Baron said.He released the door field, but pointedly kept his body shield at full strength, knowing that the shimmer of it would be visible above the bedside glowglobe.You summoned me, Rabban said.He stepped into the room, flicked a glance past the air disturbance of the body shield, searched for a suspensor chair, found none.Stand closer where I can see you easily, the Baron said.Rabban advanced another step, thinking that the damnable old man had deliberately removed all chairs, forcing a visitor to stand.The Atreides are dead, the Baron said.The last of them.Thats why I summoned you here to Arrakis.This planet is again yours.Rabban blinked.But I thought you were going to advance Piter de Vries to the  Piter, too, is dead.Piter?Piter.The Baron reactivated the doorfield, blanked it against all energy penetration.You finally tired of him, eh?Rabban asked.His voice fell flat and lifeless in the energy blanketed room.I will say a thing to you just this once, the Baron rumbled.You insinuate that I obliterated Piter as one obliterates a trifle.He snapped fat fingers.Just like that, eh?I am not so stupid, Nephew.I will take it unkindly if ever again you suggest by word or action that I am so stupid.Fear showed in the squinting of Rabbans eyes.He knew within certain limits how far the old Baron would go against family.Seldom to the point of death unless there were outrageous profit or provocation in it.But family punishments could be painful.Forgive me, mLord Baron, Rabban said.He lowered his eyes as much to hide his own anger as to show subservience.You do not fool me, Rabban, the Baron said.Rabban kept his eyes lowered, swallowed.I make a point, the Baron said.Never obliterate a man unthinkingly, the way an entire fief might do it through some due process of law.Always do it for an overriding purpose  and know your purpose!Anger spoke in Rabban: But you obliterated the traitor, Yueh!I saw his body being carried out as I arrived last night.Rabban stared at his uncle, suddenly frightened by the sound of those words.But the Baron smiled.Im very careful about dangerous weapons, he said.Doctor Yueh was a traitor.He gave me the Duke.Strength poured into the Barons voice.I suborned a doctor of the Suk School!The Inner School!You hear, boy?But thats a wild sort of weapon to leave lying about.I didnt obliterate him casually.Does the Emperor know you suborned a Suk doctor?That was a penetrating question, the Baron thought.Have I misjudged this nephew?The Emperor doesnt know it yet, the Baron said.But his Sardaukar are sure to report it to him.Before that happens, though, Ill have my own report in his hands through CHOAM Company channels.I will explain that I luckily discovered a doctor who pretended to the conditioning.A false doctor, you understand?Since everyone knows you cannot counter the conditioning of a Suk School, this will be accepted.Ah h h, I see, Rabban murmured.And the Baron thought: Indeed, I hope you do see.I hope you do see how vital it is that this remain secret.The Baron suddenly wondered at himself.Why did I do that?Why did I boast to this fool nephew of mine  the nephew I must use and discard?The Baron felt anger at himself.He felt betrayed.It must be kept secret, Rabban said.I understand.The Baron sighed.I give you different instructions about Arrakis this time, Nephew.When last you ruled this place, I held you in strong rein.This time, I have only one requirement.MLord?
