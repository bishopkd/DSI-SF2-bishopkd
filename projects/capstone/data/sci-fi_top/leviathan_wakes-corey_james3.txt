Can I ask who Lieutenant Lopez is?Hes the guy who asked to see you, Kelly said.Kelly stopped at a plain gray door, rapped once, then took Holden inside a small compartment with a table and two uncomfortable looking chairs.A dark haired man was setting up a recorder.He waved one hand vaguely in the direction of a chair.Holden sat.The chair was even less comfortable than it looked.You can go, Mr.Kelly, the man Holden assumed was Lopez said.Kelly left and closed the door.When Lopez had finished, he sat down across the table from Holden and reached out one hand.Holden shook it.Im Lieutenant Lopez.Kelly probably told you that.I work for naval intelligence, which he almost certainly didnt tell you.My job isnt secret, but they train jarheads to be tight lipped.Lopez reached into his pocket, took out a small packet of white lozenges, and popped one into his mouth.He didnt offer one to Holden.Lopezs pupils contracted to tiny points as he sucked the lozenge.Focus drugs.Hed be watching every tic of Holdens face during questioning.Tough to lie to.First Lieutenant James R.  Holden, of Montana, he said.It wasnt a question.Yes, sir, Holden said anyway.Seven years in the UNN, last posting on the destroyer Zhang Fei.Thats me.Your file says you were busted out for assaulting a superior officer, Lopez said.Thats pretty clich, Holden.You punched the old man?Seriously?No.I missed.Broke my hand on a bulkhead.Howd that happen?He was quicker than I expected, Holden replied.Whyd you try?I was projecting my self loathing onto him.Its just a stroke of luck that I actually wound up hurting the right person, Holden said.Sounds like youve thought about it some since then, Lopez said, his pinprick pupils never moving from Holdens face.Therapy?Lots of time to think on the Canterbury, Holden replied.Lopez ignored the obvious opening and said, What did you come up with, during all that thinking?The Coalition has been stepping on the necks of the people out here for over a hundred years now.I didnt like being the boot.An OPA sympathizer, then?Lopez said, his expression not changing at all.No.I didnt switch sides.I stopped playing.I didnt renounce my citizenship.I like Montana.Im out here because I like flying, and only a Belter rust trap like the Canterbury will hire me.Lopez smiled for the first time.Youre an exceedingly honest man, Mr.Holden.Yes.Why did you claim that a Martian military vessel destroyed your ship?I didnt.I explained all that in the broadcast.It had technology only available to inner planet fleets, and I found a piece of MCRN hardware in the device that tricked us into stopping.Well want to see that.Youre welcome to it.Your file says you were the only child of a family co op, Lopez said, acting as though theyd never stopped talking about Holdens past.Yes, five fathers, three mothers.So many parents for only one child, Lopez said, slowly unwrapping another lozenge.The Martians had lots of space for traditional families.The tax break for eight adults only having one child allowed them to own twenty two acres of decent farmland.There are over thirty billion people on Earth.Twenty two acres is a national park, Holden said.Also, the DNA mix is legit.They arent parents in name only.How did they decide who carried you?Mother Elise had the widest hips.Lopez popped the second lozenge into his mouth and sucked on it a few moments.Before he could speak again, the deck shook.The video recorder jiggled on its arm.Torpedo launches?Holden said.Guess those Belt ships didnt change course.Any thoughts about that, Mr.Holden?Just that you seem pretty willing to kill Belt ships.Youve put us in a position where we cant afford to seem weak.After your accusations, there are a lot of people who dont think much of us.Holden shrugged.If the man was watching for guilt or remorse from Holden, he was out of luck.The Belt ships had known what they were going toward.They hadnt turned away.But still, something bothered him.They might hate your living guts, Holden said.But its hard to find enough suicidal people to crew six ships.Maybe they think they can outrun torpedoes.Lopez didnt move, his whole body preternaturally still with the focus drugs pouring through him.We  Lopez began, and the general quarters Klaxon sounded.It was deafening in the small metal compartment.Holy shit, did they shoot back?Holden asked.Lopez shook himself, like a man waking up from a daydream.He got up and hit the comm button by the door.A marine came through seconds later.Take Mr.Holden back to his quarters, Lopez said, then left the room at a run.The marine gestured at the corridor with the barrel of his rifle.His expression was hard.Its all fun and games till someone shoots back, Holden thought.* * *   Naomi patted the empty couch next to her and smiled.Did they put slivers under your fingernails?she asked.No, actually, he was surprisingly human for a naval intelligence wonk, Holden replied.Of course, he was just getting warmed up.Have you guys heard anything about the other ships?Alex said, Nope.But that alarm means theyre takin them seriously all of a sudden.Its insane, Shed said quietly.Flying around in these metal bubbles, and then trying to poke holes in each other.You ever seen what long term decompression and cold exposure does?Breaks all the capillaries in your eyes and skin.Tissue damage to the lungs can cause massive pneumonia followed by emphysema like scarring.I mean, if you dont just die.Well, thats awful fucking cheerful, Doc.Thanks for that, Amos said.The ship suddenly vibrated in a syncopated but ultra high speed rhythm.Alex looked at Holden, his eyes wide.Thats the point defense network openin up.That means incoming torpedoes, he said.Better strap in tight, kids.The ship might start doin some violent maneuvering.Everyone but Holden was already belted into the couches.He fastened his restraints too.This sucks.All the real action is happenin thousands of klicks from here, and we got no instruments to look at, Alex said.We wont know if somethin slipped through the flack screen till it rips the hull open.Boy, everybody is just a fucking pile of fun right now, Amos said loudly.Sheds eyes were wide, his face too pale.Holden shook his head.Not going to happen, he said.This thing is unkillable.Whoever those ships are, they can put on a good show, but thats it.All respect, Captain, Naomi said.But whoever those ships are, they should be dead already, and they arent.The distant noises of faraway combat kept up.The occasional rumble of a torpedo firing.The near constant vibration of the high speed point defense guns.Holden didnt realize hed fallen asleep until he was jerked awake by an earsplitting roar.Amos and Alex were yelling.Shed was screaming.What happened?Holden yelled over the noise.Were hit, Cap!Alex said.That was a torpedo hit!The gravity suddenly dropped away.The Donnager had stopped its engines.Or theyd been destroyed.Amos was still yelling, Shit shit shit, over everything.But at least Shed had stopped screaming.He was staring wide eyed out of his couch, his face white.Holden unbuckled his straps and pushed off toward the comm panel.Jim!Naomi called out.What are you doing?We need to find out whats going on, Holden said over his shoulder.When he reached the bulkhead by the hatch, he punched the comm panel call button.There was no reply.He hit it again, then started pounding on the hatch.No one came.Where are our damn marines?he said.The lights dimmed, came back up.Then again, and again, in a slow cadence.Gauss turrets firing.Shit.Its CQB, Alex said in awe.In the history of the Coalition, no capital ship had ever gotten into a close quarters battle.But here they were, firing the ships big cannons, which meant that the range was sufficiently short that a nonguided weapon was viable.Hundreds or even dozens of kilometers, not thousands.Somehow the Belt ships had survived Donnagers torpedo barrage.Anyone else think this is desperate fucking queer?Amos asked, a touch of panic in his voice.The Donnager began to ring like a gong struck over and over again by a massive hammer.Return fire.The gauss round that killed Shed didnt even make a noise.Like a magic trick, two perfectly round holes appeared on either side of the room in a line that intersected Sheds couch.One moment, the medic was there; the next, his head was gone from the Adams apple up.Arterial blood pumped out in a red cloud, pulled into two thin lines, and whirled to the holes in the walls of the room as the air rushed out.For twelve years, Miller had worked security.Violence and death were familiar companions to him.Men, women.Animals.Kids.Once hed held a womans hand while she bled to death.Hed killed two people, could still see them die if he closed his eyes and thought about it.If anyone had asked him, hed have said there wasnt much left that would shake him.But hed never watched a war start before.The Distinguished Hyacinth Lounge was in the shift change rush.Men and women in security uniforms mostly from Star Helix, but a few smaller companies too were either drinking their after work liquor and winding down or making trips to the breakfast buffet for coffee, textured fungi in sugar sauce, sausage with meat maybe one part in a thousand.Miller chewed the sausage and watched the display monitor on the wall.A Star Helix external relations head looked sincerely out, his demeanor radiating calm and certainty as he explained how everything was going to hell.Preliminary scans suggest that the explosion was the result of a failed attempt to connect a nuclear device to the docking station.Officials from the Martian government have referred to the incident only as an alleged terrorist action and refused comment pending further investigation.Another one, Havelock said from behind him.You know, eventually, one of those assholes is going to get it right.Miller turned in his seat, then nodded to the chair beside him.Havelock sat.Thatll be an interesting day, Miller said.I was about to call you.Yeah, sorry, his partner said.I was up kind of late.Any word on the transfer?No, Havelock said.Figure my paperworks hung on a desk someplace in Olympus.What about you?Any word on your special project girl?Not yet, Miller said.Look, the reason I wanted to meet up before we went in I need to take a couple days, try to run down some leads on Julie.With all this other shit going on, Shaddid doesnt want me doing much more than phoning this one in.But youre ignoring that, Havelock said.It wasnt a question.Ive got a feeling about this one.So how can I help?I need you to cover for me.How am I going to do that?Havelock asked.Its not like I can tell them youre sick.Theyve got access to your medical records same as everyone elses.Tell em Ive been getting drunk a lot, Miller said.That Candace came by.Shes my ex wife.Havelock chewed his sausage, brow furrowed.The Earther shook his head slowly not a refusal, but the prelude to a question.Miller waited.Youre telling me youd rather have the boss think youre missing work because youre on a dysfunctional, heartbroken bender than that youre doing the work she assigned you?I dont get it.Miller licked his lips and leaned forward, elbows on the smooth off white table.Someone had scratched a design into the plastic.A split circle.And this was a cop bar.I dont know what Im looking at, Miller said.Theres a bunch of things that belong together somehow, and Im not sure yet what it is.Until I know more, I need to stay low.A guy has a fling with his ex, hits the bottle for a few days?Thats not going to light up anyones panels.Havelock shook his head again, this time in mild disbelief.If hed been a Belter, hed have made the gesture with his hands, so you could see it when he had an environment suit on.Another of the hundred small ways someone who hadnt grown up on the Belt betrayed himself.The wall monitor cut to the image of a blond woman in a severe uniform.The external relations head was talking about the Martian navys tactical response and whether the OPA was behind the increased vandalism.That was what he called fumbling an overloaded fusion reactor while setting up a ship killing booby trap: vandalism.That shit just doesnt follow, Havelock said, and for a moment Miller didnt know if he meant the Belter guerrilla actions, the Martian response, or the favor hed asked.Seriously.Wheres Earth?All this shits going on, and we dont hear a damn thing from them.Why would we?Miller asked.Its Mars and the Belt going at it.When was the last time Earth let anything major happen without them in the middle of it?Havelock said, then sighed.Okay.Youre too drunk to come in.Your love lifes a mess.Im trying to cover for you.Just for a couple days.Make sure you get back before someone decides its the perfect chance for a random shooting to take out the Earther cop.Ill do that, Miller said, rising from the table.You watch your back.Dont need to tell me twice, Havelock said.* * *   The Ceres Center for Jiu Jitsu was down near the port, where the spin gravity was strongest.The hole was a converted storage space from before the big spin.A cylinder flattened where flooring had been set in about a third of the way from the bottom.Racks bearing various lengths of staffs, bamboo swords, and dull plastic practice knives hung from the vaulted ceiling.The polished stone echoed with the grunting of men working a line of resistance machines and the soft thud of a woman at the back punishing a heavy bag.Three students stood on the central mat, speaking in low voices.Pictures filled the front wall on either side of the door.Soldiers in uniform.Security agents for half a dozen Belter corporations.Not many inner planet types, but a few.Plaques commemorating placements in competitions.A page of small type outlining the history of the studio.One of the students shouted and collapsed, carrying one of the others to the mat with her.The one still standing applauded and helped them back up.Miller searched through the wall of pictures, hoping to find Julie.Can I help you?The man was half a head shorter than Miller and easily twice as broad.It should have made him look like an Earther, but everything else about him said Belt.He wore pale sweats that made his skin seem even darker.His smile was curious and as serene as a well fed predator.Miller nodded.Detective Miller, he said.Im with station security.Theres one of your students I wanted to get some background on.This is an official investigation?the man asked.Yeah, Miller said.Im afraid it is.Then youll have a warrant.Miller smiled.The man smiled back.We dont give out any information on our students without a warrant, he said.Studio policy.I respect that, Miller said.No, I really do.Its just that parts of this particular investigation are maybe a little more official than others.The girls not in trouble.She didnt do anything.But she has family on Luna who want her found.A kidnap job, the man said, folding his arms.The serene face had gone cool without any apparent movement.Only the official part, Miller said.I can get a warrant, and we can do the whole thing through channels.But then I have to tell my boss.The more she knows, the less room I have to move.The man didnt react.His stillness was unnerving.Miller struggled not to fidget.The woman working the heavy bag at the far end of the studio went through a flurry of strikes, shouting out with each one.Who?the man asked.Julie Mao, Miller said.He could have said he was looking for the Buddhas mother for all the reaction he got.I think shes in trouble.Why do you care if she is?I dont know the answer to that one, Miller said.I just do.If you dont want to help me, then you dont.And youll go get your warrant.Do this through channels.Miller took off his hat, rubbed a long, thin hand across his head, and put the hat back in place.Probably not, he said.Let me see your ID, the man said.Miller pulled up his terminal and let the man confirm who he was.The man handed it back and pointed to a small door behind the heavy bags.Miller did as he was told.The office was cramped.A small laminate desk with a soft sphere behind it in lieu of a chair.Two stools that looked like theyd come out of a bar.A filing cabinet with a small fabricator that stank of ozone and oil that was probably where the plaques and certificates were made.Why does the family want her?the man asked, lowering himself onto the sphere.It acted like a chair but required constant balance.A place to rest without actually resting.They think shes in harms way.At least, thats what theyre saying, and I dont have reason to disbelieve them yet.What kind of harm?Dont know, Miller said.I know she was on station.I know she shipped out for Tycho, and after that, Ive got nothing.Her family want her back on their station?The man knew who her family was.Miller filed the information away without missing a beat.I dont think so, Miller said.The last message she got from them routed through Luna.Down the well.The way he said it made it sound like a disease.Im looking for anyone who knows who she was shipping with.If shes on a run, where she was going and when she was planning to get there.If shes in range of a tightbeam.I dont know any of that, the man said.You know anyone I should ask?There was a pause.Maybe.Ill find what I can for you.Anything else you can tell me about her?She started at the studio five years ago.She was angry when she first came.Undisciplined.She got better, Miller said.Brown belt, right?The mans eyebrows rose.Im a cop, Miller said.I find things out.She improved, her teacher said.Shed been attacked.Just after she came to the Belt.She was seeing that it didnt happen twice.Attacked, Miller said, parsing the mans tone of voice.Raped?I didnt ask.She trained hard, even when she was off station.You can tell when people let it slide.They come back weaker.She never did.Tough girl, Miller said.Good for her.Did she have friends?People she sparred with?A few.No lovers that I know of, since thats the next question.Thats strange.Girl like that.Like what, Detective?Pretty girl, Miller said.Competent.Smart.Dedicated.Who wouldnt want to be with someone like that?Perhaps she hadnt met the right person.Something in the way he said it hinted at amusement.Miller shrugged, uncomfortable in his skin.What kind of work did she do?he asked.Light freighter.I dont know of any particular cargo.I had the impression that she shipped wherever there was a need.Not a regular route, then?That was my impression.Whose ships did she work?One particular freighter, or whatever came to hand?A particular company?Ill find what I can for you, the man said.Courier for the OPA?Ill find out, the man said, what I can.* * *   The news that afternoon was all about Phoebe.The science station there the one that Belters werent allowed even to dock at had been hit.The official report stated that half the inhabitants of the base were dead, the other half missing.No one had claimed responsibility yet, but the common wisdom was that some Belter group maybe the OPA, maybe someone else had finally managed an act of vandalism with a body count.Miller sat in his hole, watching the broadcast feed and drinking.It was all going to hell.The pirate casts from the OPA calling for war.The burgeoning guerrilla actions.All of it.The time was coming that Mars wasnt going to ignore them anymore.And when Mars took action, it wouldnt matter if Earth followed suit.It would be the first real war in the Belt.The catastrophe was coming, and neither side seemed to understand how vulnerable they were.And there was nothing not one single goddamned thing that he could do to stop it.He couldnt even slow it down.Julie Mao grinned at him from the still frame, her pinnace behind her.Attacked, the man had said.There was nothing about it in her record.Might have been a mugging.Might have been something worse.Miller had known a lot of victims, and he put them into three categories.First there were the ones who pretended nothing had happened, or that whatever it was didnt really matter.That was well over half the people he talked to.Then there were the professionals, people who took their victimization as permission to act out any way they saw fit.That ate most of the rest.Maybe 5 percent, maybe less, were the ones who sucked it up, learned the lesson, and moved on.The Julies.The good ones.His door chimed three hours after his official shift was over.Miller stood up, less steady on his feet than hed expected.He counted the bottles on the table.There were more than hed thought.He hesitated for a moment, torn between answering the door and throwing the bottles into the recycler.The door chimed again.He went to open it.If it was someone from the station, they expected him to be drunk, anyway.No reason to disappoint.The face was familiar.Acne pocked, controlled.The OPA armband from the bar.The one whod had Mateo Judd killed.The cop.Evening, Miller said.Detective Miller, the pocked man said.I think weve gotten off on the wrong foot.I was hoping we could try again.Right.May I come in?I try not to take strange men home, Miller said.I dont even know your name.Anderson Dawes, the pocked man said.Im the Ceres liaison for the Outer Planets Alliance.I think we can help each other.May I come in?Miller stood back, and the pocked man Dawes stepped inside.Dawes took in the hole for the space of two slow breaths, then sat as if the bottles and the stink of old beer were nothing to comment on.Silently cursing himself and willing a sobriety he didnt feel, Miller sat across from him.I need a favor from you, Dawes said.Im willing to pay for it.Not money, of course.Information.What do you want?Miller asked.Stop looking for Juliette Mao.No sale.Im trying to keep the peace, Detective, Dawes said.You should hear me out.Miller leaned forward, elbows on the table.Mr.Serene Jiu Jitsu Instructor was working for the OPA?The timing of Dawes visit seemed to be saying so.Miller filed that possibility away but said nothing.Mao worked for us, Dawes said.But youd guessed that.More or less.You know where she is?We dont.We are looking for her.And we need to be the ones to find her.Not you.Miller shook his head.There was a response, the right thing to say.It was rattling in the back of his head, and if he just didnt feel quite so fuzzy  Youre one of them, Detective.You may have lived your whole life out here, but your salary is paid by an inner planet corporation.No, wait.I dont blame you.I understand how it is.They were hiring and you needed the work.But were walking on a bubble right now.The Canterbury.The fringe elements in the Belt calling for war.Phoebe Station.Yes, theyll blame us for that too.Add a Luna corporations prodigal daughter   You think somethings happened to her.She was on the Scopuli, Dawes said, and when Miller didnt immediately respond, he added, The freighter that Mars used as bait when they killed the Canterbury.Miller thought about that for a long moment, then whistled low.We dont know what happened, Dawes said.Until we do, I cant have you stirring up the water.Its muddy enough now.And what information are you offering?Miller asked.Thats the trade, right?Ill tell you what we find.After we find her, Dawes said.Miller chuckled, and the OPA man went on.Its a generous offer, considering who you are.Employee of Mars.Partner of an Earther.Some people would think that was enough to make you the enemy too.But not you, Miller said.I think weve got the same basic goals, you and I.  Stability.Safety.Strange times make for strange alliances.Two questions.Dawes spread his arms, welcoming them.Who took the riot gear?Miller asked.Riot gear?Before the Canterbury died, someone took our riot gear.Maybe they wanted to arm soldiers for crowd control.Maybe they didnt want our crowds controlled.Who took it?Why?It wasnt us, Dawes said.Thats not an answer.Try this one.What happened to the Golden Bough Society?Dawes looked blank.Loca Greiga?Miller asked.Sohiro?Dawes opened his mouth, closed it.Miller dropped his beer bottle into the recycler.Nothing personal, friend, he said, but your investigative techniques arent impressing me.What makes you think you can find her?Its not a fair test, Dawes said.Give me a few days, Ill get answers for you.Talk to me then.Ill try not to start an all out war while you do, but Im not letting go of Julie.You can go now.Dawes rose.He looked sour.Youre making a mistake, he said.Wont be my first.After the man left, Miller sat at his table.Hed been stupid.Worse, hed been self indulgent.Drinking himself into a stupor instead of doing the work.Instead of finding Julie.But he knew more now.The Scopuli.The Canterbury.More lines between the dots.He cleaned away his bottles, took a shower, and pulled up his terminal, searching what there was about Julies ship.After an hour, a new thought occurred to him, a small fear that grew the more he looked at it.Near midnight, he put a call through to Havelocks hole.His partner took two full minutes to answer.When he did, his image was wild haired and bleary eyed.Miller?Havelock.You have any vacation time saved up?A little.Sick leave?Sure, Havelock said.Take it, Miller said.Take it now.Get off station.Someplace safe if you can find it.Someplace theyre not going to start killing Earthers for shits and giggles if things go pear shaped.I dont understand.What are you talking about?I had a little visit with an OPA agent tonight.He was trying to talk me into dropping my kidnap job.I think I think hes nervous.I think hes scared.Havelock was silent for a moment while the words filtered into his sleep drunk mind.Jesus, he said.What scares the OPA?Holden froze, watching the blood pump from Sheds neck, then whip away like smoke into an exhaust fan.The sounds of combat began to fade as the air was sucked out of the room.His ears throbbed and then hurt like someone had put ice picks in them.As he fought with his couch restraints, he glanced over at Alex.The pilot was yelling something, but it didnt carry through the thin air.Naomi and Amos had gotten out of their couches already, kicked off, and were flying across the room to the two holes.Amos had a plastic dinner tray in one hand.Naomi, a white three ring binder.Holden stared at them for the half second it took to understand what they were doing.The world narrowed, his peripheral vision all stars and darkness.By the time hed gotten free, Amos and Naomi had already covered the holes with their makeshift patches.The room was filled with a high pitched whistle as the air tried to force its way out through the imperfect seals.Holdens sight began to return as the air pressure started to rise.He was panting hard, gasping for breath.Someone slowly turned the rooms volume knob back up and Naomis yells for help became audible.Jim, open the emergency locker!she screamed.She was pointing at a small red and yellow panel on the bulkhead near his crash couch.Years of shipboard training made a path through the anoxia and depressurization, and he yanked the tab on the lockers seal and pulled the door open.Inside were a white first aid kit marked with the ancient red cross symbol, half a dozen oxygen masks, and a sealed bag of hardened plastic disks attached to a glue gun.The emergency seal kit.He snatched it.Just the gun, Naomi yelled at him.He wasnt sure if her voice sounded distant because of the thin air or because the pressure drop had blown his eardrums.Holden yanked the gun free from the bag of patches and threw it at her.She ran a bead of instant sealing glue around the edge of her three ring binder.She tossed the gun to Amos, who caught it with an effortless backhand motion and put a seal around his dinner tray.The whistling stopped, replaced by the hiss of the atmosphere system as it labored to bring the pressure back up to normal.Fifteen seconds.Everyone looked at Shed.Without the vacuum, his blood was pouring out into a floating red sphere just above his neck, like a hideous cartoon replacement for his head.Jesus Christ, Boss, Amos said, looking away from Shed to Naomi.He snapped his teeth closed with an audible click and shook his head.What   Gauss round, Alex said.Those ships have rail guns.Belt ships with rail guns?Amos said.Did they get a fucking navy and no one told me?Jim, the hallway outside and the cabin on the other side are both in vacuum, Naomi said.The ships compromised.Holden started to respond, then caught a good look at the binder Naomi had glued over the breach.The white cover was stamped with black letters that read MCRN EMERGENCY PROCEDURES.He had to suppress a laugh that would almost certainly go manic on him.Jim, Naomi said, her voice worried.Im okay, Naomi, Holden replied, then took a deep breath.How long do those patches hold?Naomi shrugged with her hands, then started pulling her hair behind her head and tying it up with a red elastic band.Longer than the air will last.If everything around us is in vacuum, that means the cabins running on emergency bottles.No recycling.I dont know how much each room has, but it wont be more than a couple hours.Kinda makes you wish wed worn our fucking suits, dont it?Amos asked.Wouldnt have mattered, Alex said.Wed come over here in our enviro suits, theyd just have taken em away.Could have tried, Amos said.Well, if youd like to go back in time and do it over, be my guest, partner.Naomi sharply said, Hey, but then nothing more.No one was talking about Shed.They were working hard not to look at the body.Holden cleared his throat to get everyones attention, then floated to Sheds couch, drawing their eyes with him.He paused a moment, letting everyone get a good look at the decapitated body, then pulled a blanket from the storage drawer beneath the couch and strapped it down over Sheds body with the couchs restraints.Sheds been killed.Were in deep peril.Arguing wont extend our lives one second, Holden said, looking at each member of his crew in turn.What will?No one spoke.Holden turned to Naomi first.Naomi, what will keep us alive longer that we can do right now?he asked.Ill see if I can find the emergency air.The rooms built for six, and therere only there are four of us.I might be able to turn the flow down and stretch it longer.Good.Thank you.Alex?If theres anyone other than us, theyll be lookin for survivors.Ill start poundin on the bulkhead.They wont hear it in the vacuum, but if therere cabins with air, the soundll travel down the metal.Good plan.I refuse to believe were the only ones left on this ship, Holden said, then turned to Amos.Amos?Lemme check on that comm panel.Might be able to get the bridge or damage control or shit, something, Amos replied.Thanks.Id love to let someone know were still here, Holden said.People moved off to work while Holden floated in the air next to Shed.Naomi began yanking access panels off the bulkheads.Alex, hands pressed against a couch for leverage, lay on the deck and began to kick the bulkhead with his boots.The room vibrated slightly with each booming kick.Amos pulled a multi tool out of his pocket and began taking the comm panel apart.When Holden was sure everyone was busy, he put one hand on Sheds shoulder, just below the blankets spreading red stain.Im sorry, he whispered to the body.His eyes burned and he pressed them into the back of his thumbs.The comm unit was hanging out of the bulkhead on wires when it buzzed once, loudly.Amos yelped and pushed off hard enough to fly across the room.Holden caught him, wrenching his shoulder by trying to arrest the momentum of 120 kilos of Earther mechanic.The comm buzzed again.Holden let Amos go and floated to it.A yellow LED glowed next to the units white button.Holden pressed the button.The comm crackled to life with Lieutenant Kellys voice.Move away from the hatch, were coming in, he said.Grab something!Holden yelled to the crew, then grabbed a couch restraint and wrapped it around his hand and forearm.When the hatch opened, Holden expected all the air to rush out.Instead, there was a loud crack and the pressure dropped slightly for a second.Outside in the corridor, thick sheets of plastic had been sealed to the walls, creating an ad hoc airlock.The walls of the new chamber bowed out dangerously with the air pressure, but they held.Inside the newly created lock, Lieutenant Kelly and three of his marines wore heavy vacuum rated armor and carried enough weaponry to fight several minor wars.The marines moved quickly into the room, weapons ready, and then sealed the hatch behind them.One of them tossed a large bag at Holden.Five vac suits.Get them on, Kelly said.His eyes moved to the bloody blanket covering Shed, then to the two improvised patches.Casualty?Our medic, Shed Garvey, Holden replied.Yeah.What the fuck?Amos said loudly.Whos out there shooting the shit out of your fancy boat?Naomi and Alex said nothing but started pulling the suits from the bag and handing them out.I dont know, Kelly said.But were leaving right now.Ive been ordered to get you off this ship in an escape craft.Weve got less than ten minutes to make it to the hangar bay, take possession of a ship, and get out of this combat area.Dress fast.Holden put on his suit, the implications of their evacuation racing through his mind.Lieutenant, is the ship coming apart?he asked.Not yet.But were being boarded.Then why are we leaving?Were losing.Kelly didnt tap his foot while waiting for them to seal into their suits; Holden guessed this was only because the marines had their magnetic boots turned on.As soon as everyone had given the thumbs up, Kelly did a quick radio check on each suit, then headed back into the corridor.With eight people in it, four of them in powered armor, the mini airlock was tight.Kelly pulled a heavy knife from a sheath on his chest and slashed the plastic barrier open in one quick movement.The hatch behind them slammed shut, and the air in the corridor vanished in a soundless ripple of plastic flaps.Kelly charged into the corridor with the crew scrambling to keep up.We are moving with all speed to the keel elevator banks, Kelly said through the radio link.Theyre locked down because of the boarding alarm, but I can get the doors open on one and well float down the shaft to the hangar bay.Everything is on the double.If you see boarders, do not stop.Keep moving at all times.Well handle the hostiles.Roger that?Roger, Lieutenant, Holden gasped out.Why board you?The command information center, Alex said.Its the holy grail.Codes, deployments, computer cores, the works.Takin a flagships CIC is a strategists wet dream.Cut the chatter, Kelly said.Holden ignored him.That means theyll blow the core rather than let that happen, right?Yep, Alex replied.Standard ops for boarders.Marines hold the bridge, CIC, and engineering.If any of the three is breached, the other two flip the switch.The ship turns into a star for a few seconds.Standard ops, Kelly growled.Those are my friends.Sorry, El Tee, Alex replied.I served on the Bandon.Dont mean to make light.They turned a corner and the elevator bank came into view.All eight elevators were closed and sealed.The heavy pressure doors had slammed shut when the ship was holed.Gomez, run the bypass, Kelly said.Mole, Dookie, watch those corridors.Two of the marines spread out, watching the hallways through their gun sights.The third moved to one of the elevator doors and started doing something complicated to the controls.Holden motioned his crew to the wall, out of the firing lines.The deck vibrated slightly from time to time beneath his feet.The enemy ships wouldnt still be firing, not with their boarders inside.It must be small arms fire and light explosives.But as they stood there in the perfect quiet of vacuum, everything that was happening took on a distant and surreal feeling.Holden recognized that his mind wasnt working the way it should be.Trauma reaction.The destruction of the Canterbury, the deaths of Ade and McDowell.And now someone had killed Shed in his bunk.It was too much; he couldnt process it.He felt the scene around him grow more and more distant.Holden looked behind him at Naomi, Alex, and Amos.His crew.They stared back, faces ashen and ghostly in the green light of their suit displays.Gomez pumped his fist in triumph as the outer pressure door slid open, revealing the elevator doors.Kelly gestured to his men.The one called Mole turned around and started to walk to the elevator when his face disintegrated in a spray of pebble shaped bits of armored glass and blood.His armored torso and the corridor bulkhead beside him bloomed in a hundred small detonations and puffs of smoke.His body jerked and swayed, attached to the floor by magnetic boots.Holdens sense of unreality washed away in adrenaline.The fire spraying across the wall and Moles body was high explosive rounds from a rapid fire weapon.The comm channel filled with yelling from the marines and Holdens own crew.To Holdens left, Gomez yanked the elevator doors open using the augmented strength of his powered armor, exposing the empty shaft behind them.Inside!Kelly shouted.Everybody inside!Holden held back, pushing Naomi in, and then Alex.The last marine the one Kelly had called Dookie fired his rifle on full auto at some target around the corner from Holden.When the weapon ran dry, the marine dropped to one knee and ejected the clip in the same motion.Almost faster than Holden could follow, he pulled a new magazine from his harness and slapped it into his weapon.He was firing again less than two seconds after hed run out.Naomi yelled at Holden to get into the elevator shaft, and then a viselike hand grabbed his shoulder, yanked him off his magnetic grip on the floor, and hurled him through the open elevator doors.Get killed when Im not babysitting, Lieutenant Kelly barked.They shoved off the walls of the elevator shaft and flew down the long tunnel toward the aft of the ship.Holden kept looking back at the open door, receding into the distance behind them.Dookie isnt following us, he said.Hes covering our exit, Kelly replied.So we better get away, Gomez added.Make it mean something.Kelly, at the head of the group, grabbed at a rung on the wall of the shaft and came to a jerking stop.Everyone else followed suit.Heres our exit.Gomez, go check it out, Kelly said.Holden, heres the plan.Well be taking one of the corvettes from the hangar bay.That made sense to Holden.The corvette class was a light frigate.A fleet escort vessel, it was the smallest naval ship equipped with an Epstein drive.It would be fast enough to travel anywhere in the system and outrun most threats.Its secondary role was as a torpedo bomber, so it would also have teeth.Holden nodded inside his helmet at Kelly, then gestured for him to continue.Kelly waited until Gomez had finished opening the elevator doors and gone into the hangar bay.Okay, Ive got the key card and activation code to get us inside and the ship fired up.Ill be heading straight for it, so all of you stick right on my ass.Make sure your boot mags are off.Were going to push off the wall and fly to it, so aim straight or you miss your ride.Everyone with me?Affirmative replies all around.Outstanding.Gomez, whats it look like out there?Trouble, El Tee.Half a dozen boarders looking over the ships in the hangar.Powered armor, zero g maneuvering packs, and heavy weapons.Loaded for bear, Gomez whispered back.People always whispered when they were hiding.Wrapped in a space suit and surrounded by vacuum, Gomez could have been lighting fireworks inside his armor and no one would have heard it, but he whispered.We run for the ship and shoot our way through, Kelly said.Gomez, Im bringing the civvies in ten seconds.Youre covering fire.Shoot and displace.Try and make them think youre a small platoon.You callin me small, sir?Gomez said.Six dead assholes coming up.Holden, Amos, Alex, and Naomi followed Kelly out of the elevator shaft and into the hangar bay and stopped behind a stack of military green crates.Holden peeked over them, spotting the boarders immediately.They were in two groups of three near the Knight, one group walking on top of it and the other on the deck below it.Their armor was flat black.Holden hadnt seen the design before.Kelly pointed at them and looked at Holden.Holden nodded back.Kelly pointed across the hangar at a squat black frigate about twenty five meters away, halfway between them and the Knight.He held up his left hand and began counting down from five on his fingers.At two, the room strobed like a disco: Gomez opening fire from a position ten meters from their own.The first barrage hit two of the boarders on top of the Knight and hurled them spinning off.A heartbeat later, a second burst was fired five meters from where Holden had seen the first.He would have sworn it was two different men.Kelly folded up the last finger on his hand, planted his feet on the wall, and pushed off toward their corvette.Holden waited for Alex, Amos, and Naomi, then shoved off last.By the time he was in motion, Gomez was firing from a new location.One of the boarders on the deck pointed a large weapon toward the muzzle flash from Gomezs gun.Gomez and the crate hed been taking cover behind disappeared in fire and shrapnel.They were halfway to the ship and Holden was starting to think they might make it when a line of smoke crossed the room and intersected with Kelly, and the lieutenant disappeared in a flash of light.The Xinglong died stupid.Afterward, everyone knew she was one of thousands of small time rock hopping prospector ships.The Belt was lousy with them: five  or six family operations that had scraped together enough for a down payment and set up operations.When it happened, theyd been three payments behind, and their bank Consolidated Holdings and Investments had put a lien on the ship.Which, common wisdom had it, was why they had disabled her transponder.Just honest folks with a rust bucket to call their own trying to keep flying.If you were going to make a poster of the Belters dream, it would have been the Xinglong.The Scipio Africanus, a patrol destroyer, was due to head back down toward Mars at the end of its two year tour of the Belt.They both headed for a captured cometary body a few hundred thousand kilometers from Chiron to top off their water.When the prospecting ship first came in range, the Scipio saw a fast moving ship running dark and headed more or less in their direction.The official Martian press releases all said that the Scipio had tried repeatedly to hail her.The OPA pirate casts all said it was crap and that no listening station in the Belt had heard anything like that.Everyone agreed that the Scipio had opened its point defense cannons and turned the prospecting ship into glowing slag.The reaction had been as predictable as elementary physics.The Martians were diverting another couple dozen ships to help maintain order.The OPAs shriller talking heads called for open war, and fewer and fewer of the independent sites and casts were disagreeing with them.The great, implacable clockwork of war ticked one step closer to open fighting.And someone on Ceres had put a Martian born citizen named Enrique Dos Santos through eight or nine hours of torture and nailed the remains to a wall near sector elevens water reclamation works.They identified him by the terminal that had been left on the floor along with the mans wedding ring and a thin faux leather wallet with his credit access data and thirty thousand Europa script new yen.The dead Martian had been affixed to the wall with a single charge prospectors spike.Five hours afterward, the air recyclers were still laboring to get the acid smell out.The forensics team had taken their samples.They were about ready to cut the poor bastard down.It always surprised Miller how peaceful dead people looked.However godawful the circumstances, the slack calm that came at the end looked like sleep.It made him wonder if when his turn came, hed actually feel that last relaxation.Surveillance cameras?he said.Been out for three days, his new partner said.Kids busted em.Octavia Muss was originally from crimes against persons, back before Star Helix split violence up into smaller specialties.From there, shed been on the rape squad.Then a couple of months of crimes against children.If the woman still had a soul, it had been pressed thin enough to see through.Her eyes never registered anything more than mild surprise.We know which kids?Some punks from upstairs, she said.Booked, fined, released into the wild.We should round em back up, Miller said.Itd be interesting to know whether someone paid them to take out these particular cameras.Id bet against it.Then whoever did this had to know that these cameras were busted.Someone in maintenance?Or a cop.Muss smacked her lips and shrugged.Shed come from three generations in the Belt.She had family on ships like the one the Scipio had killed.The skin and bone and gristle hanging in front of them were no surprise to her.You dropped a hammer under thrust, and it fell to the deck.Your government slaughtered six families of ethnic Chinese prospectors, someone pinned you to the living rock of Ceres with a three foot titanium alloy spike.Same same.Theres going to be consequences, Miller said, meaning This isnt a corpse, its a billboard.Its a call to war.There aint, Muss said.The war is here anyway, banner or no.Yeah, Miller said.Youre right.There aint.You want to do next of kin?Ill go take a look at outlying video.They didnt burn his fingers off here in the corridor, so they had to haul him in from somewhere.Yeah, Miller said.Ive got a sympathy form letter I can fire off.Wife?Dont know, she said.Havent looked.Back at the station house, Miller sat alone at his desk.Muss already had her own desk, two cubicles over and customized the way she liked it.Havelocks desk was empty and cleaned twice over, as if the custodial services had wanted the smell of Earth off their good Belter chair.Miller pulled up the dead mans file, found the next of kin.Jun Yee Dos Santos, working on Ganymede.Married six years.No kids.Well, there was something to be glad of, at least.If you were going to die, at least you shouldnt leave a mark.He navigated to the form letter, dropped in the new widows name and contact address.Dear Mrs.Dos Santos, I am very sorry to have to tell you blah blah blah.Your [he spun through the menu] husband was a valued and respected member of the Ceres community, and I assure you that everything possible will be done to see that her [Miller toggled that] his killer or killers will be brought to answer for this.Yours  It was inhuman.It was impersonal and cold and as empty as vacuum.The hunk of flesh on that corridor wall had been a real man with passions and fears, just like anyone else.Miller wanted to wonder what it said about him that he could ignore that fact so easily, but the truth was he knew.He sent the message and tried not to dwell on the pain it was about to cause.The board was thick.The incident count was twice what it should have been.This is what it looks like, he thought.No riots.No hole by hole military action or marines in the corridors.Just a lot of unsolved homicides.Then he corrected himself: This is what it looks like so far.It didnt make his next task any easier.Shaddid was in her office.What can I do for you?she asked.I need to make some requisitions for interrogation transcripts, he said.But its a little irregular.I was thinking it might be better if it came through you.Shaddid sat back in her chair.Ill look at it, she said.What are we trying to get?Miller nodded, as if by signaling yes himself, he could get her to say the same.Jim Holden.The Earther from the Canterbury.Mars should be picking his people up around now, and I need to petition for the debriefing transcripts.You have a case that goes back to the Canterbury?Yeah, he said.Seems like I do.Tell me, she said.Tell me now.Its the side job.Julie Mao.Ive been looking into it   I saw your report.So you know shes associated with the OPA.From what Ive found, it looks like she was on a freighter that was doing courier runs for them.You have proof of that?I have an OPA guy that said as much.On the record?No, Miller said.It was informal.And it tied into the Martian navy killing the Canterbury how?She was on the Scopuli, Miller said.It was used as bait to stop the Canterbury.The thing is, you look at the broadcasts Holden makes, he talks about finding it with a Mars Navy beacon and no crew.And you think theres something in there thatll help you?Wont know until I see it, Miller said.But if Julie wasnt on that freighter, then someone had to take her off.Shaddids smile didnt reach her eyes.And you would like to ask the Martian navy to please hand over whatever they got from Holden.If he saw something on that boat, something thatll give us an idea what happened to Julie and the other   You arent thinking this through, Shaddid said.The Mars Navy killed the Canterbury.They did it to provoke a reaction from the Belt so theyd have an excuse to roll in and take us over.The only reason theyre debriefing the survivors is so that no one could get to the poor bastards first.Holden and his crew are either dead or getting their minds cored out by Martian interrogation specialists right now.We cant be sure   And even if I could get a full record of what they said as each toenail got ripped off, it would do you exactly no good, Miller.The Martian navy isnt going to ask about the Scopuli.They know good and well what happened to the crew.They planted the Scopuli.Is that Star Helixs official stand?Miller asked.The words were barely out of his mouth before he saw theyd been a mistake.Shaddids face closed down like a light going out.Now that hed said it, he saw the implied threat hed just made.Im just pointing out the source reliability issue, Shaddid said.You dont go to the suspect and ask where they think you should look next.And the Juliette Mao retrieval isnt your first priority.Im not saying it is, Miller said, chagrined to hear the defensiveness in his voice.We have a board out there thats full and getting fuller.Our first priorities are safety and continuity of services.If what youre doing isnt directly related to that, there are better things for you to be doing.This war   Isnt our job, Shaddid said.Our job is Ceres.Get me a final report on Juliette Mao.Ill send it through channels.Weve done what we could.I dont think   I do, Shaddid said.Weve done what we could.Now stop being a pussy, get your ass out there, and catch bad guys.Detective.Yes, Captain, Miller said.Muss was sitting at Millers desk when he got back to it, a cup in her hand that was either strong tea or weak coffee.She nodded toward his desktop monitor.On it, three Belters two men and one woman were coming out of a warehouse door, an orange plastic shipping container carried between them.Miller raised his eyebrows.Employed by an independent gas hauling company.Nitrogen, oxygen.Basic atmospherics.Nothing exotic.Looks like they had the poor bastard in one of the company warehouses.Ive sent forensics over to see if we can get any blood splatters for confirmation.Good work, Miller said.Muss shrugged.Adequate work, she seemed to say.Where are the perps?Miller asked.Shipped out yesterday, she said.Flight plan logs them as headed for Io.Io?Earth Mars Coalition central, Muss said.Want to put any money on whether they actually show up there?Sure, Miller said.Ill lay you fifty that they dont.Muss actually laughed.Ive put them on the alert system, she said.Anyplace they land, the locals will have a heads up and a tracking number for the Dos Santos thing.So case closed, Miller said.Chalk another one up for the good guys, Muss agreed.The rest of the day was hectic.Three assaults, two of them overtly political and one domestic.Muss and Miller cleared all three from the board before the end of shift.There would be more by tomorrow.After he clocked out, Miller stopped at a food cart near one of the tube stations for a bowl of vat rice and textured protein that approximated teriyaki chicken.All around him on the tube, normal citizens of Ceres read their newsfeeds and listened to music.A young couple half a car up from him leaned close to each other, murmuring and giggling.They might have been sixteen.Seventeen.He saw the boys wrist snake up under the girls shirt.She didnt protest.An old woman directly across from Miller slept, her head lolling against the wall of the car, her snores almost delicate.These people were what it was all about, Miller told himself.Normal people living small lives in a bubble of rock surrounded by hard vacuum.If they let the station turn into a riot zone, let order fail, all these lives would get turned into kibble like a kitten in a meat grinder.Making sure it didnt happen was for people like him, Muss, even Shaddid.So, a small voice said in the back of his mind, why isnt it your job to stop Mars from dropping a nuke and cracking Ceres like an egg?Whats the bigger threat to that guy standing over there, a few unlicensed whores or a Belt at war with Mars?What was the harm that could come from knowing what happened to the Scopuli?But of course he knew the answer to that.He couldnt judge how dangerous the truth was until he knew it which was itself a fine reason to keep going.The OPA man, Anderson Dawes, was sitting on a cloth folding chair outside Millers hole, reading a book.It was a real book onionskin pages bound in what might have been actual leather.Miller had seen pictures of them before; the idea of that much weight for a single megabyte of data struck him as decadent.Detective.Mr.Dawes.I was hoping we could talk.Miller was glad, as they went inside together, that hed cleaned up a little.All the beer bottles had gone to recycler.The tables and cabinets were dusted.The cushions on the chairs had all been mended or replaced.As Dawes took his seat, Miller realized hed done the housework in anticipation of this meeting.He hadnt realized it until now.Dawes put his book on the table, dug in his jacket pocket, and slid a thin black filmdrive across the table.Miller picked it up.What am I going to see on this?he asked.Nothing you cant confirm in the records, Dawes answered.Anything fabricated?Yes, Dawes said.His grin did nothing to improve his appearance.But not by us.You asked about the police riot gear.It was signed for by a Sergeant Pauline Trikoloski for transfer to special services unit twenty three.Special services twenty three?Yes, Dawes said.It doesnt exist.Nor does Trikoloski.The equipment was all boxed up, signed for, and delivered to a dock.The freighter in the berth at the time was registered to the Corpora do Gato Preto.Black Cat?You know them?Import export, same as everyone else, Miller said with a shrug.We investigated them as a possible front for the Loca Greiga.Never tied them down, though.You were right.You prove it?Not my job, Dawes said.But this might interest you.Automated docking logs for the ship when she left here and when she arrived on Ganymede.Shes three tons lighter, not even counting reaction mass consumption.And the transit time is longer than the orbital mechanics projections.Someone met her, Miller said.Transferred the gear to another ship.Theres your answer, Dawes said.Both of them.The riot gear was taken off the station by local organized crime.There arent records to support it, but I think its safe to assume that they also shipped out the personnel to use that gear.Where to?Dawes lifted his hands.Miller nodded.They were off station.Case closed.Another one for the good guys.Damn.Ive kept my part of our bargain, Dawes said.You asked for information.Ive gotten it.Now, are you going to keep your end?Drop the Mao investigation, Miller said.It wasnt a question, and Dawes didnt act is if it were.Miller leaned back in his chair.Juliette Andromeda Mao.Inner system heiress turned OPA courier.Pinnace racer.Brown belt, aiming for black.Sure, what the hell, he said.Its not like I would have shipped her back home if Id found her.No?Miller shifted his hands in a gesture that meant Of course not.Shes a good kid, Miller said.How would you feel if you were all grown up and Mommy could still pull you back home by your ear?It was a bullshit job from the start.Dawes smiled again.This time it actually did help a little.Im glad to hear you say that, Detective.And I wont forget the rest of our agreement.When we find her, I will tell you.Youve got my word on it.I appreciate that, Miller said.There was a moment of silence.Miller couldnt decide if it was companionable or awkward.Maybe there was room for both.Dawes rose, put out his hand.Miller shook it.Dawes left.Two cops working for different sides.Maybe they had something in common.Didnt mean Miller was uncomfortable lying to the man.He opened his terminals encryption program, routed it to his communication suite, and started talking into the camera.We havent met, sir, but I hope youll find a few minutes to help me out.Im Detective Miller with Star Helix Security.Im on the Ceres security contract, and Ive been tasked with finding your daughter.Ive got a couple questions.Holden grabbed for Naomi.He struggled to orient himself as the two of them spun across the bay with nothing to push off of and nothing to arrest their flight.They were in the middle of the room with no cover.The blast had hurled Kelly five meters through the air and into the side of a packing crate, where he was floating now, one magnetic boot connected to the side of the container, the other struggling to connect with the deck.Amos had been blown down, and lay flat on the floor, his lower leg stuck out at an impossible angle.Alex crouched at his side.Holden craned his neck, looking toward the attackers.There was the boarder with the grenade launcher who had blasted Kelly, lining up on them for the killing shot.Were dead, Holden thought.Naomi made an obscene gesture.The man with the grenade launcher shuddered and dissolved in a spray of blood and small detonations.Get to the ship!Gomez screamed from the radio.His voice was grating and high, half shrieking pain and half battle ecstasy.Holden pulled the tether line off Naomis suit.What are you?she began.Trust me, he said, then put his feet into her stomach and shoved off, hard.He hit the deck while she spun toward the ceiling.He kicked on his boot mags and then yanked the tether to pull her down to him.The room strobed with sustained machine gun fire.Holden said, Stay low, and ran as quickly as his magnetic boots would allow toward Alex and Amos.The mechanic moved his limbs feebly, so he was still alive.Holden realized he still had the end of Naomis tether in his hand, so he clipped it on to a loop on his suit.No more getting separated.Holden lifted Amos off the deck, then checked the inertia.The mechanic grunted and muttered something obscene.Holden attached Amos tether to his suit too.Hed carry the whole crew if that was what it took.Without saying a word, Alex clipped his tether to Holden and gave him a weary thumbs up.That was I mean, fuck, Alex said.Yeah, Holden said.Jim, Naomi said.Look!Holden followed her gaze.Kelly was staggering toward them.His armor was visibly crushed on the left side of his torso, and hydraulic fluid leaked from his suit into a trail of droplets floating behind him, but he was moving toward the frigate.Okay, Holden said.Lets go.The five of them moved as a group to the ship, the air around them filled with pieces of packing crates blown apart by the ongoing battle.A wasp stung Holdens arm, and his suits head up display informed him that it had sealed a minor breach.He felt something warm trickle down his bicep.Gomez shouted like a madman over the radio as he dashed around the outer edge of the bay, firing wildly.The return fire was constant.Holden saw the marine hit again and again, small explosions and ablative clouds coming off his suit until Holden could hardly believe that there could be anything inside it still living.But Gomez kept the enemys attention, and Holden and the crew were able to limp up to the half cover of the corvettes airlock.Kelly pulled a small metal card from a pocket on his armor.A swipe of the card opened the outer door, and Holden pulled Amos floating body inside.Naomi, Alex, and the wounded marine came in after, staring at each other in shocked disbelief as the airlock cycled and the inner doors opened.I cant believe we  Alex said; then his voice trailed off.Talk about it later, Kelly barked.Alex Kamal, you served on MCRN ships.Can you fly this thing?Sure, El Tee, Alex replied, then visibly straightened.Why me?Our other pilots outside getting killed.Take this, Kelly said, handing him the metal card.The rest of you, get strapped in.Weve lost a lot of time.Up close, the damage to Kellys armor was even more apparent.He had to have severe injuries to his chest.And not all the liquid coming out of the suit was hydraulic fluid.There was definitely blood as well.Let me help you, Holden said, reaching for him.Dont touch me, Kelly said, with an anger that took Holden by surprise.You get strapped in, and you shut the fuck up.Now.Holden didnt argue.He unhooked the tethers from his suit and helped Naomi maneuver Amos to the crash couches and strap him in.Kelly stayed on the deck above, but his voice came over the ships comm.Mr.Kamal, are we ready to fly?he said.Roger that, El Tee.The reactor was already hot when we got here.The Tachi was the ready standby.Thats why were taking her.Now go.As soon as we clear the hangar, full throttle.Roger, Alex said.Gravity returned in tiny bursts at random directions as Alex lifted the ship off the deck and spun it toward the hangar door.Holden finished putting on his straps and checked to see that Naomi and Amos were squared away.The mechanic was moaning and holding on to the edge of the couch with a death grip.You still with us, Amos?Holden said.Fan fucking tastic, Cap.Oh shit, I can see Gomez, Alex said over the comm.Hes down.Aw, you goddammed bastards!Theyre shootin him while hes down!Son of a bitch!The ship stopped moving, and Alex said in a quiet voice, Suck on this, asshole.The ship vibrated for half a second, then paused before continuing toward the lock.Point defense cannons?Holden asked.Summary roadside justice, Alex grunted back.Holden was imagining what several hundred rounds of Teflon coated tungsten steel going five thousand meters per second would do to human bodies when Alex threw down the throttle and a roomful of elephants swan dived onto his chest.* * *   Holden woke in zero g.  His eye sockets and testicles ached, so theyd been at high thrust for a while.The wall terminal next to him said it had been almost half an hour.Naomi was moving in her couch, but Amos was unconscious, and blood was coming out of a hole in his suit at an alarming rate.Naomi, check Amos, Holden croaked, his throat aching with the effort.Alex, report.The Donnie went up behind us, Cap.Guess the marines didnt hold.Shes gone, Alex said in a subdued voice.The six attacking ships?I havent seen any sign of them since the explosion.Id guess theyre toast.Holden nodded to himself.Summary roadside justice, indeed.Boarding a ship was one of the riskiest maneuvers in naval combat.It was basically a race between the boarders rushing to the engine room and the collective will of those who had their fingers on the self destruct button.After even one look at Captain Yao, Holden could have told them whod lose that race.Still.Someone had thought it was worth the risk.Holden pulled his straps off and floated over to Amos.Naomi had opened an emergency kit and was cutting the mechanics suit off with a pair of heavy scissors.The hole had been punched out by a jagged end of Amos broken tibia when the suit had pushed against it at twelve g.   When shed finished cutting the suit away, Naomi blanched at the mass of blood and gore that Amos lower leg had turned into.What do we do?Holden asked.Naomi just stared at him, then barked out a harsh laugh.I have no idea, she said.But you  Holden started.She talked right over him.If he were made of metal, Id just hammer him straight and then weld everything into place, she said.I   But he isnt made out of ship parts, she continued, her voice rising into a yell, so why are you asking me what to do?Holden held up his hands in a placating gesture.Okay, got it.Lets just stop the bleeding for now, all right?If Alex gets killed, are you going to ask me to fly the ship too?Holden started to answer and then stopped.She was right.Whenever he didnt know what to do, he handed off to Naomi.Hed been doing it for years.She was smart, capable, usually unflappable.Shed become a crutch, and shed been through all the same trauma he had.If he didnt start paying attention, hed break her, and he needed not to do that.Youre right.Ill take care of Amos, he said.You go up and check on Kelly.Ill be there in a few minutes.Naomi stared at him until her breathing slowed, then said, Okay, and headed to the crew ladder.Holden sprayed Amos leg with coagulant booster and wrapped it in gauze from the first aid kit.Then he called up the ships database on the wall terminal and did a search on compound fractures.He was reading it with growing dismay when Naomi called.Kellys dead, she said, her voice flat.Holdens stomach dropped, and he gave himself three breaths to get the panic out of his voice.Okay.Ill need your help setting this bone.Come on back down.Alex?Give me half a g of thrust while we work on Amos.Any particular direction, Cap?Alex asked.I dont care, just give me half a g and stay off the radio till I say so.Naomi dropped back down the ladder well as the gravity started to come up.It looks like every rib on the left side of Kellys body was broken, she said.Thrust g probably punctured all his organs.He had to know that was going to happen, Holden said.Yeah.It was easy to make fun of the marines when they werent listening.In Holdens navy days, making fun of jarheads was as natural as cussing.But four marines had died getting him off the Donnager, and three of them had made a conscious decision to do so.Holden promised himself that hed never make fun of them again.We need to pull the bone straight before we set it.Hold him still, and Ill pull on his foot.Let me know when the bone has retracted and lined up again.Naomi started to protest.I know youre not a doctor.Just best guess, Holden said.It was one of the most horrible things Holden had ever done.Amos woke up screaming during the procedure.He had to pull the leg out twice, because the first time the bones didnt line up, and when he let go, the jagged end of the tibia popped back out the hole in a spray of blood.Fortunately, Amos passed out after that and they were able to make the second attempt without the screaming.It seemed to work.Holden sprayed the wound down with antiseptics and coagulants.He stapled the hole closed and slapped a growth stimulating bandage over it, then finished up with a quick form air cast and an antibiotic patch on the mechanics thigh.Afterward he collapsed onto the deck and gave in to the shakes.Naomi climbed into her couch and sobbed.It was the first time Holden had ever seen her cry.* * *   Holden, Alex, and Naomi floated in a loose triangle around the crash couch where Lieutenant Kellys body lay.Below, Amos was in a heavily sedated sleep.The Tachi drifted through space toward no particular destination.For the first time in a long time, no one followed.Holden knew the other two were waiting for him.Waiting to hear how he was going to save them.They looked at him expectantly.He tried to appear calm and thoughtful.Inside, he panicked.He had no idea where to go.No idea what to do.Ever since theyd found the Scopuli, everywhere that should have been safe had turned into a death trap.The Canterbury, the Donnager.Holden was terrified of going anywhere, for fear that it would be blown up moments later.Do something, a mentor of a decade earlier said to his young officers.It doesnt have to be right, it just has to be something.Someone is going to investigate what happened to the Donnager, Holden said.Martian ships are speeding to that spot as we speak.Theyll already know the Tachi got away, because our transponder is blabbing our survival to the solar system at large.No it aint, Alex said.Explain that, Mr.Kamal.This is a torpedo bomber.You think they want a nice transponder signal to lock on to when theyre makin runs on an enemy capital ship?Naw, theres a handy switch up in the cockpit that says transponder off.I flipped it before we flew out.Were just another moving object out of a million like us.Holden was silent for two long breaths.Alex, that may be the single greatest thing anyone has ever done, in the history of the universe, he said.But we cant land, Jim, Naomi said.One, no port is going to let a ship with no transponder signal anywhere near them, and two, as soon as they make us out visually, the fact that were a Martian warship will be hard to hide.Yep, thats the downside, Alex agreed.Fred Johnson, Holden said, gave us the network address to get in touch with him.Im thinking that the OPA might be the one group that would let us land our stolen Martian warship somewhere.It aint stolen, Alex said.Its legitimate salvage now.Yeah, you make that argument to the MCRN if they catch us, but lets try and make sure they dont.So, we just wait here till Colonel Johnson gets back to us?Alex asked.No, I wait.You two prep Lieutenant Kelly for burial.Alex, you were MCRN.You know the traditions.Do it with full honors and record it in the log.He died to get us off that ship, and were going to accord him every respect.As soon as we land anywhere, well bounce the full record to MCRN command so they can do it officially.Alex nodded.Well do it right, sir.* * *   Fred Johnson replied to his message so fast that Holden wondered if hed been sitting at his terminal waiting for it.Johnsons message consisted only of coordinates and the word tightbeam.Holden aimed the laser array at the specified location it was the same one Fred had beamed his first message from then turned on his mic and said, Fred?The coordinates given were more than eleven light minutes away.Holden prepared to wait twenty two minutes for his answer.Just to have something to do, he fed the location up to the cockpit and told Alex to fly in that direction at one g as soon as theyd finished with Lieutenant Kelly.Twenty minutes later the thrust came up and Naomi climbed the ladder.Shed stripped off her vacuum suit and was wearing a red Martian jumpsuit that was half a foot too short for her and three times too big around.Her hair and face looked clean.This ship has a head with a shower.Can we keep it?she said.Howd it go?We took care of him.Theres a decent sized cargo bay down by engineering.We put him there until we can find some way to send him home.I turned off the environment in there, so hell stay preserved.She held out her hand and dropped a small black cube into his lap.That was in a pocket under his armor, she said.Holden held up the object.It looked like some sort of data storage device.Can you find out whats on it?he asked.Sure.Give me some time.And Amos?Blood pressures steady, Naomi said.Thats got to be a good thing.The comm console beeped at them, and Holden started the playback.Jim, news of the Donnager has just started hitting the net.I admit I am extremely surprised to be hearing from you, said Freds voice.What can I do for you?Holden paused a moment while he mentally prepared his response.Freds suspicion was palpable, but hed sent Holden a keyword to use for exactly that reason.Fred.While our enemies have become ubiquitous, our list of friends has grown kind of short.In fact, youre pretty much it.I am in a stolen   Alex cleared his throat.A salvaged MCRN gunboat, Holden went on.I need a way to hide that fact.I need somewhere to go where they wont just shoot me down for showing up.Help me do that.It was half an hour before the reply came.Ive attached a datafile on a subchannel, Fred said.Its got your new transponder code and directions on how to install it.The code will check out in all the registries.Its legitimate.Its also got coordinates that will get you to a safe harbor.Ill meet you there.We have a lot to talk about.New transponder code?Naomi said.How does the OPA get new transponder codes?Hack the Earth Mars Coalitions security protocols or get a mole in the registry office, Holden said.Either way, I think were playing in the big league now.Miller watched the feed from Mars along with the rest of the station.The podium was draped in black, which was a bad sign.The single star and thirty stripes of the Martian Congressional Republic hung in the background not once, but eight times.That was worse.This cannot happen without careful planning, the Martian president said.The information they sought to steal would have compromised Martian fleet security in a profound and fundamental way.They failed, but at the price of two thousand and eighty six Martian lives.This aggression is something the Belt has been preparing for years at the least.The Belt, Miller noticed.Not the OPA the Belt.In the week since first news of that attack, we have seen thirty incursions into the security radius of Martian ships and bases, including Pallas Station.If those refineries were to be lost, the economy of Mars could suffer irreversible damage.In the face of an armed, organized guerrilla force, we have no choice but to enforce a military cordon on the stations, bases, and ships of the Belt.Congress has delivered new orders to all naval elements not presently involved in active Coalition duty, and it is our hope that our brothers and sisters of Earth will approve joint Coalition maneuvers with the greatest possible speed.The new mandate of the Martian navy is to secure the safety of all honest citizens, to dismantle the infrastructures of evil presently hiding in the Belt, and bring to justice those responsible for these attacks.I am pleased to say that our initial actions have resulted in the destruction of eighteen illegal warships and   Miller turned off the feed.That was it, then.The secret war was out of the closet.Papa Mao had been right to want Julie out, but it was too late.His darling daughter was going to have to take her chances, just like everyone else.At the very least, it was going to mean curfews and personnel tracking all through Ceres Station.Officially, the station was neutral.The OPA didnt own it or anything else.And Star Helix was an Earth corporation, not under contractual or treaty obligation to Mars.At best, Mars and the OPA would keep their fight outside the station.At worst, there would more riots on Ceres.More death.No, that wasnt true.At worst, Mars or the OPA would make a statement by throwing a rock or a handful of nuclear warheads at the station.Or by blowing a fusion drive on a docked ship.If things got out of hand, it would mean six or seven million dead people and the end of everything Miller had ever known.Odd that it should feel almost like relief.For weeks, Miller had known.Everyone had known.But it hadnt actually happened, so every conversation, every joke, every chance interaction and semi anonymous nod and polite moment of light banter on the tube had seemed like an evasion.He couldnt fix the cancer of war, couldnt even slow down the spread, but at least he could admit it was happening.He stretched, ate his last bite of fungal curds, drank the dregs of something not entirely unlike coffee, and headed out to keep peace in wartime.Muss greeted him with a vague nod when he got to the station house.The board was filled with cases crimes to be investigated, documented, and dismissed.Twice as many entries as the day before.Bad night, Miller said.Could be worse, Muss said.Yeah?Star Helix could be a Mars corporation.As long as Earth stays neutral, we dont have to actually be the Gestapo.And how long you figure thatll last?What time is it?she asked.Tell you what, though.When it does come down, I need to make a stop up toward the core.There was this one guy back when I was rape squad we could never quite nail.Why wait?Miller asked.We could go up, put a bullet in him, be back by lunch.Yeah, but you know how it is, she said.Trying to stay professional.Anyway, if we did that, wed have to investigate it, and theres no room on the board.Miller sat at his desk.It was just shoptalk.The kind of over the top deadpan you did when your day was filled with underage whores and tainted drugs.And still, there was a tension in the station.It was in the way people laughed, the way they held themselves.There were more holsters visible than usual, as if by showing their weapons they might be made safe.You think its the OPA?Muss asked.Her voice was lower now.That killed the Donnager, you mean?Who else could?Plus which, theyre taking credit for it.Some of them are.From what I heard, theres more than one OPA these days.The old school guys dont know a goddamn thing about any of this.All shitting their pants and trying to track down the pirate casts that are claiming credit.So they can do what?Miller asked.You can shut down every loudmouth caster in the Belt, it wont change a thing.If theres a schism in the OPA, though  Muss looked at the board.If there was a schism within the OPA, the board as they saw it now was nothing.Miller had lived through two major gang wars.First when the Loca Greiga displaced and destroyed the Aryan Flyers, and then when the Golden Bough split.The OPA was bigger, and meaner, and more professional than any of them.That would be civil war in the Belt.Might not happen, Miller said.Shaddid stepped out of her office, her gaze sweeping the station house.Conversations dimmed.Shaddid caught Millers eye.She made a sharp gesture.Get in the office.Busted, Muss said.In the office, Anderson Dawes sat at ease on one of the chairs.Miller felt his body twitch as that information fell into place.Mars and the Belt in open, armed conflict.The OPAs face on Ceres sitting with the captain of the security force.So thats how it is, he thought.Youre working the Mao job, Shaddid said as she took her seat.Miller hadnt been offered the option of sitting, so he clasped his hands behind him.You assigned it to me, he said.And I told you it wasnt a priority, she said.I disagreed, Miller said.Dawes smiled.It was a surprisingly warm expression, especially compared to Shaddids.Detective Miller, Dawes said.You dont understand whats happening here.We are sitting on a pressure vessel, and you keep swinging a pickax at it.You need to stop that.Youre off the Mao case, Shaddid said.Do you understand that?I am officially removing you from that investigation as of right now.Any further investigation you do, I will have you disciplined for working outside your caseload and misappropriating Star Helix resources.You will return any material on the case to me.You will wipe any data you have in your personal partition.And youll do it before the end of shift.Millers brain spun, but he kept his face impassive.She was taking Julie away.He wasnt going to let her.That was a given.But it wasnt the first issue.I have some inquiries in process  he began.No, you dont, Shaddid said.Your little letter to the parents was a breach of policy.Any contact with the shareholders should have come through me.Youre telling me it didnt go out, Miller said.Meaning Youve been monitoring me.It did not, Shaddid said.Yes, I have.What are you going to do about it?And there wasnt anything he could do.And the transcripts of the James Holden interrogation?Miller said.Did those get out before   Before the Donnanger was destroyed, taking with it the only living witnesses to the Scopuli and plunging the system into war?Miller knew the question sounded like a whine.Shaddids jaw tensed.He wouldnt have been surprised to hear teeth cracking.Dawes broke the silence.I think we can make this a little easier, he said.Detective, if Im hearing you right, you think were burying the issue.We arent.But its not in anyones interests that Star Helix be the one to find the answers youre looking for.Think about it.You may be a Belter, but youre working for an Earth corporation.Right now, Earth is the only major power without an oar in the water.The only one who can possibly negotiate with all sides.And so why wouldnt they want to know the truth?Miller said.That isnt the problem, Dawes said.The problem is that Star Helix and Earth cant appear to be involved one way or the other.Their hands need to stay clean.And this issue leads outside your contract.Juliette Mao isnt on Ceres, and maybe there was a time you could have jumped a ship to wherever you found her and done the abduction.Extradition.Extraction.Whatever you want to call it.But that time has passed.Star Helix is Ceres, part of Ganymede, and a few dozen warehouse asteroids.If you leave that, youre going into enemy territory.But the OPA isnt, Miller said.We have the resources to do this right, Dawes said with a nod.Mao is one of ours.The Scopuli was one of ours.And the Scopuli was the bait that killed the Canterbury, Miller said.And the Canterbury was the bait that killed the Donnager.So why exactly would anyone be better off having you be the only ones looking into something you might have done?You think we nuked the Canterbury, Dawes said.The OPA, with its state of the art Martian warships?It got the Donnanger out where it could be attacked.As long as it was with the fleet, it couldnt have been boarded.Dawes looked sour.Conspiracy theories, Mr.Miller, he said.If we had cloaked Martian warships, we wouldnt be losing.You had enough to kill the Donnanger with just six ships.No.We didnt.Our version of blowing up the Donnager is a whole bunch of tramp prospectors loaded with nukes going on a suicide mission.We have many, many resources.What happened to the Donnager wasnt part of them.The silence was broken only by the hum of the air recycler.Miller crossed his arms.But I dont understand, he said.If the OPA didnt start this, who did?That is what Juliette Mao and the crew of the Scopuli can tell us, Shaddid said.Those are the stakes, Miller.Who and why and please Christ some idea of how to stop it.And you dont want to find them?Miller said.I dont want you to, Dawes said.Not when someone else can do it better.Miller shook his head.It was going too far, and he knew it.On the other hand, sometimes going too far could tell you something too.Im not sold, he said.You dont have to be sold, Shaddid said.This isnt a negotiation.We arent bringing you in to ask you for a goddamn favor.I am your boss.I am telling you.Do you know those words?Telling.You.We have Holden, Dawes said.What?Miller said at the same time Shaddid said, Youre not supposed to talk about that.Dawes raised an arm toward Shaddid in the Belts physical idiom of telling someone to be quiet.To Millers surprise, she did as the OPA man said.We have Holden.He and his crew didnt die, and they are or are about to be in OPA custody.Do you understand what Im saying, Detective?Do you see my point?I can do this investigation because I have the resources to do it.You cant even find out what happened to your own riot gear.It was a slap.Miller looked at his shoes.Hed broken his word to Dawes about dropping the case, and the man hadnt brought it up until now.He had to give the OPA operative points for that.Added to that, if Dawes really did have James Holden, there was no chance of Millers getting access to the interrogation.When Shaddid spoke, her voice was surprisingly gentle.There were three murders yesterday.Eight warehouses got broken into, probably by the same bunch of people.Weve got six people in hospital wards around the station with their nerves falling apart from a bad batch of bathtub pseudoheroin.The whole stations jumpy, she said.Theres a lot of good you can do out there, Miller.Go catch some bad guys.Sure, Captain, Miller said.You bet.
