he asked her.Before she could answer he turned to Rick.Who are you?he demanded.Luba Luft said, He came into my dressing room; Ive never seen him before in my life.He pretended to be taking a poll or something and he wanted to ask me questions; I thought it was all right and I said okay, and then he began asking me obscene questions.Lets see your identification, the harness bull said to Rick, his hand extended.As he got out his ID Rick said, Im a bounty hunter with the department.I know all the bounty hunters, the harness bull said to Rick as he examined Ricks wallet.With the S.  F.  Police Department?My supervisor is Inspector Harry Bryant, Rick said.Ive taken over Dave Holdens list, now that Daves in the hospital.As I say, I know all the bounty hunters, the harness bull said, and Ive never heard of you.He handed Ricks ID back to him.Call Inspector Bryant, Rick said.There isnt any Inspector Bryant, the harness bull said.It came to Rick what was going on.Youre an android, he said to the harness bull.Like Miss Luft.Going to the vidphone he picked up the receiver himself.Im going to call the department.He wondered how far be would get before the two androids stopped him.The number, the harness bull said, is  I know the number.Rick dialed, presently had the police switchboard operator.Let me talk to Inspector Bryant, he said.Who is calling, please?This is Rick Deckard.He stood waiting; meanwhile, off to one side, the harness bull was getting a statement from Luba Luft; neither paid any attention to him.A pause and then Harry Bryants face appeared on the vidscreen.Whats doing?he asked Rick.Some trouble, Rick said.One of those on Daves list managed to call in and get a so called patrolman out here.I cant seem to prove to him who I am; he says he knows all the about hunters in the department and hes never heard of me.He added, He hasnt heard of you either.Bryant said, Let me talk to him.Inspector Bryant wants to talk to you.Rick held out the vidphone receiver.The harness bull ceased questioning Miss Luft and came over to take it.Officer Crams, the harness bull said briskly.A pause.Hello?He listened, said hello several times more, waited, then turned to Rick.Theres nobody on the line.And nobody on the screen.He pointed to the vidphone screen and Rick saw nothing on it.Taking the receiver from the harness bull Rick said, Mr.Bryant?He listened, waited; nothing.Ill dial again.He hung up, waited, then redialed the familiar number.The phone rang, but no one answered it; the phone rang on and on.Let me try, Officer Crams said, taking the receiver away from Rick.You must have misdialed He dialed.The number is 842  I know the number, Rick said.Officer Crams calling in, the harness bull said into the Phone receiver.Is there an Inspector Bryant connected with the department?A short pause.Well, what about a bounty hunter named Rick Deckard?Again a pause.Youre sure?Could he have recentlyoh, I see; okay, thanks.No, I have it under control.Officer Crams rang off, turned toward Rick.I had him on the line, Rick said.I talked to him; he said hed talk to you.It must be phone trouble; the connection must have been broken somewhere along the way.Didnt you seeBryants face showed on the screen and then it didnt.He felt bewildered.Officer Crams said, I have Miss Lufts statement, Deckard.So lets go down to the Hall of Justice so I can book you.Okay, Rick said.To Luba Luft he said, Ill be back in a short while.Im still not finished testing you.Hes a deviant, Luba Luft said to Officer Crams.He gives me the creeps.She shivered.What opera are you practicing to give?Officer Crams asked her.The Magic Flute, Rick said.I didnt ask you; I asked her.The harness buff gave him a glance of dislike.Im anxious to get to the Hall of Justice, Rick said.This matter should be straightened out.He started toward the door of the dressing room, his briefcase gripped.Ill search you first.Officer Crams deftly frisked him, and came up with Ricks service pistol and laser tube.He appropriated both, after a moment of sniffing the muzzle of the pistol.This has been fired recently, he said.I retired an andy just now, Rick said.The remains are still in my car, up on the roof.Okay, Officer Crams said.Well go up and have a look.As the two of them started from the dressing room, Miss Luft followed as far as the door.He wont come back again, will he, Officer?Im really afraid of him; hes so strange.If hes got the body of someone he killed upstairs in his car, Crams said, he wont be coming back.He nudged Rick forward and, together, the two of them ascended by elevator to the roof of the opera house.Opening the door of Ricks car, Officer Crams silently inspected the body of Polokov.An android, Rick said.I was sent after him.He almost got me by pretending to be  Theyll take your statement at the Hall of Justice, Officer Crams interrupted.He nudged Rick over to his parked, plainly marked police car; there, by police radio, he put in a call for someone to come pick up Polokov.Okay, Deckard, he said, then, ringing off.Lets get started.With the two of them aboard, the patrol car zummed up from the roof and headed south.Something, Rick noticed, was not as it should be.Officer Crams had steered the car in the wrong direction.The Hall of justice, Rick said, is north, on Lombard.Thats the old Hall of Justice, Officer Crams said.The new one is on Mission.That old building, its disintegrating; its a ruin.Nobodys used that for years.Has it been that long since you last got booked?Take me there, Rick said.To Lombard Street.He understood it all, now; saw what the androids, working together, had achieved.He would not live beyond this ride; for him it was the end, as it had almost been for Daveand probably eventually would be.That girls quite a looker, Officer Crams said.Of course, with that costume you cant tell about her figure.But Id say its damn okay.Rick said, Admit to me that youre an android.Why?Im not an android.What do you do, roam around killing people and telling yourself theyre androids?I can see why Miss Luft was scared.Its a good thing for her that she called us.Then take me to the Hall of Justice, on Lombard.Like I said  Itll take about three minutes, Rick said.I want to see it.Every morning I check in for work, there; I want to see that its been abandoned for years, as you say.Maybe youre an android, Officer Crams said.With a false memory, like they give them.Had you thought of that?He grinned frigidly as he continued to drive south.Conscious of his defeat and failure, Rick settled back.And, helplessly, waited for what came next.Whatever the androids had planned, now that they had physical possession of him.But I did get one of them, he told himself; I got Polokov.And Dave got two.Hovering over Mission, Officer Cramss police car prepared to descend for its landing.10  The Mission Street Hall of Justice building, onto the roof of which the hovercar descended, jutted up in a series of baroque, ornamented spires; complicated and modem, the handsome structure struck Rick Deckard as attractiveexcept for one aspect.He had never seen it before.The police hovercar landed.And, a few minutes later, he found himself being booked.304, Officer Crams said to the sergeant at the high desk.And 612.4 and lets see.Representing himself to be a peace officer.406.7 the desk sergeant said, filling out the forms; he wrote leisurely, in a slightly bored manner.Routine business, his posture and expression declared.Nothing of importance.Over here, Officer Crams said to Rick, leading him to a small white table at which a technician operated familiar equipment.For your cephalic pattern, Crams said.Identpurposes.Rick said brusquely, I know.In the old days, when he had been a harness bull himself, he had brought many suspects to a table like this.Like this, but not this particular table.His cephatic pattern taken, he found himself being led off to an equally familiar room; reflexively he began assembling his valuables for transfer.It makes no sense, he said to himself.Who are these people?If this place has always existed, why didnt we know about it?And why dont they know about us?Two parallel police agencies, he said to himself; ours and this one.But never coming in contactas far as I know until now.Or maybe they have, he thought.Maybe this isnt the first time.Hard to believe, he thought, that this wouldnt have happened long ago.If this really is a police apparatus, here; if its what it asserts itself to be,  A man, not in uniform, detached himself from the spot at which he had been standing; he approached Rick Deckard at a measured, unruffled pace, gazing at him curiously.Whats this one?he asked Officer Crams.Suspected homicide, Crams answered.We have a bodywe found it in his carbut he claims its an android.Were checking it out, giving it a bone marrow analysis at the lab.And posing as a police officer, a bounty hunter.To gain access to a womans dressing room in order to ask her suggestive questions.She doubted he was what he said he was and called us in.Stepping back, Crams said, Do you want to finish up with him, sir?All right.The senior police official, not in uniform, blue eyed, with a narrow, flaring nose and inexpressive lips, eyed Rick, then reached for Ricks briefcase.What do you have in here, Mr.Deckard?Rick said, Material pertaining to the Voigt KampfF personality test.I was testing a suspect when Officer Crams arrested me.He watched as the police official rummaged through the contents of the briefcase, examining each item.The questions I asked Miss Luft are standard V K questions, printed on the  Do you know George Gleason and Phil Resch?the police official asked.No, Rick said; neither name meant anything to him.Theyre the bounty hunters for Northern California.Both are attached to our department.Maybe youll run into them while youre here.Are you an android, Mr.Deckard?The reason I ask is that several times in the past weve had escaped andys turn up posing as out of state bounty hunters here in pursuit of a suspect.Rick said, Im not an android.You can administer the Voigt Kampff test to me; Ive taken it before and I dont mind taking it again.But I know what the results will be.Can I phone my wife?Youre allowed one call.Would you rather phone her than a lawyer?Ill phone my wife, Rick said.She can get a lawyer for me.The plainclothes police officer handed him a fifty cent piece and pointed.Theres the vidphone over there.He watched as Rick crossed the room to the phone.Then he returned to his examination of the contents of Ricks briefcase.Inserting the coin, Rick dialed his home phone number.And stood for what seemed like an eternity, waiting.A womans face appeared on the vidscreen.Hello, she said.It was not Iran.He had never seen the woman before in his life.He hung up, walked slowly back to the police officer.No luck?the officer asked.Well, you can make another call; we have a liberal policy in that regard.I cant offer you the opportunity of calling a bondsman because your offense is unbailable, at present.When youre arraigned, however  I know, Rick said acridly.Im familiar with police procedure.Heres your briefcase, the officer said; he handed it back to Rick.Come into my office Id like to talk with you further.He started down a side hall, leading the way; Rick followed.Then, pausing and turning, the officer said, My name is Garland.He held out his hand and they shook.Briefly.Sit down, Garland said as he opened his office door and pushed behind a large uncluttered desk.Rick seated himself facing the desk.This Voigt Kampff test, Garland said, that you mentioned.He indicated Ricks briefcase.All that material you carry.he filled and lit a pipe, puffed for a moment.Its an analytical tool for detecting andys?Its our basic test, Rick said.The only one we currently employ.The only one capable of distinguishing the new Nexus 6 brain unit.You havent heard of this test?Ive heard of several profile analysis scales for use with androids.But not that one.He continued to study Rick intently, his face turgid; Rick could not fathom what Garland was thinking.Those smudged carbon flimsies, Garland continued, that you have there in your briefcase.Polokov, Miss Luft  your assignments.The next one is me.Rick stared at him, then grabbed for the briefcase.In a moment the carbons lay spread out before him.Garland had told the truth; Rick examined the sheet.Neither manor rather neither he nor Garlandspoke for a time and then Garland cleared his throat, coughed nervously.Its an unpleasant sensation, he said.To find yourself a bounty hunters assignment all of a sudden.Or whatever it is you are, Deckard.He pressed a key on his desk intercom and said, Send one of the bounty hunters in here; I dont care which one.Okay; thank you.He released the key.Phil Resch will be in here a minute or so from now, he said to Rick.I want to see his list before I proceed.You think I might be on his list?Rick said.Its possible.Well know pretty soon.Best to be sure about these critical matters.Best not to leave it to chance.This info sheet about me.He indicated the smudged carbon.It doesnt list me as a police inspector; it inaccurately gives my occupation as insurance underwriter.Otherwise its correct, as to physical description, age, personal habits, home address.Yes, its me, all right.Look for yourself.He pushed the page to Rick, who picked it up and glanced over it.The office door opened and a tall fleshless man with hard etched features, wearing horn rim glasses and a fuzzy Vandyke beard, appeared.Garland rose, indicating Rick.Phil Resch, Rick Deckard.Youre both bounty hunters and its probably time you met.As he shook hands with Rick, Phil Resch said, Which city are you attached to?Garland answered for Rick.San Francisco.Here; take a look at his schedule.This one comes up next.He handed Phil Resch the sheet which Rick had been examining, that with his own description.Say, Gar, Phil Resch said.This is you.Theres more, Garland said.Hes also got Luba Luft the opera singer there on his list of retirement assignments, and Polokov.Remember Polokov?Hes now dead; this bounty hunter or android or whatever he is got him, and we running a bone marrow test at the lab.To see if theres any conceivable basis  Polokov Ive talked to, Phil Resch said.That big Santa Claus from the Soviet police?He pondered, plucking at his disarrayed beard.I think its a good idea to run a bone marrow test on him.Why do you say that?Garland asked, clearly annoyed.Its to remove any legal basis on which this man Deckard could claim he hadnt killed anyone; he only retired an android.Phil Resch said, Polokov struck me as cold.Extremely cerebral and calculating; detached.A lot of the Soviet police are that way, Garland said, visibly nettled.Luba Luft I never met, Phil Resch said.Although Ive heard records shes made.To Rick he said, Did you test her out?I started to, Rick said.But I couldnt get an accurate reading.And she called in a harness bull, which ended it.And Polokov?Phil Resch asked.I never got a chance to test him either.Phil Resch said, mostly to himself, And I assume you havent had an opportunity to test out Inspector Garland, here.Of course not, Garland interjected, his face wrinkled with indignation; his words broke off, bitter and sharp.What test do you use?Phil Resch asked.The Voigt Kampff scale.Dont know that particular one.Both Resch and Garland seemed deep in rapid, professional thought but not in unison.Ive always said, he continued, that the best place for an android would be with a big police organization such as W. P. O.  Ever since I first met Polokov Ive wanted to test him, but no pretext ever arose.It never would have, either  which is one of the values such a spot would have for an enterprising android.Getting slowly to his feet Inspector Garland faced Phil Resch and said, Have you wanted to test me, too?A discreet smiled traveled across Phil Reschs face; he started to answer, then shrugged.And remained silent.He did not seem afraid of his superior, despite Garlands palpable wrath.I dont think you understand the situation, Garland said.This manor androidRick Deckard comes to us from a phantom, hallucinatory, nonexistent police agency allegedly operating out of the old departmental headquarters on Lombard.Hes never heard of us and weve never heard of himyet ostensibly were both working the same side of the street.He employs a test weve never heard of.The list he carries around isnt of androids; its a list of human beings.Hes already killed onceat least once.And if Miss Luft hadnt gotten to a phone he probably would have killed her and then eventually he would have come sniffing around after me.Hmm, Phil Resch said.Hmm, Garland mimicked, wrathfully.He looked, now, as if he bordered on apoplexy.Is that all you have to say?The intercom came on and a female voice said, Inspector Garland, the lab report on Mr.Polokovs corpse is ready.I think we should hear it, Phil Resch said.Garland glanced at him, seething.Then he bent, pressed the key of the intercom.Lets have it, Miss French.The bone marrow test, Miss French said, shows that Mr.Polokov was a humanoid robot.Do you want a detailed  No, thats enough.Garland settled back in his seat, grimly contemplating the far wall; he said nothing to either Rick or Phil Resch.Resch said, What is the basis of your Voigt Kampff test, Mr.Deckard?Empathic response.In a variety of social situations.Mostly having to do with animals.Ours is probably simpler, Resch said.The reflex arc response taking place in the upper ganglia of the spinal column requires several microseconds more in the humanoid robot than in a human nervous system.Reaching across Inspector Garlands desk he plucked a pad of paper toward him; with a ball point pen he drew a sketch.We use an audio signal or a light flash.The subject presses a button and the elapsed time is measured.We try it a number of times, of course.Elapsed time varies in both the andy and the human.But by the time ten reactions have been measured, we believe we have a reliable clue.And, as in your case with Polokov, the bone marrow test backs us up.An interval of silence passed and then Rick said, You can test me out.Im ready.Of course Id like to test you, too.If youre willing.Naturally, Resch said.He was, however, studying Inspector Garland.Ive said for years, Resch murmured, that the Boneli Reflex Arc Test should be applied routinely to police personnel the higher up the chain of command the better.Havent I, Inspector?Thats right you have, Garland said.And Ive always opposed it.On the grounds that it would lower department morale.I think now, Rick said, youre going to have to sit still for it.In view of your labs report on Polokov.11  Garland said, I guess so.He jabbed a finger at the bounty hunter Phil Resch.But Im warning you: youre not going to like the results of the tests.Do you know what theyll be?Resch asked, with visible surprise; he did not look pleased.I know almost to a hair, Inspector Garland said.Okay.Resch nodded.Ill go upstairs and get the Boneli gear.He strode to the door of the office, opened it, and disappeared out into the hall.Ill be back in three or four minutes, he said to Rick.The door shut after him.Reaching into the right hand top drawer of his desk, Inspector Garland fumbled about, then brought forth a laser tube; he swiveled it until it pointed at Rick.Thats not going to make any difference, Rick said.Resch will have a postmortem run on me, the same as your lab ran on Polokov.And hell still insist on awhat did you call itBoneli Reflex Arc Test on you and on himself.The laser tube remained in its position, and then Inspector Garland said, It was a bad day all day.Especially when I saw Officer Crams bringing you in; I had an intuitionthats why I intervened.By degrees he lowered the laser beam; he sat gripping it and then he shrugged and returned it to the desk drawer, locking the drawer and restoring the key to his pocket.What will tests on the three of us show?Rick asked.Garland said, That damn fool Resch.He actually doesnt know?He doesnt know; he doesnt suspect; he doesnt have the slightest idea.Otherwise he couldnt live out a life as a bounty hunter, a human occupationhardly an android occupation.Garland gestured toward Ricks briefcase.Those other carbons, the other suspects youre supposed to test and retire.I know them all.He paused, then said, We all came here together on the same ship from Mars.Not Resch; he stayed behind another week, receiving the synthetic memory system.He was silent, then.Or rather it was silent.Rick said, Whatll he do when he finds out?I dont have the foggiest idea, Garland said remotely.It ought, from an abstract, intellectual viewpoint, to be interesting.He may kill me, kill himself; maybe you, too.He may kill everyone he can, human and android alike.I understand that such things happen, when theres been a synthetic memory system laid down.When one thinks its human.So when you do that, youre taking a chance.Garland said, Its a chance anyway, breaking free and coming here to Earth, where were not even considered animals.Where every worm and wood louse is considered more desirable than all of us put together.Irritably, Garland picked at his lower lip.Your position would be better r if Phil Resch could pass the Boneli test, if it was just me.The results, that way, would be predictable; to Resch Id just be another andy to retire as soon as possible.So youre not in a good position either, Deckard.Almost as bad, in fact, as I am.You know where I guessed wrong?I didnt know about Polokov.He must have come here earlier; obviously he came here earlier.In another group entirelyno contact with ours.He was already entrenched in the W. P. O.  when I arrived.I took a chance on the lab report, which I shouldnt have.Crams, of course, took the same chance.Polokov was almost my finish, too, Rick said.Yes, there was something about him.I dont think he could have been the same brain unit type as we; he must have been souped up or tinkered withan altered structure, unfamiliar even to us.A good one, too.Almost good enough.When I phoned my apartment, Rick said, why didnt I get my wife?All our vidphone lines here are trapped.They recirculate the call to other offices within the building.This is a homeostatic enterprise were operating here, Deckard.Were a closed loop, cut off from the rest of San Francisco.We know about them but they dont know about us.Sometimes an isolated person such as yourself wanders in here or, as in your case, is brought herefor our protection.He gestured convulsively toward the office door.Here comes eager beaver Phil Resch back with his handy dandy portable little test.Isnt he clever?Hes going to destroy his own life and mine and possibly yours.You androids, Rick said, dont exactly cover for each other in times of stress.Garland snapped, I think youre right; it would seem we lack a specific talent you humans possess.I believe its called empathy.The office door opened; Phil Resch stood outlined, carrying a device which trailed wires.Here we are, he said, closing the door after him; he seated himself, plugging the device into the electrical outlet.Bringing out his right hand, Garland pointed at Resch.At once Reschand also Rick Deckardrolled from their chairs and onto the floor; at the same time, Resch .aimed a laser tube and, as he fell, fired at Garland.The laser beam, aimed with skill, based on years of training, bifurcated Inspector Garlands head.He slumped forward and, from his hand, his miniaturized laser beam rolled across the surface of his desk.The corpse teetered on its chair and then, like a sack of eggs, it slid to one side and crashed to the floor.It forgot, Resch said, rising to his feet, that this is my job.I can almost foretell what an android is going to, do.I suppose you can, too.He put his laser beam away, bent, and, with curiosity, examined the body of his quondam superior.What did it say to you while I was gone?That heitwas an android.And you Rick broke off, the conduits of his brain humming, calculating, and selecting; he altered what he had started to say.would detect it, he finished.In a few more minutes.Anything else?This building is android infested.Resch said introspectively, Thats going to make it hard for you and me to get out of here.Nominally I have the authority to leave any time I want, of course.And to take a prisoner with me.He listened; no sound came from beyond the office.I guess they didnt hear anything.Theres evidently no bug installed here, monitoring everything as there should be.Gingerly, he nudged the body of the android with the toe of his shoe.It certainly is remarkable, the psionic ability you develop in this business; I knew before I opened the office door that he would take a shot at me.Frankly Im surprised he didnt kill you while I was upstairs,  He almost did, Rick said.He had a big utility model laser beam on me part of the time.He was considering it.But it was you he was worried about, not me.The android flees, Resch said humorlessly, where the bounty bunter pursues.You realize, dont you, that youre going to have to double back to the opera house and get Luba Luft before anyone here has a chance to warn her as to how this came out.Warn it, I should say.Do you think of them as it?I did at one time, Rick said.When my conscience occasionally bothered me about the work I had to do; I protected myself by thinking of them that way but now I no longer find it necessary.All right, Ill head directly back to the opera house.Assuming you can get me out of here.Suppose we sit Garland up at his desk, Resch said; he dragged the corpse of the android back up into its chair, arranging its arms and legs so that its posture appeared reasonably naturalif no one looked closely.If no one came into the office.Pressing a key on the desk intercom, Phil Resch said, Inspector Garland has asked that no calls be put through to him for the next half hour.Hes involved in work that cant be interrupted.Yes, Mr.Resch.Releasing the intercom key, Phil Resch said to Rick, Im going to handcuff you to me during the time were still here in the building.Once were airborne Ill naturally let you go.He produced a pair of cuffs, slapped one onto Ricks wrist and the other around his own.Come on; lets get it over with.He squared his shoulders, took a deep breath, and pushed open the office door.Uniformed police stood or sat on every side, conducting their routine business of the day; none of them glanced up or paid any attention as Phil Resch led Rick across the lobby to the elevator.What Im afraid of, Resch said as they waited for the elevator, is that the Garland one had a dead mans throttle warning component built into it.But He shrugged.I would have expected it to go off by now; otherwise its not much good.The elevator arrived; several police like nondescript men and women disemelevatored, cracked off across the lobby on their several errands.They paid no attention to Rick or Phil Resch.Do you think your department will take me on?Resch asked, as the elevator doors shut, closing the two of them inside; he punched the roof button and the elevator silently rose.After all, as of now Im out of a job.To say the least.Guardedly, Rick said, Idont see why not.Except that we already have two bounty hunters.Ive got to tell him, he said to himself.Its unethical and cruel not to.Mr.Resch, youre an android, he thought to himself.You got me out of this place and heres your reward; youre everything we jointly abominate.The essence of what were committed to destroy.I cant get over it, Phil Resch said.It doesnt seem possible.For three years Ive been working under the direction of androids.Why didnt I suspectI mean, enough to do something?Maybe it isnt that long.Maybe they only recently infiltrated this building.Theyve been here all the time.Garland has been my superior from the start, throughout my three years.According to it, Rick said, the bunch of them came to Earth together.And that wasnt as long ago as three years; its only been a matter of months.Then at one time an authentic Garland existed, Phil Resch said.And somewhere along the way got replaced.His sharklike lean face twisted and he struggled to understand.OrIve been impregnated with a false memory system.Maybe I only remember Garland over the whole time.But His face, suffused now with growing torment, continued to twist and work spasmodically.Only androids show up with false memory systems; its been found ineffective in humans.The elevator ceased rising; its doors slid back, and there, spread out ahead of them, deserted except for empty parked vehicles, lay the police stations roof field.Heres my car, Phil Resch said, unlocking the door of a nearby hovercar and waving Rick rapidly inside; he himself got in behind the wheel and started up the motor.In a moment they had lifted into the sky and, turning north, headed back in the direction of the War Memorial Opera House.Preoccupied, Phil Resch drove by reflex; his progressively more gloomy train of thought continued to dominate his attention.Listen, Deckard, he said suddenly.After we retire Luba LuftI want you to His voice, husky and tormented, broke off.You know.Give me the Boneli test or that empathy scale you have.To see about me.We can worry about that later, Rick said evasively You dont want me to take it, do you?Phil Resch glanced at him with acute comprehension.I guess you know what the results will be; Garland must have told you something.Facts which I dont know.Rick said, Its going to be hard even for the two of us to take out Luba Luft; shes more than I could handle, anyhow.Lets keep our attention focused on that.Its not just false memory structures, Phil Resch said.I own an animal; not a false one but the real thing.A squirrel.I love the squirrel, Deckard; every goddamn morning I feed it and change its papersyou know, clean up its cageand then in the evening when I get off work I let it loose in my apt and it runs all over the place.It has a wheel in its cage; ever seen a squirrel running inside a wheel?It runs and runs, the wheel spins, but the squirrel stays in the same spot.Buffy seems to like it, though.I guess squirrels arent too bright, Rick said.They flew on, then, in silence.12  At the opera house Rick Deckard and Phil Resch were informed that the rehearsal had ended.And Miss Luft had left.Did she say where she intended to go?Phil Resch asked the stagehand, showing his police identification.Over to the museum.The stagehand studied the ID card.She said she wanted to take in the exhibit of Edvard Munch thats there, now.It ends tomorrow.And Luba Luft, Rick thought to himself, ends today.As the two of them walked down the sidewalk to the museum, Phil Resch said, What odds will you give?Shes flown; we wont find her at the museum.Maybe, Rick said.They arrived at the museum building, noted on which floor the Munch exhibit could be found, and ascended.Shortly, they wandered amid paintings and woodcuts.Many people had turned out for the exhibit, including a grammar school class; the shrill voice of the teacher penetrated all the rooms comprising the exhibit, and Rick thought, Thats what youd expect an andy to soundand looklike.Instead of like Rachael Rosen and Luba Luft.Andthe man beside him.Or rather the thing beside him.Did you ever hear of an andy having a pet of any sort?Phil Resch asked him.For sonic obscure reason he felt the need to be brutally honest; perhaps he had already begun preparing himself for what lay ahead.In two cases that I know of, andys owned and cared for animals.But its rare.From what Ive been able to learn, it generally fails; the andy is unable to keep the animal alive.Animals require an environment of warmth to flourish.Except for reptiles and insects.Would a squirrel need that?
