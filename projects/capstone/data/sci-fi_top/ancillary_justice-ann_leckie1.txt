 The body lay naked and facedown, a deathly gray, spatters of blood staining the snow around it.It was minus fifteen degrees Celsius and a storm had passed just hours before.The snow stretched smooth in the wan sunrise, only a few tracks leading into a nearby ice block building.A tavern.Or what passed for a tavern in this town.There was something itchingly familiar about that outthrown arm, the line from shoulder down to hip.But it was hardly possible I knew this person.I didnt know anyone here.This was the icy back end of a cold and isolated planet, as far from Radchaai ideas of civilization as it was possible to be.I was only here, on this planet, in this town, because I had urgent business of my own.Bodies in the street were none of my concern.Sometimes I dont know why I do the things I do.Even after all this time its still a new thing for me not to know, not to have orders to follow from one moment to the next.So I cant explain to you why I stopped and with one foot lifted the naked shoulder so I could see the persons face.Frozen, bruised, and bloody as she was, I knew her.Her name was Seivarden Vendaai, and a long time ago she had been one of my officers, a young lieutenant, eventually promoted to her own command, another ship.I had thought her a thousand years dead, but she was, undeniably, here.I crouched down and felt for a pulse, for the faintest stir of breath.Still alive.Seivarden Vendaai was no concern of mine anymore, wasnt my responsibility.And she had never been one of my favorite officers.I had obeyed her orders, of course, and she had never abused any ancillaries, never harmed any of my segments (as the occasional officer did).I had no reason to think badly of her.On the contrary, her manners were those of an educated, well bred person of good family.Not toward me, of courseI wasnt a person, I was a piece of equipment, a part of the ship.But I had never particularly cared for her.I rose and went into the tavern.The place was dark, the white of the ice walls long since covered over with grime or worse.The air smelled of alcohol and vomit.A barkeep stood behind a high bench.She was a nativeshort and fat, pale and wide eyed.Three patrons sprawled in seats at a dirty table.Despite the cold they wore only trousers and quilted shirtsit was spring in this hemisphere of Nilt and they were enjoying the warm spell.They pretended not to see me, though they had certainly noticed me in the street and knew what motivated my entrance.Likely one or more of them had been involved; Seivarden hadnt been out there long, or shed have been dead.Ill rent a sledge, I said, and buy a hypothermia kit.Behind me one of the patrons chuckled and said, voice mocking, Arent you a tough little girl.I turned to look at her, to study her face.She was taller than most Nilters, but fat and pale as any of them.She out bulked me, but I was taller, and I was also considerably stronger than I looked.She didnt realize what she was playing with.She was probably male, to judge from the angular mazelike patterns quilting her shirt.I wasnt entirely certain.It wouldnt have mattered, if I had been in Radch space.Radchaai dont care much about gender, and the language they speakmy own first languagedoesnt mark gender in any way.This language we were speaking now did, and I could make trouble for myself if I used the wrong forms.It didnt help that cues meant to distinguish gender changed from place to place, sometimes radically, and rarely made much sense to me.I decided to say nothing.After a couple of seconds she suddenly found something interesting in the tabletop.I could have killed her, right there, without much effort.I found the idea attractive.But right now Seivarden was my first priority.I turned back to the barkeep.Slouching negligently she said, as though there had been no interruption, What kind of place you think this is?The kind of place, I said, still safely in linguistic territory that needed no gender marking, that will rent me a sledge and sell me a hypothermia kit.How much?Two hundred shen.At least twice the going rate, I was sure.For the sledge.Out back.Youll have to get it yourself.Another hundred for the kit.Complete, I said.Not used.She pulled one out from under the bench, and the seal looked undamaged.Your buddy out there had a tab.Maybe a lie.Maybe not.Either way the number would be pure fiction.How much?Three hundred fifty.I could find a way to keep avoiding referring to the barkeeps gender.Or I could guess.It was, at worst, a fifty fifty chance.Youre very trusting, I said, guessing male, to let such an indigentI knew Seivarden was male, that one was easyrun up such a debt.The barkeep said nothing.Six hundred and fifty covers all of it?Yeah, said the barkeep.Pretty much.No, all of it.We will agree now.And if anyone comes after me later demanding more, or tries to rob me, they die.Silence.Then the sound behind me of someone spitting.Radchaai scum.Im not Radchaai.Which was true.You have to be human to be Radchaai.He is, said the barkeep, with the smallest shrug toward the door.You dont have the accent but you stink like Radchaai.Thats the swill you serve your customers.Hoots from the patrons behind me.I reached into a pocket, pulled out a handful of chits, and tossed them on the bench.Keep the change.I turned to leave.Your money better be good.Your sledge had better be out back where you said.And I left.The hypothermia kit first.I rolled Seivarden over.Then I tore the seal on the kit, snapped an internal off the card, and pushed it into her bloody, half frozen mouth.Once the indicator on the card showed green I unfolded the thin wrap, made sure of the charge, wound it around her, and switched it on.Then I went around back for the sledge.No one was waiting for me, which was fortunate.I didnt want to leave bodies behind just yet, I hadnt come here to cause trouble.I towed the sledge around front, loaded Seivarden onto it, and considered taking my outer coat off and laying it on her, but in the end I decided it wouldnt be that much of an improvement over the hypothermia wrap alone.I powered up the sledge and was off.I rented a room at the edge of town, one of a dozen two meter cubes of grimy, gray green prefab plastic.No bedding, and blankets cost extra, as did heat.I paidI had already wasted a ridiculous amount of money bringing Seivarden out of the snow.I cleaned the blood off her as best I could, checked her pulse (still there) and temperature (rising).Once I would have known her core temperature without even thinking, her heart rate, blood oxygen, hormone levels.I would have seen any and every injury merely by wishing it.Now I was blind.Clearly shed been beatenher face was swollen, her torso bruised.The hypothermia kit came with a very basic corrective, but only one, and only suitable for first aid.Seivarden might have internal injuries or severe head trauma, and I was only capable of fixing cuts or sprains.With any luck, the cold and the bruises were all I had to deal with.But I didnt have much medical knowledge, not anymore.Any diagnosis I could make would be of the most basic sort.I pushed another internal down her throat.Another checkher skin was no more chill than one would expect, considering, and she didnt seem clammy.Her color, given the bruises, was returning to a more normal brown.I brought in a container of snow to melt, set it in a corner where I hoped she wouldnt kick it over if she woke, and then went out, locking the door behind me.The sun had risen higher in the sky, but the light was hardly any stronger.By now more tracks marred the even snow of last nights storm, and one or two Nilters were about.I hauled the sledge back to the tavern, parked it behind.No one accosted me, no sounds came from the dark doorway.I headed for the center of town.People were abroad, doing business.Fat, pale children in trousers and quilted shirts kicked snow at each other, and then stopped and stared with large surprised looking eyes when they saw me.The adults pretended I didnt exist, but their eyes turned toward me as they passed.I went into a shop, going from what passed for daylight here to dimness, into a chill just barely five degrees warmer than outside.A dozen people stood around talking, but instant silence descended as soon as I entered.I realized that I had no expression on my face, and set my facial muscles to something pleasant and noncommittal.What do you want?growled the shopkeeper.Surely these others are before me.Hoping as I spoke that it was a mixed gender group, as my sentence indicated.I received only silence in response.I would like four loaves of bread and a slab of fat.Also two hypothermia kits and two general purpose correctives, if such a thing is available.Ive got tens, twenties, and thirties.Thirties, please.She stacked my purchases on the counter.Three hundred seventy five.There was a cough from someone behind meI was being overcharged again.I paid and left.The children were still huddled, laughing, in the street.The adults still passed me as though I werent there.I made one more stopSeivarden would need clothes.Then I returned to the room.Seivarden was still unconscious, and there were still no signs of shock as far as I could see.The snow in the container had mostly melted, and I put half of one brick hard loaf of bread in it to soak.A head injury and internal organ damage were the most dangerous possibilities.I broke open the two correctives Id just bought and lifted the blanket to lay one across Seivardens abdomen, watched it puddle and stretch and then harden into a clear shell.The other I held to the side of her face that seemed the most bruised.When that one had hardened, I took off my outer coat and lay down and slept.Slightly more than seven and a half hours later, Seivarden stirred and I woke.Are you awake?I asked.The corrective Id applied held one eye closed, and one half of her mouth, but the bruising and the swelling all over her face was much reduced.I considered for a moment what would be the right facial expression, and made it.I found you in the snow, in front of a tavern.You looked like you needed help.She gave a faint rasp of breath but didnt turn her head toward me.Are you hungry?No answer, just a vacant stare.Did you hit your head?No, she said, quiet, her face relaxed and slack.Are you hungry?No.When did you eat last?I dont know.Her voice was calm, without inflection.I pulled her upright and propped her against the gray green wall, gingerly, not wanting to cause more injury, wary of her slumping over.She stayed sitting, so I slowly spooned some bread and water mush into her mouth, working cautiously around the corrective.Swallow, I said, and she did.I gave her half of what was in the bowl that way and then I ate the rest myself, and brought in another pan of snow.She watched me put another half loaf of hard bread in the pan, but said nothing, her face still placid.Whats your name?I asked.No answer.Shed taken kef, I guessed.Most people will tell you that kef suppresses emotion, which it does, but thats not all it does.There was a time when I could have explained exactly what kef does, and how, but Im not what I once was.As far as I knew, people took kef so they could stop feeling something.Or because they believed that, emotions out of the way, supreme rationality would result, utter logic, true enlightenment.But it doesnt work that way.Pulling Seivarden out of the snow had cost me time and money that I could ill afford, and for what?Left to her own devices she would find herself another hit or three of kef, and she would find her way into another place like that grimy tavern and get herself well and truly killed.If that was what she wanted I had no right to prevent her.But if she had wanted to die, why hadnt she done the thing cleanly, registered her intention and gone to the medic as anyone would?I didnt understand.There was a good deal I didnt understand, and nineteen years pretending to be human hadnt taught me as much as Id thought.2   Nineteen years, three months, and one week before I found Seivarden in the snow, I was a troop carrier orbiting the planet Shisurna.Troop carriers are the most massive of Radchaai ships, sixteen decks stacked one on top of the other.Command, Administrative, Medical, Hydroponics, Engineering, Central Access, and a deck for each decade, living and working space for my officers, whose every breath, every twitch of every muscle, was known to me.Troop carriers rarely move.I sat, as I had sat for most of my two thousand year existence in one system or another, feeling the bitter chill of vacuum outside my hull, the planet Shisurna like a blue and white glass counter, its orbiting station coming and going around, a steady stream of ships arriving, docking, undocking, departing toward one or the other of the buoy and beacon surrounded gates.From my vantage the boundaries of Shisurnas various nations and territories werent visible, though on its night side the planets cities glowed bright here and there, and webs of roads between them, where theyd been restored since the annexation.I felt and heardthough didnt always seethe presence of my companion shipsthe smaller, faster Swords and Mercies, and most numerous at that time, the Justices, troop carriers like me.The oldest of us was nearly three thousand years old.We had known each other for a long time, and by now we had little to say to each other that had not already been said many times.We were, by and large, companionably silent, not counting routine communications.As I still had ancillaries, I could be in more than one place at a time.I was also on detached duty in the city of Ors, on the planet Shisurna, under the command of Esk Decade Lieutenant Awn.Ors sat half on waterlogged land, half in marshy lake, the lakeward side built on slabs atop foundations sunk deep in the marsh mud.Green slime grew in the canals and joints between slabs, along the lower edges of building columns, on anything stationary the water reached, which varied with the season.The constant stink of hydrogen sulfide only cleared occasionally, when summer storms made the lakeward half of the city tremble and shudder and walkways were knee deep in water blown in from beyond the barrier islands.Occasionally.Usually the storms made the smell worse.They turned the air temporarily cooler, but the relief generally lasted no more than a few days.Otherwise, it was always humid and hot.I couldnt see Ors from orbit.It was more village than city, though it had once sat at the mouth of a river, and been the capital of a country that stretched along the coastline.Trade had come up and down the river, and flat bottomed boats had plied the coastal marsh, bringing people from one town to the next.The river had shifted away over the centuries, and now Ors was half ruins.What had once been miles of rectangular islands within a grid of channels was now a much smaller place, surrounded by and interspersed with broken, half sunken slabs, sometimes with roofs and pillars, that emerged from the muddy green water in the dry season.It had once been home to millions.Only 6,318 people had lived here when Radchaai forces annexed Shisurna five years earlier, and of course the annexation had reduced that number.In Ors less than in some other places: as soon as we had appearedmyself in the form of my Esk cohorts along with their decade lieutenants lined up in the streets of the town, armed and armoredthe head priest of Ikkt had approached the most senior officer presentLieutenant Awn, as I saidand offered immediate surrender.The head priest had told her followers what they needed to do to survive the annexation, and for the most part those followers did indeed survive.This wasnt as common as one might thinkwe always made it clear from the beginning that even breathing trouble during an annexation could mean death, and from the instant an annexation began we made demonstrations of just what that meant widely available, but there was always someone who couldnt resist trying us.Still, the head priests influence was impressive.The citys small size was to some degree deceptiveduring pilgrimage season hundreds of thousands of visitors streamed through the plaza in front of the temple, camped on the slabs of abandoned streets.For worshippers of Ikkt this was the second holiest place on the planet, and the head priest a divine presence.Usually a civilian police force was in place by the time an annexation was officially complete, something that often took fifty years or more.This annexation was differentcitizenship had been granted to the surviving Shisurnans much earlier than normal.No one in system administration quite trusted the idea of local civilians working security just yet, and military presence was still quite heavy.So when the annexation of Shisurna was officially complete, most of Justice of Toren Esk went back to the ship, but Lieutenant Awn stayed, and I stayed with her as the twenty ancillary unit Justice of Toren One Esk.The head priest lived in a house near the temple, one of the few intact buildings from the days when Ors had been a cityfour storied, with a single sloped roof and open on all sides, though dividers could be raised whenever an occupant wished privacy, and shutters could be rolled down on the outsides during storms.The head priest received Lieutenant Awn in a partition some five meters square, light peering in over the tops of the dark walls.You dont, said the priest, an old person with gray hair and a close cut gray beard, find serving in Ors a hardship?Both she and Lieutenant Awn had settled onto cushionsdamp, like everything in Ors, and fungal smelling.The priest wore a length of yellow cloth twisted around her waist, her shoulders inked with shapes, some curling, some angular, that changed depending on the liturgical significance of the day.In deference to Radchaai propriety, she wore gloves.Of course not, said Lieutenant Awn, pleasantlythough, I thought, not entirely truthfully.She had dark brown eyes and close clipped dark hair.Her skin was dark enough that she wouldnt be considered pale, but not so dark as to be fashionableshe could have changed it, hair and eyes as well, but she never had.Instead of her uniformlong brown coat with its scattering of jeweled pins, shirt and trousers, boots and glovesshe wore the same sort of skirt the head priest did, and a thin shirt and the lightest of gloves.Still, she was sweating.I stood at the entrance, silent and straight, as a junior priest laid cups and bowls in between Lieutenant Awn and the Divine.I also stood some forty meters away, in the temple itselfan atypically enclosed space 43.5 meters high, 65.7 meters long, and 29.9 meters wide.At one end were doors nearly as tall as the roof was high, and at the other, towering over the people on the floor below, a representation of a mountainside cliff somewhere else on Shisurna, worked in painstaking detail.At the foot of this sat a dais, wide steps leading down to a floor of gray and green stone.Light streamed in through dozens of green skylights, onto walls painted with scenes from the lives of the saints of the cult of Ikkt.It was unlike any other building in Ors.The architecture, like the cult of Ikkt itself, had been imported from elsewhere on Shisurna.During pilgrimage season this space would be jammed tight with worshippers.There were other holy sites, but if an Orsian said pilgrimage she meant the annual pilgrimage to this place.But that was some weeks away.For now the air of the temple susurrated faintly in one corner with the whispered prayers of a dozen devotees.The head priest laughed.You are a diplomat, Lieutenant Awn.I am a soldier, Divine, answered Lieutenant Awn.They were speaking Radchaai, and she spoke slowly and precisely, careful of her accent.I dont find my duty a hardship.The head priest did not smile in response.In the brief silence that followed, the junior priest set down a lipped bowl of what Shisurnans call tea, a thick liquid, lukewarm and sweet, that bears almost no relationship to the actual thing.Outside the doors of the temple I also stood in the cyanophyte stained plaza, watching people as they passed.Most wore the same simple, bright colored skirting the head priest did, though only very small children and the very devout had much in the way of markings, and only a few wore gloves.Some of those passing were transplants, Radchaai assigned to jobs or given property here in Ors after the annexation.Most of them had adopted the simple skirt and added a light, loose shirt, as Lieutenant Awn had.Some stuck stubbornly to trousers and jacket, and sweated their way across the plaza.All wore the jewelry that few Radchaai would ever give upgifts from friends or lovers, memorials to the dead, marks of family or clientage associations.To the north, past a rectangular stretch of water called the Fore Temple after the neighborhood it had once been, Ors rose slightly where the city sat on actual ground during the dry season, an area still called, politely, the upper city.I patrolled there as well.When I walked the edge of the water I could see myself standing in the plaza.Boats poled slowly across the marshy lake, and up and down channels between groupings of slabs.The water was scummy with swaths of algae, here and there bristling with the tips of water grasses.Away from the town, east and west, buoys marked prohibited stretches of water, and within their confines the iridescent wings of marshflies shimmered over the water weeds floating thick and tangled there.Around them larger boats floated, and the big dredgers, now silent and still, that before the annexation had hauled up the stinking mud that lay beneath the water.The view to the south was similar, except for the barest hint on the horizon of the actual sea, past the soggy spit that bounded the swamp.I saw all of this, standing as I did at various points surrounding the temple, and walking the streets of the town itself.It was twenty seven degrees C, and humid as always.That accounted for almost half of my twenty bodies.The remainder slept or worked in the house Lieutenant Awn occupiedthree storied and spacious, it had once housed a large extended family and a boat rental.One side opened on a broad, muddy green canal, and the opposite onto the largest of local streets.Three of the segments in the house were awake, performing administrative duties (I sat on a mat on a low platform in the center of the first floor of the house and listened to an Orsian complain to me about the allocation of fishing rights) and keeping watch.You should bring this to the district magistrate, citizen, I told the Orsian, in the local dialect.Because I knew everyone here, I knew she was female, and a grandparent, both of which had to be acknowledged if I were to speak to her not only grammatically but also courteously.I dont know the district magistrate!she protested, indignant.The magistrate was in a large, populous city well upriver from Ors and nearby Kould Ves.Far enough upriver that the air was often cool and dry, and things didnt smell of mildew all the time.What does the district magistrate know about Ors?For all I know the district magistrate doesnt exist!She continued, explaining to me the long history of her houses association with the buoy enclosed area, which was off limits and certainly closed to fishing for the next three years.And as always, in the back of my mind, a constant awareness of being in orbit overhead.Come now, Lieutenant, said the head priest.No one likes Ors except those of us unfortunate enough to be born here.Most Shisurnans I know, let alone Radchaai, would rather be in a city, with dry land and actual seasons besides rainy and not rainy.Lieutenant Awn, still sweating, accepted a cup of so called tea, and drank without grimacinga matter of practice and determination.My superiors are asking for my return.On the relatively dry northern edge of the town, two brown uniformed soldiers passing in an open runabout saw me, raised hands in greeting.I raised my own, briefly.One Esk!one of them called.They were common soldiers, from Justice of Entes Seven Issa unit, under Lieutenant Skaaiat.They patrolled the stretch of land between Ors and the far southwestern edge of Kould Ves, the city that had grown up around the rivers newer mouth.The Justice of Ente Seven Issas were human, and knew I was not.They always treated me with slightly guarded friendliness.I would prefer you stay, said the head priest, to Lieutenant Awn.Though Lieutenant Awn had already known that.Wed have been back on Justice of Toren two years before, but for the Divines continued request that we stay.You understand, said Lieutenant Awn, they would much prefer to replace One Esk with a human unit.Ancillaries can stay in suspension indefinitely.Humans She set down her tea, took a flat, yellow brown cake.Humans have families they want to see again, they have lives.They cant stay frozen for centuries, the way ancillaries sometimes do.It doesnt make sense to have ancillaries out of the holds doing work when there are human soldiers who could do it.Though Lieutenant Awn had been here five years, and routinely met with the head priest, it was the first time the topic had been broached so plainly.She frowned, and changes in her respiration and hormone levels told me shed thought of something dismaying.You havent had problems with Justice of Ente Seven Issa, have you?No, said the head priest.She looked at Lieutenant Awn with a wry twist to her mouth.I know you.I know One Esk.Whoever theyll send meI wont know.Neither will my parishioners.Annexations are messy, said Lieutenant Awn.The head priest winced slightly at the word annexation and I thought I saw Lieutenant Awn notice, but she continued.Seven Issa wasnt here for that.The Justice of Ente Issa battalions didnt do anything during that time that One Esk didnt also do.No, Lieutenant.The priest put down her own cup, seeming disturbed, but I didnt have access to any of her internal data and so could not be certain.Justice of Ente Issa did many things One Esk did not.Its true, One Esk killed as many people as the soldiers of Justice of Entes Issa.Likely more.She looked at me, still standing silent by the enclosures entrance.No offense, but I think it was more.I take no offense, Divine, I replied.The head priest frequently spoke to me as though I were a person.And you are correct.Divine, said Lieutenant Awn, worry clear in her voice.If the soldiers of Justice of Ente Seven Issaor anyone elsehave been abusing citizens  No, no!protested the head priest, her voice bitter.Radchaai are so very careful about how citizens are treated!Lieutenant Awns face heated, her distress and anger plain to me.I couldnt read her mind, but I could read every twitch of her every muscle, so her emotions were as transparent to me as glass.Forgive me, said the head priest, though Lieutenant Awns expression had not changed, and her skin was too dark to show the flush of her anger.Since the Radchaai have bestowed citizenship on us She stopped, seemed to reconsider her words.Since their arrival, Seven Issa has given me nothing to complain of.But Ive seen what your human troops did during what you call the annexation.The citizenship you granted may be as easily taken back, and  We wouldnt protested Lieutenant Awn.The head priest stopped her with a raised hand.I know what Seven Issa, or at least those like them, do to people they find on the wrong side of a dividing line.Five years ago it was noncitizen.In the future, who knows?Perhaps not citizen enough?She waved a hand, a gesture of surrender.It wont matter.Such boundaries are too easy to create.I cant blame you for thinking in such terms, said Lieutenant Awn.It was a difficult time.And I cant help but think you inexplicably, unexpectedly naive, said the head priest.One Esk will shoot me if you order it.Without hesitation.But One Esk would never beat me or humiliate me, or rape me, for no purpose but to show its power over me, or to satisfy some sick amusement.She looked at me.Would you?No, Divine, I said.The soldiers of Justice of Ente Issa did all of those things.Not to me, its true, and not to many in Ors itself.But they did them nonetheless.Would Seven Issa have been any different, if it had been them here instead?Lieutenant Awn sat, distressed, looking down at her unappetizing tea, unable to answer.Its strange.You hear stories about ancillaries, and it seems like the most awful thing, the most viscerally appalling thing the Radchaai have done.Garseddwell, yes, Garsedd, but that was a thousand years ago.Thisto invade and take, what, half the adult population?And turn them into walking corpses, slaved to your ships AIs.Turned against their own people.If youd asked me before you annexed us, Id have said it was a fate worse than death.She turned to me.Is it?None of my bodies is dead, Divine, I said.And your estimate of the typical percentage of annexed populations who were made into ancillaries is excessive.You used to horrify me, said the head priest to me.The very thought of you near was terrifying, your dead faces, those expressionless voices.But today I am more horrified at the thought of a unit of living human beings who serve voluntarily.Because I dont think I could trust them.Divine, said Lieutenant Awn, mouth tight.I serve voluntarily.I make no excuses for it.I believe you are a good person, Lieutenant Awn, despite that.She picked up her cup of tea and sipped it, as though she had not just said what she had said.Lieutenant Awns throat tightened, and her lips.She had thought of something she wanted to say, but was unsure if she should.Youve heard about Ime, she said, deciding.Still tense and wary despite having chosen to speak.The head priest seemed bleakly, bitterly amused.News from Ime is meant to inspire confidence in Radch administration?This is what had happened: Ime Station, and the smaller stations and moons in the system, were the farthest one could be from a provincial palace and still be in Radch space.For years the governor of Ime used this distance to her own advantageembezzling, collecting bribes and protection fees, selling assignments.Thousands of citizens had been unjustly executed or (what was essentially the same thing) forced into service as ancillary bodies, even though the manufacture of ancillaries was no longer legal.The governor controlled all communications and travel permits, and normally a station AI would report such activity to the authorities, but Ime Station had been somehow prevented from doing so, and the corruption grew, and spread unchecked.Until a ship entered the system, came out of gate space only a few hundred kilometers from the patrol ship Mercy of Sarrse.The strange ship didnt answer demands that it identify itself.When Mercy of Sarrses crew attacked and boarded it, they found dozens of humans, as well as the alien Rrrrrr.The captain of Mercy of Sarrse ordered her soldiers to take captive any humans that seemed suitable for use as ancillaries, and kill the rest, along with all the aliens.The ship would be turned over to the system governor.Mercy of Sarrse was not the only human crewed warship in that system.Until that moment human soldiers stationed there had been kept in line by a program of bribes, flattery, and, when those failed, threats and even executions.All very effective, until the moment the soldier Mercy of Sarrse One Amaat One decided she wasnt willing to kill those people, or the Rrrrrr.And convinced the rest of her unit to follow her.That had all happened five years before.The results of it were still playing themselves out.Lieutenant Awn shifted on her cushion.That business was all uncovered because a single human soldier refused an order.And led a mutiny.If it hadnt been for her well.Ancillaries wont do that.They cant.That business was all uncovered, replied the head priest, because the ship that human soldier boarded, she and the rest of her unit, had aliens on it.Radchaai have few qualms about killing humans, especially noncitizen humans, but youre very cautious about starting wars with aliens.Only because wars with aliens might run up against the terms of the treaty with the alien Presger.Violating that agreement would have extremely serious consequences.And even so, plenty of high ranking Radchaai disagreed on that topic.I saw Lieutenant Awns desire to argue the point.Instead she said, The governor of Ime was not cautious about it.And would have started that war, if not for this one person.Have they executed that person yet?the head priest asked, pointedly.It was the summary fate of any soldier who refused an order, let alone mutinied.Last I heard, said Lieutenant Awn, breath tight and turning shallow, the Rrrrrr had agreed to turn her over to Radch authorities.She swallowed.I dont know whats going to happen.Of course, it had probably already happened, whatever it was.News could take a year or more to reach Shisurna from as far away as Ime.The head priest didnt answer for a moment.She poured more tea, and spooned fish paste into a small bowl.Does my continued request for your presence present any sort of disadvantage for you?No, said Lieutenant Awn.Actually, the other Esk lieutenants are a bit envious.Theres no chance for action on Justice of Toren.She picked up her own cup, outwardly calm, inwardly angry.Disturbed.Talking about the news from Ime had increased her unease.Action means commendations, and possibly promotions.And this was the last annexation.The last chance for an officer to enrich her house through connections to new citizens, or even through outright appropriation.Yet another reason I would prefer you, said the head priest.I followed Lieutenant Awn home.And watched inside the temple, and overlooked the people crisscrossing the plaza as they always did, avoiding the children playing kau in the center of the plaza, kicking the ball back and forth, shouting and laughing.On the edge of the Fore Temple water, a teenager from the upper city sat sullen and listless watching half a dozen little children hopping from stone to stone, singing:  One, two, my aunt told me  Three, four, the corpse soldier  Five, six, itll shoot you in the eye  Seven, eight, kill you dead  Nine, ten, break it apart and put it back together.As I walked the streets people greeted me, and I greeted them in return.Lieutenant Awn was tense and angry, and only nodded absently at the people in the street, who greeted her as she passed.The person with the fishing rights complaint left, unsatisfied.Two children rounded the divider after she had gone, and sat cross legged on the cushion she had vacated.They both wore lengths of fabric wrapped around their waists, clean but faded, though no gloves.The elder was about nine, and the symbols inked on the younger ones chest and shouldersslightly smudgedindicated she was no more than six.She looked at me, frowning.In Orsian addressing children properly was easier than addressing adults.One used a simple, ungendered form.Hello, citizens, I said, in the local dialect.I recognized them boththey lived on the south edge of Ors and I had spoken to them quite frequently, but they had never visited the house before.How can I help you?You arent One Esk, said the smaller child, and the older made an abortive motion as if to hush her.I am, I said, and pointed to the insignia on my uniform jacket.See?Only this is my number Fourteen segment.I told you, said the older child.The younger considered this for a moment, and then said, I have a song.I waited in silence, and she took a deep breath, as though about to begin, and then halted, perplexed seeming.Do you want to hear it?she asked, still doubtful of my identity, likely.Yes, citizen, I said.Ithat is, IOne Eskfirst sang to amuse one of my lieutenants, when Justice of Toren had hardly been commissioned a hundred years.She enjoyed music, and had brought an instrument with her as part of her luggage allowance.She could never interest the other officers in her hobby and so she taught me the parts to the songs she played.I filed those away and went looking for more, to please her.By the time she was captain of her own ship I had collected a large library of vocal musicno one was going to give me an instrument, but I could sing anytimeand it was a matter of rumor and some indulgent smiles that Justice of Toren had an interest in singing.Which it didntIIJustice of Torentolerated the habit because it was harmless, and because it was quite possible that one of my captains would appreciate it.Otherwise it would have been prevented.If these children had stopped me on the street, they would have had no hesitation, but here in the house, seated as though for a formal conference, things were different.And I suspected this was an exploratory visit, that the youngest child meant to eventually ask for a chance to serve in the houses makeshift templethe prestige of being appointed flower bearer to Amaat wasnt a question here, in the stronghold of Ikkt, but the customary term end gift of fruit and clothing was.And this childs best friend was currently a flower bearer, doubtless making the prospect more interesting.No Orsian would make such a request immediately or directly, so likely the child had chosen this oblique approach, turning a casual encounter into something formal and intimidating.I reached into my jacket pocket and pulled out a handful of sweets and laid them on the floor between us.The littler girl made an affirmative gesture, as though I had resolved all her doubts, and then took a breath and began.My heart is a fish  Hiding in the water grass  In the green, in the green.The tune was an odd amalgam of a Radchaai song that played occasionally on broadcast and an Orsian one I already knew.The words were unfamiliar to me.She sang four verses in a clear, slightly wavering voice, and seemed ready to launch into a fifth, but stopped abruptly when Lieutenant Awns steps sounded outside the divider.The smaller girl leaned forward and scooped up her payment.Both children bowed, still half seated, and then rose and ran out the entranceway into the wider house, past Lieutenant Awn, past me following Lieutenant Awn.Thank you, citizens, Lieutenant Awn said to their retreating backs, and they started, and then managed with a single movement to both bow slightly in her direction and continue running, out into the street.Anything new?asked Lieutenant Awn, though she didnt pay much attention to music, herself, not beyond what most people do.Sort of, I said.Farther down the street I saw the two children, still running as they turned a corner around another house.They slowed to a halt, breathing hard.The littler girl opened her hand to show the older one her fistful of sweets.Surprisingly, she seemed not to have dropped any, small as her hand was, as quick as their flight had been.The older child took a sweet and put it in her mouth.Five years ago I would have offered something more nutritious, before repairs had begun to the planets infrastructure, when supplies were chancy.Now every citizen was guaranteed enough to eat, but the rations were not luxurious, and often as not were unappealing.Inside the temple all was green lit silence.The head priest did not emerge from behind the screens in the temple residence, though junior priests came and went.Lieutenant Awn went to the second floor of her house and sat brooding on an Ors style cushion, screened from the street, shirt thrown off.She refused the (genuine) tea I brought her.I transmitted a steady stream of information to hereverything normal, everything routineand to Justice of Toren.She should take that to the district magistrate, Lieutenant Awn said of the citizen with the fishing dispute, slightly annoyed, eyes closed, the afternoons reports in her vision.We dont have jurisdiction over that.I didnt answer.No answer was required, or expected.She approved, with a quick twitch of her fingers, the message I had composed for the district magistrate, and then opened the most recent message from her young sister.Lieutenant Awn sent a percentage of her earnings home to her parents, who used it to buy their younger child poetry lessons.Poetry was a valuable, civilized accomplishment.I couldnt judge if Lieutenant Awns sister had any particular talent, but then not many did, even among more elevated families.But her work and her letters pleased Lieutenant Awn, and took the edge off her present distress.The children on the plaza ran away home, laughing.The adolescent sighed, heavily, the way adolescents do, and dropped a pebble in the water and stared at the ripples.Ancillary units that only ever woke for annexations often wore nothing but a force shield generated by an implant in each body, rank on rank of featureless soldiers that might have been poured from mercury.But I was always out of the holds, and I wore the same uniform human soldiers did, now the fighting was done.My bodies sweated under my uniform jackets, and, bored, I opened three of my mouths, all in close proximity to each other on the temple plaza, and sang with those three voices, My heart is a fish, hiding in the water grass One person walking by looked at me, startled, but everyone else ignored methey were used to me by now.3   The next morning the correctives had fallen off, and the bruising on Seivardens face had faded.She seemed comfortable, but she still seemed high, so that was hardly surprising.I unrolled the bundle of clothes I had bought for herinsulated underclothes, quilted shirt and trousers, undercoat and hooded overcoat, glovesand laid them out.Then I took her chin and turned her head toward me.Can you hear me?Yes.Her dark brown eyes stared somewhere distant over my left shoulder.Get up.I tugged on her arm, and she blinked, lazily, and got as far as sitting up before the impulse deserted her.But I managed to dress her, in fits and starts, and then I stowed what few things were still out, shouldered my pack, took Seivarden by the arm, and left.There was a flier rental at the edge of town, and predictably the proprietor wouldnt rent to me unless I put down twice the advertised deposit.I told her I intended to fly northwest, to visit a herding campan outright lie, which she likely knew.Youre an offworlder, she said.You dont know what its like away from the towns.Offworlders are always flying out to herding camps and getting lost.Sometimes we find them again, sometimes not.I said nothing.Youll lose my flier and then where will I be?Out in the snow with my starving children, thats where.Beside me Seivarden stared vaguely off into the distance.I was forced to put down the money.I had a strong suspicion I would never see it again.Then the proprietor demanded extra because I couldnt display a local pilot certificationsomething I knew wasnt required.If it had been, I would have forged one before I came.In the end, though, she gave me the flier.I checked its engine, which seemed clean and in good repair, and made sure of the fuel.When I was satisfied, I put my pack in, seated Seivarden, and then climbed into the pilots seat.Two days after the storm, the snowmoss was beginning to show again, sweeps of pale green with darker threads here and there.After two more hours we flew over a line of hills, and the green darkened dramatically, lined and irregularly veined in a dozen shades, like malachite.In some places the moss was smeared and trampled by the creatures that grazed on it, herds of long haired bov making their way southward as spring advanced.And along those paths, on the edges here and there, ice devils lay in carefully tunneled lairs, waiting for a bov to put a foot wrong so they could drag it down.I saw no trace of them, but even the herders who lived their lives following the bov couldnt always tell when one was near.It was easy flying.Seivarden sat, half lying and quiet beside me.How could she be alive?And how had she ended up here, now?It was beyond improbable.But improbable things happened.Nearly a thousand years before Lieutenant Awn was even born, Seivarden had captained a ship of her own, Sword of Nathtas, and had lost it.Most of the human crew, including Seivarden, had managed to get to an escape pod, but hers had never been found, that I had heard.Yet here she was.Someone must have found her relatively recently.She was lucky to be alive.I was four billion miles away when Seivarden lost her ship.I was patrolling a city of glass and polished red stone, silent but for the sound of my own feet, and the conversation of my lieutenants, and, occasionally, me trying my voices against the echoing pentagonal plazas.Falls of flowers, red and yellow and blue, draped the walls surrounding houses with five sided courtyards.The flowers were wilting; no one dared walk the streets except me and my officers, everyone knew the likely fate of any person placed under arrest.Instead they huddled in their houses, waiting for what would come next, wincing or shuddering at the sound of a lieutenant laughing, or my singing.What trouble wed run into, I and my lieutenants, had been sporadic.The Garseddai had put up only nominal resistance.Troop carriers had emptied, the Swords and Mercies were essentially on guard duty around the system.Representatives from the five zones of each of the five regions, twenty five in all, speaking for the various moons, planets, and stations in the Garseddai system, had surrendered in the name of their constituents, and were separately on their way to Sword of Amaat to meet Anaander Mianaai, Lord of the Radch, and beg for the lives of their people.Hence that frightened, silent city.In a narrow, diamond shaped park, by a black granite monument inscribed with the Five Right Actions, and the name of the Garseddai patron who had wished to impress them on the local residents, one of my lieutenants passed another and complained that this annexation had been disappointingly dull.Three seconds later I received a message from Captain Seivardens Sword of Nathtas.The three Garseddai electors she was carrying had killed two of her lieutenants, and twelve of Sword of Nathtass ancillary segments.They had damaged the shipcut conduits, breached the hull.Accompanying the report, a recording from Sword of Nathtasthe gun that an ancillary segment saw, irrefutably, but that according to Sword of Nathtass other sensors just didnt exist.A Garseddai elector, against all expectations surrounded by the gleaming silver of Radchaai style armor that only the ancillarys eyes could see, firing the gun, the bullet piercing the ancillarys armor, killing the segment, and, with its eyes gone, the gun and armor flickering back into nonexistence.All the electors had been searched before boarding, and Sword of Nathtas should have been able to detect any weapon or shield generating device or implant.And while Radchaai style armor had once been in common use in the regions surrounding the Radch itself, those regions had been absorbed a thousand years before.The Garseddai didnt use it, didnt know how to make it, let alone how to use it.And even if they had, that gun, and its bullet, were flatly impossible.Three people armed with such a gun, and armored, could do a great deal of damage on a ship like Sword of Nathtas.Especially if even one Garseddai could reach the engine, and if such a gun could pierce the engines heat shield.Radchaai warship engines burned star hot, and a failed heat shield meant instant vaporization, an entire ship dissolved in a brief, bright flash.But there was nothing I could do, nothing anyone could do.The message was nearly four hours old, a signal from the past, a ghost.The issue had been decided even before it had reached me.A harsh tone sounded, and a blue light blinked on the panel in front of me, beside the fuel indicator.An instant before the indicator had read nearly full.Now it read empty.The engine would shut down in a matter of minutes.Beside me Seivarden sprawled, relaxed and quiet.I landed.The fuel tank had been rigged in a way I hadnt detected.It seemed three quarters full, but it wasnt, and the alarm that ought to have sounded when Id used half of what Id started with had been disconnected.I thought of the double deposit I certainly wouldnt see again.Of the proprietor, so concerned that she might lose her valuable flier.Of course there would be a transmitter, whether or not I triggered the emergency call.The proprietor wouldnt want to lose the flier, just strand me alone in the middle of this plain of moss streaked snow.I could call for helpI had disabled my communication implants, but I did have a handheld I could use.But we were very, very far from anyone who might be moved to send assistance.And even if help came, and came before the proprietor who clearly meant me no good, I wouldnt get where I was going, a matter of great importance to me.The air was minus eighteen degrees; the breeze from the south, at approximately eight kph, implied snow sometime in the near future.Nothing serious, if the mornings weather report could be trusted.My landing had left a green edged smear of white in the snowmoss, easily visible from the air.The terrain seemed gently hilly, though the hills wed flown over were no longer visible.Had this been an ordinary emergency, the best course would have been to stay inside the flier until help came.But this was not an ordinary emergency, and I did not expect rescue.Either they would come as soon as their transmitter told them we were grounded, prepared to murder, or they would wait.The rental had several other vehicles, the proprietor would likely not be inconvenienced if she waited even several weeks to retrieve her flier.As she herself had said, no one would be surprised if a foreigner lost herself in the snow.I had two choices.I could wait here and hope to ambush anyone who came to murder and rob me, and take their transport.This would, of course, be futile in the event that they decided to wait for cold and hunger to do their job for them.Or I could pull Seivarden out of the flier, shoulder my pack, and walk.My intended destination was some sixty kilometers to the southeast.I could walk that in a day if I had to, ground and weatherand ice devilspermitting, but I would be lucky if Seivarden could do it in twice that time.And that course would be futile if the proprietor decided not to wait, but to retrieve her flier more or less immediately.Our trail through the moss striated snow would be clear, they would need only to follow us and dispose of us.I would have lost any advantage of surprise I might have gained by hiding near the downed flier.And I would be lucky if I found anything, once I reached my destination.I had spent the past nineteen years following the most tenuous of threads, weeks and months of searching or waiting, punctuated by moments like this, when success or even life hung on the toss of a coin.I had been lucky to come this far.I could not reasonably expect to go farther.A Radchaai would have tossed that coin.Or more accurately a handful of them, a dozen disks, each with its meaning and import, the pattern of their fall a map of the universe as Amaat willed it to be.Things happen the way they happen because the world is the way it is.Or, as a Radchaai would say, the universe is the shape of the gods.Amaat conceived of light, and conceiving of light also necessarily conceived of not light, and light and darkness sprang forth.This was the first Emanation, EtrepaBo; Light/Darkness.The other three, implied and necessitated by that first, are EskVar (Beginning/Ending), IssaInu (Movement/Stillness), and VahnItr (Existence/Nonexistence).These four Emanations variously split and recombined to create the universe.Everything that is, emanates from Amaat.The smallest, most seemingly insignificant event is part of an intricate whole and to understand why one particular mote of dust falls in one particular path, and lands in one particular location, is to understand the will of Amaat.There is no such thing as just a coincidence.Nothing happens by chance, but only according to the mind of God.Or so official Radchaai orthodoxy teaches.I myself have never understood religion very well.It was never required that I should.And though the Radchaai had made me, I was not Radchaai.I knew and cared nothing about the will of the gods.I only knew that I would land where I myself had been cast, wherever that would be.I took my pack from the flier, opened it, and removed an extra magazine, which I stowed inside my coat near my gun.I shouldered the pack, went around to the other side of the flier, and opened the hatch there.Seivarden, I said.She didnt move, only breathed a quiet hmmm.I took her arm and pulled, and she half slid, half stepped out into the snow.I had gotten this far by taking one step, and then another.I turned northeast, pulling Seivarden along, and walked.Dr.Arilesperas Strigan, whose home I very much hoped I was walking toward, had been, at one time, a medic in private practice on Dras Annia Station, an aggregation of at least five different stations, one built onto another, at the intersection of two dozen different routes, well outside Radch territory.Nearly anything could end up there, given enough time, and in the course of her work she had met a wide variety of people, with a wide variety of antecedents.She had been paid in currency, in favors, in antiques, in nearly anything that might imaginably be said to have value.Id been there, seen the station and its convoluted, interpenetrating layers, seen where Strigan had worked and lived, seen the things shed left behind when one day, for no reason anyone seemed to know, shed bought passage on five different ships and then disappeared.A case full of stringed instruments, only three of which I could name.Five shelves of icons, a dizzying array of gods and saints worked in wood, in shell, in gold.A dozen guns, each one carefully labeled with its station permit number.These were collections that had begun as single items, received in payment, sparking her curiosity.Strigans lease had been paid in full for 150 years, and as a result station authorities had left her apartment untouched.A bribe had gotten me in, to see the collection I had come fora few five sided tiles in colors still flower bright after a thousand years.A shallow bowl inscribed around its gilt edge in a language Strigan couldnt possibly have read.A flat plastic rectangle I knew was a voice recorder.At a touch it produced laughter, voices speaking that same dead language.Small as it was, this had not been an easy collection to assemble.Garseddai artifacts were scarce, because once Anaander Mianaai had realized the Garseddai possessed the means to destroy Radchaai ships and penetrate Radchaai armor, she had ordered the utter destruction of Garsedd and its people.Those pentagonal plazas, the flowers, every living thing on every planet, moon, and station in the system, all gone.No one would ever live there again.No one would ever be permitted to forget what it meant to defy the Radch.Had a patient given her, say, the bowl, and had that sent her looking for more information?And if one Garseddai object had fetched up there, what else might have?Something a patient might have given her as payment, maybe not knowing what it wasor knowing and wanting desperately to be rid of it.Something that had led Strigan to flee, to disappear, leaving nearly everything she owned behind, perhaps.Something dangerous, something she couldnt bring herself to destroy, to be rid of in the most efficient way possible.Something I wanted very badly.I wanted to get as far as we possibly could, as quickly as we possibly could, and so we walked for hours with only the briefest of stops when absolutely necessary.Though the day was clear, and bright as it ever gets on Nilt, I felt blind in a way that I had thought I had learned to ignore by now.I had once had twenty bodies, twenty pairs of eyes, and hundreds of others that I could access if I needed or desired it.Now I could only see in one direction, could only see the vast expanse behind me if I turned my head and blinded myself to what was in front of me.Usually I dealt with this by avoiding too open spaces, by making sure of just what was at my back, but here that was impossible.My face burned, despite the very gentle breeze, then numbed.My hands and feet ached at firstI hadnt bought my gloves or boots with the intention of walking sixty kilometers in the coldand then grew heavy and numb.I was fortunate I hadnt come in winter, when temperatures could be a great deal lower.Seivarden must have been just as cold, but she walked steadily as I pulled her along, step after apathetic step, feet dragging through the mossy snow, staring down, not complaining or even speaking at all.When the sun was nearly on the horizon she shifted her shoulders just slightly and raised her head.I know that song, she said.What?That song youre humming.Lazily she turned her head toward me, her face showing no anxiety or perplexity at all.I wondered if she had made any effort to conceal her accent.Likely noton kef, as she was, she wouldnt care.Inside Radch territories that accent declared her a member of a wealthy and influential house, someone who, after taking the aptitudes at fifteen, would have ended up with a prestigious assignment.Outside those territories, it was an easy shorthand for a villainrich, corrupt, and callousin a thousand entertainments.The faint sound of a flier reached us.I turned without stopping, searched the horizon, and saw it, small and distant.Flying low and slowly, following our trail, it seemed.It wasnt a rescue, I was sure.My toss had landed wrong, and now we were exposed and defenseless.We kept walking as the sound of the flier grew nearer.We couldnt have outraced it even if Seivarden hadnt begun to half stumble, catching herself, but clearly at the end of her endurance.If she was speaking unprompted, noticing anything around her, she was likely beginning to come down.I stopped, dropped her arm, and she came to a halt beside me.The flier sailed over us, banked, and landed in our path, approximately thirty meters in front of us.Either they didnt have the means to shoot us from the air, or they didnt wish to.I shrugged off my pack and loosened the fastenings of my outer coat, the better to reach my gun.Four people got out of the flierthe owner I had rented from, two people I didnt recognize, and the person from the bar, who had called me a tough little girl, and whom I had wanted to kill but had refrained from killing.I slid my hand into my coat and grasped the gun.My options were limited.Dont you have any common sense?called the proprietor, when they were fifteen meters away.All four stopped.You stay with the flier when it goes down, so we can find you.I looked at the person from the bar, saw her recognize me, and see that I recognized her.In the bar, I said that anyone who tried to rob me would die, I reminded her.She smirked.One of the people I didnt recognize produced a gun from somewhere on her person.We arent gonna just try, she said.I drew my gun and fired, hitting her in the face.She crumpled to the snow.Before the others could react, I shot the person from the bar, who likewise fell, and then the person beside her, all three in quick succession, taking less than one second.The proprietor swore, and turned to flee.I shot her in the back, and she took three steps and then fell.Im cold, said Seivarden beside me, placid and heedless.They had left the flier unguarded, all four approaching me.Foolish.The whole venture had been foolish, undertaken without any sort of serious planning, it seemed.I had only to load Seivarden and my pack into their flier and be off.The residence of Arilesperas Strigan was barely visible from the air, only a circle slightly more than thirty five meters in diameter, within which the snowmoss was perceptibly lighter and thinner.I brought the flier down outside the circle and waited a moment to assess the situation.From this angle it was obvious there were buildings, two of them, snow covered mounds.It might have been an unoccupied herding camp, but if I could trust my information, it was not.There was no sign of a wall or fence, but I would make no assumptions about her security.After consideration, I opened the hatch on the flier and got out, pulling Seivarden out behind me.We walked slowly to the line where the snow changed, Seivarden stopping when I stopped.She stood incuriously, staring straight ahead.Beyond this I had not been able to plan.Strigan!I called, and waited, but no answer came.I left Seivarden standing where she was and walked the circumference of the circle.The entrances of the two snow mounded buildings seemed oddly shadowed, and I stopped, and looked again.Both hung open, dark beyond.Buildings like these would probably have double doored entranceslike an airlock, to keep warm air insidebut I didnt think anyone would leave either door hanging ajar.Either Strigan had security in place, or she did not.I stepped over the line, into the circle.Nothing happened.The doors were open, both inner and outer, and there were no lights.One of the buildings was just as cold inside as out.I presumed that when I found a light I would discover it was used for storage, filled with tools and sealed packages of food and fuel.The other was two degrees Celsius insideI guessed that it had been heated until relatively recently.Living quarters, evidently.Strigan!I called into the darkness, but the way my voice echoed back told me the building was likely unoccupied.Outside again, I found the marks where her flier had sat.She was gone, then, and the open doors and the darkness were a message for whoever would come.For me.I had no means to discover where shed gone.I looked up at the empty sky, and down again at the imprint of the flier.I stood there a while, looking at that empty space.When I returned to Seivarden, I found shed lain down in the green stained snow and gone to sleep.In the back of the flier I found a lantern, a stove, a tent, and some bedding.I took the lantern into the building I presumed was living quarters and switched it on.Wide, light colored rugs covered the floor, and woven hangings the walls; these were blue and orange and an eye hurting green.Low benches, backless, with cushions, lined the room.Beyond benches and the bright hangings, there was little else.A game board with counters, but the board had a pattern of holes I didnt recognize, and I didnt understand the distribution of the counters among the holes.I wondered whom Strigan played with.Perhaps the board was only decorative.It was finely carved, and the pieces brightly colored.A wooden box sat on a table in a corner, a long oval with a carved, pierced lid and three strings stretched tight across.The wood was pale gold, with a waving, curling grain.The holes cut in the flat top were as uneven and intricate as the grain of the wood.It was a beautiful thing.I plucked a string and it rang softly.Doors led to kitchen, bath, sleeping quarters, and what was obviously a small infirmary.I opened a cabinet door and found a neat stack of correctives.Each drawer I pulled out revealed instruments and medicines.She might have gone to a herding camp to tend to some emergency.But the lights and the heat being off, and those doors left open, argued otherwise.Barring a miracle, it was the end of nineteen years of planning and effort.The house controls were behind a panel in the kitchen.I found the power supply in place, hooked it back in, and switched on the heat and the lights.Then I went out and got Seivarden, and dragged her into the house.I made a pallet of blankets I found in Strigans bedroom, then stripped Seivarden and laid her on it, and covered her with more blankets.She didnt wake, and I used the time to search the house more thoroughly.The cabinets held plenty of food.A cup sat on a counter, a thin layer of greenish liquid glazing the bottom.Next to it sat a plain white bowl holding the last bits of a hunk of hard bread disintegrating into ice rimmed water.It looked as though Strigan had left without cleaning up after a meal, leaving nearly everything behindfood, medical supplies.I checked the bedroom, found warm clothes in good repair.She had left on short notice, not taking much.She knew what she had.Of course she didthat was why shed fled to begin with.If she was not stupidand I was quite certain she was notshe had gone the moment she realized what I was, and would keep going until she was as far from me as she could get.But where would that be?If I represented the power of the Radch, and had found her even here, so distant from both Radch space and her own home, where could she go that they would not ultimately find her?Surely she would realize that.But what other course would be open to her?Surely she would not be foolish enough to return.In the meantime, Seivarden would be sick soon, unless I found kef for her.I had no intention of doing that.And there was food here, and heat, and perhaps I could find something, some hint, some clue to what Strigan had been thinking, in the moment she had thought the Radch were coming for her, and fled.Something that would tell me where shed gone.4   At night, in Ors, I walked the streets, and looked out over the still, stinking water, dark beyond the few lights of Ors itself, and the blinking of the buoys surrounding the prohibited zones.I slept, also, and sat watch in the lower level of the house, in case anyone should need me, though that was rare in those days.I finished any of the days work still uncompleted, and watched over Lieutenant Awn, who lay sleeping.Mornings I brought water for Lieutenant Awn to bathe in, and dressed her, though the local costume was a good deal less effort than her uniform, and she had stopped wearing any sort of cosmetics two years before, as they were difficult to maintain in the heat.Then Lieutenant Awn would turn to her iconsfour armed Amaat, an Emanation in each hand, sat on a box downstairs, but the others (Toren, who received devotions from every officer on Justice of Toren, and a few gods particular to Lieutenant Awns family) sat near where Lieutenant Awn slept, in the upper part of the house, and it was to them that she made her morning devotions.The flower of justice is peace, the daily prayer began, that every Radchaai soldier said on waking, every day of her life in the military.The flower of propriety is beauty in thought and action.The rest of my officers, still on Justice of Toren, were on a different schedule.Their mornings rarely coincided with Lieutenant Awns, so it was almost always Lieutenant Awns voice alone in prayer, and the others, when they spoke so far away, in chorus, without her.The flower of benefit is Amaat whole and entire.I am the sword of justice The prayer is antiphonal, but only four verses long.I can sometimes hear it still when I wake, like a distant voice somewhere behind me.Every morning, in every official temple throughout Radchaai space, a priest (who doubles as a registrar of births and deaths and contracts of all kinds) casts the days omens.Households and individuals sometimes cast their own as well, and theres no obligation to attend the official castingbut its as good an excuse as any to be seen, and speak to friends and neighbors, and hear gossip.There was, as yet, no official temple in Orsthese are all primarily dedicated to Amaat, any other gods on the premises take lesser places, and the head priest of Ikkt had not seen her way clear to demoting her god in its own temple, or identifying Ikkt with Amaat closely enough to add Radchaai rites to her own.So for the moment Lieutenant Awns house served.Each morning the makeshift temples flower bearers removed dead flowers from around the icon of Amaat and replaced them with fresh onesusually a local species with small, bright pink, triple lobed petals that grew in the dirt that collected on the outside corners of buildings, or cracks in slabs, and was the nearest thing to a weed but greatly admired by the children.And lately small cupped blue and white lilies had been blooming in the lake, especially near the buoy barricaded prohibited areas.Then Lieutenant Awn would lay out the cloth for the omen casting and the omens themselves, a handful of weighty metal disks.These, and the icons, were Lieutenant Awns personal possessions, gifts from her parents when she had taken the aptitudes and received her assignment.Occasionally only Lieutenant Awn and the days attendants came to the morning ritual, but usually others were present.The towns medic, a few of the Radchaai who had been granted property here, other Orsian children who could not be persuaded to go to school, or care about being on time for it, and liked the glitter and ring of the disks as they fell.Sometimes even the head priest of Ikkt would comethat god, like Amaat, not demanding that its followers refuse to acknowledge other gods.Once the omens fell, and came to rest on the cloth (or, to any spectators dread, rolled off the cloth and away somewhere harder to interpret), the priest officiating was supposed to identify the pattern, match it with its associated passage of scripture, and recite that for those present.It wasnt something Lieutenant Awn was always able to do.So instead she tossed the omens, I observed their fall, and then I transmitted the appropriate words to her.Justice of Toren was, after all, nearly two thousand years old, and had seen nearly every possible configuration.The ritual done, she would have breakfastusually a round of bread from whatever local grain was available, and (real) teaand then take her place on the mat and platform and wait for the days requests and complaints.Jen Shinnan invites you to supper this evening, I told her, that next morning.I also ate breakfast, cleaned weapons, walked the streets, and greeted those who spoke to me.Jen Shinnan lived in the upper city, and before the annexation she had been the wealthiest person in Ors, in influence second only to the head priest of Ikkt.Lieutenant Awn disliked her.I suppose I dont have a good excuse to refuse.Not that I can see, I said.I also stood at the perimeter of the house, nearly on the street, and watched.An Orsian approached, saw me, slowed.Stopped about eight meters away, pretending to look above me, at something else.Anything else?asked Lieutenant Awn.The district magistrate reiterates the official policy regarding fishing reserves in the Ors Marshes  Lieutenant Awn sighed.Yes, of course she does.Can I help you, citizen?I asked the person still hesitating in the street.The impending arrival of her first grandchild hadnt yet been announced to the neighbors, so I pretended I didnt know either, and used only the simple respectful address toward a male person.I wish, Lieutenant Awn continued, the magistrate would come here herself and try living on stale bread and those disgusting pickled vegetables they send, and see how she likes being forbidden to fish where all the fish actually are.The Orsian in the street started, looked for a moment as if she were going to turn around and walk away, and changed her mind.Good morning, Radchaai, she said, quietly, coming closer.And to the lieutenant as well.Orsians were blunt when it suited them, and at other times oddly, frustratingly reticent.I know theres a reason for it, said Lieutenant Awn to me.And shes right, but still.She sighed again.Anything else?Denz Ay is outside and wishes to speak to you.As I spoke, I invited Denz Ay to step within the house.What about?Something she seems unwilling to mention.Lieutenant Awn gestured acknowledgment and I brought Denz Ay around the screens.She bowed, and sat on the mat in front of Lieutenant Awn.Good morning, citizen, said Lieutenant Awn.I translated.Good morning, Lieutenant.And by slow, careful degrees, beginning with an observation on the heat and the cloudless sky, progressing through inquiries about Lieutenant Awns health to mild local gossip, she finally came around to hinting at her reason for coming.I I have a friend, Lieutenant.She stopped.Yes?Yesterday evening my friend was fishing.Denz Ay stopped again.Lieutenant Awn waited three seconds, and when nothing further seemed forthcoming, she asked, Did your friend catch much?When the mood was on them, no amount of direct questioning, or begging an Orsian to come to the point, would avail.N not much, said Denz Ay.And then, irritation flashing across her face, just for an instant: The best fishing, you know, is near the breeding areas, and those are all prohibited.Yes, said Lieutenant Awn.Im sure your friend would never fish illegally.No, no, of course not, Denz Ay protested.But I dont want to get her in trouble but maybe sometimes she digs tubers.Near the prohibited zones.There werent really any plants that produced edible tubers near the prohibited zonestheyd all been dug up months ago, if not longer.Poachers were more careful about the ones insideif the plants decreased too noticeably, or disappeared entirely, wed be forced to find out who was taking them, and guard them much more closely.Lieutenant Awn knew this.Everyone in the lower city knew it.Lieutenant Awn waited for the rest of the story, not for the first time annoyed at the Orsian tendency to approach topics by stealth, but managing mostly not to show it.Ive heard theyre very good, she ventured.Oh, yes!agreed Denz Ay.Theyre best right out of the mud!Lieutenant Awn suppressed a grimace.But you can slice them and grill them too Denz Ay stopped, with a shrewd look.Perhaps my friend can get some for you.I saw Lieutenant Awns dissatisfaction with her rations, the momentary desire to say, Yes, please, but instead she said, Thank you, theres no need.You were saying?Saying?Your friend.As she spoke Lieutenant Awn was asking me questions, with minute twitches of her fingers.Was digging tubers near a prohibited zone.And?I showed Lieutenant Awn the spot this person was most likely to have been digging inI patrolled all of Ors, saw the boats go in and out, saw where they were at night when they doused lights and maybe even thought they were running invisible to me.And, said Denz Ay, they found something.Anyone missing?Lieutenant Awn asked me, silently, alarmed.I replied in the negative.What did they find?Lieutenant Awn asked Denz Ay, aloud.
