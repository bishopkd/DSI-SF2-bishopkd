From the corner of her eye, she catches a glimpse of palace Panthers, formed in ranks at the door.A crowd is gathering, watching with interest.In a few more hours rumors and news will be all over the city."The Environment Ministry, as quickly as you can. "She waves Akkarat's bribe money at the rickshaw man, encouraging greater effort, but even as she does, she wonders on whose behalf she waves it.33  At noon, an army truck arrives.It's a huge thing, gouting exhaust, astonishingly loud, like something out of the old Expansion.She can hear it coming from a block away, but even with so much warning, she almost cries out when she sees the thing.So fast.So awfully loud.Once in Japan, Emiko saw a similar vehicle.Gendo sama explained that it was powered by liquefied coal.Astonishingly dirty and terrible for carbon limits, but almost magically powerful.As if a dozen megodonts were chained within.Perfect for military applications, even if civilians could not justify either the power or the taxation.Exhaust clouds swirl blue around it as it comes to a halt.A small fleet of kink spring scooters sweep up behind, ridden by men wearing the black of the palace's Panthers and the green of the Army.Men begin to pour from the truck and charge for Anderson sama's tower entrance.Emiko crouches lower in her alley hiding place.At first she thought to flee, but before she had gone a block she realized there was no place left to run.Anderson sama was her only raft left in the raging ocean.And so she remains close by, watching the hive of ants that is Anderson sama's tower.Trying to understand.She's still astounded that the people who came crashing through the door were not in fact white shirts.They should have been.In Kyoto, the police would have already hunted her down with sniffer dogs, and she would have already been compassionately put down.She has never heard of a New Person so completely failing to show obedience.Certainly not anything like her own ugly bloodletting and flight.She burns with shame and hatred at the same time.She cannot stay, and yet it is more than apparent that the gaijin's apartment, invaded though it is, is her last place of safety.The city around her is no friend.More men pour from the military truck.Emiko slips deeper into the alley as they approach, expecting them to widen their search, preparing herself for a burst of heat and motion to escape.If she runs she can reach the khlong, and cool herself before fleeing again.But they only post themselves along the major thoroughfares and do not seem to care to search for her.Another flurry of motion.Panthers dragging out a pair of burlap hooded men with pale hands.Gaijin for certain.One of them is Anderson sama, she thinks.The clothes are his.They shove him forward, making him stumble.He slams into the back of the truck.Cursing, two of the Panthers drag him aboard.They cuff him beside the other gaijin.More troops swarm inside, surrounding them.A limousine sweeps up to the curb, purring with its own coal diesel engine.It's strange and silent in comparison to the roar of the troop carrier, but the exhaust is the same.A rich man's vehicle.Almost unimaginable that someone could be so wealthy   Emiko gasps.It's Trade Minister Akkarat, being hustled by bodyguards into the car.Onlookers pause and stare.Emiko gawks with them.Then the limousine is moving and the troop carrier as well, its massive engine roaring.The two vehicles tear down the street trailing clouds of smoke and disappear around the corner.Silence rushes into the void, almost physical after the rumble of the truck engine.She hears people murmuring, "Political Akkarat farang?General Pracha"  But even with her excellent hearing, it makes no sense.She stares after the truck.With determination, she might follow She gives up the idea.It is impossible.Wherever Anderson sama has gone, she cannot involve herself.Whatever political problem he has become entangled in will end with the ugliness of all such conflicts.Emiko wonders if she can simply slip back inside the apartment now that everyone is gone.Near the building's entrance, a pair of men have begun handing out fliers to everyone they can reach.Another pair coast past on a cargo bike, its bin stacked with more fliers.One man jumps down and sticks a flier to a lamp post before hopping back up on the slowly moving bike.Emiko starts toward the bike to collect a flier herself, but a prickle of paranoia stops her.Instead, she lets them rattle past, then cautiously approaches the light pole to read what they have posted.She moves carefully, all her energy focused on making her movement appear natural, trying not to draw undue attention.She pushes gently into a gathering crowd, bumping against them, craning for a view over the sea of black hair and straining bodies.An angry murmur rises.Someone sobs.A man turns away, his eyes wide with grief and terror.He shoves past her.Emiko slips forward into the gap.The murmur grows.Emiko eases closer, careful, careful, slow, slow Her breath catches.The Somdet Chaopraya.The Protector of Her Majesty the Queen.And words she forces her brain to work, to translate from Thai to Japanese and as she does, she becomes aware of the people all around her, the people who press in on every side, all of them reading about a windup girl who walks amongst them, a windup who slaughters the Queen's own protector, an agent of the Environment Ministry, a creature of deadly power.People jostle around her as they try to read, shoving closer, squeezing past, all of them thinking she is one of them.All of them allowing her to live only because they do not yet see.34  "Will you sit down?Your pacing makes me nervous. "Hock Seng pauses in the perambulation of his hovel to glare at Laughing Chan."I pay for your calories, not the other way around. "Laughing Chan shrugs and goes back to playing cards.They've all been huddled in the room for the last several days.Laughing Chan is a congenial companion along with Pak Eng and Peter Kuok.But even the most congenial company  Hock Seng shakes his head.It doesn't matter.The storm is coming.Bloodshed and mayhem on the horizon.It's the same feeling he had before the Incident, before his sons were beheaded and his daughters raped senseless.And he sat in the middle of that brewing storm, willfully ignorant, telling anyone who would listen that the men in K. L.  would never let what had happened down in Jakarta happen to the good Chinese here.After all, were they not loyal?Did they not contribute?Did he not have friends at every level of government who assured him that the Green Headbands were but a bit of political posturing?The storm was surging all around him, and he had refused to accept it but not this time.This time, he is prepared.The air is electric with what is about to occur.Ever since the white shirts closed down the factories it was apparent.And now it is about to break.And this time, he is ready.Hock Seng smiles to himself, examines his little bunker with its stores of money and gems and food."Is there any more word on the radio?"he asks.The three men exchange glances.Laughing Chan nods at Pak Eng."It's your turn to wind it. "Pak Eng scowls and goes over to the radio.It's an expensive device, and Hock Seng is regretting that he purchased it at all.There are other radios in the slums, but lurking beside them draws attention and so he spent money on this one, unsure if it would even carry anything other than rumor, and yet unable to deny himself another source of information.Pak Eng kneels beside the thing and starts to wind it.Its speaker crackles to life, barely loud enough over the whine of the crank."You know, if you fitted this with a decent gear system, it would be a lot more efficient. "Everyone ignores him, their attention entirely focused on the tiny speaker: Music, saw duang  Hock Seng crouches by the radio, listening intently.Changes the dial.Pak Eng is starting to sweat.He winds for another thirty seconds and stops, puffing."There.That should last a little while. "Hock Seng works the dial on the machine, listening to the divining winds of radio waves.Twirls across stations.Nothing but entertainments.Music.Laughing Chan looks up."What time is it?""Four, perhaps?"Hock Seng shrugs."There should be muay thai.They should be doing the opening rituals by now. "Everyone exchanges glances.Hock Seng moves through more stations.Music only.No news.Nothing And then a voice.Filling all the stations, speaking as one voice and one station.They all crouch round, listing."Akkarat, I think. "Hock Seng pauses."The Somdet Chaopraya has died.Akkarat is blaming the white shirts. "He looks at them all."It is beginning. "Pak Eng and Laughing Chan and Peter all look at Hock Seng with respect."You were right. "Hock Seng nods impatiently."I learn. "The storm is gathering.The megodonts must do battle.It is their fate.The power sharing of the last coup could never last.The beasts must clash and one will establish final dominance.Hock Seng murmurs a prayer to his ancestors that he will come out of this maelstrom alive.Laughing Chan stands."I guess we'll have to earn this bodyguard money after all. "Hock Seng nods seriously."It will not be pretty, not for anyone who is not prepared. "Pak Eng begins pumping his spring gun."It reminds me of Penang. ""Not this time," Hock Seng says."This time, we are ready. "He waves to them."Come.It's time we saw to whatever else we can "  A banging on the door makes them all straighten."Hock Seng!Hock Seng!"A hysterical voice, more pounding from outside."It's Lao Gu. "Hock Seng pulls open the door and Lao Gu stumbles in."They've taken Mr.Lake.The foreign devil and all his friends. "Hock Seng stares at the rickshaw man."The white shirts are moving against him?""No.The Trade Ministry.I saw Akkarat himself do the deed. "Hock Seng frowns."It makes no sense. "Lao Gu shoves a flier into his hands."It's the windup.The one that he kept bringing to his flat.She's the one that killed the Somdet Chaopraya. "Hock Seng reads quickly.Nods to himself."You're sure about this windup creature?Our foreign devil was working with an assassin?""I only know what it says on the whisper sheet, but that's the heechy keechy for sure, from the way it describes her.He brought her from Ploenchit many times.Let her sleep there, even. ""Is it a problem?"Laughing Chan asks."No. "Hock Seng shakes his head, allows himself a smile.He goes and digs a ring of keys out from under his mattress."An opportunity.A better one than I expected. "He turns to them all."We won't be hiding here after all. ""No?"Hock Seng grins."There's one last place we must go before we depart the city.One last thing to collect.Something from my old offices.Gather up the weapons. "To his credit, Laughing Chan does not question.Simply nods and holsters his pistols, slings a machete across his back.The rest do the same.Together, they file out through the door.Hock Seng closes it behind him.Hock Seng jogs down the alley after his people, the keys to the factory jingling in his hand.For the first time in a long time, fate moves in his favor.Now all he needs is a little luck and a little more time.Up ahead, people are shouting about white shirts and the death of their Queen's protector.Angry voices, ready for a riot.The storm is brewing.The battle pieces are being aligned.A little girl hurries past, pressing whisper sheets into each of their hands before dashing on.The political parties are already at work.Soon the godfather of the slum will have his own people down in the alleys inciting violence.Hock Seng and his men make their way out of the squeezeways and pour out into the street.Nothing is moving.Even the freelance rickshaw men have gone to ground.A group of shopkeepers huddle around a hand crank radio.Hock Seng waves at his men to wait, goes over to the listeners."What news?"A woman looks up."National Radio says the Protector"  "Yes, I know that.What else does it say?""Minister Akkarat has denounced General Pracha. "It's happening even faster than he expected.Hock Seng straightens and calls to Laughing Chan and the others."Come on.We're going to run out of time if we don't hurry. "As he calls to them, a huge truck comes around the corner, engine revving.It is astonishingly noisy.Exhaust trails behind it like an illegal dung fire.Dozens of hard faced troops stare out from the back as it roars by.Hock Seng and his men duck back into the alley, coughing.Laughing Chan peers out, following the truck's progress."Its running on coal diesel," he says wonderingly."It's the army. "Hock Seng wonders if it is December 12 loyalists, some component of the Northeastern generals coming to aid General Pracha and retake the National Radio Tower.Or perhaps they are Akkarat's allies, rushing to secure the sea locks or the docks or the anchor pads.Or perhaps they are simply opportunists, getting ready to take advantage of the coming chaos.Hock Seng watches as they disappear around a corner.Harbingers of the storm, regardless.The last pedestrians are disappearing into their homes.Shop keepers are barring their storefronts from within.The clank and rattle of locks fills the street.The city knows what is going to happen.Memories peck and swirl at Hock Seng.Alleys running thick with blood.The scent of green bamboo, smoking and burning.He reaches for the reassurance of his spring gun and machete.The city may be a jungle full of tigers, but this time he is not some little deer, running from Malaya.At last, he has learned.It is possible to prepare for chaos.He motions to his men."Come.This is our time. "35  "It was not Pracha!He's not involved in this!"Kanya shouts into the crank phone, but she might as well be raving through the bars of a jail cell for all the impact it makes.Narong hardly seems to be listening.The line crackles with jumbled voices and the hum of machinery, and Narong, apparently, speaking to someone nearby, his words unintelligible.Suddenly Narong's voice crackles loud, blotting out the background sounds."I'm sorry, we have our own information. "Kanya scowls at the whisper sheets on her desk, the ones that Pai brought in with a grim smile.Some speak of the fallen Somdet Chaopraya, others of General Pracha.They all talk of the assassin windup girl.Fast copies of Sawatdee Krung Thep!are already pouring into the city.Kanya scans the words.It's full of impassioned complaints against the white shirts who shut down harbors and anchor pads but cannot protect the Somdet Chaopraya from a single invasive."These whisper sheets are yours then?"she asks.Narong's silence is answer enough."Why did you even ask me to investigate?"She can't keep the bitterness from her voice."You were already moving. "Narong's cold voice crackles on the line."It's not your place to question. "His tone brings her up short."Did Akkarat do it?"she whispers fearfully."Was he the one responsible?Pracha says that Akkarat was involved somehow.Did he do it?"Another pause.Is it a thoughtful one?She can't tell.Finally Narong says, "No.I swear this.We are not the ones responsible. ""So you guess it must be Pracha then?"She shuffles through the licenses and permits on her desk."I'm telling you he is not the one!I have all the windup's records here.Pracha himself wanted me to investigate.To find every trace of her.I have her arrival papers with the Mishimoto people.I have disposal papers.I have visas.Everything. ""Who signed the disposal papers?"She fights her frustration."I can't read the signature.I need more time to cross reference who was on duty around that time. ""And by the time you do, they will inevitably be dead. ""Then why did Pracha set me to the task of finding this information?It doesn't make sense!I talked to the officers who took the bribes at that bar.They were nothing but silly boys, making a little extra money. ""He's clever then.He's covered his tracks. ""Why do you hate Pracha so much?""Why do you love him?Did he not order your village razed?""Not from malice. ""No?Did he not sell the fish farming permits to another village the next season?Sell them and line his pockets with the profits?"She falls silent.Narong moderates his tone."I'm sorry, Kanya.There's nothing we can do.We are certain of his crime.We have authorization from the palace to resolve this. ""With riots?"She shoves the whisper sheets off her desk."With a burning of the city?Please.I can stop this.It's not necessary.I can find the proof that we need.I can prove that the windup is not Pracha's.I can prove it. ""You're too close to this.Your loyalties are divided. ""I'm loyal to our Queen.Just give me a chance to stop this madness. "Another pause."I can give you three hours.If you have nothing by sunset, I can do nothing more. ""But you'll wait until then?"She can almost hear the smile on the other end of the line."I will. "And then the line is closed.And she is alone in her office.Jaidee settles himself on her desk."I'm curious.How will you prove Pracha's innocence?It's obvious that he's the one who placed her. ""Why can't you leave me alone?"Kanya asks.Jaidee smiles."Because it's sanuk.Very fun to watch you flail around and try to run for two masters. "He pauses, studying her."Why do you care what happens to General Pracha?He's not your real patron. "Kanya looks at him with hatred.She waves at the whisper sheets strewn about her office."It's just like it was five years ago. ""With Pracha and Prime Minister Surawong.With the December 12 gatherings. "Jaidee studies the whisper sheets."Akkarat moving against us, this time, though.So it's not entirely the same. "Outside the window of her office, a megodont bellows.Jaidee smiles."You hear that?We're arming.There's no way you can keep these two old bulls from clashing.I don't know why you would even try.Pracha and Akkarat have been bellowing and snorting at each other for years.It's time we had a good fight. ""This isn't muay thai, Jaidee. ""No.You're right about that. "For a moment his smile turns sad.Kanya stares at the whisper sheets, the collected paperwork on the windup's import.The windup is missing.But still, it came from the Japanese.Kanya studies the notes: she was brought across on a dirigible flight from Japan.An executive assistant   "And a killer," Jaidee interjects."Shut up.I'm thinking. "A Japanese windup.An abandoned bit of the island nation.Kanya stands abruptly, grabs her spring gun and shoves it into her holster as she gathers papers."Where are you going?"Jaidee asks.She favors him with a thin smile."If I told you, that would take away the sanuk. "Jaidee's phii grins."Now you're getting into the spirit of things. "36  The crowd around Emiko grows.People jostle her.There's nowhere to run.She's in the open, waiting to be discovered.Her first urge is to slash her way free, to fight for survival, even though there is no hope of escaping the crowd before she overheats.I will not die like an animal.I will fight them.They will bleed.She forces down that increasing panic.Tries to think.More people squeeze around her, trying to get close to the posted sheet.She is trapped among them, but no one has noticed her yet.As long as she doesn't move  The press of the crowd is almost an advantage.She can barely shake, let alone display the stutter stop motions that would betray her.Slowly.Carefully.Emiko allows herself to lean against the people, to push slowly through them, head down, pretending to be a woman sobbing, shaking with grief at a blow against the palace.She stares at her feet, finding her way through the crowd, pressing carefully through until she reaches the outer edge.People huddle in groups, crying, sitting on the ground, staring around the street, stunned.Emiko feels a certain pity for them.Remembers watching Gendo sama board his dirigible after he told her that he had done her a kindness, even as he abandoned her to the streets of Krung Thep.Focus, she tells herself angrily.She needs to get away.Needs to reach the alley where people will not notice her.Wait for darkness.Your description is everywhere: on methane posts, on the street, being trampled by the crowds.You have nowhere to go.She stifles the thought.The alley is enough.The alley, first.Then a new plan.She keeps her eyes on the ground.Clutches herself and mimes at sobbing.Shuffles for the alley.Slowly.Slowly."You!Get over here!"Emiko freezes.Forces herself to look up slowly.A man beckons her, angry.She starts to speak, to protest, but someone behind her speaks instead."You have something to say to me, heeya?"A young man pushes past her, wearing a yellow headband and carrying a fistful of leaflets."What's that you've got there, boy?"Others begin to drift over to watch the argument.The two start shouting at one another, posturing as they each try to establish dominance.Others start to take sides.To shout encouragement.Emboldened, the older slaps the younger and tries to tear off his yellow headband."You're not for the Queen.You're a traitor!"He strips the flyers from the young man's hand and throws them onto the ground.Stamps on them."Get out of here!Take heeya Pracha's lies with you. "As leaflets blow through the crowd, Emiko catches a glimpse of Akkarat's face, drawn in caricature, smiling as he tries to eat the Grand Palace.The younger one scrambles after his leaflets."They're not lies!Akkarat seeks to tear down the Queen.It's obvious!"People in the crowd jeer at him.But others shout encouragement.The boy turns away from the man, speaks to the crowd."Akkarat is hungry for power.He always wants "  The man kicks him in the ass.The boy whirls, enraged, and attacks.Emiko sucks in her breath.The boy is a fighter.Muay thai for certain.His elbow smashes into the man's head.The man collapses.The boy stands over him, screaming epithets, but his voice is drowned out by the crowd shouting and then others surge forward, enveloping him in a clot of fists.His screams fill the street.Emiko turns and slips through the growing fight, no longer careful of her movements.People jostle her, rushing to aid or defend, and she shoves through as quickly as she can.In this moment, she is nothing to any of these people.She stumbles out of the riot and into the alley's shadows.The fight is spreading down the street.Emiko hunts for garbage to cover herself.Behind her, glass shatters.Someone is screaming.She huddles beside a shattered WeatherAll crate, pulling refuse around her, durian rinds, the ripped hemp of a basket, discarded banana leaves, anything to give her cover.She freezes and hunkers low as rioters pelt down the alley, shouting.Everywhere she looks, she sees faces twisted with rage.37  The main compounds of Mishimoto & Co.lie on the far side of the water, in Thonburi.The boat makes its way into a khlong, Kanya's hand careful on the tiller.Even here, outside of Bangkok proper, whisper sheets complain of Pracha and the windup killer."Do you think it's a good idea to come alone?"Jaidee asks."I've got you.It's enough company for anyone. ""I'm not so great at muay thai in this state. ""Pity. "The company's gates and jetties rise over the waves.The late afternoon sun scalds down on them.A water merchant paddles close, but even though Kanya is hungry, she does not dare waste even a moment.Already the sun seems to be crashing out of the sky.Her boat thumps against the pier and she whips its bow rope around a cleat."I don't think they'll let you in," Jaidee says.Kanya doesn't bother answering.It's odd that he has remained with her all the way across the water.The pattern of his phii was to take interest in her for a short time, and then to drift off to other things and other people.Perhaps he visited his children.Made apologies to Chaya's mother.But now he is with her all the time.Jaidee says, "They won't be impressed with that white uniform, either.They've got too much influence with the Trade Ministry and the police. "Kanya doesn't answer, but sure enough, a Thonburi detachment of a police patrol guards the main gates of the compound.All around, the sea and khlongs lap.The Japanese are forward looking, and have built themselves entirely on the water, on floating bamboo rafts that are said to lie nearly fifty feet thick, creating a compound nearly impervious to the floods and tides of the Chao Phraya River."I need to speak with Mr.Yashimoto. ""He is not available. ""It concerns property of his that was damaged during the unfortunate raids on the airfields.Paperwork for reparations. "The guard smiles uncertainly.Ducks inside.Jaidee snickers."Clever. "Kanya makes a face at him."At least you have some use. ""Even if I'm dead. "A moment later they are being led into the halls of the compound.It is not a long walk.High walls obscure all evidence of manufacturing activity.The Megodont Union complains that no work could be accomplished without a power source, and yet the Japanese neither import their own megodonts, nor hire the union.It reeks of illegal technology.And yet the Japanese have provided a great deal of technical assistance to the Kingdom.In return for Thai seedstock advances, the Japanese provide the best of their sailing technologies.And so everyone is exquisitely careful not to ask too many questions about how a ship's hull is built and if the development process is entirely legal.A door opens.A pretty girl smiles and bows.Kanya nearly draws her spring gun.The creature before her is a windup.The girl doesn't seem to notice Kanya's unease, though.Simply motions in her stutter stop way for her to enter.Inside, the room is carefully decorated with tatami mats and Sumi e paintings.A man Kanya assumes is Mr.Yashimoto kneels, painting.The windup leads Kanya to a seat.Jaidee admires the art on the walls."He painted it all, you know. ""How would you know?""I came to see if they really have ten hands in their factory.Right after I died. ""And do they?"Jaidee shrugs."Go look for yourself. "Mr.Yashimoto dips his brush, and in an exquisitely swift motion completes the painting.He rises and bows to Kanya.He begins speaking in Japanese.The windup girl's own voice follows a second later, with a translation into Thai."I am honored by your visit. "He is silent for a moment and the windup girl falls silent as well.She is very pretty, Kanya supposes.In a strange porcelain way.Her cropped jacket is open at the collar, revealing the hollow of her throat, and her pale skirt molds fetchingly around her hips.She would be beautiful, if she were not so perverse."You know why I'm here?"He nods shortly."We have heard rumors of an unfortunate incident.And have seen our country discussed in your papers and whisper sheets. "He looks at her significantly."Many voices are being raised against us.Most unfair and inaccurate observations. "Kanya nods."We have questions "  "I wish to assure you that we are a friend of the Thai.From times long ago when we cooperated in the great war to now, we have always been a friend of the Thai. ""I want to know how "  Yashimoto interrupts again."Tea?"he offers.Kanya forces herself to remain polite."You're very kind. "Yashimoto motions to the windup girl, and she stands and leaves the room.Unconsciously, Kanya relaxes.The creature is unsettling.And yet now that she is gone, silence stretches between them as they wait for the translator to return.Kanya feels seconds ticking away, minutes being lost.Time, time, time moving.Storm clouds gathering and here she sits, waiting for tea.The windup girl returns, kneels beside them at the low table.Kanya forces herself not to speak, not to interrupt the girl's precise whisking and steeping of the tea, but it is an effort.The windup girl pours, and as Kanya watches the creature's strange movements, she thinks she sees a little of what the Japanese desired from their engineered servants.The girl is perfect, precise as clockwork, and contextualized by the tea ceremony, all her motions take on a ritual grace.The windup carefully does not observe Kanya in return.Does not say anything about her being a white shirt.Does not observe that in another context Kanya would happily mulch her.She ignores Kanya's Environment Ministry uniform entirely.Exquisitely polite.Yashimoto waits for Kanya to sip her tea, then sips himself.Sets his tea deliberately on the table."Our countries have been friends always," he says."Ever since our Emperor made a gift of tilapia to the Kingdom in the time of your great scientist King Bhumibol's time.We have always been steadfast. "He looks at her significantly."I hope that we can help you in this matter, but I wish to emphasize that we are friends of your country. ""Tell me about windups," Kanya says.Yashimoto nods."What do you wish to know?"He smiles, motions at the girl kneeling beside them."This one, you can see for yourself. "Kanya keeps her expression impassive.It is difficult.The creature beside her is beautiful.Her skin is sleek, her movements surprisingly elegant.And she makes Kanya's skin crawl."Tell me why you have them. "Yashimoto shrugs."We are an old nation; our young are few.Good girls like Hiroko fill the gap.We are not the same as the Thai.We have calories but no one to provide the labor.We need personal assistants.Workers. "Kanya carefully makes no show of disgust."Yes.You Japanese are very different.And except for your country, we have never granted this sort of niche "  "Crime," Jaidee supplies.   "exemption," she finishes."No one else is allowed to bring in creatures like this one. "She nods unwillingly at the translator, trying to hide the disgust in her voice."No other country.No other factory. ""We are aware of the privilege. ""And yet you abuse it by bringing a military windup "  Hiroko's words cut her off, even as Kanya continues to speak.Hiroko instead picks up the vehement response from her owner."No!This is impossible.We have no contact with such technology.None!"Yashimoto's face is flushed, and Kanya wonders at his sudden anger.What sort of cultural insult has she unwittingly delivered?The windup girl continues her translation, no trace of emotion on her own face as she speaks with her owner's voice."We work with New Japanese like Hiroko.She is loyal, thoughtful, and skilled.And a necessary tool.She is as necessary as a hoe for a farmer or a sword for a samurai. ""Strange that you mention a sword. ""Hiroko is no military creature.We do not have such technology. "Kanya reaches into her pocket and slaps down the picture of the windup killer."And yet one of yours, imported by you, registered to your staff, has now assassinated the Somdet Chaopraya and eight others, and disappeared into thin air, as if she is some raging phii.But you sit before me and tell me that it is impossible for a military windup to be here!"Her voice rises to a shout, and the windup girl's translation finishes at a similar intensity.Yashimoto's face stills.He takes the picture and studies it."We will have to check our records. "He nods to Hiroko.She takes the photo and disappears out the door.Kanya watches Yashimoto for traces of anxiety or nervousness, but there are none.Irritation, she sees, but no fear.She regrets that she cannot speak directly with the man.Listening to her words echo into Japanese, Kanya wonders what surprise is lost when the windup girl delivers them.What preparation Hiroko provides for his shock.They wait.He silently offers more tea.She refuses.He does not drink anymore himself.The tension in the room is so thick that Kanya half expects the man to leap to his feet and cut her down with the ancient sword that adorns the wall behind him.A few minutes later, Hiroko returns.She hands the picture back to Kanya with a bow.Then speaks to Yashimoto.Neither of them betray any emotion.Hiroko kneels again beside them.Yashimoto nods at the photograph."You're sure this was the one?"Kanya nods."There is no question. ""And this assassination explains the increasing rage in the city.There are crowds gathering outside the factory.Boat people.The police have driven them away, but they were coming with torches. "Kanya stifles her nervousness at the increasing frenzy.Everything is moving too fast.At some point, Akkarat and Pracha will be unable to back off without losing face and then everything will be lost."The people are very angry," she says."It is misplaced anger.She is not a military windup. "When Kanya tries to challenge him, he looks at her fiercely and she subsides."Mishimoto knows nothing of military windups.Nothing.Such creatures are kept under strict control.They are used by our Defense Ministry, only.I could never possess one. "He locks eyes with her."Never. ""And yet "  He continues to speak, with Hiroko translating, "I know of the windup you describe.She had fulfilled her duty "  The windup girl's voice breaks off even as the old man continues speaking.She straightens and her eyes flick to Yashimoto.He frowns at her break in decorum.Says something to the windup.She ducks her head."Hai. "Another pause.He nods at her to continue.She regains her composure, finishes translating."She was destroyed according to requirements, rather than repatriated. "The windup's dark eyes are on Kanya, steady, unblinking now, betraying nothing of the surprise she evinced a moment before.Kanya watches the girl and the old man, two alien people."And yet she apparently survived," she says finally."I was not the manager at the time," Yashimoto says."I can only speak to what I know from our records. ""Records lie, apparently. ""You are correct.For this, there is no excuse.I am ashamed of what others have done, but I have no knowledge of the thing. "Kanya leans forward."If you cannot tell me how she survived, then please, tell me how it is that this girl, capable of killing so many men in the space of heartbeats could come into this country.You tell me she is not military, but, to be direct, I'm having difficulty believing that she is not.This is a gross breach of our country's agreements. "Unexpectedly, the man's eyes crinkle with a smile.He picks up his tea and sips, considering the question, but the mirth does not leave his eyes, even as he finishes his tea."This I can answer. "Without warning, he flings his cup at Hiroko's face.Kanya starts to cry out.The windup girl's hand blurs.The teacup smacks into her palm.The girl gapes at the cup in her hand, as surprised apparently, as Kanya.The Japanese man gathers the folds of his kimono around himself."All New Japanese are fast.You have mistaken the question to ask.How they use their innate qualities is a question of their training, not of their physical capabilities.Hiroko has been trained from birth to pace herself appropriately, with decorum. "He nods at her skin."She is manufactured to have a porcelain skin and reduced pores, but it means she is subject to overheating.A military windup will not overheat, it is built to expend considerable energy without impact.Poor Hiroko here would die if she exerted herself like that over any significant amount of time.But all windups are potentially fast, it is in their genes. "His tone becomes serious."It is surprising though, that one has shaken off her training.Unwelcome news.New People serve us.It should not have happened. ""So your Hiroko here could do the same thing?Kill eight men?Armed ones?"Hiroko jerks and looks at Yashimoto, dark eyes widening.He nods.Says something.His tone is gentle."Hai. "She forgets to translate, then finds her words."Yes.It is possible.Unlikely, but possible. "She continues, "But it would take an extraordinary stimulus to do so.New People value discipline.Order.Obedience.We have a saying in Japan, 'New People are more Japanese than the Japanese. '"Yashimoto places a hand on Hiroko's shoulder."Circumstances would have to be extraordinary to make Hiroko into a killer. "He smiles confidently."This one you seek has fallen far from her proper place.You should destroy her before she can cause any more damage.We can provide assistance. "He pauses."Hiroko here can help you. "Kanya tries not to recoil, but her face gives her away.* * *   "Captain Kanya, I do believe you're smiling. "Jaidee's phii is still with her, perched on the prow of the skiff as it cuts across the Chao Phraya's wide mouth on a stiff breeze.Spray blows through his form, leaving him unaffected, even though Kanya expects him to be drenched each time.She favors him with a smile, allowing her sense of well being to reach out to him."Today, I did something good. "Jaidee grins."I listened to both ends of the conversation.Akkarat and Narong were very impressed with you. "Kanya pauses."You were with them as well?"He shrugs."I can go almost anywhere, it seems. ""Except on to your next life. "He shrugs again and smiles."I still have work here. ""Harassing me, you mean. "But her words have no venom.Under the warm light of the setting sun, with the city opening before her and waves splashing against her boat's hull as they cut across the water, Kanya can only be grateful that the conversation went so well.Even as she was talking to Narong, they were issuing orders to their people to pull back.She heard the radio announcement go out.They would meet with the December 12 loyalists.The beginning of a stand down.If the Japanese had not been so willing to take the blame for their rogue windup, it might have been different.But reparations were already being offered and Pracha was exonerated by the copious documentation the Japanese offered, and for once, all things were turning out well.Kanya can't help but feel a measure of pride.Wearing the yoke of two patrons has finally paid off.She wonders if it is kamma that places her so that she can bridge the gap between General Pracha and Minister Akkarat for the good of Krung Thep.Certainly, no one else could have pierced the barriers of face and pride that the two men and their factions had erected.Jaidee is still grinning at her."Imagine the things our country could accomplish if we were not always fighting one another. "In a burst of optimism, Kanya says, "Maybe anything is possible. "Jaidee laughs."You still have a windup to catch. "Involuntarily, Kanya's eyes go to her own windup girl.Hiroko has folded her legs under her and gazes out at the city that is rapidly approaching, watching with curious eyes as they thread between clipper ships and sailing skiffs and kink spring patrol boats.As if sensing Kanya's gaze, she turns.Their eyes lock.Kanya refuses to drop her gaze."Why do you hate New People?"the windup asks.Jaidee laughs."Can you lecture her about niche and nature?"Kanya looks away, glances behind her to the floating factories and drowned Thonburi.The prang of Wat Arun stand tall against the blood red sky.Again the question comes."Why do you hate my kind?"Kanya eyes the woman."Will you be mulched when Yashimoto sama returns to Japan?"Hiroko lowers her gaze.Kanya feels obscurely embarrassed that she seems to have hurt the windup's feelings, then shakes off the guilt.It's just a windup.It apes the motions of humanity, but it is only a dangerous experiment that has been allowed to proceed too far.A windup.Stutter stop motion and the telltale jerk of a genetically engineered beast.A smart one.And dangerous if pushed, apparently.Kanya watches the water as she guides her craft across the waves, but still she watches the windup out of the corner of her eye, viscerally aware that this windup contains the same wild speed of the other one.That all these windups have the potential to become lethal.Hiroko speaks again."We are not all like this one you hunt. "Kanya turns her gaze back on the windup."You are all unnatural.You are all grown in test tubes.You all go against niche.You all have no souls and have no kamma.And now one of you has " she breaks off, overwhelmed at the enormity, " destroyed our Queen's protector.You are more than similar enough for me. "Hiroko's eyes harden."Then send me back to Mishimoto. "Kanya shakes her head."No.You have your uses.You are good proof, if nothing else, that all windups are dangerous.And that the one we hunt is not a military creature.For that, you will be useful. ""We are not all dangerous," she insists again.Kanya shrugs."Mr.Yashimoto says you will be of some help in finding our killer.If that's true, then I have a use for you.If not, I would just as soon compost you with the rest of the daily dung collection.Your master insists that you will be useful, though I can't think how. "Hiroko looks away, across the water to her factories on the far side."I think you hurt her feelings," Jaidee murmurs."Are their feelings any more real than their souls?"Kanya leans against the tiller, angling the little skiff toward the docks.There is still so much to be done.Abruptly, Hiroko says."She will seek a new patron. "Kanya turns, surprised."What do you mean?""She has lost her Japanese owner.She has now lost this man who ran the bar she worked for. ""She killed him. "Hiroko shrugs."It is the same.She has lost her master.She must find a new one. ""How do you know?"Hiroko looks at her coldly."It is in our genes.We seek to obey.To have others direct us.It is a necessity.As important as water for a fish.It is the water we swim in.Yashimoto sama speaks correctly.We are more Japanese than even the Japanese.We must serve within a hierarchy.She must find a master. ""What if this one is different?If this one doesn't?""She will.She has no choice. ""Just like you. "Hiroko's dark eyes sweep back to her."Just so. "Is there a flicker of rage and despair in those eyes?Or does Kanya simply imagine it?Is it something Kanya assumes must be lurking deep within, an anthropomorphizing of a thing that is not and never will be human?A pretty puzzle.Kanya returns her attention to the water and their imminent arrival, checks the surrounding waves for other craft she will have to jostle with for slip space.She frowns."I don't know those barges. "Hiroko looks up."You keep such close watch on the waters?"Kanya shakes her head."I used to work the docks, when I was first inducted.Spot raids, checking imports.Good money. "She studies the barges."Those are built for heavy loads.More than just rice.I haven't seen"  She trails off, her heart starting to pound as she watches the machines wallow forward, great dark beasts, implacable."What is it?"Hiroko asks."They aren't spring driven. ""Yes?"Kanya pulls at her sail, letting the breezes of the river delta yank at the small boat, cutting away from the oncoming craft."It's military.They're all military. "38  Anderson can barely breathe under the hood.The blackness is total, hot with his own breath and suppressed fear.No one explained why he was being hooded and marched out of the flat.Carlyle was awake by then, but when he tried to protest their treatment, one of the Panthers clipped his ear with a rifle butt, letting blood, and they'd both fallen silent and allowed the hoods to be drawn over their heads.An hour later, they were kicked to their feet and herded down to some kind of transport that rumbled with exhaust fumes.Army, Anderson guessed, as he was shoved aboard.His broken finger hangs limply behind his back.If he flexes his hand the pain becomes extreme.He practices a careful breathing under the hood, controlling his fears and speculations.The close dusty fabric makes him cough, and when he coughs, his ribs send spikes of pain deep into his core.He breathes shallowly.Will they execute him as some kind of example?He hasn't heard Akkarat's voice in some time.Hasn't heard anything.He wants to whisper to Carlyle, to see if they are being kept in the same room, but doesn't feel like being clubbed again if it turns out there's a guard in the room with him.When they were let down from the vehicle and dragged into a new building, he had been unsure if Carlyle was even there.And then they were in an elevator.He thinks they descended into some sort of bunker, but it is ghastly hot in the place where they kicked him down.The place is stifling hot.The hood's fabric itches.Of all the things he wishes, he wishes he could scratch his nose where sweat trickles and then damps the fabric, leaving it itching.He tries to move his face, tries to get the fabric away from his mouth and nose.If he could just get a breath of clean air   A door clicks.Footsteps.Anderson freezes.Muffled voices above him.Suddenly hands grab him and yank him to his feet.He gasps as they jostle his broken ribs.The hands drag him along, guiding him through a series of turns and stops.A breeze kisses his arms, cooler, fresher air, some kind of air vents.He gets a whiff of the sea.Thai voices mutter around him.Footsteps.People moving.He has the sense that he is being led down a corridor.The steady arrival and recession of Thai voices.When he stumbles, his captors jerk him upright again and shove him onward.At last, they stop.The air is fresher here.He feels the wind of circulation systems, hears the ratchet of treadles and the high whine of flywheels.Some kind of processing center.His captors push him to stand straight.He wonders if this is how they will execute him.If he will die without seeing daylight again.The windup girl.The goddamn windup girl.He remembers the way she flew from the balcony, plunging into darkness.It wasn't the look of a suicide.The more he thinks about it, the more he is convinced that the look on her face was one of supreme confidence.Did she really kill the Queen's protector?But if she were the killer, how could she have been so afraid?It doesn't make sense.And now everything is wrecked.Christ, his nose itches.He sneezes, sucks dusty hood air, and starts coughing again.He doubles over, coughing, ribs screaming.The hood is ripped off his face.Anderson blinks as light spears his eyes.He sucks gratefully at the luxury of fresh air.Slowly straightens.A large room, full of men and women in army uniform.Treadle computers.Kink spring drums sitting in the room with them.Even an LED wall screen with views of the city as if they are in one of AgriGen's own processing centers.And a view.He was wrong, he didn't go down.He went up.High above the city.Anderson reorients his confused perceptions.They're in a tower somewhere, an old Expansion tower.Through the open windows he can see across the city.The setting sun glazes the air and buildings a dull red.Carlyle is there, too, looking dazed."My goodness, you both smell terrible. "Akkarat, standing nearby.Smiling with a certain sly humor.The Thais are said to have thirteen kinds of smile.Anderson wonders what sort he is looking at now.Akkarat says, "We'll have to get you a shower. "Anderson starts to speak, but another fit of coughing overwhelms him.He sucks air, trying to get his lungs under control, but keeps coughing.The cuffs dig into his wrists as he convulses.His ribs are a mass of pain.Carlyle doesn't say anything at all.He has blood on his forehead.Anderson can't tell if he fought his captors or if he's been tortured."Get him a glass of water," Akkarat says.Anderson's guards push him against a wall, shove him down until he's seated.This time he narrowly avoids jostling his broken finger.Water arrives.A guard holds the cup to Anderson's lips, letting him drink.Cool water.Anderson swallows, absurdly grateful.His coughing subsides.He makes himself look up at Akkarat."Thanks. ""Yes.Well.It seems we have a problem," Akkarat says."Your story checked out.Your windup is a rogue, after all. "He squats down beside Anderson."We have all been victims of bad luck.They say in the military that a good battle plan can last as long as five minutes in real fighting.After that, it comes down to if the general is favored by fate and the spirits.Bad luck, this.We must all adjust.And now, of course, I have many new problems that I must adjust to as well. "He nods at Carlyle."You both, of course, are angry at your treatment. "He grimaces."I could offer my apologies, but I'm not sure that it would be enough. "Anderson keeps his expression steady as he looks Akkarat in the eye."If you hurt us, you'll pay. ""AgriGen will punish us. "Akkarat nods."Yes.That is a problem.But then, AgriGen is always angry with us. ""Untie me, and we forget all this. ""Trust you, you mean.I worry that this is not wise. ""Revolutions are a rough business.I don't hold a grudge. "Anderson grins, feral, willing the man to believe."No harm, no foul.We still want the same things.Nothing's been done that can't be undone. "Akkarat cocks his head, thoughtful.Anderson wonders if he's about to get a knife in the ribs.Abruptly, Akkarat smiles."You are a hard man. "Anderson stifles a flutter of hope."Just practical.Our interests are still aligned.No one benefits with us dead.This is still a small misunderstanding that we can undo. "Akkarat considers.Turns to one of the guards and requests a knife.Anderson holds his breath as it comes close, but then the blade is slicing between his wrists, setting him free.His arms flood with tingling blood.He works them slowly.They feel like blocks of wood.Needle pricks follow."Christ. ""It will take a little while for your circulation to recover.Be glad we were gentle with you. "Akkarat catches sight of the way Anderson cradles his injured hand.Smiles with embarrassment and apology.Calls for a doctor before going over to Carlyle."What is this place?"Anderson asks."An emergency command center.When it was determined that the white shirts were involved I moved our operations here, for security. "Akkarat nods at the kink spring drums."We have megodont teams in the basement sending up power.And no one should know that we had this center equipped. ""I didn't know you had something like this. "Akkarat smiles."We are partners, not lovers.I do not share all my secrets with anyone. ""Have you caught the windup yet?""It's only a matter of time.Her likeness is now posted everywhere.The city will not permit her to live amongst us.It is one thing to bribe a few white shirts.Another to attack the palace. "Anderson thinks back to Emiko, to her huddled fear."I still can't believe that a windup could do something like that. "Akkarat glances up."It is confirmed by witnesses, and by the Japanese who constructed her.The windup is a killer.We will find her and execute her in the old way, and we will be done with her.And the Japanese will be made to pay reparations unimaginable for their criminal carelessness. "Abruptly he smiles."On this at least, the white shirts and I agree. "Carlyle's hands come free.Akkarat is called away by an army officer.Carlyle pulls off his gag."We friends again?"Anderson shrugs, watching the activity around them."As much as anyone in a revolution can be. ""How you doing?"Anderson touches his chest gingerly."Broken ribs. "He nods at his hand where the doctor is splinting his finger."Busted finger.Think my jaw's okay. "He shrugs."You?""Better than that.I think my shoulder's sprained.But I wasn't the one who introduced the rogue windup. "Anderson coughs and winces."Yeah, well, lucky you. "One of the army people is cranking a radio phone, gears ratcheting.Akkarat takes a call."Yes?"He nods, speaks in Thai.Anderson can only catch a few words, but Carlyle's eyes widen as he listens."They're taking the radio stations," he whispers."What?"Anderson scrambles to his feet, wincing, pushing aside the doctor still working on his hand.Guards lunge in front of him, blocking him from Akkarat.Anderson calls over their shoulders as they shove him back against the wall."You're starting?Now?"Akkarat glances up from his phone, finishes his conversation calmly and hands the receiver back to his communications officer.The winding man settles back on his haunches, waiting for the next call.The flywheel hum slows.Akkarat says, "The Somdet Chaopraya's assassination has brought out a great deal of hostility for the white shirts.Protests outside the Environment Ministry.Even the Megodont Union is involved.People were already angry at the Ministry's crackdowns.I have decided we will capitalize on this. ""But we don't have our assets in place," Anderson protests."You don't have all your army units down from the northeast.My strike teams aren't supposed to be ashore for another week. "Akkarat shrugs and smiles."Revolutions are a messy business.It is better to take the opportunities that come before us.Still, I think that you will be pleasantly surprised. "He turns back to his hand cranked radio phone.The steady whir of the flywheel fills the room as Akkarat talks to people under his command.Anderson watches Akkarat's back.The man, once so obsequious in the presence of the Somdet Chaopraya, is now in charge.He issues orders in a steady stream.Every so often the phone buzzes again for attention."This is crazy," Carlyle murmurs."Are we still in it at all?""Hard to say. "Akkarat glances over at them, seems about to say something, but instead he cocks his head."Listen," he says.His voice has become reverent.A rumble rolls across the city.Through the command post's open windows, light flares briefly, like lightning in a storm.Akkarat smiles."It's starting. "39  Pai is waiting for Kanya in her office when she comes bursting in."Where are the men?"she asks, panting."They were formed up in the bachelor's housing. "He shrugs."We came back from the village when we heard things were "  "Are they still there?""Maybe some of them.I heard Akkarat and Pracha were going to negotiate. ""No!"She shakes her head."Get them, now. "She's rushing around the room, grabbing extra spring gun clips."Get them formed up and armed.We don't have much time. "Pai stares at Hiroko."Is that the windup?""Don't worry about her.Do you know where General Pracha is?"He shrugs."I heard he inspected our walls and then he was going to speak with the Megodont Union about the protests "  She grimaces."Get the men formed up.We can't wait anymore. ""You're crazy "  An explosion shakes the ground.Outside, trees crackle as they crash to the ground.Pai leaps to his feet, a look of shock on his face.He runs to the window and stares outside.A warning klaxon starts to sound."It's Trade," Kanya says."They're already here. "She grabs her spring gun.Hiroko is preternaturally still, standing with her head cocked as though she is some sort of dog, listening.And then she turns slightly, her attention leaning forward, anticipatory.Another series of explosions rock the compound.The entire building shudders.Plaster crackles off the ceiling.Kanya rushes out of her office.Other white shirts stream out with her, those few who were working evening shifts, or who hadn't yet been assigned to patrol and containment on the docks and anchor pads.She dashes down the hall, followed closely by Hiroko and Pai, and charges outside.The night has the scent of jasmine blossoms, sweet and strong, along with the smell of smoke and the tang of something else, something she has not smelled since military convoys rolled across the ancient friendship bridge, over the Mekong and on toward the insurgents in Vietnam  A tank smashes through the outer walls.It is a metal monster, taller than two men, jungle mottled and belching smoke from its furnace.Its main gun fires.The muzzle flashes and the tank heaves back on its treads.Its turret swivels, gears clanking, choosing another target.Masonry and marble shower down over Kanya.She dives for cover.Behind the tank, war megodonts rush through the gap.Their tusks glint in the darkness, their riders are all in black.In the dimness, the few white shirts who have come out to defend the compound stand out like pale ghosts, easy targets.The whine of high capacity springs comes from atop the megodonts and then the chatter of disks slashing all around her.Concrete chips rain down.Kanya's cheek opens.Suddenly she is lying on the ground, buried under the weight of Hiroko, who has shoved her down as more spring gun disks slash the air and crackle against the walls behind her.Another explosion.The noise fills her whole head.She realizes that she is whimpering.Sounds have suddenly become distant.She's shaking with fear.The tank rumbles into the center of the courtyard.Rotates.More megodonts pour through, their feet tangled in a wave of shock troops also rushing the gap.It's too far away to even make out which general has decided to betray Pracha.Scattered small arms spit from the upper stories of the Ministry buildings.Screams echo, Ministry people dying.Kanya pulls out her spring gun and takes aim.Beside her, a records clerk takes a disk and falls.Kanya holds her pistol carefully, fires a shot.Can't tell if it hits her man or not.Fires again.Sees him fall.The mass of troops flowing toward her is like a tsunami.Jaidee appears at her shoulder."What about your men?"he asks."Are you going to sell yourself so easily and neglect those boys who rely on you?"Kanya pulls the trigger again.She can barely see.She is crying.Men are spreading across the courtyards, squads leapfrogging under covering fire."Please, Captain Kanya. "Hiroko begs."We must run. ""Go!"Jaidee urges."It's too late to fight. "Kanya lets her finger off the trigger.Disks chatter around her.She rolls and scrambles for the doorway, lunges back into the relative safety of the building.Scrambles to her feet and runs for the exit at the opposite side of the building.More shells hit.The building shakes.She wonders if it will collapse before she makes the far side.Memories from her childhood flood her as she jumps bloody bodies, following Hiroko and Pai.Memories of destruction and horror.Of coal burning tanks roaring through villages, screaming down the remaining paved roads of the provinces in long columns before plowing out across rice paddies.Tanks running hard and fast for the Mekong, their treads tearing up the earth on their way to defend the Kingdom from the first surprise incursions of the Vietnamese.Black smoke roiling in their wake as they went to hold the border.And now the monsters are here.She bursts through the far side of the Ministry and into a firestorm.Trees burning.Some sort of napalm strike.Smoke roils around her.Another tank smashes a distant gate, coming faster than any megodont.It is difficult for her mind to process how quickly they move.They are like tigers, streaking across the grounds.Men fire their spring guns, but they are nothing against the iron shells of the tanks; they are not built for warfare.The chatter of weapons fire rattles along with bright flashes of light.Silvery disks chatter all around, bouncing and slashing.White shirts run for cover, but they have no place to go.Red blossoms on white.Men are disassembled by explosions.More tanks pour through."Who are they?"Pai screams.Kanya shakes her head dumbly.The armored division ravages through the burning trees of the Environment Ministry's grounds.More troops are pouring in."They have to be from the northeast.Akkarat is making his move.Pracha has been betrayed. "She yanks at Pai, points him toward a slight rise and the shadows of unburned trees, pointing toward where the Phra Seub Temple may still be standing.Perhaps they can escape.Pai stares, but doesn't move.Kanya yanks him again and then they are off and running across the grounds.Palm trees crash down in their path, crackling and flaming.Coconuts rain green around them along with shrapnel bursts.The screams of men and women being torn apart by the well oiled military machine fill the air."Where now?"Pai yells.Kanya doesn't have an answer.She ducks as wood splinters shower her and dives behind the partial cover of a fallen burning palm.Jaidee flops down beside her and grins, not even sweating.He peers over the top of the log, then glances back at Kanya."So.Who will you fight for now, Captain?"40  The tank surprises them all.One moment they are riding a pair of cycle rickshaws down a nearly empty street, the next, a roaring fills the air and a tank bursts into the intersection ahead.It has a loudspeaker that squawks something, perhaps a warning, and then its turret spins in their direction."Hide!"Hock Seng shouts as they all try to scramble off their bikes.The tank's barrel roars.Hock Seng hits the ground.A building face collapses, showering them with debris.Clouds of gray dust billow over him.Hock Seng coughs and tries to get up and crawl away but a rifle chatters and he throws himself flat again.He can't see anything in the dust.Answering small arms fire crackles from a nearby building and then the tank is firing again.The smoke clears slightly.From an alley, Laughing Chan waves for Hock Seng.His hair is powdered gray and his face is coated with dust.His mouth moves but no sound comes out.Hock Seng tugs at Pak Eng and they scramble for safety.The hatch of the tank pops open and an armored gunner appears, firing with a spring rifle.Pak Eng goes down, his chest blossoming red.Peter Kuok ducks into an alley and Hock Seng glimpses him running.Hock Seng dives flat again and worms himself into the rubble.The tank fires again, rocking back on its treads.More small arms fire chatters from somewhere down the street.The man in the turret flops forward, dead.His rifle slides down the tank's armor.The tank engages and spins on its treads, clanking.Garbage and leaflets swirl around it.It lurches toward Hock Seng and accelerates.Hock Seng lunges aside as the tank crashes past, showering him with more debris.Laughing Chan stares after the retreating vehicle.He says something but Hock Seng's ears are still ringing.He waves for Hock Seng to join him again.Hock Seng staggers upright and stumbles into the soi's relative safety.Laughing Chan cups his hands around Hock Seng's ear.His shout is a whisper."It's fast!Faster than a megodont!"Hock Seng nods.He's shaking.It appeared so suddenly.So much faster than anything he has ever seen.Old Expansion technology.And the men driving it seemed mad.Hock Seng looks around at the rubble."I don't even know what they were doing here.There's nothing to secure," he says.Laughing Chan suddenly begins to laugh.His distant words tunnel past the ringing in Hock Seng's ears."Maybe they're lost!"And then they are both laughing, and Hock Seng is almost hysterical with relief.They sit in the alley, resting and trying to catch their breath and giggling.Slowly, Hock Seng's hearing returns."It's worse than the Green Headbands. "Laughing Chan says, looking out at the street wreckage."At least with them, it was personal. "He makes a face."You could fight them.These ones are too fast.And too crazy.Fengle, all of them. "Hock Seng is inclined to agree."Still, dead is dead.I would rather not face either. ""We'll have to be more careful," Laughing Chan says.He nods at Pak Eng's body."What should we do about him?""Do you want to carry him back to the towers?"Hock Seng asks pointedly.Chan shakes his head, grimacing.Another explosion rumbles.From the sound of it, it's no more than a few blocks away.Hock Seng looks up."The tank again?""Let's not wait to find out. "They set off down the street, keeping to doorways.A few others are out in the open, looking toward the rumbling explosions.Trying to see where the noises are coming from, to see what is happening.Hock Seng remembers standing on a similar street only a few years before, the scent of the sea and the promise of the monsoon bright in the air the day the Green Headbands started their cleansing.And on that day, too, people had looked up like pigeons, heads swiveling toward the sound of slaughter, suddenly aware that they were in danger.Ahead, unmistakable, the chatter of spring guns.Hock Seng motions to Laughing Chan and they turn into a new alley.He's too old for this foolishness.He should be reclining on a couch, smoking a bowl of opium while a pretty fifth wife massages his ankles.Behind them, the rest of the people on the street are still standing out in the open, still staring toward the sounds of battle.The Thais don't know what to do.Not yet.They have no experience with true slaughter.Their reflexes are wrong.Hock Seng turns into an abandoned building."Where are you going?"Laughing Chan asks."I want to see.I need to know what's happening. "He climbs.One stairwell, two stairwells, three, four.He's panting.Five.Six.Then out into a hall.Broken doors, stifling close heat, the smell of excrement.Another explosion rumbles distant.Through an open window, tracers of fire arc across the darkening sky and boom in the distance.Small arms snap and chatter in the streets like Spring Festival fireworks.Smoke pillars rise from a dozen points in the city.Nagas coiling, black against the setting sun.The anchor pads, the sea locks, the manufacturing district the Environment Ministry  Laughing Chan grabs Hock Seng's shoulder and points.Hock Seng sucks in his breath.The Yaowarat slum blazes, WeatherAll shanties exploding in a spreading curtain of flame."Wode tian. "Laughing Chan murmurs."We won't be going back there. "Hock Seng stares at the burning slum that had been his home, watching with horror as all his cash and gems turn to ash.Fate is fickle.He laughs wearily."And you thought I wasn't lucky.We'd be roasted like pigs by now, if we had stayed. "Laughing Chan makes a mock wai at him."I will follow the lord of the Three Prosperities into the nine hells. "He pauses."But what do we do now?"Hock Seng points."We follow Thanon Rama XII, and then "  He doesn't see the missile strike.It's too fast for any human being's eyes.Perhaps a military windup would have time to prepare, but he and Laughing Chan are thrown off their feet by the shockwave.A building collapses across the street."Never mind!"Laughing Chan grabs Hock Seng and drags him back toward the safety of the stairwells."We'll work it out.I don't want to lose my head for the sake of your view. "Newly cautious, they slip through the darkening streets, working their way toward the manufacturing district.The streets are becoming more deserted as the Thais finally learn there is no safety in the open."What's that?"Laughing Chan whispers.Hock Seng squints into the gloom.A trio of men crouch around a hand cranked radio.One of them has an antenna in his hands that he holds over his head, trying to get reception.Hock Seng slows to walk, then urges Laughing Chan across the street to them."What news?"Hock Seng puffs."Did you see that missile hit?"one of them asks.He looks up."Yellow cards," he murmurs.His companions exchange glances as they catch sight of Laughing Chan's machete, then smile nervously and start to shy away.Hock Seng sketches a clumsy wai."We just want the news. "One of them spits betel nut, still watching suspiciously, but he says, "It's Akkarat, on the air. "He gestures for them to listen.His friend lifts the antenna again, pulling in static.   "stay indoors.Do not go outside.General Pracha and his white shirts have attempted to topple Her Royal Majesty the Queen herself.It is our duty to defend the realm " The voice crackles out of reception and the man begins fiddling with the knobs on the wireless again.One of them shakes his head."It's all lies. "The one doing the tuning murmurs a disagreement, "But the Somdet Chaopraya "  "Akkarat would kill Rama himself if he saw a benefit. "Their friend lowers the antenna.The radio hisses static and the transmission is lost entirely as he speaks."I had a white shirt in my shop the other day, and he wanted to take my daughter home with him.A 'gift of good will,' he called it.They're all monitor lizards.A little corruption is one thing but these heeya will "  Another explosion shakes the ground.Everyone turns, Thais and yellow cards together, trying to fix on the location.We're like little monkeys, trying to understand a huge jungle.The thought frightens Hock Seng.They're piecing together clues, but they have nothing to provide context.No matter how much they learn, it can never be enough.They can only react to events as they unfold, and hope for luck.Hock Seng tugs Laughing Chan's arm."Let's go. "The Thais are already hurriedly gathering the radio and ducking back into their shop.When Hock Seng looks back again, the street corner is entirely empty, as if the moment of political discussion hadn't existed at all.The fighting worsens as they near the manufacturing district.The Environment Ministry and the Army seem to be everywhere, warring.And for every professional unit on the street, there are others, the volunteers and student associations and civilians and loyalists, mobilized by political factions.Hock Seng pauses in a doorway, panting, as explosions and rifle fire echo."I can't tell any of them apart," Laughing Chan mutters as a group of university students carrying short machetes and wearing yellow armbands runs past, headed for a tank that's busy shelling an old Expansion tower."They're all wearing yellow. ""Everyone wants to claim loyalty to the Queen. ""Does she even exist?"Hock Seng shrugs.A student's spring gun blades bounce off the tank's armor.The thing is huge.Hock Seng can't help being impressed that the Army has successfully loaded so many tanks into the capital.He supposes the Navy and its admirals provided assistance.Which means General Pracha and his white shirts have no allies left."They're all crazy," Hock Seng mutters."It doesn't make any difference who is who. "He studies the street.His knee is hurting, his old injury making him slow."I wish we could find some bicycles.My leg" He grimaces."If you were on a bike, shooting you would be as easy as shooting a grandmother on a stoop. "Hock Seng rubs his knee."Still, I'm too old for this. "Rubble showers them from another explosion.Laughing Chan brushes debris out of his hair."I hope this is worth the trip. ""You could be back in the slums, roasting alive. ""That's true. "Laughing Chan nods."But let's hurry.I don't want to keep testing our luck. "More dark intersections.More violence.Rumors flying on the streets.Executions in Parliament.The Trade Ministry in flames.Thammasat University students rallying on behalf of the Queen.And then another radio broadcast.A new frequency, everyone says, as they all huddle around the tinny speaker.The announcer sounds shaken.Hock Seng wonders if there is a spring gun at her head.Khun Supawadi.She was always so popular.Always introduced such interesting radio plays.And now her voice trembles as she begs her countrymen to stay calm while tanks rush through the streets, securing everything from the anchor pads to the docks.The radio's speaker crackles with the sound of shelling and explosions.A few seconds later, explosions rumble in the distance like muffled thunder, a perfect echo of the ones on the radio."She's closer to the fighting than we are," Laughing Chan says."Is that a good sign, or a bad one?"Hock Seng wonders.Laughing Chan starts to answer but a megodont's screams of rage interrupt, followed by the whine of spring guns unleashing.Everyone looks down the street."That sounds bad. ""Hide," Hock Seng says."Too late. "A wave of people pours around the corner, running and screaming.A trio of carbon armored megodonts thunders behind them.The massive heads sweep low, slashing from side to side, their tusks slash through the fleeing people with attached scythe blades.Bodies split like oranges and fly like leaves.From atop the megodonts, machine gun cages open fire.Flickering silver streams of bladed disks pour into the packed crowd.Hock Seng and Laughing Chan crouch in a doorway as people flee past.The white shirts in their midst fire their own spring guns and single shot rifles as they run, but the disks are entirely ineffective against the armored megodonts.The Environment Ministry isn't equipped for this sort of warfare.Ricocheting ammunition flurries around them as the machine guns chatter.People collapse in bloody writhing piles, howling agony as the megodonts trample over them.Dust and smoke and musk choke the street.A man is flung aside by a megodont and slams into Hock Seng.Blood gouts from his mouth, but he is already dead.Hock Seng crawls out from under the corpse.More people are forming up and firing at the megodonts.Students, Hock Seng thinks, perhaps from Thammasat, but it's impossible to tell who they are loyal to, and Hock Seng wonders if even they know who they are fighting.The megodonts wheel and charge.People pile up against Hock Seng, trying to get out of the way.Their mass crushes him.He can't breath.He tries to cry out, to clear space for himself, but the crush is too great.He screams.The weight of desperate fleeing people presses down upon him, squeezing out the last of his air.A megodont sweeps into them.It backs and charges again, tearing into the clot of people, swinging its bladed tusks.Students throw bottles of oil up at the megodonts and hurl torches up after, spinning lights and fire   More razor disks rain down.Hock Seng cowers as the guns sweep toward him, spitting silver.A boy stares into his eyes, yellow headband slipped down over his bleeding face.Hock Seng's leg blossoms with pain.He can't tell if he's shot or if his knee is broken.He screams in frustration and fear.The weight of bodies pushes him to the ground.He's going to die.Crushed under the dead.Despite everything, he failed to understand the capriciousness of warfare.In his arrogance he thought he could prepare.Such a fool  Silence comes suddenly.His ears are ringing, but there's no more weapons fire and no more trumpeting megodonts.Hock Seng takes a shuddering breath beneath the weight of bodies.All around him, he hears only moans and sobbing."Ah Chan?"he calls.No answer.Hock Seng claws his way out.Others are dragging themselves free of the massacre as well.Helping their wounded.Hock Seng can barely stand.His leg is awash with pain.He's covered with blood.He searches through the bodies, trying to find Laughing Chan, but if the man is in the pile, he is covered in too much blood and there are too many bodies and it is too dark to pick him out.Hock Seng calls for him again, peering into the mass.Down the street, a methane lamp burns bright, shattered, its neck spurting gas into the sky.Hock Seng supposes it could explode at any moment, ripping through the methane pipes of the city, but he can't muster the energy to care.He stares around at the bodies.Most of them are students, it seems.Just foolish children.Trying to do battle with megodonts.Fools.He forces down memories of his own children, dead and piled.The massacres of Malaya, writ on Thai pavement.He pries a spring gun from a dead white shirt's hands, checks its load.Only a few disks left, but still.He pumps the spring, adding energy.Shoves it into his pocket.Children playing at war.Children who don't deserve to die, but are too foolish to live.In the distance, the battle rages still, moved on to other avenues and other victims.Hock Seng limps down the street.Bodies lie everywhere.He reaches an intersection and hobbles across, too tired to care about the risk of being caught in the open.At the far side, a man lies slumped against a wall, his bicycle lying beside him.Blood soaks his lap.Hock Seng picks up the bicycle."That's mine," the man says.Hock Seng pauses, studying the man.The man can barely keep his eyes open, yet still he clings to normalcy, to the idea that something like a bicycle can be owned.Hock Seng turns and wheels the bicycle down off the sidewalk.The man calls out again, "That's mine. "But he doesn't stand and he doesn't do anything to stop Hock Seng as he swings a leg over the frame and sets his feet on the pedals.If the man complains again, Hock Seng doesn't hear it.41  "I thought we weren't going to move for another two weeks," Anderson protests."We don't have everything in place. ""Plans must change.Your weapons and funding are still quite helpful. "Akkarat shrugs."In any case, having farang shock troops in the city would not necessarily smooth the transition.It's possible that this accelerated timetable is best. "Explosions rumble across the city.A methane fire is burning, bright and green, yellowing now as it finds dry bamboo and other materials.Akkarat studies the burn, waves to the man with the radio phone.The private cranks at the power as Akkarat speaks quietly, issuing orders for fire teams to be dispatched to the blaze.
