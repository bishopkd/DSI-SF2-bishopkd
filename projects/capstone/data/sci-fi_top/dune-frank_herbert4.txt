The banker turned a sickly grin toward Jessica, said: My Lady, I fear Ive overindulged in your wines.You serve potent drink at table, and Im not accustomed to it.Jessica heard the venom beneath his tone, spoke sweetly: When strangers meet, great allowance should be made for differences of custom and training.Thank you, my Lady, he said.The dark haired companion of the stillsuit manufacturer leaned toward Jessica, said: The Duke spoke of our being secure here.I do hope that doesnt mean more fighting.She was directed to lead the conversation this way, Jessica thought.Likely this will prove unimportant,Jessica said.But theres so much detail requiring the Dukes personal attention in these times.As long as enmity continues between Atreides and Harkonnen we cannot be too careful.The Duke has sworn kanly.He will leave no Harkonnen agent alive on Arrakis, of course.She glanced at the Guild Bank agent.And the Conventions, naturally, support him in this.She shifted her attention to Kynes.Is this not so, Dr Kynes?Indeed it is, Kynes said.The stillsuit manufacturer pulled his companion back.She looked at him, said: I do believe Ill eat something now.Id like some of that bird dish you served earlier.Jessica signaled a servant, turned to the banker: And you, sir, were speaking of birds earlier and of their habits.I find so many interesting things about Arrakis.Tell me, where is the spice found?Do the hunters go deep into the desert?Oh, no, my Lady, he said.Very littles known of the deep desert.And almost nothing of the southern regions.Theres a tale that a great Mother Lode of spice is to be found in the southern reaches, Kynes said, but I suspect it was an imaginative invention made solely for purposes of a song.Some daring spice hunters do, on occasion, penetrate into the edge of the central belt, but thats extremely dangerous  navigation is uncertain, storms are frequent.Casualties increase dramatically the farther you operate from Shield Wall bases.It hasnt been found profitable to venture too far south.Perhaps if we had a weather satellite   Bewt looked up, spoke around a mouthful of food: Its said the Fremen travel there, that they go anywhere and have hunted out soaks and sip wells even in the southern latitudes.Soaks and sip wells?Jessica asked.Kynes spoke quickly: Wild rumors, my Lady.These are known on other planets, not on Arrakis.A soak is a place where water seeps to the surface or near enough to the surface to be found by digging according to certain signs.A sip well is a form of soak where a person draws water through a straw  so it is said.Theres deception in his words, Jessica thought.Why is he lying?Paul wondered.How very interesting, Jessica said.And she thought: It is said  What a curious speech mannerism they have here.If they only knew what it reveals about their dependence on superstitions.Ive heard you have a saying, Paul said, that polish comes from the cities; wisdom from the desert.There are many sayings on Arrakis, Kynes said.Before Jessica could frame a new question, a servant bent over her with a note.She opened it, saw the Dukes handwriting and code signs, scanned it.Youll all be delighted to know, she said, that our Duke sends his reassurances.The matter which called him away has been settled.The missing carryall has been found.A Harkonnen agent in the crew overpowered the others and flew the machine to a smugglers base, hoping to sell it there.Both man and machine were turned over to our forces.She nodded to Tuek.The smuggler nodded back.Jessica refolded the note, tucked it into her sleeve.Im glad it didnt come to open battle, the banker said.The people have such hopes the Atreides will bring peace and prosperity.Especially prosperity, Bewt said.Shall we have our dessert now?Jessica asked.Ive had our chef prepare a Caladan sweet: pongi rice in sauce dolsa.It sounds wonderful, the stillsuit manufacturer said.Would it be possible to get the recipe?Any recipe you desire, Jessica said, registering the man for later mention to Hawat.The stillsuit manufacturer was a fearful little climber and could be bought.Small talk resumed around her: Such a lovely fabric  He is having a setting made to match the jewel  We might try for a production increase next quarter   Jessica stared down at her plate, thinking of the coded part of Letos message: The Harkonnens tried to get a shipment of lasguns.We captured them.This may mean theyve succeeded with other shipments.It certainly means they dont place much store in shields.Take appropriate precautions.Jessica focused her mind on lasguns, wondering.The white hot beams of disruptive light could cut through any known substance, provided that substance was not shielded.The fact that feedback from a shield would explode both lasgun and shield did not bother the Harkonnens.Why?A lasgun shield explosion was a dangerous variable, could be more powerful than atomics, could kill only the gunner and his shielded target.The unknowns here filled her with uneasiness.Paul said: I never doubted wed find the carryall.Once my father moves to solve a problem, he solves it.This is a fact the Harkonnens are beginning to discover.Hes boasting, Jessica thought.He shouldnt boast.No person wholl be sleeping far below ground level this night as a precaution against lasguns has the right to boast.There is no escape  we pay for the violence of our ancestors.from The Collected Sayings of MuadDib by the Princess Irulan    Jessica heard the disturbance in the great hall, turned on the light beside her bed.The clock there had not been properly adjusted to local time, and she had to subtract twenty one minutes to determine that it was about 2 A. M.   The disturbance was loud and incoherent.Is this the Harkonnen attack?she wondered.She slipped out of bed, checked the screen monitors to see where her family was.The screen showed Paul asleep in the deep cellar room theyd hastily converted to a bedroom for him.The noise obviously wasnt penetrating to his quarters.There was no one in the Dukes room, his bed was unrumpled.Was he still at the field C. P. ?There were no screens yet to the front of the house.Jessica stood in the middle of her room, listening.There was one shouting, incoherent voice.She heard someone call for Dr Yueh.Jessica found a robe, pulled it over her shoulders, pushed her feet into slippers, strapped the crysknife to her leg.Again, a voice called out for Yueh.Jessica belted the robe around her, stepped into the hallway.Then the thought struck her: What if Letos hurt?The hall seemed to stretch out forever under her running feet.She turned through the arch at the end, dashed past the dining hall and down the passage to the Great Hall, finding the place brightly lighted, all the wall suspensors glowing at maximum.To her right near the front entry, she saw two house guards holding Duncan Idaho between them.His head lolled forward, and there was an abrupt, panting silence to the scene.One of the house guards spoke accusingly to Idaho: You see what you did?You woke the Lady Jessica.The great draperies billowed behind the men, showing that the front door remained open.There was no sign of the Duke or Yueh.Mapes stood to one side staring coldly at Idaho.She wore a long brown robe with serpentine design at the hem.Her feet were pushed into unlaced desert boots.So I woke the Lady Jessica, Idaho muttered.He lifted his face toward the ceiling, bellowed: My sword was firs blooded on Grumman!Great Mother!Hes drunk!Jessica thought.Idahos dark, round face was drawn into a frown.His hair, curling like the fur of a black goat, was plastered with dirt.A jagged rent in his tunic exposed an expanse of the dress shirt he had worn at the dinner party earlier.Jessica crossed to him.One of the guards nodded to her without releasing his hold on Idaho.We didnt know what to do with him, my Lady.He was creating a disturbance out front, refusing to come inside.We were afraid locals might come along and see him.That wouldnt do at all.Give us a bad name here.Where has he been?Jessica asked.He escorted one of the young ladies home from the dinner, my Lady.Hawats orders.Which young lady?One of the escort wenches.You understand, my Lady?He glanced at Mapes, lowered his voice.Theyre always calling on Idaho for special surveillance of the ladies.And Jessica thought: So they are.But why is he drunk?She frowned, turned to Mapes.Mapes, bring a stimulant.Id suggest caffeine.Perhaps theres some of the spice coffee left.Mapes shrugged, headed for the kitchen.Her unlaced desert boots slap slapped against the stone floor.Idaho swung his unsteady head around to peer at an angle toward Jessica.Killed moren three hunner men fr the Duke, he muttered.Whadduh wanna know is whym mere?Cant live unner th groun here.Cant live onna groun here.Wha kinna place is iss, huh?A sound from the side hall entry caught Jessicas attention.She turned, saw Yueh crossing to them, his medical kit swinging in his left hand.He was fully dressed, looked pale, exhausted.The diamond tattoo stood out sharply on his forehead.Th good docker!Idaho shouted.Whadre you, Doc?Splint n pill man?He turned blearily toward Jessica.Makin uh damn fool uh mself, huh?Jessica frowned, remained silent, wondering: Why would Idaho get drunk?Was he drugged?Too much spice beer, Idaho said, attempting to straighten.Mapes returned with a steaming cup in her hands, stopped uncertainly behind Yueh.She looked at Jessica, who shook her head.Yueh put his kit on the floor, nodded greeting to Jessica, said: Spice beer, eh?Bes damn stuff ever tased, Idaho said.He tried to pull himself to attention.My sword was firs blooded on Grumman!Killed a Harkon  Harkon  killed im fr th Duke.Yueh turned, looked at the cup in Mapes hand.What is that?Caffeine,Jessica said.Yueh took the cup, held it toward Idaho.Drink this, lad.Don wan any more t drink.Drink it, I say!Idahos head wobbled toward Yueh, and he stumbled one step ahead, dragging the guards with him.Im almighdy fed up with pleasin th Mperial Universe, Doc.Jus once, were gonna do th thing my way.After you drink this, Yueh said.Its just caffeine.Sprolly like all res uh this place!Damn sun stoo brighd.Nothin has uh righd color.Everthings wrong or   Well, its nighttime now, Yueh said.He spoke reasonably.Drink this like a good lad.Itll make you feel better.Don wanna feel bedder!We cant argue with him all night, Jessica said.And she thought: This calls for shock treatment.Theres no reason for you to stay, my Lady, Yueh said.I can take care of this.Jessica shook her head.She stepped forward, slapped Idaho sharply across the cheek.He stumbled back with his guards, glaring at her.This is no way to act in your Dukes home, she said.She snatched the cup from Yuehs hands, spilling part of it, thrust the cup toward Idaho.Now drink this!Thats an order!Idaho jerked himself upright, scowling down at her.He spoke slowly, with careful and precise enunciation: I do not take orders from a damn Harkonnen spy.Yueh stiffened, whirled to face Jessica.Her face had gone pale, but she was nodding.It all became clear to her  the broken stems of meaning she had seen in words and actions around her these past few days could now be translated.She found herself in the grip of anger almost too great to contain.It took the most profound of her Bene Gesserit training to quiet her pulse and smooth her breathing.Even then she could feel the blaze flickering.They were always calling on Idaho for surveillance of the ladies!She shot a glance at Yueh.The doctor lowered his eyes.You knew this?she demanded.I  heard rumors, my Lady.But I didnt want to add to your burdens.Hawat!she snapped.I want Thufir Hawat brought to me immediately!But, my Lady   Immediately!It has to be Hawat, she thought.Suspicion such as this could come from no other source without being discarded immediately.Idaho shook his head, mumbled: Chuck th whole damn thing.Jessica looked down at the cup in her hand, abruptly dashed its contents across Idahos face.Lock him in one of the guest rooms of the east wing, she ordered.Let him sleep it off.The two guards stared at her unhappily.One ventured: Perhaps we should take him someplace else, mLady.We could   Hes supposed to be here!Jessica snapped.He has a job to do here.Her voice dripped bitterness.Hes so good at watching the ladies.The guard swallowed.Do you know where the Duke is?she demanded.Hes at the command post, my Lady.Is Hawat with him?Hawats in the city, my Lady.You will bring Hawat to me at once,Jessica said.I will be in my sitting room when he arrives.But, my Lady   If necessary, I will call the Duke, she said.I hope it will not be necessary.I would not want to disturb him with this.Yes, my Lady.Jessica thrust the empty cup into Mapes hands, met the questioning stare of the blue within blue eyes.You may return to bed, Mapes.Youre sure youll not need me?Jessica smiled grimly.Im sure.Perhaps this could wait until tomorrow, Yueh said.I could give you a sedative and   You will return to your quarters and leave me to handle this my way, she said.She patted his arm to take the sting out of her command.This is the only way.Abruptly, head high, she turned and stalked off through the house to her rooms.Cold walls  passages  a familiar door  She jerked the door open, strode in, and slammed it behind her.Jessica stood there glaring at the shield blanked windows of her sitting room.Hawat!Could he be the one the Harkonnens bought?We shall see.Jessica crossed to the deep, old fashioned armchair with an embroidered cover of schlag skin, moved the chair into position to command the door.She was suddenly very conscious of the crysknife in its sheath on her leg.She removed the sheath and strapped it to her arm, tested the drop of it.Once more, she glanced around the room, placing everything precisely in her mind against any emergency: the chaise near the corner, the straight chairs along the wall, the two low tables, her stand mounted zither beside the door to her bedroom.Pale rose light glowed from the suspensor lamps.She dimmed them, sat down in the armchair, patting the upholstery, appreciating the chairs regal heaviness for this occasion.Now, let him come, she thought.We shall see what we shall see.And she prepared herself in the Bene Gesserit fashion for the wait, accumulating patience, saving her strength.Sooner than she had expected, a rap sounded at the door and Hawat entered at her command.She watched him without moving from the chair, seeing the crackling sense of drug induced energy in his movements, seeing the fatigue beneath.Hawats rheumy old eyes glittered.His leathery skin appeared faintly yellow in the rooms light, and there was a wide, wet stain on the sleeve of his knife arm.She smelled blood there.Jessica gestured to one of the straight backed chairs, said: Bring that chair and sit facing me.Hawat bowed, obeyed.That drunken fool of an Idaho!he thought.He studied Jessicas face, wondering how he could save this situation.Its long past time to clear the air between us,Jessica said.What troubles my Lady?He sat down, placed hands on knees.Dont play coy with me!she snapped.If Yueh didnt tell you why I summoned you, then one of your spies in my household did.Shall we be at least that honest with each other?As you wish, my Lady.First, you will answer me one question, she said.Are you now a Harkonnen agent?Hawat surged half out of his chair, his face dark with fury, demanding: You dare insult me so?Sit down, she said.You insulted me so.Slowly, he sank back into the chair.And Jessica, reading the signs on this face that she knew so well, allowed herself a deep breath.It isnt Hawat.Now I know you remain loyal to my Duke, she said.Im prepared, therefore, to forgive your affront to me.Is there something to forgive?Jessica scowled, wondering: Shall I play my trump?Shall I tell him of the Dukes daughter Ive carried within me these few weeks?No  Leto himself doesnt know.This would only complicate his life, divert him in a time when he must concentrate on our survival.There is yet time to use this.A Truthsayer would solve this, she said, but we have no Truthsayer qualified by the High Board.As you say.Weve no Truthsayer.Is there a traitor among us?she asked.Ive studied our people with great care.Who could it be?Not Gurney.Certainly not Duncan.Their lieutenants are not strategically enough placed to consider.Its not you, Thufir.It cannot be Paul.I know its not me.Dr Yueh, then?Shall I call him in and put him to the test?You know thats an empty gesture, Hawat said.Hes conditioned by the High College.That I know for certain.Not to mention that his wife was a Bene Gesserit slain by the Harkonnens,Jessica said.So thats what happened to her, Hawat said.Havent you heard the hate in his voice when he speaks the Harkonnen name?You know I dont have the ear, Hawat said.What brought this base suspicion on me?she asked.Hawat frowned.My Lady puts her servant in an impossible position.My first loyalty is to the Duke.Im prepared to forgive much because of that loyalty, she said.And again I must ask: Is there something to forgive?Stalemate?she asked.He shrugged.Let us discuss something else for a minute, then, she said.Duncan Idaho, the admirable fighting man whose abilities at guarding and surveillance are so esteemed.Tonight, he overindulged in something called spice beer.I hear reports that others among our people have been stupefied by this concoction.Is that true?You have your reports, my Lady.So I do.Dont you see this drinking as a symptom, Thufir?My Lady speaks riddles.Apply your Mentat abilities to it!she snapped.Whats the problem with Duncan and the others?I can tell you in four words  they have no home.He jabbed a finger at the floor.Arrakis, thats their home.Arrakis is an unknown!Caladan was their home, but weve uprooted them.They have no home.And they fear the Dukes failing them.He stiffened.Such talk from one of the men would be cause for  Oh, stop that, Thufir.Is it defeatist or treacherous for a doctor to diagnose a disease correctly?My only intention is to cure the disease.The Duke gives me charge over such matters.But you understand I have a certain natural concern over the progress of this disease, she said.And perhaps youll grant I have certain abilities along these lines.Will I have to shock him severely?she wondered.He needs shaking up  something to break him from routine.There could be many interpretations for your concern, Hawat said.He shrugged.Then youve already convicted me?Of course not, my Lady.But I cannot afford to take any chances, the situation being what it is.A threat to my son got past you right here in this house, she said.Who took that chance?His face darkened.I offered my resignation to the Duke.Did you offer your resignation to me  or to Paul?Now he was openly angry, betraying it in quickness of breathing, in dilation of nostrils, a steady stare.She saw a pulse beating at his temple.Im the Dukes man, he said, biting off the words.There is no traitor, she said.The threats something else.Perhaps it has to do with the lasguns.Perhaps theyll risk secreting a few lasguns with timing mechanisms aimed at house shields.Perhaps theyll   And who could tell after the blast if the explosion wasnt atomic?he asked.No, my Lady.Theyll not risk anything that illegal.Radiation lingers.The evidence is hard to erase.No.Theyll observe most of the forms.It has to be a traitor.Youre the Dukes man, she sneered.Would you destroy him in the effort to save him?He took a deep breath, then: If youre innocent, youll have my most abject apologies.Look at you now, Thufir, she said.Humans live best when each has his own place, when each knows where he belongs in the scheme of things.Destroy the place and destroy the person.You and I, Thufir, of all those who love the Duke, are most ideally situated to destroy the others place.Could I not whisper suspicions about you into the Dukes ear at night?When would he be most susceptible to such whispering, Thufir?Must I draw it for you more clearly?You threaten me?he growled.Indeed not.I merely point out to you that someone is attacking us through the basic arrangement of our lives.Its clever, diabolical.I propose to negate this attack by so ordering our lives that therell be no chinks for such barbs to enter.You accuse me of whispering baseless suspicions?Baseless, yes.Youd meet this with your own whispers?Your life is compounded of whispers, not mine, Thufir.Then you question my abilities?She sighed.Thufir, I want you to examine your own emotional involvement in this.The natural humans an animal without logic.Your projection of logic onto all affairs is unnatural, but suffered to continue for its usefulness.Youre the embodiment of logic  a Mentat.Yet, your problem solutions are concepts that, in a very real sense, are projected outside yourself, there to be studied and rolled around, examined from all sides.You think now to teach me my trade?he asked, and he did not try to hide the disdain in his voice.Anything outside yourself, this you can see and apply your logic to it, she said.But its a human trait that when we encounter personal problems, those things most deeply personal are the most difficult to bring out for our logic to scan.We tend to flounder around, blaming everything but the actual, deep seated thing thats really chewing on us.Youre deliberately attempting to undermine my faith in my abilities as a Mentat, he rasped.Were I to find one of our people attempting thus to sabotage any other weapon in our arsenal, I should not hesitate to denounce and destroy him.The finest Mentats have a healthy respect for the error factor in their computations, she said.Ive never said otherwise!Then apply yourself to these symptoms weve both seen: drunkenness among the men, quarrels  they gossip and exchange wild rumors about Arrakis; they ignore the most simple  Idleness, no more, he said.Dont try to divert my attention by trying to make a simple matter appear mysterious.She stared at him, thinking of the Dukes men rubbing their woes together in the barracks until you could almost smell the charge there, like burnt insulation.Theyre becoming like the men of the pre Guild legend, she thought: Like the men of the lost star searcher, Ampoliros  sick at their guns forever seeking, forever prepared and forever unready.Why have you never made full use of my abilities in your service to the Duke?she asked.Do you fear a rival for your position?He glared at her, the old eyes blazing.I know some of the training they give you Bene Gesserit  He broke off, scowling.Go ahead, say it, she said.Bene Gesserit witches,  I know something of the real training they give you, he said.Ive seen it come out in Paul.Im not fooled by what your schools tell the public: you exist only to serve.The shock must be severe and hes almost ready for it, she thought.You listen respectfully to me in Council, she said, yet you seldom heed my advice.Why?I dont trust your Bene Gesserit motives, he said.You may think you can look through a man; you may think you can make a man do exactly what you  You poor fool, Thufir!she raged.He scowled, pushing himself back in the chair.Whatever rumors youve heard about our schools, she said, the truth is far greater.If I wished to destroy the Duke  or you, or any other person within my reach, you could not stop me.And she thought: Why do I let pride drive such words out of me?This is not the way I was trained.This is not how I must shock him.Hawat slipped a hand beneath his tunic where he kept a tiny projector of poison darts.She wears no shield, he thought.Is this just a brag she makes?I could slay her now  but, ah h h h, the consequences if Im wrong.Jessica saw the gesture toward his pocket, said: Let us pray violence shall never be necessary between us.A worthy prayer, he agreed.Meanwhile, the sickness spreads among us, she said.I must ask you again: Isnt it more reasonable to suppose the Harkonnens have planted this suspicion to pit the two of us against each other?We appear tove returned to stalemate, he said.She sighed, thinking: Hes almost ready for it.The Duke and I are father and mother surrogates to our people, she said.The position  He hasnt married you, Hawat said.She forced herself to calmness, thinking: A good riposte, that.But hell not marry anyone else, she said.Not as long as I live.And we are surrogates, as Ive said.To break up this natural order in our affairs, to disturb, disrupt, and confuse us  which target offers itself most enticingly to the Harkonnens?He sensed the direction she was taking, and his brows drew down in a lowering scowl.The Duke?she asked.Attractive target, yes, but no one with the possible exception of Paul is better guarded.Me?I tempt them, surely, but they must know the Bene Gesserit make difficult targets.And theres a better target, one whose duties create, necessarily, a monstrous blind spot.One to whom suspicion is as natural as breathing.One who builds his entire life on innuendo and mystery.She darted her right hand toward him.You!Hawat started to leap from his chair.I have not dismissed you, Thufir!she flared.The old Mentat almost fell back into the chair, so quickly did his muscles betray him.She smiled without mirth.Now you know something of the real training they give us, she said.Hawat tried to swallow in a dry throat.Her command had been regal, peremptory  uttered in a tone and manner he had found completely irresistible.His body had obeyed her before he could think about it.Nothing could have prevented his response  not logic, not passionate anger  nothing.To do what she had done spoke of a sensitive, intimate knowledge of the person thus commanded, a depth of control he had not dreamed possible.I have said to you before that we should understand each other, she said.I meant you should understand me.I already understand you.And I tell you now that your loyalty to the Duke is all that guarantees your safety with me.He stared at her, wet his lips with his tongue.If I desired a puppet, the Duke would marry me, she said.He might even think he did it of his own free will.Hawat lowered his head, looked upward through his sparse lashes.Only the most rigid control kept him from calling the guard.Control  and the suspicion now that the woman might not permit it.His skin crawled with the memory of how she had controlled him.In the moment of hesitation, she could have drawn a weapon and killed him!Does every human have this blind spot?he wondered.Can any of us be ordered into action before he can resist?The idea staggered him.Who could stop a person with such power?Youve glimpsed the fist within the Bene Gesserit glove, she said.Few glimpse it and live.And what I did was a relatively simple thing for us.Youve not seen my entire arsenal.Think on that.Why arent you out destroying the Dukes enemies?he asked.What would you have me destroy?she asked.Would you have me make a weakling of our Duke, have him forever leaning on me?But, with such power   Powers a two edged sword, Thufir, she said.You think: How easy for her to shape a human tool to thrust into an enemys vitals.True, Thufir; even into your vitals.Yet, what would I accomplish?If enough of us Bene Gesserit did this, wouldnt it make all Bene Gesserit suspect?We dont want that, Thufir.We do not wish to destroy ourselves.She nodded.We truly exist only to serve.I cannot answer you, he said.You know I cannot answer.Youll say nothing about what has happened here to anyone, she said.I know you, Thufir.My Lady  Again the old man tried to swallow in a dry throat.And he thought: She has great powers, yes.But would these not make her an even more formidable tool for the Harkonnens?The Duke could be destroyed as quickly by his friends as by his enemies, she said.I trust now youll get to the bottom of this suspicion and remove it.If it proves baseless, he said.If she sneered.If, he said.You are tenacious, she said.Cautious, he said, and aware of the error factor.Then Ill pose another question for you: What does it mean to you that you stand before another human, that you are bound and helpless and the other human holds a knife at your throat  yet this other human refrains from killing you, frees you from your bonds and gives you the knife to use as you will?She lifted herself out of the chair, turned her back on him.You may go now, Thufir.The old Mentat arose, hesitated, hand creeping toward the deadly weapon beneath his tunic.He was reminded of the bull ring and of the Dukes father (whod been brave, no matter what his other failings) and one day of the corrida long ago: The fierce black beast had stood there, head bowed, immobilized and confused.The Old Duke had turned his back on the horns, cape thrown flamboyantly over one arm, while cheers rained down from the stands.I am the bull and she the matador, Hawat thought.He withdrew his hand from the weapon, glanced at the sweat glistening in his empty palm.And he knew that whatever the facts proved to be in the end, he would never forget this moment nor lose this sense of supreme admiration for the Lady Jessica.Quietly, he turned and left the room.Jessica lowered her gaze from the reflection in the windows, turned, and stared at the closed door.Now well see some proper action, she whispered.Do you wrestle with dreams?Do you contend with shadows?Do you move in a kind of sleep?Time has slipped away.Your life is stolen.You tarried with trifles,  Victim of your folly.Dirge for Jamis on the Funeral Plain,  from Songs of MuadDib by the Princess Irulan    Leto stood in the foyer of his house, studying a note by the light of a single suspensor lamp.Dawn was yet a few hours away, and he felt his tiredness.A Fremen messenger had brought the note to the outer guard just now as the Duke arrived from his command post.The note read: A column of smoke by day, a pillar of fire by night.There was no signature.What does it mean?he wondered.The messenger had gone without waiting for an answer and before he could be questioned.He had slipped into the night like some smoky shadow.Leto pushed the paper into a tunic pocket, thinking to show it to Hawat later.He brushed a lock of hair from his forehead, took a sighing breath.The antifatigue pills were beginning to wear thin.It had been a long two days since the dinner party and longer than that since he had slept.On top of all the military problems, thered been the disquieting session with Hawat, the report on his meeting with Jessica.Should I waken Jessica?he wondered.Theres no reason to play the secrecy game with her any longer.Or is there?Blast and damn that Duncan Idaho!He shook his head.No, not Duncan.I was wrong not to take Jessica into my confidence from the first.I must do it now, before more damage is done.The decision made him feel better, and he hurried from the foyer through the Great Hall and down the passages toward the family wing.At the turn where the passages split to the service area, he paused.A strange mewling came from somewhere down the service passage.Leto put his left hand to the switch on his shield belt, slipped his kindjal into his right hand.The knife conveyed a sense of reassurance.That strange sound had sent a chill through him.Softly, the Duke moved down the service passage, cursing the inadequate illumination.The smallest of suspensors had been spaced about eight meters apart along here and tuned to their dimmest level.The dark stone walls swallowed the light.A dull blob stretching across the floor appeared out of the gloom ahead.Leto hesitated, almost activated his shield, but refrained because that would limit his movements, his hearing  and because the captured shipment of lasguns had left him filled with doubts.Silently, he moved toward the gray blob, saw that it was a human figure, a man face down on the stone.Leto turned him over with a foot, knife poised, bent close in the dim light to see the face.It was the smuggler, Tuek, a wet stain down his chest.The dead eyes stared with empty darkness.Leto touched the stain  warm.How could this man be dead here?Leto asked himself.Who killed him?The mewling sound was louder here.It came from ahead and down the side passage to the central room where they had installed the main shield generator for the house.Hand on belt switch, kindjal poised, the Duke skirted the body, slipped down the passage and peered around the corner toward the shield generator room.Another gray blob lay stretched on the floor a few paces away, and he saw at once this, was the source of the noise.The shape crawled toward him with painful slowness, gasping, mumbling.Leto stilled his sudden constriction of fear, darted down the passage, crouched beside the crawling figure.It was Mapes, the Fremen housekeeper, her hair tumbled around her face, clothing disarrayed.A dull shininess of dark stain spread from her back along her side.He touched her shoulder and she lifted herself on her elbows, head tipped up to peer at him, the eyes black shadowed emptiness.Syou, she gasped.Killed  guard  sent  get  Tuek  escape  mLady  you  you  here  no  She flopped forward, her head thumping against the stone.Leto felt for pulse at the temples.There was none.He looked at the stain: shed been stabbed in the back.Who?His mind raced.Did she mean someone had killed a guard?And Tuek  had Jessica sent for him?Why?He started to stand up.A sixth sense warned him.He flashed a hand toward the shield switch  too late.A numbing shock slammed his arm aside.He felt pain there, saw a dart protruding from the sleeve, sensed paralysis spreading from it up his arm.It took an agonizing effort to lift his head and look down the passage.Yueh stood in the open door of the generator room.His face reflected yellow from the light of a single, brighter suspensor above the door.There was stillness from the room behind him  no sound of generators.Yueh!Leto thought.Hes sabotaged the house generators!Were wide open!Yueh began walking toward him, pocketing a dartgun.Leto found he could still speak, gasped: Yueh!How?Then the paralysis reached his legs and he slid to the floor with his back propped against the stone wall.Yuehs face carried a look of sadness as he bent over, touched Letos forehead.The Duke found he could feel the touch, but it was remote  dull.The drug on the dart is selective, Yueh said.You can speak, but Id advise against it.He glanced down the hall, and again bent over Leto, pulled out the dart, tossed it aside.The sound of the dart clattering on the stones was faint and distant to the Dukes ears.It cant be Yueh, Leto thought.Hes conditioned.How?Leto whispered.Im sorry, my dear Duke, but there are things which will make greater demands than this.He touched the diamond tattoo on his forehead.I find it very strange, myself  an override on my pyretic conscience  but I wish to kill a man.Yes, I actually wish it.I will stop at nothing to do it.He looked down at the Duke.Oh, not you, my dear Duke.The Baron Harkonnen.I wish to kill the Baron.Bar  on Har   Be quiet, please, my poor Duke.You havent much time.That peg tooth I put in your mouth after the tumble at Narcal  that tooth must be replaced.In a moment, Ill render you unconscious and replace that tooth.He opened his hand, stared at something in it.An exact duplicate, its core shaped most exquisitely like a nerve.Itll escape the usual detectors, even a fast scanning.But if you bite down hard on it, the cover crushes.Then, when you expel your breath sharply, you fill the air around you with a poison gas  most deadly.Leto stared up at Yueh, seeing madness in the mans eyes, the perspiration along brow and chin.You were dead anyway, my poor Duke, Yueh said.But you will get close to the Baron before you die.Hell believe youre stupefied by drugs beyond any dying effort to attack him.And you will be drugged  and tied.But attack can take strange forms.And you will remember the tooth.The tooth, Duke Leto Atreides.You will remember the tooth.The old doctor leaned closer and closer until his face and drooping mustache dominated Letos narrowing vision.The tooth, Yueh muttered.Why?Leto whispered.Yueh lowered himself to one knee beside the Duke.I made a shaitans bargain with the Baron.And I must be certain he has fulfilled his half of it.When I see him, Ill know.When I look at the Baron, then I will know.But Ill never enter his presence without the price.Youre the price, my poor Duke.And Ill know when I see him.My poor Wanna taught me many things, and one is to see certainty of truth when the stress is great.I cannot do it always, but when I see the Baron  then, I will know.Leto tried to look down at the tooth in Yuehs hand.He felt this was happening in a nightmare  it could not be.Yuehs purple lips turned up in a grimace.Ill not get close enough to the Baron, or Id do this myself.No.Ill be detained at a safe distance.But you  ah, now!You, my lovely weapon!Hell want you close to him  to gloat over you, to boast a little.Leto found himself almost hypnotized by a muscle on the left side of Yuehs jaw.The muscle twisted when the man spoke.Yueh leaned closer.And you, my good Duke, my precious Duke, you must remember this tooth.He held it up between thumb and forefinger.It will be all that remains to you.Letos mouth moved without sound, then: Refuse.Ah h, no!You mustnt refuse.Because, in return for this small service, Im doing a thing for you.I will save your son and your woman.No other can do it.They can be removed to a place where no Harkonnen can reach them.How  save  them?Leto whispered.By making it appear theyre dead, by secreting them among people who draw knife at hearing the Harkonnen name, who hate the Harkonnens so much theyll burn a chair in which a Harkonnen has sat, salt the ground over which a Harkonnen has walked.He touched Letos jaw.Can you feel anything in your jaw?The Duke found that he could not answer.He sensed distant tugging, saw Yuehs hand come up with the ducal signet ring.For Paul, Yueh said.Youll be unconscious presently.Goodbye, my poor Duke.When we next meet well have no time for conversation.Cool remoteness spread upward from Letos jaw, across his cheeks.The shadowy hall narrowed to a pinpoint with Yuehs purple lips centered in it.Remember the tooth!Yueh hissed.The tooth!There should be a science of discontent.People need hard times and oppression to develop psychic muscles.from Collected Sayings of MuadDib by the Princess Irulan    Jessica awoke in the dark, feeling premonition in the stillness around her.She could not understand why her mind and body felt so sluggish.Skin raspings of fear ran along her nerves.She thought of sitting up and turning on a light, but something stayed the decision.Her mouth felt  strange.Lump lump lump lump!It was a dull sound, directionless in the dark.Somewhere.The waiting moment was packed with time, with rustling needle stick movements.She began to feel her body, grew aware of bindings on wrists and ankles, a gag in her mouth.She was on her side, hands tied behind her.She tested the bindings, realized they were krimskell fiber, would only claw tighter as she pulled.And now, she remembered.There had been movement in the darkness of her bedroom, something wet and pungent slapped against her face, filling her mouth, hands grasping for her.She had gasped  one indrawn breath  sensing the narcotic in the wetness.Consciousness had receded, sinking her into a black bin of terror.It has come, she thought.How simple it was to subdue the Bene Gesserit.All it took was treachery.Hawat was right.She forced herself not to pull on her bindings.This is not my bedroom, she thought.Theyve taken me someplace else.Slowly, she marshaled the inner calmness.She grew aware of the smell of her own stale sweat with its chemical infusion of fear.Where is Paul?she asked herself.My son  what have they done to him?Calmness.She forced herself to it, using the ancient routines.But terror remained so near.Leto?Where are you, Leto?She sensed a diminishing in the dark.It began with shadows.Dimensions separated, became new thorns of awareness.White.A line under a door.Im on the floor.People walking.She sensed it through the floor.Jessica squeezed back the memory of terror.I must remain calm, alert, and prepared.I may get only one chance.Again, she forced the inner calmness.The ungainly thumping of her heartbeats evened, shaping out time.She counted back.I was unconscious about an hour.She closed her eyes, focused her awareness onto the approaching footsteps.Four people.She counted the differences in their steps.I must pretend Im still unconscious.She relaxed against the cold floor, testing her bodys readiness, heard a door open, sensed increased light through her eyelids.Feet approached: someone standing over her.You are awake, rumbled a basso voice.Do not pretend.She opened her eyes.The Baron Vladimir Harkonnen stood over her.Around them, she recognized the cellar room where Paul had slept, saw his cot at one side  empty.Suspensor lamps were brought in by guards, distributed near the open door.There was a glare of light in the hallway beyond that hurt her eyes.She looked up at the Baron.He wore a yellow cape that bulged over his portable suspensors.The fat cheeks were two cherubic mounds beneath spider black eyes.The drug was timed, he rumbled.We knew to the minute when youd be coming out of it.How could that be?she wondered.Theyd have to know my exact weight, my metabolism, my  Yueh!Such a pity you must remain gagged, the Baron said.We could have such an interesting conversation.Yuehs the only one it could be, she thought.How?The Baron glanced behind him at the door.Come in, Piter.She had never before seen the man who entered to stand beside the Baron, but the face was known  and the man: Piter de Vries, the Mentat Assassin.She studied him  hawk features, blue ink eyes that suggested he was a native of Arrakis, but subtleties of movement and stance told her he was not.And his flesh was too well firmed with water.He was tall, though slender, and something about him suggested effeminacy.Such a pity we cannot have our conversation, my dear Lady Jessica, the Baron said.However, Im aware of your abilities.He glanced at the Mentat.Isnt that true, Piter?As you say, Baron, the man said.The voice was tenor.It touched her spine with a wash of coldness.She had never heard such a chill voice.To one with the Bene Gesserit training the voice screamed: Killer!I have a surprise for Piter, the Baron said.He thinks he has come here to collect his reward  you, Lady Jessica.But I wish to demonstrate a thing: that he does not really want you.You play with me, Baron?Piter asked, and he smiled.Seeing that smile, Jessica wondered that the Baron did not leap to defend himself from this Piter.Then she corrected herself.The Baron could not read that smile.He did not have the Training.In many ways, Piter is quite naive, the Baron said.He doesnt admit to himself what a deadly creature you are, Lady Jessica.Id show him, but itd be a foolish risk.The Baron smiled at Piter, whose face had become a waiting mask.I know what Piter really wants.Piter wants power.You promised I could have her, Piter said.The tenor voice had lost some of its cold reserve.Jessica heard the clue tones in the mans voice, allowed herself an inward shudder.How could the Baron have made such an animal out of a Mentat?I give you a choice, Piter, the Baron said.What choice?The Baron snapped fat fingers.This woman and exile from the Imperium, or the Duchy of Atreides on Arrakis to rule as you see fit in my name.Jessica watched the Barons spider eyes study Piter.You could be Duke here in all but name, the Baron said.Is my Leto dead, then?Jessica asked herself.She felt a silent wail begin somewhere in her mind.The Baron kept his attention on the Mentat.Understand yourself, Piter.You want her because she was a Dukes woman, a symbol of his power  beautiful, useful, exquisitely trained for her role.But an entire duchy, Piter!Thats more than a symbol; thats the reality.With it you could have many women  and more.You do not joke with Piter?The Baron turned with that dancing lightness the suspensors gave him.Joke?I?Remember  I am giving up the boy.You heard what the traitor said about the lads training.They are alike, this mother and son  deadly.The Baron smiled.I must go now.I will send in the guard Ive reserved for this moment.Hes stone deaf.His orders will be to convey you on the first leg of your journey into exile.He will subdue this woman if he sees her gain control of you.Hell not permit you to untie her gag until youre off Arrakis.If you choose not to leave  he has other orders.You dont have to leave, Piter said.Ive chosen.Ah, hah!the Baron chortled.Such quick decision can mean only one thing.I will take the duchy, Piter said.And Jessica thought: Doesnt Piter know the Barons lying to him?But  how could he know?Hes a twisted Mentat.The Baron glanced down at Jessica.Is it not wonderful that I know Piter so well?I wagered with my Master at Arms that this would be Piters choice.Hah!Well, I leave now.This is much better.Ah h, much better.You understand, Lady Jessica?I hold no rancor toward you.Its a necessity.Much better this way.Yes.And Ive not actually ordered you destroyed.When its asked of me what happened to you, I can shrug it off in all truth.You leave it to me then?Piter asked.The guard I send you will take your orders, the Baron said.Whatevers done I leave to you.He stared at Piter.Yes.There will be no blood on my hands here.Its your decision.Yes.I know nothing of it.You will wait until Ive gone before doing whatever you must do.Yes.Well  ah, yes.Yes.Good.He fears the questioning of a Truthsayer, Jessica thought.Who?Ah h h, the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen, of course!If he knows he must face her questions, then the Emperor is in on this for sure.Ah h h h, my poor Leto.With one last glance at Jessica, the Baron turned, went out the door.She followed him with her eyes, thinking: Its as the Reverend Mother warned  too potent an adversary.Two Harkonnen troopers entered.Another, his face a scarred mask, followed and stood in the doorway with drawn lasgun.The deaf one, Jessica thought, studying the scarred face.The Baron knows I could use the Voice on any other man.Scarface looked at Piter.Weve the boy on a litter outside.What are your orders?Piter spoke to Jessica.Id thought of binding you by a threat held over your son, but I begin to see that would not have worked.I let emotion cloud reason.Bad policy for a Mentat.He looked at the first pair of troopers, turning so the deaf one could read his lips: Take them into the desert as the traitor suggested for the boy.His plan is a good one.The worms will destroy all evidence.Their bodies must never be found.You dont wish to dispatch them yourself?Scarface asked.He reads lips, Jessica thought.I follow my Barons example, Piter said.Take them where the traitor said.Jessica heard the harsh Mentat control in Piters voice, thought: He, too, fears the Truthsayer.Piter shrugged, turned, and went through the doorway.He hesitated there, and Jessica thought he might turn back for a last look at her, but he went out without turning.Me, I wouldnt like the thought of facing that Truthsayer after this nights work, Scarface said.You aint likely ever to run into that old witch, one of the other troopers said.He went around to Jessicas head, bent over her.It aint getting our work done standing around here chattering.Take her feet and  Whynt we kill em here?Scarface asked.Too messy, the first one said.Unless you wants to strangle em.Me, I likes a nice straightforward job.Drop em on the desert like that traitor said, cut em once or twice, leave the evidence for the worms.Nothing to clean up afterward.Yeah  well, I guess youre right, Scarface said.Jessica listened to them, watching, registering.But the gag blocked her Voice, and there was the deaf one to consider.Scarface holstered his lasgun, took her feet.They lifted her like a sack of grain, maneuvered her through the door and dumped her onto a suspensor buoyed litter with another bound figure.As they turned her, fitting her to the litter, she saw her companions face  Paul!He was bound, but not gagged.His face was no more than ten centimeters from hers, eyes closed, his breathing even.Is he drugged?she wondered.The troopers lifted the litter, and Pauls eyes opened the smallest fraction  dark slits staring at her.He mustnt try the Voice!she prayed.The deaf guard!Pauls eyes closed.He had been practicing the awareness breathing, calming his mind, listening to their captors.The deaf one posed a problem, but Paul contained his despair.The mind calming Bene Gesserit regimen his mother had taught him kept him poised, ready to expand any opportunity.Paul allowed himself another slit eyed inspection of his mothers face.She appeared unharmed.Gagged, though.He wondered who couldve captured her.His own captivity was plain enough  to bed with a capsule prescribed by Yueh, awaking to find himself bound to this litter.Perhaps a similar thing had befallen her.Logic said the traitor was Yueh, but he held final decision in abeyance.There was no understanding it  a Suk doctor a traitor.The litter tipped slightly as the Harkonnen troopers maneuvered it through a doorway into starlit night.A suspensor buoy rasped against the doorway.Then they were on sand, feet grating in it.A thopter wing loomed overhead, blotting the stars.The litter settled to the ground.Pauls eyes adjusted to the faint light.He recognized the deaf trooper as the man who opened the thopter door, peered inside at the green gloom illuminated by the instrument panel.This the thopter were supposed to use?he asked, and turned to watch his companions lips.Its the one the traitor said was fixed for desert work, the other said.Scarface nodded.But its one of them little liaison jobs.Aint room in there for moren them an two of us.Twos enough, said the litter bearer, moving up close and presenting his lips for reading.We can take care of it from here on, Kinet.The Baron he told me to make sure what happened to them two, Scarface said.What you so worried about?asked another trooper from behind the litter bearer.She is a Bene Gesserit witch, the deaf one said.They have powers.Ah h h  The litter bearer made the sign of the fist at his ear.One of them, eh?Know whatcha mean.The trooper behind him grunted.Shell be worm meat soon enough.Dont suppose even a Bene Gesserit witch has powers over one of them big worms.Eh, Czigo?He nudged the litter bearer.Yee up, the litter bearer said.He returned to the litter, took Jessicas shoulders.Cmon, Kinet.You can go along if you wants to make sure what happens.It is nice of you to invite me, Czigo, Scarface said.Jessica felt herself lifted, the wing shadow spinning  stars.She was pushed into the rear of the thopter, her krimskell fiber bindings examined, and she was strapped down.Paul was jammed in beside her, strapped securely, and she noted his bonds were simple rope.Scarface, the deaf one they called Kinet, took his place in front.The litter bearer, the one they called Czigo, came around and took the other front seat.Kinet closed his door, bent to the controls.The thopter took off in a wing tucked surge, headed south over the Shield Wall.Czigo tapped his companions shoulder, said: Whynt you turn around and keep an eye on them two?Sure you know the way to go?Kinet watched Czigos lips.I listened to the traitor sames you.Kinet swiveled his seat.Jessica saw the glint of starlight on a lasgun in his hand.The thopters light walled interior seemed to collect illumination as her eyes adjusted, but the guards scarred face remained dim.Jessica tested her seat belt, found it loose.She felt roughness in the strap against her left arm, realized the strap had been almost severed, would snap at a sudden jerk.Has someone been at this thopter, preparing it for us?she wondered.Who?Slowly, she twisted her bound feet clear of Pauls.Sure do seem a shame to waste a good looking woman like this, Scarface said.You ever have any highborn types?He turned to look at the pilot.Bene Gesserit aint all highborn, the pilot said.But they all look heighty.He can see me plain enough, Jessica thought.She brought her bound legs up onto the seat, curled into a sinuous ball, staring at Scarface.Real pretty, she is, Kinet said.He wet his lips with his tongue.Sure do seem a shame.He looked at Czigo.You thinking what I think youre thinking?the pilot asked.Whod be to know?the guard asked.Afterward  He shrugged.I just never had me no highborns.Might never got a chance like this one again.You lay a hand on my mother  Paul grated.He glared at Scarface.Hey!the pilot laughed.Cubs got a bark.Aint got no bite, though.And Jessica thought: Pauls pitching his voice too high.It may work, though.They flew on in silence.These poor fools, Jessica thought, studying her guards and reviewing the Barons words.Theyll be killed as soon as they report success on their mission.The Baron wants no witnesses.The thopter banked over the southern rim of the Shield Wall, and Jessica saw a moonshadowed expanse of sand beneath them.This oughta be far enough, the pilot said.The traitor said to put em on the sand anywhere near the Shield Wall.He dipped the craft toward the dunes in a long, falling stoop, brought it up stiffly over the desert surface.Jessica saw Paul begin taking the rhythmic breaths of the calming exercise.He closed his eyes, opened them.Jessica stared, helpless to aid him.He hasnt mastered the Voice yet, she thought, if he fails   The thopter touched sand with a soft lurch, and Jessica, looking north back across the Shield Wall, saw a shadow of wings settle out of sight up there.Someones following us!she thought.Who!Then: The ones the Baron set to watch this pair.And therell be watchers for the watchers, too.Czigo shut off his wing rotors.Silence flooded in upon them.Jessica turned her head.She could see out the window beyond Scarface a dim glow of light from a rising moon, a frosted rim of rock rising from the desert.Sandblast ridges streaked its sides.Paul cleared his throat.The pilot said: Now, Kinet?I dunno, Czigo.Czigo turned, said: Ah h h, look.He reached out for Jessicas skirt.Remove her gag, Paul commanded.Jessica felt the words rolling in the air.The tone, the timbre excellent  imperative, very sharp.A slightly lower pitch would have been better, but it could still fall within this mans spectrum.Czigo shifted his hand up to the band around Jessicas mouth, slipped the knot on the gag.Stop that!Kinet ordered.Ah, shut your trap, Czigo said.Her handsre tied.He freed the knot and the binding dropped.His eyes glittered as he studied Jessica.Kinet put a hand on the pilots arm.Look, Czigo, no need to   Jessica twisted her neck, spat out the gag.She pitched her voice in low, intimate tones.Gentlemen!No need to fight over me.At the same time, she writhed sinuously for Kinets benefit.She saw them grow tense, knowing that in this instant they were convinced of the need to fight over her.Their disagreement required no other reason.In their minds, they were fighting over her.She held her face high in the instrument glow to be sure Kinet would read her lips, said: You mustnt disagree.They drew farther apart, glanced warily at each other.Is any woman worth fighting over?she asked.By uttering the words, by being there, she made herself infinitely worth their fighting.Paul clamped his lips tightly closed, forced himself to be silent.There had been the one chance for him to succeed with the Voice.Now  everything depended on his mother whose experience went so far beyond his own.Yeah, Scarface said.No need to fight over   His hand flashed toward the pilots neck.The blow was met by a splash of metal that caught the arm and in the same motion slammed into Kinets chest.Scarface groaned, sagged backward against the door.Thought I was some dummy didnt know that trick, Czigo said.He brought back his hand, revealing the knife.It glittered in reflected moonlight.Now for the cub, he said and leaned toward Paul.No need for that,Jessica murmured.Czigo hesitated.Wouldnt you rather have me cooperative?Jessica asked.Give the boy a chance.Her lip curled in a sneer.Little enough chance hed have out there in that sand.Give him that and  She smiled.You could find yourself well rewarded.Czigo glanced left, right, returned his attention to Jessica.Ive heard me what can happen to a man in this desert, he said.Boy might find the knife a kindness.Is it so much I ask?Jessica pleaded.Youre trying to trick me, Czigo muttered.I dont want to see my son die,Jessica said.Is that a trick?Czigo moved back, elbowed the door latch.He grabbed Paul, dragged him across the seat, pushed him half out the door and held the knife poised.Whatll y do, cub, if I cut yr bonds?Hell leave here immediately and head for those rocks, Jessica said.Is that what yll do, cub?Czigo asked.Pauls voice was properly surly.Yes.The knife moved down, slashed the bindings of his legs.Paul felt the hand on his back to hurl him down onto the sand, feigned a lurch against the door frame for purchase, turned as though to catch himself, lashed out with his right foot.The toe was aimed with a precision that did credit to his long years of training, as though all of that training focused on this instant.Almost every muscle of his body cooperated in the placement of it.The tip struck the soft part of Czigos abdomen just below the sternum, slammed upward with terrible force over the liver and through the diaphragm to crush the right ventricle of the mans heart.With one gurgling scream, the guard jerked backward across the seats.Paul, unable to use his hands, continued his tumble onto the sand, landing with a roll that took up the force and brought him back to his feet in one motion.He drove back into the cabin, found the knife and held it in his teeth while his mother sawed her bonds.She took the blade and freed his hands.I couldve handled him, she said.Hed have had to cut my bindings.That was a foolish risk.I saw the opening and used it, he said.She heard the harsh control in his voice, said: Yuehs house sign is scrawled on the ceiling of this cabin.He looked up, saw the curling symbol.Get out and let us study the craft, she said.Theres a bundle under the pilots seat.I felt it when we got in.Bomb?Doubt it.Theres something peculiar here.Paul leaped out to the sand and Jessica followed.She turned, reached under the seat for the strange bundle, seeing Czigos feet close to her face, feeling dampness on the bundle as she removed it, realizing the dampness was the pilots blood.Waste of moisture, she thought, knowing that this was Arrakeen thinking.Paul stared around them, saw the rock scarp lifting out of the desert like a beach rising from the sea, wind carved palisades beyond.He turned back as his mother lifted the bundle from the thopter, saw her stare across the dunes toward the Shield Wall.He looked to see what drew her attention, saw another thopter swooping toward them, realized theyd not have time to clear the bodies out of this thopter and escape.Run, Paul!Jessica shouted.Its Harkonnens!Arrakis teaches the attitude of the knife  chopping off whats incomplete and saying: Now, its complete because its ended here.from Collected Sayings of MuadDib by the Princess Irulan    A man in Harkonnen uniform skidded to a stop at the end of the hall, stared in at Yueh, taking in at a single glance Mapes body, the sprawled form of the Duke, Yueh standing there.The man held a lasgun in his right hand.There was a casual air of brutality about him, a sense of toughness and poise that sent a shiver through Yueh.Sardaukar, Yueh thought.A Bashar by the look of him.Probably one of the Emperors own sent here to keep an eye on things.No matter what the uniform, theres no disguising them.Youre Yueh, the man said.He looked speculatively at the Suk School ring on the Doctors hair, stared once at the diamond tattoo and then met Yuehs eyes.I am Yueh, the Doctor said.You can relax, Yueh, the man said.When you dropped the house shields we came right in.Everythings under control here.Is this the Duke?This is the Duke.Dead?Merely unconscious.I suggest you tie him.Did you do for these others?He glanced back down the hall where Mapes body lay.Mores the pity, Yueh muttered.Pity!the Sardaukar sneered.He advanced, looked down at Leto.So thats the great Red Duke.If I had doubts about what this man is, that would end them, Yueh thought.Only the Emperor calls the Atreides the Red Dukes.The Sardaukar reached down, cut the red hawk insignia from Letos uniform.Little souvenir, he said.Wheres the ducal signet ring?He doesnt have it on him, Yueh said.I can see that!the Sardaukar snapped.Yueh stiffened, swallowed.If they press me, bring in a Truthsayer, theyll find out about the ring, about the thopter I prepared  all will fail.Sometimes the Duke sent the ring with a messenger as surety that an order came directly from him, Yueh said.Must be damned trusted messengers, the Sardaukar muttered.Arent you going to tie him?Yueh ventured.How longll he be unconscious?Two hours or so.I wasnt as precise with his dosage as I was for the woman and boy.The Sardaukar spurned the Duke with his toe.This was nothing to fear even when awake.When will the woman and boy awaken?About ten minutes.So soon?I was told the Baron would arrive immediately behind his men.So he will.Youll wait outside, Yueh.He shot a hard glance at Yueh.Now!Yueh glanced at Leto.What about   Hell be delivered all properly trussed like a roast for the oven.Again, the Sardaukar looked at the diamond tattoo on Yuehs forehead.Youre known; youll be safe enough in the halls.Weve no more time for chit chat, traitor.I hear the others coming.Traitor, Yueh thought.He lowered his gaze, pressed past the Sardaukar, knowing this as a foretaste of how history would remember him: Yueh the traitor.He passed more bodies on his way to the front entrance and glanced at them, fearful that one might be Paul or Jessica.All were house troopers or wore Harkonnen uniform.Harkonnen guards came alert, staring at him as he emerged from the front entrance into flame lighted night.The palms along the road had been fired to illuminate the house.Black smoke from the flammables used to ignite the trees poured upward through orange flames.Its the traitor, someone said.The Baron will want to see you soon, another said.I must get to the thopter, Yueh thought.I must put the ducal signet where Paul will find it.And fear struck him: If Idaho suspects me or grows impatient  if he doesnt wait and go exactly where I told him  Jessica and Paul will not be saved from the carnage.Ill be denied even the smallest relief from my act.The Harkonnen guard released his arm, said: Wait over there out of the way.Abruptly, Yueh saw himself as cast away in this place of destruction, spared nothing, given not the smallest pity.Idaho must not fail!Another guard bumped into him, barked: Stay out of the way, you!Even when theyve profited by me they despise me, Yueh thought.He straightened himself as he was pushed aside, regained some of his dignity.Wait for the Baron!a guard officer snarled.Yueh nodded, walked with controlled casualness along the front of the house, turned the corner into shadows out of sight of the burning palms.Quickly, every step betraying his anxiety, Yueh made for the rear yard beneath the conservatory where the thopter waited  the craft they had placed there to carry away Paul and his mother.A guard stood at the open rear door of the house, his attention focused on the lighted hall and men banging through there, searching from room to room.How confident they were!Yueh hugged the shadows, worked his way around the thopter, eased open the door on the side away from the guard.He felt under the front seats for the Fremkit he had hidden there, lifted a flap and slipped in the ducal signet.He felt the crinkling of the spice paper there, the note he had written, pressed the ring into the paper.He removed his hand, resealed the pack.Softly, Yueh closed the thopter door, worked his way back to the corner of the house and around toward the flaming trees.Now, it is done, he thought.Once more, he emerged into the light of the blazing palms.He pulled his cloak around him, stared at the flames.Soon I will know.Soon I will see the Baron and I will know.And the Baron  he will encounter a small tooth.There is a legend that the instant the Duke Leto Atreides died a meteor streaked across the skies above his ancestral palace on Caladan.from Introduction to A Childs History of MuadDib by the Princess Irulan    The Baron Vladimir Harkonnen stood at a viewport of the grounded lighter he was using as a command post.Out the port he saw the flame lighted night of Arrakeen.His attention focused on the distant Shield Wall where his secret weapon was doing its work.Explosive artillery.The guns nibbled at the caves where the Dukes fighting men had retreated for a last ditch stand.Slowly measured bites of orange glare, showers of rock and dust in the brief illumination  and the Dukes men were being sealed off to die by starvation, caught like animals in their burrows.The Baron could feel the distant chomping  a drumbeat carried to him through the ships metal: broomp  broomp.Then: BROOMP broomp!Who would think of reviving artillery in this day of shields?The thought was a chuckle in his mind.But it was predictable the Dukes men would run for those caves.And the Emperor will appreciate my cleverness in preserving the lives of our mutual force.He adjusted one of the little suspensors that guarded his fat body against the pull of gravity.A smile creased his mouth, pulled at the lines of his jowls.A pity to waste such fighting men as the Dukes, he thought.He smiled more broadly, laughing at himself.Pity should be cruel!He nodded.Failure was, by definition, expendable.The whole universe sat there, open to the man who could make the right decisions.The uncertain rabbits had to be exposed, made to run for their burrows.Else how could you control them and breed them?He pictured his fighting men as bees routing the rabbits.And he thought: The day hums sweetly when you have enough bees working for you.A door opened behind him.The Baron studied the reflection in the night blackened viewport before turning.Piter de Vries advanced into the chamber followed by Umman Kudu, the captain of the Barons personal guard.There was a motion of men just outside the door, the mutton faces of his guard, their expressions carefully sheeplike in his presence.The Baron turned.Piter touched finger to forelock in his mocking salute.Good news, mLord.The Sardaukar have brought in the Duke.Of course they have, the Baron rumbled.He studied the somber mask of villainy on Piters effeminate face.And the eyes: those shaded slits of bluest blue in blue.Soon I must remove him, the Baron thought.He has almost outlasted his usefulness, almost reached the point of positive danger to my person.First, though, he must make the people of Arrakis hate him.Then  they will welcome my darling Feyd Rautha as a savior.The Baron shifted his attention to the guard captain  Umman Kudu: scissors line of jaw muscles, chin like a boot toe  a man to be trusted because the captains vices were known.First, where is the traitor who gave me the Duke?the Baron asked.I must give the traitor his reward.Piter turned on one toe, motioned to the guard outside.A bit of black movement there and Yueh walked through.His motions were stiff and stringy.The mustache drooped beside his purple lips.Only the old eyes seemed alive.Yueh came to a stop three paces into the room, obeying a motion from Piter, and stood there staring across the open space at the Baron.Ah h h, Dr Yueh.MLord Harkonnen.Youve given us the Duke, I hear.My half of the bargain, mLord.The Baron looked at Piter.Piter nodded.The Baron looked back at Yueh.The letter of the bargain, eh?And I  He spat the words out: What was I to do in return?You remember quite well, mLord Harkonnen.And Yueh allowed himself to think now, hearing the loud silence of clocks in his mind.He had seen the subtle betrayals in the Barons manner.Wanna was indeed dead  gone far beyond their reach.Otherwise, thered still be a hold on the weak doctor.The Barons manner showed there was no hold; it was ended.Do I?the Baron asked.You promised to deliver my Wanna from her agony.The Baron nodded.Oh, yes.Now, I remember.So I did.That was my promise.That was how we bent the Imperial Conditioning.You couldnt endure seeing your Bene Gesserit witch grovel in Piters pain amplifiers.Well, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen always keeps his promises.I told you Id free her from the agony and permit you to join her.So be it.He waved a hand at Piter.Piters blue eyes took on a glazed look.His movement was catlike in its sudden fluidity.The knife in his hand glistened like a claw as it flashed into Yuehs back.The old man stiffened, never taking his attention from the Baron.So join her!the Baron spat.Yueh stood, swaying.His lips moved with careful precision, and his voice came in oddly measured cadence: You  think  you  de  feated  me.You  think  I  did  not  know  what  I  bought  for  my  Wanna.He toppled.No bending or softening.It was like a tree falling.So join her, the Baron repeated.But his words were like a weak echo.Yueh had filled him with a sense of foreboding.He whipped his attention to Piter, watched the man wipe the blade on a scrap of cloth, watched the creamy look of satisfaction in the blue eyes.So thats how he kills by his own hand, the Baron thought.Its well to know.He did give us the Duke?the Baron asked.Of a certainty, my Lord, Piter said.Then get him in here!Piter glanced at the guard captain, who whirled to obey.The Baron looked down at Yueh.From the way the man had fallen, you could suspect oak in him instead of bones.I never could bring myself to trust a traitor, the Baron said.Not even a traitor I created.He glanced at the night shrouded viewport.That black bag of stillness out there was his, the Baron knew.There was no more crump of artillery against the Shield Wall caves; the burrow traps were sealed off.Quite suddenly, the Barons mind could conceive of nothing more beautiful than that utter emptiness of black.Unless it were white on the black.Plated white on the black.Porcelain white.But there was still the feeling of doubt.What had the old fool of a doctor meant?Of course, hed probably known what would happen to him in the end.But that bit about thinking hed been defeated: You think you defeated me.What had he meant?The Duke Leto Atreides came through the door.His arms were bound in chains, the eagle face streaked with dirt.His uniform was torn where someone had ripped off his insignia.There were tatters at his waist where the shield belt had been removed without first freeing the uniform ties.The Dukes eyes held a glazed insane look.Wel l l l, the Baron said.He hesitated, drawing in a deep breath.He knew he had spoken too loudly.This moment, long envisioned, had lost some of its savor.Damn that cursed doctor through all eternity!I believe the good Duke is drugged, Piter said.Thats how Yueh caught him for us.Piter turned to the Duke.Arent you drugged, my dear Duke?The voice was far away.Leto could feel the chains, the ache of muscles, his cracked lips, his burning cheeks, the dry taste of thirst whispering its grit in his mouth.But sounds were dull, hidden by a cottony blanket.And he saw only dim shapes through the blanket.What of the woman and the boy, Piter?the Baron asked.Any word yet?Piters tongue darted over his lips.Youve heard something!the Baron snapped.What?Piter glanced at the guard captain, back to the Baron.The men who were sent to do the job, mLord  theyve  ah  been  ah  found.Well, they report everything satisfactory?Theyre dead, mLord.Of course they are!What I want to know is  They were dead when found, mLord.The Barons face went livid.And the woman and boy?No sign, mLord, but there was a worm.It came while the scene was being investigated.Perhaps its as we wished  an accident.Possibly  We do not deal in possibilities, Piter.What of the missing thopter?Does that suggest anything to my Mentat?One of the Dukes men obviously escaped in it, mLord.Killed our pilot and escaped.Which of the Dukes men?It was a clean, silent killing, mLord.Hawat, perhaps, or that Halleck one.Possibly Idaho.Or any top lieutenant.Possibilities, the Baron muttered.He glanced at the swaying, drugged figure of the Duke.The situation is in hand, mLord, Piter said.No, it isnt!Where is that stupid planetologist?Where is this man Kynes?Weve word where to find him and hes been sent for, mLord.I dont like the way the Emperors servant is helping us, the Baron muttered.They were words through a cottony blanket, but some of them burned in Letos mind.Woman and boy  no sign.Paul and Jessica had escaped.And the fate of Hawat, Halleck, and Idaho remained an unknown.There was still hope.Where is the ducal signet ring?the Baron demanded.His finger is bare.The Sardaukar say it was not on him when he was taken, my Lord, the guard captain said.You killed the doctor too soon, the Baron said.That was a mistake.You shouldve warned me, Piter.You moved too precipitately for the good of our enterprise.He scowled.Possibilities!The thought hung like a sine wave in Letos mind: Paul and Jessica have escaped!And there was something else in his memory: a bargain.He could almost remember it.The tooth!He remembered part of it now: a pill of poison gas shaped into a false tooth.Someone had told him to remember the tooth.The tooth was in his mouth.He could feel its shape with his tongue.All he had to do was bite sharply on it.Not yet!The someone had told him to wait until he was near the Baron.Who had told him?He couldnt remember.How long will he remain drugged like this?the Baron asked.Perhaps another hour, mLord.Perhaps, the Baron muttered.Again, he turned to the night blackened window.I am hungry.Thats the Baron, that fuzzy gray shape there, Leto thought.The shape danced back and forth, swaying with the movement of the room.And the room expanded and contracted.It grew brighter and darker.It folded into blackness and faded.Time became a sequence of layers for the Duke.He drifted up through them.I must wait.There was a table.Leto saw the table quite clearly.And a gross, fat man on the other side of the table, the remains of a meal in front of him.Leto felt himself sitting in a chair across from the fat man, felt the chains, the straps that held his tingling body in the chair.He was aware there had been a passage of time, but its length escaped him.I believe hes coming around, Baron.A silky voice, that one.That was Piter.So I see, Piter.A rumbling basso: the Baron.Leto sensed increasing definition in his surroundings.The chair beneath him took on firmness, the bindings were sharper.And he saw the Baron clearly now.Leto watched the movements of the mans hands: compulsive touchings  the edge of a plate, the handle of a spoon, a finger tracing the fold of a jowl.Leto watched the moving hand, fascinated by it.You can hear me, Duke Leto, the Baron said.I know you can hear me.We want to know from you where to find your concubine and the child you sired on her.No sign escaped Leto, but the words were a wash of calmness through him.Its true, then: they dont have Paul and Jessica.This is not a childs game we play, the Baron rumbled.You must know that.He leaned toward Leto, studying the face.It pained the Baron that this could not be handled privately, just between the two of them.To have others see royalty in such straits  it set a bad precedent.Leto could feel strength returning.And now, the memory of the false tooth stood out in his mind like a steeple in a flat landscape.The nerve shaped capsule within that tooth  the poison gas  he remembered who had put the deadly weapon in his mouth.Yueh.Drug fogged memory of seeing a limp corpse dragged past him in this room hung like a vapor in Letos mind.He knew it had been Yueh.Do you hear that noise, Duke Leto?the Baron asked.Leto grew conscious of a frog sound, the burred mewling of someones agony.We caught one of your men disguised as a Fremen, the Baron said.We penetrated the disguise quite easily: the eyes, you know.He insists he was sent among the Fremen to spy on them.Ive lived for a time on this planet, cher cousin.One does not spy on those ragged scum of the desert.Tell me, did you buy their help?Did you send your woman and son to them?Leto felt fear tighten his chest.If Yueh sent them to the desert folk  the search wont stop until theyre found.Come, come, the Baron said.We dont have much time and pain is quick.Please dont bring it to this, my dear Duke.The Baron looked up at Piter who stood at Letos shoulder.Piter doesnt have all his tools here, but Im sure he could improvise.Improvisation is sometimes the best, Baron.That silky, insinuating voice!Leto heard it at his ear.You had an emergency plan, the Baron said.Where have your woman and the boy been sent?He looked at Letos hand.Your ring is missing.Does the boy have it?The Baron looked up, stared into Letos eyes.You dont answer, he said.Will you force me to do a thing I do not want to do?Piter will use simple, direct methods.I agree theyre sometimes the best, but its not good that you should be subjected to such things.Hot tallow on the back, perhaps, or on the eyelids, Piter said.Perhaps on other portions of the body.Its especially effective when the subject doesnt know where the tallow will fall next.Its a good method and theres a sort of beauty in the pattern of pus white blisters on naked skin, eh, Baron?Exquisite, the Baron said, and his voice sounded sour.Those touching fingers!Leto watched the fat hands, the glittering jewels on baby fat hands  their compulsive wandering.The sounds of agony coming through the door behind him gnawed at the Dukes nerves.Who is it they caught?he wondered.Could it have been Idaho?Believe me, cher cousin, the Baron said.I do not want it to come to this.You think of nerve couriers racing to summon help that cannot come, Piter said.Theres artistry in this, you know.Youre a superb artist, the Baron growled.Now, have the decency to be silent.Leto suddenly recalled a thing Gurney Halleck had said once, seeing a picture of the Baron:  And I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea  and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.We waste time, Baron, Piter said.Perhaps.The Baron nodded.You know, my dear Leto, youll tell us in the end where they are.Theres a level of pain thatll buy you.Hes most likely correct, Leto thought.Were it not for the tooth  and the fact that I truly dont know where they are.The Baron picked up a sliver of meat, pressed the morsel into his mouth, chewed slowly, swallowed.We must try a new tack, he thought.Observe this prize person who denies hes for hire, the Baron said.Observe him, Piter.And the Baron thought: Yes!See him there, this man who believes he cannot be bought.See him detained there by a million shares of himself sold in dribbles every second of his life!If you took him up now and shook him, hed rattle inside.Emptied!Sold out!What difference how he dies now?The frog sounds in the background stopped.The Baron saw Umman Kudu, the guard captain, appear in the doorway across the room, shake his head.The captive hadnt produced the needed information.Another failure.Time to quit stalling with this fool Duke, this stupid soft fool who didnt realize how much hell there was so near him  only a nerves thickness away.This thought calmed the Baron, overcoming his reluctance to have a royal person subjected to pain.He saw himself suddenly as a surgeon exercising endless supple scissor dissections  cutting away the masks from fools, exposing the hell beneath.Rabbits, all of them!And how they cowered when they saw the carnivore!Leto stared across the table, wondering why he waited.The tooth would end it all quickly.Still  it had been good, much of this life.He found himself remembering an antenna kite up dangling in the shell blue sky of Caladan, and Paul laughing with joy at the sight of it.And he remembered sunrise here on Arrakis  colored strata of the Shield Wall mellowed by dust haze.Too bad, the Baron muttered.He pushed himself back from the table, stood up lightly in his suspensors and hesitated, seeing a change come over the Duke.He saw the man draw in a deep breath, the jawline stiffen, the ripple of a muscle there as the Duke clamped his mouth shut.How he fears me!the Baron thought.Shocked by fear that the Baron might escape him, Leto bit hard on the capsule tooth, felt it break.He opened his mouth, expelled the biting vapor he could taste as it formed on his tongue.The Baron grew smaller, a figure seen in a tightening tunnel.Leto heard a gasp beside his ear  the silky voiced one: Piter.It got him, too!Piter!Whats wrong?The rumbling voice was far away.Leto sensed memories rolling in his mind  the old toothless mutterings of hags.The room, the table, the Baron, a pair of terrified eyes  blue within blue, the eyes  all compressed around him in ruined symmetry.There was a man with a boot toe chin, a toy man falling.The toy man had a broken nose slanted to the left: an offbeat metronome caught forever at the start of an upward stroke.Leto heard the crash of crockery  so distant  a roaring in his ears.His mind was a bin without end, catching everything.Everything that had ever been: every shout, every whisper, every  silence.One thought remained to him.Leto saw it in formless light on rays of black: The day the flesh shapes and the flesh the day shapes.The thought struck him with a sense of fullness he knew he could never explain.Silence.The Baron stood with his back against his private door, his own bolt hole behind the table.He had slammed it on a room full of dead men.His senses took in guards swarming around him.Did I breathe it?he asked himself.Whatever it was in there, did it get me, too?Sounds returned to him  and reason.He heard someone shouting orders  gas masks  keep a door closed  get blowers going.The others fell quickly, he thought.Im still standing.Im still breathing.Merciless hell!That was close!He could analyze it now.His shield had been activated, set low but still enough to slow molecular interchange across the field barrier.And he had been pushing himself away from the table  that and Piters shocked gasp which had brought the guard captain darting forward into his own doom.Chance and the warning in a dying mans gasp  these had saved him.The Baron felt no gratitude to Piter.The fool had got himself killed.And that stupid guard captain!Hed said he scoped everyone before bringing them into the Barons presence!How had it been possible for the Duke  ?No warning.Not even from the poison snooper over the table  until it was too late.How?Well, no matter now, the Baron thought, his mind firming.The next guard captain will begin by finding answers to these questions.He grew aware of more activity down the hall  around the corner at the other door to that room of death.The Baron pushed himself away from his own door, studied the lackeys around him.They stood there staring, silent, waiting for the Barons reaction.Would the Baron be angry?And the Baron realized only a few seconds had passed since his flight from that terrible room.Some of the guards had weapons leveled at the door.Some were directing their ferocity toward the empty hall that stretched away toward the noises around the corner to their right.A man came striding around that corner, gas mask dangling by its straps at his neck, his eyes intent on the overhead poison snoopers that lined this corridor.He was yellow haired, flat of face with green eyes.Crisp lines radiated from his thick lipped mouth.He looked like some water creature misplaced among those who walked the land.The Baron stared at the approaching man, recalling the name: Nefud.Iakin Nefud.Guard corporal.Nefud was addicted to semuta, the drug music combination that played itself in the deepest consciousness.A useful item of information, that.The man stopped in front of the Baron, saluted.Corridors clear, mLord.I was outside watching and saw that it must be poison gas.Ventilators in your room were pulling air in from these corridors.He glanced up at the snooper over the Barons head.None of the stuff escaped.We have the room cleaned out now.What are your orders?The Baron recognized the mans voice  the one whod been shouting orders.Efficient, this corporal, he thought.Theyre all dead in there?the Baron asked.Yes, mLord.Well, we must adjust, the Baron thought.First, he said, let me congratulate you, Nefud.Youre the new captain of my guard.And I hope youll take to heart the lesson to be learned from the fate of your predecessor.The Baron watched the awareness grow in his newly promoted guardsman.Nefud knew hed never again be without his semuta.Nefud nodded.My Lord knows Ill devote myself entirely to his safety.Yes.Well, to business.I suspect the Duke had something in his mouth.You will find out what that something was, how it was used, who helped him put it there.Youll take every precaution  He broke off, his chain of thought shattered by a disturbance in the corridor behind him  guards at the door to the lift from the lower levels of the frigate trying to hold back a tall colonel bashar who had just emerged from the lift.The Baron couldnt place the colonel bashars face: thin with mouth like a slash in leather, twin ink spots for eyes.Get your hands off me, you pack of carrion eaters!the man roared, and he dashed the guards aside.Ak h h, one of the Sardaukar, the Baron thought.The colonel bashar came striding toward the Baron, whose eyes went to slits of apprehension.The Sardaukar officers filled him with unease.They all seemed to look like relatives of the Duke  the late Duke.And their manners with the Baron!The colonel bashar planted himself half a pace in front of the Baron, hands on hips.The guard hovered behind him in twitching uncertainty.The Baron noted the absence of salute, the disdain in the Sardaukars manner, and his unease grew.There was only the one legion of them locally  ten brigades  reinforcing the Harkonnen legions, but the Baron did not fool himself.That one legion was perfectly capable of turning on the Harkonnens and overcoming them.Tell your men they are not to prevent me from seeing you, Baron, the Sardaukar growled.My men brought you the Atreides Duke before I could discuss his fate with you.We will discuss it now.I must not lose face before my men, the Baron thought.So?It was a coldly controlled word, and the Baron felt proud of it.My Emperor has charged me to make certain his royal cousin dies cleanly without agony, the colonel bashar said.Such were the Imperial orders to me, the Baron lied.Did you think Id disobey?Im to report to my Emperor what I see with my own eyes, the Sardaukar said.The Dukes already dead, the Baron snapped, and he waved a hand to dismiss the fellow.The colonel bashar remained planted facing the Baron.Not by flicker of eye or muscle did he acknowledge he had been dismissed, How?he growled.Really!the Baron thought.This is too much.By his own hand, if you must know, the Baron said.He took poison.I will see the body now, the colonel bashar said.The Baron raised his gaze to the ceiling in feigned exasperation while his thoughts raced.Damnation!This sharp eyed Sardaukar will see the room before a things been changed!Now, the Sardaukar growled.Ill see it with my own eyes.There was no preventing it, the Baron realized.The Sardaukar would see all.Hed know the Duke had killed Harkonnen men  that the Baron most likely had escaped by a narrow margin.There was the evidence of the dinner remnants on the table, and the dead Duke across from it with destruction around him.No preventing it at all.Ill not be put off, the colonel bashar snarled.Youre not being put off, the Baron said, and he stared into the Sardaukars obsidian eyes.I hide nothing from my Emperor.He nodded to Nefud.The colonel bashar is to see everything, at once.Take him in by the door where you stood, Nefud.This way, sir, Nefud said.Slowly, insolently, the Sardaukar moved around the Baron, shouldered a way through the guardsmen.Insufferable, the Baron thought.Now, the Emperor will know how I slipped up.Hell recognize it as a sign of weakness.And it was agonizing to realize that the Emperor and his Sardaukar were alike in their disdain for weakness.The Baron chewed at his lower lip, consoling himself that the Emperor, at least, had not learned of the Atreides raid on Giedi Prime, the destruction of the Harkonnen spice stores there.Damn that slippery Duke!The Baron watched the retreating backs  the arrogant Sardaukar and the stocky, efficient Nefud.We must adjust, the Baron thought.Ill have to put Rabban over this damnable planet once more.Without restraint.I must spend my own Harkonnen blood to put Arrakis into a proper condition for accepting Feyd Rautha.Damn that Piter!He would get himself killed before I was through with him.The Baron sighed.And I must send at once to Tleilax for a new Mentat.They undoubtedly have the new one ready for me by now.One of the guardsmen beside him coughed.The Baron turned toward the man.I am hungry.Yes, mLord.And I wish to be diverted while youre clearing out that room and studying its secrets for me, the Baron rumbled.The guardsman lowered his eyes.
