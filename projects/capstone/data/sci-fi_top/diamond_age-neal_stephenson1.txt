   By nature, men are nearly alike; by practice, they get to be wide apart.Confucius  Moral reforms and deteriorations are moved by large forces, and they are mostly caused by reactions from the habits of a preceding period.Backwards and forwards swings the great pendulum, and its alternations are not determined by a few distinguished folk clinging to the end of it.Sir Charles Petrie, THE VICTORIANS      A thete visits a mod parlor;  noteworthy features of modern armaments.The bells of St.Mark's were ringing changes up on the mountain when Bud skated over to the mod parlor to upgrade his skull gun.Bud had a nice new pair of blades with a top speed of anywhere from a hundred to a hundred and fifty kilometers, depending on how fat you were and whether or not you wore aero.Bud liked wearing skin tight leather, to show off his muscles.On a previous visit to the mod parlor, two years ago, he had paid to have a bunch of 'sites implanted in his muscles little critters; too small to see or feel, that twitched Bud's muscle fibers electrically according to a program that was supposed to maximize bulk.Combined with the testosterone pump embedded in his forearm, it was like working out in a gym night and day, except you didn't have to actually do anything and you never got sweaty.The only drawback was that all the little twitches made him kind of tense and jerky.He'd gotten used to it, but it still made him a little hinky on those skates, especially when he was doing a hundred clicks an hour through a crowded street.But few people hassled Bud, even when he knocked them down in the street, and after today no one would hassle him ever again.Bud had walked away, improbably unscratched, from his last job decoy  with something like a thousand yuks in his pocket.He'd spent a third of it on new clothes, mostly black leather, another third of it on the blades, and was about to spend the last third at the mod parlor.You could get skull guns a lot cheaper, of course, but that would mean going over the Causeway to Shanghai and getting a back alley job from some Coaster, and probably a nice bone infection in with the bargain, and he'd probably pick your pocket while he had you theezed.Besides, you could only get into a Shanghai if you were virgin.To cross the Causeway when you were already packing a skull gun, like Bud, you had to bribe the shit out of numerous Shanghai cops.There was no reason to economize here.Bud had a rich and boundless career ahead of him, vaulting up a hierarchy of extremely dangerous drug related occupations for which decoy served as a paid audition of sorts.A start weapons system was a wise investment.The damn bells kept ringing through the fog.Bud mumbled a command to his music system, a phased acoustical array splayed across both eardrums like the seeds on a strawberry.The volume went up but couldn't scour away the deep tones of the carillon, which resonated in his long bones.He wondered whether, as long as he was at the mod parlor, he should have the batteries drilled out of his right mastoid and replaced.Supposedly they were ten year jobs, but he'd had them for six and he listened to music all the time, loud.Three people were waiting.Bud took a seat and skimmed a mediatron from the coffee table; it looked exactly like a dirty, wrinkled, blank sheet of paper."'Annals of Self Protection,'" he said, loud enough for everyone else in the place to hear him.The logo of his favorite meedfeed coalesced on the page.Mediaglyphics, mostly the cool animated ones, arranged themselves in a grid.Bud scanned through them until he found the one that denoted a comparison of a bunch of different stuff, and snapped at it with his fingernail.New mediaglyphics appeared, surrounding larger cine panes in which Annals staff tested several models of skull guns against live and dead targets.Bud frisbeed the mediatron back onto the table; this was the same review he'd been poring over for the last day, they hadn't updated it, his decision was still valid.One of the guys ahead of him got a tattoo, which took about ten seconds.The other guy just wanted his skull gun reloaded, which didn't take much longer.The girl wanted a few 'sites replaced in her racting grid, mostly around her eyes, where she was starting to wrinkle up.That took a while, so Bud picked up the mediatron again and went in a ractive, his favorite, called Shut Up or Die!The mod artist wanted to see Bud's yuks before he installed the gun, which in other surroundings might have been construed as an insult but was standard business practice here in the Leased Territories.When he was satisfied that this wasn't a stick up, he theezed Bud's forehead with a spray gun, scalped back a flap of skin, and pushed a machine, mounted on a delicate robot arm like a dental tool, over Bud's forehead.The arm homed in automatically on the old gun, moving with alarming speed and determination.Bud, who was a little jumpy at the best of times because of hismuscle stimulators, flinched a little.But the robot arm was a hundred times faster than he was and plucked out the old gun unerringly.The proprietor was watching all of this on a screen and had nothing to do except narrate: "The hole in your skull's kind of rough, so the machine is reaming it out to a larger bore okay, now here comes the new gun. "A nasty popping sensation radiated through Bud's skull when the robot arm snapped in the new model.It reminded Bud of the days of his youth, when, from time to time, one of his playmates would shoot him in the head with a BB gun.He instantly developed a low headache."It's loaded with a hundred rounds of popcorn," the proprietor said, "so you can test out the yuvree.Soon as you're comfortable with it, I'll load it for real. "He stapled the skin of Bud's forehead back together so it'd heal invisibly.You could pay the guy extra to leave a scar there on purpose, so everyone would know you were packing, but Bud had heard that some chicks didn't like it.Bud's relationship with the female sex was governed by a gallimaufry of primal impulses, dim suppositions, deranged theories, overheard scraps of conversation, half remembered pieces of bad advice, and fragments of no doubt exaggerated anecdotes that amounted to rank superstition.In this case, it dictated that he should not request the scar.Besides, he had a nice collection of Sights not very tasteful sunglasses with crosshairs hudded into the lens on your dominant eye.They did wonders for marksmanship, and they were real obvious too, so that everyone knew you didn't fuck with a man wearing Sights."Give it a whirl," the guy said, and spun the chair around it was a big old antique barber chair upholstered in swirly plastic so Bud was facing a mannikin in the corner of the room.The mannikin had no face or hair and was speckled with little burn marks, as was the wall behind it."Status," Bud said, and felt the gun buzz lightly in response."Stand by," he said, and got another answering buzz.He turned his face squarely toward the mannikin."Hut," he said.He said it under his breath, through unmoving lips, but the gun heard it; he felt a slight recoil tapping his head back, and a startling POP sounded from the mannikin, accompanied by a flash of light on the wall up above its head.Bud's headache deepened, but he didn't care."This thing runs faster ammo, so you'll have to get used to aiming a tad lower," said the guy.So Bud tried it again and this time popped the mannikin right in the neck."Great shot!That would have decapped him if you were using Hellfire," the guy said."Looks to me like you know what you're doing but there's other options too.And three magazines so you can run multiple ammos. ""I know," Bud said, "I been checking this thing out. "Then, to the gun, "Disperse ten, medium pattern. "Then he said "hut" again.His head snapped back much harder, and ten POPs went off at once, all over the mannikin's body and the wall behind it.The room was getting smoky now, starting to smell like burned plastic."You can disperse up to a hundred," the guy said, "but the recoil'd probably break your neck. ""I think I got it down," Bud said, "so load me up.First magazine with electrostun rounds.Second magazine with Cripplers.Third with Hellfires.And get me some fucking aspirin. "Source Victoria;  description of its environs.Source Victoria's air intakes erupted from the summit of the Royal Ecological Conservatory like a spray of hundred meter long calla lilies.Below, the analogy was perfected by an inverted tree of rootlike plumbing that spread fractally through the diamondoid bedrock of New Chusan, terminating in the warm water of the South China Sea as numberless capillaries arranged in a belt around the smartcoral reef, several dozen nieters beneath the surface.One big huge pipe gulping up seawater would have done roughly the same thing, just as the lilies could have been replaced by one howling maw, birds and litter whacking into a bloody grid somewhere before they could gum up the works.But it wouldn't have been ecological.The geotects of Imperial Tectonics would not have known an ecosystem if they'd been living in the middle of one.But they did know that ecosystems were especially tiresome when they got fubared, so they protected the environment with the same implacable, plodding, green visored mentality that they applied to designing overpasses and culverts.Thus, water seeped into Source Victoria through microtubes, much the same way it seeped into a beach, and air wafted into it silently down the artfully skewed exponential horns of those thrusting calla lilies, each horn a point in parameter space not awfully far from some central ideal.They were strong enough to withstand typhoons but flexible enough to rustle in a breeze.Birds, wandering inside, sensed a gradient in the air, pulling them down into night, and simply chose to fly out.They didn't even get scared enough to shit.The lilies sprouted from a stadium sized cut crystal vase, the Diamond Palace, which was open to the public.Tourists, aerobicizing pensioners, and ranks of uniformed schoolchildren marched through it year in and year out, peering through walls of glass (actually solid diamond, which was cheaper) at various phases of the molecular disassembly line that was Source Victoria.Dirty air and dirty water came in and pooled in tanks.Next to each tank was another tank containing slightly cleaner air or cleaner water.Repeat several dozen times.The tanks at the end were filled with perfectly clean nitrogen gas and perfectly clean water.The line of tanks was referred to as a cascade, a rather abstract bit of engineer's whimsy lost on the tourists who did not see anything snapshot worthy there.All the action took place in the walls separating the tanks, which were not really walls but nearly infinite grids of submicroscopic wheels, ever rotating and many spoked.Each spoke grabbed a nitrogen or water molecule on the dirty side and released it after spinning around to the clean side.Things that weren't nitrogen or water didn't get grabbed, hence didn't make it through.There were also wheels for grabbing handy trace elements like carbon, sulfur, and phosphorus; these were passed along smaller, parallel cascades until they were also perfectly pure.The immaculate molecules wound up in reservoirs.Some of them got combined with others to make simple but handy molecular widgets.In the end, all of them were funneled into a bundle of molecular conveyor belts known as the Feed, of which Source Victoria, and the other half dozen Sources of Atlantis/Shanghai, were the fountainheads.Financial complications of Bud's lifestyle;  visit to a banker.Bud surprised himself with how long he went before he had to use the skull gun in anger.Just knowing it was in there gave him such an attitude that no one in his right mind would Rick with him, especially when they saw his Sights and the black leather.He got his way just by giving people the evil eye.It was time to move up the ladder.He sought work as a lookout.It wasn't easy.The alternative pharmaceuticals industry ran on a start, just in time delivery system, keeping inventories low so that there was never much evidence for the cops to seize.The stuff was grown in illicit matter compilers, squirreled away in vacant low rent housing blocks, and carried by the runners to the actual street dealers.Meanwhile, a cloud of lookouts and decoys circulated probabilistically through the neighborhood, never stopping long enough to be picked up for loitering, monitoring the approach of cops (or cops' surveillance pods) through huds in their sunglasses.When Bud told his last boss to go Rick himself, he'd been pretty sure he could get a runner job.But it hadn't panned out, and since then a couple more big airships had come in from North America and disgorged thousands of white and black trash into the job market.Now Bud was running out of money and getting tired of eating the free food from the public matter compilers.The Peacock Bank was a handsome man with a salt and pepper goatee, smelling of citrus and wearing an exceedingly snappy doublebreasted suit that displayed his narrow waist to good effect.He was to be found in a rather seedy office upstairs of a travel agency in one of the lurid blocks between the Aerodrome and the brothel lined waterfront.The banker didn't say much after they shook hands, just crossed his arms pensively and leaned back against the edge of his desk.In this attitude he listened to Bud's freshly composed prevarication, nodding from time to time as though Bud had said something significant.This was a little disconcerting since Bud knew it was all horseshit, but he had heard that these dotheads prided themselves on customer service.At no particular point in the monologue, the banker cut Bud off simply by looking up at him brightly."You wish to secure a line ofcredit," he said, as if he were pleasantly surprised, which was not terribly likely."I guess you could say that," Bud allowed, wishing he'd known to put it in such fine sounding terminology.The banker reached inside his jacket and withdrew a piece of paper, folded in thirds, from his breast pocket."You may wish to peruse this brochure," he said to Bud, and to the brochure itself he rattled off something in an unfamiliar tongue.As Bud took it from the banker's hand, the blank page generated a nice animated color logo and music.The logo developed into a peacock.Beneath it, a video presentation commenced, hosted by a similar looking gent sort of Indian looking but sort of Arab too."'The Parsis welcome you to Peacock Bank,'" he said."What's a Parsi?"Bud said to the banker, who merely lowered his eyelids one click and jutted his goatee at the piece of paper, which had picked up on his question and already branched into an explanation.Bud ended up regretting having asked, because the answer turned out to be a great deal of general hoo ha about these Parsis, who evidently wanted to make very sure no one mistook them for dotheads or Pakis or Arabs not that they had any problem with those very fine ethnic groups, mind you.As hard as he tried not to pay attention, Bud absorbed more than he wanted to know about the Parsis, their oddball religion, their tendency to wander around, even their fucking cuisine, which looked weird but made.his mouth water anyway.Then the brochure got back to the business at hand, which was lines of credit.Bud had seen this all before.The Peacock Bank was running the same racket as all the others: If they accepted you, they'd shoot the credit card right into you, then and there, on the spot.These guys implanted it in the iliac crest of the pelvis, some opted for the mastoid bone in the skull anywhere a big bone was close to the surface.A bone mount was needed because the card had to talk on the radio, which meant it needed an antenna long enough to hear radio waves.Then you could go around and buy stuff just by asking for it; Peacock Bank and the merchant you were buying from and the card in your pelvis handled all the details.Banks varied in their philosophy of interest rates, minimum monthly payments, and so on.None of that mattered to Bud.What mattered was what they would do to him if he got into arrears, and so after he had allowed a decent interval to pass pretending to listen very carefully to all this crap about interest rates, he inquired, in an offhanded way, like it was an afterthought, about their collection policy.The banker glanced out the window like he hadn't noticed.The soundtrack segued into some kind of a cool jazz number and a scene of a multicultural crew of ladies and gentlemen, not looking much like degraded credit abusers at all, sitting around a table assembling chunky pieces of ethnic jewelry by hand.They were having a good time too, sipping tea and exchanging lively banter.Sipping too much tea, to Bud's suspicious eye, so opaque to so many things yet so keen to the tactics of media manipulation.They were making rather a big deal out of the tea.He noted with approval that they were wearing normal clothes, not uniforms, and that men and women were allowed to mingle."Peacock Bank supports a global network of clean, safe, and commodious workhouses, so if unforeseen circumstances should befall you during our relationship, or if you should inadvertently anticipate your means, you can rely on being housed close to home while you and the bank resolve any difficulties.Inmates in Peacock Bank workhouses enjoy private beds and in some cases private rooms.Naturally your children can remain with you for the duration of your visit.Working conditions are among the best in the industry, and the high added value content of our folk jewelry operation means that, no matter the extent of your difficulties, your situation will be happily resolved in practically no time. ""What's the, uh, strategy for making sure people actually, you know, show up when they're supposed to show up?"Bud said.At this point the banker lost interest in the proceedings, straightened up, strolled around his desk, and sat down, staring out the window across the water toward Pudong and Shanghai."That detail is not covered in the brochure," he said, "as most of our prospective customers do not share your diligent attention to detail insofar as that aspect of the arrangement is concerned. "He exhaled through his nose, like a man eager not to smell something, and adjusted his goatee one time."The enforcement regime consists of three phases.We have pleasant names for them, of course, but you might think of them, respectively, as: one, a polite reminder; two, well in excess of your pain threshold; three, spectacularly fatal. "Bud thought about showing this Parsi the meaning of fatal right then and there, but as a bank, the guy probably had pretty good security.Besides, it was pretty standard policy, and Bud was actually kind of glad the guy'd given it to him straight."Okay, well, I'll get back to you," he said."Mind if I keep the brochure?"The Parsi waved him and the brochure away.Bud took to the streets again in search of cash on easier terms.A visit from royalty;  the Hackworths take an airship holiday;  Princess Charlotte's birthday party;  Hackworth encounters a member of the peerage.Three geodesic seeds skated over the roofs and gardens of Atlantis/Shanghai on a Friday afternoon, like the germs of some moon size calabash.A pair of mooring masts sprouted and grew from cricket ovals at Source Victoria Park.The smallest of the airships was decorated with the royal ensign; she kept station overhead as the two large ones settled toward their berths.Their envelopes, filled with nothing, were predominantly transparent.Instead of blocking the sunlight, they yellowed and puckered it, projecting vast abstract patterns of brighter and not as bright that the children in their best crinolines and natty short pants suits tried to catch in their arms.A brass band played.A tiny figure in a white dress stood at the rail of the airship Atlantis, waving at the children below.They all knew that this must be the birthday girl herself, Princess Charlotte, and they cheered and waved back.Fiona Hackworth had been wandering through the Royal Ecological Conservatory bracketed by her parents, who hoped that in this way they could keep mud and vegetable debris off her skirts.The strategy had not been completely successful, but with a quick brush, John and Gwendolyn were able to transfer most of the dirt onto their white gloves.From there it went straight into the air.Most gentlemen's and ladies' gloves nowadays were constructed of infinitesimal fabricules that knew how to eject dirt; you could thrust your gloved hand into mud, and it would be white a few seconds later.The hierarchy of staterooms on ther matched the status of its passengers perfectly, as these parts of the ship could be decompiled and remade between voyages.For Lord Finkle McGraw, his three children and their spouses, and Elizabeth (his first and only grandchild so far), the airship lowered a private escalator that carried them up into the suite at the very prow, with its nearly 180 degree forward view.Aft of the Finkle McGraws were a dozen or so other Equity Lords, merely earl or baron level, mostly ushering grandchildren rather than children into the class B suites.Then it was executives, whose gold watch chains, adangle with tiny email boxes, phones, torches, snuffboxes, and other fetishes, curved round the dark waistcoats they wore to deemphasize their bellies.Most of their children had reached the age when they were no longer naturally endearing to anyone save their own parents; the size when their energy was more a menace than a wonder; and the level of intelligence when what would have been called innocence in a smaller child was infuriating rudeness.A honeybee cruising for nectar is pretty despite its implicit threat, but the same behavior in a hornet three times larger makes one glance about for some handy swatting material.So on the broad escalators leading to the first class staterooms, one could see many upper arms being violently grabbed by hissing fathers with their top hats askew and teeth clenched and eyes swiveling for witnesses.John Percival Hackworth was an engineer.Most engineers were assigned to tiny rooms with fold down beds, but Hackworth bore the loftier title of Artifex and had been a team leader on this very project, so he rated a second class stateroom with one double bed and a fold out for Fiona.The porter brought their overnight bags around just as ther was clearing her mooring mast a twenty meter diamondoid truss that had already dissolved back into the billiard table surface of the oval by the time the ship had turned itself to the south.Lying as close as it did to Source Victoria, the park was riddled with catachthonic Feed lines, and anything could be grown there on short notice.The Hackworths' stateroom was to starboard, and so as they accelerated away from New Chusan, they got to watch the sun set on Shanghai, shining redly through the city's eternal cloak of coal smoke.Gwendolyn read Fiona stories in bed for an hour while John perused the evening edition of the Times, then spread out some papers on the room's tiny desk.Later, they both changed into their evening clothes, primping quietly in twilight so as not to wake Fiona.At nine o'clock they stepped into the passageway, locked the door, and followed the sound of the big band to ther's grand ballroom, where the dancing was just getting underway.The floor of the ballroom was a slab of transpicuous diamond.The lights were low.They seemed to float above the glittering moonlit surface of the Pacific as they did the waltz, minuet, Lindy, and electric slide into the night....Sunrise found the three airships hovering over the South China Sea, no land visible.The ocean was relatively shallow here, but only Hackworth and a few other engineers knew that.The Hackworths had a passable view from their stateroom window, but John woke up early and staked out a place on the diamond floor of the ballroom, ordered an espresso and a Times from a waiter, and passed the time pleasantly while Gwen and Fiona got themselves ready for the day.All around them he could hear children speculating on what was about to happen.Gwen and Fiona arrived just late enough to make it interesting for John, who took his mechanical pocket watch out at least a dozen times as he waited, and finally ended up clutching it in one hand, nervously popping the lid open and shut.Gwen folded her long legs and spread her skirts out prettily on the transparent floor, drawing vituperative looks from several women who remained standing.But John was relieved to see that most of these women were relatively low ranking engineers or their wives; none of the higher ups needed to come to the ballroom.Fiona collapsed to her hands and knees and practically shoved her face against the diamond, her fundament aloft.Hackworth gripped the creases of his trousers, hitched them up just a bit, and sank to one knee.The smart coral burst out of the depths with violence that shocked Hackworth, even though he'd been in on the design, seen the trial runs.Viewed through the dark surface of the Pacific, it was like watching an explosion through a pane of shattered glass.It reminded him of pouring a jet of heavy cream into coffee, watching it rebound from the bottom of the cup in a turbulent fractal bloom that solidified just as it dashed against the surface.The speed of this process was a carefully planned sleight of hand; the smart coral had actually been growing down on the bottom of the ocean for the last three months, drawing its energy from a supercon that they'd grown across the seafloor for the occasion, extracting the necessary atoms directly from the seawater and the gases dissolved therein.The process happening below looked chaotic, and in a way it was; but each lithocule knew exactly where it was supposed to go and what it was supposed to do.They were tetrahedral building blocks of calcium and carbon, the size of poppyseeds, each equipped with a power source, a brain, and a navigational system.They rose from the bottom of the sea at a signal given by Princess Charlotte; she had awakened to find a small present under her pillow, unwrapped it to find a golden whistle on a chain, stood out on her balcony, and blown the whistle.The coral was converging on the site of the island from all directions, some of the lithocules traveling several kilometers to reach their assigned positions.They displaced a volume of water equal to the island itself, several cubic kilometers in all.The result was furious turbulence, an upswelling in the surface of the ocean that made some of the children scream, thinking it might rise up and snatch the airship out of the sky; and indeed a few drops pelted the ship's diamond belly, prompting the pilot to give her a little more altitude.The curt maneuver forced hearty laughter from all of the fathers in the ballroom, who were delighted by the illusion of danger and the impotence of Nature.The foam and mist cleared away at some length to reveal a new island, salmon colored in the light of dawn.Applause and cheers diminished to a professional murmur.The chattering of the astonished children was too loud and high to hear.It would be a couple of hours yet.Hackworth snapped his fingers for a waiter and ordered fresh fruit, juice, Belgian waffles, more coffee.They might as well enjoy ther's famous cuisine while the island sprouted castles, fauns, centaurs, and enchanted forests.Princess Charlotte was the first human to set foot on the enchanted isle, tripping down the gangway of Atlantis with a couple of her little friends in tow, all of them looking like tiny wildflowers in their ribboned sun bonnets, all carrying little baskets for souvenirs, though before long these were handed over to governesses.The Princess faced ther and Chinook, moored a couple of hundred meters away, and spoke to them in a normal tone of voice that was, however, heard clearly by all; a nanophone was hidden somewhere in the lace collar of her pinafore, tied into phased audio array systems grown into the top layers of the island itself."I would like to express my gratitude to Lord Finkle McGraw and all the employees of Machine Phase Systems Limited for this most wonderful birthday present.Now, children of Atlantis/Shanghai, won't you please join me at my birthday party?"The children of Atlantis/Shanghai all screamed yes and rampaged down the multifarious gangways of ther and Chinook, which had all been splayed out for the occasion in hopes of preventing bottlenecks, which might lead to injury or, heaven forbid, rudeness.For the first few moments the children simply burst away from the airships like gas escaping from a bottle.Then they began to converge on sources of wonderment: a centaur, eight feet high if he was an inch, walking across a meadow with his son and daughter cantering around him: Some baby dinosaurs.A cave angling gently into a hillside, bearing promising signs of enchantment.A road winding up another hill toward a ruined castle.The grownups mostly remained aboard the airships and gave the children a few minutes to flame out, though Lord Finkle McGraw could be seen making his way toward Atlantis, poking curiously at the earth with his walking stick, just to make sure it was fit to be trod by royal feet.A man and a woman descended the gangway of Atlantis: in a floral dress that explored the labile frontier between modesty and summer comfort, accessorized with a matching parasol, Queen Victoria II of Atlantis.In a natty beige linen suit, her husband, the Prince Consort, whose name, lamentably, was Joe.Joe, or Joseph as he was called in official circumstances, stepped down first, moving in a somewhat pompous one small step for man gait, then turned to face Her Majesty and offered his hand, which she accepted graciously but perfunctorily, as if to remind everyone that she'd done crew at Oxford and had blown off tension during her studies at Stanford B School with lap swimming, rollerbiading, and jeet kune do.Lord Finkle McGraw bowed as the royal espadrilles touched down.She extended her hand, and he kissed it, which was racy but allowed if you were old and stylish, like Alexander Chung Sik Finkle McGraw."We thank Lord Finkle McGraw, Imperial Tectonics Limited, and Machine Phase Systems Limited once again for this lovely occasion.Now let us all enjoy these magnificent surroundings before, like the first Atlantis, they sink forever beneath the waves. "The parents of Atlantis/Shanghai strolled down the gangways, though many had retreated to their staterooms to change clothes upon catching sight of what the Queen and Prince Consort were wearing.The big news, already being uploaded to the Times by telescope wielding fashion columnists on board ther was that the parasol was back.Gwendolyn Hackworth hadn't packed a parasol, but she was untroubled; she'd always had a kind of natural, unconscious alamodality.She and John strolled down onto the island.By the time Hackworth's eyes had adjusted to the sunlight, he was already squatting and rubbing a pinch of soil between his fingertips.Gwen left him to obsess and joined a group of other women, mostly engineers' wives, and even a baronet level Equity Participant or two.Hackworth found a concealed path that wound through trees up a hillside to a little grove around a cool, clear pond of fresh water he tasted it just to be sure.He stood there for a while, looking out over the enchanted island, wondering what Fiona was up to right now.This led to daydreaming: perhaps she had, by some miracle, encountered Princess Charlotte, made friends with her, and was exploring some wonder with her right now.This led him into a long reverie that was interrupted when he realized that someone was quoting poetry to him."Where had we been, we two, beloved Friend!If in the season of unperilous choice,  In lieu of wandering, as we did, through vales  Rich with indigenous produce, open ground  Of Fancy, happy pastures ranged at will,  We had been followed, hourly watched, and noosed,  Each in his several melancholy walk  Stringed like a poor man's heifer at its feed,  Led through the lanes in forlorn servitude. "Hackworth turned to see that an older man was sharing his view.Genetically Asian, with a somewhat Twangy North American accent, the man looked at least seventy.His translucent skin was still stretched tight over broad cheekbones, but the eyelids, ears, and the hollows of his cheeks were weathered and wrinkled.Under his pith helmet no fringe of hair showed; the man was completely bald.Hackworth gathered these clues slowly, until at last he realized who stood before him."Sounds like Wordsworth," Hackworth said.The man had been staring out over the meadows below.He cocked his head and looked directly at Hackworth for the first time."The poem?""Judging by content, I'd guess The Prelude. ""Nicely done," the man said."John Percival Hackworth at your service. "Hackworth stepped toward the other and handed him a card."Pleasure," the man said.He did not waste breath introducing himself.Lord Alexander Chung Sik Finkle McGraw was one of several duke level Equity Lords who had come out of Apthorp.Apthorp was not a formal organization that could be looked up in a phone book; in financial cant, it referred to a strategic alliance of several immense companies, including Machine Phase Systems Limited and Imperial Tectonics Limited.When no one important was listening, its employees called it John Zaibatsu, much as their forebears of a previous century had referred to the East India Company as John Company.MPS made consumer goods and ITL made real estate, which was, as ever, where the real money was.Counted by the hectare, it didn't amount to much just a few strategically placed islands really, counties rather than continents but it was the most expensive real estate in the world outside of a few blessed places like Tokyo, San Francisco, and Manhattan.The reason was that Imperial Tectonics had geotects, and geotects could make sure that every new piece of land possessed the charms of Frisco, the strategic location of Manhattan, the feng shui of Hong Kong, the dreary but obligatory Lebensraum of L. A.  It was no longer necessary to send out dirty yokels in coonskin caps to chart the wilderness, kill the abos, and clear cut the groves; now all you needed was a hot young geotect, a start matter compiler, and a jumbo Source.Like most other neo Victorians, Hackworth could recite Finkle McGraw's biography from memory.The future Duke had been born in Korea and adopted, at the age of six months, by a couple who'd met during grad school in Iowa City and later started an organic farm near the Iowa/South Dakota border.During his early teens, a passenger jet made an improbable crashlanding at the Sioux City airport, and Finkle McGraw, along with several other members of his Boy Scout troop who had been hastily mobilized by their scoutmaster, was standing by the runway along with every ambulance, fireman, doctor, and nurse from a radius of several counties.The uncanny efficiency with which the locals responded to the crash was widely publicized and became the subject of a made for TV movie.Finkle McGraw couldn't understand why.They had simply done what was reasonable and humane under the circumstances; why did people from other parts of the country find this so difficult to understand?This tenuous grasp of American culture might have been owing to the fact that his parents home schooled him up to the age of fourteen.A typical school day for Finkle McGraw consisted of walking down to a river to study tadpoles or going to the public library to check out a book on ancient Greece or Rome.The family had little spare money, and vacations consisted of driving to the Rockies for some backpacking, or up to northern Minnesota for canoeing.He probably learned more on his summer vacations than most of his peers did during their school years.Social contact with other children happened mostly through Boy Scouts or church the Finkle McGraws belonged to a Methodist church, a Roman Catholic church, and a tiny synagogue that met in a rented room in Sioux City.His parents enrolled him in a public high school, where he maintained a steady 2.0 average out of a possible 4.The coursework was so stunningly inane, the other children so dull, that Finkle McGraw developed a poor attitude.He earned some repute as a wrestler and cross country runner, but never exploited it for sexual favors, which would have been easy enough in the promiscuous climate of the times.He had some measure of the infuriating trait that causes a young man to be a nonconformist for its own sake and found that the surest way to shock most people, in those days, was to believe that some kinds of behavior were bad and others good, and that it was reasonable to live one's life accordingly.After graduating from high school, he spent a year running certain parts of his parents' agricultural business and then attended Iowa State University of Science and Technology ("Science with Practice") in Ames.He enrolled as an agricultural engineering major and switched to physics after his first quarter.While remaining a nominal physics major for the next three years, he took classes in whatever he wanted: information science, metallurgy, early music.He never earned a degree, not because of poor performance but because of the political climate; like many universities at the time, ISU insisted that its students study a broad range of subjects, including arts and humanities.Finkle McGraw chose instead to read books, listen to music, and attend plays in his spare time.One summer, as he was living in Ames and working as a research assistant in a solid state physics lab, the city was actually turned into an island for a couple of days by an immense flood.Along with many other Midwesterners, Finkle McGraw put in a few weeks building levees out of sandbags and plastic sheeting.Once again he was struck by the national media coverage reporters from the coasts kept showing up and announcing, with some bewilderment, that there had been no looting.The lesson learned during the Sioux City plane crash was reinforced.The Los Angeles riots of the previous year provided a vivid counterexample.Finkle McGraw began to develop an opinion that was to shape his political views in later years, namely, that while people were not genetically different, they were culturally as different as they could possibly be, and that some cultures were simply better than others.This was not a subjective value judgment, merely an observation that some cultures thrived and expanded while others failed.It was a view implicitly shared by nearly everyone but, in those days, never voiced.Finkle McGraw left the university without a diploma and went back to the farm, which he managed for a few years while his parents were preoccupied with his mother's breast cancer.After her death, he moved to Minneapolis and took a job with a company founded by one of his former professors, making scanning tunneling microscopes, which at that time were newish devices capable of seeing and manipulating individual atoms.The field was an obscure one then, the clients tended to be large research institutions, and practical applications seemed far away.But it was perfect for a man who wanted to study nanotechnology, and McGraw began doing so, working late at night on his own time.Given his diligence, his self confidence, his intelligence ("adaptable, relentless, but not really brilliant"), and the basic grasp of business he'd picked up on the farm, it was inevitable that he would become one of the few hundred pioneers of nanotechnological revolution; that his own company, which he founded five years after he moved to Minneapolis, would survive long enough to be absorbed into Apthorp; and that he would navigate Apthorp's political and economic currents well enough to develop a decent equity position.He still owned the family farm in northwestern Iowa, along with a few hundred thousand acres of adjoining land, which he was turning back into a tall grass prairie, complete with herds of bison and real Indians who had discovered that riding around on horses hunting wild game was a better deal than pissing yourself in gutters in Minneapolis or Seattle.But for the most part he stayed on New Chusan, which was for all practical purposes his ducal estate...."Public relations?"said Finkle McGraw."Sir?"Modern etiquette was streamlined; no "Your Grace" or other honorifics were necessary in such an informal setting."Your department, sir. "Hackworth had given him his social card, which was appropriate under these circumstances but revealed nothing else."Engineering.Bespoke. ""Oh, really.I'd thought anyone who could recognise Wordsworth must be one of those artsy sorts in P. R. ""Not in this case, sir.I'm an engineer.Just promoted to Bespoke recently.Did some work on this project, as it happens. ""What sort of work?""Oh, P. I.  stuff mostly," Hackworth said.Supposedly Finkle McGraw still kept up with things and would recognize the abbreviation for pseudo intelligence, and perhaps even appreciate that Hackworth had made this assumption.Finkle McGraw brightened a bit."You know, when I was a lad they called it A. I.  Artificial intelligence. "Hackworth allowed himself a tight, narrow, and brief smile."Well, there's something to be said for cheekiness, I suppose. ""In what way was pseudo intelligence used here?""Strictly on MPS's side of the project, sir. "Imperial Tectonics had done the island, buildings, and vegetation.Machine Phase Systems Hackworth's employer did anything that moved."Stereotyped behaviors were fine for the birds, dinosaurs, and so on, but for the centaurs and fauns we wanted more interactivity, something that would provide an illusion of sentience. ""Yes, well done, well done, Mr.Hackworth. ""Thank you, sir. ""Now, I know perfectly well that only the very finest engineers make it to Bespoke.Suppose you tell me how an aficionado of Romantic poets made it into such a position. "Hackworth was taken aback by this and tried to respond without seeming to put on airs."Surely a man in your position does not see any contradiction "  "But a man in my position was not responsible for promoting you to Bespoke.A man in an entirely different position was.And I am very much afraid that such men do tend to see a contradiction. ""Yes, I see.Well, sir, I studied English literature in college. ""Ah!So you are not one of those who followed the straight and narrow path to engineering. ""I suppose not, sir. ""And your colleagues at Bespoke?""Well, if I understand your question, sir, I would say that, as compared with other departments, a relatively large proportion of Bespoke engineers have had well, for lack of a better way of describing it, interesting lives. ""And what makes one man's life more interesting than another's?""In general, I should say that we find unpredictable or novel things more interesting. ""That is nearly a tautology. "But while Lord Finkle McGraw was not the sort to express feelings promiscuously, he gave the appearance of being nearly satisfied with the way the conversation was going.He turned back toward the view again and watched the children for a minute or so, twisting the point of his walking stick into the ground as if he were still skeptical of the island's integrity.Then he swept the stick around in an arc that encompassed half the island."How many of those children do you suppose are destined to lead interesting lives?""Well, at least two, sir Princess Charlotte, and your granddaughter. ""You're quick, Hackworth, and I suspect capable of being devious if not for your staunch moral character," Finkle McGraw said, not without a certain archness."Tell me, were your parents subjects, or did you take the Oath?""As soon as I turned twenty one, sir.Her Majesty at that time, actually, she was still Her Royal Highness was touring North America, prior to her enrollment at Stanford, and I took the Oath at Trinity Church in Boston. ""Why?You're a clever fellow, not blind to culture like so many engineers.You could have joined the First Distributed Republic or any of a hundred synthetic phyles on the West Coast.You would have had decent prospects and been free from all this"  Finkle McGraw jabbed his cane at the two big airships  "behavioural discipline that we impose upon ourselves.Why did you impose it on yourself, Mr.Hackworth?""Without straying into matters that are strictly personal in nature," Hackworth said carefully, "I knew two kinds of discipline as a child: none at all, and too much.The former leads to degenerate behaviour.When I speak of degeneracy, I am not being priggish, sir I am alluding to things well known to me, as they made my own childhood less than idyllic. "Finkle McGraw, perhaps realizing that he had stepped out of bounds, nodded vigorously."This is a familiar argument, of course. ""Of course, sir.I would not presume to imply that I was the only young person ill used by what became of my native culture. ""And I do not see such an implication.But many who feel as you do found their way into phyles wherein a much harsher regime prevails and which view us as degenerates. ""My life was not without periods of excessive, unreasoning discipline, usually imposed capriciously by those responsible for laxity in the first place.That combined with my historical studies led me, as many others, to the conclusion that there was little in the previous century worthy of emulation, and that we must look to the nineteenth century instead for stable social models. ""Well done, Hackworth!But you must know that the model to which you allude did not long survive the first Victoria. ""We have outgrown much of the ignorance and resolved many of the internal contradictions that characterised that era. ""Have we, then?How reassuring.And have we resolved them in a way that will ensure that all of those children down there live interesting lives?""I must confess that I am too slow to follow you. ""You yourself said that the engineers in the Bespoke department the very best had led interesting lives, rather than coming from the straight and narrow.Which implies a correlation, does it not?""Clearly. ""This implies, does it not, that in order to raise a generation of children who can reach their full potential, we must find a way to make their lives interesting.And the question I have for you, Mr.Hackworth, is this: Do you think that our schools accomplish that?Or are they like the schools that Wordsworth complained of?""My daughter is too young to attend school but I should fear that the latter situation prevails. ""I assure you that it does, Mr.Hackworth.My three children were raised in those schools, and I know them well.I am determined that Elizabeth shall be raised differently. "Hackworth felt his face flushing."Sir, may I remind you that we have just met I do not feel worthy of the confidences you are reposing in me. ""I'm telling you these things not as a friend, Mr.Hackworth, but as a professional. ""Then I must remind you that I am an engineer, not a child psychologist. ""This I have not forgotten, Mr.Hackworth.You are indeed an engineer, and a very fine one, in a company that I still think of as mine though as an Equity Lord, I no longer have a formal connection.And now that you have brought your part of this project to a successful conclusion, I intend to put you in charge of a new project for which I have reason to believe you are perfectly suited. "Bud embarks on a life of crime;  an insult to a tribe & its consequences.Bud rolled his first victim almost by accident.He'd taken a wrong turn into a cul de sac and inadvertently trapped a black man and woman and a couple of little kids who'd blundered in there before him.They had a scared look about them, like a lot of the new arrivals did, and Bud noticed the way the man's gaze lingered on his Sights, wondering whether those crosshairs, invisible to him, were centered on him, his lady, or his kid.Bud didn't get out of their way.He was packing, they weren't, it was up to them to get out of his way.But instead they just froze up."You got a problem?"Bud said."What do you want?"the man said.It had been a while since anyone had manifested such sincere concern for Bud's desires, and he kind of liked it.He realized that these people were under the impression that they were being mugged."Oh, same as anyone else.Money and shit," Bud said, and just like that, the man took some hard ucus out of his pocket and handed them over and then actually thanked him as he backed away.Bud enjoyed getting that kind of respect from black people it reminded him of his noble heritage in the trailer parks of North Florida and he didn't mind the money either.After that day he began looking for black people with that same scared uncertain look about them.These people bought and sold off the record, and so they carried hard money.He did pretty well for himself for a couple of months.Every so often he would stop by the flat where his bitch Tequila lived, give her some lingerie, and maybe give Harv some chocolate.Harv was presumed by both Bud and Tequila to be Bud's son.He was five, which meant that he had been conceived in a much earlier cycle of Bud and Tequila's break up and make up relationship.Now the bitch was pregnant again, which meant that Bud would have to bring even more gifts to her place when he came around.The pressures of fatherhood!One day Bud targeted a particularly well dressed family because of their fancy clothes.The man was wearing a business suit and the woman a nice clean dress, and they were carrying a baby all dressed up in a white lacy thing, and they had hired a porter to help them haul their luggage away from the Aerodrome.The porter was a white guy who vaguely reminded Bud of himself, and he was incensed to see him acting as a pack animal for blacks.So as soon as these people got away from the bustle of the Aerodrome and into a more secluded neighborhood, Bud approached them, swaggering in the way he'd practiced in the mirror, occasionally pushing his Sights up on his nose with one index finger.The guy in the suit was different from most of them.He didn't try to act like he hadn't seen Bud, didn't try to skulk away, didn't cringe or slouch, just stood his ground, feet planted squarely, and very pleasantly said, "Yes, sir, can I be of assistance?"He didn't talk like an American black, had almost a British accent, but crisper.Now that Bud had come closer, he saw that the man had a strip of colored cloth thrown around his neck and over his lapels, dangling down like a scarf.He looked well housed and well fed for the most part, except for a little scar high up on one cheekbone.Bud kept walking until he was a little too close to the guy.He kept his head tilted back until the last minute, like he was kicking back listening to some loud tunes (which he was), and then suddenly snapped his head forward so he was staring the guy right in the face.It was another way to emphasize the fact that he was packing, and it usually did the trick.But this guy did not respond with the little flinch that Bud had come to expect and enjoy.Maybe he was from some booga booga country where they didn't know about skull guns."Sir," the man said, "my family and I are on the way to our hotel.We have had a long journey, and we are tired; my daughter has an ear infection.If you would state your business as expeditiously as possible, I would be obliged. ""You talk like a fucking Vicky," Bud said."Sir, I am not what you refer to as a Vicky, or I should have gone directly there.I would be obliged if you could be so kind as to moderate your language in the presence of my wife and child. "It took Bud a while to untangle this sentence, and a while longer to believe that the man really cared about a few dirty words spoken within earshot of his family, and longer yet to believe that he had been so insolent to Bud, a heavily muscled guy who was obviously packing a skull gun."I'm gonna fucking say whatever I fucking want to your bitch and your flicking brat," Bud said, very loud.Then he could not keep himself from grinning.Score a few points for Bud!The man looked impatient rather than scared and heaved a deep sigh."Is this an armed robbery or something?Are you sure you know what you are getting into?"Bud answered by whispering "hut" under his breath and firing a Crippler into the man's right bicep.It went off deep in the muscle, like an M 80, blowing a dark hole in the sleeve of the man's jacket and leaving his arm stretched out nice and straight the trike now pulling without anything to oppose it.The man clenched his teeth, his eyes bulged, and for a few moments he made strangled grunting noises from way down in his chest, making an effort not to cry out.Bud stared at the wound in fascination.It was just like shooting people in a ractive.Except that the bitch didn't scream and beg for mercy.She just turned her back, using her body to shield the baby, and looked over her shoulder, calmly, at Bud.Bud noticed she had a little scar on her cheek too."Next I take your eye," Bud said, "then I go to work on the bitch. "The man held up his good hand palm out, indicating surrender.He emptied his pocket of hard Universal Currency Units and handed them over.And then Bud made himself scarce, because the monitors almond size aerostats with eyes, ears, and radios had probably picked up the sound of the explosion and begun converging on the area.He saw one hiss by him as he rounded the corner, trailing a short whip antenna that caught the light like a hairline crack in the atmosphere.Three days later, Bud was hanging around the Aerodrome, looking for easy pickings, when a big ship came in from Singapore.Immersed in a stream of thousand arrivals was a tight group of some two dozen solidly built, very dark skinned black men dressed in business suits, with Strips of colored cloth draped around their necks and little scars on their cheekbone.It was later that night that Bud, for the first time in his life, heard the word Ashanti."Another twenty five Ashanti just came in from L. A.!"said a man in a bar."The Ashanti had a big meeting in the conference room at the Sheraton!"said a woman on the street.Waiting in a queue for one of the free matter compilers, a bum said, "One of them Ashanti gave me five yuks.They're fine folks. "When Bud ran into a guy he knew, a former comrade in the decoy trade, he said, "Hey, the place is crawling with them Ashanti, ain't it?""Yup," said the guy, who had seemed unaccountably shocked to see Bud's face on the Street, and who was annoyingly distracted all of a sudden, swiveling his head to look all ways."They must be having a convention or something," Bud theorized."I rolled one of 'em the other night. ""Yeah, I know," his friend said."Huh?How'd you know that?""They ain't having a convention, Bud.All of those Ashanti except the first one came to town hunting for you. "Paralysis struck Bud's vocal cords, and he felt lightheaded, unable to concentrate."I gotta go," his friend said, and removed himself from Bud's vicinity.For the next few hours Bud felt as though everyone on the street was looking at him.Bud was certainly looking at them, looking for those suits, those colored strips of cloth.But he caught sight of a man in shorts and a T shirt a black man with very high cheeks, one of which was marked with a tiny scar, and almost Asian looking eyes in a very high state of alertness.So he couldn't rely on the Ashanti wearing stereotyped clothing.Very soon after that, Bud swapped clothes with an indigent down on the beach, giving up all his black leather and coming away with a T shirt and shorts of his own.The T shirt was much too small; it bound him under the armpits and pressed against his muscles so that he felt the eternal twitching even more than usual.He wished he could turn the stimulators off now, relax his muscles even for one night, but that would require a trip to the mod parlor, and he had to figure that the Ashanti had the mod parlors all staked out.He could have gone to any of several brothels, but he didn't know what kind of connections these Ashanti might have or even what the hell an Ashanti was, exactly and he wasn't sure he could get a boner under these circumstances anyway.As he wandered the streets of the Leased Territories, primed to level his Sights at any black person who blundered into his path, he reflected on the unfairness of his fate.How was he to know that guy belonged to a tribe?Actually, he should have known, just from the fact that he wore nice clothes and didn't look like all the other people.The very apartness of those people should have been a dead giveaway.And his lack of fear should have told him something.Like he couldn't believe anyone would be stupid enough to mug him.Well, Bud had been that stupid, and Bud didn't have a phyle of his own, so Bud was screwed.Bud would have to go get himself one real quick, now.He'd already tried to join the Boers a few years back.The Boers were to Bud's kind of white trash what these Ashanti were to most of the blacks.Stocky blonds in suits or the most conservative sorts of dresses, usually with half a dozen kids in tow, and my god did they ever stick together.Bud had paid a few visits to the local laager, studied some of their training ractives on his home mediatron, put in some extra hours at the gym trying to meet their physical standards, even gone to a couple of horrific bible study sessions.But in the end, Bud and the Boers weren't much of a match.The amount of church you had to attend was staggering it was like living in church.And he'd studied their history, but there were only so many Boer/Zulu skirmishes he could stand to read about or keep straight in his head.So that was out; he wasn't getting into any laager tonight.The Vickys wouldn't take him in a million years, of course.Almost all the other tribes were racially oriented, like those Parsis or whatever.The Jews wouldn't take him unless he cut a piece of his dick off and learned to read a whole nother language, which was a bit of a tall order since he hadn't gotten round to learning how to read English yet.There were a bunch of coenobitical phyles religious tribes that took people of all races, but most of them weren't very powerful and didn't have turf in the Leased Territories.The Mormons had turf and were very powerful, but he wasn't sure if they'd take him as quickly and readily as he needed to be taken.Then there were the tribes that people just made up out of thin air the synthetic phyles but most of them were based on some shared skill or weird idea or ritual that he wouldn't be able to pick up in half an hour.Finally, sometime around midnight, he wandered past a man in a funny gray jacket and cap with a red star on it, trying to give away little red books, and it hit him: Sendero.Most Senderistas were either Incan or Korean, but they'd take anyone.They had a nice clave here in the Leased Territories, a clave with good security, and every one of them, down to the last man or woman, was batshit.They'd be more than a match for a few dozen Ashantis.And you could join anytime just by walking in the gates.They would take anyone, no questions asked.He'd heard it was not such a good thing to be a Communist, but under the circumstances he figured he could hold his nose and quote from the little red book as necessary.As soon as those Ashantis left town, he'd bolt.Once he made up his mind, he couldn't wait to get there.He had to restrain himself from breaking into a jog, which would be sure to draw the attention of any Ashantis on the street.He couldn't bear the idea of being so close to safety and then blowing it.He rounded a corner and saw the wall of the Sendero Clave; four stories high and two blocks long, one solid giant mediatron with a tiny gate in the middle.Mao was on one end, waving to an unseen multitude, backed up by his horsetoothed wife and his beetle browed sidekick Lin Biao, and Chairman Gonzalo was on the other, teaching some small children, and in the middle was a slogan in ten meter high letters: STRIVE TO UPHOLD THE PRINCIPLES OF MAO GONZALO THOUGHT!The gate was guarded, as always, by a couple of twelve year old kids in red neckerchiefs and armbands, ancient bolt action rifles with real bayonets leaning against their collarbones.A blond white girl and a pudgy Asian boy.Bud and his son Harv had whiled away many an idle hour trying to get these kids to laugh: making silly faces, mooning them, telling jokes.Nothing ever worked.But he'd seen the ritual: They'd bar his path with crossed rifles and not let him in until he swore his undying allegiance to Mao Gonzalo thought, and then   A horse, or something built around the same general plan, was coming down the street at a hand gallop.Its hooves did not make the pocking noise of iron horseshoes.Bud realized it was a chevaline a four legged robot thingy.The man on the chev was an African in very colorful clothing.Bud recognized the patterns on that cloth and knew without bothering to check for the scar that the guy was Ashanti.As soon as he caught Bud's eye, he kicked it up another gear, to a tantivy.He was going to cut Bud off before he could reach Sendero.And he was too far away, yet, to be reached by the skull gun, whose infinitesimal bullets had a disappointingly short range.He heard a soft noise behind him and swiveled his head around, and something whacked him on the forehead and stuck there.A couple more Ashantis had snuck up on him barefoot."Sir," one of them said, "I would not recommend operation of your weapon, unless you want the round to detonate in your own forehead.Hey?"and he smiled broadly, enormous perfectly white teeth, and touched his own forehead.Bud reached up and felt something hard glued to the skin of his brow, right over the skull gun.The chev dropped to a trot and cut toward him.Suddenly Ashantis were everywhere.He wondered how long they'd been tracking him.They all had beautiful smiles.They all carried small devices in their hands, which they aimed at the pavement, trigger fingers laid alongside the barrels until the guy on the chev told them otherwise.Then, suddenly, they all seemed to be aimed in his direction.The projectiles stuck to his skin and clothing and burst sideways, flinging out yards and yards of weightless filmy stuff that stuck to itself and shrank.One struck him in the back of the head, and a swath of the stuff whipped around his face and encased it.It was about as thick as a soap bubble, and so he could see through it pretty well it had peeled one of his eyelids back so he couldn't help but see and everything now had that gorgeous rainbow tinge characteristic of soap bubbles.The entire shrink wrapping process consumed maybe half a second, and then Bud, mummified in plastic, toppled over face forward.One of the Ashantis was good enough to catch him.They laid him down on the Street and rolled him over on his back.Someone poked the blade of a pocketknife through the film over Bud's mouth so that he could breathe again.Several Ashantis set about the chore of bonding handles to the shrinkwrap, two up near the shoulders and two down by the ankles, as the man on the chev dismounted and knelt over him.This equestrian had several prominent scars on his cheeks."Sir," the man said, smiling, "I accuse you of violating certain provisions of the Common Economic Protocol, which I will detail at a more convenient time, and I hereby place you under personal arrest.Please be aware that anyone who has been so arrested is subject to deadly force in the event he tries to resist which ha!ha!does not seem likely at present but it is a part of the procedure that I am to say this.As this territory belongs to a nation state that recognizes the Common Economic Protocol, you are entitled to a hearing of any such charges within the judicial framework of the nation state in question, which in this case happens to be the Chinese Coastal Republic.This nation state may or may not grant you additional rights; we will find out in a very few moments, when we present the situation to one of the relevant authorities.Ah, I believe I see one now. "A constable from the Shanghai Police, legs strapped into a pedomotive, was coming down the street with the tremendous loping strides afforded by such devices, escorted by a couple of power skating Ashantis.The Ashantis had big smiles, but the constable looked stereotypically inscrutable.The chief of the Ashantis bowed to the constable and graciously spun out another lengthy quotation from the fine print of the Common Economic Protocol.The constable kept making a gesture that was somewhere between a nod and a perfunctory bow.Then the constable turned to Bud and said, very fast: "Are you a member of any signatory tribe, phyle, registered diaspora, franchise organized quasi national entity, sovereign polity, or any other form of dynamic security collective claiming status under the CEP?""Are you shitting me?"Bud said.The shrink wrap squished his mouth together so he sounded like a duck.Four Ashantis took the four handles and hoisted Bud off the ground.They began to follow the loping constable in the direction of the Causeway that led over the sea to Shanghai."How 'bout it," Bud quacked through the hole in the shrink wrap, "he said I might have other rights.Do I have any other rights?"The constable looked back over his shoulder, turning his head carefully so he wouldn't lose his balance on that pedomotive."Don't be a jerk," he said in pretty decent English, "this is China. "Hackworth's morning ruminations;  breakfast and departure for work.Thinking about tomorrow's crime, John Percival Hackworth slept poorly, rising three times on the pretext of having to use the loo.Each time he looked in on Fiona, who was sprawled out in her white lace nightgown, arms above her head, doing a backflip into the arms of Morpheus.Her face was barely visible in the dark room, like the moon seen through folds of white silk.At five A. M. , a shrill pentatonic reveille erupted from the North Koreans' brutish mediatrons.Their clave, which went by the name Sendero, was not far above sea level: a mile below the Hackworths' building in altitude, and twenty degrees warmer on the average day.But whenever the women's chorus chimed in with their armor piercing refrain about the all seeing beneficence of the Serene Leader, it felt as if they were right next door.Gwendolyn didn't even stir.She would sleep soundly for another hour, or until Tiffany Sue, her lady's maid, came bustling into the room and began to lay out her clothes: stretchy lingerie for the morning workout, a business frock, hat, gloves, and veil for later.Hackworth drew a silk dressing gown from the wardrobe and poured it over his shoulders.Binding the sash around his waist, the cold tassels splashing over his fingers in the dark, he glanced through the doorway to Gwendolyn's closet and out the other side into her boudoir.Against that room's far windows was the desk she used for social correspondence, really just a table with a top of genuine marble, strewn with bits of stationery, her own and others', dimly identifiable even at this distance as business cards, visiting cards, note cards, invitations from various people still going through triage.Most of the boudoir floor was covered with a tatty carpet, worn through in places all the way down to its underlying matrix of jute, but hand woven and sculpted by genuine Chinese slave labor during the Mao Dynasty.Its only real function was to protect the floor from Gwendolyn's exercise equipment, which gleamed in the dim light scattering off the clouds from Shanghai: a step unit done up in Beaux Arts ironmongery, a rowing machine cleverly fashioned of writhing sea serpents and hard bodied nereids, a rack of free weights supported by four callipygious caryatids not chunky Greeks but modern women, one of each major racial group, each tricep, gluteus, latissimus, sartorius, and rectus abdominus casting its own highlight.Classical architecture indeed.The caryatids were supposed to be role models, and despite subtle racial differences, each body fit the current ideal: twenty two inch waist, no more than 17% body fat.That kind of body couldn't be faked with undergarments, never mind what the ads in the women's magazines claimed; the long tight bodices of the current mode, and modern fabrics thinner than soap bubbles, made everything obvious.Most women who didn't have superhuman willpower couldn't manage it without the help of a lady's maid who would run them through two or even three vigorous workouts a day.So after Fiona had stopped breast feeding and the time had loomed when Gwen would have to knacker her maternity clothes, they had hired Tiffany Sue just another one of the child related expenses Hackworth had never imagined until the bills had started to come in.Gwen accused him, half seriously, of having eyes for Tiffany Sue.The accusation was almost a standard formality of modern marriage, as lady's maids were all young, pretty, and flawlessly buffed.But Tiffany Sue was a typical thete, loud and classless and heavily made up, and Hackworth couldn't abide her.If he had eyes for anyone, it was those caryatids holding up the weight rack; at least they had impeccable taste going for them.Mrs.Hull had not heard him and was still bumping sleepily around in her quarters.Hackworth put a crumpet into the toaster oven and went out on their flat's tiny balcony with a cup of tea, catching a bit of the auroral breeze off the Yangtze Estuary.The Hackworths' building was one of several lining a block long garden where a few early risers were already out walking their spaniels or touching their toes.Far down the slopes of New Chusan, the Leased Territories were coming awake: the Senderos streaming out of their barracks and lining up in the streets to chant and sing through their morning calisthenics.All the other thetes, coarcted into the tacky little claves belonging to their synthetic phyles, turning up their own mediatrons to drown out the Senderos, setting off firecrackers or guns he could never tell them apart and a few internal combustion hobbyists starting up their primitive full lane vehicles, the louder the better.Commuters lining up at the tube stations, waiting to cross the Causeway into Greater Shanghai, seen only as a storm front of neon stained, coal scented smog that encompassed the horizon.This neighborhood was derisively called Earshot.But Hackworth didn't mind the noise so much.It would have been a sign of better breeding, or higher pretentions, to be terribly sensitive about it, to complain of it all the time, and to yearn for a townhouse or even a small estate farther inland.Finally the bells of St.Mark's chimed six o'clock.Mrs.Hull burst into the kitchen on the first stroke and expressed shame that Hackworth had beaten her to the kitchen and shock that he had defiled it.The matter compiler in the corner of the kitchen came on automatically and began to create a pedomotive for Hackworth to take to work.Before the last bell had died away, the rhythmic whack whack whack of a big vacuum pump could be heard.The engineers of the Royal Vacuum Utility were already at work expanding the eutactic environment.The pumps sounded big, probably Intrepids, and Hackworth reckoned that they must be preparing to raise a new structure, possibly a wing of the University.He sat down at the kitchen table.Mrs.Hull was already marmalading his crumpet.As she laid out plates and silver, Hackworth picked up a large sheet of blank paper."The usual," he said, and then the paper was no longer blank; now it was the front page of the Times.Hackworth got all the news that was appropriate to his station in life, plus a few optional services: the latest from his favorite cartoonists and columnists around the world; clippings on various peculiar crackpot subjects forwarded to him by his father, ever anxious that he had not, even after all this time, sufficiently edified his son; and stories relating to the Uitlanders a subphyle of New Atlantis, consisting of persons of British ancestry who had fled South Africa several decades previously.Hackworth's mother was an Uitlander, so he subscribed to the service.A gentleman of higher rank and more far reaching responsibilities would probably get different information written in a different way, and the top stratum of New Chusan actually got the Times on paper, printed out by a big antique press that did a run of a hundred or so, every morning at about three A. M.  That the highest levels of the society received news written with ink on paper said much about the steps New Atlantis had taken to distinguish itself from other phyles.Now nanotechnology had made nearly anything possible, and so the cultural role in deciding what should be done with it had become far more important than imagining what could be done with it.One of the insights of the Victorian Revival was that it was not necessarily a good thing for everyone to read a completely different newspaper in the morning; so the higher one rose in the society, the more similar one's Times became to one's peers'.Hackworth almost managed to dress without waking Gwendolyn, but she began to stir while he was stringing his watch chain around various tiny buttons and pockets in his waistcoat.In addition to the watch, various other charms dangled from it, such as a snuffbox that helped perk him up now and then, and a golden pen that made a little chime whenever he received mail."Have a good day at work, dear," she mumbled.Then, blinking once or twice, frowning, and focusing on the chintz canopy over the bed: "You finish it today, do you?""Yes," Hackworth said."I'll be home late.Quite late. ""I understand. ""No," he blurted.Then he pulled himself up short.This was it, he realized."Darling?""It's not that the project should finish itself.But after work, I believe I'll get a surprise for Fiona.Something special. ""Being home for dinner would be more special than anything you could get her. ""No, darling.This is different.I promise. "He kissed her and went to the stand by the front door.Mrs.Hull was awaiting him, holding his hat in one hand and his briefcase in the other.She had already removed the pedomotive from the M. C.  and set it by the door for him; it was smart enough to know that it was indoors, and so its long legs were fully collapsed, giving him almost no mechanical advantage.Hackworth stepped onto the tread plates and felt the straps reach out and hug his legs.He told himself that he could still back out.But a flash of red caught his eye, and he looked in and saw Fiona creeping down the hallway in her nightie, her flaming hair flying all directions, getting ready to surprise Gwendolyn, and the look in her eyes told him that she had heard everything.He blew her a kiss and walked out the door, resolute.Bud is prosecuted;  noteworthy features of the Confucian judicial system;  he receives an invitation to take a long walk on a short pier.Bud had spent the last several days living in the open, in a prison on the low, smelly delta of the Chang Jiang (as most of his thousands of fellow inmates called it) or, as Bud called it, the Yangtze.The walls of the prison were lines of bamboo stakes, spaced at intervals of a few meters, with strips of orange plastic fluttering gaily from their tops.Yet another device had been mounted on Bud's bones, and it knew where those boundaries were.From place to place one could see a corpse just on the other side of the line, body striped with the lurid marks of cookie cutters.Bud had mistaken these for suicides until he'd seen a lynching in progress: a prisoner who was thought to have stolen some other fellow's shoes was picked up bodily by the mob, passed from hand to hand overhead like a crowd surfing rock singer, all the time flailing frantically trying to grab something.When he reached the line of bamboo poles, he was given one last shove and ejected, his body virtually exploding as he flew through the invisible plane of the perimeter.But the ever present threat of lynching was a minor irritation compared to the mosquitoes.So when Bud heard the voice in his ears telling him to report to the northeast corner of the compound, he didn't waste any time partly because he wanted to get away from that place and partly because, if he didn't, they could pop him by remote control.They could have just told him to walk directly to the courtroom and take a seat and he would have done it, but for ceremonial purposes they sent a cop to escort him.The courtroom was a high ceilinged room in one of the old buildings along the Bund, not lavishly furnished.At one end was a raised platform, and on that was an old folding table with a red cloth tossed over it.The red cloth had gold threads woven through it to make a design: a unicorn or a dragon or some shit like that.Bud had trouble discriminating among mythical beasts.The judge came in and was introduced as Judge Fang by the larger of his two gofers: a bulky, rounded headed Chinese guy who smelled tantalizingly of menthol cigarettes.The constable who had escorted Bud to the courtroom pointed to the floor, and Bud, knowing his cue, dropped to his knees and touched his forehead to the floor.The Judge's other gofer was a tiny little Amerasian woman wearing glasses.Hardly anyone used glasses anymore to correct their vision, and so it was a likely bet that this was actually some kind of phantascope, which let you see things that weren't there, such as ractives.Although, when people used them for purposes other than entertainment, they used a fancier word: phenomenoscope.You could get a phantascopic system planted directly on your retinas, just as Bud's sound system lived on his eardrums.You could even get telsthetics patched into your spinal column at various key vertebrae.But this was said to have its drawbacks: some concerns about long term nerve damage, plus it was rumored that hackers for big media companies had figured out a way to get through the defenses that were built into such systems, and run junk advertisements in your peripheral vision (or even spang in the fucking middle) all the time even when your eyes were closed.Bud knew a guy like that who'd somehow gotten infected with a meme that ran advertisements for roach motels, in Hindi, superimposed on the bottom right hand corner of his visual field, twenty four hours a day, until the guy whacked himself.Judge Fang was surprisingly young, probably not out of his thirties yet.He sat at the red cloth covered table and started to talk in Chinese.His two gofers stood behind him.A Sikh was here; he stood up and said a few words back to the Judge in Chinese.Bud couldn't figure out why there was a Sikh here, but he'd become accustomed to Sikhs turning up where they were least sought.Judge Fang said in a New York City accent, "The representative from Protocol has suggested that we conduct these proceedings in English.Any objections?"Also present was the guy he had mugged, who was holding the one arm rather stiffly but seemed otherwise healthy.His wife was with him too."I'm Judge Fang," the Judge continued, looking straight at Bud."You can address me as Your Honor.Now, Bud, Mr.Kwamina here has accused you of certain activities that are illegal in the Coastal Republic.You are also accused of actionable offenses under the Common Economic Protocol, to which we are a subscriber.These offenses are closely related to the crimes I already mentioned, but slightly different.Are you getting all this?""Not exactly, Your Honor," Bud said."We think you mugged this guy and blew a hole in his arm," Judge Fang said, "which is frowned upon.Capiche?""Yes, sir. "Judge Fang nodded at the Sikh, who took the cue."The CEP code," said the Sikh, "governs all kinds of economic interactions between people and organizations.Theft is one such interaction.Maiming is another, insofar as it affects the victim's ability to fend for himself economically.As Protocol does not aspire to sovereign status, we work in cooperation with the indigenous justice system of CEP signatories in order to pursue such cases. ""You familiar with the Confucian system of justice, Bud?"said Judge Fang.Bud's head was beginning to get dizzy from snapping back and forth like a spectator at a tennis match."I'm guessing no.Okay, even though the Chinese Coastal Republic is no longer strictly or even vaguely Confucian, we still run our judicial system that way we've had it for a few thousand years, and we think it's not half bad.The general idea is that as judge, I actually perform several roles at once: detective, judge, jury, and if need be, executioner. "Bud snickered at this crack, then noticed that Judge Fang did not appear to be in an especially jocose mood.His New Yorkish ways had initially fooled Bud into thinking that Judge Fang was something of a Regular Guy."So in the first mentioned role," Judge Fang continued, "I would like for you, Mr.Kwamina, to tell me whether you recognize the suspect. ""He is the man," said Mr.Kwamina, aiming one index finger at Bud's forehead, "who threatened me, shot me, and stole my money. ""And Mrs.Kum?"Judge Fang said.Then, as an aside to Bud, he added, "In their culture, the woman does not adopt her husband's family name. "Mrs.Kum just nodded at Bud and said, "He is the guilty party. ""Miss Pao, do you have anything to add?"The tiny woman in the spectacles looked at Bud and said, in Texan accented English, "From this man's forehead I removed a voice activated nanoprojectile launcher, colloquially known as a skull gun, loaded with three types of ammunition, including so called Crippler rounds of the type used against Mr.Kwamina.Nanopresence examination of the serial numbers on those rounds, and comparison of the same with fragments removed from Mr.Kwamina's wound, indicated that the round used on Mr.Kwamina was fired from the gun embedded in the suspect's forehead. ""Dang," Bud said."Okay," Judge Fang said, and reached up with one hand to rub his temples for just a moment.Then he turned to Bud."You're guilty. "Hey!Don't I get to put up a defense?"Bud said."I object!""Don't be an asshole," Judge Fang said.The Sikh said, "As the offender has no significant assets, and as the value of his labor would not be sufficient to compensate the victim for his injury, Protocol terminates its interest in this case. ""Got it," Judge Fang said."Okay, Bud, my man, do you have any dependents?""I got a girlfriend," Bud said."She's got a son named Harv who is my boy, unless we counted wrong.And I heard she's pregnant. ""You think she is, or you know she is?""She was last time I checked a couple months ago. ""What's her name?""Tequila. "A muffled snort came from one of the Protocol trainees the young woman who put one hand over her mouth.The Sikh appeared to be biting his lip."Tequila?"Judge Fang said, incredulous.It was becoming clear that Judge Fang tried a lot of these cases and relished the odd scrap of entertainment value."There are nineteen women named Tequila in the Leased Territories," said Miss Pao, reading something out of her phenomenoscope, "one of whom delivered a baby girl named Nellodee three days ago.She also has a five year old boy named Harvard. ""Oh, wow," Bud said."Congratulations, Bud, you're a pa," Judge Fang said."I gather from your reaction that this comes as something of a surprise.It seems evident that your relationship with this Tequila is tenuous, and so I do not find that there are any mitigating circumstances I should take into account in sentencing.That being the case, I would like you to go out that door over there" Judge Fang pointed to a door in the corner of the courtroom " and all the way down the steps.Leave through the exit door and cross the street, and you will find a pier sticking out into the river.Walk to the end of that pier until you are standing on the red part and await further instructions. "Bud moved tentatively at first, but Judge Fang gestured impatiently, so finally he went out the door and down the stairway and out onto the Bund, the street that ran along the waterfront of the Huang Pu River, and that was lined with big old European style buildings.A pedestrian tunnel took him under the road to the actual waterfront, which was crowded with Chinese people strolling around, and legless wretches dragging themselves hither and thither.Some middle aged Chinese people had set up a sound system playing archaic music and were ballroom dancing.The music and dance style would have been offensively quaint to Bud at any other point in his life, but now for some reason the sight of these somewhat fleshy, settled looking people, twirling around gently in one another's arms, made him feel sad.Eventually he found the right pier.As he strolled out onto it, he had to shoulder his way past some slopes carrying a long bundle wrapped in cloth, who were trying to get onto the pier ahead of him.The view was nice here; the old buildings of the Bund behind him, the vertiginous neon wall of the Pudong Economic Zone exploding from the opposite bank and serving as backdrop for heavy river traffic mostly chains of low lying barges.The pier did not turn red until the very end, where it began to slope down steeply toward the river.It had been coated with some kind of grippy stuff so his feet wouldn't fly out from under him.He turned around and looked back up at the domed court building, searching for a window where he might make out the face of Judge Fang or one of his gofers.The family of Chinese was following him down the pier, carrying their long bundle, which was draped with garlands of flowers and, as Bud now realized, was probably the corpse of a family member.He had heard about these piers; they were called funeral piers.Several dozen of the microscopic explosives known as cookie cutters detonated in his bloodstream.Nell learns to work the matter compiler;  youthful indiscretions;  all is made better.Nell had grown too long for her old crib mattress, and so Harv, her big brother, said he would help get a new one.He was big enough, he offhandedly mentioned, to do that sort of thing.Nell followed him into the kitchen, which housed several important boxy entities with prominent doors.Some were warm, some cool, some had windows, some made noises.Nell had frequently seen Harv, or Tequila, or one of Tequila's boyfriends, removing food from them, in one stage or another of doneness.One of the boxes was called the M. C.  It was built into the wall over the counter.Nell dragged a chair and climbed up to watch as Harv worked at it.The front of the M. C.  was a mediatron, which meant anything that had pictures moving around on it, or sound coming out of it, or both.As Harv poked it with his fingers and spoke to it, little moving pictures danced around.It reminded her of the ractives she played on the big mediatron in the living room, when it wasn't being used by someone bigger."What are those?"Nell said."Mediaglyphics," Harv said coolly."Someday you'll learn how to read. "Nell could already read some of them."Red or blue?"Harv asked magnanimously."Red. "Harv gave it an especially dramatic poke, and then a new mediaglyphic came up, a white circle with a narrow green wedge at the top.The wedge got wider and wider.The M. C.  played a little tune that meant you were supposed to wait.Harv went to the fridge and got himself a juice box and one for Nell too.He looked at the M. C.  disdainfully."This takes so long, it's ridiculous," he said."Why?""'Cause we got a cheap Feed, just a few grams per second.Pathetic. ""Why do we got a cheap Feed?""Because it's a cheap house. ""Why is it a cheap house?""Because that's all we can afford because of the economics," Harv said."Mom's gotta compete with all kinds of Chinese and stuff that don't have any self respect and so they'll work for nothing.So Mom's gotta work for nothing. "He looked at the M. C.  again and shook his head."Pathetic.At the Flea Circus they got a Feed that's, like, this big around. "He touched his fingertips together in front of him and made a big circle with his arms."But this one's probly like the size of your pinkie. "He stepped away from the M. C.  as if he could no longer stand to share a room with it, sucked powerfully on his juice box, and wandered into the living room to get in a ractive.Nell just watched the green wedge get bigger and bigger until it filled half the circle, and then it began to look like a green circle with a white wedge in it, getting narrower and narrower, and finally the music came to a bouncy conclusion just as the white wedge vanished."It's done!"she said.Harv paused his ractive, swaggered into the kitchen, and poked a mediaglyphic that was an animated picture of a door swinging open.The M. C.  took to hissing loudly.Harv watched her scared face and ruffled her hair; she could not fend him off because she had her hands over her ears."Got to release the vacuum," he explained.The sound ended, and the door popped open.Inside the M. C. , folded up neatly, was Nell's new red mattress."Give it to me!Give it to me!"Nell shouted, furious to see Harv's hands on it.Harv amused himself for a second playing keep away, then gave it to her.She ran to the room that she shared with Harv and slammed the door as hard as she could.Dinosaur, Duck, Peter, and Purple were waiting for her."I got us a new bed," she told them.She grabbed her old crib mattress and heaved it into the corner, then unfolded the new one precisely on the floor.It was disappointingly thin, more blanket than mattress.But when she had it all laid out on the floor, it made a whooshing noise not loud the sound of her brother's breathing late at night.It thickened as it inhaled, and when it was done, it looked like a real mattress.She gathered Dinosaur and Duck and Peter and Purple up into her arms and then, just to make sure, jumped up and down on it several hundred times."You like it?"Harv said.He had opened the door."No!Get out!"Nell screamed."Nell, it's my room too," Harv said."I gotta deke your old one. "Later, Harv went out with his buddies, and Nell was alone in the house for a while.She had decided that her kids needed mattresses too, and so she dragged the chair to the counter and climbed up on top, right in front of the M. C. , and tried to read the mediaglyphics.A lot of them she didn't recognize.But she remembered that Tequila just used words when she couldn't read something, so she tried talking to it instead."Please secure the permission of an adult," the M. C.  said, over and over again.Now she knew why Harv always poked at things rather than talking to them.She poked at the M. C.  for a long time until finally she came to the same mediaglyphics that Harv had used to choose her mattress.One showed a man and woman sleeping in a very large bed.A man and woman in a somewhat smaller bed.A man by himself.A child by herself.A baby.Nell poked at the baby.The white circle and red wedge appeared, the music played, the M. C.  hissed and opened.She spread it out on the floor and formally presented it to Dinosaur, who was too little to know how to jump up and down on it; so Nell showed him for a while.Then she went back to the M. C.  and got mattresses for Duck, Peter, and Purple.Now, much of the room was covered with mattresses, and she thought how fun it would be to have the whole room just be one big mattress, so she made a couple of the very largest size.Then she made a new mattress for Tequila and another new one for her boyfriend Rog.When Harv came back, his reaction swerved between terror and awe."Mom's gonna have Rog beat the shit out of us," he said."We gotta deke all this stuff now. "Easy come, easy go.Nell explained the situation to her kids and then helped Harv stuff all of the mattresses, except her own, into the deke hopper.Harv had to use all his strength to shove the door closed."Now we just better hope this stuff all dekes before Mom gets home," he said."It's gonna take a while. "Later they went to bed and both lay awake for a while, dreading the sound of the front door opening.But neither Mom nor Rog came home that night.Mom finally showed up in the morning, changed into her maid outfit, and ran for the bus to the Vicky Clave, but she just left all her garbage on the floor instead of throwing it in the hopper.When Harv checked the hopper later, it was empty."We dodged a bullet," he said."You gotta be careful how you use the matter compiler, Nell. ""What's a matter compiler?""We call it the M. C.  for short. ""Why?""Because M. C.  stands for matter compiler, or so they say. ""Why?""It just does.In letters, I guess. ""What are letters?""Kinda like mediaglyphics except they're all black, and they're tiny, they don't move, they're old and boring and really hard to read.But you can use 'em to make short words for long words. "Hackworth arrives at work;  a visit to the Design Works;  Mr.Cotton's vocation.Rain beaded on the specular toes of Hackworth's boots as he strode under the vaulting wrought iron gate.The little beads reflected the silvery gray light of the sky as they rolled off onto the pedomotive's tread plates, and dripped to the gray brown cobblestones with each stride.Hackworth excused himself through a milling group of uncertain Hindus.Their hard shoes were treacherous on the cobblestones, their chins were in the air so that their high white collars would not saw their heads off.They had arisen many hours ago in their tiny high rise warrens, their human coin lockers on the island south of New Chusan, which was Hindustani.They had crossed into Shanghai in the wee hours on autoskates and velocipedes, probably paid off some policemen, made their way to the Causeway joining New Chusan to the city.MachinePhase Systems Limited knew that they were coming, because they came every day.The company could have set up an employment office closer to the Causeway, or even in Shanghai itself.But the company liked to have job seekers come all the way to the main campus to fill out their applications.The difficulty of getting here prevented people from coming on a velleity, and the eternal presence of these people like starlings peering down hungrily at a picnic reminded everyone who was lucky enough to have a job that others were waiting to take their place.The Design Works emulated a university campus, in more ways than its architects had really intended.If a campus was a green quadrilateral described by hulking, hederated Gothics, then this was a campus.But if a campus was also a factory of sorts, most of whose population sat in rows and columns in large stuffy rooms and did essentially the same things all day, then the Design Works was a campus for that reason too.Hackworth detoured through Merkle Hall.It was Gothic and very large, like most of the Design Works.Its vaulted ceiling was decorated with a hard fresco consisting of paint on plaster.Since this entire building, except for the fresco, had been grown straight from the Feed, it would have been easier to build a mediatron into the ceiling and set it to display a soft fresco, which could have been changed from time to time.But neo Victorians almost never used mediatrons.Hard art demanded commitment from the artist.It could only be done once, and if you screwed it up, you had to live with the consequences.The centerpiece of the fresco was a flock of cybernetic cherubs, each shouldering a spherical atom, converging on some central work in progress, a construct of some several hundred atoms, radially symmetric, perhaps intended to look like a bearing or motor.Brooding over the whole thing, quite large but obviously not to scale, was a white coated Engineer with a monocular nanophenomenoscope strapped to his head.No one really used them because you couldn't get depth perception, but it looked better on the fresco because you could see the Engineer's other eye, steel blue, dilated, scanning infinity like the steel oculus of Arecibo.With one hand the Engineer stroked his waxed mustache.The other was thrust into a nanomanipulator, and it was made obvious, through glorious overuse of radiant tromp l'oeil, that the atom humping cherubs were all dancing to his tune, naiads to the Engineer's Neptune.The corners of the fresco were occupied with miscellaneous busywork; in the upper left, Feynman and Drexler and Merkle, Chen and Singh and Finkle McGraw reposed on a numinous buckyball, some of them reading books and some pointing toward the work in progress in a manner that implied constructive criticism.In the upper right was Queen Victoria II, who managed to look serene despite the gaudiness of her perch, a throne of solid diamond.The bottom fringe of the work was crowded with small figures, mostly children with the occasional longsuffering mom, ordered chronologically.On the left were the spirits of generations past who had showed up too early to enjoy the benefits of nanotechnology and (not explicitly shown, but somewhat ghoulishly implied) croaked from obsolete causes such as cancer, scurvy, boiler explosions, derailments, drive by shootings, pogroms, blitzkriegs, mine shaft collapses, ethnic cleansing, meltdowns, running with scissors, eating Drano, heating a cold house with charcoal briquets, and being gored by oxen.Surprisingly, none of them seemed sullen; they were all watching the activities of the Engineer and his cherubic workforce, their cuddly, uplifted faces illuminated by the light streaming from the center, liberated (as Hackworth the engineer literal mindedly supposed) by the binding energy of the atoms as they plummeted into their assigned potential wells.The children in the center had their backs to Hackworth and were mostly seen in silhouette, looking directly up and raising their arms toward the light.The kids in bottom right balanced the angelic host on the bottom left; these were the spirits of unborn children yet to benefit from the Engineer's work, though they certainly looked eager to get born as soon as possible.Their backdrop was a luminescent, undulous curtain, much like the aurora, which was actually a continuation of the flowing skirts of Victoria II seated on her throne above."Pardon me, Mr.Cotton," Hackworth said, almost sotto voce.He had worked here once, for several years, and knew the etiquette.A hundred designers were sitting in the hall, neatly arranged in rows.All had their heads wrapped up in phenomenoscopes.The only persons who were aware of Hackworth's presence in the hall were Supervising Engineer Dung, his lieutenants Chu, DeGrado, and Beyerley, and a few water boys and couriers standing erect at their stations around the perimeter.It was bad form to startle the engineers, so you approached them loudly and spoke to them softly."Good morning, Mr.Hackworth," Cotton said."Good morning, Demetrius.Take your time. ""I'll be with you in a moment, sir. "Cotton was a southpaw.His left hand was in a black glove.Laced through it was a network of invisibly tiny rigid structures, motors, position sensors, and tactile stimulators.The sensors kept track of his hand's position, how much each joint of each knuckle was bent, and so on.The rest of the gear made him feel as though he were touching real objects.The glove's movements were limited to a roughly hemispherical domain with a radius of about one cubit; as long as his elbow stayed on or near its comfy elastomeric rest, his hand was free.The glove was attached to a web of infinitesimal wires that emerged from filatories placed here and there around the workstation.The filatories acted like motorized reels, taking up slack and occasionally pulling the glove one way or another to simulate external forces.In fact they were not motors but little wire factories that generated wire when it was needed and, when slack needed to be taken up or a wire needed a tug, sucked it back in and digested it.Each wire was surrounded by a loose accordion sleeve a couple of millimeters in diameter, which was there for safety, lest visitors stick their hands in and slice off fingers on the invisible wires.Cotton was working with some kind of elaborate structure consisting, probably, of several hundred thousand atoms.Hackworth could see this because each workstation had a mediation providing a two dimensional view of what the user was seeing.This made it easy for the supervisors to roam up and down the aisles and see at a glance what each employee was up to.The structures these people worked with seemed painfully bulky to Hackworth, even though he'd done it himself for a few years.The people here in Merkle Hall were all working on mass market consumer products, which by and large were not very demanding.They worked in symbiosis with big software that handled repetitive aspects of the job.It was a fast way to design products, which was essential when going after the fickle and impressionable consumer market.But systems designed that way always ended up being enormous.An automated design system could always make something work by throwing more atoms at it.Every engineer in this hall, designing those nanotechnological toasters and hair dryers, wished he could have Hackworth's job in Bespoke, where concinnity was an end in itself, where no atom was wasted and every subsystem was designed specifically for the task at hand.Such work demanded intuition and creativity, qualities neither abundant nor encouraged here in Merkle Hall.But from time to time, over golf or karaoke or cigars, Dung or one of the other supervisors would mention some youngster who showed promise.Because Lord Alexander Chung Sik Finkle McGraw was paying for Hackworth's current project, the Young Lady's Illustrated Primer, price was no object.The Duke would brook no malingering or corner cutting, so everything was as start as Bespoke could make it, every atom could be justified.Even so, there was nothing especially interesting about the power supply being created for the Primer, which consisted of batteries of the same kind used to run everything from toys to airships.So Hackworth had farmed that part of the job out to Cotton, just to see whether he had potential.Cotton's gloved hand fluttered and probed like a stuck horsefly in the center of the black web.On the mediatronic screen attached to his workstation, Hackworth saw that Cotton was gripping a medium size (by Merkie Hall standards) subassembly, presumably belonging to some much larger nanotechnological system.The standard color scheme used in these phenomenoscopes depicted carbon atoms in green, sulfur in yellow, oxygen in red, and hydrogen in blue.Cotton's assembly, as seen from a distance, was generally turquoise because it consisted mostly of carbon and hydrogen, and because Hackworth's point of view was so far away that the thousands of individual atoms all blended together.It was a gridwork of long, straight, but rather bumpy rods laid across each other at right angles.Hackworth recognized it as a rod logic system a mechanical computer.Cotton was trying to snap it together with some larger part.From this Hackworth inferred that the auto assembly process (which Cotton would have tried first) hadn't worked quite right, and so now Cotton was trying to maneuver the part into place by hand.This wouldn't fix what was wrong with it, but the telsthetic feedback coming into his hand through those wires would give him insight as to which bumps were lining up with which holes and which weren't.It was an intuitive approach to the job, a practice furiously proscribed by the lecturers at the Royal Nanotechnological Institute but popular among Hackworth's naughty, clever colleagues."Okay," Cotton finally said, "I see the problem. "His hand relaxed.On the mediatron, the subassembly drifted away from the main group under its own momentum, then slowed, stopped, and began to fall back toward it, drawn in by weak van den Waals forces.Cotton's right hand was resting on a small chordboard; he whacked a key that froze the simulation, then, as Hackworth noted approvingly, groped the keys for a few seconds, typing in some documentation.Meanwhile he was withdrawing his left hand from the glove and using it to pull the rig off his head; its straps and pads left neat indentations in the nap of his hair."Is this the smart makeup?"Hackworth said, nodding at the screen."The next step beyond," Cotton said."Remote control. ""Controlled how?Yuvree?"Hackworth said, meaning Universal Voice Recognition Interface."A specialised variant thereof, yes sir," Cotton said.Then, lowering his voice, "Word has it they considered makeup with nanoreceptors for galvanic skin response, pulse, respiration, and so on, so that it would respond to the wearer's emotional state.This superficial, need I say it, cosmetic issue concealed an undertow that pulled them out into deep and turbulent philosophical waters "  "What?Philosophy of makeup?""Think about it, Mr.Hackworth is the function of makeup to respond to one's emotions or precisely not to do so?""These waters are already over my head," Hackworth admitted."You'll be wanting to know about the power supply for Runcible," Cotton said, using the code name for the Illustrated Primer.Cotton had no idea what Runcible was, just that it needed a relatively long lived power supply."Yes. ""The modifications you requested are complete.I ran the tests you specified plus a few others that occurred to me all of them are documented here. "Cotton grabbed the heavy brasslike pull of his desk drawer and paused for a fraction of a second while the embedded fingerprint recognition logic did its work.The drawer unlocked itself, and Cotton pulled it open to reveal a timeless assortment of office drawer miscellany, including several sheets of paper some blank, some printed, some scrawled on, and one sheet that was blank except for the word RUNCIBLE printed at the top in Cotton's neat draughtsman's hand.Cotton pulled this one out and spoke to it: "Demetrius James Cotton transferring all privileges to Mr.Hackworth. ""John Percival Hackworth in receipt," Hackworth said, taking the page from Cotton."Thank you, Mr.Cotton. ""You're welcome, sir. ""Cover sheet," Hackworth said to the piece of paper, and then it had pictures and writing on it, and the pictures moved a schematic of a machine phase system cycling."If I'm not being too forward by enquiring," Cotton said, "will you be compiling Runcible soon?""Today most likely," Hackworth said."Please feel free to inform me of any glitches," Cotton said, just for the sake of form."Thank you, Demetrius," Hackworth said."Letter fold," he said to the piece of paper, and it creased itself neatly into thirds.Hackworth put it in the breast pocket of his jacket and walked out of Merkle Hall.Particulars of Nell & Harv's domestic situation;  Harv brings back a wonder.Whenever Nell's clothes got too small for her, Harv would pitch them into the deke bin and then have the M. C.  make new ones.Sometimes, if Tequila was going to take Nell someplace where they would see other moms with other daughters, she'd use the M. C.  to make Nell a special dress with lace and ribbons, so that the other moms would see how special Nell was and how much Tequila loved her.The kids would sit in front of the mediatron and watch a passive, and the moms would sit nearby and talk sometimes or watch the mediatron sometimes.Nell listened to them, especially when Tequila was talking, but she didn't really understand all the words.She knew, because Tequila repeated it often, that when Tequila got pregnant with Nell, she had been using something called the Freedom Machine a mite that lived in your womb and caught eggs and ate them.Victorians didn't believe in them, but you could buy them from Chinese and Hindustanis, who, of course, had no scruples.
