The import of the fight between mother and daughter had not been lost on this throng, and they must wonder why the audience continued.She returned her attention to al Fali."Ghadhean, what is this talk of Little Makers and the scarcity of sandworms?""Mother of Moisture," he said, using her old Fremen title, "we were warned of this in the Kitab al Ibar.We beseech thee.Let it not be forgotten that on the day Muad'Dib died, Arrakis turned by itself!We cannot abandon the desert. ""Hah!"Alia sneered."The superstitious riffraff of the Inner Desert fear the ecological transformation.They  "  "I hear you, Ghadhean," Jessica said."If the worms go, the spice goes.If the spice goes, what coin do we have to buy our way?"Sounds of surprise: gasps and startled whispers could be heard spreading across the Great Hall.The Chamber echoed to the sound.Alia shrugged."Superstitious nonsense!"Al Fali lifted his right hand to point at Alia."I speak to the Mother of Moisture, not to the Coan Teen!"Alia's hands gripped the arms of her throne, but she remained seated.Al Fali looked at Jessica."Once it was the land where nothing grew.Now there are plants.They spread like lice upon a wound.There have been clouds and rain along the belt of Dune!Rain, My Lady!Oh, precious mother of Muad'Dib, as sleep is death's brother, so is rain on the Belt of Dune.It is the death of us all. ""We do only what Liet Kynes and Muad'Dib himself designed for us to do," Alia protested."What is all of this superstitious gabble?We revere the words of Liet Kynes, who told us: 'I wish to see this entire planet caught up in a net of green plants. 'So it will be. ""And what of the worms and the spice?"Jessica asked."There'll always be some desert," Alia said."The worms will survive. "She's lying, Jessica thought.Why does she lie?"Help us, Mother of Moisture," al Fali pleaded.With an abrupt sensation of double vision, Jessica felt her awareness lurch, propelled by the old Naib's words.It was the unmistakable adab, the demanding memory which came upon one of itself.It came without qualifications and held her senses immobile while the lesson of the past was impressed upon her awareness.She was caught up in it completely, a fish in the net.Yet she felt the demand of it as a human most moment, each small part a reminder of creation.Every element of the lesson memory was real but insubstantial in its constant change, and she knew this was the closest she might ever come to experiencing the prescient dietgrasp which had inflicted itself upon her son.Alia lied because she was possessed by one who would destroy the Atreides.She was, in herself, the first destruction.Then al Fali spoke the truth: the sandworms are doomed unless the course of the ecological transformation is modified.In the pressure of revelation, Jessica saw the people of the audience reduced to slow motion, their roles identified for her.She could pick the ones charged with seeing that she did not leave here alive!And the path through them lay there in her awareness as though outlined in bright light   confusion among them, one of them feinted to stumble into another.Whole groups tangled.She saw, also, that she might leave this Great Hall only to fall into other hands.Alia did not care if she created a martyr.No   the thing which possessed her did not care.Now, in this frozen time, Jessica chose a way to save the old Naib and send him as messenger.The way through the audience remained indelibly clear.How simple it was!They were buffoons with barricaded eyes, their shoulders held in positions of immovable defense.Each position upon the great floor could be seen as an atropic collision from which dead flesh might slough away to reveal skeletons.Their bodies, their clothes, and their faces described individual hells   the insucked breast of concealed terrors, the glittering hook of a jewel become substitute armor; the mouths were judgments full of frightened absolutes, cathedral prisms of eyebrows showing lofty and religious sentiments which their loins denied.Jessica sensed dissolution in the shaping forces loosed upon Arrakis.Al Fali's voice had been like a distrans in her soul, awakening a beast from the deepest part of her.In an eyeblink Jessica moved from the adab into the universe of movement, but it was a different universe from the one which had commanded her attention only a second before.Alia was starting to speak, but Jessica said: "Silence!"Then: "There are those who fear that I have returned without reservation to the Sisterhood.But since that day in the desert when the Fremen gave the gift of life to me and to my son, I have been Fremen!"And she lapsed into the old tongue which only those in this room who could profit by it would understand: "Onsar akhaka zeiiman aw maslumen!"Support your brother in his time of need, whether he be just or unjust!Her words had the desired effect, a subtle shifting of positions within the Chamber.But Jessica raged on: "This Ghadhean al Fali, an honest Fremen, comes here to tell me what others should have revealed to me.Let no one deny this!The ecological transformation has become a tempest out of control!"Wordless confirmations could be seen throughout the room."And my daughter delights in this!"Jessica said."Mektub al mellah!You carve wounds upon my flesh and write there in salt!Why did the Atreides find a home here?Because the Mohalata was natural to us.To the Atreides, government was always a protective partnership: Mohalata, as the Fremen have always known it.Now look at her!"Jessica pointed at Alia."She laughs alone at night in contemplation of her own evil!Spice production will fall to nothing, or at best a fraction of its former level!And when word of that gets out  "  "We'll have a corner on the most priceless product in the universe!"Alia shouted."We'll have a corner on hell!"Jessica raged.And Alia lapsed into the most ancient Chakobsa, the Atreides private language with its difficult glottal stops and clicks: "Now, you know, mother!Did you think a granddaughter of Baron Harkonnen would not appreciate all of the lifetimes you crushed into my awareness before I was even born?When I raged against what you'd done to me, I had only to ask myself what the Baron would've done.And he answered!Understand me, Atreides bitch!He answered me!"Jessica heard the venom and the confirmation of her guess.Abomination!Alia had been overwhelmed within, possessed by that cahueit of evil, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.The Baron himself spoke from her mouth now, uncaring of what was revealed.He wanted her to see his revenge, wanted her to know that he could not be cast out.I'm supposed to remain here helpless in my knowledge, Jessica thought.With the thought, she launched herself onto the path the adab had revealed, shouting: "Fedaykin, follow me!"It turned out there were six Fedaykin in the room, and five of them won through behind her.= = = = = =   When I am weaker than you, I ask you for freedom because that is according to your principles; when I am stronger than you, I take away your freedom because that is according to my principles.Words of an ancient philosopher (Attributed by Harq al Ada to one Louis Veuillot)   Leto leaned out the covert exit from the sietch, saw the bight of the cliff towering above his limited view.Late afternoon sunlight cast long shadows in the cliff's vertical striations.A skeleton butterfly flew in and out of the shadows, its webbed wings a transparent lacery against the light.How delicate that butterfly was to exist here, he thought.Directly ahead of him lay the apricot orchard, with children working there to gather the fallen fruit.Beyond the orchard was the qanat.He and Ghanima had given the slip to their guards by losing themselves in a sudden crush of incoming workers.It had been a relatively simple matter to worm their way down an air passage to its connection with the steps to the covert exit.Now they had only to mingle themselves with the children, work their way to the qanat and drop into the tunnel.There they could move beside the predator fish which kept sandtrout from encysting the tribe's irrigation water.No Fremen would yet think of a human risking accidental immersion in water.He stepped out of the protective passages.The cliff stretched away on both sides of him, turned horizontal just by the act of his own movement.Ghanima moved closely behind him.Both carried small fruit baskets woven of spice fiber, but each basket carried a sealed package: Fremkit, maula pistol, crysknife...and the new robes sent by Farad'n.Ghanima followed her brother into the orchard, mingled with the working children.Stillsuit masks concealed every face.They were just two more workers here, but she felt the action drawing her life away from protective boundaries and known ways.What a simple step it was, that step from one danger into another!In their baskets those new garments sent by Farad'n conveyed a purpose well understood by both of them.Ghanima had accented this knowledge by sewing their personal motto, "We Share," in Chakobsa above the hawk crest at each breast.It would be twilight soon and, beyond the qanat which marked off sietch cultivation, there would come a special quality of evening which few places in the universe could match.It would be that softly lighted desert world with its persistent solitude, its saturated sense that each creature in it was alone in a new universe."We've been seen," Ghanima whispered, bending to work beside her brother."Guards?""No   others. ""Good. ""We must move swiftly," she said.Leto acknowledged this by moving away from the cliff through the orchard.He thought with his father's thoughts: Everything remains mobile in the desert or perishes.Far out on the sand he could see The Attendant's outcropping, reminder of the need for mobility.The rocks lay static and rigid in their watchful enigma, fading yearly before the onslaught of wind driven sand.One day The Attendant would be sand.As they neared the qanat they heard music from a high entrance of the sietch.It was an old style Fremen group   two holed flutes, tambourines, tympani made on spice plastic drums with skins stretched taut across one end.No one asked what animal on this planet provided that much skin.Stilgar will remember what I told him about that cleft in The Attendant, Leto thought.He'll come in the dark when it's too late   and then he'll know.Presently they were at the qanat.They slipped into an open tube, climbed down the inspection ladder to the service ledge.It was dusky, damp, and cold in the qanat and they could hear the predator fish splashing.Any sandtrout trying to steal this water would find its water softened inner surface attacked by the fish.Humans must be wary of them, too."Careful," Leto said, moving down the slippery ledge.He fastened his memory to times and places his flesh had never known.Ghanima followed.At the end of the qanat they stripped to their stillsuits and put on the new robes.They left the old Fremen robes behind as they climbed out another inspection tube, wormed their way over a dune and down the far side.There they sat shielded from the sietch, strapped on maula pistols and crysknives, slipped the Fremkit packs onto their shoulders.They no longer could hear the music.Leto arose, struck out through the valley between the dunes.Ghanima fell into step behind him, moving with practiced unrhythmical quiet over the open sand.Below the crest of each dune they bent low and crept across into the hidden lee, there to pause and peer backward seeking pursuit.No hunters had emerged upon the desert by the time they reached the first rocks.In the shadows of the rocks they worked their way around The Attendant, climbed to a ledge looking out upon the desert.Colors blinked far out on the bled.The darkening air held the fragility of fine crystal.The landscape which met their gaze was beyond pity, nowhere did it pause   no hesitations in it at all.The gaze stayed upon no single place in its scanning movements across that immensity.It is the horizon of eternity, Leto thought.Ghanima crouched beside her brother, thinking: The attack will come soon.She listened for the slightest sound, her whole body transformed into a single sense of taut probing.Leto sat equally alert.He knew now the culmination of all the training which had gone into the lives he shared so intimately.In this wilderness one developed a firm dependence upon the senses, all of the senses.Life became a hoard of stored perceptions, each one linked only to momentary survival.Presently Ghanima climbed up the rocks and peered through a notch at the way they had come.The safety of the sietch seemed a lifetime away, a bulk of dumb cliffs rising out of brown purple distance, dust blurred edges at the rim where the last of the sunlight cast its silver streaks.Still no pursuit could be seen in the intervening distance.She returned to Leto's side."It'll be a predatory animal," Leto said."That's my tertiary computation. ""I think you stopped computing too soon," Ghanima said."It'll be more than one animal.House Corrino has learned not to put all of its hopes into a single bag. "Leto nodded agreement.His mind felt suddenly heavy with the multitude of lives which his difference provided him: all of those lives, his even before birth.He was saturated with living and wanted to flee from his own consciousness.The inner world was a heavy beast which could devour him.Restlessly he arose, climbed to the notch Ghanima had used, peered at the cliffs of the sietch.Back there, beneath the cliff, he could see how the qanat drew a line between life and death.On the oasis edge he could see camel sage, onion grass, gobi feather grass, wild alfalfa.In the last of the light he could make out the black movements of birds pick hopping in the alfalfa.The distant grain tassels were ruffled by a wind which drew shadows that moved right up to the orchard.The motion caught at his awareness, and he saw that the shadows hid within their fluid form a larger change, and that larger change gave ransom to the turning rainbows of a silver dusted sky.What will happen out here?he asked himself.And he knew it would either be death or the play of death, himself the object.Ghanima would be the one to return, believing the reality of a death she had seen or reporting sincerely from a deep hypnotic compulsion that her brother was, indeed, slain.The unknowns of this place haunted him.He thought how easy it would be to succumb to the demand for prescience, to risk launching his awareness into an unchanging, absolute future.The small vision of his dream was bad enough, though.He knew he dared not risk the larger vision.Presently, he returned to Ghanima's side."No pursuit yet," he said."The beasts they send for us will be large," Ghanima said."We may have time to see them coming. ""Not if they come in the night. ""It'll be dark very soon," she said."Yes.It's time we went down into our place. "He indicated the rocks to their left and below them where windsand had eaten a tiny cleft in the basalt.It was large enough to admit them, but small enough to keep out large creatures.Leto felt himself reluctant to go there, but knew it must be done.That was the place he'd pointed out to Stilgar."They may really kill us," he said."This is the chance we have to take," she said."We owe it to our father. ""I'm not arguing. "And he thought: This is the correct path; we do the right thing.But he knew how dangerous it was to be right in this universe.Their survival now demanded vigor and fitness and an understanding of the limitations in every moment.Fremen ways were their best armor, and the Bene Gesserit knowledge was a force held in reserve.They were both thinking now as Atreides trained battle veterans with no other defenses than a Fremen toughness which was not even hinted at by their childish bodies and their formal attire.Leto fingered the hilt of the poison tipped crysknife at his waist.Unconsciously Ghanima duplicated the gesture."Shall we go down now?"Ghanima asked.As she spoke she saw the movement far below them, small movement made less threatening by distance.Her stillness alerted Leto before she could utter a warning."Tigers," he said."Laza tigers," she corrected him."They see us," he said."We'd better hurry," she said."A maula would never stop those creatures.They will've been well trained for this. ""They'll have a human director somewhere around," he said, leading the way at a fast lope down the rocks to the left.Ghanima agreed, but kept it to herself, saving her strength.There'd be a human around somewhere.Those tigers couldn't be allowed to run free until the proper moment.The tigers moved fast in the last of the light, leaping from rock to rock.They were eye minded creatures and soon it would be night, the time of the ear minded.The bell call of a nightbird came from The Attendant's rocks to emphasize the change.Creatures of the darkness already were hustling in the shadows of the etched crevasses.Still the tigers remained visible to the running twins.The animals flowed with power, a rippling sense of golden sureness in every movement.Leto felt that he had stumbled into this place to free himself from his soul.He ran with the sure knowledge that he and Ghanima could reach their narrow notch in time, but his gaze kept returning with fascination to the oncoming beasts.One stumble and we're lost, he thought.That thought reduced the sureness of his knowledge, and he ran faster.= = = = = =   You Bene Gesserit call your activity of the Panoplia Prophetica a "Science of Religion. "Very well.I, a seeker after another kind of scientist, find this an appropriate definition.You do, indeed, build your own myths, but so do all societies.You I must warn, however.You are behaving as so many other misguided scientists have behaved.Your actions reveal that you wish to take something out of [away from] life.It is time you were reminded of that which you so often profess: One cannot have a single thing without its opposite.The Preacher at Arrakeen: A Message to the Sisterhood   In the hour before dawn, Jessica sat immobile on a worn rug of spice cloth.Around her were the bare rocks of an old and poor sietch, one of the original settlements.It lay below the rim of Red Chasm, sheltered from the westerlies of the desert.Al Fali and his brothers had brought her here; now they awaited word from Stilgar.The Fedaykin had moved cautiously in the matter of communication, however.Stilgar was not to know their location.The Fedaykin already knew they were under a proces verbal, an official report of crimes against the Imperium.Alia was taking the tack that her mother had been suborned by enemies of the realm, although the Sisterhood had not yet been named.The high handed, tyrannical nature of Alia's power was out in the open, however, and her belief that because she controlled the Priesthood she controlled the Fremen was about to be tested.Jessica's message to Stilgar had been direct and simple: "My daughter is possessed and must be put to the trial. "Fears destroyed values, though, and it already was known that some Fremen would prefer not to believe this accusation.Their attempts to use the accusation as a passport had brought on two battles during the night, but the ornithopters al Fali's people had stolen had brought the fugitives to this precarious safety: Red Chasm Sietch.Word was going out to the Fedaykin from here, but fewer than two hundred of them remained on Arrakis.The others held posts throughout the Empire.Reflecting upon these facts, Jessica wondered if she had come to the place of her death.Some of the Fedaykin believed it, but the death commandos accepted this easily enough.Al Fali had merely grinned at her when some of his young men voiced their fears."When God hath ordained a creature to die in a particular place.He causeth that creature's wants to direct him to that place," the old Naib had said.The patched curtains at her doorway rustled; al Fali entered.The old man's narrow, windburned face appeared drawn, his eyes feverish.Obviously he had not rested."Someone comes," he said."From Stilgar?""Perhaps. "He lowered his eyes, glanced leftward in the manner of the old Fremen who brought bad news."What is it?"Jessica demanded."We have word from Tabr that your grandchildren are not there. "He spoke without looking at her."Alia... ""She has ordered that the twins be given over to her custody, but Sietch Tabr reports that the children are not there.That is all we know. ""Stilgar's sent them into the desert," Jessica said."Possibly, but it is known that he was searching for them all through the night.Perhaps it was a trick on his part... ""That's not Stilgar's way," she said, and thought: Unless the twins put him up to it.But that didn't feel right either.She wondered at herself: no sensations of panic to suppress, and her fears for the twins were tempered by what Ghanima had revealed.She peered up at al Fali, found him studying her with pity in his eyes.She said: "They've gone into the desert by themselves. ""Alone?Those two children!"She did not bother to explain that "those two children" probably knew more about desert survival than most living Fremen.Her thoughts were fixed, instead, on Leto's odd behavior when he'd insisted that she allow herself to be abducted.She'd put the memory aside, but this moment demanded it.He'd said she would know the moment to obey him."The messenger should be in the sietch by now," al Fali said."I will bring him to you. "He let himself out through the patched curtain.Jessica stared at the curtain.It was red cloth of spice fiber, but the patches were blue.The story was that this sietch had refused to profit from Muad'Dib's religion, earning the enmity of Alia's Priesthood.The people here reportedly had put their capital into a scheme to raise dogs as large as ponies, dogs bred for intelligence as guardians of children.The dogs had all died.Some said it was poison and the Priests were blamed.She shook her head to drive out these reflections, recognizing them for what they were: ghafla, the gadfly distraction.Where had those children gone?To Jacurutu?They had a plan.They tried to enlighten me to the extent they thought I'd accept, she remembered.And when they'd reached the limits as they saw them, Leto had commanded her to obey.He'd commanded her!Leto had recognized what Alia was doing; that much was obvious.Both twins had spoken of their aunt's "affliction," even when defending her.Alia was gambling on the rightness of her position in the Regency.Demanding custody of the twins confirmed that.Jessica found a harsh laugh shaking her own breast.The Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam had been fond of explaining this particular error to her student, Jessica."If you focus your awareness only upon your own rightness, then you invite the forces of opposition to overwhelm you.This is a common error.Even I, your teacher, have made it. ""And even I, your student, have made it," Jessica whispered to herself.She heard fabrics whispering in the passage beyond the curtain.Two young Fremen entered, part of the entourage they'd picked up during the night.The two were obviously awed at being in the presence of Muad'Dib's mother.Jessica had read them completely: they were non thinkers, attaching themselves to any fancied power for the identity which this gave them.Without a reflection from her they were empty.Thus, they were dangerous."We were sent ahead by al Fali to prepare you," one of the young Fremen said.Jessica felt an abrupt clenching tightness in her breast, but her voice remained calm."Prepare me for what?""Stilgar has sent Duncan Idaho as his messenger. "Jessica pulled her aba hood up over her hair, an unconscious gesture.Duncan?But he was Alia's tool.The Fremen who'd spoken took a half step forward."Idaho says he has come to take you to safety, but al Fali does not see how this can be. ""It seems passing strange, indeed," Jessica said."But there are stranger things in our universe.Bring him. "They glanced at each other but obeyed, leaving together with such a rush that they tore another rent in the worn curtain.Presently Idaho stepped through the curtain, followed by the two Fremen and al Fali bringing up the rear, hand on his crysknife.Idaho appeared composed.He wore the dress casuals of an Atreides House Guard, a uniform which had changed little in more than fourteen centuries.Arrakis had replaced the old gold handled plasteel blade with a crysknife, but that was minor."I'm told you wish to help me," Jessica said."As odd as that may seem," he said."But didn't Alia send you to abduct me?"she asked.A slight raising of his black eyebrows was the only mark of surprise.The many faceted Tleilaxu eyes continued to stare at her with glittering intensity."Those were her orders," he said.Al Fali's knuckles went white on his crysknife, but he did not draw."I've spent much of this night reviewing the mistakes I made with my daughter," she said."There were many," Idaho agreed, "and I shared in most of them. "She saw now that his jaw muscles were trembling."It was easy to listen to the arguments which led us astray," Jessica said."I wanted to leave this place...You...you wanted a girl you saw as a younger version of me. "He accepted this silently."Where are my grandchildren?"she demanded, voice going harsh.He blinked.Then: "Stilgar believes they have gone into the desert   hiding.Perhaps they saw this crisis coming. "Jessica glanced at al Fali, who nodded his recognition that she had anticipated this."What is Alia doing?"Jessica asked."She risks civil war," he said."Do you believe it'll come to that?"Idaho shrugged."Probably not.These are softer times.There are more people willing to listen to pleasant arguments. ""I agree," she said."Well and good, what of my grandchildren?""Stilgar will find them   if... ""Yes, I see. "It was really up to Gurney Halleck then.She turned to look at the rock wall on her left."Alia grasps the power firmly now. "She looked back at Idaho."You understand?One uses power by grasping it lightly.To grasp too strongly is to be taken over by power, and thus to become its victim. ""As my Duke always told me," Idaho said.Somehow Jessica knew he meant the older Leto, not Paul.She asked: "Where am I to be taken in this...abduction?"Idaho peered down at her as though trying to see into the shadows created by the hood.Al Fali stepped forward: "My Lady, you are not seriously thinking... ""Is it not my right to decide my own fate?"Jessica asked."But this... "Al Fali's head nodded toward Idaho."This was my loyal guardian before Alia was born," Jessica said."Before he died saving my son's life and mine.We Atreides always honor certain obligations. ""Then you will go with me?"Idaho asked."Where would you take her?"al Fali asked."Best that you don't know," Jessica said.Al Fali scowled but remained silent.His face betrayed indecision, an understanding of the wisdom in her words but an unresolved doubt of Idaho's trustworthiness."What of the Fedaykin who helped me?"Jessica asked."They have Stilgar's countenance if they can get to Tabr," Idaho said.Jessica faced al Fali: "I command you to go there, my friend.Stilgar can use Fedaykin in the search for my grandchildren. "The old Naib lowered his gaze."As Muad'Dib's mother commands. "He's still obeying Paul, she thought."We should be out of here quickly," Idaho said."The search is certain to include this place, and that early. "Jessica rocked forward and arose with that fluid grace which never quite left the Bene Gesserit, even when they felt the pangs of age.And she felt old now after her night of flight.Even as she moved, her mind remained on that peculiar interview with her grandson.What was he really doing?She shook her head, covered the motion by adjusting her hood.It was too easy to fall into the trap of underestimating Leto.Life with ordinary children conditioned one to a false view of the inheritance which the twins enjoyed.Her attention was caught by Idaho's pose.He stood in the relaxed preparedness for violence, one foot ahead of the other, a stance which she herself had taught him.She shot a quick look at the two young Fremen, at al Fali.Doubts still assailed the old Fremen Naib and the two young men felt this."I trust this man with my life," she said, addressing herself to al Fali."And it is not the first time. ""My Lady," al Fali protested."It's just... "He glared at Idaho."He's the husband of the Coan Teen!""And he was trained by my Duke and by me," she said."But he's a ghola!"The words were torn from al Fali."My son's ghola," she reminded him.It was too much for a former Fedaykin who'd once pledged himself to support Muad'Dib to the death.He sighed, stepped aside, and motioned the two young men to open the curtains.Jessica stepped through, Idaho behind her.She turned, spoke to al Fali in the doorway."You are to go to Stilgar.He's to be trusted. ""Yes... "But she still heard doubts in the old man's voice.Idaho touched her arm."We should go at once.Is there anything you wish to take?""Only my common sense," she said."Why?Do you fear you're making a mistake?"She glanced up at him."You were always the best 'thopter pilot in our service, Duncan. "This did not amuse him.He stepped ahead of her, moving swiftly, retracing the way he'd come.Al Fali fell into step beside Jessica."How did you know he came by 'thopter?""He wears no stillsuit," Jessica said.Al Fali appeared abashed by this obvious perception.He would not be silenced, though."Our messenger brought him here directly from Stilgar's.They could've been seen. ""Were you seen, Duncan?"Jessica asked Idaho's back."You know better than that," he said."We flew lower than the dune tops. "They turned into a side passage which led downward in spiral steps, debouching finally into an open chamber well lighted by glowglobes high in the brown rock.A single ornithopter sat facing the far wall, crouched there like an insect waiting to spring.The wall would be false rock, then   a door opening onto the desert.As poor as this sietch was, it still maintained the instruments of secrecy and mobility.Idaho opened the ornithopter's door for her, helped her into the right hand seat.As she moved past him, she saw perspiration on his forehead where a lock of the black goat hair lay tumbled.Unbidden, Jessica found herself recalling that head spouting blood in a noisy cavern.The steely marbles of the Tleilaxu eyes brought her out of that recollection.Nothing was as it seemed anymore.She busied herself fastening her seatbelt."It's been along time since you've flown me, Duncan," she said."Long and far time," he said.He was already checking the controls.Al Fali and the two younger Fremen waited beside the controls to the false rock, prepared to open it."Do you think I harbor doubts about you?"Jessica asked, speaking softly to Idaho.Idaho kept his attention on an engine instrument, ignited the impellers and watched a needle move.A smile touched his mouth, a quick and harsh gesture in his sharp features, gone as quickly as it had come."I am still Atreides," Jessica said."Alia is not. ""Have no fear," he grated."I still serve the Atreides. ""Alia is no longer Atreides," Jessica repeated."You needn't remind me!"he snarled."Now shut up and let me fly this thing. "The desperation in his voice was quite unexpected, out of keeping with the Idaho she'd known.Putting down a renewed sense of fear, Jessica asked: "Where are we going, Duncan?You can tell me now. "But he nodded to al Fali and the false rock opened outward into bright silvery sunlight.The ornithopter leaped outward and up, its wings throbbing with the effort, the jets roaring, and they mounted into an empty sky.Idaho set a southwesterly course toward Sahaya Ridge which could be seen as a dark line upon the sand.Presently he said: "Do not think harshly of me, My Lady. ""I haven't thought harshly of you since that night you came into our Arrakeen great hall roaring drunk on spice beer," she said.But his words renewed her doubts, and she fell into the relaxed preparedness of complete prana bindu defense."I remember that night well," he said."I was very young...inexperienced. ""But the best swordmaster in my Duke's retinue. ""Not quite, My Lady.Gurney could best me six times out of ten. "He glanced at her."Where is Gurney?""Doing my bidding. "He shook his head."Do you know where we're going?"she asked."Yes, My Lady. ""Then tell me. ""Very well.I promised that I would create a believable plot against House Atreides.Only one way, really, to do that. "He pressed a button on the control wheel and cocoon restraints whipped from Jessica's seat, enfolded her in unbreakable softness, leaving only her head exposed."I'm taking you to Salusa Secundus," he said."To Farad'n. "In a rare, uncontrolled spasm, Jessica surged against the restraints, felt them tighten, easing only when she relaxed, but not before she felt the deadly shigawire concealed in the protective sheathing."The shigawire release has been disconnected," he said, not looking at her."Oh yes, and don't try Voice on me.I've come a long way since the days when you could move me that way. "He looked at her."The Tleilaxu armored me against such wiles. ""You're obeying Alia," Jessica said, "and she  "  "Not Alia," he said."We do The Preacher's bidding.He wants you to teach Farad'n as once you taught...Paul. "Jessica remained in frozen silence, remembering Leto's words, that she would find an interesting student.Presently she said: "This Preacher   is he my son?"Idaho's voice seemed to come from a great distance: "I wish I knew. "= = = = = =   The universe is just there; that's the only way a Fedaykin can view it and remain the master of his senses.The universe neither threatens nor promises.It holds things beyond our sway: the fall of a meteor, the eruption of a spiceblow, growing old and dying.These are the realities of this universe and they must be faced regardless of how you feel about them.You cannot fend off such realities with words.They will come at you in their own wordless way and then, then you will understand what is meant by "life and death. "Understanding this, you will be filled with joy.Muad'Dib to his Fedaykin   "And those are the things we have set in motion," Wensicia said."These things were done for you. "Farad'n remained motionless, seated across from his mother in her morning room.The sun's golden light came from behind him, casting his shadow on the white carpeted floor.Light reflected from the wall behind his mother drew a nimbus around her hair.She wore her usual white robe trimmed in gold   reminders of royal days.Her heart shaped face appeared composed, but he knew she was watching his every reaction.His stomach felt empty, although he'd just come from breakfast."You don't approve?"Wensicia asked."What is there to disapprove?"he asked."Well...that we kept this from you until now?""Oh, that. "He studied his mother, tried to reflect upon his complex position in this matter.He could only think on a thing he had noticed recently, that Tyekanik no longer called her "My Princess. "What did he call her?Queen Mother?Why do I feel a sense of loss?he wondered.What am I losing?The answer was obvious: he was losing his carefree days, time for those pursuits of the mind which so attracted him.If this plot unfolded by his mother came off, those things would be gone forever.New responsibilities would demand his attention.He found that he resented this deeply.How dared they take such liberties with his time?And without even consulting him!"Out with it," his mother said."Something's wrong. ""What if this plan fails?"he asked, saying the first thing that came into his mind."How can it fail?""I don't know...Any plan can fail.How're you using Idaho in all of this?""Idaho?What's this interest in...Oh, yes   that mystic fellow Tyek brought here without consulting me.That was wrong of him.The mystic spoke of Idaho, didn't he?"It was a clumsy lie on her part, and Farad'n found himself staring at his mother in wonderment.She'd known about The Preacher all along!"It's just that I've never seen a ghola," he said.She accepted this, said: "We're saving Idaho for something important. "Farad'n chewed silently at his upper lip.Wensicia found herself reminded of his dead father.Dalak had been like that at times, very inward and complex, difficult to read.Dalak, she reminded herself, had been related to Count Hasimir Fenring, and there'd been something of the dandy and the fanatic in both of them.Would Farad'n follow in that path?She began to regret having Tyek lead the lad into the Arrakeen religion.Who knew where that might take him?"What does Tyek call you now?"Farad'n asked."What's that?"She was startled by this shift."I've noticed that he doesn't call you 'My Princess' anymore. "How observant he is, she thought, wondering why this filled her with disquiet.Does he think I've taken Tyek as a lover?Nonsense, it wouldn't matter one way or the other.Then why this question?"He calls me 'My Lady,' " she said."Why?""Because that's the custom in all of the Great Houses. "Including the Atreides, he thought."It's less suggestive if overheard," she explained."Some will think we've given up our legitimate aspirations. ""Who would be that stupid?"he asked.She pursed her lips, decided to let it pass.A small thing, but great campaigns were made up of many small things."The Lady Jessica shouldn't have left Caladan," he said.She shook her head sharply.What was this?His mind was darting around like a crazy thing!She said: "What do you mean?""She shouldn't have gone back to Arrakis," he said."That's bad strategy.Makes one wonder.Would've been better to have her grandchildren visit her on Caladan. "He's right, she thought, dismayed that this had never occurred to her.Tyek would have to explore this immediately.Again she shook her head.No!What was Farad'n doing?He must know that the Priesthood would never risk both twins in space.She said this."Is it the Priesthood or the Lady Alia?"he asked, noting that her thoughts had gone where he had wanted.He found exhilaration in his new importance, the mind games available in political plotting.It had been a long time since his mother's mind had interested him.She was too easily maneuvered."You think Alia wants power for herself?"Wensicia asked.He looked away from her.Of course Alia wanted the power for herself!All of the reports from that accursed planet agreed on this.His thoughts took off on a new course."I've been reading about their Planetologist," he said."There has to be a clue to the sandworms and the haploids in there somewhere, if only... ""Leave that to others now!"she said, beginning to lose patience with him."Is this all you have to say about the things we've done for you?""You didn't do them for me," he said."Wha a at?""You did it for House Corrino," he said, "and you're House Corrino right now.I've not been invested. ""You have responsibilities!"she said."What about all of the people who depend upon you?"As if her words put the burden upon him, he felt the weight of all those hopes and dreams which followed House Corrino."Yes," he said, "I understand about them, but I find some of the things done in my name distasteful. ""Dis...How can you say such a thing?We do what any Great House would do in promoting its own fortunes!""Do you?I think you've been a bit gross.No!Don't interrupt me.If I'm to be an Emperor, then you'd better learn how to listen to me.Do you think I cannot read between the lines?How were those tigers trained?"She remained speechless at this cutting demonstration of his perceptive abilities."I see. "he said."Well, I'll keep Tyek because I know you led him into this.He's a good officer under most circumstances, but he'll fight for his own principles only in a friendly arena. ""His...principles?""The difference between a good officer and a poor one is strength of character and about five heartbeats," he said."He has to stick by his principles wherever they're challenged. ""The tigers were necessary," she said."I'll believe that if they succeed," he said."But I will not condone what had to be done in training them.Don't protest.It's obvious.They were conditioned.You said it yourself. ""What're you going to do?"she asked."I'm going to wait and see," he said."Perhaps I'll become Emperor. "She put a hand to her breast, sighed.For a few moments there he'd terrified her.She'd almost believed he would denounce her.Principles!But he was committed now; she could see that.Farad'n got up, went to the door and rang for his mother's attendants.He looked back: "We are through, aren't we?""Yes. "She raised a hand as he started to leave."Where're you going?""To the library.I've become fascinated lately by Corrino history. "He left her then, sensing how he carried his new commitment with him.Damn her!But he knew he was committed.And he recognized that there was a deep emotional difference between history as recorded on shigawire and read at leisure, a deep difference between that kind of history and the history which one lived.This new living history which he felt gathering around him possessed a sense of plunging into an irreversible future.Farad'n could feel himself driven now by the desires of all those whose fortunes rode with him.He found it strange that he could not pin down his own desires in this.= = = = = =   It is said of Muad'Dib that once when he saw a weed trying to grow between two rocks, he moved one of the rocks.Later, when the weed was seen to be flourishing, he covered it with the remaining rock."That was its fate," he explained.The Commentaries   "Now!"Ghanima shouted.Leto, two steps ahead of her in reaching the narrow cut in the rocks, did not hesitate.He dove into the slit, crawled forward until darkness enfolded him.He heard Ghanima drop behind him, a sudden stillness, and her voice, not hurrying or fearful:  "I'm stuck. "He stood up, knowing this would bring his head within reach of questing claws, reversed himself in the narrow passage, crept back until he felt Ghanima's outstretched hand."It's my robe," she said."It's caught. "He heard rocks falling directly below them, pulled on her hand but felt only a small gain.There was panting below them, a growl.Leto tensed himself, wedging his hips against the rock, heaved on Ghanima's arm.Cloth ripped and he felt her jerk toward him.She hissed and he knew she felt pain, but he pulled once more, harder.She came farther into the hole, then all the way, dropping beside him.They were too close to the end of the cut, though.He turned, dropped to all fours, scrambled deeper.Ghanima pulled herself along behind him.There was a panting intensity to her movements which told him she'd been hurt.He came to the end of the opening, rolled over and peered upward out the narrow gap of their sanctuary.The opening was about two meters above him, filled with stars.Something large obscured the stars.A rumbling growl filled the air around the twins.It was deep, menacing, an ancient sound: hunter speaking to its prey."How badly are you hurt?"Leto asked, keeping his voice even.She matched him, tone for tone: "One of them clawed me.Breached my stillsuit along the left leg.I'm bleeding. ""How bad?""Vein.I can stop it. ""Use pressure," he said."Don't move.I'll take care of our friends. ""Careful," she said."They're bigger than I expected. "Leto unsheathed his crysknife, reached up with it.He knew the tiger would be questing downward, claws raking the narrow passage where its body could not go.Slowly, slowly, he extended the knife.Abruptly something struck the top of the blade.He felt the blow all along his arm, almost lost his grip on the knife.Blood gushed along his hand, spattered his face, and there came an immediate scream which deafened him.The stars became visible.Something threshed and flung itself down the rocks toward the sand in a violent caterwauling.Once more, the stars were obscured and he heard the hunter's growl.The second tiger had moved into place, unmindful of its companion's fate."They're persistent," Leto said."You got one for sure," Ghanima said."Listen!"The screams and thrashing convulsions below them were growing fainter.The second tiger remained, though, a curtain against the stars.Leto sheathed his blade, touched Ghanima's arm."Give me your knife.I want a fresh tip to make sure of this one. ""Do you think they'll have a third one in reserve?"She asked."Not likely.Laza tigers hunt in pairs. ""Just as we do," she said."As we do," he agreed.He felt the handle of her crysknife slip into his palm, gripped it tightly.Once more he began that careful upward questing.The blade encountered only empty air, even when he reached into a level dangerous to his body.He withdrew, pondering this."Can't you find it?""It's not behaving the way the other one did. ""It's still there.Smell it?"He swallowed in a dry throat.A fetid breath, moist with the musky smell of the cat, assaulted his nostrils.The stars were still blocked from view.Nothing could be heard of the first cat; the crysknife's poison had completed its work."I think I'm going to have to stand up," he said."No!""It has to be teased into reach of the knife. ""Yes, but we agreed that if one of us could avoid being wounded... ""And you're wounded, so you're the one going back," he said."But if you're badly injured, I won't be able to leave you," she said."Do you have a better idea?""Give me back my knife. ""But your leg!""I can stand on the good one. ""That thing could take your head off with one sweep.Maybe the maula... ""If there's anyone out there to hear, they'll know we came prepared for  "  "I don't like your taking this risk!"he said."Whoever's out there mustn't learn we have maulas   not yet. "She touched his arm."I'll be careful, keep my head down. "As he remained silent, she said: "You know I'm the one who has to do this.Give me back my knife. "Reluctantly he quested with his free hand, found her hand and returned the knife.It was the logical thing to do, but logic warred with every emotion in him.He felt Ghanima pull away, heard the sandy rasping of her robe against the rock.She gasped, and he knew she must be standing.Be very careful!he thought.And he almost pulled her back to insist they use a maula pistol.But that could warn anyone out there that they had such weapons.Worse, it could drive the tiger out of reach, and they'd be trapped in here with a wounded tiger waiting for them in some unknown place out on those rocks.Ghanima took a deep breath, braced her back against one wall of the cleft.I must be quick, she thought.She reached upward with the knife point.Her left leg throbbed where the claws had raked it.She felt the crusting of blood against her skin there and the warmth of a new flow.Very quick!She sank her senses into the calm preparation for crisis which the Bene Gesserit Way provided, put pain and all other distractions out of her awareness.The cat must reach down!Slowly she passed the blade along the opening.Where was the damned animal?Once more she raked the air.Nothing.The tiger would have to be lured into attack.Carefully she probed with her sense of smell.Warm breath came from her left.She poised herself, drew in a deep breath, screamed: "Taqwa!"It was the old Fremen battlecry, its meaning found in the most ancient legends: "The price of freedom!"With the cry she tipped the blade and stabbed along the cleft's dark opening.Claws found her elbow before the knife touched flesh, and she had time only to tip her wrist toward the pain before agony raked her arm from elbow to wrist.Through the pain, she felt the poison tip sink into the tiger.The blade was wrenched from her numb fingers.But again the narrow gap of the cleft lay open to the stars and the wailing voice of a dying cat filled the night.They followed it by its death throes, a thrashing passage down the rocks.Presently the death silence came."It got my arm," Ghanima said, trying to bind a loose fold of her robe around the wound."Badly?""I think so.I can't feel my hand. ""Let me get a light and  "  "Not until we get under cover!""I'll hurry. "She heard him twisting to reach his Fremkit, felt the dark slickness of a nightshield as it was slipped over her head, tucked in behind her.He didn't bother to make it moisture tight."My knife's on this side," she said."I can feel the handle with my knee. ""Leave it for now. "He ignited a single small globe.The brilliance of it made her blink.Leto put the globe on the sandy floor at one side, gasped as he saw her arm.One claw had opened a long, gaping wound which twisted from the elbow along the back of her arm almost to the wrist.The wound described the way she had rotated her arm to present the knife tip to the tiger's paw.Ghanima glanced once at the wound, closed her eyes and began reciting the litany against fear.Leto found himself sharing her need, but put aside the clamor of his own emotions while he set about binding up the wound.It had to be done carefully to stop the flow of blood while retaining the appearance of a clumsy job which Ghanima might have done by herself.He made her tie off the knot with her free hand, holding one end of the bandage in her teeth."Now let's look at the leg," he said.She twisted around to present the other wound.It was not as bad: two shallow claw cuts along the calf.They had bled freely into the stillsuit, however.He cleaned it up as best he could, bound the wound beneath the stillsuit.He sealed the suit over the bandage."I got sand in it," he said."Have it treated as soon as you get back. ""Sand in our wounds," she said."That's an old story for Fremen. "He managed a smile, sat back.Ghanima took a deep breath."We've pulled it off. ""Not yet. "She swallowed, fighting to recover from the aftermath of shock.Her face appeared pale in the light of the glowglobe.And she thought: Yes, we must move fast now.Whoever controlled those tigers could be out there right now.Leto, staring at his sister, felt a sudden wrenching sense of loss.It was a deep pain which shot through his breast.He and Ghanima must separate now.For all of those years since birth they had been as one person.But their plan demanded now that they undergo a metamorphosis, going their separate ways into uniqueness where the sharing of daily experiences would never again unite them as they once had been united.He retreated into the necessarily mundane."Here's my Fremkit.I took the bandages from it.Someone may look. ""Yes. "She exchanged kits with him."Someone out there has a transmitter for those cats," he said."Most likely he'll be waiting near the qanat to make certain of us. "She touched her maula pistol where it sat atop the Fremkit, picked it up and thrust it into the sash beneath her robe."My robe's torn. ""Yes. ""Searchers may get here soon," he said."They may have a traitor among them.Best you slip back alone.Get Harrah to hide you. ""I'll...I'll start the search for the traitor as soon as I get back," she said.She peered into her brother's face, sharing his painful knowledge that from this point on they would accumulate a store of differences.Never again would they be as one, sharing knowledge which no one else could understand."I'll go to Jacurutu," he said."Fondak," she said.He nodded his agreement.Jacurutu/Fondak   they had to be the same place.It was the only way the legendary place could have been hidden.Smugglers had done it, of course.How easy for them to convert one label into another, acting under the cover of the unspoken convention by which they were allowed to exist.The ruling family of a planet must always have a back door for escape in extremis.And a small share in smuggling profits kept the channels open.In Fondak/Jacurutu, the smugglers had taken over a completely operative sietch untroubled by a resident population.And they had hidden Jacurutu right out in the open, secure in the taboo which kept Fremen from it."No Fremen will think to search for me in such a place," he said."They'll inquire among the smugglers, of course, but... ""We'll do as we agreed," she said."It's just... ""I know. "Hearing his own voice, Leto realized they were drawing out these last moments of sameness.A wry grin touched his mouth, adding years to his appearance.Ghanima realized she was seeing him through a veil of time, looking at an older Leto.Tears burned her eyes."You needn't give water to the dead just yet," he said, brushing a finger against the dampness on her cheeks."I'll go out far enough that no one will hear, and I'll call a worm. "He indicated the collapsed Maker hooks strapped to the outside of his Fremkit."I'll be at Jacurutu before dawn two days from now. ""Ride swiftly, my old friend," she whispered."I'll come back to you, my only friend," he said."Remember to be careful at the qanat. ""Choose a good worm," she said, giving him the Fremen words of parting.Her left hand extinguished the glowglobe, and the nightseal rustled as she pulled it aside, folded it and tucked it into her kit.She felt him go, hearing only the softest of sounds quickly fading into silence as he crept down the rocks into the desert.Ghanima steeled herself then for what she had to do.Leto must be dead to her.She had to make herself believe it.There could be no Jacurutu in her mind, no brother out there seeking a place lost in Fremen mythology.From this point onward she could not think of Leto as alive.She must condition herself to react out of a total belief that her brother was dead, killed here by Laza tigers.Not many humans could fool a Truthsayer, but she knew that she could do it...might have to do it.The multi lives she and Leto shared had taught them the way: a hypnotic process old in Sheba's time, although she might be the only human alive who could recall Sheba as a reality.The deep compulsions had been designed with care and, for a long time after Leto had gone, Ghanima reworked her self awareness, building the lonely sister, the surviving twin, until it was a believable totality.As she did this, she found the inner world becoming silent, blanked away from intrusion into her consciousness.It was a side effect she had not expected.If only Leto could have lived to learn this, she thought, and she did not find the thought a paradox.Standing, she peered down at the desert where the tiger had taken Leto.There was a sound growing in the sand out there, a familiar sound to Fremen: the passage of a worm.Rare as they had become in these parts, a worm still came.Perhaps the first cat's death throes...Yes, Leto had killed one cat before the other one got him.It was oddly symbolic that a worm should come.So deep was her compulsion that she saw three dark spots far down on the sand: the two tigers and Leto.Then the worm came and there was only sand with its surface broken into new waves by the passage of Shai Hulud.It had not been a very large worm...but large enough.And her compulsion did not permit her to see a small figure riding on the ringed back.Fighting her grief, Ghanima sealed her Fremkit, crept cautiously from her hiding place.Hand on her maula pistol, she scanned the area.No sign of a human with a transmitter.She worked her way up the rocks and across to the far side, creeping through moonshadows, waiting and waiting to be sure no assassin lurked in her path.Across the open space she could see torches at Tabr, the wavering activity of a search.A dark patch moved across the sand toward The Attendant.She chose her path to run far to the north of the approaching party, went down to the sand and moved into the dune shadows.Careful to make her steps fall in a broken rhythm which would not attract a worm, she set out into the lonely distance which separated Tabr from the place where Leto had died.She would have to be careful at the qanat, she knew.Nothing must prevent her from telling how her brother had perished saving her from the tigers.= = = = = =   Governments, if they endure, always tend increasingly toward aristocratic forms.No government in history has been known to evade this pattern.And as the aristocracy develops, government tends more and more to act exclusively in the interests of the ruling class   whether that class be hereditary royalty, oligarchs of financial empires, or entrenched bureaucracy.Politics as Repeat Phenomenon: Bene Gesserit Training Manual   "Why does he make us this offer?"Farad'n asked."That's most essential. "He and the Bashar Tyekanik stood in the lounge of Farad'n's private quarters.Wensicia sat at one side on a low blue divan, almost as audience rather than participant.She knew her position and resented it, but Farad'n had undergone a terrifying change since that morning when she'd revealed their plots to him.It was late afternoon at Corrino Castle and the low light accented the quiet comfort of this lounge   a room lined with actual books reproduced in plastino, with shelves revealing a horde of player spools, data blocks, shigawire reels, mnemonic amplifiers.There were signs all around that this room was much used   worn places on the books, bright metal on the amplifiers, frayed corners on the data blocks.There was only the one divan, but many chairs   all of them sensiform floaters designed for unobtrusive comfort.Farad'n stood with his back to a window.He wore a plain Sardaukar uniform in grey and black with only the golden lion claw symbols on the wings of his collar as decoration.He had chosen to receive the Bashar and his mother in this room, hoping to create an atmosphere of more relaxed communication than could be achieved in a more formal setting.But Tyekanik's constant "My Lord this" and "My Lady that" kept them at a distance."My Lord, I don't think he'd make this offer were he unable to deliver," Tyekanik said."Of course not!"Wensicia intruded.Farad'n merely glanced at his mother to silence her, asked: "We've put no pressure on Idaho, made no attempt to seek delivery on The Preacher's promise?""None," Tyekanik said."Then why does Duncan Idaho, noted all of his life for his fanatic loyalty to the Atreides, offer now to deliver the Lady Jessica into our hands?""These rumors of trouble on Arrakis... "Wensicia ventured."Unconfirmed," Farad'n said."Is it possible that The Preacher has precipitated this?""Possible," Tyekanik said, "but I fail to see a motive. ""He speaks of seeking asylum for her," Farad'n said."That might follow if those rumors... ""Precisely," his mother said."Or it could be a ruse of some sort," Tyekanik said."We can make several assumptions and explore them," Farad'n said."What if Idaho has fallen into disfavor with his Lady Alia?""That might explain matters," Wensicia said, "but he  "  "No word yet from the smugglers?"Farad'n interrupted."Why can't we  "  "Transmission is always slow in this season," Tyekanik said, "and the needs of security... ""Yes, of course, but still... "Farad'n shook his head."I don't like our assumption. ""Don't be too quick to abandon it," Wensicia said."All of those stories about Alia and that Priest, whatever his name is... ""Javid," Farad'n said."But the man's obviously  "  "He's been a valuable source of information for us," Wensicia said."I was about to say that he's obviously a double agent," Farad'n said."How could he indict himself in this?He's not to be trusted.There are too many signs... ""I fail to see them," she said.He was suddenly angry with her denseness."Take my word for it, mother!The signs are there; I'll explain later. ""I'm afraid I must agree," Tyekanik said.Wensicia lapsed into hurt silence.How dared they push her out of Council like this?As though she were some light headed fancy woman with no    "We mustn't forget that Idaho was once a ghola," Farad'n said."The Tleilaxu... "He glanced sidelong at Tyekanik."That avenue will be explored," Tyekanik said.He found himself admiring the way Farad'n's mind worked: alert, questing, sharp.Yes, the Tleilaxu, in restoring life to Idaho, might have planted a powerful barb in him for their own use."But I fail to apprehend a Tleilaxu motive," Farad'n said."An investment in our fortunes," Tyekanik said."A small insurance for future favors?""Large investment, I'd call it," Farad'n said."Dangerous," Wensicia said.Farad'n had to agree with her.The Lady Jessica's capabilities were notorious in the Empire.After all, she'd been the one who'd trained Muad'Dib."If it became known that we hold her," Farad'n said."Yes, that'd be a two edged sword," Tyekanik said."But it need not be known. ""Let us assume," Farad'n said, "that we accept this offer.What's her value?Can we exchange her for something of greater importance?""Not openly," Wensicia said."Of course not!"He peered expectantly at Tyekanik."That remains to be seen," Tyekanik said.Farad'n nodded."Yes.I think if we accept, we should consider the Lady Jessica as money banked for indeterminate use.After all, wealth doesn't necessarily have to be spent on any particular thing.It's just...potentially useful. ""She'd be a very dangerous captive," Tyekanik said."There is that to consider, indeed," Farad'n said."I'm told that her Bene Gesserit Ways permit her to manipulate a person just by the subtle employment of her voice. ""Or her body," Wensicia said."Irulan once divulged to me some of the things she'd learned.She was showing off at the time, and I saw no demonstrations.Still the evidence is pretty conclusive that Bene Gesserits have their ways of achieving their ends. ""Were you suggesting," Farad'n asked, "that she might seduce me?"Wensicia merely shrugged."I'd say she's a little old for that, wouldn't you?"Farad'n asked."With a Bene Gesserit, nothing's certain," Tyekanik said.Farad'n experienced a shiver of excitement tinged with fear.Playing this game to restore House of Corrino's high seat of power both attracted and repelled him.How attractive it remained, the urge to retire from this game into his preferred pursuits   historical research and learning the manifest duties for ruling here on Salusa Secundus.The restoration of his Sardaukar forces was a task in itself...and for that job, Tyek was still a good tool.One planet was, after all, an enormous responsibility.But the Empire was an even greater responsibility, far more attractive as an instrument of power.And the more he read about Muad'Dib/Paul Atreides, the more fascinated Farad'n became with the uses of power.As titular head of House Corrino, heir of Shaddam IV, what a great achievement it would be to restore his line to the Lion Throne.He wanted that!He wanted it.Farad'n had found that, by repeating this enticing litany to himself several times, he could overcome momentary doubts.Tyekanik was speaking: "...and of course, the Bene Gesserit teach that peace encourages aggressions, thus igniting war.The paradox of  "  "How did we get on this subject?"Farad'n asked, bringing his attention back from the arena of speculation."Why," Wensicia said sweetly, having noted the woolgathering expression on her son's face, "I merely asked if Tyek was familiar with the driving philosophy behind the Sisterhood. ""Philosophy should be approached with irreverence," Farad'n said, turning to face Tyekanik."In regard to Idaho's offer, I think we should inquire further.When we think we know something, that's precisely the moment when we should look deeper into the thing. ""It will be done," Tyekanik said.He liked this cautious streak in Farad'n, but hoped it did not extend to those military decisions which required speed and precision.With seeming irrelevancy, Farad'n asked: "Do you know what I find most interesting about the history of Arrakis?It was the custom in primitive times for Fremen to kill on sight anyone not clad in a stillsuit with its easily visible and characteristic hood. ""What is your fascination with the stillsuit?"Tyekanik asked."So you've noticed, eh?""How could we not notice?"Wensicia asked.Farad'n sent an irritated glance at his mother.Why did she interrupt like that?He returned his attention to Tyekanik."The stillsuit is the key to that planet's character, Tyek.It's the hallmark of Dune.People tend to focus on the physical characteristics: the stillsuit conserves body moisture, recycles it, and makes it possible to exist on such a planet.You know, the Fremen custom was to have one stillsuit for each member of a family, except for food gatherers.They had spares.But please note, both of you  " He moved to include his mother in this.  "how garments which appear to be stillsuits, but really aren't, have become high fashion throughout the Empire.It's such a dominant characteristic for humans to copy the conqueror!""Do you really find such information valuable?"Tyekanik asked, his tone puzzled."Tyek, Tyek   without such information, one cannot govern.I said the stillsuit was the key to their character and it is!It's a conservative thing.The mistakes they make will be conservative mistakes. "Tyekanik glanced at Wensicia, who was staring at her son with a worried frown.This characteristic of Farad'n's both attracted and worried the Bashar.It was so unlike old Shaddam.Now, there had been an essential Sardaukar: a military killer with few inhibitions.But Shaddam had fallen to the Atreides under that damnable Paul.Indeed, what he read of Paul Atreides revealed just such characteristics as Farad'n now displayed.It was possible that Farad'n might hesitate less than the Atreides over brutal necessities, but that was his Sardaukar training."Many have governed without using this kind of information," Tyekanik said.Farad'n merely stared at him for a moment.Then: "Governed and failed. "Tyekanik's mouth drew into a stiff line at this obvious allusion to Shaddam's failure.That had been a Sardaukar failure, too, and no Sardaukar could recall it easily.Having made his point, Farad'n said: "You see, Tyek, the influence of a planet upon the mass unconscious of its inhabitants has never been fully appreciated.To defeat the Atreides, we must understand not only Caladan but Arrakis: one planet soft and the other a training ground for hard decisions.That was a unique event, that marriage of Atreides and Fremen.We must know how it worked or we won't be able to match it, let alone defeat it. ""What does this have to do with Idaho's offer?"Wensicia demanded.Farad'n glanced pityingly down at his mother."We begin their defeat by the kinds of stress we introduce into their society.That's a very powerful tool: stress.And the lack of it is important, too.Did you not mark how the Atreides helped things grow soft and easy here?"Tyekanik allowed himself a curt nod of agreement.That was a good point.The Sardaukar could not be permitted to grow too soft.This offer from Idaho still bothered him, though.He said: "Perhaps it'd be best to reject the offer. ""Not yet," Wensicia said."We've a spectrum of choices open to us.Our task is to identify as much of the spectrum as we can.My son is right: we need more information. "Farad'n stared at her, measuring her intent as well as the surface meaning of her words."But will we know when we've passed the point of no alternate choice?"he asked.A sour chuckle came from Tyekanik."If you ask me, we're long past the point of no return. "Farad'n tipped his head back to laugh aloud."But we still have alternate choices, Tyek!When we come to the end of our rope, that's an important place to recognize!"= = = = = =   In this age when the

think of attempting long journeys afoot.Yet this remains a primary means of travel on Arrakis, a fact attributed partly to preference and partly to the brutal treatment which this planet reserves for anything mechanical.In the strictures of Arrakis, human flesh remains the most durable and reliable resource for the Hajj.Perhaps it is the implicit awareness of this fact which makes Arrakis the ultimate mirror of the soul.Handbook of the Hajj   Slowly, cautiously, Ghanima made her way back to Tabr, holding herself to the deepest shadows of the dunes, crouching in stillness as the search party passed to the south of her.Terrible awareness gripped her: the worm which had taken the tigers and Leto's body, the dangers ahead.He was gone; her twin was gone.She put aside all tears and nurtured her rage.In this, she was pure Fremen.And she knew this, reveling in it.She understood what was said about Fremen.They were not supposed to have a conscience, having lost it in a burning for revenge against those who had driven them from planet to planet in the long wandering.That was foolishness, of course.Only the rawest primitive had no conscience.Fremen possessed a highly evolved conscience which centered on their own welfare as a people.It was only to outsiders that they seemed brutish   just as outsiders appeared brutish to Fremen.Every Fremen knew very well that he could do a brutal thing and feel no guilt.Fremen did not feel guilt for the same things that aroused such feelings in others.Their rituals provided a freedom from guilts which might otherwise have destroyed them.They knew in their deepest awareness that any transgression could be ascribed, at least in part, to well recognized extenuating circumstances: "the failure of authority," or "a natural bad tendency" shared by all humans, or to "bad luck," which any sentient creature should be able to identify as a collision between mortal flesh and the outer chaos of the universe.In this context Ghanima felt herself to be the pure Fremen, a carefully prepared extension of tribal brutality.She needed only a target   and that, obviously, was House Corrino.She longed to see Farad'n's blood spilled on the ground at her feet.No enemy awaited her at the qanat.Even the search parties had gone elsewhere.She crossed the water on an earth bridge, crept through tall grass toward the covert exit of the sietch.Abruptly light flared ahead of her and Ghanima threw herself flat on the ground.She peered out through stalks of giant alfalfa.A woman had entered the covert passage from the outside, and someone had remembered to prepare that passage in the way any sietch entrance should be prepared.In troubled times, one greeted anyone entering the sietch with bright light, temporarily blinding the newcomer and giving guards time to decide.But such a greeting was never meant to be broadcast out over the desert.The light visible here meant the outer seals had been left aside.Ghanima felt a tug of bitterness at this betrayal of sietch security: this flowing light.The ways of the lace shirt Fremen were to be found everywhere!The light continued to throw its fan over the ground at the cliff base.A young girl ran out of the orchard's darkness into the light, something fearful about her movements.Ghanima could see the bright circle of a glowglobe within the passage, a halo of insects around it.The light illuminated two dark shadows in the passage: a man and the girl.They were holding hands as they stared into each other's eyes.Ghanima sensed something wrong about the man and woman there.They were not just two lovers stealing a moment from the search.The light was suspended above and beyond them in the passage.The two talked against a glowing arch, throwing their shadows into the outer night where anyone could be a watcher of their movements.Now and again the man would free a hand.The hand would come gesturing into the light, a sharp and furtive movement which, once completed, returned to the shadows.Lonely sounds of night creatures filled the darkness around Ghanima, but she screened out such distractions.What was it about those two?The man's motions were so static, so careful.He turned.Reflection from the woman's robe illuminated him, exposing a raw red face with a large blotchy nose.Ghanima drew in a deep, silent breath of recognition.Palimbasha!He was a grandson of a Naib whose sons had fallen in Atreides service.The face   and another thing revealed by the open swinging of his robe as he turned   drew for Ghanima a complete picture.He wore a belt beneath the robe, and attached to the belt was a box which glistened with keys and dials.It was an instrument of the Tleilaxu or the Ixians for certain.And it had to be the transmitter which had released the tigers.Palimbasha.This meant that another Naibate family had gone over to House Corrino.Who was the woman, then?No matter.She was someone being used by Palimbasha.Unbidden, a Bene Gesserit thought came into Ghanima's mind: Each planet has its own period, and each life likewise.She recalled Palimbasha well, watching him there with that woman, seeing the transmitter, the furtive movements.Palimbasha taught in the sietch school.Mathematics.The man was a mathematical boor.He had attempted to explain Muad'Dib through mathematics until censured by the Priesthood.He was a mind slaver and his enslaving process could be understood with extreme simplicity: he transferred technical knowledge without a transfer of values.I should've suspected him earlier, she thought.The signs were all there.Then, with an acid tightening of her stomach: He killed my brother!She forced herself to calmness.Palimbasha would kill her, too, if she tried to pass him there in the covert passage.Now she understood the reason for this un Fremen display of light, this betrayal of the hidden entrance.They were watching by that light to see if either of their victims had escaped.It must be a terrible time of waiting for them, not knowing.And now that Ghanima had seen the transmitter, she could explain certain of the hand motions.Palimbasha was depressing one of the transmitter's keys frequently, an angry gesture.The presence of this pair said much to Ghanima.Likely every way into the sietch carried a similar watcher in its depths.She scratched her nose where dust tickled it.Her wounded leg still throbbed and the knife arm ached when it didn't burn.The fingers remained numb.Should it come to a knife, she would have to use the blade in her left hand.Ghanima thought of using the maula pistol, but its characteristic sound would be sure to attract unwanted attention.Some other way would have to be found.Palimbasha turned away from the entrance once more.He was a dark object against the light.The woman turned her attention to the outer night while she talked.There was a trained alertness about the woman, a sense that she knew how to look into the shadows, using the edges of her eyes.She was more than just a useful tool, then.She was part of the deeper conspiracy.Ghanima recalled now that Palimbasha aspired to be a Kaymakam, a political governor under the Regency.He would be part of a larger plan, that was clear.There would be many others with him.Even here in Tabr.Ghanima examined the edges of the problem thus exposed, probed into it.If she could take one of these guardians alive, many others would be forfeit.The whiffle of a small animal drinking at the qanat behind her caught Ghanima's awareness.Natural sounds and natural things.Her memory searched through a strange silent barrier in her mind, found a priestess of Jowf captured in Assyria by Sennacherib.The memories of that priestess told Ghanima what would have to be done here.Palimbasha and his woman there were mere children, wayward and dangerous.They knew nothing of Jowf, knew not even the name of the planet where Sennacherib and the priestess had faded into dust.The thing which was about to happen to the pair of conspirators, if it were explained to them, could only be explained in terms of beginning here.And ending here.Rolling onto her side, Ghanima freed her Fremkit, slipped the sandsnorkel from its bindings.She uncapped the sandsnorkel, removed the long filter within it.Now she had an open tube.She selected a needle from the repair pack, unsheathed her crysknife, and inserted the needle into the poison hollow at the knife's tip, that place where once a sandworm's nerve had fitted.Her injured arm made the work difficult.She moved carefully and slowly, handling the poisoned needle with caution while she took a wad of spice fiber from its chamber in the kit.The needle's shank fitted tightly into the fiber wad, forming a missile which went tightly into the tube of the sandsnorkel.Holding the weapon flat, Ghanima wormed her way closer to the light, moving slowly to cause minimal disturbance in the alfalfa.As she moved, she studied the insects around the light.Yes, there were piume flies in that fluttering mob.They were notorious biters of human flesh.The poisoned dart might go unnoticed, swatted aside as a biting fly.A decision remained: Which one of those two to take   the man or the woman!Muriz.The name came unbidden into Ghanima's mind.That was the woman's name.It recalled things said about her.She was one of those who fluttered around Palimbasha as the insects fluttered around the light.She was easily swayed, a weak one.Very well.Palimbasha had chosen the wrong companion for this night.Ghanima put the tube to her mouth and, with the memory of the priestess of Jowf clearly in her awareness, she sighted carefully, expelled her breath in one strong surge.Palimbasha batted at his cheek, drew away a hand with a speck of blood on it.The needle was nowhere to be seen, flicked away by the motion of his own hand.The woman said something soothing and Palimbasha laughed.As he laughed, his legs began to give away beneath him.He sagged against the woman, who tried to support him.She was still staggering with the dead weight when Ghanima came up beside her and pressed the point of an unsheathed crysknife against her waist.In a conversational tone, Ghanima said: "Make no sudden moves, Muriz.My knife is poisoned.You may let go of Palimbasha now.He is dead.

"He did not expect to see any effect from these words.Both the Lady Jessica and Idaho gratified his expectations.Farad'n had chosen with care the setting for this first examination of the pair, Shaddam's old State Audience Chamber.What it lacked in grandeur it made up for with exotic appointments.Outside it was a winter afternoon, but the windowless chamber's lighting simulated a timeless summer day bathed in golden light from artfully scattered glowglobes of the purest Ixian crystal.The news from Arrakis filled Farad'n with quiet elation.Leto, the male twin, was dead, killed by an assassin tiger.Ghanima, the surviving sister, was in the custody of her aunt and reputedly was a hostage.The full report did much to explain the presence of Idaho and the Lady Jessica.Sanctuary was what they wanted.Corrino spies reported an uneasy truce on Arrakis.Alia had agreed to submit herself to a test called "the Trial of Possession," the purpose of which had not been fully explained.However, no date had been set for this trial and two Corrino spies believed it might never take place.This much was certain, though: there had been fighting between desert Fremen and the Imperial Military Fremen, an abortive civil war which had brought government to a temporary standstill.Stilgar's holdings were now neutral ground, designated after an exchange of hostages.Ghanima evidently had been considered one of these hostages, although the working of this remained unclear.Jessica and Idaho had been brought to the audience securely bound in suspensor chairs.Both were held down by deadly thin strands of shigawire which would cut flesh at the slightest struggle.Two Sardaukar troopers had brought them, checked the bindings, and had gone away silently.The warning had, indeed, been unnecessary.Jessica had seen the armed mute standing against a wall at her right, an old but efficient projectile weapon in his hand.She allowed her gaze to roam over the room's exotic inlays.The broad leaves of the rare iron bush had been set with eye pearls and interlaced to form the center crescent of the domed ceiling.The floor beneath her was alternate blocks of diamond wood and kabuzu shell arranged within rectangular borders of passaquet bones.These had been set on end, laser cut and polished.Selected hard materials decorated the walls in stress woven patterns which outlined the four positions of the Lion symbol claimed by descendants of the late Shaddam IV.The lions were executed in wild gold.Farad'n had chosen to receive the captives while standing.He wore uniform shorts and a light golden jacket of elf silk open at the throat.His only decoration was the princely starburst of his royal family worn at the left breast.He was attended by the Bashar Tyekanik wearing Sardaukar dress tans and heavy boots, an ornate lasegun carried in a front holster at the belt buckle.Tyekanik, whose heavy visage was known to Jessica from Bene Gesserit reports, stood three paces to the left and slightly behind Farad'n.A single throne of dark wood sat on the floor near the wall directly behind the two."Now," Farad'n said, addressing Jessica, "do you have anything to say?""I would inquire why we are bound thus?"Jessica said, indicating the shigawire."We have only just now received reports from Arrakis to explain your presence here," Farad'n said."Perhaps I'll have you released presently. "He smiled."If you  " He broke off as his mother entered by the State doors behind the captives.Wensicia hurried past Jessica and Idaho without a glance, presented a small message cube to Farad'n, actuated it.He studied the glowing face, glancing occasionally at Jessica, back to the cube.The glowing face went dark and he returned the cube to his mother, indicated that she should show it to Tyekanik.While she was doing this, he scowled at Jessica.Presently Wensicia stationed herself at Farad'n's right hand, the darkened cube in her hand, partly concealed in a fold of her white gown.Jessica glanced to her right at Idaho, but he refused to meet her gaze."The Bene Gesserit are displeased with me," Farad'n said."They believe I was responsible for the death of your grandson. "Jessica held her face emotionless, thinking: So Ghanima's story is to be trusted, unless...She didn't like the suspected unknowns.Idaho closed his eyes, opened them to glance at Jessica, She continued to stare at Farad'n.Idaho had told her about this Rhajia vision, but she'd seemed unworried.He didn't know how to catalogue her lack of emotion.She obviously knew something, though, that she wasn't revealing."This is the situation," Farad'n said, and he proceeded to explain everything he'd learned about events on Arrakis, leaving out nothing.He concluded: "Your granddaughter survives, but she's reportedly in the custody of the Lady Alia.This should gratify you. ""Did you kill my grandson?"Jessica asked.Farad'n answered truthfully: "I did not.I recently learned of a plot, but it was not of my making. "Jessica looked at Wensicia, saw the gloating expression on that heart shaped face, thought: Her doing!The lioness schemes for her cub.This was a game the lioness might live to regret.Returning her attention to Farad'n, Jessica said: "But the Sisterhood believes you killed him. "Farad'n turned to his mother."Show her the message. "As Wensicia hesitated, he spoke with an edge of anger which Jessica noted for future use."I said show it to her!"Face pale, Wensicia presented the message face of the cube to Jessica, activated it.Words flowed across the face, responding to Jessica's eve movements: "Bene Gesserit Council on Wallach IX files formal protest against House Corrino in assassination of Leto Atreides II.Arguments and showing of evidence are assigned to Landsraad Internal Security Commission.Neutral ground will be chosen and names of judges will be submitted for approval by all parties.Your immediate response required.Sabit Rekush for the Landsraad. "Wensicia returned to her son's side."How do you intend to respond?"Jessica asked.Wensicia said: "Since my son has not yet been formally invested as head of House Corrino, I will   Where are you going?"This last was addressed to Farad'n who, as she spoke, turned and headed for a side door near the watchful mute.Farad'n paused, half turned."I'm going back to my books and the other pursuits which hold much more interest for me. ""How dare you?"Wensicia demanded.A dark flush spread from her neck up across her cheeks."I'll dare quite a few things in my own name," Farad'n said.
