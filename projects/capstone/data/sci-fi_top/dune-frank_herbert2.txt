Ive just glanced at some of the family apartments in the south wing.Theyre much nicer.He stepped closer, touched her arm, admiring her stateliness.And again, he wondered at her unknown ancestry  a renegade House, perhaps?Some black barred royalty?She looked more regal than the Emperors own blood.Under the pressure of his stare, she turned half away, exposing her profile.And he realized there was no single and precise thing that brought her beauty to focus.The face was oval under a cap of hair the color of polished bronze.Her eyes were set wide, as green and clear as the morning skies of Caladan.The nose was small, the mouth wide and generous.Her figure was good but scant: tall and with its curves gone to slimness.He remembered that the lay sisters at the school had called her skinny, so his buyers had told him.But that description was oversimplified.She had brought a regal beauty back into the Atreides line.He was glad that Paul favored her.Wheres Paul?he asked.Someplace around the house taking his lessons with Yueh.Probably in the south wing, he said.I thought I heard Yuehs voice, but I couldnt take time to look.He glanced down at her, hesitating.I came here only to hang the key of Caladan Castle in the dining hall.She caught her breath, stopped the impulse to reach out to him.Hanging the key  there was finality in that action.But this was not the time or place for comforting.I saw our banner over the house as we came in, she said.He glanced at the painting of his father.Where were you going to hang that?Somewhere in here.No.The word rang flat and final, telling her she could use trickery to persuade, but open argument was useless.Still, she had to try, even if the gesture served only to remind herself that she would not trick him.My Lord, she said, If youd only  The answer remains no.I indulge you shamefully in most things, not in this.Ive just come from the dining hall where there are  My Lord!Please.The choice is between your digestion and my ancestral dignity, my dear, he said.They will hang in the dining hall.She sighed.Yes, my Lord.You may resume your custom of dining in your rooms whenever possible.I shall expect you at your proper position only on formal occasions.Thank you, my Lord.And dont go all cold and formal on me!Be thankful that I never married you, my dear.Then itd be your duty to join me at table for every meal.She held her face immobile, nodded.Hawat already has our own poison snooper over the dining table, he said.Theres a portable in your room.You anticipated this  disagreement, she said.My dear, I think also of your comfort.Ive engaged servants.Theyre locals, but Hawat has cleared them  theyre Fremen all.Theyll do until our own people can be released from their other duties.Can anyone from this place be truly safe?Anyone who hates Harkonnens.You may even want to keep the head housekeeper: the Shadout Mapes.Shadout,Jessica said.A Fremen title?Im told it means well dipper, a meaning with rather important overtones here.She may not strike you as a servant type, although Hawat speaks highly of her on the basis of Duncans report.Theyre convinced she wants to serve  specifically that she wants to serve you.Me?The Fremen have learned that youre Bene Gesserit, he said.There are legends here about the Bene Gesserit.The Missionaria Protectiva, Jessica thought.No place escapes them.Does this mean Duncan was successful?she asked.Will the Fremen be our allies?Theres nothing definite, he said.They wish to observe us for a while, Duncan believes.They did, however, promise to stop raiding our outlying villages during a truce period.Thats a more important gain than it might seem.Hawat tells me the Fremen were a deep thorn in the Harkonnen side, that the extent of their ravages was a carefully guarded secret.It wouldnt have helped for the Emperor to learn the ineffectiveness of the Harkonnen military.A Fremen housekeeper, Jessica mused, returning to the subject of the Shadout Mapes.Shell have the all blue eyes.Dont let the appearance of these people deceive you, he said.Theres a deep strength and healthy vitality in them.I think theyll be everything we need.Its a dangerous gamble, she said.Lets not go into that again, he said.She forced a smile.We are committed, no doubt of that.She went through the quick regimen of calmness  the two deep breaths, the ritual thought, then: When I assign rooms, is there anything special I should reserve for you?You must teach me someday how you do that, he said, the way you thrust your worries aside and turn to practical matters.It must be a Bene Gesserit thing.Its a female thing, she said.He smiled.Well, assignment of rooms: make certain I have large office space next to my sleeping quarters.Therell be more paper work here than on Caladan.A guard room, of course.That should cover it.Dont worry about security of the house.Hawats men have been over it in depth.Im sure they have.He glanced at his wristwatch.And you might see that all our timepieces are adjusted for Arrakeen local.Ive assigned a tech to take care of it.Hell be along presently.He brushed a strand of her hair back from her forehead.I must return to the landing field now.The second shuttles due any minute with my staff reserves.Couldnt Hawat meet them, my Lord?You look so tired.The good Thufir is even busier than I am.You know this planets infested with Harkonnen intrigues.Besides, I must try persuading some of the trained spice hunters against leaving.They have the option, you know, with the change of fief  and this planetologist the Emperor and the Landsraad installed as Judge of the Change cannot be bought.Hes allowing the opt.About eight hundred trained hands expect to go out on the spice shuttle and theres a Guild cargo ship standing by.My Lord  She broke off, hesitating.Yes?He will not be persuaded against trying to make this planet secure for us, she thought.And I cannot use my tricks on him.At what time will you be expecting dinner?she asked.Thats not what she was going to ask, he thought, A h h h h, my Jessica, would that we were somewhere else, anywhere away from this terrible place  alone, the two of us, without a care.Ill eat in the officers mess at the field, he said.Dont expect me until very late.And  ah, Ill be sending a guardcar for Paul.I want him to attend our strategy conference.He cleared his throat as though to say something else, then, without warning, turned and strode out, headed for the entry where she could hear more boxes being deposited.His voice sounded once from there, commanding and disdainful, the way he always spoke to servants when he was in a hurry: The Lady Jessicas in the Great Hall.Join her there immediately.The outer door slammed.Jessica turned away, faced the painting of Letos father.It had been done by the famed artist, Albe, during the Old Dukes middle years.He was portrayed in matador costume with a magenta cape flung over his left arm.The face looked young, hardly older than Letos now, and with the same hawk features, the same gray stare.She clenched her fists at her sides, glared at the painting.Damn you!Damn you!Damn you!she whispered.What are your orders, Noble Born?It was a womans voice, thin and stringy.Jessica whirled, stared down at a knobby, gray haired woman in a shapeless sack dress of bondsman brown.The woman looked as wrinkled and desiccated as any member of the mob that had greeted them along the way from the landing field that morning.Every native she had seen on this planet, Jessica thought, looked prune dry and undernourished.Yet, Leto had said they were strong and vital.And there were the eyes, of course  that wash of deepest, darkest blue without any white  secretive, mysterious.Jessica forced herself not to stare.The woman gave a stiff necked nod, said: I am called the Shadout Mapes, Noble Born.What are your orders?You may refer to me as my Lady, Jessica said.Im not noble born.Im the bound concubine of the Duke Leto.Again that strange nod, and the woman peered upward at Jessica with a sly questioning.Theres a wife, then?There is not, nor has there ever been.I am the Dukes only  companion, the mother of his heir designate.Even as she spoke, Jessica laughed inwardly at the pride behind her words.What was it St Augustine said?she asked herself.The mind commands the body and it obeys.The mind orders itself and meets resistance.Yes  I am meeting more resistance lately.I could use a quiet retreat by myself.A weird cry sounded from the road outside the house.It was repeated: Soo soo Sook!Soo soo Sook!Then: Ikhut eigh!Ikhut eigh!And again: Soo soo Sook!What is that?Jessica asked.I heard it several times as we drove through the streets this morning.Only a water seller, my Lady.But youve no need to interest yourself in such as they.The cistern here holds fifty thousand liters and its always kept full.She glanced down at her dress Why, you know, my Lady, I dont even have to wear my stillsuit here!She cackled.And me not even dead!Jessica hesitated, wanting to question this Fremen woman, needing data to guide her.But bringing order out of the confusion in the castle was more imperative.Still, she found the thought unsettling that water was a major mark of wealth here.My husband told me of your title, Shadout,Jessica said.I recognized the word.Its a very ancient word.You know the ancient tongues then?Mapes asked, and she waited with an odd intensity.Tongues are the Bene Gesserits first learning,Jessica said.I know the Bhotani Jib and the Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.Mapes nodded.Just as the legend says.And Jessica wondered: Why do I play out this sham?But the Bene Gesserit ways were devious and compelling.I know the Dark Things and the ways of the Great Mother, Jessica said.She read the more obvious signs in Mapes action and appearance, the petit betrayals.Miseces prejia, she said in the Chakobsa tongue.Andral tre pera!Trada cik buscakri miseces perakri  Mapes took a backward step, appeared poised to flee.I know many things, Jessica said.I know that you have borne children, that you have lost loved ones, that you have hidden in fear and that you have done violence and will yet do more violence.I know many things.In a low voice, Mapes said: I meant no offense, my Lady.You speak of the legend and seek answers, Jessica said.Beware the answers you may find.I know you came prepared for violence with a weapon in your bodice.My Lady, I   Theres a remote possibility you could draw my lifes blood, Jessica said, but in so doing youd bring down more ruin than your wildest fears could imagine.There are worse things than dying, you know  even for an entire people.My Lady!Mapes pleaded.She appeared about to fall to her knees.The weapon was sent as a gift to you should you prove to be the One.And as the means of my death should I prove otherwise, Jessica said.She waited in the seeming relaxation that made the Bene Gesserit trained so terrifying in combat.Now we see which way the decision tips, she thought.Slowly, Mapes reached into the neck of her dress, brought out a dark sheath.A black handle with deep finger ridges protruded from it.She took sheath in one hand and handle in the other, withdrew a milk white blade, held it up.The blade seemed to shine and glitter with a light of its own.It was double edged like a kindjal and the blade was perhaps twenty centimeters long.Do you know this, my Lady?Mapes asked.It could only be one thing, Jessica knew, the fabled crysknife of Arrakis, the blade that had never been taken off the planet, and was known only by rumor and wild gossip.Its a crysknife, she said.Say it not lightly, Mapes said.Do you know its meaning?And Jessica thought: There was an edge to that question.Heres the reason this Fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question.My answer could precipitate violence or  what?She seeks an answer from me: the meaning of a knife.Shes called the Shadout in the Chakobsa tongue.Knife, thats Death Maker in Chakobsa.Shes getting restive.I must answer now.Delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer.Jessica said: Its a maker  Eighe e e e e e!Mapes wailed.It was a sound of grief and elation.She trembled so hard the knife blade sent glittering shards of reflection shooting around the room.Jessica waited, poised.She had intended to say the knife was a maker of death and then add the ancient word, but every sense warned her now, all the deep training of alertness that exposed meaning in the most casual muscle twitch.The key word was  maker.Maker?Maker.Still, Mapes held the knife as though ready to use it.Jessica said: Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great Mother, would not know the Maker?Mapes lowered the knife.My Lady, when one has lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock.Jessica thought about the prophecy  the Shari a and all the  panoplia propheticus, a Bene Gesserit of the Missionaria Protectiva dropped here long centuries ago  long dead, no doubt, but her purpose accomplished: the protective legends implanted in these people against the day of a Bene Gesserits need.Well, that day had come.Mapes returned knife to sheath, said: This is an unfixed blade, my Lady.Keep it near you.More than a week away from flesh and it begins to disintegrate.Its yours, a tooth of shaihulud, for as long as you live.Jessica reached out her right hand, risked a gamble: Mapes, youve sheathed that blade unblooded.With a gasp, Mapes dropped the sheathed knife into Jessicas hand, tore open the brown bodice, wailing: Take the water of my life!Jessica withdrew the blade from its sheath.How it glittered!She directed the point toward Mapes, saw a fear greater than death panic come over the woman.Poison in the point?Jessica wondered.She tipped up the point, drew a delicate scratch with the blades edge above Mapes left breast.There was a thick welling of blood that stopped almost immediately.Ultrafast coagulation, Jessica thought.A moisture conserving mutation?She sheathed the blade, said: Button your dress, Mapes.Mapes obeyed, trembling.The eyes without whites stared at Jessica, You are ours, she muttered.You are the One.There came another sound of unloading in the entry.Swiftly, Mapes grabbed the sheathed knife, concealed it in Jessicas bodice.Who sees that knife must be cleansed or slain!she snarled.You know that, my Lady!I know it now, Jessica thought.The cargo handlers left without intruding on the Great Hall.Mapes composed herself, said: The uncleansed who have seen a crysknife may not leave Arrakis alive.Never forget that, my Lady.Youve been entrusted with a crysknife.She took a deep breath.Now the thing must take its course.It cannot be hurried.She glanced at the stacked boxes and piled goods around them.And theres work aplenty to while the time for us here.Jessica hesitated.The thing must take its course.That was a specific catchphrase from the Missionaria Protectivas stock of incantations  The coming of the Reverend Mother to free you.But Im not a Reverend Mother, Jessica thought.And then: Great Mother!They planted that one here!This must be a hideous place!In matter of fact tones, Mapes said: Whatll you be wanting me to do first, my Lady?Instinct warned Jessica to match that casual tone.She said: The painting of the Old Duke over there, it must be hung on one side of the dining hall.The bulls head must go on the wall opposite the painting.Mapes crossed to the bulls head.What a great beast it must have been to carry such a head, she said.She stooped.Ill have to be cleaning this first, wont I, my Lady?No.But theres dirt caked on its horns.Thats not dirt, Mapes.Thats the blood of our Dukes father.Those horns were sprayed with a transparent fixative within hours after this beast killed the Old Duke.Mapes stood up.Ah, now!she said.Its just blood,Jessica said.Old blood at that.Get some help hanging these now.The beastly things are heavy.Did you think the blood bothered me?Mapes asked.Im of the desert and Ive seen blood aplenty.I  see that you have,Jessica said.And some of it my own, Mapes said.Moren you drew with your puny scratch.Youd rather Id cut deeper?Ah, no!The bodys water is scant enough thout gushing a wasteful lot of it into the air.You did the thing right.And Jessica, noting the words and manner, caught the deeper implications in the phrase, the bodys water.Again she felt a sense of oppression at the importance of water on Arrakis.On which side of the dining hall shall I hang which one of these pretties, my Lady?Mapes asked.Ever the practical one, this Mapes, Jessica thought.She said: Use your own judgment, Mapes.It makes no real difference.As you say, my Lady.Mapes stooped, began clearing wrappings and twine from the head.Killed an old duke, did you?she crooned.Shall I summon a handler to help you?Jessica asked.Ill manage, my Lady.Yes, shell manage, Jessica thought.Theres that about this Fremen creature: the drive to manage.Jessica felt the cold sheath of the crysknife beneath her bodice, thought of the long chain of Bene Gesserit scheming that had forged another link here.Because of that scheming, she had survived a deadly crisis.It cannot be hurried, Mapes had said.Yet there was a tempo of headlong rushing to this place that filled Jessica with foreboding.And not all the preparations of the Missionaria Protectiva nor Hawats suspicious inspection of this castellated pile of rocks could dispel the feeling.When youve finished hanging those, start unpacking the boxes, Jessica said.One of the cargo men at the entry has all the keys and knows where things should go.Get the keys and the list from him.If there are any questions Ill be in the south wing.As you will, my Lady, Mapes said.Jessica turned away, thinking: Hawat may have passed this residency as safe, but theres something wrong about the place.I can feel it.An urgent need to see her son gripped Jessica.She began walking toward the arched doorway that led into the passage to the dining hall and the family wings.Faster and faster she walked until she was almost running.Behind her, Mapes paused in clearing the wrappings from the bulls head, looked at the retreating back.Shes the One all right, she muttered.Poor thing.Yueh!Yueh!Yueh!goes the refrain.A million deaths were not enough for Yueh!from A Childs History of MuadDib by the Princess Irulan    The door stood ajar, and Jessica stepped through it into a room with yellow walls.To her left stretched a low settee of black hide and two empty bookcases, a hanging waterflask with dust on its bulging sides.To her right, bracketing another door, stood more empty bookcases, a desk from Caladan and three chairs.At the windows directly ahead of her stood Dr Yueh, his back to her, his attention fixed upon the outside world.Jessica took another silent step into the room.She saw that Yuehs coat was wrinkled, a white smudge near the left elbow as though he had leaned against chalk.He looked, from behind, like a fleshless stick figure in overlarge black clothing, a caricature poised for stringy movement at the direction of a puppet master.Only the squarish block of head with long ebony hair caught in its silver Suk School ring at the shoulder seemed alive  turning slightly to follow some movement outside.Again, she glanced around the room, seeing no sign of her son, but the closed door on her right, she knew, let into a small bedroom for which Paul had expressed a liking.Good afternoon, Dr Yueh, she said.Wheres Paul?He nodded as though to something out the window, spoke in an absent manner without turning: Your son grew tired, Jessica.I sent him into the next room to rest.Abruptly, he stiffened, whirled with mustache flopping over his purpled lips.Forgive me, my Lady!My thoughts were far away  I  did not mean to be familiar.She smiled, held out her right hand.For a moment, she was afraid he might kneel.Wellington, please.To use your name like that  I   Weve known each other six years, she said.Its long past time formalities shouldve been dropped between us  in private.Yueh ventured a thin smile, thinking: I believe it has worked.Now, shell think anything unusual in my manner is due to embarrassment.Shell not look for deeper reasons when she believes she already knows the answer.Im afraid I was woolgathering, he said.Whenever I  feel especially sorry for you, Im afraid I think of you as  well, Jessica.Sorry for me?Whatever for?Yueh shrugged.Long ago, he had realized Jessica was not gifted with the full Truthsay as his Wanna had been.Still, he always used the truth with Jessica whenever possible.It was safest.Youve seen this place, my Jessica.He stumbled over the name, plunged ahead: So barren after Caladan.And the people!Those townswomen we passed on the way here wailing beneath their veils.The way they looked at us.She folded her arms across her breast, hugging herself, feeling the crysknife there, a blade ground from a sandworms tooth, if the reports were right.Its just that were strange to them  different people, different customs.Theyve known only the Harkonnens.She looked past him out the windows.What were you staring at out there?He turned back to the window.The people.Jessica crossed to his side, looked to the left toward the front of the house where Yuehs attention was focused.A line of twenty palm trees grew there, the ground beneath them swept clean, barren.A screen fence separated them from the road upon which robed people were passing.Jessica detected a faint shimmering in the air between her and the people  a house shield  and went on to study the passing throng, wondering why Yueh found them so absorbing.The pattern emerged and she put a hand to her cheek.The way the passing people looked at the palm trees!She saw envy, some hate  even a sense of hope.Each person raked those trees with a fixity of expression.Do you know what theyre thinking?Yueh asked.You profess to read minds?she asked.Those minds, he said.They look at those trees and they think: There are one hundred of us.Thats what they think.She turned a puzzled frown on him.Why?Those are date palms, he said.One date palm requires forty liters of water a day.A man requires but eight liters.A palm, then, equals five men.There are twenty palms out there  one hundred men.But some of those people look at the trees hopefully.They but hope some dates will fall, except its the wrong season.We look at this place with too critical an eye, she said.Theres hope as well as danger here.The spice could make us rich.With a fat treasury, we can make this world into whatever we wish.And she laughed silently at herself: Who am I trying to convince?The laugh broke through her restraints, emerging brittle, without humor.But you cant buy security, she said.Yueh turned away to hide his face from her.If only it were possible to hate these people instead of love them!In her manner, in many ways, Jessica was like his Wanna.Yet that thought carried its own rigors, hardening him to his purpose.The ways of the Harkonnen cruelty were devious.Wanna might not be dead.He had to be certain.Do not worry for us, Wellington, Jessica said.The problems ours, not yours.She thinks I worry for her!He blinked back tears.And I do, of course.But I must stand before that black Baron with his deed accomplished, and take my one chance to strike him then where he is weakest  in his gloating moment!He sighed.Would it disturb Paul if I looked in on him?she asked.Not at all.I gave him a sedative.Hes taking the change well?she asked.Except for getting a bit overtired.Hes excited, but what fifteen year old wouldnt be under these circumstances?He crossed to the door, opened it.Hes in here.Jessica followed, peered into a shadowy room.Paul lay on a narrow cot, one arm beneath a light cover, the other thrown back over his head.Slatted blinds at a window beside the bed wove a loom of shadows across face and blanket.Jessica stared at her son, seeing the oval shape of face so like her own.But the hair was the Dukes  coal colored and tousled.Long lashes concealed the lime toned eyes.Jessica smiled, feeling her tears retreat.She was suddenly caught by the idea of genetic traces in her sons features  her lines in eyes and facial outline, but sharp touches of the father peering through that outline like maturity emerging from childhood.She thought of the boys features as an exquisite distillation out of random patterns  endless queues of happenstance meeting at this nexus.The thought made her want to kneel beside the bed and take her son in her arms, but she was inhibited by Yuens presence.She stepped back, closed the door softly.Yueh had returned to the window, unable to bear watching the way Jessica stared at her son.Why did Wanna never give me children?he asked himself.I know as a doctor there was no physical reason against it.Was there some Bene Gesserit reason?Was she, perhaps, instructed to serve a different purpose?What could it have been?She loved me, certainly.For the first time, he was caught up in the thought that he might be part of a pattern more involuted and complicated than his mind could grasp.Jessica stopped beside him, said: What delicious abandon in the sleep of a child.He spoke mechanically: If only adults could relax like that.Yes.Where do we lose it?he murmured.She glanced at him, catching the odd tone, but her mind was still on Paul, thinking of the new rigors in his training here, thinking of the differences in his life now  so very different from the life they once had planned for him.We do, indeed, lose something, she said.She glanced out to the right at a slope humped with a wind troubled gray green of bushes  dusty leaves and dry claw branches.The too dark sky hung over the slope like a blot, and the milky light of the Arrakeen sun gave the scene a silver cast  light like the crysknife concealed in her bodice.The skys so dark, she said.Thats partly the lack of moisture, he said.Water!she snapped.Everywhere you turn here, youre involved with the lack of water!Its the precious mystery of Arrakis, he said.Why is there so little of it?Theres volcanic rock here.Therere a dozen power sources I could name.Theres polar ice.They say you cant drill in the desert  storms and sandtides destroy equipment faster than it can be installed, if the worms dont get you first.Theyve never found water traces there, anyway.But the mystery, Wellington, the real mystery is the wells thatve been drilled up here in the sinks and basins.Have you read about those?First a trickle, then nothing, he said.But, Wellington, thats the mystery.The water was there.It dries up.And never again is there water.Yet another hole nearby produces the same result: a trickle that stops.Has no one ever been curious about this?It is curious, he said.You suspect some living agency?Wouldnt that have shown in core samples?What would have shown?Alien plant matter  or animal?Who could recognize it?She turned back to the slope.The water is stopped.Something plugs it.Thats my suspicion.Perhaps the reasons known, he said.The Harkonnens sealed off many sources of information about Arrakis.Perhaps there was reason to suppress this.What reason?she asked.And then theres the atmospheric moisture.Little enough of it, certainly, but theres some.Its the major source of water here, caught in windtraps and precipitators.Where does that come from?The polar caps?Cold air takes up little moisture, Wellington.There are things here behind the Harkonnen veil that bear close investigation, and not all of those things are directly involved with the spice.We are indeed behind the Harkonnen veil, he said.Perhaps well  He broke off, noting the sudden intense way she was looking at him.Is something wrong?The way you say Harkonnen, she said.Even my Dukes voice doesnt carry that weight of venom when he uses the hated name.I didnt know you had personal reasons to hate them, Wellington.Great Mother!he thought.Ive aroused her suspicions!Now I must use every trick my Wanna taught me.Theres only one solution: tell the truth as far as I can.He said: You didnt know that my wife, my Wanna  He shrugged, unable to speak past a sudden constriction in his throat.Then: They  The words would not come out.He felt panic, closed his eyes tightly, experiencing the agony in his chest and little else until a hand touched his arm gently.Forgive me, Jessica said.I did not mean to open an old wound.And she thought: Those animals!His wife was Bene Gesserit  the signs are all over him.And its obvious the Harkonnens killed her.Heres another poor victim bound to the Atreides by a cherem of hate.I am sorry, he said.Im unable to talk about it.He opened his eyes, giving himself up to the internal awareness of grief.That, at least, was truth.Jessica studied him, seeing the up angled cheeks, the dark sequins of almond eyes, the butter complexion, and stringy mustache hanging like a curved frame around purpled lips and narrow chin.The creases of his cheeks and forehead, she saw, were as much lines of sorrow as of age.A deep affection for him came over her.Wellington, Im sorry we brought you into this dangerous place, she said.I came willingly, he said.And that, too, was true.But this whole planets a Harkonnen trap.You must know that.It will take more than a trap to catch the Duke Leto, he said.And that, too, was true.Perhaps I should be more confident of him, she said.He is a brilliant tactician.Weve been uprooted, he said.Thats why were uneasy.And how easy it is to kill the uprooted plant, she said.Especially when you put it down in hostile soil.Are we certain the soils hostile?There were water riots when it was learned how many people the Duke was adding to the population, she said.They stopped only when the people learned we were installing new windtraps and condensers to take care of the load.There is only so much water to support human life here, he said.The people know if more come to drink a limited amount of water, the price goes up and the very poor die.But the Duke has solved this.It doesnt follow that the riots mean permanent hostility toward him.And guards, she said.Guards everywhere.And shields.You see the blurring of them everywhere you look.We did not live this way on Caladan.Give this planet a chance, he said.But Jessica continued to stare hard eyed out the window.I can smell death in this place, she said.Hawat sent advance agents in here by the battalion.Those guards outside are his men.The cargo handlers are his men.Thereve been unexplained withdrawals of large sums from the treasury.The amounts mean only one thing: bribes in high places.She shook her head.Where Thufir Hawat goes, death and deceit follow.You malign him.Malign?I praise him.Death and deceit are our only hopes now.I just do not fool myself about Thufirs methods.You should  keep busy, he said.Give yourself no time for such morbid  Busy!What is it that takes most of my time, Wellington?I am the Dukes secretary  so busy that each day I learn new things to fear  things even he doesnt suspect I know.She compressed her lips, spoke thinly: Sometimes I wonder how much my Bene Gesserit business training figured in his choice of me.What do you mean?He found himself caught by the cynical tone, the bitterness that he had never seen her expose.Dont you think, Wellington, she asked, that a secretary bound to one by love is so much safer?That is not a worthy thought, Jessica.The rebuke came naturally to his lips.There was no doubt how the Duke felt about his concubine.One had only to watch him as he followed her with his eyes.She sighed.Youre right.Its not worthy.Again, she hugged herself, pressing the sheathed crysknife against her flesh and thinking of the unfinished business it represented.Therell be much bloodshed soon, she said.The Harkonnens wont rest until theyre dead or my Duke destroyed.The Baron cannot forget that Leto is a cousin of the royal blood  no matter what the distance  while the Harkonnen titles came out of the CHOAM pocketbook.But the poison in him, deep in his mind, is the knowledge that an Atreides had a Harkonnen banished for cowardice after the Battle of Corrn.The old feud, Yueh muttered.And for a moment he felt an acid touch of hate.The old feud had trapped him in its web, killed his Wanna or  worse  left her for Harkonnen tortures until her husband did their bidding.The old feud had trapped him and these people were part of that poisonous thing.The irony was that such deadliness should come to flower here on Arrakis, the one source in the universe of melange, the prolonger of life, the giver of health.What are you thinking?she asked.I am thinking that the spice brings six hundred and twenty thousand Solaris the decagram on the open market right now.That is wealth to buy many things.Does greed touch even you, Wellington?Not greed.What then?He shrugged.Futility.He glanced at her.Can you remember your first taste of spice?It tasted like cinnamon.But never twice the same, he said.Its like life  it presents a different face each time you take it.Some hold that the spice produces a learned flavor reaction.The body, learning a thing is good for it, interprets the flavor as pleasurable  slightly euphoric.And, like life, never to be truly synthesized.I think it wouldve been wiser for us to go renegade, to take ourselves beyond the Imperial reach, she said.He saw that she hadnt been listening to him, focused on her words, wondering: Yes  why didnt she make him do this?She could make him do virtually anything.He spoke quickly because here was truth and a change of subject: Would you think it bold of me Jessica, if I asked a personal question?She pressed against the window ledge in an unexplainable pang of disquiet.Of course not.Youre  my friend.Why havent you made the Duke marry you?She whirled, head up, glaring.Made him marry me?But  I should not have asked, he said.No.She shrugged.Theres good political reason  as long as my Duke remains unmarried some of the Great Houses can still hope for alliance.And  She sighed.motivating people, forcing them to your will, gives you a cynical attitude toward humanity.It degrades everything it touches.If I made him do  this, then it would not be his doing.Its a thing my Wanna might have said, he murmured.And this, too, was truth.He put a hand to his mouth, swallowing convulsively.He had never been closer to speaking out, confessing his secret role.Jessica spoke, shattering the moment.Besides, Wellington, the Duke is really two men.One of them I love very much.Hes charming, witty, considerate  tender  everything a woman could desire.But the other man is  cold, callous, demanding, selfish  as harsh and cruel as a winter wind.Thats the man shaped by the father.Her face contorted.If only that old man had died when my Duke was born!In the silence that came between them, a breeze from a ventilator could be heard fingering the blinds.Presently, she took a deep breath, said, Letos right  these rooms are nicer than the ones in the other sections of the house.She turned, sweeping the room with her gaze.If youll excuse me, Wellington, I want another look through this wing before I assign quarters.He nodded.Of course.And he thought: If only there were some way not to do this thing that I must do.Jessica dropped her arms, crossed to the hall door and stood there a moment, hesitating, then let herself out.All the time we talked he was hiding something, holding something back, she thought.To save my feelings, no doubt.Hes a good man.Again, she hesitated, almost turned back to confront Yueh and drag the hidden thing from him.But that would only shame him, frighten him to learn hes so easily read.I should place more trust in my friends.Many have marked the speed with which MuadDib learned the necessities of Arrakis.The Bene Gesserit, of course, know the basis of this speed.For the others, we can say that MuadDib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn.And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could learn.It is shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult, MuadDib knew that every experience carries its lesson.from The Humanity of MuadDib by the Princess Irulan    Paul lay on the bed feigning sleep.It had been easy to palm Dr Yuehs sleeping tablet, to pretend to swallow it.Paul suppressed a laugh.Even his mother had believed him asleep.He had wanted to jump up and ask her permission to go exploring the house, but had realized she wouldnt approve.Things were too unsettled yet.No.This way was best.If I slip out without asking I havent disobeyed orders.And I will stay in the house where its safe.He heard his mother and Yueh talking in the other room.Their words were indistinct  something about the spice  the Harkonnens.The conversation rose and fell.Pauls attention went to the carved headboard of his bed  a false headboard attached to the wall and concealing the controls for this rooms functions.A leaping fish had been shaped on the wood with thick brown waves beneath it.He knew if he pushed the fishs one visible eye that would turn on the rooms suspensor lamps.One of the waves, when twisted, controlled ventilation.Another changed the temperature.Quietly, Paul sat up in bed.A tall bookcase stood against the wall to his left.It could be swung aside to reveal a closet with drawers along one side.The handle on the door into the hall was patterned on an ornithopter thrust bar.It was as though the room had been designed to entice him.The room and this planet.He thought of the filmbook Yueh had shown him  Arrakis: His Imperial Majestys Desert Botanical Testing Station.It was an old film book from before discovery of the spice.Names flitted through Pauls mind, each with its picture imprinted by the books mnemonic pulse: saguaro, burro bush, date palm, sand verbena, evening primrose, barrel cactus, incense bush, smoke tree, creosote bush  kit fox, desert hawk, kangaroo mouse   Names and pictures, names and pictures from mans terranic past  and many to be found now nowhere else in the universe except here on Arrakis.So many new things to learn about  the spice.And the sandworms.A door closed in the other room.Paul heard his mothers footsteps retreating down the hall.Dr Yueh, he knew, would find something to read and remain in the other room.Now was the moment to go exploring.Paul slipped out of the bed, headed for the bookcase door that opened into the closet.He stopped at a sound behind him, turned.The carved headboard of the bed was folding down onto the spot where he had been sleeping.Paul froze, and immobility saved his life.From behind the headboard slipped a tiny hunter seeker no more than five centimeters long.Paul recognized it at once  a common assassination weapon that every child of royal blood learned about at an early age.It was a ravening sliver of metal guided by some nearby hand and eye.It could burrow into moving flesh and chew its way up nerve channels to the nearest vital organ.The seeker lifted, swung sideways across the room and back.Through Pauls mind flashed the related knowledge, the hunter seekers limitations: Its compressed suspensor field distorted the vision of its transmitter eye.With nothing but the dim light of the room to reflect his target, the operator would be relying on motion  anything that moved.A shield could slow a hunter, give time to destroy it, but Paul had put aside his shield on the bed.Lasguns would knock them down, but lasguns were expensive and notoriously cranky of maintenance  and there was always the peril of explosive pyrotechnics if the laser beam intersected a hot shield.The Atreides relied on their body shields and their wits.Now, Paul held himself in near catatonic immobility, knowing he had only his wits to meet this threat.The hunter seeker lifted another half meter.It rippled through the slatted light from the window blinds, back and forth, quartering the room.I must try to grab it, he thought.The suspensor field will make it slippery on the bottom.I must grip tightly.The thing dropped a half meter, quartered to the left, circled back around the bed.A faint humming could be heard from it.Who is operating that thing?Paul wondered.It has to be someone near.I could shout for Yueh, but it would take him the instant the door opened.The hall door behind Paul creaked.A rap sounded there.The door opened.The hunter seeker arrowed past his head toward the motion.Pauls right hand shot out and down, gripping the deadly thing.It hummed and twisted in his hand, but his muscles were locked on it in desperation.With a violent turn and thrust, he slammed the things nose against the metal doorplate.He felt the crunch of it as the nose eye smashed and the seeker went dead in his hand.Still, he held it  to be certain.Pauls eyes came up, met the open stare of total blue from the Shadout Mapes.Your father has sent for you, she said.There are men in the hall to escort you.Paul nodded, his eyes and awareness focusing on this odd woman in a sacklike dress of bondsman brown.She was looking now at the thing clutched in his hand.Ive heard of suchlike, she said.It wouldve killed me, not so?He had to swallow before he could speak.I  was its target.But it was coming for me.Because you were moving.And he wondered: Who is this creature?Then you saved my life, she said.I saved both our lives.Seems like you couldve let it have me and made your own escape, she said.Who are you?he asked.The Shadout Mapes, housekeeper.How did you know where to find me?Your mother told me.I met her at the stairs to the weirding room down the hall.She pointed to her right.Your fathers men are still waiting.Those will be Hawats men, he thought.We must find the operator of this thing.Go to my fathers men, he said.Tell them Ive caught a hunter seeker in the house and theyre to spread out and find the operator.Tell them to seal off the house and its grounds immediately.Theyll know how to go about it.The operators sure to be a stranger among us.And he wondered: Could it be this creature?But he knew it wasnt.The seeker had been under control when she entered.Before I do your bidding, manling, Mapes said, I must cleanse the way between us.Youve put a water burden on me that Im not sure I care to support.But we Fremen pay our debts  be they black debts or white debts.And its known to us that youve a traitor in your midst.Who it is, we cannot say, but were certain sure of it.Mayhap theres the hand guided that flesh cutter.Paul absorbed this in silence: a traitor.Before he could speak, the odd woman whirled away and ran back toward the entry.He thought to call her back, but there was an air about her that told him she would resent it.Shed told him what she knew and now she was going to do his bidding.The house would be swarming with Hawats men in a minute.His mind went to other parts of that strange conversation: weirding room.He looked to his left where she had pointed.We Fremen.So that was a Fremen.He paused for the mnemonic blink that would store the pattern of her face in his memory  prune wrinkled features darkly browned, blue on blue eyes without any white in them.He attached the label: The Shadout Mapes.Still gripping the shattered seeker, Paul turned back into his room, scooped up his shield belt from the bed with his left hand, swung it around his waist and buckled it as he ran back out and down the hall to the left.Shed said his mother was someplace down here  stairs  a weirding room.What had the Lady Jessica to sustain her in her time of trial?Think you carefully on this Bene Gesserit proverb and perhaps you will see: Any road followed precisely to its end leads precisely nowhere.Climb the mountain just a little bit to test mat its a mountain.From the top of the mountain, you cannot see the mountain.from MuadDib: Family Commentaries by the Princess Irulan    At the end of the south wing, Jessica found a metal stair spiraling up to an oval door.She glanced back down the hall, again up at the door.Oval?she wondered.What an odd shape for a door in a house.Through the windows beneath the spiral stair she could see the great white sun of Arrakis moving on toward evening.Long shadows stabbed down the hall.She returned her attention to the stairs.Harsh sidelighting picked out bits of dried earth on the open metalwork of the steps.Jessica put a hand on the rail, began to climb.The rail felt cold under her sliding palm.She stopped at the door, saw it had no handle, but there was a faint depression on the surface of it where a handle should have been.Surely not a palm lock, she told herself.A palm lock must be keyed to one individuals hand shape and palm lines.But it looked like a palm lock.And there were ways to open any palm lock  as she had learned at school.Jessica glanced back to make certain she was unobserved, placed her palm against the depression in the door.The most gentle of pressures to distort the lines  a turn of the wrist, another turn, a sliding twist of the palm across the surface.She felt the click.But there were hurrying footsteps in the hall beneath her.Jessica lifted her hand from the door, turned, saw Mapes come to the foot of the stairs.There are men in the great hall say theyve been sent by the Duke to get young master Paul, Mapes said.Theyve the ducal signet and the guard has identified them.She glanced at the door, back to Jessica.A cautious one, this Mapes, Jessica thought.Thats a good sign.Hes in the fifth room from this end of the hall, the small bedroom,Jessica said.If you have trouble waking him, call on Dr Yueh in the next room.Paul may require a wakeshot.Again, Mapes cast a piercing stare at the oval door, and Jessica thought she detected loathing in the expression.Before Jessica could ask about the door and what it concealed, Mapes had turned away, hurrying back down the hall.Hawat certified this place, Jessica thought.There cant be anything too terrible in here.She pushed the door.It swung inward onto a small room with another oval door opposite.The other door had a wheel handle.An air lock!Jessica thought.She glanced down, saw a door prop fallen to the floor of the little room.The prop carried Hawats personal mark.The door was left propped open, she thought.Someone probably knocked the prop down accidentally, not realizing the outer door would close on a palm lock.She stepped over the lip into the little room.Why an airlock in a house?she asked herself.And she thought suddenly of exotic creatures sealed off in special climates.Special climate!That would make sense on Arrakis where even the driest of off planet growing things had to be irrigated.The door behind her began swinging closed.She caught it and propped it open securely with the stick Hawat had left.Again, she faced the wheel locked inner door, seeing now a faint inscription etched in the metal above the handle.She recognized Galach words, read:  O, Man!Here is a lovely portion of Gods Creation; then, stand before it and learn to love the perfection of Thy Supreme Friend.Jessica put her weight on the wheel.It turned left and the inner door opened.A gentle draft feathered her cheek, stirred her hair.She felt change in the air, a richer taste.She swung the door wide, looked through into massed greenery with yellow sunlight pouring across it.A yellow sun?she asked herself.Then: Filter glass!She stepped over the sill and the door swung closed behind.A wet planet conservatory, she breathed.Potted plants and low pruned trees stood all about.She recognized a mimosa, a flowering quince, a sondagi, green blossomed pleniscenta, green and white striped akarso  roses   Even roses!She bent to breathe the fragrance of a giant pink blossom, straightened to peer around the room.Rhythmic noise invaded her senses.She parted a jungle overlapping of leaves, looked through to the center of the room.A low fountain stood there, small with fluted lips.The rhythmic noise was a peeling, spooling arc of water falling thud a gallop onto the metal bowl.Jessica sent herself through the quick sense clearing regimen, began a methodical inspection of the rooms perimeter.It appeared to be about ten meters square.From its placement above the end of the hall and from subtle differences in construction, she guessed it had been added onto the roof of this wing long after the original buildings completion.She stopped at the south limits of the room in front of the wide reach of filter glass, stared around.Every available space in the room was crowded with exotic wet climate plants.Something rustled in the greenery.She tensed, then glimpsed a simple clock set servok with pipe and hose arms.An arm lifted, sent out a fine spray of dampness that misted her cheeks.The arm retracted and she looked at what it had watered: a fern tree.Water everywhere in this room  on a planet where water was the most precious juice of life.Water being wasted so conspicuously that it shocked her to inner stillness.She glanced out at the filter yellowed sun.It hung low on a jagged horizon above cliffs that formed part of the immense rock uplifting known as the Shield Wall.Filter glass, she thought.To turn a white sun into something softer and more familiar.Who could have built such a place?Leto?It would be like him to surprise me with such a gift, but there hasnt been time.And hes been busy with more serious problems.She recalled the report that many Arrakeen houses were sealed by airlock doors and windows to conserve and reclaim interior moisture.Leto had said it was a deliberate statement of power and wealth for this house to ignore such precautions, its doors and windows being sealed only against the omnipresent dust.But this room embodied a statement far more significant than the lack of water seals on outer doors.She estimated that this pleasure room used water enough to support a thousand persons on Arrakis  possibly more.Jessica moved along the window, continuing to stare into the room.The move brought into view a metallic surface at table height beside the fountain and she glimpsed a white notepad and stylus there partly concealed by an overhanging fan leaf.She crossed to the table, noted Hawats day signs on it, studied a message written on the pad:   TO THE LADY JESSICA  May this place give you as much pleasure as it has given me.Please permit the room to convey a lesson we learned from the same teachers: the proximity of a desirable thing tempts one to overindulgence.On that path lies danger.My kindest wishes.MARGOT LADY FENRING    Jessica nodded, remembering that Leto had referred to the Emperors former proxy here as Count Fenring.But the hidden message of the note demanded immediate attention, couched as it was in a way to inform her the writer was another Bene Gesserit.A bitter thought touched Jessica in passing: The Count married his Lady.Even as this thought flicked through her mind, she was bending to seek out the hidden message.It had to be there.The visible note contained the code phrase every Bene Gesserit not bound by a School Injunction was required to give another Bene Gesserit when conditions demanded it: On that path lies danger.Jessica felt the back of the note, rubbed the surface for coded dots.Nothing.The edge of the pad came under her seeking fingers.Nothing.She replaced the pad where she had found it, feeling a sense of urgency.Something in the position of the pad?she wondered.But Hawat had been over this room, doubtless had moved the pad.She looked at the leaf above the pad.The leaf!She brushed a finger along the under surface, along the edge, along the stem.It was there!Her fingers detected the subtle coded dots, scanned them in a single passage:  Your son and Duke are in immediate danger.A bedroom has been designed to attract your son.The H loaded it with death traps to be discovered, leaving one that may escape detection.Jessica put down the urge to run back to Paul; the full message had to be learned.Her fingers sped over the dots: I do not know the exact nature of the menace, but it has something to do with a bed.The threat to your Duke involves defection of a trusted companion or lieutenant.The H plan to give you as gift to a minion.To the best of my knowledge, this conservatory is safe.Forgive that I cannot tell more.My sources are few as my Count is not in the pay of the H.  In haste, MF.Jessica thrust the leaf aside, whirled to dash back to Paul.In that instant the airlock door slammed open.Paul jumped through it, holding something in his right hand, slammed the door behind him.He saw his mother, pushed through the leaves to her, glanced at the fountain, thrust his hand and the thing it clutched under the falling water.Paul!She grabbed his shoulder, staring at the hand.What is that?He spoke casually, but she caught the effort behind the tone: Hunter seeker.Caught it in my room and smashed its nose, but I want to be sure.Water should short it out.Immerse it!she commanded.He obeyed.Presently, she said: Withdraw your hand.Leave the thing in the water.He brought out his hand, shook water from it, staring at the quiescent metal in the fountain.Jessica broke off a plant stem, prodded the deadly sliver.It was dead.She dropped the stem into the water, looked at Paul.His eyes studied the room with a searching intensity that she recognized  the B. G.  Way.This place could conceal anything, he said.Ive reason to believe its safe, she said.My room was supposed to be safe, too.Hawat said  It was a hunter seeker, she reminded him.That means someone inside the house to operate it.Seeker control beams have limited range.The thing couldve been spirited in here after Hawats investigation.But she thought of the message of the leaf:  defection of a trusted companion or lieutenant.Not Hawat, surely.Oh, surely not Hawat.Hawats men are searching the house right now, he said.That seeker almost got the old woman who came to wake me.The Shadout Mapes, Jessica said, remembering the encounter at the stairs.A summons from your father to  That can wait, Paul said.Why do you think this rooms safe?She pointed to the note, explained about it.He relaxed slightly.But Jessica remained inwardly tense, thinking: A hunter seeker!Merciful Mother!It took all her training to prevent a fit of hysterical trembling.Paul spoke matter of factly: Its the Harkonnens, of course.We shall have to destroy them.A rapping sounded at the airlock door  the code knock of one of Hawats corps.Come in, Paul called.The door swung wide and a tall man in Atreides uniform with a Hawat insignia on his cap leaned into the room.There you are, sir, he said.The housekeeper said youd be here.He glanced around the room.We found a cairn in the cellar and caught a man in it.He had a seeker console.Ill want to take part in the interrogation, Jessica said.Sorry, my Lady.We messed him up catching him.He died.Nothing to identify him?she asked.Weve found nothing yet, my Lady.Was he an Arrakeen native?Paul asked.Jessica nodded at the astuteness of the question.He has the native look, the man said.Put into that cairn moren a month ago, by the look, and left there to await our coming.Stone and mortar where he came through into the cellar were untouched when we inspected the place yesterday.Ill stake my reputation on it.No one questions your thoroughness, Jessica said.I question it, my Lady.We shouldve used sonic probes down there.I presume thats what youre doing now, Paul said.Yes, sir.Send word to my father that well be delayed.At once, sir.He glanced at Jessica.Its Hawats order that under such circumstances as these the young master be guarded in a safe place.Again his eyes swept the room.What of this place?Ive reason to believe it safe, she said.Both Hawat and I have inspected it.Then Ill mount guard outside here, mLady, until weve been over the house once more.He bowed, touched his cap to Paul, backed out and swung the door closed behind him.Paul broke the sudden silence, saying: Had we better go over the house later ourselves?Your eyes might see things others would miss.This wing was the only place I hadnt examined, she said.I put it off to last because   Because Hawat gave it his personal attention, he said.She darted a quick look at his face, questioning.Do you distrust Hawat?she asked.No, but hes getting old  hes overworked.We could take some of the load from him.Thatd only shame him and impair his efficiency, she said.A stray insect wont be able to wander into this wing after he hears about this.Hell be shamed that  We must take our own measures, he said.Hawat has served three generations of Atreides with honor, she said.He deserves every respect and trust we can pay him  many times over.Paul said: When my father is bothered by something youve done he says Bene Gesserit!like a swear word.And what is it about me that bothers your father?When you argue with him.You are not your father, Paul.And Paul thought: Itll worry her, but I must tell her what that Mapes woman said about a traitor among us.Whatre you holding back?Jessica asked.This isnt like you, Paul  He shrugged, recounted the exchange with Mapes.And Jessica thought of the message of the leaf.She came to a sudden decision, showed Paul the leaf, told him its message.My father must learn of this at once, he said.Ill radiograph it in code and get it off.No, she said.You will wait until you can see him alone.As few as possible must learn about it.Do you mean we should trust no one?Theres another possibility, she said.This message may have been meant to get to us.The people who gave it to us may believe its true, but it may be that the only purpose was to get this message to us.Pauls face remained sturdily somber.To sow distrust and suspicion in our ranks, to weaken us that way, he said.You must tell your father privately and caution him about this aspect of it, she said.I understand.She turned to the tall reach of filter glass, stared out to the southwest where the sun of Arrakis was sinking  a yellowed ball low above the cliffs.Paul turned with her, said: I dont think its Hawat, either.Is it possible its Yueh?Hes not a lieutenant or companion, she said.And I can assure you he hates the Harkonnens as bitterly as we do.Paul directed his attention to the cliffs, thinking: And it couldnt be Gurney  or Duncan.Could it be one of the sub lieutenants?Impossible.Theyre all from families thatve been loyal to us for generations  for good reason.Jessica rubbed her forehead, sensing her own fatigue.So much peril here!She looked out at the filter yellowed landscape, studying it.Beyond the ducal grounds stretched a high fenced storage yard  lines of spice silos in it with stilt legged watchtowers standing around it like so many startled spiders.She could see at least twenty storage yards of silos reaching out to the cliffs of the Shield Wall  silos repeated, stuttering across the basin.Slowly, the filtered sun buried itself beneath the horizon.Stars leaped out.She saw one bright star so low on the horizon that it twinkled with a clear, precise rhythm  a trembling of light: blink blink blink blink blink   Paul stirred beside her in the dusky room.But Jessica concentrated on that single bright star, realizing that it was too low, that it must come from the Shield Wall cliffs.Someone signaling!She tried to read the message, but it was in no code she had ever learned.Other lights had come on down on the plain beneath the cliffs: little yellows spaced out against blue darkness.And one light off to their left grew brighter, began to wink back at the cliff  very fast: blinksquirt, glimmer, blink!And it was gone.The false star in the cliff winked out immediately.Signals  and they filled her with premonition.Why were lights used to signal across the basin?she asked herself.Why couldnt they use the communications network?The answer was obvious: the communinet was certain to be tapped now by agents of the Duke Leto.Light signals could only mean that messages were being sent between his enemies  between Harkonnen agents.There came a tapping at the door behind them and the voice of Hawats man: All clear, sir  mLady.Time to be getting the young master to his father.It is said that the Duke Leto blinded himself to the perils of Arrakis, that he walked heedlessly into the pit.Would it not be more likely to suggest he had lived so long in the presence of extreme danger he misjudged a change in its intensity?Or is it possible he deliberately sacrificed himself that his son might find a better life?All evidence indicates the Duke was a man not easily hoodwinked.from MuadDib: Family Commentaries by the Princess Irulan    The Duke Leto Atreides leaned against a parapet of the landing control tower outside Arrakeen.The nights first moon, an oblate silver coin, hung well above the southern horizon.Beneath it, the jagged cliffs of the Shield Wall shone like parched icing through a dust haze.To his left, the lights of Arrakeen glowed in the haze  yellow  white  blue.He thought of the notices posted now above his signature all through the populous places of the planet: Our Sublime Padishah Emperor has charged me to take possession of this planet and end all dispute.The ritualistic formality of it touched him with a feeling of loneliness.Who was fooled by that fatuous legalism?Not the Fremen, certainly.Nor the Houses Minor who controlled the interior trade of Arrakis  and were Harkonnen creatures almost to a man.They have tried to take the life of my son!The rage was difficult to suppress.He saw lights of a moving vehicle coming toward the landing field from Arrakeen.He hoped it was the guard and troop carrier bringing Paul.The delay was galling even though he knew it was prompted by caution on the part of Hawats lieutenant.They have tried to take the life of my son!He shook his head to drive out the angry thoughts, glanced back at the field where five of his own frigates were posted around the rim like monolithic sentries.Better a cautious delay than   The lieutenant was a good one, he reminded himself.A man marked for advancement, completely loyal.Our Sublime Padishah Emperor   If the people of this decadent garrison city could only see the Emperors private note to his Noble Duke  the disdainful allusions to veiled men and women:  but what else is one to expect of barbarians whose dearest dream is to live outside the ordered security of the faufreluches?The Duke felt in this moment that his own dearest dream was to end all class distinctions and never again think of deadly order.He looked up and out of the dust at the unwinking stars, thought: Around one of those little lights circles Caladan  but Ill never again see my home.The longing for Caladan was a sudden pain in his breast.He felt that it did not come from within himself, but that it reached out to him from Caladan.He could not bring himself to call this dry wasteland of Arrakis his home, and he doubted he ever would.I must mask my feelings, he thought.For the boys sake.If ever hes to have a home, this must be it.I may think of Arrakis as a hell Ive reached before death, but he must find here that which will inspire him.There must be something.A wave of self pity, immediately despised and rejected, swept through him, and for some reason he found himself recalling two lines from a poem Gurney Halleck often repeated   My lungs taste the air of Time  Blown past falling sands     Well, Gurney would find plenty of falling sands here, the Duke thought.The central wastelands beyond those moon frosted cliffs were desert  barren rock, dunes, and blowing dust, an uncharted dry wilderness with here and there along its rim and perhaps scattered through it, knots of Fremen.If anything could buy a future for the Atreides line, the Fremen just might do it.Provided the Harkonnens hadnt managed to infect even the Fremen with their poisonous schemes.They have tried to take the life of my son!A scraping metal racket vibrated through the tower, shook the parapet beneath his arms.Blast shutters dropped in front of him, blocking the view.Shuttles coming in, he thought.Time to go down and get to work.He turned to the stairs behind him, headed down to the big assembly room, trying to remain calm as he descended, to prepare his face for the coming encounter.They have tried to take the life of my son!The men were already boiling in from the field when he reached the yellow domed room.They carried their spacebags over their shoulders, shouting and roistering like students returning from vacation.Hey!Feel that under your dogs?Thats gravity, man!How many Gs does this place pull?Feels heavy.Nine tenths of a G by the book.The crossfire of thrown words filled the big room.Did you get a good look at this hole on the way down?Wheres all the loot this places supposed to have?The Harkonnens took it with em!Me for a hot shower and a soft bed!Havent you heard, stupid?No showers down here.You scrub your ass with sand!Hey!Can it!The Duke!The Duke stepped out of the stair entry into a suddenly silent room.Gurney Halleck strode along at the point of the crowd, bag over one shoulder, the neck of his nine string baliset clutched in the other hand.They were long fingered hands with big thumbs, full of tiny movements that drew such delicate music from the baliset.The Duke watched Halleck, admiring the ugly lump of a man, noting the glass splinter eyes with their gleam of savage understanding.Here was a man who lived outside the faufre luches while obeying their every precept.What was it Paul called him?Gurney, the valorous.Hallecks wispy blond hair trailed across barren spots on his head.His wide mouth was twisted into a pleasant sneer, and the scar of the inkvine whip slashed across his jawline seemed to move with a life of its own.His whole air was of casual, shoulder set capability.He came up to the Duke, bowed.Gurney, Leto said.My Lord.He gestured with the baliset toward the men in the room.This is the last of them.Id have preferred coming in with the first wave, but  There are still some Harkonnens for you, the Duke said.Step aside with me, Gurney, where we may talk.Yours to command, my Lord.They moved into an alcove beside a coin slot water machine while the men stirred restlessly in the big room.Halleck dropped his bag into a corner, kept his grip on the baliset.How many men can you let Hawat have?the Duke asked.Is Thufir in trouble, Sire?Hes lost only two agents, but his advance men gave us an excellent line on the entire Harkonnen setup here.If we move fast we may gain a measure of security, the breathing space we require.He wants as many men as you can spare  men who wont balk at a little knife work.I can let him have three hundred of my best, Halleck said.Where shall I send them?To the main gate.Hawat has an agent there waiting to take them.Shall I get about it at once, Sire?In a moment.We have another problem.The field commandant will hold the shuttle here until dawn on a pretext.The Guild Heighliner that brought us is going on about its business, and the shuttles supposed to make contact with a cargo ship taking up a load of spice.Our spice, mLord?Our spice.But the shuttle also will carry some of the spice hunters from the old regime.Theyve opted to leave with the change of fief and the Judge of the Change is allowing it.These are valuable workers, Gurney, about eight hundred of them.Before the shuttle leaves, you must persuade some of those men to enlist with us.How strong a persuasion, Sire?I want their willing cooperation, Gurney.Those men have experience and skills we need.The fact that theyre leaving suggests theyre not part of the Harkonnen machine.Hawat believes there could be some bad ones planted in the group, but he sees assassins in every shadow.Thufir has found some very productive shadows in his time, mLord.And there are some he hasnt found.But I think planting sleepers in this outgoing crowd would show too much imagination for the Harkonnens.Possibly, Sire.Where are these men?Down on the lower level, in a waiting room.I suggest you go down and play a tune or two to soften their minds, then turn on the pressure.You may offer positions of authority to those who qualify.Offer twenty per cent higher wages than they received under the Harkonnens.No more than that, Sire?I know the Harkonnen pay scales.And to men with their termination pay in their pockets and the wanderlust on them  well, Sire, twenty per cent would hardly seem proper inducement to stay.Leto spoke impatiently: Then use your own discretion in particular cases.Just remember that the treasury isnt bottomless.Hold it to twenty per cent whenever you can.We particularly need spice drivers, weather scanners, dune men  any with open sand experience.I understand, Sire.They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up as the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity of the sand.A very moving quotation, the Duke said.Turn your crew over to a lieutenant.Have him give a short drill on water discipline, then bed the men down for the night in the barracks adjoining the field.Field personnel will direct them.And dont forget the men for Hawat.Three hundred of the best, Sire.He took up his spacebag.Where shall I report to you when Ive completed my chores?Ive taken over a council room topside here.Well hold staff there.I want to arrange a new planetary dispersal order with armored squads going out first.Halleck stopped in the act of turning away, caught Letos eye.Are you anticipating that kind of trouble, Sire?I thought there was a Judge of the Change here.Both open battle and secret, the Duke said.Therell be blood aplenty spilled here before were through.And the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land, Halleck quoted.The Duke sighed.Hurry back, Gurney.Very good, mLord.The whipscar rippled to his grin.Behold, as a wild ass in the desert, go I forth to my work.He turned, strode to the center of the room, paused to relay his orders, hurried on through the men.Leto shook his head at the retreating back.Halleck was a continual amazement  a head full of songs, quotations, and flowery phrases  and the heart of an assassin when it came to dealing with the Harkonnens.Presently, Leto took a leisurely diagonal course across to the lift, acknowledging salutes with a casual hand wave.He recognized a propaganda corps man, stopped to give him a message that could be relayed to the men through channels: those who had brought their women would want to know the women were safe and where they could be found.The others would wish to know that the population here appeared to boast more women than men.The Duke slapped the propaganda man on the arm, a signal that the message had top priority to be put out immediately, then continued across the room.He nodded to the men, smiled, traded pleasantries with a subaltern.Command must always look confident, he thought.All that faith riding on your shoulders while you sit in the critical seat and never show it.He breathed a sigh of relief when the lift swallowed him and he could turn and face the impersonal doors.They have tried to take the life of my son!Over the exit of the Arrakeen landing field, crudely carved as though with a poor instrument, there was an inscription that MuadDib was to repeat many times.He saw it that first night on Arrakis, having been brought to the ducal command post to participate in his fathers first full staff conference.The words of the inscription were a plea to those leaving Arrakis, but they fell with dark import on the eyes of a boy who had just escaped a close brush with death.They said: O you who know what we suffer here, do not forget us in your prayers.from Manual of MuadDib by the Princess Irulan    The whole theory of warfare is calculated risk, the Duke said, but when it comes to risking your own family, the element of calculation gets submerged in  other things.He knew he wasnt holding in his anger as well as he should, and he turned, strode down the length of the long table and back.The Duke and Paul were alone in the conference room at the landing field.It was an empty sounding room, furnished only with the long table, old fashioned three legged chairs around it, and a map board and projector at one end.Paul sat at the table near the map board.He had told his father the experience with the hunter seeker and given the reports that a traitor threatened him.The Duke stopped across from Paul, pounded the table: Hawat told me that house was secure!Paul spoke hesitantly: I was angry, too  at first.And I blamed Hawat.But the threat came from outside the house.It was simple, clever, and direct.And it wouldve succeeded were it not for the training given me by you and many others  including Hawat.Are you defending him?the Duke demanded.Yes.Hes getting old.Thats it.He should be  Hes wise with much experience, Paul said.How many of Hawats mistakes can you recall?I should be the one defending him, the Duke said.Not you.Paul smiled.Leto sat down at the head of the table, put a hand over his sons.Youve  matured lately, Son.He lifted his hand.It gladdens me.He matched his sons smile.Hawat will punish himself.Hell direct more anger against himself over this than both of us together could pour on him.Paul glanced toward the darkened windows beyond the map board, looked at the nights blackness.Room lights reflected from a balcony railing out there.He saw movement and recognized the shape of a guard in Atreides uniform.Paul looked back at the white wall behind his father, then down to the shiny surface of the table, seeing his own hands clenched into fists there.The door opposite the Duke banged open.Thufir Hawat strode through it looking older and more leathery than ever.He paced down the length of the table, stopped at attention facing Leto.My Lord, he said, speaking to a point over Letos head, I have just learned how I failed you.It becomes necessary that I tender my resig  Oh, sit down and stop acting the fool, the Duke said.He waved to the chair across from Paul.If you made a mistake, it was in overestimating the Harkonnens.Their simple minds came up with a simple trick.We didnt count on simple tricks.And my son has been at great pains to point out to me that he came through this largely because of your training.You didnt fail there!He tapped the back of the empty chair.Sit down, I say!Hawat sank into the chair.But  Ill hear no more of it, the Duke said.The incident is past.We have more pressing business.Where are the others?I asked them to wait outside while I  Call them in.Hawat looked into Letos eyes.Sire, I  I know who my true friends are, Thufir, the Duke said.Call in the men.Hawat swallowed.At once, my Lord.He swiveled in the chair, called to the open door: Gurney, bring them in.Halleck led the file of men into the room, the staff officers looking grimly serious followed by the younger aides and specialists, an air of eagerness among them.Brief scuffing sounds echoed around the room as the men took seats.A faint smell of rachag stimulant wafted down the table.Theres coffee for those who want it, the Duke said.He looked over his men, thinking: Theyre a good crew.A man could do far worse for this kind of war.He waited while coffee was brought in from the adjoining room and served, noting the tiredness in some of the faces.Presently, he put on his mask of quiet efficiency, stood up and commanded their attention with a knuckle rap against the table.Well, gentlemen, he said, our civilization appears tove fallen so deeply into the habit of invasion that we cannot even obey a simple order of the Imperium without the old ways cropping up.Dry chuckles sounded around the table, and Paul realized that his father had said the precisely correct thing in precisely the correct tone to lift the mood here.Even the hint of fatigue in his voice was right.I think first wed better learn if Thufir has anything to add to his report on the Fremen, the Duke said.Thufir?Hawat glanced up.Ive some economic matters to go into after my general report, Sire, but I can say now that the Fremen appear more and more to be the allies we need.Theyre waiting now to see if they can trust us, but they appear to be dealing openly.Theyve sent us a gift  stillsuits of their own manufacture  maps of certain desert areas surrounding strongpoints the Harkonnens left behind  He glanced down the table.Their intelligence reports have proved completely reliable and have helped us considerably in our dealings with the Judge of the Change.Theyve also sent some incidental things  jewelry for the Lady Jessica, spice liquor, candy, medicinals.My men are processing the lot right now.There appears to be no trickery.You like these people, Thufir?asked a man down the table.Hawat turned to face his questioner.Duncan Idaho says theyre to be admired.Paul glanced at his father, back to Hawat, ventured a question: Have you any new information on how many Fremen there are?Hawat looked at Paul.From food processing and other evidence, Idaho estimates the cave complex he visited consisted of some ten thousand people, all told.Their leader said he ruled a sietch of two thousand hearths.Weve reason to believe there are a great many such sietch communities.All seem to give their allegiance to someone called Liet.Thats something new, Leto said.It could be an error on my part, Sire.There are things to suggest this Liet may be a local deity.Another man down the table cleared his throat, asked: Is it certain they deal with the smugglers?A smuggler caravan left this sietch while Idaho was there, carrying a heavy load of spice.They used pack beasts and indicated they faced an eighteen day journey.It appears, the Duke said, that the smugglers have redoubled their operations during this period of unrest.This deserves some careful thought.We shouldnt worry too much about unlicenced frigates working off our planet  its always done.But to have them completely outside our observation  thats not good.You have a plan, Sire?Hawat asked.The Duke looked at Halleck.Gurney, I want you to head a delegation, an embassy if you will, to contact these romantic businessmen.Tell them Ill ignore their operations as long as they give me a ducal tithe.Hawat here estimates that graft and extra fighting men heretofore required in their operations have been costing them four times that amount.What if the Emperor gets wind of this?Halleck asked.Hes very jealous of his CHOAM profits, mLord.Leto smiled Well bank the entire tithe openly in the name of Shaddam IV and deduct it legally from our levy support costs.Let the Harkonnens fight that!And well be ruining a few more of the locals who grew fat under the Harkonnen system.No more graft!A grin twisted Hallecks face.Ahh, mLord, a beautiful low blow.Would that I could see the Barons face when he learns of this.The Duke turned to Hawat.Thufir, did you get those account books you said you could buy?Yes, my Lord.Theyre being examined in detail even now.Ive skimmed them, though, and can give a first approximation.Give it, then.The Harkonnens took ten billion Solaris out of here every three hundred and thirty Standard days.A muted gasp ran around the table.Even the younger aides, who had been betraying some boredom, sat up straighter and exchanged wide eyed looks.Halleck murmured: For they shall suck of the abundance of the seas and of the treasure hid in the sand.You see, gentlemen, Leto said.Is there anyone here so naive he believes the Harkonnens have quietly packed up and walked away from all this merely because the Emperor ordered it?There was a general shaking of heads, murmurous agreement.We will have to take it at the point of the sword, Leto said.He turned to Hawat.Thisd be a good point to report on equipment.How many sand crawlers, harvesters, spice factories, and supporting equipment have they left us?A full complement, as it says in the Imperial inventory audited by the Judge of the Change, my Lord, Hawat said.He gestured for an aide to pass him a folder, opened the folder on the table in front of him.They neglect to mention that less than half the crawlers are operable, that only about a third have carryalls to fly them to spice sands  that everything the Harkonnens left us is ready to break down and fall apart.Well be lucky to get half the equipment into operation and luckier yet if a fourth of its still working six months from now.Pretty much as we expected, Leto said.Whats the firm estimate on basic equipment?Hawat glanced at his folder.About nine hundred and thirty harvester factories that can be sent out in a few days.About sixty two hundred and fifty ornithopters for survey, scouting, and weather observation  carryalls, a little under a thousand.Halleck said: Wouldnt it be cheaper to reopen negotiations with the Guild for permission to orbit a frigate as a weather satellite?The Duke looked at Hawat.Nothing new there, eh, Thufir?We must pursue other avenues for now, Hawat said.The Guild agent wasnt really negotiating with us.He was merely making it plain  one Mentat to another  that the price was out of our reach and would remain so no matter how long a reach we develop.Our task is to find out why before we approach him again.One of Hallecks aides down the table swiveled in his chair, snapped: Theres no justice in this!Justice?The Duke looked at the man.Who asks for justice?We make our own justice.We make it here on Arrakis  win or die.Do you regret casting your lot with us, sir?The man stared at the Duke, then: No, Sire.You couldnt turn down the richest planetary source of income in our universe  and I could do nought but follow you.Forgive the outburst, but  He shrugged.we must all feel bitter at times.Bitterness I can understand, the Duke said.But let us not rail about justice as long as we have arms and the freedom to use them.Do any of the rest of you harbor bitterness?If so, let it out.This is friendly council where any man may speak his mind.Halleck stirred, said: I think what rankles, Sire, is that weve had no volunteers from the other Great Houses.They address you as Leto the Just and promise eternal friendship, but only as long as it doesnt cost them anything.They dont know yet whos going to win this exchange, the Duke said.Most of the Houses have grown fat by taking few risks.One cannot truly blame them for this; one can only despise them.He looked at Hawat.We were discussing equipment.Would you care to project a few examples to familiarize the men with this machinery?Hawat nodded, gestured to an aide at the projector.A solido tri D projection appeared on the table surface about a third of the way down from the Duke.Some of the men farther along the table stood up to get a better look at it.Paul leaned forward, staring at the machine.Scaled against the tiny projected human figures around it, the thing was about one hundred and twenty meters long and about forty meters wide.It was basically a long, buglike body moving on independent sets of wide tracks.This is a harvester factory, Hawat said.We chose one in good repair for this projection.Theres one dragline outfit that came in with the first team of Imperial ecologists, though, and its still running  although I dont know how  or why.If thats the one they call Old Maria, it belongs in a museum, an aide said.I think the Harkonnens kept it as a punishment job, a threat hanging over their workers heads.Be good or youll be assigned to Old Maria.Chuckles sounded around the table.Paul held himself apart from the humor, his attention focused on the projection and the question that filled his mind.He pointed to the image on the table, said: Thufir, are there sandworms big enough to swallow that whole?Quick silence settled on the table.The Duke cursed under his breath, then thought: No  they have to face the realities here.Therere worms in the deep desert could take this entire factory in one gulp, Hawat said.Up here closer to the Shield Wall where most of the spicings done there are plenty of worms that could cripple this factory and devour it at their leisure.Why dont we shield them?Paul asked.According to Idahos report, Hawat said, shields are dangerous in the desert.A body size shield will call every worm for hundreds of meters around.It appears to drive them into a killing frenzy.Weve the Fremen word on this and no reason to doubt it.Idaho saw no evidence of shield equipment at the sietch.None at all?Paul asked.Itd be pretty hard to conceal that kind of thing among several thousand people, Hawat said.Idaho had free access to every part of the sietch.He saw no shields or any indication of their use.Its a puzzle, the Duke said.The Harkonnens certainly used plenty of shields here, Hawat said.They had repair depots in every garrison village, and their accounts show a heavy expenditure for shield replacements and parts.Could the Fremen have a way of nullifying shields?Paul asked.It doesnt seem likely, Hawat said.Its theoretically possible, of course  a shire sized static counter charge is supposed to do the trick, but no ones ever been able to put it to the test.Wed have heard about it before now, Halleck said.The smugglers have close contact with the Fremen and wouldve acquired such a device if it were available.And theyd have had no inhibitions against marketing it off planet.I dont like an unanswered question of this importance, Leto said.Thufir, I want you to give top priority to solution of this problem.Were already working on it, my Lord.He cleared his throat.Ah h, Idaho did say one thing: he said you couldnt mistake the Fremen attitude toward shields.He said they were mostly amused by them.The Duke frowned, then: The subject under discussion is spicing equipment.Hawat gestured to his aide at the projector.The solido image of the harvester factory was replaced by a projection of a winged device that dwarfed the images of human figures around it.This is a carryall, Hawat said.Its essentially a large thopter, whose sole function is to deliver a factory to spice rich sands, then to rescue the factory when a sandworm appears.They always appear.Harvesting the spice is a process of getting in and getting out with as much as possible.Admirably suited to Harkonnen morality, the Duke said.Laughter was abrupt and too loud.An ornithopter replaced the carryall in the projection focus.These thopters are fairly conventional, Hawat said.Major modifications give them extended range.Extra care has been used in sealing essential areas against sand and dust.Only about one in thirty is shielded  possibly discarding the shield generators weight for greater range.I dont like this de emphasis on shields, the Duke muttered.And he thought: Is this the Harkonnen secret?Does it mean we wont even be able to escape on shielded frigates if all goes against us?He shook his head sharply to drive out such thoughts, said: Lets get to the working estimate.Whatll our profit figure be?Hawat turned two pages in his notebook.After assessing the repairs and operable equipment, weve worked out a first estimate on operating costs.Its based naturally on a depreciated figure for a clear safety margin.He closed his eyes in Mentat semitrance, said: Under the Harkonnens, maintenance and salaries were held to fourteen per cent.Well be lucky to make it at thirty per cent at first.With reinvestment and growth factors accounted for, including the CHOAM percentage and military costs, our profit margin will be reduced to a very narrow six or seven per cent until we can replace worn out equipment.We then should be able to boost it up to twelve or fifteen per cent where it belongs.He opened his eyes.Unless my Lord wishes to adopt Harkonnen methods.Were working for a solid and permanent planetary base, the Duke said.We have to keep a large percentage of the people happy  especially the Fremen.Most especially the Fremen, Hawat agreed.Our supremacy on Caladan, the Duke said, depended on sea and air power.Here, we must develop something I choose to call desert power.This may include air power, but its possible it may not.I call your attention to the lack of thopter shields.He shook his head.The Harkonnens relied on turnover from off planet for some of their key personnel.We dont dare.Each new lot would have its quota of provocateurs.Then well have to be content with far less profit and a reduced harvest, Hawat said.Our output the first two seasons should be down a third from the Harkonnen average.There it is, the Duke said, exactly as we expected.Well have to move fast with the Fremen.Id like five full battalions of Fremen troops before the first CHOAM audit.Thats not much time, Sire, Hawat said.We dont have much time, as you well know.Theyll be in here with Sardaukar disguised as Harkonnens at the first opportunity.How many do you think theyll ship in, Thufir?Four or five battalions all told, Sire.No more, Guild troop transport costs being what they are.Then five battalions of Fremen plus our own forces ought to do it.Let us have a few captive Sardaukar to parade in front of the Landsraad Council and matters will be much different  profits or no profits.Well do our best, Sire.Paul looked at his father, back to Hawat, suddenly conscious of the Mentats great age, aware that the old man had served three generations of Atreides.Aged.It showed in the rheumy shine of the brown eyes, in the cheeks cracked and burned by exotic weathers, in the rounded curve of shoulders and the thin set of the lips with the cranberry colored stain of sapho juice.So much depends on one aged man, Paul thought.Were presently in a war of assassins, the Duke said, but it has not achieved full scale.Thufir, whats the condition of the Harkonnen machine here?Weve eliminated two hundred and fifty nine of their key people, my Lord.No more than three Harkonnen cells remain  perhaps a hundred people in all.These Harkonnen creatures you eliminated, the Duke said, were they propertied?Most were well situated, my Lord  in the entrepreneur class.I want you to forge certificates of allegiance over the signatures of each of them, the Duke said.File copies with the Judge of the Change.Well take the legal position that they stayed under false allegiance.Confiscate their property, take everything, turn out their families, strip them.And make sure the Crown gets its ten per cent.It must be entirely legal.Thufir smiled, revealing red stained teeth beneath the carmine lips.A move worthy of your grandsire, my Lord.It shames me I didnt think of it first.Halleck frowned across the table, surprised a deep scowl on Pauls face.The others were smiling and nodding.Its wrong, Paul thought.Thisll only make the others fight all the harder.Theyve nothing to gain by surrendering.He knew the actual no holds barred convention that ruled in kanly, but this was the sort of move that could destroy them even as it gave them victory.I have been a stranger in a strange land, Halleck quoted.Paul stared at him, recognizing the quotation from the O. C.  Bible, wondering: Does Gurney, too, wish an end to devious plots?The Duke glanced at the darkness out the windows, looked back at Halleck.Gurney, how many of those sandworkers did you persuade to stay with us?Two hundred eighty six in all, Sire.I think we should take them and consider ourselves lucky.Theyre all in useful categories.No more?The Duke pursed his lips, then: Well, pass the word along to  A disturbance at the door interrupted him.Duncan Idaho came through the guard there, hurried down the length of the table and bent over the Dukes ear.Leto waved him back, said: Speak out, Duncan.You can see this is strategy staff  Paul studied Idaho, marking the feline movements, the swiftness of reflex that made him such a difficult weapons teacher to emulate.Idahos dark round face turned toward Paul, the cave sitter eyes giving no hint of recognition, but Paul recognized the mask of serenity over excitement.Idaho looked down the length of the table, said: Weve taken a force of Harkonnen mercenaries disguised as Fremen.The Fremen themselves sent us a courier to warn of the false band.In the attack, however, we found the Harkonnens had waylaid the Fremen courier  badly wounded him.We were bringing him here for treatment by our medics when he died.Id seen how badly off the man was and stopped to do what I could.I surprised him in the attempt to throw something away.Idaho glanced down at Leto.A knife, mLord, a knife the like of which youve never seen.Crysknife?someone asked.No doubt of it, Idaho said.Milky white and glowing with a light of its own like.He reached into his tunic, brought out a sheath with a black ridged handle protruding from it.Keep that blade in its sheath!The voice came from the open door at the end of the room, a vibrant and penetrating voice that brought them all up, staring.A tall, robed figure stood in the door, barred by the crossed swords of the guard.A light tan robe completely enveloped the man except for a gap in the hood and black veil that exposed eyes of total blue  no white in them at all.Let him enter, Idaho whispered.Pass that man, the Duke said.The guards hesitated, then lowered their swords.The man swept into the room, stood across from the Duke.This is Stilgar, chief of the sietch I visited, leader of those who warned us of the false band, Idaho said.Welcome, sir, Leto said.And why shouldnt we unsheath this blade?Stilgar glanced at Idaho, said: You observed the customs of cleanliness and honor among us.I would permit you to see the blade of the man you befriended.His gaze swept the others in the room.But I do not know these others.Would you have them defile an honorable weapon?I am the Duke Leto, the Duke said.Would you permit me to see this blade?Ill permit you to earn the right to unsheath it, Stilgar said, and, as a mutter of protest sounded around the table, he raised a thin, darkly veined hand.I remind you this is the blade of one who befriended you.In the waiting silence, Paul studied the man, sensing the aura of power that radiated from him.He was a leader  a Fremen leader.A man near the center of the table across from Paul muttered: Whos he to tell us what rights we have on Arrakis?It is said that the Duke Leto Atreides rules with the consent of the governed, the Fremen said.Thus I must tell you the way it is with us: a certain responsibility falls on those who have seen a crysknife.He passed a dark glance across Idaho.They are ours.They may never leave Arrakis without our consent.Halleck and several of the others started to rise, angry expressions on their faces.Halleck said: The Duke Leto determines whether  One moment, please, Leto said, and the very mildness of his voice held them.This must not get out of hand, he thought.He addressed himself to the Fremen: Sir, I honor and respect the personal dignity of any man who respects my dignity.I am indeed indebted to you.And I always pay my debts.If it is your custom that this knife remain sheathed here, then it is so ordered  by me.And if there is any other way we may honor the man who died in our service, you have but to name it.The Fremen stared at the Duke, then slowly pulled aside his veil, revealing a thin nose and full lipped mouth in a glistening blade beard.Deliberately he bent over the end of the table, spat on its polished surface.As the men around the table started to surge to their feet, Idahos voice boomed across the room: Hold!Into the sudden charged stillness, Idaho said: We thank you, Stilgar, for the gift of your bodys moisture.We accept it in the spirit with which it is given.And Idaho spat on the table in front of the Duke.Aside to the Duke, he said: Remember how precious water is here, Sire.That was a token of respect.Leto sank back into his chair, caught Pauls eye, a rueful grin on his sons face, sensed the slow relaxation of tension around the table as understanding came to his men.The Fremen looked at Idaho, said: You measured well in my sietch, Duncan Idaho.Is there a bond on your allegiance to your Duke?Hes asking me to enlist with him, Sire, Idaho said.Would he accept a dual allegiance?Leto asked.You wish me to go with him, Sire?I wish you to make your own decision in the matter, Leto said, and he could not keep the urgency out of his voice.Idaho studied the Fremen.Would you have me under these conditions, Stilgar?Thered be times when Id have to return to serve my Duke.You fight well and you did your best for our friend, Stilgar said.He looked at Leto.Let it be thus: the man Idaho keeps the crysknife he holds as a mark of allegiance to us.He must be cleansed, of course, and the rites observed, but this can be done.He will be Fremen and soldier of the Atreides.There is precedent for this: Liet serves two masters.Duncan?Leto asked.I understand, Sire, Idaho said.It is agreed, then, Leto said.Your water is ours, Duncan Idaho, Stilgar said.The body of our friend remains with your Duke.His water is Atreides water.It is a bond between us.Leto sighed, glanced at Hawat, catching the old Mentats eye.Hawat nodded, his expression pleased.I will await below, Stilgar said, while Idaho makes farewell with his friends.Turok was the name of our dead friend.Remember that when it comes time to release his spirit.You are friends of Turok.Stilgar started to turn away.Will you not stay a while?Leto asked.The Fremen turned back, whipping his veil into place with a casual gesture, adjusting something beneath it.Paul glimpsed what looked like a thin tube before the veil settled into place.Is there reason to stay?the Fremen asked.We would honor you, the Duke said.Honor requires that I be elsewhere soon, the Fremen said.He shot another glance at Idaho, whirled, and strode out past the door guards.If the other Fremen match him, well serve each other well, Leto said.Idaho spoke in a dry voice: Hes a fair sample, Sire.You understand what youre to do, Duncan?Im your ambassador to the Fremen, Sire.Much depends on you, Duncan.Were going to need at least five battalions of those people before the Sardaukar descend on us.This is going to take some doing, Sire.The Fremen are a pretty independent bunch.Idaho hesitated, then: And, Sire, theres one other thing.One of the mercenaries we knocked over was trying to get this blade from our dead Fremen friend.The mercenary says theres a Harkonnen reward of a million Solaris for anyone wholl bring in a single crysknife.Letos chin came up in a movement of obvious surprise.Why do they want one of those blades so badly?The knife is ground from a sandworms tooth; its the mark of the Fremen, Sire.With it, a blue eyed man could penetrate any sietch in the land.Theyd question me unless I were known.I dont look Fremen.But   Piter de Vries, the Duke said.A man of devilish cunning, my Lord, Hawat said.Idaho slipped the sheathed knife beneath his tunic.Guard that knife, the Duke said.I understand, mLord.He patted the transceiver on his belt kit.Ill report soon as possible.Thufir has my call code.Use battle language.He saluted, spun about, and hurried after the Fremen.They heard his footsteps drumming down the corridor.A look of understanding passed between Leto and Hawat, They smiled.Weve much to do, Sire, Halleck said.And I keep you from your work, Leto said.I have the report on the advance bases, Hawat said.Shall I give it another time, Sire?Will it take long?Not for a briefing.Its said among the Fremen that there were more than two hundred of these advance bases built here on Arrakis during the Desert Botanical Testing Station period.All supposedly have been abandoned, but there are reports they were sealed off before being abandoned.Equipment in them?the Duke asked.According to the reports I have from Duncan.Where are they located?Halleck said.The answer to that question, Hawat said, is invariably: Liet knows.God knows, Leto muttered.Perhaps not, Sire, Hawat said.You heard this Stilgar use the name.Could he have been referring to a real person?Serving two masters, Halleck said.It sounds like a religious quotation.And you should know, the Duke said.Halleck smiled.This Judge of the Change, Leto said, the Imperial ecologist  Kynes  Wouldnt he know where those bases are?Sire, Hawat cautioned, this Kynes is an Imperial servant.And hes a long way from the Emperor, Leto said.I want those bases.Theyd be loaded with materials we could salvage and use for repair of our working equipment.Sire!Hawat said.Those bases are still legally His Majestys fief.The weather heres savage enough to destroy anything, the Duke said.We can always blame the weather.Get this Kynes and at least find out if the bases exist.Twere dangerous to commandeer them, Hawat said.Duncan was clear on one thing: those bases or the idea of them hold some deep significance for the Fremen.We might alienate the Fremen if we took those bases.Paul looked at the faces of the men around them, saw the intensity of the way they followed every word.They appeared deeply disturbed by his fathers attitude.Listen to him, Father, Paul said in a low voice.He speaks truth.Sire, Hawat said, those bases could give us material to repair every piece of equipment left us, yet be beyond reach for strategic reasons.Itd be rash to move without greater knowledge.This Kynes has arbiter authority from the Imperium.We mustnt forget that.And the Fremen defer to him.Do it gently, then, the Duke said.I wish to know only if those bases exist.As you will, Sire.Hawat sat back, lowered his eyes.All right, then, the Duke said.We know what we have ahead of us  work.Weve been trained for it.Weve some experience in it.We know what the rewards are and the alternatives are clear enough.You all have your assignments.He looked at Halleck.Gurney, take care of that smuggler situation first.I shall go unto the rebellious that dwell in the dry land, Halleck intoned.Someday Ill catch that man without a quotation and hell look undressed, the Duke said.Chuckles echoed around the table, but Paul heard the effort in them.
