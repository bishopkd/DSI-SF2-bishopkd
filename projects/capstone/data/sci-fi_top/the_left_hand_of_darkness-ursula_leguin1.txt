  1.A Parade in Erhenrang  From the Archives of Hain.Transcript of Ansible Document 01 01101 934 2 Gethen: To the Stabile on Ollul: Report from Genly Ai, First Mobile on Gethen/Winter, Hainish Cycle 93, Ekumenical Year 149097.I'LL MAKE MY REPORTas if I told a story, for I was taught as a child on my homeworld that Truth is a matter of the imagination.The soundest fact may fail or prevail in the style of its telling: like that singular organic jewel of our seas, which grows brighter as one woman wears it and, worn by another, dulls and goes to dust.Facts are no more solid, coherent, round, and real than pearls are.But both are sensitive.The story is not all mine, nor told by me alone.Indeed I am not sure whose story it is; you can judge better.But it is all one, and if at moments the facts seem to alter with an altered voice, why then you can choose the fact you like best; yet none of them are false, and it is all one story.It starts on the 44th diurnal of the Year 1491, which on the planet Winter in the nation Karhide was Odhar hahad Tuwa or the twenty second day of the third month of spring in the Year One.It is always the Year One here.Only the dating of every past and future year changes each New Year's Day, as one counts backwards or forwards from the unitary Now.So it was spring of the Year One in Erhenrang, capital city of Karhide, and I was in peril of my life, and did not know it.I was in a parade.I walked just behind the gossiwors and just before the king.It was raining.Rainclouds over dark towers, rain falling in deep streets, a dark storm beaten city of stone, through which one vein of gold winds slowly.First come merchants, potentates, and artisans of the City Erhenrang, rank after rank, magnificently clothed, advancing through the rain as comfortably as fish through the sea.Their faces are keen and calm.They do not march in step.This is a parade with no soldiers, not even imitation soldiers.Next come the lords and mayors and representatives, one person, or five, or forty five, or four hundred, from each Domain and Co Domain of Karhide, a vast ornate procession that moves to the music of metal horns and hollow blocks of bone and wood and the dry, pure lilting of electric flutes.The various banners of the great Domains tangle in a rain beaten confusion of color with the yellow pennants that bedeck the way, and the various musics of each group clash and interweave in many rhythms echoing in the deep stone street.Next, a troop of jugglers with polished spheres of gold which they hurl up high in flashing flights, and catch, and hurl again, making fountain jets of bright jugglery.All at once, as if they had literally caught the light, the gold spheres blaze bright as glass: the sun is breaking through.Next, forty men in yellow, playing gossiwors.The gossiwor, played only in the king's presence, produces a preposterous disconsolate bellow.Forty of them played together shake one's reason, shake the towers of Erhenrang, shake down a last spatter of rain from the windy clouds.If this is the Royal Music no wonder the kings of Karhide are all mad.Next, the royal party, guards and functionaries and dignitaries of the city and the court, deputies, senators, chancellors, ambassadors, lords of the Kingdom, none of them keeping step or rank yet walking with great dignity; and among them is King Argaven XV, in white tunic and shirt and breeches, with leggings of saffron leather and a peaked yellow cap.A gold finger ring is his only adornment and sign of office.Behind this group eight sturdy fellows bear the royal litter, rough with yellow sapphires, in which no king has ridden for centuries, a ceremonial relic of the Very Long Ago.By the litter walk eight guards armed with "foray guns," also relics of a more barbaric past but not empty ones, being loaded with pellets of soft iron.Death walks behind the king.Behind death come the students of the Artisan Schools, the Colleges, the Trades, and the King's Hearths, long lines of children and young people in white and red and gold and green; and finally a number of soft running, slow, dark cars end the parade.The royal party, myself among them, gather on a platform of new timbers beside the unfinished Arch of the River Gate.The occasion of the parade is the completion of that arch, which completes the new Road and River Port of Erhenrang, a great operation of dredging and building and roadmaking which has taken five years, and will distinguish Argaven XV's reign in the annals of Karhide.We are all squeezed rather tight on the platform in our damp and massive finery.The rain is gone, the sun shines on us, the splendid, radiant, traitorous sun of Winter.I remark to the person on my left, "It's hot.It's really hot. "The person on my left a stocky dark Karhider with sleek and heavy hair, wearing a heavy overtunic of green leather worked with gold, and a heavy white shirt, and heavy breeches, and a neck chain of heavy silver links a hand broad this person, sweating heavily, replies, "So it is. "All about us as we stand jammed on our platform lie the faces of the people of the city, upturned like a shoal of brown, round pebbles, mica glittering with thousands of watching eyes.Now the king ascends a gangplank of raw timbers that leads from the platform up to the top of the arch whose unjoined piers tower over crowd and wharves and river.As he mounts the crowd stirs and speaks in a vast murmur: "Argaven!"He makes no response.They expect none.Gossiwors blow a thunderous discordant blast, cease.Silence.The sun shines on city, river, crowd, and king.Masons below have set an electric winch going, and as the king mounts higher the keystone of the arch goes up past him in its sling, is raised, settled, and fitted almost soundlessly, great ton weight block though it is, into the gap between the two piers, making them one, one thing, an arch.A mason with trowel and bucket awaits the king, up on the scaffolding; all the other workmen descend by rope ladders, like a swarm of fleas.The king and the mason kneel, high between the river and the sun, on their bit of planking.Taking the trowel the king begins to mortar the long joints of the keystone.He does not dab at it and give the trowel back to the mason, but sets to work methodically.The cement he uses is a pinkish color different from the rest of the mortarwork, and after five or ten minutes of watching the king bee work I ask the person on my left, "Are your keystones always set in a red cement?"For the same color is plain around the keystone of each arch of the Old Bridge, that soars beautifully over the river upstream from the arch.Wiping sweat from his dark forehead theman man I must say, having saidhe andhis  the man answers, "Very long ago a keystone was always set in with a mortar of ground bones mixed with blood.Human bones, human blood.Without the bloodbond the arch would fall, you see.We use the blood of animals, these days. "So he often speaks, frank yet cautious, ironic, as if always aware that I see and judge as an alien: a singular awareness in one of so isolate a race and so high a rank.He is one of the most powerful men in the country; I am not sure of the proper historical equivalent of his position, vizier or prime minister or councillor; the Karhidish word for it means the King's Ear.He is lord of a Domain and lord of the Kingdom, a mover of great events.His name is Therem Harth rem ir Estraven.The king seems to be finished with his masonry work, and I rejoice; but crossing under the rise of the arch on his spiderweb of planks he starts in on the other side of the keystone, which after all has two sides.It doesn't do to be impatient in Karhide.They are anything but a phlegmatic people, yet they are obdurate, they are pertinacious, they finish plastering joints.The crowds on the Sess Embankment are content to watch the king work, but I am bored, and hot.I have never before been hot, on Winter; I never will be again; yet I fail to appreciate the event.I am dressed for the Ice Age and not for the sunshine, in layers and layers of clothing, woven plant fiber, artificial fiber, fur, leather, a massive armor against the cold, within which I now wilt like a radish leaf.For distraction I look at the crowds and the other paraders drawn up around the platform, their Domain and Clan banners hanging still and bright in sunlight, and idly I ask Estraven what this banner is and that one and the other.He knows each one I ask about, though there are hundreds, some from remote domains, hearths and tribelets of the Pering Storm border and Kerm Land."I'm from Kerm Land myself," he says when I admire his knowledge."Anyhow it's my business to know the Domains.They are Karhide.To govern this land is to govern its lords.Not that it's ever been done.Do.you know the saying,Karhide is not a nation but a family quarrel? "I haven't, and suspect that Estraven made it up; it has his stamp.At this point another member of thekyorremy , the upper chamber or parliament which Estraven heads, pushes and squeezes a way up close to him and begins talking to him.This is the king's cousin Pemmer Harge rem ir Tibe.His voice is very low as he speaks to Estraven, his posture faintly insolent, his smile frequent.Estraven, sweating like ice in the sun, stays slick and cold as ice, answering Tibe's murmurs aloud in a tone whose commonplace politeness makes the other look rather a fool.I listen, as I watch the king grouting away, but understand nothing except the animosity between Tibe and Estraven.It's nothing to do with me, in any case, and I am simply interested in the behavior of these people who rule a nation, in the old fashioned sense, who govern the fortunes of twenty million other people.Power has become so subtle and complex a thing in the ways taken by the Ekumen that only a subtle mind can watch it work; here it is still limited, still visible.In Estraven, for instance, one feels the man's power as an augmentation of his character; he cannot make an empty gesture or say a word that is not listened to.He knows it, and the knowledge gives him more reality than most people own: a solidness of being, a substantiality, a human grandeur.Nothing succeeds like success.I don't trust Estraven, whose motives are forever obscure; I don't like him; yet I feel and respond to his authority as surely as I do to the warmth of the sun.Even as I think this the world's sun dims between clouds regathering, and soon a flaw of rain runs sparse and hard upriver, spattering the crowds on the Embankment, darkening the sky.As the king comes down the gangplank the light breaks through a last time, and his white figure and the great arch stand out a moment vivid and splendid against the storm darkened south.The clouds close.A cold wind comes tearing up Port and Palace Street, the river goes gray, the trees on the Embankment shudder.The parade is over.Half an hour later it is snowing.As the king's car drove off up Port and Palace Street and the crowds began to move like a rocky shingle rolled by a slow tide, Estraven turned to me again and said, "Will you have supper with me tonight, Mr.Ai?"I accepted, with more surprise than pleasure.Estraven had done a great deal for me in the last six or eight months, but I did not expect or desire such a show of personal favor as an invitation to his house.Harge rem ir Tibe was still close to us, overhearing, and I felt that he was meant to overhear.Annoyed by this sense of effeminate intrigue I got off the platform and lost myself in the mob, crouching and slouching somewhat to do so.I'm not much taller than the Gethenian norm, but the difference is most noticeable in a crowd.That's him, look, there's the Envoy.Of course that was part of my job, but it was a part that got harder not easier as time went on; more and more often I longed for anonymity, for sameness.I craved to be like everybody else.A couple of blocks up Breweries Street I turned off towards my lodgings and suddenly, there where the crowd thinned out, found Tibe walking beside me."A flawless event," said the king's cousin, smiling at me.His long, clean, yellow teeth appeared and disappeared in a yellow face all webbed, though he was not an old man, with fine, soft wrinkles."A good augury for the success of the new Port," I said."Yes indeed. "More teeth."The ceremony of the keystone is most impressive "  "Yes indeed.That ceremony descends to us from very long ago.But no doubt Lord Estraven explained all that to you. ""Lord Estraven is most obliging. "I was trying to speak insipidly, yet everything I said to Tibe seemed to take on a double meaning."Oh very much indeed," said Tibe."Indeed Lord Estraven is famous for his kindness to foreigners. "He smiled again, and every tooth seemed to have a meaning, double, multiple, thirty two different meanings."Few foreigners are so foreign as I, Lord Tibe.I am very grateful for kindnesses. ""Yes indeed, yes indeed!And gratitude's a noble, rare emotion, much praised by the poets.Rare above all here in Erhenrang, no doubt because it's impracticable.This is a hard age we live in, an ungrateful age.Things aren't as they were in our grandparents' days, are they?""I scarcely know, sir, but I've heard the same lament on other worlds. "Tibe stared at me for some while as if establishing lunacy.Then he brought out the long yellow teeth."Ah yes!Yes indeed!I keep forgetting that you come from another planet.But of course that's not a matter you ever forget.Though no doubt life would be much sounder and simpler and safer for you here in Erhenrang if you could forget it, eh?Yes indeed!Here's my car, I had it wait here out of the way.I'd like to offer to drive you to your island, but must forego the privilege, as I'm due at the King's House very shortly and poor relations must be in good time, as the saying is, eh?Yes indeed!"said the king's cousin, climbing into his little black electric car, teeth bared across his shoulder at me, eyes veiled by a net of wrinkles.I walked on home to my island.Its front garden was revealed now that the last of the winter's snow had melted and the winter doors, ten feet aboveground, were sealed off for a few months, till the autumn and the deep snow should return.Around at the side of the building in the mud and the ice and the quick, soft, rank spring growth of the garden, a young couple stood talking.Their right hands were clasped.They were in the first phase of kemmer.The large, soft snow danced about them as they stood barefoot in the icy mud, hands clasped, eyes all for each other.Spring on Winter.I had dinner at my island and at Fourth Hour striking on the gongs of Remny Tower I was at the Palace.*Karhosh, island,the usual word for the apartment boardinghouse buildings that house the greatest part of the urban populations of Karhide.Islands contain 20 to 200 private rooms; meals are communal; some are run as hotels, others as cooperative communes, others combine these types.They are certainly an urban adaptation of the fundamental Karhidish institution of the Hearth, though lacking, of course, the topical and genealogical stability of the Hearth ready for supper.Karhiders eat four solid meals a day, breakfast, lunch, dinner, supper, along with a lot of adventitious nibbling and gobbling in between.There are no large meat animals on Winter, and no mammalian products, milk, butter or cheese; the only high protein, high carbohydrate foods are the various kinds of eggs, fish, nuts, and the Hainish grains.A lowgrade diet for a bitter climate, and one must refuel often.I had got used to eating, as it seemed, every few minutes.It wasn't until later in that year that I discovered the Gethenians have perfected the technique not only of perpetually stuffing, but also of indefinitely starving.The snow still fell, a mild spring blizzard, much pleasanter than the relentless rain of the Thaw just past.I made my way to and through the Palace in the quiet and pale darkness of snowfall, losing my way only once.The Palace of Erhenrang is an inner city, a walled wilderness of palaces, towers, gardens, courtyards, cloisters, roofed bridgeways, roofless tunnel walks, small forests and dungeon keeps, the product of centuries of paranoia on a grand scale.Over it all rise the grim, red, elaborate walls of the Royal House, which though in perpetual use is inhabited by no one beside the king himself.Everyone else, servants, staff, lords, ministers, parliamentarians, guards or whatever, sleeps in another palace or fort or keep or barracks or house inside the walls.Estraven's house, sign of the king's high favor, was the Corner Red Dwelling, built 440 years ago for Harmes, beloved kemmering of Emran III, whose beauty is still celebrated, and who was abducted, mutilated, and rendered imbecile by hirelings of the Inner land Faction.Emran III died forty years after, still wreaking vengeance on his unhappy country: Emran the Illfated.The tragedy is so old that its horror has leached away and only a certain air of faithlessness and melancholy clings to the stones and shadows of the house.The garden was small and walled; serem trees leaned over a rocky pool.In dim shafts of light from the windows of the house I saw snowflakes and the threadlike white sporecases of the trees falling softly together onto the dark water.Estraven stood waiting for me, bareheaded and coatless in the cold, watching that small secret ceaseless descent of snow and seeds in the night.He greeted me quietly and brought me into the house.There were no other guests.I wondered at this, but we went to table at once, and one does not talk business while eating; besides, my wonder was diverted to the meal, which was superb, even the eternal breadapples transmuted by a cook whose art I heartily praised.After supper, by the fire, we drank hot beer.On a world where a common table implement is a little device with which you crack the ice that has formed on your drink between drafts, hot beer is a thing you come to appreciate.Estraven had conversed amiably at table; now, sitting across the hearth from me, he was quiet.Though I had been nearly two years on Winter I was still far from being able to see the people of the planet through their own eyes.I tried to, but my efforts took the form of self consciously seeing a Gethenian first as a man, then as a woman, forcing him into those categories so irrelevant to his nature and so essential to my own.Thus as I sipped my smoking sour beer I thought that at table Estraven's performance had been womanly, all charm and tact and lack of substance, specious and adroit.Was it in fact perhaps this soft supple femininity that I disliked and distrusted in him?For it was impossible to think of him as a woman, that dark, ironic, powerful presence near me in the firelit darkness, and yet whenever I thought of him as a man I felt a sense of falseness, of imposture: in him, or in my own attitude towards him?His voice was soft and rather resonant but not deep, scarcely a man's voice, but scarcely a woman's voice either...but what was it saying?"I'm sorry," he was saying, "that I've had to forestall for so long this pleasure of having you in my house; and to that extent at least I'm glad there is no longer any question of patronage between us. "I puzzled at this a while.He had certainly been my patron in court until now.Did he mean that the audience he had arranged for me with the king tomorrow had raised me to an equality with himself?"I don't think I follow you," I said.At that, he was silent, evidently also puzzled."Well, you understand," he said at last, "being here...you understand that I am no longer acting on your behalf with the king, of course. "He spoke as if ashamed of me, not of himself.Clearly there was a significance in his invitation and my acceptance of it which I had missed.But my blunder was in manners, his in morals.All I thought at first was that I had been right all along not to trust Estraven.He was not merely adroit and not merely powerful, he was faithless.All these months in Erhenrang it had been he who listened to me, who answered my questions, sent physicians and engineers to verify the alienness of my physique and my ship, introduced me to people I needed to know, and gradually elevated me from my first year's status as a highly imaginative monster to my present recognition as the mysterious Envoy, about to be received by the king.Now, having got me up on that dangerous eminence, he suddenly and coolly announced he was withdrawing his support."You've led me to rely on you "  "It was ill done. ""Do you mean that, having arranged this audience, you haven't spoken in favor of my mission to the king, as you " I had the sense to stop short of "promised. ""I can't. "I was very angry, but I met neither anger nor apology in him."Will you tell me why?"After a while he said, "Yes," and then paused again.During the pause I began to think that an inept and undefended alien should not demand reasons from the prime minister of a kingdom, above all when he does not and perhaps never will understand the foundations of power and the workings of government in that kingdom.No doubt this was all a matter ofshifgrethor  prestige, face, place, the pride relationship, the untranslatable and all important principle of social authority in Karhide and all civilizations of Gethen.And if it was I would not understand it."Did you hear what the king said to me at the ceremony today?""No. "Estraven leaned forward across the hearth, lifted the beer jug out of the hot ashes, and refilled my tankard.He said nothing more, so I amplified, "The king didn't speak to you in my hearing. ""Nor in mine," said he.I saw at last that I was missing another signal.Damning his effeminate deviousness, I said, "Are you trying to tell me, Lord Estraven, that you're out of favor with the king?"I think he was angry then, but he said nothing that showed it, only, "I'm not trying to tell you anything, Mr.Ai. ""By God, I wish you would!"He looked at me curiously."Well, then, put it this way.There are some persons in court who are, in your phrase, in favor with the king, but who do not favor your presence or your mission here. "And so you're hurrying to join them, selling me out to save your skin, I thought, but there was no point in saying it.Estraven was a courtier, a politician, and I a fool to have trusted him.Even in a bisexual society the politician is very often something less than an integral man.His inviting me to dinner showed that he thought I would accept his betrayal as easily as he committed it.Clearly face saving was more important than honesty.So I brought myself to say, "I'm sorry that your kindness to me has made trouble for you. "Coals of fire.I enjoyed a flitting sense of moral superiority, but not for long; he was too incalculable.He sat back so that the firelight lay ruddy on his knees and his fine, strong, small hands and on the silver tankard he held, but left his face in shadow: a dark face always shadowed by the thick lowgrowing hair, and heavy brows and lashes, and by a somber blandness of expression.Can one read a cat's face, a seal's, an otter's?Some Gethenians, I thought, are like such animals, with deep bright eyes that do not change expression when you speak."I've made trouble for myself," he answered, "by an act that had nothing to do with you, Mr.Ai.You know that Karhide and Orgoreyn have a dispute concerning a stretch of our border in the high North Fall near Sassinoth.Argaven's grandfather claimed the Sinoth Valley for Karhide, and the Commensals have never recognized the claim.A lot of snow out of one cloud, and it grows thicker.I've been helping some Karhidish farmers who live in the Valley to move back east across the old border, thinking the argument might settle itself if the Valley were simply left to the Orgota, who have lived there for several thousand years.I was in the Administration of the North Fall some years ago, and got to know some of those farmers.I dislike the thought of their being killed in forays, or sent to Voluntary Farms in Orgoreyn.Why not obviate the subject of dispute?...But that's not a patriotic idea.In fact it's a cowardly one, and impugns the shifgrethor of the king himself. "His ironies, and these ins and outs of a border dispute with Orgoreyn, were of no interest to me.I returned to the matter that lay between us.Trust him or not, I might still get some use out of him."I'm sorry," I said, "but it seems a pity that this question of a few farmers may be allowed to spoil the chances of my mission with the king.There's more at stake than a few miles of national boundary. ""Yes.Much more.But perhaps the Ekumen, which is a hundred light years from border to border, will be patient with us a while. ""The Stabiles of the Ekumen are very patient men, sir.They'll wait a hundred years or five hundred for Karhide and the rest of Gethen to deliberate and consider whether or not to join the rest of mankind.I speak merely out of personal hope.And personal disappointment.I own that I thought that with your support "  "I too.Well, the Glaciers didn't freeze overnight... "Cliche came ready to his lips, but his mind was elsewhere.He brooded.I imagined him moving me around with the other pawns in his power game."You came to my country," he said at last, "at a strange time.Things are changing; we are taking a new turning.No, not so much that, as following too far on the way we've been going.I thought that your presence, your mission, might prevent our going wrong, give us a new option entirely."But at the right moment in the right place.It is all exceedingly chancy, Mr.Ai. "Impatient with his generalities, I said, "You imply that this isn't the right moment.Would you advise me to cancel my audience?"My gaffe was even worse in Karhidish, but Estraven did not smile, or wince."I'm afraid only the king has that privilege," he said mildly."Oh God, yes.I didn't mean that. "I put my head in my hands a moment.Brought up in the wide open, free wheeling society of Earth, I would never master the protocol, or the impassivity, so valued by Karhiders.I knew what a king was, Earth's own history is full of them, but I had no experiential feel for privilege no tact.I picked up my tankard and drank a hot and violent draft."Well, I'll say less to the king than I intended to say, when I could count on you. ""Good. ""Why good?"I demanded."Well, Mr.Ai, you're not insane.I'm not insane.But then neither of us is a king, you see...I suppose that you intended to tell Argaven, rationally, that your mission here is to attempt to bring about an alliance between Gethen and the Ekumen.And, rationally, he knows that already;  because, as you know, I told him.I urged your case with him, tried to interest him in you.It was ill done, ill timed.I forgot, being too interested myself, that he's a king, and does not see things rationally, but as a king.All I've told him means to him simply that his power is threatened, his kingdom is a dustmote in space, his kingship is a joke to men who rule a hundred worlds. ""But the Ekumen doesn't rule, it co ordinates.Its power is precisely the power of its member states and worlds.In alliance with the Ekumen, Karhide will become infinitely less threatened and more important than it's ever been. "Estraven did not answer for a while.He sat gazing at the fire, whose flames winked, reflected, from his tankard and from the broad bright silver chain of office over his shoulders.The old house was silent around us.There had been a servant to attend our meal, but Karhiders, having no institutions of slavery or personal bondage, hire services not people, and the servants had all gone off to their own homes by now.Such a man as Estraven must have guards about him somewhere, for assassination is a lively institution in Karhide, but I had seen no guard, heard none.We were alone.I was alone, with a stranger, inside the walls of a dark palace, in a strange snow changed city, in the heart of the Ice Age of an alien world.Everything I had said, tonight and ever since I came to Winter, suddenly appeared to me as both stupid and incredible.How could I expect this man or any other to believe my tales about other worlds, other races, a vague benevolent government somewhere off in outer space?It was all nonsense.I had appeared in Karhide in a queer kind of ship, and I differed physically from Gethenians in some respects; that wanted explaining.But my own explanations were preposterous.I did not, in that moment, believe them myself..."Ibelieve you," said the stranger, the alien alone with me, and so strong had my access of self alienation been that I looked up at him bewildered."I'm afraid that Argaven also believes you.But he does not trust you.In part because he no longer trusts me.I have made mistakes, been careless.I cannot ask for your trust any longer, either, having put you in jeopardy.I forgot what a king is, forgot that the king in his own eyesis Karhide, forgot what patriotism is and that he is, of necessity, the perfect patriot.Let me ask you this, Mr.Ai: do you know, by your own experience, what patriotism is?""No," I said, shaken by the force of that intense personality suddenly turning itself wholly upon me."I don't think I do.If by patriotism you don't mean the love of one's homeland, for that I do know. ""No, I don't mean love, when I say patriotism.I mean fear.The fear of the other.And its expressions are political, not poetical: hate, rivalry, aggression.It grows in us, that fear.It grows in us year by year.We've followed our road too far.And you, who come from a world that outgrew nations centuries ago, who hardly know what I'm talking about, who show us the new road " He broke off.After a while he went on, in control again, cool and polite: "It's because of fear that I refuse to urge your cause with the king, now.But not fear for myself, Mr.Ai.I'm not acting patriotically.There are, after all, other nations on Gethen. "I had no idea what he was driving at, but was sure that he did not mean what he seemed to mean.Of all the dark, obstructive, enigmatic souls I had met in this bleak city, his was the darkest.I would not play his labyrinthine game.I made no reply.After a while he went on, rather cautiously, "If I've understood you, your Ekumen is devoted essentially to the general interest of mankind.Now, for instance, the Orgota have experience in subordinating local interests to a general interest, while Karhide has almost none.And the Commensals of Orgoreyn are mostly sane men, if unintelligent, while the king of Karhide is not only insane but rather stupid. "It was clear that Estraven had no loyalties at all.I said in faint disgust, "It must be difficult to serve him, if that's the case. ""I'm not sure I've ever served the king," said the king's prime minister."Or ever intended to.I'm not anyone's servant.A man must cast his own shadow... "The gongs in Remny Tower were striking Sixth Hour, midnight, and I took them as my excuse to go.As I was putting on my coat in the hallway he said, "I've lost my chance forthe present, for I suppose you'll be leaving Ehrenrang " why did he suppose so?"but I trust a day will come when I can ask you questions again.There's so much I want to know.About your mind speech, in particular; you'd scarcely begun to try to explain it to me. "His curiosity seemed perfectly genuine.He had the effrontery of the powerful.His promises to help me had seemed genuine, too.I said yes, of course, whenever he liked, and that was the evening's end.He showed me out through the garden, where snow lay thin in the light of Gethen's big, dull, rufous moon.I shivered as we went out, for it was well below freezing, and he said with polite surprise, "You're cold?"To him of course it was a mild spring night.I was tired and downcast.I said, "I've been cold ever since I came to this world. ""What do you call it, this world, in your language?""Gethen. ""You gave it no name of your own?""Yes, the First Investigators did.They called it Winter. "We had stopped in the gateway of the walled garden.Outside, the Palace grounds and roofs loomed in a dark snowy jumble lit here and there at various heights by the faint gold slits of windows.Standing under the narrow arch I glanced up, wondering if that keystone too was mortared with bone and blood.Estraven took leave of me and turned away; he was never fulsome in his greetings and farewells.I went off through the silent courts and alleys of the Palace, my boots crunching on the thin moonlit snow, and homeward through the deep streets of the city.I was cold, unconfident, obsessed by perfidy, and solitude, and fear.2.The Place Inside the Blizzard  From a sound tape collection of North Karhidish "hearth tales" in the archives of the College of Historians in Erhenrang, narrator unknown, recorded during the reign of Argaven VIII.ABOUT TWO HUNDREDyears ago in the Hearth of Shath in the Pering Storm border there were two brothers who vowed kemmering to each other.In those days, as now, full brothers were permitted to keep kemmer until one of them should bear a child, but after that they must separate; so it was never permitted them to vow kemmering for life.Yet this they had done.When a child was conceived the Lord of Shath commanded them to break their vow and never meet in kemmer again.On hearing this command one of the two, the one who bore the child, despaired and would hear no comfort or counsel, and procuring poison, committed suicide.Then the people of the Hearth rose up against the other brother and drove him out of Hearth and Domain, laying the shame of the suicide upon him.And since his own lord had exiled him and his story went before him, none would take him in, but after the three days' guesting all sent him from their doors as an outlaw.So from place to place he went until he saw that there was no kindness left for him in his own land, and his crime would not be forgiven.*  (*His transgression of the code controlling incest became a crime when seen as the cause of his brother's suicide.(G. A. ))He had not believed this would be so, being a young man and unhardened.When he saw that it was so indeed, he returned over the land to Shath and as an exile stood in the doorway of the Outer Hearth.This he said to his hearth fellows there: "I am without a face among men.I am not seen.I speak and am not heard.I come and am not welcomed.There is no place by the fire for me, nor food on the table for me, nor a bed made for me to lie in.Yet I still have my name: Getheren is my name.That name I lay on this Hearth as a curse, and with it my shame.Keep that for me.Now nameless I will go seek my death. "Then some of the hearthmen jumped up with, shouts and tumult, intending to kill him, for murder is a lighter shadow on a house than suicide.He escaped them and ran northward over the land towards the Ice, outrunning all who pursued him.They came back all chapfallen to Shath.But Getheren went on, and after two days' journey came to the Pering Ice.** (**The Pering Ice is the glacial sheet that covers the northernmost portion of Karhide, and is (in winter when the Guthen Bay is frozen) contiguous with the Gobrin Ice of Orgoreyn. )For two days he walked northward on the Ice.He had no food with him, nor shelter but his coat.On the Ice nothing grows and no beasts run.It was the month of Susmy and the first great snows were falling those days and nights.He went alone through the storm.On the second day he knew he was growing weaker.On the second night he must lie down and sleep a while.On the third morning waking he saw that his hands were frostbitten, and found that his feet were too, though he could not unfasten his boots to look at them, having no use left of his hands.He began to crawl forward on knees and elbows.He had no reason to do so, as it did not matter whether he died in one place on the Ice or another, but he felt that he should go northward.After a long while the snow ceased to fall around him, and the wind to blow.The sun shone out.He could not see far ahead as he crawled, for the fur of his hood came forward over his eyes.No longer feeling any cold in his legs and arms nor on his face, he thought that the frost had benumbed him.Yet he could still move.The snow that lay over the glacier looked strange to him, as if it were a white grass growing up out of the ice.It bent to his touch and straightened again, like grass blades.He ceased to crawl and sat up, pushing back his hood so he could see around him.As far as he could see lay fields of the snowgrass, white and shining.There were groves of white trees, with white leaves growing on them.The sun shone, and it was windless, and everything was white.Getheren took off his gloves and looked at his hands.They were white as the snow.Yet the frostbite was gone out of them, and he could use his fingers, and stand upon his feet.He felt no pain, and no cold, and no hunger.He saw away over the ice to the north a white tower like the tower of a Domain, and from this  place far away one came walking towards him.After a while Getheren could see that the person was naked, his skin was all white, and his hair was all white.He came nearer, and near enough to speak.Getheren said, "Who are you?"The white man said, "I am your brother and kemmering, Hode. "Hode was the name of his brother who had killed himself.And Getheren saw that the white man was his brother in body and feature.But there was no longer any life in his belly, and his voice sounded thin like the creaking of ice.Getheren asked, "What place is this?"Hode answered, "This is the place inside the blizzard.We who kill ourselves dwell here.Here you and I shall keep our vow. "Getheren was frightened, and he said, "I will not stay here.If you had come away with me from our Hearth into the southern lands we might have stayed together and kept our vow lifelong, no man knowing our transgression.But you broke your vow, throwing it away with your life.And now you cannot say my name. "This was true.Hode moved his white lips, but could not say his brother's name.He came quickly to Getheren reaching out his arms to hold him, and seized him by the left hand.Getheren broke free and ran from him.He ran to the southward, and running saw rise up before him a white wall of falling snow, and when he entered into it he fell again on his knees, and could not run, but crawled.On the ninth day after he had gone up on the Ice he was found in their Domain by people of Orhoch Hearth, which lies northeast of Shath.They did not know who he was nor where he came from, for they found him crawling in the snow, starving, snowblind, his face blackened by sun and frost, and at first he could not speak.Yet he took no lasting harm except in his left hand, which was frozen and must be amputated.Some of the people there said this was Getheren of Shath, of whom they had heard talk; others said it could not be, for that Getheren had gone up on the Ice in the first blizzard of autumn, and was certainly dead.He himself denied that his name was Getheren.When he was well he left Orhoch and the Storm border and went into the southern lands, calling himself Ennoch.When Ennoch was an old man dwelling in the plains of Rer he met a man from his own country, and asked him, "How fares Shath Domain?"The other told him that Shath fared ill.Nothing prospered there in hearth or tilth, all being blighted with illness, the spring seed frozen in the ground or the ripe grain rotten, and so it had been for many years.Then Ennoch told him, "I am Getheren of Shath," and told him how he had gone up on the Ice and what he had met with there.At the end of his tale he said, "Tell them at Shath that I take back my name and my shadow. "Not many days after this Getheren took sick and died.The traveler carried his words back to Shath, and they say that from that time on the domain prospered again, and all went as it should go in field and house and hearth.3.The Mad King  I SLEPT LATEand spent the tail of the morning reading over my own notes on Palace etiquette and the observations on Gethenian psychology and manners made by my predecessors, the Investigators.I didn't take in what I read, which didn't matter since I knew it by heart and was reading merely to shut up the interior voice that kept telling meIt has all gone wrong.When it would not be shut up I argued with it, asserting that I could get on without Estraven perhaps better than with him.After all, my job here was a one man job.There is only one First Mobile.The first news from the Ekumen on any world is spoken by one voice, one man present in the flesh, present and alone.He may be killed, as Pellelge was on Four Taurus, or locked up with madmen, as were the first three Mobiles on Gao, one after the other; yet the practice is kept, because it works.One voice speaking truth is a greater force than fleets and armies, given time; plenty of time; but time is the thing that the Ekumen has plenty of...You don't said the interior voice, but I reasoned it into silence, and arrived at the Palace for my audience with the king at Second Hour full of calm and resolution.It was all knocked right out of me in the anteroom, before I ever saw the king.Palace guards and attendants had showed me to the anteroom, through the long halls and corridors of the King's House.An aide asked me to wait and left me alone in the high windowless room.There I stood, all decked out for a visit with royalty.I had sold my fourth ruby (the Investigators having reported that Gethenians value the carbon jewels much as Terrans do, I came to Winter with a pocketful of gems to pay my way), and spent a third of the proceeds on clothes for the parade yesterday and the audience today: everything new, very heavy and well made as clothing is in Karhide, a white knitfur shirt, gray breeches, the long tabard like overtunic,hieb, of bluegreen leather, new cap, new gloves tucked at the proper angle under the loose belt of the hieb, new boots...The assurance of being well dressed augmented my feeling of calm and resolution.I looked calmly and resolutely about me.Like all the King's House this room was high, red, old, bare, with a musty chill on the air as if the drafts blew in not from other rooms but from other centuries.A fire roared in the fireplace, but did no good.Fires in Karhide are to warm the spirit not the flesh.The mechanical industrial Age of Invention in Karhide is at least three thousand years old, and during those thirty centuries they have developed excellent and economical central heating devices using steam, electricity, and other principles; but they do not install them in their houses.Perhaps if they did they would lose their physiological weatherproofing, like Arctic birds kept in warm tents, who being released get frostbitten feet.I, however, a tropical bird, was cold; cold one way outdoors and cold another way indoors, ceaselessly and more or less thoroughly cold.I walked up and down to warm myself.There was little besides myself and the fire in the long anteroom: a stool and a table on which stood a bowl of fingerstones and an ancient radio of carved wood inlaid with silver and bone, a noble piece of workmanship.It was playing at a whisper, and I turned it a touch louder, hearing the Palace Bulletin replace the droning Chant or Lay that was being broadcast.Karhiders do not read much as a rule, and prefer their news and literature heard not seen; books and televising devices are less common than radios, and newspapers don't exist.I had missed the morning Bulletin on my set at home, and half listened now, my mind elsewhere, until the repetition of the name several times caught my ear at last and stopped my pacing.What was it about Estraven?A proclamation was being reread."Therem Harth rem ir Estraven, Lord of Estre in Kerm, by this order forfeits title of the Kingdom and seat in the Assemblies of the Kingdom, and is commanded to quit the Kingdom and all Domains of Karhide.If he be not gone out of the Kingdom and all Domains in three days' time, or if in his life he return into the Kingdom, he shall be put to death by any man without further judgment.No countryman of Karhide shall suffer Harth rem ir Estraven to speak to him or stay within his house or on his lands, on pain of imprisonment, nor shall any countryman of Karhide give or lend Harth rem ir Estraven money or goods, nor repay any debt owing him, on pain of imprisonment and fine.Let all countrymen of Karhide know and say that the crime for which Harth rem ir Estraven is exiled is the crime of Treason: he having urged privily and openly in Assembly and Palace, under pretense of loyal service to the King, that the Nation Dominion of Karhide cast away its sovereignty and surrender up its power in order to become an inferor and subject nation in a certain Union of Peoples, concerning which let all men know and say that no such Union does exist, being a device and baseless fiction of certain conspiring traitors who seek to weaken the Authority of Karhide in the King, to the profit of the real and present enemies of the land.Odguyrny Tuwa, Eighth Hour, in the Palace in Erhenrang: ARGAVEN HARGE. "The order was printed and posted on several gates and road posts about the city, and the above is verbatim from one such copy.My first impulse was simple.I cut off the radio as if to stop it from giving evidence against me, and scuttled to the door.There of course I stopped.I went back to the table by the fireplace, and stood.I was no longer calm or resolute.I wanted to open my case, get out the ansible, and send an Advise/Urgent!through to Hain.I suppressed this impulse also, as it was even sillier than the first.Fortunately I had no time for more impulses.The double door at the far end of the anteroom was opened and the aide stood aside for me to pass, announcing me, "Genry Ai" my name is Genly, but Karhiders can't sayL  and left me in the Red Hall with King Argaven XV.An immense, high, long room, that Red Hall of the King's House.Half a mile down to the fireplaces.Half a mile up to the raftered ceiling hung with red, dusty drapes or banners all ragged with the years.The windows are only slits or slots in the thick walls, the lights few, high, and dim.My new boots goeck, eck, eck, eck as I walk down the hall towards the king, a six months' journey.Argaven was standing in front of the central and largest fireplace of three, on a low, large dais or platform: a short figure in the reddish gloom, rather potbellied, very erect, dark and featureless in silhouette except for the glint of the big seal ring on his thumb.I stopped at the edge of the dais and, as I had been instructed, did and said nothing."Come up, Mr.Ai.Sit down. "I obeyed, taking the right hand chair by the central hearth.In all this I had been drilled.Argaven did not sit down; he stood ten feet from me with the roaring bright flames behind him, and presently said, "Tell me what you have to tell me, Mr.Ai.You bear a message, they say. "The face that turned towards me, reddened and cratered by firelight and shadow, was as flat and cruel as the moon, Winter's dull rufous moon.Argaven was less kingly, less manly, than he looked at a distance among his courtiers.His voice was thin, and he held his fierce lunatic head at an angle of bizarre arrogance."My lord, what I have to say is gone out of my head.I only just now learned of Lord Estraven's disgrace. "Argaven smiled at that, a stretched, staring grin.He laughed shrilly like an angry woman  pretending to be amused."Damn him," he said, "the proud, posturing, perjuring traitor!You dined with him last night, eh?And he told you what a powerful fellow he is, and how he runs the king, and how easy you'll find me to deal with since he's been talking to me about you eh?Is that what he told you, Mr.Ai?"I hesitated."I'll tell you what he's been saying to me about you, if you've an interest in knowing.He's been advising me to refuse you audience, keep you hanging about waiting, maybe pack you off to Orgoreyn or the Islands.All this halfmonth he's been telling me, damn his insolence!It's he that got packed off to Orgoreyn, ha ha ha !"Again the shrill false laugh, and he clapped his hands together as he laughed.A silent immediate guard appeared between curtains at the end of the dais.Argaven snarled at him and he vanished.Still laughing and still snarling Argaven came up close and stared straight at me.The dark irises of his eyes glowed slightly orange.I was a good deal more afraid of him than I had expected to be.I could see no course to follow among these incoherencies but that of candor.I said, "I can only ask you, sir, whether I'm considered to be implicated in Estraven's crime. ""You?No. "Hestared even more closely at me."I don't know what the devil you are, Mr.Ai, a sexual freak or an artificial monster or a visitor from the Domains of the Void, but you're not a traitor, you've merely been the tool of one.I don't punish tools.They do harm only in the hands of a bad workman.Let me give you some advice. "Argaven said this with curious emphasis and satisfaction, and even then it occurred to me that nobody else, in two years, had ever given me advice.They answered questions, but they never openly gave advice, not even Estraven at his most helpful.It must have to do with shifgrethor."Let no one else use you, Mr.Ai," the king was saying."Keep clear of factions.Tell your own lies, do your own deeds.
