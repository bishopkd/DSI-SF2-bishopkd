Income.Income?Have you any idea, Rabban, how much we spent to bring such military force to bear on the Atreides?Do you have even the first inkling of how much the Guild charges for military transport?Expensive, eh?Expensive!The Baron shot a fat arm toward Rabban.If you squeeze Arrakis for every cent it can give us for sixty years, youll just barely repay us!Rabban opened his mouth, closed it without speaking.Expensive, the Baron sneered.The damnable Guild monopoly on space wouldve ruined us if I hadnt planned for this expense long ago.You should know, Rabban, that we bore the entire brunt of it.We even paid for transport of the Sardaukar.And not for the first time, the Baron wondered if there ever would come a day when the Guild might be circumvented.They were insidious  bleeding off just enough to keep the host from objecting until they had you in their fist where they could force you to pay and pay and pay.Always, the exorbitant demands rode upon military ventures.Hazard rates, the oily Guild agents explained.And for every agent you managed to insert as a watchdog in the Guild Bank structure, they put two agents into your system.Insufferable!Income, then, Rabban said.The Baron lowered his arm, made a fist.You must squeeze.And I may do anything I wish as long as I squeeze?Anything.The cannons you brought, Rabban said.Could I  Im removing them, the Baron said.But you  You wont need such toys.They were a special innovation and are now useless.We need the metal.They cannot go against a shield, Rabban.They were merely the unexpected.It was predictable that the Dukes men would retreat into cliff caves on this abominable planet.Our cannon merely sealed them in.The Fremen dont use shields.You may keep some lasguns if you wish.Yes, mLord.And I have a free hand.As long as you squeeze.Rabbans smile was gloating.I understand perfectly, mLord.You understand nothing perfectly, the Baron growled.Let us have that clear at the outset.What you do understand is how to carry out my orders.Has it occurred to you, Nephew, that there are at least five million persons on this planet?Does mLord forget that I was his regent siridar here before?And if mLord will forgive me, his estimate may be low.Its difficult to count a population scattered among sinks and pans the way they are here.And when you consider the Fremen of  The Fremen arent worth considering!Forgive me, mLord, but the Sardaukar believe otherwise.The Baron hesitated, staring at his nephew.You know something?MLord had retired when I arrived last night.I  ah, took the liberty of contacting some of my lieutenants from  ah, before.Theyve been acting as guides to the Sardaukar.They report that a Fremen band ambushed a Sardaukar force somewhere southeast of here and wiped it out.Wiped out a Sardaukar force?Yes, mLord.Impossible!Rabban shrugged.Fremen defeating Sardaukar, the Baron sneered.I repeat only what was reported to me, Rabban said.It is said this Fremen force already had captured the Dukes redoubtable Thufir Hawat.Ah h h h h h.   The Baron nodded, smiling.I believe the report, Rabban said.Youve no idea what a problem the Fremen were.Perhaps, but these werent Fremen your lieutenants saw.They mustve been Atreides men trained by Hawat and disguised as Fremen.Its the only possible answer.Again, Rabban shrugged.Well, the Sardaukar think they were Fremen.The Sardaukar already have launched a pogrom to wipe out all Fremen.Good!But  Itll keep the Sardaukar occupied.And well soon have Hawat.I know it!I can feel it!Ah, this has been a day!The Sardaukar off hunting a few useless desert bands while we get the real prize!MLord  Rabban hesitated, frowning.Ive always felt that we underestimated the Fremen, both in numbers and in  Ignore them, boy!Theyre rabble.Its the populous towns, cities, and villages that concern us.A great many people there, eh?A great many, mLord.They worry me, Rabban.Worry you?Oh  ninety per cent of them are of no concern.But there are always a few  Houses Minor and so on, people of ambition who might try a dangerous thing.If one of them should get off Arrakis with an unpleasant story about what happened here, Id be most displeased.Have you any idea how displeased Id be?Rabban swallowed.You must take immediate measures to hold a hostage from each House Minor, the Baron said.As far as anyone off Arrakis must learn, this was straightforward House to House battle.The Sardaukar had no part in it, you understand?The Duke was offered the usual quarter and exile, but he died in an unfortunate accident before he could accept.He was about to accept, though.That is the story.And any rumor that there were Sardaukar here, it must be laughed at.As the Emperor wishes it, Rabban said.As the Emperor wishes it.What about the smugglers?No one believes smugglers, Rabban.They are tolerated, but not believed.At any rate, youll be spreading some bribes in that quarter  and taking other measures which Im sure you can think of.Yes, mLord.Two things from Arrakis, then, Rabban: income and a merciless fist.You must show no mercy here.Think of these clods as what they are  slaves envious of their masters and waiting only the opportunity to rebel.Not the slightest vestige of pity or mercy must you show them.Can one exterminate an entire planet?Rabban asked.Exterminate?Surprise showed in the swift turning of the Barons head.Who said anything about exterminating?Well, I presumed you were going to bring in new stock and  I said squeeze, Nephew, not exterminate.Dont waste the population, merely drive them into utter submission.You must be the carnivore, my boy.He smiled, a babys expression in the dimple fat face.A carnivore never stops.Show no mercy.Never stop.Mercy is a chimera.It can be defeated by the stomach rumbling its hunger, by the throat crying its thirst.You must be always hungry and thirsty.The Baron caressed his bulges beneath the suspensors.Like me.I see, mLord.Rabban swung his gaze left and right.Its all clear then, Nephew?Except for one thing, Uncle: the planetologist, Kynes.Ah, yes, Kynes.Hes the Emperors man, mLord.He can come and go as he pleases.And hes very close to the Fremen  married one.Kynes will be dead by tomorrows nightfall.Thats dangerous work, Uncle, killing an Imperial servant.How do you think Ive come this far this quickly?the Baron demanded.His voice was low, charged with unspeakable adjectives.Besides, you need never have feared Kynes would leave Arrakis.Youre forgetting that hes addicted to the spice.Of course!Those who know will do nothing to endanger their supply, the Baron said.Kynes certainly must know.I forgot, Rabban said.They stared at each other in silence.Presently, the Baron said: Incidentally, you will make my own supply one of your first concerns.Ive quite a stockpile of private stuff, but that suicide raid by the Dukes men got most of what wed stored for sale.Rabban nodded.Yes, mLord.The Baron brightened.Now, tomorrow morning, you will assemble what remains of organization here and youll say to them: Our Sublime Padishah Emperor has charged me to take possession of this planet and end all dispute.I understand, mLord.This time, Im sure you do.We will discuss it in more detail tomorrow.Now, leave me to finish my sleep.The Baron deactivated his doorfield, watched his nephew out of sight.A tank brain, the Baron thought.Muscle minded tank brain.They will be bloody pulp here when hes through with them.Then, when I send in Feyd Rautha to take the load off them, theyll cheer their rescuer.Beloved Feyd Rautha.Benign Feyd Rautha, the compassionate one who saves them from a beast.Feyd Rautha, a man to follow and die for.The boy will know by that time how to oppress with impunity.Im sure hes the one we need.Hell learn.And such a lovely body.Really a lovely boy.At the age of fifteen, he had already learned silence.from A Childs History of MuadDib by the Princess Irulan    As Paul fought the thopters controls he grew aware that he was sorting out the interwoven storm forces, his more than Mentat awareness computing on the basis of fractional minutiae.He felt dust fronts, billowings, mixings of turbulence, an occasional vortex.The cabin interior was an angry box lighted by the green radiance of instrument dials.The tan flow of dust outside appeared featureless, but his inner sense began to see through the curtain.I must find the right vortex, he thought.For a long time now he had sensed the storms power diminishing, but still it shook them.He waited out another turbulence.The vortex began as an abrupt billowing that rattled the entire ship.Paul defied all fear to bank the thopter left.Jessica saw the maneuver on the attitude globe.Paul!she screamed.The vortex turned them, twisting, tipping.It lifted the thopter like a chip on a geyser, spewed them up and out  a winged speck within a core of winding dust lighted by the second moon.Paul looked down, saw the dust defined pillar of hot wind that had disgorged them, saw the dying storm trailing away like a dry river into the desert  moon gray motion growing smaller and smaller below as they rode the updraft.Were out of it,Jessica whispered.Paul turned their craft away from the dust in swooping rhythm while he scanned the night sky.Weve given them the slip, he said.Jessica felt her heart pounding.She forced herself to calmness, looked at the diminishing storm.Her time sense said they had ridden within that compounding of elemental forces almost four hours, but part of her mind computed the passage as a lifetime.She felt reborn.It was like the litany, she thought.We faced it and did not resist.The storm passed through us and around us.Its gone, but we remain.I dont like the sound of our wing motion, Paul said.We suffered some damage in there.He felt the grating, injured flight through his hands on the controls.They were out of the storm, but still not out into the full view of his prescient vision.Yet, they had escaped, and Paul sensed himself trembling on the verge of a revelation.He shivered.The sensation was magnetic and terrifying, and he found himself caught on the question of what caused this trembling awareness.Part of it, he felt, was the spice saturated diet of Arrakis.But he thought part of it could be the litany, as though the words had a power of their own.I shall not fear   Cause and effect: he was alive despite malignant forces, and he felt himself poised on a brink of self awareness that could not have been without the litanys magic.Words from the Orange Catholic Bible rang through his memory: What senses do we lack that we cannot see or hear another world all around us?Theres rock all around,Jessica said.Paul focused on the thopters launching, shook his head to clear it.He looked where his mother pointed, saw uplifting rock shapes black on the sand ahead and to the right.He felt wind around his ankles, a stirring of dust in the cabin.There was a hole somewhere, more of the storms doing.Better set us down on sand, Jessica said.The wings might not take full brake.He nodded toward a place ahead where sandblasted ridges lifted into moonlight above the dunes.Ill set us down near those rocks.Check your safety harness.She obeyed, thinking: Weve water and stillsuits.If we can find food, we can survive a long time on this desert.Fremen live here.What they can do we can do.Run for those rocks the instant were stopped, Paul said.Ill take the pack.Run for  She fell silent, nodded.Worms.Our friends, the worms, he corrected her.Theyll get this thopter.Therell be no evidence of where we landed.How direct his thinking, she thought.They glided lower  lower   There came a rushing sense of motion to their passage  blurred shadows of dunes, rocks lifting like islands.The thopter touched a dune top with a soft lurch, skipped a sand valley, touched another dune.Hes killing our speed against the sand, Jessica thought, and permitted herself to admire his competence.Brace yourself!Paul warned.He pulled back on the wing brakes, gently at first, then harder and harder.He felt them cup the air, their aspect ratio dropping faster and faster.Wind screamed through the lapped coverts and primaries of the wings leaves.Abruptly, with only the faintest lurch of warning, the left wing, weakened by the storm, twisted upward and in, slamming across the side of the thopter.The craft skidded across a dune top, twisting to the left.It tumbled down the opposite face to bury its nose in the next dune amid a cascade of sand.They lay stopped on the broken wing side, the right wing pointing toward the stars.Paul jerked off his safety harness, hurled himself upward across his mother, wrenching the door open.Sand poured around them into the cabin, bringing a dry smell of burned flint.He grabbed the pack from the rear, saw that his mother was free of her harness.She stepped up onto the side of the right hand seat and out onto the thopters metal skin.Paul followed, dragging the pack by its straps.Run!he ordered.He pointed up the dune face and beyond it where they could see a rock tower undercut by sandblast winds.Jessica leaped off the thopter and ran, scrambling and sliding up the dune.She heard Pauls panting progress behind.They came out onto a sand ridge that curved away toward the rocks.Follow the ridge, Paul ordered.Itll be faster.They slogged toward the rocks, sand gripping their feet.A new sound began to impress itself on them: a muted whisper, a hissing, an abrasive slithering.Worm, Paul said.It grew louder.Faster!Paul gasped.The first rock shingle, like a beach slanting from the sand, lay no more than ten meters ahead when they heard metal crunch and shatter behind them.Paul shifted his pack to his right arm, holding it by the straps.It slapped his side as he ran.He took his mothers arm with his other hand.They scrambled onto the lifting rock, up a pebble littered surface through a twisted, wind carved channel.Breath came dry and gasping in their throats.I cant run any farther,Jessica panted.Paul stopped, pressed her into a gut of rock, turned and looked down onto the desert.A mound in motion ran parallel to their rock island  moonlit ripples, sand waves, a cresting burrow almost level with Pauls eyes at a distance of about a kilometer.The flattened dunes of its track curved once  a short loop crossing the patch of desert where they had abandoned their wrecked ornithopter.Where the worm had been there was no sign of the aircraft.The burrow mound moved outward into the desert, coursed back across its own path, questing.Its bigger than a Guild spaceship, Paul whispered.I was told worms grew large in the deep desert, but I didnt realize  how big.Nor I,Jessica breathed.Again, the thing turned out away from the rocks, sped now with a curving track toward the horizon.They listened until the sound of its passage was lost in gentle sand stirrings around them.Paul took a deep breath, looked up at the moon frosted escarpment, and quoted from the Kitab al Ibar: Travel by night and rest in black shade through the day.He looked at his mother.We still have a few hours of night.Can you go on?In a moment.Paul stepped out onto the rock shingle, shouldered the pack and adjusted its straps.He stood a moment with a paracompass in his hands.Whenever youre ready, he said.She pushed herself away from the rock, feeling her strength return.Which direction?Where this ridge leads.He pointed.Deep into the desert, she said.The Fremen desert, Paul whispered.And he paused, shaken by the remembered high relief imagery of a prescient vision he had experienced on Caladan.He had seen this desert.But the set of the vision had been subtly different, like an optical image that had disappeared into his consciousness, been absorbed by memory, and now failed of perfect registry when projected onto the real scene.The vision appeared to have shifted and approached him from a different angle while he remained motionless.Idaho was with us in the vision, he remembered.But now Idaho is dead.Do you see a way to go?Jessica asked, mistaking his hesitation.No, he said, but well go anyway.He settled his shoulders more firmly in the pack, struck out up a sand carved channel in the rock.The channel opened onto a moonlit floor of rock with benched ledges climbing away to the south.Paul headed for the first ledge, clambered onto it.Jessica followed.She noted presently how their passage became a matter of the immediate and particular  the sand pockets between rocks where their steps were slowed, the wind carved ridge that cut their hands, the obstruction that forced a choice: Go over or go around?The terrain enforced its own rhythms.They spoke only when necessary and then with the hoarse voices of their exertion.Careful here  this ledge is slippery with sand.Watch you dont hit your head against this overhang.Stay below this ridge; the moons at our backs and itd show our movement to anyone out there.Paul stopped in a bight of rock, leaned the pack against a narrow ledge.Jessica leaned beside him, thankful for the moment of rest.She heard Paul pulling at his stillsuit tube, sipped her own reclaimed water.It tasted brackish, and she remembered the waters of Caladan  a tall fountain enclosing a curve of sky, such a richness of moisture that it hadnt been noticed for itself  only for its shape, or its reflection, or its sound as she stopped beside it.To stop, she thought.To rest  truly rest.It occurred to her that mercy was the ability to stop, if only for a moment.There was no mercy where there could be no stopping.Paul pushed away from the rock ledge, turned, and climbed over a sloping surface.Jessica followed with a sigh.They slid down onto a wide shelf that led around a sheer rock face.Again, they fell into the disjointed rhythm of movement across this broken land.Jessica felt that the night was dominated by degrees of smallness in substances beneath their feet and hands  boulders or pea gravel or flaked rock or pea sand or sand itself or grit or dust or gossamer powder.The powder clogged nose filters and had to be blown out.Pea sand and pea gravel rolled on a hard surface and could spill the unwary.Rock flakes cut.And the omnipresent sand patches dragged against their feet.Paul stopped abruptly on a rock shelf, steadied his mother as she stumbled into him.He was pointing left and she looked along his arm to see that they stood atop a cliff with the desert stretched out like a static ocean some two hundred meters below.It lay there full of moon silvered waves  shadows of angles that lapsed into curves and, in the distance, lifted to the misted gray blur of another escarpment.Open desert, she said.A wide place to cross, Paul said, and his voice was muffled by the filter trap across his face.Jessica glanced left and right  nothing but sand below.Paul stared straight ahead across the open dunes, watching the movement of shadows in the moons passage.About three or four kilometers across, he said.Worms, she said.Sure to be.She focused on her weariness, the muscle ache that dulled her senses.Shall we rest and eat?Paul slipped out of the pack, sat down and leaned against it.Jessica supported herself by a hand on his shoulder as she sank to the rock beside him.She felt Paul turn as she settled herself, heard him scrabbling in the pack.Here, he said.His hand felt dry against hers as he pressed two energy capsules into her palm.She swallowed them with a grudging spit of water from her stillsuit tube.Drink all your water, Paul said.Axiom: the best place to conserve your water is in your body.It keeps your energy up.Youre stronger.Trust your stillsuit.She obeyed, drained her catchpockets, feeling energy return.She thought then how peaceful it was here in this moment of their tiredness, and she recalled once hearing the minstrel warrior Gurney Halleck say, Better a dry morsel and quietness therewith than a house full of sacrifice and strife.Jessica repeated the words to Paul.That was Gurney, he said.She caught the tone of his voice, the way he spoke as of someone dead, thought: And well poor Gurney might be dead.The Atreides forces were either dead or captive or lost like themelves in this waterless void.Gurney always had the right quotation, Paul said.I can hear him now: And I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the hand of the wicked: and I will make the land waste, and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers.Jessica closed her eyes, found herself moved close to tears by the pathos in her sons voice.Presently, Paul said: How do you  feel?She recognized that his question was directed at her pregnancy, said: Your sister wont be born for many months yet.I still feel  physically adequate.And she thought: How stiffly formal I speak to my own son!Then, because it was the Bene Gesserit way to seek within for the answer to such an oddity, she searched and found the source of her formality: Im afraid of my son; I fear his strangeness; I fear what he may see ahead of us, what he may tell me.Paul pulled his hood down over his eyes, listened to the bug hustling sounds of the night.His lungs were charged with his own silence.His nose itched.He rubbed it, removed the filter and grew conscious of the rich smell of cinnamon.Theres melange spice nearby, he said.An eider wind feathered Pauls cheeks, ruffled the folds of his burnoose.But this wind carried no threat of storm; already he could sense the difference.Dawn soon, he said.Jessica nodded.Theres a way to get safely across that open sand, Paul said.The Fremen do it.The worms?If we were to plant a thumper from our Fremkit back in the rocks here, Paul said.Itd keep a worm occupied for a time.She glanced at the stretch of moonlighted desert between them and the other escarpment.Four kilometers worth of time?Perhaps.And if we crossed there making only natural sounds, the kind that dont attract the worms   Paul studied the open desert, questing in his prescient memory, probing the mysterious allusions to thumpers and maker hooks in the Fremkit manual that had come with their escape pack.He found it odd that all he sensed was pervasive terror at thought of the worms.He knew as though it lay just at the edge of his awareness that the worms were to be respected and not feared  if  if   He shook his head.Itd have to be sounds without rhythm,Jessica said.What?Oh.Yes.If we broke our steps  the sand itself must shift down at times.Worms cant investigate every little sound.We should be fully rested before we try it, though.He looked across at that other rock wall, seeing the passage of time in the vertical moonshadows there.Itll be dawn within the hour.Wherell we spend the day?she asked.Paul turned left, pointed.The cliff curves back north over there.You can see by the way its wind cut thats the windward face.Therell be crevasses there, deep ones.Had we better get started?she asked.He stood, helped her to her feet.Are you rested enough for a climb down?I want to get as close as possible to the desert floor before we camp.Enough.She nodded for him to lead the way.He hesitated, then lifted the pack, settled it onto his shoulders and turned along the cliff.If only we had suspensors, Jessica thought.Itd be such a simple matter to jump down there.But perhaps suspensors are another thing to avoid in the open desert.Maybe they attract the worms the way a shield does.They came to a series of shelves dropping down and, beyond them, saw a fissure with its ledge outlined by moonshadow leading along the vestibule.Paul led the way down, moving cautiously but hurrying because it was obvious the moonlight could not last much longer.They wound down into a world of deeper and deeper shadows.Hints of rock shape climbed to the stars around them.The fissure narrowed to some ten meters width at the brink of a dim gray sandslope that slanted downward into darkness.Can we go down?Jessica whispered.I think so.He tested the surface with one foot.We can slide down, he said.Ill go first.Wait until you hear me stop.Careful, she said.He stepped onto the slope and slid and slipped down its soft surface onto an almost level floor of packed sand.The place was deep within the rock walls.There came the sound of sand sliding behind him.He tried to see up the slope in the darkness, was almost knocked over by the cascade.It trailed away to silence.Mother?he said.There was no answer.Mother?He dropped the pack, hurled himself up the slope, scrambling; digging, throwing sand like a wild man.Mother!he gasped.Mother, where are you?Another cascade of sand swept down on him, burying him to the hips.He wrenched himself out of it.Shes been caught in the sandslide, he thought.Buried in it.I must be calm and work this out carefully.She wont smother immediately.Shell compose herself in bindu suspension to reduce her oxygen needs.She knows Ill dig for her.In the Bene Gesserit way she had taught him, Paul stilled the savage beating of his heart, set his mind as a blank slate upon which the past few moments could write themselves.Every partial shift and twist of the slide replayed itself in his memory, moving with an interior stateliness that contrasted with the fractional second of real time required for the total recall.Presently, Paul moved slantwise up the slope, probing cautiously until he found the wall of the fissure, an outcurve of rock there.He began to dig, moving the sand with care not to dislodge another slide.A piece of fabric came under his hands.He followed it, found an arm.Gently, he traced the arm, exposed her face.Do you hear me?he whispered.No answer.He dug faster, freed her shoulders.She was limp beneath his hands, but he detected a slow heartbeat.Bindu suspension, he told himself.He cleared the sand away to her waist, draped her arms over his shoulders and pulled downslope, slowly at first, then dragging her as fast as he could, feeling the sand give way above.Faster and faster he pulled her, gasping with the effort, fighting to keep his balance.He was out on the hard packed floor of the fissure then, swinging her to his shoulder and breaking into a staggering run as the entire sandslope came down with a loud hiss that echoed and was magnified within the rock walls.He stopped at the end of the fissure where it looked out on the deserts marching dunes some thirty meters below.Gently, he lowered her to the sand, uttered the word to bring her out of the catalepsis.She awakened slowly, taking deeper and deeper breaths.I knew youd find me, she whispered.He looked back up the fissure.It might have been kinder if I hadnt.Paul!I lost the pack, he said.Its buried under a hundred tons of sand  at least.Everything?The spare water, the stilltent  everything that counts.He touched a pocket.I still have the paracompass.He fumbled at the waist sash.Knife and binoculars.We can get a good look around the place where well die.In that instant, the sun lifted above the horizon somewhere to the left beyond the end of the fissure.Colors blinked in the sand out on the open desert.A chorus of birds held forth their songs from hidden places among the rocks.But Jessica had eyes only for the despair in Pauls face.She edged her voice with scorn, said: Is this the way you were taught?Dont you understand?he asked.Everything we need to survive in this place is under that sand.You found me, she said, and now her voice was soft, reasonable.Paul squatted back on his heels.Presently, he looked up the fissure at the new slope, studying it, marking the looseness of the sand.If we could immobilize a small area of that slope and the upper face of a hole dug into the sand, we might be able to put down a shaft to the pack.Water might do it, but we dont have enough water for  He broke off, then: Foam.Jessica held herself to stillness lest she disturb the hyperfunctioning of his mind.Paul looked out at the open dunes, searching with his nostrils as well as his eyes, finding the direction and then centering his attention on a darkened patch of sand below them.Spice, he said.Its essence  highly alkaline.And I have the paracompass.Its power pack is acid base.Jessica sat up straight against the rock.Paul ignored her, leaped to his feet, and was off down the wind compacted surface that spilled from the end of the fissure to the deserts floor.She watched the way he walked, breaking his stride  step  pause, step step  slide  pause   There was no rhythm to it that might tell a marauding worm something not of the desert moved here.Paul reached the spice patch, shoveled a mound of it into a fold of his robe, returned to the fissure.He spilled the spice onto the sand in front of Jessica, squatted and began dismantling the paracompass, using the point of his knife.The compass face came off.He removed his sash, spread the compass parts on it, lifted out the power pack.The dial mechanism came out next, leaving an empty dished compartment in the instrument.Youll need water,Jessica said.Paul took the catchtube from his neck, sucked up a mouthful, expelled it into the dished compartment.If this fails, thats water wasted, Jessica thought.But it wont matter then, anyway.With his knife, Paul cut open the power pack, spilled its crystals into the water.They foamed slightly, subsided.Jessicas eyes caught motion above them.She looked up to see a line of hawks along the rim of the fissure.They perched there staring down at the open water.Great Mother!she thought.They can sense water even at that distance!Paul had the cover back on the paracompass, leaving off the reset button which gave a small hole into the liquid.Taking the reworked instrument in one hand, a handful of spice in the other, Paul went back up the fissure, studying the lay of the slope.His robe billowed gently without the sash to hold it.He waded part way up the slope, kicking off sand rivulets, spurts of dust.Presently, he stopped, pressed a pinch of the spice into the paracompass, shook the instrument case.Green foam boiled out of the hole where the reset button had been.Paul aimed it at the slope, spread a low dike there, began kicking away the sand beneath it, immobilizing the opened face with more foam.Jessica moved to a position below him, called out: May I help?Come up and dig, he said.Weve about three meters to go.Its going to be a near thing.As he spoke, the foam stopped billowing from the instrument.Quickly, Paul said.No telling how long this foam will hold the sand.Jessica scrambled up beside Paul as he sifted another pinch of spice into the hole, shook the paracompass case.Again, foam boiled from it.As Paul directed the foam barrier, Jessica dug with her hands, hurling the sand down the slope.How deep?she panted.About three meters, he said.And I can only approximate the position.We may have to widen this hole.He moved a step aside, slipping in loose sand.Slant your digging backward.Dont go straight down.Jessica obeyed.Slowly, the hole went down, reaching a level even with the floor of the basin and still no sign of the pack.Could I have miscalculated?Paul asked himself.Im the one that panicked originally and caused this mistake.Has that warped my ability?He looked at the paracompass.Less than two ounces of the acid infusion remained.Jessica straightened in the hole, rubbed a foam stained hand across her cheek.Her eyes met Pauls.The upper face, Paul said.Gently, now.He added another pinch of spice to the container, sent the foam boiling around Jessicas hands as she began cutting a vertical face in the upper slant of the hole.On the second pass, her hands encountered something hard.Slowly, she worked out a length of strap with a plastic buckle.Dont move any more of it, Paul said and his voice was almost a whisper.Were out of foam.Jessica held the strap in one hand, looked up at him.Paul threw the empty paracompass down onto the floor of the basin, said: Give me your other hand.Now listen carefully.Im going to pull you to the side and downhill.Dont let go of that strap.We wont get much more spill from the top.This slope has stabilized itself.All Im going to aim for is to keep your head free of the sand.Once that holes filled, we can dig you out and pull up the pack.I understand, she said.Ready?Ready.She tensed her fingers on the strap.With one surge, Paul had her half out of the hole, holding her head up as the foam barrier gave way and sand spilled down.When it had subsided, Jessica remained buried to the waist, her left arm and shoulder still under the sand, her chin protected on a fold of Pauls robe.Her shoulder ached from the strain put on it.I still have the strap, she said.Slowly, Paul worked his hand into the sand beside her, found the strap.Together, he said.Steady pressure.We mustnt break it.More sand spilled down as they worked the pack up.When the strap cleared the surface, Paul stopped, freed his mother from the sand.Together then they pulled the pack downslope and out of its trap.In a few minutes they stood on the floor of the fissure holding the pack between them.Paul looked at his mother.Foam stained her face, her robe.Sand was caked to her where the foam had dried.She looked as though she had been a target for balls of wet, green sand.You look a mess, he said.Youre not so pretty yourself, she said.They started to laugh, then sobered.That shouldnt have happened, Paul said.I was careless.She shrugged, feeling caked sand fall away from her robe.Ill put up the tent, he said.Better slip off that robe and shake it out.He turned away, taking the pack.Jessica nodded, suddenly too tired to answer.Therere anchor holes in the rock, Paul said.Someones tented here before.Why not?she thought as she brushed at her robe.This was a likely place  deep in rock walls and facing another cliff some four kilometers away  far enough above the desert to avoid worms but close enough for easy access before a crossing.She turned, seeing that Paul had the tent up, its rib domed hemisphere blending with the rock walls of the fissure.Paul stepped past her, lifting his binoculars.He adjusted their internal pressure with a quick twist, focused the oil lenses on the other cliff lifting golden tan in morning light across open sand.Jessica watched as he studied that apocalyptic landscape, his eyes probing into sand rivers and canyons.There are growing things over there, he said.Jessica found the spare binoculars in the pack beside the tent, moved up beside Paul.There, he said, holding the binoculars with one hand and pointing with the other.She looked where he pointed.Saguaro, she said.Scrawny stuff.There may be people nearby, Paul said.That could be the remains of a botanical testing station, she warned.This is pretty far south into the desert, he said.He lowered his binoculars, rubbed beneath his filter baffle, feeling how dry and chapped his lips were, sensing the dusty taste of thirst in his mouth.This has the feeling of a Fremen place, he said.Are we certain the Fremen will be friendly?she asked.Kynes promised their help.But theres desperation in the people of this desert, she thought.I felt some of it myself today.Desperate people might kill us for our water.She closed her eyes and, against this wasteland, conjured in her mind a scene from Caladan.There had been a vacation trip once on Caladan  she and the Duke Leto, before Pauls birth.Theyd flown over the southern jungles, above the weed wild shouting leaves and rice paddies of the deltas.And they had seen the ant lines in the greenery  man gangs carrying their loads on suspensor buoyed shoulder poles.And in the sea reaches thered been the white petals of trimaran dhows.All of it gone.Jessica opened her eyes to the desert stillness, to the mounting warmth of the day.Restless heat devils were beginning to set the air aquiver out on the open sand.The other rock face across from them was like a thing seen through cheap glass.A spill of sand spread its brief curtain across the open end of the fissure.The sand hissed down, loosed by puffs of morning breeze, by the hawks that were beginning to lift away from the clifftop.When the sandfall was gone, she still heard it hissing.It grew louder, a sound that once heard, was never forgotten.Worm, Paul whispered.It came from their right with an uncaring majesty that could not be ignored.A twisting burrow mound of sand cut through the dunes within their field of vision.The mound lifted in front, dusting away like a bow wave in water.Then it was gone, coursing off to the left.The sound diminished, died.Ive seen space frigates that were smaller, Paul whispered.She nodded, continuing to stare across the desert.Where the worm had passed there remained that tantalizing gap.It flowed bitterly endless before them, beckoning beneath its horizontal collapse of skyline.When weve rested, Jessica said, we should continue with your lessons.He suppressed a sudden anger, said: Mother, dont you think we could do without   Today you panicked, she said.You know your mind and bindu nervature perhaps better than I do, but youve much yet to learn about your bodys prana musculature.The body does things of itself sometimes, Paul, and I can teach you about this.You must learn to control every muscle, every fiber of your body.You need review of the hands.Well start with finger muscles, palm tendons, and tip sensitivity.She turned away.Come, into the tent, now.He flexed the fingers of his left hand, watching her crawl through the sphincter valve, knowing that he could not deflect her from this determination  that he must agree.Whatever has been done to me, Ive been a party to it, he thought.Review of the hand!He looked at his hand.How inadequate it appeared when measured against such creatures as that worm.We came from Caladan  a paradise world for our form of life.There existed no need on Caladan to build a physical paradise or a paradise of the mind  we could see the actuality all around us.And the price we paid was the price men have always paid for achieving a paradise in this life  we went soft, we lost our edge.from MuadDib: Conversations by the Princess Irulan    So youre the great Gurney Halleck, the man said.Halleck stood staring across the round cavern office at the smuggler seated behind a metal desk.The man wore Fremen robes and had the half tint blue eyes that told of off planet foods in his diet.The office duplicated a space frigates master control center  communications and view screens along a thirty degree arc of wall, remote arming and firing banks adjoining, and the desk formed as a wall projection  part of the remaining curve.I am Staban Tuek, son of Esmar Tuek, the smuggler said.Then youre the one I owe thanks for the help weve received, Halleck said.Ah h h, gratitude, the smuggler said.Sit down.A ship type bucket seat emerged from the wall beside the screens and Halleck sank onto it with a sigh, feeling his weariness.He could see his own reflection now in a dark surface beside the smuggler and scowled at the lines of fatigue in his lumpy face.The inkvine scar along his jaw writhed with the scowl.Halleck turned from his reflection, stared at Tuek.He saw the family resemblance in the smuggler now  the fathers heavy, overhanging eyebrows and rock planes of cheeks and nose.Your men tell me your father is dead, killed by the Harkonnens, Halleck said.By the Harkonnens or by a traitor among your people, Tuek said.Anger overcame part of Hallecks fatigue.He straightened, said: Can you name the traitor?We are not sure.Thufir Hawat suspected the Lady Jessica.Ah h h, the Bene Gesserit witch  perhaps.But Hawat is now a Harkonnen captive.I heard.Halleck took a deep breath.It appears weve a deal more killing ahead of us.We will do nothing to attract attention to us, Tuek said.Halleck stiffened.But  You and those of your men weve saved are welcome to sanctuary among us, Tuek said.You speak of gratitude.Very well; work off your debt to us.We can always use good men.Well destroy you out of hand, though, if you make the slightest open move against the Harkonnens.But they killed your father, man!Perhaps.And if so, Ill give you my fathers answer to those who act without thinking; A stone is heavy and the sand is weighty; but a fools wrath is heavier than them both.You mean to do nothing about it, then?Halleck sneered.You did not hear me say that.I merely say I will protect our contract with the Guild.The Guild requires that we play a circumspect game.There are other ways of destroying a foe.Ah h h h h.   Ah, indeed.If youve a mind to seek out the witch, have at it.But I warn you that youre probably too late  and we doubt shes the one you want anyway.Hawat made few mistakes.He allowed himself to fall into Harkonnen hands.You think hes the traitor?Tuek shrugged.This is academic.We think the witch is dead.At least the Harkonnens believe it.You seem to know a great deal about the Harkonnens.Hints and suggestions  rumors and hunches.We are seventy four men, Halleck said.If you seriously wish us to enlist with you, you must believe our Duke is dead.His body has been seen.And the boy, too  young Master Paul?Halleck tried to swallow, found a lump in his throat.According to the last word we had, he was lost with his mother in a desert storm.Likely not even their bones will ever be found.So the witch is dead then  all dead.Tuek nodded.And Beast Rabban, so they say, will sit once more in the seat of power here on Dune.The Count Rabban of Lankiveil?Yes.It took Halleck a moment to put down the upsurge of rage that threatened to overcome him.He spoke with panting breath: Ive a score of my own against Rabban.I owe him for the lives of my family  He rubbed at the scar along his jaw.and for this   One does not risk everything to settle a score prematurely, Tuek said.He frowned, watching the play of muscles along Hallecks jaw, the sudden withdrawal in the mans shed lidded eyes.I know  I know.Halleck took a deep breath.You and your men can work out your passage off Arrakis by serving with us.There are many places to  I release my men from any bond to me; they can choose for themselves.With Rabban here  I stay.In your mood, Im not sure we want you to stay.Halleck stared at the smuggler.You doubt my word?No o o   Youve saved me from the Harkonnens.I gave loyalty to the Duke Leto for no greater reason.Ill stay on Arrakis  with you  or with the Fremen.Whether a thought is spoken or not it is a real thing and it has power, Tuek said.You might find the line between life and death among the Fremen to be too sharp and quick.Halleck closed his eyes briefly, feeling the weariness surge up in him.Where is the Lord who led us through the land of deserts and of pits?he murmured.Move slowly and the day of your revenge will come, Tuek said.Speed is a device of Shaitan.Cool your sorrow  weve the diversions for it; three things there are that ease the heart  water, green grass, and the beauty of woman.Halleck opened his eyes.I would prefer the blood of Rabban Harkonnen flowing about my feet.He stared at Tuek.You think that day will come?I have little to do with how youll meet tomorrow, Gurney Halleck.I can only help you meet today.Then Ill accept that help and stay until the day you tell me to revenge your father and all the others who  Listen to me, fighting man, Tuek said.He leaned forward over his desk, his shoulders level with his ears, eyes intent.The smugglers face was suddenly like weathered stone.My fathers water  Ill buy that back myself, with my own blade.Halleck stared back at Tuek.In that moment the smuggler reminded him of Duke Leto: a leader of men, courageous, secure in his own position and his own course.He was like the Duke  before Arrakis.Do you wish my blade beside you?Halleck asked.Tuek sat back, relaxed, studying Halleck silently.Do you think of me as fighting man?Halleck pressed.Youre the only one of the Dukes lieutenants to escape, Tuek said.Your enemy was overwhelming, yet you rolled with him  You defeated him the way we defeat Arrakis.Eh?We live on sufferance down here, Gurney Halleck, Tuek said.Arrakis is our enemy.One enemy at a time, is that it?Thats it.Is that the way the Fremen make out?Perhaps.You said I might find life with the Fremen too tough.They live in the desert, in the open, is that why?Who knows where the Fremen live?For us, the Central Plateau is a no mans land.But I wish to talk more about  Im told that the Guild seldom routes spice lighters in over the desert, Halleck said.But there are rumors that you can see bits of greenery here and there if you know where to look.Rumors!Tuek sneered.Do you wish to choose now between me and the Fremen?We have a measure of security, our own sietch carved out of the rock, our own hidden basins.We live the lives of civilized men.The Fremen are a few ragged bands that we use as spice hunters.But they can kill Harkonnens.And do you wish to know the result?Even now they are being hunted down like animals  with lasguns, because they have no shields.They are being exterminated.Why?Because they killed Harkonnens.Was it Harkonnens they killed?Halleck asked.What do you mean?Havent you heard that there mayve been Sardaukar with the Harkonnens?More rumors.But a pogrom  that isnt like the Harkonnens.A pogrom is wasteful.I believe what I see with my own eyes, Tuek said.Make your choice, fighting man.Me or the Fremen.I will promise you sanctuary and a chance to draw the blood we both want.Be sure of that.The Fremen will offer you only the life of the hunted.Halleck hesitated, sensing wisdom and sympathy in Tueks words, yet troubled for no reason he could explain.Trust your own abilities, Tuek said.Whose decisions brought your force through the battle?Yours.Decide.It must be, Halleck said.The Duke and his son are dead?The Harkonnens believe it.Where such things are concerned, I incline to trust the Harkonnens.A grim smile touched Tueks mouth.But its about the only trust I give them.Then it must be, Halleck repeated.He held out his right hand, palm up and thumb folded flat against it in the traditional gesture.I give you my sword.Accepted.Do you wish me to persuade my men?Youd let them make their own decision?Theyve followed me this far, but most are Caladan born.Arrakis isnt what they thought itd be.Here, theyve lost everything except their lives.Id prefer they decided for themselves now.Now is no time for you to falter, Tuek said.Theyve followed you this far.You need them, is that it?We can always use experienced fighting men  in these times more than ever.Youve accepted my sword.Do you wish me to persuade them?I think theyll follow you, Gurney Halleck.Tis to be hoped.Indeed.I may make my own decision in this, then?Your own decision.Halleck pushed himself up from the bucket seat, feeling how much of his reserve strength even that small effort required.For now, Ill see to their quarters and well being, he said.Consult my quartermaster, Tuek said.Drisq is his name.Tell him its my wish that you receive every courtesy.Ill join you myself presently.Ive some off shipments of spice to see to first.Fortune passes everywhere, Halleck said.Everywhere, Tuek said.A time of upset is a rare opportunity for our business.Halleck nodded, heard the faint susurration and felt the air shift as a lockport swung open beside him.He turned, ducked through it and out of the office.He found himself in the assembly hall through which he and his men had been led by Tueks aides.It was a long, fairly narrow area chewed out of the native rock, its smooth surface betraying the use of cutteray burners for the job.The ceiling stretched away high enough to continue the natural supporting curve of the rock and to permit internal air convection currents.Weapons racks and lockers lined the walls.Halleck noted with a touch of pride that those of his men still able to stand were standing  no relaxation in weariness and defeat for them.Smuggler medics were moving among them tending the wounded.Litter cases were assembled in one area down to the left, each wounded man with an Atreides companion.The Atreides training  We care for our own!it held like a core of native rock in them, Halleck noted.One of his lieutenants stepped forward carrying Hallecks nine string baliset out of its case.The man snapped a salute, said: Sir, the medics here say theres no hope for Mattai.They have no bone and organ banks here  only outpost medicine.Mattai cant last, they say, and he has a request of you.What is it?The lieutenant thrust the baliset forward.Mattai wants a song to ease his going, sir.He says youll know the one  hes asked it of you often enough.The lieutenant swallowed.Its the one called My Woman, sir.If you  I know.Halleck took the baliset, flicked the multipick out of its catch on the fingerboard.He drew a soft chord from the instrument, found that someone had already tuned it.There was a burning in his eyes, but he drove that out of his thoughts as he strolled forward, strumming the tune, forcing himself to smile casually.Several of his men and a smuggler medic were bent over one of the litters.One of the men began singing softly as Halleck approached, catching the counter beat with the ease of long familiarity:   My woman stands at her window,  Curved lines gainst square glass.Upraisd arms  bent  downfolded  Gainst sunset red and golded  Come to me   Come to me, warm arms of my lass.For me   For me, the warm arms of my lass.The singer stopped, reached out a bandaged arm and closed the eyelids of the man on the litter.Halleck drew a final soft chord from the baliset, thinking: Now we are seventy three.Family life of the Royal Creche is difficult for many people to understand, but I shall try to give you a capsule view of it.My father had only one real friend, I think.That was Count Hasimir Fenring, the genetic eunuch and one of the deadliest fighters in the Imperium.The Count, a dapper and ugly little man, brought a new slave concubine to my father one day and I was dispatched by my mother to spy on the proceedings.All of us spied on my father as a matter of self protecdon.One of the slave concubines permitted my father under the Bene Gesserit Guild agreement could not, of course, bear a Royal Successor, but the intrigues were constant and oppressive in their similarity.We became adept, my mother and sisters and I, at avoiding subtle instruments of death.It may seem a dreadful thing to say, but Im not at all sure my father was innocent in all these attempts.A Royal Family is not like other families.Here was a new slave concubine, then, red haired like my father, willowy and graceful.She had a dancers muscles, and her training obviously had included neuro enticement.My father looked at her for a long time as she postured unclothed before him.Finally he said: She is too beautiful.We will save her as a gift.You have no idea how much consternation this restraint created in the Royal Creche.Subtlety and self control were, after all, the most deadly threats to us all.In My Fathers House by the Princess Irulan    Paul stood outside the stilltent in the late afternoon.The crevasse where he had pitched their camp lay in deep shadow.He stared out across the open sand at the distant cliff, wondering if he should waken his mother, who lay asleep in the tent.Folds upon folds of dunes spread beyond their shelter.Away from the setting sun, the dunes exposed greased shadows so black they were like bits of night.And the flatness.His mind searched for something tall in that landscape.But there was no persuading tallness out of heat addled air and that horizon  no bloom or gently shaken thing to mark the passage of a breeze  only dunes and that distant cliff beneath a sky of burnished silver blue.What if there isnt one of the abandoned testing stations across there?he wondered.What if there are no Fremen, either, and the plants we see are only an accident?Within the tent, Jessica awakened, turned onto her back and peered sidelong out the transparent end at Paul.He stood with his back to her and something about his stance reminded her of his father.She sensed the well of grief rising within her and turned away.Presently she adjusted her stillsuit, refreshed herself with water from the tents catchpocket, and slipped out to stand and stretch the sleep from her muscles.Paul spoke without turning: I find myself enjoying the quiet here.How the mind gears itself for its environment, she thought.And she recalled a Bene Gesserit axiom: The mind can go either direction under stress  toward positive or toward negative: on or off.Think of it as a spectrum whose extremes are unconsciousness at the negative end and hyper consciousness at the positive end.The way the mind will lean under stress is strongly influenced by training.It could be a good life here, Paul said.She tried to see the desert through his eyes, seeking to encompass all the rigors this planet accepted as commonplace, wondering at the possible futures Paul had glimpsed.One could be alone out here, she thought, without fear of someone behind you, without fear of the hunter.She stepped past Paul, lifted her binoculars, adjusted the oil lenses and studied the escarpment across from them.Yes, saguaro in the arroyos and other spiny growth  and a matting of low grasses, yellow green in the shadows.Ill strike camp, Paul said.Jessica nodded, walked to the fissures mouth where she could get a sweep of the desert, and swung her binoculars to the left.A salt pan glared white there with a blending of dirty tan at its edges  a field of white out here where white was death.But the pan said another thing: water.At some time water had flowed across that glaring white.She lowered her binoculars, adjusted her burnoose, listened for a moment to the sound of Pauls movements.The sun dipped lower.Shadows stretched across the salt pan.Lines of wild color spread over the sunset horizon.Color streamed into a toe of darkness testing the sand.Coal colored shadows spread, and the thick collapse of night blotted the desert.Stars!She stared up at them, sensing Pauls movements as he came up beside her.The desert night focused upward with a feeling of lift toward the stars.The weight of the day receded.There came a brief flurry of breeze across her face.The first moon will be up soon, Paul said.The packs ready.Ive planted the thumper.We could be lost forever in this hellplace, she thought.And no one to know.The night wind spread sand runnels that grated across her face, bringing the smell of cinnamon: a shower of odors in the dark.Smell that, Paul said.I can smell it even through the filter, she said.Riches.But will it buy water?She pointed across the basin.There are no artificial lights across there.Fremen would be hidden in a sietch behind those rocks, he said.A sill of silver pushed above the horizon to their right: the first moon.It lifted into view, the hand pattern plain on its face.Jessica studied the white silver of sand exposed in the light.I planted the thumper in the deepest part of the crevasse, Paul said.Whenever I light its candle itll give us about thirty minutes.Thirty minutes?Before it starts calling  a  worm.Oh.Im ready to go.He slipped away from her side and she heard his progress back up their fissure.The night is a tunnel, she thought, a hole into tomorrow  if were to have a tomorrow.She shook her head.Why must I be so morbid?I was trained better than that!Paul returned, took up the pack, led the way down to the first spreading dune where he stopped and listened as his mother came up behind him.He heard her soft progress and the cold single grain dribbles of sand  the deserts own code spelling out its measure of safety.We must walk without rhythm, Paul said and he called up memory of men walking the sand  both prescient memory and real memory.Watch how I do it, he said.This is how Fremen walk the sand.He stepped out onto the windward face of the dune, following the curve of it, moved with a dragging pace.Jessica studied his progress for ten steps, followed, imitating him.She saw the sense of it: they must sound like the natural shifting of sand  like the wind.But muscles protested this unnatural, broken pattern: Step  drag  drag  step  step  wait  drag  step   Time stretched out around them.The rock face ahead seemed to grow no nearer.The one behind still towered high.Lump!Lump!Lump!Lump!It was a drumming from the cliff behind.The thumper, Paul hissed.Its pounding continued and they found difficulty avoiding the rhythm of it in their stride.Lump  lump  lump  lump   They moved in a moonlit bowl punctured by that hollow thumping.Down and up through spilling dunes: step  drag  wait  step  Across pea sand that rolled under their feet: drag  wait  step   And all the while their ears searched for a special hissing.The sound, when it came, started so low that their own dragging passage masked it.But it grew  louder and louder  out of the west.Lump  lump  lump  lump  drummed the thumper.The hissing approach spread across the night behind them.They turned their heads as they walked, saw the mound of the coursing worm.Keep moving, Paul whispered.Dont look back.A grating sound of fury exploded from the rock shadows they had left.It was a flailing avalanche of noise.Keep moving, Paul repeated.He saw that they had reached an unmarked point where the two rock faces  the one ahead and the one behind  appeared equally remote.And still behind them, that whipping, frenzied tearing of rocks dominated the night.They moved on and on and on  Muscles reached a stage of mechanical aching that seemed to stretch out indefinitely, but Paul saw that the beckoning escarpment ahead of them had climbed higher.Jessica moved in a void of concentration, aware that the pressure of her will alone kept her walking.Dryness ached in her mouth, but the sounds behind drove away all hope of stopping for a sip from her stillsuits catchpockets.Lump  lump   Renewed frenzy erupted from the distant cliff, drowning out the thumper.Silence!Faster, Paul whispered.She nodded, knowing he did not see the gesture, but needing the action to tell herself that it was necessary to demand even more from muscles that already were being taxed to their limits  the unnatural movement   The rock face of safety ahead of them climbed into the stars, and Paul saw a plane of flat sand stretching out at the base.He stepped onto it, stumbled in his fatigue, righted himself with an involuntary outthrusting of a foot.Resonant booming shook the sand around them.Paul lurched sideways two steps.Boom!Boom!Drum sand!Jessica hissed.Paul recovered his balance.A sweeping glance took in the sand around them, the rock escarpment perhaps two hundred meters away.Behind them, he heard a hissing  like the wind, like a riptide where there was no water.Run!Jessica screamed.Paul, run!They ran.Drum sound boomed beneath their feet.Then they were out of it and into pea gravel.For a time, the running was a relief to muscles that ached from unfamiliar, rhythmless use.Here was action that could be understood.Here was rhythm.But sand and gravel dragged at their feet.And the hissing approach of the worm was storm sound that grew around them.Jessica stumbled to her knees.All she could think of was the fatigue and the sound and the terror.Paul dragged her up.They ran on, hand in hand.A thin pole jutted from the sand ahead of them.They passed it, saw another.Jessicas mind failed to register on the poles until they were past.There was another  wind etched surface thrust up from a crack in rock.Another.Rock!She felt it through her feet, the shock of unresisting surface, gained new strength from the firmer footing.A deep crack stretched its vertical shadow upward into the cliff ahead of them.They sprinted for it, crowded into the narrow hole.Behind them, the sound of the worms passage stopped.Jessica and Paul turned, peered out onto the desert.Where the dunes began, perhaps fifty meters away at the foot of a rock beach, a silver gray curve broached from the desert, sending rivers of sand and dust cascading all around.It lifted higher, resolved into a giant, questing mouth.It was a round, black hole with edges glistening in the moonlight.The mouth snaked toward the narrow crack where Paul and Jessica huddled.Cinnamon yelled in their nostrils.Moonlight flashed from crystal teeth.Back and forth the great mouth wove.Paul stilled his breathing.Jessica crouched staring.It took intense concentration of her Bene Gesserit training to put down the primal terrors, subduing a race memory fear that threatened to fill her mind.Paul felt a kind of elation.In some recent instant, he had crossed a time barrier into more unknown territory.He could sense the darkness ahead, nothing revealed to his inner eye.It was as though some step he had taken had plunged him into a well  or into the trough of a wave where the future was invisible.The landscape had undergone a profound shifting.Instead of frightening him, the sensation of time darkness forced a hyper acceleration of his other senses.He found himself registering every available aspect of the thing that lifted from the sand there seeking him.Its mouth was some eighty meters in diameter  crystal teeth with the curved shape of crysknives glinting around the rim  the bellows breath of cinnamon, subtle aldehydes  acids   The worm blotted out the moonlight as it brushed the rocks above them.A shower of small stones and sand cascaded into the narrow hiding place.Paul crowded his mother farther back.Cinnamon!The smell of it flooded across him.What has the worm to do with the spice, melange?he asked himself.And he remembered Liet Kynes betraying a veiled reference to some association between worm and spice.Barrrroooom!It was like a peal of dry thunder coming from far off to their right.Again: Barrrroooom!The worm drew back onto the sand, lay there momentarily, its crystal teeth weaving moonflashes.Lump!Lump!Lump!Lump!Another thumper!Paul thought.Again it sounded off to their right.A shudder passed through the worm.It drew farther away into the sand.Only a mounded upper curve remained like half a bell mouth, the curve of a tunnel rearing above the dunes.Sand rasped.The creature sank farther, retreating, turning.It became a mound of cresting sand that curved away through a saddle in the dunes.Paul stepped out of the crack, watched the sand wave recede across the waste toward the new thumper summons.Jessica followed, listening: Lump  lump  lump  lump  lump   Presently the sound stopped.Paul found the tube into his stillsuit, sipped at the reclaimed water.Jessica focused on his action, but her mind felt blank with fatigue and the aftermath of terror.Has it gone for sure?she whispered.Somebody called it, Paul said.Fremen.She felt herself recovering.It was so big!Not as big as the one that got our thopter.Are you sure it was Fremen?They used a thumper.Why would they help us?Maybe they werent helping us.Maybe they were just calling a worm.Why?An answer lay poised at the edge of his awareness, but refused to come.He had a vision in his mind of something to do with the telescoping barbed sticks in their packs  the maker hooks.Why would they call a worm?Jessica asked.A breath of fear touched his mind, and he forced himself to turn away from his mother, to look up the cliff.Wed better find a way up there before daylight.He pointed.Those poles we passed  there are more of them.She looked, following the line of his hand, saw the poles  wind scratched markers  made out the shadow of a narrow ledge that twisted into a crevasse high above them.They mark a way up the cliff, Paul said.He settled his shoulders into the pack, crossed to the foot of the ledge and began the climb upward.Jessica waited a moment, resting, restoring her strength; then she followed.Up they climbed, following the guide poles until the ledge dwindled to a narrow lip at the mouth of a dark crevasse.Paul tipped his head to peer into the shadowed place.He could feel the precarious hold his feet had on the slender ledge, but forced himself to slow caution.He saw only darkness within the crevasse.It stretched away upward, open to the stars at the top.His ears searched, found only sounds he could expect  a tiny spill of sand, an insect brrr, the patter of a small running creature.He tested the darkness in the crevasse with one foot, found rock beneath a gritting surface.Slowly, he inched around the corner, signaled for his mother to follow.He grasped a loose edge of her robe, helped her around.They looked upward at starlight framed by two rock lips.Paul saw his mother beside him as a cloudy gray movement.If we could only risk a light, he whispered.We have other senses than eyes, she said.Paul slid a foot forward, shifted his weight, and probed with the other foot, met an obstruction.He lifted his foot, found a step, pulled himself up onto it.He reached back, felt his mothers arm, tugged at her robe for her to follow.Another step.It goes on up to the top, I think, he whispered.Shallow and even steps, Jessica thought.Man carved beyond a doubt.She followed the shadowy movement of Pauls progress, feeling out the steps.Rock walls narrowed until her shoulders almost brushed them.The steps ended in a slitted defile about twenty meters long, its floor level, and this opened onto a shallow, moonlit basin.Paul stepped out into the rim of the basin, whispered: What a beautiful place.Jessica could only stare in silent agreement from her position a step behind him.In spite of weariness, the irritation of recaths and nose plugs and the confinement of the stillsuit, in spite of fear and the aching desire for rest, this basins beauty filled her senses, forcing her to stop and admire it.Like a fairyland, Paul whispered.Jessica nodded.Spreading away in front of her stretched desert growth  bushes, cacti, tiny clumps of leaves  all trembling in the moonlight.The ringwalls were dark to her left, moonfrosted on her right.This must be a Fremen place, Paul said.There would have to be people for this many plants to survive, she agreed.She uncapped the tube to her stillsuits catchpockets, sipped at it.Warm, faintly acrid wetness slipped down her throat.She marked how it refreshed her.The tubes cap grated against flakes of sand as she replaced it.Movement caught Pauls attention  to his right and down on the basin floor curving out beneath them.He stared down through smoke bushes and weeds into a wedged slab sand surface of moonlight inhabited by an up hop, jump, pop hop of tiny motion.Mice!he hissed.Pop hop hop!they went, into shadows and out.Something fell soundlessly past their eyes into the mice.There came a thin screech, a flapping of wings, and a ghostly gray bird lifted away across the basin with a small, dark shadow in its talons.We needed that reminder, Jessica thought.Paul continued to stare across the basin.He inhaled, sensed the softly cutting contralto smell of sage climbing the night.The predatory bird  he thought of it as the way of this desert.It had brought a stillness to the basin so unuttered that the blue milk moonlight could almost be heard flowing across sentinel saguaro and spiked paintbush.There was a low humming of light here more basic in its harmony than any other music in his universe.Wed better find a place to pitch the tent, he said.Tomorrow we can try to find the Fremen who  Most intruders here regret finding the Fremen!It was a heavy masculine voice chopping across his words, shattering the moment.The voice came from above them and to their right.Please do not run, intruders, the voice said as Paul made to withdraw into the defile.If you run youll only waste your bodys water.They want us for the water of our flesh!Jessica thought.Her muscles overrode all fatigue, flowed into maximum readiness without external betrayal.She pinpointed the location of the voice, thinking: Such stealth!I didnt hear him.And she realized that the owner of that voice had permitted himself only the small sounds, the natural sounds of the desert.Another voice called from the basins rim to their left.Make it quick, Stil.Get their water and lets be on our way.Weve little enough time before dawn.Paul, less conditioned to emergency response than his mother, felt chagrin that he had stiffened and tried to withdraw, that he had clouded his abilities by a momentary panic.He forced himself now to obey her teachings: relax, then fall into the semblance of relaxation, then into the arrested whipsnap of muscles that can slash in any direction.Still, he felt the edge of fear within him and knew its source.This was blind time, no future he had seen  and they were caught between wild Fremen whose only interest was the water carried in the flesh of two unshielded bodies.This Fremen religious adaptation, then, is the source of what we now recognize as The Pillars of the Universe, whose Qizara Tafwid are among us all with signs and proofs and prophecy.They bring us the Arrakeen mystical fusion whose profound beauty is typified by the stirring music built on the old forms, but stamped with the new awakening.Who has not heard and been deeply moved by The Old Mans Hymn?I drove my feet through a desert  Whose mirage fluttered like a host.Voracious for glory, greedy for danger,  I roamed the horizons of al Kulab,  Watching time level mountains  In its search and its hunger for me.And I saw the sparrows swiftly approach,  Bolder than the onrushing wolf.They spread in the tree of my youth.I heard the flock in my branches  And was caught on their beaks and claws!from Arrakis Awakening by the Princess Irulan    The man crawled across a dunetop.He was a mote caught in the glare of the noon sun.He was dressed only in torn remnants of a jubba cloak, his skin bare to the heat through the tatters.The hood had been ripped from the cloak, but the man had fashioned a turban from a torn strip of cloth.Wisps of sandy hair protruded from it, matched by a sparse beard and thick brows.Beneath the blue within blue eyes, remains of a dark stain spread down to his cheeks.A matted depression across mustache and beard showed where a stillsuit tube had marked out its path from nose to catchpockets.The man stopped half across the dunecrest, arms stretched down the slipface.Blood had clotted on his back and on his arms and legs.Patches of yellow gray sand clung to the wounds.Slowly, he brought his hands under him, pushed himself to his feet, stood there swaying.And even in this almost random action there remained a trace of once precise movement.I am Liet Kynes, he said, addressing himself to the empty horizon, and his voice was a hoarse caricature of the strength it had known.I am His Imperial Majestys Planetologist, he whispered, planetary ecologist for Arrakis.I am steward of this land.He stumbled, fell sideways along the crusty surface of the windward face.His hands dug feebly into the sand.I am steward of this sand, he thought.He realized that he was semi delirious, that he should dig himself into the sand, find the relatively cool underlayer and cover himself with it.But he could still smell the rank, semisweet esthers of a pre spice pocket somewhere underneath this sand.He knew the peril within this fact more certainly than any other Fremen.If he could smell the pre spice mass, that meant the gases deep under the sand were nearing explosive pressure.He had to get away from here.His hands made weak scrabbling motions along the dune face.A thought spread across his mind  clear, distinct: The real wealth of a planet is in its landscape, how we take part in that basic source of civilization  agriculture.And he thought how strange it was that his mind, long fixed on a single track, could not get off that track.The Harkonnen troopers had left him here without water or stillsuit, thinking a worm would get him if the desert didnt.They had thought it amusing to leave him alive to die by inches at the impersonal hands of his planet.The Harkonnens always did find it difficult to kill Fremen, he thought.We dont die easily.I should be dead now  I will be dead soon  but I cant stop being an ecologist.The highest function of ecology is understanding consequences.The voice shocked him because he recognized it and knew the owner of it was dead.It was the voice of his father who had been planetologist here before him  his father long dead, killed in the cave in at Plaster Basin.Got yourself into quite a fix here, Son, his father said.You shouldve known the consequences of trying to help the child of that Duke.Im delirious, Kynes thought.The voice seemed to come from his right.Kynes scraped his face through sand, turning to look in that direction  nothing except a curving stretch of dune dancing with heat devils in the full glare of the sun.The more life there is within a system, the more niches there are for life, his father said.And the voice came now from his left, from behind him.Why does he keep moving around?Kynes asked himself.Doesnt he want me to see him?Life improves the capacity of the environment to sustain life, his father said.Life makes needed nutrients more readily available.It binds more energy into the system through the tremendous chemical interplay from organism to organism.Why does he keep harping on the same subject?Kynes asked himself.I knew that before I was ten.Desert hawks, carrion eaters in this land as were most wild creatures, began to circle over him.Kynes saw a shadow pass near his hand, forced his head farther around to look upward.The birds were a blurred patch on silver blue sky  distant flecks of soot floating above him.We are generalists, his father said.You cant draw neat lines around planet wide problems.Planetology is a cut and fit science.Whats he trying to tell me?Kynes wondered.Is there some consequence I failed to see?His cheek slumped back against the hot sand, and he smelled the burned rock odor beneath the pre spice gases.From some corner of logic in his mind, a thought formed: Those are carrion eater birds over me.Perhaps some of my Fremen will see them and come to investigate.To the working planetologist, his most important tool is human beings, his father said.You must cultivate ecological literacy among the people.Thats why Ive created this entirely new form of ecological notation.Hes repeating things he said to me when I was a child, Kynes thought.He began to feel cool, but that corner of logic in his mind told him: The sun is overhead.You have no stillsuit and youre hot; the sun is burning the moisture out of your body.His fingers clawed feebly at the sand.They couldnt even leave me a stillsuit!The presence of moisture in the air helps prevent too rapid evaporation from living bodies, his father said.Why does he keep repeating the obvious?Kynes wondered.He tried to think of moisture in the air  grass covering this dune  open water somewhere beneath him, a long qanat flowing with water across the desert, and trees lining it  He had never seen water open to the sky except in text illustrations.Open water  irrigation water  it took five thousand cubic meters of water to irrigate one hectare of land per growing season, he remembered.Our first goal on Arrakis, his father said, is grassland provinces.We will start with these mutated poverty grasses.When we have moisture locked in grasslands, well move on to start upland forests, then a few open bodies of water  small at first  and situated along lines of prevailing winds with windtrap moisture precipitators spaced in the lines to recapture what the wind steals.We must create a true sirocco  a moist wind  but we will never get away from the necessity for windtraps.Always lecturing me, Kynes thought.Why doesnt he shut up?Cant he see Im dying?You will die, too, his father said, if you dont get off the bubble thats forming right now deep underneath you.Its there and you know it.You can smell the pre spice gases.You know the little makers are beginning to lose some of their water into the mass.The thought of that water beneath him was maddening.He imagined it now  sealed off in strata of porous rock by the leathery half plant, half animal little makers  and the thin rupture that was pouring a cool stream of clearest, pure, liquid, soothing water into   A pre spice mass!He inhaled, smelling the rank sweetness.The odor was much richer around him than it had been.Kynes pushed himself to his knees, heard a bird screech, the hurried flapping of wings.This is spice desert, he thought.There must be Fremen about even in the day sun.Surely they can see the birds and will investigate.Movement across the landscape is a necessity for animal life, his father said.Nomad peoples follow the same necessity.Lines of movement adjust to physical needs for water, food, minerals.We must control this movement now, align it for our purposes.Shut up, old man, Kynes muttered.We must do a thing on Arrakis never before attempted for an entire planet, his father said.We must use man as a constructive ecological force  inserting adapted terraform life: a plant here, an animal there, a man in that place  to transform the water cycle, to build a new kind of landscape.Shut up!Kynes croaked.It was lines of movement that gave us the first clue to the relationship between worms and spice, his father said.A worm, Kynes thought with a surge of hope.A makers sure to come when this bubble bursts.But I have no hooks.How can I mount a big maker without hooks?He could feel frustration sapping what little strength remained to him.Water so near  only a hundred meters or so beneath him; a worm sure to come, but no way to trap it on the surface and use it.Kynes pitched forward onto the sand, returning to the shallow depression his movements had defined.He felt sand hot against his left cheek, but the sensation was remote.The Arrakeen environment built itself into the evolutionary pattern of native life forms, his father said.How strange that so few people ever looked up from the spice long enough to wonder at the near ideal nitrogen oxygen CO2 balance being maintained here in the absence of large areas of plant cover.The energy sphere of the planet is there to see and understand  a relentless process, but a process nonetheless.There is a gap in it?Then something occupies that gap.Science is made up of so many things that appear obvious after they are explained.I knew the little maker was there, deep in the sand, long before I ever saw it.Please stop lecturing me, Father, Kynes whispered.A hawk landed on the sand near his outstretched hand.Kynes saw it fold its wings, tip its head to stare at him.He summoned the energy to croak at it.The bird hopped away two steps, but continued to stare at him.Men and their works have been a disease on the surface of their planets before now, his father said.Nature tends to compensate for diseases, to remove or encapsulate them, to incorporate them into the system in her own way.The hawk lowered its head, stretched its wings, refolded them.It transferred its attention to his outstretched hand.Kynes found that he no longer had the strength to croak at it.The historical system of mutual pillage and extortions stops here on Arrakis, his father said.You cannot go on forever stealing what you need without regard to those who come after.The physical qualities of a planet are written into its economic and political record.We have the record in front of us and our course is obvious.He never could stop lecturing, Kynes thought.Lecturing, lecturing, lecturing  always lecturing.The hawk hopped one step closer to Kynes outstretched hand, turned its head first one way and then the other to study the exposed flesh.Arrakis is a one crop planet, his father said.One crop.It supports a ruling class that lives as ruling classes have lived in all times while, beneath them, a semihuman mass of semislaves exists on the leavings.Its the masses and the leavings that occupy our attention.These are far more valuable than has ever been suspected.Im ignoring you, Father, Kynes whispered.Go away.And he thought: Surely there must be some of my Fremen near.They cannot help but see the birds over me.They will investigate if only to see if theres moisture available.The masses of Arrakis will know that we work to make the land flow with water, his father said.Most of them, of course, will have only a semimystical understanding of how we intend to do this.Many, not understanding the prohibitive mass ratio problem, may even think well bring water from some other planet rich in it.Let them think anything they wish as long as they believe in us.In a minute Ill get up and tell him what I think of him, Kynes thought.Standing there lecturing me when he should be helping me.The bird took another hop closer to Kynes outstretched hand.Two more hawks drifted down to the sand behind it.Religion and law among our masses must be one and the same, his father said.An act of disobedience must be a sin and require religious penalties.This will have the dual benefit of bringing both greater obedience and greater bravery.We must depend not so much on the bravery of individuals, you see, as upon the bravery of a whole population.Where is my population now when I need it most?Kynes thought.He summoned all his strength, moved his hand a fingers width toward the nearest hawk.It hopped backward among its companions and all stood poised for flight.Our timetable will achieve the stature of a natural phenomenon, his father said.A planets life is a vast, tightly interwoven fabric.Vegetation and animal changes will be determined at first by the raw physical forces we manipulate.As they establish themselves, though, our changes will become controlling influences in their own right  and we will have to deal with them, too.Keep in mind, though, that we need control only three per cent of the energy surface  only three per cent  to tip the entire structure over into our self sustaining system.Why arent you helping me?Kynes wondered.Always the same: when I need you most, you fail me.He wanted to turn his head, to stare in the direction of his fathers voice, stare the old man down.Muscles refused to answer his demand.Kynes saw the hawk move.It approached his hand, a cautious step at a time while its companions waited in mock indifference.The hawk stopped only a hop away from his hand.A profound clarity filled Kynes mind.He saw quite suddenly a potential for Arrakis that his father had never seen.The possibilities along that different path flooded through him.No more terrible disaster could befall your people than for them to fall into the hands of a Hero, his father said.Reading my mind!Kynes thought.Well  let him.The messages already have been sent to my sietch villages, he thought.Nothing can stop them.If the Dukes son is alive theyll find him and protect him as I have commanded.They may discard the woman, his mother, but theyll save the boy.The hawk took one hop that brought it within slashing distance of his hand.It tipped its head to examine the supine flesh.Abruptly, it straightened, stretched its head upward and with a single screech, leaped into the air and banked away overhead with its companions behind it.Theyve come!Kynes thought.My Fremen have found me!Then he heard the sand rumbling.Every Fremen knew the sound, could distinguish it immediately from the noises of worms or other desert life.Somewhere beneath him, the pre spice mass had accumulated enough water and organic matter from the little makers, had reached the critical stage of wild growth.A gigantic bubble of carbon dioxide was forming deep in the sand, heaving upward in an enormous blow with a dust whirlpool at its center.It would exchange what had been formed deep in the sand for whatever lay on the surface.The hawks circled overhead screeching their frustration.They knew what was happening.Any desert creature would know.And I am a desert creature, Kynes thought.You see me, Father?I am a desert creature.He felt the bubble lift him, felt it break and the dust whirlpool engulf him, dragging him down into cool darkness.For a moment, the sensation of coolness and the moisture were blessed relief.Then, as his planet killed him, it occurred to Kynes that his father and all the other scientists were wrong, that the most persistent principles of the universe were accident and error.Even the hawks could appreciate these facts.Prophecy and prescience  How can they be put to the test in the face of the unanswered questions?Consider: How much is actual prediction of the wave form (as MuadDib referred to his vision image) and how much is the prophet shaping the future to fit the prophecy?What of the harmonics inherent in the act of prophecy?Does the prophet see the future or does he see a line of weakness, a fault or cleavage that he may shatter with words or decisions as a diamond cutter shatters his gem with a blow of a knife?Private Reflections on MuadDib by the Princess Irulan    Get their water, the man calling out of the night had said.And Paul fought down his fear, glanced at his mother.His trained eyes saw her readiness for battle, the waiting whipsnap of her muscles.It would be regrettable should we have to destroy you out of hand, the voice above them said.Thats the one who spoke to us first, Jessica thought.There are at least two of them  one to our right and one on our left.Cignoro hrobosa sukares hin mange la pchagavas doi me kamavas na beslas lele pal hrobas!It was the man to their right calling out across the basin.To Paul, the words were gibberish, but out of her Bene Gesserit training, Jessica recognized the speech.It was Chakobsa, one of the ancient hunting languages, and the man above them was saying that perhaps these were the strangers they sought.In the sudden silence that followed the calling voice, the hoop wheel face of the second moon  faintly ivory blue  rolled over the rocks across the basin, bright and peering.Scrambling sounds came from the rocks  above and to both sides  dark motions in the moonlight.Many figures flowed through the shadows.A whole troop!Paul thought with a sudden pang.A tall man in a mottled burnoose stepped in front of Jessica.His mouth baffle was thrown aside for clear speech, revealing a heavy beard in the sidelight of the moon, but face and eyes were hidden in the overhang of his hood.What have we here  jinn or human?he asked.And Jessica heard the true banter in his voice, she allowed herself a faint hope.This was the voice of command, the voice that had first shocked them with its intrusion from the night.Human, I warrant, the man said.Jessica sensed rather than saw the knife hidden in the fold of the mans robe.She permitted herself one bitter regret that she and Paul had no shields.Do you also speak?the man asked.Jessica put all the royal arrogance at her command into her manner and voice.Reply was urgent, but she had not heard enough of this man to be certain she had a register on his culture and weaknesses.Who comes on us like criminals out of the night?she demanded.The burnoose hooded head showed tension in a sudden twist, then slow relaxation that revealed much.The man had good control.Paul shifted away from his mother to separate them as targets and give each of them a clearer arena of action.The hooded head turned at Pauls movement, opening a wedge of face to moonlight.Jessica saw a sharp nose, one glinting eye  dark, so dark the eye, without any white in it  a heavy brow and upturned mustache.A likely cub, the man said.If youre fugitives from the Harkonnens, it may be youre welcome among us.What is it, boy?The possibilities flashed through Pauls mind: A trick?A fact?Immediate decision was needed.Why should you welcome fugitives?he demanded.A child who thinks and speaks like a man, the tall man said.Well, now to answer your question, my young wali, I am one who does not pay the fai, the water tribute, to the Harkonnens.That is why I might welcome a fugitive.He knows who we are, Paul thought.Theres concealment in his voice.I am Stilgar, the Fremen, the tall man said.Does that speed your tongue, boy?It is the same voice, Paul thought.And he remembered the Council with this man seeking the body of a friend slain by the Harkonnens.I know you, Stilgar, Paul said.I was with my father in Council when you came for the water of your friend.You took away with you my fathers man, Duncan Idaho  an exchange of friends.And Idaho abandoned us to return to his Duke, Stilgar said.Jessica heard the shading of disgust in his voice, held herself prepared for attack.The voice from the rocks above them called: We waste time here, Stil.This is the Dukes son, Stilgar barked.Hes certainly the one Liet told us to seek.But  a child, Stil.The Duke was a man and this lad used a thumper, Stilgar said.That was a brave crossing he made in the path of shaihulud.And Jessica heard him excluding her from his thoughts.Had he already passed sentence?We havent time for the test, the voice above them protested.Yet he could be the Lisan al Gaib, Stilgar said.Hes looking for an omen!Jessica thought.But the woman, the voice above them said.Jessica readied herself anew.There had been death in that voice.Yes, the woman, Stilgar said.And her water.You know the law, said the voice from the rocks.One who cannot live with the desert  Be quiet, Stilgar said.Times change.Did Liet command this?asked the voice from the rocks.You heard the voice of the cielago, Jamis, Stilgar said.Why do you press me?And Jessica thought: Cielago!The clue of the tongue opened wide avenues of understanding: this was the language of Ilm and Fiqh, and cielago meant bat, a small flying mammal.Voice of the cielago: they had received a distrans message to seek Paul and herself.I but remind you of your duties, friend Stilgar, said the voice above them.My duty is the strength of the tribe, Stilgar said.That is my only duty.I need no one to remind me of it.This child man interests me.He is full fleshed.He has lived on much water.He has lived away from the father sun.He has not the eyes of the Ibad.Yet he does not speak or act like a weakling of the pans.Nor did his father.How can this be?We cannot stay out here all night arguing, said the voice from the rocks.If a patrol  I will not tell you again, Jamis, to be quiet, Stilgar said.The man above them remained silent, but Jessica heard him moving, crossing by a leap over a defile and working his way down to the basin floor on their left.The voice of the cielago suggested thered be value to us in saving you two, Stilgar said.I can see possibility in this strong boy man: he is young and can learn.But what of yourself, woman?He stared at Jessica.I have his voice and pattern registered now, Jessica thought.I could control him with a word, but hes a strong man  worth much more to us unblunted and with full freedom of action.We shall see.I am the mother of this boy, Jessica said.In part, his strength which you admire is the product of my training.The strength of a woman can be boundless, Stilgar said.Certain it is in a Reverend Mother.Are you a Reverend Mother?For the moment, Jessica put aside the implications of the question, answered truthfully, No.Are you trained in the ways of the desert?No, but many consider my training valuable.We make our own judgments on value, Stilgar said.Every man has the right to his own judgments, she said.It is well that you see the reason, Stilgar said.We cannot dally here to test you, woman.Do you understand?Wed not want your shade to plague us.I will take the boy man, your son, and he shall have my countenance, sanctuary in my tribe.But for you, woman  you understand there is nothing personal in this?It is the rule, Istislah, in the general interest.Is that not enough?Paul took a half step forward.What are you talking about?Stilgar flicked a glance across Paul, but kept his attention on Jessica.Unless youve been deep trained from childhood to live here, you could bring destruction onto an entire tribe.It is the law, and we cannot carry useless   Jessicas motion started as a slumping, deceptive faint to the ground.It was the obvious thing for a weak outworlder to do, and the obvious slows an opponents reactions.It takes an instant to interpret a known thing when that thing is exposed as something unknown.She shifted as she saw his right shoulder drop to bring a weapon within the folds of his robe to bear on her new position.A turn, a slash of her arm, a whirling of mingled robes, and she was against the rocks with the man helpless in front of her.At his mothers first movement, Paul backed two steps.As she attacked, he dove for shadows.A bearded man rose up in his path, half crouched, lunging forward with a weapon in one hand.Paul took the man beneath the sternum with a straight hand jab, sidestepped and chopped the base of his neck, relieving him of the weapon as he fell.Then Paul was into the shadows, scrambling upward among the rocks, the weapon tucked into his waist sash.He had recognized it in spite of its unfamiliar shape  a projectile weapon, and that said many things about this place, another clue that shields were not used here.They will concentrate on my mother and that Stilgar fellow.She can handle him.I must get to a safe vantage point where I can threaten them and give her time to escape.There came a chorus of sharp spring clicks from the basin.Projectiles whined off the rocks around him.One of them flicked his robe.He squeezed around a corner in the rocks, found himself in a narrow vertical crack, began inching upward  his back against one side, his feet against the other  slowly, as silently as he could.The roar of Stilgars voice echoed up to him: Get back, you worm headed lice!Shell break my neck if you come near!A voice out of the basin said: The boy got away, Stil.What are we  Of course he got away, you sand brained  Ugh h h!Easy, woman!Tell them to stop hunting my son,Jessica said.Theyve stopped, woman.He got away as you intended him to.Great gods below!Why didnt you say you were a weirding woman and a fighter?Tell your men to fall back,Jessica said.Tell them to go out into the basin where I can see them  and youd better believe that I know how many of them there are.And she thought: This is the delicate moment, but if this man is as sharp minded as I think him, we have a chance.Paul inched his way upward, found a narrow ledge on which he could rest and look down into the basin.Stilgars voice came up to him.And if I refuse?How can you  ugh h h!Leave be, woman!We mean no harm to you, now.Great gods!If you can do this to the strongest of us, youre worth ten times your weight of water.Now, the test of reason, Jessica thought.She said: You ask after the Lisan al Gaib.You could be the folk of the legend, he said, but Ill believe that when its been tested.All I know now is that you came here with that stupid Duke who  Aiee e e!Woman!I care not if you kill me!He was honorable and brave, but it was stupid to put himself in the way of the Harkonnen fist!Silence.Presently, Jessica said: He had no choice, but well not argue it.Now, tell that man of yours behind the bush over there to stop trying to bring his weapon to bear on me, or Ill rid the universe of you and take him next.You there!Stilgar roared.Do as she says!But, Stil  Do as she says, you wormfaced, crawling, sand brained piece of lizard turd!Do it or Ill help her dismember you!Cant you see the worth of this woman?The man at the bush straightened from his partial concealment, lowered his weapon.He has obeyed, Stilgar said.Now, Jessica said, explain clearly to your people what it is you wish of me.I want no young hothead to make a foolish mistake.When we slip into the villages and towns we must mask our origin, blend with the pan and graben folk, Stilgar said.We carry no weapons, for the crysknife is sacred.But you, woman, you have the weirding ability of battle.Wed only heard of it and many doubted, but one cannot doubt what he sees with his own eyes.You mastered an armed Fremen.This is a weapon no search could expose.There was a stirring in the basin as Stilgars words sank home.And if I agree to teach you the  weirding way?My countenance for you as well as your son.How can we be sure of the truth in your promise?Stilgars voice lost some of its subtle undertone of reasoning, took on an edge of bitterness.Out here, woman, we carry no paper for contracts.We make no evening promises to be broken at dawn.When a man says a thing, thats the contract.As leader of my people, Ive put them in bond to my word.Teach us this weirding way and you have sanctuary with us as long as you wish.Your water shall mingle with our water.Can you speak for all Fremen?Jessica asked.In time, that may be.But only my brother, Liet, speaks for all Fremen.Here, I promise only secrecy.My people will not speak of you to any other sietch.The Harkonnens have returned to Dune in force and your Duke is dead.It is said that you two died in a Mother storm.The hunter does not seek dead game.Theres safety in that, Jessica thought.But these people have good communications and a message could be sent.I presume there was a reward offered for us, she said.Stilgar remained silent, and she could almost see the thoughts turning over in his head, sensing the shifts of his muscles beneath her hands.Presently, he said: I will say it once more: Ive given the tribes word bond.My people know your worth to us now.What could the Harkonnens give us?Our freedom?Hah!No, you are the taqwa, that which buys us more than all the spice in the Harkonnen coffers.Then I shall teach you my way of battle,Jessica said, and she sensed the unconscious ritual intensity of her own words.Now, you will release me?So be it,Jessica said.She released her hold on him, stepped aside in full view of the band in the basin.This is the test mashad, she thought.But Paul must know about them even if I die for his knowledge.In the waiting silence, Paul inched forward to get a better view of where his mother stood.As he moved, he heard heavy breathing, suddenly stilled, above him in the vertical crack of the rock, and sensed a faint shadow there outlined against the stars.Stilgars voice came up from the basin: You, up there!Stop hunting the boy.Hell come down presently.The voice of a young boy or girl sounded from the darkness above Paul: But, Stil, he cant be far from  I said leave him be, Chani!You spawn of a lizard!There came a whispered imprecation from above Paul and a low voice: Call me spawn of a lizard!But the shadow pulled back out of view.Paul returned his attention to the basin, picking out the gray shadowed movement of Stilgar beside his mother.Come in, all of you, Stilgar called.He turned to Jessica.And now Ill ask you how we may be certain youll fulfill your half of our bargain?Youre the ones lived with papers and empty contracts and such as  We of the Bene Gesserit dont break our vows any more than you do,Jessica said.There was a protracted silence, then a multiple hissing of voices: A Bene Gesserit witch!Paul brought his captured weapon from his sash, trained it on the dark figure of Stilgar, but the man and his companions remained immobile, staring at Jessica.It is the legend, someone said.It was said that the Shadout Mapes gave this report on you, Stilgar said.But a thing so important must be tested.If you are the Bene Gesserit of the legend whose son will lead us to paradise  He shrugged.Jessica sighed, thinking: So our Missionaria Protectiva even planted religious safety valves all through this hell hole.Ah, well  itll help, and thats what it was meant to do.She said: The seeress who brought you the legend, she gave it under the binding of karama and ijaz, the miracle and the inimitability of the prophecy  this I know.Do you wish to see a sign?His nostrils flared in the moonlight.We cannot tarry for the rites, he whispered.Jessica recalled a chart Kynes had shown her while arranging emergency escape routes.How long ago it seemed.There had been a place called Sietch Tabr on the chart and beside it the notation: Stilgar.Perhaps when we get to Sietch Tabr, she said.The revelation shook him, and Jessica thought: If only he knew the tricks we use!She mustve been good, that Bene Gesserit of the Missionaria Protectiva.These Fremen are beautifully prepared to believe in us.Stilgar shifted uneasily.We must go now.She nodded, letting him know that they left with her permission.He looked up at the cliff almost directly at the rock ledge where Paul crouched.You there, lad: you may come down now.He returned his attention to Jessica, spoke with an apologetic tone: Your son made an incredible amount of noise climbing.He has much to learn lest he endanger us all, but hes young.No doubt we have much to teach each other, Jessica said.Meanwhile, youd best see to your companion out there.My noisy son was a bit rough in disarming him.Stilgar whirled, his hood flapping.Where?Beyond those bushes.She pointed.Stilgar touched two of his men.See to it.He glanced at his companions, identifying them.Jamis is missing.He turned to Jessica.Even your cub knows the weirding way.And youll notice that my son hasnt stirred from up there as you ordered,Jessica said.The two men Stilgar had sent returned supporting a third who stumbled and gasped between them.Stilgar gave them a flicking glance, returned his attention to Jessica.The son will take only your orders, eh?Good.He knows discipline.Paul, you may come down now,Jessica said.Paul stood up, emerging into moonlight above his concealing cleft, slipped the Fremen weapon back into his sash.As he turned, another figure arose from the rocks to face him.In the moonlight and reflection off gray stone, Paul saw a small figure in Fremen robes, a shadowed face peering out at him from the hood, and the muzzle of one of the projectile weapons aimed at him from a fold of robe.I am Chani, daughter of Liet.The voice was lilting, half filled with laughter.I would not have permitted you to harm my companions, she said.Paul swallowed.The figure in front of him turned into the moons path and he saw an elfin face, black pits of eyes.The familiarity of that face, the features out of numberless visions in his earliest prescience, shocked Paul to stillness.He remembered the angry bravado with which he had once described this face from a dream, telling the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam: I will meet her.And here was the face, but in no meeting he had ever dreamed.You were as noisy as shai hulud in a rage, she said.And you took the most difficult way up here.Follow me; Ill show you an easier way down.He scrambled out of the cleft, followed the swirling of her robe across a tumbled landscape.She moved like a gazelle, dancing over the rocks.Paul felt hot blood in his face, was thankful for the darkness.That girl!She was like a touch of destiny.He felt caught up on a wave, in tune with a motion that lifted all his spirits.They stood presently amid the Fremen on the basin floor.Jessica turned a wry smile on Paul, but spoke to Stilgar: This will be a good exchange of teachings.I hope you and your people feel no anger at our violence.It seemed  necessary.You were about to  make a mistake.To save one from a mistake is a gift of paradise, Stilgar said.He touched his lips with his left hand, lifted the weapon from Pauls waist with the other, tossed it to a companion.You will have your own maula pistol, lad, when youve earned it.Paul started to speak, hesitated, remembering his mothers teaching: Beginnings are such delicate times.My son has what weapons he needs,Jessica said.She stared at Stilgar, forcing him to think of how Paul had acquired the pistol.Stilgar glanced at the man Paul had subdued  Jamis.The man stood at one side, head lowered, breathing heavily.You are a difficult woman, Stilgar said.He held out his left hand to a companion, snapped his fingers.Kushti bakka te.More Chakobsa, Jessica thought.The companion pressed two squares of gauze into Stilgars hand.Stilgar ran them through his fingers, fixed one around Jessicas neck beneath her hood, fitted the other around Pauls neck in the same way.Now you wear the kerchief of the bakka, he said.If we become separated, you will be recognized as belonging to Stilgars sietch.We will talk of weapons another time.He moved out through his band now, inspecting them, giving Pauls Fremkit pack to one of his men to carry.Bakka, Jessica thought, recognizing the religious term: bakka  the weeper.She sensed how the symbolism of the kerchiefs united this band.Why should weeping unite them?she asked herself.Stilgar came to the young girl who had embarrassed Paul, said: Chani, take the child man under your wing.Keep him out of trouble.Chani touched Pauls arm.Come along, child man.Paul hid the anger in his voice, said: My name is Paul.It were well you  Well give you a name, manling, Stilgar said, in the time of the mihna, at the test of aql.The test of reason, Jessica translated.The sudden need of Pauls ascendancy overrode all other consideration, and she barked, My sons been tested with the gom jabbar!In the stillness that followed, she knew she had struck to the heart of them.Theres much we dont know of each other, Stilgar said.But we tarry overlong.Day sun mustnt find us in the open.He crossed to the man Paul had struck down, said, Jamis, can you travel?
