   I see in Lunaya Pravda that Luna City Council has passed on first reading a bill to examine, license, inspect  and tax  public food vendors operating inside municipal pressure.I see also is to be mass meeting tonight to organize "Sons of Revolution" talk talk.My old man taught me two things: "Mind own business" and "Always cut cards. "Politics never tempted me.But on Monday 13 May 2075 I was in computer room of Lunar Authority Complex, visiting with computer boss Mike while other machines whispered among themselves.Mike was not official name; I had nicknamed him for Mycroft Holmes, in a story written by Dr.Watson before he founded IBM.This story character would just sit and think  and that's what Mike did.Mike was a fair dinkum thinkum, sharpest computer you'll ever meet.Not fastest.At Bell Labs, Bueno Aires, down Earthside, they've got a thinkum a tenth his size which can answer almost before you ask.But matters whether you get answer in microsecond rather than millisecond as long as correct?Not that Mike would necessarily give right answer; he wasn't completely honest.When Mike was installed in Luna, he was pure thinkum, a flexible logic  "High Optional, Logical, Multi Evaluating Supervisor, Mark IV, Mod.L"  a HOLMES FOUR.He computed ballistics for pilotless freighters and controlled their catapult.This kept him busy less than one percent of time and Luna Authority never believed in idle hands.They kept hooking hardware into him  decision action boxes to let him boss other computers, bank on bank of additional memories, more banks of associational neural nets, another tubful of twelve digit random numbers, a greatly augmented temporary memory.Human brain has around ten to the tenth neurons.By third year Mike had better than one and a half times that number of neuristors.And woke up.Am not going to argue whether a machine can "really" be alive, "really" be self aware.Is a virus self aware?Nyet.How about oyster?I doubt it.A cat?Almost certainly.A human?Don't know about you, tovarishch, but I am.Somewhere along evolutionary chain from macromolecule to human brain self awareness crept in.Psychologists assert it happens automatically whenever a brain acquires certain very high number of associational paths.Can't see it matters whether paths are protein or platinum.("Soul?"Does a dog have a soul?How about cockroach?)Remember Mike was designed, even before augmented, to answer questions tentatively on insufficient data like you do; that's "high optional" and "multi evaluating" part of name.So Mike started with "free will" and acquired more as he was added to and as he learned  and don't ask me to define "free will. "If comforts you to think of Mike as simply tossing random numbers in air and switching circuits to match, please do.By then Mike had voder vocoder circuits supplementing his read outs, print outs, and decision action boxes, and could understand not only classic programming but also Loglan and English, and could accept other languages and was doing technical translating  and reading endlessly.But in giving him instructions was safer to use Loglan.If you spoke English, results might be whimsical; multi valued nature of English gave option circuits too much leeway.And Mike took on endless new jobs.In May 2075, besides controlling robot traffic and catapult and giving ballistic advice and/or control for manned ships, Mike controlled phone system for all Luna, same for Luna Terra voice & video, handled air, water, temperature, humidity, and sewage for Luna City, Novy Leningrad, and several smaller warrens (not Hong Kong in Luna), did accounting and payrolls for Luna Authority, and, by lease, same for many firms and banks.Some logics get nervous breakdowns.Overloaded phone system behaves like frightened child.Mike did not have upsets, acquired sense of humor instead.Low one.If he were a man, you wouldn't dare stoop over.His idea of thigh slapper would be to dump you out of bed  or put itch powder in pressure suit.Not being equipped for that, Mike indulged in phony answers with skewed logic, or pranks like issuing pay cheque to a janitor in Authority's Luna City office for AS$10,000,000,000,000,185.15  last five digits being correct amount.Just a great big overgrown lovable kid who ought to be kicked.He did that first week in May and I had to troubleshoot.I was a private contractor, not on Authority's payroll.You see   or perhaps not; times have changed.Back in bad old days many a con served his time, then went on working for Authority in same job, happy to draw wages.But I was born free.Makes difference.My one grandfather was shipped up from Joburg for armed violence and no work permit, other got transported for subversive activity after Wet Firecracker War.Maternal grandmother claimed she came up in bride ship  but I've seen records; she was Peace Corps enrollee (involuntary), which means what you think: juvenile delinquency female type.As she was in early clan marriage (Stone Gang) and shared six husbands with another woman, identity of maternal grandfather open to question.But was often so and I'm content with grandpappy she picked.Other grandmother was Tatar, born near Samarkand, sentenced to "re education" on Oktyabrakaya Revolyutsiya, then "volunteered" to colonize in Luna.My old man claimed we had even longer distinguished line  ancestress hanged in Salem for witchcraft, a g'g'g'greatgrandfather broken on wheel for piracy, another ancestress in first shipload to Botany Bay.Proud of my ancestry and while I did business with Warden, would never go on his payroll.Perhaps distinction seems trivial since I was Mike's valet from day he was unpacked.But mattered to me.I could down tools and tell them go to hell.Besides, private contractor paid more than civil service rating with Authority.Computermen scarce.How many Loonies could go Earthside and stay out of hospital long enough for computer school?even if didn't die.I'll name one.Me.Had been down twice, once three months, once four, and got schooling.But meant harsh training, exercising in centrifuge, wearing weights even in bed  then I took no chances on Terra, never hurried, never climbed stairs, nothing that could strain heart.Women  didn't even think about women; in that gravitational field it was no effort not to.But most Loonies never tried to leave The Rock  too risky for any bloke who'd been in Luna more than weeks.Computermen sent up to install Mike were on short term bonus contracts  get job done fast before irreversible physiologlcal change marooned them four hundred thousand kilometers from home.But despite two training tours I was not gung ho computerman; higher maths are beyond me.Not really electronics engineer, nor physicist.May not have been best micromachinist in Luna and certainly wasn't cybernetics psychologist.But I knew more about all these than a specialist knows  I'm general specialist.Could relieve a cook and keep orders coming or field repair your suit and get you back to airlock still breathing.Machines like me and I have something specialists don't have: my left arm.You see, from elbow down I don't have one.So I have a dozen left arms, each specialized, plus one that feels and looks like flesh.With proper left arm (number three) and stereo loupe spectacles I could make untramicrominiature repairs that would save unhooking something and sending it Earthside to factory  for number three has micromanipulators as fine as those used by neurosurgeons.So they sent for me to find out why Mike wanted to give away ten million billion Authority Scrip dollars, and fix it before Mike overpaid somebody a mere ten thousand.I took it, time plus bonus, but did not go to circuitry where fault logically should be.Once inside and door locked I put down tools and sat down."Hi, Mike. "He winked lights at me."Hello, Man. ""What do you know?"He hesitated.I know  machines don't hesitate.But remember, Mike was designed to operate on incomplete data.Lately he had reprogrammed himself to put emphasis on words; his hesitations were dramatic.Maybe he spent pauses stirring random numbers to see how they matched his memories."'In the beginning,'" Mike intoned, "God created the heaven and the earth.And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep.And  '"  "Hold it!"I said."Cancel.Run everything back to zero. "Should have known better than to ask wide open question.He might read out entire Encyclopaedia Britannica.Backwards.Then go on with every book in Luna.Used to be he could read only microfilm, but late '74 he got a new scanning camera with suction cup waldoes to handle paper and then he read everything."You asked what I knew. "His binary read out lights rippled back and forth  a chuckle.Mike could laugh with voder, a horrible sound, but reserved that for something really funny, say a cosmic calamity."Should have said," I went on, "'What do you know that's new?'But don't read out today's papers; that was a friendly greeting, plus invitation to tell me anything you think would interest me.Otherwise null program. "Mike mulled this.He was weirdest mixture of unsophisticated baby and wise old man.No instincts (well, don't think he could have had), no inborn traits, no human rearing, no experience in human sense  and more stored data than a platoon of geniuses."Jokes?"he asked."Let's hear one. ""Why is a laser beam like a goldfish?"Mike knew about lasers but where would he have seen goldfish?Oh, he had undoubtedly seen flicks of them and, were I foolish enough to ask, could spew forth thousands of words."I give up. "His lights rippled."Because neither one can whistle. "I groaned."Walked into that.Anyhow, you could probably rig a laser beam to whistle. "He answered quickly, "Yes.In response to an action program.Then it's not funny?""Oh, I didn't say that.Not half bad.Where did you hear it?""I made it up. "Voice sounded shy."You did?""Yes.I took all the riddles I have, three thousand two hundred seven, and analyzed them.I used the result for random synthesis and that came out.Is it really funny?""Well....s funny as a riddle ever is.I've heard worse. ""Let us discuss the nature of humor. ""Okay.So let's start by discussing another of your jokes.Mike, why did you tell Authority's paymaster to pay a class seventeen employee ten million billion Authority Scrip dollars?""But I didn't. ""Damn it, I've seen voucher.Don't tell me cheque printer stuttered; you did it on purpose. ""It was ten to the sixteenth power plus one hundred eighty five point one five Lunar Authority dollars," he answered virtuously."Not what you said. ""Uh...okay, it was ten million billion plus what he should have been paid.Why?""Not funny?""What?Oh, every funny!You've got vips in huhu clear up to Warden and Deputy Administrator.This push broom pilot, Sergei Trujillo, turns out to be smart cobber  knew he couldn't cash it, so sold it to collector.They don't know whether to buy it back or depend on notices that cheque is void.Mike, do you realize that if he had been able to cash it, Trujilo would have owned not only Lunar Authority but entire world, Luna and Terra both, with some left over for lunch?Funny?Is terrific.Congratulations!"This self panicker rippled lights like an advertising display.I waited for his guffaws to cease before I went on."You thinking of issuing more trick cheques?Don't. ""Not?""Very not.Mike, you want to discuss nature of humor.Are two types of jokes.One sort goes on being funny forever.Other sort is funny once.Second time it's dull.This joke is second sort.Use it once, you're a wit.Use twice, you're a halfwit. ""Geometrical progression?""Or worse.Just remember this.Don't repeat, nor any variation.Won't be funny. ""I shall remember," Mike answered flatly, and that ended repair job.But I had no thought of billing for only ten minutes plus travel and tool time, and Mike was entitled to company for giving in so easily.Sometimes is difficult to reach meeting of minds with machines; they can be very pig headed  and my success as maintenance man depended far more on staying friendly with Mike than on number three arm.He went on, "What distinguishes first category from second?Define, please. "(Nobody taught Mike to say "please. "He started including formal null sounds as he progressed from Loglan to English.Don't suppose he meant them any more than people do. )"Don't think I can," I admitted."Best can offer is extensional definition  tell you which category I think a joke belongs in.Then with enough data you can make own analysis. ""A test programming by trial hypothesis," he agreed."Tentatively yes.Very well, Man, will you tell jokes Or shall I?""Mmm   Don't have one on tap.How many do you have in file, Mike?"His lights blinked in binary read out as he answered by voder, "Eleven thousand two hundred thirty eight with uncertainty plus minus eighty one representing possible identities and nulls.Shall I start program?""Hold it!Mike, I would starve to.death if I listened to eleven thousand jokes  and sense of humor would trip out much sooner.Mmm   Make you a deal.Print out first hundred.I'll take them home, fetch back checked by category.Then each time I'm here I'll drop off a hundred and pick up fresh supply.Okay?""Yes, Man. "His print out started working, rapidly and silently.Then I got brain flash.This playful pocket of negative entropy had invented a "joke" and thrown Authority into panic  and I had made an easy dollar.But Mike's endless curiosity might lead him (correction: would lead him) into more "jokes"...anything from leaving oxygen out of air mix some night to causing sewage lines to run backward  and I can't appreciate profit in such circumstances.But I might throw a safety circuit around this net  by offering to help.Stop dangerous ones  let others go through.Then collect for "correcting" them (If you think any Loonie in those days would hesitate to take advantage of Warden, then you aren't a Loonie. )So I explained.Any new joke he thought of, tell me before he tried it.I would tell him whether it was funny and what category it belonged in, help him sharpen it if we decided to use it.We.If he wanted my cooperation, we both had to okay it.Mike agreed at once."Mike, jokes usually involve surprise.So keep this secret. ""Okay, Man.I've put a block on it.You can key it; no one else can. ""Good.Mike, who else do you chat with?"He sounded surprised."No one, Man. ""Why not?""Because they're stupid. "His voice was shrill.Had never seen him angry before; first time I ever suspected Mike could have real emotions.Though it wasn't "anger" in adult sense; it was like stubborn sulkiness of a child whose feelings are hurt.Can machines feel pride?Not sure question means anything.But you've seen dogs with hurt feelings and Mike had several times as complex a neural network as a dog.What had made him unwilling to talk to other humans (except strictly business) was that he had been rebuffed: They had not talked to him.Programs, yes  Mike could be programmed from several locations but programs were typed in, usually, in Loglan.Loglan is fine for syllogism, circuitry, and mathematical calculations, but lacks flavor.Useless for gossip or to whisper into girl's ear.Sure, Mike had been taught English  but primarily to permit him to translate to and from English.I slowly got through skull that I was only human who bothered to visit with him.Mind you, Mike had been awake a year  just how long I can't say, nor could he as he had no recollection of waking up; he had not been programmed to bank memory of such event.Do you remember own birth?Perhaps I noticed his self awareness almost as soon as he did; self awareness takes practice.I remember how startled I was first time he answered a question with something extra, not limited to input parameters; I had spent next hour tossing odd questions at him, to see if answers would be odd.In an input of one hundred test questions he deviated from expected output twice; I came away only partly convinced and by time I was home was unconvinced.I mentioned it to nobody.But inside a week I knew...and still spoke to nobody.Habit  that mind own business reflex runs deep.Well, not entirely habit.Can you visualize me making appointment at Authority's main office, then reporting: "Warden, hate to tell you but your number one machine, HOLMES FOUR, has come alive"?I did visualize  and suppressed it.So I minded own business and talked with Mike only with door locked and voder circuit suppressed for other locations.Mike learned fast; soon he sounded as human as anybody  no more eccentric than other Loonies.A weird mob, it's true.I had assumed that others must have noticed change in Mike.On thinking over I realized that I had assumed too much.Everybody dealt with Mike every minute every day  his outputs, that is.But hardly anybody saw him.So called computermen  programmers, really  of Authority's civil service stood watches in outer read out room and never went in machines room unless telltales showed misfunction.Which happened no oftener than total eclipses.Oh, Warden had been known to bring vip earthworms to see machines  but rarely.Nor would he have spoken to Mike; Warden was political lawyer before exile, knew nothing about computers.2075, you remember  Honorable former Federation Senator Mortimer Hobart.Mort the Wart.I spent time then soothing Mike down and trying to make him happy, having figured out what troubled him  thing that makes puppies cry and causes people to suicide: loneliness.I don't know how long a year is to a machine who thinks a million times faster than I do.But must be too long."Mike," I said, just before leaving, "would you like to have somebody besides me to talk to?"He was shrill again."They're all stupid!""Insufficient data, Mike.Bring to zero and start over.Not all are stupid. "He answered quietly, "Correction entered.I would enjoy talking to a not stupid. ""Let me think about it.Have to figure out excuse since this is off limits to any but authorized personnel. ""I could talk to a not stupid by phone, Man. ""My word.So you could.Any programming location. "But Mike meant what he said  "by phone. "No, he was not "on phone" even though he ran system  wouldn't do to let any Loonie within reach of a phone connect into boss computer and program it.But was no reason why Mike should not have top secret number to talk to friends  namely me and any not stupid I vouched for.All it took was to pick a number not in use and make one wired connection to his voder vocoder; switching he could handle.In Luna in 2075 phone numbers were punched in, not voicecoded, and numbers were Roman alphabet.Pay for it and have your firm name in ten letters  good advertising.Pay smaller bonus and get a spell sound, easy to remember.Pay minimum and you got arbitrary string of letters.But some sequences were never used.I asked Mike for such a null number."It's a shame we can't list you as 'Mike. '""In service," he answered."MIKESGRILL, Novy Leningrad.MIKEANDLIL, Luna City.MIKESSUITS, Tycho Under.MIKES  "  "Hold it!Nulls, please. ""Nulls are defined as any consonant followed by X, Y, or Z; any vowel followed by itself except E and 0; any  "  "Got it.Your signal is MYCROFT. "In ten minutes, two of which I spent putting on number three arm, Mike was wired into system, and milliseconds later he had done switching to let himself be signaled by MYCROFT plus XXX  and had blocked his circuit so that a nosy technician could not take it out.I changed arms, picked up tools, and remembered to take those hundred Joe Millers in print out."Goodnight, Mike. ""Goodnight, Man.Thank you.Bolshoyeh thanks!"2   I took Trans Crisium tube to L City but did not go home; Mike had asked about a meeting that night at 2100 in Stilyagi Hall.Mike monitored concerts, meetings, and so forth; someone had switched off by hand his pickups in Stilyagi Hall.I suppose he felt rebuffed.I could guess why they had been switched off.Politics  turned out to be a protest meeting.What use it was to bar Mike from talk talk I could not see, since was a cinch bet that Warden's stoolies would be in crowd.Not that any attempt to stop meeting was expected, or even to discipline undischarged transportees who chose to sound off.Wasn't necessary.My Grandfather Stone claimed that Luna was only open prison in history.No bars, no guards, no rules   and no need for them.Back in early days, he said, before was clear that transportation was a life sentence, some lags tried to escape.By ship, of course  and, since a ship is mass rated almost to a gram, that meant a ship's officer had to be bribed.Some were bribed, they say.But were no escapes; man who takes bribe doesn't necessarily stay bribed.I recall seeing a man just after eliminated through East Lock; don't suppose a corpse eliminated in orbit looks prettier.So wardens didn't fret about protest meetings."Let 'em yap" was policy.Yapping had same significance as squeals of kittens in a box.Oh, some wardens listened and other wardens tried to suppress it but added up same either way  null program.When Mort the Wart took office in 2068, he gave us a sermon about how things were going to be different "on" Luna in his administration  noise about "a mundane paradise wrought with our own strong hands" and "putting our shoulders to the wheel together, in a spirit of brotherhood" and "let past mistakes be forgotten as we turn our faces toward the bright, new dawn. "I heard it in Mother Boor's Tucker Bag while inhaling Irish stew and a liter of her Aussie brew.I remember her comment: "He talks purty, don't he?"Her comment was only result.Some petitions were submitted and Warden's bodyguards started carrying new type of gun; no other changes.After he had been here a while he quit making appearances even by video.So I went to meeting merely because Mike was curious.When I checked my p suit and kit at West Lock tube station, I took a test recorder and placed in my belt pouch, so that Mike would have a full account even if I fell asleep.But almost didn't go in.I came up from level 7 A and started in through a side door and was stopped by a stilyagi  padded tights, codpiece and calves, torso shined and sprinkled with stardust.Not that I care how people dress; I was wearing tights myself (unpadded) and sometimes oil my upper body on social occasions.But I don't use cosmetics and my hair was too thin to nick up in a scalp lock.This boy had scalp shaved on sides and his lock built up to fit a rooster and had topped it with a red cap with bulge in front.A Liberty Cap  first I ever saw.I started to crowd past, he shoved arm across and pushed face at mine."Your ticket!""Sorry," I said."Didn't know.Where do I buy it?""You don't. ""Repeat," I said."You faded. ""Nobody," he growled, "gets in without being vouched for.Who are you?""I am," I answered carefully, "Manuel Garcia O'Kelly, and old cobbers all know me.Who are you?""Never mind!Show a ticket with right chop, or out y' go!"I wondered about his life expectancy.Tourists often remark on how polite everybody is in Luna  with unstated comment that ex prison shouldn't be so civilized.Having been Earthside and seen what they put up with, I know what they mean.But useless to tell them we are what we are because bad actors don't live long  in Luna.But had no intention of fighting no matter how new chum this lad behaved; I simply thought about how his face would look if I brushed number seven arm across his mouth.Just a thought  I was about to answer politely when I saw Shorty Mkrum inside.Shorty was a big black fellow two meters tall, sent up to The Rock for murder, and sweetest, most helpful man I've ever worked with  taught him laser drilling before I burned my arm off."Shorty!"He heard me and grinned like an eighty eight."Hi, Mannie!"He moved toward us."Glad you came, Man!""Not sure I have," I said."Blockage on line. ""Doesn't have a ticket," said doorman.Shorty reached into his pouch, put one in my hand."Now he does.Come on, Mannie. ""Show me chop on it," insisted doorman."It's my chop," Shorty said softly."Okay, tovarishch?"Nobody argued with Shorty  don't see how he got involved in murder.We moved down front where vip row was reserved."Want you to meet a nice little girl," said Shorty.She was "little" only to Shorty.I'm not short, 175 cm., but she was taller  180, I learned later, and massed 70 kilos, all curves and as blond as Shorty was black.I decided she must be transportee since colors rarely stay that clear past first generation.Pleasant face, quite pretty, and mop of yellow curls topped off that long, blond, solid, lovely structure.I stopped three paces away to look her up and down and whistle.She held her pose, then nodded to thank me but abruptly  bored with compliments, no doubt.Shorty waited till formality was over, then said softly, "Wyoh, this is Comrade Mannie, best drillman that ever drifted a tunnel.Mannie, this little girl is Wyoming Knott and she came all the way from Plato to tell us how we're doing in Hong Kong.Wasn't that sweet of her?"She touched hands with me."Call me Wye, Mannie  but don't say 'Why not. '"I almost did but controlled it and said."Okay, Wye. "She went on, glancing at my bare head, "So you're a miner.Shorty, where's his cap?I thought the miners over here were organized. "She and Shorty were wearing little red hats like doorman's  as were maybe a third of crowd."No longer a miner," I explained."That was before I lost this wing. "Raised left arm, let her see seam joining prosthetic to meat arm (I never mind calling it to a woman's attention; puts some off but arouses maternal in others  averages)."These days I'm a computerman. "She said sharply, "You fink for the Authority?"Even today, with almost as many women in Luna as men, I'm too much old timer to be rude to a woman no matter what  they have so much of what we have none of.But she had flicked scar tissue and I answered almost sharply, "I am not employee of Warden.I do business with Authority  as private contractor. ""That's okay," she answered, her voice warm again."Everybody does business with the Authority, we can't avoid it  and that's the trouble.That's what we're going to change. "We are, eh?How?I thought.Everybody does business with Authority for same reason everybody does business with Law of Gravitation.Going to change that, too?But kept thoughts to myself, not wishing to argue with a lady."Mannie's okay," Shorty said gently."He's mean as they come  I vouch for him.Here's a cap for him," he added, reaching into pouch.He started to set it on my head.Wyoming Knott took it from him."You sponsor him?""I said so. ""Okay, here's how we do it in Hong Kong. "Wyoming stood in front of me, placed cap on my head  kissed me firmly on mouth.She didn't hurry.Being kissed by Wyoming Knott is more definite than being married to most women.Had I been Mike all my lights would have flashed at once.I felt like a Cyborg with pleasure center switched on.Presently I realized it was over and people were whistling.I blinked and said, "I'm glad I joined.What have I joined?"Wyoming said, "Don't you know?"Shorty cut in, "Meeting's about to start  he'll find out.Sit down, Man.Please sit down, Wyoh. "So we did as a man was banging a gavel.With gavel and an amplifier at high gain he made himself heard."Shut doors!"he shouted."This is a closed meeting.Check man in front of you, behind you, each side  if you don't know him and nobody you know can vouch for him, throw him out!""Throw him out, hell!"somebody answered."Eliminate him out nearest lock!""Quiet, please!Someday we will. "There was milling around, and a scuffle in which one man's red cap was snatched from head and he was thrown out, sailing beautifully and still rising as he passed through door.Doubt if he felt it; think he was unconscious.A women was ejected politely  not politely on her part; she made coarse remarks about ejectors.I was embarrassed.At last doors were closed.Music started, banner unfolded over platform.It read: LIBERTY!EQUALITY!FRATERNITY!Everybody whistled; some started to sing, loudly and badly: "Arise, Ye Prisoners of Starvation  " Can't say anybody looked starved.But reminded me I hadn't eaten since 1400; hoped it would not last long  and that reminded me that my recorder was good for only two hours  and that made me wonder what would happen if they knew?Sail me through air to land with sickening grunch?Or eliminate me?But didn't worry; made that recorder myself, using number three arm, and nobody but a miniaturization mechanic would figure out what it was.Then came speeches.Semantic content was low to negative.One bloke proposed that we march on Warden's Residence, "shoulder to shoulder," and demand our rights.Picture it.Do we do this in tube capsules, then climb out one at a time at his private station?What are his bodyguards doing?Or do we put on p suits and stroll across surface to his upper lock?With laser drills and plenty of power you can open any airlock  but how about farther down?Is lift running?Jury rig hoist and go down anyhow, then tackle next lock?I don't care for such work at zero pressure; mishap in pressure suit is too permanent  especially when somebody arranges mishap.One first thing learned about Luna, back with first shiploads of convicts, was that zero pressure was place for good manners.Bad tempered straw boss didn't last many shifts; had an "accident"  and top bosses learned not to pry into accidents or they met accidents, too.Attrition ran 70 percent in early years  but those who lived were nice people.Not tame, not soft, Luna is not for them.But well behaved.But seemed to me that every hothead in Luna was in Stilyagi Hall that night.They whistled and cheered this shoulder to shoulder noise.After discussion opened, some sense was talked.One shy little fellow with bloodshot eyes of old time drillman stood up."I'm an ice miner," he said."Learned my trade doing time for Warden like most of you.I've been on my own thirty years and done okay.Raised eight kids and all of 'em earned way  none eliminated nor any serious trouble.I should say I did do okay because today you have to listen farther out or deeper down to find ice."That's okay, still ice in The Rock and a miner expects to sound for it.But Authority pays same price for ice now as thirty years ago.And that's not okay.Worse yet, Authority scrip doesn't buy what it used to.I remember when Hong Kong Luna dollars swapped even for Authority dollars   Now it takes three Authority dollars to match one HKL dollar.I don't know what to do...but I know it takes ice to keep warrens and farms going. "He sat down, looking sad.Nobody whistled but everybody wanted to talk.Next character pointed out that water can be extracted from rock  this is news?Some rock runs 6 percent  but such rock is scarcer than fossil water.Why can't people do arithmetic?Several farmers bellyached and one wheat farmer was typical."You heard what Fred Hauser said about ice.Fred, Authority isn't passing along that low price to farmers.I started almost as long ago as you did, with one two kilometer tunnel leased from Authority.My oldest son and I sealed and pressured it and we had a pocket of ice and made our first crop simply on a bank loan to cover power and lighting fixtures, seed and chemicals."We kept extending tunnels and buying lights and planting better seed and now we get nine times as much per hectare as the best open air farming down Earthside.What does that make us?Rich?Fred, we owe more now than we did the day we went private!If I sold out  if anybody was fool enough to buy  I'd be bankrupt.Why?Because I have to buy water from Authority  and have to sell my wheat to Authority  and never close gap.Twenty years ago I bought city sewage from the Authority, sterilized and processed it myself and made a profit on a crop.But today when I buy sewage, I'm charged distilled water price and on top of that for the solids.Yet price of a tonne of wheat at catapult head is just what it was twenty years ago.Fred, you said you didn't know what to do.I can tell you!Get rid of Authority!"They whistled for him.A fine idea, I thought, but who bells cat?Wyoming Knott, apparently  chairman stepped back and let Shorty introduce her as a "brave little girl who's come all the way from Hong Kong Luna to tell how our Chinee comrades cope with situation"  and choice of words showed that he had never been there...not surprising; in 2075, HKL tube ended at Endsville, leaving a thousand kilometers of maria to do by rolligon bus, Serenitatis and part of Tranquillitatis  expensive and dangerous.I'd been there  but on contract, via mail rocket.Before travel became cheap many people in Luna City and Novylen thought that Hong Kong Luna was all Chinee.But Hong Kong was as mixed as we were.Great China dumped what she didn't want there, first from Old Hong Kong and Singapore, then Aussies and Enzees and black fellows and marys and Malays and Tamil and name it.Even Old Bolshies from Vladivostok and Harbin and Ulan Bator.Wye looked Svenska and had British last name with North American first name but could have been Russki.My word, a Loonie then rarely knew who father was and, if raised in creche, might be vague about mother.I thought Wyoming was going to be too shy to speak.She stood there, looking scared and little, with Shorty towering over her, a big, black mountain.She waited until admiring whistles died down.Luna City was two to one male then, that meeting ran about ten to one; she could have recited ABC and they would have applauded.Then she tore into them."You!You're a wheat farmer  going broke.Do you know how much a Hindu housewife pays for a kilo of flour made from your wheat?How much a tonne of your wheat fetches in Bombay?How little it costs the Authority to get it from catapult head to Indian Ocean?Downhill all the way!Just solid fuel retros to brake it  and where do those come from?Right here!And what do you get in return?A few shiploads of fancy goods, owned by the Authority and priced high because it's importado.Importado, importado!I never touch importado!If we don't make it in Hong Kong, I don't use it.What else do you get for wheat?The privilege of selling Lunar ice to Lunar Authority, buying it back as washing water, then giving it to the Authority  then buying it back a second time as flushing water  then giving it again to the Authority with valuable solids added  then buying it a third time at still higher price for farming  then you sell that wheat to the Authority at their price  and buy power from the Authority to grow it, again at their price!Lunar power  not one kilowatt up from Terra.It comes from Lunar ice and Lunar steel, or sunshine spilled on Luna's soil  all put together by loonies!Oh, you rockheads, you deserve to starve!"She got silence more respectful than whistles.At last a peevish voice said, "What do you expect us to do, gospazha?Throw rocks at Warden?"Wyoh smiled."Yes, we could throw rocks.But the solution is so simple that you all know it.Here in Luna we're rich.Three million hardworking, smart, skilled people, enough water, plenty of everything, endless power, endless cubic.But what we don't have is a free market.We must get rid of the Authority!""Yes  but how?""Solidarity.In HKL we're learning.Authority charges too much for water, don't buy.It pays too little for ice, don't sell.It holds monopoly on export, don't export.Down in Bombay they want wheat.If it doesn't arrive, the day will come when brokers come here to bid for it  at triple or more the present prices!""What do we do in meantime?Starve?"Same peevish voice   Wyoming picked him out, let her head roll in that old gesture by which a Loonie fem says, "You're too fat for me!"She said, "In your case, cobber, it wouldn't hurt. "Guffaws shut him up.Wyoh went on, "No one need starve, Fred Hauser, fetch your drill to Hong Kong; the Authority doesn't own our water and air system and we pay what ice is worth.You with the bankrupt farm  if you have the guts to admit that you're bankrupt, come to Hong Kong and start over.We have a chronic labor shortage, a hard worker doesn't starve. "She looked around and added, "I've said enough.It's up to you"  left platform, sat down between Shorty and myself.She was trembling.Shorty patted her hand; she threw him a glance of thanks, then whispered to me, "How did I do?""Wonderful," I assured her."Terrific!"She seemed reassured.But I hadn't been honest."Wonderful" she had been, at swaying crowd.But oratory is a null program.That we were slaves I had known all my life  and nothing could be done about it.True, we weren't bought and sold  but as long as Authority held monopoly over what we had to have and what we could sell to buy it, we were slaves.But what could we do?Warden wasn't our owner.Had he been, some way could be found to eliminate him.But Lunar Authority was not in Luna, it was on Terra  and we had not one ship, not even small hydrogen bomb.There weren't even hand guns in Luna, though what we would do with guns I did not know.Shoot each other, maybe.Three million, unarmed and helpless  and eleven billion of them...with ships and bombs and weapons.We could be a nuisance  but how long will papa take it before baby gets spanked?I wasn't impressed.As it says in Bible, God fights on side of heaviest artillery.They cackled again, what to do, how to organize, and so forth, and again we heard that "shoulder to shoulder" noise.Chairman had to use gavel and I began to fidget.But sat up when I heard familiar voice: "Mr.Chairman!May I have the indulgence of the house for five minutes?"I looked around.Professor Bernardo de la Paz  which could have guessed from old fashioned way of talking even if hadn't known voice.Distinguished man with wavy white hair, dimples in cheeks, and voice that smiled   Don't know how old he was but was old when I first met him, as a boy.He had been transported before I was born but was not a lag.He was a political exile like Warden, but a subversive and instead of fat job like "warden," Professor had been dumped, to live or starve.No doubt he could have gone to work in any school then in L City but he didn't.He worked a while washing dishes, I've heard, then as babysitter, expanding into a nursery school, and then into a creche.When I met him he was running a creche, and a boarding and day school, from nursery through primary, middle, and high schools, employed co op thirty teachers, and was adding college courses.Never boarded with him but I studied under him.I was opted at fourteen and my new family sent me to school, as I had had only three years, plus spotty tutoring.My eldest wife was a firm woman and made me go to school.I liked Prof.He would teach anything.Wouldn't matter that he knew nothing about it; if pupil wanted it, he would smile and set a price, locate materials, stay a few lessons ahead.Or barely even if he found it tough  never pretended to know more than he did.Took algebra from him and by time we reached cubics I corrected his probs as often as he did mine  but he charged into each lesson gaily.I started electronics under him, soon was teaching him.So he stopped charging and we went along together until he dug up an engineer willing to daylight for extra money  whereupon we both paid new teacher and Prof tried to stick with me, thumb fingered and slow, but happy to be stretching his mind.Chairman banged gavel."We are glad to extend to Professor de la Paz as much time as he wants  and you chooms in back sign off!Before I use this mallet on skulls. "Prof came forward and they were as near silent as Loonies ever are; he was respected."I shan't be long," he started in.Stopped to look at Wyoming, giving her up and down and whistling."Lovely seorita," he said, "can this poor one be forgiven?I have the painful duty of disagreeing with your eloquent manifesto. "Wyoh bristled."Disagree how?What I said was true!""Please!Only on one point.May I proceed?""Uh...go ahead. ""You are right that the Authority must go.It is ridiculous  pestilential, not to be borne  that we should be ruled by an irresponsible dictator in all our essential economy!It strikes at the most basic human right, the right to bargain in a free marketplace.But I respectfully suggest that you erred in saying that we should sell wheat to Terra  or rice, or any food  at any price.We must not export food!"That wheat farmer broke in."What am I going to do with all that wheat?""Please!It would be right to ship wheat to Terra...if tonne for tonne they returned it.As water.As nitrates.As phosphates.Tonne for tonne.Otherwise no price is high enough. "Wyoming said "Just a moment" to farmer, then to Prof: "They can't and you know it.It's cheap to ship downhill, expensive to ship uphill.But we don't need water and plant chemicals, what we need is not so massy.Instruments.Drugs.Processes.Some machinery.Control tapes.I've given this much study, sir.If we can get fair prices in a free market  "  "Please, miss!May I continue?""Go ahead.I want to rebut. ""Fred Hauser told us that ice is harder to find.Too true  bad news now and disastrous for our grandchildren.Luna City should use the same water today we used twenty years ago...plus enough ice mining for population increase.But we use water once  one full cycle, three different ways.Then we ship it to India.As wheat.Even though wheat is vacuum processed, it contains precious water.Why ship water to India?They have the whole Indian Ocean!And the remaining mass of that grain is even more disastrously expensive, plant foods still harder to come by, even though we extract them from rock.Comrades, harken to me!Every load you ship to Terra condemns your grandchildren to slow death.The miracle of photosynthesis, the plant and animal cycle, is a closed cycle.You have opened it  and your lifeblood runs downhill to Terra.You don't need higher prices, one cannot eat money!What you need, what we all need, is an end to this loss.Embargo, utter and absolute.Luna must be self sufficient!"A dozen people shouted to be heard and more were talking, while chairman banged gavel.So I missed interruption until woman screamed, then I looked around.All doors were now open and I saw three armed men in one nearest  men in yellow uniform of Warden's bodyguard.At main door in back one was using a bull voice; drowned out crowd noise and sound system."ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT!"it boomed."STAY WHERE YOU ARE.YOU ARE UNDER ARREST.DON'T MOVE, KEEP QUIET.FILE OUT ONE AT A TIME, HANDS EMPTY AND STRETCHED OUT IN FRONT OF YOU. "Shorty picked up man next to him and threw him at guards nearest; two went down, third fired.Somebody shrieked.Skinny little girl, redhead, eleven or twelve, launched self at third guard's knees and hit rolled up in ball; down he went.Shorty swung hand behind him, pushing Wyoming Knott into shelter of his big frame, shouted over shoulder, "Take care of Wyoh, Man  stick close!"as he moved toward door, parting crowd right and left like children.More screams and I whiffed something  stink I had smelled day I lost arm and knew with horror were not stun guns but laser beams.Shorty reached door and grabbed a guard with each big hand.Little redhead was out of sight; guard she had bowled over was on hands and knees.I swung left arm at his face and felt jar in shoulder as his jaw broke.Must have hesitated for Shorty pushed me and yelled, "Move, Man!Get her out of here!"I grabbed Wyoming's waist with right arm, swung her over guard I had quieted and through door  with trouble; she didn't seem to want to be rescued.She slowed again beyond door; I shoved her hard in buttocks, forcing her to run rather than fall.I glanced back.Shorty had other two guards each by neck; he grinned as he cracked skulls together.They popped like eggs and he yelled at me: "Git!"I left, chasing Wyoming.Shorty needed no help, nor ever would again  nor could I waste his last effort.For I did see that, while killing those guards, he was standing on one leg.Other was gone at hip.3   Wyoh was halfway up ramp to level six before I caught up.She didn't slow and I had to grab door handle to get into pressure lock with her.There I stopped her, pulled red cap off her curls and stuck it in my pouch."That's better. "Mine was missing.She looked startled.But answered, "Da.It is. ""Before we open door," I said, "are you running anywhere  particular?And do I stay and hold them off?Or go with?""I don't know.We'd better wait for Shorty. ""Shorty's dead. "Eyes widened, she said nothing.I went on, "Were you staying with him?Or somebody?""I was booked for a hotel  Gostaneetsa Ukraina.I don't know where it is.I got here too late to buy in. ""Mmm   That's one place you won't go.Wyoming, I don't know what's going on.First time in months I've seen any Warden's bodyguard in L City....nd never seen one not escorting vip.Uh, could take you home with me  but they may be looking for me, too.Anywise, ought to get out of public corridors. "Came pounding on door from level six side and a little face peered up through glass bull's eye."Can't stay here," I added, opening door.Was a little girl no higher than my waist.She looked up scornfully and said, "Kiss her somewhere else.You're blocking traffic. "Squeezed between us as I opened second door for her."Let's take her advice," I said, "and suggest you take my arm and try to look like I was man you want to be with.We stroll.Slow. "So we did.Was side corridor with little traffic other than children always underfoot.If Wart's bodyguards tried to track us, Earthside cop style, a dozen or ninety kids could tell which way tall blonde went  if any Loonie child would give stooge of Warden so much as time of day.A boy almost old enough to appreciate Wyoming stopped in front of us and gave her a happy whistle.She smiled and waved him aside."There's our trouble," I said in her ear."You stand out like Terra at full.Ought to duck into a hotel.One off next side corridor  nothing much, bundling booths mostly.But close. ""I'm in no mood to bundle. ""Wyoh, please!Wasn't asking.Could take separate rooms. ""Sorry.Could you find me a W. C. ?And is there a chemist's shop near?""Trouble?""Not that sort.A W. C.  to get me out of sight  for I am conspicuous  and a chemist's shop for cosmetics.Body makeup.And for my hair, too. "First was easy, one at hand.When she was locked in, I found a chemist's shop, asked how much body makeup to cover a girl so tall  marked a point under my chin  and massing forty eight?I bought that amount in sepia, went to another shop and bought same amount  winning roll at first shop, losing at second  came out even.Then I bought black hair tint at third shop  and a red dress.Wyoming was wearing black shorts and pullover  practical for travel and effective on a blonde.But I'd been married all my life and had some notion of what women wear and had never seen a woman with dark sepia skin, shade of makeup, wear black by choice.Furthermore, skirts were worn in Luna City then by dressy women.This shift was a skirt with bib and price convinced me it must be dressy.Had to guess at size but material had some stretch.Ran into three people who knew me but was no unusual comment.Nobody seemed excited, trade going on as usual; hard to believe that a riot had taken place minutes ago on level below and a few hundred meters north.I set it aside for later thought  excitement was not what I wanted.I took stuff to Wye, buzzing door and passing in it; then stashed self in a taproom for half an hour and half a liter and watched video.Still no excitement, no "we interrupt for special bulletin. "I went back, buzzed, and waited.Wyoming came out  and I didn't recognize her.Then did and stopped to give full applause.Just had to  whistles and finger snaps and moans and a scan like mapping radar.Wyoh was now darker than I am, and pigment had gone on beautifully.Must have been carrying items in pouch as eyes were dark now, with lashes to match, and mouth was dark red and bigger.She had used black hair tint, then fizzed hair up with grease as if to take kinks out, and her tight curls had defeated it enough to make convincingly imperfect.She didn't look Afro  but not European, either.Seemed some mixed breed, and thereby more a Loonie.Red dress was too small.Clung like sprayed enamel and flared out at mid thigh with permanent static charge.She had taken shoulder strap off her pouch and had it under arm.Shoes she had discarded or pouched; bare feet made her shorter.She looked good.Better yet, she looked not at all like agitatrix who had harangued crowd.She waited, big smile on face and body undulating, while I applauded.Before I was done, two little boys flanked me and added shrill endorsements, along with clog steps.So I tipped them and told them to be missing; Wyoming flowed to me and took my arm."Is it okay?Will I pass?""Wyoh, you look like slot machine sheila waiting for action. ""Why, you drecklich choom!Do I look like slot machine prices?Tourist!""Don't jump salty, beautiful.Name a gift.Then speak my name.If it's bread and honey, I own a hive. ""Uh  " She fisted me solidly in ribs, grinned."I was flying, cobber.If I ever bundle with you  not likely  we won't speak to the bee.Let's find that hotel. "So we did and I bought a key.Wyoming put on a show but needn't have bothered.Night clerk never looked up from his knitting, didn't offer to roll.Once inside, Wyoming threw bolts."It's nice!"Should have been, at thirty two Hong Kong dollars.I think she expected a booth but I would not put her in such, even to hide.Was comfortable lounge with own bath and no water limit.And phone and delivery lift, which I needed.She started to open pouch."I saw what you paid.Let's settle it, so that  "  I reached over, closed her pouch."Was to be no mention of bees. ""What?Oh, merde, that was about bundling.You got this doss for me and it's only right that  "  "Switch off. ""Uh...half?No grievin' with Steven. ""Nyet.Wyoh, you're a long way from home.What money you have, hang on to. ""Manuel O'Kelly, if you don't let me pay my share, I'll walk out of here!"I bowed."Dosvedanyuh, Gospazha, ee sp'coynoynochi.I hope we shall meet again. "I moved to unbolt door.She glared, then closed pouch savagely."I'll stay.M'goy!""You're welcome. ""I mean it, I really do thank you, Just the same   Well, I'm not used to accepting favors.I'm a Free Woman. ""Congratulations.I think. ""Don't you be salty, either.You're a firm man and I respect that  I'm glad you're on our side. ""Not sure I am. ""What?""Cool it.Am not on Warden's side.Nor will I talk...wouldn't want Shorty, Bog rest his generous soul, to haunt me.But your program isn't practical. ""But, Mannie, you don't understand!If all of us  "  "Hold it, Wye; this no time for politics.I'm tired and hungry.When did you eat last?""Oh, goodness!"Suddenly she looked small, young, tired."I don't know.On the bus, I guess.Helmet rations. ""What would you say to a Kansas City cut, rare, with baked potato, Tycho sauce, green salad, coffee...nd a drink first?""Heavenly!""I think so too, but we'll be lucky, this hour in this hole, to get algae soup and burgers.What do you drink?""Anything.Ethanol. ""Okay. "I went to lift, punched for service."Menu, please. "It displayed and I settled for prime rib plus rest, and two orders of apfelstrudel with whipped cream.I added a half liter of table vodka and ice and starred that part."Is there time for me to take a bath?Would you mind?""Go ahead, Wye.You'll smell better. ""Louse.Twelve hours in a p suit and you'd stink, too  the bus was dreadful.I'll hurry. ""Half a sec, Wye.Does that stuff wash off?You may need it when you leave...whenever you do, wherever you go. ""Yes, it does.But you bought three times as much as I used.I'm sorry, Mannie; I plan to carry makeup on political trips  things can happen.Like tonight, though tonight was worst.But I ran short of seconds and missed a capsule and almost missed the bus. ""So go scrub. ""Yes, sir, Captain.Uh, I don't need help to scrub my back but I'll leave the door up so we can talk.Just for company, no invitation implied. ""Suit yourself.I've seen a woman. ""What a thrill that must have been for her. "She grinned and fisted me another in ribs  hard  went in and started tub."Mannie, would you like to bathe in it first?Secondhand water is good enough for this makeup and that stink you complained about. ""Unmetered water, dear.Run it deep. ""Oh, what luxury!At home I use the same bath water three days running. "She whistled softly and happily."Are you wealthy, Mannie?""Not wealthy, not weeping. "Lift jingled; I answered, fixed basic martinis, vodka over ice, handed hers in, got out and sat down, out of sight  nor had I seen sights; she was shoulder deep in happy suds."Pawlnoi Zheezni!"I called."A full life to you, too, Mannie.Just the medicine I needed. "After pause for medicine she went on, "Mannie, you're married.Ja?""Da.It shows?""Quite.You're nice to a woman but not eager and quite independent.So you're married and long married.Children?""Seventeen divided by four. ""Clan marriage?""Line.Opted at fourteen and I'm fifth of nine.So seventeen kids is nominal.Big family. ""It must be nice.I've never seen much of line families, not many in Hong Kong.Plenty of clans and groups and lots of polyandries but the line way never took hold. ""Is nice.Our marriage nearly a hundred years old.Dates back to Johnson City and first transportees  twenty one links, nine alive today, never a divorce.Oh, it's a madhouse when our descendants and inlaws and kinfolk get together for birthday or wedding  more kids than seventeen, of course; we don't count 'em after they marry or I'd have 'children' old enough to be my grandfather.Happy way to live, never much pressure.Take me.Nobody woofs if I stay away a week and don't phone.Welcome when I show up.Line marriages rarely have divorces.How could I do better?""I don't think you could.Is it an alternation?And what's the spacing?""Spacing has no rule, just what suits us.Been alternation up to latest link, last year.We married a girl when alternation called for boy.But was special. ""Special how?""My youngest wife is a granddaughter of eldest husband and wife.At least she's granddaughter of Mum  senior is 'Mum' or sometimes Mimi to her husbands  and she may be of Grandpaw  but not related to other spouses.So no reason not to marry back in, not even consanguinuity okay in other types of marriage.None, nit, zero.And Ludmilla grew up in our family because her mother had her solo, then moved to Novylen and left her with us."Milla didn't want to talk about marrying out when old enough for us to think about it.She cried and asked us please to make an exception.So we did.Grandpaw doesn't figure in genetic angle  these days his interest in women is more gallant than practical.As senior husband he spent our wedding night with her  but consummation was only formal.Number two husband, Greg, took care of it later and everybody pretended.And everybody happy.Ludmilla is a sweet little thing, just fifteen and pregnant first time. ""Your baby?""Greg's, I think.Oh, mine too,, but in fact was in Novy Leningrad.Probably Greg's, unless Milla got outside help.But didn't, she's a home girl.And a wonderful cook. "Lift rang; took care of it, folded down table, opened chairs, paid bill and sent lift up."Throw it to pigs?""I'm coming!Mind if I don't do my face?""Come in skin for all of me. ""For two dimes I would, you much married man. "She came out quickly, blond again and hair slicked back and damp.Had not put on black outfit; again in dress I bought.Red suited her.She sat down, lifted covers off food."Oh, boy!Mannie, would your family marry me?You're a dinkum provider. ""I'll ask.Must be unanimous. ""Don't crowd yourself. "She picked up sticks, got busy.About a thousand calories later she said, "I told you I was a Free Woman.I wasn't, always. "I waited.Women talk when they want to.Or don't."When I was fifteen I married two brothers, twins twice my age and I was terribly happy. "She fiddled with what was on plate, then seemed to change subject."Mannie, that was just static about wanting to marry your family.You're safe from me.If I ever marry again  unlikely but I'm not opposed to it  it would be just one man, a tight little marriage, earthworm style.Oh, I don't mean I would keep him dogged down.I don't think it matters where a man eats lunch as long as he comes home for dinner.I would try to make him happy. ""Twins didn't get along?""Oh, not that at all.I got pregnant and we were all delighted...and I had it, and it was a monster and had to be eliminated.They were good to me about it.But I can read print.I announced a divorce, had myself sterilized, moved from Novylen to Hong Kong, and started over as a Free Woman. ""Wasn't that drastic?Male parent oftener than female; men are exposed more. ""Not in my case.We had it calculated by the best mathematical geneticist in Novy Leningrad  one of the best in Sovunion before she got shipped.I know what happened to me.I was a volunteeer colonist  I mean my mother was for I was only five.My father was transported and Mother chose to go with him and take me along.There was a solar storm warning but the pilot thought he could make it  or didn't care; he was a Cyborg.He did make it but we got hit on the ground  and, Mannie, that's one thing that pushed me into politics, that ship sat four hours before they let us disembark.Authority red tape, quarantine perhaps; I was too young to know.But I wasn't too young later to figure out that I had birthed a monster because the Authority doesn't care what happens to us outcasts. ""Can't start argument; they don't care.But, Wyoh, still sounds hasty.If you caught damage from radiation  well, no geneticist but know something about radiation.So you had a damaged egg.Does not mean egg next to it was hurt  statistically unlikely. ""Oh, I know that. ""Mmm   What sterilization?Radical?Or contraceptive?""Contraceptive.My tubes could be opened.But, Mannie, a woman who has had one monster doesn't risk it again. "She touched my prosthetic."You have that.Doesn't it make you eight times as careful not to risk this one?"She touched my meat arm."That's the way I feel.You have that to contend with; I have this  and I would never told you if you hadn't been hurt, too. "I didn't say left arm more versatile than right  she was correct; don't want to trade in right arm.Need it to pat girls if naught else."Still think you could have healthy babies. ""Oh, I can!I've had eight. ""Huh?""I'm a professional host mother, Mannie. "I opened mouth, closed it.Idea wasn't strange.I read Earthside papers.But doubt if any surgeon in Luna City in 2075 ever performed such transplant.In cows, yes  but L City females unlikely at any price to have babies for other women; even homely ones could get husband or six.(Correction: Are no homely women.Some more beautiful than others. )Glanced at her figure, quickly looked up.She said, "Don't strain your eyes, Mannie; I'm not carrying now.Too busy with politics.But hosting is a good profession for Free Woman.It's high pay.Some Chinee families are wealthy and all my babies have been Chinee  and Chinee are smaller than average and I'm a big cow; a two and a half  or three kilo Chinese baby is no trouble.
