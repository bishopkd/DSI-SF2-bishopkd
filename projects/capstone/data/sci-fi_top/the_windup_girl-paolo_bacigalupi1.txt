  1  "No!I don't want the mangosteen. "Anderson Lake leans forward, pointing."I want that one, there.Kaw pollamai nee khap.The one with the red skin and the green hairs. "The peasant woman smiles, showing teeth blackened from chewing betel nut, and points to a pyramid of fruits stacked beside her."Un nee chai mai kha?""Right.Those.Khap. "Anderson nods and makes himself smile."What are they called?""Ngaw. "She pronounces the word carefully for his foreign ear, and hands across a sample.Anderson takes the fruit, frowning."It's new?""Kha. "She nods an affirmative.Anderson turns the fruit in his hand, studying it.It's more like a gaudy sea anemone or a furry puffer fish than a fruit.Coarse green tendrils protrude from all sides, tickling his palm.The skin has the rust red tinge of blister rust, but when he sniffs he doesn't get any stink of decay.It seems perfectly healthy, despite its appearance."Ngaw," the peasant woman says again, and then, as if reading his mind."New.No blister rust. "Anderson nods absently.Around him, the market soi bustles with Bangkok 's morning shoppers.Mounds of durians fill the alley in reeking piles and water tubs splash with snakehead fish and red fin plaa.Overhead, palm oil polymer tarps sag under the blast furnace heat of the tropic sun, shading the market with hand painted images of clipper ship trading companies and the face of the revered Child Queen.A man jostles past, holding vermilion combed chickens high as they flap and squawk outrage on their way to slaughter, and women in brightly colored pha sin bargain and smile with the vendors, driving down the price of pirated U Tex rice and new variant tomatoes.None of it touches Anderson."Ngaw," the woman says again, seeking connection.The fruit's long hairs tickle his palm, challenging him to recognize its origin.Another Thai genehacking success, just like the tomatoes and eggplants and chiles that abound in the neighboring stalls.It's as if the Grahamite Bible's prophecies are coming to pass.As if Saint Francis himself stirs in his grave, restless, preparing to stride forth onto the land, bearing with him the bounty of history's lost calories."And he shall come with trumpets, and Eden shall return"  Anderson turns the strange hairy fruit in his hand.It carries no stink of cibiscosis.No scab of blister rust.No graffiti of genehack weevil engraves its skin.The world's flowers and vegetables and trees and fruits make up the geography of Anderson Lake 's mind, and yet nowhere does he find a helpful signpost that leads him to identification.Ngaw.A mystery.He mimes that he would like to taste and the peasant woman takes back the fruit.Her brown thumb easily tears away the hairy rind, revealing a pale core.Translucent and veinous, it resembles nothing so much as the pickled onions served in martinis at research clubs in Des Moines.She hands back the fruit.Anderson sniffs tentatively.Inhales floral syrup.Ngaw.It shouldn't exist.Yesterday, it didn't.Yesterday, not a single stall in Bangkok sold these fruits, and yet now they sit in pyramids, piled all around this grimy woman where she squats on the ground under the partial shading of her tarp.From around her neck, a gold glinting amulet of the martyr Phra Seub winks at him, a talisman of protection against the agricultural plagues of the calorie companies.Anderson wishes he could observe the fruit in its natural habitat, hanging from a tree or lurking under the leaves of some bush.With more information, he might guess genus and family, might divine some whisper of the genetic past that the Thai Kingdom is trying to excavate, but there are no more clues.He slips the ngaw's slick translucent ball into his mouth.A fist of flavor, ripe with sugar and fecundity.The sticky flower bomb coats his tongue.It's as though he's back in the HiGro fields of Iowa, offered his first tiny block of hard candy by a Midwest Compact agronomist when he was nothing but a farmer's boy, barefoot amid the corn stalks.The shell shocked moment of flavor real flavor after a lifetime devoid of it.Sun pours down.Shoppers jostle and bargain, but nothing touches him.He rolls the ngaw around in his mouth, eyes closed, tasting the past, savoring the time when this fruit must once have flourished, before cibiscosis and Nippon genehack weevil and blister rust and scabis mold razed the landscape.Under the hammer heat of tropic sun, surrounded by the groan of water buffalo and the cry of dying chickens, he is one with paradise.If he were a Grahamite, he would fall to his knees and give ecstatic thanks for the flavor of Eden 's return.Anderson spits the black pit into his hand, smiling.He has read travelogues of history's botanists and explorers, the men and women who pierced the deepest jungle wildernesses of the earth in search of new species and yet their discoveries cannot compare to this single fruit.Those people all sought discoveries.He has found a resurrection.The peasant woman beams, sure of a sale."Ao gee kilo kha?"How much?"Are they safe?"he asks.She points at the Environment Ministry certificates laid on the cobbles beside her, underlining the dates of inspection with a finger."Latest variation," she says."Top grade. "Anderson studies the glinting seals.Most likely, she bribed the white shirts for stamps rather than going through the full inspection process that would have guaranteed immunity to eighth generation blister rust along with resistance to cibiscosis 111. mt7 and mt8.The cynical part of him supposes that it hardly matters.The intricate stamps that glitter in the sun are more talismanic than functional, something to make people feel secure in a dangerous world.In truth, if cibiscosis breaks out again, these certificates will do nothing.It will be a new variation, and all the old tests will be useless, and then people will pray to their Phra Seub amulets and King Rama XII images and make offerings at the City Pillar Shrine, and they will all cough up the meat of their lungs no matter how many Environment Ministry stamps adorn their produce.Anderson pockets the ngaw's pit."I'll take a kilo.No.Two.Song. "He hands over a hemp sack without bothering to bargain.Whatever she asks, it will be too little.Miracles are worth the world.A unique gene that resists a calorie plague or utilizes nitrogen more efficiently sends profits sky rocketing.If he looks around the market right now, that truth is everywhere displayed.The alley bustles with Thais purchasing everything from generipped versions of U Tex rice to vermilion variant poultry.But all of those things are old advances, based on previous genehack work done by AgriGen and PurCal and Total Nutrient Holdings.The fruits of old science, manufactured in the bowels of the Midwest Compact's research labs.The ngaw is different.The ngaw doesn't come from the Midwest.The Thai Kingdom is clever where others are not.It thrives while countries like India and Burma and Vietnam all fall like dominoes, starving and begging for the scientific advances of the calorie monopolies.A few people stop to examine Anderson 's purchase, but even if Anderson thinks the price is low, they apparently find it too expensive and pass on.The woman hands across the ngaw, and Anderson almost laughs with pleasure.Not a single one of these furry fruits should exist; he might as well be hefting a sack of trilobites.If his guess about the ngaw's origin is correct, it represents a return from extinction as shocking as if a Tyrannosaurus were stalking down Thanon Sukhumvit.But then, the same is true of the potatoes and tomatoes and chiles that fill the market, all piled in such splendid abundance, an array of fecund nightshades that no one has seen in generations.In this drowning city, all things seem possible.Fruits and vegetables return from the grave, extinct flowers blossom on the avenues, and behind it all, the Environment Ministry works magic with the genetic material of generations lost.Carrying his sacked fruit, Anderson squeezes back down the soi to the avenue beyond.A seethe of traffic greets him, morning commuters clogging Thanon Rama IX like the Mekong in flood.Bicycles and cycle rickshaws, blue black water buffaloes and great shambling megodonts.At Anderson 's arrival, Lao Gu emerges from the shade of a crumbling office tower, carefully pinching off the burning tip of a cigarette.Nightshades again.They're everywhere.Nowhere else in the world, but here they riot in abundance.Lao Gu tucks the remainder of the tobacco into a ragged shirt pocket as he trots ahead of Anderson to their cycle rickshaw.The old Chinese man is nothing but a scarecrow, dressed in rags, but still, he is lucky.Alive, when most of his people are dead.Employed, while his fellow Malayan refugees are packed like slaughter chickens into sweltering Expansion towers.Lao Gu has stringy muscle on his bones and enough money to indulge in Singha cigarettes.To the rest of the yellow card refugees he is as lucky as a king.Lao Gu straddles the cycle's saddle and waits patiently as Anderson clambers into the passenger seat behind."Office," Anderson says."Bai khap. "Then switches to Chinese."Zou ba. "The old man stands on his pedals and they merge into traffic.Around them, bicycle bells ring like cibiscosis chimes, irritated at their obstruction.Lao Gu ignores them and weaves deeper into the traffic flow.Anderson reaches for another ngaw, then restrains himself.He should save them.They're too valuable to gobble like a greedy child.The Thais have found some new way to disinter the past, and all he wants to do is feast on the evidence.He drums his fingers on the bagged fruit, fighting for self control.To distract himself, he fishes for his pack of cigarettes and lights one.He draws on the tobacco, savoring the burn, remembering his surprise when he first discovered how successful the Thai Kingdom had become, how widely spread the nightshades.And as he smokes, he thinks of Yates.Remembers the man's disappointment as they sat across from one another with resurrected history smoldering between them.* * *   "Nightshades. "Yates' match flared in the dimness of SpringLife's offices, illuminating florid features as he touched flame to a cigarette and drew hard.Rice paper crackled.The tip glowed and Yates exhaled, sending a stream of smoke ceilingward to where crank fans panted against the sauna swelter."Eggplants.Tomatoes.Chiles.Potatoes.Jasmine.Nicotiana. "He held up his cigarette and quirked an eyebrow."Tobacco. "He drew again, squinting in the cigarette's flare.All around, the shadowed desks and treadle computers of the company sat silent.In the evening, with the factory closed, it was just possible to mistake the empty desks for something other than the topography of failure.The workers might have only gone home, resting in anticipation of another hard day at their labors.Dust mantled chairs and treadle computers put the lie to it but in the dimness, with shadows draped across furniture and moonlight easing through mahogany shutters, it was possible to imagine what might have been.Overhead, the crank fans continued their slow turns, Laotian rubber motorbands creaking rhythmically as they chained across the ceiling, drawing a steady trickle of kinetic power from the factory's central kink springs."The Thais have been lucky in their laboratories," Yates said, "and now here you are.If I were superstitions, I'd think they conjured you along with their tomatoes.Every organism needs a predator, I understand. ""You should have reported how much progress they were making," Anderson said."This factory wasn't your only responsibility. "Yates grimaced.His face was a study in tropic collapse.Broken blood vessels mapped rosy tributaries over his cheeks and punctuated the bulb of his nose.Watery blue eyes blinked back at Anderson, as hazy as the city's dung choked air."I should have known you'd cut my niche. ""It's not personal. ""Just my life's work. "He laughed, a dry rattling reminiscent of early onset cibiscosis.The sound would have had Anderson backing out of the room if he didn't know that Yates, like all of AgriGen's personnel, had been inoculated against the new strains."I've spent years building this," Yates said, "and you tell me it's not personal. "He waved toward the office's observation windows where they overlooked the manufacturing floor."I've got kink springs the size of my fist that hold a gigajoule of power.Quadruple the capacity weight ratio of any other spring on the market.I'm sitting on a revolution in energy storage, and you're throwing it away. "He leaned forward."We haven't had power this portable since gasoline. ""Only if you can produce it. ""We're close," Yates insisted."Just the algae baths.They're the only sticking point. "Anderson said nothing.Yates seemed to take this as encouragement."The fundamental concept is sound.Once the baths are producing in sufficient quantities "  "You should have informed us when you first saw the nightshades in the markets.The Thais have been successfully growing potatoes for at least five seasons.They're obviously sitting on top of a seedbank, and yet we heard nothing from you. ""Not my department.I do energy storage.Not production. "Anderson snorted."Where are you going to get the calories to wind your fancy kink springs if a crop fails?Blister rust is mutating every three seasons now.Recreational generippers are hacking into our designs for TotalNutrient Wheat and SoyPRO.Our last strain of HiGro Corn only beat weevil predation by sixty percent, and now we suddenly hear you're sitting on top of a genetic gold mine.People are starving "  Yates laughed."Don't talk to me about saving lives.I saw what happened with the seedbank in Finland. ""We weren't the ones who blew the vaults.No one knew the Finns were such fanatics. ""Any fool on the street could have anticipated.Calorie companies do have a certain reputation.  ""It wasn't my operation. "Yates laughed again."That's always our excuse, isn't it?The company goes in somewhere and we all stand back and wash our hands.Pretend like we weren't the ones responsible.The company pulls SoyPRO from the Burmese market, and we all stand aside, saying intellectual property disputes aren't our department.But people starve just the same. "He sucked on his cigarette, blew smoke."I honestly don't know how someone like you sleeps at night. ""It's easy.I say a little prayer to Noah and Saint Francis, and thank God we're still one step ahead of blister rust. ""That's it then?You'll shut the factory down?""No.Of course not.The kink spring manufacturing will continue. ""Oh?"Yates leaned forward, hopeful.Anderson shrugged."It's a useful cover. "* * *   The cigarette's burning tip reaches Anderson's fingers.He lets it fall into traffic.Rubs his singed thumb and index finger as Lao Gu pedals on through the clogged streets.Bangkok, City of Divine Beings, slides past.Saffron robed monks stroll along the sidewalks under the shade of black umbrellas.Children run in clusters, shoving and swarming, laughing and calling out to one another on their way to monastery schools.Street vendors extend arms draped with garlands of marigolds for temple offerings and hold up glinting amulets of revered monks to protect against everything from infertility to scabis mold.Food carts smoke and hiss with the scents of frying oil and fermented fish while around the ankles of their customers, the flicker shimmer shapes of cheshires twine, yowling and hoping for scraps.Overhead, the towers of Bangkok's old Expansion loom, robed in vines and mold, windows long ago blown out, great bones picked clean.Without air conditioning or elevators to make them habitable, they stand and blister in the sun.The black smoke of illegal dung fires wafts from their pores, marking where Malayan refugees hurriedly scald chapatis and boil kopi before the white shirts can storm the sweltering heights and beat them for their infringements.In the center of the traffic lanes, northern refugees from the coal war prostrate themselves with hands upstretched, exquisitely polite in postures of need.Cycles and rickshaws and megodont wagons flow past them, parting like a river around boulders.The cauliflower growths of fa' gan fringe scar the beggars' noses and mouths.Betel nut stains blacken their teeth.Anderson reaches into his pocket and tosses cash at their feet, nodding slightly at their wais of thanks as he glides past.A short while later, the whitewashed walls and alleys of the farang manufacturing district come into view.Warehouses and factories all packed together along with the scent of salt and rotting fish.Vendors scab along the alley lengths with bits of tarping and blankets spread above to protect them from the hammer blast of the sun.Just beyond, the dike and lock system of King Rama XII's seawall looms, holding back the weight of the blue ocean.It's difficult not to always be aware of those high walls and the pressure of the water beyond.Difficult to think of the City of Divine Beings as anything other than a disaster waiting to happen.But the Thais are stubborn and have fought to keep their revered city of Krung Thep from drowning.With coal burning pumps and leveed labor and a deep faith in the visionary leadership of their Chakri Dynasty, they have so far kept at bay that thing which has swallowed New York and Rangoon, Mumbai and New Orleans.Lao Gu forges down an alley, ringing his bell impatiently at the coolie laborers who clot the artery.WeatherAll crates rock on brown backs.Logos for Chaozhou Chinese kink springs, Matsushita anti bacterial handlegrips, and Bo Lok ceramic water filters sway back and forth, hypnotic with shambling rhythm.Images of the Buddha's teachings and the revered Child Queen splash along the factory walls, jostling with hand painted pictures of muay thai matches past.The SpringLife factory rises over the traffic press, a high walled fortress punctuated by huge fans turning slowly in its upper story vents.Across the soi a Chaozhou bicycle factory mirrors it, and between them, the barnacle accretion of jumbled street carts that always clog around the entrances of factories, selling snacks and lunches to the workers inside.Lao Gu brakes inside the SpringLife courtyard and deposits Anderson before the factory's main doors.Anderson climbs down from the rickshaw, grabs his sack of ngaw, and stands for a moment, staring up at the eight meter wide doors that facilitate megodont access.The factory ought to be renamed Yates' Folly.The man was a terrible optimist.Anderson can still hear him arguing the wonders of genehacked algae, digging through desk drawers for graphs and scrawled notes as he protested."You can't pre judge my work just because the Ocean Bounty project was a failure.Properly cured, the algae provides exponential improvements in torque absorption.Forget its calorie potential.Focus on the industrial applications.I can deliver the entire energy storage market to you, if you'll just give me a little more time.Try one of my demo springs at least, before you make a decision"  The roar of manufacturing envelopes Anderson as he enters the factory, drowning out the last despairing howl of Yates' optimism.Megodonts groan against spindle cranks, their enormous heads hanging low, prehensile trunks scraping the ground as they tread slow circles around power spindles.The genehacked animals comprise the living heart of the factory's drive system, providing energy for conveyor lines and venting fans and manufacturing machinery.Their harnesses clank rhythmically as they strain forward.Union handlers in red and gold walk beside their charges, calling out to the beasts, switching them occasionally, encouraging the elephant derived animals to greater labor.On the opposite side of the factory, the production line excretes newly packaged kink springs, sending them past Quality Assurance and on to Packaging where the springs are palletized in preparation for some theoretical time when they will be ready for export.At Anderson's arrival on the floor, workers pause in their labors and wai, pressing their palms together and raising them to their foreheads in a wave of respect that cascades down the line.Banyat, his head of QA, hurries over smiling.He wais.Anderson gives a perfunctory wai in return."How's quality?"Banyat smiles."Dee khap.Good.Better.Come, look. "He signals up the line and Num, the day foreman, rings the warning bell that announces full line stop.Banyat motions Anderson to follow."Something interesting.You will be pleased. "Anderson smiles tightly, doubting that anything Banyat says will be truly pleasing.He pulls a ngaw out of the bag and offers it to the QA man."Progress?Really?"Banyat nods as he takes the fruit.He gives it a cursory glance and peels it.Pops the semi translucent heart into his mouth.He shows no surprise.No special reaction.Just eats the damn thing without a second thought.Anderson grimaces.Farang are always the last to know about changes in the country, a fact that Hock Seng likes to point out when his paranoid mind begins to suspect that Anderson intends to fire him.Hock Seng probably already knows about this fruit as well, or will pretend when he asks.Banyat tosses the fruit's pit into a bin of feed for the megodonts and leads Anderson down the line."We fixed a problem with the cutting press," he says.Num rings his warning bell again and workers step back from their stations.On the third sounding of the bell, the union mahout tap their charges with bamboo switches and the megodonts shamble to a halt.The production line slows.At the far end of the factory, industrial kink spring drums tick and squeal as the factory's flywheels shed power into them, the juice that will restart the line when Anderson is done inspecting.Banyat leads Anderson down the now silent line, past more wai ing workers in their green and white livery, and pushes aside the palm oil polymer curtains that mark the entrance to the fining room.Here, Yates' industrial discovery is sprayed with glorious abandon, coating the kink springs with the residue of genetic serendipity.Women and children wearing triple filter masks look up and tear away their breathing protection to wai deeply to the man who feeds them.Their faces are streaked with sweat and pale powder.Only the skin around their mouths and noses remains dark where the filters have protected them.He and Banyat pass through the far side and into the swelter of the cutting rooms.Temper lamps blaze with energy and the tide pool reek of breeding algae clogs the air.Overhead, tiered racks of drying screens reach the ceiling, smeared with streamers of generipped algae, dripping and withering and blackening into paste in the heat.The sweating line techs are stripped to nearly nothing just shorts and tanks and protective head gear.It is a furnace, despite the rush of crank fans and generous venting systems.Sweat rolls down Anderson's neck.His shirt is instantly soaked.Banyat points."Here.See. "He runs his finger along a disassembled cutting bar that lies beside the main line.Anderson kneels to inspect the surface."Rust," Banyat murmurs."I thought we inspected for that. ""Saltwater. "Banyat smiles uncomfortably."The ocean is close. "Anderson grimaces at the dripping algae racks overhead."The algae tanks and drying racks don't help.Whoever thought we could just use waste heat to cure the stuff was a fool.Energy efficient my ass. "Banyat gives another embarrassed smile, but says nothing."So you've replaced the cutting tools?""Twenty five percent reliability now. ""That much better?"Anderson nods perfunctorily.He signals to the tool leader and the man shouts out through the fining room to Num.The warning bell rings again and the heat presses and temper lamps begin to glow as electricity pours into the system.Anderson shies from the sudden increase in heat.The burning lamps and presses represent a carbon tax of fifteen thousand baht every time they begin to glow, a portion of the Kingdom's own global carbon budget that SpringLife pays handsomely to siphon off.Yates' manipulation of the system was ingenious, allowing the factory to use the country's carbon allocation, but the expense of the necessary bribes is still extraordinary.The main flywheels spin up and the factory shivers as gears beneath the floor engage.The floorboards vibrate.Kinetic power sparks through the system like adrenaline, a tingling anticipation of the energy about to pour into the manufacturing line.A megodont screams protest and is lashed into silence.The whine of the flywheels rises to a howl, and then cuts off as joules gush into the drive system.The line boss' bell rings again.Workers step forward to align the cutting tools.They're producing two gigajoule kink springs, and the smaller size requires extra care with the machinery.Further down the line, the spooling process begins and the cutting press with its newly repaired precision blades rises into the air on hydraulic jacks, hissing."Khun, please. "Banyat motions Anderson behind a protection cage.Num's bell rings a final time.The line grinds into gear.Anderson feels a brief thrill as the system engages.Workers crouch behind their shields.Kink spring filament hisses out from alignment flanges and threads through a series of heated rollers.A spray of stinking reactant showers the rust colored filament, greasing it in the slick film that will accept Yates' algae powder in an even coat.The press slams down.Anderson's teeth ache with the crush of weight.The kink spring wire snaps cleanly and then the severed filament is streaming through the curtains and into the fining room.Thirty seconds later it reemerges, pale gray and dusty with the algae derived powder.It threads into a new series of heated rollers before being tortured into its final structure, winding in on itself, torquing into a tighter and tighter curl, working against everything in its molecular structure as the spring is tightened down.A deafening shriek of tortured metal rises.Lubricants and algae residue shower from the sheathing as the spring is squeezed down, spattering workers and equipment, and then the compressed kink spring is being whisked away to be installed in its case and sent on to QA.A yellow LED flashes all clear.Workers dash out from their cages to reset the press as a new stream of rust colored metal hisses out of the bowels of the tempering rooms.Rollers chatter, running empty.Stoppered lubricant nozzles cast a fine mist into the air as they self cleanse before the next application.The workers finish aligning the presses then duck again behind their barriers.If the system breaks, the kink spring filament will become a high energy blade, whipping uncontrollably through the production room.Anderson has seen heads carved open like soft mangoes, the shorn parts of people and the Pollack spatter of blood that comes from industrial system failures   The press slams down, clipping another kink spring among the forty per hour that now, apparently, will have only a seventy five percent chance of ending up in a supervised disposal fill at the Environment Ministry.They're spending millions to produce trash that will cost millions more to destroy a double edged sword that just keeps cutting.Yates screwed something up, whether by accident or by spiteful sabotage, and it's taken more than a year to realize the depths of the problem, to examine the algae baths that breed the kink springs' revolutionary coatings, to rework the corn resins that enclose the springs' gear interfaces, to change the QA practices, to understand what a humidity level that hovers near 100% year round does to a manufacturing process conceptualized in drier climes.A burst of pale filtering dust kicks into the room as a worker stumbles through the curtains from the fining chamber.His dark face is a sweat streaked combination of grit and palm oil spray.The swinging curtains reveal a glimpse of his colleagues encased in pale dust clouds, shadows in a snowstorm as the kink spring filament is encased in the powder that keeps the springs from locking under intense compression.All that sweat, all those calories, all that carbon allotment all to present a believable cover for Anderson as he unravels the mystery of nightshades and ngaw.A rational company would shut down the factory.Even Anderson, with his limited understanding of the processes involved in this next generation kink spring manufacture would do so.But if his workers and the unions and the white shirts and the many listening ears of the Kingdom are to believe that he is an aspiring entrepreneur, the factory must run, and run hard.Anderson shakes Banyat's hand and congratulates him on his good work.It's a pity, really.The potential for success is there.When Anderson sees one of Yates' springs actually work, his breath catches.Yates was a madman, but he wasn't stupid.Anderson has watched joules pour out of tiny kink spring cases, ticking along contentedly for hours when other springs wouldn't have held a quarter of the energy at twice the weight, or would simply have constricted into a single molecularly bound mass under the enormous pressure of the joules being dumped into them.Sometimes, Anderson is almost seduced by the man's dream.Anderson takes a deep breath and ducks back through the fining room.He comes out on the other side in a cloud of algae powder and smoke.He sucks air redolent with trampled megodont dung and heads up the stairs to his offices.Behind him one of the megodonts shrieks again, the sound of a mistreated animal.Anderson turns, gazing down on the factory floor, and makes a note of the mahout.Number Four spindle.Another problem in the long list that SpringLife presents.He opens the door to the administrative offices.Inside, the rooms are much as they were when he first encountered them.Still dim, still cavernously empty with desks and treadle computers sitting silent in shadows.Thin blades of sunlight ease between teak window shutters, illuminating smoky offerings to whatever gods failed to save Tan Hock Seng's Chinese clan in Malaya.Sandalwood incense chokes the room, and more silken streamers rise from a shrine in the corner where smiling golden figures squat over dishes of U Tex rice and sticky fly covered mangoes.Hock Seng is already sitting at his computer.His bony leg ratchets steadily at the treadle, powering the microprocessors and the glow of the 12cm screen.In its gray light, Anderson catches the flicker of Hock Seng's eyes, the twitch of a man fearing bloody slaughter every time a door opens.The old man's flinch is as hallucinogenic as a cheshire's fade one moment there, the next gone and doubted but Anderson is familiar enough with yellow card refugees to recognize the suppressed terror.He shuts the door, muting the manufacturing roar, and the old man settles.Anderson coughs and waves at the swirling incense smoke."I thought I told you to quit burning this stuff. "Hock Seng shrugs, but doesn't stop treadling or typing."Shall I open the windows?"His whisper is like bamboo scraping over sand."Christ, no. "Anderson grimaces at the tropic blaze beyond the shutters."Just burn it at home.I don't want it here.Not any more. ""Yes.Of course. ""I mean it. "Hock Seng's eyes flick up for a moment before returning to his screen.The jut of his cheek bones and the hollows of his eyes show in sharp relief under the glow of the monitor.His spider fingers continue tapping at the keys."It's for luck," he murmurs.A low wheezing chuckle follows."Even foreign devils need luck.With all the factory troubles, I think maybe you would appreciate the help of Budai. ""Not here. "Anderson dumps his newly acquired ngaw on his desk and sprawls in his chair.Wipes his brow."Burn it at home. "Hock Seng inclines his head slightly in acknowledgment.Overhead, the rows of crank fans rotate lazily, bamboo blades panting against the office's swelter.The two of them sit marooned, surrounded by the map of Yates' grand design.Ranks of empty desks and workstations sit silent, the floor plan that should have held sales staff, shipping logistics clerks, HR people, and secretaries.Anderson sorts through the ngaw.Holds up one of his green haired discoveries for Hock Seng."Have you ever seen one of these before?"Hock Seng glances up."The Thai call them ngaw. "He returns to his work, treadling through spreadsheets that will never add and red ink that will never be reported."I know what the Thai call them. "Anderson gets up and crosses to the old man's desk.Hock Seng flinches as Anderson sets the ngaw beside his computer, eyeing the fruit as if it is a scorpion.Anderson says, "The farmers in the market could tell me the Thai name.Did you have them down in Malaya, too?""I " Hock Seng starts to speak, then stops.He visibly fights for self control, his face working through a flicker flash of emotions."I " Again, he breaks off.Anderson watches fear mold and re mold Hock Seng's features.Less than one percent of the Malayan Chinese escaped the Incident.By any measure, Hock Seng is a lucky man, but Anderson pities him.A simple question, a piece of fruit, and the old man looks as if he's about to flee the factory.Hock Seng stares at the ngaw, breath rasping.Finally he murmurs, "None in Malaya.Only Thais are clever with such things. "And then he is working again, eyes fixed on his little computer screen, memories locked away.Anderson waits to see if Hock Seng will reveal anything more but the old man doesn't raise his eyes again.The puzzle of the ngaw will have to wait.Anderson returns to his own desk and starts sifting through the mail.Receipts and tax papers that Hock Seng has prepared sit at one corner of his desk, demanding attention.He begins working through the stack, adding his signature to Megodont Union paychecks and the SpringLife chop to waste disposal approvals.He tugs at his shirt, fanning himself against the increasing heat and humidity.Eventually Hock Seng looks up."Banyat was looking for you. "Anderson nods, distracted by the forms."They found rust on the cutting press.The replacement improved reliability by five percent. ""Twenty five percent, then?"Anderson shrugs, flips more pages, adds his chop to an Environment Ministry carbon assessment."That's what he says. "He folds the document back into its envelope."Still not a profitable statistic.Your springs are all wind and no release.They keep joules the way the Somdet Chaopraya keeps the Child Queen. "Anderson makes a face of irritation but doesn't bother defending the erratic quality."Did Banyat also tell you about the nutrient tanks?"Hock Seng asks."For the algae?""No.Just the rust.Why?""They have been contaminated.Some of the algae is not producing the" Hock Seng hesitates."The skim.It is not productive. ""He didn't mention it to me. "Another slight hesitation.Then, "I'm sure he tried. ""Did he say how bad it was?"Hock Seng shrugs."Just that the skim does not meet specifications. "Anderson scowls."I'm firing him.I don't need a QA man who can't actually tell me the bad news. ""Perhaps you were not paying close attention. "Anderson has a number of words for people who try to raise a subject and then somehow fail, but he's interrupted by a scream from the megodont downstairs.The noise is loud enough to make the windows shake.Anderson pauses, listening for a follow up cry."That's the Number Four power spindle," he says."The mahout is incompetent. "Hock Seng doesn't look up from his typing."They are Thai.They are all incompetent. "Anderson stifles a laugh at the yellow card's assessment."Well, that one is worse. "He goes back to his mail."I want him replaced.Number Four spindle.Remember that. "Hock Seng's treadle loses its rhythm."This is a difficult thing, I think.Even the Dung Lord must bow before the Megodont Union.Without the labor of the megodonts, one must resort to the joules of men.Not a powerful bargaining position. ""I don't care.I want that one out.We can't afford a stampede.Find some polite way to get rid of him. "Anderson pulls over another stack of paychecks waiting for his signature.Hock Seng tries again."Khun, negotiating with the union is a complicated thing. ""That's why I have you.It's called delegating. "Anderson continues flipping the papers."Yes, of course. "Hock Seng regards him drily."Thank you for your management instruction. ""You keep telling me I don't understand the culture here," Anderson says."So take care of it.Get rid of that one.I don't care if you're polite or if everyone loses face, but find a way to axe him.It's dangerous to have someone like that in the power train. "Hock Seng's lips purse, but he doesn't protest any more.Anderson decides to assume that he will be obeyed.He flips through the pages of another permit letter from the Environment Ministry, grimacing.Only Thais would spend so much time making a bribe look like a service agreement.They're polite, even when they're shaking you down.Or when there's a problem with the algae tanks.Banyat  Anderson shuffles through the forms on his desk."Hock Seng?"The old man doesn't look up."I will take care of your mahout," he says as he keeps typing."It will be done, even if it costs you when they come to bargain again for bonuses. ""Nice to know, but that's not my question. "Anderson taps his desk."You said Banyat was complaining about the algae skim.Is he having problems with the new tanks?Or the old ones?""I He was unclear. ""Didn't you tell me we had replacement equipment coming off the anchor pads last week?New tanks, new nutrient cultures?"Hock Seng's typing falters for a moment.Anderson pretends puzzlement as he shuffles through his papers again, already knowing that the receipts and quarantine forms aren't present."I should have a list here somewhere.I'm sure you told me it was arriving. "He looks up."The more I think I about it, the more I think I shouldn't be hearing about any contamination problems.Not if our new equipment actually cleared Customs and got installed. "Hock Seng doesn't answer.Presses on with his typing as though he hasn't heard."Hock Seng?Is there something you forgot to tell me?"Hock Seng's eyes remain fixed on the gray glow of his monitor.Anderson waits.The rhythmic creak of the crank fans and the ratchet of Hock Seng's treadle fills the silence."There is no manifest," the old man says, finally."The shipment is still in Customs. ""It was supposed to clear last week. ""There are delays. ""You told me there wouldn't be any problem," Anderson says."You were certain.You told me you were expediting the Customs personally.I gave you extra cash to be sure of it. ""The Thai keep time in their own method.Perhaps it will be this afternoon.Perhaps tomorrow. "Hock Seng makes a face that resembles a grin."They are not like we Chinese.They are lazy. ""Did you actually pay the bribes?The Trade Ministry was supposed to get a cut, to pass on to their pet white shirt inspector. ""I paid them. ""Enough?"Hock Seng looks up, eyes narrowed."I paid. ""You didn't pay half and keep half for yourself?"Hock Seng laughs nervously."Of course I paid everything. "Anderson studies the yellow card a moment longer, trying to determine his honesty, then gives up and tosses down the papers.He isn't even sure why he cares, but it galls him that the old man thinks he can be fooled so easily.He glances again at the sack of ngaw.Perhaps Hock Seng senses just how secondary the factory is He forces the thought away and presses the old man again."Tomorrow then?"Hock Seng inclines his head."I think this is most likely. ""I'll look forward to it. "Hock Seng doesn't respond to the sarcasm.Anderson wonders if it even translates.The man speaks English with an extraordinary facility, but every so often they reach an impasse of language that seems more rooted in culture than vocabulary.Anderson returns to the paperwork.Tax forms here.Paychecks there.The workers cost twice as much as they should.Another problem of dealing with the Kingdom.Thai workers for Thai jobs.Yellow card refugees from Malaya are starving in the street, and he can't hire them.By rights, Hock Seng should be out in the job lines starving with all the other survivors of the Incident.Without his specialized skills in language and accountancy and Yates' indulgence, he would be starving.Anderson pauses on a new envelope.It's posted to him, personally, but true to form the seal is broken.Hock Seng has a hard time respecting the sanctity of other people's mail.They've discussed the problem repeatedly, but still the old man makes "mistakes. "Inside the envelope, Anderson finds a small invitation card.Raleigh, proposing a meeting.Anderson taps the invitation card against his desk, thoughtful.Raleigh.Flotsam of the old Expansion.An ancient piece of driftwood left at high tide, from the time when petroleum was cheap and men and women crossed the globe in hours instead of weeks.When the last of the jumbo jets rumbled off the flooded runways of Suvarnabhumi, Raleigh stood knee deep in rising seawater and watched them flee.He squatted with his girlfriends and then outlived them and then claimed new ones, forging a life of lemongrass and baht and fine opium.If his stories are to be believed, he has survived coups and counter coups, calorie plagues and starvation.These days, the old man squats like a liver spotted toad in his Ploenchit "club," smiling in self satisfaction as he instructs newly arrived foreigners in the lost arts of pre Contraction debauch.Anderson tosses the card on the desk.Whatever the old man's intentions, the invitation is innocuous enough.Raleigh hasn't lived this long in the Kingdom without developing a certain paranoia of his own.Anderson smiles slightly, glancing up at Hock Seng.The two would make a fine pair: two uprooted souls, two men far from their homelands, each of them surviving by their wits and paranoia  "If you are doing nothing other than watching me work," Hock Seng says, "the Megodont Union is requesting a renegotiation of their rates. "Anderson regards the expenses piled on his desk."I doubt they're so polite. "Hock Seng's pen pauses."The Thai are always polite.Even when they threaten. "The megodont on the floor below screams again.Anderson gives Hock Seng a significant look."I guess that gives you a bargaining chip when it comes to getting rid of the Number Four mahout.Hell, maybe I just won't pay them anything at all until they get rid of that bastard. ""The union is powerful. "Another scream shakes the factory, making Anderson flinch."And stupid!"He glances toward the observation windows."What the hell are they doing to that animal?"He motions at Hock Seng."Go check on them. "Hock Seng looks as if he will argue, but Anderson fixes him with a glare.The old man gets to his feet.A resounding trumpet of protest interrupts whatever complaint the old man is about to voice.The observation windows rattle violently."What the "  Another trumpeted wail shakes the building, followed by a mechanical shriek: the power train, seizing.Anderson lurches out of his chair and runs for the window but Hock Seng reaches it ahead of him.The old man stares through the glass, mouth agape.Yellow eyes the size of dinner plates rise level with the observation window.The megodont is up on its hind legs, swaying.The beast's four tusks have been sawn off for safety, but it is still a monster, fifteen feet at the shoulder, ten tons of muscle and rage, balanced on its hind legs.It pulls against the chains that bind it to the winding spindle.Its trunk lifts, exposing a cavernous maw.Anderson jams his hands over his ears.The megodont's scream hammers through the glass.Anderson collapses to his knees, stunned."Christ!"His ears are ringing."Where's that mahout?"Hock Seng shakes his head.Anderson isn't even sure the man has heard.Sounds in his own ears are muffled and distant.He staggers to the door and yanks it open just as the megodont crashes down on Spindle Four.The power spindle shatters.Teak shards spray in all directions.Anderson flinches as splinters fly past and his skin burns with needle slashes.Down below, the mahouts are frantically unchaining their beasts and dragging them away from the maddened animal, shouting encouragement, forcing their will on the elephantine creatures.The megodonts shake their heads and groan protest, tugging against their training, overwhelmed by the instinctual urge to aid their cousin.The rest of the Thai workers are fleeing for the safety of the street.The maddened megodont launches another attack on its winding spindle.Spokes shatter.The mahout who should have controlled the beast is a mash of blood and bone on the floor.Anderson ducks back into his office.He dodges around empty desks and jumps another, sliding over its surface to land before the company's safes.His fingers slip as he spins combination dials.Sweat drips in his eyes.23 right.106 left His hand moves to the next dial as he prays that he won't screw up the pattern and have to start again.More wood shatters out on the factory floor, accompanied by the screams of someone who got too close.Hock Seng appears at his elbow, crowding.Anderson waves the old man away."Tell the people to get out of here!Clear everyone out!I want everyone out!"Hock Seng nods but lingers as Anderson continues to struggle with the combinations.Anderson glares at him."Go!"Hock Seng ducks acquiescence and runs for the door, calling out, his voice lost in the screams of fleeing workers and shattering hardwoods.Anderson spins the last of the dials and yanks the safe open: papers, stacks of colorful money, eyes only records, a compression rifle a spring pistol.Yates.He grimaces.The old bastard seems to be everywhere today, as if his phii is riding on Anderson's shoulder.Anderson pumps the handgun's spring and stuffs it in his belt.He pulls out the compression rifle.Checks its load as another scream echoes behind.At least Yates prepared for this.The bastard was nave, but he wasn't stupid.Anderson pumps the rifle and strides for the door.Down on the manufacturing floor, blood splashes the drive systems and QA lines.It's difficult to see who has died.More than just the one mahout.The sweet stink of human offal permeates the air.Gut streamers decorate the megodont's circuit around its spindle.The animal rises again, a mountain of genetically engineered muscle, fighting against the last of its bonds.Anderson levels his rifle.At the edge of his vision, another megodont rises onto its hind legs, trumpeting sympathy.The mahouts are losing control.He forces himself to ignore the expanding mayhem and puts his eye to the scope.His rifle's crosshairs sweep across a rusty wall of wrinkled flesh.Magnified with the scope, the beast is so vast he can't miss.He switches the rifle to full automatic, exhales, and lets the gas chamber unleash.A haze of darts leaps from the rifle.Blaze orange dots pepper the megodont's skin, marking hits.Toxins concentrated from AgriGen research on wasp venom pump through the animal's body, gunning for its central nervous system.Anderson lowers the rifle.Without the scope's magnification, he can barely make out the scattered darts on the beast's skin.In another few moments it will be dead.The megodont wheels and fixes its attention on Anderson, eyes flickering with Pleistocene rage.Despite himself, Anderson is impressed by the animal's intelligence.It's almost as if the animal knows what he has done.The megodont gathers itself and heaves against its chains.Iron links crack and whistle through the air, smashing into conveyor lines.A fleeing worker collapses.Anderson drops his useless rifle and yanks out the spring gun.It's a toy against ten tons of enraged animal, but it's all he has left.The megodont charges and Anderson fires, pulling the trigger as quickly as his finger can convulse.Useless bladed disks spatter against the avalanche.The megodont slaps him off his feet with its trunk.The prehensile appendage coils around his legs like a python.Anderson scrabbles for a grip on the door jam, trying to kick free.The trunk squeezes.Blood rushes into his head.He wonders if the monster simply plans to pop him like some blood bloated mosquito, but then the beast is dragging him off the balcony.Anderson scrabbles for a last handhold as the railing slides past and then he's airborne.Flying free.The megodont's exultant trumpeting echoes as Anderson sails through the air.The factory floor rushes up.He slams into concrete.Blackness swallows him.Lie down and die.Anderson fights unconsciousness.Just die.He tries to get up, to roll away, to do anything at all, but he can't move.Colorful shapes fill his vision, trying to coalesce.The megodont is close.He can smell its breath.Color blotches converge.The megodont looms, rusty skin and ancient rage.It raises a foot to pulp him.Anderson rolls onto his side but can't get his legs to work.He can't even crawl.His hands scrabble against the concrete like spiders on ice.He can't move quickly enough.Oh Christ, I don't want to die like this.Not here.Not like this He's like a lizard with its tail caught.He can't get up, he can't get away, he's going to die, jelly under the foot of an oversized elephant.The megodont groans.Anderson looks over his shoulder.The beast has lowered its foot.It sways, drunken.It snuffles about with its trunk and then abruptly its hindquarters give out.The monster settles back on its haunches, looking ridiculously like a dog.Its expression is almost puzzled, a drugged surprise that its body no longer obeys.Slowly its forelegs sprawl before it and it sinks, groaning, into straw and dung.The megodont's eyes sink to Anderson 's level.They stare into his own, nearly human, blinking confusion.Its trunk stretches out for him again, slapping clumsily, a python of muscle and instinct, all uncoordinated now.Its maw hangs open, panting.Sweet furnace heat gusts over him.The trunk prods at him.Rocks him.Can't get a grip.Anderson slowly drags himself out of reach.He gets to his knees, then forces himself upright.He sways, dizzy, then manages to plant his feet and stand tall.One of the megodont's yellow eyes tracks his movement.The rage is gone.Long lashed eyelids blink.Anderson wonders what the animal is thinking.If the neural havoc tearing through its system is something it can feel.If it knows its end is imminent.Or if it just feels tired.Standing over it, Anderson can almost feel pity.The four ragged ovals where its tusks once stood are grimy foot diameter ivory patches, savagely sawed away.Sores glisten on its knees and scabis growths speckle its mouth.Close up and dying, with its muscles paralyzed and its ribs heaving in and out, it is just an ill used creature.The monster was never destined for fighting.The megodont lets out a final gust of breath.Its body sags.People are swarming all around Anderson, shouting, tugging at him, trying to help their wounded and find their dead.People are everywhere.Red and gold union colors, green SpringLife livery, the mahouts clambering over the giant corpse.For a second, Anderson imagines Yates standing beside him, smoking a nightshade and gloating at all the trouble."And you said you'd be gone in a month. "And then Hock Seng is beside him, whisper voice and black almond eyes and a bony hand that reaches up to touch his neck and comes away drenched red."You're bleeding," he murmurs.2  "Lift!"Hock Seng shouts.Pom and Nu and Kukrit and Kanda all lean against the shattered winding spindle, drawing it from its cradle like a splinter pulled from the flesh of a giant, dragging it up until they can send the girl Mai down underneath."I can't see!"she shouts.Pom and Nu's muscles flex as they try to keep the spindle from reseating itself.Hock Seng kneels and slides a shakelight down to the girl.Her fingers brush his and then the LED tool is gone, down into the darkness.The light is worth more than she is.He hopes they won't drop the spindle back into its seat while she's down there."Well?"he calls down a minute later."Is it cracked?"No answer comes from below.Hock Seng hopes she isn't caught, trapped somehow.He settles into a squat as he waits for her to finish her inspection.All around, the factory is a hive of activity as workers try to put the place back in order.Men swarm over the megodont's corpse, union workers with bright machetes and four foot bone saws, their hands red with their work as they render down a mountain of flesh.Blood runs off the beast as its hide is stripped away revealing marbled muscle.Hock Seng shudders at the sight, remembering his own people similarly disassembled, other bloodlettings, other factory wreckage.Good warehouses destroyed.Good people lost.It's all so reminiscent of when the Green Headbands came with their machetes and his warehouses burned.Jute and tamarind and kink springs all going up in fire and smoke.Slick machetes gleaming in the blaze.He turns his eyes away, forcing down memories.Forces himself to breathe.As soon as the Megodont Union heard one of their own was lost, they sent their professional butchers.Hock Seng tried to get them to drag the carcass outside and finish their work in the streets, to make room for the power train repairs, but the union people refused and so now in addition to the buzz of activity and cleanup, the factory is full of flies and the increasing reek of death.Bones protrude from the corpse like coral rising from an ocean of deep red meat.Blood runs from the animal, rivers of it, rushing toward the storm drains and Bangkok's coal driven flood control pumps.Hock Seng watches sourly as blood flows past.The beast held gallons of it.Untold calories rushing away.The butchers are fast, but it will take them most of the night to dismember the animal completely."Is she done yet?"Pom gasps.Hock Seng's attention returns to the problem at hand.Pom and Nu and their compatriots are all straining against the spindle's weight.Hock Seng again calls down into the hole."What do you see, Mai?"Her words are muffled."Come up, then!"He settles back on his haunches.Wipes sweat off his face.The factory is hotter than a rice pot.With all the megodonts led back to their stables, there is nothing to drive the factory's lines or charge the fans that circulate air through the building.Wet heat and death stench swaddle them like a blanket.They might as well be in the slaughter grounds of Khlong Toey.Hock Seng fights the urge to gag.A shout rises from the union butchers.They've cut open the megodont's belly.Intestines gush out.Offal gatherers the Dung Lord's people, all wade into the mass and begin shoveling it into handcarts, a lucky source of calories.With such a clean source, the offal will likely go to feed the pigs of the Dung Lord's perimeter farms, or stock the yellow card food lines feeding the Malayan Chinese refugees who live in the sweltering old Expansion towers under the Dung Lord's protection.Whatever pigs and yellow cards won't eat will be dumped into the methane composters of the city along with the daily fruit rind and dung collections, to bake steadily into compost and gas and eventually light the city streets with the green glow of approved burn methane.Hock Seng tugs at a lucky mole, thoughtful.A good monopoly, that.The Dung Lord's influence touches so many parts of the city, it's a wonder that he hasn't been made Prime Minister.Certainly, if he wanted it, the godfather of godfathers, the greatest jao por to ever influence the Kingdom could have anything he wanted.But will he want what I have to offer?Hock Seng wonders.Will he appreciate a good business opportunity?Mai's voice finally filters up from underneath, interrupting his ruminations."It's cracked!"she shouts.A moment later she claws her way out of the hole, dripping sweat and covered with dust.Nu and Pom and the rest release their hemp ropes.The spindle crashes back into its cradle and the floor shakes.Mai glances behind her at the noise.Hock Seng thinks he catches a glimpse of fear, the realization that the spindle could have truly crushed her.The look is gone as quickly as it came.A resilient child."Yes?"Hock Seng asks."Go on?Is it the core that has split?""Yes, Khun, I can slide my hand into the crack this far. "She shows him, touching her hand nearly at her wrist."And another on the far side, just the same. ""Tamade," Hock Seng curses.He's not surprised, but still."And the chain drive?"She shakes her head."The links I could see were bent. "He nods."Get Lin and Lek and Chuan "  "Chuan is dead. "She waves toward the smears where the megodont trampled two workers.Hock Seng grimaces."Yes of course. "Along with Noi and Kapiphon and unfortunate Banyat the QA man who will never now hear Mr.Anderson's irritation that he allowed line contamination in the algae baths.Another expense.A thousand baht to the dead workers' families and two thousand for Banyat.He grimaces again."Find someone else then, someone small from the cleaning gang like you.You will be going underground.Pom and Nu and Kukrit, get the spindle out.All the way out.We will need to inspect the main drive system, link by link.We cannot even consider starting again until it has been checked. ""What's the rush?"Pom laughs."It will be a long time before we run again.The farang will have to pay the union bags and bags of opium before they're willing to come back.Not after he gunned down Hapreet. ""When they do return, we won't have Number Four Spindle," Hock Seng snaps."It will take time to win an approval from the crown to cut another tree of this diameter, and then to float the log down from the North assuming the monsoon comes at all this year and all that time we will be running under constrained power.Think about that.Some of you will not be working at all. "He nods at the spindle."The ones who work hardest will be the ones who stay. "Pom smiles apologetically, hiding his anger, and wais."Khun, I was loose with my words.I meant no offense. ""Good then. "Hock Seng nods and turns away.He keeps his face sour, but privately, he agrees.It will take opium and bribes and a renegotiation of their power contract before the megodonts once again make their shuffling revolutions around the spindle cranks.Another red item for the balance sheets.And it doesn't even include the cost of the monks who will need to chant, or the Brahmin priests, or the feng shui experts, or the mediums who must consult with the phii so that workers will be placated and continue working in this bad luck factory   "Tan Xiansheng!"Hock Seng looks up from his calculations.Across the floor, the yang guizi Anderson Lakeis sitting on a bench beside the workers' lockers, a doctor tending his wounds.At first, the foreign devil wanted to have her sew him upstairs, but Hock Seng convinced him to do it down on the factory floor, in public, where the workers could see him, with his white tropical suit covered with blood like a phii out of a graveyard, but still alive at least.And unafraid.A lot of face to be gained from that.The foreigner is fearless.The man drinks from a bottle of Mekong whiskey that he sent Hock Seng out to buy as if Hock Seng was nothing more than a servant.Hock Seng sent Mai, who came back with a bottle of fake Mekong with an adequate label and enough change to spare that he tipped her a few baht extra for her cleverness, while looking into her eyes and saying, "Remember that I did this for you. "In a different life, he would have believed that he had bought a little loyalty when she nodded solemnly in response.In this life, he only hopes that she will not immediately try to kill him if the Thais suddenly turn on his kind and decide to send the yellow card Chinese all fleeing into the blister rusted jungle.Perhaps he has bought himself a little time.Or not.As he approaches, Doctor Chan calls out in Mandarin, "Your foreign devil is a stubborn one.Always moving around. "She's a yellow card, like him.Another refugee forbidden from feeding herself except by wits and clever machinations.If the white shirts discovered she was taking rice from a Thai doctor's bowl He stifles the thought.It's worth it to help someone from the homeland, even if it is only for a day.An atonement of sorts for all that has gone before."Please try to keep him alive. "Hock Seng smiles slightly."We still need him to sign our pay stubs. "She laughs."Ting mafan.I'm rusty with a needle and thread, but for you, I'd bring this ugly creature back from the dead. ""If you're that good, I'll call for you when I catch cibiscosis. "The yang guizi interjects in English, "What's she complaining about?"Hock Seng eyes him."You move about too much. ""She's damn clumsy.Tell her to hurry up. ""She also says you are very very lucky.Another centimeter difference and the splinter cuts your artery.Then your blood is on the floor with all the rest. "Surprisingly, Mr.Lake smiles at this news.His eyes go to the mountain of meat being rendered down."A splinter.And I thought it was the megodont that was going to get me. ""Yes.You nearly died," Hock Seng says.And that would have been disastrous.If Mr.Lake's investors were to lose heart and give up the factory Hock Seng grimaces.It is so much harder to influence this yang guizi than Mr.Yates, and yet this stubborn foreign devil must be kept alive, if only so that the factory will not close.It's an irritating realization, that he was once so close to Mr.Yates, and now so far from Mr.Lake.Bad luck and a stubborn yang guizi, and now he must come up with a new plan to cement his long term survival and the revival of his clan."You should celebrate your survival, I think," Hock Seng suggests."Make offerings toKuan Yin and Budai for your very good luck. "Mr.Lake grins, his pale blue eyes on Hock Seng.Twin watery devil pools."You're damn right I will. "He holds up the bottle of fake Mekong, already half gone."I'll be celebrating all night long. ""Perhaps you would like me to arrange a companion?"The foreign devil's face turns to stone.He looks at Hock Seng with something akin to disgust."That's not your business. "Hock Seng curses himself, even as he keeps his face immobile.He has apparently pushed too far, and now the creature is angry again.He makes a quick wai of apology."Of course.I do not mean to insult you. "The yang guizi looks out across the factory floor.The pleasure of the moment seems drained from him "How bad is the damage?"Hock Seng shrugs."You are right about the spindle core.It is cracked. ""And the main chain?""We will inspect every link.If we are lucky, it will only be the sub train that is affected. ""Not likely. "The foreign devil offers him the whiskey bottle.Hock Seng tries to hide his revulsion as he shakes his head.Mr.Lake grins knowingly and takes another pull.Wipes his lips on the back of his arm.A new shout rises from the union's butchers as more blood gushes from the megodont.Its head lies at an angle now, half severed from the rest of the body.More and more, the carcass is taking on the appearance of separated parts.Not an animal at all, more a child's play set for building a megodont from the ground up.Hock Seng wonders if there is a way to force the union to cut him in on the profits they get from selling the untainted meat.It seems unlikely, given how quickly they staked out their space, but perhaps when their power contract is renegotiated, or when they demand their reparations."Will you take the head?"Hock Seng asks."You can make a trophy of it. ""No. "The yang guizi looks offended.Hock Seng forces himself not to grimace.It's maddening to work with the creature.The devil's moods are mercurial, and always aggressive.Like a child.One moment joyful, the next petulant.Hock Seng forces down his irritation; Mr.Lake is what he is.His karma has made him a foreign devil, and Hock Seng's karma has brought them together.It's no use complaining about the quality of U Tex when you are starving.Mr.Lake seems to catch Hock Seng's expression and explains himself."This wasn't a hunt.It was just an extermination.As soon as I hit it with the darts, it was dead.There's no sport in that. ""Ah.Of course.Very honorable. "Hock Seng stifles his disappointment.With the foreign devil demanding the head, he could have replaced the stumpy tusk remainders with coconut oil composites and sold the ivory to the doctors near Wat Boworniwet.Now, even that money will be gone.A waste.Hock Seng considers explaining the situation to Mr.Lake, explaining the value of meat and calories and ivory lying before them, then decides against it.The foreign devil would not understand, and the man is too easy to anger as it is."The cheshires are here," Mr.Lake comments.Hock Seng looks to where the yang guizi indicates.At the periphery of the bloodletting, shimmering feline shapes have appeared; twists of shadow and light summoned by the carrion scent.The yang guizi makes a face of distaste, but Hock Seng has a measure of respect for the devil cats.They are clever, thriving in places where they are despised.Almost supernatural in their tenacity.Sometimes it seems that they smell blood before it is even spilled.As if they can peer a little way into the future and know precisely where their next meal will appear.The feline shimmers stealth toward the sticky pools of blood.A butcher kicks one away, but there are too many to really fight, and his attack is desultory.Mr.Lake takes another pull of whiskey."We'll never get them out. ""There are children who will hunt them," Hock Seng says."A bounty is not expensive. "The yang guizi makes a face of dismissal."We have bounties back in the Midwest, too. "Our children are more motivated than yours.But Hock Seng doesn't contest the foreigner's words.He'll put out the bounty, regardless.If the cats are allowed to stay, the workers will start rumors that Phii Oun the cheshire trickster spirit has caused the calamity.The devil cats flicker closer.Calico and ginger, black as night all of them fading in and out of view as their bodies take on the colors of their surroundings.They shade red as they dip into the blood pool.Hock Seng has heard that cheshires were supposedly created by a calorie executive some PurCal or AgriGen man, most likely for a daughter's birthday.A party favor for when the little princess turned as old as Lewis Carroll's Alice.The child guests took their new pets home where they mated with natural felines, and within twenty years, the devil cats were on every continent and Felis domesticus was gone from the face of the world, replaced by a genetic string that bred true ninety eight percent of the time.The Green Headbands in Malaya hated Chinese people and cheshires equally, but as far as Hock Seng knows, the devil cats still thrive there.The yang guizi flinches as Doctor Chan sticks him again and he gives her a dirty look."Finish up," he says to her."Now. "She wais carefully, hiding her fear."He moved again," she whispers to Hock Seng."The anesthetic is not good.Not as good as what I am used to. ""Don't worry. "Hock Seng replies."That's why I gave him the whiskey.Finish your work.I will deal with him. "To Lake Xiansheng he says, "She is almost finished. "The foreigner makes a face but doesn't threaten her anymore, and at last the doctor completes her sewing.Hock Seng takes her aside and hands her an envelope with her payment.She wais her thanks but Hock Seng shakes his head."There is a bonus in it.I wish you to deliver a letter as well. "He hands her another envelope."I would like to speak with the boss of your tower. ""Dog Fucker?"She makes a face of distaste."If he heard you call him that, he'd destroy whatever is left of your family. ""He's a hard one. ""Just deliver the note.That will be enough. "Doubtfully, she takes the envelope."You've been good to our family.All the neighbors also speak of your kindness.Make offerings to your loss. ""What I do is too little. "Hock Seng forces a smile."Anyway, we Chinese must stick together.Perhaps in Malaya we were still Hokkien, or Hakka or Fifth Wave, but here we are all yellow cards.I am embarrassed I cannot do more. ""It is more than anyone else. "She wais to him, emulating the manners of their new culture, and departs.Mr.Lake watches her go."She's a yellow card, isn't she?"Hock Seng nods."Yes.A doctor in Malacca.Before the Incident. "The man is quiet, seeming to digest this information."Was she cheaper than a Thai doctor?"Hock Seng glances at the yang guizi, trying to decide what he wants to hear.Finally he says, "Yes.Much cheaper.Just as good.Maybe better.But much cheaper.They do not allow us to take Thai niches here.So she has very little work except for yellow cards who of course have too little to pay.She is happy for the work. "Mr.Lake nods thoughtfully and Hock Seng wonders what he is thinking.The man is an enigma.Sometimes, Hock Seng thinks yang guizi are too stupid to have possibly taken over the world once, let alone twice.That they succeeded in the Expansion and then even after the energy collapse beat them back to their own shores that they returned again, with their calorie companies and their plagues and their patented grains They seem protected by the supernatural.By rights, Mr.Lake should be dead, a bit of human offal mingled with the bodies of Banyat and Noi and the nameless stupid Number Four Spindle megodont handler who caused the beast to panic in the first place.And yet here the foreign devil sits, complaining about the tiny prick of a needle, but completely unconcerned that he has destroyed a ten ton animal in the blink of an eye.The yang guizi are strange creatures indeed.More alien than he suspected, even when he traded with them regularly."The mahout will have to be paid off again.Bribed to come back to work," Hock Seng observes."Yes. ""And we will have to hire monks to chant for the factory.To make the workers happy again.Phii must be placated. "Hock Seng pauses."It will be expensive.People will say that your factory has bad spirits in it.That it is sited wrong, or that the spirit house is not large enough.Or that you cut down a phii's tree when it was built.We will have to bring a fortune teller, perhaps a feng shui master to get them to believe the place is good.And then the mahout will demand hazard pay "  Mr.Lake interrupts."I want to replace the mahout," he says."All of them. "Hock Seng sucks air through his teeth."It is impossible.The Megodont Union controls all of the city's power contracts.It is a government mandate.The white shirts award the power monopoly.There is nothing we can do about the unions. ""They're incompetent.I don't want them here.Not anymore. "Hock Seng tries to tell if the farang is joking.He smiles hesitantly."It is Royal Mandate.One might as well wish to replace the Environment Ministry. ""There's a thought. "Mr.Lake laughs."I could team up with Carlyle & Sons and start complaining every day about taxes and carbon credit laws.Get Trade Minister Akkarat to take up our cause. "His gaze rests on Hock Seng."But that's not the way you like to operate, is it?"His eyes become abruptly cold."You like the shadows and the bargaining.The quiet deal. "Hock Seng swallows.The foreign devil's pale skin and blue eyes are truly horrific.As alien as a devil cat, and just as comfortable in a hostile land."It would be unwise to enrage the white shirts. "Hock Seng murmurs."The nail that stands up will be pounded down. ""That's yellow card talk. ""As you say.But I am alive when others are dead, and the Environment Ministry is very powerful.General Pracha and his white shirts have survived every challenge.Even the December 12 attempt.If you wish to poke at a cobra, be ready for its bite. "Mr.Lake looks as if he will argue, but instead shrugs."I'm sure you know best. ""It is why you pay me. "The yang guizi stares at the dead megodont."That animal shouldn't have been able to break out of its harness. "He takes another drink from his bottle."The safety chains were rusted; I checked.We aren't going to pay a cent of reparations.That's final.That's my bottom line.If they had secured their animal, I wouldn't have had to kill it. "Hock Seng inclines his head in tacit agreement, though he will not speak it out loud."Khun, there is no other option. "Mr.Lake smiles coldly."Yes, of course.They're a monopoly. "He makes a face."Yates was a fool to locate here. "Hock Seng experiences a chill of anxiety.The yang guizi suddenlylooks like a petulant child.Children are rash.Children do things to anger the white shirts or the unions.And sometimes they pick up their toys and run away home.A disturbing thought indeed.Anderson Lake and his investors must not run away.Not yet."What are our losses, to date?"Mr.Lake asks.Hock Seng hesitates, then steels himself to deliver bad news."With the loss of the megodont, and now the cost of placating the unions?Ninety million baht, perhaps?"A shout comes from Mai, waving Hock Seng over.He doesn't have to look to know it is bad news.He says, "There will be damage below as well, I think.Expensive to repair. "He pauses, touches the delicate subject."Your investors, the Misters Gregg and Yee, will have to be notified.It is likely that we do not have the cash to do repairs and also to install and calibrate the new algae baths when they arrive. "He pauses."We will require new funds. "He waits anxiously, wondering what the yang guizi's reaction will be.Money flows through the company so quickly sometimes Hock Seng thinks of it as water, and yet he knows this will not be pleasant news.The investors sometimes become balky at expenses.With Mr.Yates, the fights over money were common.With Mr.Lake, less so.The investors do not complain so much now that Mr.Lake has arrived, yet it is still a fantastic amount of money to spend on a dream.If Hock Seng ran the company, he would have shut it down more than a year ago.But Mr.Lake doesn't blink at the news.All he says is, "More money. "He turns to Hock Seng."And when will the algae tanks and nutrient cultures clear Customs?"he asks."When, really?"Hock Seng blanches."It is difficult.Parting the bamboo curtain is not something done in a day.The Environment Ministry likes to interfere. ""You said you paid to keep the white shirts off our backs. ""Yes. "Hock Seng inclines his head."All the appropriate gifts have been given. ""So why was Banyat complaining about contaminated baths?If we've got live organisms breeding "  Hock Seng hurries to interrupt."Everything is at the anchor pads.Delivered by Carlyle & Sons last week" He makes a decision.The yang guizi needs to hear good news."Tomorrow the shipment will clear Customs.The bamboo curtain will part, and your shipment will arrive on the backs of megodonts. "He makes himself smile."Unless you wish to fire the Union right now?"The devil shakes his head, even smiles a little at the joke, and Hock Seng feels a flush of relief."Tomorrow then.For certain?"Mr.Lake asks.Hock Seng steels himself and inclines his head in agreement, willing it to be the truth.Still the foreigner holds him with his blue eyes."We spend a lot of money here.But the one thing the investors can't tolerate is incompetence.I won't tolerate it, either. ""I understand. "Mr.Lake nods, satisfied."Good then.We'll wait to talk with the home office.After we've got the new line equipment out of Customs, we'll call.Give them some good news with the bad.I don't want to ask for money with nothing to show at all. "He looks at Hock Seng again."We wouldn't want that, would we?"Hock Seng makes himself nod."As you say. "Mr.Lake takes another drink from his bottle."Good.Find out how bad the damage is.I'll want a report in the morning. "With this dismissal, Hock Seng heads across the factory floor to the waiting spindle crew.He hopes that he is right about the shipment.That it will be truly released.That he will be proven right by events.It is a gamble, but not a bad one.And the devil would not have wanted to hear too much bad news at once, in any case.When Hock Seng arrives at the winding spindle, Mai is dusting herself off from another foray into the hole."How does it look?"Hock Seng asks.The winding spindle is fully disengaged from the line.Now drawn forth, it lies on the ground, a massive spike of teak.The cracks are large and obvious.He calls down the hole."A lot of damage?"A minute later, Pom crawls out covered in grease."Those tunnels are tight. "he gasps."I can't fit down some of them. "He wipes the sweat and grime with an arm."It's the sub train for certain, and we won't know about the rest until we send children down along the links.If the main chain is damaged, we'll have to pull up the floor. "Hock Seng peers into the revealed spindle hole with a grimace, flashing back to tunnels and rats and cowering survival in the jungles of the south."We'll have Mai find some of her friends. "He surveys the damage again.He owned buildings like this, once.Whole warehouses filled with goods.And now look what he is, a factotum for yang guizi.An old man with a body that's falling apart and a clan that has been filed down to his single head.He sighs and forces down frustration."I want to know everything about how bad the damage is, before I talk to the farang again.No surprises. "Pom wais."Yes, Khun. "Hock Seng turns for the offices, limping slightly for the first few steps before forcing himself not to favor the leg.With all the activity, his knee aches, a reminder of an encounter of his own with the monsters that drive the factory.He can't help stopping at the top of the steps to study the megodont carcass, the places where the workers died.Memories scratch and peck at him, swirling like black crows, hungry to take over his head.So many friends dead.So much family gone.Four years ago, he was a big name.Now?Nothing.He pushes through the door.The offices are silent.Empty desks, expensive treadle computers, the treadmill and its tiny communications screen, the company's massive safes.As he scans the room, religious fanatics in green headbands leap from the shadows, machetes whirling, but they are only memories.He closes the door behind him, shutting out the sounds of butchery and repair.Forces himself not to go to the window and look down again on the blood and carcass.Not to dwell on memories of blood running down the gutters of Malacca, of Chinese heads stacked like durians for sale.This is not Malaya, he reminds himself.You are safe.Still, the images are there.As bright as photographs and spring festival fireworks.Even with the Incident four years in the past, he must perform calming rituals.When the feeling is bad, almost any object reminds him of menace.He closes his eyes, forces himself to breathe deeply, to remember the blue ocean and his clipper fleets white upon the waves He takes another deep breath and opens his eyes.The room is safe again.Nothing but empty desks set in careful rows and dusty treadle computers.Shutters blocking out the blaze of tropic sunlight.Dust motes and incense.Across the room, deep in shadows, the twinned vaults of SpringLife's safes gleam dully, iron and steel, squatting there, taunting him.Hock Seng has keys to one, the petty cash safe.But the other, the great safe, only Mr.Lake can open.So close, he thinks.The blueprints are there.Just inches away.He has seen them laid out.The DNA samples of the genehacked algae, their genome maps on solid state data cubes.The specifications for growing and processing the resulting skim into lubricants and powder.The necessary tempering requirements for the kink spring filament to accept the new coatings.A next generation of energy storage sits within his grasp.And with it, a hope of resurrection for himself and his clan.Yates mumbled and drank and Hock Seng filled his baijiu glass and listened to his rambles and encouraged his trust and dependence for more than a year.And it was all a waste.Now it comes down to this safe that he cannot open because Yates was foolish enough to raise the investors' ire, and too incompetent to bring his dream to fruition.There are new empires waiting to be built, if only Hock Seng can reach the documents.All he has are incomplete copies from when they used to sit in the open, splashed across Yates' desk, before the drunken fool bought the cursed office safe.Now there is a key and a combination, and a wall of iron between him and the blueprints.A good safe.Hock Seng is familiar with its sort.Benefited from its security when he too was a big name and had files he needed to protect.It is irritating perhaps more irritating than anything else that the foreign devils use the same brand of safe as he used for his own trading empire in Malaya: YingTie.A Chinese tool, twisted to foreign purposes.He has spent days staring at that safe.Meditating on the knowledge that it contains   Hock Seng cocks his head, suddenly thoughtful.Did you close it, Mr.Lake?In all the excitement, did you forget perhaps to lock it closed once again?Hock Seng's heart beats faster.Did you lapse?Mr.Yates sometimes did.Hock Seng tries to control growing excitement.He limps across to the safe.Stands before it.A shrine, an object of worship.A monolith of forged steel, impervious to everything except patience and diamond drills.Every day he sits across from it, feels it mocking him.Could it be as simple as this?Is it possible that in the rush of disaster that Mr.Lake simply forgot to close it?Hock Seng reaches out hesitantly and puts his hand on the lever.He holds his breath.Prays to his ancestors, prays to the elephant headed Phra Kanet, the Thai people's remover of obstacles, to every god he knows.He leans on the handle.One thousand jin of steel push back, every molecule resisting his pressure.Hock Seng lets out his breath and steps back, forcing down his disappointment.Patience.Every safe has a key.If Mr.Yates had not been so incompetent, if he had not somehow angered the investors, he would have been the perfect key.Now it must be Mr.Lake instead.When Mr.Yates installed the safe, he joked that he had to keep the family jewels safe, and laughed.Hock Seng had made himself nod and wai and smile, but all he could think about was how valuable the blueprints were, and how stupid he had been not to copy faster, when they had been easily available.And now Yates is gone, and in his place a new devil.A devil truly.Blue eyed and gold haired and hard edged where Yates was soft.This dangerous creature who double checks everything Hock Seng does and makes everything so much harder, and who must somehow be convinced to give up the secrets of his company.Hock Seng purses his lips.Patience.You must be patient.Eventually the foreign devil will make a mistake."Hock Seng!"Hock Seng goes to the door and waves down to Mr.Lake, acknowledging the summons, but instead of going downstairs immediately, he goes to his shrine.He prostrates himself before the image of Kuan Yin and begs that she will have mercy on him and his ancestors.That she will give him a chance to redeem himself and his family.Beneath the golden character for good fortune, suspended upside down so that it will gush down upon him, Hock Seng places U Tex rice and cuts open a blood orange.The juice runs down his arm; a ripe one, clean of contamination, and expensive.One cannot cut too close to the bone with gods; they like the fat, not the lean.He lights incense.As smoke streams into the still air, filling the office once again, Hock Seng prays.He prays that the factory will not close, and that his bribes will bring the new line equipment through the bamboo curtain without difficulty.That the foreign devil Mr.Lake will lose his head and trust him too much, and that the cursed safe will open and reveal its secrets to him.Hock Seng prays for luck.Even an old Chinese yellow card needs luck.3  Emiko sips whiskey, wishing she were drunk, and waits for the signal from Kannika that it is time for her humiliation.A part of her still struggles against it but the rest of her the part that sits with her midriff baring mini jacket and tight pha sin skirt and a glass of whiskey in her hand doesn't have the energy to fight.And then she wonders if she has it backwards, if the part that struggles to maintain her illusions of self respect is the part intent upon her destruction.If her body, this collection of cells and manipulated DNA with its own stronger, more practical needs is actually the survivor: the one with will.Isn't that why she sits here, listening to the throb of beating sticks and the wail of pi klang as girls writhe under glow worms and men and whores shout their encouragement?Is it because she lacks the will to die?Or because she is too stubborn to allow it?Raleigh says that all things come in cycles, like the rise and fall of the tides along the beaches of Koh Samet, or the rise and fall of a man's prick when he has a pretty girl.Raleigh slaps his girls on their bare bottoms and laughs at the jokes of the new wave gaijin and tells Emiko that whatever they want to do with her, money is money, and nothing is new under the sun.And perhaps he is right.Nothing that Raleigh demands has not been demanded before.Nothing that Kannika conceives to hurt her and make her cry out is truly different.Except that she draws cries and moans from a windup girl.This, at least, is novelty.Look!She is almost human!Gendo sama used to say that she was more than human.He used to stroke her black hair after they had made love and say that he thought it a pity New People were not more respected, and really it was too bad her movements would never be smooth.But still, did she not have perfect eyesight and perfect skin and disease  and cancer resistant genes, and who was she to complain?At least her hair would never turn gray, and she would never age as quickly as he, even with his surgeries and pills and ointments and herbs that kept him young.He had stroked her hair and said, "You are beautiful, even if you are New People.Do not be ashamed. "And Emiko had snuggled into his embrace."No.I am not ashamed. "But that had been in Kyoto, where New People were common, where they served well, and were sometimes well respected.Not human, certainly, but also not the threat that the people of this savage basic culture make her out to be.Certainly not the devils that the Grahamites warn against at their pulpits, or the soulless creatures imagined out of hell that the forest monk Buddhists claim; not a creature unable to ever achieve a soul or a place in the cycles of rebirth and striving for Nirvana.Not the affront to the Q'ran that the Green Headbands believe.The Japanese were practical.An old population needed young workers in all their varieties, and if they came from test tubes and grew in crches, this was no sin.The Japanese were practical.And isn't that why you sit here?Because the Japanese are so very practical?Though you look like one, though you speak their tongue, though Kyoto is the only home you knew, you were not Japanese.Emiko puts her head in her hands.She wonders if she will find a date, or if she will be left alone at the end of the night, and then wonders if she knows which she prefers.Raleigh says there is nothing new under the sun, but tonight, when Emiko pointed out that she was New People, and there had never been New People before, Raleigh laughed, and said she was right and special and who knows, maybe that meant anything was possible.And then he slapped her bottom and told her to get up on stage and show how special she was going to be tonight.Emiko traces her fingers through the wetness of bar rings.Warm beers sit and sweat wet slick rings, as slick as girls and men, as slick as her skin when she oils it to shine, to be soft like butter when a man touches her.As soft as skin can be, and perhaps more so, because even if her physical movements are all stutter stop flash bulb strange, her skin is more than perfect.Even with her augmented vision she barely spies the pores of her flesh.So small.So delicate.So optimal.But made for Nippon and a rich man's climate control, not for here.Here, she is too hot and sweats too little.She wonders if she were a different kind of animal, some mindless furry cheshire, say, if she would feel cooler.Not because her pores would be larger and more efficient and her skin not so painfully impermeable, but simply because she wouldn't have to think.She wouldn't have to know that she had been trapped in this suffocating perfect skin by some irritating scientist with his test tubes and DNA confetti mixes who made her flesh so so smooth, and her insides too too hot.Kannika grabs her by the hair.Emiko gasps at the sudden attack.She searches for help but none of the other patrons are interested in her.They are watching the girls on stage.Emiko's peers are servicing the guests, plying them with Khmer whiskey and pressing their bottoms to their laps and running their hands over the men's chests.And anyway, they have no love for her.Even the good hearted ones the ones with jai dee, who somehow manage to care for a windup like herself will not step in.Raleigh is talking with another gaijin, smiling and laughing with the man, but his ancient eyes are on Emiko, watching for what she will do.Kannika yanks her hair again."Bai!"Emiko obeys, climbing down from her bar stool and tottering in her windup way toward the circle stage.The men all laugh and point at the Japanese windup and her broken unnatural steps.A freak of nature transplanted from her native habitat, trained from birth to duck her head and bow.Emiko tries to distance herself from what is about to happen.She is trained to be clinical about such things.The crche in which she was created and trained had no illusions about the many uses a New Person might be put to, even a refined one.New People serve and do not question.She moves toward the stage with the careful steps of a fine courtesan, stylized and deliberate movements, refined over decades to accommodate her genetic heritage, to emphasize her beauty and her difference.But it is wasted on the crowd.All they see are stutter stop motions.A joke.An alien toy.A windup.They have her strip off her clothes.Kannika flicks water onto her oiled skin.Emiko glistens with water jewels.Her nipples harden.The glow worms twist and writhe overhead, sending out phosphorescent mating light.The men laugh at her.Kannika slaps her hip and makes her bow.Slaps her ass hard enough to burn, tells her to bow lower, to make obeisance to these small men who imagine themselves to be the vanguard of some new Expansion.The men laugh and wave and point and order more whiskey.Raleigh grins from his place in the corner, the fond elder uncle, happy to teach these newcomers these small corporate men and women high on fantasies of multinational profiteering the ways of the old world.Kannika motions that Emiko should kneel.A black bearded gaijin with the deep tan of a clipper ship sailor watches from inches away.Emiko meets the man's eyes.He stares intently, as if he is examining an insect under a magnifying class: fascinated, and yet also repulsed.She has the urge to snap at him, to try to force him to look at her, to see her instead of simply evaluating her as a piece of genetic trash.But instead she bows and knocks her head against the teak stage in subservience while Kannika speaks in Thai and tells them Emiko's life story.That she was once a rich Japanese plaything.That she is theirs now: a toy for them to play with, to break even.And then she grabs Emiko's hair and yanks her up.Emiko gasps as her body arches.She catches a glimpse of the bearded man staring in surprise at the sudden violent gesture, at her abasement.A flash of the crowd.The ceiling with its glow worm cages.Kannika drags her further back, bending her like willow, forcing her to thrust her breasts out to the crowd, to arch further still, to spread her thighs as she struggles not to topple sideways.Her head touches the teak of the stage.Her body forms a perfect arc.Kannika says something and the crowd laughs.The pain in Emiko's back and neck is extreme.She can feel the crowd's eyes on her, a physical thing, molesting her.She is utterly exposed.Liquid gushes over her.She tries to rise, but Kannika presses her down and dumps more beer in her face.Emiko gags and splutters, drowning.Finally Kannika releases her and Emiko jerks upright, coughing.Liquid foams down her chin, spills down her neck and breasts, trickles to her crotch.Everyone is laughing.Saeng is already offering the bearded man a fresh beer, and he is grinning and tipping Saeng and everyone is laughing at how Emiko's body twitches and jerks now that she is in a panic, coughing the liquid from her lungs.She is nothing but a silly marionette creature now, all stutter stop motion herky jerky heechy keechy with no trace of the stylized grace that her mistress Mizumi sensei trained into her when she was a girl in the crche.There is no elegance or care to her movements now; the telltales of her DNA are violently present for all to see and mock.Emiko continues coughing, almost retching at the beer in her lungs.Her limbs twitch and flail, giving everyone a chance to see her true nature.Finally she gets a full breath.Controls her flailing movements.She reverts to stillness, kneeling, waiting for the next assault.In Japan she was a wonder.Here, she is nothing but a windup.The men laugh at her strange gait and make faces of disgust that she exists at all.She is a creature forbidden to them.The Thai men would happily mulch her in their methane composting pools.If they met her or an AgriGen calorie man, it is hard to say which they would rather see mulched first.And then there are the gaijin.She wonders how many of them claim membership in the Grahamite Church, dedicated to destroying everything that she represents: her affront to niche and nature.And yet they sit contentedly and enjoy this humiliation of her even still.Kannika grabs her again.She has disrobed now and has a jadeite cock in her hands.She shoves Emiko down, pushing her onto her back."Hold her hands," she says, and the men reach out eagerly, grip her wrists.Kannika pries her legs wide and then Emiko cries out as Kannika takes her.Emiko turns her face aside, waiting out the assault, but Kannika sees her avoidance.She pinches Emiko's face in one hand and forces her to show her features so that the men can see the effect of Kannika's ministrations.The men urge Kannika on.Begin to chant.Count in Thai.Neung!Song!Sam!Si!Kannika indulges them with a building rhythm.The men sweat and watch and shout for more for the price of their admission.More men are holding her down, hands on her ankles and wrists, freeing Kannika for her abuse.Emiko writhes, her body shaking and jerking, twitching in the ways that windups do, in the ways that Kannika excels at bringing out.The men laugh and comment on the freakish movements, the stutter stop motions, flash bulb strange.Kannika's fingers join the jade between Emiko's legs, play at Emiko's core.Emiko's shame builds.Again she tries to turn her face aside.Men are gathered around, close, staring.More crowd behind, straining for a glimpse.Emiko moans.Kannika laughs, low and knowing.She says something to the men and increases her tempo.Her fingers play in Emiko's folds.Emiko moans again as her body betrays her.She cries out.Arches.Her body performs just as it was designed just as the scientists with their test tubes intended.She cannot control it no matter how much she despises it.The scientists will not allow her even this small disobedience.She comes.The audience roars approval, laughing at the bizarre convulsions that orgasm wrings from her DNA.Kannika gestures at her movements as if to say, "You see?Look at this animal!"and then she is kneeling above Emiko's face and hissing to Emiko that she is nothing, and will always be nothing, and for once the dirty Japanese get what is coming to them.Emiko wants to tell her that no self respecting Japanese would do these things.Wants to tell her that all Kannika plays with is a disposable Japanese toy a triviality of Japanese ingenuity, like Matsushita's disposable cellulose handlegrips for a cycle rickshaw but she has said it before and it only makes things worse.If she remains silent the abuse will end soon.Even if she is New People, there is nothing new under the sun.* * *   Yellow card coolies crank at wide bore fans, driving air through the club.Sweat drips from their faces and runs in gleaming rivulets down their backs.
