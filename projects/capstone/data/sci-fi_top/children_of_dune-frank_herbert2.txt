"Including the supreme command?""Without the supreme command there is seldom a reason for an army, Tyekanik.That is why you will immediately embrace this Mahdi religion and, at the same time, begin the campaign to convert my son. ""At once, Princess.I presume you don't want me to stint his education in the other martial arts at the expense of this, ahh, religion?"She pushed herself out of the chair, strode around him, paused at the door, and spoke without looking back."Someday you will try my patience once too often, Tyekanik.

"She paused to see how Ghanima was taking this.They sat alone, just the two of them, occupying low cushions in a chamber of Sietch Tabr.It had required considerable skill to maneuver this meeting, and Jessica was not at all certain that she had been alone in the maneuvering.Ghanima had seemed to anticipate and augment every step.It was almost two hours after daylight, and the excitements of greeting and all of the recognitions were past.Jessica forced her pulse back to a steady pace and focused her attention into this rock walled room with its dark hangings and yellow cushions.To meet the accumulated tensions, she found herself for the first time in years recalling the Litany Against Fear from the Bene Gesserit rite."I must not fear.Fear is the mind killer.Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration.I will face my fear.I will permit it to pass over me and through me.And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.Only I will remain.  "She did this silently and took a deep, calming breath."It helps at times," Ghanima said."The Litany, I mean. "Jessica closed her eyes to hide the shock of this insight.It had been a long time since anyone had been able to read her that intimately.The realization was disconcerting, especially when it was ignited by an intellect which hid behind a mask of childhood.Having faced her fear, though, Jessica opened her eyes and knew the source of turmoil: I fear for my grandchildren.Neither of these children betrayed the stigmata of Abomination which Alia flaunted, although Leto showed every sign of some terrifying concealment.It was for that reason he'd been deftly excluded from this meeting.On impulse, Jessica put aside her ingrained emotional masks, knowing them to be of little use here, barriers to communication.Not since those loving moments with her Duke had she lowered these barriers, and she found the action both relief and pain.There remained facts which no curse or prayer or litany could wash from existence.Flight would not leave such facts behind.They could not be ignored.Elements of Paul's vision had been rearranged and the times had caught up with his children.They were a magnet in the void; evil and all the sad misuses of power collected around them.Ghanima, watching the play of emotions across her grandmother's face, marveled that Jessica had let down her controls.With catching movements of their heads remarkably synchronized, both turned, eyes met, and they stared deeply, probingly at each other.Thoughts without spoken words passed between them.Jessica: I wish you to see my fear.Ghanima: Now I know you love me.It was a swift moment of utter trust.Jessica said: "When your father was but a boy, I brought a Reverend Mother to Caladan to test him. "Ghanima nodded.The memory of it was extremely vivid."We Bene Gesserits were already cautious to make sure that the children we raised were human and not animal.One cannot always tell by exterior appearances. ""It's the way you were trained," Ghanima said, and the memory flooded into her mind: that old Bene Gesserit, Gaius Helen Mohiam.She'd come to Castle Caladan with her poisoned gom jabbar and her box of burning pain.Paul's hand (Ghanima's own hand in the shared memory) screamed with the agony of that box while the old woman talked calmly of immediate death if the hand were withdrawn from the pain.And there had been no doubt of the death in that needle held ready against the child's neck while the aged voice droned its rationale:  "You've heard of animals chewing off a leg to escape a trap.There's an animal kind of trick.A human would remain in the trap, endure the pain, feigning death that he might kill the trapper and remove a threat to his kind. "Ghanima shook her head against the remembered pain.The burning!The burning!Paul had imagined his skin curling black on that agonized hand within the box, flesh crisping and dropping away until only charred bones remained.And it had been a trick   the hand unharmed.But sweat stood out on Ghanima's forehead at the memory."Of course you remember this in a way that I cannot," Jessica said.For a moment, memory driven, Ghanima saw her grandmother in a different light: what this woman might do out of the driving necessities of that early conditioning in the Bene Gesserit schools!It raised new questions about Jessica's return to Arrakis."It would be stupid to repeat such a test on you or your brother," Jessica said."You already know the way it went.I must assume you are human, that you will not misuse your inherited powers. ""But you don't make that assumption at all," Ghanima said.Jessica blinked, realized that the barriers had been creeping back in place, dropped them once more.She asked: "Will you believe my love for you?""Yes. "Ghanima raised a hand as Jessica started to speak."But that love wouldn't stop you from destroying us.Oh, I know the reasoning: 'Better the animal human die than it re create itself. 'And that's especially true if the animal human bears the name Atreides. ""You at least are human," Jessica blurted."I trust my instinct on this. "Ghanima saw the truth in this, said: "But you're not sure of Leto. ""I'm not. ""Abomination?"Jessica could only nod.Ghanima said: "Not yet, at least.We both know the danger of it, though.We can see the way of it in Alia. "Jessica cupped her hands over her eyes, thought: Even love can't protect us from unwanted facts.And she knew then that she still loved her daughter, crying out silently against fate: Alia!Oh, Alia!I am sorry for my part in your destruction.Ghanima cleared her throat loudly.Jessica lowered her hands, thought: I may mourn my poor daughter, but there are other necessities now.She said: "So you've recognized what happened to Alia. ""Leto and I watched it happen.We were powerless to prevent it, although we discussed many possibilities. ""You're sure that your brother is free of this curse?""I'm sure. "The quiet assurance in that statement could not be denied.Jessica found herself accepting it.Then: "How is it you've escaped?"Ghanima explained the theory upon which she and Leto had settled, that their avoiding of the spice trance while Alia entered it often made the difference.She went on to reveal his dreams and the plans they'd discussed   even Jacurutu.Jessica nodded."Alia is an Atreides, though, and that poses enormous problems. "Ghanima fell silent before the sudden realization that Jessica still mourned her Duke as though his death had been but yesterday, that she would guard his name and memory against all threats.Personal memories from the Duke's own lifetime fled through Ghanima's awareness to reinforce this assessment, to soften it with understanding."Now," Jessica said, voice brisk, "what about this Preacher?I heard some disquieting reports yesterday after that damnable Lustration. "Ghanima shrugged."He could be  "  "Paul?""Yes, but we haven't seen him to examine. ""Javid laughs at the rumors," Jessica said.Ghanima hesitated.Then: "Do you trust this Javid?"A grim smile touched Jessica's lips."No more than you do. ""Leto says Javid laughs at the wrong things," Ghanima said."So much for Javid's laughter," Jessica said."But do you actually entertain the notion that my son is still alive, that he has returned in this guise?""We say it's possible.And Leto... "Ghanima found her mouth suddenly dry, remembered fears clutching her breast.She forced herself to overcome them, recounted Leto's other revelations of prescient dreams.Jessica moved her head from side to side as though wounded.Ghanima said: "Leto says he must find this Preacher and make sure. ""Yes...Of course.I should never have left here.It was cowardly of me. ""Why do you blame yourself?You had reached a limit.I know that.Leto knows it.Even Alia may know it. "Jessica put a hand to her own throat, rubbed it briefly.Then: "Yes, the problem of Alia. ""She works a strange attraction on Leto," Ghanima said."That's why I helped you meet alone with me.He agrees that she is beyond hope, but still he finds ways to be with her and...study her.And...it's very disturbing.When I try to talk against this, he falls asleep.He  "  "Is she drugging him?""No o o. "Ghanima shook her head."But he has this odd empathy for her.And...in his sleep, he often mutters Jacurutu. ""That again!"And Jessica found herself recounting Gurney's report about the conspirators exposed at the landing field."I sometimes fear Alia wants Leto to seek out Jacurutu," Ghanima said."And I always thought it only a legend.You know it, of course. "Jessica shuddered."Terrible story.Terrible. ""What must we do?"Ghanima asked."I fear to search all of my memories, all of my lives... ""Ghani!I warn you against that.You mustn't risk  "  "It may happen even if I don't risk it.How do we know what really happened to Alia?""No!You could be spared that...that possession. "She ground the word out."Well...Jacurutu, is it?I've sent Gurney to find the place   if it exists. ""But how can he...Oh!Of course: the smugglers. "Jessica found herself silenced by this further example of how Ghanima's mind worked in concert with what must be an inner awareness of others.Of me!How truly strange it was, Jessica thought, that this young flesh could carry all of Paul's memories, at least until the moment of Paul's spermal separation from his own past.It was an invasion of privacy against which something primal in Jessica rebelled.Momentarily she felt herself sinking into the absolute and unswerving Bene Gesserit judgment: Abomination!But there was a sweetness about this child, a willingness to sacrifice for her brother, which could not be denied.We are one life reaching out into a dark future, Jessica thought.We are one blood.And she girded herself to accept the events which she and Gurney Halleck had set in motion.Leto must be separated from his sister, must be trained as the Sisterhood insisted.= = = = = =   I hear the wind blowing across the desert and I see the moons of a winter night rising tike great ships in the void.To them I make my vow: I will be resolute and make an art of government; I will balance my inherited past and become a perfect storehouse of my relic memories.And I will be known for kindliness more than for knowledge.My face will shine down the corridors of time for as long as humans exist.Leto's Vow, After Harq al Ada   When she had been quite young, Alia Atreides had practiced for hours in the prana bindu trance, trying to strengthen her own private personality against the onslaught of all those others.She knew the problem   melange could not be escaped in a sietch warren.It infested everything: food, water, air, even the fabrics against which she cried at night.Very early she recognized the uses of the sietch orgy where the tribe drank the death water of a worm.In the orgy, Fremen released the accumulated pressures of their own genetic memories, and they denied those memories.She saw her companions being temporarily possessed in the orgy.For her, there was no such release, no denial.She had possessed full consciousness long before birth.With that consciousness came a cataclysmic awareness of her circumstances: womb locked into intense, inescapable contact with the personas of all her ancestors and of those identities death transmitted in spice tau to the Lady Jessica.Before birth, Alia had contained every bit of the knowledge required in a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother   plus much, much more from all those others.In that knowledge lay recognition of a terrible reality   Abomination.The totality of that knowledge weakened her.The pre born did not escape.Still she'd fought against the more terrifying of her ancestors, winning for a time a Pyrrhic victory which had lasted through childhood.She'd known a private personality, but it had no immunity against casual intrusions from those who lived their reflected lives through her.Thus will I be one day, she thought.This thought chilled her.To walk and dissemble through the life of a child from her own loins, intruding, grasping at consciousness to add a quantum of experience.Fear stalked her childhood.It persisted into puberty.She had fought it, never asking for help.Who would understand the help she required?Not her mother, who could never quite drive away that specter of Bene Gesserit judgment: the pre born were Abomination.There had come that night when her brother walked alone into the desert seeking death, giving himself to Shai Hulud as blind Fremen were supposed to do.Within the month, Alia had been married to Paul's swordmaster, Duncan Idaho, a mentat brought back from the dead by the arts of the Tleilaxu.Her mother fled back to Caladan.Paul's twins were Alia's legal charge.And she controlled the Regency.Pressures of responsibility had driven the old fears away and she had been wide open to the inner lives, demanding their advice, plunging into spice trance in search of guiding visions.The crisis came on a day like many others in the spring month of Laab, a clear morning at Muad'Dib's Keep with a cold wind blowing down from the pole.Alia still wore the yellow for mourning, the color of the sterile sun.More and more these past few weeks she'd been denying the inner voice of her mother, who tended to sneer at preparation for the coming Holy Days to be centered on the Temple.The inner awareness of Jessica faded, faded...sinking away at last with a faceless demand that Alia would be better occupied working on the Atreides Law.New lives began to clamor for their moment of consciousness.Alia felt that she had opened a bottomless pit, and faces arose out of it like a swarm of locusts, until she came at last to focus on one who was like a beast: the old Baron Harkonnen.In terrified outrage she had screamed out against all of that inner clamor, winning a temporary silence.On this morning, Alia took her pre breakfast walk through the Keep's roof garden.In a new attempt to win the inner battle, she tried to hold her entire awareness within Choda's admonition to the Zensunni:  "Leaving the ladder, one may fall upward!"But morning's glow along the cliffs of the Shield Wall kept distracting her.Plantings of resilient fuzz grass filled the garden's pathways.When she looked away from the Shield Wall she saw dew on the grass, the catch of all the moisture which had passed here in the night.It reflected her own passage as of a multitude.That multitude made her giddy.Each reflection carried the imprint of a face from the inner multitude.She tried to focus her mind on what the grass implied.The presence of plentiful dew told her how far the ecological transformation had progressed on Arrakis.The climate of these northern latitudes was growing warmer; atmospheric carbon dioxide was on the increase.She reminded herself how many new hectares would be put under green plants in the coming year   and it required thirty seven thousand cubic feet of water to irrigate just one hectare.Despite every attempt at mundane thoughts, she could not drive away the sharklike circling of all those others within her.She put her hands to her forehead and pressed.Her temple guards had brought her a prisoner to judge at sunset the previous day: one Essas Paymon, a dark little man ostensibly in the pay of a house minor, the Nebiros, who traded in holy artifacts and small manufactured items for decoration.Actually Paymon was known to be a CHOAM spy whose task was to assess the yearly spice crop.Alia had been on the point of sending him into the dungeons when he'd protested loudly "the injustice of the Atreides. "That could have brought him an immediate sentence of death on the hanging tripod, but Alia had been caught by his boldness.She'd spoken sternly from her Throne of Judgment, trying to frighten him into revealing more than he'd already told her inquisitors."Why are our spice crops of such interest to the Combine Honnete?"she demanded."Tell us and we may spare you. ""I only collect something for which there is a market," Paymon said."I know nothing of what is done with my harvest. ""And for this petty profit you interfere with our royal plans?"Alia demanded."Royalty never considers that we might have plans, too," he countered.Alia, captivated by his desperate audacity, said: "Essas Paymon, will you work for me?"At this a grin whitened his dark face, and he said; "You were about to obliterate me without a qualm.What is my new value that you should suddenly make a market for it?""You've a simple and practical value," she said."You're bold and you're for hire to the highest bidder.I can bid higher than any other in the Empire. "At which, he named a remarkable sum which he required for his services, but Alia laughed and countered with a figure she considered more reasonable and undoubtedly far more than he'd ever before received.She added: "And, of course, I throw in the gift of your life upon which, I presume, you place an even more inordinate value. ""A bargain!"Paymon cried and, at a signal from Alia, was led away by her priestly Master of Appointments, Ziarenko Javid.Less than an hour later, as Alia prepared to leave the Judgment Hall, Javid came hurrying to report that Paymon had been overheard to mutter the fateful lines from the Orange Catholic Bible: "Maleficos non patieris vivere.  ""Thou shall not suffer a witch to live," Alia translated.So that was his gratitude!He was one of those who plotted against her very life!In a flush of rage such as she'd never before experienced, she ordered Pay men's immediate execution, sending his body to the Temple deathstill where his water, at least, would be of some value in the priestly coffers.And all night long Paymon's dark face haunted her.She tried all of her tricks against this persistent, accusing image, reciting the Bu Ji from the Fremen Book of Kreos: "Nothing occurs!Nothing occurs!"But Paymon took her through a wearing night into this giddy new day, where she could see that his face had joined those in the jeweled reflections from the dew.A female guard called her to breakfast from the roof door behind a low hedge of mimosa.Alia sighed.She felt small choice between hells: the outcry within her mind or the outcry from her attendants   all were pointless voices, but persistent in their demands, hourglass noises that she would like to silence with the edge of a knife.Ignoring the guard, Alia stared across the roof garden toward the Shield Wall.A bahada had left its broad outwash like a detrital fan upon the sheltered floor of her domain.The delta of sand spread out before her gaze, outlined by the morning sun.It came to her that an uninitiated eye might see that broad fan as evidence of a river's flow, but it was no more than the place where her brother had shattered the Shield Wall with the Atreides Family atomics, opening a path from the desert for the sandworms which had carried his Fremen troops to shocking victory over his Imperial predecessor, Shaddam IV.Now a broad qanat flowed with water on the Shield Wall's far side to block off sandworm intrusions.Sandworms would not cross open water; it poisoned them.Would that I had such a barrier within my mind, she thought.The thought increased her giddy sensation of being separated from reality.Sandworms!Sandworms!Her memory presented a collection of sandworm images: mighty Shai Hulud, the demiurge of the Fremen, deadly beast of the desert's depths whose outpourings included the priceless spice.How odd it was, this sandworm, to grow from a flat and leathery sandtrout, she thought.They were like the flocking multitude within her awareness.The sandtrout, when linked edge to edge against the planet's bedrock, formed living cisterns; they held back the water that their sandworm vector might live.Alia could feel the analogy: some of those others within her mind held back dangerous forces which could destroy her.Again the guard called her to breakfast, a note of impatience apparent.Angrily Alia turned, waved a dismissal signal.The guard obeyed, but the roof door slammed.At the sound of the slamming door, Alia felt herself caught by everything she had attempted to deny.The other lives welled up within her like a hideous tide.Each demanding life pressed its face against her vision centers   a cloud of faces.Some presented mange spotted skin, other were callous and full of sooty shadows; there were mouths like moist lozenges.The pressure of the swarm washed over her in a current which demanded that she float free and plunge into them."No," she whispered."No...no...no... "She would have collapsed onto the path but for a bench beside her which accepted her sagging body.She tried to sit, could not, stretched out on the cold plasteel, still whispering denial.The tide continued to rise within her.She felt attuned to the slightest show of attention, aware of the risk, but alert for every exclamation from those guarded mouths which clamored within her.They were a cacophony of demand for her attention: "Me!Me!""No, me!"And she knew that if she once gave her attention, gave it completely, she would be lost.To behold one face out of the multitude and follow the voice of that face would be to be held by the egocentrism which shared her existence."Prescience does this to you," a voice whispered.She covered her ears with her hands, thinking: I'm not prescient!The trance doesn't work for me!But the voice persisted: "It might work, if you had help. ""No...no," she whispered.Other voices wove around her mind: "I, Agamemnon, your ancestor, demand audience!""No...no."She pressed her hands against her ears until the flesh answered her with pain.An insane cackle within her head asked: "What has become of Ovid?Simple.He's John Bartlett's ibid!"The names were meaningless in her extremity.She wanted to scream against them and against all the other voices but could not find her own voice.Her guard, sent back to the roof by senior attendants, peered once more from the doorway behind the mimosa, saw Alia on the bench, spoke to a companion: "Ahhh, she is resting.You noted that she didn't sleep well last night.It is good for her to take the zaha, the morning siesta. "Alia did not hear her guard.Her awareness was caught by shrieks of singing: "Merry old birds are we, hurrah!"the voices echoed against the inside of her skull and she thought: I'm going insane.I'm losing my mind.Her feet made feeble fleeing motions against the bench.She felt that if she could only command her body to run, she might escape.She had to escape lest any part of that inner tide sweep her into silence, forever contaminating her soul.But her body would not obey.The mightiest forces in the Imperial universe would obey her slightest whim, but her body would not.An inner voice chuckled.Then: "From one viewpoint, child, each incident of creation represents a catastrophe. "It was a basso voice which rumbled against her eyes, and again that chuckle as though deriding its own pontification."My dear child, I will help you, but you must help me in return. "Against the swelling background clamor behind that basso voice, Alia spoke through chattering teeth: "Who...who... "A face formed itself upon her awareness.It was a smiling face of such fatness that it could have been a baby's except for the glittering eagerness of the eyes.She tried to pull back, but achieved only a longer view which included the body attached to that face.The body was grossly, immensely fat, clothed in a robe which revealed by subtle bulges beneath it that this fat had required the support of portable suspensors."You see," the basso voice rumbled, "it is only your maternal grandfather.You know me.I was the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. ""You're...you're dead!"she gasped."But, of course, my dear!Most of us within you are dead.But none of the others are really willing to help you.They don't understand you. ""Go away," she pleaded."Oh, please go away. ""But you need help, granddaughter," the Baron's voice argued.How remarkable he looks, she thought, watching the projection of the Baron against her closed eyelids."I'm willing to help you," the Baron wheedled."The others in here would only fight to take over your entire consciousness.Any one of them would try to drive you out.But me...I want only a little corner of my own. "Again the other lives within her lifted their clamor.The tide once more threatened to engulf her and she heard her mother's voice screeching.And Alia thought: She's not dead."Shut up!"the Baron commanded.Alia felt her own desires reinforcing that command, making it felt throughout her awareness.Inner silence washed through her like a cool bath and she felt her hammering heart begin slowing to its normal pace.Soothingly the Baron's voice intruded: "You see?Together, we're invincible.You help me and I help you. ""What...what do you want?"she whispered.A pensive look came over the fat face against her closed eyelids."Ahhh, my darling granddaughter," he said, "I wish only a few simple pleasures.Give me but an occasional moment of contact with your senses.No one else need ever know.Let me feel but a small corner of your life when, for example, you are enfolded in the arms of your lover.Is that not a small price to ask?""Y yes. ""Good, good," the Baron chortled."In return, my darling granddaughter, I can serve you in many ways.I can advise you, help you with my counsel.You will be invincible within and without.You will sweep away all opposition.History will forget your brother and cherish you.The future will be yours. ""You...won't let...the...the others take over?""They cannot stand against us!Singly we can be overcome, but together we command.I will demonstrate.Listen. "And the Baron fell silent, withdrawing his image, his inner presence.Not one memory, face, or voice of the other lives intruded.Alia allowed herself a trembling sigh.Accompanying that sigh came a thought.It forced itself into her awareness as though it were her own, but she sensed silent voices behind it.The old Baron was evil.He murdered your father.He would've killed you and Paul.He tried to and failed.The Baron's voice came to her without a face: "Of course I would've killed you.Didn't you stand in my way?But that argument is ended.You've won it, child!You're the new truth. "She felt herself nodding and her cheek moved scratchingly against the harsh surface of the bench.His words were reasonable, she thought.A Bene Gesserit precept reinforced the reasonable character of his words: "The purpose of argument is to change the nature of truth. "Yes...that was the way the Bene Gesserit would have it."Precisely!"the Baron said."And I am dead while you are alive.I have only a fragile existence.I'm a mere memory self within you.I am yours to command.And how little I ask in return for the profound advice which is mine to deliver. ""What do you advise me to do now?"she asked, testing."You're worried about the judgment you gave last night," he said."You wonder if Paymon's words were reported truthfully.Perhaps Javid saw in this Paymon a threat to his position of trust.Is this not the doubt which assails you?""Y yes. ""And your doubt is based on acute observation, is it not?Javid behaves with increasing intimacy toward your person.Even Duncan has noted it, hasn't he?""You know he has. ""Very well, then.Take Javid for your lover and  "  "No!""You worry about Duncan?But your husband is a mentat mystic.He cannot be touched or harmed by activities of the flesh.Have you not felt sometimes how distant he is from you?""B but he... ""Duncan's mentat part would understand should he ever have need to know the device you employed in destroying Javid. ""Destroy... ""Certainly!Dangerous tools may be used, but they should be cast aside when they grow too dangerous. ""Then...why should...I mean... ""Ahhh, you precious dunce!Because of the value contained in the lesson. ""I don't understand. ""Values, my dear grandchild, depend for their acceptance upon their success.Javid's obedience must be unconditional, his acceptance of your authority absolute, and his  "  "The morality of this lesson escapes  "  "Don't be dense, grandchild!Morality must always be based on practicality.Render unto Caesar and all that nonsense.A victory is useless unless it reflects your deepest wishes.Is it not true that you have admired Javid's manliness?"Alia swallowed, hating the admission, but forced to it by her complete nakedness before the inner watcher."Ye es. ""Good!"How jovial the word sounded within her head."Now we begin to understand each other.When you have him helpless, then, in your bed, convinced that you are his thrall, you will ask him about Paymon.Do it jokingly: a rich laugh between you.And when he admits the deception, you will slip a crysknife between his ribs.Ahhh, the flow of blood can add so much to your satis  "  "No," she whispered, her mouth dry with horror."No...no...no... ""Then I will do it for you," the Baron argued."It must be done; you admit that.If you but set up the conditions, I will assume temporary sway over... ""No!""Your fear is so transparent, granddaughter.My sway of your senses cannot be else but temporary.There are others, now, who could mimic you to a perfection that...But you know this.With me, ahhh, people would spy out my presence immediately.You know the Fremen Law for those possessed.You'd be slain out of hand.Yes   even you.And you know I do not want that to happen.I'll take care of Javid for you and, once it's done, I'll step aside.You need only... ""How is this good advice?""It rids you of a dangerous tool.And, child, it sets up the working relationship between us, a relationship which can only teach you well about future judgments which  "  "Teach me?""Naturally!"Alia put her hands over her eyes, trying to think, knowing that any thought might be known to this presence within her, that a thought might originate with that presence and be taken as her own."You worry yourself needlessly," the Baron wheedled."This Paymon fellow, now, was  "  "What I did was wrong!I was tired and acted hastily.I should've sought confirmation of  "  "You did right!Your judgments cannot be based on any such foolish abstract as that Atreides notion of equality.That's what kept you sleepless, not Paymon's death.You made a good decision!He was another dangerous tool.You acted to maintain order in your society.Now there's a good reason for judgments, not this justice nonsense!There's no such thing as equal justice anywhere.It's unsettling to a society when you try to achieve such a false balance. "Alia felt pleasure at this defense of her judgment against Paymon, but shocked at the amoral concept behind the argument."Equal justice was an Atreides...was...  "She took her hands from her eyes, but kept her eyes closed."All of your priestly judges should be admonished about this error," the Baron argued."Decisions must be weighed only as to their merit in maintaining an orderly society.Past civilizations without number have foundered on the rocks of equal justice.Such foolishness destroys the natural hierarchies which are far more important.Any individual takes on significance only in his relationship to your total society.Unless that society be ordered in logical steps, no one can find a place in it   not the lowliest or the highest.Come, come, grandchild!You must be the stern mother of your people.It's your duty to maintain order. ""Everything Paul did was to... ""Your brother's dead, a failure!""So are you!""True...but with me it was an accident beyond my designing.Come now, let us take care of this Javid as I have outlined for you. "She felt her body grow warm at the thought, spoke quickly: "I must think about it. "And she thought: If it's done, it'll be only to put Javid in his place.No need to kill him for that.And the fool might just give himself away...in my bed."To whom do you talk, My Lady?"a voice asked.For a confused moment, Alia thought this another intrusion by those clamorous multitudes within, but recognition of the voice opened her eyes.Ziarenka Valefor, chief of Alia's guardian amazons, stood beside the bench, a worried frown on her weathered Fremen features."I speak to my inner voices," Alia said, sitting up on the bench.She felt refreshed, buoyed up by the silencing of that distracting inner clamor."Your inner voices, My Lady.Yes. "Ziarenka's eyes glistened at this information.Everyone knew the Holy Alia drew upon inner resources available to no other person."Bring Javid to my quarters," Alia said."There's a serious matter I must discuss with him. ""To your quarters, My Lady?""Yes!To my private chamber. ""As My Lady commands. "The guard turned to obey."One moment," Alia said."Has Master Idaho already gone to Sietch Tabr?""Yes, My Lady.He left before dawn as you instructed.Do you wish me to send for... ""No.I will manage this myself.And Zia, no one must know that Javid is being brought to me.Do it yourself.This is a very serious matter. "The guard touched the crysknife at her waist."My Lady, is there a threat to  "  "Yes, there's a threat, and Javid may be at the heart of it. ""Ohhh, My Lady, perhaps I should not bring  "  "Zia!Do you think me incapable of handling such a one?"A lupine smile touched the guard's mouth."Forgive me, My Lady.I will bring him to your private chamber at once, but...with My Lady's permission, I will mount guard outside your door. ""You only," Alia said."Yes, My Lady.I go at once. "Alia nodded to herself, watching Ziarenka's retreating back.Javid was not loved among her guards, then.Another mark against him.But he was still valuable   very valuable.He was her key to Jacurutu and with that place, well..."Perhaps you were right, Baron," she whispered."You see!"the voice within her chortled."Ahhh, this will be a pleasant service to you, child, and it's only the beginning...

"Muriz cleared his throat, stared once at each of the six captives.They sat in a loose semicircle across from him, tightly restrained with spice fiber ropes which held their legs crossed, their hands behind them.The bindings terminated in a tight noose at each man's throat.Their stillsuits had been cut away at the neck.The bound men stared back at Muriz without flinching.Two of them wore loose off world garments which marked them as wealthy residents of an Arrakeen city.These two had skin which was smoother, lighter than that of their companions, whose sere features and bony frames marked them as desert born.Muriz resembled the desert dwellers, but his eyes were more deeply sunken, whiteless pits which not even the glow of the spicelamp touched.His son appeared an unformed copy of the man, with a flatness of face which did not quite hide the turmoil boiling within him."Among the Cast Out we have a special test for manhood," Muriz said."One day my son will be a judge in Shuloch.We must know that he can act as he must.Our judges cannot forget Jacurutu and our day of despair.Kralizec, the Typhoon Struggle, lives in our hearts. "It was all spoken with the flat intonation of ritual.One of the soft featured city dwellers across from Muriz stirred, said: "You do wrong to threaten us and bind us captive.We came peacefully on umma. "Muriz nodded."You came in search of a personal religious awakening?Good.You shall have that awakening. "The soft featured man said: "If we  "  Beside him a darker desert Fremen snapped: "Be silent, fool!These are the water stealers.These are the ones we thought we'd wiped out. ""That old story," the soft featured captive said."Jacurutu is more than a story," Muriz said.Once more he gestured to his son."I have presented Assan Tariq.I am arifa in this place, your only judge.My son, too, will be trained to detect demons.The old ways are best. ""That's why we came into the deep desert," the soft featured man protested."We chose the old way, wandering in  "  "With paid guides," Muriz said, gesturing to the darker captives."You would buy your way into heaven?"Muriz glanced up at his son."Assan, are you prepared?""I have reflected long upon that night when men came and murdered our people," Assan said.His voice projected an uneasy straining."They owe us water. ""Your father gives you six of them," Muriz said."Their water is ours.Their shades are yours, your guardians forevermore.Their shades will warn you of demons.They will be your slaves when you cross over into the alam al mythal.What do you say, my son?""I thank my father," Assan said.He took a short step forward."I accept manhood among the Cast Out.This water is our water. "As he finished speaking, the youth crossed to the captives.Starting on the left, he gripped the man's hair and drove the crysknife up under the chin into the brain.It was skillfully done to spill the minimum blood.Only the one soft featured city Fremen protested, squalling as the youth grabbed his hair.The others spat at Assan Tariq in the old way, saying by this: "See how little I value my water when it is taken by animals!"When it was done, Muriz clapped his hands once.Attendants came and began removing the bodies, taking them to the deathstill where they could be rendered for their water.Muriz arose, looked at his son who stood breathing deeply, watching the attendants remove the bodies."Now you are a man," Muriz said."The water of our enemies will feed slaves.And, my son... "Assan Tariq turned an alert and pouncing look upon his father.The youth's lips were drawn back in a tight smile."The Preacher must not know of this," Muriz said."I understand, father. ""You did it well," Muriz said."Those who stumble upon Shuloch must not survive. ""As you say, father. ""You are trusted with important duties," Muriz said."I am proud of you. "= = = = = =   A sophisticated human can become primitive.What this really means is that the human's way of life changes.Old values change, become linked to the landscape with its plants and animals.This new existence requires a working knowledge of those multiplex and cross linked events usually referred to as nature.It requires a measure of respect for the inertial power within such natural systems.When a human gains this working knowledge and respect, that is called "being primitive. "The converse, of course, is equally true: the primitive can become sophisticated, but not without accepting dreadful psychological damage.The Leto Commentary, After Harq al Ada   "How can we be sure?"Ghanima asked."This is very dangerous. ""We've tested it before," Leto argued."It may not be the same this time.What if  "  "It's the only way open to us," Leto said."You agree we can't go the way of the spice. "Ghanima sighed.She did not like this thrust and parry of words, but knew the necessity which pressed her brother.She also knew the fearful source of her own reluctance.They had but to look at Alia and know the perils of that inner world."Well?"Leto asked.Again she sighed.They sat cross legged in one of their private places, a narrow opening from the cave to the cliff where often their mother and father had watched the sun set over the bled.It was two hours past the evening meal, a time when the twins were expected to exercise their bodies and their minds.They had chosen to flex their minds."I will try it alone if you refuse to help," Leto said.Ghanima looked away from him toward the black hangings of the moisture seals which guarded this opening in the rock.Leto continued to stare out over the desert.They had been speaking for some time in a language so ancient that even its name remained unknown in these times.The language gave their thoughts a privacy which no other human could penetrate.Even Alia, who avoided the intricacies of her inner world, lacked the mental linkages which would allow her to grasp any more than an occasional word.Leto inhaled deeply, taking in the distinctive furry odor of a Fremen cavern sietch which persisted in this windless alcove.The murmurous hubbub of the sietch and its damp heat were absent here, and both felt this as a relief."I agree we need guidance," Ghanima said."But if we  "  "Ghani!We need more than guidance.We need protection. ""Perhaps there is no protection. "She looked directly at her brother, met that gaze in his eyes like the waiting watchfulness of a predator.His eyes belied the placidity of his features."We must escape possession," Leto said.He used the special infinitive of the ancient language, a form strictly neutral in voice and tense but profoundly active in its implications.Ghanima correctly interpreted his argument."Mohw'pwium d'mi hish pash moh'm ka," she intoned.The capture of my soul is the capture of a thousand souls."Much more than that," he countered."Knowing the dangers, you persist. "She made it a statement, not a question."Wabun 'k wabunat!"he said.Rising, thou risest!He felt his choice as an obvious necessity.Doing this thing, it were best done actively.They must wind the past into the present and allow it to unreel into their future."Muriyat," she conceded, her voice low.It must be done lovingly."Of course. "He waved a hand to encompass total acceptance."Then we will consult as our parents did. "Ghanima remained silent, tried to swallow past a lump in her throat.Instinctively she glanced south toward the great open erg which was showing a dim grey pattern of dunes in the last of the day's light.In that direction her father had gone on his last walk into the desert.Leto stared downward over the cliff edge at the green of the sietch oasis.All was dusk down there, but he knew its shapes and colors: blossoms of copper, gold, red, yellow, rust, and russet spread right out to the rock markers which outlined the extent of the qanat watered plantings.Beyond the rock markers stretched a stinking band of dead Arrakeen life, killed by foreign plants and too much water, now forming a barrier against the desert.Presently Ghanima said: "I am ready.Let us begin. ""Yes, damn all!"He reached out, touched her arm to soften the exclamation, said, "Please, Ghani...Sing that song.It makes this easier for me. "Ghanima hitched herself closer to him, circled his waist with her left arm.She drew in two deep breaths, cleared her throat, and began singing in a clear piping voice the words her mother had so often sung for their father:  		"Here I redeem the pledge thou gavest; 		I pour sweet water upon thee.Life shall prevail in this windless place: 		My love, thou shalt live in a palace, 		Thy enemies shall fall to emptiness.We travel this path together 		Which love has traced for thee.Surely well do I show the way 		For my love is thy palace... "Her voice fell into the desert silence which even a whisper might despoil, and Leto felt himself sinking, sinking   becoming the father whose memories spread like an overlayer in the genes of his immediate past.For this brief space, I must be Paul, he told himself.This is not Ghani beside me; it is my beloved Chani, whose wise counsel has saved us both many a time.For her part, Ghanima had slipped into the persona memory of her mother with frightening ease, as she had known she would.How much easier this was for the female   and how much more dangerous.In a voice turned suddenly husky, Ghanima said: "Look there, beloved!"First Moon had risen and, against its cold light, they saw an arc of orange fire falling upward into space.The transport which had brought the Lady Jessica, laden now with spice, was returning to its mother cluster in orbit.The keenest of remembrances ran through Leto then, bringing memories like bright bell sounds.For a flickering instant he was another Leto   Jessica's Duke.Necessity pushed those memories aside, but not before he felt the piercing of the love and the pain.I must be Paul, he reminded himself.The transformation came over him with a frightening duality, as though Leto were a dark screen against which his father was projected.He felt both his own flesh and his father's, and the flickering differences threatened to overcome him."Help me, father," he whispered.The flickering disturbance passed and now there was another imprint upon his awareness, while his own identity as Leto stood at one side as an observer."My last vision has not yet come to pass," he said, and the voice was Paul's.He turned to Ghanima."You know what I saw. "She touched his cheek with her right hand."Did you walk into the desert to die, beloved?Is that what you did?""It may be that I did, but that vision...Would that not be reason enough to stay alive?""But blind?"she asked."Even so. ""Where could you go?"He took a deep, shuddering breath."Jacurutu. ""Beloved!"Tears began flowing down her cheeks."Muad'Dib, the hero, must be destroyed utterly," he said."Otherwise this child cannot bring us back from chaos. ""The Golden Path," she said."It is not a good vision. ""It's the only possible vision. ""Alia has failed, then... ""Utterly.You see the record of it. ""Your mother has returned too late. "She nodded, and it was Chani's wise expression on the childish face of Ghanima."Could there not be another vision?Perhaps if  "  "No, beloved.Not yet.This child cannot peer into the future yet and return safely. "Again a shuddering breath disturbed his body, and Leto observer felt the deep longing of his father to live once more in vital flesh, to make living decisions and...How desperate the need to unmake past mistakes!"Father!"Leto called, and it was as though he shouted echoingly within his own skull.It was a profound act of will which Leto felt then: the slow, clinging withdrawal of his father's internal presence, the release of senses and muscles."Beloved," Chani's voice whispered beside him, and the withdrawal slowed."What is happening?""Don't go yet," Leto said, and it was his own voice, rasping and uncertain, still his own.Then: "Chani, you must tell us: How do we avoid...what has happened to Alia?"It was Paul within who answered him, though, with words which fell upon his inner ear, halting and with long pauses: "There is no certainty.You...saw...what almost...happened...with...me. ""But Alia... ""The damned Baron has her!"Leto felt his throat burning with dryness."Is he...have I. .. ""He's in you...but...I. ..we cannot...sometime we sense...each other, but you... ""Can you not read my thoughts?"Leto asked."Would you know then if...he... ""Sometimes I can feel your thoughts...but I. ..we live only through...the...reflection of...your awareness.Your memory creates us.The danger...it is a precise memory.And...those of us...those of us who loved power...and gathered it at...any price...those can be...more precise. ""Stronger?"Leto whispered."Stronger. ""I know your vision," Leto said."Rather than let him have me, I'll become you. ""Not that!"Leto nodded to himself, sensing the enormous will force his father had required to withdraw, recognizing the consequences of failure.Any possession reduced the possessed to Abomination.The recognition gave him a renewed sense of strength, and he felt his own body with abnormal acuteness and a deeply drawn awareness of past mistakes: his own and those of his ancestors.It was the uncertainties which weakened   he saw this now.For an instant, temptation warred with fear within him.This flesh possessed the ability to transform melange into a vision of the future.With the spice, he could breathe the future, shatter Time's veils.He found the temptation difficult to shed, clasped his hands and sank into the prana bindu awareness.His flesh negated the temptation.His flesh wore the deep knowledge learned in blood by Paul.Those who sought the future hoped to gain the winning gamble on tomorrow's race.Instead they found themselves trapped into a lifetime whose every heartbeat and anguished wail was known.Paul's final vision had shown the precarious way out of that trap, and Leto knew now that he had no other choice but to follow that way."The joy of living, its beauty is all bound up in the fact that life can surprise you," he said.A soft voice whispered in his ear: "I've always known that beauty. "Leto turned his head, stared into Ghanima's eyes which glistened in the bright moonlight.He saw Chani looking back at him."Mother," he said, "you must withdraw. ""Ahhh, the temptation!"she said, and kissed him.He pushed her away."Would you take your daughter's life?"he demanded."It's so easy...so foolishly easy," she said.Leto, feeling panic begin to grip him, remembered what an effort of will his father's persona within had required to abandon the flesh.Was Ghanima lost in that observer world where he had watched and listened, learning what he had required from his father?"I will despise you, mother," he said."Others won't despise me," she said."Be my beloved. ""If I do...you know what you both will become," he said."My father will despise you. ""Never!""I will!"The sound was jerked out of his throat without his volition and it carried all the old overtones of Voice which Paul had learned from his witch mother."Don't say it," she moaned."I will despise you!""Please...please don't say it. "Leto rubbed his throat, feeling the muscles become once more his own."He will despise you.He will turn his back on you.He will go into the desert again. ""No...no... "She shook her head from side to side."You must leave, mother," he said."No...no... "But the voice lacked its original force.Leto watched his sister's face.How the muscles twitched!Emotions fled across the flesh at the turmoil within her."Leave," he whispered "Leave. ""No o o o. .. "He gripped her arm, felt the tremors which pulsed through her muscles, the nerves twitching.She writhed, tried to pull away, but he held tightly to her arm, whispering: "Leave...leave... "And all the time, Leto berated himself for talking Ghani into this parent game which once they'd played often, but she had lately resisted.It was true that the female had more weakness in that inner assault, he realized.There lay the origin of the Bene Gesserit fear.Hours passed and still Ghanima's body trembled and twitched with the inner battle, but now his sister's voice joined the argument.He heard her talking to that image within, the pleading."Mother...please  " And once: "You've seen Alia!Will you become another Alia?"At last Ghanima leaned against him, whispered: "She has accepted it.She's gone. "He stroked her head."Ghani, I'm sorry.I'm sorry.I'll never ask you to do that again.I was selfish.Forgive me. ""There's nothing to forgive," she said, and her voice came panting as though after great physical exertion."We've learned much that we needed to know. ""She spoke to you of many things," he said."We'll share it later when  "  "No!We'll do it now.You were right. ""My Golden Path?""Your damned Golden Path!""Logic's useless unless it's armed with essential data," he said."But I  "  "Grandmother came back to guide our education and to see if we'd been...contaminated. ""That's what Duncan says.There's nothing new in  "  "Prime computation," she agreed, her voice strengthening.She pulled away from him, looked out at the desert which lay in a predawn hush.This battle...this knowledge, had cost them a night.The Royal Guard beyond the moisture seal must have had much to explain.Leto had charged that nothing disturb them."People often learn subtlety as they age," Leto said."What is it we're learning with all of this agedness to draw upon?""The universe as we see it is never quite the exact physical universe," she said."We mustn't perceive this grandmother just as a grandmother. ""That'd be dangerous," he agreed."But my ques  "  "There's something beyond subtlety," she said."We must have a place in our awareness to perceive what we can't preconceive.That's why...my mother spoke to me often of Jessica.At the last, when we were both reconciled to the inner exchange, she said many things. "Ghanima sighed."We know she's our grandmother," he said."You were with her for hours yesterday.Is that why  "  "If we allow it, our knowing will determine how we react to her," Ghanima said."That's what my mother kept warning me.She quoted our grandmother once and  " Ghanima touched his arm.  "I heard the echo of it within me in our grandmother's voice. ""Warning you," Leto said.He found this thought disturbing.Was nothing in this world dependable?"Most deadly errors arise from obsolete assumptions," Ghanima said."That's what my mother kept quoting. ""That's pure Bene Gesserit. ""If...if Jessica has gone back to the Sisterhood completely... ""That'd be very dangerous to us," he said, completing the thought."We carry the blood of their Kwisatz Haderach   their male Bene Gesserit. ""They won't abandon that search," she said, "but they may abandon us.Our grandmother could be the instrument. ""There's another way," he said."Yes   the two of us...mated.But they know what recessives might complicate that pairing. ""It's a gamble they must've discussed. ""And with our grandmother, at that.I don't like that way. ""Nor I. ""Still, it's not the first time a royal line has tried to... ""It repels me," he said, shuddering.She felt the movement, fell silent."Power," he said.And in that strange alchemy of their similarities she knew where his thoughts had been."The power of the Kwisatz Haderach must fail," she agreed."Used in their way," he said.In that instant, day came to the desert beyond their vantage point.They sensed the heat beginning.Colors leaped forth from the plantings beneath the cliff.Grey green leaves sent spiked shadows along the ground.The low morning light of Dune's silvery sun revealed the verdant oasis full of golden and purple shadows in the well of the sheltering cliffs.Leto stood, stretched."The Golden Path, then," Ghanima said, and she spoke as much to herself as to him, knowing how their father's last vision met and melted into Leto's dreams.Something brushed against the moisture seals behind them and voices could be heard murmuring there.Leto reverted to the ancient language they used for privacy: "L'ii ani howr samis sm'kwi owr samit sut. "That was where the decision lodged itself in their awareness.Literally: We will accompany each other into deathliness, though only one may return to report it.Ghanima stood then and, together, they returned through the moisture seals to the sietch, where the guards roused themselves and fell in behind as the twins headed toward their own quarters.The throngs parted before them with a difference on this morning, exchanging glances with the guards.Spending the night alone above the desert was an old Fremen custom for the holy sages.All the Uma had practiced this form of vigil.Paul Muad'Dib had done it...and Alia.Now the royal twins had begun.Leto noted the difference, mentioned it to Ghanima."They don't know what we've decided for them," she said."They don't really know. "Still in the private language, he said: "It requires the most fortuitous beginning. "Ghanima hesitated a moment to form her thoughts.Then: "In that time, mourning for the sibling, it must be exactly real   even to the making of the tomb.The heart must follow the sleep lest there be no awakening. "In the ancient tongue it was an extremely convoluted statement, employing a pronominal object separated from the infinitive.It was a syntax which allowed each set of internal phrases to turn upon itself, becoming several different meanings, all definite and quite distinct but subtly interrelated.In part, what she had said was that they risked death with Leto's plan and, real or simulated, it made no difference.The resultant change would be like death, literally: "funeral murder. "And there was an added meaning to the whole which pointed accusatively at whoever survived to report, that is: act out the living part.Any misstep there would negate the entire plan, and Leto's Golden Path would become a dead end."Extremely delicate," Leto agreed.He parted the hangings for them as they entered their own anteroom.Activity among their attendants paused only for a heartbeat as the twins crossed to the arched passage which led into the quarters assigned to the Lady Jessica."You are not Osiris. "Ghanima reminded him."Nor will I try to be. "Ghanima took his arm to stop him."Alia darsatay haunus m'smow," she warned.Leto stared into his sister's eyes.Indeed, Alia's actions did give off a foul smell which their grandmother must have noted.He smiled appreciatively at Ghanima.She had mixed the ancient tongue with Fremen superstition to call up a most basic tribal omen.M'smow, the foul odor of a summer night, was the harbinger of death at the hands of demons.And Isis had been the demon goddess of death to the people whose tongue they now spoke."We Atreides have a reputation for audacity to maintain," he said."So we'll take what we need," she said."It's that or become petitioners before our own Regency," he said."Alia would enjoy that. ""But our plan... "She let it trail off.Our plan, he thought.She shared it completely now.He said: "I think of our plan as the toil of the shaduf. "Ghanima glanced back at the anteroom through which they'd passed, smelling the furry odors of morning with their sense of eternal beginning.She liked the way Leto had employed their private language.Toil of the shaduf.It was a pledge.He'd called their plan agricultural work of a very menial kind: fertilizing, irrigating, weeding, transplanting, pruning   yet with the Fremen implication that this labor occurred simultaneously in Another World where it symbolized cultivating the richness of the soul.Ghanima studied her brother as they hesitated here in the rock passage.It had grown increasingly obvious to her that he was pleading on two levels: one, for the Golden Path of his vision and their father's, and two, that she allow him free reign to carry out the extremely dangerous myth creation which the plan generated.This frightened her.Was there more to his private vision that he had not shared?Could he see himself as the potentially deified figure to lead humankind into a rebirth   like father, like son?The cult of Muad'Dib had turned sour, fermenting in Alia's mismanagement and the unbridled license of a military priesthood which rode the Fremen power.Leto wanted regeneration.He's hiding something from me, she realized.She reviewed what he had told her of his dream.It held such iridescent reality that he might walk around for hours afterward in a daze.The dream never varied, he said."I am on sand in bright yellow daylight, yet there is no sun.Then I realize that I am the sun.My light shines out as a Golden Path.When I realize this, I move out of myself.I turn, expecting to see myself as the sun.But I am not the sun; I am a stick figure, a child's drawing with zigzag lightning lines for eyes, stick legs and stick arms.There is a scepter in my left hand, and it's a real scepter   much more detailed in its reality than the stick figure which holds it.The scepter moves, and this terrifies me.As it moves, I feel myself awaken, yet I know I'm still dreaming.I realize then that my skin is encased in something   an armor which moves as my skin moves.I cannot see this armor, but I feel it.My terror leaves me then, for this armor gives me the strength of ten thousand men. "As Ghanima stared at him, Leto tried to pull away, to continue their course toward Jessica's quarters.Ghanima resisted."This Golden Path could be no better than any other path," she said.Leto looked at the rock floor between them, feeling the strong return of Ghanima's doubts."I must do it," he said."Alia is possessed," she said."That could happen to us.It could already have happened and we might not know it. ""No. "He shook his head, met her gaze."Alia resisted.That gave the powers within her their strength.By her own strength she was overcome.We've dared to search within, to seek out the old languages and the old knowledge.We're already amalgams of those lives within us.We don't resist; we ride with them.This was what I learned from our father last night.It's what I had to learn. ""He said nothing of that within me. ""You listened to our mother.It's what we  "  "And I almost lost. ""Is she still strong within you?"Fear tightened his face."Yes...but now I think she guards me with her love.You were very good when you argued with her. "And Ghanima thought about the reflected mother within, said: "Our mother exists now for me in the alam al mythal with the others, but she has tasted the fruit of hell.Now I can listen to her without fear.As to the others... ""Yes," he said."And I listened to my father, but I think I'm really following the counsel of the grandfather for whom I was named.Perhaps the name makes it easy. ""Are you counseled to speak to our grandmother of the Golden Path?"Leto waited while an attendant pressed past them with a basket tray carrying the Lady Jessica's breakfast.A strong smell of spice filled the air as the attendant passed."She lives in us and in her own flesh," Leto said."Her counsel can be consulted twice. ""Not by me," Ghanima protested."I'm not risking that again. ""Then by me. ""I thought we agreed that she's gone back to the Sisterhood. ""Indeed.Bene Gesserit at her beginning, her own creature in the middle, and Bene Gesserit at the end.But remember that she, too, carries Harkonnen blood and is closer to it than we are, that she has experienced a form of this inner sharing which we have. ""A very shallow form," Ghanima said."And you haven't answered my question. ""I don't think I'll mention the Golden Path. ""I may. ""Ghani!""We don't need any more Atreides gods!We need a space for some humanity!""Have I ever denied it?""No. "She took a deep breath and looked away from him.Attendants peered in at them from the anteroom, hearing the argument by its tone but unable to understand the ancient words."We have to do it," he said."If we fail to act, we might just as well fall upon our knives. "He used the Fremen form which carried the meaning of "spill our water into the tribal cistern. "Once more Ghanima looked at him.She was forced to agree.But she felt trapped within a construction of many walls.They both knew a day of reckoning lay across their path no matter what they did.Ghanima knew this with a certainty reinforced by the data garnered from those other memory lives, but now she feared the strength which she gave those other psyches by using the data of their experiences.They lurked like harpies within her, shadow demons waiting in ambush.Except for her mother, who had held the fleshly power and had renounced it.Ghanima still felt shaken by that inner struggle, knowing she would have lost but for Leto's persuasiveness.Leto said his Golden Path led out of this trap.Except for the nagging realization that he withheld something from his vision, she could only accept his sincerity.He needed her fertile creativity to enrich the plan."We'll be tested," he said, knowing where her doubts led."Not in the spice. ""Perhaps even there.Surely, in the desert and in the Trial of Possession. ""You never mentioned the Trial of Possession!"she accused."Is that part of your dream?"He tried to swallow in a dry throat, cursed this betrayal "Yes. ""Then we will be...possessed?""No. "She thought about the Trial   that ancient Fremen examination whose ending most often brought hideous death.Then this plan had other complexities.It would take them onto an edge where a plunge to either side might not be countenanced by the human mind and that mind remain sane.Knowing where her thoughts meandered, Leto said: "Power attracts the psychotics.Always.That's what we have to avoid within ourselves. ""You're sure we won't be...possessed?""Not if we create the Golden Path. "Still doubtful, she said: "I'll not bear your children, Leto. "He shook his head, suppressing the inner betrayals, lapsed into the royal formal form of the ancient tongue: "Sister mine, I love you more dearly than myself, but that is not the tender of my desires. ""Very well, then let us return to another argument before we join our grandmother.A knife slipped into Alia might settle most of our problems. ""If you believe that, you believe we can walk in mud and leave no tracks," he said."Besides, when has Alia ever given anyone an opportunity?""There is talk about this Javid. ""Does Duncan show any signs of growing horns?"Ghanima shrugged."One poison, two poison. "It was the common label applied to the royal habit of cataloguing companions by their threat to your person, a mark of rulers everywhere."We must do it my way," he said."The other way might be cleaner.

"Tyekanik, fresh from a savage argument with Farad'n's mother, glanced sidelong at the Prince, noting how the lad's flesh was firming as he approached his eighteenth birthday.There was less and less of Wensicia in him with each passing day and more and more of old Shaddam, who had preferred his private pursuits to the responsibilities of royalty.That was what had cost him the throne in the end, of course.He'd grown soft in the ways of command."You have to make a choice," Tyekanik said."Oh, doubtless there'll be time for some of your interests, but... "Farad'n chewed his lower lip.Duty held him here, but he felt frustrated.He would far rather have gone to the rock enclave where the sandtrout experiments were being conducted.Now there was a project with enormous potential: wrest the spice monopoly from the Atreides and anything might happen."You're sure these twins will be...eliminated?""Nothing absolutely certain, My Prince, but the prospects are good. "Farad'n shrugged.Assassination remained a fact of royal life.The language was filled with the subtle permutations of ways to eliminate important personages.By a single word, one could distinguish between poison in drink or poison in food.He presumed the elimination of the Atreides twins would be accomplished by a poison.It was not a pleasant thought.By all accounts the twins were a most interesting pair."Would we have to move to Arrakis?"Farad'n asked."It's the best choice, put us at the point of greatest pressure. "Farad'n appeared to be avoiding some question and Tyekanik wondered what it might be."I'm troubled, Tyekanik," Farad'n said, speaking as they rounded a hedge corner and approached a fountain surrounded by giant black roses.Gardeners could be heard snipping beyond the hedges."Yes?"Tyekanik prompted."This, ah, religion which you've professed... ""Nothing strange about that, My Prince," Tyekanik said and hoped his voice remained firm."This religion speaks to the warrior in me.It's a fitting religion for a Sardaukar. "That, at least, was true."Yesss...But my mother seems so pleased by it. "Damn Wensicia!he thought.She's made her son suspicious."I care not what your mother thinks," Tyekanik said."A man's religion is his own affair.Perhaps she sees something in this that may help to put you on the throne. ""That was my thought," Farad'n said.Ahhh, this is a sharp lad!Tyekanik thought.He said: "Look into the religion for yourself; you'll see at once why I chose it. ""Still...Muad'Dib's preachings?He was an Atreides, after all. ""I can only say that the ways of God are mysterious," Tyekanik said."I see.Tell me, Tyek, why'd you ask me to walk with you just now?It's almost noon and usually you're off to someplace or other at my mother's command this time of day. "Tyekanik stopped at a stone bench which looked upon the fountain and the giant roses beyond.The splashing water soothed him and he kept his attention upon it as he spoke."My Prince, I've done something which your mother may not like. "And he thought: If he believes that, her damnable scheme will work.Tyekanik almost hoped Wensicia's scheme would fail.Bringing that damnable Preacher here.She was insane.And the cost!As Tyekanik remained silent, waiting, Farad'n asked: "All right, Tyek, what've you done?""I've brought a practitioner of oneiromancy," Tyekanik said.Farad'n shot a sharp glance at his companion.Some of the older Sardaukar played the dream interpretation game, had done so increasingly since their defeat by that "Supreme Dreamer," Muad'Dib.Somewhere within their dreams, they reasoned, might lay a way back to power and glory.But Tyekanik had always eschewed this play.
