Juan?Xiu Xiang?Miri?So many friends, doing so much to save an incompetent old fool and his fellow fools.The ground bounced elastically against their feet.They were passing through the sky tunnel, back into GenGen territory.28    The Animal Model?Even on a slow day, thousands of certificates got revoked every hour.It was a messy process, but a necessary consequence of frauds detected, court orders executed, and credit denied.All but a handful of revocations were short cascades of denied transactions, involving a single individual and his/her immediate certificate authority, or a small company and its CA.Perhaps once a year there would be a significant cascade, usually when a large company ran into uncompromising creditors and a court order was delivered to a midlevel CA.Even more rarely, a revocation might be part of a military action, as in the fall of South Ossetia.In theory, the revocation protocols worked with arbitrarily large CAs but until this night, no apex certificate authority had ever issued global revocations.And Credit Suisse was one of the ten largest CAs in the world.Most of its business was in Europe, but its certificates bound webs of unmeasured complexity all over the planet, affecting the interactions of people who might speak no European language.Tonight all those unknowing customers would learn of their connection.The failures spread as timeouts on certificates from intermediate CAs and  where time critical trust was involved  as direct notifications.In Europe, airplanes and trains came smoothly to a stop, without a single accident or fatality.A billion failures were noted, and emergency services moved  with varying success  into action.The U. S.  Department of Homeland Security noticed the failures and the growing collateral damage.Analyst pools in the U. S.  reached out to the other Great Powers and conferred under emergency protocols established years ago.Chinese Public Safety, the Indo European intelligence services, the U. S.  DHS  they all agreed that a category one disaster was in progress, a really bad software failure or a novel terrorist attack.In certain corners of Indo European intelligence, understanding was more precise.Considerably more precise.Braun  > Mitsuri, Vaz: <sm>So I have done it.Has it had any effect on Rabbit?</sm>  So far there were only small failures at UCSD, just a few certificates timing out.That was enough to make some projections: The crowds had not consciously noticed the changes, but the library riot was due for an abrupt and ignominious end.Even more than the analysts had guessed, Rabbit had been behind what they had seen tonight, and now that support was rotting away.Down in the labs, Rabbit had been an almost invisible intruder.Confirming the absence of that intrusion was not easy, but Alfred's analysts had a consensus:  Vaz  > Braun, Mitsuri: <sm>Communication failures are up, but not in our core operation.Rabbit is still here, but he's losing flexiblity.</sm>  Braun  > Mitsuri, Vaz: <sm>Losing flexibility?By damn, we need more than that.What about his two agents?What are they doing?</sm>  Vaz  > Braun, Mitsuri: <sm>They've wandered out of our area.</sm> That wasn't precisely true, but the Gus and what remained of Rabbit were properly diverted.Now I just need a few more minutes .Rabbit was under pressure.He always told himself that he performed best under pressure  though usually the pressure was not so immediate, nor his opponents so powerful and humorless.Other than some of the low ranking analysts, Rabbit didn't know anyone on the Indo European side who could take a joke.Rabbit looked out through a dozen cameras, everything that Alfred had suborned in the MCog area.His hands had entered the area just a few moments before; maybe that was what had panicked his enemies into their massive revocation attack.With a small and dwindling part of his attention he followed the wonderful riot around the library.Sigh.Alfred & Co had never guessed his connection with Scooch a mout, and yet Who'd'a thunk they'd detect his affection for Credit Suisse CA?Or that the EU had such power over the certificate authority of a sovereign country?Or that his own dependence was as broad as he was now discovering?Rabbit had other apex CAs, though none so useful as Credit Suisse.They would suffice for a few more minutes.Where they didn't, he had legal programs posting appeals against the most destructive of the revocations.Meantime, focus on the fun things: What was Alfred trying do do?Sheer destruction?Intellectual theft?Rabbit was beginning to feel mean.He had been willing to settle for a secret back door into Alfred's operation.Now, well, now he meant to steal it all.Starting with the fruit flies.Rabbit reached out for his hands.Robert remembered this area.They were back in the heart of GenGen country, the unending rows of gray cabinets, the crystal forests that connected them, the pneumo tubes.But up ahead was a sound like cardboard boxes being crushed.The Stranger's pdf had explanations for the abbreviations that were printed on the sides of the cabinets:  Dros MCog  Robert  > Miri: <sm> Fruit flies?</sm> This was where he had set down almost a third of the little boxes, having to crawl over above and between the cabinets.Miri  > Robert: <sm>Yes.Did you read what Smart Aleck claims about this?I don't believe it.</sm>  "Hey, hey, my man!"And there was the Mysterious Stranger, Miri's Mr.Smart Aleck.His skin was practically glowing green, even in the shadows.The face was Sharif's but the smile was inhumanly wide."Talk as you please.Alfred discovered us here several minutes ago. "The Stranger looked around, as if expecting a visible enemy."So now I don't care if he hears you.Or me!What can you do, Alfred?You're shutting me down, but I wager I'll last another minute or two.Oh, I suppose you could shut down your own operation, too.I'd be instantly gone then. "He glanced back at Miri and Robert, and continued sotto voce."If he does that, he's truly desperate.And it won't help him a bit, since you still have my pdf.You'll still be here to destroy his underhanded plans. "The Mysterious Stranger waved for them to follow."Did you get to this part of my explanation?"He waved at the cabinets."Molecular Biology of Cognition.MCog.And Alfred's people have created the ideal animal model for their research. ""Fruit flies?"said Robert."I don't believe it," said Miri."Fruit flies can't think.What could your 'Alfred'  or you  do with them?"The Stranger gave out one of its dismissive laughs, and Robert noticed  Miri's face jerk up.She might do better with this manipulator than Robert.After all, she wasn't desperate for his help."Ah, Miri, you read but you don't understand.If you had access just now to the wider net  and a few hundred hours of research  perhaps you'd understand that molecular biology depends more on data depth and analysis than it does on the particular class of organism.In his Drosophila melanogaster alfred  is that what you call them, Alfred?we have the metabolic pathways that are the basis for all animal cognition. "Minus the editorial comments, this did look like some of the pdf.They rounded a corner and saw the source of the sounds."Viola , Alfred's three hundred thousand fruit flies, now being folded into convenient shipping cartridges. "The Stranger's face and body bore less and less resemblance to the original Sharif."But I must confess  I know what these little bugs are, but I don't really know what Alfred has planned for them.Surely there are some marvelous diseases  cognitive diseases?that might come out of such research.Or maybe he wants to get a head start on all the enhancement drug people.Or maybe he's into YGBM.But I do know  "  The fruit fly arrays were being folded on a large transport table, much bigger than anything in Ron Williams's shop class.The shipping cylinders rolled across the table, right through the Stranger's body.The creature noticed this a half second late, but did a creditable hop back from the table."But I do know that he's trying to ship them off site. ""So you claim. ""Hey, trust me, Miss Miri.You've met Alfred .He's the fellow who tried to kill Juan Orozco.The guy's an evil loon.Ping the labels on these packages if you don't believe me. "Yes .UP/Ex labels with an encrypted destination.The first of the cylinders was sliding off the table, headed toward the nearest pneumo tube.Now the Stranger was hopping from one foot to the other."Only you can save mankind!Just knock the cylinders onto the lower tray.Don't let Alfred win!"That seemed to convince Miri.She rushed to the table, grabbed the package out of the pneumo tube lock, and tossed it to Robert.He caught it and the next and the next and now his arms were full.The white cylinders were as light as foam.The Stranger's image froze for a second.Abruptly, animation returned."Heh!Excellently done. "He waved vaguely at the walls."See that, Alfred?It doesn't pay to cross the Rabbit!"Rabbit ?The creature turned back in their general direction; by God, it did look a little bit like a rabbit."That was a near thing, but I won!I mean, we saved mankind. "It drew itself up, but its whole body was tilted."Damn Alfred.He is shutting me down a piece at time.Maybe I should exit with my impression of the Wicked Witch of the West.Dying, that is. "The creature spun around, giving out melodramatic moans, its body dissolving around it.It hesitated, and said offhandedly to Robert, "Oh, don't let the cylinders go untreated.Just drop them onto the lower tray. "Robert didn't move."I mean it!"said the Stranger, something like a serious tone creeping into its voice.It flailed about  more dramatic dying, or looking for an explanation?"If the bugs are disease vectors, you're at ground zero!The lower tray will send them to an incinerator, all safe and tidy. "Miri shook her head."No.That's an alternate path to the UP/Ex launcher. ""Look at my pdf, you fool.The map. ""I looked at my map, the one I cached this afternoon. "Miri's smile was triumphant.There was a two second lag.Then the creature turned and looked almost straight at Miri."I hate you, Miri Gu.You evil thing.Everything was going so well till you started meddling.I'll get you for this. "Then it was shouting."Meantime, I'm gonna get you , Alfred.If I'm out of action, so are you!I'm blowing the whistle on you.I'm  "  The figure stopped moving.There was a moment of silence; then Robert heard a single word, faint and faraway:" help. "And the creature vanished.Robert and Miri stared at each other.It was just the two of them, and the ranks of cabinets."Do you think he's really gone, Miri?""I don't know. "Miri  > Robert: <sm>But if Smart Aleck wasn't lying about everything, then this Alfred guy is still around.</sm> Aloud, her words were timid."Maybe we should stay here and wait for the police. ""Okay. "Miri plunked herself down on the floor.She was very quiet for a moment, both publicly and privately.Robert set the packages down and stared off into the dark, looking this way and that.Supposedly there were no mon enemy robots.What could "Alfred" do with the fruit flies now?What couk the fellow do to Miri and Robert himself?Miri  > Robert: <sm>Things don't sound the same.</sm>  Robert looked a question at her.Miri drew a golden arrow at right angles to the corridor they had arrived from.Miri  > Robert: <sm>I kept track of everything I heard when I was following you.There's something new going on, most likely in the mouse arrays.Did you do anything over that way?</sm> She quietly came back to her feet.Robert tapped at his keypad:  Robert  > Miri: <sm>Thts whr we put most of our eqt.</sm>  Miri's chin came up.Miri > Robert: <sm>The sounds are like what we heard here .Someone's packaging another shipment out.</sm>  29    Dr.Xiang Takes Charge  Gnberk and Keiko and Alfred each had their own analyst pools.Ten seconds ago those analysts had agreed: As an active threat, Rabbit was gone, both topside and in the operation's milnet.Dissent clusters hung around the opinion, but they were related to collateral damage prediction.Braun  > Mitsuri, Vaz: <sm>God willing, we've stopped the monster.</sm>  Mitsuri  > Braun, Vaz: <sm>And we have the inspection data we came for.Now it's time to get the hell out!</sm> She brought up a zoomed picture of the contingency tree.They were way out on a limb that led to full loss of deniability.And yet, until they knew for sure the results of their investigation, they needed the Americans kept ignorant.Alfred presented his latest extraction schedule, the times padded just enough to cover his outshipment activities.Mitsuri  > Braun, Vaz: <sm>Eight minutes!That much?</sm> Keiko still had things covered on the north side of the labs.And the views of the riot showed the Bollywood team still in place by the library but that affair was descending into civil disorder, the sort of thing that brings a direct police response.Meshing Alfred back into the Bollywood people should be easy now; very soon it would be impossible.Vaz  > Braun, Mitsuri: <sm>I'll trim every second I can, Keiko.</sm>  Mitsuri  > Braun, Vaz: <sm>You'd better!Five minutes is the most I can guarantee.</sm>  Alfred smiled at Keiko's impolitely constrained panic.She and Gnberk would do their best.And in some ways, this chaos was helpful.Fooling Gnberk and Keiko had always been Alfred's biggest problem.His outshipment would've been impossible if they weren't so distracted.Two minutes passed.Three.His secret team had completed most of the fakery.They had updated the logs to satisfy both Alliance and future U. S.  investigators.Now they were working with one small section of the Mus musculus arrays, his true animal model.Alfred hopped from viewpoint to viewpoint, swooping over cabinets that looked like office blocks in some bland, utilitarian city.He couldn't take more than a few of the mice, just a few of those conceived since the last update.His team had already shut down the in progress experiments and started destruct operations.Now they detached the chosen arrays and began prepping them for launch.Other members of the team were already sending shipping cartridges to the pneumo port atop the cabinet.He could fit one twenty by thirty array six hundred mice  into each cartridge.Mitsuri > Braun, Vaz: <sm>Alfred!The public net is failing.</sm>  Vaz swore and glanced at the topside analysis.This wasn't even close to Keiko's deadline.Braun > Mitsuri, Vaz: <sm>It's a full system failure.Mr.Rabbit has screwed us.</sm>  The analysts were boiling with contrary opinions.Failures like this happened a couple of times a year somewhere in the world, the price that civilization paid for complexity.But here there was a more sinister suspicion, that this failure was collateral damage from the revocation.Maybe Rabbit's riot magic depended on his commandeering the embedded computer systems of the public environment.Now that his certificates were revoked, there was a cascade of failures working through almost everything, just as fast as the certificates failed.Mitsuri  > Braun, Vaz: <sm>Alfred!Clean up and get out!</sm>  The second and third cartridges would be ready in a moment.Alfred glanced at the UP/Ex status.The launcher was close to the MCog area.Most important, it was locally managed, unaffected by the crash outside.He entered a destination in Guatemala  and selected a launch vehicle that he'd emplaced some weeks before.It ought to be stealthy enough to get out of U. S.  airspace.Vaz  > Braun, Mitsuri: <sm>One minute.Can you give me that?</sm>  Mitsuri  > Braun, Vaz: <sm>I will try.</sm>  The topside analysts were hard into contingency planning and probability estimates.A thousand little changes were being made across the UCSD landscape, wherever the Indo European operation had influence.The Bollywood presence would survive as long as any up there.Alfred forced his attention back into the labs.The second cartridge was loading.The first cartridge was shooting down the pneumo, taking its little passengers to the launcher.Alfred froze.The Gus were gone from the fruit fly area.There was movement in another window, at the edge of the mice arrays.A girl and a man running toward the camera.They hadn't been fooled by the fruit flies.Alfred leaned forward.Okay.One minute.What could his people cook up in that time?Lena's wheelchair was no hiking machine.It did well enough on the asphalt, even going uphill; Xiu had to trot to keep up.But where the asphalt was carved by gullies, the chair had to walk.The going got very slow."Can you even see the road, Lena?"Her view page was as dark as the natural view."No.I think someone has turned off the hillside.Side effect of the riot, maybe. "She moved to the middle of the road."Sst!They're still coming. "She waved at Xiu to come forward."How can we stop them?One way or another, we have to find out what's happening. ""Robert will see you. ""Damnation!"Lena dithered, caught in a dilemma."Go back to the side of the road.I can stop them more safely, anyway. ""Hmph," said Lena.But she retreated.Xiu stood still for a moment.There were the distant sounds of the freeway.From over the hilltop there were noises that might have been chanting.But nearby was just insect sounds, the feel of air cooling in the night, the narrow roadway jumbled and rocky under her feet.She saw light sweep across the outcroppings above her."I can hear them, Xiu. "Xiu could, too, the crunch of tires and now the faint whine of electric motors.The mystery car came around a last, unseen bend in the road, and she tensed to dive out of the way.But on this road, cars could not speed.Its headlights slowly bore down on her."Make way, make way. "The words were loud, and the view page in her hand came alight with flashing warnings about the penalties for interfering with the California Highway Patrol.Xiu started to give way, and then she thought, But it's the CHPI want to talk to .She waved for the car to stop.The vehicle slowed still more, then turned and tried to edge past her on the left."Make way, make way. ""No!"she shouted and hopped back in front of it."You stop!"The car moved even more slowly."Make way, make way. "And it tried to pass her on the other side.Xiu jumped in the way again, this time flailing her backpack as though it could do some damage.The auto backed up a yard or two, and turned slyly as if preparing an end run.Xiu wondered if she really wanted to jump in front of what happened next.With every heartbeat, pain spiked through Tommie.After a moment he realized that was good news.He raised his head, saw that he was stretched out on the backseat of a passenger car.That was Winston and Carlos in the facing seats."Where's Robert and his little girl?"Winston Blount shook his head."They stayed behind. ""We split up, Professor Parker. "Scary memories were coming back."Oh yeah.Where's my laptop?We gotta call 911. ""We called, Tommie.Everything's okay now, this is a CHP vehicle. "Despite his haziness, that didn't make sense."It sure doesn't look like one."It's got all the insignia, Tommie," but there was dawning uncertainty in Winston's voice.Tommie slid his legs from the seat and pushed himself into a half sitting position.The pain squeezed tight on his chest, clawed out along his arms.He almost blacked out again, and would have fallen forward if not for Carlos."Hold hold me up!"Tommie looked forward.The car's headlights were on.The road was steep and narrow, with scattered remnants of asphalt surfacing, the sort of thing you might see in the East County, or in short stretches along the coast, a disconnected remnant of lost roadway.They slowed, negotiating deeply shadowed gullies.Bushes swept close around them.And now ahead he saw someone standing in the middle of the road.The car slowed to a crawl just five yards short of  it was a young woman."Make way, make way. "Their car said over and over, trying to get by on one side and then the other.The woman hopped from side to side, blocking them.She was shouting, and swinging a good sized backpack at them.Their car backed up a few feet, and Tommie heard the faint squeal of a capacitor preparing for something drastic.The wheels turned a few degrees  and the woman jumped in front of them again.Her face was bright in the headlights.It was a pretty Asian face if you added thirty years to it, you got the face from some very distasteful turn of the century papers in Secure Computing .She was the last person he'd ever expect to play "block the tanks at Tiananmen Square. "The headlights went out.The car jolted forward.Then the brakes engaged and they slid halfway into the ditch.There was a muffled explosion that might have been that capacitor slagging itself.The doors on both sides of the vehicle popped open and Tommie slid partway into the cool night air."You okay, Professor Parker?"That was Carlos's voice, coming from close behind his head."Not dead yet. "He heard footsteps on the roadway.A light flared in a small hand, and the woman said loudly, "It's Winston Blount and Carlos Rivera  " and then more conversationally, "  and Thomas Parker.Y You probably don't know me, Dr.Parker, but I have admired your work. "Tommie didn't know what to say to that."Let us pass," said Winston."This is an emergency. "He was interrupted by the sound of wheels  but not from another car.A voice spoke from the darkness: "Where's Miri?Where's Robert?"Carlos said, "They're still inside.They're trying to stop the  We're afraid that someone is taking over the labs. "Motors whined.It was a wheelchair, carrying someone all hunched over.But the voice was strong and irritated."Damn it.Lab security would prevent that. ""Maybe not. "Winnie sounded like he was chewing on broken glass."We think that someone has subverted security.We called 911.That's what you're interfering with. "He waved at their car.It was halfway into the ditch, unmoving.Tommie looked at the darkened passenger car."No," he said."That's a fake.Please.You call 911. "The wheelchair rolled nearer."I'm trying to!But we're in some kind of a deadzone.We should go down the hill, find something we can latch on to. ""Dull" said Carlos.He was staring all around, the way kids do when their contacts fail.The redoubtable Dr.Xiang waved her little handlight, light and shade sweeping up around her.Strange.There was a kind of hesitancy about her.X.  Xiang was one of the true Bad Guys of the present era, at least one of the people who had made the Bad Guy regimes possible.You could never tell it by looking at her.She doused the light, and stood silently for a moment."I I don't think we're in a local deadzone. ""Sure it is!"said Winnie."I'm wearing, and I can't see a thing except the real view.We have to get to the freeway, or at least get a line of sight on it. "And now Tommie remembered what Gu's granddaughter had said.Maybe the local nodes were being spoofed.Xiang had another theory:  "I mean the deadzone is not just here.Listen. ""I don't hear a thing  oh. "There were little sounds, insects maybe.There was faint shouting from over the hills.Okay, that must be the belief circle diversion.What else?The freeway sounded strange, not the constant, throbbing surf of wheels on road.Now there was only the faintest sound, a dying sigh.Tommie had never heard such a thing, but he knew how stuff worked."Failure shutdown," he said."Everything?Stopped ?"said Carlos, horror climbing up into his voice."Yup!"Tommie's chest pain beat toward a crescendo.But hey, let me live long enough to learn what's going on !The voice from the wheelchair said, "Even if we can't get word out, someone will notice. ""Maybe not," Tommie gasped out.If the blackout was large and spotty, with the appearance of natural disaster  why, it might cover something really big going on underground."And there's nothing we can do to help," said Winston."Maybe not. "Xiang's words echoed Tommie's, but her voice was thoughtful, distant.She flicked her light at the backpack."I've had a lot of fun in shop class.You can make so many interesting things now. "Tommie managed, "Yeah.And they all obey the law. "X.  Xiang's laugh was soft."That fact can be used against itself, especially if the parts don't know the big picture. "A lot of Tommie's old friends talked that way; it was mostly idle talk.But this was X.  Xiang.She pulled out a clunky looking gadget.It looked like an old time coffee can, open at one end.She held the coffee can where it could see her view page."Lots of gadgets are still working, they just can't find enough nodes to get a route out.But there's a big military base just north of here. "From the wheelchair: "Camp Pendleton is about thirty miles thataway. "Maybe the speaker gestured, but Tommie couldn't see.Xiang scanned her coffee can across the starless sky."This is crazy," said Winston."How can you know there are nodes in your line of sight?""I don't.I'm going to shine signals off the sky haze.I'm calling in the marines. "And then she was talking to her view page.Bob Gu and his marines logged more time in training systems than they ever did in combat or on watch.Training managers were legendary for creating impossible emergencies  and then topping them with something even more unbelievable.Tonight the real world was outdoing the craziest of the trainers.Alice had been moved to Intensive Care.Bob would have gone with her  except that whatever had taken her down was enemy action, and not the end of it.The analyst display had sprouted new nodes and a dozen long shot associations: Credit Suisse CA had just collapsed, a major disaster for Europe.The certificate revocations would have effects even in California.Bob took a closer look.The Credit Suisse collapse was so abrupt that it had to be a sophisticated attack.So what was a distraction from what ?The DoD/DHS combined Earth Watch was involved now.Tonight's action could be something new, a Grand Terror that ran simultaneously through the U. S. A.  and the Indo European Alliance, profiting from the gaps created by national sovereignties.Looking at the analysis above him, Bob could see only the broadest outlines, but it was evident that the intelligence agencies of the U. S. A. , the Alliance, and China were collaborating to hunt down the source of the threat.In CONUS Southwest, his new top analyst was doing her best.His analyst pool was still crippled, but folks were talking productively.Their structures of conjecture and conclusion were growing.The new top analyst took voice: "Colonel, the revocation storm is very intense at UCSD. "The traffic display showed that the demonstration around the library had ground to a halt.The new failures were not due to backbone router saturation.Participants were being decertified by the thousands.Millions of support programs were balked.If nothing else, this showed that massive foreign involvement in tonight's festivities had not been some analyst pipe dream.Whatever had hit Europe was intimately involved here.But the bio labs still showed green.Even the participation of the night crews in the library demonstrations had worked out for the best.Maybe productivity and performance would be down for this shift, but that was a commercial issue.In fact, the departure of the human crews had simplified the lab situation.There was nothing there but automation  and it showed all was well."FBI again requests clearance to take over. "Bob shook his head irritably."Denied.As before. "Hmm .More than riot participants were being decertified.Three analysts from the Southern California utilities reported infrastructure failures in the campus area.Why would local infrastructure depend on certs from Credit Suisse?"Correlation of systems failures with the revocation storm is ninety five percent, Colonel. "No kidding .Even if the labs were clean, there was some kind of deadly interference here.Bob tapped the command he had been contemplating these last few minutes:  LAUNCH ALERT  "Analysts update contingency nine and give me a launch mark," he said.There was a pause as the request was reviewed by the DoD/DHS combined Earth Watch.His CONUS Southwest watch was on a very short leash since Alice's breakdown:  But clearance came back in just five seconds.Bob scarcely noticed his gee pod inflate.He would be the last out of the barn, so there was a lot to watch.LAUNCH LAUNCH LAUNCH  "Uncrewed vehicles launched. "His displays showed thirty canisters of combat network munitions shot high into the Southern California night.The uncrews were from the north side of the base, twenty kilometers away.Farther north, from MCAS Edwards, more primitive weapons rose into the heavens.Their manifest was a catalog of extreme possibilities: rescue lances (500), damage suppression fogs (100), HEIR lasers (10), thermal flechettes/isolation variant (100) and then the last three, the nightmares  sterilization fog dispensers (10 by 10), HERF area munitions (20 by 20 by 4), strategic nuclear munitions (10 by 10 by 2).Analysts are paid to think worst case  but Lord .The bio labs were the only excuse for these items.But in truth  if you discounted the absence of follow up equipment  this was a fairly conventional load for a modern expeditionary force.Three times in Bob's career, such launches had ended in real combat.But those had been half a world away, in Almaty, in Ciudad General Ortiz, and in Asuncion.The most terrible weapons had never been used, though Asuncion had been a very near thing.Tonight he was aiming all this hardware at his own neighbors, just thirty miles south of Camp Pendleton.Full force in an urban area was like going after rats in your kitchen with a machine gun.Keep your head down, Miri ."FBI again requests clearance to take over. ""Denied.The situation has escalated. "For the moment, hopefully just for the moment.If police and rescue could bring the system back up, then all the hardware that Bob had just boosted over Southern California would simply be an expensive exercise.But one good thing about being locked and loaded was that he had lots more call on resources: Gu grabbed analyst teams from all across the national workshift and pushed the intel and sensor backlog at them.Priority questions: Are the San Diego labs secure?What is the prognosis for the current system failures?Meantime, Bob's launches had soared to the top of their trajectories.He tweaked the Edwards munitions still higher, delaying them behind the gear from Pendleton.If nothing was resolved soon, he would have to light the uncrews' jets.I need answers, guys !But the analyst mob was still busy connecting a billion dots, looking for patterns and conspiracies.Then a single observation changed everything.A weather service geek doing her monthly reserve duty grabbed a very high priority: "Twenty seconds ago.I see ad hoc signaling in the backscatter above here"  and she drew an ellipse over San Diego North  County, covering much of Camp Pendleton.Somebody was making their own communications, simply blinking a light into the sky haze!The long axis of the scatter ellipse pointed right back toward UCSD.The words of the intercepted message streamed across Bob's vision:  Xiu Xiang  > anyone clever enough to notice me in the backscatter: <sm>GenGen laboratory automation has been corrupted.The system is attacking anyone opposing it.This is not a game.This is not a joke.What?Yes, I'll tell them.There are two people still in the labs.They are good guys!They are trying to help.</sm>  The NOAA analyst spoke over the script display: "The message is a one second burst, retransmitted twelve times.What you're seeing is the summed cleanup. "It was clear enough.Bob Gu's fingers tapped in their gloves, launching his marines.Then his own gee pod came tight and   for a moment Bob Gu was not paying attention.For a moment he could not pay attention.Battle commit put the combat CO himself into the fray.In this case, launch took his landing dart almost horizontally out of Pendleton.Maybe this is not a good idea , he thought muzzily.But he always thought that coming out of a twenty gee railgun launch.Now he had to recollect his wits and context.His team and equipment were on schedule.The unthinkable Last Resorts were still high overhead, flexible to the last.The network munitions were already at UCSD.And the bio labs still showed green, all secure and peaceful.His own landing dart was seconds away from the UCSD.There was something else that was important, something in the last few seconds.Xiu Xiang?Bob's recollection came unsquished just as a DHS analyst team presented its own form of the insight: Xiu Xiang.A not uncommon name.But in all of Southern California there probably weren't more than three or four who owned that name.And one lived at Rainbows End with Lena Gu.Suddenly he had a good idea just who was in the crosshairs of all that he commanded.30    When the Network Stops  The Library had chosen.For an instant, Timothy Huynh and all the night crew were silent.The crowds of real humans were quiet, and even the millions of virtuals took part in a coordinated stillness.The Library had chosen  and it had chosen the Scoochis.On the Hacek side you could see the realization of defeat spreading.The triumph was real.How would the Hacekeans take it?There had been a few debacles in the late teens, when major belief structures had produced some awful art.Some were so bad that the circles themselves had shriveled and died.Who heard of Tines anymore, or the Zones of Thought?But tonight the Hacekeans had lost at the hands of others; they must do something  maybe even something gracious.The silent stillness of the mob continued a second more.Then Dangerous Knowledge suddenly turned away from the library.Its gaze swept fiercely across them all.After all, playing loser wasn't in its repertoire.But whoever was behind all the creativity was flexible: After a moment, Dangerous smiled gently and turned back to the library.Its voice made concession sound like the granting of a favor: "We bow to the wishes of the Library.Here you have won, O Scooch a mout. "Wails arose from the Hacek side, but Dangerous raised a hand and continued."We give up our claims here.We remain as guests only. "Sheila  > Night Crew: <sm>The Hacek people are in heavy discussion with the university administration.They're begging for whatever scraps they can get.</sm>  And the Greater Scooch a mout was conciliatory in victory, though it didn't step away from its embrace of the library."You are welcome as guests, in a library with real books. "Hanson  > Night Crew: <sm>Admin is squealing about that, but the publicity should pay for extra floor space.We've won, gang!</sm>   For some minutes, everything was cool.Ending a riot without a police confrontation or a physical debacle was a little bit anticlimactic, but the riot designers had even more special effects to wind things down.Katie Rosenbaum gathered the spider bots all together, then sent them out to Huynh's mechs for a bizarre "peace dance"  that incidentally cleaned up most of the night's garbage.Tim sensed negotiations going on between the two sides, things being traded, promises made.Dangerous Knowledge retreated into the sky, and both sides played with special effects that were new on this night.But now, when things should have been getting smoother, there were network problems.Here and there, service was unusably slow or all jittery.It made everyone look bad.Scooch a mout still stood by the library, embracing the pillar that had "walked. "You hold a heroic gesture that long and you just look stupid.Huynh looked at his mech status board.There hadn't been a Scoochi update for almost seven seconds.That was no way to drive a mech.Huynh  > Hanson: <sm>Hey, Sheila.Who's driving the Greater Scooch a mout?</sm>  Hanson  > Huynh: <sm>Dunno.He was good, but now he's dropped the ball.It's okay, we're winding down now.Just take control and walk the robot out.No need to look cool.</sm> Then she was messaging the whole night crew, trying to tidy up and get all her GenGen people and gear back where they belonged.Huynh drove his forklift toward the Greater Scooch a mout mech.He walked along behind and tried to figure some nice way to get the two off the field.His robot's "Mind Sum" mists weren't matching its movements anymore; they looked like crap.Okay.He'd take control of the Greater Scooch a mout, and have the two robots give a last high five, and then rumble out together.That would be cool, if not fully so.Maybe it didn't matter.The network problems were getting a lot worse.There were strange latencies, maybe real partitions.Blocks of the virtual audience were being run on cache.Single hop still mostly worked, but routed communication was in trouble.Huynh stepped a few feet to the side and managed to find a good diagnostic source.There were certificate failures at the lowest levels.He had never seen that before.Even the localizer mesh was failing'.Like the holes in threadbare carpet, splotches of plain reality grew around him, eating out the mists and crowds, revealing the armies of everyday lab mechs.Where there had been hundreds of thousands of players, now there were open stretches of dark lawn, and the crowds of real humans, standing in shock."Tim!Your forklift!"The shout was real sound, from Sheila Hanson, just a few feet away.Huynh turned back toward the library.He had lost contact with Mind Sum!He ran toward the mech.The forklift had continued autonomously for just a couple of steps.But this was not a flat lab floor, and the localizer mesh was failing around it.The robot had tripped on one of the ornamental boulders that fringed the terrace.It teetered off balance, shrieking location queries in all directions.But now the mesh was gone, and the forklift was in trouble.Its onboard systems were designed to cope with instability: the failure mode consisted of stepping quickly into the fall, lowering its center of gravity, and dropping stability limbs.That would have worked down in the clean environment of the labs.Here, its lunge took it to the edge of the north side grade  and there was no localizer mesh to alert it to the drop.The stability limb settled into thin air, and the forklift tipped over the edge.There were screams.Huynh ran out onto the robot battlefield.All the epic imagery was gone, but the robots still had local coordination.They rolled out of his way.He scarcely noticed.All his attention was on his forklift.He had direct contact now.He surfed across the forklift's cameras and felt sick.There was someone pinned underneath.He climbed down the hillside and fell to his knees.The woman was trapped there, still screaming.Her leg, up to above the knee, was crushed by forklift composite.Someone scrambled down beside him.Sheila.She wriggled under the blades of the forklift, reached down to grasp the woman's hand."We'll get you out.Don't worry.We'll get you out. ""Yes!"said Tim.He had full control now.Between his own vision and the cameras, he could see how it had fallen, and where the woman was pinned.Be cool and everything will be okay .The forklift put its weight on knees that didn't touch the woman.There was solid support, no surprises.From under the blades he could hear Sheila comforting the woman.Okay, just shift the weight back, push off into a low sitting posture.Easy  But now there were other screams, and the sounds of people running.Smale  > Huynh: <sm>Help us, Tim!</sm>  Huynh glanced through a camera on the other end of the forklift: The robot that had been the Greater Scooch a mout was still standing by the library, but now its center of gravity was absurdly high and someone had overridden all its safeties, to push against the nearest pillar.The mech's foot pads were grinding into the concrete cladding of the terrace.There was the sound of motors on emergency burn, but in an off/on/off rhythm that sounded almost musical.The robot looked like a child trying to prop up a teetering bookcase.Huynh turned the camera to look up and up at the sixth floor overhang, almost directly overhead.There were gaps in the concrete, and places where the floors tilted and swayed.It was a building that had the smarts to stabilize itself, even to move a little.But now that intelligence was cut off from location information.Like Timothy Huynh's forklift, the library was doing its best to remain standing and on its own vast scale, it was failing.31    Bob Contemplates Nuclear Carpet Bombing  Bob coasted across the UCSD campus, his landing dart now as slow and quiet as the network munitions that were raining out of the sky.This was a classic network superiority assault, absent significant defenses.There were many many things to do and only seconds to do them, but for these few moments he had a paradoxical sense of security.There weren't many places in the modern world where a human could be as self sufficient  if only temporarily  as when in command of such an assault.Bob Gu's expeditionary group had its own network, its own power supplies, its own sensors.Even if all his remote analysts were to disappear, his marines would still be in business.At the moment, thousands of assault nodes were nestling into trees and bushes, fastening themselves to vehicles and ledges and the sides of buildings.Even before they touched down, they asserted primacy over what civilian network hardware still functioned.That takeover was almost complete.He already had access to almost all the embedded controllers in the area.In combat, those local systems were often unsalvageable.Here, there were a few seconds of intense interrogation, DHS authority was asserted, and he had control.The cars and wearables, the medicals, the viewpoints and financials and police systems, they were all responding.Police and rescue workers were reconnecting via the combat net.Already he could hear their voices picking up the operation.With just a little luck, there would be no loss of life, just a very bad and strange network outage.He would leave the combat net in place, just as in a foreign operation.Over the coming days it would be replaced  not by administrative forces but by the gradual reassertion of the civil system.None of that was really important."The labs.Have they responded?""Yes, sir," came Patrick Westin's reply.He was on the ground with the first squad, near the GenGen main entrance."We have access to the labs' backup security.It's agreeing with the primary, claims the underground is secure, no sign of perver  "  Civilian status alarm: Building Failure .The letters streamed across a corner of Bob's view.The university library was going down.In combat bad things happen, but tonight the cause looked like stupidity plus bad luck  first the rioters making their library "dance," then network outage destroying its smarts.Whatever the reason, people would end up just as dead.Bob threw the problem to his reserve squad, which just now was four hundred meters up, coming down with assorted hardware including the rescue lances.He was vaguely aware of the lance canisters popping their fins, turning to point down into the library.There was the flash of a hundred tiny rockets, and as many hardened nodes were rammed downward through the concrete and steel of the elderly building.Inside, action would be faster than any human attention, the composite flechettes guiding themselves between walls, doing their best to minimize damage to old style wired utilities.Once in place, they would displace the control codes of the dead building system, and attempt to contact the stability servos.Waves of compute and recompute flickered from the squad's status board.Success depended on just what had survived and how fast it could engage the marines' localizer mesh.But rescue was not the mission.His attention was on Patrick Westin   "Understood," Gu said."Make it clear to biotech management and automation: They are to stand down and seal off the labs.Nothing goes in or out. ""Warn and embargo.Yes, sir. "Maybe the Xiang message was some bizarre fraud.Maybe, yeah.He gave Westin another squad and engaged police backup.GDC inspectors would be here from Denver in about thirty minutes and then they could contemplate making a safe entrance into the labs.Bob glided in a silent arc around the south side of the campus.It was time to land himself and his third squad.Where?If this was enemy action, there should be Local Honchos on the enemy side.He popped up the suspect lists.There was the usual population of foreign students.The interesting ones would be interviewed by the end of the evening.The library festivities had been almost a total surprise to the press  so why had that Bollywood contingent just happened to be in town and on site?Surely the Indo European Alliance wouldn't try anything really destructive.But the European cert collapse seemed at the heart of the destruction here in San Diego.The analysts and Bob's own intuition put the Bollywood crew at the top of his interest list.He stalled his dart in a clearing among the eucs, and crunched down on a litter of branches and dead leaves.The third squad dropped at twenty meter intervals east and west from his position.There were shouts and lights from up the hill toward the library.The building was still out of plumb, but stability servos were engaged and  if nothing else failed  it should maintain a standing state.Police vehicles had come alive; direct loudspeakers were making calming announcements.If things worked out, they might even be able to disguise the fact that there had been a military response.Local public safety could pat itself on the back for heading off one of those rare but inevitable system glitches Just ahead was the cluster of game and film people from Bollywood.They had already received a hold notice.None of them were attempting to leave.Just a few words with you, ladies and gentlemen, that's all we want .GenGen said the labs were sealed tight, ready for the proper authorities  when?Ha!The CDC inspectors were ahead of schedule; somehow they had gotten superballistic transport.They'd be on the ground in ten minutes.He had support extending up the chain of command.And downward, too.Some very large, very competent groups were reworking the odds that the labs had been converted to factory of death mode.They agreed that the probability was less than one percent  that is, science fiction.Now his analyst pool was larger than Bob Gu had ever seen, perhaps fifteen percent of the analytical power of the entire U. S.  intelligence community.All that support should have been comforting, yet there were places where the connectivity looked thin.Maybe that was just the way the associations flowed when a crisis was totally bizarre.Others thought it strange, too.He saw lots of paranoid colors.Finally someone got desperate:  <point of order>I have a sanity check.We've lost communication with five percent of our original threat analysts since the revocation attack began.This should be impossible.</point of order> All analysts were internal to the U. S.  intelligence community.If Credit Suisse certificates were necessary for any of those participants to maintain connectivity, then there was at least a design failure and maybe the enemy had been part of Bob's own support staff.There was an immediate counterargument:  <point of order>You're mistaking loss of connectivity for loss of trustability.</point of order>  Then parts of the analyst pool got jammed in the controversy.It was the kind of deadlock that only a miracle worker could quickly untangle and Alice is off in some hospital ward.Another alarm flashed across the lower part of his vision.His combat network lay all across campus now, and it did more than manage communication.Altogether, it was a two thousand meter wide snooper scope, and its report: GenGens private UP/Ex launcher has just gone hot.A counter showed sixty seconds till cargo boosted out of the labs.Even as USMC sensed the launch capacitor charging up, GenGen's own network continued to assure the world that all was safely sealed.Something was trying to break out of GenGen.This is way too much like Asuncion.Bob glanced at the nukes and death fog dispensers and HERFs and HEIRs floating down through 10,000 meters.To the journalists, those weapons should look like random aerobots  but they gave Lieutenant Colonel Robert Gu, Jr., the physical power to annihilate any threat in this corner of the U. S. A.   So what was the Minimum Sufficient Response?Thirty seconds till UP/Ex launch.Chaos still reigned in the land of the analysts.Verified contact with DoD/DHS had been lost.Sometimes decisions come down to one poor slob on the ground.32    The Minimum Sufficient Response  Mus MCog  The Stranger's pdf said that "Mus" was short for "Mus musculus . "Mice!The mouse arrays stretched away into the dark.If anything, the place seemed even bigger than it had the first time Robert had been here.So where to go?Miri hesitated only a second, then ran in the direction of the loudest noises.They trotted down two aisles and over one.Yes!Here was a cabinet with doors swung wide.Pneumos were delivering white cylinders into the crystal forest on top.Miri skidded to a stop in front of the opened doors.Inside the cabinet were glassy racks; it was like some kind of old time snack dispenser.The slots behind the glass were a silvery honeycomb, hundreds of perfect hexagonal cells.Hundreds of tiny faces looked out of the cabinet.Tiny faces with tiny pink eyes, on tiny furry white heads.A high pitched chittering came through the glass."They can't move, they're wedged in so tight," said Miri."Their rear ends must be plugged into little  " She paused, perhaps looking up background on her local cache? "little sucking diapers. "For a little girl who had no interest in pets, there was a strange sadness in her voice."It's a standard thing really. "Miri tore her gaze away from the array of chittering faces."Each of these cabinets has mice cells arranged twenty by thirty by ten.So there are nine more arrays behind this one we're looking at.Hear the crunching noise?Smart Aleck's friends are wrapping up some of them for shipment. ""But where?"None of the mouse cells were moving."That must be in back  "  There was a sound like a goblet breaking.Colored mist floated down from the crystal forest.It barely wet his face.But Miri was standing right beside the cabinet.He reached out and drew her back.Above them, the rest of the fluidics shattered.There was the faint scent of unwashed socks.Robert moved them farther back, stepping on the broken glass."Miri, that could be nerve gas. "Miri was silent for a second and then her voice piped up confidently: "They're trying to scare us.This part of the lab isn't designed for simple poisons. "But Robert remembered the shipping cartridges just arriving here.We were suckered into stopping at this cabinet .Miri slipped out from behind him and ran around the cabinet."Ha!There is a transport tray back here. "By the time he caught up, she was hosing the tray with aerosol glue.Tiny motors whined, unable to load from the cabinet.Miri reached out, patted the almost invisible boundaries of the gel.After a moment the crunching sounds within the cabinet came to an untidy stop."Nothing's going out from here!"They stood, listening and now the familiar sound of cargo prep came from all over the cavern."How many mouse arrays are there, Miri?""Eight hundred and seventeen when I cached the lab description. "She looked up at him."But there's no way Smart Aleck's friends could be using more than a few arrays.There's too much security and too many other projects down here" The sounds of packaging grew louder.Dozens of cabinets were playing the game of Come Stop Me.Miri stepped back and gazed into the distance.The lab was a miniature city, its alleys laid out in a rectangular grid, stretching off into the dark beyond their single street lamp."I've got a good map, but what can we do, Robert?"Robert looked at her map."I came through here with Tommie.We set down gadgets by particular cabinets. ""Yes!Which ones?"Robert looked again at the map floating in the air before him.The place was a maze, and the cabal had come in from a different direction."I, uh  " In 2010, Robert had gotten lost in a shopping mall parking lot.After an hour, he still couldn't find his car; he'd ended up at mall security.That had been the first undeniable encounter with his mental decline.But the new me shouldn't have trouble remembering !"The nearest is two rows thataway, then jog right. "They raced past two aisles, then over one to the right.Almost all the cabinet doors were open, their transport trays working to prep cargo.Miri waved at the pneumo tubes that branched above the cabinets."But see, nothing is actually shipping from here.Where's the next place?"And they were running again, off toward his best guess.Ahead of them something loomed against the ceiling.The GenGen launcher.Miri skittered to a stop, and began shaking her spray can."Which one, Robert?"All the cabinets around her were behaving like suspects."It's still two more rows, then five cabinets down. ""But I thought you said  never mind. "Miri walked past two more rows.Robert followed.She looked up at him."I I'm not sure. "He glared over the tops of the cabinets, trying to orient on the launcher, trying to force memory.She hesitated and then touched his arm."It's okay, Robert.Sometimes, you can't remember.But things will get better for you. ""Wait," he said."I'm sure this is right. "The pneumo tube behind the nearest had just received a shipping cartridge.Mouse boxes were rolling on board."So that means, um"  and Miri's hand slipped from his arm.She looked around and then up at him: "Where are we?"Maybe it hadn't been nerve gas.Maybe it was something worse.And Miri got the bigger dose .Above the cabinet the pneumo hatch had closed.There was a pillowed thud and the cartridge sped away.Another cartridge pulled into the siding above the cabinet.Another batch of mice rolled to meet it.It was out of reach, But I still understand what has to be done .Robert looked down at Miri and did his best to smile and lie."Oh, we're just on a tour, Miri.How about it, would you like to climb on top of that cabinet?"She looked up past him."I'm not a little girl, Robert.I don't climb on other people's property. "Robert nodded, and tried to hold his smile."But Miri, this this is just a game.And if we can stop the white thing with your, your game gun, then we win.You want to win, right?"Now that brought a smile, full of pert intelligence."Of course.Why didn't you say it was a game.Huh.This looks like some kind of bioscience lab.Nice!"She looked at where the transport was sliding the mouse boxes along."So what do you want me to do?"Once she's up there she'll forget all over again ."I'll tell you when you get up there. "He lifted from beneath her arms."Reach up!Grab the edge and I'll push. "Miri giggled, but she did reach up, and Robert did push.She slid through the gap beneath the siding.Her spray can was just inches from the transport tray."Now what?"her voice came down to him.Yes, now what?You go to all the trouble to do something, and then you forget the point.Only this time, he knew the point was something very important.Robert flailed, beginning to panic."Cara, I don't know  "  "Hey, I'm not Cara.My name is Miri!"Not my sister, my granddaughter .Robert stepped back from the cabinet and tried to make sense: "Just shoot the spray can at the moving things, Miri. ""Okay!No problem. "A sound that was pain spiked into his head.Over the cabinet, he had a glimpse of a strange hole that split the side of the UP/Ex launcher.Nothing to do with Miri !The thought had barely registered when he was slammed backwards.Array One was in the GenGen launcher!The stealthed launch vehicle had a good chance of making it out of the the U. S.  cordon.Array Two?Alfred's cameras showed that his strategy with the Gus was working.Somehow they had found the one Mus cabinet that really mattered, but his improvised gas attack was taking effect.The two were moving with a kind of aimless uncertainty.He had time to prep the second load; he could get both out!Mitsuri  > Braun, Vaz: <sm>USMC elint has detected ballistic launcher power up in the labs!What can that be, Alfred?</sm>  Damn USMC.Alfred's analysts hadn't thought American electronic intelligence would be so sensitive.Vaz  > Braun, Mitsuri: <sm>It's just bad luck.The GenGen launcher is cycling through its nightly calibration.</sm> That was a lie, but Alfred had his story ready.He launched a flurry of faked analysis, showering conclusions across Keiko and Gnberk's teams.After the fact, he'd blame the launch on a resurrected Rabbit.Mitsuri  > Braun, Vaz: <sm>But will the Americans believe that?</sm> She popped up some windows, her best estimate of just when and how the USMC might respond to the launch prep.No time for the third cartridge.The GenGen launcher was loaded, the capacitor within forty five seconds of launch.If only the Americans would just dither a bit.Vaz  > Braun, Mitsuri: <sm>I'm finished with cleanup.Heading for rendezvous.</sm> Alfred took a last glance around.In fact, all his checklists were finally green.Across the room, the Orozco boy was sleeping peacefully.He would remember nothing of tonight, and his personal log had been artfully corrupted.Alfred stepped out of the room, and proceeded down the hallway.There was lots of area lighting, the sort of thing you'd expect in a major system failure.Ah !The marines had finally detected his network.They had killed his stealthed aerobot.He still had contact with half a dozen mobiles scattered in the brush to the north.They were hunkered low, mainly trying to be very quiet and still maintain a net.The American assault grid was sweeping the area, destroying them one by one.The USMC mechs drifted down like a kind of black snow, unnoticed by the crowds, and visible to his robots only in the last instant before their destruction.He came out of the stairway, onto the first floor.Ahead was the main entrance.Five seconds till UP/Ex launch!He could imagine the chaos on the American side, losing their top analyst right at the crisis point.This was sniper warfare, brought into modern times, and three more seconds' delay would   His milspec contacts lost transparency and he felt a flash of heat on his face.Alfred dived for the floor.When the shock hit, the building swayed, barely stable in its uncommunicating configuration.He lay still for a moment, watching.That had been a High Energy Infra Red laser, punching straight through the roof of the GenGen lab some two thousand meters away.He had a single direct view, a glimpse of trees silhouetted against a pearly glow, a rising cloud of steam and fog.Part of the haze was zapped vegetation.Most was damage suppression mist, designed to soak up the knife edges of reflected death.The Americans had fired thirty times in less than a second.Glints from those blasts would have splattered kilometers in all directions, invisible to the naked eye, but potentially blinding and blistering those same eyes.A second viewpoint came online.The target hillside looked like a miniature Mauna Loa, a river of flowing rock that slumped down into the hillside.Flashes of light marked the ongoing work of thermal flechettes.Thunder pounded.So the American response had been prompt and decisive, cauterizing and sealing the launcher area, with minimum collateral damage.And all my dreams are ashes .His contacts had transparency again.Alfred came to his feet and ran out of Pilchner Hall.Ahead of him people swirled in panic, first stunned by network failure, now dazzled by HEIR laser glints.Get into the crowd .Even though he was shoulder to shoulder with humanity, for the first time this evening Alfred felt really alone.Some people around him stared upward; some were temporarily blinded.People were crying.Others were counseling the sensible thing: Get under cover, keep your gaze down and away from reflectors.In the midst of network failure, these people were reduced to literal word of mouth.But that word was spreading.More and more people realized that for only the third or fourth time in recent history, their own country was under a military assault.So far none of them had guessed that it was their own military's doing.Alfred kept his head down, his face covered.It wasn't a suspicious posture; hundreds of others were cowering similarly.He shrank his communications down to a fuzzy static that conveyed only a few bits per second and that routed chaotically through his mechs.His ops gear was heavily shielded; to the USMC probes it would seem like just another Epiphany unit struggling to cope with the sudden failure of the public nets.All that might buy him ten more minutes.Long before then, the DHS analyst pool should recover from Alice's collapse and run a retrospective surveillance of the local video streams.Analysts obsessing on a dataset that small were deadly effective.He could imagine their gleeful pursuit: See how the enemy mechs are clumped across from Pilchner Hall?Scan back to early in the evening; who all has been near that building?Why, there's Gu's daughter going in, and a few minutes earlier, an Indian looking fellow doing the same.Scan forward; no action till a minute ago, when that same Indian looking fellow comes running out.Track him forward to the present  and my, my, there he is, trying his damnedest to seem an innocent bystander.In any case, tonight's Indo European operation was beyond all deniability.And that was the minor disaster.For a few seconds, Alfred Vaz drifted in uncharacteristic despair.What about all my years of planning?What about saving the world ?He had heard enough to know that Rabbit's accusations were in the pdf sent to Parker's laptop.Alfred would never complete his research program.Indeed, Rabbit had been the Next Very Bad Thing.The carrot greens in Mumbai had made the point, but I willfully ignored the evidence, so hoping I was to win with my plan .And yet what of Rabbit now?Quite possibly its substantive evidence was indecipherable garbage.Conceivably the minds behind Rabbit were reduced to ignorance.Then maybe, maybe, with all my leverage at External Intelligence, I can survive to try again .Alfred moved back to the edge of the crowd and cautiously reached out to his network.He'd lost his link into the labs.For half a minute there was nothing except a deadly snick and snack that sounded privately in his ears, marking the steady extermination of his little army.There .A route through his surviving devices, back into Pilchner Hall.Tiny windows popped up and he found a viewpoint, a single lab camera that had survived the HEIR attack and looked down upon the Mus array cabinet.The camera had suffered glitter damage, swaths of stuck pixels, but he could see enough.Collateral damage could be your friend; there might be nothing here to prove Rabbit's accusations!The blast from the Americans' attack on the launcher had knocked over his very special cabinet.The last group of mice had fallen along with it.Best of all, the Yanks' thermal bombs had flooded the area around the launcher with molten overburden.The lava had closed off the hole created by the attack, just as intended, but it had not stopped there.The glowing, tarry tide had pushed out along the aisles and piled almost two meters deep in places.Its farthest extent lapped the fallen cabinet and covered all but a corner of that final batch of mouse boxes.There was no sign of the Gus.Before the laser attack, they had been standing just beyond the current destruction.If he'd had more viewpoints, he might have tracked them down  but would that matter?Their jumbled memories were a still a threat, but that was now beyond his control.Suddenly, Alfred realized he was smiling.Strange how in the midst of disaster, he could be pleased that his two most persistent antagonists  not counting Rabbit, may he burn in hell  had probably survived.He was closer to the library now.Civilian rescue workers were in evidence, though the network support was probably provided by the marines.Interrogation teams were not yet in action.And he'd found a backup aero bot to relay through!He got one fresh message before it was lost:  Mitsuri  > Vaz: <sm>Gnberk's analysis is almost complete.Please give us a few more minutes' cover, Alfred.USMC is still focused on the labs.You have a clear run to your Bollywood team.</sm> She marked a map with the cinema team's current location, on the north edge of the crowds, in the eucalyptus.The Bollywood crew and its automation were well prepared for tonight's operation, though the on site people were not knowing participants.Alfred took a final check all around himself.He walked a few paces through the trees and he was in midst of his Bollywood crew."Mr.Ramachandran!We have lost all connectivity. "The video tech's eyes were wide."Everything was fine, but now it is so very terrible!"The crew were experts on the spectacular, but not the real.Alfred shifted into the persona of harried cinema exec."You have your cached videos, do you not?You forwarded the earlier contexts back home, did you not?""Yes, but  " They wanted to rush out from the trees, to help the injured down by the library.That was for the best; in moments, Vaz would be one of the group again.Perhaps the DHS analysts were still in chaos.It would be amusing (and amazing, too) if this cover got him past the USMC cordon and out of California.As he followed his cinema crew out into the open space around the library, he had only one remaining link to his mil net.It was past time to drop that bit of incrimination.But there was still intelligence streaming in.Terrible, chilling words that Alfred would never have been burdened with if he hadn't still been linked."Please.Please don't do this to her.She's just a little girl. "Gu .Alfred searched wildly in his only remaining view.Back in his physical person, he stumbled.The video tech grabbed his elbow, steadying him."Mr.Ramachandran!Are you quite well?Were you blinded in the attack?"Alfred had the presence of mind not to shake her off."I'm sorry, it's just all this destruction.We must help these poor people. ""Yes!But you must stay safe yourself. "The tech guided him down to where the rest of the Bollywood crew was already helping the emergency workers.Her aid gave him cover to look carefully out from his underground viewpoint.The damage to the camera had partially healed; some of the stuck pixels were flickering, and now he could see a little beyond the left of the fallen cabinet The elder Gu was pinned beneath.Lord, where was the other one?I didn't mean for this .He should say nothing, but his body betrayed him:  Anonymous  > Robert Gu: <sm>Where is your little girl?</sm>  "Who is this?"the voice screamed in his ear, then continued more quietly, more desperately."She's right here.Unconscious.And I can't move her out of the way"  Anonymous  > Robert Gu: <sm>I'm sorry.</sm> Alfred couldn't think of anything more to say.Dead, these two might marginally improve his own prospects.He looked angrily away from the viewpoint.Damn me .He had accomplished nothing this night except destroy good people.But how could he safely save them?"Please.Just tell the police.Don't let her burn. "More spikes of overpressure, the sound of a thousand fragile things breaking, of heavy plastic tearing, bones being crushed.Robert didn't really hear it all.The bones getting crushed, that was distracting.Even the follow up explosions and the heat went more or less unnoticed.Robert surfaced from introspection that might as well have been unconsciousness, except that it hurt a lot more.Miri was on her hands and knees.She was wailing."Grandpa!Grandpa!Say something, please .Grandpa!"He twitched a hand, and she grabbed it."I'm so sorry," she said."I didn't mean to knock things over.Are you hurt?"It was one of those questions that had an easy answer.Agony the size of an elephant was sitting on his right leg."Yes," but the rest of a clever answer was lost in the pain.Miri was crying, choking, very un Miri like.She turned and pushed at the cabinet that had him pinned.Robert took a deep breath, but that mainly made him dizzy."The cabinet's too heavy, Miri.Stay back from it. "Why was the air so hot?The steady light was gone.Something like an open furnace glowed beyond the fallen equipment, where the sounds were all of popping and hissing."Cara  Miri !come back from there!"The little girl hesitated.Under the cabinet were the crushed remains of the mouse array that had been about to load.It wasn't going anywhere now.Miri reached down into the broken glass.Robert cricked his neck and saw a tiny face peering back into his, a mouse loose from its suction trap in the array."Oo," Miri's voice squeaked."Hi, little guy. "A laugh mixed with a sob."And you, too.You each get a free pass. "Robert saw more tiny faces as she freed other mice.The heads bobbed this way and that.They didn't seem to see him, and after a moment, they found something that was much more important in the mousely order of things: freedom.They ran around the girl's hands and away from the heat.Now Robert could see what caused the heat.A glowing white gob of syrup dripped over the wreckage, hissed into redness as it oozed down the side of the fallen cabinet.Cara gave a panicked cry and came back to him."What is that?"The hissing and spattering.If it could make it over that barrier, it must be dammed up several feet deep."I don't know, but you've got to get away. ""Yes!Come on!"The girl pulled at his shoulders.He pushed with her, ignoring the tearing pain in his leg.That moved him four or five inches; then he was stuck more solidly than before.And now the heat was even more distracting than the crushed leg.Robert's mind hopped from one horror to the other, trying to keep its sanity.He looked across at his crying sister."I'm sorry I made you cry, Cara. "She just cried harder."You've got to run now. "She didn't reply, but the crying stopped.She looked at him, uncomprehending, then slid back from the furnace heat.Go!Go !But then she said, "I don't feel good," and lay down just beyond his reach.Robert looked back at the oozing rock.It had swamped the bottom of the cabinet.Another inch or two and it would slop onto his little sister.He reached out, snagged a long shard of  ceramic?and wedged it against the glowing tide.There were more explosions, but not so loud.Up close there was just the smell and sound of things cooking.He tried to remember how he had come to be here.Someone had done this to him and Cara, and surely they must be listening now."Please," he said into the glowing dark."Please don't do this to her.She's just a little girl. "No reply, just the terrible sounds, and the pain.And then the strangest thing, letters scrolling across his gaze:  Anonymous  > Robert Gu: <sm>Where is your little girl?</sm>  "Who is this?She's right here.Unconscious.And I can't move her out of the way . "Anonymous  > Robert Gu: <sm>I'm sorry.</sm>  He waited, saw nothing more."Please.Just tell the police.Don't let her burn. "But the silent watcher was gone.Cara lay unmoving.Can't she feel the heat ?It took everything he had to hold the shard in place.Then: "Professor Gu?Is that you?"It was some pestering student!There were so many afterimages, he couldn't be sure, but someone was there, partly submerged in the molten ooze."It's me, Zulfi Sharif, sir. "That name was familiar, a weaselly arrogant student.But now his skin wasn't green.That meant something, didn't it?"I've been trying for some hours to call you, sir.It's never been this bad before.I I fear I may have been truly hijacked.I'm so sorry. "He was mostly submerged in the glowing rock.A ghost."You're injured!"said the ghost."Call the police," said Robert."Yes, sir!But where are you?Never mind, I see!I'll get help straight  "  The glowing rock dribbled over Robert's makeshift dam, onto his arm.He descended into a pit of mindless pain.33    Freedom on a Very Long Leash  The New Annex to Crick's Clinic was less than five years old, but the spirit of the place was straight out of the last century, when hospitals were great imposing places where people had to go for a chance at survival.There was still some need for such places: the most extreme intensive care units were not something you could pack into a first aid box and sell to home users.And of course, there were always tragic cases of incurable, debilitating diseases; some small portion of humanity might always end up in extended care nursing homes.The New Annex satisfied certain other needs.Those occurred to Lieutenant Colonel Robert Gu, Jr., every day when he drove onto the hospital grounds.Every day since the debacle at UCSD, he'd pull into the Crick's traffic circle, get out, and look down along the cliffs and beaches toward La Jolla.The clinic was just a short hike up the hill from some of the most fashionable resort properties in the world.Just a few miles inland were the biotech labs that ringed UCSD, perhaps the most prestigious source of medical magic in the world.Of course, those labs could have been on the other side of the world for all that their location made any real difference.But psychologically and traditionally, this joint nearness to resort luxury and magical cure was a lure for the very richest of the very ill.Bob Gu's wife, daughter, and father were not stuck here because they were rich.Once you walked past the imposing  and totally real  main entrance, you had privacy.In this case, the privacy was a combination of the clinic's basic design and the fact that Uncle Sam had taken a special interest in certain patients.What better place to keep sensitive cases hidden from contact than in a resort hospital.The press flitted around beyond the walls and speculated  without having grounds for a civil liberties complaint.It could be a very good cover.Bob hesitated just outside the main entrance.Oh Alice !For years, he had lived in fear that JITT would take her.For years, he and she had fought about the limits of duty and honor, and the meaning of Chicago.Now the long imagined worst had happened and he found himself quite unprepared.He visited her every day.The doctors were not encouraging.Alice Gu was stuck under more layers of JITT than these guys had ever seen.So what did they know?Alice was conscious.She talked to him, desperate gibberish.He held her in his arms and begged her to come back.For unlike Dad and Miri, Alice was not a federal detainee.Alice was a prisoner in her own mind.Today Bob had an official assignment at Crick's.The last of the detainee interrogations  that is, the last of the debriefings  were complete.Dad was scheduled to be awake by noon, Miri an hour later.Bob could spend some time with them, in the virtual company of Eve Mallory, a DHS officer who fronted for the investigation teams.At 1200 hours, Bob was standing in front of a very old fashioned looking wooden door.By now he knew that such things were never faked at Crick's.And he'd have to turn the doorknob if he wanted to go in.Eve  > Bob: <sm>We're especially interested in this interview, Colonel.But keep it short.Stick to the points in our memo.</sm>  Bob nodded.For a moment he didn't know who he was most angry at, his father or the jerks from DHS.He contented himself with pulling the door open without knocking, and stepping abruptly into the hospital suite.Robert Gu, Sr., was pacing the windowless room like a caged teenager.You'd never guess he'd recently had one leg crushed and the other fractured; the docs were good at fixing that kind of thing.As for the rest, well, his burns were hidden by medical pajamas.The old man's gaze snapped up as Bob came in the room, but his words were more desperate than angry."Son!Is Miri okay?"Eve  > Bob: <sm>Speak up, Colonel.You can tell him everything about your daughter.</sm>  " Miri is fine, Dad. "He waved at the plush chairs by the table at the side of the suite.But the old man just kept bouncing around the room."Thank God, thank God.The last I remember was the heat and lava crawling toward her. "He looked down at his pajamas, and suddenly seemed very distracted by what he saw."You're at Crick's in La Jolla, Dad.Miri wasn't hurt in the fire.Your left arm was pretty much destroyed. "The flesh had burned down to the bone in places, burned all the way through the lower forearm.Robert Senior touched the loose sleeve."Yes, the doctors told me. "He turned and dropped into one of the chairs."That's about all they've told me.You're sure Miri's okay?You saw her?"The old man never behaved like this.There was strain all around his eyes.Or maybe he's just reacting to the look on my face .Bob sat down across from this father."I've seen her.I'll be talking to her later this afternoon.Her worst problem is some mental confusion about what happened in the labs. ""Oh. "Then more softly, "Oh. "He sat mulling the news, and then he was fidgeting again."How long have I been out?There's so much you need to know, Bob Maybe you should get some of your law enforcement buddies in here. "Eve  > Bob: <sm>So he doesn't remember the debrief?
