It had, of course, taken a beating during the Hard Rain, and resumed erupting for a while, but had now been dormant for about seven hundred years.In any case the Cayambe Socket had been built well clear of its most active vents, placing the volcanos summit, which was once again snow covered, far enough away that it could be admired from any windows on Cradle that happened to be aimed in the right direction.The Crows Nests tower afforded views in almost all directions, and so Tyuratam Lake, standing behind his bar two days later, polishing a glass with a towel, was able to look up between two tap handles and see the summit glide into view and then seemingly rise upward from the horizon as Cradle was lowered gingerly into its socket.Klaxons sounded all over Cradle and across the earthbound ring city that was now coming into view beyond its windscreens.Out of habit Ty stuffed the towel into the pocket of his trousers, letting it dangle down his leg, and reached out to steady himself against the bar.The underside of Cradle and the matching surface below it had been designed so that a disk of air would be trapped between them during the final meter of the descent, and act as a cushion.This was allowed to escape through a picket fence of vents, aimed upward around the periphery of Cradle, and so final docking was, as usual, signaled by a roar of escaping air and plumes of condensed humidity jetting upward into the blue sky over the Andes.The mildest of lurches caused stored glasses and tableware to clink together in cabinets all over the bar.The klaxons and the vents went silent at the same time.Through the bars windows, which Ty had left cracked open, he could hear the customary smattering of applause rising up from the stony streets of Capitol Hill.He checked his timepiece.A few politicians and generals, who had leaned back from their breakfasts to observe the docking and admire the profile of Cayambe Volcano, bent forward again, picked up their forks, and resumed their conversations.Cradle had just become the largest city on New Earth, and was scheduled to remain so for twenty four hours.Its system of windscreens, built to shield the city from the blast created by its movement through the atmosphere, now seemed more like a barbican, thrown up in some past age to defend an old city, but now merely a historical curiosity and a dividing line between neighborhoods.Other than keeping a curious eye on all comings and goings through Cradles eight gates, Quarantine made no effort to control the mingling of populations.Cradles visits were so brief that to stop, examine, and question everyone passing between it and the sockets would have rendered the whole visit pointless.Thanks to this relaxed policy, the time it took for an average pedestrian to get from the nearest of the eight gates to the Crows Nest was nine minutes.The first customer showed up in seven, breathing somewhat heavily, and requested a beer.Ty did not recognize him, but the next two faces that came in the door, thirty seconds later, were familiar.During the next quarter of an hour, the place filled up with a mixture of regulars (from Cradle and Cayambe alike) and curiosity seekers.Tys staff, well accustomed to these surges, began to open up back rooms.Extra cooks came up through one of the back entrances and began to make use of mise en place that had been prepped the night before.Everything, in other words, ran smoothly.Which was how Ty liked it.The ability of the Crows Nest to accommodate a socket surge with no intervention from Ty, other than polishing a glass, was, in a sense, his lifes work.He had done every job it was possible to do in this place, from floor mopper on upward, and learned over time to select and delegate the work to others who could do it better.He had advanced, in other words, to higher levels of mental activity while always doing enough of the floor mopping and glass polishing to remain in physical contact with the business of the bar and in human contact with the staff.His real jobthe job that the Owners paid him forwas to be an observer of the human condition as it was so richly displayed from day to day within these walls.He was also a judicious manipulator of the human condition in the sense of occasionally throwing people out, telling others to settle down in a manner so smooth and humorous that they didnt know theyd been told, and making certain others feel welcome when they seemed ill at ease.All of that was as fundamental to the operation of a bar as mopping the floor.Others on his staff could do such things almost as well as he.Ty had, in other words, developed the Crows Nest into a sufficiently healthy and robust organism that it was possible for him to disappear for weeks, sometimes even months, without inflicting serious damage.In some ways, his occasional vacations actually did more good than harm, in the sense that when he came back he would commonly find that certain members of the staff had risen to the occasion and become more complete and effective human beings in his absence.He was quite certain that he could walk away from the bar forever now and that it would not really miss him.But he was unlikely to do any such thing because it was literally his homehe lived in an apartment on the court behind itand because the Owners preferred that he stay.And the Owners were among the very few members of all the human races about whose opinions Tyuratam Lake actually gave a damn.They had pointed out to him that even a years leave of absence, should he choose to take one, would benefit the Crows Nest, in the sense that he would return to it with fresh eyes and immediately see how beneficial changes might be made.But he suspected that the true value of the business, in the eyes of the Owners, was not the return it delivered on capital.That was probably close to zero.They might even be running a huge loss, for all he knew.Every month Ty did the books and boiled all the numbers down to a single sheet of paper that he took to the Bolt Hole and slid across the table to the Owners representative.They never said much about it.Once a year, a question might be asked about one of the numbers, just as a way of letting him know that they were paying attention.But the Owners really valued the Crows Nest partly as a cultural institution and partly because it gave them access to the sort of information about the lives, thoughts, and deeds of important persons that could only be had in a bar.He did not care for elaborate goodbyes, particularly in a professional context where a fussy leave taking might suggest that his going away was a big dealimplying that the staff might not be up to the job of keeping the business running.And so after a few minutes had passed and he had exchanged looks, words, and jokes with a few leading citizens and well known characters of Cayambejust long enough to let it be known that he was herehe pulled the towel from his pocket, wiped his hands, and tossed it into the laundry chute beneath the bar.He lingered for a moment just to satisfy himself that the chute was not jammed.But it never was.Satisfied, he edged around the corner of the bar and walked to a table by the windows where Ariane, Kath Two, and Beled were pushing empty plates away, having just concluded a hearty breakfast.Ty himself had eaten light, an hour ago, as was his habit when he expected to spend a good part of the day airborne.Itll be taken care of, he remarked, and got perfunctory thank yous from the Moiran and the Teklan.Ariane gave him what he could only guess was meant to be some kind of penetrating look, and nodded.The busy minds of Julians exhausted Ty and he tried to avoid getting drawn into their labyrinthine ways of thinking.Perhaps this Ariane had used whatever connections she had in the intelligence world to investigate him and the Owners, and was drawing all sorts of conclusionsprobably wrong onesabout what motivated him to give the Seven free drinks and meals.For it was obvious to Ty that Ariane worked in intelligence.He had seen many such people during the war and he knew their ways.By now the others could navigate around the Crows Nest, but there was an expectation that he would lead the way.This derived partly from the fact that it was, after all, his establishment.But even had they been dropped into some completely random location on the surface they would have looked to him to take point because that, for better or worse, was what Dinans did.Answering to a similar racial expectation, Beled took up the rear.This was partly because his ingrained habits of courtesy and discipline obliged him to say You first to all the others, and partly so he would wheel about and engage any foes who might assault the rear of the formation.Ty moved briskly to reduce the chance that he would be buttonholed by some prematurely drunk member of the Cayambe Chamber of Comersants.Within a few moments they had passed into a section of the bar that had not yet been opened to visitors, and thence proceeded down twisting stairways scarcely wide enough to accommodate Beleds shoulders until they reached the triangular courtyard in the center of the compound.Its tropical flowers were glowing like gems in the hard white light of the Andes.Four small cabs awaited them near the big gate that gave out onto the street.Cradle was almost devoid of four wheeled vehicles when it was aloft, but whenever it was socketed, the place was invaded within minutes by swarms of whatever rolling stock was skinny enough to negotiate its streets.Some of these moved goods, transshipping them from the Eye to customers on the surface, or importing the produce of New Earth to Cradle.Others carried passengers on errands to the ring city and its hinterlands.One of the cabs was already occupied by Doc and Memmie, as could be inferred by the cases of Docs support infrastructure strapped to its roof rack and the grabb poised to scuttle after it.Bard had climbed into the second cab and was slouched down low.Neoanders were rare enough to draw notice and arouse curiosity in a manner that Ariane quite clearly did not want.He had been keeping to himself in his private room.Ariane climbed into the cab with him.It went without saying that it would be easiest for all concerned if Beled took up a whole cab by himself, and so he did that.Ty and Kath Two got into the last one.After Doc and Memmies cab departed, a few minutes passed before Ariane gave her driver the go ahead.Ty shifted impatiently in his seat, slightly jostling Kath Two.Cradle compliant cabs did not have a lot of shoulder room.What do you think shes doing?Kath Two asked.Just making conversation.They both knew perfectly well what she was doing.A caravan of four, leaving the Crows Nest and not coming backtoo conspicuous for her taste, Ty said.At least theres no question of getting lost, Kath Two remarked.She ducked her head low so that she could peer out the window and get a look at the northern sky beyond the city.The sun shafted in and made her eyes glow, picking out glints of yellow in irises that were mostly green and brown.She didnt have the crazy yellow cat eyes of some Moirans, but there was a bit of that in her ancestral tree.She knew Ty was looking at her but she didnt let on to being self conscious, which he approved of.She was looking, of course, at the Aitken loop that was their immediate destination.Assuming that it was still operatingand shed have reacted differently had it gone downit was rising up out of a mostly subterranean flynk barn on the towns outskirts, surrounded by hangars and maintenance facilities for aircraft that ranged up and down the length of the Andes.You have everything you need?Ty asked.Itll be a long day for you.Itll go by in no time, Kath Two demurred, because Ill be busy.Itll be long for you because youll be bored.Did you bring a book?People are my books, Ty said.But I did bring a couple, in case the people all go to sleep.It was meant as a light joke but he saw her face snag on it, wondering if he was trying to make a racial crack about Moirans.An annoying habit that many people seem to have, he added.Apparently a mere two cab caravan was not enough to trigger Arianes anxieties, and so the one carrying Beled and the one carrying Ty and Kath Two departed in tandem and began to work their way through streets crowded with pedestrians.They could have done the first part of it more quickly on foot, but when they passed out through the vehicular gate and into the streets of Cayambe, things opened up quite a bit and they were able to use streets that had been designed specifically for four wheelers.The place seemed dustier than Ty remembered, or maybe he was just seeing it through visitors eyes.Cradle sophisticates would see its menagerie of robots as comically oversized and ramshackle, its people as a lot of jumped up backwoodsmen.Tys kind of people, in other words.The sort of person whose ancestors had stayed in the habitat ring and played by the rules, patiently awaiting the moment when Doc, or some successor of his, would cut the ribbon on New Earth and allow settlers to flood in, had complicated feelings about Sooners and Indigens.On the one hand they were viewed as sharp operators.Tricksters.At the same time they were isolated bumpkins.Ty had learned early how to play both sides of the image.A stranger from the ring who took you for a wide eyed rube would spill a lot of information before he came to understand the truth, and one who expected you to play tricks on him would let down his guard at the first show of honesty and plain dealings.IF YOU TOOK A LARGE NUMBER OF FLYNKSFLYING, AUTONOMOUS chain linksand joined them together into a long chain, and connected its ends to make it into a continuous loop, and then got the whole loop moving through the air like a train composed of little airplanes, each using its stubby winglets to generate its share of the lift, then you had a thing known as an aitrain, pronounced the way a resident of Old New York would have said A train.The concept was old enough that its etymology had been obscured by time.It might have been air train with the first r elided, or a contraction of Aitken train.Sometimes, as here, it was a captive aitrain, passing continuously through a fixed installation on the ground and rising from there to a considerable altitude before reversing direction and plunging back down for another circuit.But aitrains could also fly freely in the air: a technology crazy enough that it had become associated with the Adan big brains known as Jinns, or Ghenis, and tended to be used only by Red.Presumably at Arianes behest, they took a circuitous route to the aitrain station, swinging wide around the hangar with the big Q on its roof.The caravan collected itself in an unmarked hangar on the edge of the military zone, which Ty viewed as a classic example of the not quite Survey and not quite military style.There were no human personnel, just two copies of a specialized kind of grabb posted at each of the wingtips of a big glider, nominal capacity ten.Adequate room for a Seven, or so Ty thought until he climbed aboard and found it preloaded with mysterious equipment cases.Kath Two made a slow walk around the glider and then climbed aboard, pulled the door shut, and crawled forward onto the couch where she would spend the journey resting on her belly.Everyone else looked away politely as she got her urine collection system squared away.In front of her was the glass dome, more than a meter in diameter, that served as the aircrafts nose.Beled and Bard took opposite window seats in the back row of the passenger compartment.Doc sat in the front row, on the aisle, where he would have the best view forward over Kath Twos backside and out the dome.Memmie sat in the window seat next to him and Ariane grabbed the seat across the aisle from him.Ty had his pick of a few seats in the midsection.He had noticed Arianes preference for always sitting next to Doc.Were he a jealous sort, or the kind of person who liked having long conversations with eminent scientists, hed have resented the way she monopolized him.Instead he just found it kind of interesting, and wondered whether Doc would shoo her off at some point so that he could at long last talk to someone else.The glider began moving around, presumably because Kath Two had told the grabbs holding its wingtips to take it somewhere.The nose tilted down as they descended a ramp into the flynk barn.This was a noisy warren in which thousands of identical robots were hustling around in a manner that looked chaotic and organized at the same time, much like the impression youd get staring into a beehive.For an earthbound loop system like this one, the flynks had to be aerodynamic, so their inner skeletons were hidden beneath thin plastic fairings, making them into blunt nosed cylinders, like large bullets, with a little waist in the midsection to give the universal joint freedom to bend this way and that.Each of these flynks was about half a meter in diameter and two meters long and weighed about twice what a large human weighed.Lying on the floor, they were helpless, and so grabbs moved them around by getting them aimed in the right direction and then rolling them about like barrels, creating a scene that looked a little like a swarm of dung beetles going about their work.The general point of the operation seemed to be to channel the flynks in the direction of troughs where they would naturally line up.This enabled them to couple themselves together into short segments of chain.The troughs had roller bearings that made it easy for chain segments to slide forward and back, like trains in a switching yard, and in this manner chain segments could be added to or subtracted from the aitrain while it was operating.Which was to say, while the system was shooting it straight up into the air at high velocity and sucking it back in on the down leg.In one of those easy for machines, inconceivable for humans operations, a coupler on the gliders nose ended up being snapped to the tail end of a flynk chain that presently got concatenated onto the up leg.Rapidly brought up to speed while still in the confines of the flynk barn, the glider pitched upward sharply as it emerged into the light.It began to rise vertically, drawn behind the chain.Nothing was connected to the gliders tailthe loop had been deliberately severedand so the system had ceased being an Aitken loop.It was now a vertical bullwhip, accelerating the glider to higher and higher velocity as the Knickstelle at its apex propagated skyward.Lying now on his back, staring straight up over Kath Twos shoulders, Ty could see small aerodynamic vanes that had deployed from the fuselage of the flynk ahead of them.These, like all the other vanes on all the other thousands of flynks in the chain, effected tiny adjustments to keep the whip trimmed in just the right configuration.The result, a few moments later, was that the glider came snapping over the top just as its connection to the last flynk was severed.In a few seconds it had been hauled two thousand meters straight up and let go with a velocity of a few hundred kilometers per hour.Meanwhile, every other flynk in the chain had decoupled itself fore and aft, causing the entire chain to disintegrate into a linear cloud of identical fragments, each headed in a different direction.Each flynk, sensing that it was aloft and alone, automatically deployed large tail vanes that turned it from a bullet into a badminton shuttlecock.The flynks rapidly slowed down to their terminal velocity, turned nose down, and began to fall toward the ground.A slight canting of the vanes caused them to begin spinning like maple seeds, further slowing their descent, and in this manner the entire swarm began to descend in the direction of an empty lot adjacent to the flynk barn.All of which had to be pictured in Tys minds eye, since they already had left it far behind.But he had seen it many times, as it was one of the basic operations carried out many times a day at any aitrain port.The same flynks, organized in a different way, might just as easily have effected a high altitude rendezvous with an orbiting bolo, or collected an aircraft and drawn it back downward to safe haven in the barn.The first half hour of the flight was a little unsettling to Tys stomach as Kath Two made a few sudden maneuvers, perhaps because she had sensed good air in one direction or bad in another.People who were accustomed to flight in powered aircraft frequently had trouble adjusting to the unpredictability of gliders, but Ty, who had done it before, understood that Kath Two was just hunting for the right way to inject them into the mountain wave hovering invisibly in the upper atmosphere above the Andes crest.He knew she had found it when the juking and jiving stopped and the back of the seat pressed him forward with palpable acceleration.They were in level, steady flight now, proceeding north at something like three hundred kilometers per hour.Kath Twos task henceforth would be to look far into their future with her lidar enhanced sensorium and make small adjustments needed to dodge pockets of rough air.Everyone became somewhat listless and fell to reading books or napping.Sitting a couple of rows behind Ty, occupying most of a pair of seats, was Beled Tomov.He was in an attitude of repose, whitish blue eyes half closed and unfocused, but aimed generally out the window.He was probably trying to maintain a visual fix on the horizon as a way to stave off motion sickness.In any case he did not look to be in a social mood.Over a series of meals and drinks since the initial meeting of the Seven, Ty had been able to piece together a vague picture of the mission that Kath Two and Beled had recently completed in Beringia.Apparently, Beled had been trying to maintain some kind of threadbare cover story about being Survey.Fortunately, this had now been dispensed with and Doc was openly addressing him as Lieutenant Tomov.Military were divided into three broad groups generally known as Button Pushers, Ground Pounders, and Snake Eaters.Beled clearly was no Button Pusher.That was the only branch of the service where Ivyns, and even Camites, were present in any numbers.That narrowed it down to Ground Pounder or Snake Eater.He seemed too elite to be a Ground Pounder: the sort of regular troops who would be deployed in large formations along borders on the surface.Oh, it wasnt out of the question.He might simply have been an unusually big and strong GP.But more likely he was a Snake Eater, which was to say a former GP who had been promoted into one of a few special purpose branches.Those had informal names too: Queeds (Quarantine Enforcement and Detention), Feelies (Forward Intelligence), and Zerks (a contraction of Berserkers).Queeds had by far the lowest status.They were looked at somewhat askance because of their status as what amounted to riot police, called in to quell domestic disturbances but more often just posted near gates to remind people not to make trouble.Popular estimates of their intelligence and moral fiber were none too generous.Ty could not see why such a person would have been chosen for the Seven, and so he deemed it unlikely.Forward Intelligence was a better fit, and an obvious guess since Ty already knew that Beled had very recently been called back from the surface, where he had been moving about on what sounded like a classic Feely kind of mission.Reference had been made to the fact that Beled had passed near at least one RIZ and observed its inhabitants without himself being seen, which was just the sort of thing Feelies were supposed to be good at.The only thing that prevented Ty from simply pigeonholing Beled as a classic Feely was his physique.Because of that, he must allow for the outside chance that Beled Tomov was a Zerk.But only an outside chance, because, contrary to their image in popular entertainment, Zerks were not all huge and muscular.Most of them looked reasonably normal, if unusually fit.The Zerks were not a single unitary force but a mosaic of small units, each of which was trained and equipped for a special type of activity such as fighting in space suits in zero gee, fighting underwater, being dropped from the sky in pods, or cloak and dagger urban shenanigans.Thus far Beled Tomov had not shown any clear signs of such specialization.The steps he was taking to avoid motion sickness suggested that he was not accustomed to airborne work.If Ty had to guess, hed say that this man had started out as a Ground Pounder, spent a lot of time on the surface in a border zone, distinguished himself, been promoted from the ranks, and ended up in some kind of tiny Zerk unit that specialized in sneaking around on the surface.The only one showing signs of life was Langobard.This stood to reason, since he had been confined to quarters for a few days.Ty moved back, sat next to him, and asked him about his clans vineyard in Antimer.It was a wholly reasonable line of inquiry from a Cradle bartender, but both men probably understood that it was just an icebreaker.Bard was more than happy to play along, and talked for a while about the volcanic soil of his homeland, how the TerReForm had converted it, in the last few centuries, from a dead mineral rubble to an ecosystem, and how his grandparents had smuggled grapevines down from various botanical gardens in both Blue and Red and suffered through various misadventures on their way to figuring out that certain soil amendments were needed to make it work.Implicit in that story was that they must have been working with some people who werent Neoanders.Smuggling unauthorized plant species down to the surface would have been dicey enough, for members of that race, if done entirely within Red.On the Blue side of things, Neoanders would have been absurdly conspicuous, liable to being detained and searched by the Q even when they werent engaged in illegal activity.When Ty pointed that out, Bard said yes while shaking his head no, as if to say, But of course, what you are saying is obvious.He went on to explain that his people, stationed for over a decade along a border that was entirely peaceful, had over time established cordial relationships with their opposite numbers on the Blue side of the line, which had begun with swapping supplies to enliven their respective diets and progressed to picnics, athletic competitions, and other ways of relieving the boredom.The Teklans (he reported with a glance toward the slumbering Beled) had been standoffishbut his people had always had good relations with Dinans.Ty saw no reason to doubt the historical truth of this remark, but he understood that Bard meant it on another level as well: as an overture to Ty, which might lead to friendship.Certainly there were grounds, other than that, for the Dinan and the Neoander to understand each other.Both were Indigens who had found lives in the more sophisticated environment of Cradle but still maintained connections to the surface: connections that were second nature to them, but, in the context of the habitat ring at large, were fantastically unusual.Well, thats good, Ty said.I was raised to be scared to death of your lot.Of course you were.How far from the border did you grow up?By this, Bard meant the place where 166 Thirty cut across Beringia: a boundary zone similar to that farther south in Antimer.The west or Red side of it corresponded roughly to what had once been Siberia and the east or Blue side to Alaska.The irony being that the two continents had been rejoined by the Hard Rain but then sundered by an imaginary line.Oh, we moved about, Ty said.Remember, unlike your folk, we lacked a legitimate excuse for being there.The Neoanders huge, highly expressive features reflected a bit of disappointment that his question hadnt really been answered.Too close to the line, and we were at risk of being arrested by the Blues stationed thereor being cooked and eaten by Neoander raiding parties, Ty cracked.It was one of those jokes that was in such exceedingly poor taste that it could go either way: make Bard an enemy for life, or convince him that Ty really did understand.As a conversational gambit it was somewhat risky.But, on the other hand, Ty was cooped up on a glider with six strangers en route to a mission that hadnt been explained yet.The cargo hold had been preloaded with unmarked cases, some of which obviously contained weapons.At least three of the SevenBeled, Langobard, and Tyuratamknew how to use them, and Kath Twos Survey training had included a short course on how to use a kat in a pinch.It was not the time or the place for the sorts of elaborate conversational niceties and courtship dances that might be expected in, say, an old private club on Cradle.More important was to get things sorted in a hurry.Bard laughed and shook his head.Why not move farther east then?he asked.Get away from those threats altogether.Because the early Sooner toeholds werent really sustainable and we had to trade with Blues for vitamins.Under the table, I presume.Of course.What did you give them in return?Your women?It was fair payback for the cooked and eaten joke: Bard testing him in return.Ty took it in stride.They were scared of our women.Happy Dinahsday, by the way.Is it Dinahsday?Ive lost track.But it didnt matter.Having made a crack about Dinan women, Bard had to pay respect to their Eve.No, Ty continued, to answer your question, its the same thing that led your ancestors to trade victuals across the line.A craving for greater variety in the diet, Bard said.More powerful in the end than sex.Yes.Early on we had nothing more to offer them than fresh vegetables.Up there?!Summer days are longyou can grow a lot in a crude plastic greenhouse.Later, as the ecosystem spun up, it was meat from small animals, berries, and a few luxury goods like furs.A thought occurred to Bard.And how far would your people range in search for those things?He was referring, as Ty understood, to Kath Twos story about the camouflaged Indigen in the trees.For she had by now shared this with the others.Not that far, Ty said.IN THE VAST AND ANCIENT UNDERTAKING CALLED THE TERREFORM, Survey was a small department, sometimes viewed as a receptacle for eccentric or troublesome personnel.Its outposts were small and, because they needed to be sited along rapidly changing frontiers, makeshift and temporary.TerReForm bases, by contrast, tended to be much larger and more permanent.As a rule they were sited on islands off the coasts of continents.There was a logical scientific reason for doing it thus, but as Doc himself freely admitted, the real reason was more aesthetic and symbolic.Most of the sophisticated genetic sequencing laboratories, and the staff needed to make them work, were up in the ring, where space was tight but brains were plentiful.TerReForm installations on the surface were of a more practical character, and they sprawled over territory in a way that looked extravagant and unruly to habitat dwellers.They combined the functions of botanical garden, experimental farm, arboretum, zoo, and microbiology lab.Small samples, cuttings, or populations of bugs, plants, or beasts that had been developed and nurtured on the ring were dropped in such places to be propagated and observed before being shipped in quantity to the biomes where they would be allowed to run wild.Placing the bases on islands was a simple method for limiting the spread of plants and animals that had escaped from their assigned habitats.It was very far from being foolproof, but it was simple, easy, and fairly effective: an easy fit, in other words, for the Get It Done school.The TerReForm base for the Central American isthmus was Magdalena.This was a large island in about the same place as the former Islas Maras.Pre Zero, this had been an archipelago off the west coast of Mexico, somewhat south of the tip of Baja California.The Hard Rain had reforged it into a single island with a few rocks and reefs scattered around, useful for propagating life that was designed to occupy shallow water and tidal zones.The lack of a moon meant that New Earths tides were caused entirely by the gravity of the sun, which made them weaker and more closely synchronized with the cycle of night and day.Because tidal zones were thought to have disproportionate importance to the ecosystems of land and sea alike, much TerReForm brainpower had been focused on them, and the low lying banks of wave washed rubble around Magdalena had become spawning grounds, not just for fish and birds and crustaceans, but for researchers with advanced degrees.Doc himself had spent ten years of his life here, sloshing through tide pools with buckets and shovels.Ty would not have thought it possible, but Kath Two got them there with a little bit of daylight to spare, in a single days flying.Around midday she mumbled something about a noteworthy jet stream perturbation, and the possibility (which to her was apparently quite enticing) of catching a stratospheric wave.To Ty it might as well have been eye of newt, and toe of frog, wool of bat, and tongue of dog.Her next words, though, had been admirably clear: Hang on.Drinks were spilled and barf bags reached for all around the cabin.Oxygen masks dropped from the ceiling as the glider shot up through the tropopause, and the fuselage creaked and keened as Kath Two trimmed it to peel energy from some kind of fascinating upper atmosphere anomaly.Several hours later, when, after another understated warning, she banked it nearly upside down and let it dive toward the faintly wrinkled blue water of the Pacific, they had covered many hundreds of kilometers beyond their original flight plan, and their only real problem was dumping energy so that they could make a landing, as opposed to a crater, on Magdalena.The place had a flynk barn, but the loop wasnt operating at the moment, and anyway there was no reason to attempt a midair rendezvous with a flying chain when a simple airstrip was available nearby.An impressive whine sounded through the airframe as Kath Two turned on a pair of turbines in its belly that took in air through scoops and converted its energy to electrical power that was then stored.The next time the glider took off, the whole system could be run backward, driving the turbines as jets to provide some initial energy boost.It wasnt necessary, but it was a way to slow the glider down, and it was a courtesy for the next pilot.Owing to some low banks of clouds, not much about the last phase of the flight made sense to its passengers, but at length the glider shot out the bottom of that weather system and suddenly Magdalena was below them, lit up on its west side by the last of the setting sun.On the purple skin of the sea, thin arcs of foam materialized as incoming wave fronts sensed the bottom or wrapped around submerged reefs.Doc had moved to a window seat so that he could peer down at his old stomping grounds, and in the suddenly quiet cabin Ty was able to hear him remarking on various installations along the shore.Most of these just looked to Ty like picket lines of pilings and ragged shanties of fishnet and plastic.But as Ty had been explaining to Langobard earlier, his Sooner ancestors had made a living from meaner tech than that, and so he did not think less of the scientists who had built them.The wildlife habitats, arboretums, and gardens tiling Magdalenas western slopes looked a little closer to what a member of the general public might expect from a major TerReForm base, and the buildings clustered at the end of the airstrip were as respectable a town as it was possible to find anywhere on the surface.Ramps, stairs, and a long zigzagging road connected it to a harbor a couple of hundred meters below, where, at a glance, perhaps eight significant vessels, a giant flying boat called an ark, and many smaller boats were moored.They enjoyed a brief panorama of the waterfront before the final bank around and approach took them out of view behind some hills.After the excitements of the flight, the landing was dull, and Ty suspected that Kath Two had just turned it over to an algorithm.The glider touched down on the single wheel that peeked out from the underside of its fuselage.Before it had slowed to the point where it might teeter sideways, a couple of specialized high speed grabbs had caught up with it, moving in the somewhat disturbing prancing/scuttling gait that they used at such times, and caught hold of the wingtips.They escorted it to a field of tie downs off to the side of the airstrip.Kath Two, relieved of responsibility, rolled over onto her back, stretched, and rubbed her eyes.Ty was eager to disembark, but he knew that Doc would be the first out the door.He knew this because he could see a considerable welcoming party walk jogging toward them.Ariane was looking at the same thing.Ty did not understand why she would be so secretive on Cradle and in Cayambe, only to land them in the one location on the surface where Doc was most famous.He guessed she had her reasons, worked out in painstaking detail and never to be shared with the likes of Ty.They had to land somewhere en route to whatever their final destination was, and perhaps TerReForm was enough of a closed community that the buzz Doc would create by landing here would not extend much beyond Magdalena.ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGOAROUND THE TIME OF HIS HUNDREDTH birthdayDr.Hu Noah (like all Ivyns, he put his family name first, because it was somehow supposed to be more logical) had made a conscious decision to give up on trying to explain to younger people just how little he had actually changed with age.It didnt really matter that these people were making all sorts of wrong assumptions about how his mind and his body were changing.What mattered to them, he had finally come to realize, was that they believed such things to be true.It was more important to them to believe it than it was for him to explain the facts of the situation, and so he had decided to let them think what they thought and to try to find constructive ways to use it.Sometimes this meant sitting so quietly that they forgot he was there and began speaking of him in the third person, using Remembrance as a sort of interpreter.Sometimes he could astonish by speaking up, making it clear that he had been following the conversation all along.Or he would stand upan action that was always described later, by witnesses, as springing to his feet even though it was nothing of the sortand begin to move about under his own power, which many who didnt know him well seemed to consider miraculous.Because Remembrance was always by his side, and his grabb was always scuttling along beside him, giving him a sort of universal banister and grab rail, people assumed he was more unsteady than was really the case.In fact, this support system was nothing more than a simple way of playing the odds.A fall could cripple or kill him; why not have the grabb handy?And Remembrance, though she was assumed by most to be a health care worker, was really more of a general purpose aide de camp and, to put it crudely, a cowcatcher for turning human obstacles out of his path.He had had many conversations during his long life.Some were fascinating and stayed with him more than a century later.Others were less so.As a younger man he had tolerated those as part of the cost of doing businessa sort of tax that all people must pay in order to take part in civilized society.When he had turned one hundred, he had decided to stop paying that tax.Henceforth he would engage only in conversations that really interested himwhich, with a few exceptions for close friends and family members, meant conversations with a purpose.Remembrance carried in her head a list of all the people whom Doc might actually care to have a conversation with, and knew how to turn the others aside, typically by playing the age card.The list changed slowly over time, and certain people, some of whom were quite important, were occasionally discomfited to find that they were no longer on it.The list had been written down only once, twenty years ago, when Doc and Remembrance had established their relationship.She had committed it to memory and destroyed it.It now existed only in hernot Docshead.Perhaps 10 percent of the original names remained.Many of them had died.The others had been crossed off, almost always without any volition from Doc.Remembrance stayed off to one side during his conversations, on the pretext that she might be needed to intervene medically.But what she was really doing was following the dialogue and monitoring Doc for signs, not that his heart was failing or his medication wearing off, but that he was bored.Sometimes, during their first decade together, he had gone so far as to glance in her direction and catch her eye for a moment while his interlocutor wasnt looking, and this had been enough to eliminate that person from the list, but since then it had no longer been necessary.In many cases Remembrance had made what Doc had, at the time, considered to be mistakes in her performance of this duty, but on further consideration he had seen what she had seen quicker, and come to agree with her.Exceptions had to be made for cases like this one, where they had to work with the five other members of the Seven.Some, but not all, of these might have made their way onto Remembrances list.He had tried to select people such as Kath Two whom he enjoyed talking to, but the others were strangers to him.Ariane Casablancova showed amusing pretention in sitting next to him whenever she could, acting as a gatekeeper between Doc and the remaining four.She took at face value Remembrances cover story.Had Remembrance not been a Camite, she might have taken it wrong, seeing it as an usurpation of her prerogatives.But that plus the fact that she had lifetime tenurea sort of platonic marriage to Docmade Arianes behavior at most a source of dry amusement.The system worked beautifully at times such as this one, when a delegation of senior TerReFormers had gathered outside the door of Docs glider to belabor him with a welcome.It wasnt that they were insincere, just that their quite genuine desire to greet him was all mixed up with other hopes and needs.One might want to get a photograph with him, but be bashful and tediously indirect about making the request.Another might feel that her life work had been unfairly slighted by her peers and would desire some sign of affirmation from Doc.Yet another might be embroiled in some internal political drama of TerReForm and would hope to gain some currency by being seen on Docs arm.None of it was wrong or unreasonable, but all of it was a waste of time where he was concerned, just further examples of that tax he didnt want to pay anymore.Knowing this without being told, Remembrance exited the glider first.Doc watched out the window as the delegation huddled around her, leaning in close to hear her quiet voice, and furrowed their brows and made exaggerated nods as she explained to them just how exhausted Doc was.At some point she gestured back toward the glider and all of them looked up in unison and saw Docs face framed in the window.He made the faintest of waves and they all showed their teeth and saluted him in the various styles of their races: mostly Ivyn and Moiran.Once that was seen to, Doc sprang to his feet with a tug on the handle of his grabb, made his way to the door, stood framed there for a few moments so that they could take their pictures, and then made a great show of descending the stair that had folded down from the vehicles fuselage.The delegation tracked him across the apron of the airstrip, surrounding him in a great loose cloud but not subjecting him to the tiresome demands of polite social interaction.Ariane was right behind and the remaining four trailed at a distance, completely ignored.Ariane had gotten that right, at least: to the kinds of people who lived here, Docs arrival on Magdalena was such a sensation that even a Neoander went unnoticed.After Remembrance had turned aside all invitations and offers of hospitality, he dined in his room with Ariane, who reveled in the attention.Tomorrow things would be different and she would have to begin adjusting.In the darkest part of that adjustmentwhich for a Julian could get very dark indeedshe would look back on this meal and understand it for what it really was: a gesture of respect from Doc that could not be gainsaid by any of the voices muttering away between her ears.Doc asked her about her upbringing on Astrakhan, which was a smallish, almost pure Julian habitat at forty eight degrees six minutes east, near the center of the Dinan part of the ring.This anomaly had come about as the result of a visionin both the literal and figurative senses of that wordof a Julian man named Tomac, who had raised funds and established it as a quasi religious outpost very early in the history of the ring.In those days, being three degrees and six minutes away from a capital such as Baghdad made it seem like a remote frontier outpost.Since then, of course, the Dinan segment had filled in around it, crowding it between much larger and more modern habitats.But Astrakhan, with a few modern improvements, continued to support some tens of thousands of souls, and was often alluded to by Julians as evidence that their race, though lacking in numbers, was as well established in Blue as any of the Four.It was frequently visited by scholars in the field of Amistics: the study of the choices made by different cultures as to which technologies they would embrace or spurn.This was because Tomac, whod had peculiar ideas about everything, had made some unusual and instructive choices as far as that went.The isolation of Astrakhan made it a useful test case.For her part Ariane laughed off many of the quasi religious aspects of the culture in which she had been raised, but Doc sensed that she was doing so because it was expected of her.Later, as Remembrance was helping him into bed and getting him tuned up for the night, he told her that tomorrow he would begin getting to know the other four members of the Seven a little better, and that he would politely decline Arianes assistance in doing so.Ariane would have gloried in the opportunity to furnish Doc with dossiers full of statistics, and hours of personal gossip, about Beled, Kath Two, Tyuratam, and Langobard.But Hu Noah had always felt uncomfortable with such disclosures because they raised the obvious question of what was being disclosed, by the same person, to other curious minds, about Doc.At five oclock the next morning, Doc was in the recreation center, walking very slowly on a treadmill, when Beled Tomov came in for his daily workout.Beleds double take was so amusing that even Doc, who had made an art form of appearing not to know what was going on, was hard pressed not to laugh at the poor fellows expense.Even Remembrance, sitting nearby and reading, felt it best to interpose her book between her face and Beleds startled gaze for a few moments.Lieutenant Tomov, Doc said, I thought youd never drag yourself out of bed.Beled remembered his manners and saluted.I hope you wont think me rude if I dont reciprocate, Doc said, and nodded down at the treadmills handlebars.I have a death grip on these.Beled was looking around for Ariane.Doc decided not to make any comment.Is it your practice to warm up first?he asked.It is not considered necessary, Beled answered.Ah, too bad, I was thinking we might go for a stroll together, Doc said, nodding at the empty treadmill next to him.That can be done, Beled allowed, if I may stroll at a different pace.Suit yourself!Doc said.There is a reason I did not attempt this in the wild.Within a few minutes the Teklan, now stripped to nothing but a pair of briefs, was running flat out on the treadmill next to Docs, his hands blades, his arms scissoring, the soles of his bare feet skimming across the textured belt of the treadmill rather than pounding it.Engineered and bred to be a match for Neoanders, Teklans were at a genetic disadvantage because they were built like modern humans and did not partake of Neanderthal DNA.Bard could sleep in, eat and drink whatever he wanted, and still be as strong as the much larger Teklan.This was all perfectly academic, since no one seriously expected Beled and Bard to get into a fight, but it was a cultural habit of long standing that Teklans measured themselves against Neoanders, and used the comparison to spur themselves to even greater diligence than would have been their habit anyway.In a calm and level tone of voice, as though he were sitting on a couch sipping tea, Beled said, I never thanked you for sending me on the mission just completed.I assume it was your doing.But I had no way to reach you.I thank you now.Docs eyes strayed to a regularly spaced line of scars wrapping around the small of Beleds back, some forming deep craters in the twin pilasters of muscle bracketing his spine.Bisecting that formation was a long vertical scar running right over the lumbar vertebrae, where surgeons had gone in and done somethingDoc didnt know the detailsto repair damage to the spinal column and, he supposed, add some hardware or bone grafts.It was the least I could do, Doc said.And given what happened in Tibet, I thought you might be better qualified than most to address certain ...plausible complications that might arise.So we will be operating near the border, Beled replied.His tone said that he had long ago surmised this and only wanted final confirmation.We will go where the investigation takes us, Doc said.This surprised Beled slightly, producing a hiccup in his gait, which he spent a few moments resolving.These wanderers, Doc went on, do not seem to be great respecters of borders, or of anything to do with Treaty, and so I thought it best to construct the Seven of persons of like mind.Is it to be Beringia, then?Or Antimer?Probably both.Antimer, of course, is closera short hop from Hawaii, which is todays destination.But as the trail is warmer in Beringia, I think we shall go there first.HAWAII THEY REACHED BEFORE NIGHTFALL, TRAVELING AS PASSENGERS on a colossal TerReForm vehicle, not really an airplane and not really a boat, that skimmed over the surface at an altitude of no more than four meters.Ground effect vehicles of this class were called arks.They had been designed to deliver massive quantities of plant and animal biomass, nurtured at big offshore TerReForm bases such as Magdalena, to littoral destinations, where they could be slammed down into their new homes or else transferred to other vehicles for shipment inland.Only ten of them had ever been built and only six remained in service.This one was called Ark Madiba, after a Moiran biologist of the Fourth Millennium who had in turn been named in memory of a hero of Old Earth.If their theme was to travel unobtrusively, then Ark Madiba was certainly the vehicle for it, being a cavernous, reeking warren of animal pens, fish tanks, bug boxes, and racked peat pots in which exotic plants were growing in stews of manure.A ship making the same runfive thousand kilometers due westwould have taken several days.Provisions would have been needed to feed the beasts, clean the cages, and water the plants.This howling, hammering monstrosity did it in twelve hours, a span brief enough that just about any living thing could survive it without victuals beyond water and perhaps a bit of a snack.In it, the Seven basically disappeared.As the arks dozens of turbofans roared into life and it began to chunder across Magdalenas harbor, the noise level rose to the point where they could do nothing but insert the earplugs theyd been issued and distribute themselves around the cargo hold in places where the stink wasnt too bad.Doc and Memmie were given special dispensation to enjoy the journey in a tiny capsule near the cockpit, where members of the flight crew could sleep and recreate during multiday flights.The rest of them just tried to make themselves as comfortable as they could and waited for it to be over.TerReForm had come late to Hawaii.The place was small, idiosyncratic, far away, and complicatedbest left for last, after major continents had been booted up.The Hard Rain had loosened the lid on the geological hot spot that had built the islands, reawakening dormant volcanoes on existing islands while causing a seamount southeast of the Big Island to develop, ahead of schedule, into a Bigger Island.This had merged, a thousand years ago, with the former to make a Bigger Island Yet, most of which was still too hot and toxic for TerReForm to bother with.But there was a cove on its north coast, called Mokupuku after a tiny island that had once stood approximately in the same place, around which things were cool and quiet enough to be worth seeding.There, around sunset, Ark Madiba effected a sort of controlled crash landing, skidding to a halt offshore of a small TerReForm installation of the sort that were now scattered all over New Earth.Such as these were the epicenters of the ecological earthquakes that the human races had, for about three centuries, been unleashing on the surface.Sometimes they got their deliveries straight from the sky, other times, as in this case, from arks dispatched out of the larger surface installations.Older ones were clusters of hemispherical domes because they had been constructed before New Earth even had a breathable atmosphere.Newer ones, like this, had a somewhat more welcoming appearance.But their basic purpose was to work with beasts, bugs, and plants, and so their fragrance and the overall style of their operations lay somewhere on a continuum between farm and zoo, with the odd dash of science lab.None of it would have seemed remarkable, at least on an olfactory level, to the vast majority of human beings who had lived on Old Earth in the millennia leading up to the scientific revolution, but the people who endured that voyage in the cargo hold of the great plane/boat were fortunate that the fuselage wasnt pressurized and that ocean air could therefore filter through it.The staff were almost all Moirans, with a sprinkling of Camites and one visiting scientist who looked like a Dinan/Ivyn breed.Obvious to Kath Two, and probably to the others as well, was that her kin had slept long and hard after coming to this place, where they were cut off from the rest of their race while continually exposed to the pheromones, smells, calls, and behaviors of those animals and plants.Resulting epigenetic shifts had rendered them well qualified to do this kind of work, to do it all day long, and to live here indefinitely.This truly was the back of beyondeven more isolated than certain boneyard habitats that had become proverbial for remotenessand the Moirans here all shared a kind of thousand yard stare that was only intensified by the fact that they were predominantly green eyed.They moved slowly, they appeared to think slowly, and they were always reacting to stimuliauditory?olfactory?imaginary?that Kath Two could not even detect.The existence of seven distinct human races, as well as various Adan subraces, provided modern society with a rich fund of opportunities for socially awkward happenings.The few hours they spent on the beach at Mokupuku, watching the locals unload samples from the vehicle and hose the shit out of it with pressurized seawater, were long ones for Kath Two as she sensed other members of the Seven glancing back and forth between her and these, and wondering how long it would take Kath Two to go that way if she extended her stay.These people had created, and were self aware and self proud of having created, an original culture around the place where they lived.Which for all practical purposes was synonymous with the ecosystem that they were installing in it.Not for them scientific detachment.Was it really wise to station Moirans in a place where they could live as closely with epigenetic animal species as medieval Europeans had with their swine and their fowl?Were these animals scientific specimens, livestock, or pets to them?Kath Two watched their uncomfortably familiar interactions with those animals and they watched her watching them.They had woven into their dreadlocks the bright feathers of birds that on Old Earth would have been called exotic: a word that was useless here, since humans had made them, patterning them after the parrots, toucans, and cockatoos of long extinct jungles on the theory that if colorful plumage had been useful to birds there, it would be useful to them here.Inotic?Anthrotic?Anyway, they were weird people, and they were lifers in the sense that no conceivable home could be found for them on the ring.Not unless they went back to sleep for a while and tried to roll back the changes that their environment had bent on them.But that was no easy thing.As long as a Moiran kept changing, she could keep changing, but if she stayed one way for too long she would take a set, as the expression went, and find it hard to change back.These, Kath Two suspected, had definitely taken a set.They were obviously interbreeding with the Camite staff, who in racially characteristic fashion had adapted to the place where they had found themselves and were looking for ways to make it work for the people surrounding them.There was nothing wrong with that.So people on the ring kept saying, because it was the polite thing to say.Nothing wrong with breeds.But the truth of it was that breeds, like weeds, tended to be found in disturbed areas.A sprinkling was nice, especially in sophisticated places like Chainhattan, but seeing a lot of them in one community was a sign that everyone on the ring knew how to read, even if they knew it was impolite to say what they were thinking.The behaviors that these Moirans had invented around everyday things like the sunrise, mealtime, and the interpretation of dreams had a ritualistic quality that to Ariane was obviously fascinating and to Kath Two was a little mortifying.For the first time in her life she was feeling the stirrings of what was called Old Racism: the survival into modern times of racial attitudes, or reenactments thereof, that had existed on Old Earth, had been altogether snuffed out, and were known only because documentation thereof had survived.On a certain kind of diseased mind they exerted the same magnetic pull as they had pre Zero, and so among a population of millions on the ring you might find one person whod spent too much time delving into a five thousand year old web archive and become infected with ideas about pre Zero blacks that he fancied were applicable to Moirans, and so on.It was purely an intellectual curiosity and not at all a factor in real peoples lives: a thing Kath Two had heard of, like rabies or Watergate, and she was fascinated to find it stirring in her own mind here of all places.But that was only a passing notion.Presently her Survey mind kicked in and subsumed all under the scientific method.Here they were at a TerReForm outpost.Many thousands of these existed.Some were huddles of tents presaging more permanent works.Some, like this one, had been around for decades, others for centuries.Some were now abandoned, having served their purpose, and others had become nuclei of RIZes, campuses for gimmicky schools, prison camps, or scientific foundations.A weird culture, utterly nontransferable to the ring, had formed at this one.If it had happened here, something like it must have happened at others.How many?Was New Earth infested with bizarre cultural outliers centered on TerReForm installations?Could you go to what used to be Uzbekistan and find a miniature colony of Ivyn performance artists, developing their own idiosyncratic lichen based cuisine on the rim of an impact crater the size of Ireland?To what was left of the Iberian Peninsula and visit a colony of Teklan juggernauts making babies with Julian mystics?How far could this go?Kath Two felt some relief the next morning when, after a pleasant and uneventful campout on the beach, they got back into Ark Madiba, now 90 percent empty, and took off north.The distance to the south coast of Blue Antimer was half what they had covered the day before.Around midday, when the sun was beating down on the deep eaves and shuttered windows of the military complex above, the ark plowed up the harbor there and settled with a vast sigh into a fresh, sparkling azure chop.A smaller TerReForm post, annexed to the military base, sported a single pier long enough to accommodate an ark.The pilots employed a variety of muttering and whining thrusters to get into its general vicinity.The rest was handled by robot tugs pulling on ropes wrapped around massive bitts.The five humans whod been sharing the cargo hold moved forward to get out of the way of the local TerReForm staff, who boarded the ark, along with a couple of cargo loading grabbs, to take charge of what little cargo remained: racks of cages housing large carnivores.It was a mix of canids and felids, with a few big snakes.Theyd been stashed in different parts of the hold so that they wouldnt wear themselves out menacing one another.Anyone who was connected with Survey, or, for that matter, who knew anything about the TerReForm at all, would understand what this meant: the ecosystem of Antimer was far more developed than that of Hawaii, and was now producing small fauna and herbivores at a pace that required the introduction of bigger predators to keep them in check.The harbor was an almost perfectly circular impact crater with only a small outlet to the sea.Most of its circumference was claimed by the military base.From somewhere in that zone, a launch cut across the disk of blue water and came up alongside the arks cockpit door.The Seven descended to it by means of a folding stairway, and thus passed out of TerReForm jurisdiction without any formalities, or even contact with the local staff.Half an hour later they were eating lunch in a private officers dining room adjoined to a mess hall, and an hour after that they were aboard an airplanea conventional, powered military craftthat took off from a runway blasted into the stony shore of the island a few miles away and banked northward after it had gained enough altitude to clear the snowcapped peaks along Antimers central ridge.From that height the eye was no longer beguiled by the peaks and valleys that, at a smaller scale, made the place seem like an Old Earth mountain range.Here it was possible, for those looking out the windows on the left side of the airplane, to see a thousand kilometers westward.The curvature of the archipelagos spine made it obvious that this was the rim of a huge impact crater, created by a big chunk of moon that had come in on a somewhat northward trajectory and pushed a high arc of seafloor and ejecta up above sea level.To the south, a smaller archipelago, curved the opposite way, hinted at the craters lower rim.That, however, was not visible from the planes windows.Instead they all gazed west, tracing the arc of mountains as it grew higher and the land beneath it broadened.Somewhere along the way it was sliced by the invisible line of 166 Thirty.Bard pressed his heavy brow against the window and looked long and thoughtfully at his homeland, seeming to identify hills and bays that he remembered, thinking of vineyards.Then Antimer fell away behind and they flew for some hours over the featureless Pacific.The water was too deep in these parts for the Hard Rain to have visibly reshaped anything, barring another hyperimpact like the one that had created Antimer, and so the general shape of things was little changed until they verged on the continental shelf, just a hundred kilometers or so south of what had once been Alaskas coastline.In the shallows between that and the foothills of the coastal rangea strip of sea and land between one and two hundred kilometers widevisible changes had been wrought.But the coastline was basically where it had always been.More effective than direct bolide strikes in the reshaping of the land had been the disappearance of the glaciers and the endless series of tsunamis that had been funneled into this broad bight over the millennia.The one hurled up by the Antimer impact had overtopped the mountains themselves, cresting over what had formerly been glacier bound peaks and slamming down far inland to boil dry on the hot rocks.Since the beginning of the Cooling Off, about eleven hundred years ago, and particularly since humans had reconstituted the oceans by dropping comets on the surface, snow had begun falling on those peaks again.But it took a long time for glaciers to form, and it would be millennia more before cracked rivers of old blue ice oozed down the mountain valleys to touch the sea.When that day came, the settlement of Qayaq would have to move out of the way.It was built on a heap of rubble on the western bank of a cold river that hurtled down out of the mountains, just at the place where it emptied into the Pacific.There was not enough space between sea and snow for an airfield of the size Qayaq required, and so they had constructed one out of the mix of fiber and ice known as pykrete.This floated just offshore, a perfectly flat slab laced with tubes through which refrigerated coolant was circulated to keep it solidnot a difficult task in a place where the temperature of sea and air alike was only a few degrees above freezing.Other than that, nothing was really here.Even the TerReForm presence was minimal, it being easier for TerReForm staff to operate from boats.The Qayaq airfield had to exist because of the Ashwall.West of here, all the way to 166 Thirty and beyond, the chain of volcanoes formerly known as the Kenai and Alaska Peninsulas and the Aleutian chain were in a nearly continual state of eruption.Any pilot meaning to fly north or south across the sixtieth parallel, in the zone bracketed by 166 Thirty on the west and the Rockies on the east, had to make allowances in the flight plan for the likelihood that their path would abruptly be barred by a plume of volcanic ash hurled into the stratosphere by any of a hundred active volcanoes lying upwind.Airplanes were expensive, even more so than they had been on Old Earth.They were too large to manufacture in the ring and transport down to the surface and so they, and other large productions such as arks and ships, had to be built in factories on the surface.Typically these lay on the outskirts of Cradle sockets.In any case, planes had to be babied, given that high capacity turbofan engines were extraordinarily difficult to make.Every flight plan had to include a possible emergency landing on the artificial floe of Qayaq, which in turn had to be fully capable of hosting big airplanes.So what had been conceived as an emergency landing site had become something of a hub, where planes tended to land just because it was convenient and predictable.In any case it happened to be the final destination of the military flight on which the Seven had hitched a ride, so they had to get off here anyway.It was about as warm and welcoming as you would expect of a forward airbase constructed on a slab of ice.A low cloud layer kept it in eternal twilight and converted all colors to shades of gray.Across a strip of water, the town sprawled on its rubble pile like a dead starfish.Beyond that was a black wall that they understood to be the lower slopes of the coastal range, carpeted now with young trees but too obscured by mist and gloom to be identifiable as such.Higher up, just below the cloud ceiling, some of these were dusted with fresh snow, or perhaps just ice condensed directly from the fog.Had those clouds been absent, as they were for a few cumulative weeks out of each year, the Seven would have been able to look up above snowcapped peaks to a sky made black by the Ashwall.One of the big volcanoes on Kenai had been erupting copiously for two weeks.The temptation to cocoon in a microhotel pod on the slab, to eat hot noodles from a cup and watch videos, was strong.Anything to escape the sense of being trapped between ice and sea below, fog and ash above, the Pacific to the south, and the mountain wall to the north.Instead of which Tyuratam Lake announced that he was going into the city to sample its drinking establishments.He did so in a manner so bluff as to make everyone else feel faintly idiotic for even thinking of doing otherwise.Kath Two, Beled, and Langobard said they were in.Doc demurred on grounds of wanting a nap, and Memmie, as always, stayed with Doc.Ariane seemed peeved and conflicted.The politics of race had been gradually coming into play during the journey from Cradle, and now Ty was pushing harder.According to a five thousand year old understanding shared by most who were not Adans, and some who were, Ty was going to be the leader of the group.This was partly because he was a native Beringian who knew his way around the place, but it was mostly just because he was the Dinan, and being the leader was a thing that Dinans did.Ariane had been organizing thingsit was she who had somehow strung together the series of flights that had taken them from Cradle to Qayaqand in the early going shed had Docs ear.It had seemed impossible to talk to Doc without going through her.But since then Doc had made a point of spending time privately with the others, and Ariane, after a day or so of confusion and irritation, had accepted this.The natural constraints of group travel had kept them all together.Now Ty was mounting an unauthorized expedition to the mainland, and Ariane was perhaps torn between the desire for that private cup of noodles and the fear that she would miss something.She ended up coming with them.They broke open one of the chests of gear that had been with them since Cayambe and found warm clothes.Then they hiked across the ice to some steps that led down to a little port for water taxis, and made the tripjust a few hundred metersto the shore of Beringia.A rambling stair, carved into the rock by mining robots, took them from the waters edge up to the place where the slope became gentle enough to walk on, and then they found themselves looking down a main street that ran inland for all of about a hundred meters before dead ending against a vertical wall of rock: a boulder that had been forcibly embedded in the flank of a larger mountain.Even from here they could tell that the boulder was a piece of the moon.Efforts had been made to pep the place up by making use of various light emitting technologies, which now festooned the fronts of the establishments and bled lurid, saturated colors into the translucent air.It could be inferred from the nature of their advertising that the typical customer was military and lonely.I SOMETIMES WONDER, BARD SAID, GRIMACING AT THE TASTE OF the local cider, whether the Eves, being women, really got the connection between the male visual system and sex drive.He was looking sidelong at a naked lady at the opposite end of the room.Kath Two had little interest in the naked lady, but she had turned her back on the rest of the group, a minute earlier, to watch a disturbance.Now she turned to face Bard.Well, they were women.They had spent their whole lives under that gaze.Everything theyd ever been taught about how to dress, how to carry themselves Yes, Ariane said.On, if memory serves, Day 287 of the Epic, we have the reality television conversation in which Ivy talks specifically about the importance of Dinahs persona and its treatment in social media.How can you remember shit like that?Ty asked.Kath Two gave him a somewhat reproachful look.How can you not?That conversation took place only minutes before your Eve met the love of her life.Ty thought about it.First bolo?His eyes flicked away from the naked lady toward a screen above the bar, where a scene from the Epic had been playing with the sound off: Dinah in a space suit, going out on the exterior of Endurance to figure out what was wrong with a misbehaving robot.No one was watching it.Yes.First bolo, Kath Two said, slightly mollified.Bard, for his part, was focusing a little too hard on the tiny bubbles in his cider, the dents and scratches in the surface of the table, the electrical wiring bracketed to the ceiling.It was different for him.Ty and Beled could look all they wantthat was, after all, the whole point of the establishment.For a Neoander, however, to stare in that way at a womanshe looked like a Dinan or perhaps a Dinan/Teklan breedwas a different matter.Not as far as the proprietors were concerned.The place was actually run, and presumably owned, by women.But there were other customers who had marked Bard when he had come in and who were devoting almost as much attention to him as to the dancers.Had he not been in the company of a larger than normal Teklan and a middle aged Dinan man with a certain hard to pin down dont fuck with me vibe, there might have been trouble.A few of the other patrons might have joined forces to find out whether the stories about Neoanders were tall tales.As matters stood, the only thing Bard had to worry about was being glared at a lot, and possibly coming down with something because of whatever feral strain of yeast had infected the cider.The template, and the general set of expectations, for communities of this type had been set beginning around five hundred years after Zero, when Cradle had become sufficiently crowded that there had simply been no choice but to spread outward from it.The first outlying habitats had been only a few kilometers away on Cleft.In fact, nearly all settlement had been confined to Cleft until early in the Second Millennium, when the industrial base had developed to the point where other rocks could be colonized.Many more such communities had been depicted in fictional entertainments than had actually existed.This didnt matter, though.As the almost totally factitious and romanticized Old West had been to American culture of the twentieth century, so those yarns were to the people of the habitat ring.So in the rare cases when actual settlements of that type were constructed de novo, as here, they tended to be built so as to meet the expectations of people who their whole lives had been watching fiction serials about their Second Millennium precursors.Even so, there were some surprises.Not so much the fact that it was female owned.That wasnt uncommon in the adult entertainment industry, and anyway some selection bias was at workthey had chosen to sit down in this place because it didnt feel as creepy to Kath Two and Ariane as some of the others.More unexpected was the fact that as many as half of the people in there were Indigens.Those who werentones who had come across the water from the ice slab floating offshorewere identifiable by haircut, clothing, and bearing.But their numbers were matched by shaggier and more colorful characters whose professions and reasons for being in Qayaq could only be guessed at.It was safe to assume that many of these had come up the coast from a RIZ about twenty kilometers away to engage in trade or other forms of intercourse.But Qayaq itself was bigger and more crowded than they had expected, suggesting growth in population and commerce exceeding the limits set by Treaty.Sheltered by mountains and hidden most of the time under dense clouds, an illicit city was growing up here.If it was happening here, it was happening elsewhere in the Blue part of the world.Red had to know about it.Cloud cover alone couldnt keep such a place secret.Why did Red not file diplomatic protests, then?Because Red was probably doing the same thing, perhaps on an even larger scale, and Red and Blue had come to a tacit agreement not to make trouble.How many humans lived on the surface?The official numbers for the Blue part of it were about a million, mostly concentrated around Cradle sockets.Maybe the real numbers were much greater.When they were finally approached, it was by a young Ivyn man with long hair and a wispy beard.Had he been spotted in the same location five thousand or, for that matter, ten thousand years ago, he would have passed for one whose ancestors had crossed from Asia over the original Beringia and flooded into North and South America.He had the wit to understand that the visitors were looking at him warily but the grit to walk to them anyway.He kept his hands casually down to his sides, palms slightly out, as if he had caught himself in the instant before throwing them up and exclaiming What the fuck are you people doing here?He was alert and mildly amused.As he drew closer it became clear that he was taller than hed seemed at first; theyd been misled by his slight build and his stooped posture.They might have asked the same questionwhat the fuck are you doing here?of this young Ivyn.Judging from his clothesfive year old fashions from Chainhattan customized with bits of fur, bone, and animal skinhe was an Indigen with commercial links to Qayaq.Maybe the smartest kid in his RIZ, the child of eccentric Ivyn dreamers, looking for things to do with his brain.Hed been hanging out at the bar with some Dinan chums, but all of them had seemed more embarrassed than stimulated by the nude dancers.You guys headed over the mountains?he asked.He had noted their clothing: brand new, high quality, extremely warm.It seemed like a simple icebreaker to everyone except Ty, who said, We dont need a guide, before any of the others could answer.That set the kid back just a little.A guide, he repeated, as if Ty had just brought a peculiar but somewhat interesting idea into the conversation.No, I didnt really take you for people who would hire a guide.Meaning adventurousand, by Treaty, illegaltourists from the ring.This left open the question of what he did take them for, and so it was a little awkward until he went on: If youre going to the other side of the mountains, I could show you something.Something special?One of a kind?Something you show to people all the time?Ty asked.The kid looked shy.I have been there twice before.Its interesting.Been there with paying customers?Ty asked.Because but he was interrupted by a hand on his arm from Ariane.He called it interesting, she said.He is not motivated by money.Very well, Ty said.What is your name?Ariane asked him.The kid put up his deflector screens and said, Einstein.Silence then.When no one laughed, he stood straighter and drifted closer.What makes this thing so interesting?Its a fact, Einstein said.I dont understand, Kath Two said.Its a fact that its interesting or but then she stopped, because she had figured it out.An apostrophe belonged before that word.He meant that it was an artifact.A surviving object from the pre Zero world.I would go see that, Ty allowed.THEY UNDERSTOOD EINSTEIN A LITTLE BETTER THE NEXT DAY when Kath Two flew all of them over the mountains in a glider and they saw just how difficult it must have been for foot travelers like him to have reached the site of the artifact.It raised the question of how he had ever found it in the first place.Blind luck after getting hopelessly lost in a whiteout seemed the most likely answer, but perhaps his people had combed the inland slopes of these mountains in a systematic way.They were traveling in the same type of glider they had used on the leg from the Cayambe socket to Magdalena.Because it had no engines, it could fly through the Ashwall without mechanical damage, and because it traveled more slowly than a jet, they didnt have to worry quite so much about Kath Twos windshield getting fogged by abrasion from microscopic bits of rock.They did have to be somewhat concerned about the fact that she could not see where she was going as they flew through the densest part of the cloud.But she knew the altitudes of the nearby peaks and stayed well above them.Once the view had cleared a little bit, she was able to take advantage of the ash, which worked in the air somewhat like a drop of ink in swirling water, making currents and vortices obvious.Einstein seemed exotic to the Seven in that he had been born on the surface and had never left it.This was his first journey in an aircraft of any kind.Seeing the mountains from above demanded some mental adjustments, which he made quickly.And in any case he knew the latitude and longitude of the artifact.After they had passed over the crest of the mountains and gotten into clear air, he directed Kath Two toward a high valley slung between the coastal range and a subsidiary crest beyond.Its upper reaches were devoid of life, but farther down the slope, tundra and low scrub were beginning to take hold.That these had been seeded from space was obvious from their regular spacing.Robot pods had fallen out of the sky in precise geometric formations and slammed into the ground in a hexagonal array before breaking open to spill their seed on the ground.Some wag in the bureaucratic bowels of TerReForm had dubbed these things ONANs: Orbital Neo Agricultural Nacelles.As the years went by and the ecosystem spread out from the ONANs, the hexagonal pattern disappeared into the natural chaos of life.But in a place like this where plants grew slowly it would still be visible centuries from now.Kath Two made a few passes up and down the length of the valley and identified a stretch of smooth seasonal riverbed, paved with frozen ash paste, where she thought she could land and take off.The gliders energy storage devices had been charged up the night before and were still at 100 percent.So she made another long orbit to bleed off velocity and then landed while traveling in an uphill direction.She made a gentle touch first, just to verify that the riverbed was in fact frozen solid, then set the glider down decisively.The wingtips dragged at the very end and there was some concern that one of them might strike a protruding rock, but she was able to avoid this and bring the craft to a full stop without damage.Beled and Bard climbed out first, and jogged in opposite directions to the two wingtips.After picking these up off the ground they were able to rotate the glider by walking clockwise in a large circle.Kath Two told them when to stop.Ty got out and opened a cargo hatch on the side, releasing a couple of siwis that began moving across the ground in their distinctive elbowing style of locomotion, as well as a couple of buckies that began rolling about seeking high ground from which to establish observation posts and communications links.Their main objective now was to get the glider tied down so it wouldnt blow away in a stray gale.The siwis were essentially earth sciences robots, good at digging and tunneling.In a few minutes time, with a bit of guidance from Doc, they were able to plant anchors in some sturdy looking boulders flanking the riverbed.Ty and Bard ran ropes from those to the ends of the gliders wings and made it fast while Beled stalked restlessly around the perimeter.Kath Two and Ariane deployed the grabb that Doc used to get about in places like this.It served the same function as a wheelchair, only with legs, so that it could pick its way along terrain where even able bodied humans would have difficulty making headway.Meanwhile Memmie got him bundled up and ready.Einstein watched it all and asked only a few hundred questions, most of which were cheerfully answered by Doc himself.Einstein would have seen much of this sort of technology on videos in the RIZ, but this was his first direct experience of it.He knew better than to ask questions about the weapons.Kath Two, Ty, Beled, and Bard all had katapults of different descriptions.They did not arm themselves like soldiers going into war, but more in the precautionary style of Survey personnel venturing into places where large predators or even bad Indigens might be prowling around.Kath Two carried the same type of small katapult that shed been packing on her recently concluded Survey mission: a sidearm that would use electromagnetic propulsion to hurl one particular kind of ambot toward a large, warm target.Steering itself toward the big infrared blob, the ambot would land on it, like a space probe touching down on an asteroid, and crawl around looking for ways to make it miserable.Any large animal with more than two or three of these things on its body would have other things on its mind than eating Kath Two.Tyuratam Lake had a somewhat older, heavier, and more battered version of a similar weapon.It had two magazines, one of which was exactly the same as Kath Twos.The other presumably housed ambots of a different type, maybe for use against humans.Beled was slung with a considerably bigger two handed katapult, whose long flexible magazine was draped about him like a bandolier.It was overkill, but it was what he had, and the weight didnt bother him.Langobard, in a style traditional among Red Neoanders, simply had a menagerie of different ambotsperhaps a dozen all toldcrawling around on his body, and a katapult strapped to the underside of his forearm, like a splint.When he told it to begin firing, which he would do by means of a control in the palm of his hand, the ambots would get word of it over their network and begin trying to find their way to his elbow so that they could insinuate themselves into the katapults projection mechanism.It seemed a bit indirect, but it had the advantage that when the ambots had nothing else to do they could patrol Bards body looking for foreign ambots that had been projected at him by the enemy, and join battle with them.All of which, while fascinating to Einstein, and indeed to anyone who stopped to think about it, was so routine to the Seven that no one made any mention of it.The behavior of the ambots infesting Bard was somewhat novel and distracting at first to those whod had little exposure to Red ways, but as they began their trudge down the valley it became clear that the ambots were all executing a program that cashed out in a few repetitive, stereotypical behaviors such as perching on his shoulders or running rings around his midsection.Sometimes a few would make a bid to form a train, but there werent really enough of them.During spare moments in the trip from Cradle, Beled and Bard and Ty had sat down together in private rooms, opened up the equipment cases, and made efforts to get the different ambots accustomed to each other, so that the Blue programmed ones that most of them were using wouldnt identify Bards more Reddish ammunition as innately hostile, and vice versa.So far it seemed to be working.When the shape of the valley funneled them all together, as when squeezing through a passage between boulders, Bards ambots seemed to catch the scent of the ones reposing in Beleds snaky bandolier, and would crawl around to that side of Bards anatomy and aim their sensors in that direction, but it did not seem as though hostilities were about to break out.Since any one communications system was likely to be jammed or hacked by the opposition, your more highly developed ambots communicated with one another in a number of different ways, including sound.Ultrasound was preferred, but all frequencies were used, and so it was occasionally possible to hear Bards botmo spewing noise as it tried to evaluate, or possibly just to confuse, the Blue botmo all around it.Sometimes it was a hiss and sometimes it was a mathematical tune played too fast for the human ear to process it.In any case, nothingat least, nothing audible to humanscame back from Beleds, Tys, or Kath Twos arsenals.Broadly speaking, Blue armaments makers were biased toward the lots of dumb ambots philosophy while Red ones went the other way.On broken terrain, Doc on his grabb made better time than anyone, with the possible exception of Einstein, who was a gifted scrambler.The two of them would surge ahead and then Beled would put on a loping burst and catch up, obeying some kind of instinct to take point.Langobard seemed more inclined to hang back and act as a rear guard, which meant he spent more time in the company of the slower Ariane.Sometimes he simply picked her up and carried her over rough patches.The valley had been flat higher up, but they had to negotiate a steeper transition down to the altitude where vegetation had been seeded by the ONANs.It then became easier going, though they had to find open trails among the dense low shrubs that had taken root in the ashy soil.Their feet and their noses told them that the ground had been preseeded with some kind of microorganism that had presumably been designed to convert volcanic ashwhich tended to have toxic stuff like sulfur in itto a more wholesome kind of soil.Einstein had played his cards close to his chest until they had deplaned.Since then, he had been providing Doc, and anyone else close enough to eavesdrop, with his own kind of speculative backstory for the thing they were going to visit.Youll see when we get there, he said more than once, perhaps betraying some uncertainty as to the correctness of his theorya word he knew but pronounced to rhyme with story.The phrase I looked it up was in frequent use by Einstein.He had no idea who Doc was, and just saw him as a very old man who was willing to answer questions.To answer them, but also to ask them in a way that was challenging without being brusque.They had these wheeled vehicles Cars?No, the big box shaped ones.Trucks, or lorries, Doc said.My theory is that this fact used to be one of those.But a minute ago, Doc observed, in the mildest possible tone of complaint, you were saying it got hurled over the mountains by a tsunami.Yeah.That would imply that it had been bobbing around somewhere in the ocean.Thats my theory.Would it not have sunk to the bottom?The boxes were not airtight.Sooner or later it would have filled up with water.The inside of what used to be the box is all coated with black residue, Einstein offered, also pronouncing that word incorrectly.What conclusion do you draw from that?I looked it up, and these trucks were used to carry all kinds of goods.Not just heavy stuff but bags of potato chips, athletic shoes, toys.My theory is that this was one of those.It was near the waterfront when it got hit by one of the earliest tsunamis, a small one that dragged it out into the ocean.And it didnt sink, see, because Because it was full of bags of potato chips or something, Doc said.Right, and it didnt burn, at least not right away, because it was in the water.But then later it got caught up in a really big tsunami, like the one that created Antimer, which heaved it right up over the mountains and slammed it down ...right over there.We should almost be able to see it.Whereupon its contents burned, leaving the black residue, Doc said, gently emphasizing the pronunciation.Yeah, and the paint burned off and the tires and all of the other stuff that wasnt steel.Would it not then have rusted away, during five thousand years?I looked it up, Einstein said.The place was very dry.And this truck was probably buried.Yeah, it rusted some.But it was preserved until the Cloudy Century.Einstein must have looked that up too; the Cloudy Century was roughly 43004400, after the oceans had been reinstated but while everything was still quite hot.Then, after rivers began flowing again, erosion exposed it.And yeah, the exposed parts are rusted all right.Some parts are of a different metal though.Aluminum, Doc said.But Einsteins discourse was trailing off as he kept looking at the device that was supposed to tell them their latitude and longitude.He was giving every appearance of being lost.Finally he made a decisive move about fifty meters down valley, penetrating a bank of tall shrubs.The others followed him.Visibility was poor and so they heard his reaction before seeing the fact.What the?!What is it?Ty demanded.Someone dug it up!Einstein exclaimed.They found themselves standing around the rim of a pit perhaps half a dozen meters in diameter, and the same in depth.Marks in the soil made it obvious that this had been excavated with shovels, and vague footprints proved they had been wielded by humans and not robots.At the deepest part of the excavation, the gray soil had been stained red with rust.But the bottom of the pit was otherwise vacant; whatever had been rusting there was entirely gone.Only a few scraps of hard black plastic, and fragments of steel that had been altogether converted into rust, proved that Einstein hadnt been lying to them all along.Ty let himself down carefully into the hole, prodded in the wet, rusty mush with his toe, then reached into it and pulled something out.After shaking off lashings of mud, he underhanded it out of the pit to Beled, who picked it out of the air.It was a bent black cylinder.The day is not lost, Ty announced.All of us will get to handle an actual fact.That, my friends, is a five thousand year old radiator hose.A few emotions were competing for the mental energies of the Seven: utter confusion about who had dug this hole, and why.Empathy for the deeply embarrassed Einstein, who had promised them an entire truck.Disappointment that the only things left of it were a rust stain and a radiator hose.A mild sense of alarm at the idea that inexplicable persons with shovels were somewhere about.Swamping all of these, however, like a tsunami cresting over the mountains, was the awareness that they were in the presence of a real artifact from before Zero.As they had established on the flight up here, Doc had seen such things three times in his life, not counting museum exhibits.None of the others had ever seen one at all.And so they all stood there in silence for several minutes, passing it from hand to hand, thinking about it: the factory where it had been manufactured, the engineers who had designed it, the workers who had assembled the vehicle, the driver who had piloted it around, and the day that the Hard Rain had begun.As it turned out, imagining the fate of seven billion people was far less emotionally affecting than imagining the fate of one.Beled, after handling the fact for a minute and gazing at it inscrutably, handed it off to Kath Two.He withdrew from the edge of the pit and began circling it restlessly.After a minute he called out to the others, but not in a voice of alarm.About ten meters away, at a break in the slope that afforded a bit of a view down the valley, a sort of totem had been erected: a length of aluminum tubing, white with oxidation, projecting vertically out of the ground to a height about equal to that of a person.At its top, lashed on with a few scraps of copper wire, a circular object: a steel hoop mostly obscured by marred and pitted black stuff, a crossbar through its middle with loose wires dangling from orifices.Steering wheel, Ty said.The plastic coating burned but the steel rim held it together.Who put it here?Ariane asked.She was the last to arrive, and had to insinuate herself among taller members of the Seven in order to get a clear view.As a result she nearly tripped over a long, low mound of disturbed earth.The steering wheel totem had been erected at one end of it.Whoever buried the driver, Ty answered.Doc looked at Einstein.Were you aware of the existence of human remains?Einstein held his hands up.You have to understand, the truck came down like a dart.Nose first.Naturally, Doc said.All the weight was in the engine block.The box, as we have established, was filled with something light.The only part that was sticking out was maybe this much of the bumper, and some of the box.Einstein was holding his hands about a meter apart.The place where the human was The cab, Ty said.was deep underground.You have to understand, all this digging Came as a complete surprise to you.Yes, we understand that, Doc said.When were you last here?Langobard asked.Two years ago, Einstein said.But you have to understand: if someone from my RIZ had gone up here with shovels and dug up a whole truck, Id have heard about it.Wheres the incentive?Ariane asked.Everyone looked at her.As it wasin situthe truck was priceless.Legally or not, tourists would have paid any amount of money to come and view it.To dig it up makes senseso that tourists could get a full view of it.But But instead it has been completely dismantled, Doc said, and everything of value taken away.Of value?!I dont understand what you mean by that word, Ariane said.The Diggers were after the engine block, Doc said, as if this would answer her questionwhich it by no means did.But after a few moments she had a thought.Ah, Ariane said, you think it was looters.Bard was right with her.You think, he supposed, that the engine block is now sitting in a display case in the private gallery of some wealthy collector on Cradle.That is not an unreasonable supposition, Doc admitted, in a tone that, however, made it clear that no such idea had actually crossed his mind.But it strikes me as unusual for looters to go to so much trouble to give a ceremonial burial to the driver.If it was not valuable as lootas a collectors itemthen what possible value could the engine block have had?Kath Two asked.It was valuable, Doc said, as iron.As a several hundred kilogram sample of pure metal that could be melted down and cast into other shapes.Is there anything in the universe less valuable than iron?Bard scoffed.We have been living inside of giant chunks of it for five thousand years.We have, Doc agreed, and with a small movement of his hand caused his grabb chair to withdraw from the grave site and begin picking its way back toward the excavation.Remembrance threw an unreadable look over her shoulder and followed him.They reconvened and viewed the pit through fresh eyes.Ty pointed out a place where the gray ash was freckled with tiny red brown spots, and guessed that someone had worked there with a hacksaw, sprinkling iron sawdust on the ground, and that the tiny flakes had rusted.Slipping the ash between his fingers he produced a few bright sparks of clean metal.Bard found a scarred wedge of dense wood, battered on its fat end with many hammer blows, and guessed it had been used to part the engine block into pieces that could be more easily carried.Beled, continuing to circle the perimeter, came up with a pole of hard wood somewhat more than a meter long, neatly rounded at one end, snapped off sharp at the other.They broke one of their shovels, he said.Holding the pole before him, he rotated it until he was able to see an inscription that had been stamped into the wood.Srap Tasmaner, he announced.Let me see that, Doc said.Beled handed it to him.Doc gazed at it for a while without speaking.The longer he looked at this seemingly trivial piece of debris, the more he drew attention to himself, until the others were all standing there silently watching him.His deeply hooded eyes were downcast and it was difficult to tell whether he was focusing all of his mental powers on the thing, or fast asleep.Finally he rotated the pole until its sharp end was pointed downward, and used it to scratch a letter into the dirt.C You read this, Beled, as a letter S, but as you probably learned in school, it was once used to represent a number of sounds including the one we write as K.  He wrote a K beneath the C.  The next few letters are familiar and we write them the same way in Anglisky.CRA KRA You misread the fourth letter as a defective P.  A natural mistake since we no longer use the old glyph F, which it resembles.Instead we use the Cyrillic phi.CRAF KRA The next two letters are TS, for which we have a more wieldy one letter substitute in Anglisky.CRAFTS KRA The next three are the same in English and Anglisky.CRAFTSMAN KRAMAN Craftsman, Beled said, reading the bottom row.But what of the R at the end?CRAFTSMAN  When its enclosed in a little circle, its not a letter to be pronounced at all, but a sign that this is a sort of commercial trademark.Or I should say was.It was a trademark five thousand years ago, apparently.About halfway through this lecture on ancient and modern orthography, Ariane had become intensely focused, and for the last part of it had been holding one hand over her mouth.I have seen its like in the Epic!she exclaimed through her fingers.New Cairds landing on Ymir.Vyacheslav went out the airlock to clear ice from the docking port.He used a shovel just like this one.You are saying Kath Two prompted Doc.I am saying that this shovel handle is itself a five thousand year old fact that could fetch a high price on Cradle, Doc said, lifting it up and brushing the dirt from its broken end.Ariane snapped a picture of it and thumbed at her tablet.It was thrown away, Doc continued, because it was of no use to its owners, who knew that they could get wooden poles anywhere in Beringia just by cutting down a tree.What sort of people think that iron is valuable and five thousand year old artifacts are garbage?Kath Two asked.She was interrupted by a faint high pitched beeping sound that was emanating from all of them at once.They had all been issued earpieces so that they could communicate if they became separated.Most had removed these and pocketed them, or simply draped them around their necks, but Beled still had his in.He pressed one hand to his ear and held the other in front of him, as if checking a timepiece.But he was actually looking at a small flat screen that was strapped to his wrist.He then pivoted to gaze up the valley in the direction from which they had come, but the view was blocked by foliage and terrain.Large animals moving in their vicinity have been detected by the buckies, he said, and one of them has gone silent.Yesterday, Doc said, when young Einstein here proposed we make a junket into the mountains to have a look at an artifact, I was resistant to the idea at first.I saw it as a mere diversion, of a touristical nature.I gave my assent to the idea because I saw it as an opportunity to carry out a dry run for the procedures we would be using later, when we got started for real.I see now, however, that it is the main event.THE DIGGERS HAD ERECTED ANOTHER TOTEM NEXT TO THE GLIDERS side door: a circular hoop of bent branches, thrust into the air on a pole made from a debarked sapling about five meters tall.The Seven recognized it as a more naturalistic version of the steering wheel totem that had been placed at the drivers grave.Did it have some meaning to these people?It was difficult, now, not to read it as a glyph symbolizing the Agents penetration of the moon.But it also looked like the Greek letter phi, which had made its way into the Anglisky alphabet as a substitute for both F and PH.As such it could have been an initial for just about anythingFire?Fear?Philosophy?Before they had moved from the site of the dig, Bard, Beled, and Ty had scouted the vicinity, spiraling out from it in larger and larger circles until satisfied that no one was nearby.They had found footprints and other signs that someone had been through very recentlyperhaps watching them as they had tried to make sense of the disappearance of the truck.As they had retraced their steps up the valley, then, they had spied sentinels, perched in places that were meant to be conspicuous, atop boulders and rubble mounds flanking the streambed, leaning on lances whose steel heads gleamed softly in the blue gray light sifting down out of the overcast sky.Others carried strange looking contraptions of cables, pulleys, and bent steel, which Beled identified as powerful bows.From this distance it was difficult to say much about their appearance.More than a few were redheads; the men tended to be bearded; they wore clothing that in some cases was out and out camouflage, in others was just meant to blend in with natural backgrounds.When they had passed between the first pair of sentries, Beled, on point, had held up his hand, signaling that they should stop.The obvious concern had been that by going any farther they would begin placing these people to their rear, effectively allowing themselves to be surrounded.But the sentries, apparently understanding this, now began to move up the slope abreast of them, leaving them a clear exit.Or at least a clear pedestrian exit.By the time the Seven and their young guide came in view of the totem raised above the glider, it had been surrounded by perhaps two dozen Diggers.They had pulled all the equipment cases out of the cargo hatch, laid them out on the ground in neat rows, and begun going through their contents.Some of them were making lists of what they found, taking inventory of what they seemingly thought of as their new property.I take it you have never seen or heard of such people, Einstein, Doc said.Rumors.But not this many.We just thought they were strays from other RIZes.Well, as you can see, they are something else, Doc said.He raised his voice slightly, addressing the whole group.Now that weve had some time for the shock to wear off, I think you all understand what we are looking at.These people are not descendants of the Seven Eves.They are rootstock.Their ancestors survived the Hard Rain and somehow found a way to live belowground until quite recently.Most likely they are cousins of yours, Tyuratam Lake.It took Ty a few moments to understand that Doc was alluding to events five thousand years in the past.By way of Rufus MacQuarie?he said.Doc blinked in assent.Dinahs father, as is well documented in the Epic, went belowground with some like minded persons.Efforts have been made, during the last century, to find their underground home and learn what became of them.All unavailing.Perhaps they didnt wish to be found, Ty said.How long have you known of this?Ariane asked.How long have you known of it, Ariane?Doc returned.Did the unusual orders you were given not fill you with a certain amount of curiosity?Of course!But I never Many of us have wondered, have speculated.The first solid evidence that I know of emerged about a year ago.Prior to that there were rumors, as Einstein says, but they could be more easily explained by supposing that some renegade Sooners were running around in the boondocks, living as they pleased.Or that they were forward scouts sent by Red to probe Blue territory.Indeed, Survey found examples of both.Docs eyes strayed toward Beled, who met his gaze.Red has made surprisingly deep incursions into central Asia, for example.Lieutenant Tomov may bear witness to that, if you can draw him out on the subject.Like many who have fought, he finds it tiresome to converse with ones who havent.So you have been engaged in a systematic investigation for at least a year was the only thing about all of that that Ariane seemed to find interesting.As have you, Ariane.It is just that you didnt know it until now.I myself was not really sure until Doc looked over at Memmie, who had taken custody of the shovel handle and fallen into the habit of employing it as a walking staff.Doc got a faintly mischievous look on his face.Until I held in my hands the Stick of Srap Tasmaner.How much do we know about them?Langobard asked.As of this moment, Doc said, the eight of us know a hundred times as much about these people as all other Spacers put together.Spacers?Again the mischievous look.In our discussionsour entirely hypothetical discussionswe found ourselves needing some term that we could use to denote the descendants of the Seven Evesthe inhabitants of the ringas opposed to people like this.We settled on Spacers.That makes it sound even more like all of this was foreordained, Ariane said.Her reproachful tone was getting on all of their nerves.Nonetheless they were surprised when it was Remembrance who said something.Perhaps the Camite felt emboldened by possession of a stick large enough to give the Julian a sound whack or two.More likely she was offended by Arianes accusatory tone, which hinted that Doc had been less than honest.Planting the Srap Tasmaner for balance on the uneven ground and turning to face Ariane, she said: Of note here is that we are making first contact with a race of cousins hidden from us for five millennia.Some would find that remarkable.And I do, Memmie!Ariane said, after a few moments spent recovering from her shock at being spoken to this way by a Camite.But in order to handle the situation well I think we need to know the larger context.Any well informed Spacer knows the context, Memmie returned, sweeping her free hand up across the sky.It is only a certain type of mind that scorns what is known by all and treats secrets as jewels.After this Ariane seemed to feel that further conversation would not be to her advantage.It was only the ten millionth such conversation that had taken place during the long, fraught, weirdly personal relationship between Julians and Camites, so Ariane knew her cue to shut up and look aggrieved.There had been very little discussion, as yet, of the possibility of violence.Body language and shared glances among Ty, Bard, and Beled suggested that they had all been thinking about it.Einstein did them the favor of blurting it out: What do you guys think?Can we take em?Yes was the answer from all three.But archery is a concern, Ty added.A factor is how much they know about us and our armaments.Have they been scouting us for years?Beled aimed the question at Doc, as if he would somehow know.The look on Arianes face was something like See, I knew it!but Doc merely looked amused.If so, Doc said, they have rarely if ever seen us use our weapons, and so they are unlikely to know how those work.Well, they have taken all of our buckies offline, Beled remarked, with another glance at the screen on his wrist.They appear to have retained some knowledge of how technology works, Doc pointed out.Even if they dont have the ability to manufacture their own buckies, they can recognize them for what they are.So of course they would disable those.It is a hostile act, Beled muttered.If we let their archers come within range, Ty pointed out, then they will have us.We should consider that a hostile act.Then we should not go much farther, Bard said.Thats what Im saying, Ty replied.They had approached now to within about a hundred meters of the glider and had the full attention of the Diggers surrounding it.Four of them had claimed the high places around it, where buckies had been stationed earlier, and two more had clambered up onto the tops of the wings.The strangely orderly looters had ceased their activities and pressed forward to see what was going to happen.At least three of them were children, and there were as many women as men.Mixed messages, Bard said, and made a gesture that caused his fellow Spacers to stop where they were.Let me have a go at this, Ty said, if its true they are related to me.He strode forward several paces beyond Beled, stopped, and then pantomimed drawing back an arrow and shooting it in a high trajectory.He then pointed at the archers.Immediately one of the Digger men, near the center of the group, turned to face the others and backed several paces away from them, swiveling his head to get a picture of how the formation might look from the Spacers point of view.He shouted something that, from this distance, could not really be heard above the sound of the wind on the rocks.The archers and the sentinels eventually responded, though not crisply.They clambered down from the high places and, on further exhortation from the leader, set their bows down and backed away from them.The leader turned to face Ty and held out his hands, palms up.Ty set his katapult on a nearby rock.A second man now separated himself from the Digger group and began making his way forward, making reasonable headway but steadying himself on a pair of walking sticks.His head was bald and his beard was gray.When he drew abreast, the leader, who was somewhat younger, began ambling forward, matching the older mans pace.Doc set his grabb chair into motion.Memmie, out of habit, paced him, but after she had taken several steps forward, he stayed her with a hand gesture.I will take that, however, he said, and extended his hand toward the stick.She gave it to him and he tucked it under one arm.Ty waited for Doc to catch up, and then began to advance by his side.Some of the Diggers seemed keen to follow the action and began to creep forward, touching off internal controversies, and prompting Beled and Bard to move ahead as well.Through a sort of nonverbal negotiation, the two sides arrived at a deal where a total of eight Diggersthe two out in front, plus six more trailing in an echelon behindventured out into the open space to match the eight Spacers.Among the Diggers were some warrior types, keeping a close eye on Bard and Beled, but women and a child too.On the Spacer side, Ty and Doc were out front, with Memmie a few paces behind.Einstein, Ariane, and Kath Two maintained some distance while Bard and Beled, who were conspicuously armed, remained in the deeper background, split out to either side, respecting an unspoken agreement that they would stay out of weapon range as the Diggers archers were doing.The two formations drew up within speaking distance, and looked at each other for a spell.To the Spacers, the Diggers were familiar looking from old videos: they were rootstock humans such as populated the Epic.Genetically they were homogeneous.They were white people with blond or red hair, and eyes that seemed to have gone pale in the darkness of their caves.Their skin was fair by nature, but freckled by exposure to the aboveground sun.They were smaller than rootstock humans, but not so much so that any one of them would have seemed dwarfish on a busy street in the Chain.Except for Teklans and Neoanders, who had occupational reasons for needing to be large, the descendants of the Eves had also lost stature, particularly during the First Millennium.They had been slow to gain it back, even during the Fifth, when by and large theyd had plenty of room to stand up straight.These Diggersat least the limited sample standing close enough for Ty to evaluate themdid seem uncommonly stocky, however.For their part, the Diggers had more to gawk at, since it could be guessed from their reactions that they had seen little or nothing of Spacers.Ty looked unremarkable to them.Doc was interesting largely because of his age and his means of getting around.Kath Two, Memmie, and Einstein might have looked strange more because of their coloration than any genetic alterations.Something was definitely odd about Arianes facial structure.Beled, and particularly Bard, were to them monsters.After a minute of sizing them up, the older Digger stomped forward a couple of paces and spoke in the pre Zero English that all Spacers knew from the Epic: Cowards who ran away, you are trespassing on a world that is no longer yours to call home.Begone.This is going well, Ty remarked to Doc.He is putting on a show of strength for the others, Doc said.Best let him.If you would, please?He issued a command that caused his grabbs legs to fold, bringing it as low to the ground as it could go, and extended a hand.Ty took his arm and steadied him as he stepped off the robot and found footing on the ground.He planted the stick with his other hand, then cautiously let go of Ty.Then he advanced a step.All of these actions produced murmurs among the Diggers.Perhaps they had seen Doc initially as some kind of cyborg, but now understood that he was just a very old man.He walked several paces until he found a flat spot that suited him, then planted the stick.I may look five thousand years old, he began, but I am in truth a mere descendant of those you style cowards.Though I daresay you would take a more charitable view if you knew of the deeds that they performed during their long exodus.Do I have the honor of addressing one whose ancestor was Rufus MacQuarie?We are all of that lineage, the old man boomed.Then I think I have something that belongs to you, Doc said.Moving deliberately, he pulled the stick out of its purchase on the ground and hefted it up until it lay horizontally across both of his outstretched palms.Please accept my apologies for having borrowed it without your remit.Had the Spacers been able to watch all of the Diggers reactions at once, it would have yielded a bonanza of intelligence about the workings of their minds and of their society.That degree of mind reading was, in general, the sort of task assigned to Julians, so it could be assumed that Arianes moiling brain and avid senses were running full blast.The young males seemed divided between a more vindictive group who wanted the stick of Srap Tasmaner confiscated immediately, and others of a more chivalrous turn of mind.The group at large comprised a minority who were indignant about Docs expropriation of their shovel handle, butmore significantlya majority who felt ashamed at the idea that they would take away an old mans walking stick.What those two groups had in common was that they took what Doc had said at face value.A smaller inner circlethe old man, the younger leader, and a woman of intermediate age who had stepped forward to confer with themhad the wit to understand that Doc was playing to the crowd, and not actually trying to initiate a conversation about the ownership of a piece of wood.In other words, the Diggers were, as a whole, reacting much as any other group of humans might have done.Which was interesting and important data in and of itself, since much might have changed during five thousand years in the mines.The discussion among the three leaders went on at some length and led eventually to an epidemic of head nodding.The old man squared off, sticks planted, his face set in judgment.The younger man and the middle aged woman advanced toward Ty and Doc respectively.The man came to a halt two paces away from Ty, just out of the range where shaking hands or fisticuffs might become plausible.The woman kept on coming and took the stick out of Docs outstretched hands.This touched off a wave of fascinated reactions among the Diggers watching at a distance.In a quiet but clear voice, the woman said, Old man, you have shamed us with your words and obliged us to answer in kind.No hand shall be laid on you by virtue of your age.She stepped forward past Doc, sliding her hands together at the blunt end of the shovel handle, and began to whirl it around.Then with a decisive lunge forward she brought it down on the side of Memmies head.Memmie collapsed to her knees and then to all fours, her headalready dribbling bloodsagging almost to the ground, exposing the back of the neck.And that was where the woman drove the sharp end of the stick, ramming it in several inches deep, well into the center of the thorax where it would strike lung or heart or both.Remembrance did not topple but rather deflated, settling gradually to a fetal position on the ground.The younger man meanwhile launched himself at Ty.It was not clear whether his intention was to inflict damage or merely to restrain him while Remembrance was sacrificed.In any case his foot dislodged a stone as he made his move, creating a sound that gave Ty a bit of warning.He was able to turn so that the attacker rolled around him rather than striking him dead on.The Diggers downhill movement became a disadvantage, overbalancing him.Hooking the mans ankle and kicking upward, Ty made him fall hard on his face.Both of his feet were projecting up in the air, soles of his moccasins exposed to the sky.Ty hooked a leg through the crook of a knee and then dropped his weight, bending the foot forward; the mans heel would have gone all the way to his buttock had Tys lower leg not been interposed behind the back of his thigh and his upper calf muscle, where it threatened to rip the mans knee apart.The man scrabbled at the ground and so Ty put more weight on it, the stink of the old moccasin in his nostrils, and felt a preliminary pop inside of the joint.The man screamed and stopped struggling.All of this happened in the same moments as the woman was killing Remembrance, and so Ty did not really take that in until he had placed the man fully under his control.He was just drawing focus on Memmie and understanding how bad it was when he saw a movement in his peripheral vision and looked over to see Doc telescoping to a seated position on the ground.He had turned around and witnessed the attack on Memmie.I want evac.I want evac, Ariane was saying.Ty had no idea to whom she was talking.Strange high whistling noises came from the sky.Ty looked up and saw a flight of arrows arcing over his head.They passed as well over the heads of Ariane, Kath Two, and Einstein and thunked into the ground or skittered on the rocks at the feet of Beled and Bard, who had been advancing until then.The woman with the stick had been in a sort of trance, but now drew focus on Ty and saw how it had gone with him and the younger man.Rage flashed over her face.She aimed the sharp bloody end of the stick at Ty and began to run at him.Ty heaved his full weight onto the younger mans foot and snapped his leg.Then he stood up, getting clear of the screaming and flailing Digger.He had come up with a rock in his hand, which he flung at the womans face.His aim was off, but still it forced her to falter and dodge, and gave him time to snatch up two more and advance one pace.Two more rocks, one of which struck home on her collarbone, and two more paces.On her back heel she aimed a thrust at him, but she telegraphed it and he parried it easily with his left forearm, snaking the full length of his arm around the shaft so that its bloody tip was trapped against his body.He reached out with his free hand, poked her in the eye with his thumb, grabbed her ear, and wrenched her away from the stick like a discarded wrapper.The older man was coming at him with his sticks a flailing in both hands, and more formidably, several of the young warrior types were running with lances leveled.Ty walked straight at the old man, knocking his sticks away with controlled strokes of the shovel handle, spun him around so that the mans back was against his chest, brought the handle up across the mans throat, and locked it in place, crooked in his elbow, his hand pressing against the back of the mans bald head.He then began dragging the man backward and downhill toward the remainder of the Seven.For this human shield might work to protect Tys front, but the boys with the lances were already moving to circle around behind him, and he had to hope that the others would protect his rear.One of the equipment boxes up by the glider now seemed to explode.But it was a strange sort of explosion with no flame, and little sound.Rather, the crate seemed to dissociate into a dense, gritty cloud, which became translucent as it spread.A moment later the same thing occurred with a second crate nearby.Both crates ended up lying on their sides, empty.The Diggers in the vicinity of the glider were all exclaiming in surprise, or just plain screaming.The nature of what was happening was not clear, even to Ty.It was enough to put the lancers into a more cautious frame of mind, as it gave rise to fears that they were being attacked from behind.Their advance faltered and they looked to see what was the matter.A thin gray layer was skimming over the ground, headed downhill toward them.It looked a little like a spent wave as it washes and foams over a flat beach just before settling into the sand, parting around rocks and recombining in their lee.More like an avalanche, though, in that it gathered speed as it came on.As it rushed past Ty and the old man, parting around their feet, he was able to focus and resolve it as a swarm of ambots of two different typesone type from each of the crates that had emptied themselves.They were all mixed together.Once they chittered past Einstein, Ariane, and Kath Two, they spread out across the flat open slope separating them from Beled and Bard.Those two were split out to the sides, just beyond arrow range.The swarm then forked as all the ambots of one type converged on Beled and all those of the other type made for Bard.The former groupthe Blue pattern ambotswere smaller, leggier, and quicker on broken ground.That swarm gathered itself together into a clicking, glittering, hissing firehose stream and leaped from the ground at Beled.Rather than striking him, though, it washed around him.In the interval of a few moments he was clothed from head to toe in an armor made of overlapping scales, each scale being the beetle like back of an ambot.They had swarmed over him and locked themselves together.A few strays clambered over the others backs seeking, and plugging, holes.Langobards swarm was a little longer in reaching him.During the final fifty meters or so it became ropy as it passed through a kind of phase transition.Where possible, ambots were copulating, jacking the couplers on their snouts into matching ones in the tails of those ahead of them, forming pairs, then strings of three and four that combined with others, so that by the time the swarm came close to its master it had converged into half a dozen long, whippy ropes, and as many shorter segments.These ambots were basically flynks, more at home flying than crawling.They had some limited ability to fly solo, but were much happier when combined into aerial trains.During their career down the slope theyd picked up a decent amount of energy just by losing altitude, and so in the last few meters they were able to rear up off the ground like cobras and leap into the air, shooting past Langobard but banking into tight turns behind him, curving round, nose seeking tail, until they had formed aitrains: closed loops, fully airborne, flying endless circles around his body, defeating gravity with the modest amount of lift provided by their stubby winglets.He gave them greater speed by the simple expedient of pawing at them from time to time, but they also drew energy from a field being generated by a power plant on his back.Perhaps a third of the flynks had failed to find their way into chains sufficiently long to form aitrains, and so a few shorter segments found his ankles and spiraled up his legs, like snakes climbing trees.There were also some singletons who had not been able to join even a short chain; these found their way to him and climbed as high as they could, competing noisily for perching space on his shoulders.As Bard now moved across space he looked like a combination of Da Vincis Vitruvian Man, inscribed within a system of circles, and early depictions of the atom, surrounded by an array of circular orbitals.Each aitrain sang a different note as its flynks sawed through the air, the pitch rising as it absorbed energy and built velocity.He and Beled were moving to join forces, both edging closer to the Diggers as their defenses came online.A single exploratory shaft, fired at a high arc by the foremost of the archers, plunged toward Langobard, but was casually flicked out of the way by a momentary deflection of an aitrain.It was nothing Ty hadnt seen before, but it was nonetheless distracting.Forcing himself to attend to things nearer and more pressing, he saw that a warrior had advanced to Doc, who was lying on his side struggling feebly, and raised his lance as if to strike him dead with a single downward thrust.But he had paused.Perhaps he only intended to create a threat.Perhaps he was gobsmacked by what had just happened with the ambot swarms.Ty was dragging the old Digger back toward Ariane and Kath Two and Einstein, who had prudently flattened themselves behind a brow in the slope that afforded some minimal protection against direct arrow shotsthough none against plunging shafts.The next time he turned around to look downhill, Bard and Beled had vanished, and the only clue as to where they had concealed themselves came from the movements of a few straggler ambots striving to catch up with them.Part of him felt let down that they had not advanced in force and simply destroyed the Diggers.A better part of him understood that they were too smart and too professional for that; they would find cover, hang back, observe, and wait for cooler heads to prevail.Ariane was darting back down the hill.She picked up Tys katapult from the rock where he had set it down.Good.Excited sentries, posted up in the rocks that flanked the valley, were hollering news of Bards and Beleds movements in the Diggers oddly biblical phrasings.It sounded as though the Teklan and the Neoander were moving rapidly to high ground.One of the sentries blurted out a sharp cry and went silent.This distracted all the other Diggers for a few moments.Ariane ran uphill a little past Ty, dropped to a knee, and pressed the muzzle of Tys katapult against the back of the neck of the woman who had killed Memmie.This woman had collected herself to a seated position on the ground and had been holding one hand over the eye that Ty had earlier poked.Arianes gesture was a curious one, recognizable from pre Zero filmed entertainment as the sort of thing you would do with the sort of firearm that projected dumb lead bullets at high speed.It made less sense with a katapult.But as nonverbal communication with the Diggers, it worked.Three hundred meters downhill of the glider, Ariane was saying, presumably to the same imaginary friend she had addressed a little earlier.Then, to the woman, Get up.One way or another, your mind is about to get blown.Ty heard himself let out a little snort of suppressed laughter.Apparently the part of the brain that identified things as funny kept running as a background process even when its contributions were useless.The way Ariane was moving, the things she was saying, were so out of character for her that Tys higher brain didnt know what to make of it; in the meantime he was chuckling as if watching some sort of comedy sketch.The woman got her feet under her.Ariane grabbed her by the hood of her parka and pulled her fully upright, then began marching her down the hill with the kats muzzle pressed against the side of her head.Ty stood there and watched her go by.Ariane, he said, what are you doing?You dont seem to realize, she said, that this changes everything.She let the katapult drop away from the womans head for a moment, then swung it up and aimed it at Ty.It gave off the characteristic whang of an ambot being shot out of its muzzle and then she put it back against the womans head.Ty felt the impact like a punch in the rib cage and recoiled from it instinctively.But even before he could recover from that, the ambot had entrenched itself in his clothes, extruded a couple of needle sharp probes into his side, and begun jamming his nervous system.Having been hit by these before, he knew that the best he could hope for was to strike the ground with something other than his face, so he released his grip on the shovel handle, and on the old Digger, and went down.Had he been able to speak, hed have told Kath Two not to worry about himto do something about Ariane.But his teeth were banging together too hard to form words, and it was all he could do to keep his breathing muscles working.The old man staggered away, fell to his knees, and found the shovel handle on the ground right in front of him.He grabbed it with one hand, planted it, grabbed it with the other, and used it to lever himself back up.He advanced on Ty, who was just lying on the ground in spasms.Ty was then aware of a dark shape above him, and looked up to see Kath Two standing over him, facing the old man, raising an arm instinctively to defend herself.The shovel handle struck that arm with a thud and sent Kath Two stumbling away, crying out in pain.The man then raised the pointed end of the stick above Ty.Iniquitous mutant!he cried.Then he added something that was drowned out by the whang of a katapult.Kath Two, using her own sidearm, had shot him in the belly from point blank range.The stick dropped from the mans hands and added to Tys inventory of minor aches and pains as it came down point first on his chest.The man toppled next to Ty, going down hard and banging his head on a rock.Suddenly Ty was in the clear, at least neurologically.Einstein, kneeling above him with a bone handled knife, had pried the ambot off him, and now used the knifes steel pommel to smash it to bits against a rock.Kath Two was down on one knee moving her damaged arm about in slow motion, her mouth frozen in the O of a suppressed scream.Tys gaze was drawn to movement in the clouds above Kath Twos head: a glowing rod levering down out of the sky.Visually it was a near match for what had just happened with the shovel handle, except that in this case the object was kilometers in length and incandescing as if it had just been pulled from the bed of coals at the foundation of a bonfire.He understood now.He swiveled his head sideways so that he could look down the slope.In a clear patch a stones throw awayabout three hundred meters downhill of the gliderthe ground was glowing ruby red where it was being painted from above by lasers: three bright spots forming an equilateral triangle, and a grainy circle centered in that.The light washed briefly over Arianes head and shoulders as she shoved her hostage into the middle of the circle.The glowing stick came straight down on top of them, enveloping them in its hollow end, and then sprang back up into the sky, leaving nothing save a trail of footprints that terminated in the center of a perfectly circular depression in the ground.Around that was a penumbra of vegetation that had been toasted by radiant heat.In the moments before the device was drawn back up through the cloud cover they were able to see the booth that had scooped up Ariane and her hostage, telescoping back up inside the red hot tube in preparation for its departure from the atmosphere.THE MECHANISM THAT ARIANE HAD SUMMONED WAS CALLED A Thor.It consisted of a big rockthe head of a god sized maulwith a very long and lightweight handle capable of reaching all the way to the surface even while the head was just grazing the upper reaches of the atmosphere.The whole thing spun like a thrown hammer, which was to say that the long handle flailed in a large circle around the head.At the end of the handle was the capture booth, large enough to accommodate three people if they stood close together.During descent and ascent it was enclosed within an outer shell designed to survive the rigors of passage through the atmosphere.The handle would stride down out of space in the same general style as the hanger bolo that Kath Two and Beled had recently used, except that instead of pausing in the upper atmosphere to collect aircraft, this one would spear all the way down to the surface and grab whatever happened to be standing in the target zonewhich it would paint beforehand with lasers so that the passengers would know where to stand.The head of the hammer would subsequently pivot forward into the atmosphere, catch air, and slow down, levering the handle sharply upward and catapulting the payload into a much higher orbit.The head would detach itself and fall downrange as a meteorite.This, of course, made it a single use device, used only in emergencies, and even then when the need was so extreme that it was considered worth the risk of dropping a bolide on some basically random spot downrange.So it could be assumed that a fresh crater now decorated the interior of North America somewhere to the east of here, and that Ariane and her captive were en route to a safe haven in the Red segment of the ring.What awaited them there could only be guessed at, but for Ariane it was probably going to be a substantial reward, a medal, and a promotion to some high rank in Reds military intelligence branch.Doc never spoke another coherent word.Seeing what had happened to Memmie, he had suffered a stroke that had immediately rendered him aphasic.Swelling of the brain killed him an hour later.The Diggers buried him and Memmie together in the place where they had fallen.The old Digger looked better after a few hours, aside from some symptoms indicative of a concussion.The younger one got his leg splinted.Both were in a murderous frame of mind toward the three remaining captives.But it seemed that the majority of the Diggers were taken aback by what had happened, and were advocating a more level headed approach to future relations between their tribe and the sort of civilization that could produce things like Arianes Thor and Beleds and Langobards weaponized ambot swarms.As a way of demonstrating their own technological prowess, or perhaps simply to blow off steam, the Diggers detonated a lump of some kind of home brewed explosive in the open space between the glider and the fresh graves.Evidently this was meant as a warning for Bard and Beled, who were presumed to be watching from nearby cover.Ty, Einstein, and Kath Two were fitted with hinged collars of bent steel.When these were closed around the neck, loops in the free ends came into alignment so that a chain could be run through them, locking them shut while stringing all the captives together.At one end, the chain was terminated by an ancient padlock that was too large to pass through the loops on Kath Twos collar.The other end was then affixed, by means of a bolt, to a large wooden stake that an especially burly Digger had pounded into the ground with a stone headed maul that looked like a miniature Thor.Just uphill of this, and out of the prisoners reach, other Diggers constructed a little cairn.They topped it with another lump of explosive.They attached wires to the lump for detonation and ran them down to the main Digger camp, which was under the wings of the glider some fifty meters away.What just happened?!Einstein wanted to know, as soon as the Diggers had left them alone.I mean, that was obviously a Thor.Ive heard of them.But ...and he threw his hands up in the air.Ariane is a mole, Ty said.Then he corrected himself: Was a mole.Now shes probably a hero.A Red hero.Red sent the Thor down to, what do you call it, extract her.Yeah.Her and, more to the point, a living, breathing biological sample.Kath Two, at one end of the string, climbed into a sleeping bag and fell asleep.Ty did not expect her to wake up for a long time.He and Einstein moved down chain as far as they could, to leave her in peace, and squatted on their haunches.The Diggers had left them firewood and kindling.Without discussion, they began laying a fire.It became clear that Einstein had done it before, and so Ty just let him do it.The young Ivyn had very particular ideas about fires.Where did you learn how to fight like that?Einstein asked him.Are you part Teklan or something?Fighting isnt about knowing how, Ty said.Its about deciding to.Well, I was frozen, man.Look, these are times when the decisions that our Eves made five thousand years ago control our actions to a degree that renders us basically helpless.You were meant to stand back and observe and analyze.And you were made to be a hero, Einstein said.A hero would have saved Memmie.But no one could have seen that coming!The way that woman just went crazy on her ...Well be asking ourselves that for a long time.Ty sighed and looked over to the encampment where the Diggers were going about life as if nothing had happened.Some of them were roasting kebabs that they had cut from the carcass of a big herbivore killed down in the woods.There were a lot of kids under ten years old, but few teenagers.Half of the women looked pregnant.Play your role, Einstein.Youre the Ivyn in our group now that Docs gone.What do you see?Einstein seemed reluctant to speak, so Ty prompted him: I see a population explosion.Einstein snapped into focus and nodded his head.Youve never heard of these people, Ty went on, even though your RIZ is just on the other side of these mountains and your people patrol up here all the time.Rufus MacQuaries mine was far to the north, Einstein offered.These people must have just come out into the open recently.Look for the oldest child down there and that probably tells you the date.But the atmospheres been breathable for three hundred years!Why would they wait until now?Ty nodded toward the center of the Digger camp: the big bed of coals, the meat roasting over it.Food?Einstein said.Food and fuel, Ty confirmed.Theyve been down in their hole living on God only knows whatcave tofu or somethingsince the beginning of the Hard Rain.Every so often maybe they would sample the air outside.When it became breathable they probably went out and had a look around.But it was still a wasteland, not capable of supporting life.Its only in the last few years that TerReForm has seeded that part of Beringia with animals big enough to be worth the effort expended in hunting them.That was the starting gunthe signal for them to come out.And to begin having kids as fast as they could, apparently.Apparently.Now, Einstein, what does that tell you about gender roles?Well, to begin with, they dont have an Eve, they have an AdamRufusso it could easily be more patpatree Patriarchal.Thanks.And then if all the women are expected to make lots of babies That tells you something, Ty said.Now, heres the big question that is kind of staring us in the face.Youre a Digger, okay?Youre not stupid.All you have to do is pop your head out of your cave on a clear night and look into the southern sky and you can see the habitat ring.And over time you can see the Eye moving back and forth across it and you can see new habitats lighting up as they are built.You can see bolos coming in low across the sky and TerReForm aircraft flying right overhead and showers of ONANs coming down straight from the ring.And youre no ignorant savage.Your folk have maintained a reasonably advanced engineering culture.Those compound bows.That lump of explosive.So you wouldnt have interpreted all of that as gods or angels or any of that.Theyve known, Einstein said.From the first For centuries, Ty said, nodding.As long as they could breathe outside.For that long, they have known that billions of humans were living in the sky, Einstein said.But they didnt make any attempt to signal.More than that.They hid from us!Ty said.Efforts were made, you know, to find the MacQuarie mine several decades ago.These people must have made some kind of decision that they didnt want to be found.Why would they do that?Thats what I am asking.Fear?Anger?The old guy really hates us.Cowards who ran away is what he considers us.Its what he called us, Ty allowed.And he called us that really loudly.He wasnt really talking to us, I think.Einstein nodded.I see what you mean.He was talking to the people behind him.If Im squatting in my mine shaft eating cave tofu when I know perfectly well that there are lots of humans up in geosync living in better conditions, then I need some kind of powerful incentive to stay in my cave.To conceal my presence.Some kind of dukh or I dee Ideology, Ty said with a nod.I should have seen all this.God damn me for not seeing it a few minutes quicker.Seeing what?That only a mind virus, a shared hallucination, could explain the suddenness of their appearance aboveground.Doc didnt see it either, Einstein said.He was only trying to make Ty feel better, but then he looked slightly appalled at himself for having spoken ill of his dead kinsman.No, Ty said, he sure didnt.Now, what have we learned about how these people think?They have, what do you call it, a chip on the shoulder.Ty nodded.It was supremely important to the leaders that they put on a show of dominance under the gaze of their flock.Which they did.Then Doc did the thing with the Srap Tasmaner.A gesture of reconciliation but also a way of shaming them for being such complete assholes.Maybe not a bad move when dealing with people who have been acculturated to be more reasonable, to get along with each other.People like us.People who have had to coexist in habitats forever.But to them it was a challenge to their authority in front of their flock and so they had to make an extreme reaction.To dehumanize us.We are the aliens, Einstein said.Yes, Ty said.We are the bug eyed monsters now.And the longer Bard and Beled are out lurking in the darkness The easier it gets for them to paint us as such, Ty said.And thats why they have us isolated.The leaders dont want us talking to their flockletting them see were only human.But hang on a sec, Einstein said.That means that the leaders must know we are not really bug eyed monsters.Ty had no response.Certain aspects of the situation were not really adding up.He considered it as they got the fire going and let themselves be hypnotized by the flames.After the beginning of the Hard Rain, no firein the sense of open burning of solid, carbon rich fuelhad been constructed by humansby Spacers, anywayfor 1,735 years.It had taken that long to build a habitat large enough to grow trees, with enough atmosphere to handle the oxygen demand of a fire and to absorb the resulting smoke.Ancient digitized Boy Scout manuals had been consulted.It had worked the first time.The four pyro pioneers responsibleall Dinanshad stood around it, staring into the flames as Ty was doing now, and probably thinking about all that had happened since the last time humans had smelled woodsmoke.He and Einstein had not even started in on the topic of Ariane.She was the worst nightmare of any Julian trying to live an honest life in Blue: someone ostensibly Blue who turns out to be a Red mole.How long had she been insinuating herself into intelligence, working her way up the ranks?Or had she only just decided to switch sides?In either case, she was up in the Red part of the ring now with the woman she had abducted.What must the Diggers make of that?Did they even know that there were two kinds of Spacers?And what was Red intelligence learning from that woman?Had Ty not watched her murder Remembrance in cold blood, hed have felt sorry for her.THREE PERSONS APPROACHED FROM THE MAIN DIGGER CAMP UNDER the gliders wings: a warrior with a steel headed lance; a middle aged, prematurely grizzled man with a grim look about him; and another whom Ty took for a boy until they drew closer and he saw that it was a short haired teenaged girl, even more diminutive than was typical among these people.She carried herself oddly, keeping her head tilted down and turned to one side, looking at the world through the corner of her eye, though this might have been necessitated by the fact that she was following close behind the grizzled man and needed to peek around his rib cage in order to see where she was going.Scampering over obstructions that he took in stride, she seemed to take two steps for his every one.She looked like nothing so much as a squirrel trying to keep pace with a dog.As they drew within speaking range the graybeard stopped the spearman with a nod, then took another pace forward.The girl faltered.Noting this, the graybeard made a gesture that encouraged her to venture a bit closer.She cringed up against his backside and peered out through his armpit.I am Donno, announced the graybeard.To me you may speak, but no others save the Psych here.Or at least that is what Ty thought he heard.I am Tyuratam Lake, Ty said.And this is Einstein.The woman there is Kath Two; she is unlikely to join the conversation.Tyuratam, said the Psych in a husky voice, a city in Central Asia, close to the Soviet space launch facility of Baikonur in Kazakhstan.Einstein, a theoretical physicist of the early twentieth century, before Zero.Donno heard the Psych out but did not look at her or make any sign of recognition.His attention was fixed on Ty.The words of the Psych were just a buzzing in his ear.When Kath Two awakens, you will tell her the rule I have just proclaimed, Donno said, and see to it that she abides by it.I will tell her the rule, Ty said, and she will keep her own counsel as to abiding by it.Over her I wield no authority.It is not how our society is organized.Donno looked as though he didnt believe a word of what Ty had just said.You are Dinan.So, they knew about the Seven Eves.How had they come by that knowledge?Abducting stragglers, interrogating them?Or had they been in covert contact with some Spacer?Yes, Ty said.You are the leader of the group.Ty said nothing.It seemed unlikely to work for him to explain that it was complicated.What did you do with Marge?Donno asked.Who is Marge?The woman who was taken up by the thing that reached down out of space.Ty was tempted to make the irritable point that Donno had just answered his own question.Instead he just stared back, wondering where to begin.The other mutanta Julian?Yes.She attacked you with your own weapon.You were surprised.Indeed I was, Donno.She betrayed you?Yes.Is she of the western people?To Donno, that would suggest the Spacers living in the part of Beringia west of 166 Thirty.Red is what we call them.Donno nodded as if hed heard it before.You are Blue, then.Yes, we are Blue.We avoid using Thors.Thor: a Germanic deity of immense strength, associated with lightning, armed with a hammer, the Psych said.Is your name short for Encyclopedia?Einstein asked her.Donno threw Einstein a killing look.Einstein was oblivious to it; he was looking at the girl with fascination and then some.Yes, she answered before Donno could stay her by raising his hand.She dodged away as if expecting to be cuffed, then smiled back at Einstein.Ty had just been rendered almost dizzy by a clear and sharp image from the Epic: a photograph that Rufus had emailed to Dinah shortly before the White Sky, depicting the library that he and his friends had assembled in their underground fastness.Proudly displayed in its center was a row of identically bound volumes called the Encyclopdia Britannica.This girlthe Cyc, not the Psychhad read it.She had physically handled those old books.Or perhaps handwritten copies of them.He is Ivyn, Donno said, nodding at Einstein.It wasnt a question.Then, his initial flash of anger having cooled, he took a more careful look at the kid from the RIZ.His eyelids look that way because of epicanthic folds, said the Cyc, who had been conducting an unnecessarily close inspection of the Ivyns face.Shut up, Donno told her.Then he turned his attention back to Ty.The Red Julian Ariane, Ty said.She was a spy within your ranks?So it would seem.Interesting.Rufuss library has some novels about such things, in the decades before Zero, but I never thought I would lay eyes on a real mole.It was an unusually long winded and revealing statement from Donno, and seemed to invite a witticism about moles and living underground, but Ty thought better of following up in that vein.I never thought I would lay eyes on someone like you, he tried.All these thousands of years, youve thought we were dead!Donno said.Well, you thought wrong.Before everything went to hell down there, Ty said, the old man Pop Loyd.Pop Loyd stated that we were not welcome here.He spoke truthfully, Donno said.I dont mean to be stupid, Ty said, but this is important and so I am sure you will agree with me that it is something I need to understand very clearly.Your groupdo you have a name for it?The human race, Donno said.Very well then, the human race is laying claim to this territory and doesnt wish people like usdescendants of the Seven Evesto be here at all.Not without our remit.That is correct.What is the territory you are laying exclusive claim to?I beg your pardon?This valley?This mountain range?All of Beringia?The entire land surface of the planet Earth, Donno said, shaking his head and uttering the words very clearly and slowly.Your people abandoned it.Its ours.That was a bit of a conversation stopper, at least where Ty was concerned.Einstein, however, blurted out the inevitable adolescent Ivyn question: What about the oceans?You will have to take that up with the Pingers, Donno said.Pingers?Donno looked at Einstein as if he were some kind of imbecile.The sea people, said the Cyc.They live but Donno raised his hand again and she went silent.So did everyone else.Which was how Donno seemed to prefer it.He now had a few moments leisure to look about.He nodded toward Kath Two.Is she sick?No, Ty said.Her kind sometimes sleep for long periods.Moiran, judging from her coloration?Ty was dying to know how the Diggers had come by their knowledge, rudimentary as it was, of the Spacers.But this was no time to ask.Yes, he said.Donno was now literally counting on his fingers.He got as far as five.The two fighters?Ty nodded.The big one is Teklan.And the ape man?A subrace of the Adans, called a Neoander.Donno nodded.We have seen his like in the west.He extended two more fingers.So in your group was one of each raceand?He nodded at Einstein.A spare Ivyn, for when the old one died?A local guide, Ty corrected him.We were a Seven, yes.That is a grouping that we create on special occasions, when we need a formal delegation.What he said next was guesswork, but he neednt worry about being contradicted at this point.The old Ivyn who is now deadDoc, we called himsuspected that you were down here.He came down to investigate, and he did so as part of a Seven.Befitting its importance.This seemed to throw Donno off balance.Clearly he was not the sort of man who much cared what other people thought.But it had now entered his mind for the first time that the events of some hours ago could be seen in another light: one that was hardly flattering to the Diggers.He could see this but he was hardly receptive to it.No doubt you see us as a bunch of savages.You do not even view your incursion on our lands as the aggressive act that it was.Coming here with your armed warriors, your glider, your Thor.Donno, how many Spacers do you imagine are on the surface of Earth right now?We are not ignorant.We know they are all over what you call Beringia.They are all over the world, Ty said.This, if it is true, does not change our position, Donno said.Your positions are strong and firmly stated, Ty said, after a longish interval during which he simply could not think of anything to say.May I ask then why it is you have come here to parley with me?Your warriors are taking ours, Donno complained.As one who knows something of warriors, Ty said, you can well imagine how this all looks to them.He closed his hand around the chain and gave it a little shake.Again, it was the wrong thing to say.The mere suggestion that it might be possible to look at a thing from more than one point of view was infuriating to these people.Ty needed to get that fact through his head.I understand that we are in a state of war, Donno said, and that there are prisoners of war on both sides.How would you like to proceed, then?Nonviolently, Donno said, which is more than I can say of some of the others.He nodded across to the other campfire.I await your proposal, then, Ty said.We await yours, Donno spat back, and turned to stalk away so abruptly that the Cyc had to scamper out of his path.The big galoot with the spear likewise turned to go.The Cyc was a little slower to disengage, however.She stayed where she was, maintaining visual lock on Einsteins epicanthic folds.Whats your name?Einstein asked her.Sonar Taxlaw!shouted Donno.Come!Now you know it, she said.She turned away with some reluctance and scurried down toward the glider.But even after she had rejoined her kin around their campfire, they could see her face, a pale moon aimed in their direction.Where to start?Ty asked.He was really talking to himself.But it seemed to jar Einstein out of a reverie.Einstein sighed and somehow pulled himself together.We have seen his like in the west.Donno said that.About Bard.Yes, he did.I guess the Diggers must have sent some scouts out across 166 Thirty.They would not have been aware that they were crossing a border.See, it is nothing more than an imaginary line.Ty couldnt help laughing.Einstein, if we ever get out of this, Im going to send you to charm school.Huh?Etiquette classes for Ivyns.How to talk to people of other races.Why?Never mind.I interrupted you.Go ahead.Those scouts must then have seen some Red border troops.Neoanders.And if you were in their moccasins, what would you think when you first laid eyes on a Neoander?Bug eyed, no.Monster, yes.Ty nodded.With due respect for Bard and his kin, it would have been better if the first Spacers they encountered had been Dinans.What of the Neoanders?Einstein asked.It took Ty a moment to follow.Hmm.If they saw the Diggers while the Diggers were seeing them, theyd have reported it.Red knew about the Diggers.Maybe a long time ago.Knew, or at least suspected, Ty agreed.He could feel parts of his brain relaxing as the mystery dissolved.They put their intelligence assets to work on it.Ariane started sniffing around for clues.Used her connections to Survey for all they were worth.Pulled strings to get assigned to the Seven.And brought home the prize.If you want to think of Marge as a prize, Einstein responded.Searching the boys face in firelight, Ty couldnt tell whether this was deadpan humor or just more social cluelessness.It didnt matter though.The Pingers!Einstein called out, as if it were obviously the next topic.Sonar Taxlaw said they were sea peoplebefore Donno shut her up, Ty said.Do you think he beats her?Einstein asked.It was such an emotional can of worms that Ty considered it carefully before answering.Once in his life, before the war, he had fallen for a girl as quickly as Einstein had for Sonar Taxlaw.That one brief experience with stupid blind love sufficed to make it possible for him to acknowledge its reality and respect its power.I think, he said, that their society is comfortable with corporal punishment to the point where what keeps people like her in line is the fear of it.Not the reality.I think theres nothing you can do about it and that if you do so much as look sideways at Donno he will kill you.But you can probably get away with small gestures of kindness toward the Cycassuming youre ever allowed near her again.If you show her too much favor she will be punished.If you touch her, were all dead.Why?Because this is one of those cultures that is psychotic about female reproductive organs.Now, lets get back to the Pingers.Name mean anything to you?No.You?said Einstein.Tys peroration had affected him terribly and reduced him to monosyllables.I have a vague recollection, Ty said, but I would have to look it up to be sure.Sea people suggests boats, Einstein said.But But wed have noticed those.Maybe its a contingent of Diggers that hides in the thick forests along the coast, Einstein tried.Donno claimed all the land, though, Ty said, and said the Pingers had jurisdiction over the oceans.So whats your theory?I dont have one, Ty said.He was lying.This ended the evenings conversation.They rolled out sleeping bags and bedded down.Ty slept surprisingly well.He woke up once, to the howling of wild canids.The volcanic eruptions that had been making the Ashwall so thick seemed to have abated, for the stars had come out and the habitat ring was now visible in the southern sky, the Eye shining somewhere above the Galpagos.The canids had spied it too, apparently.He crawled out of his bag to take a leak, then checked on Kath Two.She was shivering, her forehead hot, but not to a point that he considered alarming.They had taken his timepiece away from him, but he guessed it was about three in the morningtwelve hours, perhaps, since the Thor had touched down.Ariane and Marge would be reaching a Red habitat around now.For according to the inexorable laws of orbital mechanics, transfer time to geosync was always about twelve hours.He wondered if they were going to the Red capital of Kyoto, or to some military habitat, or even to the Kulak, hovering above the Makassar Strait.The booth would be crowded with the two of them in it.He could only speculate on what Marges state of mind must have been.The confrontation over the Srap Tasmaner most people would have considered strange, and violentthe stuff of bizarre post traumatic nightmares.She couldnt have seen her gunpoint abduction by Ariane coming.But all that was perfectly normal compared to what had happened next.It was unlikely Marge had looked into the sky and seen the Thor approaching.All she would have known was that suddenly she was trapped in a small booth with an armed mutant and experiencing powerful gee forces for the first time in her life.A few minutes later shed have known weightlessness.Probably not how Marge had seen her day shaping up when she had rolled out of the sack this morning.Had Ariane begun to interrogate her straightaway?Or played nice with her?Or perhaps just jabbed her with a dose of tranquilizer to tide her over for twelve hours?To Marge, the Thor just would have been unutterably bizarre.To Ty or any other Spacer, it was clearly an act of warthe most egregious violation of Treaty that he had heard of in twenty years.Though, come to think of it, hed picked up enigmatic snatches of conversation, exchanged between persons of import in the Crows Nest, hinting at dark doings in the South Seas.Presumably there was a reason that theywhoever they werehad chosen Beled Tomov as the Teklan member of the Seven.Beled whose back was cratered with scars that could only have resulted from pitched battle with whip cracking Neoanders.Likewise there was apparently more to Bard than met the eye.And Ty?He too was a veteran of ground combat with the scars to prove it.But there were many others who might have been chosen in his steadones better suited to leading an expedition and making first contact with what to the Spacers was an alien race from another planet.No, Ty had been chosen because of where he worked and who owned it.Very old money was behind the Crows Nest.And enough of it that its Owners didnt mind losing some every month to keep the place going.It was a kind of eleemosynary institution, created to serve not culture and not dukh, but a thing called the Purpose.And if Ty kept working there for another few decades, perhaps one of the Owners would sit him down one day in the Bolt Hole and deign to tell him what exactly the Purpose was.With all of that in his mind he somehow slipped back into sleep and did not awaken until the sun was up.The spear carrier came within range and tossed them three ration packets from the gliders stores.Einstein woke up and consumed his as only a teenaged boy was capable of doing.Ty ate at a more measured rate while keeping an eye on Kath Two.She had awakened long enough to remove the lid from her meal and pick at some of the blander offerings.But this led directly to vomiting, dry heaves, and a return to sleep.They passed the day in a desultory long range staredown with the Diggers, who grew fewer and more aggrieved as the hours wore on.Do you have a theory yet?Einstein asked him as they were consuming the midday ration toss.About what?The Pingers.Ty, having naught else to do, let his mouth run.The girls name.Sonar.I can think of a weird coincidence related to that.Yes?Einstein was all ears for anything related to Sonar Taxlaw.Its a technology they used before Zero.Undersea radar based on sound waves.They would send out pulses of sound called pings.You think the Pingers live under the sea?It all fits.Except ...Except what?Where the hell did they come from?Survivors?Like the Diggers?I dont see how its possible, Ty said.None of the scouts who went out looking for Bard and Beled returned.It was beginning to raise the question of who was really holding whom hostage.The ones whod gone missing had friends, parents, and children who soon became desperate to know what had become of them and began asking awkward questions of those in command.Late in the afternoon, the Diggers were reinforced by a band of some twenty additional warriors coming up the valley, carrying dead animals on long sticks.The Diggers all held a parley around their cookfire.After they had eaten their fill, Donno came up alone, using a short spear as a walking stick or a wizards staff.The sun had gone down, so Ty heard him before he saw him.We carry out an exchange, Donno announced, and you people get out of here without further casualties.Is that what you call murdering people?Ty wanted to ask.Instead, he said, Very well.How would you like to proceed?Well, Donno said, beginning to sputter a bit, we need to be able to communicate with them!But everyone we send out disappears!Would you like me to do it?Then youll just run away.It is not necessary to talk face to face, Ty said.You have radios?Donno asked suspiciously.Radio.A queer old word.The Diggers had searched them all, made sure they had no communication devices.No, Ty said.He leaned back and reached into an open ration pack, took out a piece of bread, tore off a bit of it.Dual sparks, all around, shone in the retinas of grizzled crows.Theyd brought a dozen of them on the glider, in modular cages made for traveling.The Diggers had inadvertently released them, and theyd been hanging around the campsite ever since.They knew what Ty was doing and were already jockeying for position, smacking one another with their wings and squawking.Ty held out his hand with the piece of bread on it, and almost before hed unfurled his fingers the morsel had been pecked out by a crow who was now regarding him intently.Beled.Bard, he said.The normal procedure was to display a picture of the recipient, but these birds had some ability to recognize names and map them onto faces, and during spare moments on the journey, the Seven had been training them.Our hosts wish to negotiate an exchange of prisoners.Ty closed his hand and waved the bird away.It flapped off into the gloom screaming the message.He looked at Donno and enjoyed the consternation on the Diggers face.We should hear back soon, he said.Donno turned without a word and strode back to the Digger campfire.Half an hour passed.It became fully dark.The canids began howling.Ty looked up into the sky expecting to see the habitat ring coming out.So did all the Diggers.But the ring was not the only bright thing in the sky tonight.There was also a meteor shower.A strangely orderly one.It seemed to be headed directly for them.Donno came running back, accompanied by more spearmen, all in an ugly mood.Is this an attack force?!he demanded.Coming to rescue you?So, Ty said, you know what those are?The pods you use to fall out of orbit, when you want to land a person quickly.Now, answer my question.This is Blue territory, Ty said, then held up a hand to suppress Donnos inevitable protest.According to Treaty.If Blue forces were coming to rescue us, they would simply fly over the mountains from Qayaqmuch easier than dropping people forty thousand kilometers from the habitat ring.He was willing himself to maintain eye contact with Donno and to keep his voice as relaxed and conversational as he could manage.The spearmen had fanned out to form a ring around their little camp, aiming the points of their weapons inward.Einstein really didnt like that, and Ty could hear links of chain clicking through the loops on the younger mans collar as he edged closer.Who are they, then?Donno demanded.By process of elimination, Ty said, they are Red.But you said you consider this Blue territory!Yes.You might be interested to know, Ty said, that this makes it a breach of Treaty, and an act of war.Donno stood gobsmacked.Ty was tempted to say Welcome to the modern world!but instead he added, You might wish to keep this in mind, if you sign a treaty with them.A grizzled crow landed on the ground nearby, and addressed Ty.We are coming.THAT THESE DROP PODS WERE OF MILITARY DESIGN WAS OBVIOUS from the way they came in: fast.Each had a set of vanes, mounted near the top, that sprang out when it was a couple of thousand meters above the surface, slowing its fall.But not until the pod was just a few tens of meters above the ground did its retro rockets come on: not just one but a circular array of thumb sized solids that created a cylindrical piston of fire on which the pod eased to a stop, coming to light on a tripod of buglike legs that deployed themselves at the last possible moment and absorbed the shock of contact.The first thirteen drop pods landed in a nearly perfect circular formation, about a kilometer down the valley.As soon as they touched down they sprang open.Their hatches faced inward.The pod ring thus presented nothing but armored backshells to any foes outside of it.Any foes inside were in for a bad time.Seconds later a fourteenth pod landed in the center and a man climbed out.On his signal, the thirteen somersaulted out of their pods and rolled sideways onto their bellies, looking outward into the space beyond, which was now well illuminated by blinding lights shining from the backshells.In actual battle the next procedure would have been to start killing anything they could see, but instead the leader shouted a command that caused all of them to stand up, holster their kats, and dust themselves off.Ten of the thirteen were Neoanders.Three others had the more normal modern human look.Those, and the one in the middle, were likely B types, or Betas: the most numerous of the Adan subraces.The pelotonfor that was the Adan term for a unit of this sizeadopted a parade rest position, facing outward and resisting the temptation to watch as four more drop pods landed in the space they had just circumscribed.The occupants of these were a little slower to climb out.It seemed evident that they were civilians who hadnt done it before.While they were doing so, another pod landed, this one outside the circle; it was of a somewhat different design, used to land cargo.The peloton moved forward to form a loose perimeter around this one.The civilians opened it and removed various items: most obviously, a few sections of tubing that they snapped together to form a pole.To the top of this, they affixed a circular hoop, creating a rather more stylish and high tech version of the circle on a stick totem that the Diggers favored.Below the hoop they tied on a red, fork tailed streamer, known in Blue vernacular as the Serpents Tongue, frequently used as a Red emblem in battle or, more usually, athletic competitions.And below that they attached a large white flag.The performance was so amusing that even Ty, who knew he should be attending to other things, was a little surprised when he noticed that the half dozen Digger warriors surrounding their little camp were all lying on the ground twitching helplessly.This had occurred so recently that some of their handmade spears were still toppling to the ground.In one of those peculiar, focused insights that comes to one when things are happening very fast, he noticed that the leaf shaped spearheads had been hand forged, and wondered idly if the metal had been scavenged from the truck theyd excavated.Naturally he looked toward the explosive device on the nearby cairn.He saw that the wires had been severed.A hand the size of a dinner plate appeared above the top of the cairn, scooped up the explosive charge, and hurled it into oblivion.Beled had materialized near the wooden stake, which he was examining in something like wonder.After trying its connection to the end of the chain, he knelt down, gripped it with both hands, and began pulling.Langobard, now that hed dispensed with the explosive, loped over to join him.Squatting, he scooped away some dirt to get better purchase, and added his strength.Half a meter of the stake suddenly emerged from the ground, causing both men to tumble back.From a semi reclining position, Bard swatted at it with one hand, as if shooing away an insect, and snapped it off at ground level.Ty, Einstein, and Kath were still chained together, but free to move.Since Bard was now operating in a more stealthy mode, he was not surrounded by a whining complex of aitrains; rather, he had gotten all of his flynks jacked together into a single long rope that was looped and draped around his torso in a complex pattern that Ty had seen before, and that he supposed had been developed by Neoanders over thousands of years.Ty reeled the stake fragment in, hand over handing the chain through his neck collar, and grabbed it in both hands like a club.He used its free end to scatter the campfire and darken the encampment.Kath, still half in her sleeping bag, was up on all fours, vomiting.Beled strode over to her, scooped one arm under her midsection, hoisted her up, and slung her over his shoulder.He had not really broken stride, and so the other two prisoners were now obliged to go with him.Langobard trailed the group, impulsively snatching up a spearas a keepsake?It had not been the most surgical extraction in the history of warfare.It was very far from being the most cack handed, however.More fighting might have ensued had the main encampment of Diggers not been utterly transfixed by the approach of the Red delegation.Ty was just allowing himself to believe that theyd gotten away clean when he heard a voice from out of the dark, only a few meters away: I found this.Directly the speaker was painted by a crossfire of red lasers from Beleds and Bards katapults.In the dark it was impossible to see her face, but Ty had already recognized the voice.Hold your fire, he said.The Cyc stepped closer.Bard risked illuminating her with a dim light.She was holding the lump of explosive in her hand.It must have rolled down the slope toward the main Digger encampment.Sonar Taxlaw, Ty said.You remembered!she exclaimed.
