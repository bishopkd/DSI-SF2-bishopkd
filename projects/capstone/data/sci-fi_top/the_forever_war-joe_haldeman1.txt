  PRIVATE MANDELLA    1  Tonight were going to show you eight silent ways to kill a man.The guy who said that was a sergeant who didnt look five years older than me.So if hed ever killed a man in combat, silently or otherwise, hed done it as an infant.I already knew eighty ways to kill people, but most of them were pretty noisy.I sat up straight in my chair and assumed a look of polite attention and fell asleep with my eyes open.So did most everybody else.Wed learned that they never scheduled anything important for these afterchop classes.The projector woke me up and I sat through a short tape showing the eight silent ways.Some of the actors must have been brainwipes, since they were actually killed.After the tape a girl in the front row raised her hand.The sergeant nodded at her and she rose to parade rest.Not bad looking, but kind of chunky about the neck and shoulders.Everybody gets that way after carrying a heavy pack around for a couple of months.Sir  we had to call sergeants sir until graduation  most of those methods, really, they looked  kind of silly.For instance?Like killing a man with a blow to the kidneys, from an entrenching tool.I mean, when would you actually have only an entrenching tool, and no gun or knife?And why not just bash him over the head with it?He might have a helmet on, he said reasonably.Besides, Taurans probably dont even have kidneys!He shrugged.Probably they dont.This was 1997, and nobody had ever seen a Tauran; hadnt even found any pieces of Taurans bigger than a scorched chromosome.But their body chemistry is similar to ours, and we have to assume theyre similarly complex creatures.They must have weaknesses, vulnerable spots.You have to find out where they are.Thats the important thing.He stabbed a finger at the screen.Those eight convicts got caulked for your benefit because youve got to find out how to kill Taurans, and be able to do it whether you have a megawatt laser or an emery board.She sat back down, not looking too convinced.Any more questions?Nobody raised a hand.OK.Tench hut!We staggered upright and he looked at us expectantly.Fuck you, sir, came the familiar tired chorus.Louder!FUCK YOU, SIR!One of the armys less inspired morale devices.Thats better.Dont forget, pre dawn maneuvers tomorrow.Chop at 0330, first formation, 0400.Anybody sacked after 0340 owes one stripe.Dismissed.I zipped up my coverall and went across the snow to the lounge for a cup of soya and a joint.Id always been able to get by on five or six hours of sleep, and this was the only time I could be by myself, out of the army for a while.Looked at the newsfax for a few minutes.Another ship got caulked, out by Aldebaran sector.That was four years ago.They were mounting a reprisal fleet, but itll take four years more for them to get out there.By then, the Taurans would have every portal planet sewed up tight.Back at the billet, everybody else was sacked and the main lights were out.The whole company, had been dragging ever since we got back from the two week lunar training.I dumped my clothes in the locker, checked the roster and found out I was in bunk 31.Goddammit, right under the heater.I slipped through the curtain as quietly as possible so as not to wake up the person next to me.Couldnt see who it was, but I couldnt have cared less.I slipped under the blanket.Youre late, Mandella, a voice yawned.It was Rogers.Sorry I woke you up, I whispered.Sallright.She snuggled over and clasped me spoonfashion.She was warm and reasonably soft.I patted her hip in what I hoped was a brotherly fashion.Night, Rogers.Gnight, stallion.She returned the gesture more pointedly.Why do you always get the tired ones when youre ready and the randy ones when youre tired?I bowed to the inevitable.2  Awright, lets get some goddamn back inta that!Stringer team!Move it up  move your ass up!A warm front had come in about midnight and the snow had turned to sleet.The permaplast stringer weighed five hundred pounds and was a bitch to handle, even when it wasnt covered with ice.There were four of us, two at each end, carrying the plastic girder with frozen fingertips.Rogers was my partner.Steel!the guy behind me yelled, meaning that he was losing his hold.It wasnt steel, but it was heavy enough to break your foot.Everybody let go and hopped away.It splashed slush and mud all over us.Goddammit, Petrov, Rogers said, why didnt you go out for the Red Cross or something?This fucken things not that fucken heavy.Most of the girls were a little more circumspect in their speech.Rogers was a little butch.Awright, get a fucken move on, stringers  epoxy team!Dogem!Dogem!Our two epoxy people ran up, swinging their buckets.Lets go, Mandella.Im freezin my balls off.Me, too, the girl said with more feeling than logic.One  two  heave!We got the thing up again and staggered toward the bridge.It was about three quarters completed.Looked as if the second platoon was going to beat us.I wouldnt give a damn, but the platoon that got their bridge built first got to fly home.Four miles of muck for the rest of us, and no rest before chop.We got the stringer in place, dropped it with a clank, and fitted the static clamps that held it to the rise beams.The female half of the epoxy team started slopping glue on it before we even had it secured.Her partner was waiting for the stringer on the other side.The floor team was waiting at the foot of the bridge, each one holding a piece of the light, stressed permaplast over his head like an umbrella.They were dry and clean.I wondered aloud what they had done to deserve it, and Rogers suggested a couple of colorful but unlikely, possibilities.We were going back to stand by the next stringer when the field first (name of Dougelstein, but we called him Awright) blew a whistle and bellowed, Awright, soldier boys and girls, ten minutes.Smokeem if you got em.He reached into his pocket and turned on the control that heated our coveralls.Rogers and I sat down on our end of the stringer and I took out my weed box.I had lots of joints, but we were ordered not to smoke them until after night chop.The only tobacco I had was a cigarro butt about three inches long.I lit it on the side of the box; it wasnt too bad after the first couple of puffs.Rogers took a puff, just to be sociable, but made a face and gave it back.Were you in school when you got drafted?she asked.Yeah.Just got a degree in physics.Was going after a teachers certificate.She nodded soberly.I was in biology  Figures.I ducked a handful of slush.How far?Six years, bachelors and technical.She slid her boot along the ground, turning up a ridge of mud and slush the consistency of freezing ice milk.Why the fuck did this have to happen?I shrugged.It didnt, call for an answer, least of all the answer that the UNEF kept giving us.Intellectual and physical elite of the planet, going out to guard humanity against the Tauran menace.Soyashit.It was all just a big experiment.See whether we could goad the Taurans into ground action.Awright blew the whistle two minutes early, as expected, but Rogers and I and the other two stringers got to sit for a minute while the epoxy and floor teams finished covering our stringer.It got cold fast, sitting there with our suits turned off, but we remained inactive on principle.There really wasnt any sense in having us train in the cold.Typical army half logic.Sure, it was going to be cold where we were going, but not ice cold or snow cold.Almost by definition, a portal planet remained within a degree or two of absolute zero all the time  since collapsars dont shine  and the first chill you felt would mean that you were a dead man.Twelve years before, when I was ten years old, they had.discovered the collapsar jump.Just fling an object at a collapsar with sufficient speed, and out it pops in some other part of the galaxy.It didnt take long to figure out the formula that predicted where it would come out: it travels along the same line (actually an Einsteinian geodesic) it would have followed if the collapsar hadnt been in the way until it reaches another collapsar field, whereupon it reappears, repelled with the same speed at which it approached the original collapsar.Travel time between the two collapsars  exactly zero.It made a lot of work for mathematical physicists, who had to redefine simultaneity, then tear down general relativity and build it back up again.And it made the politicians very happy, because now they could send a shipload of colonists to Fomalhaut for less than it had once cost to put a brace of men on the moon.There were a lot of people the politicians would love to see on Fomalhaut, implementing a glorious adventure rather than stirring up trouble at home.The ships were always accompanied by an automated probe that followed a couple of million miles behind.We knew about the portal planets, little bits of flotsam that whirled around the collapsars; the purpose of the drone was to come back and tell us in the event that a ship had smacked into a portal planet at .999 of the speed of light.That particular catastrophe never happened, but one day a drone limped back alone.Its data were analyzed, and it turned out that the colonists, ship had been pursued by another vessel and destroyed.This happened near Aldebaran, in the constellation Taurus, but since Aldebaranian is a little hard to handle, they named the enemy Tauran.Colonizing vessels thenceforth went out protected by an armed guard.Often the armed guard went out alone, and finally the Colonization Group got shortened to UNEF, United Nations Exploratory Force.Emphasis on the force.Then some bright lad in the General Assembly decided that we ought to field an army of footsoldiers to guard the portal planets of the nearer collapsars.This led to the Elite Conscription Act of 1996 and the most elitely conscripted army in the history of warfare.So here we were, fifty men and fifty women, with IQs over 150 and bodies of unusual health and strength, slogging elitely through the mud and slush of central Missouri, reflecting on the usefulness of our skill in building bridges on worlds where the only fluid is an occasional standing pool of liquid helium.3  About a month later, we left for our final training exercise, maneuvers on the planet Charon.Though nearing perihelion, it was still more than twice as far from the sun as Pluto.The troopship was a converted cattlewagon made to carry two hundred colonists and assorted bushes and beasts.Dont think it was roomy, though, just because there were half that many of us.Most of the excess space was taken up with extra reaction mass and ordnance.The whole trip took three weeks, accelerating at two gees halfway, decelerating the other half.Our top speed, as we roared by the orbit of Pluto, was around one twentieth of the speed of light  not quite enough for relativity to rear its complicated head.Three weeks of carrying around twice as much weight as normal its no picnic.We did some cautious exercises three times a day and remained horizontal as much as possible.Still, we got several broken bones and serious dislocations.The men had to wear special supporters to keep from littering the floor with loose organs.It was almost impossible to sleep; nightmares of choking and being crushed, rolling over periodically to prevent blood pooling and bedsores.One girl got so fatigued that she almost slept through the experience of having a rib push out into the open air.Id been in space several times before, so when we finally stopped decelerating and went into free fall, it was nothing but relief But some people had never been out, except for our training on the moon, and succumbed to the sudden vertigo and disorientation.The rest of us cleaned up after them, floating through the quarters with sponges and inspirators to suck up the globules of partly digested Concentrate, High protein, Low residue, Beef Flavor (Soya).We had a good view of Charon, coming down from orbit.There wasnt much to see, though.It was just a dim, off white sphere with a few smudges on it.We landed about two hundred meters from the base.A pressurized crawler came out and mated with the ferry, so we didnt have to suit up.We clanked and squeaked up to the main building, a featureless box of grayish plastic.Inside, the walls were the same drab color.The rest of the company was sitting at desks, chattering away.There was a seat next to Freeland.Jeff  feeling better?He still looked a little pale.If the gods had meant for man to survive in free fall, they would have given him a cast iron glottis.He sighed heavily.A little better.Dying for a smoke.Yeah.You seemed to take it all right.Went up in school, didnt you?Senior thesis in vacuum welding, yeah.Three weeks in Earth orbit.I sat back and reached for my weed box for the thousandth time.It still wasnt there.The Life Support Unit didnt want to handle nicotine and THC.Training was bad enough, Jeff groused, but this shit  Tench hut!We stood up in a raggedy ass fashion, by twos and threes.The door opened and a full major came in.I stiffened a little.He was the highest ranking officer Id ever seen.He had a row of ribbons stitched into his coveralls, including a purple strip meaning hed been wounded in combat, fighting in the old American army.Must have been that Indochina thing, but it had fizzled out before I was born.He didnt look that old.Sit, sit.He made a patting motion with his hand.Then he put his hands on his hips and scanned the company, a small smile on his face.Welcome to Charon.You picked a lovely day to land, the temperature outside is a summery eight point one five degrees Absolute.We expect little change for the next two centuries or so.Some of them laughed halfheartedly.Best you enjoy the tropical climate here at Miami Base; enjoy it while you can.Were on the center of sunside here, and most of your training will be on darkside.Over there, the temperature stays a chilly two point zero eight.You might as well regard all the training you got on Earth and the moon as just an elementary exercise, designed to give you a fair chance of surviving Charon.Youll have to go through your whole repertory here: tools, weapons, maneuvers.And youll find that, at these temperatures, tools dont work the way they should; weapons dont want to fire.And people move v e r y cautiously.He studied the clipboard in his hand.Right now, you have forty nine women and forty eight men.Two deaths on Earth, one psychiatric release.Having read an outline of your training program, Im frankly surprised that so many of you pulled through.But you might as well know that I wont be displeased if as few as fifty of you, half, graduate from this final phase.And the only way not to graduate is to die.Here.The only way anybody gets back to Earth  including me  is after a combat tour.You will complete your training in one month.From here you go to Stargate collapsar, half a light year away.You will stay at the settlement on Stargate 1, the largest portal planet, until replacements arrive.Hopefully, that will be no more than a month; another group is due here as soon as you leave.When you leave Stargate, you will go to some strategically important collapsar, set up a military base there, and fight the enemy, if attacked.Otherwise, you will maintain the base until further orders.The last two weeks of your training will consist of constructing exactly that kind of a base, on darkside.There you will be totally isolated from Miami Base: no communication, no medical evacuation, no resupply.Sometime before the two weeks are up, your defense facilities will be evaluated in an attack by guided drones.They will be armed.They had spent all that money on us just to kill us in training?All of the permanent personnel here on Charon are combat veterans.Thus, all of us are forty to fifty years of age.But I think we can keep up with you.Two of us will be with you at all times and will accompany you at least as far as Stargate.They are Captain Sherman Stott, your company commander, and Sergeant Octavio Cortez, your first sergeant.Gentlemen?Two men in the front row stood easily and turned to face us.Captain Stott was a little smaller than the major, but cut from the same mold: face hard and smooth as porcelain, cynical half smile, a precise centimeter of beard framing a large chin, looking thirty at the most.He wore a large, gunpowder type pistol on his hip.Sergeant Cortez was another story, a horror story.His head was shaved and the wrong shape, flattened out on one side, where a large piece of skull had obviously been taken out.His face was very dark and seamed with wrinkles and scars.Half his left ear was missing, and his eyes were as expressive as buttons on a machine.He had a moustache and beard combination that looked like a skinny white caterpillar taking a lap around his mouth.On anybody else, his schoolboy smile might look pleasant, but he was about the ugliest, meanest looking creature Id ever seen.Still, if you didnt look at his head and considered the lower six feet or so, he could have posed as the after advertisement for a body building spa.Neither Stott nor Cortez wore any ribbons.Cortez had a small pocket laser suspended in a magnetic rig, sideways, under his left armpit.It had wooden grips that were worn smooth.Now, before I turn you over to the tender mercies of these two gentlemen, let me caution you again:  Two months ago there was not a living soul on this planet, just some leftover equipment from the expedition of 1991.A working force of forty five men struggled for a month to erect this base.Twenty four of them, more than half, died in the construction of it.This is the most dangerous planet men have ever tried to live on, but the places youll be going will be this bad and worse.Your cadre will try to keep you alive for the next month.Listen to them  and follow their example; all of them have survived here much longer than youll have to.Captain?The captain stood up as the major went out the door.Tench hut!The last syllable was like an explosion and we all jerked to our feet.Now Im only gonna say this once so you better listen, he growled.We are in a combat situation here, and in a combat situation there is only one penalty for disobedience or insubordination.He jerked the pistol from his hip and held it by the barrel, like a club.This is an Army model 1911 automatic pistol, caliber .45, and it is a primitive but effective weapon.The Sergeant and I are authorized to use our weapons to kill to enforce discipline.Dont make us do it because we will.We will.He put the pistol back.The holster snap made a loud crack in the dead quiet.Sergeant Cortez and I between us have killed more people than are sitting in this room.Both of us fought in Vietnam on the American side and both of us joined the United Nations International Guard more than ten years ago.I took a break in grade from major for the privilege of commanding this company, and First Sergeant Cortez took a break from sub major, because we are both combat soldiers and this is the first combat situation since 1987.Keep in mind what Ive said while the First Sergeant instructs you more specifically in what your duties will be under this command.Take over, Sergeant.He turned on his heel and strode out of the room.The expression on his face hadnt changed one millimeter during the whole harangue.The First Sergeant moved like a heavy machine with lots of ball bearings.When the door hissed shut, he swiveled ponderously to face us and said, At ease, siddown,  in a surprisingly gentle voice.He sat on a table in the front of the room.It creaked, but held.Now the captain talks scary and I look scary, but we both mean well.Youll be working pretty closely with me, so you better get used to this thing Ive got hanging in front of my brain.You probably wont see the captain much, except on maneuvers.He touched the flat part of his head.And speaking of brains, I still have just about all of mine, in spite of Chinese efforts to the contrary.All of us old vets who mustered into UNEF had to pass the same criteria that got you drafted by the Elite Conscription Act.So I suspect all of you are smart and tough  but just keep in mind that the captain and I are smart and tough and experienced.He flipped through the roster without really looking at it.Now, as the captain said, therell be only one kind of disciplinary action on maneuvers.Capital punishment.But normally we wont have to kill you for disobeying; Charonll save us the trouble.Back in the billeting area, itll be another story.We dont much care what you do inside.Grab ass all day and fuck all night, makes no difference  But once you suit up and go outside, youve gotta have discipline that would shame a Centurian.There will be situations where one stupid act could kill us all.Anyhow, the first thing weve gotta do is get you fitted to your fighting suits.The armorers waiting at your billet; hell take you one at a time.Lets go.4  Now I know you got lectured back on Earth on what a fighting suit can do.The armorer was a small man, partially bald, with no insignia of rank on his coveralls.Sergeant Cortez had told us to call him sir, since he was a lieutenant.But Id like to reinforce a couple of points, maybe add some things your instructors Earthside werent clear about or couldnt know.Your First Sergeant was kind enough to consent to being my visual aid.Sergeant?Cortez slipped out of his coveralls and came up to the little raised platform where a fighting suit was standing, popped open like a man shaped clam.He backed into it and slipped his arms into the rigid sleeves.There was a click and the thing swung shut with a sigh.It was bright green with CORTEZ stenciled in white letters on the helmet.Camouflage, Sergeant.The green faded to white, then dirty gray.This is good camouflage for Charon and most of your portal planets, said Cortez, as if from a deep well.But there are several other combinations available.The gray dappled and brightened to a combination of greens and browns: Jungle.Then smoothed out to a hard light ochre: Desert.Dark brown, darker, to a deep flat black: Night or space.Very good, Sergeant.To my knowledge, this is the only feature of the suit that was perfected after your training.The control is around your left wrist and is admittedly awkward.But once you find the right combination, its easy to lock in.Now, you didnt get much in suit training Earthside.We didnt want you to get used to using the thing in a friendly environment.The fighting suit is the deadliest personal weapon ever built, and with no weapon is it easier for the user to kill himself through carelessness.Turn around, Sergeant.Case in point.He tapped a large square protuberance between the shoulders.Exhaust fins.As you know, the suit tries to keep you at a comfortable temperature no matter what the weathers like outside.The material of the suit is as near to a perfect insulator as we could get, consistent with mechanical demands.Therefore, these fins get hot especially hot, compared to darkside temperatures  as they bleed off the bodys heat.All you have to do is lean up against a boulder of frozen gas; theres lots of it around.The gas will sublime off faster than it can escape from the fins; in escaping, it will push against the surrounding ice, and fracture it  and in about one hundredth of a second, you have the equivalent of a hand grenade going off right below your neck.Youll never feel a thing.Variations on this theme have killed eleven people in the past two months.And they were just building a bunch of huts.I assume you know how easily the waldo capabilities can kill you or your companions.Anybody want to shake hands with the sergeant?He paused, then stepped over and clasped his glove.Hes had lots of practice.Until you have, be extremely careful.You might scratch an itch and wind up breaking your back.Remember, semi logarithmic response: two pounds pressure exerts five pounds force; three pounds gives ten; four pounds, twenty nine; five pounds, forty seven.Most of you can muster up a grip of well over a hundred pounds.Theoretically, you could rip a steel girder in two with that amplified.Actually, youd destroy the material of your gloves and, at least on Charon, die very quickly.Itd be a race between decompression and flash freezing.Youd die no matter which won.The leg waldos are also dangerous, even though the amplification is less extreme.Until youre really skilled, dont try to run, or jump.Youre likely to trip, and that means youre likely to die.Charons gravity is three fourths of Earth normal so its not too bad.But on a really small world, like Luna, you could take a running jump and not come down for twenty minutes, just keep sailing over the horizon.Maybe bash into a mountain at eighty meters per second.On a small asteroid, itd be no trick at all to run up to escape velocity and be off on an informal tour of intergalactic space.Its a slow way to travel.Tomorrow morning, well start teaching you how to stay alive inside this infernal machine.The rest of the afternoon and evening, Ill call you one at a time to be fitted.Thats all, Sergeant.Cortez went to the door and turned the stopcock that let air into the airlock.A bank of infrared lamps went on to keep air from freezing inside it.When the pressures were equalized, he shut the stopcock, unclamped the door and stepped in, clamping it shut behind him.A pump hummed for about a minute, evacuating the airlock; then he stepped out and sealed the outside door.It was pretty much like the ones on Luna.First I want Private Omar Almizar.The rest of you can go find your bunks.Ill call you over the squawker.Alphabetical order, sir?Yep.About ten minutes apiece.If your name begins with Z, you might as well get sacked.That was Rogers.She probably was thinking about getting sacked.5  The sun was a hard white point directly overhead.It was a lot brighter than I had expected it to be; since we were eighty AUs out, it was only one 6400th as bright as it is on Earth.Still, it was putting out about as much light as a powerful streetlamp.This is considerably more light than youll have on a portal planet.Captain Stotts voice crackled in our collective ear.Be glad that youll be able to watch your step.We were lined up, single file, on the permaplast sidewalk that connected the billet and the supply hut.Wed practiced walking inside, all morning, and this wasnt any different except for the exotic scenery.Though the light was rather dim, you could see all the way to the horizon quite clearly, with no atmosphere in the way.A black cliff that looked too regular to be natural stretched from one horizon to the other, passing within a kilometer of us.The ground was obsidian black, mottled with patches of white or bluish ice.Next to the supply hut was a small mountain of snow in a bin marked OXYGEN.The suit was fairly comfortable, but it gave you the odd feeling of simultaneously being a marionette and a puppeteer.You apply the impulse to move your leg and the suit picks it up and magnifies it and moves your leg for you.Today were only going to walk around the company area, and nobody will leave the company area.The captain wasnt wearing his .45  unless he carried it as a good luck charm, under his suit  but he had a laser finger like the rest of us.And his was probably hooked up.Keeping an interval of at least two meters between each person, we stepped off the permaplast and followed the captain over smooth rock.We walked carefully for about an hour, spiraling out, and finally stopped at the far edge of the perimeter.Now everybody pay close attention.Im going out to that blue slab of ice  it was a big one, about twenty meters away  and show you something that youd better know if you want to stay alive.He walked out in a dozen confident steps.First I have to heat up a rock  filters down.I squeezed the stud under my armpit and the filter slid into place over my image converter.The captain pointed his finger at a black rock the size of a basketball, and gave it a short burst.The glare rolled a long shadow of the captain over us and beyond.The rock shattered into a pile of hazy splinters.It doesnt take long for these to cool down.He stopped and picked up a piece.This one is probably twenty or twenty five degrees.Watch.He tossed the warm rock onto the ice slab.It skittered around in a crazy pattern and shot off the side.He tossed another one, and it did the same.As you know, you are not quite perfectly insulated.These rocks are about the temperature of the soles of your boots.If you try to stand on a slab of hydrogen, the same thing will happen to you.Except that the rock is already dead.The reason for this behavior is that the rock makes a slick interface with the ice  a little puddle of liquid hydrogen  and rides a few molecules above the liquid on a cushion of hydrogen vapor.This makes the rock or you a frictionless bearing as far as the ice is concerned, and you cant stand up without any friction under your boots.After you have lived in your suit for a month or so you should be able to survive falling down, but right now you just dont know enough.Watch.The captain flexed and hopped up onto the slab.His feet shot out from under him and he twisted around in midair, landing on hands and knees.He slipped off and stood on the ground.The idea is to keep your exhaust fins from making contact with the frozen gas.Compared to the ice they are as hot as a blast furnace, and contact with any weight behind it will result in an explosion.After that demonstration, we walked around for another hour or so and returned to the billet.Once through the airlock, we had to mill around for a while, letting the suits get up to something like room temperature.Somebody came up and touched helmets with me.William?She had MCCOY stenciled above her faceplate.Hi, Sean.Anything special?I just wondered if you had anyone to sleep with tonight.Thats right; Id forgotten.There wasnt any sleeping roster here.Everybody chose his own partner.Sure, I mean, uh, no  no, I havent asked anybody.Sure, if you want to  Thanks, William.See you later.I watched her walk away and thought that if anybody could make a fighting suit look sexy, itd be Sean.But even she couldnt.Cortez decided we were warm enough and led us to the suit room, where we backed the things into place and hooked them up to the charging plates.(Each suit had a little chunk of plutonium that would power it for several years, but we were supposed to run on fuel cells as much as possible. )After a lot of shuffling around, everybody finally got plugged in and we were allowed to unsuit ninety seven naked chickens squirming out of bright green eggs.It was cold  the air, the floor and especially the suits  and we made a pretty disorderly exit toward the lockers.I slipped on tunic, trousers and sandals and was still cold.I took my cup and joined the line for soya.Everybody was jumping up and down to keep warm.How c cold, do you think, it is, M Mandella?That was McCoy.I dont, even want, to think, about it.I stopped jumping and rubbed myself as briskly, as possible, while holding a cup in one hand.At least as cold as Missouri was.Umm  wish theyd, get some, fucken, heat in, this place.It always affects the small women more than anybody else.McCoy was the littlest one in the company, a waspwaist doll barely five feet high.Theyve got the airco going.It cant be long now.I wish I, was a big, slab of, meat like, you.I was glad she wasnt.6  We had our first casualty on the third day, learning how to dig holes.With such large amounts of energy stored in a soldiers weapons, it wouldnt be practical for him to hack out a hole in the frozen ground with the conventional pick and shovel.Still, you can launch grenades all day and get nothing but shallow depressions  so the usual method is to bore a hole in the ground with the hand laser, drop a timed charge in after its cooled down and, ideally, fill the hole with stuff.Of course, theres not much loose rock on Charon, unless youve already blown a hole nearby.The only difficult thing about the procedure is in getting away.To be safe, we were told, youve got to either be behind something really solid, or be at least a hundred meters away.Youve got about three minutes after setting the charge, but you cant just sprint away.Not safely, not on Charon.The accident happened when we were making a really deep hole, the kind you want for a large underground bunker.For this, we had to blow a hole, then climb down to the bottom of the crater and repeat the procedure again and again until the hole was deep enough.Inside the crater we used charges with a five minute delay, but it hardly seemed enough time  you really had to go it slow, picking your way up the craters edge.Just about everybody had blown a double hole; everybody but me and three others.I guess we were the only ones paying really close attention when Bovanovitch got into trouble.All of us were a good two hundred meters away.With my image converter turned up to about forty power, I watched her disappear over the rim of the crater.After that, I could only listen in on her conversation with Cortez.Im on the bottom, Sergeant.Normal radio procedure was suspended for maneuvers like this; nobody but the trainee and Cortez was allowed to broadcast.Okay, move to the center and clear out the rubble.Take your time.No rush until you pull the pin.Sure, Sergeant.We could hear small echoes of rocks clattering, sound conduction through her boots.She didnt say anything for several minutes.Found bottom.She sounded a little out of breath.Ice or rock?Oh, its rock, Sergeant.The greenish stuff.Use a low setting, then.One point two, dispersion four.God darn it, Sergeant, thatll take forever.Yeah, but that stuffs got hydrated crystals in it  heat it up too fast and you might make it fracture.And wed just have to leave you there, girl.Dead and bloody.Okay, one point two dee four.The inside edge of the crater flickered red with reflected laser light.When you get about half a meter deep, squeeze it up to dee two.Roger.It took her exactly seventeen minutes, three of them at dispersion two.I could imagine how tired her shooting arm was.Now rest for a few minutes.When the bottom of the hole stops glowing, arm the charge and drop it in.Then walk out, understand?Youll have plenty of time.I understand, Sergeant.Walk out.She sounded nervous.Well, you dont often have to tiptoe away from a twenty microton tachyon bomb.We listened to her breathing for a few minutes.Here goes.Faint slithering sound, the bomb sliding down.Slow and easy now.Youve got five minutes.Y yeah.Five.Her footsteps started out slow and regular.Then, after she started climbing the side, the sounds were less regular, maybe a little frantic.And with four minutes to go.Shit!A loud scraping noise, then clatters and bumps.Shit shit.Whats wrong, private?Oh, shit.Silence.Shit!Private, you dont wanna get shot, you tell me whats wrong!I  shit, Im stuck.Fucken rockslide  shit  DO SOMETHING!I cant move, shit I cant move I, I  Shut up!How deep?Cant move my, shit, my fucken legs.HELP ME  Then Goddammit use your arms  push!You can move a ton with each hand.Three minutes.She stopped cussing and started to mumble, in Russian, I guess, a low monotone.She was panting, and you could hear rocks tumbling away.Im free.Two minutes.Go as fast as you can.Cortezs voice was flat, emotionless.At ninety seconds she appeared, crawling over the rim.Run, girl  You better run.She ran five or six steps and fell, skidded a few meters and got back up, running; fell again, got up again  It looked as though she was going pretty fast, but she had only covered about thirty meters when Cortez said, All right, Bovanovitch, get down on your stomach and lie still.Ten seconds, but she didnt hear or she wanted to get just a little more distance, and she kept running, careless leaping strides, and at the high point of one leap there was a flash and a rumble, and something big hit her below the neck, and her headless body spun off end over end through space, trailing a red black spiral of flash frozen blood that settled gracefully to the ground, a path of crystal powder that nobody disturbed while we gathered rocks to cover the juiceless thing at the end of it  That night Cortez didnt lecture us, didnt even show up for nightchop.We were all very polite to each other and nobody was afraid to talk about it.I sacked with Rogers  everybody sacked with a good friend  but all she wanted to do was cry, and she cried so long and so hard that she got me doing it, too.7  Fire team A  move out!The twelve of us advanced in a ragged line toward the simulated bunker.It was about a kilometer away, across a carefully prepared obstacle course.We could move pretty fast, since all of the ice had been cleared from the field, but even with ten days, experience we werent ready to do more than an easy jog.I carried a grenade launcher loaded with tenth microton practice grenades.Everybody had their laser fingers set at a point oh eight dee one, not much more than a flashlight.This was a simulated attack  the bunker and its robot defender cost too much to use once and be thrown away.Team B, follow.Team leaders, take over.We approached a clump of boulders at about the halfway mark, and Potter, my team leader, said, Stop and cover.We clustered behind the rocks and waited for Team B.   Barely visible in their blackened suits, the dozen men and women whispered by us.As soon as they were clear, they jogged left, out of our line of sight.Fire!Red circles of light danced a half klick downrange, where the bunker was just visible.Five hundred meters was the limit for these practice grenades; but I might luck out, so I lined the launcher up on the image of the bunker, held it at a forty five degree angle and popped off a salvo of three.Return fire from the bunker started before my grenades even landed.Its automatic lasers were no more powerful than the ones we were using, but a direct hit would deactivate your image converter, leaving you blind.It was setting down a random field of fire, not even coming close to the boulders we were hiding behind.Three magnesium bright flashes blinked simultaneously about thirty meters short of the bunker.Mandella!I thought you were supposed to be good with that thing.Damn it, Potter  it only throws half a klick.Once we get closer, Ill lay em right on top, every time.Sure you will.I didnt say anything.She wouldnt be team leader forever.Besides, she hadnt been such a bad girl before the power went to her head.Since the grenadier is the assistant team leader, I was slaved into Potters radio and could hear B team talk to her.Potter, this is Freeman.Losses?Potter here  no, looks like they were concentrating on you.Yeah, we lost three.Right now were in a depression about eighty, a hundred meters down from you.We can give cover whenever youre ready.Okay, start.Soft click: A team, follow me.She slid out from behind the rock and turned on the faint pink beacon beneath her powerpack.I turned on mine and moved out to run alongside of her, and the rest of the team fanned out in a trailing wedge.Nobody fired while A team laid down a cover for us.All I could hear was Potters breathing and the soft crunch crunch of my boots.Couldnt see much of anything, so I tongued the image converter up to a log two intensification.That made the image kind of blurry but adequately bright.Looked like the bunker had B team pretty well pinned down; they were getting quite a roasting.All of their return fire was laser.They must have lost their grenadier.Potter, this is Mandella.Shouldnt we take some of the heat off B team?Soon as I can find us good enough cover.Is that all right with you?Private?Shed been promoted to corporal for the duration of the exercise.We angled to the right and lay down behind a slab of rock.Most of the others found cover nearby, but a few had to hug the ground.Freeman, this is Potter.Potter, this is Smithy.Freemans out; Samuels is out.We only have five men left.Give us some cover so we can get  Roger, Smithy.Click.Open up, A team.The Bs are really hurtin.I peeked out over the edge of the rock.My rangefinder said that the bunker was about three hundred fifty meters away, still pretty far.I aimed a smidgeon high and popped three, then down a couple of degrees, three more.The first ones overshot by about twenty meters; then the second salvo flared up directly in front of the bunker.I tried to hold on that angle and popped fifteen, the rest of the magazine, in the same direction.I should have ducked down behind the rock to reload, but I wanted to see where the fifteen would land, so I kept my eyes on the bunker while I reached back to unclip another magazine  When the laser hit my image converter, there was a red glare so intense it seemed to go right through my eyes and bounce off the back of my skull.It must have been only a few milliseconds before the converter overloaded and went blind, but the bright green afterimage hurt my eyes for several minutes.Since I was officially dead, my radio automatically cut off, and I had to remain where I was until the mock battle was over.With no sensory input besides the feel of my own skin (and it ached where the image converter had shone on it) and the ringing in my ears, it seemed like an awfully long time.Finally, a helmet clanked against mine.You okay, Mandella?Potters voice.Sorry, I died of boredom twenty minutes ago.Stand up and take my hand.I did so and we shuffled back to the billet.It must have taken over an hour.She didnt say anything more, all the way back  its a pretty awkward way to communicate  but after wed cycled through the airlock and warmed up, she helped me undo my suit.I got ready for a mild tongue lashing, but when the suit popped open, before I could even get my eyes adjusted to the light, she grabbed me around the neck and planted a wet kiss on my mouth.Nice shooting, Mandella.Huh?Didnt you see?Of course not  The last salvo before you got hit, four direct hits.
