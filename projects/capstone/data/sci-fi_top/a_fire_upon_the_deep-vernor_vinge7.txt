Some of the forest animals were more sophisticated  Twenty five days out, the army was stuck trying to get across the biggest valley yet.In the middle  mostly hidden by the forest  a river flowed down to the western sea.The walls of these valleys were like nothing Johanna had seen in the parks of Straum: If you took a cross section at right angles to the river, the walls made a "U" shape.They were cliff like steep at the high edges, then became slopes and finally a gentle plain where the river ran."That's how the ice gouges it," explained Woodcarver."There are places further up where I've actually watched it happen," and she showed Johanna explanations in the Dataset.That was happening more and more; Pilgrim and Woodcarver and sometimes even Scrupilo seemed to know more of a child's modern education than Johanna.They had already been across a number of smaller valleys.Getting down the steep parts was always tedious, but so far the paths had been good.Vendacious took them to the edge this latest valley.Woodcarver and staff stood under the forest cover just short of the dropoff.Some meters back, Johanna sat surrounded by Peregrine Wickwrackscar.The trees at this elevation reminded Johanna a little of pines.The leaves were narrow and sharp and lasted all year.But the bark was blistered white and the wood itself was pale blond.Strangest of all were the flowers.They sprouted purple and violet from the exposed roots of the trees.Tines' world had no analog of honeybees, but there was constant motion among the flowers as thumb sized mammals climbed from plant to plant.There were thousands of them, but they seemed to have no interest in anything except the flowers and the sweetness that oozed from them.She leaned back among the flowers and admired the view while the Queen gobbled with Vendacious.How many kilometers could you see from here?The air was as clear as she had even known it on Tines' world.East and west the valley seemed to stretch forever.The river was a silver thread where it occasionally showed through the forest of the valley floor.Pilgrim nudged her with a nose and nodded toward the Queen.Woodcarver was pointing this way and that over the dropoff."Argument is in the air.You want a translation?""Yeah. ""Woodcarver doesn't like this path," Pilgrim's voice changed to the tone the Queen used when speaking Samnorsk: "The path is completely exposed.Anyone on the other side can sit and count our every wagon.Even from miles away.[A mile is a fat kilometer. ]"Vendacious whipped his heads around in that indignant way of his.He gobbled something that Johanna knew was angry.Pilgrim chuckled and changed his voice to imitate the security chief's: "Your Majesty!My scouts have scoured the valley and far wall.There is no threat. ""You've done miracles, I know, but do you seriously claim to have covered that entire north face?That's five miles away, and I know from my youth that there are dozens of cavelets  you have those memories yourself. ""That stopped him!"said Pilgrim, laughing."C'mon.Just translate. "She was quite capable of interpreting body language and tone by now.Sometimes even the Tinish chords made sense."Hmph.Okay. "The Queen hiked her baby packs around and sat down.Her tone became conciliatory."If this weather weren't so clear, or if there were night times, we might try it, but  You remember the old path?Twenty miles inland from here?That should be overgrown by now.And the road coming back is  "  Gobble hiss from Vendacious, angry."I tell you, this is safe!We'll lose days on the other path.If we arrive late at Flenser's, all my work will be for nothing.You must go forward here. ""Oops," Pilgrim whispered, unable to resist a little editorializing, "Ol' Vendacious may have gone too far with that. "The Queen's heads arched back.Pilgrim's imitation of her human voice said, "I understand your anxiety, pack of my blood.But we go forward where I say.If that is intolerable to you, I will regretfully accept your resignation. ""But you need me!""Not that much. "Johanna suddenly realized that the whole mission could fall apart right here, without even a shot being fired.Where would we be without Vendacious?She held her breath and watched the two packs.Parts of Vendacious walked in quick circles, stopping for angry instants to stare at Woodcarver.Finally all his necks drooped."Um.My apologies, Your Majesty.As long as you find me of use, I beg to continue in your service. "Now Woodcarver relaxed, too.She reached to pet her puppies.They had responded with her mood, thrashing in their carriers and hissing."Forgiven.I want your independent advice, Vendacious.It has been miraculously good. "Vendacious smiled weakly."I didn't think the jerk had it in him," Pilgrim said near Johanna's ear.It took two dayarounds to reach the old path.As Woodcarver had predicted, it was overgrown.More: In places there was no sign of the path at all, just young trees growing from slumped earth.It would take days to get down the valley side this way.If Woodcarver had any misgivings about the decision, she didn't mention them to Johanna.The Queen was six hundred years old; she talked often enough about the inflexibility of age.Now Johanna was getting a clear example of what that meant.When they came to a washout, trees were cut down and a bridge constructed on the spot.It took a day to get by each such spot.But progress was agonizingly slow even where the path was still in place.No one rode in the carts now.The edge of the path had worn away, and the cart wheels sometimes turned on nothingness.On Johanna's right she could look down at tree crowns that were a few meters from her feet.They ran into the wolves six days along the detour, when they had almost reached the valley floor.Wolves.That's what Pilgrim called them anyway; what Johanna saw looked like gerbils.They had just completed a kilometer stretch of easy going.Even under the trees they could feel the wind, dry and warm and moving ceaselessly down the valley.The last patches of snow between the trees were being sucked to nothingness, and there was a haze of smoke beyond the north wall of the valley.Johanna was walking alongside Woodcarver's cart.Pilgrim was about ten meters behind, chatting occasionally with them.(The Queen herself had been very quiet these last days. )Suddenly there was a screech of Tinish alarm from above them.A second later Vendacious shouted from a hundred meters ahead.Through gaps in the trees, Johanna could see troopers on the next switchback above them unlimbering crossbows, firing into the hillside above them.The sunlight came dappled through the forest cover, bringing plenty of light but in splotches that broke and moved as the soldiers hustled about.Chaos, but   there were things up there that weren't Tines!Small, brown or gray, they flitted through the shadows and the splotches of light.They swept up the hillside coming upon the soldiers from the opposite direction that they were shooting."Turn around!Turn around. "Johanna screamed, but her voice was lost in the turmoil.Besides, who there could understand her?All of Woodcarver was peering up at the battle.She grabbed Johanna's sleeve."You see something up there?Where?"Johanna stuttered an explanation, but now Pilgrim had seen something too.His gobbled shouting came loud over the battle.He raced back up the trail to where Scrupilo was trying to get a cannon unlimbered."Johanna!Help me. "Woodcarver hesitated, then said, "Yes.It may be that bad.Help with the cannon, Johanna. "It was only fifty meters to the gun cart, but uphill.She ran.Something heavy smashed into the path just behind her.Part of a soldier!It twisted and screamed.Half a dozen gerbil sized hunks of fur were attached to the body, and its pelt was streaked with red.Another member fell past her.Another.Johanna stumbled but kept running.Wickwrackscar was standing heads together, just a few meters from Scrupilo.He was armed in every adult member  mouth knives and steel tines.He waved Johanna down next to him."We run on a nest of, of wolves. "His speech was awkward, slurred."Must be between here and path above.A lump, like a l'il castle tower.Gotta kill nest.Can you see?"Evidently he could not; he was looking all over.Johanna looked back up the hillside.There seemed to be less fighting now, just sounds of Tinish agony.Johanna pointed."You mean there, that dark thing?"Pilgrim didn't answer.His members were twitching, his mouth knives waving randomly.She leaped away from the flashing metal.He had already cut himself.Sound attack.She looked back along the path.She'd had more than a year to know the packs, and what she was seeing now was madness.Some packs were exploding, racing in all directions to distances where thought couldn't possibly be sustained.Others  Woodcarver on her cart  huddled in heaps, with scarcely a head showing.Just beyond the nearest uphill trees she could see a gray tide.The wolves.Each furry lump looked innocent enough.All together Johanna froze for an instant, watching them tear out the throat of a trooper's member.Johanna was the only sane person left, and all it would mean is she would know she was dying.Kill the nest.On the gun cart beside her only one of Scrupilo was left, old White Head.Daffy as ever, it had pulled down its gunner's muffs and was nosing around under the gun tube.Kill the nest.Maybe not so daffy after all!Johanna jumped up on the wagon.It rolled back toward the dropoff, banging against a tree; she scarcely noticed.She pulled up the gun barrel, just as she had seen in all the drills.The white headed one pulled at the powder bag, but with just his one pair of jaws he couldn't handle it.Without the rest of its pack it had neither hands nor brains.It looked up at her, its eyes wide and desperate.She grabbed the other end of the bag, and the two of them got the powder into the barrel.White Head dived back into the equipment, nosing around for a cannon ball.Smarter than a dog, and trained.Between them, maybe they had a chance!Just half a meter beneath her feet, the wolves were running by.One or two she could have fought off herself.But there were dozens down there, worrying and tearing at random members.Three of Pilgrim were standing around Scarbutt and the pups, but their defense was unthinking slashing.The pack had dropped its mouth knives and tines.She and White Head got the round down the barrel.White Head whipped back to the rear, began playing with the little wick lighter the gunners used.It was something that could be held in a single mouth, since only one member actually fired the weapon."Wait, you idiot!"Johanna kicked him back."We gotta aim this thing!"White Head looked hurt for an instant.The complaint wasn't completely clear to him.He had dropped the standoff wand, but still held the lighter.He flicked on the flame, and circled determinedly back, tried to worm past Johanna's legs.She pushed him back again, and looked uphill.The dark thing.That must be the nest.She tilted the gun tube on its mounting and sighted down the top.Her face ended up just centimeters from the persistent White Head and his flame.His muffed head darted forward, and the flame touched the fire hole.The blast almost knocked Johanna off the cart.For a moment she could think of nothing but the pain that stabbed into her ears.She rolled to a sitting position, coughing in the smoke.She couldn't hear anything beyond a high pitched ringing that went on and on.Their little wagon was teetering, one wheel hanging over the dropoff.White Head was flopping around under the butt of the cannon.She pushed it off him and patted the muffed head.He was bleeding  or she was.She just sat dazed for a few seconds, mystified by the blood, trying to imagine how she had ever ended up here.A voice somewhere in the back of her head was screaming.No time, no time.She forced herself to her knees and looked around, memories coming back painfully slow.There were splintered trees uphill of them; the blond wood glinted among the leaves.Beyond them, where the nest had been, she saw a splash of fresh turned earth.They had "killed" it, but the fighting continued.There were still wolves on the path, but now they were the ones running in all directions.As she watched, dozens of them catapulted off the edge of trail into the trees and rocks below.And the Tines were actually fighting now.Pilgrim had picked up his knives.The blades and his muzzles dripped red as he slashed.Something gray and bleeding flew over the edge of the cart and landed by Johanna's leg.The "wolf" couldn't have been more than twenty centimeters long, its hair dirty gray brown.It really did look like a pet, but the tiny jaws clicked with murderous intent at her ankles.Johanna dropped a cannon ball on it.During the next three days, while Woodcarver's people struggled to bring their equipment and themselves back together, Johanna learned quite a bit about the wolves.What she and Scrupilo's White Head did with cannon had stopped the attack cold.Without doubt, knocking out the nest had saved a lot of lives and the expedition itself.The "wolves" were a type of hive creature, only a little like the packs.The Tines race used group thought to reach high intelligence; Johanna had never seen a rational pack of more than six members.The wolf nests didn't care about high intelligence.Woodcarver claimed that a nest might have thousands of members  certainly the one they'd tripped over was huge.Such a mob couldn't be as smart as a human.In terms of raw reasoning power, it probably wasn't much brighter than a single pack member.On the other hand, it could be a lot more flexible.Wolves could operate alone at great distances.When within a hundred meters of the home nest they were appendages of the "queen" members of the nest, and no one doubted their canniness then.Pilgrim had legends of nests with almost packish intelligence, of foresters who made treaties with nearby nests for protection in return for food.As long as the high powered noises in the nest lived, the worker wolves could coordinate almost like Tine members.But kill the nest, and the creature fell apart like some cheap, star topology network.Certainly this nest had done a number on Woodcarver's army.It had waited quietly until the troopers were within its inner loudness.Then outlying wolves had used synchronized mimicry to create sonic "ghosts", tricking the packs into turning from the nest and shooting uselessly into the trees.And when the ambush actually began, the nest had screamed concentrated confusion down on the Tines.That attack had been a far more powerful thing than the "stink noise" they'd encountered in other parts of the forest.To the Tines, the stinkers had been painfully loud and sometimes even frightening, but not the mind destroying chaos of the wolf nest attack.More than one hundred packs had been knocked out in the ambush.Some, mostly packs with pups, had huddled.Others, like Scrupilo, had been "blasted apart".In the hours following the attack, many of these fragments straggled back and reassembled.The resulting Tines were shaken but unharmed.Intact troops hunted up and down the forested cliffs for injured members of their comrades.There were places along the dropoff that were more than twenty meters deep.Where their fall wasn't cushioned by tree boughs, members landed on naked rock.Five dead ones were eventually found, and another twenty seriously injured.Two carts had fallen.They were kindling, and their kherhogs were too badly injured to survive.By great good luck, the gunshot had not started a forest fire.Three times the sun made its vast, tilted course around the sky.Woodcarver's army recovered in a camp in the depths of the valley forest, by the river.Vendacious had posted lookouts with signaling mirrors on the northern valley wall.This place was about as safe as any they could find so far north.It was certainly one of the most beautiful.It didn't have the view of the high forest, but there was the sound of the river nearby, so loud it drowned the sighing of the dry wind.The lowland trees didn't have root flowers, but they were still different from what Johanna had known.There was no underbrush, just a soft, bluish "moss" that Pilgrim claimed was actually part of the trees.It stretched like mown parkland to the edge of the river.On the last day of their rest, the Queen called a meeting of all the packs not at guard or lookout.It was the largest collection of Tines Johanna had seen in one place since her family was killed.Only these ones weren't fighting.As far as Johanna could see across the bluish moss, there were packs, each at least eight meters from its nearest neighbor.For an absurd instant she was reminded of Settlers Park at Overby: Families picnicking on the grass, each with its own traditional blanket and food lockers.But these "families" were each a pack, and this was a military formation.The rows were gently curving arcs all facing toward the Queen.Peregrine Wickwrackscar was ten meters behind her, in shadow; being Queen's consort didn't count for anything official.On Woodcarver's left lay the living casualties of the ambush, members with bandages and splints.In some ways, such visible damage wasn't the most horrifying.There were also what Pilgrim called the "walking wounded".These were singletons and duos and trios that were all that was left of whole packs.Some of these tried to maintain a posture of attention, but others mooned about, occasionally breaking into the Queen's speech with aimless words.It was like Scriber Jaqueramaphan all over again, but most of these would live.Some were already melding, trying to make new individuals.Some of these might even work out, as Peregrine Wickwrackscar had done.For most, it would be a long time before they were fully people again.Johanna sat with Scrupilo in the first rank of troopers before the Queen.The Commander of Cannoneers stood at Tinish parade rest: rumps on the ground, chest high, most heads facing front.Scrup had come through it without serious damage.His white head had a few more scorch marks, and one of the other members had sprained a shoulder falling off the path.He wore his flying cannoneer muffs as flamboyantly as always, but there was something subdued about him  maybe it was just the military formation and getting a medal for heroism.The Queen was wearing her special jackets.Each head looked out at a different section of her audience.Johanna still couldn't understand Tinish, and would certainly never speak it without mechanical assistance.But the sounds were mostly within her range of hearing  the "low" frequencies carried a lot better than higher ones.Even without memory aides and grammar generators she was learning a little.She could recognize emotional tone easily, and things like the raucous ark ark ark that passed for applause around here.As for individual words  well, they were more like chords, single syllables that had meaning.Nowadays, if she listened really carefully (and Pilgrim weren't nearby to give a running translation) she could even recognize some of those.Just now, for instance, Woodcarver was saying good things about her audience.Approving ark ark's came from all directions.They sounded like a bunch of sea'mals.One of the Queen's heads dipped into a bowl, came up with a small carven doodad in its mouth.She spoke a pack's name, a multichord tumptititum that if Johanna heard often enough she might be able to repeat as "Jaqueramaphan"  or even see meaning in, as "Wickwrackscar".From the front rank of the audience, a single member trotted toward the Queen.It stopped practically nose to nose with the Queen's nearest member.Woodcarver said something about bravery, and then two of her fastened the wooden  broach?to the member's jacket.It turned smartly and returned to its pack.Woodcarver picked out another decoration, and called on another pack.Johanna leaned over toward Scrupilo."What's going on?"she said wonderingly."Why are single members getting medals?"And how can they stand to get so near another pack?Scrupilo had been standing more stiffly at attention than most packs, and was pretty much ignoring her.Now he turned one head in her direction."Shh!"He started to turn back, but she grabbed him by one of his jackets."Foolish one," he finally replied."The award is for the whole pack.One member is extended to accept.More would be madness. "Hmm.One after another, three more packs "extended a member" to take their decorations.Some were full of precision, like human soldiers in stories.Others started out smartly, then became timid and confused as they approached Woodcarver.Finally Johanna said, "Ssst.Scrupilo!When do we get ours?"This time he didn't even look at her; all his heads faced rigidly toward the Queen."Last, of course.You and I killed the nest, and saved Woodcarver herself. "His bodies were almost shaking with the intensity of their brace.He's scared witless.And suddenly Johanna guessed why.Apparently Woodcarver had no problem maintaining her mind with one outside member nearby.But the reverse would not be true.Sending one of yourself into another pack meant losing some consciousness and placing trust in that other pack.Looking at it that way well, it reminded Johanna of the historical novels she used to play.On Nyjora during the Dark Age, ladies traditionally gave their sword to their queen when granted audience, and then knelt.It was a way to swear loyalty.Same thing here, except that looking at Scrupilo, Johanna realized that even as a matter of form, the ceremony might be damn frightening.Three more medals bestowed, and then Woodcarver gobbled the chords that were Scrupilo's name.The Commander of Cannoneers went absolutely rigid, made faint whistling noises through his mouths."Johanna Olsndot," said Woodcarver, then more Tinish, something about coming forward.Johanna stood up, but not one of Scrupilo moved.The Queen made a human laugh.She was holding two polished broaches."I'll explain all in Samnorsk later, Johanna.Just come forward with one of Scrupilo.Scrupilo?"Suddenly they were the center of attention, with thousands of eyes watching.There was no more arking or background chatter.Johanna hadn't felt so exposed since she played First Colonist in her school's Landing Play.She leaned down so that her head was close to one of Scrupilo's."Come on, guy.We're the big heroes. "The eyes that looked back at her were wide."I can't. "The words were almost inaudible.For all his jaunty cannoneer muffs and standoffish manner, Scrupilo was terrified.But for him it wasn't stage fright."I can't tear me apart so soon.I can't. "There was murmured gobbling in the ranks behind them, Scrupilo's own cannoneers.By all the Powers, would they hold this against him?Welcome to the middle ages.Stupid people.Even cut to pieces, Scrupilo had saved their behinds, and now  She put her hands on two of his shoulders."We did it before, you and I.Remember?"The heads nodded."Some.That one part of me alone could never have done it. ""Right.And neither could I.  But together we killed a wolf nest. "Scrupilo stared at her a second, eyes wavering."Yes, we really did. "He came to his feet, frisked his heads so the cannoneer muffs flapped."Yes!"And he moved his white headed one closer to her.Johanna straightened.She and White Head walked out into the open space.Four meters.Six.She kept the fingertips of one hand lightly on his neck.When they were about twelve meters from the rest of Scrupilo, White Head's pace faltered.He looked sideways, up at Johanna, then continued more slowly.Johanna didn't remember much of the ceremony, so much of her attention was on White Head.Woodcarver said something long and unintelligible.Somehow they both ended up with intricately carven decorations on their collars, and were headed back toward the rest of Scrupilo.Then she was aware of the crowd once more.They stretched as far as she could see under the forest canopy  and every one of them seemed to be cheering, Scrup's cannoneers loudest of all.Midnight.Here at the bottom of the valley there were three or four hours of the dayaround when the sun dipped behind the high north wall.It didn't much feel like night, or even twilight.The smoke from the fires to the north seemed to getting worse.She could smell it now.Johanna walked back from the cannoneers section toward the center of camp, and Woodcarver's tent.It was quiet; she could hear little creatures scritching in the root bushes.The celebrating might have gone on longer, except that everyone knew that in another few hours they would be preparing for the climb up the valley's north wall.So now there was only occasional laughter, an occasional pack walking about.Johanna walked barefoot, her shoes slung over her shoulders.Even in the dry weather, the moss was wonderfully soft between her toes.Above her the forest canopy was shifting green and patches of hazy sky.She could almost forget what had gone before, and what lay ahead.The guards around Woodcarver's tent didn't challenge her, just called softly ahead.After all, there weren't that many humans running around.The Queen stuck out a head, "Come inside, Johanna. "Inside, she was sitting in her usual circle, the puppies protected in the middle.It was quite dark, the only light being what came through the entrance.Johanna flopped down on the pillows where she usually slept.Ever since this afternoon, the big award thing, she had been planning to give Woodcarver a piece of her mind.Now well the party at the cannoneers had been a happy thing.It seemed kind of a shame to break the mood.Woodcarver cocked a head at her.Simultaneously, the two puppies duplicated the gesture."I saw you at the party.You are a sober one.You eat most of our foods now, but none of the beer. "Johanna shrugged.Yes, why?"Kids aren't supposed to drink before they're eighteen years old. "That was the custom, and her parents had agreed with it.Johanna had turned fourteen a couple of months ago; Dataset had reminded her of the exact hour.She wondered.If none of this had happened, if she were still back at the High Lab or Straumli Realm: would she be sneaking out with friends to try such forbidden things?Probably.Yet here, where she was entirely on her own, where she was currently a big hero, she hadn't tried a drop Maybe it was because Mom and Dad weren't here, and following their wishes seemed to keep them closer.She felt tears coming to her eyes."Hmm. "Woodcarver didn't seem to notice."That's what Pilgrim said was the reason. "She tapped at her puppies and smiled."I guess it makes sense.These two don't get beer till they're older  though I know they got some second hand partying from me tonight. "There was a hint of beer breath in the tent.Johanna wiped roughly at her face.She really did not want to talk about being a teenager just now."You know, that was kind of a mean trick you pulled on Scrupilo this afternoon. ""I  Yes.I talked to him about it beforehand.He didn't want it, but I thought he was just being is stiff necked the word?If I had known how upset he was, well  "  "He practically fell apart out there in front of everybody.If I understand how things work, that would have been his disgrace, right?"" Yes.Exchanging honor for loyalty in front of peers, it's an important thing.At least the way I run things; I'm sure Pilgrim or Dataset can say a dozen other ways to lead.Look Johanna, I needed that Exchange, and I needed you and Scrupilo to be there. ""Yeah, I know.'We two saved the day. '""Silence!"Her voice was suddenly edged, and Johanna remembered that this was a medieval queen."We are two hundred miles north of my borders, almost to the heart of the Flenser Domain.In a few days we will meet the enemy, and more of us will die for we know not quite what. "The bottom dropped out of Johanna's stomach.If she couldn't get back to the ship, couldn't finish what Mom and Dad had started "Please, Woodcarver!It is worth it!""I know that.Pilgrim knows it.The majority of my council agrees, though grudgingly.But we of the council have talked with Dataset.We've seen your worlds and what your science can do.On the other hand, most of my people here," she waved a head at the camp beyond the tent, "are here on faith, and out of loyalty to me.For them, the situation is deadly and the goal is vague. "She paused, though her two pups continued gesturing forcefully for a second."Now I don't know how you would persuade your kind to take such risks.Dataset talks of military conscription. ""That was Nyjora, long ago. ""Never mind.The point is, my troops are here out of loyalty, mostly to me personally.For six hundred years, I have protected my people well; their memories and legends are clear on it.More than once, I was the only one who saw a peril, and it was my advice that saved all those who heeded it.That is what keeps most of the soldiers, most of the cannoneers going.Each of them is free to turn back.So.What should they think when our first 'combat' is to fall like ignorant tourists onto a nest of wolves?Without the great good luck of you and part of Scrupilo being at the right place and alert, I would have been killed.Pilgrim would have been killed.Perhaps a third of the soldiers would have died. ""If not us, perhaps someone else," Johanna said in a small voice."Perhaps.I don't think anyone else came close to firing on the nest.You see the effect on my people?'If bad luck in the forest can kill our Queen and destroy our marvelous weapons, what will it be like when we face a thinking enemy?'That was the question in many minds.Unless I could answer it, we'd never make it out of this valley  at least not going northward. ""So you gave the medals.Loyalty for honor. ""Yes.You missed the sense of it, not understanding Tinish.I made a big thing of how well they had done.I gave silverwood accolades to packs who showed any competence during the ambush.That helped some.I repeated my reasons for this expedition  the wonders that Dataset describes and how much we lose if Steel gets his way.But they've heard all that before, and it points to far away things they can scarcely imagine.The new thing I showed them today was you and Scrupilo. ""Us?""I praised you beyond the skies.Singletons often do brave things.Sometimes they are halfway clever, or talk as though they are.But alone, Scrupilo's fragment wouldn't be much more than a good knife fighter.He knew about using the cannon, but he didn't have the paws or mouths to do anything with it.And by himself, he would never have figured out where to shoot it.You, on the other hand, are a Two Legs.In many ways you are helpless.The only way you can think is by yourself, but you can do it without interfering with those around you.Together you did what no pack could do in the middle of a wolf nest attack.So I told my army what a team our two races could become, how each makes up for the age long failings of the other.Together, we are one step closer to being the Pack of Packs.How is Scrupilo?"Johanna smiled faintly."Things turned out okay.Once he was able to get out there and accept his medal," she fingered the broach that was pinned to her own collar; it was a beautiful thing, a landscape of Woodcarver's city, "once he'd done that, he was totally changed.You should have seen him with the cannoneers afterwards.They did their own loyalty/honor thing, and then they drank a lot of beer.Scrupilo was telling them all about what we were doing.He even had me help demonstrate You really think the army bought what you said about humans and Tines?""I think so.In my own language, I can be very eloquent.I've bred myself to be. "Woodcarver was silent for a moment.Her puppies scrambled across the carpet, and patted their muzzles at Johanna's hands."Besides it may even be true.Pilgrim is sure of it.You can sleep in this same tent with me and still think.That's something that he and I can't do; in our own ways, we've each lived a long time and I think we are each at least as smart as the humans and other creatures that Dataset talks about in the Beyond.But you singleton creatures can stand next to each other, and think and build.Compared to us, I'll bet singleton races developed the sciences very fast.But now, with your help, maybe things will change fast for us, too. "The two puppies retreated, and Woodcarver lowered heads to paws."That's what I told my people, anyway You should try to get some sleep now. "On the ground beyond the tent's entrance there were already splashes of sunlight."Okay. "Johanna slipped off her outer clothes.She lay down and dragged a light quilt across herself.Most of Woodcarver already looked asleep.As usual, one or two pairs of eyes were open, but their intelligence would be limited  and just now, even they looked tired.Funny, Woodcarver had worked with Dataset so much, her human voice had come to capture emotion as well as pronunciation.Just now she had sounded so tired, so sad.Johanna reached out from under her quilt to brush the neck of Woodcarver's nearest, the blind one."Do you believe what you told everyone?"she said softly.One of the "sentry" heads looked at her, and a very human sigh seemed to come from all directions.Woodcarver's voice was very faint."Yes but I am very afraid that it doesn't matter any more.For six hundred years, I have had proper confidence in myself.But what happened on the south wall   should not have happened.It would not if I had followed Vendacious's advice, and come down on the New Road. ""But we might have been seen  "  "Yes.A failure either way, don't you see?Vendacious has precise information from the highest councils of the Flenser.But he's something of a careless fool in everyday matters.I knew that, and thought I could compensate.But the Old Road was in far worse condition than I remembered; the wolf nest could never have settled by it if there had been any traffic during the last few years.If Vendacious had managed his patrols properly, or if I had been managing him properly, we would never have been surprised.Instead we were nearly overrun and my only remaining talent appears to be in fooling those who trust me into thinking I still know what I'm doing. "She opened another pair of eyes and made the smile gesture."Strange.I haven't said these things even to Pilgrim.Is this another 'advantage' of human relations?"Johanna patted the blind one's neck."Maybe. ""Anyway, I believe what I said about things that could be, but I fear the my soul may not be strong enough to make them so.Perhaps I should turn things over to Pilgrim or Vendacious; that's something I must think on. "Woodcarver shhed Johanna's surprised protests."Now sleep please. "There was a time when Ravna thought their tiny ship might fly all the way to the Bottom unnoticed.Along with everything else, that had changed.At the moment, Out of Band II might be the most famous star ship known to the Net.A million races watched the chase.In the Middle Beyond there were vast antenna swarms beaming in their direction and listening to the news  mostly lies  sent from ships that

to find hope, trying to prove to herself that she was doing the right thing.By now, she was pretty sure what was chasing them.No doubt even Pham and Blueshell would have agreed on that.Why they were being chased, and what they might find at the end was now the subject of endless speculation on the Net.As usual, whatever the truth might be was well hidden among the lies.Crypto: 0  As received by:

few seconds ago) assuring me that the habitations of Sjandra Kei suffered collisional damage within the last six days.So apparently the "Alliance for the Defense" has taken the military action they claimed earlier.And apparently, they are powerful enough to destroy small civilizations in the Middle Beyond.The question still remains: "Why?"I have already posted arguments showing it unlikely that Homo sapiens is especially controllable by the Blight (though they were stupid enough to create that entity).Even the Alliance's own reports admit that less than half of Sjandra Kei's sophonts were of that race.Now a large part of the Alliance fleet is chasing into the Bottom of the Beyond after a single ship.What conceivable damage can the Alliance do to the Blight down there?The Blight is a great threat, perhaps the most novel and threatening in well recorded history.Nevertheless, Alliance behavior appears destructive and pointless.Now that the Alliance has revealed some of its sponsoring organizations (see messages [id numbers]), I think we know its real motives.I see connections between the Alliance and the old Aprahant Hegemony.A thousand years ago, that group had a similar jihad, grabbing real estate left vacant by recent Transcendences.Stopping the Hegemony was an exciting bit of action in that part of the galaxy.I think these people are back, taking advantage of the general panic attending the Blight (which is admittedly a much greater threat).My advice: Beware of the Alliance and its claims of heroic efforts.Crypto: 0  As received by: OOB shipboard ad hoc  Language

since Fall of Sjandra Kei  Key phrases: Hanse fraudulent?Text of message:  We have no special inclination toward any of the posters on this thread.Nevertheless, it's remarkable that an entity that has not revealed its location or special interests  namely "Hanse"  should be smearing the efforts of the Alliance for the Defense.The Alliance kept its constituents secret only during that period when its forces were being gathered, when a single stroke of the Perversion's power might destroy it entirely.Since that time, it has been quite open in its efforts.Hanse wonders how a single starship could be worth the Alliance's attention.As Harmonious Repose was the site of the latest turn of events, we are in a position to give some explanation.The ship in question, the Out of Band II, is clearly designed for operations at the Bottom of the Beyond  and is even capable of limited operations within the Slow Zone.The ship presented itself as a special zonographic flight commissioned to study the recent turbulence at the Bottom.In fact, this ship's mission is a very different one.In the aftermath of its violent departure, we have pieced together some extraordinary facts:  At least one of the ship's crew was human.Though they made great efforts to stay out of view and used Skroderider traders as intermediaries, we have recordings.A biosequence of one individual was obtained, and it matches the patterns maintained by two out of three of the Homo sapiens archives.(It's well known that the third archive, on Sneerot Down, is in the control of Human sympathizers. )Some might say this deception was founded in fear.After all, these events happened after the destruction of Sjandra Kei.We think otherwise: The ship's initial contact with us occurred before the Sjandra Kei incident.We have since made a careful analysis of the repair work our yards performed on this vessel.Ultradrive automation is a deep and complex thing; even the cleverest of cloaking cannot mask all the memories in it.We now know that the Out of Band II was from the Relay system and that it left there after the Perversion's attack.Think what this means.The crew of the Out of Band II brought weapons into a habitat, kill several local sophonts, and escaped before our musicians [harmonizers?police?]were properly notified.We have good reason to wish them ill.Yet our misfortune is a small thing compared to the unmasking of this secret mission.We are very grateful that the Alliance is willing to risk so much in following this lead.There's more than the usual number of unsubstantiated assertions floating around on this news thread.We hope our facts will wake some people up.In particular, consider what "Hanse" may really be.The Perversion is very visible in the High Beyond, where it has great power and can speak with its own voice.Down here, it is more likely that deception and covert propaganda will be its tools.Think on this when you read postings from unidentified entities such as "Hanse"!Ravna gritted her teeth.The hell of it was, the facts in the posting were correct.It was the inferences that were vicious and false.And she couldn't guess if this were some shade of black propaganda or simply Saint Rihndell expressing honest conclusions (though Rihndell had never seemed so trusting of the butterflies).One thing all the News seemed to agree on: Much more than the Alliance fleet was chasing the OOB.The swarm of ultradrive traces could be seen by anyone within a thousand light years.The best guess was that three fleets pursued the OOB.Three!The Alliance for the Defense, still loud and boastful, even though suspected (by some) of being opportunistic genocides.Behind them, Sjandra Kei and what was left of Ravna's motherland; in all the universe perhaps the only folk she could trust.And just behind them, the silent fleet.Diverse news posters claimed it was from the High Beyond.That fleet might have problems at the Bottom, but for now it was gaining.Few doubted that it was the Perversion's child.More than anything, it convinced the universe that the OOB or its destination was cosmically important.Just why it was important was the big question.Speculation was drifting in at the rate of five thousand messages per hour.A million different viewpoints were considering the mystery.Some of those viewpoints were so alien that they made Skroderiders and Humans look like the same species.At least five participants on this News thread were gaseous inhabitants of stellar coronas.There were one or two others that Ravna suspected were uncataloged races, beings so shy that this might be their first active use of the Net ever.The OOB's computer was a lot dumber than it had been in the Middle Beyond.She couldn't ask it to sift through the messages looking for nuance and insight.In fact, if an incoming message didn't have a Triskweline text, it was often unreadable.The ship's translator programs still worked fairly well with the major trade languages, but even there the translation was slow and full of alternative meanings and jabberwocky.It was just another sign that they were approaching the Bottom of the Beyond.Effective translation of natural languages comes awfully close to requiring a sentient translator program.Nevertheless, with proper design, things might have been better.The automation might have degraded gracefully under the restrictions imposed by their depth.Instead, gear just stopped working; what remained was slow and error prone.If only the refitting had been completed before the Fall of Relay.And just how many times have I wished for that?She hoped things were as bad aboard the pursuing ships.So Ravna used the ship to do light culling on the Threats newsgroup.Much of what was left

Fall of Sjandra Kei  Key phrases: On becoming Transcendent   Text of message:  Contrary to other postings, there are a number of reasons why a Power might install artifacts at the Bottom of the Beyond.The Abselor's message on this thread cites some: some Powers have documented curiosity about the Slow Zone and, even more, about the Unthinking Depths.In rare cases, expeditions have been dispatched (though any return from the Depths would occur long after the dispatching Power lost interest in all local questions).However, none of these motives are likely here.To those who are familiar with Fast Burn transcendence, it is clear that the Blight is a creature seeking stasis.Its interest in the Bottom is very sudden, provoked, we think, by the revelations at Harmonious Repose.There is something at the Bottom that is critical to the Perversion's welfare.Consider the notion of ablative dissonance (see the Where Are They Now group archive): No one knows what set up procedures the humans of Straumli Realm were using.The Fast Burn may itself have had Transcendent intelligence.What if it became dissatisfied with the direction of the channedring?In that case it might try to hide the jumpoff birthinghel.The Bottom would not be a place where the algorithm itself could normally execute, but avatars might still be created from it and briefly run.Up to a point, Ravna could almost make sense of it; ablative dissonance was a commonplace of Applied Theology.But then, like one of those dreams where the secret of life is about to be revealed, the posting just

of Sjandra Kei  Text of message:  In case you don't know, Sandor Intelligence has a number of different Net feeds.We can collect messages on paths that have no intermediate nodes in common.Thus we can be fairly confident that news we receive has not been tampered with en route.(There remain the lies and misunderstandings that were present to begin with, but that's something that makes the intelligence business interesting. )The Blight has been our top priority since its instantiation a year ago.This is not just because of the Blight's obvious strength, the destruction and the deicides it has committed.We fear that all this is the lesser part of the Threat.There have been perversions almost as powerful in the recorded past.What truly distinguishes this one is its stability.We see no evidence of internal evolution; in some ways it is less than a Power.It may never lose interest in controlling the High Beyond.We may be witnessing a massive and permanent change in the nature of things.Imagine: a stable necrosis, where the only sentience in the High Beyond is the Blight.Thus, studying the Blight has been a matter of life and death for us (even though we are powerful and widely distributed).We've reached a number of conclusions.Some of these may be obvious to you, others may sound like flagrant speculation.All take on a new coloring with the events reported from Harmonious Repose:  Almost from the beginning, the Blight has been searching for something.This search has extended far beyond its aggressive physical expansion.Its automatic agents have tried to penetrate virtually every node in the Top of the Beyond; the High Network is in shambles, reduced to protocols scarcely more efficient than those known below.At the same time, the Blight has physically stolen several archives.We have evidence of very large fleets searching for off Net archives at the Top and in the Low Transcend.At least three Powers have been murdered in this rampage.And now, suddenly, this assault has ended.The Blight's physical expansion continues, with no end in sight, but it no longer searches the High Beyond.As near as we can tell, the change occurred about two thousand seconds before the escape of the human vessel from Harmonious Repose.Less than six hours later, we saw the beginnings of the silent fleet that so many are now speculating about.That fleet is indeed the creature of the Blight.In other times, the destruction of Sjandra Kei and the motives of the Alliance for the Defense would all be important issues (and our organization might have interest in doing business with those affected).But all that is dwarfed by the fact of this fleet and the ship it pursues.And we disagree with the analysis [implication?]from Harmonious Repose: it is obvious to us that the Blight did not know of the Out of Band II until its discovery at Harmonious Repose.That ship is not a tool of the Blight, but it contains or is bound for something of enormous importance to the Blight.And what might that be?Here we begin frank speculation.And since we are speculating, we'll use those powerful pseudo laws, the Principles of Mediocrity and Minimal Assumption.If the Blight has the potential for taking over all the Top in a permanent stability, then why has this not happened before?Our guess is that the Blight has been instantiated before (with such dire consequence that the event marks the beginning of recorded time), but it has its own peculiar natural enemy.The order of events even suggests a particular scenario, one familiar from network security.Once upon a time (very long ago), there was another instance of the Blight.A successful defense was mounted, and all known copies of the Blight's recipe were destroyed.Of course, on a wide net, one can never be sure that all copies of a badness are gone.No doubt, the defense was distributed in enormous numbers.But even if a harboring archive were reached by such a distribution, there might be no effect if the Blight were not currently active there.The luckless humans of Straumli Realm chanced on such an archive, no doubt a ruin long off the Net.They instantiated the Blight and incidentally  perhaps a little later  the defense program.Somehow that Blight's enemy escaped destruction.And the Blight has been searching for it ever since  in all the wrong places.In its weakness, the new instance of the defense retreated to depths no Power would think of penetrating, whence it could never return without outside help.Speculation on top of speculation: we can't guess the nature of this defense, except that its retreat is a discouraging sign.And now even that sacrifice has gone for naught, since the Blight has seen through the deception.The Blight's fleet is clearly an ad hoc thing, hastily thrown together from forces that happened to be closest to the discovery.Without such haste, the quarry might have been lost to it.Thus the chase equipment is probably ill suited to the depths, and its performance will degrade as the descent progresses.However, we estimate that it will remain stronger than any force that can reach the scene in the near future.We may learn more after the Blight reaches the Out of Band II's destination.If it destroys that destination immediately, we'll know that something truly dangerous to the Blight existed there (and may exist elsewhere, at least in recipe form).If it does not, then perhaps the Blight was looking for something that will make it even more dangerous than before.Ravna sat back, stared at the display for some time.Sandor Arbitration Intelligence was one of the sharpest posters in this newsgroup But now even their predictions were just different flavors of doom.And all so damn cool they were, so analytical.She knew that Sandor was polyspecific, with branch offices scattered through the High Beyond.But they were no Power.If the Perversion could knock over Relay and kill Old One, then all of Sandor's resources wouldn't help it if the enemy decided to gobble them up.Their analysis had the tone of the pilot of a crashing ship, intent on understanding the danger, not taking time out for terror.Oh Pham, how I wish I could talk to you like before!She curled gently in on herself, the way you can in zero gee.The sobs came softly, but without hope.They had not exchanged a hundred words in the last five days.They lived as if with guns at each others' heads.And that was the literal truth  she had made it so.When she and he and the Skroderiders had been together, at least the danger had been a shared burden.Now they were split apart and their enemies were slowly gaining on them.What good could Pham's godshatter be against a thousand enemy ships and the Blight behind them?She floated for a timeless while, the sobs fading into despairing silence.And again she wondered if what she'd done could possibly be right.She had threatened Pham's life to protect Blueshell and Greenstalk and their kind.In doing so, she had kept secret what might be the greatest treachery in the history of the Known Net.Can one person make such a decision?Pham had asked her that, and she had answered yes but  The question toyed with her every day.And every day she tried to see some way out.She wiped her face silently.She didn't doubt what Pham had discovered.There were some smug posters on the Net who argued that something as vast as the Blight was simply a tragic disaster, and not an evil.Evil, they argued, could only have meaning on smaller scales, in the hurt that one sophont does to another.Before RIP, the argument had seemed a frivolous playing with words.Now she saw that it was meaningful  and dead wrong.The Blight had created the Riders, a marvelous and peaceful race.Their presence on a billion worlds had been a good.And behind it all was the potential for converting the sovereign minds of friends into monsters.When she thought of Blueshell and Greenstalk, and the fear welled up and she knew the poison that was there  even though they were good people  then she knew she'd glimpsed evil on the Transcendent scale.She had gotten Blueshell and Greenstalk into this mission; they had not asked for it.They were friends and allies, and she would not harm them because of what they could become.Maybe it was the latest news items.Maybe it was confronting the same impossibilities for the n'th time: Ravna gradually straightened, looking at those last messages.So.She believed Pham about the Skroderider threat.She also believed these two were only enemies in potential.She had thrown away everything to save them and their kind.Maybe it was a mistake, but take what advantage there is in it.If they are to be saved because you think they are allies, then treat them as allies.Treat them as the friends they are.We are all pawns together.Ravna pushed gently toward her cabin's doorway.The Skroderiders' cabin was just behind the command deck.Since the debacle at RIP, the two had not left it.As she drifted down the passage toward their door, Ravna half expected to see Pham's handiwork lurking in the shadows.She knew he was doing his best to "protect himself".Yet there was nothing unusual.What will he think of my visiting them?She announced herself.After a moment Blueshell appeared.His skrode was wiped clean of cosmetic stripes, and the room behind him was a jumble.He waved her in with quick jerks of his fronds."My lady. ""Blueshell," she nodded at him.Half the time she cursed herself for trusting the Riders; the other half, she was mortally embarrassed for having left them alone."H how is Greenstalk?"Surprisingly, Blueshell's fronds snapped together in a smile."You guessed?This is the first day with her new skrode I will show you, if you'd like. "He threaded around equipment that was scattered in a lattice across the room.It was similar to the shop equipment Pham had used to build his powered armor.And if Pham had seen it, he might have lost all self control."I've worked on it every minute since Pham locked us in here. "Greenstalk was in the other room.Her stalk and fronds rose from a silver pot.There were no wheels.It looked nothing like a traditional skrode.Blueshell rolled across the ceiling and extended a frond down to his mate.He rustled something at her, and after a moment, she replied."The skrodeling is very limited, no mobility, no redundant power supplies.I copied it off a Lesser Skroderider design, a simple thing designed by Dirokimes.It's not meant for more than sitting in one place, facing in one direction.But it provides her with short term memory support, and attention focusers She is back with me. "He fussed around her, some fronds caressing hers, others pointing to the gadget he had built for her."She herself was not badly injured.Sometimes I wonder  whatever Pham says, maybe at the last second he could not kill her. "He spoke nervously, as though afraid of what Ravna might say."The first few days I was very worried.But the surgeon is good.It gave her plenty of time to stand in strong surf.To think slowly.Since I've added on this skrodeling, she has practiced the calisthenics of memory, repeating what the surgeon or I say to her.With the skrodeling, she can hold on to a new memory for almost five hundred seconds.That's usually long enough for her natural mind to commit a thought to long term memory. "Ravna drifted close.There were some new creases in Greenstalk's fronds.Those would be scars healing.Her visual surfaces followed Ravna's approach.The Rider knew she was here; her whole posture was friendly."Can she talk Trisk, Blueshell?Do you have a voder hooked up?""What?"Buzz.He was forgetful or nervous, Ravna couldn't tell which."Yes, yes.Just give me a minute There was no need before.No one wanted to talk to us. "He fiddled with something on the home made skrode.After a moment, "Hello, Ravna.I recognize you. "Her fronds rustled in time with the words."I know you, too.We, I am glad that you are back. "The voder voice was faint, wistful?"Yes.It's hard for me to tell.I do want to talk, but I'm not sure am I'm making sense?"Out of Greenstalk's sight, Blueshell flicked a long tendril, a gesture: say yes."Yes, I understand you, Greenstalk. "And Ravna resolved never again to get angry with Greenstalk about not remembering."Good. "Her fronds straightened and she didn't say anything more."See?"came Blueshell's voder voice."I am brightly cheerful.Even now, Greenstalk is committing this conversation to long term memory.It goes slowly for now, but I am improving the skrodeling.I'm sure her slowness is mainly emotional shock. "He continued to brush at Greenstalk's fronds, but she didn't say anything more.Ravna wondered just how brightly cheerful he could be.Behind the Riders were a set of display windows, customized now for the Rider outlook."You've been following the News?"Ravna asked."Yes, indeed. ""I I feel so helpless. "I feel so foolish, saying that to you.But Blueshell didn't take offense.He seemed grateful for the change of topic, preferring the gloom at a distance."Yes.We certainly are famous now.Three fleets chasing us down, my lady.Ha ha. ""They don't seem to be gaining very fast. "Frond shrug."Sir Pham has turned out to be a competent ship's master.I'm afraid things will change as we descend.The ship's higher automation will gradually fail.What you call 'manual control' will become very important.OOB was designed for my race, my lady.No matter what Sir Pham thinks of us, at bottom we can fly it better than any.So bit by bit the others will gain  at least those who truly understand their own ships. "It was something she hadn't guessed, certainly something she would never have found reading the Net.Too bad it's also bad news."S surely Pham must know this?""I think he must.But he is trapped in his own fears.What can he do?If not for you, My Lady Ravna, he might have killed us already.Maybe when the choice comes down to dying in the next hour against trusting us, maybe then there will be a chance. ""By then it will be too late.Look, even if he doesn't trust  even though he believes the worst of Riders  there must still be a way. "And it came to her that sometimes you don't have to change the way people think, or even whom they may hate."Pham wants to get to the Bottom, to recover this Countermeasure.He thinks you may be from the Blight, and after the same thing.But up to a point  " up to a point he can cooperate, postpone the showdown he imagines till perhaps it won't matter.Even as she started to say it, Blueshell was already shouting back at her."I'm am not of the Blight!Greenstalk is not!The Rider race is not!"He swept around his mate, rolled across the ceiling till his fronds rattled right before Ravna's face."I'm sorry.It's just the potential  "  "Nonsense!"His voder buzzed off scale."We ran in to an evil few.Every race has such, people who will kill for trade.They forced Greenstalk, substituted data at her voder.Pham Nuwen would kill our billions for the sake of this fantasy. "He waved, inarticulate.Something she had never seen in a Skroderider: his fronds actually changed tone, darkened.The motion ceased, yet he said nothing more.And then Ravna heard it, a keening that might have come from a voder.The sound was steadily growing, a howl that made all Blueshell's sound effects friendly nonsense.It was Greenstalk.The scream reached a threshold just below pain, then broke into choppy Triskweline: "It's true!Oh, by all our trading, Blueshell, it's true" and staticky noise came from her voder.Her fronds started shaking, random turning that must be like a human's eyes wildly staring, like a human's mouth mumbling hysteria.Blueshell was already back by the wall, reaching to adjust her new skrode.Greenstalk's fronds brushed him away, and her voder voice continued, "I was horror struck, Blueshell.I was horror struck, struck by horror.And it would not stop" the voice rattled quiet for just an instant, and this time Blueshell made no move."I remember everything up till the last five minutes.And everything Pham says is true, dear love.Loyal as you are, and I have seen that loyalty now for two hundred years, you would be turned in an instant just as I was. "Now that the dam broke, her words came quickly, mostly making sense.The horrors she could remember were graven deep, and she was finally coming out of ghastly shock."I was right behind you, remember, Blueshell?You were deep in your trading with the tusk legs, so deep you did not really see.I noticed the other Riders coming toward us.No matter: a friendly meeting, so far from home.Then one touched my Skrode.I  " Greenstalk hesitated.Her fronds rattled and she began again, "horror struck, horror struck"  After a moment: "It was like suddenly new memories in the skrode, Blueshell.New memories, new attitudes.But thousands of years deep.And not mine.Instantly, instantly.I never even lost consciousness.I thought just as clearly, I remembered all I had before. ""And when you resisted?"Ravna said softly.   "Resisted?My Lady Ravna, I did not resist.I was theirs No.Not theirs, for they were owned, too.We were things, our intelligence in service to another's goal.Dead, and alive to see our death.I would kill you, I would kill Pham, I would kill Blueshell.You know I tried.And when I did, I wanted to succeed.You could not imagine, Ravna.You humans speak of violation.You could never know" Long pause."That's not quite right.At the Top of the Beyond, within the Blight itself  perhaps there, everyone lives as I did. "The shuddering did not subside, but her gestures were no longer aimless.The fronds were saying something in her own language, and brushing gently against Blueshell."Our whole race, dear love.Just as Pham says it. "Blueshell wilted, and Ravna felt the sort of gut tearing she had when they learned of Sjandra Kei.That had been her worlds, her family, her life.Blueshell was hearing worse.Ravna pushed a little closer, near enough to run her hand up the side of Greenstalk's fronds."Pham says it's the greater skrodes that are the cause. "Sabotage hidden billions of years deep."Yes, it is mainly the skrodes.The 'great gift' we Riders love so It is a design for control, but I fear we were remade for it, too.When they touched my skrode, I was converted instantly.Instantly, everything I cared for was meaningless.We are like smart bombs, scattered by the trillions through space that everyone thinks is safe.We will be used sparingly.We are the Blight's hidden weapon, especially in the Low Beyond. "Blueshell twitched, and his voice came out jerkily: "And everything Pham claims is correct. ""No, Blueshell, not everything. "Ravna remembered that last chilling standoff with Pham Nuwen."He has the facts, but he weighs them wrong.As long as your skrodes are not perverted, you are the same folk that I trusted to fly me to the Bottom. "Blueshell angled his look away from her, an angry shrug.Greenstalk's voice came instead."As long as the skrode has not been perverted But look how easy it was done, how sudden I became the Blight's. ""Yes, but could it happen except by direct touch?Could you be 'changed' by reading the Net News?"She meant the question as ghastly sarcasm, but poor Greenstalk took it seriously:  "Not by a News item, nor by standard protocol messages.But accepting a transmission targeted on skrode utilities might do it. ""Then we are safe here.You, because you no longer ride a greater skrode, Blueshell because  "  "Because I was never touched  but how can you know that?"His anger was still there deep within shame, but now it was a hopeless anger, directed at something very far away."No, dear love, you have not been touched.I would know. ""Yes, but why should Ravna believe you?"Everything could be a lie, thought Ravna, but I believe Greenstalk.I believe we four are the only ones in all the Beyond who can hurt the Blight.If only Pham could see it.And that brought her back to: "You say we will start losing our lead?"Blueshell waved an affirmative."As soon as we are a little lower.They should have us in a matter of weeks. "And then it won't matter who was perverted and who was not."I think we should have a little chat with Pham Nuwen. "Godshatter and all.Beforehand Ravna couldn't imagine how the confrontation would turn out.Just possibly  if he'd lost all touch with reality  Pham might try to kill them when they appeared on the command deck.More likely there would be rage and argument and threats, and they would be back to square one.Instead it was almost like the old Pham, from before Harmonious Repose.He let them enter the command deck, he made no comment when Ravna set herself carefully between himself and the Riders.He listened without interruption, while Ravna explained what Greenstalk had said."These two are safe, Pham.And without their help we'll not make it to the Bottom. "He nodded, looked away at the windows.Some showed natural starscape; most were ultratrace displays, the closest thing to a picture of the enemies that were closing on the OOB.His calm expression broke for just an instant, and the Pham that loved her seemed to stare out, desperate: "And you really believe all this, Rav?How?"Then the lid was back on, his expression distant and neutral."Never mind.Certainly it's true: without all of us working together we'll never make it to Tines' World.Blueshell, I accept your offer.Subject to cautious safeguards, we work together. "Till I can safely dispose of you, Ravna could feel the unsaid words behind his blandness.Showdown deferred.They were less than eight weeks from Tines' World, both Pham and Blueshell said.If the Zone conditions remained stable.If they were not overtaken in the meantime.Less than two months, after the six already voyaged.But the days were not like before.Every one was a challenge, a standoff sometimes cloaked in civility, sometimes flaring into threats of sudden death  as when Pham retrieved Blueshell's shop equipment.Pham was living on the command deck now; when he left it, the hatch was locked on his ID.He had destroyed, or thought he had destroyed, all other privileged links to the ship's automation.He and Blueshell were in almost constant collaboration but not like before.Every step was slow, Blueshell explaining everything, allowed to demonstrate nothing.That's where the arguments came closest to deadly force, when Pham must give in to one peril or the other.For every day the pursuing fleets were a little bit closer: two bands of killers, and what was left of Sjandra Kei.Evidently some of the SjK Commercial Security fleet could still fight, wanted revenge on the Alliance.Once Ravna suggested to Pham that they contact Commercial Security, try to persuade them to attack the Blighter fleet.Pham had given her a blank look."Not yet, maybe not ever," he said, and turned away.In a way his answer was a relief: Such a battle would be a suicidal long shot.Ravna didn't want the last of her kinsfolk dying for her.So the OOB might arrive at Tines' World before the enemy, but with what little time to spare!Some days Ravna withdrew in tears and despair.What brought her back was Jefri and Greenstalk.They both needed her, and for a few weeks more she could still help.Mr.Steel's defense plans were proceeding.The Tines were even having some success with their wideband radio.Steel reported that Woodcarver's main force was on its way north; there was more than one race against time.She spent many hours with the OOB's library, devising more gifts for the Jefri's friends.Some things  like telescopes  were easy, but others It wasn't wasted effort.Even if the Blight won, its fleet might ignore the natives, might settle for killing the OOB and winning back the Countermeasure.Greenstalk was slowly improving.At first Ravna was afraid the improvement might be in her own imagination.Ravna was spending a good part of each day sitting with the Rider, trying to see progress in her responses.Greenstalk was very "far away", almost like a human with stroke damage and prosthesis.In fact, she seemed regressed from the articulate horror of her first conversations.Maybe her recent progress was just a mirror to Ravna's sensitivity, to the fact that Ravna was with her so much.Blueshell insisted there was progress, but with that stubborn inflexibility of his.Two weeks, three  and there was no doubt: something was healing at the boundary between Rider and skrodeling.Greenstalk consistently made sense, consistently committed important rememberings Now as often as not it was she helping Ravna.Greenstalk saw things that Ravna had missed: "Sir Pham isn't the only one who is afraid of us Skroderiders.Blueshell is frightened too, and it is tearing him apart.He can't admit it even to me, but he thinks it's possible that we're infected independently of our skrodes.He desperately wants to convince Pham that this is not true  and so to convince himself. "She was silent for a long moment, one frond brushing against Ravna's arm.Sea sounds surrounded them in the cabin, but ship's automation could no longer produce surging water."Sigh.We must pretend the surf, dear Ravna.Somewhere it will always be, no matter what happened at Sjandra Kei, no matter what happens here. "Blueshell was hearty gentleness around his mate, but alone with Ravna his rage showed through: "No, no, I don't object to Sir Pham's navigation, at least not now.Perhaps we could be a little further ahead with me directly at the helm, but the fastest ships behind us would still be closing.It's the other things, my lady.You know how untrustworthy our automation is down here.Pham is hurting it further.He's written his own security overrides.He's turning the ship's environment automation into a system of boobytraps. "Ravna had seen evidence of this.The areas around OOB's command deck and ship's workshop looked like military checkpoints."You know his fears.If this makes him feel safer  "  "That's not the point, My Lady.I would do anything to persuade him to accept my help.But what he's doing is deadly dangerous.Our Bottom automation is not reliable, and he's making it actively worse.If we get some sudden stress, the environment programs will likely have a bizarre crash  atmosphere dump, thermal runaway, anything. ""I  "  "Doesn't he understand?Pham controls nothing. "His voder broke into a nonlinear squawk."He has the ability to destroy, but that is all.He needs my help.He was my friend.Doesn't he understand?"Pham understood oh, Pham understood.He and Ravna still talked.Their arguments were the hardest thing in her life.And sometimes they didn't exactly argue; sometimes it was almost like rational discussion:  "I haven't been taken over, Ravna.Not like the Blight takes over Riders, anyway.I still have charge of my soul. "He turned away from the console and flashed a wan smile in her direction, acknowledging the flaw in such self conviction.And from things like that smile, Ravna was convinced that Pham Nuwen still lived, and sometimes spoke."What about the godshatter state?I see you for hours, just staring at the tracking display, or mucking around in the library and the News," scanning faster than any human could consciously read.Pham shrugged."It's studying the ships that are chasing us, trying to figure out just what belongs to whom, just what capabilities each might have.I don't know the details.Self awareness is on vacation then," when all Pham's mind was turned into a processor for whatever programs Old One had downloaded.A few hours of fugue state might yield an instant of Power grade thought  and even that he didn't consciously remember."But I know this.Whatever the godshatter is, it's a very narrow thing.It's not alive; in some ways it may not even be very smart.For everyday matters like ship piloting, there's just good old Pham Nuwen. "" there's the rest of us, Pham.Blueshell would like to help," Ravna spoke softly.This was the place where Pham would close into icy silence  or blow up in rage.This day, he just cocked his head."Ravna, Ravna.I know I need him And, and I'm glad I need him.That I don't have to kill him. "Yet.Pham's lips quivered for a second, and she thought he might start crying."The godshatter can't know Blueshell  "  "Not the godshatter.It's not making me act this way  I'm doing what any person should do when the stakes are this high. "The words were spoken without anger.Maybe there was a chance.Maybe she could reason:  "Blueshell and Greenstalk are loyal, Pham.Except at Harmonious Repose  "  Pham sighed, "Yeah.I've thought about that a lot.They came to Relay from Straumli Realm.They got Vrinimi looking for the refugee ship.That smells of setup, but probably unknowing  maybe even a setup by something opposing the Blight.In any case they were innocent then, else the Blight would have known about Tines world right from the beginning.The Blight knew nothing till RIP, till Greenstalk was converted.And I know Blueshell was loyal even then.He knew things about my armor  the remotes, for instance  that he could have warned the others about. "Hope came as a surprise to Ravna.He really had thought things out, and  "It's just the skrodes, Pham.They're traps waiting to be sprung.But we're isolated here, and you destroyed the one that Greenstalk  "  Pham was shaking his head."It's more than the skrodes.The Blight had its hand in Rider design, too, at least to some degree.I can't imagine the takeover of Greenstalk's being so smooth otherwise. ""Y yes.A risk.A very small risk compared to  "  Pham didn't move, but something in him seemed to draw away from her, denying the support she could offer."A small risk?We don't know.The stakes are so high.I'm walking a tightrope.If I don't use Blueshell now, we'll be shot out of space by the Blighter fleet.If I let him do too much, if I trust him, then he or some part of him could betray us.All I have is the godshatter, and a bunch of memories that that may be the biggest fakes of all. "These last words were nearly inaudible.He looked up at her, a look that was both cold and terribly lost."But I'm going to use what I have, Rav, and whatever it is I am.Somehow I'm going to get us to Tines' World.Somehow I'm going to get Old One's godshatter to whatever is there. "It was another three weeks before Blueshell's predictions came true.The OOB had seemed a sturdy beast up in the Middle Beyond; even its damaged ultradrive had failed gracefully.Now the ship was leaking bugs in all directions.Much of it had nothing to do with Pham's meddling.Without those final consistency checks, none of the OOB's Bottom automation was really trustworthy.But its failures were compounded by Pham's desperate security hacks.The ship's library had source code for generic Bottom automation.Pham spent several days revising it for the OOB.All four of them were on the command deck during the installation, Blueshell trying to help, Pham suspiciously examining every suggestion.Thirty minutes into the installation, there were muffled banging noises down the main corridor.Ravna might have ignored them, except that she'd never heard the like aboard the OOB.Pham and the Riders reacted with near panic; spacers don't like unexplained bumps in the night.Blueshell raced to the hatch, floated fronds first through the hole."I see nothing, Sir Pham. "Pham was paging quickly through the diagnostic displays, mixed format things partly from the new setup."I've got some warning lights here, but  "  Greenstalk started to say something, but Blueshell was back and talking fast: "I don't believe it.Anything like this should make pictures, a detailed report.Something is terribly wrong. "Pham stared at him a second, then returned to his diagnostics.Five seconds passed."You're right.Status is just looping through stale reports. "He began grabbing views from cameras all over the OOB's interior.Barely half of them reported, but what they showed  The ship's water reservoir was a foggy, icy cavern.That was the banging sound  tonnes of water, spaced.A dozen other support services had gone bizarre, and   the armed checkpoint outside the workshop had slagged down.The beamers were firing continuously on low power.And for all the destruction, the diagnostics still showed green or amber or no report.Pham got a camera in the workshop itself.The place was on fire.Pham jumped up from his saddle and bounced off the ceiling.For an instant she thought he might go racing off the bridge.Then he tied himself down and grimly began trying to put out the fire.For the next few minutes, the bridge was almost quiet, just Pham quietly swearing as none of the obvious things worked."Interlocking failures," he mumbled the phrase a couple of times."The firesnuff automation is down I can't dump atmosphere from the shop.My beamers have melted everything shut. "Ship fire.Ravna had seen pictures of such disasters, but they had always seemed an improbable thing.In the midst of universal vacuum, how could a fire survive?And in zero gee, surely a fire would choke itself even if the crew couldn't dump atmosphere.The workshop camera had a hazy view on the real thing: True, the flames ate the oxygen around them.There were sheets of construction foam that were only lightly scorched, protected for the moment by dead air.But the fire spread out, moving steadily into still fresh air.In places, heat driven turbulence enriched the mix, and previously burned areas blazed up."It's still got ventilation, Sir Pham. ""I know.I can't shut it.The vents must be melted open. ""It's as likely software. "Blueshell was silent for a second."Try this  " the directions were meaningless to Ravna, some low level workaround.But Pham nodded, and his fingers danced across the console.In the workshop, the surface hugging flames crept farther across the construction foam.Now they licked at the innards of the armor Pham had spent so much time on.This latest revision was only half finished.Ravna remembered he was working on reactive armor now There would be oxidizers there."Pham, is the armor sealed  "  The fire was sixty meters aft and behind a dozen bulkheads.The explosion came as a distant thump, almost innocent.But in the camera view, the armor dismembered itself, and the fire blazed triumphant.Seconds later, Pham got Blueshell's suggestion working, and the workshop's vents closed.The fire in the wrecked armor continued for another half hour, but did not spread beyond the shop.It took two days to clean up, to estimate the damage, and have some confidence that no new disaster was on the way.Most of the workshop was destroyed.They would have no armor on Tines world.Pham salvaged one of the beamers that had been guarding the entrance to the shop.Disaster was scattered all across the ship, the classic random ruin of interlocking failures: They had lost fifty percent of their water.The ship's landing boat had lost its higher automation.OOB's rocket drive was massively degraded.That was unimportant here in interstellar space, but their final velocity matching would be done at only 0.4 gees.Thank goodness the agrav worked; they would have no trouble maneuvering in steep gravitational wells  that is, landing on Tines world.Ravna knew how close they were to losing the ship, but she watched Pham with even greater dread.She was so afraid that he would take this as final evidence of Rider treachery, that this would drive him over the edge.Strangely, almost the opposite happened.His pain and devastation were obvious, but he didn't lash out, just doggedly went about gathering up the pieces.He was talking to Blueshell more now, not letting him modify the automation, but cautiously accepting more of his advice.Together they restored the ship to something like its pre fire state.She asked Pham about it."No change of heart," he finally said."I had to balance the risks, and I messed up And maybe there is no balance.Maybe the Blight will win. "The godshatter had bet too much on Pham's doing it all himself.Now it was turning down the paranoia a little.Seven weeks out from Harmonious Repose, less than one week from whatever waited at Tines' world, Pham went into a multiday fugue.Before he had been busy, a futile attempt to run handmade checks on all the automation they might need at Tines' World.Now  Ravna couldn't even get him to eat:  The nav display showed the three fleets as identified by the News and Pham's intuition: the Blight's agents, the Alliance for the Defense, and what was left of Sjandra Kei Commercial Security.Deadly monsters and the remains of a victim.The Alliance still proclaimed itself with regular bulletins on the News.SjK Commercial Security had posted a few terse refutations, but was mostly silent; they were unused to propaganda, or  as likely  uninterested in it.A private revenge was all that remained to Commercial Security.And the Blighter fleet?The News hadn't heard anything from them.Piecing together departures and lost ships, War Trackers Newsgroup concluded they were a wildly ad hoc assembly, whatever the Blight had controlled down here at the time of the RIP debacle.Ravna knew that the War Trackers analysis was wrong about one thing: The Blighter fleet was not silent.Thirty times over the last weeks, they had sent messages at the OOB   in skrode maintenance format.Pham had had the ship reject the messages unread  and then worried about whether the order was really followed.After all, the OOB was of Rider design.But now the torment in him was submerged.Pham sat for hours, staring at the display.Soon Sjandra Kei would close with the Alliance fleet.At least one set of villains would pay.But the Blighter fleet and at least part of the Alliance would survive Maybe this fugue was just godshatter getting desperate.Three days passed; Pham snapped out of it.Except for the new thinness in his face, he seemed more normal than he had in weeks.He asked Ravna to bring the Riders up to the bridge.Pham waved at the ultradrive traces that floated in the window.The three fleets were spread through a rough cylinder, five light years deep and three across.The display captured only the heart of that volume, where the fastest of the pursuers had clustered.The current position of each ship was a fleck of light trailing an unending stream of fainter lights  the ultradrive trace left by that vehicle's drive."I've used red, blue, and green to mark my best guess as to the fleet affiliation of each trace. "The fastest ships were collected in a blob so dense that it looked white at this scale, but with colored streamers diverging behind.There were other tags, annotations he had set but which he admitted once to Ravna he didn't understand."The front edge of that mob  the fastest of the fast  is still gaining. "Blueshell said hesitantly."We might get a little more speed if you would grant me direct control.Not much, but  "  Pham's response was civil at least."No, I'm thinking of something else, something Ravna suggested a while back.It's always been a possibility and I think the time may have come for it. "Ravna moved closer to the display, stared at the green traces.Their distribution was in near agreement with what the News claimed to be the remnants of Sjandra Kei Commercial Security.All that's left of my people."They've been trying to engage with the Alliance for a hundred hours now. "Pham's glance touched hers."Yeah," he said softly."Poor bastards.They're literally the fleet from Port Despair.If I were them, I'd  " His expression smoothed over again."Any idea how well armed they are?"That was surely a rhetorical question, but it put the topic on the table."War Trackers thinks that Sjandra Kei had been expecting something unpleasant ever since the Alliance started talking 'death to vermin'.Commercial Security was providing deep space defense.Their fleet is converted freighters armed with locally designed weapons.War Trackers claims they weren't really a match for what the other side could field, if the Alliance was willing to take some heavy casualties.Trouble is, Sjandra Kei never expected the planet smasher attack.So when the Alliance fleet showed up, ours moved out to meet it  "  " and meantime the KE bombs were coming straight in to the heart spaces of Sjandra Kei. "Into my heart spaces."Yes.The Alliance must have been running those bombs for weeks. "Pham Nuwen laughed shortly."If I were shipping with the Alliance fleet, I'd be a bit nervous now.They're down in numbers, and those retread freighters seem about as fast as anything here I'll bet every pilot out of Sjandra Kei is dead set on revenge. "The emotion faded."Hmm.There's no way they could kill all the Alliance ships or all the Blight's, much less all of both.It would be pointless to  His gaze abruptly focused on her."So if we leave things as they are, the Sjandra Kei fleet will eventually match position with the Alliance and try to blow them out of existence. "Ravna just nodded."In twelve hours or so, they say. ""And then all that will be left is the Blight's own fleet on our tail.But if we could talk your people into fighting the right enemies"  It was Ravna's nightmare scheme.All that was left of Sjandra Kei dying to save the OOB trying to save them.There was little chance the Sjandra Kei fleet could destroy all the Blighter ships.But they're here to fight.Why not a vengeance that means something?That was the nightmare's message.Now somehow it fit godshatter's plans."There are problems.They don't know what we're doing or the purpose of the third fleet.Anything we shout back to them will be overheard. "Ultrawave was directional, but most of their pursuers were closely mingled.Pham nodded."Somehow we have to talk to them, and them alone.Somehow we have to persuade them to fight. "Faint smile."And I think we may have just the equipment to do all that.Blueshell: Remember that night on the High Docks.You told us about your 'rotted cargo' from Sjandra Kei?""Indeed, Sir Pham.We carried one third of a cipher generated by SjK Commercial Security for their long range communications.It's still in the ship's safe, though worthless without the other two thirds. "Gram for gram, crypto materials were about the most valuable thing shipped between the stars  and once compromised, about the most valueless.Somewhere in Out of Band's cargo files there was an SjK one time communications pad.Part of a pad."Worthless?Maybe not.Even one third would provide us with secure communications. "Blueshell dithered."I must not mislead you.No competent customer would accept such.Certainly, it provides secure communication, but the other side has no verification that you are who you claim. "Pham's glance slid sideways, toward Ravna.There was that smile again."If they'll listen, I think we can convince them The hard part is, I only want one of them to hear us. "Pham explained what he had in mind.The Riders' rustled faintly behind Pham's words.After all their time together, Ravna could almost get some sense of their talk  or maybe she just understood their personalities.As usual, Blueshell was worrying about how impossible the idea was, and Greenstalk was urging him to listen.But when Pham finished, the large rider did not launch into objections."Across seventy light years, ultrawave comm between ships is practical, even without our antenna swarm; we could even have live video.But you are right, the beam spread would include all the ships in the central cluster of fleets.If we could reliably identify an outlying vessel as belonging to Sjandra Kei, then what you are asking might be done; that ship could use internal fleet codes to relay to the others.But in honesty I must warn you," continued Blueshell, brushing back Greenstalk's gentle remonstrance, "professional communications folk would not honor your request for talk  would probably not even recognize it as such. ""Silly. "Greenstalk finally spoke, her voder voice gentle but clear."You always say things like that  except when we are talking to paying customers. ""Brap.Yes.Desperate times, desperate measures.I want to try it, but I fear I want there to be no accusations of Rider treachery, Sir Pham.I want you to handle this. "Pham Nuwen smiled back."My thought exactly. ""The Aniara Fleet. "That's what some of the crews of Commercial Security were calling themselves.Aniara was the ship of an old human myth, older than Nyjora, perhaps going back to the Tuvo Norsk cooperatives in the asteroids of Earth's solar system.In the story, Aniara was a large ship launched into interstellar depths just before the death of its parent civilization.The crew watched the death agonies of the home system, and then over the following years  as their ship fell out and out into the endless dark  died themselves, their life support systems slowly failing.The image was a haunting one, which was probably the reason it was known across millennia.With the destruction of Sjandra Kei and the escape of Commercial Security, the story seemed suddenly come true.But we will not play it to the end.Group Captain Kjet Svensndot stared into the tracking display.This time the death of civilization had been a murder, and the murderers were almost within vengeance's reach.For days, fleet HQ had been maneuvering them to close with the Alliance.The display showed that success was very, very near.The majority of Alliance and Sjandra Kei ships were bound in a glowing ball of drive traces  which also included the third, silent fleet.From that display you might think that battle was already possible.In fact, opposing ships were passing through almost the same space  sometimes less than a billion kilometers apart  but still separated by milliseconds of time.All the vessels were on ultradrive, jumping perhaps a dozen times a second.And even here at the Bottom of the Beyond, that came to a measurable fraction of a light year on each jump.To fight an uncooperative enemy meant matching their jumps perfectly and flooding the common space with weapon drones.Group Captain Svensndot changed the display to show ships that had exactly matched their pace with the Alliance.Almost a third of the fleet was in synch now.Another few hours and "Damnation!"He slapped his display board, sending it spinning across the deck.His first officer retrieved the display, sent it sailing back."Is this a new damnation, or the usual?"Tirolle asked."It was the usual.Sorry. "And he really was.Tirolle and Glimfrelle had their own problems.No doubt there were still pockets of humanity in the Beyond, hidden from the Alliance.But of the Dirokimes, there might be no more than what was on Commercial Security's fleet.Except for adventurous souls like Tirolle and Glimfrelle, all that was left of their kind had been in the dream terranes at Sjandra Kei.Kjet Svensndot had started with Commercial Security twenty five years before, back when the company had just been a small fleet of rentacops.He had spent thousands of hours learning to be the very best combat pilot in the organization.Only twice had he ever been in a shootout.Some might have regretted that.Svensndot and his superiors took it as the reward for being the best.His competence had won him the best fighting equipment in Commercial Security's fleet, culminating with the ship he commanded now.The Olvira was purchased with part of the enormous premium that Sjandra Kei paid out when the Alliance first started making threatening noises.Olvira was not a rebuilt freighter, but a fighting machine from the keel out.The ship was equipped with the smartest processors, the smartest ultra drive, that could operate at Sjandra Kei's altitude in the Beyond.It needed only a three person crew  and combat could be managed by the pilot alone with his AI associates.Its holds contained more than ten thousand seeker bombs, each smarter than the average freighter's entire drive unit.Quite a reward for twenty five years of solid performance.They even let Svensndot name his new ship.And now Well, the true Olvira was surely dead.Along with billions of others they had been hired to protect, she had been at Herte, in the inner system.Glow bombs leave no survivors.And his beautiful ship with the same name, it had been a half light year out system, seeking enemies that weren't there.In any honest battle, Kjet Svensndot and this Olvira could have done very well.Instead they were chasing down into the Bottom of the Beyond.Every light year took them further from the regions Olvira was built for.Every light year the processors worked a bit more slowly (or not at all).Down here the converted freighters were almost an optimum design.Clumsy and stupid, with crews of dozens, but they kept on working.Already Olvira was lagging five light years behind them.It was the freighters that would make the attack on the Alliance fleet.And once again Kjet would stand powerless while his friends died.For the hundredth time, Svensndot glared at the trace display and contemplated mutiny.There were Alliance stragglers too  "high performance" vehicles left behind the central pack.But his orders were to maintain position, to be a tactical coordinator for the fleet's swifter combatants.Well, he would do as he was hired this one last time.But when the battle was done, when the fleet was dead, with as many of the Alliance that they could take with them  then he would think of his own revenge.Some of that depended on Tirolle and Glimfrelle.Could he persuade them to leave the remnants of the Alliance fleet and ascend to the Middle Beyond, up where the Olvira was the best of her kind?There was good evidence now about which star systems were behind the "Alliance for the Defense".The murderers were boasting to the news.Apparently they thought that would bring them new support.It might also bring them visitors like Olvira.The bombs in her belly could destroy worlds, though not as swiftly sure as what had been used on Sjandra Kei.And even now Svensndot's mind shrank from that sort of revenge.No.They would choose their targets carefully: ships coming to form new Alliance fleets, underprotected convoys.Olvira might last a long time if he always struck from ambush and never left survivors.He stared and stared at the display, and ignored the wetness that floated at the corners of his eyes.All his life, he had lived by the law.Often his job had been to stop acts of revenge And now revenge was all that life had left for him."I'm getting something peculiar, Kjet. "Glimfrelle was monitoring signals this watch.It was the sort of thing that should have been totally automated  and had been in Olvira's natural environment, but which was now a boring and exhausting enterprise."What?More Net lies?"said Tirolle."No.This is on the bearing of that bottom lugger everyone is chasing.It can't be anyone else. "Svensndot's eyebrows rose.He turned on the mystery with enormous, scarcely realized, pleasure."Characteristics?""Ship's signal processor says it's probably a narrow beam.We are its only likely target.The signal is strong and the bandwidth is at least enough to support flat video.If our snarfling DSP was working right, I'd know  " 'Frelle sang a little song that was impatient humming among his kind.  "Iiae!It's encrypted, but at a high layer.This stuff is syntax 45 video.In fact, it claims to be using one third of a cipher the Company made a year back. "For an instant, Svensndot thought 'Frelle was claiming the message itself was smart; that should be absolutely impossible here at the Bottom.The second officer must have caught his look: "Just sloppy language, Boss.I read this out of the frame format" Something flashed on his display."Okay, here's the story on the cipher: the Company made it and its peers to cover shipping security. "Back before the Alliance, that had been the highest crypto level in the organization."This is the third that never got delivered.The whole was assumed compromised, but miracle of miracles, we still have a copy. "Both 'Frelle and 'Rolle were looking at Svensndot expectantly, their eyes large and dark.Standard policy  standard orders  were that transmissions on compromised keys were to be ignored.If the Company's signals people had been doing a proper job, the rotted cipher wouldn't even have been aboard and the policy would have enforced itself."Decrypt the thing," Svensndot said shortly.The last weeks had demonstrated that his company was a dismal failure when it came to military intelligence and signals.They might as well get some benefit from that incompetence."Yes sir!"Glimfrelle tapped a single key.Somewhere inside Olvira's signal processor, a long segment of "random" noise was broken into frames and laid precisely down on the "random" noise in the data frames incoming.There was a perceptible pause (damn the Bottom) and then the comm window lit with a flat video picture.   "fourth repetition of this message. "The words were Samnorsk, and a dialect of pure Herte i Sjandra.The speaker was for a heartstopping instant he was seeing Olvira again, alive.He exhaled slowly, trying to relax.Black haired, slim, violet eyed  just like Olvira.And just like a million other women of Sjandra Kei.The resemblance was there, but so vague he would never have been taken by it before.For an instant he imagined a universe beyond their lost fleet, and goals beyond vengeance.Then he forced his attention back to business, to seeing everything he could in the images in the window.The woman was saying, "We'll repeat three more times.If by then you have still not responded, we will attempt a different target. "She pushed back from the camera pickup, giving them a view of the room behind her.It was low ceilinged, deep.An ultradrive trace display dominated the background, but Svensndot paid it little attention.There were two Skroderiders in the background.One wore stripes on its skrode that meant a trade history with Sjandra Kei.The other must be a lesser Rider; its skrode was small and wheelless.The pickup turned, centered on the fourth figure.Human?Probably, but of no Nyjoran heritage.In another time, his appearance would have been big news across all human civilizations in the Beyond.Now the point only registered on Svensndot's mind as another cause for suspicion.The woman continued, "You can see that we are human and Rider.We are the entire crew of the Out of Band II.We are not part of the Alliance for the Defense nor agents of the Blight But we are the reason their fleets are down here.If you can read this, we're betting that you are of Sjandra Kei.We must talk.Please reply using the tail of the pad that is decrypting this message. "The picture jigged and the woman's face was back in the foreground."This is the fifth repetition of this message," she said."We'll repeat two more  "  Glimfrelle cut the audio."If she means it, we have about one hundred seconds.What next, Captain?"Suddenly the Olvira was not an irrelevant straggler."We talk," said Svensndot.Response and counter response took a matter of seconds.After that five minutes of conversation with Ravna Bergsndot was enough to convince Kjet that what she had to say must be heard by Fleet Central.His ship would be a mere relay, but at least he had something very important to pass on.Fleet Central refused the full video link coming from the Out of Band.Someone on the flagship was dead set on following standard procedures  and using compromised cipher keys stuck in their craw.Even Kjet had to settle for a combat link: The screen showed a color image with high resolution.Looking at it carefully, one realized the thing was a poor evocation Kjet recognized Owner Limmende and Jan Skrits, her chief of staff, but they looked several years out of style.Olvira was matching old video with the transmitted animation cues.The actual communication channel was less that four thousand bits per second; Central was taking no chances.God only knew what they were seeing as the evocation of Pham Nuwen.The smokey skinned human had already explained his point several times.He was having as little success as Ravna Bergsndot before him.His cool manner had gradually deserted him.Desperation was beginning to show on his face.  "and I'm telling you, they are both your enemies.Sure, Alliance for the Defense destroyed Sjandra Kei, but the Blight is responsible for the situation that made that possible. "The half cartoonish figure of Jan Skrits glanced at Owner Limmende.Lord, evocations are crappy at the Bottom, Svensndot thought to himself.When Skrits spoke, his voice didn't even match his lip movements: "We do read Threats, Mr.Nuwen.The threat of the Blight was used as an excuse to destroy our worlds.We will not go on random killing sprees, especially against an organization that is clearly the enemy of our enemy Or are you claiming the Blight is secretly in league with the Alliance for the Defense?"Pham gave an angry shrug."No.I have no idea how the Blight regards the Alliance.But you should know the evil the Blight has been up to, things on a scale far grander than this 'Alliance'. ""Ah yes.That's what it says on the Net, Mr.Nuwen.But those events are thousands of light years away.They've been through multiple hops and unknown interpretations before they ever arrive in the Middle Beyond  even if the stories were true to begin with.It is not called the Net of a Million Lies for nothing. "The stranger's face darkened.He said something loud and angry, in a language that was totally unlike anything from Nyjora.The tones jumped up and down, almost like Dirokime twittering.He calmed himself with a visible effort, but when he continued his Samnorsk was even more heavily accented than before."Yes.But I'm telling you.I was at the Fall of Relay.The Blight is more than the worst horrors you've heard.The murder of Sjandra Kei was its smallest side effect.Will you help us against the Blighter fleet?"Owner Limmende pushed her massive form back into her chair webbing.She looked at her chief of staff and the two talked inaudibly.Kjet's gaze drifted beyond them; the flagship's command deck extended a dozen meters behind Limmende.Underofficers moved quietly about, some watching the conversation.The picture was crisp and clear, but when the figures moved it was with cartoonlike awkwardness.And some of the faces belonged to people Kjet knew had been transferred before the fall of Sjandra Kei.The processors here on the Olvira were taking the narrow band signal from Fleet Central, fleshing it out with detailed (and out of date) background and evoking the image shown.No more evocations after this, Svensndot promised himself, at least while we're down here.Owner Limmende looked back at the camera."Forgive a paranoid old cop, but I think it's possible that you might be of the Blight. "Limmende raised her hand as if to ward off interruptions, but the redhead just gaped in surprise."If we believe you, then we must accept that there is something useful and dangerous on the star system we're all heading towards.Furthermore, we must accept that both you and the 'Blighter fleet' are peculiarly qualified to take advantage of this prize.If we fight them as you ask, there will likely be few of us alive afterwards.You alone will have the prize.We fear what you might turn out to be. "For a long moment, Pham Nuwen was silent.The wildness slowly left his face."You have a point, Owner Limmende.And a dilemma.Is there any way out?""Skrits and I have been discussing it.No matter what we do, both we and you must take big chances It's only the alternatives that are more terrible.We are willing to accept your guidance in battle, if you will first maneuver your ship back toward us and allow us to board. ""Give up the lead in this chase, you mean?"Limmende nodded.Pham's mouth opened and closed, but no words emerged.He seemed to be having trouble breathing.Ravna said, "Then if you don't succeed, everything is lost.At least now, we have a sixty hour lead.That might be enough to get word out about this artifact, even if the Blighter fleet survives. "Skrits' face twisted, a cartoonish smile."You can't have it both ways.You want us to risk everything on your assurance of competence.We are willing to die for this, but not to be pawns in a game of monsters. "The last words had a strange tone, the angry delivery shading away.There had been no motion in the picture from Fleet Central except for ill synched lip movement.Glimfrelle caught Svensndot's eye and pointed at the failure lights on his comm panel.Skrits' voice continued, "And Group Captain Svensndot: It's imperative that all further communications with this unknown vessel be channeled  " the image froze, and there were no more words.Ravna: "What happened?"Glimfrelle made a twitter snort."We're losing the link with Fleet Central.Our effective bandwidth is down to twenty bits per second, and dropping.Skrits' last transmission was scarcely a hundred bits," padded out to apparent legibility by the Olvira's software.Kjet waved angrily at the screen."Cut the damn thing off. "At least he wouldn't have to put up with the evocation any further.And he didn't want to hear what he guessed was Jan Skrits' last order.Tirolle said, "Hei, why not leave it on?We might not notice much difference. "Glimfrelle's snickered at his brother's wit, but his longfingers danced across the comm panel, and the display became a window on the stars.The two Dirokimes had a thing about bureaucrats.Svensndot ignored them and looked at the remaining comm window.The channel to Pham and Ravna was wideband video with scarcely any interpretation; there would be no perverse subtleties if it went down."Sorry about that.The last few days, we've had a lot of problems with comm.Apparently, this Zone storm is the worst in centuries. "In fact, it was getting still worse: the starboard ultratrace displays were showing random garbage."You've lost contact with your command?"asked Ravna."For the moment" He glanced at Pham.The redhead's eyes were still a bit glassy."Look I'm even more sorry about how things have turned out, but Limmende and Skrits are bright people.You can see their point of view. ""Strange," interrupted Pham."The pictures were strange," his tone was drifty."You mean our relay from Fleet Central?"Svensndot explained about the narrow bandwidth and the crummy performance of his ship's processors down here at the Bottom."And so their picture of us must have been equally bad I wonder what they thought I was?""Unh" Good question.Consider Pham Nuwen: bristly red hair, smoke gray skin, singsong voice.If cues such as those were sent, like as not the display at Fleet Central would show something quite different from the human Kjet saw.  "wait a minute.That's not how evocations work.I'm sure they got a pretty clear view of you.See, a few high resolution pics would get sent at the beginning of the session.Then those would be used as the base for the animation. "Pham stared back lumpishly, almost as though he didn't buy it and was daring Kjet to think things through.Well damn it, the explanation was correct; there was no doubt that Limmende and Skrits had seen the redhead as a human.Yet there was something here that bothered Kjet Limmende and Skrits had both looked out of date."Glimfrelle!Check the raw stream we got from Central.Did they send us any sync pictures?"It took Glimfrelle only seconds.He whistled a sharp tone of surprise."No, Boss.And since it was all properly encrypted, our end just made do with old ad animation. "He said something to Tirolle, and the two twittered rapidly."Nothing seems to work down here.Maybe this is just another bug. "But Glimfrelle didn't sound very confident of the assertion.Svensndot turned back to the picture from the Out of Band."Look.The channel to Fleet Central was fully encrypted, using one time schemes I trust more than what we're talking with now.I can't believe it was a masquerade. "But nausea was creeping up Kjet's guts.This was like the first minutes of the Battle for Sjandra Kei, when he guessed how thoroughly they had been outmaneuvered, when he realized that everyone he was trying to protect would be murdered."Hei, we'll contact other vessels.We'll verify Central's location  "  Pham Nuwen raised an eyebrow."Maybe it wasn't a masquerade. "Before he could say more, one of the Riders  the one with the greater skrode  was shouting at them.It rolled across the room's apparent ceiling, pushing the humans aside to get close to the camera."I have a question!"The voder speech was burred, nearly unintelligible.The creature's tendrils rattled dryly against each other, as distressed as Kjet Svensndot had ever heard."My question: Are there Skroderiders aboard your fleet's command vessel?""Why do you  "  "Answer the question!""How should I know?"Kjet tried to think."Tirolle.You have friends on Skrits' staff.Are there any Riders aboard?"Tirolle stuttered a few bars, "A'a'a'a.Yes.Emergency hires  rescues actually  right after the battle. ""That's the best we can do, friend. "The Skroderider trembled, unspeaking.Then its tendrils seemed to wilt."Thank you," it said softly.It rolled back and out of camera range.Pham Nuwen disappeared from view.Ravna looked wildly around, "Wait please!"she said to the camera, and Kjet was looking at the abandoned command deck of the Out of Band.At the limit of the pickup's hearing came sounds of mumbled conversation, voder and human.Then she was back."What was that all about?"Svensndot to Ravna."N Nothing any of us can help anymore Captain Svensndot, it looks to me like your fleet is no longer run by the people you think. ""Maybe. "Probably."It's something I've got to think about. "She nodded.For a moment they looked at each other, unspeaking.So strange, so far from home and after all the heartbreak to see someone so familiar."You were truly at Relay?"the question sounded stupid in his ears.Yet in a way she was a bridge from what he knew and trusted to the deadly weirdness of the present situation.Ravna Bergsndot nodded."Yes and it was like everything you've read.We even had direct contact with a Power And yet it was not enough, Group Captain.The Blight destroyed it all.That part of the News is no lie. "Tirolle pushed back from his nav station."Then how can anything you do down here hurt the Blight?"The words were blunt, but 'Rolle's eyes were wide and serious.In fact, he was pleading for some sense behind all the death.Dirokimes had not been the greatest part of the Sjandra Kei civilization, but they had been by far its oldest member race.A million years ago they had burst out of the Slow Zone, colonizing the three systems that humans one day would call Sjandra Kei.Long before the humans arrived, they were a race of inward dreamers.They protected their star systems with ancient automation and friendly younger races.Another half million years and their race might be gone from the Beyond, extinct or evolved into something else.It was a common pattern, something like death and old age, but gentler.There is a common misconception about such senescent races, that their members are senescent too.In any large population, there will be variation.There will always be those who want to see the outside world and play there for a while.Humankind had gotten on very well with the likes of Glimfrelle and Tirolle.And Bergsndot seemed to understand."Have any of you heard of godshatter?"Kjet said, "No," then noticed that both Dirokimes had started.They whistled at each other for several seconds in some kind of surprise dialect."Yes," 'Rolle spoke at last in Samnorsk, his voice as close to awe as Kjet had ever heard."You know we Dirokimes have been in the Beyond for a long time.We've sent many colonies into the Transcend; some became Powers And once Something came back.It wasn't a Power of course.In fact, it was more like a mind crippled Dirokime.But it knew things and did things that made great changes for us. ""Fentrollar?"Kjet asked wonderingly, suddenly recognizing the story.It had happened one hundred thousand years before humankind arrived at Sjandra Kei, yet it was a central contradiction of the Dirokime terranes."Yes. "Tirolle said."Even now people don't agree if Fentrollar was a gift or a curse, but he founded the dream habitats and the Old Religion. "Ravna nodded, "That's the case most familiar to us of Sjandra Kei.Maybe it's not a happy example considering all its effects" and she told them about the fall of Relay, what had happened to Old One, and what had become of Pham Nuwen.The Dirokimes side chat dwindled to zero and they were very still.Finally Kjet said, "So what does Nu " he stumbled over the name, as strange as everything else about this fellow, "Nuwen know about the thing you seek at the Bottom?What can he do with it?""I I don't know, Group Captain.Pham Nuwen himself doesn't know.A little bit at a time, the insight comes.I believe, because I was there for some of it but I don't know how to make you believe. "She drew a shuddering breath.Kjet suddenly guessed what a strange, tortured place the Out of Band must be.Somehow that made the story more credible.Anything that really could destroy the Blight would be unwholesomely weird.Kjet wondered how he would do, locked up with such a thing."My Lady Ravna," he said, the words stilted and formal.After all, I'm suggesting treason."I, uh, I've got a number of friends in the Commercial Security fleet.I can check on the suspicions you've raised, and" say it!"it's possible we can give you support in spite of my HQ. ""Thank you, sir.Thank you. "Glimfrelle broke the silence."We're getting a poor signal on the Out of Band's channel now. "Kjet eyes swept the windows.All the ultratrace displays looked like random noise.Whatever this storm was, it was bad."Looks like we won't be talking much longer, Ravna Bergsndot. ""Yes.We're losing signal Group Captain, if none of this works, if you can't fight for us Your people are all that's left of Sjandra Kei.It's been good to see you and the Dirokimes after so long to see familiar faces, people I really understand.I  " as she spoke, her image square blurred into low frequency components."Huui!"said Glimfrelle."Bandwidth just dropped through the floor. "There was nothing sophisticated about their link to the Out of Band.Given communications problems, the ship's processors just switched to low rate coding."Hello, Out of Band.We've got problems on this channel now.Suggest we sign off. "The window turned gray, and printed Samnorsk flickered across it:   Yes.It is more than a communicati  Glimfrelle diddled his comm panel."Zip.Zero," he said."No detectable signal. "Tirolle looked up from his navigation tank."This is a lot more than a communications problem.Our computers haven't been able to commit on an ultradrive jump in more than twenty seconds. "They had been doing five jumps a second, and just over a light year per hour.Now  Glimfrelle leaned back from his panel."Hei  so welcome to the Slow Zone. "The Slow Zone.Ravna Bergsndot looked across the deck of the Out of Band II.Somewhere in the back of her mind, she had always had a vision of the Slowness as a stifling darkness lit at best by torches, the domain of cretins and mechanical calculators.In fact, things didn't look much different from before.The ceilings and walls glowed just as before.The stars still shone through the windows (only now, it might be a very long time before any of them moved).It was on the OOB's other displays that the change was most obvious.The ultratrace tank blinked monotonously, a red legend displaying elapsed time since the last update.Navigation windows were filled with output from the diagnostics exercising the drive processors.
