In fact, I still think those butterflies might just be part of an act.It's all too melodramatic. "Blueshell's fronds rattled in a way that Pham recognized as a kind of shiver."I wager not, Sir Pham.Those were Aprahanti.Just the look of them fills you with dread, does it not?They're rare these days, but a star trader knows the stories.Still this is a little much even for Aprahanti.Their Hegemony has been on the wane for several centuries. "He rattled something at the ship, and the windows were filled with views of nearby berths in the repair harbor.There was more Rider rattling, this time between Greenstalk and Blueshell."Those other ships are a uniform type, you know.A High Beyond design like ours, but more, um, militant. "Greenstalk moved close to a window."There are twenty of them.Why would so many need drive repairs all at once?"Militant?Pham looked at the ships with a critical eye.He knew the major features of Beyonder vessels by now.These appeared to have rather large cargo capacity.Elaborate sensoria too.Hm."Okay, so the Butterflies are hard types.How scared is Saint Rihndell and company?"The Skroderiders were silent for a long moment.Pham couldn't tell if his question was being given serious consideration or if they had simultaneously lost track of the conversation.He looked at Ravna."How about the local net?I'd like to get some background. "She was already running comm routines."They weren't accessible earlier.We couldn't even get the News. "That was something Pham could understand, even if it was damned irritating.The "local net" was a RIP wide ultrawave computer and communication network, perhaps a billion times more complex than anything Pham had known  but conceptually similar to organizations in the Slow Zone.And Pham Nuwen had seen what vandals could do to such structures; Qeng Ho had dealt with at least one obnoxious civilization by perverting its computer net.Not surprisingly, Saint Rihndell hadn't provided them with links to the RIP net.And as long as they were in harbor, the OOB's antenna swarm was necessarily down, so they were also cut off from the Known Net and the newsgroups.A grin lit Ravna's face."Hei!Now we've got read access, maybe more.Greenstalk.Blueshell.Wake up!"Rattle."I wasn't asleep," claimed Blueshell, "just thinking on Sir Pham's question.Saint Rihndell is obviously afraid. "As usual, Greenstalk didn't make excuses.She rolled around her mate to get a better look at Ravna's newly opened comm window.There was an iterated triangle design with Trisk annotations.It meant nothing to Pham."That's interesting," said Greenstalk."I am chuckling," said Blueshell."It is more than interesting.Saint Rihndell is a hard trading type.But look, he is making no charge for this service, not even a percentage of barter.He is afraid, but he still wants to deal with us. "Hmm, so something from their High Beyond samples was enough to make him risk Aprahanti violence.Just hope it's not something we really need too."Okay.Rav, see if  "  "Just a second," the woman replied."I want to check the News. "She started a search program.Her eyes flickered quickly across her console window and after a second she choked, and her face paled."By the Powers, no!""What is it?"But Ravna didn't reply, or put the news to a main window.Pham grabbed the rail in front of her console and pulled himself around so he could see what she was reading:   Crypto: 0  As received by: Harmonious Repose Communication Synod  Language path: Baeloresk Triskweline, SjK units  From: Alliance for the Defense [Claimed cooperative of five polyspecific empires in the Beyond below Straumli Realm.No record of existence before the Fall of the Realm. ]Subject: Bold victory over the Perversion  Distribution:  Threat of the Blight, War Trackers Interest Group, Homo Sapiens Interest Group  Date: 159.06 days since fall of Relay  Key phrases: Action, not talk; A promising beginning   Text of message:  One hundred seconds ago, Alliance Forces began action against the tools of the Blight.By the time you read this, the Homo Sapiens worlds known as Sjandra Kei will have been destroyed.Note well: for all the talk and theories that have flown about the Blight, this is the first time anyone has successfully acted.Sjandra Kei was one of only three systems outside of Straumli Realm known to harbor humans in any numbers.In one stroke we have destroyed a third of the Perversion's potential for expansion.Updates will follow.Death to vermin.There was one other message in the window, an update of sorts, but not from Death to Vermin:   Crypto: 0  Billing: charity/general interest  As received by: Harmonious Repose Communication Synod  Language path: Samnorsk Triskweline, SjK units  From: Commercial Security, Sjandra Kei [Note from lower protocol layer: This message was received at Sneerot Down along the Sjandra Kei bearing.The transmission was very weak, perhaps from a shipboard transmitter]  Subject: Please help  Distribution:  Threats Interest Group  Date: 5.33 hours since disaster at Sjandra Kei  Text of message:  Earlier today, relativistic projectiles struck our main habitations.Fatalities cannot be less than twenty five billion.Three billion may still live, in transit and in smaller habitats.We are still under attack.Enemy craft are in the inner system.We see glow bombs.They are killing everyone.Please.We need help."Nei nei nei!"Ravna drove up against him, her arms tight around him, her face buried in his shoulder.She sobbed incoherent Samnorsk.Her whole body shuddered against him.He felt tears coming to his own eyes.So strange.She had been the strong one, and he the fragile crazy.Now it was turned all around, and what could he do?"Father, mother, sister  gone, gone. "It was the disaster they thought could not happen, and now it had.In one minute she had lost everything she grew up with, and was suddenly alone in the universe.For me, that happened long ago, the thought came strangely dispassionate.He hooked a foot into the deck and gently rocked Ravna back and forth, trying to comfort her.The sounds of grief gradually quieted, though he could still feel her sobs through his chest.She didn't raise her face from the tear soaked place on his shirt.Pham looked over her head at Blueshell and Greenstalk.Their fronds looked strange almost wilted."Look, I want to take Ravna away for a bit.Learn what you can, and I'll be back. ""Yes, Sir Pham. "And they seemed to droop even more.It was an hour before Pham returned to the command deck.When he did, he found the Riders deep in rattling conference with OOB.All the windows were filled with flickering strangeness.Here and there Pham recognized a pattern or a printed legend, enough to guess that he was seeing ordinary ship displays, but optimized to Rider senses.Blueshell noticed him first; he rolled abruptly toward him and his voder voice came out a little squeaky."Is she all right?"Pham gave a little nod."She's sleeping now. "Sedated, and with the ship watching her in case I've misjudged her."Look, she'll be okay.She's been hit hard but she's the toughest one of us all. "Greenstalk's fronds rattled a smile."I have often thought that. "Blueshell was motionless for an instant.Then, "Well, to business, to business. "He said something to the ship, and the windows reformatted in the compromise usable by both humans and Riders."We've learned a lot while you were gone.Saint Rihndell indeed has something to fear.The Aprahanti ships are a small fragment of the Death to Vermin extermination fleets.These are stragglers still on their way to Sjandra Kei!"All dressed up for a massacre, and no place to go."So now they want some action of their own. ""Yes.Apparently Sjandra Kei put up some resistance and there were some escapes.The commander of this fleetlet thinks he can intercept some of these  if he can get prompt repairs. ""What kind of extortion is really possible?Could these twenty ships destroy RIP?""No.It's the reputation of the greater force these ships are part of  and the great killing at Sjandra Kei.So Saint Rihndell is very timid with them, and what they need for repairs is the same class of regrowth agent that we need.We really are in competition with them for Rihndell's business. "Blueshell's fronds slapped together, the sort of "go get'em" enthusiasm he displayed when a hot deal was remembered."But it turns out we have something Saint Rihndell really, really wants, something he'll even risk tricking the Aprahanti to get. "He paused dramatically.Pham thought back over the things they had offered the RIPers.Lord, not the low zone ultrawave gear."Okay, I'll bite.What do we have to give'em?""A set of flamed trellises!Hah hah. ""Huh?"Pham remembered the name from the list of odds and ends the Skroderiders had scrounged up."What's a 'flamed trellis'?"Blueshell poked a frond into his satchel and extended something stubby and black to Pham: an irregular solid, about forty centimeters by fifteen, smooth to the touch.For all its size, it didn't mass more than a couple of grams.An artfully smoothed cinder.Pham's curiosity triumphed over greater concerns: "But what's it good for?"Blueshell dithered.After a moment, Greenstalk said a little shyly, "There are theories.It's pure carbon, a fractal polymer.We know it's very common in Transcendent cargoes.We think it's used as packing material for some kinds of sentient property. ""Or perhaps the excrement of such property," Blueshell buzz muttered."Ah, but that's not important.What is, is that occasional races in the Middle Beyond prize them.And why that?Again, we don't know.Saint Rihndell's folk are certainly not the final user.The Tusk legs are far too sensible to be ordinary trellis customers.So.We have three hundred of these wonderful things more than enough to overcome Saint Rihndell's fears of the Aprahanti. "While Pham had been away with Ravna, Saint Rihndell had come up with a plan.Applying the regrowth agent would be too obvious in the same harbor with the Aprahanti ships.Besides, the chief Butterfly had demanded the OOB move out.Saint Rihndell had a small harbor about sixteen million klicks around the RIP system.The move was even plausible, for it happened that there was a Skroderider terrane in the Harmonious Repose system  and currently it was just a few hundred kilometers from Rihndell's second harbor.They would rendezvous with the tusk legs, exchanging repairs for two hundred seventeen flamed trellises.And if the trellises were perfectly matched, Rihndell promised to throw in an agrav refit.After the Fall of Relay, that would be very welcome Hunh.Ol' Blueshell just never stopped wheeling and dealing.The OOB slipped free of its moorings and carefully drifted up from the ring plane.Tiptoe ing out.Pham kept a close watch on the EM and ultrawave windows.But there were no target locking emanations from the Aprahanti vessels, nothing more than casual radar contact.No one followed.Little OOB and its "potted plants" were beneath the notice of the great warriors.One thousand meters above the ring plane.Three.The Skroderiders' chatter  both with Pham and between themselves  dwindled to naught.Their stalks and fronds angled so the sensing surfaces looked out in all directions.The sun and its power cloud was a blaze of light on one side of the deck.They were above the rings, but still so close It was like standing at sunset on a beach of colored sands that stretched to an infinite horizon.The Skroderiders stared into it, their fronds gently swaying.Twenty kilometers above the rings.One thousand.They lit the OOB's main torch and accelerated across the system.The Skroderiders came slowly out of their trance.Once they arrived at the second harbor, the regrowth would take about five hours  assuming Rihndell's agent had not deteriorated; the Saint claimed it was recently imported from the Top, and undiluted."Okay, so when do we deliver the trellises?""On completion of the repairs.We can't depart until Saint Rihndell  or his customers  are satisfied that all the pieces are genuine. "Pham drummed his fingers on the comm console.This operation brought back a lot of memories, some of them hair raising."So they get the goods while we're still in the middle of RIP.I don't like it. ""See here, Sir Pham.Your experience with star trading was in the Slow Zone, where exchanges were separated by decades or centuries of travel time.I admire you for that, more than I can say  but it gives you a twisted view of things.Up here in the Beyond, the notion of return business is important.We know very little of Saint Rihndell's inner motivation, but we do know his repair business has existed for at least forty years.Sharp dealing we can expect from him, but if he robbed or murdered very many, trader groups would know, and his little business would starve. ""Hmf. "No point in arguing it right now, but Pham guessed that this situation was special.Rihndell  and the RIPers in general  had Death to Vermin sitting on their doorstep, and stories of major chaos coming from the direction of Sjandra Kei.With that background they might just lose their courage once they had the trellises.Some precautions were in order.He drifted off to the ship's machine shop.Ravna came to the cargo deck as Blueshell and Greenstalk were preparing the trellises for delivery.She moved hesitantly, pushing awkwardly from point to point.There were dark rings, almost bruises, beneath her eyes.She returned Pham's hug almost tentatively, but didn't let go."I want to help.Is there anything I can do to help?"The Skroderiders left their trellises and rolled over.Blueshell ran a frond gently across Ravna's arm, "Nothing for you to do now, my lady Ravna.We have everything well, ah, in hand.We'll be back in less than an hour, and then we can be rid of here. "But they let her check their cameras and the cargo strap downs.Pham drifted close by her as she inspected the trellises.The twisted carbon blocks looked stranger than the one alone had.Properly stacked, they fit perfectly.More than a meter across, the stack looked like a three dimensional jigsaw puzzle carved from coal.Counting a separate bag of loose spares, they totaled less than half a kilogram.Huh.Damn things should be flammable as hell.Pham resolved to play with the remaining hundred odd trellises after they were safely back in deep space.Then the Skroderiders were through the cargo lock with their delivery, and they could only follow along on their cameras.This secondary harbor was not really part of the tusk leg race's terrane.The inside of the arc was far different from what they had seen on the Skroderiders' first trip.There were no exterior views.Cramped passages wound between irregular walls pocked with dark holes.Insects flew everywhere, often covering parts of the camera balls.To Pham, the place looked filthy.There was no evidence of the terrane's owners  unless they were the pallid worms that sometimes stuck a featureless head(?)up from a burrow hole.Over his voice link, Blueshell opined that these were very ancient tenants of the RIP system.After a million years, and a hundred transcendent emigrations, the residue might still be sentient, but stranger than anything evolved in the Slow Zone.Such a people would be protected from physical extinction by ancient automation, but they would also be inward turning, totally cautious, absorbed in concerns that were inane by any outside standard.It was the type that most often lusted after trellis work.Pham tried to keep an eye on everything.The Riders had to travel almost four kilometers from the harbor lock to reach the place where the trellises would be "validated".Pham counted two exterior locks along the way, and nothing that looked especially threatening  but then how would he know what "threatening" looked like here?He had the OOB mount an exterior watch.A large shepherd satellite floated on the outer side of the ring, but there were no other ships in this harbor.The EM and ultra environment seemed placid, and what could be seen on the local net did not make the ship's defenses suspicious.Pham looked up from the reports.Ravna had drifted across the deck to the outside view.The repair work was visible, though not spectacular.A pale greenish aura hung around the damaged spines.It was scarcely brighter than the glow you often see on ship hulls in low planetary orbit.She turned and said softly, "Is it really getting fixed?""As far as we can  I mean yes. "Ship's automation was monitoring the regrowth, but they wouldn't know for sure till they tried to fly with it.Pham was never sure why Rihndell had the Skroderiders pass through the wormheads' terrane; maybe, if the creatures were the ultimate trellis users, they wanted a look at the sellers.Or maybe it had some connection with the treachery that ultimately followed.In any case the Riders were soon out of it, and into a polyspecific concourse as crowded as any low tech bazaar.Pham's jaw sagged.Everywhere he looked there was a different class of sophont.Intelligent life is a rare development in the universe; in all his life in the Slow Zone, he had known three nonhuman races.But the universe is a big place, and with ultradrive it was easy to find other life.The Beyond collected the detritus of countless migrations, an accumulation that finally made civilization ubiquitous.For a moment he lost track of his surveillance programs and his general suspicions, drowned in the wonder of it.Ten species?Twelve?Individuals brushed familiarly by one another.Even Relay had not been like this.But then Harmonious Repose was a civilization lost in stagnation.These races had been part of the RIP complex for thousands of years.The ones that could interact had long since learned to do so.And nowhere did he see butterfly wings on creatures with large, compassionate eyes.He heard a small sound of surprise from the far side of the deck.Ravna was standing close by a window that looked out from one of Greenstalk's side cameras."What is it, Rav?""Skroderiders.See?"She pointed into the mob and zoomed the view.For a moment the images towered over her.Through the passing chaos he had a glimpse of hull forms and graceful fronds.Except for cosmetic stripes and tassles, they looked very familiar indeed."Yeah, there's a small colony of them hereabouts. "He opened the channel to Greenstalk and told her about the sighting."I know.We smelled them.Sigh.I wish we had time to visit them after this.Finding friends in far places always nice. "She helped Blueshell push the trellises around a balloon acquarium.They could see Rihndell's people just ahead.Six tusk legs sat on the wall around what might be test equipment.Blueshell and Greenstalk pushed their ball of frothy carbon into the group.The scrimshawed one leaned close to the pile and reached out to fondle the pieces with its tiny arms.One after another the trellises were placed in the tester.Blueshell moved in close to watch, and Pham set the main windows to look through his cameras.Twenty seconds passed.Rihndell's Trisk interpreter said, "First seven test true, make an interlocked septet. "Only then did Pham realize he had been holding his breath.The next three "septets" passed, too.Another sixty seconds.He glanced at the ship's repair status.OOB considered the job done but for sign off commit from the local net.Another few minutes and we can kiss this place goodbye!But there are always problems.Saint Rihndell bitched about the twelfth and fifteenth sets.Blueshell argued at length, grudgingly produced replacement pieces from his bag of spares.Pham couldn't tell if the Skroderider was debating for the fun of it, or if he really was short on good replacements.Twenty five sets okayed."Where is Greenstalk going?"said Ravna."What?"Pham called up the view from Greenstalk's cameras.She was five meters from Blueshell and moving away.He panned wildly about.A local Skroderider was on her left and another floated inverted above her.Its fronds touched hers in apparently amiable conversation."Greenstalk!"There was no reply."Blueshell!What's happening?"But that Rider was in gesticulating argument with the tusk legs.Still another set of trellises had failed their examination."Blueshell!"After a moment the Rider's voice came over their private channel.He sounded drifty, the way he often did when he was jammed or overloaded."Not to bother me now, Sir Pham.I'm down to three perfect replacements.I must persuade these fellows to settle for what they already have. "Ravna broke in, "But what about Greenstalk?What's happening to her?"The cameras had lost sight of each other.Greenstalk and her companions emerged from a dense crowd and floated across the middle of the concourse.They were using gas jets instead of wheels.Someone was in a hurry.The seriousness of events finally got through to Blueshell.The view from his skrode turned wildly as he rolled back and forth around Saint Rihndell's people.There was the rattle of Rider talk and then his voice came back on the inside channel, plaintive and confused."She's gone.She's gone.I must I have to" Abruptly he rolled back to the tusk legs and resumed the argument that had just been interrupted.After a couple of seconds his voice came back on the inside channel."What should I do, Sir Pham?I have a sale here still incomplete, yet my Greenstalk has wandered off. "Or been kidnapped."Get us the sale, Blueshell.Greenstalk will be okay OOB: Plan B. "He grabbed a headset and pushed off from the console.Ravna rose with him."Where are you going?"He grinned."Out.I thought Saint Rihndell might lose his halo when the crunch came  and I made plans. "She followed him as he glided toward the floor hatch."Look.I want you to stay on deck.I can only carry so much snoop equipment; I'll need your coordination. ""But  "  He went through the hatch head first, missing the rest of her objection.She didn't follow, but a second later her voice was back, in his headset.Some of the tremor was gone from her voice; the old Ravna was there, fighting out from under her other problems."Okay, I'll back you but what can we do?"Pham pulled himself hand over hand down the passageway, accelerating to a speed that would have left a lubber caroming off the walls.Ahead loomed the uncompromising wall of the cargo lock.He swatted a hand gently at the wall and flipped head over heels.He dragged his hands precisely against the wall flanges, slowing just enough so the impact with the hatch did not break his ankles.Inside the lock, the ship had his suit already power up."Pham, you can't go out. "Evidently she was watching through the lock's cameras."They'll know we're a human expedition. "His head and shoulders were already in the suit's top shell.He felt the bottom pushing up around him, the seals fastening."Not necessarily. "And by now it probably doesn't matter."There are plenty of two arm/two leg critters around, and I've glued some camouflage to this outfit. "He cupped his chin in the helmet controls and reset the displays.The armored pressure suit was a very primitive thing compared to the field suits of Relay.Yet the Qeng Ho would have given a starship for this gear.He'd originally put the thing together to impress the Tines, but it's going to get some early testing.He chinned up the outside view, what Ravna was seeing: his figure was unrelieved black, more than two meters tall.The hands were backed with carapace claws and every edge of his figure was razor sharp and spined.These most recent additions should break the lines of the strictly human form, and hopefully be intimidating as hell.Pham cycled the lock and pushed off, into the wormheads' terrane.Walls of mud stood all around, misty in humid air and swarms of insects.Ravna's voice was in his ear."I've got a low level query, probably automatic: 'Why you send third negotiator?'""Ignore it. ""Pham, be careful.These Middle Beyond cultures, the old ones, they keep nasty things in reserve.Otherwise they wouldn't still be around. ""I'll be a good citizen. "As long as I'm treated nice.He was already halfway to the concourse gate.He chinned up a small window from Blueshell's camera.All this high bandwidth comm was courtesy of the local net.Strange that Rihndell was still providing the service.Blueshell seemed to be negotiating still.Maybe there wasn't a scam or anyway, not one that Saint Rihndell was in on."Pham, I've lost the video from Greenstalk, just as she went into some kind of tunnel.Her location beacon is still clear. "The concourse gate made an opening for him, and then Pham was in the crowded, market volume.He heard the raucous hubbub even through his armor.He moved slowly, sticking to the most uncrowded paths, following guide ropes that threaded the space.The mob was no problem.Everyone made way, some with almost panicky haste.Pham didn't know whether it was his razor spines or the trace of chlorine his suit "leaked".Maybe that last touch was a bit much.But the whole point was to look nonhuman.He slowed even more, doing his best not to nick anyone.Something awfully like a target designation laser flickered in his rear window.He ducked quickly around an aquarium as Ravna said, "The terrane just complained to your suit: 'You are in violation of dress code' is how the translation comes out. "Is it my chlorine B. O. , or have they detected the guns?"What about outside?Any Butterflies in sight?""No.Ship activity hasn't changed much during the last five hours.No Aprahanti movement or change in comm status. "Long pause.Indirectly from the OOB bridge he could hear Blueshell talking with Ravna, the words indistinct but excited.He jabbed around, trying to find the direct connection.Then Ravna was talking to him again."Hei!Blueshell says Rihndell has accepted the shipment!He's onloading the agrav fabric right now.And OOB just got a commit on the repairs!"So they were ready to fly  except that three of them were still ashore, and one of them was missing.Pham floated over the top of the aquarium and finally caught direct sight of Blueshell.He tweaked the suit's gas jets very carefully and settled down beside the Rider.His arrival was about as welcome as finger mites at a picnic.The scrimshawed one had been chattering away, tapping his articulated artwork on the wall as his helper translated into Trisk.Now the creature drew in his tusks, and the neck arms folded themselves.The others followed suit.All of them sidled up the wall, away from Blueshell and Pham."Our business is now complete.We don't know where your friend has gone," said the Trisk interpreter.Blueshell's fronds extended after them, wavering."B but just a little guidance is all we need.Who  " It was no use.Saint Rihndell and his merry crew kept going.Blueshell rattled in abrupt frustration.His fronds angled slightly, turning all attention on Pham Nuwen."Sir Pham, I am doubting now your expertise as a trader.Saint Rihndell might have helped. ""Maybe. "Pham watched the tusk legs disappear into the crowd, pulling the trellises behind them like a big black balloon.Ugh.Maybe Rihndell was simply an honest trader."What are the chances that Greenstalk would abandon you in the middle of something like that?"Blueshell dithered for a moment."In an ordinary trade stop, she might have noticed some extraordinary profit opportunity.But here, I  "  Ravna's voice interrupted sympathetically, "Maybe she just, uh, forgot the context?""No," Blueshell was definite."The skrode would never permit such a failure, not in the middle of a hard trade. "Pham shifted windows around inside his helmet, looking in all directions.The crowd was still keeping an open space around them.There was no evidence of cops.Would I know them if I saw them?"Okay," said Pham."We have a problem, whether I'd come out or not.I suggest we take a little walk, see if we can find where Greenstalk went. "Rattle."We have little choice now.My lady Ravna, do please try to reach the tusk legs interpreter.Perhaps he can link us to the local Skroderiders. "He came off the wall, rotated on gas jets."Come along, Sir Pham. "Blueshell led the way across the concourse, vaguely in the direction Greenstalk had gone.Their path was anything but straight, more a drunkard's walk that once took them almost back to their starting place."Delicately, delicately," the Skroderider responded when Pham complained about the pace.The Rider never insisted on passage through clots of critters.If they did not respond to the gentle waving of his fronds, he detoured all around them.And he kept Pham directly behind him so the intimidation factor of the razored armor was of no use."These people may look very peaceable to you, Sir Pham, easy to push around.But note, this is among themselves.These races have had thousands of years to accommodate to one another, to achieve local commensality.To outsiders they will necessarily be less tolerant, else they would have been overrun long ago. "Pham remembered the "dress code" warning and decided not to argue.The next twenty minutes would have been the experience of a lifetime for a Qeng Ho trader, to be within arm's reach of a dozen different intelligent species.But when they finally reached the far wall, Pham was grinding his teeth.Twice more he received a dress code warning.The only bright spot: Saint Rihndell was still extending the courtesy of local net support, and Ravna had more information: "The local Skroderider colony is about a hundred kilometers from the concourse.There's some kind of transport station beyond the wall you're at. "And the tunnel Greenstalk had entered was just ahead of them.From this angle, they could see the dark of space beyond it.For the first time, there was no problem with crowds; scarcely anyone was entering or leaving the hole.Laser light twinkled on his rear windows."Dress code violation.Fourth warning.It says to 'please leave the volume at once'. ""We're going.We're going. "Darkness, and Pham boosted the gain on his helmet windows.At first he thought the "transport station" was open to space, that the locals had restraint fields as in the high beyond.then he noticed the pillars merged into transparent walls.they were still indoors in the old fashioned way, but the view they were on the starward side of the arc.the ring particles were like dark fish floating silently a few tens of meters out from him.In the further distance, structures stuck out of the ring plane far enough to get sundazzle.But the brightest object was almost overhead: the blue of ocean, the white of cloud.Its soft light flooded the ground around him.However far the Qeng Ho fared, such a sight had been welcome.Yet this was not quite the real thing.The was only approximately spherical, and its face was bisected by the ring shadow.It was a small object, not more than a few hundred klicks above him, one of the shepherd satellites they had seen on the way in.The shepherd's haze of atmosphere was crisply bounded by the sides of a vast canopy.He dragged his attention down from the view."Ten to one that's the Skroderiders' terrane. ""Of course," Blueshell replied."It's typical.The surf in such minigravity can never be what I prefer, but  "  "Dear Blueshell!Sir Pham!Over here. "It was Greenstalk's voice.According to Pham's suit, it was a local connection, not relayed through the    OOB.Blueshell's fronds angled in all directions."Are you all right, Greenstalk?"They rattled back and forth at each other for a few seconds.Then Greenstalk resumed in Trisk: "Sir Pham.Yes, I'm all right.I'm sorry to upset you all so much.But I could tell the deal with Rihndell was going to work out, and then these local Riders stopped by.They are wonderful people, Sir Pham.They have invited us across to their terrane.Just for a day or so.It will be a wonderful rest before we go on our way.And I think they may be able to help us. "Like the quest romances he'd found in Ravna's bedtime library: the weary travelers, partway to their goal, find a friendly haven and some special gift.Pham switched to a private line to Blueshell: "Is that really Greenstalk?Is she under duress?""It's her, and free, Sir Pham.You heard us speaking.I've been with her two hundred years.No one's twisting her fronds. ""Then why the hell did she skip out on us?"Pham surprised himself, almost hissing the words.Long pause."That is strange.My guess: these local Riders somehow know something very important to us.Come, Sir Pham.But carefully. "He rolled away in what seemed a random direction."Rav, what do you  " Pham noticed the red light blinking on his comm status panel, and his irritation chilled.How long had the link to Ravna been down?Pham followed Blueshell, floating low behind the other, using his gas jets to pace the Skroderider.This entire area was covered with the stickem that Riders liked for zero gee rolling.Yet right now the place seemed deserted.Nobody in sight where just a hundred meters away there was light and crowds.The whole thing screamed ambush, yet it didn't make sense.If Death to Vermin  or their stooges  had spotted them, a simple alarum would have served.Some Rihndell game?Pham powered up the suit's beam weapons and enabled countermeasures; midge cameras flitted off in all directions.So much for dress codes.The bluish moonlight washed the plain, showing soft mounds and angular arrays of unknown equipment.The surface was pocked with holes (tunnel entrances?).Blueshell said something muddled about the "beautiful night", how much fun it would be to sit on the seashore a hundred kilometers above them.Pham scanned in all directions, trying to identify fields of fire and killing zones.The view from one of his midges showed a forest of leafless fronds  Skroderiders standing silent in the moonlight.They were two hillocks away.Silent, motionless, without any lights perhaps just enjoying the moonlight.In the midge's amplified view, Pham had no trouble identifying Greenstalk; she was standing at one end of a line of five Riders, her hull stripes clearly visible.There was a hump on the front of her skrode, and a rod like projection.Some kind of restraint?He floated a couple of midges near.A weapon.All those Riders were armed."We're already aboard the transport, Blueshell," came Greenstalk's voice."You'll see it in a few more meters, just on the other side of a ventilator pile," apparently referring to the mound that he and the Skroderider were approaching.But Pham knew there was no flier there; Greenstalk and her guns were to the side of their progress.Treachery, very workmanlike but also very low tech.Pham almost shouted out to Blueshell.Then he notice the flat ceramic rectangle mounted in the hill just a few meters behind the Rider.The nearest midge reported it was some kind of explosive, probably a directional mine.A low resolution camera, barely more than a motion sensor, was mounted beside it.Blueshell had rolled nonchalantly past the thing, all the while chattering with Greenstalk.They let him past.New suspicions rose dark and grim.Pham broke to a stop, backing quickly; never touching ground, the only sounds he made were the quiet hisses of his gas jets.He detached one of his wrist claws and had a midge fly it close past the mine's sensor  There was a flash of pale fire and a loud noise.Even five meters to the side, the shock wave pushed him back.He had a glimpse of Blueshell thrown frond over wheels on the far side of the mine.Edged metal knickered about, but mindlessly: nothing came back to attack again.Several midges were destroyed by the blast.Pham took advantage of the racket to accelerate hard, scooting up a nearby "hill" and into a shallow valley (alley?)that looked down on the Skroderiders.The ambushers rolled forward around the hill, rattling happily at one another.Pham held his fire, curious.After a moment, Blueshell floated into the air a hundred meters away."Pham?"he said plaintively, "Pham?"The ambushers ignored Blueshell.Three of them disappeared around the hill.Pham's midges saw them stop in consternation, fronds erect  they had suddenly realized he'd gotten away.The five spread out, searching the area, hunting him down.There was no persuasive talk from Greenstalk anymore.There was a sharp cracking sound and blaster fire glowed from behind a hill.Somebody was a little nervous on the trigger.Above it all floated Blueshell, the perfect target, yet still untouched.His speech was a combination of Trisk and Rider rattle now, and where Pham could understand it, he heard fear."Why are you shooting?What is the problem?Greenstalk, please!"The paranoid in Pham Nuwen was not deceived.I don't want you up there looking down.He sighted his main beam gun on the Rider, then shifted his aim and fired.The blast was not in visible wavelengths, but there were gigajoules in the pulse.Plasma coruscated along the beam, missing Blueshell by less than five meters.Well above the Skroderider, the beam struck hull crystal.The explosion was spectacular, an actinic glare that sent glowing fragments in a thousand rays.Pham flew sideways even as the ceiling flared.He saw Blueshell spinning off, regain control  and move precipitously for cover.Where Pham's beam had hit, a corona of light was dimming from blue through orange and red, its light still brighter than the shepherd moon overhead.His warning shot had been like a great finger pointing back toward his location.In the next fifteen seconds, four of the ambushers fired on the place Pham had been.There was silence, then faint rustling.In a game of stealth, the five might think themselves easy winners.They still hadn't realized how well equipped he was.Pham smiled at the pictures coming in from his midges.He had every one of them in sight, and Blueshell too.If it were just these four (five?), there would be no problem.But surely reinforcements, or at least complications, were on the way.The wound in the ceiling had cooled to darkness, but there was a hole there now, half a meter across.The sound of hissing wind came from it, a sound that brought reflex fear to Pham even in his armor.It might take a while before the leak affected the Skroderiders, but it was an emergency nevertheless.It would attract notice.He stared at the hole.Down here it was stirring a breeze, but in the few meters right below the hole there was a miniature tornado of dust and loose junk, hurtling up and out  And beyond the transparent hull, in space:  A gap of dark and then a glittering plume, where the debris emerged from the arc's shadow into the sunlight.A neat idea struggled for his attention.Oops.The five Riders had roughly encircled him.Now one blundered into view, saw him, and snapped a shot.Pham returned fire and the other exploded in a cloud of superheated water and charred flesh.Its undamaged skrode sailed across the space between the hills, collecting panicky fire from the others.Pham changed position again, moving in the direction he knew was farthest from his enemies' positions.A few more minutes of peace.He looked up at the crystal plume.There was something yes.If reinforcements should come, why not for him?He sighted on the plume and shunted his voice line through the gun's trigger circuit.He almost started talking, then thought Better lower the power on this one.Details.He aimed again, fired continuously, and said, "Ravna, I sure as hell hope you have your eyes open.I need help" and briefly described the crazy events of the last ten minutes.This time his beam was putting out less than ten thousand joules per second, not enough to glow the air.But reflecting off the plume beyond the hull, the modulation should be visible for thousands of klicks, in particular to the OOB on the other side of the habitat.The Skroderiders were closing in again.Damn.No way he could leave this message on automatic send; he needed the "transmitter" for more important things.Pham flew from valley to valley, maneuvering behind the Rider that was farthest from the others.One against three (four?).He had superior firepower and information, but one piece of bad luck and he was dead.He floated up on his next target.Quietly, carefully  A sear of light brushed his arm, flaring the armor incandescent.White hot drops of metal sprayed as he twisted out of the way.He boosted straight across the space between three hillocks, firing down on the Rider there.Lights crisscrossed around him, and then he was under cover again.They were fast, almost as if they had automatic aiming gear.Maybe they did: their skrodes.Then the pain hit.Pham folded on himself, gasping.If this were like wounds he remembered, there would be char to the bone.Tears floated in his eyes, and consciousness disappeared in a nauseated faint.He came to.It could only be a second or two later  else he'd never have wakened.The others were a lot closer now, but the one he'd fired on was just a glowing crater and random skrode fragments.His suit's automation brought the damaged armor in close to his side.He felt the chill of local anesthetic, and the pain dimmed.Pham eased around the hill, trying to keep all three of his antagonists simultaneously out of sight.They had caught on to his midges; every few seconds a glow erupted or a hill top turned to glowing slag.It was overkill, but the midges were dying and he was losing his greatest advantage.Where is Blueshell?Pham cycled through the views from his remaining midges, then his own.The bastard was back in the air, high above the combat  untouched by his fellow Riders.Reporting everything I do.Pham rolled over, awkwardly bringing his gun to bear on the tiny figure.He hesitated.You're getting soft, Nuwen.Blueshell abruptly accelerated downwards, his cargo scarf billowing out behind him.Evidently he was using his gas jets' full power.Against the background noise of bubbling metal and blast beam thunder, his fall was totally silent.He was driving straight for the nearest of the attackers.Thirty meters up, the Rider released something large and angular.The two separated, Blueshell braking and diving to the side.He disappeared behind the hills.At the same time, much nearer, came a solid thud/crunch.Pham spent his next to last midge for a peek around the hillside.He had a glimpse of a skrode, and fronds splayed all about a squashed stalk; there was a flash of light, and the midge was gone.Only two ambushers left.One was Greenstalk.For ten seconds there was no more firing.Yet things were not completely silent.The slumped, glowing metal of his arm popped and sputtered as it cooled.High above, there was the susurrus of air escaping the hull.Fitful breezes whispered around ground level, making it impossible to keep position without constant tweaking at his jets.He paused, letting the current carry him silently out of his little valley.There.A ghostly hiss that was not his own.Another.The two were closing in on him from different directions.They might not know his exact position, but they could obviously coordinate their own.The pain faded in and out, along with consciousness.Short pulses of agony and darkness.He dared not fool with more anesthetic.Pham saw frond tips peeping over a nearby hill.He halted, watched the fronds.Most likely, there was just enough vision area in the tips to sense motion Two seconds passed.Pham's last midge showed the other attacker floating silently in from the side.Any second now, the two would pop up.At that instant, Pham would have given anything for an armed midge.In all his stupid hacking, he'd never gotten around to that.No help for it.He waited for a moment of clear consciousness, long enough to boost over the enemy and shoot.There was a rattle of fronds, loud self announcement.Pham's midge caught sight of Blueshell rolling behind slatted walls a hundred meters away.The Skroderider rushed from protection to protection, but always closer to Greenstalk's position.And the rattling?Was it a pleading?Even after five months with the Riders, Pham had only the vaguest sense of their rattle talk.Greenstalk  the Greenstalk who had always been the shy one, the compulsively honest one  rattled nothing back.She swung her beamer around, raking the slats with fire.The third Rider popped up just far enough to shoot at the slats.His angle would have been just right to fry Blueshell where he stood  except that the movement took him directly in front of Pham Nuwen's gun.Even as Pham fired, he was boosting out of his hole.Now was his only chance.If he could turn, fire back on Greenstalk before she was done with Blueshell  The maneuver was an easy head over heels that should have left him upside down and facing back upon Greenstalk.But nothing was easy for him now, and Pham came around spinning too fast, the landscape dwindling beneath him.But there was Greenstalk all right, swinging her weapon back toward him.And there was Blueshell, racing from between pillars that glowed white in the heat of Greenstalk's fire.His voice was loud in Pham's ear: "I beg, don't kill her.Don't kill  "  Greenstalk hesitated, then turned the weapon back on the advancing Blueshell.Pham triggered his gun, letting his spin drag the beam across the ground.Consciousness ebbed.Aim!Aim right!He furrowed the land below with a glowing, molten arrow, that ended at something dark and slumped.Blueshell's tiny figure was still rolling across the wreckage, trying to reach her.Then Pham had turned too far and could not remember how to change the view.The sky swung slowly past his eyes:  A bluish moon with a sharp shadow 'cross its middle.A ship floating close, with feathery spines, like some giant bug.What in the Qeng Ho where am I?and consciousness fled.There were dreams.He'd lost a captaincy once again, been busted down to tending potted plants in the ship's greenhouse.Sigh.Pham's job was to water them and make them bloom.But then he noticed the pots had wheels and moved behind his back, waiting, softly rattling.What had been beautiful was now sinister.Pham had been willing to water and weed the creatures; he had always admired them.Now he was the only one who knew they were the enemy of life.More than once in his life, Pham Nuwen had wakened inside medical automation.He was almost used to coffin close tanks, plain green walls, wires and tubes.This was different, and it took him a while to realize just where he was.Willowy trees bent close around him, swaying just a little in the warm breeze.He seemed to be lying on the softest moss, in a tiny glade above a pond.Summer haze hung in the air above the water.It was all very nice, except that the leaves were furry, and not quite the green of anything he had ever seen.This was someone else's notion of home.He reached up toward the nearest branch, and his hand hit something unyielding just fifty centimeters above his face.A curved wall.For all the trick pictures, this was about the same size as the surgeons he remembered.Something clicked behind his head; the idyll slid past him, taking its warm breeze with it.Somebody  Ravna  floated just beyond the cylinder."Hi, Pham. "She reached past the surgeon's hull to squeeze his hand.Her kiss was tremulous, and she looked haunted, as if she'd been crying a lot."Hi, yourself," he said.Memory came back in jagged pieces.He tried to push off the bed, and found another similarity between this surgeon and ones of the Qeng Ho: he was securely plugged in.Ravna laughed a little weakly."Surgeon.Disconnect. "After a moment, Pham drifted free."It's still holding my arm. ""No, that's the sling.Your left arm is going to take a while to regrow.It almost got burned off, Pham. ""Oh. "He looked down at the white cocoon that meshed his arm against his side.He remembered the gunfight now and realized that parts of his dream were deadly real."How long have I been out?"The anxiety spilled into his voice."About thirty hours.We're more than sixty light years out from Harmonious Repose.We're doing okay, except that now everyone in creation seems to be chasing us. "The dream.His free hand clamped hard on Ravna's arm."The Skroderiders, where are they?"Not on board, pray the Fleet."W what's left of Greenstalk is in the other surgeon.Blueshell is  "  Why has he let me live?Pham's eyes roved the room.They were in a utility cabin.Any weapons were at least twenty meters away.Hm.More important than guns: get command console privileges with the OOB if it was not already too late.He pushed out of the surgeon and drifted out of the room.Ravna followed."Take it easy, Pham.You just came out of a surgeon. ""What have they said about the shoot out?""Poor Greenstalk's not in a position to say anything, Pham.Blueshell says pretty much what you did: Greenstalk was grabbed by the rogue Riders, forced to lure you two into a trap. ""Hmhm, hmhm," Pham strove for a noncommittal tone.So maybe there was a chance; maybe Blueshell was not yet perverted.He continued his one handed progress up the ship's axis corridor.A minute later he was on the bridge, Ravna tagging behind."Pham.What's the matter?There's a lot we have to decide, but  "  How right you are.He dived onto the command deck, and made for the command console."Ship.Do you recognize my voice?"Ravna began, "Pham, What's this  "  "Yes, sir. ""  all about?""Command privileges," he said.Capabilities granted while the Riders were ashore.Would they still be in place?"Granted. "The Skroderiders had had thirty hours to plan their defense.This was all too easy, too easy."Suspend command privileges for the Skroderiders.Isolate them. ""Yes, sir," came the ship's reply.Liar!But what more could he do?The sweep toward panic crested, and suddenly he felt very cool.He was Qeng Ho   and he was also godshatter.Both Riders were in the same cabin, Greenstalk in the other copy of the ship's surgeon.Pham opened a window on the room.Blueshell sat on a wall beside the surgeon.He looked wilted, as when they heard about Sjandra Kei.He angled his fronds at the video pickup."Sir Pham.The ship tells me you've suspended our privileges?""What is going on, Pham?"Ravna had dug a foot into the floor, and stood glaring at him.Pham ignored both questions."How is Greenstalk doing?"he said.The fronds turned away, seemed to become even more limp."She lives I thank you, Sir Pham.It took great skill to do what you did.Considering everything, I could not have asked for more. "What did I do?He remembered firing on Greenstalk.Had he pulled his aim?He looked inside the surgeon.This was quite different from the human configuration: This one was mostly water filled, with turbulent aeration along the patient's fronds.Asleep (?), Greenstalk looked frailer than he remembered, her fronds waving randomly in the water.Some were nicked, but her body seemed whole.His eyes traveled downwards toward the base of the stalk, where a Rider is normally attached to its skrode.The stump ended in a cloud of surgical tubing.And Pham remembered the last instant of the firefight, blasting the skrode out from under Greenstalk.What is a Rider like without anything to ride?He pulled his eyes away from the wreckage."I've deleted your command privileges because I don't trust you. "My former friend, tool of my enemy.Blueshell didn't answer.After a moment Ravna spoke."Pham.Without Blueshell, I'd never have gotten you out of that habitat.Even then  we were stuck in the middle of the RIP system.The shepherd satellite was screaming for our blood; they had figured out we were human.The Aprahanti were trying to break harbor and come down on us.Without Blueshell, we'd never have convinced local security to let us go ultra  we'd probably have been blown away the second we cleared the ring plane.We'd all be dead now, Pham. ""Don't you know what happened down there?"Some of the indignation left Ravna's face."Yes.But understand about skrodes.They are a mechanical contrivance.It's easy enough to disconnect the cyber part from the mechanical linkages.These guys were controlling the wheels, and aiming the gun. "Hmm.On the window behind Ravna, he could see Blueshell standing with his fronds motionless, not rushing to agree.Triumphant?"That doesn't explain Greenstalk's sucking us in to the trap. "He raised a hand."Yeah, I know, she was bludgeoned into doing it.Only problem, Ravna, she had no hesitation.She was enthusiastic, bubbly. "He stared over the woman's shoulder."She was under no compulsion, didn't you tell me that, Blueshell. "A long pause.Finally, "Yes, Sir Pham. "Ravna turned, drifting back so she could see both of them."But, but   it's still absurd.Greenstalk has been with us from the beginning.A thousand times she could have destroyed the ship  or gotten word to the outside.Why chance this stupid ambush?""Yes.Why didn't they betray us before" Up until she asked the question, Pham had not known.He knew the facts, but had no coherent theory to hang them on.Now it all came together: the ambush, his dreams in the surgeon, even the paradoxes."Maybe she wasn't a traitor, before.We really did escape from Relay without pursuit, without anyone knowing of us, much less our exact destination.Certainly no one expected humans to show up at Harmonious Repose. "He paused, trying to get it all together.The ambush, "The ambush, it wasn't stupid  but it was completely ad hoc.The enemy had no back up.Their weapons were dumb, simple things  " insight " why, I'll bet if you look at the wreckage of Greenstalk's skrode you'll find her beam gun was some sort of cutter tool.And the only sensor on the claymore mine was a motion detector: it had some civil use.All the gadgets were pulled together on very short notice by people who had not been expecting a fight.No, our enemy was very surprised by our appearance. ""You think the Aprahanti could  "  "Not the Aprahanti.From what you said, they didn't break moorage till after the gunfight, when the Rider moon started screaming about us.Whoever's behind this is independent of the Butterflies, and must be spread in very small numbers across many star systems  a vast set of tripwires, listening for things of interest.They noticed us, and weak as their outpost was they tried to grab our ship.Only when we were getting away did they advertise us.One way or another, they didn't want us to get away. "He jerked a hand at the ultratrace window."If I read that right, we've got more than five hundred ships on our tail. "Ravna's eyes flicked to the display and back.Her voice was abstracted, "Yes.That's part of the main Aprahanti fleet and "  "There will be lots more, only they won't all be Butterflies. "" what are you saying then?Why would Skroderiders wish us ill?A conspiracy is senseless.They've never had a nation state, much less an interstellar empire. "Pham nodded."Just peaceful settlements  like that shepherd moon  in polyspecific civilizations all across the Beyond. "His voice softened."No, Rav, the Skroderiders are not the real enemy here it's the thing behind them.The Straumli Perversion. "Incredulous silence, but he noticed how tightly Blueshell held his fronds now.That one knew."It's the only explanation, Ravna.Greenstalk really was our friend, and loyal.My guess is that only a small minority of the Riders are under the Perversion's control.When Greenstalk fell in with them she was converted too. ""T that's impossible!This is the Middle of the Beyond, Pham.Greenstalk had courage, stubbornness.No brainwashing could have changed her so quickly. "A frightened desperation had come into her eyes.One explanation or another, some terrible thing must be true.And I'm still here, alive and talking.A datum for godshatter; maybe there was yet a chance!He spoke almost as the understanding hit him."Greenstalk was loyal, yet she was totally converted in seconds.It wasn't just a perversion of her skrode, or some drug.It was as if both Rider and skrode had been designed from the beginning to respond. "He looked across at Blueshell, trying to gauge his reaction to what he would say next."The Riders have awaited their creator a long time.Their race is very old, far older than anyone except the senescent.They're everywhere, but in small numbers, always practical and peaceful.And somewhere in the beginning  a few billion years ago  their precursors were trapped in an evolutionary cul de sac.Their creator built the first skrodes, and made the first Riders.Now I think we know the who and the why."Yes, yes.I know there have been other upliftings.What's marvelous about this one is how stable it turned out to be.The greater skrodes are 'tradition' Blueshell says, but that's a word I apply to cultures and to much shorter time scales.The greater skrodes of today are identical to ones a billion years ago.And they are devices that can be made anywhere in the Beyond yet the design is clearly High Beyond or Transcendent. "That had been one of his earliest humiliations about the Beyond.He had looked at the design diagram  dissections really  of skrodes.On the outside, the thing was a mechanical device, with moving parts even.And the text claimed that the whole thing would be made with the simplest of factories, scarcely more than what existed in some places in the Slow Zone.And yet the electronics was a seemingly random mass of components, without any trace of hierarchical design or modularity.It worked, and far more efficiently than something designed by human equivalent minds, but repair and debugging  of the cyber component  was out of the question."No one in the Beyond understands all the potentials of skrodes, much less the adaptations forced on their Riders.Isn't that so, Blueshell?"The Rider clapped his fronds hard against his central stalk.Again a furious rattling.It was something Pham had never seen before.Rage?Terror?Blueshell's voder voice was distorted with nonlinearities: "You ask?You ask?It's monstrous to ask me to help you in this  " the voice skeetered into high frequencies and he stood mute, his body shivering.Pham of the Qeng Ho felt a stab of shame.The other knew and understood   and deserved better than this.The Riders must be destroyed, but they should not have to listen to his judging.His hand swept toward the communications cutoff, stopped.No.This is your last chance to observe the Perversion's work.Ravna's glance snapped back and forth between human and Skroderider, and he could tell that she understood.Her face had the same stricken look as when she learned about Sjandra Kei."You're saying the Perversion made the original skrodes. ""And modified the Riders too.It was long ago, and certainly not the same instance of the Perversion that the Straumers created, but"  The "Blight", that was the other common name for the Perversion, and closer to Old One's view.For all the Perversion's transcendence, its life style was more similar to a disease than anything else.Maybe that had helped to fool Old One.But now Pham could see: the Blight lived in pieces, across extraordinary reaches of time.It hid in archives, waiting for ideal conditions.And it had created helpers for its blooming  He looked at Ravna, and suddenly realized a little more."You've had thirty hours to think about this, Rav.You saw the record from my suit.Surely you must have guessed some of this. "Her gaze dropped from his."A little," she finally said.At least she was no longer denying."You know what we have to do," he said softly.Now that he understood what must be done, the godshatter eased its grip.Its will would be done."What is that?"said Ravna, as if she didn't know."Two things: Post this to the Net. ""Who would believe?"The Net of a Million Lies."Enough would.Once they look, most folk will be able to see the truth here and take the proper action. "Ravna shook her head."No," barely audible."The Net must be told, Ravna.We've discovered something that could save a thousand worlds.This is the Blight's hidden edge," at least in the Middle and Low Beyond.She just shook her head again."But screaming this truth would itself kill billions. ""In honest defense!"He bounced slowly toward the ceiling, pushed himself back toward the deck.There were tears in her eyes now."These are exactly the arguments used to kill m my family, my worlds A and I will not be part of it. ""But the claims are true this time!""I've had enough of pogroms, Pham. "Gentle toughness and almost unbelievable."You would make this decision yourself, Rav?We know something that others  leaders wiser than either of us  should be free to decide upon.You would keep them from making that choice?"She hesitated, and for an instant Pham thought the civilized rule follower in her would bring her around.But then her chin came up, "Yes, Pham.I would deny them the choice. "He made a noncommittal noise and drifted back toward the command console.No point in talking to her about what else must be done."And Pham, we will not kill Blueshell and Greenstalk. ""There's no choice, Rav. "His hands played with the touch controls."Greenstalk was perverted; we have no idea how much of that survived the destruction of her skrode, or how long it will be before Blueshell goes bad.We can't take them along, or let them go free. "Ravna drifted sideways, her eyes fixed on his hands."B Be careful who you kill, Pham," she said softly."As you say, I've had thirty hours to think about my decisions, thirty hours to think about yours. ""So. "Pham raised his hands from the controls.Rage (godshatter?)chased briefly through this mind.Ravna, Ravna, Ravna, a voice saying goodbye inside his head.Then all became very cold.He had been so afraid that the Riders had perverted the ship.Instead, this stupid fool had acted for them, voluntarily.He drifted slowly toward her.Almost unthinking, he held his arm and hand at combat ready."How do you intend to prevent me from doing what has to be done?"But he already guessed.She didn't back away, even when his hand was centimeters from her throat.Her face held courage and tears."W what do you think, Pham?While you were in the surgeon I rearranged things.Hurt me, and you will be hurt worse. "Her eyes swept the walls behind him."Kill the Riders, and and you will die. "They stared at each other for a long moment, measuring.Maybe there weren't weapons buried in the walls.He probably could kill her before she could defend.But then there were a thousand ways the ship could have been programmed to kill him.And all that would be left would be the Riders flying down to the Bottom, to their prize."So what do we do, then?"He finally said."As b before, we go to rescue Jefri.We go to recover the Countermeasure.I'm willing to put some restrictions on the Riders. "A truce with monsters, mediated by a fool.He pushed off and sailed around her, back down the axis corridor.Behind him, he heard a sob.They stayed well clear of each other the next few days.Pham was allowed shallow access to ship controls.He found suicide programs threaded through the application layers.But a strange thing, and reason for chagrin if he had been capable of it: The changes dated from hours after his confrontation with Ravna.She'd had nothing when she stood against him.Thank the Powers, I didn't know.The thought was forgotten almost before he formed it.So.The charade would proceed right to the end, a continuing game of lie and subterfuge.Grimly, he set himself to winning that game.Fleets behind them, traitors surrounding him.By the Qeng Ho and his own godshatter, the Perversion would lose.The Skroderiders would lose.And for all her courage and goodness, Ravna Bergsndot would lose.Tyrathect was losing the battle within herself.Oh, it wasn't near ended; better perhaps to say that the tide had turned.In the beginning there had been little triumphs, as when she let Amdijefri play alone with the commset without even the children guessing she was responsible.But such were many tendays past, and now Some days she would be entirely in control of herself.Others  and these often seemed the happiest  would begin with her seeming in control.It was not yet clear the sort of day today would be.Tyrathect paced along the hoardings that topped the new castle's walls.The place was certainly new, but hardly yet a castle.Steel had built in panicky haste.The south and west walls were very thick, with embedded tunnels.But there were spots on the north side that were simply palisades backed by stony rubble.Nothing more could be done in the time that Steel had been given.She stopped for a moment, smelling fresh sawn timber.The view down Starship Hill was as beautiful as she had ever seen it.The days were getting longer.Now there was only twilight between the setting and the rising of the sun.The local snow had retreated to its summer patches, leaving heather to turn green in the warmth.From here she could see miles, to where bluish sea haze clamped down on the offshore islands.By the conventional wisdom, it would be suicide to attack the new castle  even in its present ramshackle state  with less than a horde.Tyrathect smiled bitterly to herself.Of course, Woodcarver would ignore that wisdom.Old Woodcarver thought she had a secret weapon that would breach these walls from hundreds of feet away.Even now Steel's spies were reporting that the Woodcarvers had taken the bait, that their small army and their crude cannon had begun the overland trek up the coast.She descended the wall stairs to the yard.She heard faint thunder.Somewhere north of Streamsdell, Steel's own cannoneers were beginning their morning practice.When the air was just right, you could hear it.There was to be no testing near the farmlands, and none but high Servants and isolated workers knew of the weapons.But by now Steel had thirty of the devices and gunpowder to match.The greatest lack was gunners.Up close the noise of firing was hellish.Sustained firing could deafen.Ah, but the weapons themselves: They had a range of almost eight miles, three times as great as Woodcarver's.They could deliver gunpowder "bombs" that exploded on impact.There were places beyond the northern hills where the forest was gouged bare and slumping landslides showed naked rock  all from sustained barrages of gunfire.And soon  perhaps today  the Flenserists would have radio, too.God damn you, Woodcarver!Of course Tyrathect had never met the Woodcarver, but Flenser had known that pack well: Flenser was mostly Woodcarver's offspring.The "Gentle Woodcarver" had borne him and raised him to power.It had been Woodcarver who taught him about freedom of thought and experiment.Woodcarver should have known the pride that lived in Flenser, should have known that he would go to extremes his parent never dared.And when the new one's monstrous nature became clear, when his first "experiments" were discovered, Woodcarver should have had him killed  or at the very least, fragmented.Instead, Flenser had been allowed to take exile to create things like Steel, and they to create their own monsters, ultimately to build this hierarchy of madness.And now, a century overdue, Woodcarver was coming to correct her mistake.She came with her toy guns, as overconfident and idealistic as ever.She came into a trap of steel and fire that none of her people would survive.If only there were some way to warn the Woodcarver.Tyrathect's only reason for being here was the oath she had sworn herself to bring Flenser's Movement down.If Woodcarver knew what awaited her here, if she even knew of the traitors in her own camp there might be a chance.Last fall, Tyrathect had come close to sending an anonymous message south.There were traders who visited through both kingdoms.Her Flenser memories told her which were likely independent.She almost passed one a note, a single piece of silkpaper, reporting the starship's landing and Jefri's survival.In that she had missed death by less than a day: Steel had shown her a report from the South, about the other human and Woodcarver's progress with the "dataset".There were things in the report that could only be known by someone at the top at Woodcarver's.Who?She didn't ask, but she guessed it was Vendacious; the Flenser in Tyrathect remembered that sibling pack well.They'd had dealings.Vendacious had none of the raw genius of their joint parent, but there was a broad streak of opportunism in him.Steel had shown her the report only to puff himself up, to prove to Tyrathect that he had succeeded in something that Flenser had never attempted.And it was a coup.Tyrathect had complimented Steel with more than usual sincerity and quietly shelved her plans of warning.With a spy at the top at Woodcarver's, any message would be pointless suicide.Now Tyrathect padded across the castle's outer yard.There was still plenty of construction going on, but the teams were smaller.Steel was building timber lodges all over the yard.Many were empty shells.Steel hoped to persuade Ravna to land at a special spot near the inner keep.The inner keep.That was the only thing about this castle built to the standards of Hidden Island.It was a beautiful structure.It could really be what Steel told Amdijefri: a shrine to honor Jefri's ship and protect it from Woodcarver attack.The central dome was a smooth sweep of cantilevers and fitted stone as wide as the main meeting hall on Hidden Island.Tyrathect watched it with one pair of eyes as she trotted round it.Steel intended to face the dome with the finest pink marble.It would be visible for dozens of miles into the sky.The deadfalls built into its structure were the centerpiece of Steel's plan, even if the rescuers didn't land in his other trap.Shreck and two other high Servants stood on the steps of the castle's meeting hall.They came to attention as she approached.The three backed quickly away, bellies scraping stone but not as quickly as last fall.They knew that the other Flenser Fragments had been destroyed.As Tyrathect swept past them, she almost smiled.For all her weakness and all her problems, she knew she could best these ones.Steel was already inside, alone.The most important meetings were all like this, just Steel and herself.She understood the relationship.In the beginning, Steel had been simply terrified of her  the one person he believed he could never kill.For tendays, he had teetered between grovelling before her and dismembering her.It was amusing to see the bonds Flenser had installed years before still having force.Then had come word of the death of the other Fragments.Tyrathect was no longer Flenser in Waiting.She had half expected death to come then.But in a way this made her safer.Now Steel was less afraid, and his need for intimate advice could be satisfied in ways he saw less threatening.She was his bottled demon: Flenser wisdom without the Flenser threat.This afternoon he seemed almost relaxed, nodding casually to Tyrathect as she entered.She nodded back.In many ways Steel was her  Flenser's  finest creation.So much effort had been spent honing Steel.How many packs worth of members had been sacrificed to get just the combination that was Steel.She  Flenser  had wanted brilliance, ruthlessness.As Tyrathect she could see the truth.With all the flensing, Flenser had created a poor, sad thing.It was strange, but sometimes Steel seemed like Flenser's most pitiable victim."Ready for the big test?"Tyrathect said.At long last, the radios seemed complete."In a moment.I wanted to ask you about timing.My sources tell me Woodcarver's army is on its way.If they make reasonable progress, they should be here in five tendays. ""That's at least three tendays before Ravna's ship arrives. ""Quite.We will have your old enemy disposed of long before we go for the high stakes.But something is strange about the Two Legs' recent messages.How much do you think they suspect?Is it possible that Amdijefri are telling them more than we know?"It was an uncertainty Steel would have masked back when she had been Flenser in Waiting.Tyrathect slid to a seated position before replying."You might know the answer if you had bothered to learn more of the Two Legs' language, dear Steel, or let me learn more. "Through the winter, Tyrathect had been desperate to talk to the children alone, to get warning to the ship.She was of two minds about that now.Amdijefri were so transparent, so innocent.If they glimpsed anything of Steel's treachery, they couldn't hide it.And what might the rescuers do if they knew Steel's villainy?Tyrathect had seen one starship in flight.Just its landing could be a terrible weapon.Besides If Steel's plan succeeds, I won't need the aliens' goodwill.Aloud, Tyrathect continued, "As long as you can continue your magnificent performance, you have nothing to fear from the child.Can't you see that he loves you?"For an instant, Steel seemed pleased, and then the suspicion returned."I don't know.Amdi seems always to taunt me, as though he sees through my act. "Poor Steel.Amdiranifani was his greatest success, and he would never understand it.In this one thing Steel had truly exceeded his Master, had discovered and honed a technique that had once been Woodcarver's.The Fragment eyed his former student almost hungrily.If only he could do him all over again; there must be a way to combine the fear and the flensing with love and affection.The resulting tool would truly merit the name Steel.Tyrathect shrugged, "Take my word for it.If you can continue your kindness act, both children will be faithful.As for the rest of your question: I have noticed some change in Ravna's messages.She seems much more confident of their arrival time, yet something has gone wrong for them.I don't think they're any more suspicious than before; they seemed to accept that Jefri was responsible for Amdi's idea about the radios.That lie was a good move, by the way.It played to their sense of superiority.On a fair battlefield, we are probably their betters  and they must not guess that. ""But what are they suddenly so tense about?"The Fragment shrugged."Patience, dear Steel.Patience and observation.Perhaps Amdijefri have noticed this too.You might subtly inspire them to ask about it.My guess is the Two Legs have their own politics to worry about. "He stopped and turned all his heads on Steel."Could you have your 'source' down at Woodcarver's ferret about with the question?""Perhaps I will.That Dataset is Woodcarver's one great advantage. "Steel sat in silence for a moment, nervously chewing at his lips.Abruptly, he shook himself all over, as if to drive off the manifold threats he saw encroaching."Shreck!"There was the sound of paws.The hatch creaked open and Shreck stuck a head inside."Sir?""Bring the radio outfits in here.Then ask Amdijefri if he can come down to talk to us. "The radios were beautiful things.Ravna claimed that the basic device could be invented by civilizations scarcely more advanced than Flenser's.That was hard to believe.There were so many steps in the making, so many meaningless detours.The final results: eight one yard squares of night darkness.Glints of gold and silver showed in the strange material.That, at least, was no mystery: a part of Flenser's gold and silver had gone into the construction.Amdijefri arrived.They raced around the central floor, poked at the radios, shouted to Steel and the Flenser Fragment.Sometimes it was hard to believe they were not truly one pack, that the Two Legs was not another member: They clung to each other as a single pack might.As often as not, Amdi answered questions about Two Legs before Jefri had a chance to speak, using the "I pack" pronoun to identify both of them.Today, however, there seemed to be a disagreement."Oh, please my lord, let me be the one to try it!"Jefri rattled off something in Samnorsk.When Amdi didn't translate, he repeated the words more slowly, speaking directly to Steel."No.It is [something something] dangerous.Amdi is [something] small.And also, time [something] narrow. "The Fragment strained for the meaning.Damn.Sooner or later their ignorance of the Two Legs' language was going to cost them.Steel listened to the human, then sighed the most marvelously patient sigh."Please.Amdi.Jefri.What is problem?"He spoke in Samnorsk, making more sense to the Flenser Fragment than the human child had.Amdi dithered for a moment."Jefri thinks the radio jackets are too big for me.But look, it doesn't fit so badly!"Amdi jumped all around one of the night dark squares, dragging it heedlessly off its velvet pallet onto the floor.He pulled the fabric over the back and shoulders of his largest member.Now the radio was roughly the shape of a greatcloak; Steel's tailors had added clasps at the shoulders and gut.But the thing was vastly outsized for little Amdi.It stood like a tent around one of him."See?See?"The tiny head poked out, looking first at Steel and then at Tyrathect, willing their belief.Jefri said something.The Amdi pack squeaked back angrily.Then, "Jefri worries about everything, but somebody has to test the radios.There's this little problem with speed.Radio goes much faster than sound.Jefri's just afraid it's so fast, it might confuse the pack using it.That's foolish.How much faster could it be than heads together thought?"He asked it as a question.Tyrathect smiled.The pack of puppies couldn't quite lie, but he guessed that Amdi knew the answer to his question  and that it did not support his argument.On the other side of the hall, Steel listened with heads cocked  the picture of benign tolerance."I'm sorry, Amdi.It's just too dangerous for you to be the first. ""But I am brave!And I want to help. ""I'm sorry.After we know it's safe  "  Amdi gave a shriek of outrage, much higher than normal interpack talk, almost in the range of thought.He swarmed around Jefri, whacking at the human's legs with his butt ends."Hideous traitor!"he cried, and continued the insults in Samnorsk.It took about ten minutes to get him calmed down to a sulk.He and Jefri sat on the floor, grumbling at each other in Samnorsk.Tyrathect watched the two, and Steel on the other side of the room.If irony were something that made sound, they would all be deaf by now.All their lives, Flenser and Steel had experimented on others  usually unto death.Now they had a victim who literally begged to be victimized and he must be rejected.There was no question about the rejection.Even if Jefri had not raised objections, the Amdi pack was too valuable to be risked.Furthermore, Amdi was an eightsome.It was a miracle that such a large pack could function at all.Whatever dangers there were with radio would be much greater for him.So, a proper victim would be found.A proper wretch.Surely there were plenty of those in the dungeons beneath Hidden Island.Tyrathect thought back on all the packs she remembered killing.How she hated Flenser, his calculating cruelty.I am so much worse than Steel.I made Steel.She remembered where her thoughts had been the last hour.This was one of the bad days, one of the days when Flenser sneaked out from the recesses of her mind, when she rode the power of his reason higher and higher, till it became rationalization and she became him.Still, for a few more seconds she might be in control.What could she do with it?A soul that was strong enough might deny itself, might become a different person might at the very least end itself."I I will try the radio. "The words were spoken almost before he thought them.Weak, silly frill."What?"said Steel.But the words had been clear, and Steel had heard.The Flenser Fragment smiled dryly."I want to see what this radio can do.Let me try it, dear Steel. "They took the radios out into the yard, on the side of the starship that was hidden from general view.Here it would just be Amdijefri, Steel, and whoever I am at the moment.The Flenser Fragment laughed at the upwelling fear.Discipline, she had thought!Perhaps that was best.He stood in the middle of the yard and let the human help him with the radio gear.Strange to see another intelligent being so close, and towering over him.Jefri's incredibly articulate paws arranged the jackets loosely on his backs.The inside material was soft, deadening.And unlike normal clothing, the radios covered the wearer's tympana.The boy tried to explain what he was doing."See?This thing," he pulled at the corner of the greatcloak, "goes over your head.The inside has [something] that makes sound into radio. "The Fragment shrugged away as the boy tried to pull the cover forward."No.I can't think. "Only by standing just so, all members facing inward, could the Fragment maintain full consciousness.Already the weaker parts of him were edging toward isolation panic.The conscience that was Tyrathect would learn something today."Oh.I'm sorry. "Jefri turned and spoke to Amdi, something about using the old design.Amdi was heads together, just thirty feet away.He had been all frowns, sullen at being denied, nervous to be apart from the Two Legs.But as the preparations continued, the frowns eased.The puppies' eyes grew wide with happy fascination.The Fragment felt a wave of affection for the puppies that came and went almost too fast to be noticed.Now Amdi edged nearer, taking advantage of the fact that the cloaks muffled much of the Fragment's thought sounds."Jefri says maybe we shouldn't have tried to make the mind size radio," he said."But this will be so much better.I know it!And," he said with transparent slyness, "you could still let me test it instead. ""No, Amdi.This is the way it must be. "Steel's voice was all soft sympathy.Only the Flenser Fragment could see the broad grin on a couple of the lord's members."Well, okay. "The puppies crept a little nearer."Don't be afraid, Lord Tyrathect.We've had the radios in sunlight for some time.They should have lots of power.To make them work you just pull all the belts tight, even the ones at your neck. ""All of them at once?"Amdi fidgeted."That's probably best.Otherwise, there will be such a mismatch of speeds that  " He said something to the Two Legs.Jefri leaned close."This belt goes here, and this here. "He pointed to the braid bone straps that drew the head covering close."Then just pull this with your mouth. ""The harder you pull, the louder the radio," Amdi added."Okay. "The Fragment drew himself together.He shrugged the jackets into place, tightening the shoulder and gut belts.Deadly muffling.The jackets almost seemed to mold themselves to his tympana.He looked at himself, and grasped desperately for what was left of consciousness.The jackets were beautiful, magic darkness yet with a hint of the golden silver of a Flenserist Lord.Beautiful instruments of torture.Even Steel had not imagined such twisted revenge.Had he?The Fragment grabbed the head straps and pulled.Twenty years ago, when Tyrathect was new, she had loved to hike with her fission parent on the grassy dunes along Lake Kitcherri.That was before their great falling out, before loneliness drove Tyrathect to the Republic's Capital and her search for "meaning".Not all of the shore of Lake Kitcherri was beaches and dunes.Farther south there was the Rockness, where streams cut through stone to the water.Sometimes, especially when she and her parent had fought, Tyrathect would walk up from the shore along streams bordered by sheer, smooth cliffs.It was a sort of punishment: there were places where the stone had a glassy haze and didn't absorb sound at all.Everything was echoed, right up to the top of thought.It was if she were surrounded by copies of herself, and copies beyond them, all thinking the same sounds but out of step.Of course echoes are often a problem with unquilted stone walls, especially if the size and geometry are wrong.But these cliffs were perfect reflectors, a quarrier's nightmare.And there were places where the shape of the Rockness conspired with the sounds When Tyrathect walked there, she couldn't tell her own thoughts from the echoes.Everything was garbled with barely offset resonance.At first it had been a great pain that sent her running.But she forced herself back again and again, and finally learned to think even in the worst of the narrows.Amdijefri's radio was just a little like the Kitcherri cliffs.Enough to save me, maybe.Tyrathect came to consciousness all piled in a heap.At most seconds had passed since she brought the radios to life; Amdi and Steel were simply staring at her.The human was rocking one of her bodies, talking to her.Tyrathect licked the boy's paw, then stood partly up.She heard only her own thoughts but they had some of the jarring difference of the stone echoes.She was back on her bellies again.Part of her was vomiting in the dirt.The world shimmered, out of tune.Thought is there.Grab it!Grab it!All a matter of coordination, of timing.She remembered Amdijefri talking about how fast the radio was.In a way, this was the reverse of the problem of the screaming cliffs.She shook her heads, mastering the weirdness."Give me a moment," she said, and her voice was almost calm.She looked around.Slowly.If she concentrated and didn't move fast, she could think.Suddenly she was aware of the greatcloaks, pressing in on all her tympana.She should have been deafened, isolated.Yet her thoughts were no muzzier than after a bad sleep.She got to her feet again and walked slowly around the open space between Amdi and Steel."Can you hear me?"she asked."Yes," said Steel.He edged nervously away from her.Of course.The cloaks muffled sound like any heavy quilt: anything in the range of thought would be totally absorbed.But interpack speech and Samnorsk were low pitched sound  they would scarcely be affected.She stopped, holding all her breath.She could hear birds and the sounds of timber being sawn somewhere on the far side of the inner yard.Yet Steel was only thirty feet from her.His thought noise should have been a loud intrusion, even confusing.She strained to hear There was nothing but her own thoughts and a stickety buzzing noise that seemed to come from all directions."And we thought this would just give us control in battle," she said, wonderingly.All of her turned and walked toward Amdi.He was twenty feet away, ten feet.Still no thought noise.Amdi's eyes were wide.The puppies held their ground; in fact all eight of him seemed to lean toward her."You knew about this all along, didn't you?"Tyrathect said."I hoped.Oh, I hoped. "He stepped closer.Five feet.The eight of him looked at the five of her from a distance of inches.He extended a nose, brushing muzzles with Tyrathect.His thought sounds came only faintly through the cloak, no louder than if he were fifty feet away.For a moment they looked at each other in stark astonishment.Nose to nose, and they both could still think!Amdi gave a whoop of glee and bounded in among Tyrathect, rubbing back and forth across her legs."See, Jefri," he shouted in Samnorsk."It works.It works!"Tyrathect wobbled under the assault, almost lost hold of her thoughts.What had just happened In all the history of the world there had never been such a thing.If thinking packs could work paw by jowl There were consequences and consequences, and she got dizzy all over again.Steel moved a little closer and suffered a flying hug from Jefri Olsndot.Steel was trying his best to join the celebration, but he wasn't quite sure what had happened.He hadn't lived the consequences like Tyrathect."Wonderful progress for the first try," he said."But it must be painful even so. "Two of him looked sharply at her."We should get that gear off you, and give you a rest. ""No!"Tyrathect and Amdi said almost together.She smiled back at Steel."We haven't really tested it yet, have we?The whole purpose was long distance communications. "We thought that was the purpose, anyway.In fact, even if it had no better range than talk sounds, it was already a towering success in Tyrathect's mind."Oh. "Steel smiled weakly at Amdi and glared hidden faces at Tyrathect.Jefri was still hanging on two of his necks.Steel was a picture of barely concealed anguish."Well, go slowly then.We don't know what might happen if you run out of range. "Tyrathect disentangled two of herself from Amdi and stepped a few feet away.Thought was as clear  and as potentially confusing  as before.By now she was beginning to get the feel of it though.She had very little trouble keeping her balance.She walked the two another thirty feet, about the maximum range a pack could coordinate in the quietest conditions."It's like I'm still heads together," she said wonderingly.Ordinarily at thirty feet, thoughts were faint and the time lag so bad that coordination was difficult."How far can I go?"She murmured the question to Amdi.He made a human giggling sound and slid a head close to hers."I'm not sure.It should be good at least to the outer walls. ""Well," she said in a normal voice, for Steel, "let's see if I can spread a little bit further. "The two of her walked another ten yards.She was more than sixty feet across!Steel was wide eyed."And now?"Tyrathect laughed."My thought's as crisp as before. "She turned her two and walked away."Wait!"roared Steel, bounding to his feet."That's far  " then he remembered his audience, and his fury became more a frightened concern for her welfare."That's far too dangerous for the first experiment.Come back!"From where she sat with Amdi, Tyrathect smiled brightly."But Steel, I never left," she said in Samnorsk.Amdijefri laughed and laughed.She was one hundred fifty feet across.Her two broke into a careful trot  and she watched Steel swallow back foam.Her thought still had the sharp, abrupt quality of closer than heads together.How fast is this radio thing?She passed close by Shreck and the guards posted at the edge of the field."Hey, hey, Shreck!What do you say?"one of her said at his stupefied faces.Back with Amdi and the rest of her, Steel was shouting at Shreck, telling him to follow her.Her trot became an easy run.She split, one going north of the inner yard, the other south.Shreck and company followed, clumsy with shock.The dome of the inner keep was between her, a sweeping hulk of stone.Her radio thoughts faded into the stickety buzzing."Can't think," she mumbled to Amdi."Pull on the mouth straps.Make your thoughts louder. "Tyrathect pulled, and the buzzing faded.She regained her balance and raced around the starship.One of her was in a construction area now.Artisans looked up in shock.A loose member usually meant a fatal accident or a pack run amok.In either case the singleton must be restrained.But Tyrathect's member was wearing a greatcloak that sparkled here and there of gold.And behind her, Shreck and his guards were shouting for everyone to stand back.She turned a head to Steel, and her voice was joy."I soar!"She ran through the cowering workers, ran toward the south and the west walls.She was everywhere, spreading and spreading.These seconds would make memories that would outlast her soul, that would be legends in the minds of her descendants a thousand years from now.Steel hunkered down.Things were totally out of his control now; Shreck's people were all on the far side of inner keep.All that he and Amdijefri could know came from Tyrathect  and the clamor of alarums.Amdi bounced around her."Where are you now?Where?""Almost to the outer wall. ""Don't go beyond that," Steel said quietly.Tyrathect scarcely heard.For a few more seconds she would drink this glorious power.She charged up the inside stairs.Guards scuttled back, some members jumping back into the yard.Shreck still followed, shouting for her safety.One of her reached the parapet, then the other.She gasped."Are you all right?"said Amdi."I  " Tyrathect looked about her.From her places on the south wall she could see herselves back in the castle yard: a tiny clump of gold and black that was her three and Amdi.Beyond the northeast walls stretched forest and valleys, the trails up into the Icefang mountains.To the west was Hidden Island and the misty inner waters.These were things she had seen a thousand times as Flenser.How he had loved them, his domain.But now she was seeing as if in a dream.Her eyes were so far apart.Her pack was almost as wide as the castle itself.The parallax view made Hidden Island seem just a few paces away.Newcastle was like a model spread out around her.Almighty Pack of packs  this was God's view.Shreck's troopers were edging closer.He had sent a couple of packs back to get directions."A couple of minutes.I'll come down in a couple of minutes. "She spoke the words to the troopers on the palisade and to Steel back in the yard.Then she turned to survey her domain.She had only extended two of herself across less than a quarter of a mile.But there was no perceptible time lag; coordination had the same abrupt feel it did when she was all together.And there was plenty more pull in the braid bone straps.What if all five of her spread out, moved miles apart?All of the northland would be her private room.And Flenser?Ah, Flenser.Where was he?The memories were still there, but Tyrathect remembered the loss of consciousness right when the radios began working.It took a special skill of coordination to think in the face of such terrible speed.Perhaps Lord Flenser had never walked between close cliffs when he was new.Tyrathect smiled.Perhaps only her mindset could hold when using the radios.In that case Tyrathect looked again across the landscape.Flenser had made a great empire.If these new developments were managed properly, then the coming victories could make it infinitely grander.He turned to Shreck's troopers."Very well, I'm ready to return to Lord Steel. "It was high summer when Woodcarver's army left for the north.The preparations had been frantic, with Vendacious driving himself and everyone else to the point of exhaustion.There had been cannons to make  Scrupilo cast seventy tubes before getting thirty that would fire reliably.There had been cannoneers to train  and safe methods of firing to discover.There had been wagons to build and kherhogs to buy.Surely word of the preparations had long ago filtered north.Woodcarvers was a port city; they could not close down the commerce that moved through it.Vendacious warned them of this in more than one inner council meeting: Steel knew they were coming.The trick was in keeping the Flenserists uncertain as to numbers and timing and exact purpose."We have one great advantage over the enemy," he said."We have agents in his highest councils.We know what he knows of us. "They couldn't disguise the obvious from the spies, but the details were a different matter.The army departed along inland routes, a dozen wagons here, a few squads there.In all there were a thousand packs in the expedition, but they would never be together till they reached deep forest.It would have been easier to take the first part of the trip by sea, but the Flenserists had spotters hidden high in the fjordlands.Any ship movement  even deep in Woodcarver territory  would be known in the north.So they traveled on forest paths, through areas that Vendacious had cleared of enemy agents.At first the going was very easy, at least for those with the wagons.Johanna rode in one of the rear ones with Woodcarver and Dataset.Even I'm beginning to treat the thing like an oracle, thought Johanna.Too bad it couldn't really predict the future.The weather was as beautiful as Johanna had ever seen it on Tines world, an endless afternoon.It was strange that such unending fairness should make her so nervous, but she couldn't help it.This was so much like her first time on this world, when everything had gone wrong.During the first dayarounds of the journey, while they were still in home territory, Woodcarver pointed out every peak that came into view and tried to translate its name into Samnorsk for her.After six hundred years the Queen knew her land well.Even the patches of snow  the ones that lasted all through the summer  were known to her.She showed Johanna a sketchbook she had brought along.Each page was from a different year, and showed her special snowpatches as they had appeared on the same day of the summer.Riffling through the leaves, it was almost like a crude piece of animation.Johanna could see the patches moving, growing over a period of decades, then retreating."Most packs don't live long enough to feel it," said Woodcarver, "but to me, the patches that last all summer are like living things.See how they move?They are like wolves, held off from our lands by our fire that is the sun.They circle about, grow.Sometimes they link together and a new glacier starts toward the sea. "Johanna had laughed a little nervously."Are they winning?""For the last four centuries, no.The summers have often been hot and windy.In the long run?I don't know.And it doesn't matter quite so much to me anymore. "She rocked her two little puppies for a moment and laughed gently."Peregrine's little ones are not even thinking yet, and I'm already losing my long view!"Johanna reached out to stroke her neck."But they are your puppies too. ""I know.Most of my pups have been with other packs, but these are the first that I have kept to be me. "Her blind one nuzzled at one of the puppies.It wriggled and made a sound that warbled at the top of Johanna's hearing.Johanna held the other on her lap.Tine pups looked more like baby sea'mals than dogs.Their necks were so long compared to their bodies.And they seemed to develop much more slowly than the puppy she and Jefri had raised.Even now they seemed to have trouble focusing.She moved her fingers slowly back and forth in front of one puppy's head; its efforts to track were comical.And after sixty days, Woodcarver's pups couldn't really walk.The Queen wore two special jackets with carrying pouches on the sides.Most of the waking day, her little ones stayed there, suckling through the fur on her tummy.In some ways, Woodcarver treated her offspring as a human would.She was very nervous when they were taken from her sight.She liked to cuddle them and play little games of coordination with them.Often she would lay both of them on their backs and pat their paws in a sequence of eight, then abruptly tap the one or the other on the belly.The two wriggled furiously at the attack, their little legs waving in all directions."I nibble the one whose paw was last touched.Peregrine is worthy of me.These two are already thinking a little.See?"She pointed to the puppy that had convulsed into a ball, avoiding most of her surprise tickle.In other ways Tinish parenting was alien, almost scary.Neither Woodcarver nor Peregrine ever talked to their pups in audible tones, but their ultrasonic "thoughts" seemed to be constantly probing the little ones.Some of it was so simple and regular that it set sympathetic vibrations through the walls of the little wagon.The wood buzzed under Johanna's hands.It was like a mother humming a lullaby, but she could see it had another purpose.The little creatures responded to the sounds, twitching in complicated rhythms.Peregrine said it would be another thirty days before the pups could contribute conscious thought to the pack, but they were already being trained and exercised for the function.They camped part of each dayaround, the troops standing turns as sentry lines.Even during the traveling part of the day, they stopped numerous times, to clear the trail, or await the return of scouts, or simply to rest.At one such stop, Johanna sat with Peregrine in the shade of a tree that looked like pine but smelled of honey.Pilgrim played with his young ones, helping them to stand up and walk a few steps.She could tell by the buzzing in her head that he was thinking at the pups.And suddenly they seemed more like marionettes than children to her."Why don't you let them play by themselves, or with their  " Brothers?Sisters?What do you call siblings born to the other pack? "with Woodcarver's pups?"Even more than Woodcarver, the pilgrim had tried to learn human customs.He was by far the most flexible pack she knew after all, if you can accommodate a murderer in your own mind, you must be flexible.But Pilgrim was visibly startled by her question.The buzzing in her head stopped abruptly.He laughed weakly.It was a very human laugh, though a bit theatrical.Peregrine had spent hours at interactive comedy on Dataset  whether for entertainment or insight, she didn't know."Play?By themselves?Yes I see how natural that would seem to you.To us, it would be a kind of perversion No, worse than that, since perversions are at least fun for some people some of the time.But if a pup were raised a singleton, or even a duo  it would be making an animal of what could be sturdy member. ""You mean that pups never have life of their own?"Peregrine cocked his heads and scrunched close to the ground.One of him continued to nose around the puppies, but Johanna had his attention.He loved to puzzle over human exotica."Well, sometimes there is a tragedy  an orphan pup left to itself.Often there is no cure for it; the creature becomes too independent to meld with any pack.In any case, it is a very lonely, empty life.I have personal memories of just how unpleasant. ""You're missing a lot.I know you've watched children's stories on Dataset.It's sad you can never be young and foolish. ""Hei!I never said that.I've been young and foolish lots; it's my way of life.And most packs are that way when they have several young members by different parents. "As they talked, one of Peregrine's pups had struggled to the edge of the blanket they sat on.Now it awkwardly extended its neck into the flowers that grew from the roots of a nearby tree.As it scruffed around in the green and purple, Johanna felt the buzzing begin again.The pup's movement became a tad more organized."Wow!I can smell the flowers with him.I bet we'll be seeing through each other's eyes well before we get to Flenser's Hidden Island. "The pup backed up, and the two did a little dance on the blanket.Peregrine's heads bobbed in time with the movement."They are such bright little ones!"He grinned."Oh, we are not so different from you, Johanna.I know humans are proud of their young ones.Both Woodcarver and I wonder what ours will become.She is so brilliant, and I am  well, a bit mad.Will these two make me a scientific genius?Will Woodcarver's turn her into an adventurer?Heh, heh.Woodcarver's a great brood kenner, but even she's not sure what our new souls will be like.Oh, I can't wait to be six again!"It had taken Scriber and Pilgrim and Johanna only three days to sail from Flenser's Domain to the harbor at Woodcarver's.It would take this army almost thirty days to walk back to where Johanna's adventure began.On the map it had looked a tortuous path, wiggling this way and that through the fjordland.Yet the first ten days were amazingly easy.The weather stayed dry and warm.It was like the day of the ambush stretched out forever and ever.A dry winds summer, Woodcarver called it.There should be occasional storms, at least cloudiness.Instead the sun circled endlessly above the forest canopy, and when they broke into the open (never for long, and then only when Vendacious was sure that it was safe), the sky was clear and almost cloudless.In fact, there was already uneasiness about the weather.At noon it could get downright hot.The wind was constant, drying.The forest itself was drying out; they must be careful with fire.And with the sun always up and no clouds, they might be seen by lookouts many kilometers away.Scrupilo was especially bothered.He hadn't expected to fire the cannons en route, but he had wanted to drill "his" troops more in the open.Officially Strupilo was a council member and the Queen's chief engineer.Since his experiment with the cannon, he had insisted on the title "Commander of Cannoneers".To Johanna, the engineer had always seemed curt and impatient.His members were almost always moving, and with jerky abruptness.He spent almost as much time with the Dataset as the Queen or Peregrine Wickwrackscar, yet he had very little interest in people oriented subjects."He has a blindness for all but machines," Woodcarver once said of him, "but that's how I made him.He's invented much, even before you came. "Scrupilo had fallen in love with the cannons.For most packs, firing the things was a painful experience.Since that first test, Scrupilo had fired the things again and again, trying to improve the tubes, the powder, and the explosive rounds.His fur was scored with dozens of powder burns.He claimed that nearby gun thunder cleared the mind  but most everybody else agreed it made you daft.During rest stops Scrup was a familiar figure, strutting up and down the line, haranguing his cannoneers.He claimed even the shortest stop was an opportunity for training, since in real combat speed would be essential.He had designed special epaulets, based on Nyjoran gunners' ear muffs.They didn't cover his low sound ears at all, but instead the forehead and shoulder tympana of his trigger member.Actually tying the muffs down was a mind numbing thing to do, but for the moments right around firing it was worth it.Scrupilo wore his own muffs all the time, but unsnugged.They looked like silly little wings sticking out from his head and shoulders.He obviously thought the effect was raffish  and in fact, his gunner crews also made a big thing of wearing the gear at all times.After a while, even Johanna could see that the drill was paying off.At least, they could swing the gun tubes around at an instant's notice, stuff them with fake powder and ball, and shout the Tinish equivalent of "BANG!".The army carried much more gunpowder than food.The packs were to live off the forest.Johanna had little experience with camping in an atmosphere.Were forests usually this rich?It was certainly nothing like the urban forests of Straum, where you needed a special license to walk off marked paths, and most of the wild life were mechanical imitations of Nyjoran originals.This place was wilder than even the stories of Nyjora.After all, that world had been well settled before it fell to medievalism.The Tines' had never been civilized, had never spread cities across continents.Pilgrim guessed there were fewer than thirty million packs in all the world.The Northwest was only beginning to be settled.Game was everywhere.In their hunting, the Tines were like animals.Troopers raced through the underforest.The favorite hunt was one of sheer endurance, where the prey was chased until it dropped.That was rarely practical here, but they got almost as much pleasure from chasing the unwary into ambushes.Johanna didn't like it.Was this a medieval perversion or a peculiarly Tinish one?If allowed the time, the troops didn't use their bows and knives.The pleasure of the hunt included slashing at throats and bellies with teeth and claws.Not that the forest creatures were without defenses: for millions of years threat and counterthreat had evolved here.Almost every animal could generate ultrasonic screeching that totally drowned the thought of any nearby pack.There were parts of the forest that seemed silent to Johanna, but through which the army drove at a cautious gallop, troops and drivers writhing in agony from the unseen assault.
