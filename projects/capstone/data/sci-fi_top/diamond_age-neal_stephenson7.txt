Where are you?""The cast party, dummy!"said Carl."There's a cab waiting for you outside we sprung for a half laner!"Miranda pulled out of the ractive, finished tidying up the body stage, and left it open so that some other member of the company could come in a few hours later and work the gold shift.She ran down the helical gauntlet of plaster cherubs, muses, and Trojans, across the lobby where a couple of bleary eyed apprentice ractors were cleaning up the debris from this evening's live performance, and out the front doors.There in the street, illuminated by the queasy pink and purple neon of the marquee, was a half lane cab with its lights on.She was dully surprised when the driver headed toward the Bund, not toward the midrise districts in Pudong, where tribeless, lower income Westerners typically had their flats.Cast parties usually happened in someone's living room.Then she reminded herself that the Parnasse was a successful theatre company nowadays, that they had a whole building somewhere full of developers coming up with new ractives, that the current production of Macbeth had cost a lot of money.Carl had flown to Tokyo and Shenzhen and San Francisco seeking investors and had not come back emptyhanded.The first month of performances was sold out.But tonight, there had been a lot of empty seats in the house, because most of the opening night crowd was non Chinese, and non Chinese were nervous about going out on the streets because of rumors about the Fists of Righteous Harmony.Miranda was nervous too, though she wouldn't admit it.The taxi turned a corner, and its headlights swept across a knot of young Chinese men gathered in a doorway, and as one of them lifted a cigarette to his mouth, she caught a glimpse of a scarlet ribbon knotted around his wrist.Her chest clenched up, her heart fluttered, and she had to swallow hard a few times.But the young men could not see into the silvered windows of the cab.They did not converge on her, brandishing weapons and crying "Sha!Sha!"The Cathay Hotel stood in the middle of the Bund, at the intersection with Nanjing Road, the Rodeo Drive of the Far East.As far as Miranda could see all the way to Nanjing, maybe it was lined with Western and Nipponese boutiques and department stores, and the airspace above the street was besprent with almond size aerostats, each with its own cine camera and pattern recognition ware to watch for suspicious looking congregations of young men who might be Fist cells.Like all of the other big Western buildings on the waterfront, the Cathay was outlined in white light, which was probably a good thing because otherwise it wouldn't have looked like much.The exterior was bleak and dingy in the daytime.She played a little game of chicken with the doorman.She strode toward the entrance, confident that he'd haul the door open for her, but he stood there with his hands clasped behind his back, staring back at her sullenly.Finally he gave way and hauled the door open, though she had to break her stride so as not to smash into it.George Bernard Shaw had stayed here; Noel Coward had written a play here.The lobby was high and narrow, Beaux Arts marble, glorious ironwork chandeliers, white light from the Bund buildings filtering in through stained glass arches.An ancient jazz band was playing in the bar, slap bass over trashcan drums.Miranda stood on tiptoe in the entrance, looking for the party, and saw nothing except middle aged Caucasian airship tourists slow dancing and the usual lineup of sharp young Chinese men along the bar, hoping she'd come in.Eventually she found her way up to the eighth floor, where all the fancy restaurants were.The big banquet room had been rented out by some kind of garishly wealthy organization and was full of men wearing intimidatingly sophisticated suits, women wearing even more intimidating dresses, and the odd sprinkling of Victorians wearing far more conservative but still dapper and expensive stuff.The music was fairly restrained, just one tuxedoed Chinese man playing jazz on a grand piano, but on a stage at one end of the room, a larger band was setting up its equipment.She was just cringing away, wondering in what back room the scruffy actors' bash might be found, when she heard someone calling her name from inside.Carl Hollywood was approaching, striding across the middle of the banquet hall like he owned the place, resplendent in hand tooled cowboy boots made of many supple and exotic bird and reptile skins, wearing a vast raiment, sort of a cross between a cape and a Western duster, that nearly brushed the floor, and that made him look seven feet tall rather than a mere six and a half.His long blond hair was brushed back away from his forehead, his King Tut beard was sharp and straight as a hoe.He was gorgeous and he knew it, and his blue eyes were piercing right through Miranda, holding her there in front of the open elevator doors, through which she'd almost escaped.He gave her a big hug and whirled her around.She shrank against him, shielded from the crowd in the banquet hall by his enveloping cloak."I look like shit," she said."Why didn't you tell me it was going to be this kind of a party?""Why didn't you know?"Carl said.As a director, one of his talents was to ask the most difficult imaginable questions."I would have worn something different.I look like "  "You look like a young bohemian artiste," Carl said, stepping back to examine her typically form fitting black bodysuit, "who doesn't give a shit about pretentious clothes, who makes everyone else in the room feel overdressed, and who can get away with it because she's got that special something. ""You silver tongued dog," she said, "you know that's bullshit. ""A few years ago you would have sailed into that room with that lovely chin of yours held up like a battering ram, and everyone would have stepped back to look at you.Why not now?""I don't know," Miranda said."I think with this Nell thing, I've incurred all the disadvantages of parenthood without actually getting to have a child. "Carl relaxed and softened, and Miranda knew she'd spoken the words he was looking for."C'mere," he said."I want you to meet someone. ""If you're going to try to fix me up with some wealthy son of a bitch "  "Wouldn't dream of it. ""I'm not going to become a housewife who acts in her spare time. ""I realize that," Carl said."Now calm yourself for a minute. "Miranda was forcibly ignoring the fact that they were walking through the middle of the room now.Carl Hollywood was drawing all of the attention, which suited her.She exchanged smiles with a couple of ractors who had appeared in the interactive invitation that had summoned her here; both of them were having what looked like very enjoyable conversations with fine looking people, probably investors."Who are you taking me to meet?""A guy named Beck.An old acquaintance of mine. ""But not a friend?"Carl adopted an uncomfortable grin and shrugged."We've been friends sometimes.We've also been collaborators.Business partners.This is how life works, Miranda: After a while, you build up a network of people.You pass them bits of data they might be interested in and vice versa.To me, he's one of those guys. ""I can't help wondering why you want me to meet him. ""I believe," Carl said very quietly, but using some actor's trick so that she could hear every word, "that this gentleman can help you find Nell.And that you can help him find something he wants. "And he stepped aside with a swirl of cloak, pulling out a chair for her.They were in the corner of the banquet hall.Sitting on the opposite side of the table, his back to a large marble silled window, the illuminated Bund and the mediatronic cacophony of Pudong spilling bloody light across the glossy shoulder pads of his suit, was a young African man in dreadlocks, wearing dark glasses with minuscule circular lenses held in some kind of ostentatiously complex metallic space grid.Sitting next to him, but hardly noticed by Miranda, was a Nipponese businessman wearing a dark formal kimono and smoking what smelled like an old fashioned, fully carcinogenic cigar."Miranda, this is Mr.Beck and Mr.Oda, both privateers.Gentlemen, Ms.Miranda Redpath. "Both men nodded in a pathetic vestige of a bow, but neither made a move to shake hands, which was just as well nowadays some amazing things could be transferred through skin to skin contact.Miranda didn't even nod back to them; she just sat down and let Carl scoot her in.She didn't like people who described themselves as privateers.It was just a pretentious word for a thete someone who didn't have a tribe.Either that, or they really did belong to tribes from the looks of them, probably some weird synthetic phyle she'd never heard of and, for some reason, were pretending not to.Carl said, "I have explained to the gentlemen, without getting into any details, that you would like to do the impossible.Can I get you something to drink, Miranda?"After Carl Hollywood left, there was a rather long silence during which Mr.Beck presumably stared at Miranda, though she could not tell because of the dark glasses.Mr.Oda's primary function appeared to be that of nervous spectator, as if he had wagered half of his net worth on whether Miranda or Mr.Beck would speak first.A stratagem occurred to Mr.Oda.He pointed in the direction of the bandstand and nodded significantly."You like this band?"Miranda looked over at the band, half a dozen men and women in an assortment of races.Mr.Oda's question was difficult to answer because they had not yet made any music.She looked back at Mr.Oda, who pointed significantly at himself."Oh.You're the backer?"Miranda said.Mr.Oda withdrew a small glittering object from his pocket and slid it across the table toward Miranda.It was a cloisonn pin shaped like a dragonfly.She had noticed similar ones adorning several partygoers.She picked it up cautiously.Mr.Oda tapped himself on the lapel and nodded, encouraging her to put it on.She left it sitting there on the table for the time being."I'm not seeing anything," Mr.Beck finally said, apparently for Mr.Oda's benefit."To a first approximation, she is clean. "Miranda realized that Mr.Beck had been checking her out using some kind of display in his phenomenoscopic glasses.Miranda was still trying to work out some kind of unpleasant response when Mr.Oda leaned forward into his own cloud of cigar smoke."It is our understanding," he said, "that you wish to make a connection.Your wish is very strong. "Privateers.The word also implied that these gentlemen, at least in their own minds, had some kind of an angle, some way of making money off of their own lack of tribal affiliation."I've been told that such things are impossible. ""It's more correct to speak in probabilistic terms," said Mr.Beck.His accent was more Oxford than anything else, with a Jamaican lilt, and a crispness that owed something to India."Astronomically improbable, then," Miranda said."There you go," said Mr.Beck.Now, somehow, the ball had found its way into Miranda's court."If you guys think you've found a way to beat probability, why don't you go into the Vegas ractives and make a fortune?"Misters Beck and Oda were actually more amused by that crack than she had expected them to be.They were capable of irony.That was one good sign in the almost overwhelming barrage of negative signals she'd been getting from them so far.The band started up, playing dance music with a good beat.The lights came down, and the party began to glitter as light flashed from the dragonfly pins."It wouldn't work," Mr.Beck said, "because Vegas is a game of pure numbers with no human meaning to it.The mind doesn't interface to pure numbers. ""But probability is probability," Miranda said."What if you have a dream one night that your sister is in a crash, and you contact her the next day and learn that she broke up with her boyfriend?""It could be a coincidence. ""Yes.But not a very probable one.You see, maybe it's possible to beat probability, when the heart as well as the mind is involved. "Miranda supposed that neither Mr.Beck nor Mr.Oda understood the essential cruelty of what they were saying.It was much better not to have any hope at all."Are you guys involved in some kind of religious thing?"she said.Misters Beck and Oda looked at each other significantly.Mr.Oda went into some peculiar routine of tooth sucking and throat clearing that would probably convey a torrent of information to another Nipponese person but meant nothing to Miranda, other than giving her a general hint that the situation was rather complicated.Mr.Beck produced an antique silver snufibox, or a replica of one, took out a pinch of nanosite dust, and hoovered it up into one of his great circular nostrils, then nervously scratched the underside of his nose.He slid his glasses way down, exposing his big brown eyes, and stared distractedly over Miranda's shoulder into the thick of the party, watching the band and the dancers' reaction to it.He was wearing a dragonfly pin, which had begun to glow and to flash gorgeous colored lights, like a fleet of police cars and firetrucks gathered round a burning house.The band segued into a peculiar, tuneless, beatless miasma of noise, spawning lazy convection currents in the crowd."How do you guys know Carl?"Miranda said, hoping to break the ice a bit.Mr.Oda shook his head apologetically."I have not had the pleasure of making his acquaintance until recently. ""Used to do thyuh tuh with him in London. ""You're a ractor?"Mr.Beck snorted ironically.A variegated silk hankie flourished in his hand, and he blew his nose quickly and cleanly like a practiced snufftaker."I am a technical boy," he said."You program ractives?""That is a subset of my activities. ""You do lights and sets?Or digital stuff?Or nanotech?""Invidious distinctions do not interest me.I am interested in one thing," said Mr.Beck, holding up his index finger, topped with a very large but perfectly manicured claw of a fingernail, "and that is use of tech to convey meaning. ""That covers a lot of areas nowadays. ""Yes, but it shouldn't.That is to say that the distinctions between those areas are bogus. ""What's wrong with just programming ractives?""Nothing at all," said Mr.Beck, "just as nothing is wrong with traditional live theatre, or for that matter, sitting round a campfire telling stories, like I used to enjoy on the beach when I was a lad.But as long as there are new ways to be found, it is my job, as a technical boy, to find them.Your art, lady, is racting.Searching for the new tech is mine. "The noise coming from the band had begun to pulse irregularly.As they talked, the pulses gathered themselves into beats and became steadier.Miranda turned around to look at the people on the dance floor.They were all standing around with faraway looks on their faces, concentrating on something.Their dragonfly pins were flashing wildly now, joining in a coherent pulse of pure white on each beat.Miranda realized that the pins were somehow patched into the wearers' nervous systems and that they were talking to each other, creating the music collectively.A guitarist began to weave an improvised melodic line through the gradually coalescing pattern of sound, and the sound condensed around it as all of the dancers heard the tune.They had a feedback loop going.A young woman began to chant out some kind of tuneless rap that sounded improvised.As she went on, she broke into melody.The music was still weird and formless, but it was beginning to approach something you might hear on a professional recording.Miranda turned back to face Mr.Beck."You think you've invented a new way to convey meaning with technology "  "Medium. ""A new medium, and that it can help me get what I want.Because when meaning is involved, the laws of probability can be broken. ""There are two misconceptions in your statement.One: I did not invent the medium.Others did, perhaps for different purposes, and I have stumbled across it, or actually just heard intimations."As far as the laws of probability, my lady, these cannot be broken, any more than any other mathematical principle.But laws of physics and mathematics are like a coordinate system that runs in only one dimension.Perhaps there is another dimension perpendicular to it, invisible to those laws of physics, describing the same things with different rules, and those rules are written in our hearts, in a deep place where we cannot go and read them except in our dreams. "Miranda looked to Mr.Oda, hoping he'd wink or something, but he was staring into the dance floor with a terribly serious expression, as though enfolded in deep thoughts himself, nodding slightly.Miranda drew a deep breath and sighed.When she looked up at Mr.Beck again, he was watching her, noting her curiosity about Mr.Oda.He turned one hand palm up and rubbed the ball of his thumb over his fingertips.So Beck was the hacker and Oda was the backer.The oldest and most troublesome relationship in the technological world."We require a third participant," Mr.Beck said, dovetailing into her thoughts."To do what?"Miranda said, evasive and defensive at the same time."All technomedia ventures have the same structure," said Mr.Oda, bestirring himself for the first time in a while.By now a nice synergy had developed between band and crowd, and a lot of dancing was going on some intimidatingly sophisticated stuff, and also some primal moshing."Three legged tripod. "Oda held up a fist and began to extend fingers as he enumerated the same.Miranda noted that his fingers were gnarly and bent, as if they'd all been broken frequently.Mr.Oda was, perhaps, a veteran practitioner of certain martial arts now disdained by most Nipponese because of their lower class provenance."Leg number one: new technological idea.Mr.Beck.Leg number two: adequate financial backing.Mr.Oda.Leg number three: the artist. "Misters Beck and Oda looked significantly at Miranda.She threw back her head and managed a nice solid laugh, hitting that sweet spot down in her diaphragm.It felt good.She shook her head, letting her hair swing back and forth across her shoulders.Then she leaned forward across the table, shouting to be heard above the band."You guys must be desperate.I'm old hat, guys.There's half a dozen ractors in this room with better prospects than me.Didn't Carl fill you in?I've been holed up in a body stage for six years doing kid stuff.I'm not a star. ""Star means a master of conventional ractives, which are precisely the technology we are trying to move beyond," said Mr.Beck, a bit scornful that she wasn't getting it.Mr.Oda pointed to the band."None of these people were professional musicians some not even amateurs.Musician skills are not relevant for this these people were new kinds of artists born too early. ""Almost too early," Mr.Beck said."Oh, my god," Miranda said, starting to get it.For the first time, she believed that what Beck and Oda were talking about whatever the hell it was was a real possibility.Which meant that she was ninety percent convinced though only Beck and Oda understood that.It was too loud to talk.A mosher backed into Miranda's chair and nearly fell over her.Beck stood up, came round the table, and extended one hand, asking her to dance.Miranda looked into the Dionysian revel filling the floor and understood that the only way to be safe was to join it.She plucked her dragonfly pin from the tabletop and followed Beck into the midst of the dance.As she pinned it on, it began to flash, and she thought she heard a new strain woven into the song.From the Primer, Princess Nell enters into the lands of King Coyote.All that hot afternoon Nell toiled up the numberless switchbacks, occasionally reaching into the bag that dangled at her waist, drawing out a handful of Purple's ashes and scattering them behind her like seeds.Whenever she stopped to rest, she could look out across the burnt desert she had just crossed: a tawny plain scabbed with reddish brown volcanic rock, patches of aromatic greenish gray shrubs clinging like bread mold to any parts that were sheltered from the eternal wind.She had hoped that when she climbed the face of this mountain, she would rise up above the dust, but it had followed her, coating her lips and her toes.When she drew a breath through her nose, it only stung her parched nostrils, and so she had given up trying to smell anything.But late in the afternoon a cool moist draft spilled down the mountain and over her face.She drew in a breath of it, hoping to catch some of the cold air before it trickled down into the desert.It smelled of evergreens.As she climbed the switchbacks, she forded those delightful currents of air over and over, so that as she rounded each hairpin turn in the trail, she had an incentive to climb toward the next one.The little shrubs that clutched rocks and cowered in cracks became bigger and more numerous, and flowers began to appear, first tiny little white ones like handfuls of salt strewn over the rocks, then larger blossoms, blue and magenta and brilliant orange, brimming with scented nectar that attracted bees all fuzzy and yellow with stolen pollen.Gnarled oaks and short dense evergreens cast tiny shadows across the path.The skyline grew closer, and the turns in the path became wider as the mountain became less steep.Nell rejoiced when the switchbacks ended and the trail took off straight across an undulating mountaintop meadow thick with purple flowered heather and marked with occasional stands of tall firs.For a moment she was afraid that this meadow was nothing more than a ledge, and that she had more mountains to ascend; but then the path turned downhill, and treading heavily as new muscles caught her descending weight, she half ran across a vast boulder, pocked with tiny pools of clear water and occasional lozenges of wet snow, until she reached a point where it fell away from under her and she skidded to a precarious stop, looking down like a peregrine falcon over an immense country of blue lakes and green mountains, shrouded in a whirling storm of silver mist.Nell turned the page and saw it, just as the book said.This was a twopage illustration a color painting, she reckoned.Any one part of it looked just as real as a cine feed.But the geometry of the thing was funny, borrowing some suprarealistic tricks from classical Chinese landscape painting; the mountains were too steep, and they marched away forever into the distance, and if Nell stared, she could see tall castles clinging to their impossibly precipitous slopes, colorful banners waving from their flagpoles bearing heraldic devices that were dynamic: The gryphons crouched, the lions roared, and she could see all of these details, even though the castles should have been miles away; whenever she looked at something it got bigger and turned into a different picture, and when her attention wavered when she blinked and shook her head it snapped back to the first view again.She spent a long time doing that, because there were dozens of castles at the very least, and she got the feeling that if she kept looking and counting she might look forever.But it wasn't all castles: there were mountains, cities, rivers, lakes, birds and beasts, caravans, and travelers of all kinds.She spent a while staring at a group of travelers who had drawn their wagons into a roadside meadow and set up a camp, clapping hands round a bonfire while one of them played a reel on some small bellowspowered bagpipes, barely audible these many miles away.Then she realized that the book hadn't said anything for a long time."What happened then?"she said.The Young Lady's Illustrated Primer said nothing."Nell looked for a safe way down," Nell essayed.Her vantage point began to move.A patch of snow swung into view."No, wait!"she said, "Nell stuffed some clean snow into her water bottles. "In the painting, Nell could see her bare pink hands scooping up snow and packing it bit by bit into the neck of her bottle.When it was full, she put the cork back in (Nell didn't have to specifr that) and began moving around on the rock, looking for a place that wasn't so steep.Nell didn't have to explain that in detail either; in the ractive, she searched the rock in a fairly rational way and in a few minutes found a stairway chiseled into the rock, winding down the mountain endlessly until it pierced a cloud layer far below.Princess Nell began descending the steps, one at a time.After a while, Nell tried an experiment: "Princess Nell descended the stairs for many hours. "This triggered a series of dissolves like she'd seen on old passives: Her current view dissolved into a closeup of her feet, trudging down a couple of steps, which dissolved into a view from considerably farther down the mountain, followed by a closeup of Princess Nell unscrewing her water bottle and drinking melted snow; another view from farther down; Nell sitting down for a rest; a soaring eagle; the approaching cloud layer; big trees; descending through the mist; and finally, Nell tramping wearily down the last ten steps, which left her in a clearing in a dark coniferous forest, carpeted with rust colored pine needles.It was twilight, and the wolves were beginning to howl.Nell made the usual arrangements for the night, lit a fire, and curled up to sleep.Having reached a good stopping place, Nell started to close the book.She'd have to continue this later.She had just entered the land of the oldest and most powerful of all the Faery Kings.The many castles on the mountains belonged to all of his Dukes and Earls, and she suspected she would have to visit them all before she had gotten what she'd come for.It was not a quick adventure for an early Saturday morning.But just as she was clasping the book together, new words and an illustration appeared on the page she'd been reading, and something about the illustration made her open the book back up.It showed a crow perched on a tree branch above Princess Nell, holding a necklace in its beak.It was eleven jeweled keys strung on a golden chain.Princess Nell had been wearing it around her neck; apparently the next event in the story was that this bird stole it while she was sleeping.Beneath the picture was a poem, spoken by the crow from his perch:  Castles, gardens, gold, and jewels  Contentment signify, for fools  Like Princess Nell; but those  Who cultivate their wit  Like King Coyote and his crows  Compile their power bit by bit  And hide it places no one knows.Nell closed up the book This was too upsetting to think about just now.She had been collecting those keys for most of her life.The first she'd taken from King Magpie just after she and Harv had arrived at Dovetail.She had picked up the other ten one at a time during the years since then.She had done this by traveling to the lands of the Faery Kings and Queens who owned those keys and using the tricks she had learned from her Night Friends.Each key had come to her in a different way.One of the hardest keys to get had belonged to an old Faery Queen who had seen through every trick that Nell could think up and fought off every assault.Finally, in desperation, Princess Nell had thrown herself on the mercy of that Queen and told her the sad story of Harv locked up in the Dark Castle.The Queen had fed Nell a nice bowl of chicken soup and handed over the key with a smile.Not much later, Duck had encountered a nice young mallard on the road and flown away with him to start a family.Purple and Princess Nell then traveled together for several years, and on many a dark night, sitting around the campfire under a full moon, Purple had taught Nell secret things from her magic books and from the ancient lore she kept in her head.Recently they had traveled for a thousand miles on camelback across a great desert full of djinns, demons, sultans, and caliphs and finally reached the great onion domed palace of the local Faery King himself a djinn of great power who ruled over all the desert lands.Princess Nell had devised a complicated plan to trick their way into the djinn's treasury.To carry it out, she and Purple had to live in the city around the palace for a couple of years and make many treks into the desert in search of magic lanterns, rings, secret caverns, and the like.Finally, Princess Nell and Purple had penetrated to the djinn king's treasury and found the eleventh key.But they had been surprised by the djinn himself, who attacked them in the guise of a fire breathing serpent.Purple had transformed herself into a giant eagle with metallic wings and talons that could not be burned much to the surprise of Princess Nell, who had never imagined that her companion possessed such power.The battle between Purple and the djinn raged for a day and a night, both combatants transforming themselves into any number of fantastical creatures and hurling all manner of devastating spells at each other, until finally the mighty castle lay in ruins, the desert was scorched and blasted for many miles around, and Purple and the djinn king both lay dead on the floor of what had been the treasury.Nell had picked up the eleventh key from the floor, put it on her chain, cremated Purple's body, and scattered her ashes across the desert as she walked, for many days, toward the mountains and the green land, where the eleven keys had now been stolen away from her.Nell's experiences at school;  a confrontation with Miss Stricken;  the rigors of Supplementary Curriculum;  Miss Matheson's philosophy of education;  three friends go separate ways.AGLAIA BRILLIANCE  EUPHROSYNE JOY  THALIA BLOOM  The names of the three graces, and diverse artists' conceptions of the ladies themselves, were chiseled, painted, and sculpted freely about the interior and exterior of Miss Matheson's Academy.Nell could hardly look anywhere without seeing one of them prancing across a field of wildflowers, distributing laurel wreaths to the worthy, jointly thrusting a torch toward heaven, or shedding lambent effulgence upon the receptive pupils.Nell's favorite part of the curriculum was Thalia, which was scheduled for an hour in the morning and an hour in the afternoon.When Miss Matheson hauled once on the old bellrope dangling down from the belfry, belting a single dolorous clang across the campus, Nell and the other girls in her section would arise, curtsy to their teacher, walk in single file down the corridor to the courtyard then break into a chaotic run until they reached the Hall of Physical Culture, where they would strip out of their heavy, scratchy complicated uniforms and climb into lighter, looser, scratchy complicated uniforms with more freedom of movement.The Bloom curriculum was taught by Miss Ramanujan or one of her assistants.Usually they did something vigorous in the morning, like field hockey, and something graceful in the afternoon, like ballroom dance, or peculiar, giggle inducing exercises in how to walk, stand, and sit like a Lady.Brilliance was Miss Matheson's department, though she mostly left it to her assistants, occasionally wheeling in and out of various classrooms in an old wood and wicker wheelchair.During the Aglaia period, the girls would get together in groups of half a dozen or so to answer questions or solve problems put to them by the teachers: For example, they counted how many species of plants and animals could be found in one square foot of the forest behind the school.They put on a scene from a play in Greek.They used a ractive simulation to model the domestic economy of a Lakota band before and after the introduction of horses.They designed simple machines with a nanopresence rig and tried to compile them in the M. C.  and make them work They wove brocades and made porcelain as Chinese ladies used to do.And there was an ocean of history to be learned: first biblical, Greek, and Roman, and then the history of many other peoples around the world that essentially served as backdrop for History of the English Speaking Peoples.The latter subject was, curiously, not part of the Brilliance curriculum; it was left firmly in the hands of Miss Stricken, who was mistress of Joy.In addition to two one hour periods each day, Miss Stricken had the attention of the entire assembled student body once in the morning, once at noon, and once in the evening.During these times her basic function was to call the students to order; publicly upbraid those sheep who had prominently strayed since the last such assembly; disgorge any random meditations that had been occupying her mind of late; and finally, in reverential tones, introduce Father Cox, the local vicar, who would lead the students in prayer.Miss Stricken also had the students all to herself for two hours on Sunday morning and could optionally command their attention for up to eight hours on Saturdays if she came round to the opinion that they wanted supplementary guidance.The first time Nell sat down in one of Miss Stricken's classrooms, she found that her desk had perversely been left directly behind another girl's, so that she was unable to see anything except for the bow in that girl's hair.She got up, tried to skooch the desk, and found that it was fixed to the floor.All the desks, in fact, were arranged in a perfectly regular grid, facing in the same direction which is to say, toward Miss Stricken or one of her two assistants, Miss Bowlware and Mrs.Disher.Miss Bowlware taught them History of the English Speaking Peoples, starting with the Romans at Londinium and careening through the Norman Conquest, Magna Carta, Wars of the Roses, Renaissance, and Civil War; but she didn't really hit her stride until she got to the Georgian period, at which point she worked herself up into a froth explaining the shortcomings of that syphilitic monarch, which had inspired the rightthinking Americans to break away in disgust.They studied the most ghastly parts of Dickens, which Miss Bowlware carefully explained was called Victorian literature because it was written during the reign of Victoria I, but was actually about pre Victorian times, and that the mores of the original Victorians the ones who built the old British Empire were actually a reaction against the sort of bad behavior engaged in by their parents and grandparents and so convincingly detailed by Dickens, their most popular novelist.The girls actually got to sit at their desks and play a few ractives showing what it was like to live during this time: generally not very nice, even if you selected the option that turned off all the diseases.At this point, Mrs.Disher stepped in to say, if you thought that was scary, look at how poor people lived in the late twentieth century.Indeed, after ractives told them about the life of an inner city Washington, D. C. , child during the 1990s, most students had to agree they'd take a workhouse in pre Victorian England over that any day.All of the foregoing set the stage for a three pronged, parallel examination of the British Empire; pre Vietnam America; and the modern and ongoing history of New Atlantis.In general, Mrs.Disher handled the more modern stuff and anything pertaining to America.Miss Stricken handled the big payoff at the end of each period and at the end of each unit.She stormed in to explain what conclusion they were being led to and to make sure that all of them got it.She also had a way of lunging predatorily into the classroom and rapping the knuckles of any girl who had been whispering, making faces at the teachers, passing notes, doodling, woolgathering, fidgeting, scratching, nose picking, sighing, or slumping.Clearly, she was sitting in her closetlike office next door watching them with cine monitors.Once, Nell was sitting in Joy diligently absorbing a lecture about the Lend Lease Program.When she heard the squeaky door from Miss Stricken's office swing open behind her, like all the other girls she suppressed the panicky urge to look around.She heard Miss Stricken's heels popping up her aisle, heard the whir of the ruler, and then suddenly felt her knuckles explode."Hairdressing is a private, not a public activity, Nell," Miss Stricken said."The other girls know this; now you do too. "Nell's face burned, and she wrapped her good hand around her damaged one like a bandage.She did not understand anything until one of the other girls caught her eye and made a corkscrewing motion with her index finger up near one temple: Apparently Nell had been twisting her hair around her finger, which she often did when she was reading the Primer or thinking hard about any one thing.The ruler was such a pissant form of discipline, compared to a real beating, that she could not take it seriously at first and actually found it funny the first few times.As the months went by, though, it seemed to get more painful.Either Nell was becoming soft, or more likely the full dimensions of the punishment were beginning to sink in.She had been such an outsider at first that nothing mattered.But as she began to excel in the other classes and to gain the respect of teachers and students alike, she found herself with pride to lose.Part of her wanted to rebel, to throw everything away so that it could not be used against her.But she enjoyed the other classes so much that she couldn't bear to think further of the possibility.One day Miss Stricken decided to concentrate all her attentions on Nell.There was nothing unusual about that it was standard to randomly single out particular scholars for intensive enforcement.With twenty minutes left in the hour, Miss Stricken had already gotten Nell on the right hand for hair twisting and on the left for nail biting, when, to her horror, Nell realized that she was scratching her nose and that Miss Stricken was standing in the aisle glaring at her like a falcon.Both of Nell's hands shot into her lap, beneath the desk.Miss Stricken walked up to her deliberately, pop pop pop."Your right hand, Nell," she said, "just about here. "And she indicated with the end of the ruler an altitude that would be a convenient place for the assault rather high above the desk, so that everyone in the room could see it.Nell hesitated for a moment, then held her hand up."A bit higher, Nell," Miss Stricken said.Nell moved her hand a bit higher."Another inch should do it, I think," Miss Stricken said, appraising the hand as if it were carved in marble and recently excavated from a Greek temple.Nell could not bring herself to raise the hand any higher."Raise it one more inch, Nell," Miss Stricken said, "so that the other girls can observe and learn along with you. "Nell raised her hand just a bit."That was rather less than an inch, I should think," Miss Stricken said.Other girls in the class began to titter their faces were all turned back toward Nell, and she could see their exultation, and somehow Miss Stricken and the ruler became irrelevant compared to the other girls.Nell raised her hand a whole inch, saw the windup out of the corner of her eye, heard the whir.At the last moment, on an impulse, she flipped her hand over, caught the ruler on her palm, grabbed it, and twisted in a way that Dojo had taught her, bending it against the grain of Miss Stricken's fingers so that she was forced to let go.Now Nell had the ruler, and Miss Stricken was disarmed.Her opponent was a bulging sort of woman, taller than average, rather topheavy on those heels, the sort of teacher whose very fleshiness becomes the object of morbid awe among her gamine pupils, whose personal toilet practices the penchant for dandruff, the habitually worn out lipstick, the little wad of congealed saliva at the corner of the mouth loom larger in her students' minds than the Great Pyramids or the Lewis and Clark Expedition.Like all other women, Miss Stricken benefited from a lack of external genitalia that would make it more difficult for Nell to incapacitate her, but nevertheless, Nell could think of half a dozen ways to leave her a bloody knot on the floor and not waste more than a quarter of a minute in the process.During her time with Constable Moore, noting her benefactor's interest in war and weapons, she had taken up a renewed interest in martial arts, had paged back in the Primer to the Dinosaur's Tale and been pleased but hardly surprised to discover that Dojo was still holding lessons there, picking up just where he and Belle the Monkey had left off.Thinking of her friend Dinosaur and her sensei, Dojo the Mouse, she suddenly felt shame far deeper than anything Miss Stricken or her sniggering classmates could inflict.Miss Stricken was a stupid hag, and her classmates were snot nosed clowns, but Dojo was her friend and her teacher, he had always respected her and given her his full attention, and he had carefully taught her the ways of humility and self discipline.Now she had perverted his teachings by using her skill to take Miss Stricken's ruler.She could not have been more ashamed.She handed the ruler back, raised her hand high in the air, and heard but did not feel the impacts of the ruler, some ten in all."I shall expect you in my office after evening prayers, Nell," Miss Stricken said when she was finished."Yes, Miss Stricken," Nell said."What are you girls looking at?"blurted Mrs.Disher, who was running the class today."Turn around and pay attention!"And with that it was all over.Nell sat in her desk for the rest of the hour as if carved from a solid block of gypsum.Her interview with Miss Stricken at the end of the day was short and businesslike, no violence or even histrionics.Nell was informed that her performance in the Joy phase of the curriculum was so deficient that it placed her in danger of failing and being expelled from the school altogether, and that her only hope was to come in each Saturday for eight hours of supplementary study.Nell wished more than anything that she could refuse.Saturday was the only day of the week when she did not have to attend school at all.She always spent the day reading the Primer, exploring the fields and forests around Dovetail, or visiting Harv down in the Leased Territories.She felt that, through her own mistakes, she had ruined her life at Miss Matheson's Academy.Until recently, Miss Stricken's classes had been nothing more than a routine annoyance an ordeal that she had to sit through in order to experience the fun parts of the curriculum.She could look back on a time only a couple of months ago when she would come home with her mind aglow from all the things she had learned in Brilliance, and when the Joy part was just an indistinct smudge around the edge.But in recent weeks, Miss Stricken had, for some reason, loomed larger and larger in her view of the place.And somehow, Miss Stricken had read Nell's mind and had chosen just the right moment to step up her campaign of harassment.She had timed today's events perfectly.She had brought Nell's most deeply hidden feelings out into the open, like a master butcher exposing the innards with one or two deft strokes of the knife.And now everything was ruined.Now Miss Matheson's Academy had vanished and become Miss Stricken's House of Pain, and there was no way for Nell to escape from that house without giving up, which her friends in the Primer had taught her she must never do.Nell's name went up on a board at the front of the classroom labeled, in heavy brass letters, SUPPLEMENTARY CURRICULUMSTUDENTS.Within a few days, her name had been joined by two others: Fiona Hackworth and Elizabeth Finkle McGraw.Nell's disarming of the fearsome Miss Stricken had already become the stuff of oral legend, and her two friends had been so inspired by the act of defiance that they had gone to elaborate lengths to get themselves in trouble too.Now, the three best students of Miss Matheson's Academy were all doomed to Supplementary Curriculum.Each Saturday, Nell, Fiona, and Elizabeth would arrive at the school at seven o'clock, enter the room, and sit down in the front row in adjacent desks.This was part of Miss Stricken's fiendish plan.A less subtle tormentor would have placed the girls as far apart as possible to prevent them from talking to each other, but Miss Stricken wanted them right next to each other so that they would be more tempted to visit and pass notes.There was no teacher in the room at any time.They assumed that they were being monitored, but they never really knew.When they entered, each one of them had a pile of books on her desk old books bound in chafed leather.Their job was to copy the books out by hand and leave the pages neatly stacked on Miss Stricken's desk before they went home.Usually, the books were transcripts of debates from the House of Lords, from the nineteenth century.During their seventh Saturday in Supplementary Curriculum, Elizabeth Finkle McGraw suddenly dropped her pen, slammed her book shut, and threw it against the wall.Nell and Fiona could not keep themselves from laughing.But Elizabeth did not convey the impression of being in a very lighthearted mood.The old book had scarcely come to rest on the floor before Elizabeth had run over to it and begun kicking at it.With each blow a furious grunt escaped from her gorge.The book absorbed this violence impassively, driving Elizabeth into a higher rage; she dropped to her knees, flung the cover open, and began to rip out pages by the fistful.Nell and Fiona looked at each other, suddenly serious.The kicking had been funny, but something about the tearing of pages disturbed them both."Elizabeth!Stop it!"Nell said, but Elizabeth gave no signs of having heard her.Nell ran up to Elizabeth and hugged her from behind.Fiona scurried in a moment later and picked up the book."God damn it!"Elizabeth bellowed, "I don't care about any of the goddamn books, and I don't care about the Primer either!"The door banged open.Miss Stricken stomped in, dislodged Nell with a simple body check, got both arms around Elizabeth's shoulders, and manhandled her out the door.A few days later, Elizabeth left on a lengthy vacation with her parents, jumping from one New Atlantis clave to another in the family's private airship, working their way across the Pacific and North America and finally to London itself, where they settled in for several months.In the first few days, Nell received one letter from her, and Fiona received two.After that they received no response to their letters and eventually stopped trying.Elizabeth's name was removed from the Supplementary Curriculum plaque.Nell and Fiona soldiered on.Nell had reached the point where she could transcribe the old books all day long without actually absorbing a single word.During her first weeks in Supplementary Curriculum she had been frightened; in fact, she had been surprised at the level of her own fear and had come to realize that Authority, even when it refrained from violence, could be as disturbing a specter as anything she had seen in her earlier years.After the incident with Elizabeth, she became bored for many months, then furious for quite a while until she realized, in conversations with Duck and Purple, that her anger was eating her up inside.So with a conscious effort, she went back to being bored again.The reason she'd been furious was that copying out those books was such an unforgivably stupid waste of time.There was no end to what she could have learned reading the Primer for those eight hours.For that matter, the normal curriculum at Miss Matheson's Academy would have been perfectly fine as well.She was tormented by the irrationality of this place.One day, when she returned from a trip to the washroom, she was startled to notice that Fiona had hardly copied out a single page, though they had been there for hours.After this, Nell made it a practice to look at Fiona from time to time.She noticed that Fiona never stopped writing, but she was not paying attention to the old books.As she finished each page, she folded it up and placed it in her reticule.From time to time, she would stop and stare dreamily out the window for a few minutes, and then resume; or she might place both hands over her face and rock back and forth silently in her chair for a while before giving herself over to a long burst of ardent writing that might cover several pages in as many minutes.Miss Stricken cruised into the room late one afternoon, took the stack of completed pages from Nell's desk, flipped through them, and allowed her chin to decline by a few minutes of arc.This nearly imperceptible vestige of a nod was her way of saying that Nell was dismissed for the day.Nell had come to understand that one way for Miss Stricken to emphasize her power over the girls was for her to make her wishes known through the subtlest possible signs, so that her charges were forced to watch her anxiously at all times.Nell took her leave; but after proceeding a few steps down the corridor, she turned and stole back to the door and peeked through the window into the classroom.Miss Stricken had gotten the folded up pages out of Fiona's bag and was perusing them, strolling back and forth across the front of the room like the slow swing of a pendulum, a devastatingly ponderous motion.Fiona sat in her chair, her head bowed and her shoulders drawn together protectively.After reading the papers for an eternity or two, Miss Stricken dropped them on her desk and made some kind of brief statement, shaking her head in hopeless disbelief.Then she turned and walked out of the room.When Nell reached her, Fiona's shoulders were still shaking silently.Nell put her arms around Fiona, who finally began to draw in sobbing breaths.During the next few minutes she gradually moved on to that stage of crying where the body seems to swell up and poach in its own fluids.Nell suppressed the urge to be impatient.She well knew, as did all of the other girls, that Fiona's father had disappeared several years ago and never come back.He was rumored to be on an honorable and official mission; but as years went by this belief was gradually supplanted by the suspicion that something disgraceful had taken place.It would be easy enough for Nell to make the point that she had been through much worse.But seeing the depth of Fiona's unhappiness, she had to consider the possibility that Fiona was in a worse situation now.When Fiona's mother came by in a little half lane car to pick her up, and saw her daughter's red and ruinous face, an expression of black rage came over her own visage and she drove Fiona away without so much as a glance at Nell.Fiona showed up for church the next day as if nothing had happened and said nothing of it to Nell during the next week at school.In fact, Fiona hardly said a word to anyone, as she spent all of her time now daydreaming.When Nell and Fiona showed up at seven o'clock the next Saturday morning, they were astonished to find Miss Matheson waiting for them at the front of the classroom, sitting in her wood and wicker wheelchair, wrapped up in a thermogenic comforter.The stacks of books, paper, and fountain pens were not there, and their names had been removed from the plaque at the front of the room."It's a lovely spring day," Miss Matheson said."Let's gather some foxgloves. "They went across the playing fields to the meadow where the wildflowers grew, the two girls walking and Miss Matheson's wheelchair carrying her along on its many spoked smart wheels."Chiselled Spam," Miss Matheson said, sort of mumbling it to herself."Pardon me, Miss Matheson?"Nell said."I was just watching the smart wheels and remembering an advertisement from my youth," Miss Matheson said."I used to be a thrasher, you know.I used to ride skateboards through the streets.Now I'm still on wheels, but a different kind.Got a few too many bumps and bruises during my earlier career, I'm afraid. "..."It's a wonderful thing to be clever, and you should never think otherwise, and you should never stop being that way.But what you learn, as you get older, is that there are a few billion other people in the world all trying to be clever at the same time, and whatever you do with your life will certainly be lost swallowed up in the ocean unless you are doing it along with like minded people who will remember your contributions and carry them forward.That is why the world is divided into tribes.There are many Lesser phyles and three Great ones."What are the Great ones?""New Atlantis," Nell began."Nippon," said Fiona."Han," they concluded together."That is correct," Miss Matheson said."We traditionally include Han in the list because of its immense size and age even though it has lately been crippled by intestine discord.And some would include Hindustan, while others would view it as a riotously diverse collection of microtribes sintered together according to some formula we don't get."Now, there was a time when we believed that what a human mind could accomplish was determined by genetic factors.Piffle, of course, but it looked convincing for many years, because distinctions between tribes were so evident.Now we understand that it's all cultural.That, after all, is what a culture is a group of people who share in common certain acquired traits."Information technology has freed cultures from the necessity of owning particular bits of land in order to propagate; now we can live anywhere.The Common Economic Protocol specifies how this is to be arranged."Some cultures are prosperous; some are not.Some value rational discourse and the scientific method; some do not.Some encourage freedom of expression, and some discourage it.The only thing they have in common is that if they do not propagate, they will be swallowed up by others.All they have built up will be torn down; all they have accomplished will be forgotten; all they have learned and written will be scattered to the wind.In the old days it was easy to remember this because of the constant necessity of border defence.Nowadays, it is all too easily forgotten."New Atlantis, like many tribes, propagates itself largely through education.That is the raison d'tre of this Academy.Here you develop your bodies through exercise and dance, and your minds by doing projects.And then you go to Miss Stricken's class."What is the point of Miss Stricken's class?Anyone?Please speak up.You can't get in trouble, no matter what you say. "Nell said, after some dithering, "I'm not sure that it has any point. "Fiona just watched her saying it and smiled sadly.Miss Matheson smiled."You are not far off the mark.Miss Stricken's phase of the curriculum comes perilously close to being without any real substance.Why do we bother with it, then?""I can't imagine," Nell said."When I was a child, I took a karate class," Miss Matheson said, astonishingly."Dropped out after a few weeks.Couldn't stand it.I thought that the sensei would teach me how to defend myself when I was out on my skateboard.But the first thing he did was have me sweep the floor.Then he told me that if I wanted to defend myself, I should buy a gun.I came back the next week and he had me sweep the floor again.All I ever did was sweep.Now, what was the point of that?""To teach you humility and self discipline," Nell said.She had learned this from Dojo long ago."Precisely.Which are moral qualities.It is upon moral qualities that a society is ultimately founded.All the prosperity and technological sophistication in the world is of no use without that foundation we learned this in the late twentieth century, when it became unfashionable to teach these things. ""But how can you say it's moral?"said Fiona."Miss Stricken isn't moral.She's so cruel. ""Miss Stricken is not someone I would invite to dinner at my house.I would not hire her as a governess for my children.Her methods are not my methods.But people like her are indispensable."It is the hardest thing in the world to make educated Westerners pull together," Miss Matheson went on."That is the job of people like Miss Stricken.We must forgive them their imperfections.She is like an avatar do you children know about avatars?She is the physical embodiment of a principle.That principle is that outside the comfortable and welldefended borders of our phyle is a hard world that will come and hurt us if we are not careful.It is not an easy job to have.We must all feel sorry for Miss Stricken. "They brought sheaves of foxgloves, violet and magenta, back to the school and set them in vases in each classroom, leaving an especially large bouquet in Miss Stricken's office.Then they took tea with Miss Matheson, and then they each went home.Nell could not bring herself to agree with what Miss Matheson had said; but she found that, after this conversation, everything became easy.She had the neo Victorians all figured out now.The society had miraculously transmutated into an orderly system, like the simple computers they programmed in the school.Now that Nell knew all of the rules, she could make it do anything she wanted."Joy" returned to its former position as a minor annoyance on the fringes of a wonderful schoolday.Miss Stricken got her with the ruler from time to time, but not nearly so often, even when she was, in fact, scratching or slumping.Fiona Hackworth had a harder time of it, and within a couple of months she was back on the Supplementary Curriculum list.A few months after that, she stopped coming to school entirely.It was announced that she and her mother had moved to Atlantis/Seattle, and her address was posted in the hall for those who wished to write her letters.But Nell heard rumors about Fiona from the other girls, who had picked up snatches from their parents.After Fiona had been gone for a year or so, word got out that Fiona's mother had obtained a divorce which, in their tribe, only happened in cases of adultery or abuse.Nell wrote Fiona a long letter saying she was terribly sorry if her father had been abusive, and offering her support in that case.A few days later she got back a curt note in which Fiona defended her father from all charges.Nell wrote back a letter of apology but didn't hear from Fiona Hackworth again.It was about two years later that the news feeds filled up with astonishing tales of the young heiress Elizabeth Finkle McGraw, who had vanished from her family's estate outside of London and was rumored to have been sighted in London, Los Angeles, Hong Kong, Miami, and many other places, in the presence of people suspected of being highranking members of CryptNet.Hackworth awakes from a dream;  retreat from the world of the Drummers;  chronological discrepancies.Hackworth woke from a dream of unsustainable pleasure and realized it wasn't a dream; his penis was inside someone else, and he was steaming like a runaway locomotive toward ejaculation.He had no idea what was going on; but couldn't he be forgiven for doing the wrong thing?With a wiggle here and a thrust there, he finally nudged himself over the threshold, the smooth muscles of the tract in question executing their spinal algorithm.Just a few deep breaths into the refractory period, and he had already disengaged, yelping a little from the electric spark of withdrawal, and levered himself up on one arm to see whom he'd just violated.The firelight was enough to tell him what he already knew: Whoever this woman was, it wasn't Gwen.Hackworth had violated the most important promise he'd ever made, and he didn't even know the other party.But he knew it wasn't the first time.Far from it.He'd had sex with a lot of people in the past few years he'd even been buggered.There was, for example, the woman   Never mind, there was the man who   Strange to say, he could not think of any specific examples.But he knew he was guilty.It was precisely like waking up from a dream and having a clear train of thought in your mind, something you were working on just a few seconds ago, but being unable to remember it, consciousness peeled away from cognition.Like a three year old who has a talent for vanishing into crowds whenever you turn your back, Hackworth's memories had fled to the same place as words that are on the tip of your tongue, precedents for dj vu, last night's dreams.He knew he was in big trouble with Gwen, but that Fiona still loved him Fiona, taller than Gwen now, so self conscious about her still linear figure, still devoid of the second derivatives that add spice to life.Taller than Gwen?How's that?Better get out of this place before he had sex with someone else he didn't know.He wasn't in the central chamber anymore, rather in one of the tunnel's aneurysms with some twenty other people, all just as naked as he was.He knew which tunnel led to the exit (why?)and began to crawl down it, rather stiffly as it seemed that he was stiff and laden with cricks and cramps.Must not have been very athletic sex more in the Tantric mode.Sometimes they had sex for days.How did he know that?The hallucinations were gone, which was fine with him.He crawled through the tunnels for a long time.If he tried to think about where he was going, he got lost and eventually circled back to where he started.Only when his mind began to wander did he make his way on some kind of autopilot to a long chamber filled with silvery light, sloping upward.This was beginning to look familiar, he had seen this when he was still a young man.He followed it upward until he reached the end, where something unusually stony was under his feet.A hatch opened above him, and several tons of cold seawater landed on his head.He staggered up onto dry land and found himself in Stanley Park again, gray floor aft, green wall fore.The ferns rustled, and out stepped Kidnapper, who looked fuzzy and green.He also looked unusually dapper for a robotic horse, as Hackworth's bowler hat was perched on top of his head.Hackworth reached up to feel himself and was astounded to feel his face covered with hair.Several months' growth of beard was there.But even stranger, his chest was much hairier than it had been before.Some of the chest hair was gray, the only gray hairs he had ever seen coming out of his own follicles.Kidnapper was fuzzy and green because moss had been growing on him.The bowler looked terrible and had moss on it too.Hackworth reached out instinctively and put it on his head.His arm was thicker and hairier than it used to be, a not altogether unpleasing change, and even the hat felt a little tight.From the Primer, Princess Nell crosses the trail of the enigmatic Mouse Army;  a visit to an invalid.The clearing dimly visible through the trees ahead was a welcome sight, for the forests of King Coyote were surpassingly deep and forever shrouded in cool mists.Fingers of sunlight had begun to thrust between the clouds, and so Princess Nell decided to rest in the open space and, with any luck, bask in the sunlight.But when she reached the clearing, she found that it was not the flowerstrewn greensward she had expected; it was rather a swath that had been carved through the forest by the passage of some titanic force, which had flattened trees and churned up the soil as it progressed.When Princess Nell had recovered from her astonishment and mastered her fear, she resolved to make use of the tracking skills she had learned during her many adventures, so as to learn something about the nature of this unknown creature.As she soon discovered, the skills of an advanced tracker were not necessary in this case.The merest glance at the trampled soil revealed not (as she had anticipated) a few enormous footprints, but millions of tiny ones, superimposed upon one another in such numbers that no scrap of ground was unmarked by the impressions of tiny claws and footpads.A torrent of cats had passed this way; even had Princess Nell not recognized the footprints, the balls of loose hair and tiny scats, strewn everywhere, would have told the story.Cats moving in a herd!It was most unfeline behavior.Nell followed their track for some time, hoping to divine the cause of this prodigy.After a few miles the road widened into an abandoned camp freckled with the remains of innumerable small campfires.Nell combed this area for more clues, not without success: she found many mouse droppings here, and mouse footprints around the fires.The pattern of footprints made it clear that the cats had been concentrated in a few small areas, while the mice had apparently had the run of the place.The final piece of the puzzle was a tiny scrap of twisted rawhide that Nell found abandoned near one of the little campfires.Turning it around in her fingers, Nell realized that it was much like a horse's bridle except sized to fit around the head of a cat.She was standing on the trail of a vast army of mice, who rode on the backs of cats in the way that knights ride on horses.She had heard tales of the Mouse Army in other parts of the Land Beyond and dismissed them as ancient superstitions.But once, several years ago, in an inn high in the mountains, where Princess Nell had stayed for the night, she had been awakened early in the morning by the sound of a mouse rooting through her pack..Princess Nell uttered a light making spell that Purple had taught her, kindling a ball of luminance that hung in the air in the center of the room.The words of the spell had been concealed in the howl of the mountain winds through the rickety structure of the old inn, and so the mouse was caught entirely by surprise, blinded by the sudden light.Nell was startled to see that the mouse was not gnawing its way into her supply of food, as any mouse should have done, but rather was going through some of her papers.And this was not the usual destructive search for nesting material this mouse knew how to read and was looking for information.Princess Nell trapped the mouse spy under her hands."What are you looking for?Tell me, and I shall let you escape!"she said.Her adventures had taught her to be on the lookout for tricks of all kinds, and it was important that she learn who had dispatched this tiny, but effective, spy."I am but a harmless mouse!"the spy squealed."I do not even desire your food information only!""I will give you a big piece of cheese, all to yourself, if you give me some information," Princess Nell said.She caught the mouse's tail and lifted him up into the air so that they could talk face to face.Meanwhile, with her other hand, she loosened the drawstring of her bag and drew out a nice piece of blue veined Stilton."We are seeking our lost Queen," the mouse said."I can assure you that none of my papers have any information about a missing mouse monarch," Princess Nell said."What is your name?"the mouse said."That is none of your business, spy!"Princess Nell said."I will ask the questions. ""But it is very important that I know your name," the mouse said."Why?I am not a mouse.I have not seen any little mice with crowns on their heads. "The mouse spy said nothing.He was staring carefully at Princess Nell with his little beady eyes."Did you, by any chance, come from an enchanted island?""You have been listening to too many fairy tales," Princess Nell said, barely concealing her astonishment."You have been most uncooperative and so do not deserve any cheese but I admire your pluck and so will give you some anyway.Enjoy yourself!"She set the mouse down on the floor and took out her knife to cut off a bit of the cheese; but by the time she was finished, the mouse had disappeared.She just caught sight of his pink tail disappearing under the door.The next morning, she found him dead on the hallway floor.The innkeeper's cat had caught him..So the Mouse Army did exist!Princess Nell wondered whether they had ever located their lost Queen.She followed their trail for another day or two, as it went in approximately the right direction and was almost as convenient as a road.She passed through a few more campsites.At one of them, she even found a little gravesite, marked with a tiny headstone carved from a chip of soapstone.The carvings on this tiny monument were much too small to see.But Princess Nell carried with her a magnifying glass that she had pilfered from the treasury of one of the Faery Kings, and so now she removed it from its padded box and its velvet bag and used it to examine the inscription.At the top of the stone was a little bas relief of a mouse knight, dressed in armor, with a sword in one hand, bowing before an empty throne.The inscription read,  Here lies Clover, tail and all  Her virtues far outweighed her flaws  She from the saddle took a fall  And perished 'neath her charger's paws.We know not if her final ride  Hath led her into Heaven or Hell  Wherever she doth now abide  She's loyal yet to Princess Nell.Princess Nell examined the remains of the fires, and the surfaces of the wood that the Mouse Army had cut, and the state of their droppings, and estimated that they had passed by here many weeks previously.One day she would rendezvous with them and find out why they had formed such an attachment to her; but for now, she had more pressing considerations....She'd have to see about the Mouse Army later.Today was Saturday, and on Saturday morning she always went down to the Leased Territories to visit her brother.She opened up the wardrobe in the corner of her sleeping room and took out her traveling dress.Sensing her intentions, the chaperone flew out of its niche in the back and whined over to the door.Even at her still tender age, just a few years past the threshold of womanhood, Nell had already had cause to be grateful for the presence of the droning chaperone pod that followed her everywhere when she ventured from home alone.Maturity had given her any number of features that would draw the attention of the opposite sex, and of women so inclined.Commentators rarely failed to mention her eyes, which were said to have a vaguely exotic appearance.There was nothing particularly unusual about their shape or size, and their color a tweedy blend of green and light brown flecked with gold did not make them stand out in a predominantly Anglo Saxon culture.But Nell's eyes had an appearance of feral alertness that seized the attention of anyone who met her.Neo Victorian society produced many young women who, though highly educated and well read, were still blank slates at Nell's age.But Nell's eyes told a different story.When she had been presented to society a few months ago, along with several other External Propagation girls at Miss Matheson's Academy, she had not been the prettiest girl at the dance, and certainly not the best dressed or most socially prominent.She had attracted a crowd of young men anyway.They did not do anything so obvious as mill around her; instead they tried to keep the distance between themselves and Nell below a certain maximum, so that wherever she went in the ballroom, the local density of young men in her area became unusually high.In particular she had excited the interest of a boy who was the nephew of an Equity Lord in Atlantis/Toronto.He had written her several ardent letters.She had responded saying that she did not wish to continue the relationship, and he had, perhaps with the help of a hidden monitor, encountered her and her chaperone pod one morning as she had been riding to Miss Matheson's Academy.She had reminded him of the recent termination of their relationship by declining to recognize him, but he had persisted anyway, and by the time she had reached the gates of the Academy, the chaperone pod had gathered enough evidence to support a formal sexual harassment accusation should Nell have wished to bring one.Of course she did not, because this would have created a cloud of opprobrium that would have blighted the young man's career.Instead, she excerpted one five second piece of the cine record from the chaperone pod: the one in which, approached by the young man, Nell said, "I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you have me at a disadvantage," and the young man, failing to appreciate the ramifications, pressed on as if he had not heard.Nell placed this information into a smart visiting card and arranged to have it dropped by the young man's family home.A formal apology was not long in coming, and she did not hear again from the young man.Now that she had been introduced to society, her preparations for a visit to the Leased Territories were just as elaborate as for any New Atlantis lady.Outside of New Atlantis, she and her chevaline were surrounded everywhere by a shell of hovering security pods serving as a first line of personal defense.A modern lady's chevaline was designed with a sort of Y shaped body that made it unnecessary to ride sidesaddle, so Nell was able to wear a fairly normal looking sort of dress: a bodice that took advantage of her fashionably narrow waist, so carefully honed on the Academy's exercise machines that it might have been turned on a lathe from walnut.Beyond that, her skirts, sleeves, collar, and hat saw to it that none of the young ruffians of the Leased Territories would have the opportunity to invade her body space with their eyes, and lest her distinctive face prove too much of a temptation, she wore a veil too.The veil was a field of microscopic, umbrellalike aerostats programmed to fly in a sheet formation a few inches in front of Nell's face.The umbrellas were all pointed away from her.Normally they were furled, which made them nearly invisible; they looked like the merest shadow before her face, though viewed sideways they created a subtle wall of shimmer in the air.At a command from Nell they would open to some degree.When fully open, they nearly touched each other.The outside facing surfaces were reflective, the inner ones matte black, so Nell could see out as if she were looking through a piece of smoked glass.But others saw only the shimmering veil.The umbrellas could be programmed to dangle in different ways always maintaining the same collective shape, like a fencing mask, or rippling like a sheet of fine silk, depending on the current mode.The veil offered Nell protection from unwanted scrutiny.Many New Atlantis career women also used the veil as a way of meeting the world on their own terms, ensuring that they were judged on their own merits and not on their appearance.It served a protective function as well, bouncing back the harmful rays of the sun and intercepting many deleterious nanosites that might otherwise slip unhindered into the nose and mouth.The latter function was of particular concern to Constable Moore on this morning."It's been nasty of late," he said."The fighting has been very bad. "Nell had already inferred this from certain peculiarities of the Constable's behavior: he had been staying up late at night recently, managing some complicated enterprise spread out across his mediatronic floor, and she suspected that it was something along the lines of a battle or even a war.As she rode her chevaline across Dovetail, she came to a height of land that afforded a fine view across the Leased Territories, Pudong, and Shanghai on a clear day.But the humidity had congealed into drifts of clouds forming a seamless layer about a thousand feet below their level, so that this high territory at the top of New Chusan seemed to be an island, the only land in all the world except for the snowcapped cone of the Nippon Clave a few miles up the coast.She departed through the main gate and rode down the hill.She kept approaching the cloud layer but never quite reached it; the lower she went, the softer the light became, and after a few minutes she could no longer see the rambling settlements of Dovetail when she turned around, nor the spires of St.Mark's and Source Victoria above it.After another few minutes' descent the fog became so thick that she could not see more than a few meters, and she smelled the elemental reek of the ocean.She passed the former site of the Sendero Clave.The Senderos had been bloodily uprooted when Protocol Enforcement figured out that they were working in concert with the New Taiping Rebels, a fanatical cult opposed to both the Fists and the Coastal Republic.This patch of real estate had since passed into the hands of the Dong, an ethnic minority tribe from southwestern China, driven out of their homeland by the civil war.They had torn down the high wall and thrown up one of their distinctive many layered pagodas.Other than that, the L. T.  didn't look all that different.The operators of the big wall size mediatrons that had so terrified Nell on her first night in the Leased Territories had turned the brightness all the way up, trying to compensate for the fog.Down by the waterfront, not far from the Aerodrome, the compilers of New Chusan had, as a charitable gesture, made some space available to the Vatican.In the early years it had contained nothing more than a twostory mission for thetes who had followed their lifestyle to its logical conclusion and found themselves homeless, addicted, hounded by debtors, or on the run from the law or abusive members of their own families.More recently those had become secondary functions, and the Vatican had programmed the building's foundation to extrude many more stories.The Vatican had a number of serious ethical concerns about nanotech but had eventually decided that it was okay as long as it didn't mess about with DNA or create direct interfaces with the human brain.Using nanotech to extrude buildings was fine, and that was fortunate, because Vatican/Shanghai needed to add a couple of floors to the Free Phthisis Sanatorium every year.Now it loomed high above any of the other waterfront buildings.As with any other extruded building, the design was drab in the extreme, each floor exactly alike.The walls were of an unexceptional beige material that had been used to construct many of the buildings in the L. T. , which was unfortunate, because it had an almost magnetic attraction for the cineritious corpses of airborne mites.Like all the other buildings so constituted, the Free Phthisis Sanatorium had, over the years, turned black, and not evenly but in vertical rain streaks.It was a clich to joke that the outside of the Sanatorium looked much like the inside of its tenants' lungs.The Fists of Righteous Harmony had, however, done their best to pretty it up by slapping red posters over it in the dead of night.Harv was lying on the top of a three layer bunkbed on the twentieth floor, sharing a small room and a supply of purified air with a dozen other chronic asthma sufferers.His face was goggled into a phantascope, and his lips were wrapped around a thick tube plugged into a nebulizer socket on the wall.Vaporized drugs, straight from the matter compiler, were flowing down that tube and into his lungs, working to keep his bronchi from spasming shut.Nell stopped for a moment before breaking him out of his ractive.Some weeks he looked better than others; this week he did not look good.His body was bloated, his face round and heavy, his fingers swollen to puffy cylinders; they had been giving him heavy steroid treatments.But she would have known he'd had a bad week anyway, because usually Harv didn't go in for immersive ractives.He liked the kind you held in your lap on a sheet of smart paper.Nell tried to send Harv a letter every day, simply written in mediaglyphics, and for a while he had tried to respond in kind.Last year he had even given up on this, though she wrote him faithfully anyway."Nell!"he said when he had peeled the goggles away from his eyes."Sorry, I was chasing some rich Vickys. ""You were?""Yeah.Or Burly Scudd was, I mean.In the ractive.See, Burly's bitch gets pregnant, and she's got to buy herself a Freedom Machine to get rid of it, so she gets a job as a maid of all work for some snotty Vickys and rips off some of their nice old stuff, figuring that's a faster way to get the money.So the bitch is running away and they're chasing her on their chevs, and then Burly Scudd shows up in his big truck and turns the tables and starts chasing them.If you do it right, you can get the Vickys to fall into a big pit of manure!It's great!You should try it," Harv said, then, exhausted by this effort, grabbed his oxygen tube and pulled on it for a while."It sounds entertaining," Nell said.Harv, temporarily gagged by the oxygen tube, watched her face carefully and was not convinced."Sorry," he blurted between breaths, "forgot you don't care for my kind of ractive.Don't they have Burly Scudd in that Primer of yours?"Nell made herself smile at the joke, which Harv had been making every week.She handed him the basket of cookies and fresh fruit that she had brought down from Dovetail and sat with him for an hour, talking about the things he enjoyed talking about, until she could see his attention wandering back toward the goggles.Then she said good bye until next week and kissed him good bye.She turned her veil to its highest level of opacity and made her way toward the door.Harv impulsively grabbed his oxygen tube and sucked on it mightily a few times, then called her name just as she was about to leave."Yes?"she said, turning toward him."Nell, I want to tell you how fine you look," he said, "just like the finest Vicky lady in all of Atlantis.I can't believe you're my same Nell that I used to bring things to in the old flat remember those days?I know that you and I have gone different ways, ever since that morning in Dovetail, and I know it's got a lot to do with that Primer.I just want to tell you, sister, that even though I say bad stuff about Vickys sometimes, I'm as proud of you as I could be, and I hope when you read that Primer so full of stuff I could never understand or even read you'll think back on your brother Harv, who saw it lying in the gutter years ago and took it into  his mind to bring it to his kid sister.Will you remember that, Nell?"With that he plugged the oxygen tube back into his mouth, and his ribs began to heave."Of course I will, Harv," Nell said, her eyes filling with tears, and blundered her way back across the room until she could sweep Harv's bloated body up in her strong arms.The veil swirled like a sheet of water thrown into Harv's face, all the little umbrellas drawing themselves out of the way as she brought his face up to hers and planted a kiss on his cheek.The veil congealed again as he sank back down onto the foam mattress just like the mattresses he had taught her to get from the M. C. , long ago and she turned and ran out of the room sobbing.Hackworth is brought up to date by the great Napier."Have you had the opportunity to speak with your family?"Colonel Napier said, speaking out of a mediatronic tabletop from his office in Atlantis/Shanghai.Hackworth was sitting in a pub in Atlantis/Vancouver.Napier looked good now that he was deeper into middle age somewhat more imposing.He'd been working on his bearing.Hackworth had been temporarily impressed when Napier's image had first materialized on the mediatron, then he remembered his own image in the mirror.Once he'd gotten himself cleaned up and trimmed his beard, which he'd decided to keep, he realized that he had a new bearing of his own.Even if he was desperately confused about how he got it."Thought I'd find out what the hell happened first.Besides " He stopped talking for a while.He was having trouble getting his conversational rhythm back."Yes?"Napier said in a labored display of patience."I just spoke to Fiona this morning. ""After you left the tunnels?""No.Before.Before I woke up, or whatever. "Napier was slightly taken aback and only popped his jaw muscles a couple of times, reached for his tea, looked irrelevantly out the window at whatever view he had out his office window in New Chusan.Hackworth, on the other side of the Pacific, contented himself with staring into the inky depths of a pint of stout.A dream image surfaced in Hackworth's mind, like a piece of debris rising to the surface after a shipwreck, inexorably muscling tons of green murk out of its path.He saw a glistening blue projectile shoot into the Doctor's beige gloved hands, trailing a thick cord, watched it unfold, nay bloom into a baby."Why did I think of that?"he said.Napier seemed puzzled by this remark."Fiona and Gwendolyn are in Atlantis/Seattle now half an hour from your present location by tube," he said."Of course!They live we live in Seattle now.I knew that. "He was remembering Fiona hiking around in the caldera of some snow covered volcano."If you are under the impression that you've been in contact with her recently which is quite out of the question, I'm afraid then it must have been mediated through the Primer.We were not able to break the encryption on the signals passing out of the Drummers' cave, but traffic analysis suggests that you've spent a lot of time racting in the last ten years. ""Ten years!?""Yes.But surely you must have suspected that, from evidence. ""It feels like ten years.I sense that ten years of things have happened to me.But the engineer hemisphere has a bit of trouble coming to grips. ""We are at a loss to understand why Dr.X would choose to have you serve out your sentence among the Drummers," Napier said."It would seem to us that your engineer hemisphere, as you put it, is your most desirable feature as far as he is concerned you know that the Celestials are still terribly short of engineers. ""I've been working on something," Hackworth said.Images of a nanotechnological system, something admirably compact and elegant, were flashing over his mind's eye.It seemed to be very nice work, the kind of thing he could produce only when he was concentrating very hard for a long time.As, for example, a prisoner might do."What sort of thing exactly?"Napier asked, suddenly sounding rather tense."Can't get a grip on it," Hackworth finally said, shaking his head helplessly.The detailed images of atoms and bonds had been replaced, in his mind's eye, by a fat brown seed hanging in space, like something in a Magritte painting.A lush bifurcated curve on one end, like buttocks, converging to a nipplelike point on the other."What the hell happened?""Before you left Shanghai, Dr.X hooked you up to a matter compiler, no?""Yes. ""Did he tell you what he was putting into your system?""I guessed it was hmocules of some description. ""We took blood samples before you left Shanghai. ""You did?""We have ways," Colonel Napier said."We also did a full workup on one of your friends from the cave and found several million nanosites in her brain. ""Several million?""Very small ones," Napier said reassuringly."They are introduced through the blood, of course the hmocules circulate through the bloodstream until they find themselves passing through capillaries in the brain, at which point they cut through the blood/brain barrier and fasten themselves to a nearby axon.They can monitor activity in the axon or trigger it.These 'sites all talk to each other with visible light. ""So when I was on my own, my 'sites just talked to themselves," Hackworth said, "but when I came into close proximity with other people who had these things in their brains "  "It didn't matter which brain a 'site was in.They all talked to one another indiscriminately, forming a network.Get some Drummers together in a dark room, and they become a gestalt society. ""But the interface between these nanosites and the brain itself "  "Yes, I admit that a few million of these things piggybacking on randomly chosen neurons is only a feeble interface to something as complicated as the human brain," Napier said."We're not claiming that you shared one brain with these people. ""So what did I share with them exactly?"Hackworth said."Food.Air.Companionship.Body fluids.Perhaps emotions or general emotional states.Probably more. ""That's all I did for ten years?""You did a lot of things," Napier said, "but you did them in a sort of unconscious, dreamlike state.You were sleepwalking.When we figured that out after doing the biopsy on your fellow troglodyte we realised that in some sense you were no longer acting of your own free will, and we engineered a hunter killer that would seek out and destroy the nanosites in your brain.We introduced it, in a dormant mode, into this female Drummer's system, then reintroduced her to your colony.When you had sex with her well, you can work out the rest for yourself. ""You have given me information, Colonel Napier, and I am grateful, but it has only made me more confused.What do you suppose the Celestial Kingdom wanted with me?""Did Dr.X ask anything of you?""To seek the Alchemist. "Colonel Napier looked startled."He asked that of you ten years ago?""Yes.In as many words. ""That is very singular," Napier said, after a prolonged interlude of mustache twiddling."We have only been aware of this shadowy figure for some five years and know virtually nothing about him other than that he is a wizardly artifex who is conspiring with Dr.X. ""Is there any other information "  "Nothing that I can reveal," Napier said brusquely, perhaps having revealed too much already."Do let us know if you find him, though.Er, Hackworth, there is no tactful way to broach this subject.Are you aware that your wife has divorced you?""Oh, yes," Hackworth said quietly."I suppose I did know that. "But he hadn't been conscious of it until now."She was remarkably understanding about your long absence," Napier said, "but at some point it became evident that, like all the Drummers, you had become sexually promiscuous in the extreme. ""How did she know?""We warned her. ""Pardon me?""I mentioned earlier that we found things in your blood.These hmocules were designed specifically to be spread through exchange of bodily fluids. ""How do you know that?"Napier seemed impatient for the first time."For god's sake, man, we know what we are doing.These particles had two functions: spread through exchange of bodily fluids, and interact with each other.Once we saw that, we had no ethical choice but to inform your wife. ""Of course.That's only right.As a matter of fact, I thank you for it," Hackworth said."And it's not hard to understand Gwen's feelings about sharing bodily fluids with thousands of Drummers. ""You shouldn't beat yourself up," Napier said."We've sent explorers down there. ""Really?""Yes.The Drummers don't mind.The explorers relate that the Drummers behave much the way people do in dreams.'Poorly defined ego boundaries' was the phrase, as I recall.In any event, your behaviour down there wasn't necessarily a moral transgression as such your mind wasn't your own. ""You said that these particles interact with each other?""Each one is a container for some rod logic and some memory," Napier said."When one particle encounters another either in vivo or in vitro, they dock and seem to exchange data for a few moments.Most of the time they disengage and drift apart.Sometimes they stay docked for a while, and computation takes place we can tell because the rod logic throws off heat.Then they disconnect.Sometimes both particles go their separate ways, sometimes one of them goes dead.But one of them always keeps going. "The implications of that last sentence were not lost on Hackworth."Do the Drummers only have sex with one another, or "  "That was our first question too," Napier said."The answer is no.They have a very good deal of sex with many, many other people.They actually run bordellos in Vancouver.They cater especially to the Aerodrome and tube station crowd.A few years ago they came into conflict with the established bordellos because they were hardly charging any money at all for their services.They raised their prices just to be diplomatic.But they don't want the money what on earth would they do with it?"From the Primer, a visit to Castle Turing;  a final chat with Miss Matheson;  speculation as to Nell's destiny;  farewell;  conversation with a grizzled hoplite;  Nell goes forth to seek her fortune.The new territory into which Princess Nell had crossed was by far the largest and most complex of all the Faery Kingdoms in the Primer.Paging back to the first panoramic illustration, she counted seven major castles perched on the mountaintops, and she knew perfectly well that she would have to visit all of them, and do something difficult in each one, in order to retrieve the eleven keys that had been stolen from her and the one key that remained.She made herself some tea and sandwiches and carried them in a basket to a meadow, where she liked to sit among the wildflowers and read.Constable Moore's house was a melancholy place without the Constable in it, and it had been several weeks since she had seen him.During the last two years he had been called away on business with increasingfrequency, vanishing (as she supposed) into the interior of China for days, then weeks at a time, coming back depressed and exhausted to find solace in whiskey, which he consumed in surprisingly moderate quantities but with fierce concentration, and in midnight bagpipe recitals that woke up everyone in Dovetail and a few sensitive sleepers in the New Atlantis Clave.During her trip from the campsite of the Mouse Army to the first of the castles, Nell had to use all the wilderness skills she had learned in years of traveling around the Land Beyond: She fought with a mountain lion, avoided a bear, forded streams, lit fires, built shelters.By the time Nell had maneuvered Princess Nell to the ancient moss covered gates of the first castle, the sun was shining horizontally across the meadow and the air was becoming a bit chilly.Nell wrapped herself up in a thermogenic shawl and set the thermostat for something a little on the cool side of comfortable; she had found that her wits became dull if she got too cozy.The basket had a thermos of hot tea with milk, and the sandwiches would hold out for a while.The highest of the castle's many towers was surmounted by a great four sailed windmill that turned steadily, even though only a mild breeze could be noticed at Princess Nell's altitude, hundreds of feet below.Set into the main gate was a judas gate, and set into the judas was a small hatch.Below the hatch was a great bronze knocker made in the shape of a letter T, though its shape had become indistinct from an encrustation of moss and lichens.Princess Nell operated the knocker only with some effort and, given its decrepit state, did not expect a response; but hardly had the first knock sounded than the hatch opened up, and she was confronted by a helmet: For the gatekeeper on the other side was dressed from head to toe in a rusty and moss covered suit of battle armor.But the gatekeeper said nothing, simply stared at Princess Nell; or so she assumed, as she could not see his face through the helmet's narrow vision slits."Good afternoon," said Princess Nell."I beg your pardon, but I am a traveler in these parts, and I wonder if you would be so good as to give me a place to stay for the night. "Without a word, the gatekeeper slammed the hatch closed.Nell could hear the creaking and clanking of his armor as he slowly marched away.Some minutes later, she heard him coming toward her again, though this time the noise was redoubled.The rusty locks on the judas gate grumbled and shrieked.The gate door swung open, and Princess Nell stepped back from it as rust flakes, fragments of lichens, and divots of moss showered down around her.Two men in armor now stood there, beckoning her forward.Nell stepped through the gate and into the dark streets of the castle.The gate slammed behind her.An iron vise clamped around each of Princess Nell's upper arms; the men had seized her with their gauntlets.They lifted her into the air and carried her for some minutes through the streets, stairs, and corridors of the castle.These were completely deserted.She did not see so much as a mouse or a rat.No smoke rose from the chimneys, no light came from any window, and in the long hallway leading to the throne room, the torches hung cold and blackened in their sconces.From place to place Princess Nell saw another armored soldier standing at attention, but, as none of them moved, she did not know whether these were empty suits of armor or real men.Nowhere did she see the usual signs of commerce and human activity: horse manure, orange peels, barking dogs, running sewers.Somewhat to her alarm, she did see an inordinate number of chains.The chains were all of the same, somewhat peculiar design, and she saw them everywhere: piled up in heaps on streetcorners, overflowing from metal baskets, dangling from rooftops, strung between towers.The clanking and squeaking of the men who bore her along made it difficult for her to hear anything else; but as they proceeded higher and deeper into the castle, she slowly became conscious of a deep grinding, growling noise that pervaded the very ashlars.This noise crescendoed as they hustled down the long final hallway, and became nearly earth shaking as they finally entered the vaulted throne room at the very heart of the castle.The room was dark and cold, though some light was admitted by clerestory windows high up in the vaults.The walls were lined with men in armor, standing stock still.Sitting in the middle of the room, on a throne twice as high as a man, was a giant, dressed in a suit of armor that gleamed like a looking glass.Standing below him was a man in armor holding a rag and a wire brush, vigorously buffing one of the lord's greaves."Welcome to Castle Turing," said the lord in a metallic voice.By this time, Princess Nell's eyes had adjusted to the dimness, and she could see something else behind the throne: a tremendous Shaft, as thick as the mainmast of a dromond, made of the trunk of a great tree bound and reinforced with brass plates and bands.The Shaft turned steadily, and Princess Nell realized that it must be transmitting the power of the giant windmill far above them.Enormous gears, black and sticky with grease, were attached to the Shaft and transferred its power to other, smaller shafts that ran off horizontally in every direction and disappeared through holes in the walls.The turning and grinding of all these shafts and gears made the omnipresent noise she had noted earlier.One horizontal shaft ran along each wall of the throne room at about the height of a man's chest.This shaft passed through a gearbox at short, regular intervals.A stubby, square shaft projected from each gearbox at a right angle, sticking straight out of the wall.These gearboxes tended to coincide with the locations of the soldiers.The soldier who was polishing the lord's armor worked his way around to one of the lord's spiked knee protectors and, in so doing, turned his back on Princess Nell.She was startled to see a large square hole in the middle of his back.Nell knew, vaguely, that the name Castle Turing was a hint; she'd learned a bit about Turing at Miss Matheson's Academy.He had something to do with computers.She could have turned to the Encyclopdia pages and looked it right up, but she had learned to let the Primer tell the story its own way.Clearly the soldiers were not men in armor, but simply wind up men, and the same was probably true of the Duke of Turing himself.After a short and not very interesting conversation, during which Princess Nell tried unsuccessfully to establish whether the Duke was or was not human, he announced, unemotionally, that he was throwing her into the dungeon forever.This sort of thing no longer surprised or upset Nell because it had happened hundreds of times during her relationship with the Primer.Besides, she had known, from the very first day Harv had given her the book, how the story would come out in the end.It was just that the story was anfractuous; it developed more ramifications the more closely she read it.One of the soldiers detached himself from his gearbox on the wall, stomped into the corner, and picked up a metal basket filled with one of those peculiar chains Princess Nell had seen everywhere.He carried it to the throne, fished through it until he found the end, and fed the end into a hole on the side of the throne.In the meantime, a second soldier had also detached himself from the wall and taken up a position on the opposite side of the throne.This soldier flipped his visor open to expose some sort of mechanical device in the space where his head ought to have been.A tremendous chattering noise arose from inside the throne.The second soldier caught the end of the chain as it was emerging from his side and fed it into the opening in his visor.A moment later it popped out of a hatch on his chest.
