An atmosphere of love?Because Buffy is doing fine, as sleek as an otter.I groom and comb him every other day.At an oil painting Phil Resch halted, gazed intently.The painting showed a hairless, oppressed creature with a head like an inverted pear, its hands clapped in horror to its ears, its mouth open in a vast, soundless scream.Twisted ripples of the creatures torment, echoes of its cry, flooded out into the air surrounding it; the man or woman, whichever it was, had become contained by its own howl.It had covered its ears against its own sound.The creature stood on a bridge and no one else was present; the creature screamed in isolation.Cut off byor despiteits outcry.He did a woodcut of this, Rick said, reading the card tacked below the painting.I think, Phil Resch said, that this is how an andy must feet.He traced in the air the convolutions, visible in the picture, of the creatures cry.I dont feel like that, so maybe Im not an He broke off, as several persons strolled up to inspect the picture.Theres Luba Luft.Rick pointed and Phil Resch halted his somber introspection and defense; the two of them walked at a measured pace toward her, taking their time as if nothing confronted them; as always it was vital to preserve the atmosphere of the commonplace.Other humans, having no knowledge of the presence of androids among them, had to be protected at all costseven that of losing the quarry.Holding a printed catalogue, Luba Luft, wearing shiny tapered pants and an illuminated gold vestlike top, stood absorbed in the picture before her: a drawing of a young girl, hands clasped together, seated on the edge of a bed, an expression of bewildered wonder and new, groping awe imprinted on the face.Want me to buy it for you?Rick said to Luba Luft; he stood beside her, holding laxly onto her upper arm, informing her by his loose grip that he knew he had possession of herhe did not have to strain in an effort to detain her.On the other side of her Phil Resch put his hand on her shoulder and Rick saw the bulge of the laser tube.Phil Resch did not intend to take chances, not after the near miss with Inspector Garland.Its not for sale.Luba Luft glanced at him idly, then violently as she recognized him; her eyes faded and the color dimmed from her face, leaving it cadaverous, as if already starting to decay.As if life had in an instant retreated to some point far inside her, leaving the body to its automatic ruin.I thought they arrested you.Do you mean they let you go?Miss Luft, he said, this is Mr.Resch.Phil Resch, this is the quite well known opera singer Luba Luft.To Luba he said, The harness bull that arrested me is an android.So was his superior.Do you knowdid you knowan Inspector Garland?He told me that you all came here in one ship as a group.The police department which you called, Phil Resch said to her, operating out of a building on Mission, is the organizing agency by which it would appear your group keeps in touch.They even feel confident enough to hire a human bounty hunter; evidently  You?Luba Luft said.Youre not human.No more than I am: youre an android, too.An interval of silence passed and then Phil Resch said in a low but controlled voice, Well, well deal with that at the proper time.To Rick he said, Lets take her to my car.One of them on each side of her they prodded her in the direction of the museum elevator.Luba Luft did not come willingly, but on the other hand she did not actively resist; seemingly she had become resigned.Rick had seen that before in androids, in crucial situations.The artificial life force animating them seemed to fail if pressed too far  at least in some of them.But not all.And it could flare up again furiously.Androids, however, had as he knew an innate desire to remain inconspicuous.In the museum, with so many people roaming around, Luba Luft would tend to do nothing.The real encounterfor her probably the final onewould take place in the car, where no one else could see.Alone, with appalling abruptness, she could shed her inhibitions.He prepared himselfand did not think about Phil Resch.As Resch had said, it would be dealt with at a proper time.At the end of the corridor near the elevators, a little store like affair had been set up; it sold prints and art books, and Luba halted there, tarrying.Listen, she said to Rick.Some of the color had returned to her face; once more she lookedat least brieflyalive.Buy me a reproduction of that picture I was looking at when you found me.The one of the girt sitting on the bed.After a pause Rick said to the clerk, a heavy jowled, middle aged woman with netted gray hair, Do you have a print of Munchs Puberty?Only in this book of his collected work, the clerk said, lifting down a handsome glossy volume.Twent five dollars.Ill take it.He reached for his wallet.Phil Resch said, My departmental budget could never in a million years be stretched  My own money, Rick said; he handed the woman the bills and Luba the book.Now lets get started down, he said to her and Phil Resch.Its very nice of you, Luba said as they entered the elevator.Theres something very strange and touching about humans.An android would never have done that.She glanced icily at Phil Resch.It wouldnt have occurred to him; as he said, never in a million years.She continued to gaze at Resch, now with manifold hostility and aversion.I really dont like androids.Ever since I got here from Mars my life has consisted of imitating the human, doing what she would do, acting as if I had the thoughts and impulses a human would have.Imitating, as far as Im concerned, a superior life form.To Phil Resch she said, Isnt that how its been with you, Resch?Trying to be  I cant take this.Phil Resch dug into his coat, groped.No, Rick said; he grabbed at Phil Reschs hand; Resch retreated, eluding him.The Boneli test, Rick said.Its admitted its an android, Phil Resch said.We dont have to wait.But to retire it, Rick said, because its needling you give me that.He struggled to pry the laser tube away from Phil Resch.The tube remained in Phil Reschs possession; Resch circled back within the cramped elevator, evading him, his attention on Luba Luft only.Okay, Rick said.Retire it; kill it now.Show it that its right.He saw, then, that Resch meant to.Wait  Phil Resch fired, and at the same instant Luba Luft, in a spasm of frantic hunted fear, twisted and spun away, dropping as she did so.The beam missed its mark but, as Resch lowered it, burrowed a narrow hole, silently, into her stomach.She began to scream; she lay crouched against the wall of the elevator, screaming.Like the picture, Rick thought to himself, and, with his own laser tube, killed her.Luba Lufts body fell forward, face down, in a heap.It did not even tremble.With his laser tube, Rick systematically burned into blurred ash the book of pictures which he had just a few minutes ago bought Luba.He did the job thoroughly, saying nothing; Phil Resch watched without understanding, his face showing his perplexity.You could have kept the book yourself, Resch said, when it had been done.That cost you  Do you think androids have souls?Rick interrupted.Cocking his head on one side, Phil Resch gazed at him in even greater puzzlement.I could afford the book, Rick said.Ive made three thousand dollars so far today, and Im not even half through.Youre claiming Garland?Phil Resch asked.But I killed him, not you.You just lay there.And Luba, too.I got her.You cant collect, Rick said.Not from your own department and not from ours.When we get to your car Ill administer the Boneli test or the Voigt Kampff to you and then well see.Even though youre not on my list.His hands shaking, he opened his briefcase, rummaged among the crumpled onionskin carbons.No, youre not here.So legally I cant claim you; to make anything Ill have to claim Luba Luft and Garland.Youre sure Im an android?Is that really what Garland said?Thats what Garland said.Maybe he was lying, Phil Resch said.To split us apart.As we are now.Were nuts, letting them split us; you were absolutely right about Luba LuftI shouldnt have let her get my goat like that.I must be overly sensitive.That would be natural for a bounty hunter, I suppose; youre probably the same way.But look; we would have had to retire Luba Luft anyhow, half an hour from nowonly one half hour more.She wouldnt even have had time to look through that book you got her.And I still think you shouldnt have destroyed it; thats a waste.I cant.follow your reasoning; it isnt rational, thats why.Rick said, Im getting out of this business.And go into what?Anything.Insurance underwriting, like Garland was supposed to be doing.Or Ill emigrate.Yes.He nodded.Ill go to Mars.But someone has to do this, Phil Resch pointed out.They can use androids.Much better if andys do it.I cant any more; Ive had enough.She was a wonderful singer.The planet could have used her.This is insane.This is necessary.Remember: they killed humans in order to get away.And if I hadnt gotten you out of the Mission police station they would have killed you.Thats what Garland wanted me for; thats why he had me come down to his office.Didnt Polokov almost kill you?Didnt Luba Luft almost?Were acting defensively; theyre here on our planettheyre murderous illegal aliens masquerading as  As police, Rick said.As bounty hunters.Okay; give me the Boneli test.Maybe Garland lied.I think he didfalse memories just arent that good.What about my squirrel?Yes, your squirrel.I forgot about your squirrel.If Im an andy, Phil Resch said, and you kill me, you can have my squirrel.Here; Ill write it out, willing it to you.Andys cant will anything.They cant possess anything to will.Then just take it, Phil Resch said.Maybe so, Rick said.The elevator had reached the first floor, now; its doors opened.You stay with Luba; Ill get a patrol car here to take her to the Hall of justice.For her bone marrow test.He saw a phone booth, entered it, dropped in a coin, and, his fingers shaking, dialed.Meanwhile a group of people, who had been waiting for the elevator, gathered around Phil Resch and the body of Luba Luft.She was really a superb singer, he said to himself as he hung up the receiver, his call completed.I dont get it; how can a talent like that be a liability to our society?But it wasnt the talent, he told himself; it was she herself.As Phil Resch is, he thought.Hes a menace in exactly the same way, for the same reasons.So I cant quit now.Emerging from the phone booth he pushed his way among the people, back to Resch and the prone figure of the android girl.Someone had put a coat over her.Not Reschs.Going up to Phil Reschwho stood off to one side vigorously smoking a small gray cigarhe said to him, I hope to god you do test out as an android.You realty hate me, Phil Resch said, marveling.All of a sudden; you didnt hate me back on Mission Street.Not while I was saving your life.I see a pattern.The way you killed Garland and then the way you killed Luba.You dont kill the way I do; you dont try toHell, he said, I know what it is.You like to kill.All you need is a pretext.If you had a pretext youd kill me.Thats why you picked up on the possibility of Garland being an android; it made him available for being killed.I wonder what youre going to do when you fail to pass the Boneli test.Will you kill yourself?Sometimes androids do that.But the situation was rare.Yes, Ill take care of it, Phil Resch said.You wont have to do anything, besides administering the test.A patrol car arrived; two policemen hopped out, strode up, saw the crowd of people and at once cleared themselves a passage through.One of them recognized Rick and nodded.So we can go now, Rick realized.Our business here is concluded.Finally.As he and Resch walked back down the street to the opera house, on whose roof their hovercar lay parked, Resch said, Ill give you my laser tube now.So you wont have to worry about my reaction to the test.In terms of your own personal safety.He held out the tube and Rick accepted it.Howll you kill yourself without it?Rick asked.If you fail on the test?Ill hold my breath.Chrissake, Rick said.It cant be done.Theres no automatic cut in of the vagus nerve, Phil Resch said, in an android.As there is in a human.Werent you taught that when they trained you?I got taught that years ago.But to die that way, Rick protested.Theres no pain.Whats the matter with it?Its He gestured.Unable to find the right words.I dont really think Im going to have to, Phil Resch said.Together they ascended to the roof of the War Memorial Opera House and Phil Reschs parked hovercar.Sliding behind the wheel and closing his door, Phil Resch said, I would prefer it if you used the Boneli test.I cant.I dont know how to score it.I would have to rely on you for an interpretation of the readings, he realized.And thats out of the question.Youll tell me the truth, wont you?Phil Resch asked.If Im an android youll tell me?Sure.Because I really want to know.I have to know.Phil Resch relit his cigar, shifted about on the bucket seat of the car, trying to make himself comfortable.Evidently he could not.Did you really like that Munch picture that Luba Luft was looking at?he asked.I didnt care for it.Realism in art doesnt interest me; I like Picasso and  Puberty dates from 1894, Rick said shortly.Nothing but realism existed then; you have to take that into account.But that other one, of the man holding his ears and yellingthat wasnt representational.Opening his briefcase, Rick fished out his test gear.Elaborate, Phil Resch observed, watching.How many questions do you have to ask before you can make a determination?Six or seven.He handed the adhesive pad to Phil Resch.Attach that to your cheek.Firmly.And this light He aimed it.This stays focused on your eye.Dont move; keep your eyeball as steady as you can.Reflex fluctuations, Phil Resch said acutely.But not to the physical stimulus; youre not measuring dilation, for instance.Itll be to the verbal questions; what we call a flinch reaction.Rick said, Do you think you can control it?Not really.Eventually, maybe.But not the initial amplitude; thats outside conscious control.If it werent He broke off.Go ahead.Im tense; excuse me if I talk too much.Talk all you want, Rick said.Talk all the way to the tomb, he said to himself.If you feel like it.It didnt matter to him.If I test out android, Phil Resch prattled, youll undergo renewed faith in the human race.But, since its not going to work out that way, I suggest you begin framing an ideology which will account for  Heres the first question, Rick said; the gear had now been set up and the needles of the two dials quivered.Reaction time is a factor, so answer as rapidly as you can.From memory he selected an initial question.The test had begun.Afterward, Rick sat in silence for a time.Then he began gathering his gear together, stuffing it back in the briefcase.I can tell by your face, Phil Resch said; he exhaled in absolute, weightless, almost convulsive relief.Okay; you can give me my gun back.He reached out, his palm up, waiting.Evidently you were right, Rick said.About Garlands motives.Wanting to split us up; what you said.He felt both psychologically and physically weary.Do you have your ideology framed?Phil Resch asked.That would explain me as part of the human race?Rick said, There is a defect in your empathic, role taking ability.One which we dont test for.Your feelings toward androids.Of course we dont test for that.Maybe we should.He had never thought of it before, had never felt any empathy on his own part toward the androids he killed.Always fie had assumed that throughout his psyche he experienced the android as a clever machineas in his conscious view.And yet, in contrast to Phil Resch, a difference had manifested itself.And he felt instinctively that he was right.Empathy toward an artificial construct?he asked himself.Something that only pretends to be alive?But Luba Luft had seemed genuinely alive; it had not worn the aspect of a simulation.You realize, Phil Resch said quietly, what this would do.If we included androids in our range of empathic identification, as we do animals.We couldnt protect ourselves.Absolutely.These Nexus 6 types  theyd roll all over us and mash us flat.You and I, all the bounty hunterswe stand between the Nexus 6 and mankind, a barrier which keeps the two distinct.Furthermore He ceased, noticing that Rick was once again hauling out his test gear.I thought the test was over.I want to ask myself a question, Rick said.And I want you to tell me what the needles register.Just give me the calibration; I can compute it.He plastered the adhesive disk against his cheek, arranged the beam of light until it fed directly into his eye.Are you ready?Watch the dials.Well exclude time lapse in this; I just want magnitude.Sure, Rick, Phil Resch said obligingly.Aloud, Rick said, Im going down by elevator with an android Ive captured.And suddenly someone kills it, without warning.No particular response, Phil Resch said.Whatd the needles hit?The left one 2.8.The right one 3.3  Rick said, A female android.Now theyre up to 4.0 and 6.  respectively.Thats high enough, Rick said; he removed the wired adhesive disk from his cheek and shut off the beam of light.Thats an emphatically empathic response, he said.About what a human subject shows for most questions.Except for the extreme ones, such as those dealing with human pelts used decoratively  the truly pathological ones.Meaning?Rick said, Im capable of feeling empathy for at least specific, certain androids.Not for all of them butone or two.For Luba Luft, as an example, he said to himself.So I was wrong.Theres nothing unnatural or unhuman about Phil Reschs reactions; its me.I wonder, he wondered, if any human has ever felt this way before about an android.Of course, he reflected, this may never come up again in my work; it could be an anomaly, something for instance to do with my feelings for The Magic Flute.And for Lubas voice, in fact her career as a whole.Certainly this had never come up before; or at least not that he had been aware of.Not, for example, with Polokov.Nor with Garland.And, he realized, if Phil Resch had proved out android I could have killed him without feeling anything, anyhow after Lubas death.So much for the distinction between authentic living humans and humanoid constructs.In that elevator at the museum, he said to himself, I rode down with two creatures, one human, the other android  and my feelings were the reverse of those intended.Of those Im accustomed to feelam required to feel.Youre in a spot, Deckard, Phil Resch said; it seemed to amuse him.Rick said, Whatshould I do?Its sex, Phil Resch said.Sex?Because sheitwas physically attractive.Hasnt that ever happened to you before?Phil Resch laughed.We were taught that it constitutes a prime problem in bounty hunting.Dont you know, Deckard, that in the colonies they have android mistresses?Its illegal, Rick said, knowing the law about that.Sure its illegal.But most variations in sex are illegal.But people do it anvhow.What aboutnot sexbut love?Love is another name for sex.Like love of country, Rick said.Love of music.If its love toward a woman or an android imitation, its sex.Wake up and face yourself, Deckard.You wanted to go to bed with a female type of androidnothing more, nothing less.I felt that way, on one occasion.When I had just started bounty hunting.Dont let it get you down; youll heal.Whats happened is that youve got your order reversed.Dont kill heror be present when shes killedand then feel physically attracted.Do it the other way.Rick stared at him.Go to bed with her first  and then kill her, Phil Resch said succinctly.His grainy, hardened smile remained.Youre a good bounty hunter, Rick realized.Your attitude proves it.But am I?Suddenly, for the first time in his life, he had begun to wonder.13  Like an arc of pure fire, John R.  Isidore soared across the late afternoon sky on his way home from his job.I wonder if shes still there, he said to himself.Down in that kipple infested old apt, watching Buster Friendly on her TV set and quaking with fear every time she imagines someone coming down the hall.Including, I suppose, me.He had already stopped off at a blackmarket grocery store.On the seat beside him a bag of such delicacies as bean curd, ripe peaches, good soft evil smelling cheese rocked back and forth as he alternately speeded up and slowed down his car; being tense, tonight, he drove somewhat erratically.And his allegedly repaired car coughed and floundered, as it had been doing for months prior to overhaul.Rats, Isidore said to himself.The smell of peaches and cheese eddied about the car, filling his nose with pleasure.All rarities, for which he had squandered two weeks salaryborrowed in advance from Mr.Sloat.And, in addition, under the car seat where it could not roll and break, a bottle of Chablis wine knocked back and forth: the greatest rarity of all.He had been keeping it in a safety deposit box at the Bank of America, hanging onto it and not selling it no matter how much they offered, in case at some long, late, last moment a girl appeared.That had not happened, not until now.The rubbish littered, lifeless roof of his apartment building as always depressed him.Passing from his car to the elevator door he damped down his peripheral vision; he concentrated on the valuable bag and bottle which he carried, making certain that he tripped over no trash and took no ignominious pratfall to economic doom.When the elevator creakily arrived he rode itnot to his own floorbut to the lower level on which the new tenant, Pris Stratton, now lived.Presently he stood in front of her door, rapping with the edge of the wine bottle, his heart going to pieces inside his chest.Whos there?Her voice, muffled by the door and yet clear.A frightened, but blade sharp tone.This is J.  R.  Isidore speaking, he said briskly, adopting the new authority which he had so recently acquired via Mr.Sloats vidphone.I have a few desirable items here and I think we can put together a more than reasonable dinner.The door, to a limited extent, opened; Pris, no lights on in the room behind her, peered out into the dim hall.You sound different, she said.More grown up.I had a few routine matters to deal with during business hours today.The usual.If you c c could let me in  Youd talk about them.However, she held the door open wide enough for him to enter.And then, seeing what he carried, she exclaimed; her face ignited with elfin, exuberant glee.But almost at once, without warning, a lethal bitterness crossed her features, set concrete like in place.The glee had gone.What is it?he said; he carried the packages and bottle to the kitchen, set them down and hurried back.Tonelessly, Pris said, Theyre wasted on me.Why?Oh.She shrugged, walking aimlessly away, her hands in the pockets of her heavy, rather old fashioned skirt.Sometime Ill tell you.She raised her eyes, then.It was nice of you anyhow.Now I wish youd leave.I dont feel like seeing anyone.In a vague fashion she moved toward the door to the hall; her steps dragged and she seemed depleted, her store of energy fading almost out.I know whats the matter with you, he said.Oh?Her voice, as she reopened the hall door, dropped even further into uselessness, listless and barren.You dont have any friends.Youre a lot worse than when I saw you this morning; its because  I have friends.Sudden authority stiffened her voice; she palpably regained vigor.Or I had.Seven of them.That was to start with but now the bounty hunters have had time to get to work.So some of themmaybe all of themare dead.She wandered toward the window, gazed out at the blackness and the few lights here and there.I may be the only one of the eight of us left.So maybe youre right.Whats a bounty hunter?Thats right.You people arent supposed to know.A bounty hunter is a professional murderer whos given a list of those hes supposed to kill.Hes paid a suma thousand dollars is the going rate, I understandfor each he gets.Usually he has a contract with a city so he draws a salary as well.But they keep that low so hell have incentive.Are you sure?Isidore asked.Yes.She nodded.You mean am I sure he has incentive?Yes, he has incentive.He enjoys it.I think, Isidore said, Youre mistaken.Never in his life had he heard of such a thing.Buster Friendly, for instance, had never mentioned it.Its not in accord with present day Mercerian ethics, he pointed out.All life is one; no man is an island, as Shakespeare said in olden times.John Donne.Isidore gestured in agitation.Thats worse than anything I ever heard of.Cant you call the police?No.And theyre after you?Theyre apt to come here and kill you?He understood, now, why the girl acted in so secretive a fashion.No wonder youre scared and dont want to see anybody.But he thought, It must be a delusion.She must be psychotic.With delusions of persecution.Maybe from brain damage due to the dust; maybe shes a special.Ill get them first, he said.With what?Faintly, she smiled; she showed her small, even, white teeth  Ill get a license to carry a laser beam.Its easy to get, out here where theres hardly anybody; the police dont patrolyoure expected to watch out for yourself  How about when youre at work?Ill take a leave of absence!Pris said, Thats very nice of you, J.  R.  Isidore.But if bounty hunters got the others, got Max Polokov and Garland and Luba and Hasking and Roy Baty She broke off.Roy and Irmgard Baty.If theyre dead then it really doesnt matter.Theyre my best friends.Why the hell dont I hear from them, I wonder?She cursed, angrily.Making his way into the kitchen he got down dusty, long unused plates and bowls and glasses; he began washing them in the sink, running the rusty hot water until it clearedat last.Presently Pris appeared, seated herself at the table.He uncorked the bottle of Chablis, divided the peaches and the cheese and the bean curd.Whats that white stuff?Not the cheese.She pointed.Made from soy bean whey.I wish I had some He broke off, flushing.It used to be eaten with beef gravy.An android, Pris murmured.Thats the sort of slip an android makes.Thats what gives it away.She came over, stood beside him, and then to his stunned surprise put her arm around his waist and for an instant pressed against him.Ill try a slice of peach, she said, and gingerly picked out a slippery pink orange furry slice with her long fingers.And then, as she ate the slice of peach, she began to cry.Cold tears descended her cheeks, splashed on the bosom of her dress.He did not know what to do, so he continued dividing the food.Goddamn it, she said, furiously.Well She moved away from him, paced slowly, with measured steps, about the room.see, we lived on Mars.Thats how come I know androids.Her voice shook but she managed to continue; obviously it meant a great deal to her to have someone to talk to.And the only people on Earth that you know, Isidore said, are your fellow ex emigrants.We knew each other before the trip.A settlement near New New York.Roy Baty and Irmgard ran a drugstore; he was a pharmacist and she handled the beauty aids, the creams and ointments; on Mars they use a lot of skin conditioners.I She hesitated.I got various drugs from RoyI needed them at first becausewell, anyhow, its an awful place.This she swept in the room, the apartment, in one violent gesture this is nothing.You think Im suffering because Im lonely.Hell, all Mars is lonely.Much worse than this.Dont the androids keep you company?I heard a commercial on Seating himself he ate, and presently she too picked up the glass of wine; she sipped expressionlessly.I understood that the androids helped.The androids, she said, are lonely, too.Do you like the wine?She set down her glass.Its fine.Its the only bottle Ive seen in three years.We came back, Pris said, because nobody should have to live there.It wasnt conceived for habitation, at least not within the last billion years.Its so old.You feel it in the stones, the terrible old age.Anyhow, at first I got drugs from Roy; I lived for that new synthetic pain killer, that silenizine.And then I met Horst Hartman, who at that time ran a stamp store, rare postage stamps; theres so much time on your hands that youve got to have a hobby, something you can pore over endlessly.And Horst got me interested in pre colonial fiction.You mean old books?Stories written before space travel but about space travel.How could there have been stories about space travel before  The writers, Pris said, made it up.Based on what?On imagination.A lot of times they turned out wrong.For example they wrote about Venus being a jungle paradise with huge monsters and women in breastplates that glistened.She eyed him.Does that interest you?Big women with long braided blond hair and gleaming breastplates the size of melons?No, he said.Irmgard is blond, Pris said.But small.Anyhow, theres a fortune to be made in smuggling pre colonial fiction, the old magazines and books and films, to Mars.Nothing is as exciting.To read about cities and huge industrial enterprises, and really successful colonization.You can imagine what it might have been like.What Mars ought to be like.Canals.Canals?Dimly, he remembered reading about that; in the olden days they had believed in canals on Mars.Crisscrossing the planet, Pris said.And beings from other stars.With infinite wisdom.And stories about Earth, set in our time and even later.Where theres no radioactive dust.I would think, Isidore said, it would make you feel worse.It doesnt, Pris said curtly.Did you bring any of that pre colonial reading material back with you?It occurred to him that he ought to try some.Its worthless, here, because here on Earth the craze never caught on.Anyhow theres plenty here, in the libraries; thats where we get all of oursstolen from libraries here on Earth and shot by autorocket to Mars.Youre out at night humbling across the open space, and all of a sudden you see a flare, and theres a rocket, cracked open, with old pre colonial fiction magazines spilling out everywhere.A fortune.But of course you read them before you sell them.She warmed to her topic.Of all  A knock sounded on the hall door.Ashen, Pris whispered, I cant go.Dont make any noise; just sit.She strained, listening.I wonder if the doors locked, she said almost inaudibly.God, I hope so.Her eyes, wild and powerful, fixed themselves beseechingly on him, as if praying to him to make it true.A far off voice from the hall called, Pris, are you in there?A mans voice.Its Roy and Irmgard.We got your card.Rising and going into the bedroom, Pris reappeared carrying a pen and scrap of paper; she reseated herself, scratched out a hasty message.YOU GO TO THE DOOR.Isidore, nervously, took the pen from her and wrote:     AND SAY WHAT?With anger, Pris scratched out:     SEE IF ITS REALLY THEM.
