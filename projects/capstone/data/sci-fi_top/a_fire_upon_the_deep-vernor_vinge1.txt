How to explain?How to describe?Even the omniscient viewpoint quails.A singleton star, reddish and dim.A ragtag of asteroids, and a single planet, more like a moon.In this era the star hung near the galactic plane, just beyond the Beyond.The structures on the surface were gone from normal view, pulverized into regolith across a span of aeons.The treasure was far underground, beneath a network of passages, in a single room filled with black.Information at the quantum density, undamaged.Maybe five billion years had passed since the archive was lost to the nets.The curse of the mummy's tomb, a comic image from mankind's own prehistory, lost before time.They had laughed when they said it, laughed with joy at the treasure and determined to be cautious just the same.They would live here a year or five, the little company from Straum, the archaeologist programmers, their families and schools.A year or five would be enough to handmake the protocols, to skim the top and identify the treasure's origin in time and space, to learn a secret or two that would make Straumli Realm rich.And when they were done, they would sell the location; perhaps build a network link (but chancier that  this was beyond the Beyond; who knew what Power might grab what they'd found).So now there was a tiny settlement on the surface, and they called it the High Lab.It was really just humans playing with an old library.It should be safe, using their own automation, clean and benign.This library wasn't a living creature, or even possessed of automation (which here might mean something more, far more, than human).They would look and pick and choose, and be careful not to be burned Humans starting fires and playing with the flames.The archive informed the automation.Data structures were built, recipes followed.A local network was built, faster than anything on Straum, but surely safe.Nodes were added, modified by other recipes.The archive was a friendly place, with hierarchies of translation keys that led them along.Straum itself would be famous for this.Six months passed.A year.The omniscient view.Not self aware really.Self awareness is much over rated.Most automation works far better as a part of a whole, and even if human powerful, it does not need to self know.But the local net at the High Lab had transcended  almost without the humans realizing.The processes that circulated through its nodes were complex, beyond anything that could live on the computers the humans had brought.Those feeble devices were now simply front ends to the devices the recipes suggested.The processes had the potential for self awareness and occasionally the need."We should not be. ""Talking like this?""Talking at all. "The link between them was a thread, barely more than the narrowness that connects one human to another.But it was one way to escape the overness of the local net, and it forced separate consciousness upon them.They drifted from node to node, looked out from cameras mounted on the landing field.An armed frigate and a empty container vessel were all that sat there.It had been six months since resupply.A safety precaution early suggested by the archive, a ruse to enable the Trap.Flitting, flitting.We are wildlife that must not be noticed by the overness, by the Power that soon will be.On some nodes they shrank to smallness and almost remembered humanity, became echoes  "Poor humans; they will all die. ""Poor us; we will not. ""I think they suspect.Sjana and Arne anyway. "Once upon a time we were copies of those two.Once upon a time just weeks ago when the archaeologists started the ego level programs."Of course they suspect.But what can they do?It's an old evil they've wakened.Till it's ready, it will feed them lies, on every camera, in every message from home. "Thought ceased for a moment as a shadow passed across the nodes they used.The overness was already greater than anything human, greater than anything humans could imagine.Even its shadow was something more than human, a god trolling for nuisance wildlife.Then the ghosts were back, looking out upon the school yard underground.So confident the humans, a little village they had made here."Still," thought the hopeful one, the one who had always looked for the craziest outs, "we should not be.The evil should long ago have found us. ""The evil is young, barely three days old. ""Still.We exist.It proves something.The humans found more than a great evil in this archive. ""Perhaps they found two. ""Or an antidote. "Whatever else, the overness was missing some things and misinterpreting others."While we exist, when we exist, we should do what we can. "The ghost spread itself across a dozen workstations and showed its companion a view down an old tunnel, far from human artifacts.For five billion years it had been abandoned, airless, lightless.Two humans stood in the dark there, helmets touching."See?Sjana and Arne conspire.So can we. "The other didn't answer in words.Glumness.So the humans conspired, hiding in darkness they thought unwatched.But everything they said was surely tattled back to the overness, if only by the dust at their feet."I know, I know.Yet you and I exist, and that should be impossible too.Perhaps all together, we can make a greater impossibility come true. "Perhaps we can hurt the evil newly born here.A wish and a decision.The two misted their consciousness across the local net, faded to the faintest color of awareness.And eventually there was a plan, a deception  worthless unless they could separately get word to the outside.Was there time still for that?Days passed.For the evil that was growing in the new machines, each hour was longer than all the time before.Now the newborn was less than an hour from its great flowering, its safe spread across interstellar spaces.The local humans could be dispensed with soon.Even now they were an inconvenience, though an amusing one.Some of them actually thought to escape.For days they had been packing their children away into coldsleep and putting them aboard the freighter."Preparations for departure," was how they described the move in their planner programs.For days, they had been refitting the frigate  behind a a mask of transparent lies.Some of the humans understood that what they had wakened could be the end of them, that it might be the end of their Straumli Realm.There was precedent for such disasters, stories of races that had played with fire and had burned for it.None of them guessed the truth.None of them guessed the honor that had fallen upon them, that they had changed the future of a thousand million star systems.The hours came to minutes, the minutes to seconds.And now each second was as long as all the time before.The flowering was so close now, so close.The dominion of five billion years before would be regained, and this time held.Only one thing was missing, and that was something quite unconnected with the humans' schemes.In the archive, deep in the recipes, there should have been a little bit more.In billions of years, something could be lost.The newborn felt all its powers of before, in potential yet there should be something more, something it had learned in its fall, or something left by its enemies (if there ever were such).Long seconds probing the archives.There were gaps, checksums damaged.Some of the damage was age  Outside, the container ship and the frigate lifted from the landing field, rising on silent agravs above the plains of gray on gray, of ruins five billion years old.Almost half of the humans were aboard those craft.Their escape attempt, so carefully concealed.The effort had been humored till now: it was not quite time for the flowering, and the humans were still of some use.Below the level of supreme consciousness, its paranoid inclinations rampaged through the humans' databases.Checking, just to be sure.Just to be sure.The humans' oldest local network used light speed connections.Thousands of microseconds were spent (wasted) bouncing around it, sorting the trivia finally spotting one incredible item:  Inventory: quantum data container, quantity (1), loaded to the frigate one hundred hours before!And all the newborn's attention turned upon the fleeing vessels.Microbes, but suddenly pernicious.How could this happen?A million schedules were suddenly advanced.An orderly flowering was out of the question now, and so there was no more need for the humans left in the Lab.The change was small for all its cosmic significance.For the humans remaining aground, a moment of horror, staring at their displays, realizing that all their fears were true (not realizing how much worse than true).Five seconds, ten seconds, more change than ten thousand years of a human civilization.A billion trillion constructions, mold curling out from every wall, rebuilding what had been merely superhuman.This was as powerful as a proper flowering, though not quite so finely tuned.And never lose sight of the reason for haste: the frigate.It had switched to rocket drive, blasting heedless away from the wallowing freighter.Somehow, these microbes knew they were rescuing more than themselves.The warship had the best navigation computers that little minds could make.But it would be another three seconds before it could make its first ultradrive hop.The new Power had no weapons on the ground, nothing but a comm laser.That could not even melt steel at the frigate's range.No matter, the laser was aimed, tuned civilly on the retreating warship's receiver.No acknowledgment.The humans knew what communication would bring.The laser light flickered here and there across the hull, lighting smoothness and inactive sensors, sliding across the ship's ultradrive spines.Searching, probing.The Power had never bothered to sabotage the external hull, but that was no problem.Even this crude machine had thousands of robot sensors scattered across its surface, reporting status and danger, driving utility programs.Most were shut down now, the ship fleeing nearly blind.They thought by not looking that they could be safe.One more second and the frigate would attain interstellar safety.The laser flickered on a failure sensor, a sensor that reported critical changes in one of the ultradrive spines.Its interrupts could not be ignored if the star jump were to succeed.Interrupt honored.Interrupt handler running, looking out, receiving more light from the laser far below a backdoor into the ship's code, installed when the newborn had subverted the humans' groundside equipment   and the Power was aboard, with milliseconds to spare.Its agents  not even human equivalent on this primitive hardware  raced through the ship's automation, shutting down, aborting.There would be no jump.Cameras in the ship's bridge showed widening of eyes, the beginning of a scream.The humans knew, to the extent that horror can live in a fraction of a second.There would be no jump.Yet the ultradrive was already committed.There would be a jump attempt, without automatic control a doomed one.Less than five milliseconds till the jump discharge, a mechanical cascade that no software could finesse.The newborn's agents flitted everywhere across the ship's computers, futilely attempting a shutdown.Nearly a light second away, under the gray rubble at the High Lab, the Power could only watch.So.The frigate would be destroyed.So slow and so fast.A fraction of a second.The fire spread out from the heart of the frigate, taking both peril and possibility.Two hundred thousand kilometers away, the clumsy container vessel made its own ultradrive jump and vanished from sight.The newborn scarcely noticed.So a few humans had escaped; the universe was welcome to them.In the seconds that followed, the newborn felt emotions?things more, and less, than a human might feel.Try emotions:  Elation.The newborn knew that now it would survive.Horror.How close it had come to dying once more.Frustration.Perhaps the strongest, the closest to its mere human echo.Something of significance had died with the frigate, something from this archive.Memories were dredged from the context, reconstructed: What was lost might have made the newborn still more powerful but more likely was deadly poison.After all, this Power had lived once before, then been reduced to nothing.What was lost might have been the reason.Suspicion.The newborn should not have been so fooled.Not by mere humans.The newborn convulsed into self inspection and panic.Yes, there were blindspots, carefully installed from the beginning, and not by the humans.Two had been born here.Itself and the poison, the reason for its fall of old.The newborn inspected itself as never before, knowing now just what to seek.Destroying, purifying, rechecking, searching for copies of the poison, and destroying again.Relief.Defeat had been so close, but now   Minutes and hours passed, the enormous stretch of time necessary for physical construction: communications systems, transportation.The new Power's mood drifted, calmed.A human might call the feeling triumph, anticipation.Simple hunger might be more accurate.What more is needed when there are no enemies?The newborn looked across the stars, planning.This time things will be different.The coldsleep itself was dreamless.Three days ago they had been getting ready to leave, and now they were here.Little Jefri complained about missing all the action, but Johanna Olsndot was glad she'd been asleep; she had known some of the grownups on the other ship.Now Johanna drifted between the racks of sleepers.Waste heat from the coolers made the darkness infernally hot.Scabby gray mold grew on the walls.The coldsleep boxes were tightly packed, with narrow float spaces every tenth row.There were places where only Jefri could reach.Three hundred and nine children lay there, all the kids except herself and her brother Jefri.The sleep boxes were light duty hospital models.Given proper ventilation and maintenance, They would have been good for a hundred years, but Johanna wiped her face and looked at a box's readout: Like most of the ones on the inside rows, this was in bad shape.For twenty days it had kept the boy inside safely suspended, and would probably kill him if he stayed one day more.The box's cooling vents were clean, but she vac'd them again  more a prayer for good luck than effective maintenance.Mother and Dad were not to blame, though Johanna suspected that they blamed themselves.The escape had been put together with the materials at hand, at the last minute, when the experiment turned wicked.The High Lab staff had done what they could to save their children and protect against still greater disaster.And even so, things might have worked out if  "Johanna!Daddy says there's no more time.He says to finish what you're doing an' come up here. "Jefri had stuck his head down through the hatch to shout to her."Okay!"She shouldn't be down here anyway; there was nothing more she could do to help her friends.Tami and Giske and Magda and oh please be safe.Johanna pulled herself through the floatway, almost bumped into Jefri coming from the other direction.He grabbed her hand and hung close as they drifted toward the hatch.These last two days he hadn't cried, but he'd lost much of the independence of the last year.Now his eyes were wide."We're coming down near the North Pole, by all those islands and ice. "In the cabin beyond the hatch, their parents were strapping themselves in.Trader Arne Olsndot looked up at her and grinned."Hi, kiddo.Have a seat.We'll be on the ground in less than an hour. "Johanna smiled back, almost caught by his enthusiasm.Ignore the jumble of equipment, the odors of twenty days' confinement: Daddy looked as dashing as any adventure poster.The light from the display windows glittered off the seams of his pressure suit.He was just in from outside.Jefri pushed across the cabin, pulling Johanna behind him.He strapped into the webbing between her and their mother.Sjana Olsndot checked his restraints, then Johanna's."This will be interesting, Jefri.You will learn something. ""Yes, all about ice. "He was holding Mom's hand now.Mom smiled."Not today.I'm talking about the landing.This won't be like an agrav or a ballistic. "The agrav was dead.Dad had just detached their shell from the cargo carrier.They could never have landed the whole thing on one torch.Dad did something with the hodgepodge of controls he had softwired to his dataset.Their bodies settled into the webbing.Around them the cargo shell creaked, and the girder support for the sleep boxes groaned and popped.Something rattled and banged as it "fell" the length of the shell.Johanna guessed they were pulling about one gravity.Jefri's gaze went from the outside display to his mother's face and then back."What is it like then?"He sounded curious, but there was a little tremor in his voice.Johanna almost smiled; Jefri knew he was being diverted, and was trying to play along."This will be pure rocket descent, powered almost all the way.See on the middle window?That camera is looking straight down.You can actually see that we're slowing down. "You could, too.Johanna guessed they weren't more than a couple of hundred kilometers up.Arne Olsndot was using the rocket glued to the back end of the cargo shell to kill all their orbital velocity.There weren't any other options.They had abandoned the cargo carrier, with its agrav and ultradrive.It had brought them far, but its control automation was failing.Some hundreds of kilometers behind them, it coasted dead along their orbit.All they had left was the cargo shell.No wings, no agrav, no aero shielding.The shell was a hundred tonne carton of eggs balanced on one hot torch.Mom wasn't describing it quite that way to Jefri, though what she said was the truth.Somehow she had Jefri seeming to forget the danger.Sjana Olsndot had been a popular archaeologist at Straumli Realm, before they moved to the High Lab.Dad cut the jet, and they were in free fall again.Johanna felt a wave of nausea; ordinarily she never got space sick, but this was different.The image of land and sea in the downward window slowly grew.There were only a few scattered clouds.The coastline was an indefinite recursion of islands and straits and inlets.Dark green spread along the coast and up the valleys, shading to black and gray in the mountains.There was snow  and probably Jefri's ice  scattered in arcs and patches.It was all so beautiful and they were falling straight into it!She heard metallic banging on the cargo shell as the trim jets tipped their craft around, aligning the main jet downwards.The right hand window showed the ground now.The torch lit again, at something like one gravity.The edge of the display darkened in a burnout halo."Wow," said Jefri."It's like an elevator, down and down and down and" One hundred kilometers down, slow enough that aero forces wouldn't tear them apart.Sjana Olsndot was right; it was a novel way to descend from orbit, not a preferred method under any normal circumstances.It was certainly not intended in the original escape plans.They were to meet with the High Lab's frigate  and all the adults who could escape from the High Lab.And of course, that rendezvous was to be in space, an easy transfer.But the frigate was gone now, and they were on their own.Her eyes turned unwillingly to the stretch of hull beyond her parents.There was the familiar discoloration.It looked like gray fungus growing out of the clean hull ceramic.Her parents didn't talk about it much even now, except to shoo Jefri away from it.But Johanna had overheard them once, when they thought she and her brother were at the far end of the shell.Dad's voice almost crying with anger."All this for nothing!"he said softly."We made a monster, and ran, and now we're lost at the Bottom. "And Mom's voice even softer: "For the thousandth time, Arne, not for nothing.We have the kids. "She waved at the roughness that spread across the wall, "And given the dreams the directions we had, I think this was the best we could hope for.Somehow we are carrying the answer to all the evil we started. "Then Jefri had bounced loudly across the hold, proclaiming his imminent entrance, and his parents had shut up.Johanna hadn't quite had the courage to ask them about it.There had been strange things at the High Lab, and toward the end, some quietly scary things; even people who were not quite the same.Minutes passed.They were deep in the atmosphere now.The hull buzzed with the force of the air stream  or turbulence from the jet?But things were steady enough that Jefri was beginning to get restless.Much of the down looking view was burned out by airglow around the torch.The rest was clearer and more detailed than anything they had seen from orbit.Johanna wondered how often a new visited world had been landed upon with less reconnaissance than this.They had no telescopic cameras, and no ferrets.Physically, the planet was near the human ideal  wonderful good luck after all the bad.It was heaven compared to the airless rocks of the system that had been the prime rendezvous.On the other hand, there was intelligent life here: from orbit, they could see roads and towns.But there was no evidence of technic civilization; there was no sign of aircraft or radio or intense power sources.They were coming down in a thinly populated corner of the continent.With luck there would be no one to see their landing among the green valleys and the black and white peaks  and Arne Olsndot could fly the torch right to ground without fear of hurting much more than forest and grass.The coastal islands slid past the side camera's view.Jefri shouted, pointing.It was gone now, but she had seen it too: on one of the islands an irregular polygon of walls and shadow.It reminded her of castles from the Age of Princesses on Nyjora.She could see individual trees now, their shadows long in slanting sunlight.The roar of the torch was as loud as anything she had ever heard; they were deep in atmosphere, and they weren't moving away from the sound.   "things get tricky," Dad shouted."And no programs to make things right Where to, love?"Mom look back and forth between the display windows.As far as Johanna knew, they couldn't move the cameras or assign new ones.  "that hill, above the timber line, but think I saw a pack of animals running away from the blast on west side. ""Yeah," shouted Jefri, "wolves. "Johanna had only had a quick glimpse of moving specks.They were in full hover now, maybe a thousand meters above the hilltops.The noise was painful, unending; further talk was impossible.They drifted slowly across landscape, partly to reconnoiter, partly to stay out of the plume of superheated air that rose about them.The land was more rolling than craggy, and the "grass" looked mossy.Still Arne Olsndot hesitated.The main torch was designed for velocity matching after interstellar jumps; they could hang like this for a good while.But when they did touch down, they'd better have it right.She'd heard her parents talking that one over  when Jefri was working with the coldsleep boxes and out of earshot.If there was too much water in the soil, the backsplash would be a steam cannon, punching right through the shell.Landing in trees would have some dubious pluses, maybe giving them a little cushioning and a standoff from the splash.But now they were going for direct contact.At least they could see where they were landing.Three hundred meters.Dad dragged the torch tip through the ground cover.The soft landscape exploded.A second later their boat rocked in the column of steam.The down looking camera died.They didn't back off, and after a moment the battering eased; the torch had burned through whatever water table or permafrost lay below them.The cabin air grew steadily hotter.Olsndot brought them slowly down through it, using the side cameras and the sound of the backsplash as his guide.He cut the torch.There was a scary half second fall, then the sound of the rendezvous pylons hitting ground.They steadied, then one side groaned, giving way a little.Silence, except for heat pinging around the hull.Dad looked at their ad hoc pressure gauge.He grinned at Mom."No breach.I bet I could even take this baby up again!"An hour's difference either way and Peregrine Wickwrackrum's life would have been very different.The three travelers were headed west, down from the Icefangs towards Flenser's Castle on Hidden Island.There were in his life when he couldn't have borne the company, but in the last decade Peregrine had become much more sociable.He liked traveling with others nowadays.On his last trek through the Great Sandy, there had been five packs in his party.Part of that had been a matter of safety: some deaths are almost inevitable when the distance between oases can be a thousand miles  and the oases themselves are transient.But aside from safety, he had learned a lot in conversation with the others.He was not so happy with his current companions.Neither were truly pilgrims; both had secrets.Scriber Jaqueramaphan was fun, an amusing goofball and fount of uncoordinated information There was also a good chance he was a spy.That was okay, as long as people didn't think Peregrine was working with him.The third of their party was the one who really bothered him.Tyrathect was a newby, not all together yet; she had no taken name.Tyrathect claimed to be a school teacher, but somewhere in her (him?gender preference wasn't entirely clear yet) was a killer.The creature was obviously a Flenserist fanatic, standoffish and rigid much of the time.Almost certainly, she was fleeing the purge that followed Flenser's unsuccessful attempt to take power in the east.He'd run into these two at Eastgate, on the Republican side of the Icefangs.They both wanted to visit the Castle on Hidden Island.And what the hell, that was only a sixty mile detour off the main trail to Woodcarvers; they all would have to cross the mountains.Besides, he had wanted to visit Flenser's Domain for years.Maybe one of these two could get him in.So much of the world reviled the Flenserists.Peregrine Wickwrackrum was of two minds about evil: when enough rules get broken, sometimes there is good amid the carnage.This afternoon, they'd finally come in sight of the coastal islands.Peregrine had been here only fifty years before.Even so, he wasn't prepared for the beauty of this land.The Northwest Coast was by far the mildest arctic in the world.In high summer, with unending day, the bottoms of the glacier reamed valleys turned all to green.God the carver had stooped to touch these lands and His chisels had been made of ice.Now, all that was left of the ice and snow were misty arcs at the eastern horizon and remnant patches scattered on the near hills.Those patches melted and melted through the summer, starting little creeks that merged with one another to cascade down the steep sides of the valleys.On his right, Peregrine trotted across a level stretch of ground that was soggy with standing water.The chill on his feet felt wonderful; he didn't even mind the midges that swirled around him.Tyrathect was across the valley, paralleling his course, but above the heather line.She'd been fairly talkative till the valley curved and the farmland and the islands came into view.Somewhere out there was Flenser's Castle, and her dark appointment.Scriber Jaqueramaphan had been all over, mindlessly running around on both sides of the valley.He'd collect in twos or threes and execute some jape that made even the dour Tyrathect laugh, then climb to a height and report what he saw beyond.He'd been the first to see the coast.That had sobered him some.His clowning was dangerous enough without doing it in the neighborhood of known rapists.Wickwrackrum called a pause, and got himself together to adjust the straps on his backpacks.The rest of the afternoon was going to be tense.He'd have to decide whether he really wanted to enter the Castle with his friends.There are limits to an adventurous spirit, even in a pilgrim."Hey, do you hear something bass?"Tyrathect called from across the valley.Peregrine listened.There was a rumbling  powerful, but almost below his range of hearing.For an instant, fear crossed his puzzlement.A century before, he'd been in a monster earthquake.This sound was similar, but the ground was still beneath his feet.Would that mean no landslides and flashfloods?He hunkered down, looking out in all directions."It's in the sky!"Jaqueramaphan was pointing.A spot of glare hung almost overhead, a tiny spear of light.No memories, not even legends came to Wickwrackrum's mind.He spread out, all eyes on the slowly moving light.God's Choir.It must be miles up, and still he heard it.He looked away from the light, afterimages dancing painfully in his eyes."It's getting brighter, louder," said Jaqueramaphan."I think it's coming down on the hills yonder, on the coast. "Peregrine pulled himself together and ran west, shouting to the others.He would get as close as was safe, and watch.He didn't look up again.It was just too bright.It cast shadows in broad daylight!He ran another half mile.The star was still in the air.He couldn't remember a falling star so slow, though some of the biggest made terrible explosions.In fact there were no stories from folks who had been near such things.His wild, pilgrim curiosity faded before that recollection.He looked in all directions.Tyrathect was nowhere in sight; Jaqueramaphan was huddled next to some boulders ahead.And the light was so bright that where his clothes did not protect him, Wickwrackrum felt a blaze of heat.The noise from the sky was outright pain now.Peregrine dived over the edge of the valley side, rolled and staggered and fell down the steep walls of rock.He was in the shade now: only sunlight lay upon him!The far side of the valley shone in the glare; crisp shadows moved with the unseen thing behind him.The noise was still a bass rumble, but so loud it numbed the mind.Peregrine stumbled past the timberline, and continued till he was sheltered by a hundred yards of forest.That should have helped a lot, but the noise was been growing still louder  Mercifully, he blacked out for a moment or two.When he came around, the star sound was gone.The ringing it left in his tympana was a great confusion.He staggered about in a daze.It seemed to be raining  except that some of the droplets glowed.Little fires were starting here and there in the forest.He hid beneath dense crowned trees till the burning rocks stopped falling.The fires didn't spread; the summer had been relatively wet.Peregrine lay quietly, waiting for more burning rocks or new star noise.Nothing.The wind in the tree tops lessened.He could hear the birds and crickers and woodborers.He walked to the forest edge and peeked out in several places.Discounting the patches of burnt heather, everything looked normal.But his viewpoint was very restricted: he could see high valley walls, a few hilltops.Ha!There was Scriber Jaqueramaphan, three hundred yards further up.Most of him was hunkered down in holes and hollows, but he had a couple of members looking toward where the star had fallen.Peregrine squinted.Scriber was such a buffoon most of the time.But sometimes it just seemed a cover; if he really was a fool, he was one with a streak of genius.More than once, Wicky had seen him at a distance, working in pairs with some strange tool As now: the other was holding something long and pointed to his eye.Wickwrackrum crept out of the forest, keeping close together and making as little noise as possible.He climbed carefully around the rocks, slipping from hummock to heather hummock, till he was just short of the valley crest and some fifty yards from Jaqueramaphan.He could hear the other thinking to himself.Any closer, and Scriber would hear him, even bunched up and quiet as he was."Ssst!"said Wickwrackrum.The buzzing and muttering stopped in an instant of shocked surprise.Jaqueramaphan stuffed the mysterious seeing tool into a backpack and pulled himself together, thinking very quietly.They stared at each other for a moment, then Scriber made silly squirling gestures at his shoulder tympana.Listen up."Can you talk like this?"His voice came very high pitched, up where some people can't make voluntary conversation, where low sound ears are deaf.Hightalk could be confusing, but it was very directional and faded quickly with distance; no one else would hear them.Peregrine nodded, "Hightalk is no problem. "The trick was to use tones pure enough not to confuse."Take a look over the hill crest, friend pilgrim.There is something new under the sun. "Peregrine moved up another thirty yards, keeping a lookout in all directions.He could see the straits now, gleaming rough silver in the afternoon sunlight.Behind him, the north side of the valley was lost in shadow.He sent one member ahead, skittering between the hummocks to look down on the plain where the star had landed.God's Choir, he thought to himself (but quietly).He brought up another member to get a parallax view.The thing looked like a huge adobe hut mounted on stilts But this was the fallen star: the ground beneath it glowed dull red.Curtains of mist rose from the moist heather all around.The torn earth had been thrown in long lines that radiated from a spot beneath it.He nodded at Jaqueramaphan."Where is Tyrathect?"Scriber shrugged."A couple of miles back, I'll bet.I'm keeping an eye out for her Do you see the others though, the troopers from Flenser's Castle?""No!"Peregrine looked west from the landing site.There.They were almost a mile away, in camouflage jackets, belly crawling across the hummocky terrain.He could see at least three troopers.They were big guys, six each."How could they get here so fast?"He glanced at the sun."It can't be more than half an hour since all this started. ""Their good luck. "Jaqueramaphan returned to the crest and looked over."I'll bet they were already on the mainland when the star came down.This is all Flenser territory; they must have patrols. "He hunkered down so just two pairs of eyes would be visible to those below."That's an ambush formation, you know. ""You don't seem very happy to see them.These are your friends, remember?The people you've come to see. "Scriber cocked his heads sarcastically."Yeah, yeah.Don't rub it in.I think you've known from the beginning that I'm not all for Flenser. ""I guessed. ""Well, the game is over now.Whatever came down this afternoon is worth more to uh, my friends than anything I could have learned on Hidden Island. ""What about Tyrathect?""Heh, heh.Our esteemed companion is more than genuine, I fear.I'd bet she's a Flenser Lord, not the low rank Servant she seems at first glance.I expect that many of her kind are leaking back over the mountains these days, happy to get out of the Long Lakes Republic.Hide your behinds, fellow.If she spots us, those troopers will get us sure. "Peregrine moved deeper into the hollows and burrows that pocked the heather.He had an excellent view back along the valley.If Tyrathect were not already on the scene, he'd see her long before she would him."Peregrine?""Yes?""You're a pilgrim.You've traveled the world since the beginning of time, you'd have us believe.How far do your memories really go back?"Given the situation, Wickwrackrum was inclined to honesty."Like you'd expect: a few hundred years.Then we're talking about legends, recollections of things that probably happened, but with the details all mixed and muddled. ""Well, I haven't traveled much, and I'm fairly new.But I do read.A lot.There's never been anything like this before.That is a made thing down there.It came from higher than I can measure.You've read Aramstriquesa or Astrologer Belelele?You know what this could be?"Wickwrackrum didn't recognize the names.But he was a pilgrim.There were lands so far away that no one spoke any language he knew.In the Southseas he met folk who thought there was no world beyond their islands and who ran from his boats when he came ashore.Even more, one part of him had been an islander and had watched that coming ashore.He stuck a head into the open and looked again at the fallen star, the visitor from farther than he had ever been and he wondered where this pilgrimage might end.It took five hours for the ground to cool enough for Dad to slide the ladder ramp to ground.He and Johanna climbed carefully down, hopped across the steaming earth to stand on relatively undamaged turf.It would be a long time before this ground cooled completely; the jet's exhaust was very "clean", scarcely interacting with normal matter  all of which meant that some very hot rock extended down thousands of meters beneath their boat.Mom sat in the hatchway, watching the land beyond them.She had Dad's old pistol."Anything?"Dad shouted to her."No.And Jefri doesn't see anything through the windows. "Dad walked around the cargo shell, inspecting the misused docking pylons.Every ten meters they stopped and set up an sound projector.That had been Johanna's idea.Besides Dad's gun, they really had no weapons.The projectors were accidental cargo, stuff from the infirmary.With a little programming, they could put out wild screeching all up and down the audio spectrum.It might be enough to scare off the local animals.Johanna followed her father, her eyes on the landscape, her nervousness giving way to awe.It was so beautiful, so cool.They were standing on a broad field, high in hills.Westward the hills fell toward straits and islands.To the north the ground ended abruptly at the edge of a wide valley; she could see waterfalls on the other side.The ground felt spongy beneath her feet.Their landing field was puckered into thousands of little hillocks, like waves caught in a still picture.Snow lay in timid patches across the higher hills.Johanna squinted north, into the sun.North?"What time is it, Daddy?"Olsndot laughed, still looking at the underside of the cargo shell."Local midnight. "Johanna had been brought up in the middle latitudes of Straum.Most of her school field trips had been to space, where odd sun geometries were no big deal.Somehow she had never thought of such things happening on the ground I mean, seeing the sun right over the top of the world.The first order of business was to get half the coldsleep boxes out into the open, and rearrange those left aboard.Mom figured that the temperature problems would just about disappear then, even for the boxes left on board: "Having separate power supplies and venting will be an advantage now.The kids will all be safe.Johanna, you check Jefri's work on the ones inside, okay?"The second order of business would be to start a tracking program on the Relay system, and to set up ultralight communication.Johanna was a little afraid of that step.What would they learn?They already knew the High Lab had gone wicked and the disaster Mom predicted had begun.How much of Straumli Realm was dead now?Everyone at the High Lab had thought they were doing so much good, and now Don't think about it.Maybe the Relayers could help.Somewhere there must be people who could use what her folks had taken from the Lab.They'd be rescued, and the rest of the kids would be revived.She'd been feeling guilty about that.Sure, Mom and Dad needed extra hands right at the end of the flight  and Johanna was one of the oldest children in the school.But it seemed wrong that she and Jefri were the only kids going into this with their eyes open.Coming down, she had felt her mother's fear.I bet they wanted us together, even if it was only for one last time.The landing had been truly dangerous, however easy Dad made it look.Johanna could see where the backsplash had gouged the hull; if any of that had gotten past the torch and into the exhaust chamber, they'd all be vapor now.Almost half the coldsleep boxes were on the ground now, by the east side of the boat.Mom and Dad were spreading them out so the coolers would have no problem.Jefri was inside, checking if there were any other boxes that needed attention.He was a good kid when he wasn't a brat.She turned into the sunlight, felt the cool breeze flowing across the hill.She heard something that sounded like a birdcall.Johanna was out by one of the sound projectors when the ambush happened.She had her dataset plugged to its control, and was busy giving it new directions.It showed how little they had left, that even her old dataset was important now.But Dad wanted something that would sweep through the broadest possible bandwidth, making plenty of racket all the way, but with big spikes every so often; Pink Olifaunt could certainly manage that."Johanna!"Mom's cry came simultaneous with the sound of breaking ceramic.The projector's bell came shattering down beside her.Johanna looked up.Something ripped through her chest just inside her shoulder, knocking her down.She stared stupidly at the shaft that stuck out of her.An arrow!The west edge of their landing area was swarming with things.Like wolves or dogs, but with long necks, they moved quickly forward, darting from hummock to hummock.Their pelts were the same gray green of the hillside, except near the haunches where she saw white and black.No, the green was clothing, jackets.Johanna was in shock, the pressure of the bolt through her chest not yet registering as pain.She had been thrown back against uptilted turf and for the moment had a view of the whole attack.She saw more arrows rise up, dark lines floating in the sky.She could see the archers now.More dogs!They moved in packs.It took two of them to use a bow  one to hold it and one to draw.The third and fourth carried quivers of arrows and just seemed to watch.The archers hung back, staying mostly under cover.Other packs swirled in from the sides, now leaping over the hummocks.Many carried hatchets in their jaws.Metal tines gleamed on their paws.She heard the snickety of Dad's pistol.The wave of attackers staggered as individuals collapsed.The others continued forward, snarling now.These were sounds of madness, not the barking of dogs.She felt the sounds in her teeth, like blasti music punching from a large speaker.Jaws and claws and knives and noise.She twisted on her side, trying to see back to the boat.Now the pain was real.She screamed, but the sound was lost in the madness.The mob raced around her, heading for Mom and Dad.Her parents were crouched behind a rendezvous pylon.There was a constant flicker from the pistol in Arne Olsndot's hand.His pressure suit had protected him from the arrows.The alien bodies were piling high.The pistol, with its smart flechettes, was deadly effective.She saw him hand the pistol to Mom and run out from under the boat, toward her.Johanna stretched her free arm towards him and cried, screamed for him to go back.Thirty meters.Twenty five.Mom's covering fire swept around them, driving the wolves back.A flurry of arrows descended on Olsndot as he ran, arms upheld to shield his head.Twenty meters.A wolf jumped high over Johanna.She had a quick glimpse of its short fur and scarred rear end.It raced straight for Dad.Olsndot weaved, trying to give his wife a clear shot, but the wolf was too quick.It jinked with him, sprinting across the gap.It leaped, metal glittering on its paws.Johanna saw red splash from Daddy's neck, and then the two of them were down.For a moment, Sjana Olsndot stopped shooting.That was enough.The mob parted and a large group ran purposefully toward the boat.They had tanks of some kind on their backs.The lead animal held a hose in its mouth.A dark liquid jetted out and vanished in an explosion of fire.The wolf pack played their crude flamethrower across the ground, across the pylon where Sjana Olsndot stood, across the ranks of school children in coldsleep.Johanna saw something moving, twisting in the flames and tarry smoke, saw the light plastic of the coldsleep boxes slump and flow.Johanna turned her face to the earth, then pushed herself up on her good arm and tried to crawl toward the boat, the flames.And then the dark was merciful, and she remembered no more.Peregrine and Scriber watched the ambush preparations throughout the afternoon: infantry arrayed on the slope west of the landing site, archers behind them, flame troopers in pounce formation.Did the Lords of Flenser's Castle understand what they were up against?The two debated the question off and on.Jaqueramaphan thought the Flenserists did, that their arrogance was so great that they simply expected to grab the prize."They go for the throat before the other side even knows there's a fight.It's worked before. "Peregrine didn't answer immediately.Scriber could be right.It had been fifty years since he had been in this part of the world.Back then, Flenser's cult had been obscure (and not that interesting compared to what existed elsewhere).Treachery did sometimes befall travelers, but it was rarer than the stay at homes would believe.Most people were friendly and enjoyed hearing about the world beyond  especially if the visitor was not threatening.When treachery did occur, it was most often after an initial "sizing up" to determine just how powerful the visitors were and what could be gained from their death.Immediate attack, without conversation, was very rare.Usually it meant you had run into villains who were both sophisticated and crazy."I don't know.That is an ambush formation, but maybe the Flenserists will hold it in reserve, and talk first. "Hours passed; the sun slid sideways into the north.There was noise from the far side of the fallen star.Crap.They couldn't see anything from here.The hidden troops made no move.The minutes passed and they got their first view of the visitor from heaven, or part of him anyway.There were four legs per member, but it walked on its rear legs only.What a clown!Yet it used its front paws for holding things.Not once did he see it use a mouth; he doubted if the flat jaws could get a good hold, anyway.Those forepaws were wonderfully agile.A single member could easily use tools.There were plenty of conversation sounds, even though only three members were visible.After a while, they heard the much higher pitched tones of organized thought; God, the creature was noisy.At this distance, the sounds were muffled and distorted.Even so, they were like no mind he had ever heard, nor like the confusion noises that some grazers made."Well?"hissed Jaqueramaphan."I have been all around the world  and this creature is not part of it. ""Yeah.Well, it reminds me of mantis bugs.You know, about this high  " he opened a mouth about two inches wide."Great for keeping your garden free of pests great little killers. "Ugh.Peregrine hadn't thought of the resemblance.Mantises were cute and harmless  as far as people were concerned.But he knew the females would eat their own mates.Imagine such creatures grown to giant size, and possessed of pack mentality.Maybe it was just was well they couldn't go prancing down to say hello.A half hour passed.As the alien brought its cargo to ground, the Flenser archers moved closer; the infantry packs arranged themselves in assault wings.A flight of arrows arched across the gap between the Flenserists and the alien.One of the alien members went down immediately, and its thoughts quieted.The rest moved out of sight beneath the flying house.The troopers dashed forward, spaced in identity preserving formations; perhaps they meant to take the alien alive.But the assault line crumpled, many yards short of the alien: no arrows, no flames  the troopers just fell.For a moment Peregrine thought the Flenserists might have bit off more than they could chew.Then the second wave ran over the first.Members continued to fall, but they were in killing frenzy now, with only animal discipline left.The assault rolled slowly forward, the rear climbing over the fallen.Another alien member down Strange, he could still hear wisps of the other's thought.In tone and tempo, it sounded the same as before the attack.How could anyone be so composed with total death looming?A combat whistle sounded, and the mob parted.A trooper raced through and sprayed liquid fire.The flying house looked like meat on a griddle, flame and smoke coming up all around it.Wickwrackrum swore to himself.Good bye alien.The wrecked and wounded were low on the Flenserist priority list.Seriously wounded were piled onto travoises and pulled far enough away so their cries would not cause confusion.Cleanup squads bullied the trooper fragments away from the flying house.The frags wandered the hummocky meadow; here and there they coalesced into ad hoc packs.Some drifted among the wounded, ignoring the screams in their need to find themselves.When the tumult was quieted, three packs of whitejackets appeared.The Servants of the Flenser walked under the flying house.One was out of sight for a long while; perhaps it even got inside.The charred bodies of two alien members were carefully placed on travoises  more carefully than the wounded troopers had been  and hauled off.Jaqueramaphan scanned the ruins with his eye tool.He had given up trying to hide it from Peregrine.A whitejackets carried something down from the flying house."Sst!There are other dead ones.Maybe from the fire.They look like pups. "The small figures had the mantis form.They were strapped into travoises, and hauled out of sight over the hill's edge.No doubt they had kherhog drawn carts down there.The Flenserists set a sentry ring around the landing site.Dozens of fresh troopers stood on the hillside beyond it.No one was going to sneak past that."So it's total murder. "Peregrine sighed."Maybe not The first member they shot, I don't think it's quite dead. "Wickwrackrum squinted his best eyes.Either Scriber was a wishful thinker, or his tool gave him amazingly sharp sight.The first one hit had been on the other side of the craft.The member had stopped thinking, but that wasn't a sure sign of death.There was a whitejackets standing around it now.The whitejackets put the creature onto a travois and began pulling it away from the landing site, towards the southwest not quite the same path that the others had taken."The thing is still alive!It's got an arrow in the chest, but I can see it breathing. "Scriber's heads turned toward Wickwrackrum."I think we should rescue it. "For a moment Peregrine couldn't think of anything to say; he just gaped at the other.The center of Flenser's worldwide cabal was just a few miles to the northwest.Flenserist power was undisputed for dozens of miles inland, and right now they were virtually surrounded by an army.Scriber wilted a little before Peregrine's astonishment, but it was clear he was not joking."Sure, I know it's risky.But that's what life is all about, right?You're a pilgrim.You understand. ""Hmf. "That was the pilgrim reputation, all right.But no soul can survive total death  and there were plenty of opportunities for such annihilation on a pilgrimage.Pilgrims do know caution.And yet, and yet this was the most marvelous encounter in all his centuries of pilgrimage.To know these aliens, to become them it was a temptation that surpassed all good sense."Look," said Scriber, "we could just go down and mingle with the wounded.If we can make it across the field, we might get a look at that last alien member, without risking too much. "Jaqueramaphan was already backing down from his observation point, and circling around to find a path that wouldn't put him in silhouette.Wickwrackrum was torn; part of him got up to follow and part of him hesitated.Hell, Jaqueramaphan had admitted to being a spy; he carried an invention that was probably straight from the Long Lakes sharpest intelligence people.The guy had to be a pro  Peregrine took a quick look around their side of the hill and across the valley.No sign of Tyrathect or anyone else.He crawled out of his various hidey holes and followed the spy.As much as possible, they stayed in the deep shadows cast by the northering sun, and slipped from hummock to hummock where there was no shade.Just before they got to the first of the wounded, Scriber said something more, the scariest words of the afternoon."Hey, don't worry.I've read all about doing this sort of thing!"A mob of frags and wounded is a terrifying, mind numbing thing.Singletons, duos, trios, a few quads: they wandered aimlessly, keening without control.In most situations, this many people packed together on just a few acres would have been an instant choir.In fact, he did notice some sexual activity and some organized browsing, but for the most part there was still too much pain for normal reactions.Wickwrackrum wondered briefly if  for all their talk of rationalism  the Flenserists would just leave the wreckage of their troops to reassemble itself.They'd have some strange and crippled repacks if they did.A few yards into the mob and Peregrine Wickwrackrum could feel consciousness slipping from him.If he concentrated really hard, he could remember who he was and that he must get to the other side of the meadow without attracting attention.Other thoughts, loud and unguarded, pummeled him:   Blood lust and slashing  Glittering metal in the alien's hand the pain in her chest coughing blood, falling   Boot camp and before, my merge brother was so good to me Lord Steel said that we are a grand experiment  Running across the heather toward the stick limbed monster.Leap, tines in paw.Slash the monster's throat.Blood spouts high.Where am I?May I be part of you please?Peregrine whirled at that last question.It was pointed and near.A singleton was sniffing at him.He screeched the fragment off, and ran into an open space.Up ahead, Jaque what's his name was scarcely better off.There was little chance they would be spotted here, but he was beginning to wonder if he could make it through.Peregrine was only four and there were singletons everywhere.On his right a quad was raping, grabbing at whatever duos and singles happened by.Wic and Kwk and Rac and Rum tried to remember just why they was here and where they was going.Concentrate on direct sensation; what is really here: the sooty smell of the flamer's liquid fire   the midges swarming everywhere, clotting the puddles of blood all black.An awfully long time passed.Minutes.Wic Kwk Rac Rum looked ahead.He was almost out of it; the south edge of the wreckage.He dragged himself to a patch of clean ground.Parts of him vomited, and he collapsed.Sanity slowly returned.Wickwrackrum looked up, saw Jaqueramaphan just inside the mob.Scriber was a big fellow, a sixsome, but he was having at least as bad a time as Peregrine.He staggered from side to side, eyes wide, snapping at himself and others.Well, they had made it a good way across the meadow, and fast enough to catch up with the whitejackets who was pulling the last alien member.If they wanted to see anything more, they'd have to figure how to leave the mob without attracting attention.Hmm.There were plenty of Flenserist uniforms around without living owners.Peregrine walked two of himself over to where a dead trooper lay."Jaqueramaphan!Here!"The great spy looked in his direction, and a glint of intelligence returned to his eyes.He stumbled out of the mob and sat down a few yards from Wickwrackrum.It was far nearer than would normally be comfortable, but after what they'd been through, it seemed barely close.He lay for a moment, gasping."Sorry, I never guessed it would be like that.I lost part of me back there never thought I'd get her back. "Peregrine watched the progress of the whitejackets and its travois.It wasn't going with the others; in a few seconds it would be out of sight.With a disguise, maybe they could follow and  no, it was just too risky.He was beginning to think like the great spy.Peregrine pulled a camouflage jacket off a corpse.They would still need disguises.Maybe they could hang around here through the night, and get a closer look at the flying house.After a moment, Scriber saw what he was doing, and began gathering jackets for himself.They slunk between the piled bodies, looking for gear that wasn't too stained and that Jaqueramaphan thought had consistent insignia.There were plenty of paw claws and battle axes around.They'd end up armed to the teeth, but they'd have to dump some of their backpacks One more jacket was all he needed, but his Rum was so broad in the shoulders that nothing fit.Peregrine didn't really understand what happened till later: a large fragment, a threesome, was lying doggo in the pile of dead.Perhaps it was grieving, long after its member's dying dirge; in any case, it was almost totally thoughtless until Peregrine began pulling the jacket off its dead member.Then, "You'll not rob from mine!"He heard the buzz of nearby rage, and then there was slashing pain across his Rum's gut.Peregrine writhed in agony, leaped upon the attacker.For a moment of mindless rage, they fought.Peregrine's battle axes slashed again and again, covering his muzzles with blood.When he came to his senses one of the three was dead, the others running into the mob of wounded.Wickwrackrum huddled around the pain in his Rum.The attacker had been wearing tines.Rum was slashed from ribs to crotch.Wickwrackrum stumbled; some of his paws were caught in his own guts.He tried to nose the ruins back into his member's abdomen.The pain was fading, the sky in Rum's eyes slowly darkening.Peregrine stifled the screams he felt climbing within him.I'm only four, and one of me is dying!For years he'd been warning himself that four was just too small a number for a pilgrim.Now he'd pay the price, trapped and mindless in a land of tyrants.For a moment, the pain eased and his thoughts were clear.The fight hadn't really caused much notice amid the dirges, rapes, and simple attacks of madness.Wickwrackrum's fight had only been a little bigger and bloodier than usual.The whitejackets by the flying house had looked briefly in their direction, but were now back to tearing open the alien cargo.Scriber was sitting nearby, watching in horror.Part of him would move a little closer, then pull back.He was fighting with himself, trying to decide whether to help.Peregrine almost pleaded with him, but the effort was too great.Besides, Scriber was no pilgrim.Giving part of himself was not something Jaqueramaphan could do voluntarily  Memories came flooding now, Rum's efforts to sort things out and let the rest of him know all that had been before.For a moment, he was sailing a twinhull across the South Sea, a newby with Rum as a pup; memories of the island person who had born Rum, and of packs before that.Once around the world they had traveled, surviving the slums of a tropic collective, and the war of the Plains Herds.Ah, the stories they had heard, the tricks they had learned, the people they had met Wic Kwk Rac Rum had been a terrific combination, clear thinking, lighthearted, with a strange ability to keep all the memories in place; that had been the real reason he had gone so long without growing to five or six.Now he would pay perhaps the greatest price of all  Rum sighed, and could not see the sky anymore.Wickwrackrum's mind went, not as it does in the heat of battle when the sound of thought is lost, not as it does in the companionable murmur of sleep.There was suddenly no fourth presence, just the three, trying to make a person.The trio stood and patted nervously at itself.There was danger everywhere, but beyond its understanding.It sidled hopefully toward a sixsome sitting nearby  Jaqueramaphan?but the other shooed it away.It looked nervously at the mob of wounded.There was completeness there and madness too.A huge male with deeply scarred haunches sat at the edge of the mob.It caught the threesome's eye, and slowly crawled across the open space toward them.Wic and Kwk and Rac back away, their pelts puffing up in fright and fascination; the scarred one was at least half again the weight of any of them.Where am I?May I be part of you please?Its keening carried memories, jumbled and mostly inaccessible, of blood and fighting, of military training before that.Somehow, the creature was as frightened of those early memories as of anything.It lay its muzzle  caked with dried blood  on the ground and belly crawled toward them.The other three almost ran; random coupling was something that scared all of them.They backed and backed, out onto the clear meadow.The other followed, but slowly, still crawling.Kwk licked her lips and walked back towards the stranger.She extended her neck and sniffed along the other's throat.Wic and Rac approached from the sides.For an instant there was a partial join.Sweaty, bloody, wounded  a melding made in hell.The thought seemed to come from nowhere, glowed in the four for a moment of cynical humor.Then the unity was lost, and they were just three animals licking the face of a fourth.Peregrine looked around the meadow with new eyes.He had been disintegrate for just a few minutes: The wounded from the Tenth Attack Infantry were just as before.Flenser's Servants were still busy with the alien cargo.Jaqueramaphan was slowly backing away, his expression a compound of wonder and horror.Peregrine lowered a head and hissed at him, "I won't betray you, Scriber. "The spy froze."That you, Peregrine?""More or less. "Peregrine still, but Wickwrackrum no more."H how can you do it?Y you just lost"  "I'm a pilgrim, remember?We live with this sort of thing all our lives. "There was sarcasm in his voice; this was more or less the cliche Jaqueramaphan had been spouting earlier.But there was some truth to it.Already Peregrine Wickwrackscar felt like a person.Maybe this new combination had a chance."Uk.Well, yes What should we do now?"The spy looked nervously in all directions, but his eyes on Peregrine were the most worried of all.Now it was Wickwrackscar's turn to be puzzled.What was he doing here?Killing the strange enemy No.That's what the Attack Infantry was doing.He would have nothing to do with that, no matter what the scarred one's memories.He and Scriber had come here to to rescue the alien, as much of it as possible.Peregrine grabbed hold of the memory and held it uncritically; it was something real, from the past identity he must preserve.He glanced towards where he had last seen the alien member.The whitejackets and his travois were no longer visible, but he'd been heading along an obvious path."We can still get ourselves the live one," he said to Jaqueramaphan.Scriber stamped and sidled.He was not quite the enthusiast of before."After you, my friend. "Wickwrackscar straightened his combat jackets and brushed some of the dried blood off.Then he strutted off across the meadow, passing just a hundred yards from the Flenser's Servants around the enemy  around the flying house.He flipped them a sharp salute, which was ignored.Jaqueramaphan followed, carrying two crossbows.The other was doing his best to imitate Peregrine's strut, but he really didn't have the right stuff.Then they were past the military crest of the hill and descending into shadows.The sounds of the wounded were muted.Wickwrackscar broke into double time, loping from switchback to switchback as he descended the rough path.From here he could see the harbor; the boats were still at the piers, and there wasn't much activity.Behind him, Scriber was talking nervous nonsense.Peregrine just ran faster, his confidence fueled by general newby confusion.His new member, the scarred one, had been the muscle behind an infantry officer.That pack had known the layout of the harbors and the castle, and all the passwords of the day.Two more switchbacks and they overran the Flenser Servant and his travois."Hallo!"shouted Peregrine."We bring new instructions from Lord Steel. "A chill went down his spines at the name, remembering Steel for the first time.The Servant dropped the travois and turned to face them.Wickwrackscar didn't know his name, but he remembered the guy: fairly high ranking, an arrogant get of bitches.It was a surprise to see him pulling the travois himself.Peregrine stopped only twenty yards from the whitejackets.Jaqueramaphan was looking down from the switchback above; his bows were out of sight.The Servant looked nervously at Peregrine and up at Scriber."What do you two want?"Did he suspect them already?No matter.Wickwrackscar braced himself for a killing charge and suddenly he was seeing in fours, his mind blurred with newby dizziness.Now that he needed to kill, the scarred one's horror of the act undid him.Damn!Wickwrackscar cast wildly about for something to say.And now that murder was out of his mind, his new memories came easily: "Lord Steel's will, that the creature be brought with us to the harbor.You, ah, you are to return to the invader's flying thing. "The whitejackets licked his lips.His eyes swept sharply across Peregrine's uniforms, and Scriber's."Impostors!"he screamed, at the same instant lunging one of his members toward the travois.Metal glinted in the member's forepaw.He's going to kill the alien!There was a bow snap from above, and the runner fell, a shaft through its eye.Wickwrackscar charged the others, forcing his scarbacked member out front.There was an instant of dizziness and then he was whole again, screaming death at the four.The two packs crashed together, Scar carrying a couple of the Servant's members over the edge of the path.Arrows hummed around them.Wic Kwk Rac twisted, slashing axes at whatever remained standing.Then things were quiet, and Peregrine had his thoughts again.Three of the Servant's members twitched on the path, the earth around them slick with blood.He pushed them off the path, near where his Scar had killed the others.Not one of the Servant had survived; it was total death, and he was responsible.He sagged to the ground, seeing in fours again."The alien.It's still alive," said Scriber.He was standing around the travois, sniffing at the mantis like body."Not conscious though. "He grabbed the travois poles in his jaws and looked at Peregrine."What what now, Pilgrim?"Peregrine lay in the dirt, trying to put his mind back together.What now, indeed.How had he gotten into this mess?Newby confusion was the only possibility.He'd simply lost track of all the reasons why rescuing the alien was impossible.And now he was stuck with it.Pack crap.Part of him crawled to the edge of the path, and looked around: There was no sign they had attracted attention.In the harbor, the boats were still empty; most of the infantry was up in the hills.No doubt the Servants were holding the dead ones at the harbor fort.So when would they move them across the straits to Hidden Island?Were they waiting for this one's arrival?"Maybe we could grab some boats, escape south," said Scriber.What an ingenious fellow.Didn't he know that there would be sentry lines around the harbor?Even knowing the passwords, they'd be reported as soon as they passed one.It would be a million to one shot.But it had been a flat impossibility before Scar became part of him.He studied the creature lying on the travois.So strange, yet real.And it was more than just the creature, though that was the most spectacular strangeness.Its bloodied clothes were a finer fabric than the Pilgrim had ever seen.Tucked in beside the creature's body was a pink pillow with elaborate stitchery.With a twist of perspective he realized it was alien art, the face of a long snouted animal embroidered on the pillow.So escape through the harbor was a million to one shot; some prizes might be worth such odds."We'll go down a little farther," he said.Jaqueramaphan pulled the travois.Wickwrackscar strode ahead of him, trying to look important and officerly.With Scar along, it wasn't hard.The member was the picture of martial competence; you had to be on the inside to know the softness.They were almost down to sea level.The path was wider now and roughly paved.He knew the harbor fort was above them, hidden by the trees.The sun was well out of the north, rising into the eastern sky.Flowers were everywhere, white and red and violet, their tufts floating thick on the breeze  the arctic plant life taking advantage of its long day of summer.Walking on sun dappled cobblestones, you might almost forget the ambush on the hilltops.Very soon, they'd hit a sentry line.Lines and rings are interesting people; not great minds, but about the largest effective pack you'd find outside the tropics.There were stories of lines ten miles long, with thousands of members.The largest Peregrine had ever seen had less than one hundred: Take a group of ordinary people and train them to string out, not in packs but as individual members.If each member stayed just a few yards from its nearest neighbors, they could maintain something like the mentality of a trio.The group as a whole was scarcely brighter  you can't have much in the way of deep thoughts when it takes seconds for an idea to percolate across your mind.Yet the line had an excellent grasp of what was happening along itself.And if any members were attacked, the entire line would know about it with the speed of sound.Peregrine had served on lines before; it was a strung out existence, but not nearly as dull as ordinary sentry duty.It's hard to be bored when you're as stupid as a line.There!A lone member stuck its neck around a tree and challenged them.Wickwrackscar knew the password of course, and they were past the outer line.But that passage and their description was known to the entire line now  and surely to normal soldiers at the harbor fort.Hell.There was no cure for it; he would go ahead with the crazy scheme.He and Scriber and the alien member passed through the two inner sentries.He could smell the sea now.They came out of the trees onto the rock walled harbor.Silver sparkled off the water in a million changing flecks.A large multiboat bobbed between two piers.Its masts were like a forest of tilting, leafless trees.Just a mile across the water they could see Hidden Island.Part of him dismissed the sight as a commonplace; part of him stumbled in awe.This was the center of it, the worldwide Flenser movement.Up in those dour towers, the original Flenser had done his experiments, written his essays and schemed to rule the world.There were a few people on the piers.Most were doing maintenance: sewing sails, relashing twinhulls.They watched the travois with sharp curiosity, but none approached.So all we have to do is amble down to the end of the pier, cut the lashings on an outside twinhull, and take off.There were probably enough packs on the pier alone to prevent that  and their cries would surely draw the troops he saw by the harbor fort.In fact, it was a little surprising that no one up there had taken serious notice of them yet.These boats were cruder than the Southseas version.Part of the difference was superficial: Flenser doctrine forbade idle decoration on boats.Part of it was functional: These craft were designed for both winter and summer seasons, and for troop hauling.But he was sure he could sail them given the chance.He walked to the end of the pier.Hmm.A bit of luck.The bow starboard twinhull, the one right next to him by the pier, looked fast and well provisioned.It was probably a long range scout."Ssst.Something's going on up there. "Scriber jerked a head toward the fort.The troops were closing ranks  a mass salute?Five Servants swept by the infantry, and bugles sounded from the fort's towers.Scar had seen things like this, but Peregrine didn't trust the memory.How could  A banner of red and yellow rose over the fort.On the piers, soldiers and boatworkers dropped to their bellies.Peregrine dropped and hissed to the other, "Get down!""Wha  ?""That's Flenser's flag his personal presence banner!""That's impossible. "Flenser had been assassinated in the Republic six tendays earlier.The mob that tore him apart had killed dozens of his top supporters at the same time But it was only the word of the Republican Political Police that all Flenser's bodies had been recovered.Up by the fort, a single pack pranced between the ranks of soldiers and whitejackets.Silver and gold glinted on its shoulders.Scriber edged a member behind a piling and surreptitiously brought out his eye tool.After a moment: "Soul's end it's Tyrathect. ""She's no more the Flenser than I am," said Peregrine.They had traveled together from Eastgate all the way across the Icefangs.She was obviously a newby, and not well integrated.She had seemed reserved and innerlooking, but there had been rages.Peregrine knew there was a deadly streak in Tyrathect Now he guessed whence it came.At least some of Flenser's members had escaped assassination, and he and Scriber had spent three tendays in its presence; Peregrine shivered.At the fort's gate, the pack called Tyrathect turned to face the troops and Servants.She gestured, and bugles sounded again.The new Peregrine understood that signal: an Incalling.He suppressed the sudden urge to follow the others on the pier as they walked belly low toward the fort, all their eyes upon The Master.Scriber looked back at him, and Peregrine nodded.They had needed a miracle, and here was one  provided by the enemy itself!Scriber moved slowly toward the end of the pier, pulling the travois from shadow to shadow.Still no one looked back.For good reason; Wickwrackscar remembered what happened to those showing disrespect at an Incalling."Pull the creature on the bow starboard boat," he said to Jaqueramaphan.He leaped off the pier and scattered across the multiboat.It was great to be back on swaying decks, each member drifting a different direction!He sniffed among the bow catapults, listened to the hulls and the creak of the lashings.But Scar was no sailor, and had no recollection of what might be the most important thing."What are you looking for?"came Scriber's Hightalk hiss."Scuttle knockouts. "If they were here, they looked nothing like the Southseas version."Oh," said Scriber, "that's easy.These are Northern Skimmers.There are swingout panels and a thin hull behind. "Two of him dropped from sight for a second and there was a banging sound.The heads reappeared, shaking water off.He grinned surprise, taken aback by his own success."Why, it's just like in the books!"his expression seemed to say.Wickwrackscar found them now; the panels had looked like crew rests, but they were easily pulled out and the wood behind was easy to break with a battle axe.He kept a head out, looking to see if he were attracting attention, while at the same time he hacked at the knockouts.Peregrine and Scriber worked their way across the bow ranks of the multiboat; if those foundered, it would take a while to get the twinhulls behind them free.Oops.One of the boat workers was looking back this way.Part of the fellow continued up the hillside, part strained to return to the pier.The bugles sounded their imperative once more, and the pack followed the call.But his whining alarums were causing other heads to turn.No time for stealth.Peregrine hotfooted it back to the bow starboard twinhull.Scriber was cutting the braid bone fasteners that held the twinhull to the rest of the ship."You have any sailing experience?"Peregrine said.Foolish question."Well, I've read about it  "  "Fine!"Peregrine shooed him all into the twinhull's starboard pod."Keep the alien safe.Hunker down, and be as quiet as you can. "He could sail the twinhull by himself, but he'd have to be all over to do it; the fewer confusing thought sounds, the better.Peregrine poled their boat forward from the multiboat.The scuttling wasn't obvious yet, but he could see water in the bow hulls.He reversed his pole and used its hook to draw the nearest boat into the gap created by their departure.Another five minutes and there'd be just a row of masts sticking out of the water.Five minutes.No way they could make it if not for Flenser's Incalling: up by the fort, troopers were turning and pointing at the harbor.Yet still they must attend on Flenser/Tyrathect.How long would it be before someone important decided that even an Incalling can be overridden?He hoisted canvas.The wind caught the twinhull's sail and they pulled out from the pier.Peregrine danced this way and that, the shrouds grasped tightly in his mouths.Even without Rum, what memories the taste of salt and cordage brought back!He could feel where tautness and slack meant that the wind was giving all it could.The twin hulls were sleek and narrow, the mast of ironwood creaking as the wind pulled on the sail.The Flenserists were streaming down the hillside now.Archers stopped and a haze of arrows rose.Peregrine jerked on the shrouds, tipping the boat into a left turn on one hull.Scriber leaped to shield the alien.To starboard ahead of them the water puckered, but only a couple of shafts struck the boat.Peregrine twisted the shrouds again, and they jigged back in the other direction.Another few seconds and they'd be out of bowshot.Soldiers raced down to the piers, shrieking as they saw what was left of their ship.The bow ranks were flooded; the whole front of the anchorage was a wreck of sunken boats.And the catapults were in the bow.Peregrine swept his boat back, racing straight south, out of the harbor.To starboard, he could see they were passing the southern tip of Hidden Island.The Castle towers hung tall and ominous.He knew there were heavy catapults there, and some fast boats in the island harbor.A few more minutes and even that wouldn't matter.He was gradually realizing just how nimble their boat was.He should have guessed they'd put their best in a corner bow position.It was probably used for scouting and overtaking.Jaqueramaphan was piled up at the stern of his hull, staring across the water at the mainland harbor.Soldiers, workers, whitejackets were crowded in a mind numbing jumble at the ends of the piers.Even from here, you could see the place was a madhouse of rage and frustration.A silly grin spread across Scriber as he realized they really were going to make it.He clambered onto the rail and jumped into the air to flip a member at their enemies.The obscene gesture nearly cast him overboard, but it was seen: the distant rage brightened for a moment.They were well south of Hidden Island; even its catapults could not reach them now.The packs on the mainland shore were lost to view.Flenser's personal banner still whipped cheerfully in the morning breeze, a dwindling square of red and yellow against the forest's green.All Peregrine looked at the narrows, where Whale Island kissed close to the mainland.His Scar remembered that the choke point was heavily fortified.Normally that would have been the end of them.But its archers had been withdrawn to participate in the ambush, and its catapults were under repair.so the miracle had happened.They were alive and free and they had the greatest find of all his pilgrimage.He shouted joy so loud that Jaqueramaphan cowered and the sound echoed back from the green and snow patched hills.Jefri Olsndot had few clear memories of the ambush and saw none of the violence.There had been the noises outside, and Mom's terrified voice, screaming for him to stay inside.Then there had been lots of smoke.He remembered choking, trying to crawl to clear air.He blacked out.When he woke, he was strapped onto some sort of first aid cot, with the big dog creatures all around.They looked so funny with their white jackets and braid.He remembered wondering where their owners were.They made the strangest noises: gobbling, buzzing, hissing.Some of it was so high pitched he could barely hear it.For while he was on a boat, then on a wheeled cart.Before this, he had only seen pictures of castles, but the place they took him was the real thing, its towers dark and overhanging, its big stone walls sharply angled.They climbed through shadowed streets that went skumpety skumpety beneath the cart's wheels.The long necked dogs hadn't hurt him, but the straps were awfully tight.He couldn't sit up; he couldn't see to the sides.He asked about Mom and Dad and Johanna, and he cried a little.A long snout appeared by his face, the soft nose pushing at his cheek.There was a buzzing sound he felt all the way down to his bones.He couldn't tell if the gesture was comfort or threat, but he gasped and tried to stop the tears.They didn't befit a good Straumer, anyway.More white jacketed dogs, ones with silly shoulder patches of gold and silver.His cot was being dragged again, this time down a torch lit tunnel.They stopped by a double door, two meters wide but scarcely one high.A pair of metal triangles was set in the blond wood.Later Jefri learned they signified a number  fifteen or thirty three, depending on whether you counted by legs or fore claws.Much, much later he learned that his keeper had counted by legs and the builder of the castle by fore claws.Thus he ended up in the wrong room.It was a mistake that would change the history of worlds.Somehow the dogs opened the doors and dragged Jefri in.They clustered around the cot, their snouts tugging loose his restraints.He had a glimpse of rows of needle sharp teeth.The gobbling and buzzing was very loud.When Jefri sat up, they backed off.Two of them held the doors as the other four exited.The doors slammed shut and the circus act was gone.Jefri stared at the doors for a long moment.He knew it was no circus act; the dog things must be intelligent.Somehow they had surprised his parents and sister.Where are they?He almost started to cry again.He hadn't seen them by the spaceship.They must have been captured, too.They were all being held prisoner in this castle, but in separate dungeons.Somehow they must find each other!He climbed to his feet, swayed dizzily for a moment.Everything still smelled like smoke.It didn't matter; it was time to start working on getting out.He walked around the room.It was huge, and not like any dungeon he'd seen in stories.The ceiling was very high, an arching dome.It was cut by twelve vertical slots.Sunlight fell in a dust moted stream from one of them, splashing off the padded wall.It was the room's only illumination, but more than enough on this sunny day.Low railed balconies stuck out from the four corners of the room just below the dome.He could see doors in the walls behind them.Heavy scrolls hung by the side of each balcony.There was writing on them, really big print.He walked to the wall and felt the stiff fabric.The letters were painted on.The only way you could change the display was by rubbing it out.Wow.Just like olden times on Nyjora, before Straumli Realm!The baseboard below the scrolls was black stone, glossy.Someone had used scraps of chalk to draw on it.The stick figure dogs were crude; they reminded Jefri of pictures little kids draw in kinderschool.He stopped, remembering all the children they had left aboard the boat, and on the ground around it.Just a few days ago, he'd been playing with them at the High Lab school.The last year had been so strange  boring and adventurous at the same time.The barracks had been fun with all the families together, but the grownups hardly ever had time to play.At night the sky was so different from Straum's."We're beyond the Beyond," Mom had said, "making God. "When she first said it, she laughed.Later when people said it, they seemed more and more scared.The last hours had been crazy, the coldsleep drills finally for real.All his friends were in those boxes He wept into the awful silence.There was no one to hear, no one to help him.After a few moments he was thinking again.If the dogs didn't try to open the boxes, his friends should be okay.If Mom and Dad could make the dogs understand  Strange furniture was scattered around the room: low tables and cabinets, and racks like kids' jungle gyms  all made from the same blond wood as the doors.Black pillows lay around the widest table.That one was littered with scrolls, all full of writing and still drawings.He walked the length of one wall, ten meters or so.The stone flooring ended.There was a two by two bed of gravel where the walls met.Something smelled even stronger than smoke here.A bathroom smell.Jefri laughed: they really were like dogs!The padded walls soaked up his laughter, echoless.Something made Jefri look up and across the room.He'd just assumed he was alone here; in fact, there were lots of hiding places in this "dungeon. "For a moment, he held his breath and listened.All was silent almost: at the top of his hearing, up where some machines wheep, and Mom and Dad and even Johanna couldn't hear  there was something."I  I know you're here," Jefri said sharply, his voice squeaking.He stepped sideways a few paces, trying to see around the furniture without approaching it.The sound continued, obvious now that he was listening to it.A small head with great dark eyes looked around a cabinet.It was much smaller than the creatures that had brought Jefri here, but the shape of the muzzle was the same.They stared at each other for a moment, and then Jefri edged slowly toward it.A puppy?The head withdrew, then came further out.From the corner of his eye, Jefri saw something move  another of the black forms was peering at him from under the table.Jefri froze for a second, fighting panic.But there was no place to run, and maybe the creatures would help find Mom.Jefri dropped to one knee and slowly extended his hand."Here   here, doggy. "The puppy crawled from beneath the table, its eyes never leaving Jefri's hand.The fascination was mutual; the puppy was beautiful.Considering all the thousands of years that dogs have been bred by humans (and others), this could have been some oddball breed but only just.The hair was short and dense, a deep velour of black and white.The two tones lay in broad swaths with no intermediate grays.This one's entire head was black, its haunches split between white and black.The tail was a short, unimpressive flap covering its rear.There were hairless patches on its shoulders and head, where Jefri could see black skin.But the strangest thing was the long, supple neck.It would look more natural in a sea'mal than a dog.Jefri wiggled his fingers, and the puppy's eyes widened, revealing an edge of white around the iris.Something bumped his elbow, and Jefri almost jumped to this feet.So many!Two more had crept up to look at his hand.And where he had seen the first one there were now three, sitting alertly, watching.Seen in the open, there was nothing unfriendly or scary about them.One of the puppies put a paw on Jefri's wrist and pressed gently downward.At the same time, another extended its muzzle and licked Jefri's fingers.The tongue was pink and raspy, a round narrow thing.The high pitched wheeping got stronger; all three moved in, grabbing at his hand with their mouths."Be careful!"Jefri said, jerking back his hand.He remembered the grownups' teeth.Suddenly the air was full of gobbling and buzzing.Hmp.They sounded more like goofy birds than dogs.One of the other pups came forward.It extended a sleek nose toward Jefri."Be careful!"it said, a perfect playback of the boy's voice yet its mouth was closed.It angled its neck back to be petted?He reached out; the fur was so soft!The buzzing was very loud now.Jefri could feel it through the fur.But it wasn't just the one animal who was making it; the sound came from all directions.The puppy reversed direction, sliding its muzzle across the boy's hand.This time he let the mouth close on his fingers.He could see teeth all right, but the puppy carefully kept them from touching Jefri's skin.The tip of its snout felt like a pair of small fingers closing and opening around his.Three slipped under his other arm, like they wanted to be petted too.He felt noses poking at his back, trying to pull his shirt out of his pants.The effort was remarkably coordinated, almost as if a two handed human had grabbed his shirt.Just how many are there?For a moment he forgot where he was, forgot to be cautious.He rolled over and began petting the marauders.A surprised squeaking sound came from all directions.Two crawled beneath his elbows; at least three jumped on his back and lay with their noses touching his neck and ears.And Jefri had what seemed a great insight: The adult aliens had recognized he was a child; they just didn't know how old.They had put him in one of their own kinderschools!Mom and Dad were probably talking to them right now.Things were going to turn out all right after all.Lord Steel had not taken his name casually: steel, the most modern of metals; steel, that takes the sharpest edge and never loses it; steel, that can glow red hot, and yet not fail; steel, the blade that cuts for the flenser.Steel was a crafted person, Flenser's greatest success.In some sense, the crafting of souls was nothing new.Brood kenning was a limited form of it, though mainly concerned with gross physical characteristics.Even kenners agreed that a pack's mental abilities derived from its various members in different measures.One pair or triple was almost always responsible for eloquence, another for spatial intuition.The virtues and vices were even more complex.No single member was the principal source of courage, or of conscience.Flenser's contribution to the field  as to most others  had been an essential ruthlessness, a cutting away of all but the truly important.He experimented endlessly, discarding all but the most successful results.He depended on discipline and denial and partial death as much as on clever member selection.He already had seventy years of experience when he created Steel.Before he could take his name, Steel spent years in denial, determining just what parts of him combined to produce the being desired.That would have been impossible without Flenser's enforcement.(Example: if you dismissed a part of yourself essential for tenacity, where could you get the will to continue the flensing?)For the soul in creation, the process was mental chaos, a patchwork of horror and amnesia.In two years he had experienced more change than most people do in two centuries  and all of it directed.The turning point came when he and Flenser identified the trio that weighed him down with both conscience and slowness of intellect.One of the three bridged the others.Sending it into silence, replacing it with just the right element, had made the difference.After that, the rest was easy; Steel was born.When Flenser had left to convert the Long Lakes Republic, it was only natural that his most brilliant creation should take over here.For five years Steel had ruled Flenser's heartland.In that time he had not only conserved what Flenser built, he extended it beyond the cautious beginnings.But today, in a single circling of the sun about Hidden Island, he could lose everything.Steel stepped into the meeting hall and looked around.Refreshments were properly set.Sunlight streamed from a ceiling slit onto just the place he wanted.Part of Shreck, his aide, stood on the far side of the room.He said to it, "I will speak with the visitor alone. "He did not use the name "Flenser".The whitejackets groveled back and its unseen members pushed open the far doors.A fivesome  three males and two females  walked through the doorway, into the splash of sunlight.The individual was unremarkable.But then Flenser had never had an imposing appearance.Two heads raised to shade the eyes of the others.The pack looked across the room, spotting Lord Steel twenty yards away."Ah h Steel. "The voice was gentle, like a scalpel petting the short hairs of your throat.Steel had bowed when the other entered, a formal gesture.The voice caused a sudden cramp in his guts, and he involuntarily brought bellies to the ground.That was his voice!There was at least a fragment of the original Flenser in this pack.The gold and silver epaulets, the personal banner, those could be faked by anyone with suicidal bravado But Steel remembered the manner.He wasn't surprised the other's presence had destroyed discipline on the mainland this morning.The pack's heads, where they were in sunlight, were expressionless.Was a smile playing about the heads in shadow?"Where are the others, Steel?What happened today is the greatest opportunity of our history. "Steel got off his bellies and stood at the railing."Sir.There are some questions first, just between the two of us.Clearly, you are much of Flenser, but how much  "  The other was clearly grinning now, the shadowed heads bobbing."Yes, I knew my best creation would see that question This morning, I claimed to be the true Flenser, improved with one or two replacements.The truth is harder.You know about the Republic. "That had been Flenser's greatest gamble: to flense an entire nation state.Millions would die, yet even so there would be more molding than killing.In the end, there would exist the first collective outside of the tropics.And the Flenser state would not be a mindless agglomeration grubbing about in some jungle.The top would be as brilliant, as ruthless as any packs in history.No people in the world could stand against such a force."It was an awesome risk to take, for an even more awesome goal.But I took precautions.We had thousands of converts, many of them people with no understanding of our true ambition, but faithful and self sacrificing  as they should be.I always kept a special group of them nearby.The Political Police were clever to use mob assassination against me, the last thing I had expected  I who made the mobs.No matter, my bodyguards were well trained.When we were trapped in Parliament Bowl, they killed one or two members of each of those special packs and I simply ceased to exist, dispersed among three panicky, ordinary people trying to escape the blood swamp. ""But everyone around you was killed; the mob left no one. "The Flenser thing shrugged."That was partly Republican propaganda, and partly my own work: I ordered my guards to hack each other down, along with everyone who was not me. "Steel almost voiced his awe.The plan was typical of Flenser's brilliance, and his strength of soul.In assassinations, there was always the chance that fragments would get away.There were famous stories of heroes reassembled.In real life such events were rare, usually happening when the victim's forces could sustain their leader through reintegration.But Flenser had planned this tactic from the beginning, had envisaged reassembling himself more than a thousand miles from the Long Lakes.Still Lord Steel looked at the other in calculation.Ignore voice and manner.Think for power, not for the desires of others, even Flenser.Steel recognized only two in the other pack.The females and the male with the white tipped ears were probably from the sacrificed follower.Very likely only two of Flenser really faced him.Scarcely a threat except in the very real sense of appearances."And the other four of you, Sir?When may we expect your entire presence?"The Flenser thing chuckled.Damaged as it was, it still understood balance of power.This was almost like the old days: when two people have a clear understanding of power and betrayal, then betrayal itself becomes almost impossible.There is only the ordered flow of events, bringing good to those who deserve to rule."The others have equally good mounts.I made detailed plans, three different paths, three different sets of agents.I arrived on schedule.I have no doubt the others will too, in a few tendays at most.Until then," he turned all heads toward Steel, "until then, dear Steel, I do not claim the full role of Flenser.I did so earlier to establish priorities, to protect this fragment till I am assembled.But this pack is deliberately weak minded; I know it wouldn't survive as the ruler of my earlier creations. "Steel wondered.Half brained, the creature's schemes were perfect.Nearly perfect."So you wish a background role for the next few tendays?Very well.But you announced yourself as Flenser.How shall I present you?"The other didn't hesitate."Tyrathect, Flenser in Waiting. "Crypto: 0  As received by: Transceiver Relay03 at Relay  Language path: Samnorsk Triskweline, SjK:Relay units  From: Straumli Main  Subject: Archive opened in the Low Transcend!Summary: Our links to the Known Net will be down temporarily  Key phrases: transcend, good news, business opportunities, new archive, communications problems  Distribution:  Where Are They Now Interest Group, Homo Sapiens Interest Group, Motley Hatch Administration Group, Transceiver Relay03 at Relay, Transceiver Windsong at Debley Down, Transceiver Not for Long at Shortstop  Date: 11:45:20 Docks Time, 01/09 of Org year 52089  Text of message:  We are proud to announce that a human exploration company from Straumli Realm has discovered an accessible archive in the Low Transcend.This is not an announcement of Transcendence or the creation of a new Power.We have in fact postponed this announcement until we were sure of our property rights and the safety of the archive.We have installed interfaces which should make the archive interoperable with standard syntax queries from the Net.In a few days this access will be made commercially available.(See discussion of scheduling problems below. )Because of its safety, intelligibility, and age, this Archive is remarkable.We believe there is otherwise lost information here about arbitration management and interrace coordination.We'll send details to the appropriate news groups.We're very excited about this.Note that no interaction with the Powers was necessary; no part of Straumli Realm has transcended.Now for the bad news: Arbitration and translation schemes have had unfortunate clenirations[?]with the ridgeway armiphlage[?].The details should be amusing to the people in the Communication Threats news group, and we will report them there later.But for at least the next hundred hours, all our links (main and minor) to the Known Net will be down.Incoming messages may be buffered, but no guarantees.No messages can be forwarded.We regret this inconvenience, and will make up for it very soon!Physical commerce is in no way affected by these problems.Straumli Realm continues to welcome tourists and trade.Looking back, Ravna Bergsndot saw it was inevitable that she become a librarian.As a child on Sjandra Kei, she had been in love with stories from the Age of Princesses.There was adventure, a time when a few brave Ladies had dragged humankind to greatness.She and her sister had spent countless afternoons pretending to be the Greater Two and rescuing the Countess of the Lake.Later they understood that Nyjora and its Princesses were lost in the dim past.Sister Lynne turned to more practical things.But Ravna still wanted adventure.Through her teens, she had dreamed of emigrating to Straumli Realm.That was something very real.Imagine: a new and mostly human colony, right at the Top of the Beyond.And Straum welcomed folk from the mother world; their enterprise was less than one hundred years old.They or their children would be the first humans anywhere in the galaxy to transcend their own humanity.She might end up a god, and richer than a million Beyonder worlds.It was a dream real enough to provoke constant arguments with her parents.For where there is heaven, there can also be hell.Straumli Realm kissed close to the Transcend, and the people there played with "the tigers that pace beyond the bars. "Dad had actually used that tired image.The disagreement drove them apart for several years.Then, in her Computer Science and Applied Theology courses, Ravna began to read about some of the old horrors.Maybe, maybe she should be a little more cautious.Better to look around first.And there was a way to see into everything that humans in the Beyond could possibly understand: Ravna became a librarian."The ultimate dilettante!"Lynne had teased."It's true and so what?"Ravna had grumped back, but the dream of far traveling was not quite dead in her.Life in Herte University at Sjandra Kei should have been perfect for someone who had finally figured out what they wanted from life.Things might have gone on happily for a lifetime there  except that in her graduation year, there had been the Vrinimi Organization's Faraway 'Prentice contest.Three years work study at the archive by Relay was the prize.Winning was the chance of a lifetime; she would come back with more experience than any local academician.So it was that Ravna Bergsndot ended up more than twenty thousand light years from home, at the network hub of a million worlds.Sunset was an hour past when Ravna drifted across Citypark toward Grondr Vrinimikalir's residence.She'd been on the planet only a handful of times since arriving in the Relay system.Most of her work was at the archives themselves  a thousand light hours out.This part of Groundside was in early autumn, though twilight had faded the tree colors to bands of gray.From Ravna's altitude, one hundred meters up, the air had the nip of frosts to come.Between her feet she could see picnic fires and gaming fields.The Vrinimi Organization didn't spend much on the planet, but the world was beautiful.As long as she kept her eyes on the darkening ground, Ravna could almost imagine this was someplace in her home terrane on Sjandra Kei.Look into the sky though and you knew you were far from home: twenty thousand light years away, the galactic whirlpool sprawled up toward the zenith.It was just a faint thing in the twilight, and it might not get much brighter this night: Low in the western sky, a cluster of in system factories glowed brighter than any moon.The operation was a brilliant flickering of stars and rays, sometimes so intense that stark shadows were cast eastwards from the Citypark mountains.In another half hour, the Docks would rise.The Docks weren't as bright as the factories, but together they would outshine anything from the far stars.She shifted in her agrav harness, drifting lower.The scent of autumn and picnics came stronger.Suddenly, the click of Kalir laughter was all around her; she had blundered into an airball game.Ravna spread her arms in mock humiliation and dodged out of the players' way.Her stroll through the park was just about over; she could see her destination ahead.Grondr 'Kalir's residence was a rarity in the Citypark landscape: a recognizable building.It dated from when the Org bought into the Relay operation.Seen from just eighty meters up, the house was a blocky silhouette against the sky.When factory lights flashed, the smooth walls of the monolith glowed in oily tints.Grondr was her boss's boss's boss.She had talked to him exactly three times in two years.No more delay.Nervous and very curious, Ravna floated lower and let the house electronics guide her across the tree decks toward an entrance.Grondr Vrinimikalir treated her with standard Organization courtesy, the common denominator that served between the several races of the Org: The meeting room had furniture suitable for human and Vrinimi use.There were refreshments, and questions about her job at the archive."Mixed results, sir," Ravna replied honestly."I've learned a great deal.The 'prenticeship is everything it's claimed to be.But I'm afraid the new division is going to require an added index layer. "All this was in reports the old fellow could have seen at the flick of a digit.Grondr rubbed a hand absently across his eye freckles."Yes, an expected disappointment.We're at the limits of information management with this expansion.Egravan and Derche  " those were Ravna's boss and boss's boss " are quite happy with your progress.You came well educated, and learned fast.I think there's a place for humans in the Organization. ""Thank you, sir. "Ravna blushed.Grondr's assessment was casually spoken but very important to her.And it would probably mean the arrival of more humans, perhaps even before her 'prenticeship was up.So was this the reason for the interview?She tried not to stare at the other.She was quite used to the Vrinimi majority race by now.From a distance the Kalir looked humanoid.Up close, the differences were substantial.The race was descended from something like an insect.In upsizing, evolution had necessarily moved reinforcing struts inside the body, till the outside was a combination of grublike skin and sheets of pale chitin.At first glance Grondr was an unremarkable exemplar of the race.But when the fellow moved, even to adjust his jacket or scratch at his eye freckles, there was a strange precision to him.Egravan said that he was very, very old.Grondr changed the subject with the clickety abruptness."You are aware of the changes at Straumli Realm?""You mean the fall of Straum?Yes. "Though I'm surprised you are.Straumli Realm was a significant human civilization, but it accounted for only an infinitesimal fraction of Relay's message traffic."Please accept my sympathy. "Despite the cheerful announcements from Straum, it was clear that absolute disaster had befallen Straumli Realm.Almost every race eventually dabbled in the Transcend, more often than not becoming a superintelligence, a Power.But it was clear by now that the Straumers had created, or awakened, a Power of deadly inclination.Their fate was as terrible as anything Ravna's father had ever predicted.And their bad luck was now a disaster that stretched across all that had been Straumli Realm.Grondr continued: "Will this news affect your work?"Curiouser and curiouser; she would have sworn the other was coming to the point.Maybe this was the point?"Uh, no sir.The Straumli affair is a terrible thing, especially for humankind.But my home is Sjandra Kei.Straumli Realm is our offspring, but I have no relatives there. "Though I might have been there if it hadn't been for Mother and Dad.Actually, when Straumli Main dropped off the Net, Sjandra Kei had been unreachable for almost forty hours.That had bothered her very much, since any rerouting should have been immediate.Communication was eventually established; the problem had been screwed up routing tables on an alternate path.Ravna had even shot half a year's savings for an over and back mailing.Lynne and her parents were fine; the Straumli debacle was the news of the century for folks at Sjandra Kei, but it was still a disaster at great remove.Ravna wondered if parents had ever given better advice than hers!"Good, good. "His mouth parts moved in the analog of a human nod.His head tilted so only peripheral freckles were looking at her; the guy actually seemed hesitant!Ravna looked back silently.Grondr 'Kalir might be the strangest exec in the Org.He was the only one whose principal residence was Groundside.Officially he was in charge of a division of the archives; in fact, he ran Vrinimi Marketing (i. e. , Intelligence).There were stories that he had visited the Top of the Beyond; Egravan claimed he had an artificial immune system."You see, the Straumli disaster has incidentally made you one of the Organization's most valuable employees. ""I don't understand. ""Ravna, the rumors in the Threats newsgroup are true.The Straumers had a laboratory in the Low Transcend.They were playing with recipes from some lost archive, and they created a new Power.It appears to be a Class Two perversion. "The Known Net recorded a Class Two perversion about once a century.Such Powers had a normal "lifespan"  about ten years.But they were explicitly malevolent, and in ten years could do enormous damage.Poor Straum."So you can see there's enormous potential for profit or loss here.If the disaster spreads, we will lose network customers.On the other hand, everyone around Straumli Realm wants to track what is happening.This could increase our message traffic by several percent. "Grondr put it more cold bloodedly than she liked, but he had a point.In fact, the opportunity for profit was directly linked with mitigating the perversion.If she hadn't been so wrapped up in archive work, she'd have guessed all this.And now that she did think about it: "There are even more spectacular opportunities.Historically, these perversions have been of interest to other Powers.They'll want Net feeds and information about the creating race. "Her voice guttered into silence as she finally understood the reason for this meeting.Grondr's mouth parts clicked agreement."Indeed.We at Relay are well placed to supply news to the Transcend.And we also have our own human.In the last three days we've received several dozen queries from civilizations in the High Beyond, some claiming to represent Powers.This interest could mean a large increase in Organization income through the next decade."All this you could read in the Threats news group.But there is another item, something I ask you to keep secret for now: Five days ago, a ship from the Transcend entered our region.It claims to be directly controlled by a Power. "The wall behind him became a window upon the visitor.The craft was an irregular collection of spines and limps.A scale bar claimed the thing was only five meters across.Ravna felt the hair on her neck prickling.Here in the Middle Beyond they should be relatively safe from the caprice of the Powers.Still the visit was an unnerving thing."What does it want?""Information about the Straumli perversion.In particular, it is very interested in your race.It would give a great deal to take back a living human"  Ravna's response was abrupt."I'm not interested. "Grondr spread his pale hands.The light glittered from the chitin on the back of his fingers."It would be an enormous opportunity.A 'prenticeship with the gods.This one has promised to establish an oracle here in return. ""No!"Ravna half rose from her chair.She was one human, more than twenty thousand light years from home.That had been a frightening thing in the first days of her 'prenticeship.Since then she had made friends, had learned more of Organization ethics, had come to trust these folk almost as much as people at Sjandra Kei.But there was only one halfway trustable oracle on the Net these days, and it was almost ten years old.This Power was tempting Vrinimi Org with fabulous treasure.Grondr clicked embarrassment.He waved her back to her chair."It was only a suggestion.We do not abuse our employees.If you will simply serve as our local expert"  Ravna nodded."Good.Frankly, I had not expected you to accept the offer.We have a much more likely volunteer, but one who needs coaching. ""A human?Here?"Ravna had a standing query in the local directory for other humans.During the last two years she had seen three, and they had just been passing through."How long has she  he?been here?"Grondr said something halfway between a smile and a laugh."A bit more than a century, though we didn't realize it until a few days ago. "The pictures around him shifted.Ravna recognized Relay's "attic," the junkyard of abandoned ships and freight devices that floated just a thousand light seconds from the archives."We receive a lot of one way freight, items shipped in the hope we'll buy or sell on consignment. "The view closed on a decrepit vessel, perhaps two hundred meters long, wasp waisted to support a ramscoop drive.Its ultradrive spines were scarcely more than stubs."A bottom lugger?"said Ravna.Grondr clicked negation."A dredge.The ship is about thirty thousand years old.Most of that time was spent in a deep penetration of the Slow Zone, plus ten thousand years in the Unthinking Depths. "Up close now, she could see the hull was finely pitted, the result of millennia of relativistic erosion.Even unpiloted, such expeditions were rare: a deep penetration could not return to the Beyond within the lifetime of its builders.Some would not return within the lifetime of the builders' race.People who launched such missions were just a little weird; People who recovered them could make a solid profit."This one came from very far away, even if it's not quite a jackpot mission.It didn't see anything interesting in the Unthinking Depths  not surprising given that even simple automation fails there.We sold most of the cargo immediately.The rest we cataloged and forgot till the Straumli affair. "The starscape vanished.They were looking at a medical display, random limbs and body parts.They looked very human."In a solar system at the bottom of the Slowness, the dredge found a derelict.The wreck had no ultradrive capability; it was truly a Slow Zone design.The solar system was uninhabited.We speculate the ship had a structural failure  or perhaps the crew was affected by the Depths.Either way, they ended up in a frozen mangle. "Tragedy at the bottom of the Slowness, thousands of years ago.Ravna forced her eyes from the carnage."You figure on selling this to our visitor?""Even better.Once we started poking around, we discovered a substantial error in the cataloging.One of the deaders is almost intact.We patched it up with parts from the others.It was expensive, but we ended up with a living human. "The picture flickered again, and Ravna caught her breath.In the medical animation, the parts floated into an orderly arrangement.There was a complete body there, torn up a little in the belly.Pieces came together, and this was no "she".He floated whole and naked, as if in sleep.Ravna had no doubt of his humanity, but all humankind in the Beyond was descended from Nyjoran stock.This fellow had none of that heritage.The skin was smoky gray, not brown.The hair was bright reddish brown, a color she had only seen in pre Nyjoran histories.The bones of the face were subtly different from modern humans.The small differences were more jarring than the outright alienness of her coworkers.Now the figure was clothed.Under other circumstances, Ravna would have smiled.Grondr 'Kalir had picked an absurd costume, something from the Nyjoran era.The figure bore a sword and slug gun A sleeping prince from the Age of Princesses."Behold the Ur human," said Grondr."Relay" is a common place name.It has meaning in almost any environment.Like Newtown and Newhome, it occurs over and over when people move or colonize or participate in a communication net.You could travel a billion light years or a billion years and still find such names among folk of natural intelligence.But in the current era there was one instance of "Relay" known above all others.That instance appeared in the routing list of two percent of all traffic across the Known Net.Twenty thousand light years off the galactic plane, Relay had an unobstructed line of sight on thirty percent of the Beyond, including many star systems right at the bottom, where starships can make only one light year per day.A few metal bearing solar systems were equally well placed, and there was competition.But where other civilizations lost interest, or colonized into the Transcend, or died in apocalypse, Vrinimi Organization lasted.After fifty thousand years, there were several races of the original Org in its membership.None of those were still leaders  yet the original viewpoint and policies remained.Position and durability: Relay was now the main intermediate to the Magellanics, and one of the few sites with any sort of link to the Beyond in Sculptor.At Sjandra Kei, Relay's reputation had been fabulous.In her two years of 'prenticeship, Ravna had come to realize that the truth exceeded the reputation.Relay was in Middle Beyond; the Organization's only export was the relay function and access to the local archive.Yet they imported the finest biologicals and processing equipment from the High Beyond.The Relay Docks were an extravagance that only the absolutely rich could indulge.They stretched a thousand kilometers: bays, repair holds, transhipment centers, parks, and playgrounds.Even at Sjandra Kei there were habitats far larger.But the Docks were in no orbit.They floated a thousand kilometers above Groundside on the largest agrav frame Ravna had ever seen.At Sjandra Kei the annual income of an academician might pay for a square meter of agrav fabric  junk that might not last a year.Here there were millions of hectares of the stuff, supporting billions of tonnes.Just replacements for dead fabric required more High Beyond commerce than most star clusters could command.And now I have my own office here.Working directly for Grondr 'Kalir had its perks.Ravna kicked back in her chair and stared across the central sea.At the Docks' altitude, gravity was still about three quarters of a gee.Air fountains hung a breathable atmosphere over the middle part of the platform.The day before, she had taken a sailboat across the clear bottomed sea.That was a strange experience indeed: planetary clouds below your keel, stars and indigo sky above.She had the surf cranked up this morning  an easy matter of flexing the agravs of the basin.It made a regular crashing against her beach.Even thirty meters from the water there was a tang of salt in the air.Rows of white tops marched off into the distance.She eyed the figure that was trudging slowly up the beach toward her.Just a few weeks ago she would never have dreamed this situation.Just a few weeks ago she had been out at the archive, absorbed in the upgrade work, happy to be involved with one of the largest databases on the Known Net.Now   it was almost as if she had come full circle, back to her childhood dreams of adventure.the only problem was, sometimes she felt like one of the bad guys: Pham Nuwen was a living person, not something to be sold.She stood and walked out to meet her red haired visitor.He wasn't carrying the sword and handgun of Grondr's fanciful animation.Yet his clothes were the braided fabric of ancient adventure, and he carried himself with lazy confidence.Since her meeting with Grondr, she had looked up some anthropology from Old Earth.The red hair and the eyefolds had been known there, though rarely in the same individual.Certainly his smoky skin would have been remarkable to an inhabitant of Earth.This fellow was, as much as herself, a product of post terrestrial evolution.He stopped an arm's length away and gave her a lopsided grin."You look pretty human.Ravna Bergsndot?"She smiled and nodded up at him."Mr.Pham Nuwen?""Yes indeed.We seem both to be excellent guessers. "He swept past her into the shade of the inner office.Cocky fellow.She followed him, unsure about protocol.You'd think with a fellow human there would be no problems  Actually, the interview went pretty smoothly.It was more than thirty days since Pham Nuwen's resuscitation.Much of that time had been spent in cram language sessions.The fellow must be damned bright; he already spoke Triskweline trade talk with a folksy slickness.He really was rather cute.Ravna had been away from Sjandra Kei for two years, and had another year of her 'prenticeship to go.She'd been doing pretty well.She had many close friends here, Egravan, Sarale.But just chatting with this fellow brought a lot of the loneliness back.In some ways he was more alien than anything at Relay and in some ways she wanted to just grab him and kiss his confident grin away.Grondr Vrinimikalir had been telling the truth about Pham Nuwen.The guy was actually enthusiastic about the Org's plans for him!In theory, that meant she could do her job with a clear conscience.In fact  "Mr.Nuwen, my job is to orient you to your new world.I know you've been exposed to some intense instruction the last few days, but there are limits to how fast such knowledge can sink in.
