Sloat decided.He got this started; he ought to be able to deal with Wheelright & Carpenter after handling Mrs.Pilsen.Milt said to Isidore, Just dont let them take the original.He held up Horace.Theyll want to because it makes their work a hell of a lot easier.Be firm.Um, Isidore said, blinking.Okay.Maybe I ought to call them now before it starts to decay.Dont dead bodies decay or something?He felt elated.8  After parking the departments speedy beefed up hovercar on the roof of the San Francisco Hall of Justice on Lombard Street, bounty hunter Rick Deckard, briefcase in hand, descended to Harry Bryants office.Youre back awfully soon, his superior said, leaning back in his chair and taking a pinch of Specific No.1 snuff.I got what you sent me for.Rick seated himself facing the desk.He set his briefcase down.Im tired, he realized.It had begun to hit him, now that he had gotten back; he wondered if he would be able to recoup enough for the job ahead.Hows Dave?he asked.Well enough for me to go talk to him?I want to before I tackle the first of the andys.Bryant said, Youll be trying for Polokov first.The one that lasered Dave.Best to get him right out of it, since he knows weve got him listed.Before I talk to Dave?Bryant reached for a sheet of onionskin paper, a blurred third or fourth carbon.Polokov has taken a job with the city as a trash collector, a scavenger.Dont only specials do that kind of work?Polokov is mimicking a special, an anthead.Very deterioratedor so he pretends to be.Thats what suckered Dave; Polokov apparently looks and acts so much like an anthead that Dave forgot.Are you sure about the Voigt Kampff scale now?Youre absolutely certain, from what happened up in Seattle, that  I am, Rick said shortly.He did not amplify.Bryant said, Ill take your word for it.But there cant be even one slip up.There never could be in andy hunting.This is no different.The Nexus 6 is different.I already found my first one, Rick said.And Dave found two.Three, if you count Polokov.Okay, Ill retire Polokov today, and then maybe tonight or tomorrow talk to Dave.He reached for the blurred carbon, the poop sheet on the android Polokov.One more item, Bryant said.A Soviet cop, from the W. P. O. , is on his way here.While you were in Seattle I got a call from him; hes aboard an Aeroflot rocket thatll touch down at the public field, here, in about an hour.Sandor Kadalyi, his name is.Whats he want?Rarely if ever did W. P. O.  cops show up in San Francisco.W. P. O.  is enough interested in the new Nexus 6 types that they want a man of theirs to be with you.An observer and also, if he can, hell assist you.Its for you to decide when and if he can be of value.But Ive already given him permission to tag along.What about the bounty?Rick said.You wont have to split it, Bryant said, and smiled creakily.I just wouldnt regard it as financially fair.He had absolutely no intention of sharing his winnings with a thug from W. P. O.  He studied the poop sheet on Polokov; it gave a description of the manor rather the andyand his current address and place of business: The Bay Area Scavengers Company with offices on Geary.Want to wait on the Polokov retirement until the Soviet cop gets here to help you?Bryant asked.Rick bristled.Ive always worked alone.Of course, its your decisionIll do whatever you say.But Id just as soon tackle Polokov right now, without waiting for Kadalyi to hit town.You go ahead on your own, Bryant decided.And then on the next one, whichll be a Miss Luba Luftyou have the sheet there on her, tooyou can bring in Kadalyi.Having stuffed the onionskin carbons in his briefcase, Rick left his superiors office and ascended once more to the roof and his parked hovercar.And now lets visit Mr.Polokov, he said to himself.He patted his laser tube.For his first try at the android Polokov, Rick stopped off at the offices of the Bay Area Scavengers Company.Im looking for an employee of yours, he said to the severe, gray haired switchboard woman.The scavengers building impressed him; large and modern, it held a good number of high cllass purely office employees.The deep pile carpets, the expensive genuine wood desks, reminded him that garbage collecting and trash disposal had, since the war, become one of Earths important industries.The entire planet had begun to disintegrate into junk, and to keep the planet habitable for the remaining population the junk had to be hauled away occasionally  or, as Buster Friendly liked to declare, Earth would die under a layernot of radioactive dustbut of kipple.Mr.Ackers, the switchboard woman informed him.Hes the personnel manager.She pointed to an impressive but imitation oak desk at which sat a prissy, tiny, bespectacled individual, merged with his plethora of paperwork.Rick presented his police ID.Wheres your employee Polokov right now?At his job or at home?After reluctantly consulting his records Mr.Ackers said, Polokov ought to be at work.Flattening hovercars at our Daly City plant and dumping them into the Bay.However The personnel manager consulted a further document, then picked up his vidphone and made an inside call to someone else in the building.Hes not, then, he said, terminating the call; hanging up he said to Rick, Polokov didnt show up for work today.No explanation.Whats he done, officer?If he should show up, Rick said, dont tell him I here asking about him.You understand?Yes, I understand, Ackers said sulkily, as if his deep schooling in police matters had been derided.In the departments beefed up hovercar Rick next flew to Polokovs apartment building in the Tenderloin.Well never get him, he told himself.TheyBryant and Holdenwaited too long.Instead of sending me to Seattle, Bryant should have sicced me on Polokovbetter still last night, as soon as Dave Holden got his.What a grimy place, he observed as he walked across the roof to the elevator.Abandoned animal pens, encrusted with months of dust.And, in one cage, a no longer functioning false animal, a chicken.By elevator he descended to Polokovs floor, found the hall limit, like a subterranean cave.Using his police A powered sealed beam light he illuminated the hall and once again glanced over the onionskin carbon.The Voigt Kampff test had been administered to Polokov; that part could be bypassed, and he could go directly to the task of destroying the android.Best to get him from out here, he decided.Setting down his weapons kit he fumbled it open, got out a nondirectional Penfield wave transmitter; he punched the key for catalepsy, himself protected against the mood emanation by means of a counterwave broadcast through the transmitters metal hull directed to him alone.Theyre now all frozen stiff, he said to himself as he shut off the transmitter.Everyone, human and andy alike, in the vicinity.No risk to me; all I have to do is walk in and laser him.Assuming, of course, that hes in his apartment, which isnt likely.Using an infinity key, which anayzed and opened all forms of locks known, he entered Polokovs apartment, laser beam in hand.No Polokov.Only semi ruined furniture, a place of kipple and decay.In fact no personal articles: what greeted him consisted of unclaimed debris which Polokov had inherited when he took the apartment and which in leaving he had abandoned to the nextif anytenant.I knew it, he said to himself.Well, there goes the first thousand dollars bounty; probably skipped all the way to the Antarctic Circle.Out of my jurisdiction; another bounty hunter from another police department will retire Polokov and claim the money.On, I suppose, to the andys who havent been warned, as was Polokov.On to Luba Luft.Back again on the roof in his hovercar he reported by phone to Harry Bryant.No luck on Polokov.Left probably right after he lasered Dave.He inspected his wristwatch.Want me to pick up Kadalyi at the field?Itll save time and Im eager to get started on Miss Luft.He already had the poop sheet on her laid out before him, had begun a thorough study of it.Good idea, Bryant said, except that Mr.Kadalyi is already here; his Aeroflot shipas usual, he saysarrived early.Just a moment.An invisible conference.Hell fly over and meet you where you are now, Bryant said, returning to the screen.Meanwhile read up on Miss Luft.An opera singer.Allegedly from Germany.At present attached to the San Francisco Opera Company.He nodded in reflexive agreement, mind on the poop sheet.Must have a good voice to make connections so fast.Okay, Ill wait here for Kadalyi.He gave Bryant his location and rang off.Ill pose as an opera fan, Rick decided as he read further.I particularly would like to see her as Donna Anna in Don Giovanni.In my personal collection I have tapes by such oldtime greats as Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and Lotte Lehmann and Lisa Della Casa; thatll give us something to discuss while I set up my Voigt Kampff equipment.His car phone buzzed.He picked up the receiver.The police operator said, Mr.Deckard, a call for Von from Seattle; Mr.Bryant said to put it through to you.From the Rosen Association.Okay, Rick said, and waited.What do they want?he wondered.As far as he could discern, the Rosens had already proven to be bad news.And undoubtedly would continue so, whatever they intended.Rachel Rosens face appeared on the tiny screen.Hello, Officer Deckard.Her tone seemed placating; that caught his attention.Are you busy right now or can I talk to you?Go ahead, he said.We of the association have been discussing your situation regarding the escaped Nexus 6 types and knowing them as we do we feel that youll have better luck if one of us works in conjunction with you.By doing what?Well, by one of us coming along with you.When you go out looking for them.Why?What would you add?Rachael said, The Nexus 6s would be wiry at being approached by a human.But if another Nexus 6 made the contact  You specifically mean yourself.Yes.She nodded, her face sober.Ive got too much help already.But I really think you need me.I doubt it.Ill think it over and call you back.At some distant, unspecified future time, he said to himself.Or more likely never.Thats all I need: Rachael Rosen popping up through the dust at every step.You dont really mean it, Rachael said.Youll never call me.You dont realize how agile an illegal escaped Nexus 6 is, how impossible itll be for you.We feel we owe you this because ofyou know.What we did.Ill take it under advisement.He started to hang up.Without me, Rachael said, one of them will get you before you can get it.Good by, he said and hung up.What kind of world is it, he asked himself, when an android phones up a bounty hunter and offers him assistance?He rang the police operator back.Dont put any more calls through to me from Seattle, he said.Yes, Mr.Deckard.Has Mr.Kadalyi reached you, yet?Im still waiting.And he had better hurry because Im not going to be here long.Again he hung up.As he resumed reading the poop sheet on Luba Luft a hovercar taxi spun down to land on the roof a few yards off.From it a red faced, cherubic looking man, evidently in his mid fifties, wearing a heavy and impressive Russian style greatcoat, stepped and, smiling, his hand extended, approached Ricks car.Mr.Deckard?the man asked with a Slavic accent.The bounty hunter for the San Francisco Police Department?The empty taxi rose, and the Russian watched it go, absently.Im Sandor Kadalyi, the man said, and opened the car door to squeeze in beside Rick.As he shook hands with Kadalyi, Rick noticed that the W. P. O.  representative carried an unusual type of laser tube, a subform which he had never seen before.Oh, this?Kadalyi said.Interesting, isnt it?He tugged it from his belt holster.I got this on Mars.I thought I knew every handgun made, Rick said.Even those manufactured at and for use in the colonies.We made this ourselves, Kadalyi said, beaming like a Slavic Santa, his ruddy face inscribed with pride.You like it?What is different about it, functionally, ishere, take it.He passed the gun over to Rick, who inspected it expertly, by way of years of experience.How does it differ functionally?Rick asked.He couldnt tell.Press the trigger.Aiming upward, out the window of the car, Rick squeezed the trigger of the weapon.Nothing happened; no beam emerged.Puzzled, he turned to Kadalyi.The triggering circuit, Kadalyi said cheerfully, isnt attached.It remains with me.You see?He opened his hand, revealed a tiny unit.And I can also direct it, within certain limits.Irrespective of where its aimed.Youre not Polokov, youre Kadalyi, Rick said.Dont you mean that the other way around?Youre a bit confused.I mean youre Polokov, the android; youre not from the Soviet police.Rick, with his toe, pressed the emergency button on the floor of his car.Why wont my laser tube fire?Kadalyi Polokov said, switching on and off the miniaturized triggering and aiming device which he held in the palm of his hand.A sine wave, Rick said.That phases out laser emanation and spreads the beam into ordinary light.Then Ill have to break your pencil neck.The android dropped the device and, with a snarl, grabbed with both hands for Ricks throat.As the androids hands sank into his throat Rick fired his regulation issue old style pistol from its shoulder holster; the .38 magnum slug struck the android in the head and its brain box burst.The Nexus 6 unit which operated it blew into pieces, a raging, mad wind which carried throughout the car.Bits of it, like the radioactive dust itself, whirled down on Rick.The retired remains of the android rocked back, collided with the car door, bounced off and struck heavily against him; he found himself struggling to shove the twitching remnants of the android away.Shakily, he at last reached for the car phone, called in to the Hall of Justice.Shall I make my report?he said.Tell Harry Bryant that I got Polokov.You got Polokov.Hell understand that, will he?Yes, Rick said, and hung up.Christ that came close, he said to himself.I must have overreacted to Rachael Rosens warning; I went the other way and it almost finished me.But I got Polokov, he said to himself.His adrenal gland, by degrees, ceased pumping its several secretions into his bloodstream; his heart slowed to normal, his breathing became less frantic.But he still shook.Anyhow I made myself a thousand dollars just now, he informed himself.So it was worth it.And Im faster to react than Dave Holden.Of course, however, Daves experience evidently prepared me; that has to be admitted.Dave had not had such warning.Again picking up the phone he placed a call home to his apt, to Iran.Meanwhile he managed to light a cigarette; the shaking had begun to depart.His wifes face, sodden with the six hour self accusatory depression which she had prophesied, manifested itself on the vidscreen.Oh hello, Rick.What happened to the 594 I dialed for you before I left?Pleased acknowledgment of  I redialed.As soon as you left.What do you want?Her voice sank into a dreary drone of despond.Im so tired and I just have no hope left, of anything.Of our marriageand you possibly getting killed by one of those andys.Is that what you want to tell me, Rick?That an andy got you?In the background the racket of Buster Friendly boomed and brayed, eradicating her words; he saw her mouth moving but heard only the TV.Listen, he broke in.Can you hear me?Im on to something.A new type of android that apparently nobody can handle but me.Ive retired one already, so thats a grand to start with.You know what were going to have before Im through?Iran stared at him sightlessly.Oh, she said, nodding.I havent said yet!He could tell, now; her depression this time had become too vast for her even to hear him.For all intents he spoke into a vacuum.Ill see you tonight, he finished bitterly and slammed the receiver down.Damn her, he said to himself.What good does it do, my risking my life?She doesnt care whether we own an ostrich or not; nothing penetrates.I wish I had gotten rid of her two years ago when we were considering splitting up.I can still do it, he reminded himself.Broodingly, he leaned down, gathered together on the car floor his crumpled papers, including the info on Luba Luft.No support, he informed himself.Most androids Ive known have more vitality and desire to live than my wife.She has nothing to give me.That made him think of Rachael Rosen again.Her advice to me as to the Nexus 6 mentality, he realized, turned out to be correct.Assuming she doesnt want any of the bounty money, maybe I could use her.The encounter with Kadalyi Polokov had changed his ideas rather massively.Snapping on his hovercars engine he whisked nippity nip up into the sky, heading toward the old War Memorial Opera House, where, according to Dive Holdens notes, he would find Luba Luft this time of the day.He wondered, now, about her, too.Some female androids seemed to him pretty; he had found himself physically attracted by several, and it was an odd sensation, knowing intellectually that they were machines but emotionally reacting anyhow.For example Rachael Rosen.No, he decided; shes too thin.No real development, especially in the bust.A figure like a childs, flat and tame.He could do better.How old did the poop sheet say Luba Luft was?As he drove he hauled out the now wrinkled notes, found her so called age.Twenty eight, the sheet read.Judged by appearance, which, with andys, was the only useful standard.Its a good thing I know something about opera, Rick reflected.Thats another advantage I have over Dave; Im more culturally oriented.Ill try one more andy before I ask Rachael for help, he decided.If Miss Luft proves exceptionally hardbut he had an intuition she wouldnt.Polokov had been the rough one; the others, unaware that anyone actively hunted them, would crumble in succession, plugged like a file of ducks.As he descended toward the ornate, expansive roof of the opera house he loudly sang a potpourri of arias, with pseudo Italian words made up on the spot by himself; even without the Penfield mood organ at hand his spirits brightened into optimism.And into hungry, gleeful anticipation.9  In the enormous whale belly of steel and stone carved out to form the long enduring old opera house Rick Deckard found an echoing, noisy, slightly miscontrived rehearsal taking place.As he entered he recognized the music: Mozarts The Magic Flute, the first act in its final scenes.The moors slavesin other words the chorushad taken up their song a bar too soon and this had nullified the simple rhythm of the magic bells.What a pleasure; he loved The Magic Flute.He seated himself in a dress circle scat (no one appeared to notice him) and made himself comfortable.Now Popageno in his fantastic pelt of bird feathers had joined Pamina to sing words which always brought tears to Ricks eyes, when and if he happened to think about it.Knnte jedar brave Mann 		solche Glckchen finden, 		eine Feinde wrden dann 		ohne Muhe schwinden.Well, Rick thought, in real life no such magic bells exist that make your enemy effortlessly disappear.Too bad.And Mozart, not long after writing The Magic Flute, had died in his thirtiesof kidney disease.And had been buried in an unmarked paupers grave.Thinking this he wondered if Mozart had had any intuition that the future did not exist, that he had already used up his little time.Maybe I have, too, Rick thought as he watched the rehearsal move along.This rehearsal will end, the performance will end, the singers will die, eventually the last score of the music will be destroyed in one way or another; finally the name Mozart will vanish, the dust will have won.If not on this planet then another.We can evade it awhile.As the andys can evade me and exist a finite stretch longer.But I get them or some other bounty hunter gets them.In a way, he realized, Im part of the form destroying process of entropy.The Rosen Association creates and I unmake.Or anyhow so it must seem to them.On the stage Papageno and Pamina engaged in a dialogue.He stopped his introspection to listen.Papageno: My child, what should we now say.Pamina: the truth.Thats what we will say.Leaning forward and peering, Rick studied Pamina in her heavy, convoluted robes, with her wimple trailing its veil about her shoulders and face.He reexamined the poop sheet, then leaned back, satisfied.Ive now seen my third Nexus 6 android, he realized.This is Luba Luft.A little ironic, tile sentiment her role calls for.However vital, active, and nice looking, an escaped android could hardly tell the truth; about itself, anyhow.On tile stage Luba Luft sang, and he found himself surprised at the quality of her voice; it rated with that of the best, even that of notables in his collection of historic tapes.The Rosen Associaion built her well, he had to admit.And again he perceived himself sub specie aeternitatis, the formdestroyer called forth by what he heard and saw here.Perhaps the better she functions, the better a singer she is, the more I am needed.If the androids had remained substandard, like the ancient  q 40s made by Derain Associatesthere would be no problem and no need of my skill.I wonder when I should do it, he asked himself.As soon as possible, probably.At the end of the rehearsal when she goes to her dressing room.At the end of the act the rehearsal ended temporarily.It would resume, the conductor said in English, French, and German, in an hour and a half.The conductor then departed; the musicians left their instruments and also left.Getting to his feet Rick made his way backstage to the dressing rooms; he followed the tail end of the cast, taking his time and thinking, Its better this way, getting it immediately over with.Ill spend as short a time talking to her and testing her as possible.As soon as Im surebut technically he could not be sure until after the test.Maybe Dave guessed wrong on her, he conjectured.I hope so.But he doubted it.Already, instinctively, his professional sense had responded.And he had yet to err  throughout years with the department.Stopping a super he asked for Miss Lufts dressing room; the super, wearing makeup and the costume of an Egyptian spear carrier, pointed.Rick arrived at the indicated door, saw an inkwritten note tacked to it reading MISS LUFT PRIVATE, and knocked.Come in.He entered.The girl sat at her dressing table, a much handled clothbound score open on her knees, marking here and there with a ball point pen.She still wore her costume and makeup, except for the wimple; that she had set.down on its rack.Yes?she said, looking up.The stage makeup enlarged her eyes,, enormous and hazel they fixed on him and did not waver.I am busy, as you can see.Her English contained no remnant of an accent.Rick said, You compare favorably to Schwarzkopf.Who are you?Her tone held cold reserveand that other cold, which he had encountered in so many androids.Always the same: great intellect, ability to accomplish much, but also this.He deplored it.And yet, without it, he could not track them down.Im from the San Francisco Police Department, he said.Oh?The huge and intense eyes did not flicker, did not respond.What are you here about?Her tone, oddly, seemed gracious.Seating himself in a nearby chair he unzipped his briefcase.I have been sent here to administer a standard personality profile test to you.It wont take more than a few minutes.Is it necessary?She gestured toward the big clothbound score.I have a good deal I must do.Now she had begun to look apprehensive.Itsnecessary.He got out the Voigt Kampff instruments, began setting them up.AnIQ test?No.Empathy.Ill have to put on my glasses.She reached to open a drawer of her dressing table.If you can mark the score without your glasses you can take this test.Ill show you some pictures and ask you several questions.Meanwhile He got up and walked to her, and, bending, pressed the adhesive pad of sensitive grids against her deeply tinted check.And this light, he said, adjusting the angle of the pencil beam, and thats it.Do you think Im an android?Is that it?Her voice had faded almost to extinction.Im not an android.I havent even been on Mars; Ive never even seen an android!Her elongated lashes shuddered involuntarily; he saw her trying to appear calm.Do you have information that theres an android in the cast?Id be glad to help you, and if I were an android would I be glad to help you?An android, he said, doesnt care what happens to any other android.Thats one of the indications we look for.Then, Miss Luft said, you must be an android.That stopped him; he stared at her.Because, she continued, Your job is to kill them, isnt it?Youre what they call She tried to remember.A bounty hunter, Rick said.But Im not an android.This test you want to give me.Her voice, now, had begun to return.Have you taken it?Yes.He nodded.A long, long time ago; when I first started with the department.Maybe thats a false memory.Dont androids sometimes go around with false memories?Rick said, My superiors know about the test.Its mandatory.Maybe there was once a human who looked like you, and somewhere along the line you killed him and took his place.And your superiors dont know.She smiled.As if inviting him to agree.Lets get on with the test, he said, getting out the sheets of questions.Ill take the test, Luba Luft said, if youll take it first.Again he stared at her, stopped in his tracks.Wouldnt that be more fair?she asked.Then I could be sure of you.I dont know; you seem so peculiar and hard and strange.She shivered, then smiled again.Hopefully.You wouldnt be able to administer the Voigt Kampff test.It takes considerable experience.Now please listen carefully.These questions will deal with social situations which you might find yourself in; what I want from you is a statement of response, what youd do.And I want the response as quickly as you can give it.One of the factors Ill record is the time lag, if any.He selected his initial question.Youre sitting watching TV and suddenly you discover a wasp crawling on your wrist.He checked with his watch, counting the seconds.And checked, too, with the twin dials.Whats a wasp?Luba Luft asked.A stinging bug that flies.Oh, how strange.Her immense eyes widened with child like acceptance, as if he had revealed the cardinal mystery of creation.Do they still exist?Ive never seen one.They died out because of the dust.Dont you really know what a wasp is?You must have been alive when there were wasps; thats only been  Tell me the German word.He tried to think of the German word for wasp but couldnt.Your English is perfect, he said angrily.My accent, she corrected, is perfect.It has to be, for roles, for Purcell and Walton and Vaughn Williams.But my vocabulary isnt very large.She glanced at him shyly.Wespe, he said, remembering the German word.Ach yes; eine Wespe.She laughed.And what was the question?I forget already.Lets try another.Impossible now to get a meaningful response.You are watching an old movie on TV, a movie from before the war.It shows a banquet in progress; the entrehe skipped over the first part of the questionconsists of boiled dog, stuffed with rice.Nobody would kill and cat a dog, Luba Luft said.Theyre worth a fortune.But I guess it would be an imitation dog: ersatz.Right?But those are made of wires and motors; they cant be eaten.Before the war, he grated.I wasnt alive before the war.But youve seen old movies on TV.Was the movie made in the Philippines?Why?Because, Luba Luft said, they used to cat boiled dog stuffed with rice in the Philippines.I remember reading that.But your response, he said.I want your social, emotional, moral reaction.To the movie?She pondered.Id turn it off and watch Buster Friendly.Why would you turn it off?Well, she said hotly, who the hell wants to watch an old movie set in the Philippines?What ever happened in the Philippines except the Bataan Death March, and would you want to watch that?She glared at him indignantly.On his dials the needles swung in all directions.After a pause he said carefully, You rent a mountain cabin.Ja.She nodded.Go on; Im waiting.In an area still verdant.Pardon?She cupped her ear.I dont ever hear that term.Still trees and bushes growing.The cabin is rustic knotty pine with a huge fireplace.On the walls someone has hung old snaps, Currier and Ives prints, and above the fireplace a deers head has been mounted, a full stag with developed horns.The people with you admire the decor of the cabin and  I dont understand Currier or Ives or decor, Luba Luft said; she seemed to be struggling, however, to make out the terms.Wait.She held up her hand earnestly.With rice, like in the dog.Currier is what makes the rice currier rice.Its Curry in German.He could not fathom, for the life of him, if Luba Lufts semantic fog had purpose.After consultation with himself he decided to try another question; what else could he do?Youre dating a man, he said, and he asks you to visit his apartment.While youre there  O nein, Luba broke in.I wouldnt be there.Thats easy to answer.Thats not the question!Did you get the wrong question?But I understand that; why is a question I understand the wrong one?Arent I supposed to understand?Nervously fluttering she rubbed her cheek and detached the adhesive disk.It dropped to the floor, skidded, and rolled under her dressing table.Ach Gott, she muttered, bending to retrieve it.A ripping sound, that of cloth tearing.Her elaborate costume.Ill get it, he said, and lifted her aside; he knelt down, groped under the dressing table until his fingers located the disk.When he stood up he found himself looking into a laser tube.Your questions, Luba Luft said in a crisp, formal voice, began to do with sex.I thought they would finally.Youre not from the police department; youre a sexual deviant.You can look at my identification.He reached toward his coat pocket.His hand, he saw, had again begun to shake, as it had with Polokov.If you reach in there, Luba Luft said, Ill kill you.You will anyhow.He wondered how it would have worked out if he had waited until Rachael Rosen could join him.Well, no use dwelling on that.Let me see some more of your questions.She held out her hand and, reluctantly, he passed her the sheets.In a magazine you come across a full page color picture of a nude girl.Well, thats one.You became pregnant by a man who has promised to marry you.The man goes off with another woman, your best friend; you get an abortion.The pattern of your questioning is obvious.Im going to call the police.Still holding the laser tube in his direction she crossed the room, picked tip the vidphone, dialed the operator.Connect me with the San Francisco Police Department, she said.I need a policeman.What youre doing, Rick said, with relief, is the best idea possible.Yet it seemed strange to him that Luba had decided to do this; why didnt she simply kill him?Once the patrolman arrived her chance would disappear and it all would go his way.She must think shes human, he decided.Obviously she doesnt know.A few minutes later, during which Luba carefully kept the laser tube on him, a large harness bull arrived, in his archaic blue uniform with gun and star.All right, he said at once to Luba.Put that thing away.She set down the laser tube and he picked it up to examine it, to see if it carried a charge.Now whats been going on here?
