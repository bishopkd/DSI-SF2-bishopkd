In this fashion, the entire length of the chain, some twenty or thirty feet in all, was slowly and noisily drawn out of the basket, into the noisy mechanism hidden beneath the throne, down the second soldier's throat, out the hatch in his chest, and down to the floor, where it gradually accumulated into a greasy heap.The process went on for much longer than Princess Nell first anticipated, because the chain frequently changed direction; more than once, when the basket was nearly empty, the chain began to spew back into it until it was nearly full again.But on the whole it was more apt to go forward than backward, and eventually the last link lifted free from the basket and disappeared into the throne.A few seconds later, the din from the throne stopped; now Nell could only hear a somewhat lesser chattering from the second soldier.Finally that stopped as well, and the chain fell from his chest.The soldier scooped it up in his arms and deposited it in an empty basket that was sitting handily nearby.Then he strode toward Nell, bent forward at the waist, put his hard cold shoulder rather uncomfortably into the pit of her stomach, and picked her up off the floor like a sack of corn.He carried her for some minutes through the castle, most of that time spent descending endless stone staircases, and finally brought her to a very deep, dark, and cold dungeon, where he deposited her in a small and perfectly dark cell.Nell said, "Princess Nell used one of the magic spells Purple had taught her to make light. "Princess Nell could see that the room was about two by three paces, with a stone bench on one wall to serve as a bed, and a hole in the floor for a toilet.A tiny barred window in the back wall led to an air shaft.Evidently this was quite deep and narrow, and Nell was close to the very bottom, because no light came through it.The soldier walked out of the cell and pulled the door shut behind him; as he did, she saw that the lock was extraordinarily large, about the size of an iron breadbox mounted to the door, full of clockwork and with a large crank dangling from its center.The door was equipped with a small peephole.Peering out through it, Nell could see that the soldier did not have a key as such.Instead, he took a short length of chain, about as long as his arm, from a peg near the door and fed it into the giant lock.Then he began to turn the crank.The clockwork clicked, the chain clanked, and eventually the bolt shot out and engaged the jamb, locking Princess Nell into the dungeon.Immediately the chain crashed out of the lock and landed on the floor.The soldier picked it up and hung it back on the wall.Then he clanked away and did not come back until several hours later, when he brought her some bread and water, shoving it through a little hatch in the middle of the door, just above the mechanical lock.It did not take Princess Nell long to explore the limited confines of her cell.In one corner, buried under dust and debris, she found something hard and cold and pulled it out for a better look: It was a fragment of chain, quite rusty, but clearly recognizable as the same sort of chain that she saw all over Castle Turing.The chain was flat.Each link had a toggle: a movable bit of metal in the center, capable of rotating about and snapping into place in either of two positions, either parallel or perpendicular to the chain.During her first night in the cell, Nell discovered two other things.First, the latch on the little door through which her food was delivered was partly accessible from her side, and with a little effort she was able to jam it so that it no longer locked properly.After that, she was able to stick her head out of the hatch and examine her surroundings, including the mechanical lock.Or she could reach out with one arm and feel the lock, spin the crank, and so on.The second discovery came in the middle of the night, when she was awakened by a metallic clanking sound coming through the tiny window on the air shaft.Reaching out with one hand, she felt the end of a chain dangling there.She pulled on it, and after initial resistance, it came freely.In short order she was able to pull many yards of chain into her cell and pile it up on the floor.Nell had a pretty good idea what to do with the chain.Starting with the end, she examined the toggles and began to mark their positions down (the Primer always gave her scratch pages when she needed them).She made a horizontal mark for toggles parallel to the chain and a vertical mark for those that were perpendicular, and came up with this:   ||||||||   |||||   ||||||||||||   ||||||||||||   |||||||||||||||     |||||||||     |   |||||||||||||       ||||   |||||||||||||||||||||   ||||||||||| |||||           ||||||||||||||||||||   |||||||||||||||||||||   ||||||||||||||||||   |||||||||   ||||||||||||||   |||||||    If she counted the vertical marks and replaced them with numbers, this amounted to 8 5 12 12 15  9  1 13   4 21 11 5     20 21 18 9 14 7 and if the numbers stood for letters of the alphabet, horizontal marks divided the letters, and double horizontals were spaces, this was HELLO I AM   DUKE     TURING Perhaps the multiple horizontals were codes for commonly used words:    the     (not used; possibly alan?)of  If that was right, then the message was HELLO I AM THE DUKE OF TURING, which was interesting, since the giant fellow in the armor had previously identified himself as such, and she deemed it unlikely that he would be sending her a message by this route.This must have come from someone else calling himself the Duke of Turing perhaps a real, living human being.A few years ago Nell could have relied on it.But in recent years the Primer had become much subtler than it used to be, full of hidden traps, and she could no longer make comfortable and easy assumptions.It was just as likely that this chain had descended straight from the throne room itself, and that the mechanical Duke was, for some unfathomable reason, trying to dupe her.So while she was happy to respond to this message in kind, she intended to take a guarded approach until she had established whether the sender was human or mechanical.The next part of the message was GIVE   CHAIN    TUG      ANSWER.Assuming that four horizontal marks stood for alan and six stood for to, this was GIVE THE CHAIN A TUG TO ANSWER.Nell began to flip the toggles on the chain, erasing the message from this personage calling himself the Duke and replacing it with I AM PRINCESS NELL WHY DID YOU IMPRISON ME.Then she gave the chain a tug, and after a moment it began to withdraw from her cell.A few minutes later, back came the message: WELCOME PRINCESS NELL LET US DEVISE A MORE EFFICIENT MEANS OF COMMUNICATION followed by instructions on how to use a more compact system of toggles to represent numbers, and how to convert the numbers into letters and punctuation marks.Once this was settled, the Duke said I AM THE REAL DUKE.I CREATED THESE MACHINES, AND THEY IMPRISONED ME IN A HIGH TOWER FAR ABOVE YOU.THE MACHINE CALLING HIMSELF THE DUKE IS MERELY THE LARGEST AND MOST SOPHISTICATED OF MY CREATIONS.Nell responded, THIS CHAIN WEIGHS HUNDREDS OF POUNDS.YOU MUST BE STRONG FOR A HUMAN.The Duke responded YOU ARE A SHARP ONE PRINCESS NELL!THE FULL WEIGHT OF THE CHAIN IS ACTUALLY SEVERAL THOUSAND POUNDS, AND I MANAGE IT BY MEANS OF A WINCH LOCATED IN MY ROOM AND DERIVING ITS MOTIVE POWER FROM THE CENTRAL SHAFT.Night had long since fallen on the meadow.Nell closed the Primer, packed up her basket, and returned home.She stayed up late into the night with the Primer, just as she had when she was a small child, and as a result was late for church the next morning.They said a special prayer for Miss Matheson, who was at home and said to be feeling poorly.Nell called on her for a few minutes after the service, then went straight back home and dove into the Primer again.She was attacking two problems at once.First, she needed to figure out how the lock on the door worked.Second, she needed to find out whether the person sending her the message was human or mechanical.If she could be confident that he was a human, she could ask him for assistance in opening the lock, but until she had settled this issue, she had to keep her activities a secret.The lock only had a few parts that she could observe: the crank, the bolt, and a pair of brass drums set into the top with digits from 0 to 9 engraved in them, so that by spinning different ways, they could display all the integers from 00 to 99.These drums were in almost constant motion whenever the crank was turning.Nell had managed to detach several yards of chain from the one that she was using to converse with the Duke, and so she was able to feed different messages into the lock and see what result they had.The number on the top changed with every link that went into the machine, and it seemed to determine, in a limited way, what the machine would do next; for example, she had learned that the number happened to be 09, and if the next link in the chain was in the vertical position (which the Duke referred to as a one), the drums would spin around and change the number to 23.But if the next link was, instead, a zero (as the Duke referred to links with horizontal toggles), the number drums would change to 03.But that wasn't all: In this case, the machine would, for some reason, reverse the direction in which the chain was moving through the machine, and also flick the toggle from zero to one.That is, the machine could write on the chain as well as read from it.From idle chitchat with the Duke she learned that the numbers on the drums were referred to as states.At first she did not know which states led to other states, and so she wandered aimlessly from one state to the next, recording the connections on scratch paper.This soon grew to a table listing some thirty two different states and how the lock would respond to a one or a zero when it was in each of those states.It took a while for Nell to fill out all the blank spaces in the table, because some of the states were hard to get to they could be reached only by getting the machine to write a certain series of ones and zeros on the chain.She would have gone crazy with ones and zeros were it not for the frequent interruptions from the Duke, who evidently had nothing better to do than to send her messages.These two parallel courses of inquiry occupied all of Nell's free time for a couple of weeks, and she made slow but steady progress."You must learn how to operate the lock on your door," the Duke said."This will enable you to effect an escape and to come and rescue me.I will instruct you. "All he wanted to talk about was technology, which wouldn't help Nell in figuring out whether he was a human or a machine."Why don't you pick your own lock," she responded, "and come and rescue me?I am just a poor helpless young thing all alone in the world, and so scared and lonely, and you seem so brave and heroic; your story really is quite romantic, and I cannot wait to see how it all comes out now that our fates have become intertwined. ""The machines placed a special lock on my door, not a Turing machine," responded the Duke."Describe yourself," Nell wrote."Nothing special,  I'm afraid," wrote the Duke."How about yourself?""Slightly taller than average, flashing green eyes, raven hair falling in luxuriant waves to my waist unless I pin it up to emphasize my high cheekbones and full lips.Narrow waist, pert breasts, long legs, alabaster skin that flushes vividly when I am passionate about something, which is frequently. ""Your description is reminiscent of my late wife, God rest her soul. ""Tell me about your wife. ""The subject fills me with such unutterable sadness that I cannot bear to write about it.Now, let's buckle down to work on the Turing machine. "Since the prurient approach had dead ended, Nell tried a different tack: playing stupid.Sooner or later, the Duke would become a little testy.But he was always terribly patient with her, even after the twentieth repetition of "Could you explain it again with different words?I still don't get it. "Of course, for all she knew, he was upstairs punching the walls until his knuckles were bloody and simply pretending to be patient with her.A man who'd been locked up in a tower for years would learn to be extremely patient.She tried sending him poetry.He sent back glowing reviews but declined to send her any of his own, saying it wasn't good enough to be committed to metal.On her twentieth day in the dungeon, Princess Nell finally got the lock open.Rather than making an immediate escape, she locked herself back in and sat down to ponder her next move.If the Duke was human, she should notify him so that they could plan their escape.If he was a machine, doing so would lead to disaster.She had to figure out the Duke's identity before she made another move.She sent him another poem.For the Greek's love she gave away her heart  Her father, crown and homeland.They stopped to rest on Naxos  She woke up alone upon the strand  The sails of her lover's ship descending  Round the slow curve of the earth.Ariadne  Fell into a swoon on the churned sand  And dreamed of home.Minos did not forgive her  And holding diamonds in the pouches of his eyes  Had her flung into the Labyrinth.She was alone this time.Through a wilderness  Of blackness wandered Ariadne many days  Until she tripped on the memory.It was still wound all through the place.She spun it round her fingers  Lifted it from the floor  Knotted it into lace  Erased it.The lace made a gift for him who had imprisoned her.Blind with tears, he read it with his fingers  And opened his arms.The answer came back much too quickly, and it was the same answer as always: "I do so envy your skill with words.Now, if you do not object, let us turn our attention to the inner workings of the Turing machine. "She had made it as obvious as she dared, and the Duke still hadn't gotten the message.He must be a machine.Why the deception?Clearly, the mechanical Duke desired for her to learn about the Turing machines.That is, if a machine could ever be said to desire something.There must be something wrong with the Duke's programming.He knew there was something wrong with it, and he needed a human to fix it.Once Nell had figured these things out, the rest of the Castle Turing story resolved itself quickly and neatly.She slipped out of her cell and stealthily explored the castle.The soldiers rarely noticed her, and when they did, they could not improvise; they had to go back to the Duke to be reprogrammed.Eventually, Princess Nell found her way into a room beneath the windmill that contained a sort of clutch mechanism.By disengaging the clutch, she was able to stop the Shaft.Within a few hours, the springs inside the soldiers' back had all run down, and they had all stopped in their tracks.The whole castle was frozen, as if she had cast an enchantment over it.Now roaming freely, she opened up the Duke's throne and found a Turing machine beneath it.On either side of the machine was a narrow hole descending straight through the floor and into the earth for as far as her torch light could illuminate it.The chain containing the Duke's program dangled on either side into these holes.Nell tried throwing stones into the holes and never heard them hit bottom; the chain must be unfathomably long.High up in one of the castle's towers, Princess Nell found a skeleton in a chair, slumped over a table piled high with books.Mice, bugs, and birds had nibbled away all of the flesh, but traces of gray hair and whiskers were still scattered around the table, and around the cervical vertebrae was a golden chain bearing a seal with the T insignia.She spent some time going through the Duke's books.Most of them were notebooks where he would sketch the inventions he hadn't had time to build yet.He had plans for whole armies of Turing machines made to run in parallel, and for chains with links that could be set in more than two positions, and for machines that would read and write on two dimensional sheets of chain mail instead of one dimensional chains, and for a three dimensional Turing grid a mile on a side, through which a mobile Turing machine would climb about, computing as it went.No matter how complicated his designs became, the Duke always found a way to simulate their behavior by putting a sufficiently long chain into one of the traditional Turing machines.That is to say that while the parallel and multidimensional machines worked more quickly than the original model, they didn't really do anything different.One afternoon, Nell was sitting in her favorite meadow, reading about these things in the Primer, when a riderless chevaline emerged from the woods and galloped directly toward her.This was not highly unusual, in and of itself; chevalines were smart enough to be sent out in search of specific persons.People rarely sent them in search of Nell, though.The chevaline galloped at her full tilt until it was just a few feet away, and then planted its hooves and stopped instantly a trick it could easily do when it wasn't carrying a human.It was carrying a note written in Miss Stricken's hand: "Nell, please come immediately.Miss Matheson has requested your presence, and time is short. "Nell didn't hesitate.She gathered her things, stuffed them into the mount's small luggage compartment, and climbed on."Go!"she said.Then, getting herself well situated and clenching the hand grips, she added, "Unlimited speed. "Within moments the chevaline was threading gaps between trees at something close to a cheetah's sprint velocity, clawing its way up the hill toward the dog pod grid.From the way the tubes ran, Nell guessed that Miss Matheson was plugged into the Feed in two or three different ways, though everything had been discreetly hidden under many afghans, piled up on top of her body like the airy layers of a French pastry.Only her face and hands were visible, and looking at them Nell remembered for the first time since their introduction just how old Miss Matheson was.The force of her personality had blinded Nell and all the girls to the blunt evidence of her true age."Please let us be, Miss Stricken," Miss Matheson said, and Miss Stricken backed out warily, strewing reluctant and reproving glances along her trail.Nell sat on the edge of the bed and carefully lifted one of Miss Matheson's hands from the coverlet, as if it were the desiccated leaf of some rare tree."Nell," Miss Matheson said, "do not waste my few remaining moments with pleasantries. ""Oh, Miss Matheson " Nell began, but the old lady's eyes widened and she gave Nell a certain look, practiced through many decades in the classroom, that still had not lost its power to silence."I have requested that you come here because you are my favorite student.No!Do not say a word," Miss Matheson admonished her, as Nell leaned her face closer, eyes filling with tears."Teachers are not supposed to have favorites, but I am approaching that time when I must confess all my sins, so there it is."I know that you have a secret, Nell, though I cannot imagine what it is, and I know that your secret has made you different from any other girl I have ever taught.I wonder what you suppose you will do with your life when you leave this Academy, as you must soon, and go out into the world?""Take the Oath, of course, as soon as I reach the age of eligibility.And I suppose that I should like to study the art of programming, and how ractives are made.Someday, of course, after I have become one of Her Majesty's subjects, I should like to find a nice husband and perhaps raise children "  "Oh, stop it," Miss Matheson said."You are a young woman of course you think about whether you shall have children every young woman does.I haven't much time left, Nell, and we must dispense with what makes you like all the other girls and concentrate on what makes you different. "At this point, the old lady gripped Nell's hand with surprising force and raised her head just a bit off the pillow.The tremendous wrinkles and furrows on her brow deepened, and her hooded eyes took on an intense burning appearance."Your destiny is marked in some way, Nell.I have known it since the day Lord Finkle McGraw came to me and asked me to admit you a ragged little thete girl into my Academy."You can try to act the same we have tried to make you the same you can pretend it in the future if you insist, and you can even take the Oath but it's all a lie.You are different. "These words struck Nell like a sudden cold wind of pure mountain air and stripped away the soporific cloud of sentimentality.Now she stood exposed and utterly vulnerable.But not unpleasantly so."Are you suggesting that I leave the bosom of the adopted tribe that has nurtured me?""I am suggesting that you are one of those rare people who transcends tribes, and you certainly don't need a bosom any more," Miss Matheson said."You will find, in time, that this tribe is as good as any other better than most, really. "Miss Matheson exhaled deeply and seemed to dissolve into her blankets."Now, I haven't long.So give us a kiss, and then be on your way, girl. "Nell leaned forward and pressed her lips against Miss Matheson's cheek, which looked leathery but was surprisingly soft.Then, unwilling to leave so abruptly, she turned her head and rested it on Miss Matheson's chest for a few moments.Miss Matheson stroked feebly at her hair and tut tutted."Farewell, Miss Matheson," Nell said."I will never forget you. ""Nor I you," Miss Matheson whispered, "though admittedly that is not saying much. "...A very large chevaline stood stolidly in front of Constable Moore's house, somewhere between a Percheron and a small elephant in size and bulk.It was the dirtiest object Nell had ever seen in her life its encrustations alone must have weighed hundreds of pounds and were redolent with the scent of night soil and stagnant water.A fragment of a mulberry branch, still bearing leaves and even a couple of actual berries, had gotten wedged into a flexing joint between two adjoining armor plates, and long ropes of milfoil trailed from its ankles.The Constable was sitting in the middle of his bamboo grove, enveloped in a suit of hoplite armor, similarly filthy and scarred, that was twice as big as he was, and that made his bare head look absurdly small.He had ripped the helmet off and dropped it into his fish pond, where it floated around like the eviscerated hull of a scuttled dreadnought.He looked very gaunt and was staring vacantly, without blinking, at some kudzu that was slowly but inexorably conquering the wisteria.As soon as Nell saw the look on his face, she made him some tea and brought it to him.The Constable reached for the tiny alabaster teacup with armored hands that could have crumbled stones like loaves of stale bread.The thick barrels of the guns built into the arms of his suit were scorched on the inside.He plucked the cup from Nell's hands with the precision of a surgical robot, but did not lift it to his lips, perhaps afraid that he might, in his exhaustion, get the distance a bit wrong and inadvertently crush the porcelain into his jaw, or even decapitate himself.Merely holding the cup, watching the steam rise from its surface, seemed to calm him.His nostrils dilated once, then again."Darjeeling," he said."Well chosen.Always thought of India as a more civilised place than China.Have to throw out all of the oolong now, all the keemun, the lung jang, the lapsang souchong.Time to switch over to Ceylon, pekoe, assam. "He chuckled.White trails of dried salt ran back from the corners of the Constable's eyes and disappeared into his hairline.He had been riding fast with his helmet off.Nell wished that she had been able to see the Constable thundering across China on his war chevaline."I've retired for the last time," he explained.He nodded in the direction of China."Been doing a bit of consulting work for a gentleman there.Complicated fellow.Dead now.Had many facets, but now he'll go down in history as just another damn Chinese warlord who didn't make the grade.It is remarkable, love," he said, looking at Nell for the first time, "how much money you can make shovelling back the tide.In the end you need to get out while the getting is good.Not very honourable, I suppose, but then, there is no honour among consultants. "Nell did not imagine that Constable Moore wanted to get into a detailed discussion of recent events, so she changed the subject."I think I have finally worked out what you were trying to tell me, years ago, about being intelligent," she said.The Constable brightened all at once."Pleased to hear it. ""The Vickys have an elaborate code of morals and conduct.It grew out of the moral squalor of an earlier generation, just as the original Victorians were preceded by the Georgians and the Regency.The old guard believe in that code because they came to it the hard way.They raise their children to believe in that code but their children believe it for entirely different reasons. ""They believe it," the Constable said, "because they have been indoctrinated to believe it. ""Yes.Some of them never challenge it they grow up to be smallminded people, who can tell you what they believe but not why they believe it.Others become disillusioned by the hypocrisy of the society and rebel as did Elizabeth Finkle McGraw. ""Which path do you intend to take, Nell?"said the Constable, sounding very interested."Conformity or rebellion?""Neither one.Both ways are simple minded they are only for people who cannot cope with contradiction and ambiguity. ""Ah!Excellent!"the Constable exclaimed.As punctuation, he slapped the ground with his free hand, sending up a shower of sparks and transmitting a powerful shock through the ground to Nell's feet."I suspect that Lord Finkle McGraw, being an intelligent man, sees through all of the hypocrisy in his society, but upholds its principles anyway, because that is what is best in the long run.And I suspect that he has been worrying about how best to inculcate this stance in young people who cannot understand, as he does, its historical antecedents which might explain why he has taken an interest in me.The Primer may have been Finkle McGraw's idea to begin with a first attempt to go about this systematically. ""The Duke plays his cards close," Constable Moore said, "and so I cannot say whether your suppositions are correct.But I will admit it hangs together nicely. ""Thank you. ""What do you intend to do with yourself, now that you have pieced all of this together?A few more years' education and polishing will place you in a position to take the Oath. ""I am, of course, aware that I have favorable prospects in the Atlantan phyle," Nell said, "but I do not think that it would be fitting for me to take the straight and narrow path.I am going to China now to seek my fortune. ""Well," Constable Moore said, "look out for the Fists. "His gaze wandered over his battered and filthy armor and came to rest on the floating helmet."They are coming now. "The best explorers, like Burton, made every effort to blend in.In this spirit, Nell stopped at a public M. C. , doffed her long dress, and compiled a new set of clothes a navy blue skin tight coverall emblazoned with SHIT HAPPENS in pulsating orange letters.She swapped her old clothes for a pair of powered skates on the waterfront, and then headed straight for the Causeway.It rose gently into the air for a few miles, and then the Pudong Economic Zone came into view at her feet, and Shanghai beyond that, and she suddenly began to pick up speed and had to cut the skates' power assist.She'd passed over the watershed now.Nell was alone in China.The Hackworths have a family reunion;  Hackworth strikes out on his quest;  an unexpected companion.Atlantis/Seattle was designed small and to the point; the narrow, convoluted straits of Puget Sound, already so full of natural islands, did not leave much room for artificial ones.So they had made it rather long and slender, parallel to the currents and the shipping lanes, and been rather stingy when it came to the parks, meadows, heaths, gentleman farms, and country estates.Much of the Seattle area was still sufficiently rich, civilized, and polite that New Atlantans did not object to living there, and little Victorian mini claves were scattered about the place, particularly east of the lake, around the misty forest domains of the software khans.Gwen and Fiona had taken a townhouse in one of these areas.These tiny bits of New Atlantis stood out from the surrounding forest in the same way that a vicar in morning coat and wing collar would have in the cave of the Drummers.The prevailing architecture here, among those who had not adopted neo Victorian precepts, was distinctly subterranean; as if these people were somehow ashamed of their own humanity and could not bear to fell even a handful of the immense Douglas firs that marched monotonously up the tumbling slopes toward the frozen, sodden ridge of the Cascades.Even when it was half buried, a house wasn't even a proper house; it was an association of modules, scattered about here and there and connected by breezeways or tunnels.Stuck together properly and built on a rise, these modules might have added up to a house of substance, even grandeur; but to Hackworth, riding through the territory on his way to visit his family, it was all depressing and confusing.Ten years among the Drummers had not affected his Victorian aesthetics.He could not tell where one house left off and the next one began, the houses were all intertangled with one another like neurons in the brain.His mind's eye again seemed to seize control of his visual cortex; he could not see the firs anymore, just axons and dendrites hanging in black three dimensional space, packets of rod logic maneuvering among them like space probes, meeting and copulating among the nerve fibers.It was a bit too aggressive to be a reverie and too abstract to be a hallucination.It didn't really clear away until a gust of cold mist hit him in his face, he opened his eyes, and realized that Kidnapper had stopped after emerging from the trees at the crest of a mossy ridgeline.Below him was a rocky bowl with a few cobblestone streets sketched out in a grid, a green park lined with red geraniums, a church with a white steeple, whitewashed four story Georgian buildings surrounded by black wrought iron fences.The security grid was tenuous and feeble; the software khans were at least as good at that kind of thing as Her Majesty's specialists, and so a New Atlantis clave in this area could rely on the neighbors to shoulder much of that burden.Kidnapper picked its way carefully down the steep declivity as Hackworth looked out over the tiny clave, musing at how familiar it seemed.Since leaving the Drummers, he hadn't gone more than ten minutes without being seized by a feeling of dj vu, and now it was especially strong.Perhaps this was because, to some degree, all New Atlantis settlements looked alike.But he suspected that he had seen this place, somehow, in his communications with Fiona over the years.A bell clanged once or twice, and teenaged girls, dressed in plaid uniform skirts, began to emerge from a domed school.Hackworth knew that it was Fiona's school, and that she was not entirely happy there.After the crush of girls had gone out of the place, he rode Kidnapper into the school yard and sauntered once around the building, gazing in the windows.Without much trouble he saw his daughter, sitting at a table in the library, hunched over a book, evidently as part of some disciplinary action.He wanted so badly to go in and put his arms around her, because he knew that she had spent many hours suffering like punishments, and that she was a lonely girl.But he was in New Atlantis, and there were proprieties to be observed.First things first.Gwendolyn's townhouse was only a few blocks away.Hackworth rang the bell, determined to observe all of the formalities now that he was a stranger in the house."May I ask what your visit is regarding?"asked the parlourmaid, as Hackworth spun his card onto the salver.Hackworth didn't like this woman, who was named Amelia, because Fiona didn't like her, and Fiona didn't like her because Gwen had given her some disciplinary authority in the household, and Amelia was the sort who relished having it.He tried not to confuse himself by wondering how he could possibly know all of these things."Business," Hackworth said pleasantly."Family business. "Amelia was halfiway up the stairs when her eyes finally focused on Hackworth's card.She nearly dropped the salver and had to clutch at the banister with one hand in order to keep her balance.She froze there for a few moments, trying to resist the temptation to turn around, and finally surrendered to it.The expression on her face was one of perfect loathing mixed with fascination."Please carry out your duties," Hackworth said, "and dispense with the vulgar theatrics. "Amelia, looking crestfallen, stormed up the stairs with the tainted card.There followed a good deal of muffled commotion upstairs.After a few minutes, Amelia ventured as far down as the landing and encouraged Hackworth to make himself comfortable in the parlor.He did so, noting that in his absence, Gwendolyn had been able to consummate all of the long term furniture buying strategies she had spent so much time plotting during the early years of their marriage.Wives and widows of secret agents in Protocol Enforcement could rely on being well cared for, and Gwen had not allowed his salary to sit around collecting dust.His ex wife descended the stairway cautiously, stood outside the beveled glass parlor doors for a minute peering at him through the gauze curtains, and finally slipped into the room without meeting his gaze and took a seat rather far away from him."Hello, Mr.Hackworth," she said."Mrs.Hackworth.Or is it back to Miss Lloyd?""It is. ""Ah, that's hard. "When Hackworth heard the name Miss Lloyd, he thought of their courtship.They sat there for a minute or so, not saying anything, just listening to the ponderous ratcheting of the grandfather clock."All right," Hackworth said, "I won't trouble you talking about extenuating circumstances, as I don't ask for your forgiveness, and in all honesty I'm not sure that I deserve it. ""Thank you for that consideration. ""I would like you to know, Miss Lloyd, that I am sympathetic to the step you have taken in securing a divorce and harbour no bitterness on that account. ""That is reassuring to know. ""You should also know that whatever behaviour I engaged in, as inexcusable as it was, was not motivated by rejection of you or of our marriage.It was not, in fact, a reflection upon you at all, but rather a reflection upon myself. ""Thank you for clarifying that point. ""I realize that any hope I might harbour in my breast of rekindling our former relationship, sincere as it might be, is futile, and so I will not trouble you after today. ""I cannot tell you how relieved I am to hear that you understand the situation so completely. ""However, I would like to be of service to you and Fiona in helping to resolve any loose ends. ""You are very kind.I shall give you my lawyer's card. ""And, of course, I look forward to reestablishing some sort of contact with my daughter. "The conversation, which had been running as smoothly as a machine to this point, now veered off track and crashed.Gwendolyn reddened and stiffened."You you bastard. "The front door opened.Fiona stepped into the foyer carrying her schoolbooks.Amelia was there immediately, maneuvering around with her back to the foyer doors, blocking Fiona's view, talking to her in low angry tones.Hackworth heard his daughter's voice.It was a lovely voice, a husky alto, and he would have recognized it anywhere."Don't lie to me, I recognised his chevaline!"she said, and finally shouldered Amelia out of the way, burst into the parlor, all lanky and awkward and beautiful, an incarnation of joy.She took two steps across the oriental rug and then launched herself full length across the settee into her father's arms, where she lay for some minutes alternately weeping and laughing.Gwen had to be escorted from the room by Amelia, who came back immediately and stationed herself nearby, hands clasped behind back like a military sentry, observing Hackworth's every move.Hackworth couldn't imagine what they suspected he might be capable of incest in the parlor?But there was no point in spoiling the moment by thinking of galling things, and so he shut Amelia out of his mind.Father and daughter were allowed to converse for a quarter of an hour, really just queuing up subjects for future conversation.By that time, Gwen had recovered her composure enough to reenter the room, and she and Amelia stood shoulder to shoulder, quivering in sympathetic resonance, until Gwen interrupted."Fiona, your fatherand I were in the midst of a very serious discussion when you burst in on us.Please leave us alone for a few minutes. "Fiona did, reluctantly.Gwen resumed her former position, and Amelia backed out of the room.Hackworth noticed that Gwen had fetched some documents, bound up in red tape."These are papers setting out the terms of our divorce, including all conditions relating to Fiona," she said."You are already in violation, I'm afraid.Of course, this can be forgiven, as your lack of a forwarding address as such made it impossible for us to acquaint you with this information.Needless to say, it is imperative for you to familiarise yourself with these documents before darkening my door again. ""Naturally," Hackworth said."Thank you for retaining them for me. ""If you will be so good as to withdraw from these premises "  "Of course.Good day," Hackworth said, took the roll of papers from Gwen's trembling hand, and let himself out briskly.He was a bit surprised when he heard Amelia calling to him from the doorway."Mr.Hackworth.Miss Lloyd wishes to know whether you have established a new residence, so that your personal effects may be forwarded. ""None as yet," Hackworth said."I'm in transit. "Amelia brightened."In transit to where?""Oh, I don't really know," Hackworth said.A movement caught his eye and he saw Fiona framed in a second story window.She was undoing the latches, raising the sash."I'm on a quest of sorts. ""A quest for what, Mr.Hackworth?""Can't say precisely.You know, top secret and all that.Something to do with an alchemist.Who knows, maybe there'll be faeries and hobgoblins too, before it's all over.I'll be happy to fill you in when I return.Until then, please ask Miss Lloyd if she would be so understanding as to retain those personal effects for just a bit longer.It can't possibly take more than another ten years or so. "And with that, Hackworth prodded Kidnapper forward, moving at an extremely deliberate pace.Fiona was on a velocipede with smart wheels that made short work of the cobblestone road.She caught up with her father just short of the security grid.Mother and Amelia had just materialized a block behind them in a half lane car, and the sudden sensation of danger inspired Fiona to make an impetuous dive from the saddle of her velocipede onto Kidnapper's hindquarters, like a cowboy in a movie switching horses in midgallop.Her skirts, poorly adapted to cowboy maneuvers, got all fouled up around her legs, and she ended up slung over Kidnapper's back like a sack of beans, one hand clutching the vestigial knob where its tail would have been if it were a horse, and the other arm thrown round her father's waist."I love you, Mother!"she shouted, as they rode through the grid and out of the jurisdiction of New Atlantis family law."Can't say the same for you, Amelia!But I'll be back soon, don't worry about me!Goodbye!"And then the ferns and mist closed behind them, and they were alone in the deep forest.Carl Hollywood takes the Oath;  stroll along the Thames;  an encounter with Lord Finkle McGraw.Carl took the Oath at Westminster Abbey on a surprisingly balmy day in April and afterward went for a stride down the river, heading not too directly toward a reception that had been arranged in his honor at the Hopkins Theatre near Leicester Square.Even without a pedomotive, he walked as fast as many people jogged.Ever since his first visit to London as a malnourished theatre student, he had preferred walking to any other way of getting around the place.Walking, especially along the Embankment where fellow pedestrians were relatively few, also gave him freedom to smoke big old authentic cigars or the occasional briar pipe.Just because he was a Victorian didn't mean he had to give up his peculiarities; quite the opposite, in fact.Cruising along past old shrapnel pocked Cleopatra's Needle in a comet like corona of his own roiling, viscous smoke, he thought that he might get to like this.A gentleman in a top hat was standing on the railing, gazing stolidly across the water, and as Carl drew closer, he could see that it was Lord Alexander Chung Sik Finkle McGraw, who, a day or two earlier, had stated during a cinephone conversation that he should like to meet him face to face in the near future for a chat.Carl Hollywood, remembering his new tribal affiliation, went so far as to doff his hat and bow.Finkle McGraw acknowledged the greeting somewhat distractedly."Please accept my sincere congratulations, Mr.Hollywood.Welcome to the phyle. ""Thank you. ""I regret that I have not been able to attend any of your productions at the Hopkins my friends who have could hardly have been more complimentary. ""Your friends are too kind," said Carl Hollywood.He was still a little unsure of the etiquette.To accept the compliment at face value would have been boastful; to imply that His Grace's friends were incompetent judges of theatre was not much of an improvement; he settled for the less dangerous accusation that these friends had a superfluity of goodness.Finkle McGraw detached himself from the railing and began to walk along the river, keeping a brisk pace for a man of his age."I daresay that you shall make a prized addition to our phyle, which, as brilliantly as it shines in the fields of commerce and science, wants more artists. "Not wanting to join in criticism of the tribe he'd just sworn a solemn Oath to uphold, Carl pursed his lips and mulled over some possible responses.Finkle McGraw continued, "Do you suppose that we fail to encourage our own children to pursue the arts, or fail to attract enough men such as yourself, or perhaps both?""With all due respect, Your Grace, I do not necessarily agree with your premise.New Atlantis has many fine artists. ""Oh, come now.Why do all of them come from outside the tribe, as you did?Really, Mr.Hollywood, would you have taken the Oath at all if your prominence as a theatrical producer had not made it advantageous for you to do so?""I think I will choose to interpret your question as part of a Socratic dialogue for my edification," Carl Hollywood said carefully, "and not as an allegation of insincerity on my part.As a matter of fact, just before I encountered you, I was enjoying my cigar, and looking about at London, and thinking about just how well it all suits me. ""It suits you well because you are of a certain age now.You are a successful and established artist.The ragged bohemian life holds no charm for you anymore.But would you have reached your current position if you had not lived that life when you were younger?""Now that you put it that way," Carl said, "I agree that we might try to make some provision, in the future, for young bohemians "  "It wouldn't work," Finkle McGraw said."I've been thinking about this for years.I had the same idea: Set up a sort of young artistic bohemian theme park, sprinkled around in all the major cities, where young New Atlantans who were so inclined could congregate and be subversive when they were in the mood.The whole idea was self contradictory.Mr.Hollywood, I have devoted much effort, during the last decade or so, to the systematic encouragement of subversiveness. ""You have?Are you not concerned that our young subversives will migrate to other phyles?"If Carl Hollywood could have kicked himself in the arse, he would have done so as soon as finishing that sentence.He had forgotten about Elizabeth Finkle McGraw's recent and highly publicized defection to CryptNet.But the Duke took it serenely."Some of them will, as the case of my granddaughter demonstrates.But what does it really mean when such a young person moves to another phyle?It means that they have outgrown youthful credulity and no longer wish to belong to a tribe simply because it is the path of least resistance they have developed principles, they are concerned with their personal integrity.It means, in short, that they are ripe to become members in good standing of New Atlantis as soon as they develop the wisdom to see that it is, in the end, the best of all possible tribes. ""Your strategy was much too subtle for me to follow.I thank you for explaining it.You encourage subversiveness because you think that it will have an effect opposite to what one might naively suppose. ""Yes.And that's the whole point of being an Equity Lord, you know to look after the interests of the society as a whole instead of flogging one's own company, or whatever.At any rate, this brings us to the subject of the advertisement I placed in the ractives section of the Times and our consequent cinephone conversation. ""Yes," Carl Hollywood said, "you are looking for ractors who performed in a project called the Young Lady's Illustrated Primer. ""The Primer was my idea.I commissioned it.I paid the racting fees.Of course, owing to the way the media system is organised, I had no way to determine the identity of the ractors to whom I was sending the fees hence the need for a public advertisement. ""Your Grace, I should tell you immediately and would have told you on the cinephone, had you not insisted that we defer all substantive discussion to a face to face that I myself did not ract in the Primer.A friend of mine did.When I saw the advertisement, I undertook to respond on her behalf. ""I understand that ractors are frequently pursued by overly appreciative members of their audience," said Finkle McGraw, "and so I suppose I understand why you have chosen to act as intermediary in this case.Let me assure you that my motives are perfectly benign. "Carl adopted a wounded look "Your Grace!I would never have supposed otherwise.I am arrogating this role to myself, not to protect the young lady in question from any supposed malignity on your part, but simply because her current circumstances make establishing contact with her a somewhat troublesome business. ""Then pray tell me what you know about the young woman. "Carl gave the Equity Lord a brief description of Miranda's relationship with the Primer.Finkle McGraw was keenly interested in how much time Miranda had spent in the Primer each week."If your estimates are even approximately accurate, this young woman must have singlehandedly done at least nine tenths of the racting associated with that copy of the Primer. ""That copy?Do you mean to say there were others?"Finkle McGraw walked on silently for a few moments, then resumed in a quieter voice."There were three copies in all.The first one went to my granddaughter as you will appreciate, I tell you this in confidence.A second went to Fiona, the daughter of the artifex who created it.The third fell into the hands of Nell, a little thete girl."To make a long story short, the three girls have turned out very differently.Elizabeth is rebellious and high spirited and lost interest in the Primer several years ago.Fiona is bright but depressed, a classic manic depressive artist.Nell, on the other hand, is a most promising young lady."I prepared an analysis of the girls' usage habits, which were largely obscured by the inherent secrecy of the media system, but which can be inferred from the bills we paid to hire the ractors.It became clear that, in the case of Elizabeth, the racting was done by hundreds of different performers.In Fiona's case, the bills were strikingly lower because much of the racting was done by someone who did not charge money for his or her services probably her father.But that's a different story.In Nell's case, virtually all of the racting was done by the same person. ""It sounds," Carl said, "as if my friend established a relationship with Nell's copy "  "And by extension, with Nell," said Lord Finkle McGraw.Carl said, "May I inquire as to why you wish to contact the ractor?""Because she is a central part of what is going on here," said Lord Finkle McGraw, "which I did not expect.It was not a part of the original plan that the ractor would be important. ""She did it," Carl Hollywood said, "by sacrificing her career and much of her life.It is important for you to understand, Your Grace, that she was not merely Nell's tutor.She became Nell's mother. "These words seemed to strike Lord Finkle McGraw quite forcefully.His stride faltered, and he ambled along the riverbank for some time, lost in thought."You gave me to believe, several minutes ago, that establishing contact with the ractor in question would not be a trivial process," he said finally, in quieter voice."Is she no longer associated with your troupe?""She took a leave of absence several years ago in order to concentrate on Nell and the Primer. ""I see," said the Equity Lord, leaning into the words a little bit and turning it into an exclamation.He was getting excited."Mr.Hollywood, I hope you will not be offended by my indelicacy in inquiring as to whether this has been a paid leave of absence. ""Had it been necessary, I would have underwritten it.Instead there is another backer. ""Another backer," repeated Finkle McGraw.He was obviously fascinated, and slightly alarmed, by the use of financial jargon in this context."The transaction was fairly simple, as I suppose all transactions are au fond," said Carl Hollywood."Miranda wanted to locate Nell.Conventional thinking dictates that this is impossible.There are, however, some unconventional thinkers who would maintain that it can be done through unconscious, nonrational processes.There is a tribe called the Drummers who normally live underwater "  "I am familiar with them," said Lord Finkle McGraw."Miranda joined the Drummers four years ago," Carl said."She had entered into a partnership.The two other partners were a gentleman of my acquaintance, also in the theatrical business, and a financial backer. ""What did the backer hope to gain from it?""A leased line to the collective unconscious," said Carl Hollywood."He thought it would be to the entertainment industry what the philosopher's stone was to alchemy. ""And the results?""We have all been waiting to hear from Miranda. ""You have heard nothing at all?""Only in my dreams," Carl Hollywood said.Nell's passage through Pudong;  she happens upon the offices of Madame Ping;  interview with the same.Shanghai proper could be glimpsed only through vertical apertures between the high buildings of the Pudong Economic Zone as Nell skated westward.Downtown Pudong erupted from the flat paddy land on the east bank of the Huang Pu.Almost all of the skyscrapers made use of mediatronic building materials.Some bore the streamlined characters of the Japanese writing system, rendered in sophisticated color schemes, but most of them were written in the denser high resolution characters used by the Chinese, and these tended to be stroked out in fiery red, or in black on a background of that color.The Anglo Americans had their Manhattan, the Japanese had Tokyo.Hong Kong was a nice piece of work, but it was essentially Western.When the Overseas Chinese came back to the homeland to build their monument to enterprise, they had done it here, and they had done it bigger and brighter, and unquestionably redder, than any of those other cities.The nanotechnological trick of making sturdy structures that were lighter than air had come along just at the right time, as all of the last paddies were being replaced by immense concrete foundations, and a canopy of new construction had bloomed above the first generation undergrowth of seventy and eighty story buildings.This new architecture was naturally large and ellipsoidal, typically consisting of a huge neonrimmed ball impaled on a spike, so Pudong was bigger and denser a thousand feet above the ground than it was at street level.Seen from the apex of the big arch in the Causeway through several miles of bad air, the view was curiously flattened and faded, as if the whole scene had been woven into a fabulously complex brocade that had been allowed to gather dust for several decades and then been hung in front of Nell, about ten feet away.The sun had gone down not long before and the sky was still a dim orange fading up into purple, divided into irregular segments by half a dozen pillars of smoke spurting straight up out of the horizon and toward the dark polluted vault of the heavens, many miles off to the west, somewhere out in the silk and tea districts between Shanghai and Suzhou.As she power skated down the western slope of the arch and crossed the coastline of China, the thunderhead of neon reached above her head, spread out to embrace her, developed into three dimensions and she was still several miles away from it.The coastal neighborhoods consisted of block after block of reinforced concrete apartment buildings, four to five stories high, looking older than the Great Wall though their real age could not have exceeded a few decades, and decorated on the ends facing the street with large cartoonish billboards, some mediatronic, most just painted on.For the first kilometer or so, most of these were targeted at businessmen just coming in from New Chusan, and in particular from the New Atlantis Clave.Glancing at these billboards as she went by them,  Nell concluded that visitors from New Atlantis played an important role in supporting casinos and bordellos, both the old fashioned variety and the newer scripted fantasy emporia, where you could be the star in a little play you wrote yourself.Nell slowed down to examine several of these, memorizing the addresses of ones with especially new or well executed signs.She had no clear plan in mind yet.All she knew was that she had to keep moving purposefully.Then the young men squatting on the curbs talking into their cellphones would keep eyeing her but leave her alone.The moment she stopped or looked the tiniest bit uncertain, they would descend.The dense wet air along the Huang Pu was supporting millions of tons of air buoys, and Nell felt every kilogram of their weight pressing upon her ribs and shoulders as she skated up and down the main waterfront thoroughfare, trying to maintain her momentum and her false sense of purposefulness.This was the Coastal Republic, which appeared to have no fixed principles other than that money talked and that it was a good thing to get rich.Every tribe in the world seemed to have its own skyscraper here.Some, like New Atlantis, were not actively recruiting and simply used the size and magnificence of their buildings as a monument to themselves.Others, like the Boers, the Parsis, the Jews, went for the understated approach, and in Pudong anything understated was more or less invisible.Still others the Mormons, the First Distributed Republic, and the Chinese Coastal Republic itself used every square inch of their mediatronic walls to proselytize.The only phyle that didn't seem to appreciate the ecumenical spirit of the place was the Celestial Kingdom itself.Nell stumbled across their territory, half a square block surrounded with a stucco sheathed masonry wall, circular gates here and there, and an old three story structure inside, done in high Ming style with eaves that curved way up at the corners and sculpted dragons along the ridgeline of the roof.The place was so tiny compared to the rest of Pudong that it looked as if you might trip over it.The gates were guarded by men in armor, presumably backed up by other, less obvious defensive systems.Nell was fairly certain that she was being followed, unobtrusively, by at least three young men who had locked on to her during her initial passage in from the coast, and who were waiting to find out whether she really had somewhere to go or was just faking it.She had already made her way from one end of the waterfront to the other, pretending to be a tourist who just wanted to take in a view of the Bund across the river.She was now heading back into the heart of downtown Pudong, where she had better look as if she were doing something.Passing by the grand entrance to one of the skyscrapers a Coastal Republic edifice, not barbarian turf she recognized its mediaglyphic logo from one of the signs she had seen on the way into town.Nell could at least fill out an application without committing herself.It would allow her to kill an hour in relatively safe and clean surroundings.The important thing, as Dojo had taught her long ago in a different context, was not to stop; without movement she could do nothing.Alas, Madame Ping's office suite was closed.A few lights were on in the back, but the doors were locked and no receptionist was on duty.Nell did not know whether to be amused or annoyed; whoever heard of a brothel that closed down after dark?But then these were only the administrative offices.She loitered in the lobby for a few minutes, then caught a down elevator.Just as the doors were closing, someone jumped into the lobby and slammed the button, opening them back up again.A young Chinese man with a small, slender body, large head, neatly dressed, carrying some papers."Pardon me," he said."Did you require something?""I'm here to apply for a job," Nell said.The man's eyes traveled up and down her body in a coolly professional fashion, almost completely devoid of prurience, starting and stopping on her face."As a performer," he said.The intonation was somewhere between a question and a declaration."As a scriptwriter," she said.Unexpectedly, he broke into a grin."I have qualifications that I will explain in detail. ""We have writers.We contract for them on the network. ""I'm surprised.How can a contract writer in Minnesota possibly provide your clients with the personalized service they require?""You could almost certainly get a job as a performer," said the young man."You would start tonight.Good pay. ""Just by looking at the billboards on the way in, I could see that your customers aren't paying for bodies.They are paying for ideas.That's your value added, right?""Pardon me?"said the young man, grinning again."Your value added.The reason you can charge more than a whorehouse, pardon my language, is that you provide a scripted fantasy scenario tailored to the client's requirements.I can do that for you," Nell said."I know these people, and I can make you a lot of money. ""You know what people?""The Vickys.I know them inside and out," Nell said."Please come inside," said the young man, gesturing toward the diamondoid door with MADAME PING'S written on it in red letters."Would you care for tea?"..."There are only two industries.This has always been true," said Madame Ping, enfolding a lovely porcelain teacup in her withered fingers, the two inch fingernails interleaving neatly like the pinions of a raptor folding its wings after a long hard day of cruising the thermals."There is the industry of things, and the industry of entertainment.The industry of things comes first.It keeps us alive.But making things is easy now that we have the Feed.This is not a very interesting business anymore."After people have the things they need to live, everything else is entertainment.Everything.This is Madame Ping's business. "Madame Ping had an office on the hundred and eleventh floor with a nice unobstructed view across the Huang Pu and into downtown Shanghai.When it wasn't foggy, she could even see the facade of her theatre, which was on a side street a couple of blocks in from the Bund, its mediatronic marquee glowing patchily through the dun limbs of an old sycamore tree.She had a telescope mounted in one of her windows, fixed upon the theatre's entrance, and noting Nell's curiosity, she encouraged her to look through it.Nell had never looked through a real telescope before.It had a tendency to jiggle and go out of focus, it didn't zoom, and panning was tricky.But for all that, the image quality was a lot better than photographic, and she quickly forgot herself and began sweeping it back and forth across the city.She checked out the little Celestial Kingdom Clave in the heart of the old city, where a couple of Mandarins stood on a zigzag bridge across a pond, contemplating a swarm of golden carp, wispy silver beards trailing down over the colorful silk of their lapels, blue sapphire buttons on their caps flashing as they nodded their heads.She looked into a high rise building farther inland, apparently a foreign concession of some type, where some Euros were holding a cocktail party, some venturing onto the balcony with glasses of wine and doing some eavesdropping of their own.Finally she leveled the 'scope toward the horizon, out past the vast dangerous triad ridden suburbs, where millions of Shanghai's poor had been forcibly banished to make way for highrises.Beyond that was real agricultural land, a fractal network of canals and creeks glimmering like a golden net as they reflected the lambency of the sunset, and beyond that, as always, a few scattered pillars of smoke in the ultimate distance, where the Fists of Righteous Harmony were burning the foreign devils' Feed lines."You are a curious girl," Madame Ping said."That is natural.But you must never let any other person especially a client see your curiosity.Never seek information.Sit quietly and let them bring it to you.What they conceal tells you more than what they reveal.Do you understand?""Yes, madam," Nell said, turning toward her interlocutor with a little curtsy.Rather than trying to do Chinese etiquette and making a hash of it, she was taking the Victorian route, which worked just as well.For purposes of this interview, Henry (the young man who had offered her tea) had advanced her a few hard ucus, which she had used to compile a reasonably decent full length dress, hat, gloves, and reticule.She had gone in nervous and realized within a few minutes that the decision to hire her had already been made, somehow, and that this little get together was actually more along the lines of an orientation session."Why is the Victorian market important to us?"Madame Ping asked, and fixed Nell with an incisive glare."Because New Atlantis is one of the three first tier phyles. ""Not correct.The wealth of New Atlantis is great, yes.But its population is just a few percent.The successful New Atlantis man is busy and has just a bit of time for scripted fantasies.He has much money, you understand, but little opportunity to spend it.No, this market is important because everyone else the men of all other phyles, including many of Nippon want to be like Victorian gentlemen.Look at the Ashantis the Jews the Coastal Republic.Do they wear traditional costume?Sometimes.Usually though, they wear a suit on the Victorian pattern.They carry an umbrella from Old Bond Street.They have a book of Sherlock Holmes stories.They play in Victorian ractives, and when they have to spend their natural urges, they come to me, and I provide them with a scripted fantasy that was originally requested by some gentleman who came sneaking across the Causeway from New Atlantis. "Somewhat uncharacteristically, Madame Ping turned two of her claws into walking legs and made them scurry across the tabletop, like a furtive Vicky gent trying to slip into Shanghai without being caught on a monitor.Recognizing her cue, Nell covered her mouth with one gloved hand and tittered."This way, Madame Ping does a magic trick she turns one satisfied client from New Atlantis into a thousand clients from all tribes. ""I must confess that I am surprised," Nell ventured."Inexperienced as I am in these matters, I had supposed that each tribe would exhibit a different preference. ""We change the script a little," Madame Ping said, "to allow for cultural differences.But the story never changes.There are many people and many tribes, but only so many stories. "Peculiar practices in the woods;  the Reformed Distributed Republic;  an extraordinary conversation in a log cabin;  CryptNet;  the Hackworths depart.Half a day's slow eastward ride took them well up into the foothills of the Cascades, where the clouds, flowing in eternally from the Pacific, were forced upward by the swelling terrain and unburdened themselves of their immense stores of moisture.The trees were giants, rising branchless to far above their heads, the trunks aglow with moss.The landscape was a checkerboard of old growth forest alternating with patches that had been logged in the previous century; Hackworth tried to guide Kidnapper toward the latter, because the scarcity of undergrowth and deadfalls made for a smoother ride.They passed through the remains of an abandoned timber town, half small clapboard buildings and half moss covered and rust streaked mobile homes.Through their dirty windows, faded signs were dimly visible, stenciled THIS HOUSEHOLD DEPENDS ON TIMBER MONEY.Ten foot saplings grew up through cracks in the streets.Narrow hedges of blueberry shrubs and blackberry canes sprouted from the rain gutters of houses, and gigantic old cars, resting askew on flat and cracked tires, had become trellises for morning glories and vine maples.They also passed through an old mining encampment that had been abandoned even longer ago.For the most part, the signs of modern habitation were relatively subtle.The houses up here tended to be of the same unassuming style favored by the software khans closer to Seattle, and from place to place a number of them would cluster around a central square with playground equipment, cafs, stores, and other amenities.He and Fiona stopped at two such places to exchange ucus for coffee, sandwiches, and cinnamon rolls.The unmarked, decussating paths would have been confusing to anyone but a native.Hackworth had never been here before.He had gotten the coordinates from the second fortune cookie in Kidnapper's glove compartment, which was much less cryptic than the first had been.He had no way to tell whether he was really going anywhere.His faith did not begin to waver until evening approached, the eternal clouds changed from silver to dark gray, and he noticed that the chevaline was taking them higher and toward less densely populated ground.Then he saw the rocks and knew he had chosen the right path.A wall of brown granite, dark and damp from the condensing fog, materialized before them.They heard it before they saw it; it made no sound, but its presence changed the acoustics of the forest.The fog was closing in, and they could barely see the silhouettes of scrubby, wind gnarled mountain trees lined up uncomfortably along the top of the cliff.Amid those trees was the silhouette of a human being."Quiet," Hackworth mouthed to his daughter, then reined Kidnapper to a stop.The person had a short haircut and wore a bulky waist length jacket with stretch pants; they could tell by the curve of the hips that it was a woman.Around those hips she had fastened an arrangement of neon green straps: a climbing harness.She wore no other outdoor paraphernalia, though, no knapsack or helmet, and behind her on the clifftop they could just make out the silhouette of a horse, prodding the ground with its nose.From time to time she checked her wristwatch.A tenuous neon strand of rope hung down the bulging face of the cliff from where the woman stood.The last several meters dangled loosely in the mist in front of a small cozy pocket sheltered by the overhang.Hackworth turned around to get Fiona's attention, then pointed something out: a second person, making his way along the base of the cliff, out of sight of the woman above.Moving carefully and quietly, he eventually reached the shelter of the overhang.He gingerly took the dangling end of the rope and tied it to something, apparently a piece of hardware fixed into the rock.Then he left the way he had come, moving silently and staying close to the cliff.The woman remained still and silent for several minutes, checking her watch more and more frequently.Finally she backed several paces away from the edge of the cliff, took her hands out of her jacket pockets, seemed to draw a few deep breaths, then ran forward and launched herself into space.She screamed as she did it, a scream to drive out her own fear.The rope ran through a pulley fixed near the top of the cliff.She fell for a few meters, the rope tightened, the man's knot held, and the rope, which was somewhat elastic, brought her to a firm but not violent stop just above the wicked pile of rubble and snags at the base of the cliff.Swinging at the end of the rope, she grabbed it with one hand and leaned back, baring her throat to the mist, allowing herself to dangle listlessly for a few minutes, basking in relief.A third person, previously unseen, emerged from the trees.This one was a middle aged man, and he was wearing a jacket that had a few vaguely official touches such as an armband and an insignia on the breast pocket.He walked beneath the dangling woman and busied himself for a few moments beneath the overhang, eventually releasing the rope and letting her safely to the ground.The woman detached herself from the rope and then the harness and fell into a businesslike discussion with this man, who poured both of them hot drinks from a thermal flask."Have you heard of these people?The Reformed Distributed Republic," Hackworth said to Fiona, still keeping his voice low."I am only familiar with the First. ""The First Distributed Republic doesn't hang together very well in a way, it was never designed to.It was started by a bunch of people who were very nearly anarchists.As you've probably learned in school, it's become awfully factionalized. ""I have some friends in the F. D. R. ," Fiona said."Your neighbors?""Yes. ""Software khans," Hackworth said."The F. D. R.  works for them, because they have something in common old software money.They're almost like Victorians a lot of them cross over and take the Oath as they get older.But for the broad middle class, the F. D. R.  offers no central religion or ethnic identity. ""So it becomes balkanized. ""Precisely.These people," Hackworth said, pointing to the man and the woman at the base of the cliff, "are R. D. R. , Reformed Distributed Republic.Very similar to F. D. R. , with one key difference. ""The ritual we just witnessed?""Ritual is a good description," Hackworth said."Earlier today, that man and that woman were both visited by messengers who gave them a place and time nothing else.In this case, the woman's job was to jump off that cliff at the given time.The man's job was to tie the end of the rope before she jumped.A very simple job "  "But if he had failed to do it, she'd be dead," Fiona said."Precisely.The names are pulled out of a hat.The participants have only a few hours' warning.Here, the ritual is done with a cliff and a rope, because there happened to be a cliff in the vicinity.In other R. D. R.  nodes, the mechanism might be different.For example, person A might go into a room, take a pistol out of a box, load it with live ammunition, put it back in the box, and then leave the room for ten minutes.During that time, person B is supposed to enter the room and replace the live ammunition with a dummy clip having the same weight.Then person A comes back into the room, puts the gun to his head, and pulls the trigger. ""But person A has no way of knowing whether person B has done his job?""Exactly. ""What is the role of the third person?""A proctor.An official of the R. D. R.  who sees to it that the two participants don't try to communicate. ""How frequently must they undergo this ritual?""As frequently as their name comes up at random, perhaps once every couple of years," Hackworth said."It's a way of creating mutual dependency.These people know they can trust each other.In a tribe such as the F. D. R. , whose view of the universe contains no absolutes, this ritual creates an artificial absolute. "The woman finished her hot drink, shook hands with the proctor, then began to ascend a polymer ladder, fixed to the rock, that took her back toward her horse.Hackworth spurred Kidnapper into movement, following a path that ran parallel to the base of the cliff, and rode for half a kilometer or so until it was joined by another path angling down from above.A few minutes later, the woman approached, riding her horse, an old fashioned biological model.She was a healthy, open faced, apple cheeked woman, still invigorated by her leap into the unknown, and she greeted them from some distance away, without any of the reserve of neo Victorians."How do you do," Hackworth said, removing his bowler.The woman barely glanced at Fiona.She reined her horse to a gentle stop, eyes fixed on Hackworth's face.She was wearing a distracted look."I know you," she said."But I don't know your name. ""Hackworth, John Percival, at your service.This is my daughter Fiona. ""I'm sure I've never heard that name," the woman said."I'm sure I've never heard yours," Hackworth said cheerfully."Maggie," the woman said."This is driving me crazy.Where have we met?""This may sound rather odd," Hackworth said gently, "but if you and I could both remember all of our dreams which we can't, of course and if we compared notes long enough, we would probably find that we had shared a few over the years. ""A lot of people have similar dreams," Maggie said."Excuse me, but that's not what I mean," Hackworth said."I refer to a situation in which each of us would retain his or her own personal point of view.I would see you.You would see me.We might then share certain experiences together each of us seeing it from our own perspective."Like a ractive?""Yes," Hackworth said, "but you don't have to pay for it.Not with money, anyway. "...The local climate lent itself to hot drinks.Maggie did not even take off her jacket before going into her kitchen and putting a kettle on to boil.The place was a log cabin, airier than it looked from the outside, and Maggie apparently shared it with several other people who were not there at the moment.Fiona, walking to and from the bathroom, was fascinated to see evidence of men and women living and sleeping and bathing together.As they sat around having their tea, Hackworth persuaded Maggie to poke her finger into a thimble size device.When he took this object from his pocket, Fiona was struck by a powerful sense of dj vu.She had seen it before, and it was significant.She knew that her father had designed it; it bore all the earmarks of his style.Then they all sat around making small talk for a few minutes; Fiona had many questions about the workings of the R. D. R. , which Maggie, a true believer, was pleased to answer.Hackworth had spread a sheet of blank paper out on the table, and as the minutes went by, words and pictures began to appear on it and to scroll up the page after it had filled itself up.The thimble, he explained, had placed some reconnaissance mites into Maggie's bloodstream, which had been gathering information, flying out through her pores when their tape drives were full, and offloading the data into the paper."It seems that you and I have a mutual acquaintance, Maggie," he said after a few minutes."We are carrying many of the same tuples in our bloodstreams.They can only be spread through certain forms of contact. ""You mean, like, exchange of bodily fluids?"Maggie said blankly.Fiona thought briefly of old fashioned transfusions and probably would not have worked out the real meaning of this phrase had her father not flushed and glanced at her momentarily."I believe we understand each other, yes," Hackworth said.Maggie thought about it for a moment and seemed to get irked, or as irked as someone with her generous and contented nature was ever likely to get.She addressed Hackworth but watched Fiona as she tried to construct her next sentence."Despite what you Atlantans might think of us, I don't sleep ...I mean, I don't have s ...I don't have that many partners. ""I am sorry to have given you the mistaken impression that I had formed any untoward preconceptions about your moral standards," Hackworth said."Please be assured that I do not regard myself as being in any position to judge others in this regard.However, if you could be so forthcoming as to tell me who, or with whom, in the last year or so ... ""Just one," Maggie said."It's been a slow year. "Then she set her tea mug down on the table (Fiona had been startled by the unavailability of saucers) and leaned back in her chair, looking at Hackworth alertly."Funny that I'm telling you this stuff you, a stranger. ""Please allow me to recommend that you trust your instincts and treat me not as a stranger. ""I had a fling.Months and months ago.That's been it. ""Where?""London. "A trace of a smile came onto Maggie's face."You'd think living here, I'd go someplace warm and sunny.But I went to London.I guess there's a little Victorian in all of us."It was a guy," Maggie went on."I had gone to London with a couple of girlfriends of mine.One of them was another R. D. R.  citizen and the other, Trish, left the R. D. R.  about three years ago and co founded a local CryptNet node.They've got a little point of presence down in Seattle, near the market. ""Please pardon me for interrupting," Fiona said, "but would you be so kind as to explain the nature of CryptNet?One of my old school friends seems to have joined it. ""A synthetic phyle.Elusive in the extreme," Hackworth said."Each node is independent and self governing," Maggie said."You could found a node tomorrow if you wanted.Nodes are defined by contracts.You sign a contract in which you agree to provide certain services when called upon to do so. ""What sorts of services?""Typically, data is delivered into your system.You process the data and pass it on to other nodes.It seemed like a natural to Trish because she was a coder, like me and my housemates and most other people around here. ""Nodes have computers then?""The people themselves have computers, typically embedded systems," Maggie said, unconsciously rubbing the mastoid bone behind her ear."Is the node synonymous with the person, then?""In many cases," Maggie said, "but sometimes it's several persons with embedded systems that are contained within the same trust boundary. ""May I ask what level your friend Trish's node has attained?"Hackworth said.Maggie looked uncertain."Eight or nine, maybe.Anyway, we went to London.While we were there, we decided to take in some shows.I wanted to see the big productions.Those were nice we saw a nice Doctor Faustus at the Olivier. ""Marlowe's?""Yes.But Trish had a knack for finding all of these little, scruffy, out of the way theatres that I never would have found in a million years they weren't marked, and they didn't really advertise, as far as I could tell.We saw some radical stuff really radical. ""I don't imagine you are using that adjective in a political sense," Hackworth said."No, I mean how they were staged.In one of them, we walked into this bombed out old building in Whitechapel, full of people milling around, and all this weird stuff started happening, and after a while I realized that some of the people were actors and some were audience and that all of us were both, in a way.It was cool I suppose you can get stuff like that on the net anytime, in a ractive, but it was so much better to be there with real, warm bodies around.I felt happy.Anyway, this guy was going to the bar for a pint, and he offered to get me one.We started talking.One thing led to another.He was really intelligent, really sexy.An African guy who knew a lot about the theatre.This place had back rooms.Some of them had beds. ""After you were finished," Hackworth said, "did you experience any unusual sensations?"Maggie threw back her head and laughed, thinking that this was a bit of wry humor on Hackworth's part.But he was serious."After we were finished?"she said."Yes.Let us say, several minutes afterward. "Suddenly Maggie became disconcerted."Yeah, actually," she said."I got hot.Really hot.We had to leave, 'cause I thought I had a flu or something.We went back to the hotel, and I took my clothes off and stood out on the balcony.My temperature was a hundred and four.But the next morning I felt fine.And I've felt fine ever since. ""Thank you, Maggie," Hackworth said, rising to his feet and pocketing the sheet of paper.Fiona rose too, following her father's cue."Prior to your London visit, had your social life been an active one?"Maggie got a little pinker."Relatively active for a few years, yes. ""What sort of crowd?CryptNet types?People who spent a lot of time near the water?"Maggie shook her head."The water?I don't understand. ""Ask yourself why you have been so inactive, Maggie, since your liaison with Mr.  ""Beck.Mr.Beck. ""With Mr.Beck.Could it be that you found the experience just a bit alarming?Exchange of bodily fluids followed by a violent rise in core temperature?"Maggie was poker faced."I recommend that you look into the subject of spontaneous combustion," Hackworth said.And without further ceremony, he reclaimed his bowler and umbrella from the entryway and led Fiona back out into the forest.Hackworth said, "Maggie did not tell you everything about CryptNet.To begin with, it is believed to have numerous unsavoury connexions and is a perennial focus of Protocol Enforcement's investigations.And" Hackworth laughed ruefully "it is patently untrue that ten is the highest level. ""What is the goal of this organisation?"Fiona asked."It represents itself as a simple, moderately successful data processing collective.But its actual goals can only be known by those privileged to be included within the trust boundary of the thirty third level," Hackworth said, his voice slowing down as he tried to remember why he knew all of these things."It is rumoured that, within that select circle, any member can kill any other simply by thinking of the deed. "Fiona leaned forward and wrapped her arms snugly around her father's body, nestled her head between his shoulder blades, and held tight.She thought that the subject of CryptNet was closed; but a quarter of an hour later, as Kidnapper carried them swiftly through the trees down toward Seattle, her father spoke again, picking up the sentence where he had left it, as if he had merely paused for breath.His voice was slow and distant and almost trancelike, the memories percolating outward from deep storage with little participation from his conscious mind."CryptNet's true desire is the Seed a technology that, in their diabolical scheme, will one day supplant the Feed, upon which our society and many others are founded.Protocol, to us, has brought prosperity and peace to CryptNet, however, it is a contemptible system of oppression.They believe that information has an almost mystical power of free flow and self replication, as water seeks its own level or sparks fly upward and lacking any moral code, they confuse inevitability with Right.It is their view that one day, instead of Feeds terminating in matter compilers, we will have Seeds that, sown on the earth, will sprout up into houses, hamburgers, spaceships, and books that the Seed will develop inevitably from the Feed, and that upon it will be founded a more highly evolved society. "He stopped for a moment, took a deep breath, and seemed to stir awake; when he spoke again, it was in a clearer and stronger voice."Of course, it can't be allowed the Feed is not a system of control and oppression, as CryptNet would maintain.It is the only way order can be maintained in modern society if everyone possessed a Seed, anyone could produce weapons whose destructive power rivalled that of Elizabethan nuclear weapons.This is why Protocol Enforcement takes such a dim view of CryptNet's activities. "The trees parted to reveal a long blue lake below them.Kidnapper found its way to a road, and Hackworth spurred it on to a hand gallop.Within a few hours, father and daughter were settling into bunkbeds in a second class cabin of the airship Falkland Islands, bound for London.From the Primer, Princess Nell's activities as Duchess of Turing;  the Castle of the Water gates;  other castles;  the Cipherers' Market;  Nell prepares for her final journey.Princess Nell remained in Castle Turing for several months.During her quest for the twelve keys, she had entered many castles, outwitted their sentries, picked their locks, and rifled their treasuries; but Castle Turing was an altogether different place, a place that ran on rules and programs that were devised by men and that could be rewritten by one who was adept in the language of the ones and zeroes.She need not content herself with sneaking in, seizing a trinket, and fleeing.Castle Turing she made her own.Its demesne became Princess Nell's kingdom.First she gave the Duke of Turing a decent burial.Then she studied his books until she had mastered them.She acquainted herself with the states by which the soldiers, and the mechanical Duke, could be programmed.She entered a new master program Into the Duke and then restarted the turning of the mighty Shaft that powered the castle.Her first efforts were unsuccessful, as her program contained many errors.The original Duke himself had not been above this; he called them bugs, in reference to a large beetle that had become entangled in one of his chains during an early experiment and brought the first Turing machine to a violent halt.But with steadfast patience, Princess Nell resolved these bugs and made the mechanical Duke into her devoted servant.The Duke in turn had the knack of putting simple programs into all of the soldiers, so that an order given him by Nell was rapidly disseminated into the entire force.For the first time in her life, the Princess had an army and servants.But it was not a conquering sort of army, because the springs in the soldiers' backs unwound rapidly, and they did not have the adaptability of human soldiers.Still, it was an effective force behind the walls of the castle and made her secure from any conceivable aggressor.Following maintenance schedules that had been laid down by the original Duke, Princess Nell set the soldiers to work greasing the gears, repairing cracked shafts and worn bearings, and building new soldiers out of stockpiled parts.She was heartened by her success.But Castle Turing was only one of seven ducal seats in this kingdom, and she knew she had much work to do.The territory around the castle was deeply forested, but grassy ridges rose several miles away, and standing on the castle walls with the original Duke's spyglass, Nell was able to see wild horses grazing there.Purple had taught her the secrets of mastering wild horses, and Duck had taught her how to win their affection, and so Nell mounted an expedition to these grasslands and returned a week later with two beautiful mustangs, Coffee and Cream.She equipped them with fine tack from the Duke's stables, marked with the T crest for the crest was hers now, and she could with justification call herself the Duchess of Turing.She also brought a plain, unmarked saddle so that she could pass for a commoner if need be though Princess Nell had become so beautiful over the years and had developed such a fine bearing that few people would mistake her for a commoner now, even if she were dressed in rags and walking barefoot.Lying in her bunkbed in Madame Ping's dormitory, reading these words from a softly glowing page in the middle of the night, Nell wondered at that.Princesses were not genetically different from commoners.On the other side of a fairly thin wall she could hear water running in half a dozen sinks as young women performed their crepuscular ablutions.Nell was the only scripter staying in Madame Ping's dormitory; the others were performers and were just coming back from a long vigorous shift, rubbing liniment on their shoulders, sore from wielding paddles against clients' bottoms, or snorting up great nostril loads of mites programmed to seek out their inflamed buttocks and help to repair damaged capillaries overnight.And of course, many more traditional activities were going on, such as douching, makeup removal, moisturizing, and the like.The girls went through these motions briskly, with the unselfconscious efficiency that the Chinese all seemed to share, discussing the day's events in the dry Shanghainese dialect.Nell had been living among these girls for a month and was just starting to pick up a few words.They all spoke English anyway.She stayed up late reading the Primer in the dark.The dormitory was a good place for this; Madame Ping's girls were professionals, and after a few minutes of whispering, giggling, and scandalized communal shushing, they always went to sleep.Nell sensed that she was coming close to the end of the Primer.This would have been evident even if she hadn't been closing in on Coyote, the twelfth and final Faery King.In the last few weeks, since Nell had entered the domain of King Coyote, the character of the Primer had changed.Formerly, her Night Friends or other characters had acted with minds of their own, even if Nell just went along passively.Reading the Primer had always meant racting with other characters in the book while also having to think her way through various interesting situations.Recently the former element had been almost absent.Castle Turing had been a fair sample of King Coyote's domain: a place with few human beings, albeit filled with fascinating places and situations.She made her lonesome way across the domain of King Coyote, visiting one castle after another, and encountering a different conundrum in each one.The second castle (after Castle Turing) was built on the slope of a mountain and had an elaborate irrigation system in which water from a bubbling spring was routed through a system of gates.There were many thousands of these gates, and they were connected to each other in small groups, so that one gate's opening or closing would, in some way, affect that of the others in its group.This castle grew its own food and was suffering a terrible famine because the arrangement of gates had in some way become fubared.A dark, mysterious knight had come to visit the place and apparently sneaked out of his bedroom in the middle of the night and fiddled with connections between some gates in such a way that water no longer flowed to the fields.Then he had disappeared, leaving behind a note stating that he would fix the problem in exchange for a large ransom in gold and jewels.Princess Nell spent some time studying the problem and eventually noticed that the system of gates was actually a very sophisticated version of one of the Duke of Turing's machines.Once she understood that the behavior of the water gates was orderly and predictable, it was not long before she was able to program their behavior and locate the bugs that the dark knight had introduced into the system.Soon water was flowing through the irrigation system again, and the famine was relieved.The people who lived in this castle were grateful, which she had expected.But then they put a crown on her head and made her their ruler, which she had not expected.On some reflection, though, it only made sense.They would die unless their system functioned properly.Princess Nell was the only person who knew how it worked; she held their fate in her hands.They had little choice but to submit to her rule.So it went, as Princess Nell proceeded from castle to castle, inadvertently finding herself at the helm of a full fledged rebellion against King Coyote.Each castle depended on some kind of a programmable system that was a little more complicated than the previous one.After the Castle of the Water gates, she came to a castle with a magnificent organ, powered by air pressure and controlled by a bewildering grid of push rods, which could play music stored on a roll of paper tape with holes punched through it.A mysterious dark knight had programmed the organ to play a sad, depressing tune, plunging the place into a profound depression so that no one worked or even got out of bed.With some playing around, Princess Nell established that the behavior of the organ could be simulated by an extremely sophisticated arrangement of water gates, which meant, in turn, that it could just as well be reduced to an unfathomably long and complicated Turing machine program.When she had the organ working properly and the residents cheered up, she moved on to a castle that functioned according to rules written in a great book, in a peculiar language.Some pages of the book had been ripped out by the mysterious dark knight, and Princess Nell had to reconstruct them, learning the language, which was extremely pithy and made heavy use of parentheses.Along the way, she proved what was a foregone conclusion, namely, that the system for processing this language was essentially a more complex version of the mechanical organ, hence a Turing machine in essence.Next was a castle divided into many small rooms, with a system for passing messages between rooms through a pneumatic tube.In each room was a group of people who responded to the messages by following certain rules laid out in books, which usually entailed sending more messages to other rooms.After familiarizing herself with some of these rule books and establishing that the castle was another Turing machine, Princess Nell fixed a problem in the message delivery system that had been created by the vexatious dark knight, collected another ducal coronet, and moved on to castle number six.This place was entirely different.It was much bigger.It was much richer.And unlike all of the other castles in the domain of King Coyote, it worked.As she approached the castle, she learned to keep her horse to the edge of the road, for messengers were constantly blowing past her at a full gallop in both directions.It was a vast open marketplace with thousands of stalls, filled with carts and runners carrying product in all directions.But no vegetables, fish, spices, or fodder were to be seen here; all the product was information written down in books.The books were trundled from place to place on wheelbarrows and carried here and there on great long seedylooking conveyor belts made of hemp and burlap.Book carriers bumped into each other, compared notes as to what they were carrying and where they were going, and swapped books for other books.Stacks of books were sold in great, raucous auctions and paid for not with gold but with other books.Around the edges of the market were stalls where books were exchanged for gold, and beyond that, a few alleys where gold could be exchanged for food.In the midst of this hubbub, Princess Nell saw a dark knight sitting on a black horse, paging through one of these books.Without further ado, she spurred her horse forward and drew her sword.She slew him in single combat, right there in the middle of the marketplace, and the book sellers simply backed out of their way and ignored them as Princess Nell and the dark knight hacked and slashed at each other.When the dark knight fell dead and Princess Nell sheathed her sword, the commotion closed in about her again, like the waters of a turbulent river closing over a falling stone.Nell picked up the book that the dark knight had been reading and found that it contained nothing but gibberish.It was written in some kind of a cipher.She spent some time reconnoitering, looking for the center of the place, and found no center.One stall was the same as the next.There was no tower, no throne room, no clear system of authority.Examining the market stalls in more detail, she saw that each one included a man who did nothing but sit at a table and decipher books, writing them out on long sheets of foolscap and handing them over to other people, who would read through the contents, consult rule books, and dictate responses to the man with the quill pen, who enciphered them and wrote them out in books that were then tossed out into the marketplace for delivery.The men with the quill pens, she noticed, always wore jeweled keys on chains around their necks; the key was apparently the badge of the cipherers' guild.This castle proved fiendishly difficult to figure out, and Nell spent a few weeks working on it.Part of the problem was that this was the first castle Princess Nell had visited that was actually functioning as intended; the dark knight had not been able to foul the place up, probably because everything was done in ciphers here, and everything was decentralized.Nell discovered that a smoothly functioning system was much harder to puzzle out than one that was broken.In the end, Princess Nell had to apprentice herself to a master cipherer and learn everything there was to know about codes and the keys that unlocked them.This done, she was given her own key, as a badge of her office, and found a job in one of the stalls enciphering and deciphering books.As it turned out, the key was more than just a decoration; rolled up inside its shaft was a strip of parchment inscribed with a long number that could be used to decipher a message, if the sender wanted you to decipher it.From time to time she would go to the edge of the market, exchange a book for some gold, then go buy some food and drink.On one of these trips, she saw another member of the cipherer's guild, also taking his break, and noticed that the key hanging around his neck looked familiar: it was one of the eleven keys that Nell and her Night Friends had taken from the Faery Kings and Queens!She concealed her excitement and followed this cipherer back to his stall, making a note of where he worked.Over the next few days, going from stall to stall and examining each cipherer, she was able to locate the rest of the eleven keys.She was able to steal a look at the rule books that her employers used to respond to the encoded messages.They were written in the same special language used at the previous two castles.In other words, once Princess Nell had deciphered the messages, her stall functioned like another Turing machine.It would have been easy enough to conclude that this whole castle was, like the others, a Turing machine.But the Primer had taught Nell to be very careful about making unwarranted assumptions.Just because her stall functioned according to Turing rules did not mean that all of the others did.And even if every stall in this castle was, in fact, a Turing machine, she still could not come to any fixed conclusions.She had seen riders carrying books to and from the castle, which meant that cipherers must be at work elsewhere in this kingdom.She could not verify that all of them were Turing machines.It did not take long for Nell to attain prosperity here.After a few months (which in the Primer were summarized in as many sentences) her employers announced that they were getting more work than they could handle.They decided to split their operation.They erected a new stall at the edge of the market and gave Nell some of their rule books.They also obtained a new key for her.This was done by dispatching a special coded message to the Castle of King Coyote himself, which was three days' ride to the north.Seven days later, Nell's key came back to her in a scarlet box bearing the seal of King Coyote himself.From time to time, someone would come around to her stall and offer to buy her out.She always turned them down but found it interesting that the keys could be bought and sold in this fashion.All Nell needed was money, which she quickly accumulated through shrewd dealings in the market.
