Dont ask questions, Sergeant.Just follow me.We stepped onto a roundabout and transferred to an eastbound slidewalk.Do you want something to eat or drink?she asked innocently.I tried to leer.Any alternatives?She laughed gaily.Several people stared.Just a second  here!We jumped off.It was a corridor marked Roomettes.She handed me a key.That damned plastic coverall was held on by static electricity.Since the roomette was nothing but a big waterbed, I almost broke my neck the first time it shocked me.I recovered.We were lying on our stomachs, looking through the one way glass wall at the people rushing around down on the concourse.Marygay passed me a joint.William, have you used that thing yet?What thing?That hawg leg.The pistol.Only shot it once, in the store where I bought it.Do you really think you could point it at someone and blow him apart?I took a shallow puff and passed it back.Hadnt given it much thought, really.Until we talked last night.Well?I  I dont really know.The only time Ive killed was on Aleph, under hypnotic compulsion.But I dont think it would  bother me, not that much, not if the person was trying to kill me in the first place.Why should it?Life, she said plaintively, life is  Life is a bunch of cells walking around with a common purpose.If that common purpose is to get my ass  Oh, William.You sound like old Cortez.Cortez kept us alive.Not many of us, she snapped.I rolled over and studied the ceiling tiles.She traced little designs on my chest, pushing the sweat around with her fingertip.Im sorry, William.I guess were both just trying to adjust.Thats okay.Youre right, anyhow.We talked for a long time.The only urban center Marygay had been to since our publicity rounds (which were very shelted) was Sioux Falls.She had gone with her parents and the commune bodyguard.It sounded like a scaled down version of Washington: the same problems, but not as acute.We ticked off the things that bothered us: violence, high cost of living, too many people everywhere.Id have added homolife, but Marygay said I just didnt appreciate the social dynamic that had led to it; it had been inevitable.The only thing she said she had against it was that it took so many of the prettiest men out of circulation.And the main thing that was wrong was that everything seemed to have gotten just a little worse, or at best remained the same.You would have predicted that at least a few facets of everyday life would improve markedly in twenty two years.Her father contended the War was behind it all: any person who showed a shred of talent was sucked up by UNEF; the very best fell to the Elite Conscription Act and wound up being cannon fodder.It was hard not to agree with him.Wars in the past often accelerated social reform, provided technological benefits, even sparked artistic activity.This one, however, seemed tailor made to provide none of these positive by products.Such improvements as had been made on late twentieth century technology were  like tachyon bombs and warships two kilometers long  at best, interesting developments of things that only required the synergy of money and existing engineering techniques.Social reform?The world was technically under martial law.As for art, Im not sure I know good from bad.But artists to some extent have to reflect the temper of the times.Paintings and sculpture were full of torture and dark brooding; movies seemed static and plotless; music was dominated by nostalgic revivals of earlier forms; architecture was mainly concerned with finding someplace to put everybody; literature was damn near incomprehensible.Most people seemed to spend most of their time trying to find ways to outwit the government, trying to scrounge a few extra KS or ration tickets without putting their lives in too much danger.And in the past, people whose country was at war were constantly in contact with the war.The newspapers would be full of reports, veterans would return from the front; sometimes the front would move right into town, invaders marching down Main Street or bombs whistling through the night air but always the sense of either working toward victory or at least delaying defeat.The enemy was a tangible thing, a propagandists monster whom you could understand, whom you could hate.But this war  the enemy was a curious organism only vaguely understood, more often the subject of cartoons than nightmares.The main effect of the war on the home front was economic, unemotional, more taxes but more jobs as well.After twenty two years, only twenty seven returned veterans; not enough to make a decent parade.The most important fact about the war to most people was that if it ended suddenly, Earths economy would collapse.You approached the dirigible by means of a small propeller driven aircraft that drifted up to match trajectories and docked alongside.A clerk took our baggage and we checked our weapons with the purser, then went outside.Just about everybody on the flight was standing out on the promenade deck, watching Manhattan creep toward the horizon.It was an eerie sight.The day was very still, so the bottom thirty or forty stories of the buildings were buried in smog.It looked like a city built on a cloud, a thunderhead floating.We watched it for a while and then went inside to eat.The meal was elegantly served and simple: filet of beef, two vegetables, wine.Cheese and fruit and more wine for dessert.No fiddling with ration tickets; a loophole in the rationing laws implied that they were not required for meals consumed en route, on intercontinental transport.We spent a lazy, comfortable three days crossing the Atlantic.The dirigibles had been a new thing when we first left Earth, and now they had turned out to be one of the few successful new financial ventures of the late twentieth century  the company that built them had bought up a few obsolete nuclear weapons; one bombsized hunk of plutonium would keep the whole fleet in the air for years.And, once launched, they never did come down.Floating hotels, supplied and maintained by regular shuttles, they were one last vestige of luxury in a world where nine billion people had something to eat, and almost nobody had enough.London was not as dismal from the air as New York City had been; the air was clean even if the Thames was poison.We packed our handbags, claimed our weapons, and landed on a VTO pad atop the London Hilton.We rented a couple of tricycles at the hotel and, maps in hand, set off for Regent Street, planning on dinner at the venerable Cafe Royal.The tricycles were little armored vehicles, stabilized gyroscopically so they couldnt be tipped over.Seemed overly cautious for the part of London we traveled through, but I supposed there were probably sections as rough as Washington.I got a dish of marinated venison and Marygay got salmon; both very good but astoundingly expensive.At first I was a bit overawed by the huge room, filled with plush and mirrors and faded gilding, very quiet even with a dozen tables occupied, and we talked in whispers until we realized that was foolish.Over coffee I asked Marygay what the deal was with her parents.Oh, it happens often enough, she said.Dad got mixed up in some ration ticket thing.Hed gotten some black market tickets that turned out to be counterfeit.Cost him his job and he probably would have gone to jail, but while he was waiting for trial a bodysnatcher got him.Bodysnatcher?Thats right.All the commune organizations have them.Theyve got to get reliable farm labor, people who arent eligible for relief  people who cant just lay down their tools and walk off when it gets rough.Almost everybody can get enough assistance to stay alive, though; everyone who isnt on the governments fecal roster.So he skipped out before his trial came up?She nodded.It was a case of choosing between commune life, which he knew wasnt easy, and going on the dole after a few years working on a prison farm; exconvicts cant get legitimate jobs.They had to forfeit their condominium, which theyd put up for bail, but the government wouldve gotten that anyhow, once he was in jail.So the bodysnatcher offered him and Mother new identities, transportation to the commune, a cottage, and a plot of land.They took it.And what did the bodysnatcher get?He himself probably didnt get anything.The commune got their ration tickets; they were allowed to keep their money, although they didnt have very much  What happens if they get caught?Not a chance.She laughed.The communes provide over half the countrys produce  theyre really just an unofficial arm of the government.Im sure the CBI knows exactly where they are  Dad grumbles that its just a fancy way of being in jail anyhow.What a weird setup.Well, it keeps the land farmed.She pushed her empty dessert plate a symbolic centimeter away from her.And theyre eating better than most people, better than they ever had in the city.Mom knows a hundred ways to fix chicken and potatoes.After dinner we went to a musical show.The hotel had gotten us tickets to a cultural translation of the old rock opera Hair.The program explained that they had taken some liberties with the original choreography, because back in those days they didnt allow actual coition on stage.The music was pleasantly old fashioned, but neither of us was quite old enough to work up any blurry eyed nostalgia over it.Still, it was much more enjoyable than the movies Id seen, and some of the physical feats performed were quite inspiring.We slept late the next morning.We dutifully watched the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace, walked through the British Museum, ate fish and chips, ran up to Stratford on Avon and caught the Old Vic doing an incomprehensible play about a mad king, and didnt get into any trouble until the day before we were to leave for Lisbon.It was about 2 A. M.  and we were tooling our tricycles down a nearly deserted thoroughfare.Turned a corner and there was a gang of boys beating the hell out of someone.I screeched to the curb and leaped out of my vehicle, firing the shotgun pistol over their heads.It was a girl they were attacking, it was rape.Most of them scattered, but one pulled a pistol out of his coat and I shot him.I remember trying to aim for his arm.The blast hit his shoulder and ripped off his arm and what seemed to be half of his chest; it flung him two meters to the side of a building and he must have been dead before he hit the ground.The others ran, one of them shooting at me with a little pistol as he went.I watched him trying to kill me for the longest time before it occurred to me to shoot back.I sent one blast way high and he dove into an alley and disappeared.The girl looked dazedly around, saw the mutilated body of her attacker, and staggered to her feet and ran off screaming, naked from the waist down.I knew I should have tried to stop her, but I couldnt find my voice and my feet seemed nailed to the sidewalk.A tricycle door slammed and Marygay was beside me.What hap She gasped, seeing the dead man.Wh what was he doing?I just stood there stupefied.Id certainly seen enough death these past two years, but this was a different thing  there was nothing noble in being crushed to death by the failure of some electronic component, or in having your suit fail and freeze you solid; or even dying in a shoot out with the incomprehensible enemy  but death seemed natural in that setting.Not on a quaint little street in old fashioned London, not for trying to steal what most people would give freely.Marygay was pulling my arm.Weve got to get out of here.Theyll brainwipe you!She was right.I turned and took one step and fell to the concrete.I looked down at the leg that had betrayed me and bright red blood was pulsing out of a small hole in my calf.Marygay tore a strip of cloth from her blouse and started to bind it.I remember thinking it wasnt a big enough wound to go into shock over, but my ears started to ring and I got lightheaded and everything went red and fuzzy.Before I went under, I heard a siren wailing in the distance.Fortunately, the police also picked up the girl, who was wandering down the street a few blocks away.They compared her version of the thing with mine, both of us under hypnosis.They let me go with a stern admonition to leave law enforcement up to professional law enforcers.I wanted to get out of the cities: just put a pack on my back and wander through the woods for a while, get my mind straightened out.So did Marygay.But we tried to make arrangements and found that the country was worse than the cities.Farms were practically armed camps, the areas between ruled by nomad gangs who survived by making lightning raids into villages and farms, murdering and plundering for a few minutes, and then fading back into the forest, before help could arrive.Still, Britishers called their island the most civilized country in Europe.From what wed heard about France and Spain and Germany, especially Germany, they were probably right.I talked it over with Marygay, and we decided to cut short our tour and go back to the States.We could finish the tour after wed become acclimated to the twenty first century.It was just too much foreignness to take in one dose.The dirigible line refunded most of our money and we took a conventional suborbital flight back home.The high altitude made my leg throb, though it was nearly healed.Theyd made great strides in the treatment of gunshot wounds, in the past twenty years.Lots of practice.We split up at Ellis.Her description of commune life appealed to me more than the city; I made arrangements to join her after a week or so, and went back to Washington.10  I rang the bell and a strange woman answered the door, opening it a couple of centimeters and peering through.Pardon me, I said, isnt this Mrs.Mandellas residence?Oh, you must be William!She closed the door and unfastened the chains and opened it wide.Beth, look whos here!My mother came into the living room from the kitchen, drying her hands on a towel.Willy  what are you doing back so soon?Well, its  its a long story.Sit down, sit down, the other woman said.Let me get you a drink, dont start till I get back.Wait, my mother said.I havent even introduced you two.William, this is Rhonda Wilder.Rhonda, William.Ive been so looking forward to meeting you, she said.Beth has told me all about you  one cold beer, right?Right.She was likable enough, a trim middle aged woman.I wondered why I hadnt met her before.I asked my mother whether she was a neighbor.Uh  really more than that, William.Shes been my roommate for a couple of years.Thats why I had an extra room when you came home  a single person isnt allowed two bedrooms.But why  I didnt tell you because I didnt want you to feel that you were putting her out of her room while you stayed here.And you werent, actually; she has  Thats right.Rhonda came in with the beer.Ive got relatives in Pennsylvania, out in the country.I can stay with them any time.Thanks.I took the beer.Actually, I wont be here long.Im kind of en route to South Dakota.I could find another place to flop.Oh, no, Rhonda said I can take the couch.I was too oldfashioned male chauv to allow that; we discussed it for a minute and I wound up with the couch.I filled Rhonda in on who Marygay was and told them about our disturbing experiences in England, how we came back to get our bearings.I had expected my mother to be horrified that I had killed a man, but she accepted it without comment.Rhonda clucked a little bit about our being out in a city after midnight, especially without a bodyguard.We talked on these and other topics until late at night, when Mother called her bodyguard and went off to work.Something had been nagging at me all night, the way Mother and Rhonda acted toward each other.I decided to bring it out into the open, once Mother was gone.Rhonda I settled down in the chair across from her.I didnt know exactly how to put it.What  uh, what exactly is your relationship with my mother?She took a long drink.Good friends.She stared at me with a mixture of defiance and resignation.Very good friends.Sometimes lovers.I felt very hollow and lost.My mother?Listen, she continued.You had better stop trying to live in the nineties.This may not be the best of all possible worlds, but youre stuck with it.She crossed and took my hand, almost kneeling in front of me.Her voice was softer.William  look, Im only two years older than you are  that is, I was born two years before  what I mean is, I can understand how you feel.But, your mother understands too.It, our  relationship, wouldnt be a secret to anybody else.Its perfectly normal.A lot has changed, these twenty years.Youve got to change too.I didnt say anything.She stood up and said firmly, You think, because your mother is sixty, shes outgrown her need for love?She needs it more than you do.Even now.Especially now.Accusation in her eyes.Especially now with you coming back from the dead past.Reminding her of how old she is.How old I am, twenty years younger.Her voice quavered and cracked, and she ran to her room.I wrote Mother a note saying that Marygay had called; an emergency had come up and I had to go immediately to South Dakota.I called a bodyguard and left.A whining, ozone leaking, battered old bus let me out at the intersection of a bad road and a worse one.It had taken me an hour to go the 2000 kilometers to Sioux Falls, two hours to get a chopper to Geddes, 150 kilometers away, and three hours waiting and jouncing on the dilapidated bus to go the last 12 kilometers to Freehold, an organization of communes where the Potters had their acreage.I wondered if the progression was going to continue and I would be four hours walking down this dirt road to the farm.It was a half hour before I even came to a building.My bag was getting intolerably heavy and the bulky pistol was chafing my hip.I walked up a stone path to the door of a simple plastic dome and pulled a string that caused a bell to tinkle inside.A peephole darkened.Who is it?Voice muffled by thick wood.Stranger asking directions.Ask.I couldnt tell whether it was a woman or a child.Im looking for the Potters farm.Just a second.Footsteps went away and came back.Down the road one point nine klicks.Lots of potatoes and green beans on your right.Youll probably smell the chickens.Thanks.If you want a drink we got a pump out back.Cant let you in without my husbands at home.I understand.Thank you.The water was metallic tasting but wonderfully cool.I wouldnt know a potato or green bean plant if it stood up and took a bite out of my ankle, but I knew how to walk a half meter step.So I resolved to count to 3800 and take a deep breath.I supposed I could tell the difference between the smell of chicken manure and the absence thereof.At 3650 there was a rutted path leading to a complex of plastic domes and rectangular buildings apparently made of sod.There was a pen enclosing a small population explosion of chickens.They had a smell but it wasnt strong.Halfway down the path, a door opened and Marygay came running out, wearing one tiny wisp of cloth.After a slippery but gratifying greeting, she asked what I was doing here so early.Oh, my mother had friends staying with her.I didnt want to put them out.Suppose I should have called.Indeed you should have  save you a long dusty walk but weve got plenty of room, dont worry about that.She took me inside to meet her parents, who greeted me warmly and made me feel definitely overdressed.Their faces showed their age but their bodies had no sag and few wrinkles.Since dinner was an occasion, they let the chickens live and instead opened a can of beef, steaming it along with a cabbage and some potatoes.To my plain tastes it was equal to most of the gourmet fare wed had on the dirigible and in London.Over coffee and goat cheese (they apologized for not having wine; the commune would have a new vintage out in a couple of weeks), I asked what kind of work I could do.Will, Mr.Potter said, I dont mind telling you that your coming here is a godsend.Weve got five acres that are.just sitting out there, fallow, because we dont have enough hands to work them.You can take the plow tomorrow and start breaking up an acre at a time.More potatoes, Daddy?Marygay asked.No, no  not this season.Soybeans cash crop and good for the soil.And Will, at night we all take turns standing guard.With four of us, we ought to be able to do a lot more sleeping.He took a big slurp of coffee.Now, what else  Richard, Mrs.Potter said, tell him about the greenhouse.Thats right, yes, the greenhouse.The commune has a two acre greenhouse down about a click from here, by the recreation center.Mostly grapes and tomatoes.Everybody spends one morning or one afternoon a week there.Why dont you children go down there tonight  show Will the night life in fabulous Freehold?Sometimes you can get a real exciting game of checkers going.Oh, Daddy.Its not that bad.Actually, it isnt.Theyve got a fair library and a coin op terminal to the Library of Congress.Marygay tells me youre a reader.Thats good.Sounds fascinating.It did.But what about guard?No problem.Mrs.Potter  April  and Ill take the first four hours oh, he said, standing, let me show you the setup.We went out back to the tower, a sandbag but on stilts.Climbed up a rope ladder through a hole in the middle of the hut.A little crowded in here, with Two, Richard said.Have a seat.There was an old piano stool beside the hole in the floor.I sat on it.Its handy to be able to see all the field without getting a crick in your neck.Just dont keep turning in the same direction all the time.He opened a wooden crate and uncovered a sleek rifle, wrapped in oily rags.Recognize this?Sure.Id had to sleep with one in basic training.Army standard issue T sixteen.Semi automatic, twelve caliber tumblers  where the hell did you get it?Commune went to a government auction.Its an antique now, son.He handed it to me and I snapped it apart.Clean, too clean.Has it ever been used?Not in almost a year.Ammo costs too much for target practice.Take a couple of practice shots, though, convince yourself that it works.I turned on the scope and just got a washed out bright green.Set for nighttime.Clicked it back to log zero, set the magnification at ten, reassembled it.Marygay didnt want to try it out.Said shed had her fill of that.I didnt press her, but a persons got to have confidence in ther tools.I clicked off the safety and found a clod of dirt that the range finder said was between 100 and 120 meters away.Set it at 110, rested the barrel of the rifle on the sandbags, centered the clod in the crosshairs, and squeezed.The round hissed out and kicked up dirt about five centimeters low.Fine.I reset it for night use and safetied it and handed it back.What happened a year ago?He wrapped it up carefully, keeping the rags away from the eyepiece.Had some jumpers come in.Fired a few rounds and scared em away.All right, whats a jumper?Yeah, you wouldnt know.He shook out a tobacco cigarette and passed me the box.I dont know why they dont just call em thieves, thats what they are.Murderers, too, sometimes.They know that a lot of the commune members are pretty well off.If you raise cash crops you get to keep half the cash; besides, a lot of our members were prosperous when they joined.Anyhow, the jumpers take advantage of our relative isolation.They come out from the city and try to sneak in, usually hit one place, and run.Most of the time, they dont get this far in, but the farms closer to the road  we hear gunfire every couple of weeks.Usually just scaring off kids.If it keeps up, a siren goes off and the commune goes on alert.Doesnt sound fair to the people living close to the road.Therere compensations.They only have to donate half as much of their crop as the rest of us do.And theyre issued heavier weapons.Marygay and I took the familys two bicycles and pedaled down to the recreation center.I only fell off twice, negotiating the bumpy road in the dark.It was a little livelier than Richard had described it.A young nude girl was dancing sensuously to an assortment of homemade drums near the far side of the dome.Turned out she was still in school; it was a project for a cultural relativity class.Most of the people there, in fact, were young and therefore still in school.They considered it a joke, though.After you had learned to read and write and could pass the Class I literacy test, you only had to take one course per year, and some of those you could pass just by signing up.So much for the eighteen years compulsory education they had startled us with at Stargate.Other people were playing board games, reading, watching the girl gyrate, or just talking.There was a bar that served soya, coffee, or thin homemade beer.Not a ration ticket to be seen; all made by the commune or purchased outside with commune tickets.We got into a discussion about the war, with a bunch of people who knew Marygay and I were veterans.Its hard to describe their attitude, which was pretty uniform.They were angry in an abstract way that it took so much tax money to support; they were convinced that the Taurans would never be any danger to Earth; but they all knew that nearly half the jobs in the world were associated with the war, and if it stopped, everything would fall apart.I thought everything was in shambles already, but then I hadnt grown up in this world.And they had never known peacetime.We went home about midnight and Marygay and I each stood two hours guard.By the middle of the next morning, I was wishing I had gotten a little more sleep.The plow was a big blade on wheels with two handles for steering, atomic powered.Not very much power, though; enough to move it forward at a slow crawl if the blade was in soft earth.Needless to say, there was little soft earth in the unused five acres.The plow, would go a few centimeters, get stuck, freewheel until I put some back into it, then move a few more centimeters.I finished a tenth of an acre the first day and eventually got it up to a fifth of an acre a day.It was hard, hardening work, but pleasant.I had an earclip that piped music to me, old tapes from Richards collection, and the sun browned me all over.I was beginning to think I could live that way forever, when suddenly it was finished.Marygay and I were reading up at the recreation center one evening when we heard faint gunfire down by the road.We decided itd be smart to get back to the house.We were less than halfway there when firing broke out all along our left, on a line that seemed to extend from the road to far past the recreation center: a coordinated attack.We had to abandon the bikes and crawl on hands and knees in the drainage ditch by the side of the road, bullets hissing over our heads.A heavy vehicle rumbled by, shooting left and right.It took a good twenty minutes to crawl home.We passed two farmhouses that were burning brightly.I was glad ours didnt have any wood.I noticed there was no return fire coming from our tower, but didnt say anything.There were two dead strangers in front of the house as we rushed inside.April was lying on the floor, still alive but bleeding from a hundred tiny fragment wounds.The living room was rubble and dust; someone must have thrown a bomb through a door or window.I left Marygay with her mother and ran out back to the tower.The ladder was pulled up, so I had to shinny up one of the stilts.Richard was sitting slumped over the rifle.In the pale green glow from the scope I could see a perfectly round hole above his left eye.A little blood had trickled down the bridge of his nose and dried.I laid his body on the floor and covered his head with my shirt.I filled my pockets with clips and took the rifle back to the house.Marygay had tried to make her mother comfortable.They were talking quietly.She was holding my shotgun pistol and had another gun on the floor beside her.When I came in she looked up and nodded soberly, not crying.April whispered something and Marygay asked, Mother wants to know whether  Daddy had a hard time of it.She knows hes dead.No.Im sure he didnt feel anything.Thats good.Its something.I should keep my mouth shut.It is good, yes.I checked the doors and windows for an effective vantage point.I couldnt find anyplace that wouldnt allow a whole platoon to sneak up behind me.Im going to go outside and get on top of the house.Couldnt go back to the tower.Dont you shoot unless somebody gets inside  maybe theyll think the place is deserted.By the time I had clambered up to the sod roof, the heavy truck was coming back down the road.Through the scope I could see that there were five men on it, four in the cab and one who was on the open bed, cradling a machine gun, surrounded by loot.He was crouched between two refrigerators, but I had a clear shot at him.Held my fire, not wanting to draw attention.The truck stopped in front of the house, sat for a minute, and turned in.The window was probably bulletproof, but I sighted on the drivers face and squeezed off around.He jumped as it ricocheted, whining, leaving an opaque star on the plastic, and the man in back opened up.A steady stream of bullets hummed over my head; I could hear them thumping into the sandbags of the tower.He didnt see me.The truck wasnt ten meters away when the shooting stopped.He was evidently reloading, hidden behind the refrigerator.I took careful aim and when he popped up to fire I shot him in the throat.The bullet being a tumbler, it exited through the top of his skull.The driver pulled the truck around in a long arc so that, when it stopped, the door to the cab was flush with the door of the house.This protected them from the tower and also from me, though I doubted they yet knew where I was; a T 16 makes no flash and very little noise.I kicked off my shoes and stepped cautiously onto the top of the cab, hoping the driver would get out on his side.Once the door opened I could fill the cab with ricocheting bullets.No good.The far door, hidden from me by the roofs overhang, opened first.I waited for the driver and hoped that Marygay was well hidden.I shouldnt have worried.There was a deafening roar, then another and another.The heavy truck rocked with the impact of thousands of tiny flechettes.One short scream that the second shot ended.I jumped from the truck and ran around to the back door.Marygay had her mothers head on her lap, and someone was crying softly.I went to them and Marygays cheeks were dry under my palms.Good work, dear.She didnt say anything.There was a steady heavy dripping sound from the door and the air was acrid with smoke and the smell of fresh meat.We huddled together until dawn.I had thought April was sleeping, but in the dim light her eyes were wide open and filmed.Her breath came in shallow rasps.Her skin was gray parchment and dried blood.She didnt answer when we talked to her.A vehicle was coming up the road, so I took the rifle and went outside.It was a dump truck with a white sheet draped over one side and a man standing in the back with a megaphone repeating, Wounded  wounded.I waved and the truck came in.They took April out on a makeshift litter and told us which hospital they were going to.We wanted to go along but there was simply no room; the bed of the truck was covered with people in various stages of disrepair.Marygay didnt want to go back inside because it was getting light enough to see the men she had killed so completely.I went back in to get some cigarettes and forced myself to look.It was messy enough, but just didnt disturb me that much.That bothered me, to be confronted with a pile of human hamburger and mainly notice the flies and ants and smell.Death is so much neater in space.We buried her father behind the house, and when the truck came back with Aprils small body wrapped in a shroud, we buried her beside him.The communes sanitation truck came by a little later, and gas masked men took care of the jumpers bodies.We sat in the baking sun, and finally Marygay wept, for a long time, silently.11  We got off the plane at Dulles and found a monorail to Columbia.It was a pleasingly diverse jumble of various kinds of buildings, arranged around a lake, surrounded by trees.All of the buildings were connected by slidewalk to the largest place, a fullerdome with stores and schools and offices.We could have taken the enclosed slidewalk to Moms place, but instead walked alongside it in the good cold air that smelled of fallen leaves.People slid by on the other side of the plastic, carefully not staring.Mom didnt answer her door, but shed given me an entry card.Mom was asleep in the bedroom, so Marygay and I settled in the living room and read for a while.We were startled suddenly by a loud fit of coughing from the bedroom.I raced over and knocked on the door.William?I didnt coughingcome in, I didnt know you were  She was propped up in bed, the light on, surrounded by various nostrums.She looked ghastly, pale and lined.She lit a joint and it seemed to quell the coughing.When did you get in?I didnt know  Just a few minutes ago  How long has this  have you been  Oh, its just a bug I picked up after Rhonda went to see her kids.Ill be fine in a couple of days.She started coughing again, drank some thick red liquid from a bottle.All of her medicines seemed to be the commercial, patent variety.Have you seen a doctor?Doctor?Heavens no, Willy.They dont have  its not serious  dont  Not serious?At eighty four.For Chrissake, mother.I went to the phone in the kitchen and with some difficulty managed to get the hospital.A plain girl in her twenties formed in the cube.Nurse Donalson, general services.She had a fixed smile, professional sincerity.But then everybody smiled.My mother needs to be looked at by a doctor.She has a  Name and number, please.Beth Mandella.I spelled it.What number?Medical services number, of course, she smiled.I called into Mom and asked her what her number was.She says she cant remember.Thats all right, sir, Im sure I can find her records.She turned her smile to a keyboard beside her and punched out a code.Beth Mandella?she said, her smile turning quizzical.Youre her son?She must be in her eighties.Please.Its a long story.She really has to see a doctor.Is this some kind of joke?What do you mean?Strangled coughing from the other room, the worst yet.Really  this might be very serious, youve got to  But sir, Mrs.Mandella got a zero priority rating way back in 2010.What the hell is that supposed to mean?S i r The smile was hardening in place.Look.Pretend that I came from another planet.What is azero priority rating?Another  oh!I know you!She looked off to the left.Sonya  come over here a second.Youd never guess who Another face crowded the cube, a vapid blonde girl whose smile was twin to the other nurses.Remember?On the stat this morning?Oh, yeah, she said.One of the soldiers  hey, thats really max, really max.The head withdrew.Oh, Mr.Mandella, she said, effusive.No wonder youre confused.Its really very simple.Well?Its part of the Universal Medical Security System.Everybody gets a rating on their seventieth birthday.It comes in automatically from Geneva.What does it rate?What does it mean?But the ugly truth was obvious.Well, it tells how important a person is and what level of treatment hes allowed.Class three is the same as anybody elses; class two is the same except for certain life extending  And class zero is no treatment at all.Thats correct, Mr.Mandella.And in her smile was not a glimmer of pity or understanding.Thank you.I disconnected.Marygay was standing behind me, crying soundlessly with her mouth wide open.I found mountaineers oxygen at a sporting goods store and even managed to get some black market antibiotics through a character in a bar downtown in Washington.But Mom was beyond being able to respond to amateur treatment.She lived four days.The people from the crematorium had the same fixed smile.I tried to get through to my brother, Mike, on the Moon, but the phone company wouldnt let me place the call until I had signed a contract and posted a $25,000 bond.I had to get a credit transfer from Geneva.The paperwork took half a day.I finally got through to him.Without preamble:  Mothers dead.For a fraction of a second, the radio waves wandered up to the moon, and in another fraction, came back.He started and then nodded his head slowly.No surprise.Every time Ive come down to Earth the past ten years, Ive wondered whether shed still be there.Neither of us had enough money to keep in very close touch.He had told us in Geneva that a letter from Luna to Earth cost $100 postage plus $5,000 tax.It discouraged communication with what the UN considered to be a bunch of regrettably necessary anarchists.We commiserated for a while and then Mike said, Willy, Earth is no place for you and Marygay; you know that by now.Come to Luna.Where you can still be an individual.Where we dont throw people out the airlock on their seventieth birthday.Wed have to rejoin UNEF.True, but you wouldnt have to fight.They say they need you more for training.You could study in your spare time, bring your physics up to date  maybe wind up eventually in research.We talked some more, a total of three minutes.I got $1000 back.Marygay and I talked about it through the night.Maybe our decision would have been different if we hadnt been staying there, surrounded by Mothers life and death, but when the dawn came the proud, ambitious, careful beauty of Columbia had turned sinister and foreboding.We packed our bags and had our money transferred to the Tycho Credit Union and took a monorail to the Cape.In case youre interested, you arent the first combat veterans to come back.The recruiting officer was a muscular lieutenant of indeterminate sex.I flipped a coin mentally and it came up tails.Last I heard, there had been nine others, she said in her husky tenor.All of them opted for the moon  maybe youll find some of your friends there.She slid two simple forms across the desk.Sign these and youre in again.Second lieutenants.The form was a simple request to be assigned to active duty; we had never really gotten out of the Force, since they extended the draft law, but had just been on inactive status.I scrutinized the paper.Theres nothing on this about the guarantees we were given at Stargate.That wont be necessary.The Force will  I think it is necessary, Lieutenant.I handed back the form.So did Marygay.Let me check.She left the desk and disappeared into an office.After a while we heard a printer rattle.She brought back the same two sheets, with an addition typed under our names:  GUARANTEED LOCATION OF CHOICE [LUNA] AND ASSIGNMENT OF CHOICE [COMBAT TRAINING SPECIALIST].We got a thorough physical checkup and were fitted for new fighting suits, made our financial arrangements, and caught the next mornings shuttle.We laid over at Earthport, enjoying zero gravity for a few hours, and then caught a ride to Luna, setting down at the Grimaldi base.On the door to the Transient Officers Billet, some wag had scraped abandon hope all ye who enter.We found our two man cubicle and began changing for chow.Two raps on the door.Mail call, sirs.I opened the door and the sergeant standing there saluted.I just looked at him for a second and then remembered I was an officer and returned the salute.He handed me two identical faxes.I gave one to Marygay and we both gasped at the same time:   ***ORDERS***ORDERS***ORDERS***  THE FOLLOWING NAMED PERSONNEL:  Mandella, William 2LT [11 575 278] COCOMM D CO GRITRABN AND  Potter, Marygay 2LT [17 386 907] COCOMM B CO GRITRABN  ARE HEREBY REASSIGNED TO:  LT Mandella: PLCOMM 2 PL STFTHETA STARGATE  LT Potter: PLCOMM 3 PL STFTHETA STARGATE.DESCRIPTION OF DUTIES:  Command infantry platoon in Tet 2 Campaign.THE ABOVE NAMED PERSONNEL WILL REPORT IMMEDIATELY TO GRIMALDI TRANSPORTATION BATTALION TO BE MANIFESTED TO STARGATE.ISSUED STARGATE TACI3D/1298 8684 1450/20 Aug 2019 SG:  BY AUTHO STFCOM Commander.
