Rendezvous in one thousand seconds, Kjet. ""I'll be ready. ""Good. "Jo cut the link without saying anything more to Ravna Bergsndot.Seconds later, Trenglets and the other commanders were gone.It was just Svensndot and the two Dirokimes  and Ravna Bergsndot looking out her window from Out of Band.Finally, Bergsndot said, "When I was a little girl on Herte, sometimes we would play kidnappers and Commercial Security.I always dreamed of being rescued by your company from fates worse than death. "Kjet smiled bleakly, "Well, you got the rescue attempt," and you not even a currently subscribed customer."This was far the biggest gun fight we've ever been in. ""I'm sorry, Kje  Group Captain. "He looked into her dark features.A lass from Sjandra Kei, down to the violet eyes.No way this could be a simulation, not here.He had bet everything that she was not; he still believed she was not.Yet  "What does your friend say about all this?"Pham Nuwen had not been seen since his so impressive godshatter act at the beginning of the battle.Ravna's glance shifted to something off camera."He's not saying much, Group Captain.He's wandering around even more upset than your Captain Trenglets.Pham remembers being absolutely convinced he was demanding the right thing, but now he can't figure out why it was right. ""Hmm. "A little late for second thoughts."What are you going to do now?Haugen is right, you know.It would be useless suicide for us to follow the Blighters to your destination.I daresay it's useless suicide for you, too.You'll arrive maybe fifty five hours before them.What can you do in that time?"Ravna Bergsndot looked back at him, and her expression slowly collapsed into sobbing grief."I don't know.I don't know. "She shook her head, her face hidden behind her hands and a sweep of black hair.Finally she looked up and brushed back her hair.Her voice was calm but very quiet."But we are going ahead.It's what we came for.Things could still work out You know there's something down there, something the Blight wants desperately.Maybe fifty five hours is enough to figure out what it is and tell the Net.And and we'll still have Pham's godshatter. "Your worst enemy?Quite possibly this Pham Nuwen was a construct of the Powers.He certainly looked like something built from a second hand description of humanity.But how can you tell godshatter from simple nuttery?She shrugged, as if acknowledging the doubts  and accepting them."So what will you and Commercial Security do?""There is no Commercial Security anymore.Virtually all our customers got shot out from under us.Now we've killed our company's owner  or at least destroyed her ship and those supporting her.We are Aniara Fleet now. "It was the official name chosen at the fleet conference just ended.There was a certain grim pleasure in embracing it, the ghost from before Sjandra Kei and before Nyjora, from the earliest times of the human race.For they were truly cast away now, from their worlds and their customers and their former leaders.One hundred ships bound for "We talked it over.A few still wanted to follow you to Tines' world.Some of the crews want to return to Middle Beyond, spend the rest of their lives killing Butterflies.The majority want to start the races of Sjandra Kei over again, some place where we won't be noticed, some place where no one cares if we live. "And the one thing everyone agreed on was that Aniara must be split no further, must make no further sacrifices outside of itself.Once that was clear, it was easy to decide what to do.In the wake of the Great Surge, this part of the Bottom was an incredible froth of Slowness and Beyond.It would be centuries before the zonographic vessels from above had reasonable maps of the new interface.Hidden away in the folds and interstices were worlds fresh from the Slowness, worlds where Sjandra Kei could be born again.Ny Sjandra Kei?He looked across the bridge at Tirolle and Glimfrelle.They were busy bringing the main navigation processors out of suspension.That wasn't absolutely necessary for the rendezvous with Lynsnar, but things would be a lot more convenient if both ships could maneuver.The brothers seemed oblivious to Kjet's conversation with Ravna.And maybe they weren't paying attention.In a way, the Aniara decision meant more to them than to the humans of the fleet: No one doubted that millions of humans survived in the Beyond (and who knew how many human worlds might still exist in the Slowness, distant cousins of Nyjora, distant children of Old Earth).But this side of the Transcend, the Dirokimes of Aniara were the only ones that existed.The dream habitats of Sjandra Kei were gone, and with them the race.There were at least a thousand Dirokimes left aboard Aniara, pairs of sisters and brothers scattered across a hundred vessels.These were the most adventurous of their race's latter days, and now they were faced with their greatest challenge.The two on Olvira had already been scouting among the survivors, looking for friends and dreaming a new reality.Ravna listened solemnly to his explanations."Group Captain, zonography is a tedious thing and your ships are near their limits.In this froth you might search for years and not find a new home. ""We're taking precautions.We're abandoning all our ships except the ones with ramscoop and coldsleep capability.We'll operate in coordinated nets; no one should be lost for more than a few years. "He shrugged."And if we never find what we seek  " if we die between the stars as our life support finally fails " well then, we will have still lived true to our name. "Aniara."I think we have a chance. "More than can be said for you.Ravna nodded slowly."Yes, well.It helps me to know that. "They talked a few minutes more, Tirolle and Glimfrelle joining in.They had been at the center of something vast, but as usual with the affairs of the Powers, no one knew quite what had happened, nor the result of the strivings."Rendezvous Lynsnar two hundred seconds," said the ship's voice.Ravna heard it, nodded.She raised her hand."Fare you well, Kjet Svensndot and Tirolle and Glimfrelle. "The Dirokimes whistled back the common farewell, and Svensndot raised his hand.The window on Ravna Bergsndot closed.Kjet Svensndot remembered her face all the rest of his life, though in later years it seemed more and more to be the same as Olvira's."Tines' world.I can see it, Pham!"The main window showed a true view upon the system: a sun less than two hundred million kilometers off, daylight across the command deck.The positions of identified planets were marked with blinking red arrows.But one of those  just twenty million kilometers off  was labeled "terrestrial".Coming off an interstellar jump, you couldn't get positioning much better than that.Pham didn't reply, just glared out the window as if there were something wrong with what they were seeing.Something had broken in him after the battle with the Blight.He'd been so sure of his godshatter  and so bewildered by the consequences.Afterwards he had retreated more than ever.Now he seemed to think that if they moved fast enough, the surviving enemy could do them no harm.More than ever he was suspicious of Blueshell and Greenstalk, as if somehow they were greater threats than the ships that still pursued."Damn," Pham said finally."Look at the relative velocity. "Seventy kilometers per second.Position matching was no problem, but "Matching velocities will cost us time, Sir Pham. "Pham's stare turned on Blueshell."We talked this out with the locals three weeks ago, remember?You managed the burn. ""And you checked my work, Sir Pham.This must be another nav system bug   though I didn't expect anything was wrong in simple ballistics. "A sign inverted, seventy klicks per second closing velocity instead of zero.Blueshell drifted toward the secondary console."Maybe," said Pham."Just now, I want you off the deck, Blueshell. ""But I can help!We should be contacting Jefri, and rematching velocities, and  "  "Get off the deck, Blueshell.I don't have time to watch you anymore," Pham dived across the intervening space and was met by Ravna, just short of the Rider.She floated between the two, talking fast, hoping whatever she said would both make sense and make peace."It's okay, Pham.He'll go. "She brushed her hand across one of Blueshell's wildly vibrating fronds.After a second, Blueshell wilted."I'll go.I'll go. "She kept an encouraging touch on him  and kept herself between him and Pham, as the Skroderider made a dejected exit.When the Rider was gone, she turned to Pham."Couldn't it have been a nav bug, Pham?"The other didn't seem to hear the question.The instant the hatch had closed, he had returned to the command console.OOB's latest estimate put the Blight's arrival less than fifty three hours away.And now they must waste time redoing a velocity match supposedly accomplished three weeks earlier."Somebody, something, screwed us over" Pham was muttering, even as he finished with the control sequence, "Maybe it was a bug.This next damn burn is going to be as manual as it can be. "Acceleration alarms echoed down the core of the OOB.Pham flipped through monitor windows, searching for loose items that might be big enough to be dangerous."You tie down, too. "He reached out to override the five minute timer.Ravna dived back across the deck, unfolding the free fall saddle into a seat and strapping in.She heard Pham speaking on the general announce channel, warning of the timer override.Then the impulse drive cut in, a lazy pressure back into the webbing.Four tenths of a gee  all the poor OOB could still manage.When Pham said manual, he meant it.The main window appeared to be bore centered now.The view didn't drift at the whim of the pilot, and there were no helpful legends and schematics.As much as possible, the were seeing true view along OOB's main axis.Peripheral windows were held in fixed geometry with main.Pham's eyes flickered from one to another, as his hands played over the command board.As near as could be, he was flying by his own senses, and trusting no one else.But Pham still had use for the ultradrive.They were twenty million klicks off target, a submicroscopic jump.Pham Nuwen fiddled with the drive parameters, trying to make an accurate jump smaller than the standard interval.Every few seconds the sunlight would shift a fraction, coming first over Ravna's left shoulder and then her right.It made reestablishing comm with Jefri nearly impossible.Suddenly the window below their feet was filled by a world, huge and gibbous, blue and swirling white.The Tines' world was as Jefri Olsndot advertised, a normal terrestrial planet.After the months aspace and the loss of Sjandra Kei, the sight caught Ravna short.Ocean, the world was mostly ocean, but near the terminator there were the darker shades of land.A single tiny moon was visible beyond the limb.Pham sucked in his breath."It's about ten thousand kilometers off.Perfect.Except we're closing at seventy klicks per second. "Even as she watched, the world seemed to grow, falling toward them.Pham watched it for few seconds more."Don't worry, we're going to miss, fly right past the, um, north limb. "The globe swelled below them, eclipsing the moon.She had always loved the appearance of Herte at Sjandra Kei.But that world had smaller oceans, and was criss crossed with Dirokime accidents.This place was as beautiful as Relay, and seemed truly untouched.The small polar cap was in sunlight, and she could follow the coastline that came south from it toward the terminator.I'm seeing the northwest coast.Jefri's right down there!Ravna reached for her keyboard, asked the ship to attempt both ultrawave comm and a radio link."Ultrawave contact," she said after a second."What does it say?""It's garbled.Probably just a ping response," acknowledgment to OOB's signal.Jefri was housed very near the ship these days; sometimes she had gotten responses almost immediately, even during his night time.It would be good to talk to him again, even if  Tines' world filled the entire aft and side windows now, its limb a barely curving horizon.Sky colors stood before them, fading to the black of space.Icecap and icebergs showed detail within detail against the sea.She could see cloud shadows.She followed the coast southwards, islands and peninsulas so closely fit that she could not be sure of one from the other.Blackish mountains and black striped glaciers.Green and brown valleys.She tried to remember the geography they had learned from Jefri.Hidden Island?But there were so many islands."I have radio contact from planet's surface," came the ship's voice.Simultaneously a blinking arrow pointed at a spot just in from the coast."Do you want the audio in real time?""Yes.Yes!"said Ravna, then punched at her keyboard when the ship did not respond immediately."Hei, Ravna.Oh, Ravna!"The little boy's voice bounced excitement around the deck.He sounded just as she had imagined.Ravna keyed in a request for two way.They were less than five thousand klicks from Jefri now, even if they were sweeping by at seventy kilometers per second.Plenty close enough for a radio conversation."Hei, Jefri!"she said."We're here at last, but we need  " we need all the cooperation your four legged friends can give us.How to say that quickly and effectively?But the boy on the ground already had an agenda: " need help now, Ravna!The Woodcarvers are attacking now. "There was a thumping, as if the transmitter was bouncing around.Another voice spoke, high pitched and weirdly inarticulate."This Steel, Ravna.Jefri right.Woodcarver  " the almost human voice dissolved into a hissing gobble.After a moment she heard Jefri's voice: "'Ambush', the word is 'ambush'. ""Yes Woodcarver has done big, big ambush.They all around now.We die in hours if you not help. "Woodcarver had never wanted to be a warrior.But ruling for half a thousand years requires a range of skills, and she had learned about making war.Some of that  such as trusting to staff  she had temporarily unlearned these last few days.There had indeed been an ambush on Margrum Climb, but not the one that Lord Steel had planned.She looked across the tented field at Vendacious.That pack was half hidden by noise baffles, but she could see he wasn't so jaunty as before.Being put to the question will loosen anyone's control.Vendacious knew his survival now depended on her keeping a promise.Yet it was awful to think that Vendacious would live after he had killed and betrayed so many.She realized that two of herself were keening rage, lips curled back from clenched teeth.Her puppies huddled back from threats unseen.The tented area stank of sweat and the mindnoise of too many people in too small a space.It took a real effort of will to calm herself.She licked the puppies, and daydreamed peaceful thoughts for a moment.Yes, she would keep her promises to Vendacious.And maybe it would be worth the price.Vendacious had only speculations about Steel's inner secrets, but he had learned far more about Steel's tactical situation than the other side could have guessed.Vendacious had known just where the Flenserists were hiding and in what numbers.Steel's folk had been overconfident about their super guns and their secret traitor.When Woodcarver's troops surprised them, victory had been easy  and now the Queen had some of these marvelous guns.From behind the hills, those cannons were still pounding away, eating through the stocks of ammunition the captured gunners had revealed.Vendacious the traitor had cost her much, but Vendacious the prisoner might yet bring her victory."Woodcarver?"It was Scrupilo.She waved him closer.Her chief gunner edged out of the sun, sat down an intimate twenty five feet away.Battle conditions had blown away all notions of decorum.Scrupilo's mind noise was an anxious jumble.He looked by parts exhausted and exhilarated and discouraged."It's safe to advance up the castle hill, Your Majesty," he said."Answering fire is almost extinguished.Parts of the castle walls have been breached.There is an end to castles here, My Queen.Even our own poor cannons would make it so. "She bobbed agreement.Scrupilo spent most of his time with Dataset in learning to make  cannons in particular.Woodcarver spent her time learning what those inventions ultimately created.By now she knew far more than even Johanna about the social effects of weapons, from the most primitive to ones so strange that they seemed not weapons at all.A thousand million times, castle technologies had fallen to things like cannon; why should her world be different?"We'll move up then  "  From beyond the shade of the tent there was a faint whistle, a rare, incoming round.She folded the puppies within herself, and paused a moment.Twenty yards away, Vendacious shrank down in a great cower.But when it came, the explosion was a muffled thump above them on the hill.It might even have been one of our own."Now our troops must take advantage of the destruction.I want Steel to know that the old games of ransom and torture will only win him worse. "We'll most likely win the starship and the child.The question was, would either be alive when they got them?She hoped Johanna would never know the threats and the risks she planned for the next few hours."Yes, Majesty. "But Scrupilo made no move to depart, and suddenly seemed more bedraggled and worried than ever."Woodcarver, I fear"  "What?We have the tide.We must rush to sail on it. ""Yes, Majesty But while we move forward, there are serious dangers coming up on our flanks and rear.The enemy's far scouts and the fires. "Scrupilo was right.The Flenserists who operated behind her lines were deadly.There weren't many of them; the enemy troops at Margrum Climb had been mostly killed or dispersed.The few that ate at Woodcarver's flanks were equipped with ordinary crossbows and axes but they were extraordinarily well coordinated.And their tactics were brilliant; she saw the snouts and tines of Flenser himself in that brilliance.Somehow her evil child lived.Like a plague of years past, he was slipping back upon the world.Given time, those guerrilla packs would seriously hurt Woodcarver's ability to supply her forces.Given time.Two of her stood and looked Scrupilo in the eyes, emphasizing the point: "All the more reason to move now, my friend.We are the ones far from home.We are the ones with limited numbers and food.If we don't win soon, then we will be cut up a bit at a time. "Flensed.Scrupilo stood up, nodding submission."That's what Peregrine says, too.And Johanna wants to chase right through the castle walls But there's something else, Your Majesty.Even if we must lunge all forward: I worked for a ten of tendays, using every clue I could understand from Dataset, to make our cannon.Majesty, I know how hard it is to do such.Yet the guns we captured on Margrum have three times the range and one quarter the weight.How could they do it?"There were chords of anger and humiliation in his voice."The traitor," Scrupilo jerked a snout in the direction of Vendacious, "thinks they may have Johanna's brother, but Johanna says they have nothing like Dataset.Majesty, Steel has some advantage we don't yet know. "Even the executions were not helping.Day by day, Steel felt his rage growing.Alone on the parapet, he whipped back and forth upon himself, barely conscious of anything but his anger.Not since he had been under Flenser's knife had the anger been such a radiant thing.Get back control, before he cuts you more, the voice of some early Steel seemed to say.He hung on the thought, pulled himself together.He stared down at bloody drool and tasted ashes.Three of his shoulders were streaked with tooth cuts  he'd been hurting himself, another habit Flenser had cured him of long ago.Hurt outwards, never toward yourself.Steel licked mechanically at the gashes and walked closer to the parapet's edge:  At the horizon, gray black haze obscured the sea and the islands.The last few days, the summer winds coming off the inland had been a hot breath, tasting of smoke.Now the winds were like fire themselves, whipping past the castle, carrying ash and smoke.All last dayaround the far side of Bitter Gorge had been a haze of fire.Today he could see the hillsides: they were black and brown, crowned with smoke that swept toward the sea's horizon.There were often brush and forest fires in the High Summer.But this year, as if nature was a godly pack of war, the fires had been everywhere.The wretched guns had done it.And this year, he couldn't retreat to the cool of Hidden Island and let the coastlings suffer.Steel ignored his smarting shoulders and paced the stones more thoughtfully, almost analytical for a change.The creature Vendacious had not stayed bought; he had turned traitor to his treason.Steel had anticipated that Vendacious might be discovered; he had other spies who should have reported such a thing.But there had been no sign until the disaster at Margrum Climb.Now the twist of Vendacious's knife had turned all his plans on their heads.Woodcarver would be here very soon, and not as a victim.Who would have guessed that he would really need the Spacers to rescue him from Woodcarver?He had worked so hard to confront the Southerners before Ravna arrived.But now he did need that help from the sky  and it was more than five hours away.Steel almost slipped back into rage state at the thought.In the end, would all the cozening of Amdijefri be for nothing?Oh, when this is over, how much will I enjoy killing those two.More than any of the others, they deserved death.They had caused so much inconvenience.They had consistently required his kindliest behavior, as though they ruled him.They had showered him with more insolence than ten thousand normal subjects.From the castle yard there was the sound of laboring packs, straining winches, the screech and groan of rock being moved about.The professional core of Flenser's Empire survived.Given a few more hours, the breaches in the walls would be repaired and new guns would be brought in from the north.And the grand scheme can still succeed.As long as I am together, no matter what else is lost, it can succeed.Almost lost in the racket, he heard the click of claws on the inward steps.Steel drew back, turned all heads toward the sound.Shreck?But Shreck would have announced himself first.Then he relaxed; there was only one set of claw sounds.It was a singleton coming up the stairs.Flenser's member cleared the steps, and bowed to Steel, an incomplete gesture without other members to mirror it.The member's radio cloak shone clean and dark.The army was in awe of those cloaks, and of the singletons and duos who seemed smarter than the brightest pack.Even Steel's lieutenants who understood what the cloaks really were  even Shreck  were cautious and tentative around them.And now Steel needed the Flenser Fragment more than anyone, more than anything except Starfolk gullibility."What news?""Leave to sit?"Was the sardonic Flenser smile behind that request?"Granted," snapped Steel.The singleton eased itself onto the stones, a parody of an insolent pack.But Steel saw when the other winced; the Fragment had been dispersed across the Domain for almost twenty days now.Except for brief periods, he had been wrapped in the radio cloaks that whole time.Dark and golden torture.Steel had seen this member without its cloak, when it was bathed.Its pelt was rubbed raw at shoulder and haunch, where the weight of the radio was greatest.Bleeding sores had opened at the center of the bald spots.Alone without its cloak, the mindless singleton had blabbered its pain.Steel enjoyed those sessions, even if this one was not especially verbal.It was almost as if he, Steel, were now the One who Teaches with a Knife, and Flenser were his pupil.The singleton was silent for a moment.Steel could hear its ill concealed panting."The last dayaround has gone well, My Lord. ""Not here!We've lost almost all our cannon.We're trapped inside these walls. "And the starfolk may arrive too late."I mean out there. "The singleton poked its nose toward the open spaces beyond the parapet."Your scouts are well trained, My Lord, and have some bright commanders.Right now, I am spread round Woodcarvers rear and flanks. "The singleton made its part of a laughing gesture."'Rear and flanks'.Funny.To me Woodcarver's entire army is like a single enemy pack.Our Attack Infantries are like tines on my own paws.We are cutting the Queen deep, My Lord.I set the fire in Bitter Gorge.Only I could see exactly where it was spreading, exactly how to kill with it.In another four dayarounds there will be nothing left of the Queen's supplies.She will be ours. ""Too long, if we're dead this afternoon. ""Yes. "The singleton cocked its head at Steel.He's laughing at me.Just like all those times under Flenser's knife when a problem would be posed and death was the penalty for failure."But Ravna and company should be back here in five hours, no?"Steel nodded."Well, I guarantee you that will be hours ahead of Woodcarver's main assault.You have Amdijefri's confidence.It seems you need only advance and compress your previous schedule.If Ravna is sufficiently desperate  "  "The starfolk are desperate.I know that. "Ravna might mask her precise motives, but her desperation was clear."And if you can slow Woodcarver  " Steel settled all of himself down to concentrate on the scheming at hand.He was half conscious of his fears retreating.Planning was always a comfort."The problem is that we have to do two things now, and perfectly coordinated.Before, it was simply a matter to feign a siege and trick the starship into landing in the castle's Jaws. "He turned a head in the direction of the courtyard.The stone dome over the landed starship had been in place since midspring.It showed some artillery damage now, the marble facing chipped away, but hadn't taken direct hits.Beside it lay the field of the Jaws: large enough to accept the rescue ship, but surrounded by pillars of stone, the teeth of the Jaws.With the proper use of gunpowder, the teeth would fall on the rescuers.That would be a last resort, if they didn't kill and capture the humans as they came out to meet dear Jefri.That scheme had been lovingly honed over many tendays, aided by Amdijefri's admissions about human psychology and his knowledge of how starships normally land.But now: " now we really need their help.What I ask them must do double duty, to fool them and to destroy Woodcarver. ""Hard to do all at once," agreed the Cloak."Why not play it in two steps, the first more or less undeceitful: Have them destroy Woodcarver, then worry about taking them over?"Steel clicked a tine thoughtfully on stone."Yes.Trouble is, if they see too much They can't possibly be as naive as Jefri.He says that humankind has a history that includes castles and warfare.If they fly around too much, they'll see things that Jefri never saw, or never understood Maybe I could get them to land inside the castle and mount weapons on the walls.We'll have them hostage the moment that they stand between our Jaws.Damn.That would take some clever work with Amdijefri. "The bliss of abstract planning foundered for a moment on rage."It's getting harder and harder for me to deal with those two. ""They're both wholly puppies, for Pack's sake. "The Fragment paused a second."Of course, Amdiranifani may have more raw intelligence than any pack I've ever seen.You think he may even be smart enough to see past his childishness," he used the Samnorsk word, "and see the deception?""No, not that.I have their necks in my jaws, and they still don't see it.You're right, Tyrathect; they do love me. "And how I hate them for it."When I'm around him, the mantis thing is all over me, close enough to cut my throat or poke out my eyes, but hugging and petting.And expecting me to love him back.Yes, they believe everything I say, but the price is accepting unending insolence. ""Be cool, dear student.The heart of manipulation is to empathize without being touched. "The Fragment stopped, as always, just short of the brink.Steel felt himself hissing at the words even before he was consciously aware of his reaction."Don't lecture me!You are not Flenser.You are a fragment.Shit!You are a fragment of a fragment now.A word and you will be cut up, dead in a thousand pieces. "He tried to suppress the trembling that spread through his members.Why haven't I killed him before now?I hate Flenser more than anything in the world, and it would be so easy.Yet the fragment was always so indispensable, somehow the only thing between Steel and failure.And he was under Steel's control.And the singleton was doing a very good terrified cower."Sit up, you!Give me your counsel and not your lectures, and you will live Whatever the reason, it's impossible for me to carry on the charade with these puppies.Perhaps for a few minutes at a time I can do it, or if there are other packs to keep them away from me, but none of this unending loving.Another hour of that and I I know I'll start killing them.So.I want you to talk with Amdijefri.Explain the 'situation'.Explain  "  "But  " The singleton was looking at him in astonishment."I'll be watching; I'm not giving up those two to your possession.Just handle the close diplomacy. "The Fragment drooped, the pain in its shoulders undisguised."If that is your wish, My Lord. "Steel showed all his teeth."It is indeed.Just remember, I'll be present for everything important, especially direct radio communication. "He waved the singleton off the parapet."Now go and cuddle up to the children; learn something of self control yourself. "After the Cloak was gone, he called Shreck up to the parapet.The next few hours were spent in touring the defenses and planning with his staff.Steel was very surprised how much clearing up the puppy problem improved his quality of mind.His advisors seemed to pick up on it, relaxed to the point of offering substantive suggestions.Where the breaches in the walls could not be repaired, they would build deadfalls.The cannon from the northern shops would arrive before the end of the dayaround, and one of Shreck's people had worked out an alternate plan for food and water resupply.Reports from the far scouts showed steady progress, a withering of the enemy's rear; they would lose most of their ammunition before they reached Starship Hill.Even now there was scarcely any shot falling on the hill.As the sun rose into the south, Steel was back on the parapets, scheming on just what to say to the Starfolk.This was almost like earlier days, when plans went well and success was wondrous yet achievable.And yet at the back of his mind all the hours since talking with the singleton, there had been the little claws of fear.Steel had the appearance of ruling.The Flenser Fragment gave the appearance of following.But even though it was spread across miles, the pack seemed more together than ever before.Oh, in earlier times, the Fragment often pretended equilibrium, but its internal tension always showed.Lately, it seemed self satisfied, almost smug.The Flenser Fragment was responsible for the Domain's forces south of Starship Hill, and after today  after Steel had forced the responsibility upon him  the Cloaks would be with Amdijefri every day.Never mind that the motivation had come from within Steel.Never mind that the Fragment was in an obvious state of agonized exhaustion.In its full genius, the Great One could have charmed a forest wolf into thinking Flenser its queen.And do I really know what he's saying to the packs beyond my hearing?Could my spies be feeding me lies about him?Now that he had a moment away from immediate concerns, these little claws dug deeper.I need him, yes.But the margin for error is smaller now.After a moment, he grated a happy chord, accepting the risk.If necessary, he would use what he had learned with the second set of cloaks, something he had artfully concealed from Flenser Tyrathect.If necessary, the Fragment would find that death can be radio swift.Even as he flew the velocity match, Pham was working the ultradrive.This would save them hours of fly back time, but it was a chancy game, one the ship had never been designed for.OOB bounced all around the solar system.One really lucky jump was all they needed.(And one really unlucky jump, into the planet, would kill them.A good reason why this game was not normally played. )After hours of hacking the flight automation, of playing ultradrive roulette, poor Pham's hands were faintly trembling.Whenever Tines' World came back into view  often no more than a far point of blue light  he would glare for a second at it.Ravna could see the doubts rising within him: His memories told him he should be good with low tech automation, yet some of the OOB primitives were almost impenetrable.Or maybe his memories of competence, of the Qeng Ho, were cheap fakes."The Blighter fleet.How long?"asked Pham.Greenstalk was watching the nav window from the Riders' cabin.It was the fifth time the question had been asked in the last hour, yet her voice came back calm and patient.Maybe the repeated questions even seemed a natural thing."Range forty nine light years.Estimated time of arrival forty eight hours.Seven more ships have dropped out. "Ravna could subtract: one hundred and fifty two were still coming.Blueshell's voder sounded over his mate's, "During the last two hundred seconds, they have made slightly better time than before, but I think that is local variance in Bottom conditions.Sir Pham, you are doing well, but I know my ship.We could get a little more time if you only you'd allow me control.Please  "  "Shut up. "Pham's voice was sharp, but the words were almost automatic.It was a conversation  or the abortion of one  that occurred almost as often as Pham's demand for status info on the Blighter fleet.In the early weeks of their journey, she had assumed that godshatter was somehow superhuman.Instead it was parts and pieces, automation loaded in a great panic.Maybe it was working right, or maybe it had run amok and was tearing Pham apart with its errors.The old cycle of fear and doubt was suddenly broken by soft blue light.Tines' World!At last, a wondrously accurate jump, almost as good as the shocker of five hours before: Twenty thousand kilometers away hung a vast narrow crescent, the edge of planetary daylight.The rest was a dark blot against the stars, except where the auroral ring hung a faint green glow around the south pole.Jefri Olsndot was on the other side of the world from them, in the arctic day.They wouldn't have radio communication until they arrived  and she hadn't figured out how to recalibrate the ultrawave for shortrange transmission.She turned back from the view.Pham still stared upward into the sky behind her.  "Pham, what good is forty eight hours?Will we just destroy the Countermeasure?"What of Jefri and Mr.Steel's folk?"Maybe.But there are other possibilities.There must be. "That last softly."I've been chased before.I've been in bigger jams before. "His eyes avoided hers.Jefri hadn't seen the sky for more than an hour in the last two days.He and Amdi were safe enough in the great stone dome that sheltered the refugee ship, but there was no way to see outside.If it weren't for Amdi, I couldn't have stood it a minute.In some ways it was worse even than his first days on Hidden Island.The ones who killed Mom and Dad and Johanna were just a few kilometers away.They captured some of Mr.Steel's guns and the last few days the explosions had gone on for hours, a booming that shook the ground beneath them and sometimes even smashed at the walls of the dome.Their food was brought in to them, and when they weren't sitting in the ship's command cabin, the two wandered outside the ship, to the rooms with the sleeping children.Jefri had kept up with the simple maintenance procedures he remembered, but looking through the chill transp of the coldsleep coffins, he was terribly afraid.Some of them weren't breathing very much.The inside temperature seemed too high.And he and Amdi didn't know how to help.Nothing had changed here, but now there was joy.Ravna's long silence had ended.Amdijefri and Mr.Steel had actually talked to her in voice!Three more hours and her ship would be here!Even the bombardment had ended, almost as if Woodcarver realized that her time was near to ending.Three more hours.Left to himself, Jefri would have spent the time in a state of wall climbing anxiety.After all, he was nine years old now, a grown up with grown up problems.But then there was Amdi.The pack was much smarter than Jefri in some ways, but he was such a little kid  about five years old, as near as Amdijefri could figure it.Except when he was into heavy thinking, he could not stay still.After the call from Ravna, Jefri wanted to sit down for serious worrying, but Amdi began chasing himself around the pylons.He shouted back and forth in Jefri's voice and Ravna's, and bumped into the boy accidentally on purpose.Jefri hopped up and glared at the careening puppies.Just a little kid.And suddenly, happy and so sad all at once: Is this how Johanna saw me?And so he had responsibilities now too.Like being patient.As one of Amdi came rushing past his knees, Jefri swept down to grab the wriggling form.He raised it to shoulder level as the rest of the pack converged gleefully, pounding on him from all directions.They fell to the dry moss and wrestled for a few seconds."Let's explore, let's explore!""We have to be here for Ravna and Mr.Steel. ""Don't worry.We'll remember when. ""Okay. "Where was there really to go?The two walked through the torchlit dimness to the clerestory that ringed the inner edge of the dome.As far as Jefri could see, they were alone.That was not unusual.Mr.Steel was very worried that Woodcarver spies might get into the ship.Even his own soldiers rarely came here.Amdijefri had investigated the inside wall before.Behind the quilts, the stone felt cool and damp.There were some holes to the outside  for ventilation  but they were almost ten meters up where the wall was already curving inwards toward the apex of the dome.The stone was rough cut, not yet polished.Mr.Steel's workers had been in a frantic hurry to complete the protection before Woodcarver's army arrived.Nothing was polished, and the quilts were undecorated.Ahead and behind him, Amdi was sniffing at the cracks and fresh mortar.The one in Jefri's arms gave a concerted wiggle."Ha!Up ahead.I knew that mortar was coming loose," the pack said.Jefri let all of his friend rush forward to a nook in the wall.It didn't look any different than before, but Amdi was scratching with five pairs of paws."Even if you can get it loose, what good does it do you?"Jefri had seen these blocks as they were lowered into place.They were almost fifty centimeters across, laid in alternating rows.Getting past one would just bring them to more stone."Heh heh, I don't know.I've been saving this up till we had some time to kill Yech.This mortar burns my lips. "More scratching, and the pack passed back a fragment as big as Jefri's head.There really was a hole between the blocks, and it was big enough for Amdi.One of him darted into the tiny cave."Satisfied?"Jefri plunked himself down by the hole and tried to look in."Guess what!"Amdi's shrill came from a member right by his ear."There's a tunnel back here, not just another layer of stone!"A member wriggled past Jefri and disappeared into the dark.Secret tunnels?That was too much like a Nyjoran fairy tale."These are big enough for a full grown member, Jefri.You could get through these on hands 'n' knees. "Two more of Amdi disappeared into the hole.The tunnel he had discovered might be large enough for a human child, but the entrance hole was a tight fit even for the puppies.Jefri had nothing to do but stare into the darkness.The parts of Amdi that remained at the entrance talked about what he had found.  "Goes on for a long, long way.I've doubled back a couple of times.The top of me is about five meters up, way over your head.This is kooky.I'm getting all strung out. "Amdi sounded even sillier than his normal playfulness.Two more of him went into the hole.This was developing into serious adventure  that Jefri could have no part of."Don't go too far; it might be dangerous. "One of the pair that remained looked up at him."Don't worry.Don't worry.The tunnel isn't an accident.It feels like it was cut as grooves in the stones when they were laid.This is some special escape route Mister Steel made.I'm all right.I'm all right.Ha ha, hoohooo. "One more disappeared into the hole.After a moment the last remaining one ran in, but stayed near enough to the entrance so Amdi could still talk to Jefri.The pack was having a high old time, singing and screeching to itself.Jefri knew exactly what the other was up to; it was another of the games he could never play.In this posture, Amdi's thoughts would be the weirdest rippling things.Darn.Now that he was playing within stone, it must be even neater than before, since he was totally cut off from all thoughts except from member to adjacent member.The stupid singing went on a little longer, and then Amdi spoke in an almost reasonable tone."Hei, this tunnel actually splits off in places.The front of me has come to a fork.One side is heading down Wish I had enough members to go both ways!""Well, you don't!""Hei ho, I'll take the upper tunnel today. "A few seconds of silence."There's a little door here!Like a member size room door.Not locked. "Amdi relayed the sounds of stone scritching against stone."Ha!I can see light!Up just a few more meters, it opens onto a window.Hear the wind. "He relayed wind sound and the keening of the sea birds that soared up from Hidden Island.It sounded wonderful."Oh oh, this is stretching things, but I wanna look out Jefri, I can see the sun!I'm outdoors, sitting way up on the side of the dome.I can see all round to the south.Boy, it's smoky down there. ""What about the hillside?"Jefri asked the nearest member; its white splotched pelt was barely visible through the entrance hole.At least Amdi was staying in touch."A little browner than last tenday.I don't see any soldiers out there. "Relayed sound of a cannon firing."Yipes.We're shooting though It hit just on this side of the crest.There's someone out there, just below my line of sight. "Woodcarver, come at last.Jefri shivered, angry that he couldn't see, frightened of what might be seen.He often had nightmares about what Woodcarver must truly be, how she had done it to Mom and Dad and Johanna.Images never fully formed yet almost memories.Mister Steel will get Woodcarver."Oh, oh.Old Tyrathect is coming across the castle yard this way. "Thumping sounds came from the hole as Amdi blundered back down.No point in letting Tyrathect know that there was a tunnel hidden in the wall.He'd probably just order them to stay away from it.One, two, three, four  half of Amdi popped out of the wall.The four wandered around a little dazedly.Jefri couldn't tell if it was because of their stretched out experience or if they were temporarily split from the other half of the pack."Act natural.Act natural. "Then the other four arrived, and Amdi began to settle down.He led Jefri away from the wall at a fast trot."Let's get the commset.We'll pretend we've been trying to raise Ravna with it. "Amdi knew well that the starship couldn't be back for another thirty minutes or so.In fact, he had been the one who verified the math for Mister Steel.Nevertheless, he chased up the ship's steps and dragged down the radio.The two were already plugging the antenna into a signal booster when the public doors on the west side of the dome were unlatched.Silhouetted against the daylight were parts of a guard pack, and a single member of Tyrathect.The guard retired, sliding the doors shut, and the Cloak walked slowly across the moss towards them.Amdi rushed over and chattered about their attempts to use the radio.It was a little forced, Jefri thought.The puppies were still confused by their trip through the walls.The singleton looked at the powdering of mortar dust on Amdi's pelt."You've been climbing in the walls, haven't you?""What?"Amdi looked himself over, noticed the dust.Usually he was more clever."Yes," he said shamefacedly.He brushed the powder away."You won't tell, will you?"Fat chance he'll help us, thought Jefri.Mr.Tyrathect had learned Samnorsk even better than Mr.Steel, and besides Steel was the only one who had much time to talk with them.But even before the radio cloaks, he'd been a short tempered, bossy sort.Jefri had had baby sitters like him.Tyrathect was nice up to a point, and then would get sarcastic or say something mean.Lately that had improved, but Jefri still didn't like him much.But Mr.Tyrathect didn't say anything right away.He sat down slowly, as if his rump hurt.  "No, I won't tell. "Jefri exchanged a surprised glance with one of Amdi."What is the tunnel for?"he asked timidly."All castles have hidden tunnels, especially in my in the domain of Mr.Steel.You want ways to escape, ways to spy on your enemies. "The singleton shook its head."Never mind.Is your radio properly receiving, Amdijefri?"Amdi cocked a head at the comm's display."I think so, but there's nothing yet to receive.See, Ravna's ship had to decelerate and um, I could show you the arithmetic?"But Mr.Tyrathect was obviously not interested in playing with chalk boards.  "well, depending on their luck with the ultradrive, we should have radio with them real soon. "But the little window on the comm showed no incoming signal.They watched it for several minutes.Mr.Tyrathect lowered his muzzle and seemed to sleep.Every few seconds his body twitched as with a dream.Jefri wondered what the rest of him was doing.Then the comm window was glowing green.There was a garble of sound as it tried to sort signal from background noise.  "over you in five minutes," came Ravna's voice."Jefri?Are you listening?""Yes!We're here. ""Let me talk to Mr.Steel, please. "Mr.Tyrathect stepped nearer to the comm."He is not here now, Ravna. ""Who is this?"Tyrathect's laugh was a giggle; he had never heard any other kind."I?"He made the Tinish chord that sounded like "Tyrathect" to Jefri."Or do you mean a taken name, like Steel?I don't know the exact word.You may call me   Mr.Skinner. "Tyrathect laughed again."For now, I can speak for Steel. ""Jefri, are you all right?""Yes, yes.Listen to Mr.Skinner. "What a strange name.The sounds from the comm became muffled.There was a male voice, arguing.Then Ravna was back, her voice kind of tight, like Mom when she was mad."Jefri what's the volume of a ball ten centimeters across?"Amdi had been fidgeting impatiently through the conversation.All through the last year he had been hearing stories of humans from Jefri, and dreaming what Ravna might really be like.Now he had a chance to show off.He jumped for the comm, and grinned at Jefri."That's easy, Ravna. "His voice was perfect Jefri  and completely fluent."It's 523.598 cubic centimeters or do you want more digits?"Muffled conversation."No, that's fine.Okay, Mr.Skinner.We have pictures from our earlier pass and a general radio fix.Where exactly are you?""Under the castle dome at top of Starship Hill.It's right at the coast by a  "  A man's voice cut in.Pham?He had a funny accent."I got it on the map.We still can't see you direct.Too much haze. ""That's smoke," said the Cloak."The enemy is almost upon us from the south.We need your help immediately  " The singleton lowered its head from the commset.Its eyes closed and opened a couple of times.Thinking?"Hmm, yes.Without your help, we and Jefri and this ship are lost.Please land within the castle courtyard.You know we've specially reinforced it for your arrival.Once down we can use your weapons to  "  "No way," the guy replied immediately."Just separate the friendlies from the bad guys and let us take care of things. "Tyrathect's voice took on a wheedling tone, like a little kid complaining.He really has been studying us."No, no, didn't mean to be impolite.Certainly, do it your own way.About the enemy force: everyone close to the castle on the south side of the hill are enemy.A single pass with your ship's um, torch would send them running. ""I can't fly that torch inside an atmosphere.Did your Pop really land with the main jet, Jefri?No agrav?""Yes, sir.All we had was the jet. ""He was a lucky genius. "Ravna: "Maybe we could just float across, a few thousand meters up.That might scare them away. "Tyrathect began, "Yes, that might  "  The public doors on the north side of the dome slid open.Mr.Steel stood silhouetted against the daylight beyond."Let me talk to them," he said.The goal of all their voyaging lay just twenty kilometers below OOB.They were so close, yet those twenty thousand meters might be as hard to bridge as the twenty thousand light years they had come so far.They floated on agrav directly over "Starship Hill".OOB's multispectral wasn't working very well, but where smoke did not obscure, the ship's optics could count the needles on the trees below.Ravna could see the forces of "Woodcarver" ranged across the slopes south of the castle.There were other troops, and apparently cannon, hidden in the forests that lined the fjord south of that.Given a little more time they would be able to locate them too.Time was the one thing they did not have.Time and trust."Forty eight hours, Pham.Then the fleet will be here, all around us. "Maybe, maybe godshatter could work a miracle; they'd never know stewing about it up here.Try: "You've got to trust somebody, Pham. "Pham glared back at her, and for an instant she feared he might go completely to pieces."You'd land in the middle of that castle?Medieval villains are just as smart as any you've seen in the Beyond, Rav.They could teach the Butterflies a thing or two.An arrow in the head will kill you as sure as an antimatter bomb. "More fake memories?But Pham was right on this: She thought about the just concluded conversation.The second pack  Steel  had been a bit too insistent.He had been good to Jefri, but he was clearly desperate.And she believed him when he said that a high fly by wouldn't scare the Woodcarvers off.They needed to come down near the ground with firepower.Just now, about all the firepower they had was Pham's beam gun."Okay, then!Do what you and Steel talked about.Fly the lander past Woodcarver's lines, laser blast them. ""God damn it, you know I can't fly that.The landing boat is like nothing either of us know, and without the automation I  "  Softly: "Without the automation, you need Blueshell, Pham. "There was horror on Pham's face.She reached out to him.He was silent for a long moment, not seeming to notice."Yeah. "His voice was low, strangled.Then: "Blueshell!Get up here. "OOB's lander had more than enough room for the Skroderider and Pham Nuwen.The craft had been built specifically for Rider use.With higher automation working, it would have been easy for Pham  for even a child  to fly.Now, the craft could not provide stable flight, and the "manual" controls were something that gave even Blueshell a hard time.Damn automation.Damn optimization.For most of his adult life Pham had lived in the Slowness.All those decades, he had managed spacecraft and weapons that could have reduced the feudal empire below to slag.Yet now, with equipment that should have been enormously more powerful, he couldn't even fly a damn landing boat.Across the crew compartment, Blueshell was at the pilot's position.His fronds stretched across a web of supports and controls.He had turned off all display automation; only the main window was alive, a natural view from the boat's bow camera.OOB floated some hundred meters ahead, drifting up and out of view as their craft slid backwards and down.Blueshell's fidgety nervousness  furtiveness, it seemed to Pham  had disappeared as he got into piloting the craft.His voder voice became terse and preoccupied, and the edges of his fronds writhed across the controls, an exercise that would have been impossible to Pham even if he had a lifetime of experience with the gear."Thank you, Sir Pham I'll prove you can trust" The nose lurched downwards and they were staring almost straight into the fjord carven coastline twenty kilometers below.They fell free for half a minute while the rider's fronds writhed on their supports.Hot piloting?No: "Sorry, sorry. "Acceleration, and Pham sank into his restraints under a grav load that wobbled between a tenth gee and an intolerable crush.The landscape rotated and they had a brief glimpse of OOB, now like a tiny moth above them."Is it necessary to kill, Sir Pham?Perhaps simply our appearance over the battle"  Nuwen gritted his teeth."Just get us down. "The Steel creature had been adamant that they fry the entire hillside.Despite all Pham's suspicions, the pack might be right on that.They were up against a crew of murderers that had not hesitated to ambush a starship; the Woodcarvers needed a real demonstration.Their boat fluttered down the kilometers.Steel's fortifications were clearly visible even in the natural view: the rough polygon that guarded the refugee ship, the much larger structure that rambled across an island several kilometers westward.I wonder if this is how my Father's castle looked to the Qeng Ho landers?Those walls were high and unsloping.Clearly the Tines had had no idea of gunpowder till Ravna had clued them to it.The valley south of the castle was a blot of dark smoke smoothly streaming toward the sea.Even without data enhancement, he could see hot spots, fringes of orange edging the black."You're at two thousand meters," came Ravna's voice."Jefri says he can see you. ""Patch me through to them. ""I will try, Sir Pham. "Blueshell fiddled, his lack of attention spinning the boat through a complete loop.Pham had seen falling leaves with more control.A child's piping voice: "A are you okay?Don't crash!"And then the Steel pack's hybrid of Ravna and the kid: "South to go!South to go!Use fire gun.Burn them quick. "Blueshell was entirely too cooperative to this direction.He had them down in the smoke already.For seconds they were flying blind.A break in the smoke showed the hillside less than two hundred meters off, coming up fast.Before Pham could curse at Blueshell, the Rider had turned them around and floated the boat into clearer air.Then he pitched over so they might see directly down.After thirty weeks of talk and planning, Pham had his first glimpse of the Tines.Even from here, it was obvious they were different from any sophonts Pham had encountered: Clusters of four or five or six members hung together so close they seemed a single spiderlike being.And each pack stood separated from the others by ten or fifteen meters.A cannon flashed in the murk.The pack crewing it moved like a single, coordinated hand to rock the barrel back and ram another charge down the muzzle."But if these are the enemy, Sir Pham, where did they get the guns?""They stole 'em. "But muzzle loaders?He didn't have time to pursue the thought."You're right over them, Pham!I can see you in and out of the smoke.You're drifting south at fifteen meters per second, losing altitude. "It was the kid, speaking with his usual incredible precision."Kill them!Kill them!"Pham wriggled out of his restraints and crawled back to the hatch where they had mounted his beam gun.It was about the only thing salvaged from the workshop fire, but by God this was something he could operate."Keep us steady, Blueshell.Bounce me around and I'll fry you as likely as anything!"He pushed open the hatch, and gagged on spicy smoke.Then Blueshell's agravs wafted them into a clear space and Pham lined the beamer down the ranks of packfolk.Originally Woodcarver had demanded Johanna stay at the base camp.Johanna's response had been explosive.Even now the girl was a little surprised at herself.Not since the first days on Tines world had she come so close to attacking a pack.No way was anyone going to keep her from finding out about Jefri.In the end they had compromised: Johanna would accept Pilgrim as her guard.She could follow the army into the field, as long as she obeyed his direction.Johanna looked up through the drifting smoke.Damn.Pilgrim was always such a carefree joker.By his own telling, he had gotten himself killed over and over again through the years.And now he wouldn't even let her up to Scrupilo's cannons.The two of them paced across a terrace in the hillside.The brush fire had swept through here hours before, and the spicy smell of moss ash was thick around them.And with that smell came the bright memory of horror, of a year ago, right here  Trusted guard packs paced their course twenty meters on either side.This area was supposedly safe from infiltration, and there had been no artillery fire from the Flenserists for hours.But Peregrine absolutely refused to let her get any closer.It's nothing like last year.Then all had been sunny blue skies and clean air  and her parents' murder.Now she and Pilgrim had returned, and the blue sky was yellow gray and the sweeps of mossy hillside were black.And now the packs around her were fighting with her.And now there was a chance  "Lemme closer, damn it!Woodcarver will have the Oliphaunt no matter what happens to me. "Peregrine shook himself, a Tinish negative.One of his puppies reached out from a jacket pouch to catch at her sleeve."A little longer," Pilgrim said for the tenth time."Wait for Woodcarver's messenger.Then we can  "  "I want to be up there!I'm the only one who knows the ship!"Jefri, Jefri.If only Vendacious was right about you  She was twisting about to slap at Scarbutt when it happened: A glare of heat on her back, and the smoke flashed bright.Again.Again.And then the impact of rapid thunder.Pilgrim shuddered against her."That's not gunfire!"he shouted."Two of me are almost blinded.C'mon. "He surrounded her, almost knocking her off her feet as he pushed/dragged her down the hill.For a second Johanna went along, more dazed than cooperative.Somehow they had lost their escort.From up the hill the shouts of battle had stopped.The sharp thunder had silenced all.Where the smoke thinned she could see one of Scrupilo's cannons, the barrel extending from a puddle of melted steel.The cannoneer had been blown to bits.Not gunfire.Johanna spasmed out of Pilgrim's grip.Not gunfire."Spacers!Pilgrim, that must be a drive torch. "Peregrine grabbed her, continuing down the hill."Not a drive torch!That I've heard.This is quieter  and somebody's aiming it. "There had been a long stutter of separate blasts.How many of Woodcarver's people had just died?"They must think we're attacking the ship, Pilgrim.If we don't do something, they'll wipe out everyone. "His jaws eased their grip on her sleeves and pants."What can we do?Hanging around here will just get us killed. "Johanna stared into the sky.No sign of fliers, but there was so much smoke.The sun was a dull bloody ball.If only the rescuers knew they were killing her friends.If only they could see.She dug her feet into the ground."Let go of me, Pilgrim!I'm going uphill, out of the smoke. "He'd stopped moving but his grip was fiercely tight.Four adult faces and two puppy ones looked up at her, and indecision was in every look."Please, Pilgrim.It's the only way. "Packs were straggling down, some bleeding, some in fragments.His frightened eyes stared at her an instant longer.Then he let go and touched her hand with a nose."I guess this hill will always be the death of me.First Scriber, now you  you're all crazy. "The old Pilgrim smile flickered across his members."Okay.Let's try it!"The two without puppies went up the hillside, scouting for the safest route.Johanna and the rest of him followed.They were moving across a sloping terrace.The summer drought had drained the chill swamp water she remembered from the landing, and the blackened moss was firm under her.The going should have been easy, but Peregrine wound through the deepest hummocks, hunkering down every few seconds to look in all directions.They reached the end of the terrace and began climbing.There were places so steep she had to grab the epaulet stirrups on two of Peregrine and let him hoist her up.They passed the nearest cannon, what was left of it.Johanna had never seen weapons fired except in stories, but the splash of metal and the carbonized flesh could only mean some kind of beam weapon.Running across the hill were similar craters, destruction punched into the already burned land.Johanna leaned against a smooth rounding of rock."Just pull over this one and we're on the next terrace," Pilgrim's voice came in her ear."Hurry, I hear shouting. "He leaned two of himself down, tilting his epaulets toward her hands.She grabbed them, and jumped.For a moment she and the pack teetered over a four meter fall, and then she was lying on brownish, unburned moss.Pilgrim clustered around her, hiding her.She peeked out between his legs.The outermost walls of Steel's castle were visible from here.Tinish archers stood boldly on the ramparts, taking advantage of the chaos among Woodcarver's troops.In fact, the Queen's force had not lost many packs in the air attack, but even the unwounded were milling around.The Queen's soldiers were no cowards  Johanna knew that by now  but they had just been confronted by force beyond all defense.Overhead the smoke faded into blue.The battlefield ahead of her lay under clear sky.In the years before the High Lab, Johanna and her mother had often gone on nature trips over Bigby Marsh at Straum.With the sensors on their camper packs they'd had no trouble watching the skyggwings there: even if this flier's automation was not specifically looking for a human on the ground, it should notice her."Do you see anything?"The four adult heads angled back and forth in coordinated pairs."No.The flier must be very far away or behind the smoke. "Nuts.Johanna came off her knees, trotted toward the castle walls.They must be watching there!"Woodcarver's not going to like this. "Two of the Queen's soldiers were already running toward them, attracted by their purposeful movement or the sight of Johanna.Pilgrim waved them back.Alone on an open field less than two hundred meters from the castle wall.Even with normal vision, how could they be overlooked?In fact, they were noticed: There was a soft hissing, and a meter long arrow thunked into the turf on their left.Scarbutt grabbed her shoulder, pulling her to a crouch.The puppies shifted his shields into position: Pilgrim made a barricade of himself on the castle side and started back out of range.Back into the smoke."No!Run parallel!I want to be seen. ""Okay, okay. "Soft sounds of death whispered down.Johanna kept one hand on his shoulder as they ran across the field.She felt Scarbutt falter.The arrow had caught him in the thick of his shoulder, centimeters from a tympanum."I'm okay!Stay down, stay down. "The front line of Woodcarver's force was rallying toward them now, a dozen packs racing across the terrace.Pilgrim bounced up and down, shouting with a voice that punched like physical force.Something about staying back, and danger from the sky.It didn't stop their advance."They want you away from the arrows. "And suddenly they noticed that the fire from the castle had stopped.Pilgrim scanned the sky, "It's back!Coming from the east, maybe a kilometer out. "She looked in the direction he was pointing.It was a lumpy thing, probably space based though it had no ultradrive spines.It bobbled and staggered.There was no sign of jets.Some kind of agrav?Nonhumans?The thoughts skittered through her mind, alongside the joy.Pale light flickered from a mast on its belly and dirt geysered around the troops who were racing to protect her.Again the stuttering thunder, only now the light was marching right across her friends toward her.Amdijefri was on the battlements.Steel hid his glares from the two.There simply was no help for it; Ravna had demanded Jefri be by the radio to guide the strike.The human was not completely stupid.It shouldn't make any difference.An army looks like an army whether it is foe or friend.Very soon the army beyond these walls would cease to exist."How did the first run go?"Ravna's voice came clearly from the commset.But it wasn't Jefri who answered: all eight of Amdiranifani was poking around the battlements, some of him sitting on the crenellations practicing stereo vision, others eyeing Steel and the radio.Telling him to stay back had no effect.Now Amdi answered the question with Jefri's voice."Okay.I counted fifteen pulses.Only ten hit anything.I bet I could shoot better than that. ""Damn it, that's the best I can do with this [unknown words]. "The voice was not Ravna's.Steel heard the irritation in it.Everybody can find something to hate in these pups.The thought warmed him."Please," said Steel."Fire again.Again. "He looked over the stonework.The air attack had taken out a band of enemy by the edge of the near terrace.It was spectacular destruction, like enormous cannon blows, or the separate landing of twenty starships.And all from a little craft that fluttered like a falling leaf.The enemy front line was dissolving in panic.Up and down the ramparts, his own troops danced about their stations.Things had been bleak since their cannon were knocked out; they needed something to cheer about."The archers, Shreck!Shoot upon the survivors. "Then, continuing in Samnorsk: "The front ranks are still coming.They are  they are  " Damn, what's the word for "confident"?"They will kill us without more help. "The human child looked at Steel in puzzlement.If he called that a lie, then A moment later Ravna said."I don't know.They're well back from your walls, at least all that I can see.I don't want to butcher" Rapid fire conversation with the human in the flier, perhaps not even in Samnorsk.The gunner did not sound pleased."Pham will pull back a few kilometers," she said."We can come back instantly if your enemy advances. ""Ssssst!"Shreck's Hightalk hiss was like a physical jab.Steel wheeled, glaring.How dare  But his lieutenant was wide eyed, pointing toward the center of the battlefield.Of course Steel had had a pair of eyes on that direction, but he hadn't been paying attention: The other Two Legs!The mantis figure dropped behind an accompanying pack, mercifully before Amdijefri noticed.Thank the Pack of Packs that puppies are near sighted.Steel swept forward, surrounding some of Amdi, shouting at the others to get off the parapet.Both of Tyrathect ran in close, physically grabbing for the disobedient wretches."Get below!"Steel screamed in Tinish.For a second all was confusion, as his own mind sounds mixed with the puppies'.Amdi tumbled away from him, thoroughly distracted by the noise and the rough handling.And then in Samnorsk Steel said, "There are more cannons out there.Get below before you're hurt!"Jefri started for the parapet."But I don't see  " And fortunately there was nothing special to see.Now.The other Two Legs was still crouched behind one of Woodcarver's packs.Shreck took the human child in paw and jaw.He and one of Tyrathect hustled the protesting children down the stairs.As they departed, Tyrathect was already embellishing on Steel's story, reporting on the troops it could see from below the crest of the hill."Blow up the lesser powder dump," Steel hissed at the departing Shreck.That dump was near empty, but its destruction might persuade the spacers where words could not.After they were gone, Steel stood for an instant, silent and shivering.He had never seen disaster so narrowly avoided.Along the ramparts, his archers were showering arrows upon the enemy pack and the Two Legs.Damn.They were almost out of range.In the castle yard, Shreck detonated the lesser dump.The explosion was a satisfying one, much louder than an artillery hit.One of the inner towers was blown apart.Flying rock showered the yard, the smallest pieces reaching all the way to where Steel stood on the ramparts.Ravna's voice was shouting in swift Samnorsk, too fast for Steel to understand.Now all the planning, all the hopes, all balanced on a knife edge.He must bet everything: Steel leaned a shoulder close to the comm and said, "Sorry.Things go fast here.Many more Woodcarver come up under smoke.Can you kill all on hillside?"Could the mantises see through smoke?That was part of the gamble.The gunner's voice came back, "I can try.Watch this. "A third voice, thready and narrow even by human standards: "It will be fifty seconds more, Sir Steel.We're having trouble turning. "Good.Concentrate on your flying and your killing.Don't look at your victims too carefully.The archers had driven the human back, part way under the cover of smoke.Other packs were rushing out to protect her.By the time the Visitors circled back, there would be lots of targets, the human lost among them.Two of him caught sight of the spacer floating down through the haze.The Visitors would have no clear view of what they were shooting at.Pale light flickered from beneath the craft.A scythe swept across the hillside toward Woodcarver's troops.Pham was bounced around his perch as Blueshell turned the boat back to the target.They weren't moving fast; the airstream couldn't have been more than thirty meters per second.But every second was full of the damnedest jerks and tumbles.At one point Pham's grip on the gun mount was all that kept him indoors.Forty some hours from now the deadliest thing in the universe is going to arrive, and I'm taking potshots at dogs.How to take out the hillside?Steel's whiny voice still echoed in his ears.And Ravna wasn't sure what OOB was seeing beneath all the smoke.We might do better without automation than with this bastard mix.At least his beamer had a manual control.Pham embraced the barrel with one arm while he reached with the other.At wide dispersion the beam was useless against armor, but could burst eyes and set skin and hair afire  and the beam width would be dozens of meters across at ground level."Fifteen seconds, Sir Pham," Blueshell's voice came in his ear.They were low this time.Gaps in the smoke flickered past like stop action art.Most of the ground was burned over black, but there were precipices of naked rock and even sooty patches of snow trapped in crannies and shadowed pits Here and there was a pile of doggy bodies, an occasional gun tube."There's a crowd of them ahead, Sir Pham.Running near the castle. "Pham leaned down and looked forward.The mob was about four hundred meters ahead.They were running parallel to the castle walls, through a field that was a spinehide of arrowshafts.He pressed the firing stud, swept the beam out from below the boat.There was plenty of water under that dried cover; it exploded in steam as the beam passed over it But further out, the wide dispersion wasn't doing much.It would be another few seconds before he'd have a good shot at the hapless packs.Time for the little suspicions.So how come the enemy had muzzle loading cannon?Those they must have made themselves  in a world with no evidence of firearms.Steel was the classic medieval manipulator; Pham had spotted the type from a thousand light years out.They were doing the critter's dirty work, that was obvious.Shut up.Deal with Steel later.Slanting in on the packs, Pham fired again, sweeping through living flesh this time.He fired ahead of them and on the castle side; maybe they wouldn't all die.He stuck his head further into the slipstream, trying for a better view.Ahead of the packs was a hundred meters of open field, a single pack of four and  a human figure, black haired and slim, jumping and waving.Pham smashed the barrel up against the hull, safing it at the same time.The back flash was a surge of heat that crisped his eyebrows."Blueshell!Get us down!Get us down!""A bad understanding.She was lied to. "Ravna tried to read something behind the voice.Steel's Samnorsk was as creaky as ever, the tones childish and whiny.He sounded no different than before.But his story was stretched very thin by what had just happened.He was either a galaxy master of impudence  or his story was actually true."The human must have been hurt, then lied to by Woodcarver.This explains a lot, Ravna.Without her, Woodcarver could not attack.Without her, all may be safe. "Pham's voice came to Ravna on a private channel."The girl was unconscious during part of the ambush, Rav.But she practically scratched my eyes out when I suggested she might be wrong about Steel and Woodcarver.And the pack with her is a lot more convincing than Steel. "Ravna looked questioningly across the deck at Greenstalk.Pham didn't know she was here.Tough.Greenstalk was an island of sanity amidst the madness  and she knew the OOB infinitely better than Ravna.Steel spoke into her hesitation: "See now, nothing has changed, except for the better.One more human lives.How can you doubt us?Speak to Jefri; he understands.We have done the best for the children in" a gobbling noise, and (another?)voice said, "coldsleep. ""Certainly, we must speak to him again, Steel.He's our best proof of your good intentions. ""Okay.In a few minutes, Ravna.But see, he is also my good protection against treachery from you.I know how powerful you Visitors are.I fear you.We need to  " gobbling consultation " accommodate each other in our fears. ""Um.We'll work something out.Just let us speak to Jefri now. ""Yes. "Ravna switched channels."What do you think, Pham?""There's no question in my mind.This Johanna is not a naive kid like Jefri.We've always known Steel was a tough critter.We just had some other facts wrong.The landing site is in the middle of his territory.He's the killer. "Pham's voice became quieter, almost a whisper."Hell of it is, this may not change anything.Steel does have the ship.I've got to get in there. ""It will be another ambush. "" I know.But does it matter?If we can get me time with the Countermeasure, it could be  it will be  worth it. "What matter a suicide mission within a suicide mission?"I'm not sure, Pham.If we give him everything, he'll kill us before we ever get near the ship. ""He'll try.Look, just keep him talking.Maybe we can get a directional on his radio, blow the bastard away. "He did not sound optimistic.Tyrathect didn't take them back to the ship, or to their rooms.They descended stairs within the outer walls, part of Amdi first, then Jefri with the rest of Amdi, then the singleton from Tyrathect.Amdi was still complaining."I don't understand, I don't understand.We can help. "Jefri: "I didn't see any enemy cannons. "The singleton was full of explanations, though it sounded even more preoccupied than usual."I saw them from one of my other members, out in the valley.We're pulling in all our soldiers.We must make a stand, or none of us will be alive to be rescued.For now, this is the best place for you to be. ""How do you know?"said Jefri."Can you talk to Steel right now?""Yes, one of me is still up there with him. ""Well, tell him we have to help.We can talk better Samnorsk even than you. ""I'll tell him right now," was the Cloak's quick reply.There were no more window slots cut in the walls.The only light came from wick torches set every ten meters along the tunnel.The air was cool and musty; wetness glistened on unquilted stone.The tiny doors were not of polished wood.Instead there were bars, and darkness beyond.Where are we going?Jefri was suddenly reminded of the dungeons in stories, the treachery that befell the Greater Two and the Countess of the Lake.Amdi didn't seem to feel it.For all his mischievous nature, Puppies was basically trusting; he had always depended on Mr.Steel.But Jefri's parents had never acted quite like this, even during the escape from High Lab.Mr.Steel suddenly seemed so different, as if he couldn't be bothered pretending to be nice anymore.And Jefri had never really trusted the sullen Tyrathect; now that one was acting downright sneaky.There had been no new threat on the hillside.Fear and stubbornness and suspicion all came together: Jefri spun around, confronting the Cloak."We're not going any farther.This isn't where we're supposed to go.We want to talk to Ravna and Mr.Steel. "A sudden, liberating realization: "And you're not big enough to stop us!"The singleton backed up abruptly, then sat down.It lowered its head, blinked."So you don't trust me?You are right not to.There is no one here but yourselves that you can trust. "Its gaze drifted from Jefri to the ranks of Amdi, and then down the hall."Steel doesn't know I've brought you here. "The confession was so quick, so easily made.Jefri swallowed hard."You brought us down here to k kill us. "All of Amdi was staring at him and Tyrathect, every eye wide with shock.The singleton bobbed its head in part of a smile."You think I am traitor?After all this time, some healthy suspicion.I am proud of you. "Mr.Tyrathect continued smoothly, "You are surrounded by traitors, Amdijefri.But I am not one of them.I am here to help you. ""I know that. "Amdi reached forward to touch a muzzle to the singleton's."You're no traitor.You're the only person besides Jefri that I can touch.We've always wanted to like you, but  "  "Ah, but you should be suspicious.You will all die if you aren't. "Tyrathect looked over the puppies, at the frowning Jefri."Your sister is alive, Jefri.She's out there now, and Steel has known all along.He killed your parents; he did almost everything he said Woodcarver did. "Amdi backed away, shaking himself in frightened negations."You don't believe me?That's funny.Once upon a time I was such a good liar; I could talk the fish right into my mouths.But now, when only the truth will work, I can't convince you Listen:"  Suddenly it was Steel's human speaking voice that came from the singleton, Steel talking with Ravna about Johanna being alive, excusing the attack he had just ordered on her.Johanna.Jefri rushed forward, fell on his knees before the Cloak.Almost without thought, he grabbed the singleton by the throat, shaking it.Teeth snapped at his hands as the other tried to shake free.Amdi rushed forward and pulled hard on his sleeves.After a moment Jefri let go.Centimeters away from his face, the singleton peered back at him, the torchlight glinting in its dark eyes.Amdi was saying: "Human voices are easy to fake  "  The fragment was disdainful."Of course.And I'm not claiming that was a direct relay.What you heard is several minutes old.Here's what Steel and I are planning this very second. "His Samnorsk abruptly stopped, and the hallway was filled with the gobbling chords of Pack talk.Even after a year, Jefri could only extract vague sense from the conversation.It did sound like two packs.One of them wanted the other to do something, bring Amdijefri  that chord was clear  up.Amdiranifani went suddenly still, every member straining at the relayed sounds."Stop it!"he shrilled.And the hallway was as quiet as a tomb."Mr.Steel, oh Mr.Steel. "All of Amdi huddled against Jefri."He's talking about hurting you if Ravna doesn't obey.He wants to kill the Visitors when they land. "The wide eyes were ringed with tears."I don't understand. "Jefri jabbed a hand at the Cloak."Maybe he's faking that, too. ""I don't know.I could never fake two packs that well. "The tiny bodies shuddered against Jefri, and there was the sound of human weeping, the eerily familiar sound of a small child desolated "What are we going to do, Jefri?"But Jefri was silent, remembering and finally understanding, the first few minutes after Steel's troops had rescued  captured?him.Memories suppressed by later kindness crept out from the corners of his mind.Mom, Dad, Johanna.But Johanna still lived, just beyond these walls  "Jefri?""I don't know either.H hide maybe?"For a moment they just stared at each other.Finally the fragment spoke."You can do better than hide.You already know about the passages through these walls.If you know the entrance points  and I do  you can get to almost anywhere you want.You can even get outside. "Johanna.Amdi's crying stopped.Three of him watched Tyrathect front, aft, and sideways.The rest still clung to Jefri."We still don't trust you, Tyrathect," said Jefri."Good, good.I am a pack of various parts.Perhaps not entirely trustable. ""Show us all the holes. "Let us decide."There won't be time  "  "Okay, but start showing us.And while you do, keep relaying what Mr.Steel is saying. "The singleton bobbed its head, and the multiple streams of Pack talk resumed.The Cloak got painfully to its feet and led the two children down a side tunnel, one where the wick torches were mostly burned out.The loudest sound down here was the soft dripping of water.The place was less than a year old, yet  except for the jagged edges of the cut stone  it seemed ancient.Puppies was crying again.Jefri stroked the back of the one that clung to his shoulder, "Please Amdi, translate for me. "After a moment Amdi's voice came hesitantly in his ear."M Mr.Steel is asking again where we are.Tyrathect says we're trapped by a ceiling fall in the inner wing. "In fact, they had heard the masonry shift a few minutes before, but it sounded far away."Mr.Steel just sent the rest of Tyrathect to get Mr.Shreck and dig us out.Mr.Steel sounds so different. ""Maybe it's not really him," Jefri whispered back.Long silence."No.It's him.He just seems so angry, and he's using strange words. ""Big words?""No.Scary ones.About cutting and killing Ravna and you and me.He   he doesn't like us, Jefri. "The singleton stopped.They were beyond the last wall torch, and it was too dark to see anything but shadowy forms.He pointed to a spot on the wall.Amdi reached forward and pushed at the rock.All the while Mr.Tyrathect continued talking, reporting from the outside."Okay," said Amdi, "that opens.And it's big enough for you, Jefri.I think  "  Tyrathect's human voice said, "The Spacers are back.I can see their little boat I got away just in time.Steel is getting suspicious.A few more seconds and he will be searching everywhere. "Amdi looked into the dark hole."I say we go," he said softly, sadly."Yeah. "Jefri reached down to touch one of Amdi's shoulders.The member led him to a hole cut in sharp edged stone.If he scrunched his shoulders there would be enough room to crawl in.One of Amdi entered just ahead of him.The rest would follow."I hope it doesn't get any narrower than this. "Tyrathect: "It shouldn't.All these passages are designed for packs in light armor.The important thing: keep to upward curving passages.Keep moving and you'll eventually get outside.Pham's flying craft is less than, uh, five hundred meters from the walls.Jefri couldn't even look over his shoulder to talk to the Cloak."What if Mr.Steel chases us into the walls?"There was a brief silence."He probably won't do that, if he doesn't know where you entered.It would take too long to find you.But," the voice was suddenly gentler, "but there are openings on the top of the walls.In case enemy soldiers tried to sneak in from the outside, there has to be some way to kill them in the tunnels.He could pour oil down the tunnels. "The possibility did not frighten Jefri.At the moment it just sounded bizarre."We've got to hurry then. "Jefri scrabbled forward as the rest of Amdi crawled in behind him.He was already several meters deep in stone when he heard Amdi's voice back at the entrance, the last one to enter: "Will you be okay, Mr.Tyrathect?"Or is this all another lie?thought Jefri.The other's voice had its usual, cynical tone."I expect to land on my feet.Please do remember that I helped you. "And then the hatch was shut and they scrambled forward, into the dark.Negotiations, shit.It was obvious to Pham that Steel's idea of "mutually safe meeting" was a cover for mayhem.Even Ravna wasn't fooled by the pack's new proposals.At least it meant that Steel was ad libbing now  that he was beyond all the scripts and schemes.The trouble was, he still wasn't giving them any openings.Pham would have cheerfully died for a few undisturbed hours with the Countermeasure, but Steel's setup would have them dead before they ever saw the inside of the refugee ship."Keep moving around, Blueshell.I want Steel to have us weighing on his mind, without being a good target. "The Rider waved a frond in agreement and the boat bounced briefly up from the moss, drifted a hundred meters parallel to the castle walls, and descended again.They were in the no man's land between the forces of Woodcarver and Steel.Johanna Olsndot twisted around to look at him.The boat was a very crowded place now, Blueshell stretched across the Riderish controls at the bow, Pham and Johanna jammed into the seats behind him  and a pack called Pilgrim in every empty space in between."Even if you can locate the commset, don't fire.Jefri could be close by. "For twenty minutes Steel had been promising the momentary reappearance of Jefri Olsndot.Pham eyed her smudged face."Yeah, we won't fire unless we can see exactly what we'll hit. "The girl nodded shortly.She couldn't have been more than fourteen, but she was a good trooper.Half the people he had known in Qeng Ho would have been in limp hysterics after this pickup.And of the rest, few could have given a better status report than Johanna and her friend.He glanced at the pack.It would take a while to get used to these critters.At first he'd thought that two of the dogs were sprouting extra heads  then he noticed the small ones were just puppies carried in jacket pockets.The "Pilgrim" was all over the boat; just what part of him should he talk to?He picked the head that was looking in his direction."Any theories how to deal with Steel?"The pack's Samnorsk was better than Pham's: "Steel and Flenser are as tricky as anything I've seen in Johanna's dataset.And Flenser is cool. ""Flenser?Hadn't realized there was a person with that name There was a 'Mr.Skinner' we talked to.Some kind of assistant to Steel. ""Hmm.He's tricky enough to play flunky wish we could drop back and chat with Woodcarver about this. "The request was artfully contained in his intonation.Pham wondered briefly what percentage of Packfolk were so flexible.They might be one hell of a trading race if they ever reached space."Sorry, we don't have time for that.In fact, if we can't get in right away, we've lost everything.I just hope Steel doesn't guess that. "The heads subtly rearranged themselves.The biggest member, the one with a broken arrow shaft sticking up from its jacket, moved closer to the girl."Well, if Steel is in charge, there's a chance.He's very smart, but we think he runs amok when things get tough.Your finding Johanna has probably put him to chasing his tails.Keep him off balance, and you can expect some big mistakes. "Johanna spoke abruptly, "He might kill Jefri. "Or blow up the starship."Ravna, any luck with Steel?"Her voice came back over the comm: "No.The threats are a bit more transparent now, and his Samnorsk is getting harder to understand.He's trying to bring cannon in from north of the Castle; I don't think he knows how much I can see He still hasn't brought Jefri back to the radio. "The girl paled, but she didn't say anything.Her hand stole up to grasp one of Pilgrim's paws.Blueshell had been very quiet all through the rescue, first because he had his fronds full with flying, then because the girl and the Pack had so much to say.Pham had noticed that part of Pilgrim had been politely nosing around the Rider.Blueshell hadn't seemed upset by the attention; his race had plenty of experience with others.But now the Rider made a brap for attention, "Sir Pham, there is action in front of the castle. "Pilgrim was on it at almost the same instant, one head helping another look through a telescope."Yes.That's the main sally port that's coming open.But why would Steel send packs out now?Woodcarver will chew them up. "The enemy was indeed fielding infantry.The packs spewed out the wide hole in a headlong dash, much like troops of Pham's recollection.But once they cleared the entrance they broke of into clumps of four to six dogs each and spread across the castle perimeter.Pham leaned forward, trying to see as far along the walls as possible."Maybe not.These guys aren't advancing.They're staying in range of the archers on the walls. ""Yeah.But we still have cannons. "Pilgrim's perfect imitation of humanity broke for a second, and a Tinish chord filled the cockpit."Something is really strange.It's like they're trying to keep someone from getting out. ""Are there other entrances?""Probably.And lots of little tunnels, just one member wide. ""Ravna?""Steel's not talking at all now.He said something about traitors infifltrating the castle.Now all I'm getting is Tinish gobble. "From embrasure to embrasure along the battlements, Pham could see enemy soldiers moving above those on the ground.Something had upset the rats' nest.Johanna Olsndot was a vision of horrified concentration, her free hand gathered into a fist, her lips faintly trembling."All this time I thought he was dead.If they kill him now, I" Her voice suddenly scaled up: "What are they doing?"Cast iron kettles had been dragged to the top of the walls.Pham could guess.Siege fighting on Canberra had involved similar things.He looked at the girl, and kept his mouth shut.There's nothing we can do.The Pilgrim pack was not so kind  or not so patronizing: "It's oil, Johanna.They want to kill someone in the walls.But if he can get out Blueshell, I've read about loudspeakers.Can I use one?If Jefri is in the walls, Woodcarver can safely scrape Steel's troops off the field and battlements. "Pham opened his mouth to object, but the Rider had already opened a channel.Pilgrim's Tinish voice echoed across the hillside.Along the castle walls heads turned.To them, the voice must have sounded like a god's.The chords and trills continued a moment longer, then ceased.Ravna's voice was on the line an instant later, "Whatever you did just now, it pushed Steel over the edge.I can barely understand him; He seems to be describing how he'll torture Jefri if we don't pull the Woodcarvers back. "Pham grunted."Okay then.Get us in the air, Blueshell. "It felt good to kiss subtlety goodbye.Blueshell wobbled the boat aloft.They moved forward, scarcely faster than a man can run.Behind them more of Woodcarver's troops were coming over the military crest of the hill.Those fellows had been pulled well back after Pham's strafing run: things might be decided before they got to the castle But Woodcarver's reach was still long and deadly: splashes of smoke and fire appeared along the battlements, followed by sharp popping noises.Killing Jefri Olsndot was going to be a very expensive proposition for Steel."Can you use the beamer to clear Steel's troops away from the wall?"asked Johanna.Pham started to nod, then noticed what was happening by the castle."See the oil. "Dark pools were growing between the enemy packs and the walls they guarded.Until they knew where the kid was coming out, it would be best not to start fires.Pilgrim: "Oops. "Then he was shouting something more on the loudspeakers.Woodcarver's artillery ceased."Okay," said Pham, "for now, all eyes on the castle wall.Circle the perimeter, Blueshell.If we can see the kid before Steel's guys, we may have a chance. "Ravna: "They're spread evenly around every side except the North, Pham.I don't think Steel has any idea were the boy is. "When you challenge Heaven, the stakes are high.And I could have won.If he had not betrayed me, I could have won.But now the masks were down, and the enemy's brute physical power was all that counted.Steel brought himself down from the hysterical blackout of the last few minutes.If I can not have Heaven, at least I can still take them to Hell.Kill Amdijefri, destroy the ship the Visitors wanted so most of all, destroy his traitorous teacher."My lord?"It was Shreck.Steel turned a head in Shreck's direction.The time for hysteria was past."How goes the flooding?"he said mildly.He wouldn't ask about Tyrathect again."All but complete.The oil is pooling beyond the castle walls. "The two packs crouched as one of Woodcarver's bombs exploded just beyond the battlement.Her troops were already halfway back across the field  and Steel's archers were preoccupied with flooding the tunnels and watching the exits."We may have flushed out the traitors, my lord.Just before Woodcarver resumed fire, we heard something by the southeast wall.But I fear the spacers will see whatever we do there. "His heads bobbed spastically.Strange to see Shreck coming apart, Steel thought vaguely.Shreck's was the loyalty of clockwork, but now his orderly world was failing and there was nothing left to support him.The madness he was born from was all that was left.If Shreck was close to breaking, then the siege of Starship Hill was nearly at an end.Just a little longer, that is all I ask now.Steel forced a confident expression upon his members."I understand.You have done well, Shreck.We may still win.I know how these mantises think.If you can kill the child, especially before their eyes, it will break their spirit  just as puppies can be broken by the right terrors. ""Yes, sir. "There was dull incredulity in Shreck's eyes, but this would hold him, a plausible excuse to continue the charade."Light the oil beyond the walls.Move the troops in front of where you think Amdijefri will exit.The Visitors must see this if it is to have proper effect.And  " and blow up the refugee ship!The words almost slipped out, but he caught himself in time.The explosives built into the Jaws and the Starship dome would bring down everything interior to the outerwalls and would kill most of the packs within.Ordering Shreck do that would make Steel's real goal all too clear.  "And move quickly before Woodcarver's troops can close.This is the Movement's last hope, Shreck. "The pack bowed its way back down the steps.Steel maintained an expansive posture, boldly looking across the battlefield until the other was out of sight.Then he reached across the battlements and slammed the radio into the stone walkway.This one didn't break, and now the Ravna mantis's voice came querulously from it.Steel bounded down the stairs."You get nothing," he shrieked back at her in Tines' talk."Everything you want will die!"And then he was down the stairs and running across the courtyard.He ducked out of sight, into the hallway that circled the Jaws of Welcome.He could blow those easily, but very likely the main dome and the ship within would survive.No, he must go to the heart.Kill the ship and all the sleeping mantises.He stepped into a secret room, picked up two crossbows  and the extra radio cloak he had prepared.Inside that cloak was a small bomb.He had tested the idea with the second set of radios; the receiving pack had died instantly.Down another set of stairs, into a supply corridor.The sounds of battle were lost behind him.His own tines' clatter was the loudest noise.Around him loomed bins of gunpowder, food supplies, fresh timber.The fuses and set charges were only fifty yards further on.And Steel slowed to a walk, curled his paws so the metal on them made no noise.Listening.Looking in every direction.Somehow he knew the other would be here.The Flenser Fragment.Flenser had haunted him from the beginning of his existence, had haunted even after Flenser had mostly died.But not until this clear treason had Steel been able to free his hate.Most likely the Master thought to escape with the children, but there was a chance that Flenser schemed to win everything.There was a chance that he had returned.Steel knew his own death would come soon.And yet there might still be triumph.If, by his own jaws and claws, he could kill the Master Please, please be here, dear Master.Be here thinking you can trick me one more time.A wish granted.He heard faint mind sounds.Close.Heads rose from behind the bins above him.Two of the Fragment showed themselves in the corridor ahead."Student. ""Master. "Steel smiled.All five of the other were here; the Fragment had smuggled himself all back.But gone were the radio cloaks.The members stood naked, their pelts covered with oozing sores.The radio bomb would be useless.Perhaps it didn't matter; Steel had seen corpses that looked healthier than these.Out of sight, he raised his bows."I have come to kill you. "The death's heads shrugged."You have come to try. "Jaws on claws, Steel would have had no trouble killing the other.But the Fragment had positioned three of himself above, by cargo bins that looked strangely off balance.A straight forward rush could be fatal.But if he could get good bow shots Steel eased forward, to just short of where the cargo bins would fall."Do you really expect to live, Fragment?I am not your only enemy. "He waved a nose back up the corridor."There are thousands out there who hunger for your death. "The other bobbed its heads in a ghastly smile.New blood oozed from the wounds that were opened."Dear Steel, you never seem to understand.You have made it possible for me to survive.Don't you see?I have saved the children.Even now, I am preventing you from harming the starship.In the end this will win me a conditional surrender.I will be weak for a few years, but I will survive. "The old Flenser glittered through the pain and the wounds.The old opportunism."But you are a fragment.Three fifths of you is  "  "The little school teacher?"Flenser lowered his heads and blinked shyly."She was stronger than I expected.For a while she ruled this pack, but bit by bit I forced my way back.In the end, even without the others, I am whole. "Flenser whole once more.Steel edged back, almost in retreat.Yet there was something strange here.Yes, the Flenser was at peace with himself, self satisfied.But now that Steel could see the pack all together, he saw something in its body language that Insight came then, and with it a flash of intensest pride.For once in my life, I understand better than the Master."Whole, you say?Think.We both know how souls do battle within, the little rationalizations, the great unknowings.You think you've killed the other, but whence comes your recent confidence?What you're doing is exactly what Tyrathect would do now.All thought is yours now, but the foundation is her soul.And whatever you think, it's the little school teacher who won!"The Fragment hesitated, understanding.Its inattention lasted only a fraction of a second, but Steel was ready: He leaped into the open, loosing his arrows, lunging across the open space for the other's throats.Any time before now, the climb through the walls would have been fun.Even though it was pitch dark, Amdi was in front and behind him, and his noses gave him a good feel for the way.Anytime before now there would have been the thrill of discovery, of giggling at Amdi's strung out mental state.But now Amdi's confusion was simply scary.He kept bumping into Jefri's heels."I'm going as fast as I can. "The fabric of Jefri's pants' knees was already torn apart on the rough stone.He hustled faster, the stabbing beat of rock on knees barely penetrating his consciousness.He bumped into the puppy ahead of him.The puppy had stopped, seemed to be twisting sideways."There's a fork.I say we what should I say, Jefri?"Jefri rolled back, knocking his head on top of the wormhole.For most of a year, it had been Amdi's confidence, his cheeky cleverness, that had kept him going.Now suddenly he was aware of the tonnes of rock that were pressing in from all directions.If the tunnel narrowed just a few centimeters, they would be stuck here forever."Jefri?""I " Think!"Which side seems to be going up?""Just a second. "The lead member ran off a little ways down one fork."Don't go too far!"Jefri shouted."Don't worry.I he'll know to get back. "Then he heard the patter of return, and the lead member was touching its nose to his cheek."The one on the right goes up. "They hadn't gone more than fifteen meters before Amdi started hearing things."People chasing us?"asked Jefri."No.I'm mean, I'm not sure.Stop.Listen Hear that?Gluppy, syrupy. "Oil.No more stopping.Jefri moved faster than ever up the tunnel.His head bumped into the ceiling and he stumbled to his elbows, recovered without thinking and raced on.A trickle of blood dripped down his cheek.
