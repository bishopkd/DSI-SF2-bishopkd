He turned his head, as though listening.The dull ticking noise went on; steady, remorseless.That is a drop bomb chute, firing once a second.Only in this case it is firing people, not warheads.Unprotected human beings are being thrown into space towards your planet at a rate of over three thousand per hour.They are men, women and children, old and young adults, people from all walks of life, mostly captured from surrendered ships and damaged habitats.We have over twenty thousand of them aboard.They will continue to be fired at this rate until we make some sort of progress here.He waited for some sort of reaction from the three Dwellers, but they just kept on looking at the view.Now, he continued, do any of us here present think we might have just remembered anything useful?He watched the people and the aliens staring at the stippled line of black dots moving slowly away from the great ship.A few people turned to look at him, then looked away when he met their gaze, trying to hide hatred and fear and horror.Odd how people reacted so severely to something unpleasant happening right in front of them but were prepared to ignore much worse horrors taking place elsewhere.He nodded to Tuhluer, and a great screen lit up across one side of the chamber, showing the process.People  humans of all sorts, as hed said  were shown being loaded into a number of huge circular magazines.The humans were almost all struggling, but they were each constrained by a tight wrapping like an elastic sleeping bag which covered every bit of them except for their faces and prevented them from doing anything but squirm like maggots and spit at and try to bite the exoskel wearing soldiers loading them into the launcher magazines.The floor of the vast hold was covered in wriggling, struggling bodies.The sound turned up, and those present in the conference chamber could hear the humans screaming and crying and shouting and begging.Archimandrite!the Hierchon shouted.I have to protest at this!I didnt  Shut up!the Archimandrite bellowed at him.He looked round the others.All of you!Not a fucking word!For a while the only sound was the muffled thud, thud, thud of the launcher.The scene switched to the muzzle of the launcher on the exterior of the ship, firing  very gently, for a gun  the people into space.Their wrapping came off as they were expelled, snapping back around their ankles so that they could writhe and jerk and spasm satisfactorily as they met the vacuum naked, and suffocated.Some tried to hold their breaths, and bulged fit to explode.Blood specked from ears and eyes and mouths and anuses.The cameras followed them.The people usually moved for about a couple of minutes before they stopped.Then they just assumed the one frozen pose  some curled foetal, some spreadeagled  and tumbled slowly, part of an invisible conveyor belt, towards the faraway cloud tops.Exactly why are you doing this?the Dweller Feurish asked the Archimandrite.He sounded merely puzzled.To concentrate minds, Luseferous said coldly.He could hear somebody being sick in the chamber.Not many people were meeting his gaze.The gantries above were thick with immobile guards, weapons already trained on the people below.Well, my mind was perfectly concentrated, Feurish said, with what sounded like a sigh.We still cant help you.Give me Seer Fassin Taak, Luseferous said, feeling some sweat  what?start to break out on his forehead.He put a stop to that at once.We havent got this Taak fellow, the City Administrator Peripule said reasonably.Tell me where he is, Luseferous demanded.Sorry, Chintsion said.Cant help.Fucking tell me!Luseferous roared.How can we?Feurish began.Then Chintsion broke in.Perhaps we can ask the people who claim to have seen Seer Taak last where they think he might be.There were people from the Embassy who were reported to be looking for him, Feurish pointed out.Perhaps they found something.I thought they were all killed when the Embassy ships were destroyed, Chintsion said.Werent they?Look, Peripule said reasonably to the Archimandrite.Why dont we just sleep on it, eh?Luseferous pointed furiously at the line of bodies heading slowly towards the planet.Dont you fuckwits understand?That doesnt stop until I get what I want!The three Dwellers twisted to look as one.Hmm, Peripule said thoughtfully.I do hope you have enough people.Luseferouss fists clenched.He felt close to exploding, as though he was one of the people in the little production line of death sliding past the bowed diamond window.He struggled to keep his voice icily calm as he said, There are three hundred Dweller youngsters aboard this ship.Perhaps if we used them instead?Or for target practice.What do you think?I think youll annoy people, Chintsion said, and laughed.Youre not seriously trying to use threats against us, are you?Feurish asked.I had better point out, Mr Luseferous, Chintsion said with what sounded almost like humour, that some of the clubs I represent are of a military bent.Wonderfully enthusiastic, of course, proud to personify them, naturally, but sometimes  I dont know, perhaps through boredom  they display characteristics which might almost be said to be bordering on those one would expect to be evinced by fellows of a shoot first mentality.Ah.If you know what I mean.Luseferous stared at this cretinous float.The plodding, thud, thud, thud sound went on.The line of tiny dark shapes continued to move across the tortured, livid face of the gas giant.He turned to Tuhluer.Go to full action stations, he said.Dark the view.The vast face of Nasqueron disappeared as the diamond bubble went obsidian black.The whole great chamber grew still darker and seemed to shrink.The thudding noise sounded louder.You three are to be held hostage, Luseferous told the three Dwellers.As will the young of your kind currently aboard this ship.If there is any attempt to rescue you or them, or any assault on this ship or on any of my ships or assets, you will all be killed.If I dont get something provably useful on Seer Fassin Taak or whatever it was he was looking for in the next six hours standard, Im going to start killing you anyway, starting with you three.Understand?Really, Mr Luseferous, Feurish said, this is no way to run a conference.I have to say that I have to agree, Chintsion said.Shut up, Luseferous told them.I also have numerous ships with multi real tonne antimatter warheads stationed right round this gas giant.Planet busters.If theres still nothing happening after youre all dead, I start detonating them in your precious fucking atmosphere.What passes for the authorities on your giant rotten fart of a planet will be informed of the above in due course.The Archimandrite looked up at the guards poised on the gantries above.Take them away.Get them out of those esuits.By cutting if necessary.A dozen giant black figures like suits of ancient armour encrusted with huge dark jewels sailed down, landing on the black diamond film on great talon spread legs.Four surrounded each of the three esuited Dwellers.Well, gentlemen, the Dweller called Peripule said ruefully to the other two, I suppose it is not open to us to claim we went unwarned.An instant later, three violet circular curtains of light blazed out within the dark chamber, one encircling each Dweller.The exoskel guards were either rocked right back or physically blown over.Those unprotected people standing or sitting further away were picked up and thrown towards the walls.The shock wave hit Luseferouss tall seat a fraction after the safety shield deployed, so that he watched the resulting chaos through a clinker of half silvered diamond shutters.The blast shook his seat, shook him and then reflected and echoed back off the distant walls.The three violet cylinders disappeared and left three huge neatly circular holes in the black diamond film beneath.The sickly light of Nasquerons yellow brown cloud tops shone through.The air in the chamber was whirling and screaming out through the apertures.Blinks of white light flickered outside.Two of the exoskel guards were tumbled across the floor, scrabbling for grip, and were sucked out of the holes.Luseferous just stood staring.People, mostly unconscious and badly injured, started to slide in from the edges of the chamber where theyd been deposited by the triple blasts towards the three shining holes.A third exoskeleton clad figure was being pulled, giant hands scraping and scrabbling frantically at the smooth diamond surface, towards the nearest hole and the whirling vortex forming above it.Then the ships systems finally woke up to what was happening and a dark shape flicked across the three puncture wounds in the vessels skin, sealing off the light and keeping what remained of the atmosphere within.Relative calm returned.The thud, thud, thud noise continued.A rushing sound signalled replacement air being pumped back into the chamber.The exoskel guards got to their feet, looked around, then ran over to form a protective shield about the Archimandrite.More black shapes came plummeting from the gantries.Luseferous could hear people in the chamber moaning.He turned to look at Tuhluer, who was limping up to him through the phalanx of exoskel guards, his own emergency esuit and helmet deployed, the shiny bulge of faceplate reflecting the silvery diamond bubble that enclosed the Archimandrite and his chair.Kill the other Dwellers, Luseferous told him.Tuhluer leaned in, hand to the side of his head, seemingly not hearing.KILL THE OTHER DWELLERS!Luseferous shouted.He clicked a stud on the arm of the seat and the diamond shuttering fell away.Get us away from here, he told the other man.Warn the planet the AM warheads launch in three hours if they dont start cooperating.He looked at where the three Dweller representatives had made their sudden exit.And make sure the Rapacious wasted those three comedians.Sir!Tuhluer said.And what about the chute supply?It took a moment before Luseferous realised that he meant the people being launched towards the planet.He waved one hand.Oh, dump the lot.The Archimandrite Luseferous clicked the esuits communicator and told the Rapacious he was on his way.He marched through the moaning wounded towards the ship to ship and the waiting vessel beneath.The exoskel guards fell in around him, forming a giant hedge of armoured limbs and menacingly jagged torsos.He was almost at the ship to ship entrance when he was thrown off his feet.The exoskels staggered as the whole vast ship shook.One of the giant guards nearly fell on him, regaining his balance only at the last moment, servos whining.Now what?Luseferous demanded.Damage control here, sir, a voice said from the esuit.Energy bolt straight through the whole ship, dead amidships.About two metres diameter.Plus the bows have been shot off, back to about the eighty metre mark.Just gone.Same novel energy profile as the midships beam.Light speed; zero warning.Reactive defence systems still looking for a counter measure against any subsequent usage nothing coming up so far, sir.Comms, sir, another voice said, Dwellers, demanding return of their people aboard.Apparently those were just warning shots.Tuhluer came striding up.Luseferous looked at him.Hand the Dwellers back, he told the ADC.Then get this thing away from here.He strode towards the ship to ship.And the AM ships, sir?Leave them where they are.Delay the ultimatum until the Luseferous VII is clear.Sir.This time the Archimandrite made it all the way to the waiting flagship.An hour later the Luseferous VII was still making its lumbering, injured way out of the planets gravity well.The Rapacious was already half a million klicks away and still accelerating.The Archimandrite  still shaking with rage even in his acceleration couch, the full awfulness and sheer insult of what had happened at last sinking in, his patience finally exhausted (those three facetious shithead Dwellers had even escaped, esuits reflecting or deflecting everything the Rapacious had thrown at them after theyd exited the Luseferous VII, disappearing, apparently unharmed, into the cloud tops)  ordered that the ultimatum be made to the Dwellers immediately, and that one of the ships carrying an AM warhead should drop its weapon into the planets atmosphere, just to show that they were serious.The reply was almost instantaneous.The ship with the AM bomb  each one of the twenty ships with the AM bombs  vanished in a sudden pinpoint flare of light.All the warheads went off partially, reacting messily with the ordinary matter debris left after the destruction of the ships.Twenty ragged little suns guttered round Nasqueron like a tilted necklace, flaring, fading, flaring again and fading slowly once more.Moments later, a hyper velocity missile rose out of the turgid skies of the gas giant and found the Luseferous VII despite all its desperate countermeasures within two minutes of clearing the cloud tops.The radiation front tripped the Rapaciouss sensor buffers.That was how a proper antimatter warhead was supposed to work, seemed to be the implication.The last signal from the great ship before it was ripped entirely apart and turned into radiation and high speed shrapnel was from aide de camp Tuhluer, calmly informing Luseferous that the Archimandrite was a cunt.Fassin Taak looked up at the stars of home.He felt tears in his eyes, even within the shock gel.He rested on a windswept platform above a small cloud top city low in the south polar region, just a couple of thousand kilometres from the torn, fluid boundary with Nasquerons southernmost atmospheric belt.He tried to locate a friendly satellite, some signal that the little gascraft could recognise, but he couldnt find anything.All broadcast signals were either terribly weak or scrambled, and he couldnt locate any low orbit devices to bounce a hail off.He tried to lock on to one of the weak broadcast wavelengths and use the gascrafts biomind to decipher the signals, but the routines didnt seem to be working.He gave up.For the moment, he was content just to sit here and look out at the few, familiar stars.Despite Ysuls injuries, theyd still had to undergo an albeit slightly gentler form of the wild spiralling.Fassin had lain in the gascraft, feeling the series of nested corkscrewings and helixes build up like some coiling spring, thinking that this was them entering the wormhole, though in fact, as it turned out, theyd already been through it and this was the unwinding.Then, suddenly, they were here, back in Nasqueron, in the southern polar region, not the northern one theyd left from.Sinking down just a few kilometres through the cloud tops, the ex Voehn ship Protreptic had come to rest in a slightly too big cradle in an enormous, echoing cavern of a hangar here in the lower regions of the nearly deserted polar city of Quaibrai.The City Administrator and a crowd of several hundred Dwellers had met them, hooting and throwing streamers and scent grenades.A delegation comprising individuals from several different alien ship enthusiast clubs had become particularly excited when theyd seen the Voehn craft and had bobbed up and down with impatience as Ysul had been carefully offloaded and given into the care of a hospital squad.As soon as Ysul, Fassin and the truetwin Quercer Janath had exited, the chirping, sizzling mass of enthusiasts rushed aboard, jostling for position as theyd tried to fit down the corridors and access ways.The truetwin had, thoughtfully, expanded the ship from its needle ship portal piercing formation to a fatter and hence more commodious configuration, but it still looked like a tight squeeze.Ysul, already looking half mended, though still shaking off the grogginess of his semi coma, had twisted a fraction in his scoop stretcher to look at Fassin as the hospital squad brought their ambulance skiff down to him.See?hed croaked.Got you back safely, didnt I?Fassin had agreed that he had.Hed tried to pat Ysul but used the wrong manipulator and instead just jerked in mid gas.Hed swivelled and used the gascrafts other arm, clutching the wounded Dwellers hub hand.You off home now?Ysul had asked.However much of it is left.I dont know.I dont know what to do.Well, if you do go, come back soon.Ysul had paused and shaken himself, as though trying to wake up more fully.I should be ready to receive visitors again in a couple of dozen days or so and I anticipate a very full social calendar indeed thereafter.I fully intend to exploit my recent injuries and experiences without compunction and exaggerate outrageously my part in the taking of the Voehn ship, not to mention embellish my fight with the Voehn commander to the point of what will probably seem like complete unrecognisability, the first time you hear it.Id appreciate your corroboration, providing you are able to enter into the spirit of the thing and not insist on being overly encumbered by the vulgar exigencies of objective truth, whatever version of it you may think you recall.What do you say?My memorys kind of hazy, Fassin had told the Dweller.Ill probably back up anything you say.Splendid!If I can come back, I shall.Privately, he didnt even know if he could get away in the first place.He didnt know what sort of infrastructure remained to get him off the planet, get the gascraft repaired and return him  if whoever was in charge would let him return  nor whether the Dwellers would allow him to return.During the last part of the six hour journey from the worm hole, when Quercer Janath had allowed him to see where they were and let him access the local data carrying spectra, hed tapped into the Nasqueron news services to see what had been going on during his absence.The Dweller news was all about the war.The Formal War between Zone 2 and Belt C.  Apparently it had become deeply exciting and enthralling and was already being talked of in respected critical circles as a classic of the genre, even though it was probably barely halfway through yet and still, with any luck at all, had a great deal to offer.Fassin had to search out a specialist alien watcher service to find out that, starting about thirty plus days earlier, the Ulubis system had been invaded and taken over by the Epiphany 5 Discon or Starveling Cult forces under the leadership of the Archimandrite Luseferous.The last significant, organised Ulubine Mercatorial resistance had ended just a dozen or so days ago following the formal surrender by the Hierchon Ormilla after the destruction of a city on Sepekte and a habitat in orbit around it.A counter attack by several squadrons of the Summed Fleet was expected to commence within the next few dozen days or so.The latest was that a peace and cooperation conference was taking place about now in the Starveling ship Luseferous VII, in orbit about Nasqueron.Fassin had sent a message which would at least attempt to find Valseir.He would wait a bit and see if that raised a reply.Hed thought of contacting Setstyin, but then he remembered, vaguely, that somebody had said something to him that had made him uneasy about the Dweller.No, wait, it had been the other way round, hadnt it?Setstyin had always been a charming and helpful friend.Setstyin had warned him against the old Dweller whod been in charge of the great spherical thing that had risen out of the clouds and demolished the Mercatorias raiding force at the GasClipper regatta.Yes, that made more sense.He wondered why he couldnt remember in more detail.It was strange.Hed always had a really good memory.Quercer Janath seemed to be surrounded by well wishers wanting to know more about the Voehn craft.The truetwin Dweller had seen Fassin looking at them through the crowd, and waved.Fassin had waved back.Hed watched Ysul being placed into the ambulance skiff and tried to work out what he knew and didnt know, what he could and could not remember.He could have gone with Ysul in the ambulance, he supposed, but he felt a need to get away for a while, to be alone for a time.Hed come up here to see the stars, and wait, and think, and maybe do a bit of mathematical analysis.He took the little image leaf out of its locker in the gascrafts flank.He looked at it.Since whatever had happened aboard the Protreptic, the little gascraft couldnt see as well as it used to, but its close up detail vision was good enough on one side for the image of blue sky and white clouds to be perfectly clear.He zoomed in, rechecking the image he had stored in the The image wasnt there in the crafts memories.That was strange.He had the feeling that he had recorded the image and already half deciphered something that was hidden inside it.He was sure he had.It had seemed really important at the time, too, he was certain.Fassin tried really hard to think back to what had occurred after they were attacked by the Voehn ship.He knew theyd been captured and interrogated and the Voehn had messed around with his brain and with the gascrafts biomind and memories.Then a ship that the Ythyn had sent to rescue them had attacked the Voehn ship and  somehow  he and Ysul and the truetwin had overpowered the surviving Voehn crew.Theyd overpowered Voehn?How had that happened?The Ythyn ship had been able to distract the Voehn, and the Velpin had played a part too, some sort of anti piracy automatics kicking in and helping to take on the Voehn.Quercer Janath had been distinctly cagey about what sort of techniques their old ship had used against the Voehn.Fassin had no idea.Maybe it had happened the way they said, maybe not.Maybe the Velpin had had an AI aboard and that had wasted the Voehn, only Quercer Janath didnt want people to know about it.They could have told him practically anything and hed have believed them, the Voehn had messed with his memories so badly.He remembered sitting on the steps of a temple looking out over a wide, slow moving river, talking to an old man?An old Dweller?This was quite a vivid image, rather than a linear strand of memory.That had to have happened in some form of VR, didnt it?Maybe that old man had been the representation of the Velpins AI.Perhaps that was who or what he had been talking to, or at least met.He tried to concentrate, and looked down at the image leaf again.Hed been given this by Valseir.Was that right?It had been a sort of calling card, a letter of introduction, leading him to He seemed to feel it had led him to Valseir, but that didnt make sense.No, wait: the house in the depths, and the old wandering Dweller.Hed given him the image leaf.And it had led him, somehow, to Valseir.But there was something else.Hed discovered something else.Hed woken up thinking about this, before the wormhole transition.There was something hidden in the image leaf.A message, a code.Fassin looked round the empty platform.There was nobody else here.He let the little gascrafts image processors drink in the view shown on the image leaf in as much detail as it could offer.Various routines started running.In a few minutes, his gaze was torn away from the sparse but familiar looking starscape above.He looked at the results.There had been something in there.It looked like alien algebra.There was about a page and a half of it.It looked like one long equation, or maybe three or four shorter ones.He felt very excited.He wasnt entirely sure why, but he had an idea that this linked into the Dweller List.The details evaded him, but he knew that hed been looking for the Transform that was supposed to open up the famous List, and maybe  just possibly  this piece of alien mathematics had something to do with it.Maybe what he had before him here was the Transform, though that was a little difficult to believe.Fassin tried to figure out what the symbols in front of him might mean, but couldnt even get started.The gascrafts comprehensively mucked around memories might once have contained something which would have sent him in the right direction, but they didnt any more.He linked with the citys data nets, synched with an equatorial university library and looked up a data reservoir specialising in alien mathematics.He chose a couple of symbols at random and pinged them to the database.It answered immediately, with references.What he was looking at was expressed in Translatory V, a pan species, universal notation of just under two billion years age, devised by the long extinct Wopuld from earlier Dweller elements.He downloaded a full translation suite.He had to stop, and look out over the cloud tops.He was experiencing a strange mix of emotions.This might be the thing hed been sent to look for, the very object of his mission.Their mission, rather; he ought not to forget Colonel Hatherence.This could well be what hed been looking for, all that time.And yet, if the Mercatoria, or at least the Ulubine part of it, had hoped that this would save them, then it hadnt.Hed got back too late, and the invasion had already happened.It was all over.And there was so much he seemed to have forgotten!What had the Voehn done to him?Ysul had been badly injured but apart from the effects of his healing coma he seemed  and professed himself to be  fine, mentally.Quercer Janath didnt seem to have suffered at all.Maybe that was just luck, or something to do with being a truetwin  he didnt know.Still, there was this to be done, this deciphering.It might still lead to something momentous.The invasion might have already happened but the counter attack was still to take place, and anyway, there was his own take on the rights and wrongs of what was going on.He would still rather the Beyonders had the information, if there was any useful information to be had, in the equation.Something glinted in space just over the horizon to the west, way out across the cloud tops.A ship, perhaps.Fassin returned his attention to the equation and the alien translation suite.He applied one to the other.In the virtual space which the gascrafts crippled biomind projected into his own mind, the image split and a copy of the equation appeared alongside the original.He watched the symbols shuffle and change in the copy, turning into Dweller standard notation.The symbols on both copies of the equation flickered and highlighted, turned different colours and seemed to swell out and then lapse back in again amongst the rest as the equation worked itself out.It was truly an equation, too.Hed had some vague idea thanks to something that somebody had said that it might be a frequency and signal or something, but it wasnt that.Or if it was it was very oddly disguised.The last few terms flicked and flashed on both sides of the split image.The answer appeared right at the end, blinking slowly.It was a zero.He stared at it, at them.A zero in Dweller standard notation was a dot with a short line under it.In Translatory V, it was a diagonal slash.A dot with a short line under it winked at him from the copy of the equation.A diagonal slash lay at the end of the original, also slowly flashing.He tried again.Same result.He rechecked the image, pulled the hidden code out of it again, in case the processor systems had made a mistake the first time.There had been no mistake.The equation he came up with the second time was the same as the first.He ran that one as well, anyway.Zero.Fassin laughed.He could feel himself inside the shock gel nested within the little arrowhead craft, chest and belly shaking.He had a sudden, vivid image of standing on the rocky shore of a planet, waiting for something.He stopped laughing.Zero.So the final answer was nothing.Hed been sent to the far side of the galaxy, had the answer with him all the time anyway, and what it was, was Fuck all.But in maths.He started laughing again.Ah well.Another glint, out over the cloud tops again, nearly directly north, and high.A scatter of tiny lights lit up the sky just beneath whatever it was that had just reflected the light.A hint of violet.Then white.He watched the same region of space for a few moments, looking for more.Whatever it was, it had to be fairly far away.If it was the same thing that had glinted earlier near the horizon then it was something high over the equatorial zone, tens of kilo klicks out.Zero.Well, that was illuminating.Fassin wondered if there really was a true answer somewhere, if what hed found  what Valseir had stumbled onto and then what Fassin had unknowingly brought out with him after his long ago delve  was part of a whole suite of decoy answers.Was there just this one, or were there more?Was the myth of the Dweller Lists famous Transform footnoted with hundreds of false answers?Well, if it was, he wasnt going to go looking for them.Hed done his bit.Hed even, in a sense, accomplished his mission, when hed thought it was never going to happen.He was too late, and the result was a nonsense, a joke, almost an insult, but  by any given god you cared to name  hed done it.He ought to start thinking about how he was going to get off the planet, or at least get the information out there, just for forms sake.Share the indifferent news.Another couple of flashes from space, near where the first crop had shone.One tiny blink, one longer flare.A few moments later what looked like a ships drive lit up and floated away, gathering speed quickly.Fassin looked for evidence of any Shared Facility satellites, or indeed any Mercatorial hardware anywhere around Nasqueron.There didnt seem to be anything.Hed told Aun Liss hed try to ping a position between two Seer satellites, EQ4 and EQ5, but the satellites werent there any more.He wondered if he could work out where they would have been and so where the microsat that hed suggested the Beyonders position between the two might be.He looked inside the gascrafts memory, trying to find the sat schedules, dug them out, then fed in the local time and his current location.A position blinked on his field of vision, away across the cloud tops, a little off due north, some few kilo klicks beneath where the recent activity had been.In line of sight now.He decided to treat this piece of luck as a good omen, and sent a signal saying he was back, so that, if nothing else, hed have done what hed said he would do.He waited a while but there was no acknowledgement, let alone a reply.He hadnt really expected one.He wondered what was left of the Shrievalty Ocula, and whether he should even try to report to it.He needed to do some research into exactly how much had changed since the invasion, see whether he was listed as dead, and whether he was being looked for or not.Maybe people had forgotten about him in all the excitement.Fassin laughed again.Oh, if only.The whole E 5 Discon invasion, so theyd been told, was happening quite specifically because of the List and the Transform.If that was even partly, even slightly true, and his mission hadnt been hidden from the invaders, then they probably would be looking for him, and quite hard, too, given that they might not have much time before the Summed Fleet crashed the party.In a way the zero result equation was a relief.The information hed brought back was such that he didnt mind sharing it with anybody and everybody.If it had truly told the location of the wormhole portals it would have been the most crushingly awful burden he could have borne, an infinitely precious and probably infinitely deadly possession.He should be glad it was a joke.If it had been the useful truth, if it had been what they had all hoped it was going to be, then almost certainly no matter who he chose to tell would first torture him or at the very least tear his mind apart to make sure he was telling the truth, and then kill him to make sure he couldnt tell anybody else.Hed kind of hoped that the Beyonders might be more humane than that, but it was a big risk to take.Hed be better just broadcasting the result, then disappearing if he could.Maybe the Dwellers would let him stay.Valseir.If nothing else, he ought to let his Dweller friend know that the information theyd all been so concerned about in fact amounted to nothing more than a piddling little zero.Then there was the matter of telling Valseir that for this nothing, his friend and colleague Leisicrofe had killed himself.Not all good news hed arrive bearing, then.Fassin looked up the StormSailing news service.There were fewer regattas than usual, thanks to all the interest in the war, and a lot of sailors whod normally be on the GasClippers and StormJammers would be required to crew the Dreadnoughts and other combat craft, but there were still a dozen meetings going on at any one time throughout the planet.If he was going to go looking for Valseir at regattas, he might have a long search.He thought about contacting the City Administrator to arrange for transport  Ysul would most likely be transferred back home to Hauskip city in a day or two, and Fassin could probably just accompany the injured Dweller back there  then he wondered if he ought to be more careful.Nobody seemed to have paid him much attention at all when hed disembarked from the Protreptic, but that didnt mean his arrival hadnt been noticed by somebody.Were there any humans  other Seers or anybody else  present in Nasq.?Somebody  Valseir?Damn this suddenly failing memory  somebody had told him there were factions and differences of opinion within the Dwellers over the List and even the seemingly endemic, congenital disregard the Dwellers displayed towards the rest of the galaxys inhabitants.We are not a monoculture.That had been Valseir, hadnt it?Would any group of Dwellers wish him ill, or somehow be under the command of somebody who did?He called up the usually most reliable alien watching service and accessed the global map.It was, for the first time since hed been looking at it, completely clear.According to the display, there was not a single alien entity alive in Nasqueron.That appeared to include him, so his return hadnt been documented yet, at least not by the enthusiasts who ran this service.He was being called.Quercer Janath.He put the image leaf back in its flank locker.Fassin.Anywhere we can take you?Locally, hasten to add.Ship at our disposal.Favour owed.That sort of thing.I dont know, Fassin replied.Ive been thinking about that.Do you know any more about whats happening with the invasion and the Starveling Cult forces?Getting reports coming in just now that theres been some sort of breakdown at some conference.Firefight, bluntly.Id like to find my friend Valseir, Fassin said.Ive sent a call, but no answers come back.I thought I might find him at a    As he spoke, he thought suddenly of the RushWing Sheumerith, the Dwellers hanging trailed on long lines behind the great long flexible wing forever powering its way into the high skies of Nasqueron.The RushWing.That was the other place Valseir had said he might be found.Yes, he told the truetwin.I do know where you could take me.Be in atmosphere, you realise.Not that quick.Entirely used up our luck quotient bringing the ship into Nasq.unseen in the first place.Voehn ship, see.Nervous making sort of thing for a lot of people.Apparently.Thats fine, Fassin told them.They were scudding through the cloud stems under the topmost haze layer less than an hour later when the AM warheads went off.One was directly above them.Oh, wow!Look at our shadow!A minute later, what they would later discover had been the destruction of the great ship Luseferous VII cast part of a giant halo of light all over the western sky.Quercer Janath freely confessed to being terribly impressed.The Protreptic tore serenely on.* * *  The first twelve ships of the Summed Fleet streaked across the inner system of Ulubis at just a per cent below light speed.Kilometre long black minarets girdled by fast spinning sections loosing missile clusters, pack munitions, scatter mines, stealth drones and suicide launchers, they lanced across the whole system in less than four hours, Nasquerons orbit in less than one and Sepektes in fifteen minutes.Billions of kilometres behind them, on the same course and decelerating hard, lay the Mannlicher Carcano and the main body of the Summed Fleet.Taince Yarabokin floated in her pod.In the VR command space of the battleship, there was something approaching total silence as the entire command crew lay quietly listening to the sparse exchanges beaming back from the twelve advance units darting across the system dead ahead.Taince was amazed at how nervous she felt.She could feel her body trying to exhibit all the classic signs of the fight or flight response, and the pods bio systems doggedly countering each one.There was no doubt that this was an important mission.It would, arguably, be the most crucial one shed ever been a part of.She was of sufficiently senior rank to have been briefed at the start on the strategic momentousness of what they were being sent to do, but even so she was surprised how similar she felt now to the way shed felt on her first few combat missions.You never fully shook off the adrenalin rush no matter how many missions you undertook  the consensus was that the day you felt completely blase about a forthcoming engage ment was either the day you were going to die or the day you should resign your commission forthwith  but the way she felt now was worryingly similar to how shed felt before those early missions.Somewhere, her nervousness would be being noted, too.Even if a live human medical officer wasnt watching her life signs now, a program would be flagging her current state of anxiety as worth further investigation later.No privacy.Well, shed known that when she joined up.Taince took her mind away from these perplexing, almost embarrassing feelings and watched the data coming back from the lead ships.What happened now, what these twelve craft discovered or didnt discover as they crossed the system at accelerated particle speeds, would determine how the next part of her life was lived out.There had been some odd energy and drive signatures from the system over the last few days, though nothing as bizarre as the sudden commotion around Nasqueron a few days ago.Twenty plus antimatter explosions.All but one, it looked like, spread around the planet in a neat if wavy circle.Theyd detonated too far out to do any great damage to the gas giant itself or to its inhabitants, and the explosions had been very messy, almost as if they hadnt been functioning warheads detonating efficiently but rather twenty  very big  ships losing M\AM containment at exactly the same time.Then, a minute or two later, an even bigger AM burst less than a light second out from Nasqueron, with the profile of something the size of the behemoth ship theyd identified earlier getting thoroughly blasted.Then nothing, apart from the ambiguous maybe leaving indications.Because one plausible explanation that fitted most of the signs  no explanation anyone had come up with so far fitted all of them  was that the bad guys were pulling out.Nobody in fleet command really believed this was what could be happening  the Starveling Cult force had crossed decades of space to get to Ulubis: they wouldnt turn tail and face the equally long trek back after just a few weeks, would they?but it looked like one of the more likely explanations.The data about to arrive would decide it one way or the other.The battlecruiser 88, the advance squadrons flagship, collating the real time intelligence of the spearhead shaped force and signalling it back to the main fleet, reported three heavy craft within detection though not attack range of the first, point destroyer.It signalled two of the following cruisers to adjust their trajectories and prepare remote munitions, guided and dumb.Little comms bleed.Possibly this was just good discipline or marginally better tech than theyd anticipated.Flank cruisers and destroyers reported a few missile platforms, firing at them, futilely, given their speed.A lot of mines, well spread.Evidence of AM material still floating free near the planet Nasqueron, in a debris profile that fitted exactly twenty ships having blown up at the same time eight days earlier.One big debris field, still heading outwards from the gas giant, spreading, consistent with a very large ship having been destroyed.A few other small enemy ships showing, the closest responding to their passing, firing beam weapons.No hits.The destroyer Bofors passed within a kilo klick of a vessel of about the same size as it, identified it as a hostile before the other ship had even registered the craft hurtling past and hit and destroyed it with a high X ray laser from its phase modulation collar turret before the hostile had time to react.Halfway across the system now.Still just the three big targets.There should be hundreds.The four craft at the trailing end of the advance squadrons spear point had time to spare while they nudge deflected and picked off some of the targets that the point and mid body ships had identified.They turned long range sensors on the outer system and beyond, in the general direction of the E 5 Discon, getting a straight down look along that track which the main fleet had only ever been able to view at a ninety degree angle.Drive signatures.Hundreds of them.Most of a thousand ships, all heading for home, taking a slightly acutely angled route that had hidden their drives from the main body of the fleet for the last six or seven days.Half an hour later, it was like party time.The advance squadron was almost all the way through the system, braking hard to return in a few dozen days, and the small formations of ships between them and the main body of the fleet had been ordered to forget about follow up high speed passes and start decelerating at their individual safe maxima.All the signs were that the system was almost clear of enemy ships and the Starveling Cults main fleet was in high speed retreat back along roughly the course it had approached on.Even the three big targets were powering up now and heading in the same direction as the decamping invasion force.A few dozen smaller drives lit up as smaller, lighter craft got set to bail out too.There would be some clearing up to do, and no doubt various mines and automatic munitions to try and keep them occupied while the enemy fleet made its escape, but there would be no main fleet engagement in Ulubis system, no mega battle.Their orders were to retake Ulubis system at any cost and hold it.A fast, light force of a dozen or so ships might be sent to harry the tardier fringes of the retreating fleet and provide continuing incentivisation for their speedy withdrawal, but they were specifically not to risk chasing en masse for some decisive battle.They had already achieved victory.They were expressly forbidden from taking the slightest risk of throwing it all away.The command staff were celebrating.Taince lay curled in her pod, listening to her colleagues babbling with happiness and obvious relief.Various people talked to her, gabbing away about how the mere threat of their arrival could turn away a fleet three times the size of theirs, how they wished now theyd been with the advance squadron, just to have seen some action, dammit, and how they were probably going to get a heroes welcome when they got to Ulubis.She tried to respond in kind, mustering expressions of tension released and fears assuaged and all the time pretending to pretend that shed have preferred a proper fight.Vice Admiral?The image of Admiral Kisipt appeared in front of her, automatically displacing all the other images of celebrating crew.Sir.She tried to pull her thoughts away from the sick feeling inside.You must be pleased.We wont have to turn your home system into too much of a battleground.Of course, sir.Though there will be mines, booby traps, no doubt.No doubt.And Im keeping a full sweep alert in operation between here and the system, just in case.Kisipt paused.The old Voehns head tipped to one side as he regarded her.1 think it has been very stressful for you, anticipating what might happen when we got to Ulubis, yes?I suppose so, sir.Taince wondered if hed already been alerted to her earlier nervousness, if this was a conversation  even a kind of evaluation  inspired by that.Hmm.Well, the place doesnt look too badly shot up, judging from the advance results.You ought to be able to relax soon.Well need you for liaison and ceremonial duties mostly, I should think.The Admiral made a smile.That will be all right?Of course, sir.Thank you.Good.The Admiral made a show of looking around at the other images distributed about his own icon.Well, Id better talk to a few more people, calm them down, remind them theres still a job to be done.As you were, Vice.Sir.The Admirals image disappeared.Taince didnt bring any of the others to the fore, but turned away from the social space altogether for Tacspace.What have I become?she thought, staring into the dark volumes of Tacspace, watching and not watching coloured lines move and slowly extend, groups of figures, groups of ships tracing their way through the deep space skies bordering Ulubis system.I wanted a proper battle.Death and destruction.I wanted death and destruction.I wanted the chance to die, the chance to kill, the chance to die  She stared into the awful emptiness as people celebrated around her.What have I become?* * *  Fassin felt restless as the Protreptic powered its way through the belts and zones of Nasqueron, heading for the RushWing Sheumerith, riding high in the clear gas spaces between two haze layers in Band A.  The ex Voehn ship shredded clouds as it sped through the atmosphere, keeping just under the median cloud level.Quercer Janath amused themselves by taking turns to pilot in real time and see by how little they could miss shaving the edges of PlungeStems.This involved quite a lot of whooping and the occasional softish collision, making the whole ship shudder.Fassin left them to it and floated away back through the ship, ending up in the chamber where their interrogation and the fight had taken place.He looked round it, at the dent seats and restraints, at the scars and burn marks on the floor, ceilings and walls, and could remember nothing about what had happened.He felt frustrated, even depressed.He floated back towards the command space, stopping just before he got there to look inside what appeared to be the commanders cabin, close to the flight deck.The cabin was sparsely furnished and decorated.Fassin suspected that it had lost a few bits and pieces to some of the more acquisitive alien ship enthusiasts back at Quaibrai.He looked at a square on the wall where something had been removed.The Protreptic shook very slightly.A distant whoop sounded from the command space, a couple of open doors and a short corridor away.Fassin experienced a shudder of his own, and a feeling of something like deja vu, or Swim.I was born in a water moon, he thought to himself, knowing he was quoting something or somebody but not knowing what or who.Another shudder ran through the ship.High pitched giggles rang from the flight deck.Zero.Hey!Fassin!Quercer Janath sent.Call for you.Patch through?Who is it?he asked.No ident.Human female voice.Hold on, well ask.Zero, Fassin thought.Zero.It was a fucking answer.Aun Liss, name given.Any bells rung?* * *  The RushWing Sheumerith, a thin blade across the dun sky, held no sign of Valseir.The Protreptic went off to bag more PlungeStems, promising to return.Fassin flew the little gascraft wearily along the line of tethered, oblivious, wing hanging Dwellers, waiting for a sign.In the end, the other gascraft was obvious.He spotted it from a couple of thousand metres away.The other device saw him at the same time and sent,   Fassin?No, Im a warhead.Who are you?Aun.See youve brought a gun.Hed taken a Voehn hand weapon from the Protreptic, once hed found an armoury that hadnt been raided for souvenirs by the ship enthusiasts of Quaibrai.Quercer Janath hadnt objected.On the contrary, theyd advised him in rather too much detail on the differing capabilities and skill profiles of the various guns on offer when all he wanted was something robust, reliable and powerful that he could use to defend or kill himself with.So in his good manipulator Fassin now toted a chunky device of what Quercer Janath had termed the CBE persuasion  Crude But Effective.He made a show of holding the charged weapon in front of his primary sensing band as he approached.Yes, he sent.Its a souvenir.He drew up by the other machine.It was about the same size and shape as his own, if in rather better condition, and oriented at ninety degrees, the vertical axis longer than the horizontal.It rode inside the cup of still gas behind the open diamond shelter trailing behind the RushWing, near the port limit of the ten kilometre wing.Wary  unable to be anything else  he noted that the two enclosures on either side of the one holding the other small gascraft were each occupied by large Dwellers who looked rather young to have given themselves up, even temporarily, to a life of high speed, high altitude contemplation.The nearest few tether points beyond those on either side were all empty.Come on in, the other machine sent, moving forward until its nose nestled into the inner surface of the diamond enclosure.He pulled in behind, wobbling in the sudden pool of still gas after the howl of slipstream.They were almost touching.Most of the upper surface of the machine facing him turned transparent, showing somebody who certainly looked like Aun Liss lying nearly fully prone in a high gee seat.He saw her fight to raise an arm and wave, a grim expression on her face that turned into a grin as she looked out at him.He de opaqued what he could of his own gascrafts carapace, though the results werent perfect.Fassin didnt even try to smile back.Think you could point that thing away from me?she sent.He saw her grin.I realise this is the first time Ive ever said that to     No, he sent back, still pointing the Voehn gun at her.Okay, she sent, smile vanishing.So, welcome back.Good trip?No.You got a manipulator you can use in that thing?Yes.Wont claim Im an expert, but  He moved his own gascraft forward until it was centimetres from hers.Talk to me the old way.He saw her frown, then smile uncertainly.Okay, she sent.This might be a bit, ah He could see her shifting her gaze to look down at her right forearm, lying squashed on the cradle arm of the gee chair.She looked like she always had, and at the same time quite different.Hair dark, not blonde or auburn or white this time.The high gravity and her attempt to look at her arm as she worked the unfamiliar manipulator interface gave her jowls.He was already fairly sure it was Aun, but he was still quite prepared to kill her.The manipulator came out slowly, unsteadily.Fassin kept his own well out of the way, still holding the gun on her.The two big Dwellers on either side hadnt made any move.The manipulator came forward and touched the hull carapace of his own little gascraft, finger ends spreading awkwardly.In the end, he saw, she had to close her eyes to do it.The fingers on the abraded, nearly insensitive gascrafts skin spelled out SS ( ) SOL ( ) SOTL ( ).He could see her getting frustrated.He watched the expression on her face deepen into a profound, eyes tightly closed frown as she struggled to make the manipulator do exactly what she wanted.He felt tears prick his eyes again.Though he could still shoot her, or himself: anybody.SO STL CRZY?she managed at last, and her eyes opened and she flashed a hugely relieved and pleased with herself smile at him.He switched the gun off.They rode together in the still ball of gas behind the cup of diamond, held on a deep curve of line behind the RushWings thin blade.Not us.That wasnt us.Not guilty.It wasnt even the Starvelings, murdering fucks though they may be.Then who did do it?The Mercatoria, Fass.They killed your people.What?Why?Because they found out that Sept Bantrabal had kept whatever they were sent that briefed you.They were supposed to junk it from the substrate as soon as it was finished but they didnt.It wasnt quite an AI like they sent to the Hierchon, but it had a lot in common.It was a big step along the way to a true AI and it was onward engineerable.Thats why.The attacks we and the Starvelings were making gave them the cover, but even if the truth got out, it would just reinforce how seriously they took the no AIs thing.Fassin supposed it made sense.Old Slovius had always been looking for an edge, some advantage over the other Septs.That was what had brought Bantrabal to its position of prominence over the years.It sounded plausible, sounded like something Slovius would do and browbeat his underlings into doing.And certainly hed put nothing past the Mercatoria.And how do you know all this?he asked her.He saw her shake her head.Spies everywhere, Fass, she told him, almost rueful.We have a lot of friends.Im sure.Did he believe her?Well, until further notice.The Beyonders had known about the List, about the Transform.Like, it seemed, a lot of people, they had known long before he had.Hed only discovered what hed stumbled upon during that long ago delve when hed been told along with everybody else by the projection of Admiral Quile in the Hierchons palace.By then the Beyonders had long since sent their own fleet to the system Zateki, believing  like the Jeltick who had first deciphered the information hed retrieved and had understood its significance  that the Transform was there, in the Second Ship.And theyd already met defeat at the hands of the Voehn.Half the fucking galaxy seemed to have been buzzing round Zateki, searching for a ship that wasnt there, if it even ever had been, and meanwhile hed known nothing.You could just have asked me to look for it for you, Fassin told her.Id have started the search for the Transform in Nasq.centuries ago if you guys had just fucking asked.She looked at him for a long time, an expression on her face of he wasnt sure: sadness, pity, regret, despair?What?he sent.The truth?she asked him.The truth.Fassin.She shook her head.We didnt trust you.He stared back at her.Fassin told her what he thought hed discovered, what he believed hed worked out.She didnt believe him.You coming with us?Can I?May I?Of course.If you want.He thought.Okay, he sent.He thought some more.Though Ive one last person to see first.* * *  When the visitor arrived, Setstyin was water bathing.This was a new fashion, not unpleasant.His servant announced that Seer Fassin Taak was here to see him.Setstyin felt surprise and elation, and a kind of delicious, if slightly grim, anticipation.Tell Seer Taak I am very delighted indeed to welcome him, he told his servant.Ask him to wait in the upper library.Do all you can to make him comfortable.I shall be with him in ten minutes.Fassin!Wonderful to see you!I really cant tell you!We thought  well, we really feared the worst, I swear.Where have you been?Fassin didnt seem to know what to say.I dont think youd believe me if I told you, he said quietly, eventually.The little gascraft floated in the middle of the library.The circular space was lined and floored with crystal stacks.Light came from a translucent ceiling and a single great door giving out onto a broad, rail less balcony.Setstyins house was in the city of Aowne, mid gas in the equatorial zone.Deep orange and yellow clouds swung slowly past the wide window.You think so?Setstyin said.Do feel free to try me.And, please, is there anything I can do?Come, lets sit.They rested in a pair of dent seats with a low table between them.A rather more substantial and grand desk lay just to one side.Well, its a long story I have for you, Fassin said.My favourite kind!Setstyin exclaimed, gathering his long robes about him.Fassin took a moment, as if collecting his thoughts.The fellow seemed, Setstyin thought, dulled, a little slow compared to how hed appeared before.Fassin told the suhrl something of his adventures since hed last seen him, aboard the Planetary Protector (Deniable) Isaut.He also told him a little more of what hed been doing before, as well, apologising for any hesitations or forgetfulness; hed been through a lot recently and some memories were still sort of shuffling their way forward into the light again after being lost.He didnt say exactly what it was he had been told to look for and bring back, and he wasnt able to tell the Dweller very much that happened after the Voehn attacked the Velpin, but he went into as much detail as he felt was possible.I dont understand, the Dweller said.Youre saying you were you were in other stellar systems?You were on the other side of the galaxy?I I just dont  I could not have been more sceptical myself, Fassin said.I did all the tests I could think of, but I certainly seemed to be in the places the truetwin captain claimed I was in.They can do wonderful things with fully immersive VR, you know, Setstyin said awkwardly.I know.But this was either real or something well beyond even fully immersive virtual reality.Setstyin was silent for a moment.You know  and please, dont take this ill  you do look rather, ah, beaten up, Fass my boy.The Dweller was looking at the various dents and scars that the little gascraft had picked up during its last few months of use.The malfunctioning left manipulator arm hung awkwardly at the flank of the arrowhead, slightly out of true.Fassin felt almost ashamed of the gascrafts appearance, as though hed turned up in a rich gentlemans library in dirty rags.Yes, he agreed.As I say, I wont pretend my memory is all it used to be.The gascrafts storage has suffered and my own brain doesnt seem to be as sharp as I remember it being.He laughed.But I know what I saw, what I felt and heard and tasted.I stood on rocks watching the swell waves of a salt ocean breaking, and I was really there, Setstyin.I was there.The Dweller ruffled his sensory mantle and made the tiny up and down sigh motion.Well, Im sure you believe what you believe, Fassin, and I would always tend to believe you rather than not.However, many other people wouldnt be so forgiving.Im not sure it would be a good idea to make too big a fuss about this.You could be right.And I mean to say If this wormhole thing is so secret, why were you taken to  or apparently taken to  the far side of the galaxy, or to anywhere anywhere outside Ulubis?To prove the myth was real.Some people, some Dwellers, think its time for change.They might not know all the details, but they want the truth known.Nobody wants to take responsibility for just telling a non Dweller, but some bumpkin might be pushed in the right direction.And thats me, I suppose; bumpkin number one.Deniable bumpkin number one.And this travelcaptain?Who was he again?A truetwin.Yes, Ive heard they often are.I didnt realise they even pretended to travel so far afield.What was his  their name?Youll forgive me if I dont betray that confidence.Of course, of course.Setstyin seemed to think.So, if there is this, ah, wormhole thing near Nasqueron, who does it belong to?Who controls it?And, it has to be asked, where exactly is it?Arent they rather large and obvious, these wormhole ports?They can be made quite small.But yes, youd think people would have noticed them by now.Well, yes.And Id guess theyre operated by a club or fraternity or something like the same sort of organisation that takes care of planetary defence.Hmm.That would be fairly obvious, I suppose.Thats why I came to you, Setstyin, Fassin said.I wondered if youd heard anything about this, about a group of Dwellers who used these portals.Me?The Dweller reacted as though surprised, almost shocked.Well, no.I mean, none of this would be the sort of thing Id normally get involved with.But, this would be quite something, would it not?I mean to say, if it turned out there was this wormhole here all the time.Wouldnt it?There are stories, myths, about a whole network of them.This Dweller List?Setstyin paused, then stared.Is that what you were looking for all the time?Not the List, the Transform that was supposed to hold the key to the List, Fassin said.And did you find it?Fassin was silent for a moment.Setstyin watched the little gascraft make a show of looking around the library.Is this place quite private?I mean, secure?Fassin asked.I should hope so, Setstyin said.Why?Can we signal, rather than speak, Setstyin?Fassin asked.Its not as easy for me as speaking, these days, so bear with me, but it is more secure.Of course, the Dweller sent.Well, I think I might have found the Transform, the human sent carefully.Really?Really.You will understand if I am a little sceptical.Only natural.Where did you find this Transform?On the body of that dead Dweller, in the Ythyn Sepulcraft, on the far side of the galaxy.Ah hah.What ever was it doing there?It was in a sort of safekeep box.And who would put it there?I dont know.And what did this Transform consist of?An equation.As in mathematics?Thats right.It looked a bit like what some people had come to expect it to look like  a code and a frequency for a broadcast signal of some sort  but in the end it was just an equation.And this was supposed to unlock the List thing?Thats what we were all told.Hmm.But?But, when I solved the equation, guess what?Oh.Ah, I have no idea.Do tell.It came out at nothing.Zero.The Transform turned out to be, in effect, a contrived mathematical joke.Fassin signalled a laugh.Setstyin shared the amusement.I see.So, if this is what you were sent to look for, you might be said to have succeeded in your mission, though not in the manner you might have wished.Yes?Those were pretty much my thoughts, too.Well, at least you missed all the unpleasantness of this inva sion your people have suffered.Thinking of you, Ive been watching the situation.It all looks quite distressing.And still going on.And affecting us, too.There were explosions around Nasqueron just yesterday.Did you see any of them?I did.I hear theres a rumour that the invaders might be about to pull out.Possibly our planetary defence people again.There have been the usual denials, of course.Umm, Im afraid even if I did know more, I couldnt talk about it.You understand.Of course.So, Fassin sent.You dont know anything about these wormholes?Youve never heard of them?I just thought, you being so well connected   All news to me, Fassin.Possibly some small group might have control of such things, though I find that hard to believe, frankly.Ah, well, Fassin sent.He was silent for a few moments.Yes?Setstyin sent.Well, Fassin replied slowly.I did have an idea.An idea?Indeed.What if the Transform answer wasnt a joke?Not a joke?But its zero.What use is that?You see, Fassin sent, and the little gascraft nudged forward a fraction on the dent seat, closer still to Setstyin,  I had thought, what use would an equation be, after all this time?How could it tell you anything useful?A frequency and a code to be broadcast on it was the only thing that really made sense; then these worm   holes could be hidden anywhere in the named systems and only activate themselves when needed.So the fact it was an equation at all made it kind of pointless even before it was worked out.Ill take your word for it, Setstyin told the human.You are rather losing me here, but it all sounds terribly convincing.And then there was all that absurd twisting and spiralling when I was aboard the ship heading through the wormhole portals.Being cut off from external senses seemed obvious enough, but why the spiralling?Umm, yes, in the ship.I see.And just the fact that all of Dweller society does seem like a proper civilisation.Now you really are losing me, Fass.And you obviously possess technologies that we still havent understood.Well, were like that.Us Dwellers, arent we?Oh dear, I think all this is upsetting my balance.You see, if the Transform means what it says, what its saying is that the adjustment you have to make to each entry on the Dweller List to find out where the wormhole portals are in relation to those original locations named is  Fassin held the little gascrafts working arm out, inviting Setstyin to answer.The Dweller ruffled his sensory mantle, which had gone a slightly odd colour.Im sorry, Fassin, I feel positively dizzy.Nothing!Fassin sent.The adjustment is zero.Is it?Is it really?Im sure this is fascinating, really.And what was the original List based on, what did it give?Again, he gave the Dweller a chance to answer, but he didnt.It gave the location of Dweller inhabited gas giants!Fassin put a sort of triumphalist joy into the signalled sentence.I see.I do feel slightly off, Fass.Do you mind if I ?Setstyin rose, wobbling slightly, and roted over to his desk.He started opening lockers and drawers, then glanced up.Keep going, keep going, he said.I have my medication in here somewhere.The Dweller signalled to his servant while he looked through the drawers, keeping his signal pit below the level of the desk, out of sight of the human in his gascraft.Was Mr Taak armed in any way?After a moment:  No, sir.The house checked automatically, naturally.Aside from his manipulative devices, he is unarmed.I see.Thats all.The arrowhead swivelled to keep line of sight with the Dweller.The List doesnt need the Transform, Fassin told Setstyin.All you need to know is that the planets are the location.Really?Indeed.And how can that be?The little gascraft rose up into the air above the dent seat.Because your wormhole portals are inside your planets,  Setstyin, Fassin sent calmly.The Dweller froze, then opened one last drawer.But thats ridiculous, he said aloud.Right in the centre, Fassin continued, also speaking out loud now.Probably of every single gas giant you guys inhabit.There were only  what?two million when the List was drawn up, that right?But that was long ago, and it was a historical document even then.I wouldnt be at all surprised to hear youd connected up every last Dweller planet by now.Im sorry, Fassin, Setstyin said.You wouldnt convince a child with this.Everybody knows you need a flat region of space to make a wormhole portal work.Ah, thats the beauty of it.The very centre of a planet is flat, Fassin said.Right in the very centre of a planet, of any free floating body  sun, rock, gas giant, anything  youre being pulled equally in all directions.Its just like being in orbit round a world and feeling weightless.The only problem, of course, is keeping a volume of space open in the core of a planet or a sun or whatever in the first place.The pressure is colossal, almost beyond belief, especially in a gas giant the size of Nasq., but in the end its just engineering.Hey, you guys have had ten billion years to get good at that sort of stuff.Anything that isnt impossible you learned to do easily when the galaxy was a quarter of the age it is now.So you dont need to position portals in space where anybody could see them or use them or attack them, you dont even need to leave your own planet to access them, you just head for some well hidden shaft that leads you down to the very centre of the world.Maybe at the poles.That would be an obvious kind of place.And if youve got somebody aboard your ship who might be keeping track of where youre going somehow, you just throw in all these crazy spirals and flash some screenage of space into wherever youre keeping them, so they never can tell theyve gone down, not up, and have sunk into the core, not flown out into space.Ah, here we are, Setstyin said, and pulled out a large handgun.Suddenly perfectly steady, he aimed and fired before the little gascraft could react.The beams tore the arrowhead apart, slamming through it and sending it whirling back against a stack of library crystals and then somersaulting over and over as Setstyin kept firing the gun, spreading fire and scattering wreckage all over the library floor.Wildly spinning pieces of debris were sent shrapnelling across the glittering stacks, cracking spines and smashing crystal pages to powder.What was left of the little craft crashed into the windows by the balcony, shattering the diamond as though it was sugar glass.Setstyin stopped firing.Debris pattered down.Smoke drifted, gradually sucked towards the shattered window.The big Dweller roted carefully over to the broken window, keeping the gun trained on the smoking remains of the little craft as he approached.Sir?his servant called over the house intercom.Sir, are you all right?I thought I heard  Fine, Setstyin called, not shifting his attention from the wreckage as he drew closer.Im fine.Be some cleaning up to do in due course, but Im fine.Leave me, now.Sir.A warm breeze ruffled his robes as Setstyin floated out of the window and drew up almost on top of the guttering wreck.He prodded the ruined gascraft with the muzzle of the gun.He prised part of the crafts upper shell away.He peered inside.Fucker!he screamed, and whirled back into the library, tearing through the gas to the desk.Desk!SecComms, now!Aun Liss watched the man as his little craft, his second skin, was destroyed.Fassin winced just the once, twitching as though pained.Aun thought he did not look well.His body was thin inside the borrowed fatigues and he was trembling slightly but continually.His face looked much older than it had, pinched and drawn, eyes sunken and surrounded with darkness.His hair, looking crinkled and thin, had grown a little while hed been inside the gascraft.His eyes and the edges of his ears and nostrils, plus the corners of his mouth, were red from the effects of coming out of the shock gel  and having the gillfluid come out of him  after all this time.He turned to look at her.She was glad to see there was a twinkle in his eye, despite it all.So.Still think Im crazy?he asked.She smiled.Pretty much.They sat in the bright, if cramped, command space of the Ecophobian, a Beyonder shockcraft, a medium weight warship half a light second out from Nasqueron, linked to the now defunct gascraft via a twin of the eyeball sized microsat which had been exactly where it was supposed to be a day earlier, when Fassin had pinged it from the high platform in Quaibrai.They were, amazingly, still receiving basic telemetry from the shattered gascraft, though no sensory content.The machine had been very thoroughly blasted.On a side screen, they had a freeze of the last visual that the little gascraft had sent: Setstyin levelling a sizeable handgun straight at the camera, a tiny sparkle of light just starting in the very centre of the weapons dark barrel.Fassin nodded at the image.I hasten to add that that does not constitute standard Dweller hospitality.Id guessed.Sure it wasnt because you just wouldnt shut up?Im serious.Youre serious?What do you call the guy with the big fuck off gun?Aun, Fassin said, sounding tired now.Do you believe me?She hesitated, shrugged.Im with your belligerent friend; I believe you believe.The gascraft telemetry cut off.The Chief Remotes Officer leaned in, manipulating holos above one of the displays.That wasnt the gascraft totalling, she told them, that was the microsat getting fried.Fast work.Suggest hightail promptly.Hold on to your hats, the captain said.Sit well back.They were thrown, pressed, then rammed back into their seats as the ship accelerated, the command officers shifting to control by induction rather than physical manipulation.The whole gimballed command sphere swung to keep the gee forces pressing on their chests.Were you serious, Mr Taak?the captain asked, her voice strained against the clamping power of the acceleration.Yuh, was the best Fassin could manage.So theres a secret network of ancient Dweller wormholes linking  what?every Dweller gas giant?Fassin took the deepest breath he could and forced out, Thats the idea.Another breath.You send all we got from the gascraft to your high command?The captain managed to laugh.Such as they are, yes.Shit, said the Defence Officer, his voice strained.Lock on.They heard him breathing hard.Its fast!Cant outrun.In fourteen!Fire everything, the captain said crisply.Ready Detach Command.Well risk adrifting, hope the Impavids local.Need to yaw before the Detach or well be hit by the debris spray, the Tactics Officer said.Copy, the captain said.Shame.Always liked this ship.The ship wheeled wildly, Fassin blacked out and never felt the explosive detach.The joltship Impavid picked the command sphere up three days later.* * *  Taince, Saluus Kehar said.He grinned.Hey.So, so good to see you again.He came up to her and put his arms round her.Taince Yarabokin had succeeded in producing a smile.Shed chosen an old fashioned formal cap as part of her uniform and so had the unspoken excuse that she needed to keep this clamped between her elbow and her side for not being able to hug him back with any great enthusiasm.Sal didnt seem to notice anyway.He pulled away, looked at her.Been a while, Taince.Glad you made it back.Good to be back, Taince said.They were in a hangar in the Guard Security Holding Facility Axle 7, a triple wheeled habitat orbiting glantine.Saluus had been held there for the past couple of months while the authorities had decided whether they really believed him about having been kidnapped rather than having run away or even turned traitor.Hed consented to and undergone dozens of brain scans  more than enough to put the matter beyond any doubt in an ordinary case, and of course he had connections and friends in high places who would normally have been only too happy to have discreet words in probably quite receptive ears.But there had been a feeling that this was an exceptional matter, that Sal was rich enough to have afforded technologies or techniques that would fool the brain scans, that the Starvelings themselves might have been able to implant convincing false memories, and  anyway  such a fuss had been made at the time when Saluus had, seemingly, gone over to the invading forces that to let him meekly out just because it looked like he was blameless somehow didnt seem right.When Saluus had disappeared, apparently turning traitor, there had been strikes and attacks on Kehar family and commercial property and hed been denounced by every part of the Ulubine Mercatoria in terms that owed as much to finally having something understandable to hit out at as to any moral indignation.People who had called Sal a friend and been regular guests at many of his family homes had decided that they owed it to the popular mood and their intense personal sense of betrayal  not to mention their future social standing and careers to compete in out vituperating each other in their condem nation of his odious perfidy.The calumnies heaped upon Sals absent head had amounted to a thesaurus of despite, an entire dictionary of bile.In the end he was kept incarcerated as much for his own safety as for anything else.When the Starveling forces left and the Summed Fleet arrived, the general feeling of relief and euphoria pervading the Ulubis system meant that news of Sals shocking innocence traded rather better on the floor of the publics perception, and it could be announced that he was to be released in due course.Most people chose to recant their earlier expressions of hatred and condemnation, though it was still felt best for all concerned if Sals return to public life and rehabilitation was gradual rather than abrupt.Taince had volunteered  pulled rank, indeed  to pilot Sal from the Holding Facility back to the original Kehar family home on glantine.A Guard major got Taince to sign Sal out of custody.Sal watched her signature on the pad.Thats my freedom youre writing there, Vice Admiral, he told her.He was wearing his own clothes, looking slim and casual and bright.Glad to be of service, she told him, then looked at the Guards officer.Is that us, Guard major?Yes, maam.He turned to Saluus.You are free to go, Mr Kehar.Saluus reached out and shook the Guard majors hand.Med, thanks for everything.Been a pleasure, sir.No clothes or anything?Taince asked, looking at his empty hands.Sal shook his head.Came with nothing, taking nothing away.No baggage.He flashed a smile.She tipped her head.Pretty good at our age.They walked to the small cutter squatting on the shallow curve of hangar floor.I really appreciate this, Taince, he told her.I mean I really do.You didnt have to do this.She smiled.His gaze flicked over her insignia.It is okay to call you Taince, isnt it?I mean, Ill call you Vice Admiral if you like.Taince is fine, Sal.After you.She showed him up into the little cutters tandem cockpit, settling him into the seat in front of and below hers.She fitted herself into the pilots seat, clipping on a light flight collar and waking the small crafts systems.The Facilitys flight control cleared them to leave.So youre, what?System Liaison Chief?Sal asked over his shoulder as they were trundled under a door into a sizeable airlock.Yes, well, its pretty much all ceremonial, she told him.The door behind them closed, the lights in the lock dimmed.Receptions, dinners, tours, addresses, you know the sort of thing.Sounds like youre just loving every minute.I suppose somebody has to do it.Serves me right for being Ulubine.Pumps thrummed, a rush of air and a deep hum at first, then after a while just the hum, sounding through the fabric of the cutter.No real fighting to do, anyway.Just clean up stuff.Im not missing much.Any news on Fassin?Sal asked.Last I heard they thought he might be alive again.If you know what I mean.The outer door opened silently to the stars and a great silvery fawn slice of glantine.Just give me a minute or two here, will you?Taince asked.Been a little while since I did this  Hey, take as long as you need.The cutter edged its way out of the lock, stowed its gear, rolled very slowly and drifted away on little whisper bursts of gas, heading towards the atmosphere.Yes.Fassin, Taince said.Well, theyre still looking for him.I heard hed been lost in Nasqueron and then reappeared.There have been rumours.There were always rumours.If you believed them, hes been all over Nasqueron for the last half year, never left, or been in the Oort cloud for the last few months and just returned, or even wilder stuff.Plus hes been declared definitely dead at least three times.Whatever the truth is, hes still not here to tell it himself.Taince rotated the cutter, lining it up for entry.You think he is dead?Sal asked.Lets just say its odd that he hasnt made himself known by now, if he is still around.They met the atmosphere a little later, pressed against the seat restraints, a pink glow building then fading around the canopy, the small ship whistling in across a sequence of thin clouds, deserts and shallow seas, hills, scarps, lakes and low mountains.Taking the scenic route, Taince?She gave a small laugh.Suppose Im just a sentimentalist at heart, Sal.Good to see the old place again, Sal said.She watched him lean to one side, looking down.Is that Pirri down there?She looked, checked the nav.Yes, thats Pirrintipiti.Looks like it always did.Thought it might have grown a bit more.While since youve been home, Sal?Oh, too long, too long.Kept meaning to, but, you know.Must be ten or twelve years.Maybe more.Feels more.They were high over the edges of the thin polar plateau ice cap, crossing into darkness, falling all the time.They could see stars again.She saw him looking up and around.You forget how beautiful it is, eh?Sal asked.Sometimes, Taince said.Easy enough thing to do.The glow in the sky faded around them.She watched the canopy up the brightness, exaggerating the incoming light until they could see the starlight on the North Waste Land, the great long streaks of coloured sands and outcrop rocks, silvery ghosts, coming closer all the time.Ah, right, Sal said quietly.She tapped a few display icons, dimming the screens.Thought wed take a pass, she said.Hope you dont mind.Old times sake.He sounded thoughtful, even resigned.Well, why not?Taince checked the nav again, lined the craft up and cut its speed a little.A light was blinking urgently on one of the displays.She turned that one off too.I certainly havent been back here since that night, Sal said.She thought he sounded sad now.Perhaps regretful.Perhaps not.The ruined ship showed up ahead, a little off to the right.Taince started the cutter on a long starboard curve, levelling out as she did so.Sal looked side down at the desert, rushing past seventy metres below as they banked.Wow, he said.Quicker than that flier I borrowed from Dad.One of your own ships, Sal, she told him.This little thing?He laughed.Didnt realise we made anything this small.Its old.Ah.One of Dads.More money in the big stuff.They zapped past the great dark hulk.Its exposed ribs clawed at the sky.Woo hoo!Sal shouted as the black wall of hull slid past twenty metres away.Taince zoomed, looped and rolled, levelling out again, approaching the wrecked alien ship once more for an even nearer approach.Who hoh hoh!Sal said, seeing how low and close Taince was taking the cutter this time.Taince rolled the craft so that they were upside down.Sheeit!Wow!Taince!Yee ha!Right to the end she hadnt known if shed actually do it or not.She didnt really know the truth of what had happened, after all.She only had her suspicions.She could, despite everything, just be plain wrong.It wouldnt be the first time somebody had taken the law into their own hands and been proved to be hopelessly wrong, once all the facts were known.Fuck, that was what justice was supposed to be all about, that was why you had laws and everything that went with them, that was one of the things that made a society a society.But still.She did know.She was quite sure.It was his time.And if she was wrong, well, Sal had had his share.It wasnt like killing a child, or a young woman with her life before her.It was still killing, still wrong, but there were gradations in all things, even circles in hell.And, frankly  right or wrong  at least shed never know.It was her time.She knew that.Shed really thought there would be tears, but they stayed away.How strange not to know oneself, after so long, at such an extremity, and so close to the end.What else?Well, shed thought of telling him, of confronting him, of bringing it all back up again, of listening to him rage at or plead with or scream at her.That had been something shed rehearsed a lot, that had been something shed thought through time after time after time as shed played and replayed this scene in her head over the years and decades and centuries, taking both her part and his, trying to imagine what hed say, how hed try to explain it, how hed imply she was mad or mistaken.Ultimately Taince had just got bored with it.Shed heard it all before.There was nothing more to say.She was taking a mans life on circumstantial evidence, on a hunch.She ought to give him the chance to appeal.She ought at least to allow him to know it was about to happen.But then, why?The cold sheen of desert and the vast impenetrability of the dark, ruined ship rushed up to meet them.Shit, Tain!Sal might have tried to use the eject  it was one system she couldnt disable from her controls  but then, that was why shed flown the last bit upside down.In the end all it took was a single quick flick of the wrists.The cutter slammed into the side of the ship, just ten metres off the desert floor, at about half the speed of sound.EPILOGUE  There is, along the higher latitudes of the Northern Tropical Uplands of the planet moon glantine, in the system of Ulubis, a bird which, thanks to its call, people call a Hey fella hey.The bird is a migrant, a passer; that is, a bird that does not dwell in the given region but only ever passes through.The Hey fella hey passes through these latitudes in the early spring, heading north.It was a cool day, mid morning.Nasqueron, half full, cast a ruddy brown light over the soft shadows of the day.Once, one might have seen sky mirrors away to one side or the other, bringing sunlight to us even when Nasqueron filled most of the sky above.However, many of these devices were destroyed in the war, and so our little planet moon is a literally gloomier place now than it once was, returned, until new mirrors are emplaced, to its primitive state.I was working in the old formal pasture, wading deep in an exasperation of chuvle weed choking a  by now  almost hidden pond and trying to work out what to do with the weed and the feature (for both are pretty in their own ways) when I heard the distinctive call of said bird.I stopped and listened.Hey fella hey fella hey fella hey!the bird sang.I turned slowly, looking for it in the higher branches of the nearby trees.While I was looking  I never did locate the bird  I saw a figure walking along the high path towards the stream and the perimeter wall which gives out onto the slope holding  a little further up  the ruins of the old Rehlide temple.I looked carefully, zooming in and trying to filter out the effects of the intervening bushes and shrubs, because the figure walked very like Seer Taak, who had been a long time gone from us.(Us!always the same, hurtful mistake.There was no us any more, just a few sad remnants left behind at a house abandoned. )The figure disappeared behind a clump of thicker shrubbery, though they would reappear shortly if they continued to follow the path.I thought.In retrospect, perhaps the person walking on the path had been somewhat older than the gentleman I had been pleased to think of as the young master.He was slightly stooped, which Seer Taak never had been, and he was perhaps too thin, plus he walked like somebody who had been injured in some way.So it seemed to me, at any rate.I would not claim to be an expert in such matters.I am but a humble gardener, after all.Well, a head gardener, but all the same.Still humble, I hope.The figure did indeed reappear, though not exactly where I had been expecting.Whoever it was had taken a side path and was now walking almost straight towards me.They raised a hand.I raised a trowel, waved back.It was Seer Taak!Or  by all reason  it was somebody doing their damnedest to look like a rather more aged version of him.I clambered out of the pond, shook some chuvle weed from a couple of legs, and lumbered up the path bank to meet him.Young master?I said, dropping trowel, rake and spade and brushing soil and weed stems from my arms.The man smiled broadly.HG, it is you.He was dressed in long, loose, casual clothes, nothing like those of a Seer.It is you, Seer Taak!We thought the worst!Oh!For you at least to be alive!I confess I folded, going down on all eights, staring at the gravel of the path, overcome.He squatted in front of me.We never see whats in front of us, do we, HG?Sir?HG, tell me youre not an AI  I looked up at him.Emotion?Was that it?I should have known that would give me away one day.He smiled.Your secrets safe.Well, perhaps for now.Patience, HG.You imply that things may change?Or that I should just wait for death?We do not die easily.We have not been allowed to.He smiled a slow, painful smile.Change, HG.You think?Oh, yes.All sorts of things are happening.I have heard something.They say there is a wormhole mouth, in Nasqueron?I looked up at the great planet which seemed to hang over us, its vast circlet rivers of gas  cream and brown, yellow, white, purple and red  forever sliding in contrary directions.Fassin Taak nodded slowly, thoughtfully.It turns out we were all connected, all the time.He picked up a pebble from the path, looked at it.The Dwellers may even let us use their wormhole network, if we ask them nicely.Sometimes.There is a furious debate going on in Dweller society even as we speak  and probably for some time to come, Dwellers being, well, Dwellers  regarding to what extent the undying admiration of every even vaguely sentient species in the rest of the galaxy and possibly beyond could possibly constitute a general increase in the background kudos level for all Dwellers, and therefore a valid reason for throwing open their galactic transport system to all.That would indeed be a great change.And not one that the Mercatoria would be allowed to control.It would still be the Mercatoria.It can change too.It wont have any choice.Patience, HG.Well, we shall see, but thank you.I looked at him.Fassin Taak did indeed look older.His face was more careworn, the lines around his eyes deeper.Has all been well here, HG?All is well in the garden.The house well, that is not my province.Now he looked down.I took a look around, he said.His voice was quiet.It was all very quiet.Very strange and quiet with nobody there.I try not to look at it, I confessed, except sometimes at dawn and during the very early morning, when it looks much as it always did: bright light upon it but no sign of life.That I can bear.I saw the image even as I spoke of it.I am lucky that I have the garden to tend.By looking after it, it looks after me.Yes, he said.We all need something to do, dont we?I hesitated.Still, there is not a day goes by when I do not curse my luck to have been stuck here rather than with them somehow, when the end came.I envy the Head Gardener of the Winter House, where they all died together.I pulled myself up a fraction.But enough.And you, sir?What do you do these days?Please dont call me sir, HG.Im Fassin.Oh.Thank you.Well, what are you doing?And where?If I may ask.Oh, Ive gone off with the Beyonders, HG.Im already a citizen of the galaxy, albeit slowly, without using wormholes.But, a start.And the Sept, Fassin?There is no Sept, HG.Its gone.He threw the pebble back along the path.Maybe theyll start another Sept  who knows?He looked away in the direction of the distant house.They might fill this house, one day.You wont come back?He looked around.Too many people would still want to ask me too many questions, probably until I died.He looked at me.No, I just came back here for one last look around.And to look you up.Really?Me?Really?Really.I cannot tell you how gratified  no, honoured  that makes me feel.He smiled at me and started to rise to his feet.This humility is a great cover, HG.I hope you can set it aside when the time comes.I meant what I said, Fassin.And I mean this, HG, he said, as he brushed down his clothes, Nasqueron forever behind him.One day well all be free.
