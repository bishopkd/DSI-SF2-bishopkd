Seivarden gestured abortively, arms still tightly crossed, one elbow lifting slightly.It doesnt sound like its worth the trouble.Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat gestured ambivalence.Youll be fed and sheltered here in any event, citizen.She turned to me.And you, honored.Youre here as a tourist?Yes.I smiled, looking, I hoped, very much like a tourist from the Gerentate.Youre a very long way from home.Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat smiled, politely, as though the observation were an idle one.Ive been traveling a long time.Of course sheand by implication otherswere curious about me.I had arrived in company with Seivarden.Most of the people here wouldnt know her name, but those who did would be attracted by the staggering unlikelihood of her having been found after a thousand years, and the connection to an event as notorious as Garsedd.Still smiling pleasantly, Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat asked, Looking for something?Avoiding something?Just like to travel?I made a gesture of ambiguity.I suppose I like to travel.Inspector Supervisor Skaaiats eyes narrowed slightly at my tone of voice, muscles tensing just perceptibly around her mouth.She thought, it seemed, that I was hiding something, and she was interested now, and more curious than before.For an instant I wondered why Id answered the way I had.And realized that Inspector Supervisor Skaaiats being here was incredibly dangerous to menot because she might recognize me, but because I recognized her.Because she was alive and Lieutenant Awn was not.Because everyone of her standing had failed Lieutenant Awn (I had failed Lieutenant Awn), and no doubt if thenLieutenant Skaaiat had been put to the test, she would have failed as well.Lieutenant Awn herself had known this.I was in danger of my emotions affecting my behavior.They already had, they always did.But I had never been confronted with Skaaiat Awer until now.My response is ambiguous, I know, I said, making that placatory gesture Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat had already used.Ive never questioned my desire to travel.When I was a baby, my grandmother said she could tell from the way I took my first steps that I was born to go places.She kept on saying it.I suppose Ive just always believed it.Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat gestured acknowledgment.It would be a shame to disappoint your grandmother, in any event.Your Radchaai is very good.My grandmother always said Id better study languages.Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat laughed.Almost as I remembered her from Ors, but still that trace of gravity.Forgive me, honored, but do you have gloves?I meant to buy some before we boarded, but I decided to wait and buy the right sort.I hoped Id be forgiven my bare hands on arrival since Im an uncivilized foreigner.An argument could be made for either approach, Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat said, still smiling.A shade more relaxed than moments before.Though.A serious turn.You speak very well, but I dont know how much you understand other things.I raised an eyebrow.Which things?I dont wish to be indelicate, honored.But Citizen Seivarden doesnt appear to have any money in her possession.Beside me, Seivarden grew tense again, tightened her jaw, swallowed something she had been about to say.Parents, continued Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat, buy clothes for their children.The temple gives gloves to attendantsflower bearers and water bearers and such.Thats all right, because everyone owes loyalty to God.And I know from your entrance application that youve employed Citizen Seivarden as your servant, but  Ah.I understood her.If I buy gloves for Citizen Seivardenwhich she clearly needsit will look as though Ive offered her clientage.Just so, agreed Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat.Which would be fine if thats what you intended.But I dont think things work that way in the Gerentate.And honestly She hesitated, clearly on delicate ground again.And honestly, I finished for her, shes got a difficult legal situation that might not be helped by her association with a foreigner.My normal habit was expressionlessness.I could keep my anger out of my voice easily.I could speak to Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat as though she were not in any way connected with Lieutenant Awn, as though Lieutenant Awn had had no anxieties or hopes or fears about future patronage from her.Even a rich one.Im not sure Id say it quite that way, began Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat.Ill just give her some money now, I said.That should take care of it.No.Seivardens tone was sharp.Angry.I dont need money.Every citizen is due basic necessities, and clothes are a basic necessity.Ill have what I need.At Inspector Supervisor Skaaiats surprised, inquiring look Seivarden said further, Breq has good reasons for not having given me money.Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat had to know what that likely meant.Citizen, I dont mean to lecture, she said.But if thats the case, why not just let Security send you to Medical?I understand youre reluctant to do that.Reeducation wasnt the sort of thing that was easy to mention politely.But really, it might make things better for you.It often does.A year ago Id have expected Seivarden to lose her temper at this suggestion.But something had changed for her in that time.She only said, slightly irritably, No.Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat looked at me.I raised one eyebrow and a shoulder, as if to say, Thats how she is.Breq has been very patient with me, said Seivarden, astonishing me utterly.And very generous.She looked at me.I dont need money.Whatever you like, I said.Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat had watched the whole exchange intently, frowning just slightly.Curious, I thought, not only about who and what I was, but what I was to Seivarden.Well, she said now, let me take you to the palace.Honored Breq Ghaiad, Ill have your things delivered to your lodgings.She rose.I stood as well, and Seivarden beside me.We followed Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat to the outer officeempty, Daos Ceit (Inspector Adjunct Ceit, I would have to remember) likely gone for the day, given the hour.Instead of taking us through the front of the offices, Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat led us through a back corridor, through a door that opened at no perceptible cue from herStation, that would be, the AI that ran this place, was this place, paying close attention to the inspector supervisor of its docks.Are you all right, Breq?asked Seivarden, looking at me with puzzlement and concern.Fine, I lied.Just a little tired.Its been a long day.I was sure my expression hadnt changed, but Seivarden had noticed something.Through the door was more corridor, and a bank of lifts, one of which opened for us, then closed and moved with no signal.Station knew where Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat wanted to go.Which turned out to be the main concourse.The lift doors slid open onto a broad and dazzling viewan avenue paved in black stone veined with white, seven hundred meters long and twenty five wide, the roof sixty meters above.Directly ahead stood the temple.The steps were not really steps, but an area marked out on the paving with red and green and blue stones; actions on the steps of the temple potentially had legal significance.The entrance was itself forty meters high and eight wide, framed with representations of hundreds of gods, many human shaped, some not, a riot of colors.Just inside the entrance lay a basin for worshippers to wash their hands in, and beyond that containers of cut flowers, a swath of yellow and orange and red, and baskets of incense, for purchase as offerings.Away down either side of the concourse, shops, offices, balconies with flowered vines snaking down.Benches, and plants, and even at an hour when most Radchaai would be at supper hundreds of citizens walked or stood talking, uniformed (white for the Translators Office, light brown for Station Security, dark brown for military, green for Horticulture, light blue for Administration) or not, all glittering with jewelry, all thoroughly Civilized.I saw an ancillary follow its captain into a crowded tea shop, and wondered which ship it was.What ships were here.But I couldnt ask, it wasnt the sort of thing Breq from the Gerentate would care about.I saw them all, suddenly, for just a moment, through non Radchaai eyes, an eddying crowd of unnervingly ambiguously gendered people.I saw all the features that would mark gender for non Radchaainever, to my annoyance and inconvenience, the same way in each place.Short hair or long, worn unbound (trailing down a back, or in a thick, curled nimbus) or bound (braided, pinned, tied).Thick bodied or thin , faces delicate featured or coarse , with cosmetics or none.A profusion of colors that would have been gender marked in other places.All of this matched randomly with bodies curving at breast and hip or not, bodies that one moment moved in ways various non Radchaai would call feminine, the next moment masculine.Twenty years of habit overtook me, and for an instant I despaired of choosing the right pronouns, the right terms of address.But I didnt need to do that here.I could drop that worry, a small but annoying weight I had carried all this time.I was home.This was home that had never been home, for me.I had spent my life at annexations, and stations in the process of becoming this sort of place, leaving before they did, to begin the whole process again somewhere else.This was the sort of place my officers came from, and departed to.The sort of place I had never been, and yet it was completely familiar to me.Places like this were, from one point of view, the whole reason for my existence.Its a bit longer walk, this way, Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat said, but a dramatic entrance.It is, I agreed.Why all the jackets?asked Seivarden.That bothered me last time.Though the last place, anyone in a coat was wearing it knee length.Here it looks like its either jackets or coats down to the floor.And the collars are just wrong.Fashion didnt trouble you the other places weve been, I said.The other places were foreign, Seivarden answered, irritably.They werent supposed to be home.Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat smiled.I imagine youll get used to it eventually.The palace proper is this way.We followed her across the concourse, my and Seivardens uncivilized clothes and bare hands attracting some curious and disgusted looks, and came to the entrance, marked simply with a bar of black over the doorway.Ill be fine, said Seivarden, as though Id spoken.Ill catch up with you when Im done.Ill wait.Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat watched Seivarden go into the palace proper and then said, Honored Breq, a word, please.I acknowledged her with a gesture, and she said, Youre very concerned about Citizen Seivarden.I understand that, and it speaks well of you.But theres no reason to worry for her safety.The Radch takes care of its citizens.Tell me, Inspector Supervisor, if Seivarden were some nobody from a nothing house who had left the Radch without permitsand whatever else it was she did, to be honest I dont know if there was anything elseif she were someone you had never heard of, with a house name you didnt recognize and know the history of, would she have been met courteously at the dock and given tea and then escorted to the palace proper to make her appeal?Her right hand lifted, the barest millimeter, and that small, incongruous gold tag flashed.Shes not in that position anymore.Shes effectively houseless, and broke.I said nothing, only looked at her.No, theres something in what you say.If I didnt know who she was I wouldnt have thought to do anything for her.But surely even in the Gerentate things work that way?I made myself smile slightly, hoping for a more pleasant impression than I had likely been making.They do.Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat was silent a moment, watching me, thinking about something, but I couldnt guess what.Until she said, Do you intend to offer her clientage?That would have been an unspeakably rude question, if I had been Radchaai.But when I had known her Skaaiat Awer had often said things most others left unsaid.How could I?Im not Radchaai.And we dont make that sort of contract in the Gerentate.No, you dont, Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat said.Blunt.I cant imagine what it would be like to suddenly wake up a thousand years from now having lost my ship in a notorious incident, all my friends dead, my house gone.I might run away too.Seivarden needs to find a way she can belong somewhere.To Radchaai eyes, you look like youre offering that to her.Youre concerned Im giving Seivarden false expectations.I thought of Daos Ceit in the outer office, that beautiful, very expensive pearl and platinum pin that wasnt a token of clientage.I dont know what expectations Citizen Seivarden has.Its just youre acting as though youre responsible for her.It looks wrong to me.If I were Radchaai, would it still look wrong to you?If you were Radchaai you would behave differently.The tightness of her jaw argued she was angry but trying to conceal it.Whose name is on that pin?The question, unintended, came out more brusquely than was politic.What?She frowned, puzzled.That pin on your right sleeve.Its different from everything else youre wearing.Whose name is on it?I wanted to ask again, and, What have you done for Lieutenant Awns sister?Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat blinked, and shifted slightly backward, almost as though I had struck her.Its a memorial for a friend who died.And youre thinking about her now.You keep shifting your wrist, turning it toward yourself.Youve been doing it for the past few minutes.I think of her frequently.She took a breath, let it out.Took another.I think maybe Im not being fair to you, Breq Ghaiad.I knew.I knew what name was on that pin, even though I hadnt seen it.Knew it.Wasnt sure if, knowing, I felt better about Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat, or much, much worse.But I was in danger, at this moment, in a way I had never anticipated, never predicted, never dreamed might happen.I had already said things I should never, ever have said.Was about to say more.Here was the one single person I had met in twenty long years who would know who I was.The temptation to cry out, Lieutenant, look, its me, Im Justice of Toren One Esk was overwhelming.Instead, very carefully, I said, I agree with you that Seivarden needs to find herself a home here.I just dont trust the Radch the way you do.The way she does.Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat opened her mouth to answer me, but Seivardens voice cut across whatever Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat would have said.That didnt take long!Seivarden came up beside me, looked at me, and frowned.Your leg is bothering you again.You need to sit down.Leg?asked Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat.An old injury that didnt heal quite right, I said, glad of it for the moment, that Seivarden would attribute any distress she saw to that.That Station would, if it was watching.And youve had a long day, and Ive kept you standing here.Ive been quite rude, please forgive me, honored, Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat said.Of course.I bit back words that wanted to come out of my mouth behind that, and turned to Seivarden.So where do things stand now?Ive requested my appeal, and should have a date sometime in the next few days, she said.I put your name in too.At Inspector Supervisor Skaaiats raised eyebrow Seivarden added, Breq saved my life.More than once.Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat only said, Your audience probably wont be for a few months.Meantime, continued Seivarden with a small, still cross armed acknowledging gesture, Ive been assigned lodgings and Im on the ration list and Ive got fifteen minutes to report to the nearest supplies office and get some clothes.Lodgings.Well, if her staying with me had looked wrong to Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat, doubtless it would, for the same reasons, look wrong to Seivarden herself.And even if she was no longer my servant, she had requested I accompany her to her audience.That was, I reminded myself, the important issue.Do you want me to come with you?I didnt want to.I wanted to be alone, to recover my equilibrium.Ill be fine.You need to get off that leg.Ill catch up with you tomorrow.Inspector Supervisor, it was good to meet you.Seivarden bowed, perfectly calculated courtesy toward a social equal, received an identical bow from Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat, and then was off down the concourse.I turned to Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat.Where do you recommend I stay?Half an hour later I was as I had wished to be, alone in my room.It was an expensive one, just off the main concourse, an incredibly luxurious five meters square, a floor of what might almost have been real wood, dark blue walls.A table and chairs, and an image projector in the floor.Manythough not allRadchaai had optical and auditory implants that allowed them to view entertainments or listen to music or messages directly.But people still liked to watch things together, and the very wealthy sometimes made a point of turning their implants off.The blanket on the bed felt as if it might be actual wool, not anything synthetic.On one wall a fold down cot for a servant, which of course I no longer had.And, incredible luxury for the Radch, the room had its own tiny batha necessity for me, given the gun and ammunition strapped to my body under my shirt.Stations scans hadnt picked it up, and wouldnt, but human eyes could see it.If I left it in the room, a searcher might find it.I certainly couldnt leave it in the dressing room of a public bath.A console on the wall near the door would give me access to communications.And Station.And it would allow Station to observe me, though I was certain it wasnt the only way Station could see into the room.I was back in the Radch, never alone, never private.My luggage had arrived within five minutes of my taking the room, and with it a tray of supper from a nearby shop, fish and greens, still steaming and smelling of spices.There was always the chance that no one was paying attention.But my luggage, when I opened it, had clearly been searched.Maybe because I was foreign.Maybe not.I took out my tea flask and cups, and the icon of She Who Sprang from the Lily, set them on the low table beside the bed.Used a liter of my water allowance to fill the flask, and then sat down to eat.The fish was as delicious as it smelled, and improved my mood slightly.I was, at least, better able to confront my situation once Id eaten it, and had a cup of tea.Station could certainly see a large percentage of its residents with the same intimate view Id had of my officers.The restincluding me, nowit saw in less detail.Temperature.Heart rate.Respiration.Less impressive than the flood of data from more closely monitored residents, but still a great deal of information.Add to that a close knowledge of the person observed, her history, her social context, and likely Station could very nearly read minds.Nearly.It couldnt actually read thoughts.And Station didnt know my history, had no prior experience with me.It would be able to see the traces of my emotions, but wouldnt have many grounds for guessing accurately why I felt as I did.My hip had in fact been hurting.And Inspector Supervisor Skaaiats words to me had been, in Radchaai terms, incredibly rude.If I had reacted with anger, visible to Station if it was looking (visible to Anaander Mianaai if she had been looking), that was entirely natural.Neither one could do more than guess what had angered me.I could play the part now of the exhausted traveler, pained by an old injury, in need of nothing more than food and rest.The room was so quiet.Even when Seivarden had been in one of her sulking moods it hadnt seemed this oppressively silent.I hadnt grown as used to solitude as I had thought.And thinking of Seivarden, I saw suddenly what I had not seen, there on the concourse and blind angry with Skaaiat Awer.I had thought then that Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat had been the only person I had met who might know me, but that wasnt true.Seivarden would have.But Lieutenant Awn had never expected anything from Seivarden, had never stood to be hurt or disappointed by her.If they had ever met, Seivarden would surely have made her disdain clear.Lieutenant Awn would have been stiffly polite, with an underlying anger that I would have been able to see, but she would never have had that sinking dismay and hurt she felt when thenLieutenant Skaaiat said, unthinkingly, something dismissive.But perhaps I was wrong to think my reactions to the two, Skaaiat Awer and Seivarden Vendaai, were very different.I had already put myself in danger once, out of anger with Seivarden.I couldnt untangle it.And I had a part to play, for whoever might be watching, an image I had carefully built on the way here.I set my empty cup beside the tea flask, and knelt on the floor before the icon, hip protesting slightly, and began to pray.19   Next morning I bought clothes.The proprietor of the shop Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat had recommended was on the verge of throwing me out when my bank balance flashed onto her console, unbidden I suspected, Station sparing her embarrassmentand simultaneously telling me how closely it was watching me.I needed gloves, certainly, and if I was going to play the part of the spendthrift wealthy tourist I would need to buy more than that.But before I could speak up to say so, the proprietor brought out bolts of brocade, sateen, and velvet in a dozen colors.Purple and orange brown, three shades of green, gold, pale yellow and icy blue, ash gray, deep red.You cant wear those clothes, she told me, authoritative, as a subordinate handed me tea, managing to mostly conceal her disgust at my bare hands.Station had scanned me and provided my measurements, so I needed do nothing.A half liter of tea, two excruciatingly sweet pastries, and a dozen insults later, I left in an orange brown jacket and trousers, an icy white, stiff shirt underneath, and dark gray gloves so thin and soft I might almost have still been barehanded.Fortunately current fashion favored jackets and trousers cut generously enough to hide my weapon.The resttwo more jackets and pairs of trousers, two pairs of gloves, half a dozen shirts, and three pairs of shoeswould be delivered to my lodgings by the time, the proprietor told me, I was done visiting the temple.I exited the shop, turned a corner onto the main concourse, crowded at this hour with a throng of Radchaai going in and out of the temple or the palace proper, visiting the (no doubt expensive and fashionable) tea shops, or merely being seen in the right company.When I had walked through before, on my way to the clothes shop, people had stared and whispered, or just raised their eyebrows.Now, it seemed, I was mostly invisible, except for the occasional similarly well dressed Radchaai who dropped her gaze to my jacket front looking for signs of my family affiliation, eyes widening in surprise to see none.Or the child, one small gloved hand clutching the sleeve of an accompanying adult, who turned to frankly stare at me until she was drawn past and out of sight.Inside the temple, citizens crowded the flowers and incense, junior priests young enough to look like children to my eyes bringing baskets and boxes of replacements.As an ancillary I wasnt supposed to touch temple offerings, or make them myself.But no one here knew that.I washed my hands in the basin and bought a handful of bright yellow orange flowers, and a piece of the sort of incense I knew Lieutenant Awn had favored.There would be a place within the temple set aside for prayers for the dead, and days that were auspicious for making such offerings, though this wasnt such a day, and as a foreigner I shouldnt have Radchaai dead to remember.Instead I walked into the echoing main hall, where Amaat stood, a jeweled Emanation in each hand, already knee deep in flowers, a hill of red and orange and yellow as high as my head, growing incrementally as worshippers tossed more blooms on the pile.When I reached the front of the crowd I added my own, made the gestures and mouthed the prayer, dropped the incense into the box that, when it filled, would be emptied by more junior priests.It was only a tokenit would return to the entrance, to be purchased again.If all the incense offered had been burned, the air in the temple would have been too thick with smoke to breathe.And this wasnt even a festival day.As I bowed to the god, a brown uniformed ships captain came up beside me.She made to throw her handful of flowers, and then stopped, staring at me.The fingers of her empty left hand twitched, just slightly.Her features reminded me of Hundred Captain Rubran Osck, though where Captain Rubran had been lanky, and worn her hair long and straight, this captain was shorter and thick bodied, hair clipped close.A glance at her jewelry confirmed this captain was a cousin of hers, a member of the same branch of the same house.I remembered that Anaander Mianaai hadnt been able to predict Captain Rubrans allegiance, and didnt want to tug too hard on the web of clientage and contacts the hundred captain belonged to.I wondered if that was still true, or if Osck had come down on one side or the other.It didnt matter.The captain still stared, presumably receiving by now answers to her queries.Station or her ship would tell her I was a foreigner and the captain would, I presumed, lose interest.Or not, if she learned about Seivarden.I didnt wait to see which was the case, but finished my prayer and turned to work my way through the people waiting to make offerings.Off the sides of the temple were smaller shrines.In one, three adults and two children stood around an infant they had laid at the breast of Aatrthe image being constructed to allow this, its arm crooked under the gods often sworn by breastshoping for an auspicious destiny, or at least some sign of what the future might hold for the child.All the shrines were beautiful, glittering with gold and silver, glass and polished stone.The whole place rumbled and roared with the echoes of hundreds of quiet conversations and prayers.No music.I thought of the nearly empty temple of Ikkt, the Divine of Ikkt telling me of hundreds of singers long gone.I was nearly two hours in the temple admiring the shrines of subsidiary gods.The entire place must have taken up whatever part of this side of the station was not occupied by the palace proper.The two were certainly connected, since Anaander Mianaai acted as priest here at regular intervals, though the accesses wouldnt be obvious.I left the mortuary shrine for last.Partly because it was the part of the temple most likely to be crowded with tourists, and partly because I knew it would make me unhappy.It was larger than the other subsidiary shrines, nearly half the size of the vast main hall, filled with shelves and cases crowded with offerings for the dead.All food or flowers.All glass.Glass teacups holding glass tea, glass steam rising above.Mounds of delicate glass roses and leaves.Two dozen different kinds of fruit, fish and greens that nearly gave off a phantom aroma of my supper the night before.You could buy mass produced versions of these in shops well away from the main concourse, and put them in your home shrine, for gods or for the dead, but these were different, each one a carefully detailed work of art, each one conspicuously labeled with the names of the living donor and the dead recipient, so every visitor could see the pious mourningand wealth and statuson display.I probably had enough money to commission such an offering.But if I did so, and labeled it with the appropriate names, it would be the last thing I ever did.And doubtless the priests would refuse it.I had already considered sending money to Lieutenant Awns sister, but that, too, would attract unwelcome curiosity.Maybe I could arrange it so that whatever was left would go to her, once I had done what Id come here to do, but I suspected that would be impossible.Still, thinking it, and thinking of my luxurious room and expensive, beautiful clothes, gave me a twinge of guilt.At the temple entrance, just as I was about to step out onto the concourse, a soldier stepped into my path.Human, not an ancillary.She bowed.Excuse me.I have a message from the citizen Vel Osck, captain of Mercy of Kalr.The captain who had stared at me as I made my offering to Amaat.The fact shed sent a soldier to accost me said she thought me worth more trouble than a message through Stations systems, but not enough to send a lieutenant, or approach me herself.Though that might also have been due to a certain social awkwardness she preferred to push off onto this soldier.It was hard not to notice the slight clumsiness of a sentence designed to avoid a courtesy title.Your pardon, citizen, I said.I dont know the citizen Vel Osck.The soldier gestured, slight, deferential apology.This mornings cast indicated the captain would have a fortuitous encounter today.When she noticed you making your offering she was sure you were who was meant.Noticing a stranger in the temple, in a place as big as this, was hardly a fortuitous encounter.I was slightly offended that the captain hadnt even tried to put more effort into it.Mere seconds of thought would have produced something better.What is the message, citizen?The captain customarily takes tea in the afternoons, said the soldier, bland and polite, and named a shop just off the concourse.She would be honored if you would join her.The time and place suggested the sort of social meeting that was, in reality, a display of influence and associations, and where ostensibly unofficial business would be done.Captain Vel had no business with me.And she would gain no advantage in being seen with me.If the captain wants to meet citizen Seivarden I began.It wasnt Captain Seivarden the captain encountered in the temple, the solder answered, again slightly apologetic.Surely she knew how transparent her errand was.But of course if you wanted to bring Captain Seivarden, Captain Vel would be honored to meet her.Of course.And even houseless and broke, Seivarden would get a personal invitation from someone she knew, not a message through station systems, or a this edge of insulting invite from Captain Vels errand runner.But it was exactly what I had wanted.I cant speak for Citizen Seivarden, of course, I said.Do please thank Captain Vel for the invitation.The soldier bowed, and left.Off the concourse I found a shop selling cartons of what was advertised merely as lunch, which turned out to be fish again, stewed with fruit.I took it back to my room and sat at the table, eating, considering that console on the wall, a visible link with Station.Station was as smart as I had ever been, when I had still been a ship.Younger, yes.Less than half my age.But not to be dismissed, not at all.If I was discovered, it would almost certainly be because of Station.Station hadnt detected my ancillary implants, all of which I had disabled and hidden as best I could.If it had, I would have already been under arrest.But Station could see at least the basics of my emotional state.Could, with enough information about me, tell when I was lying.Was, certainly, watching me closely.But emotional states, from Stations view, from mine when I was Justice of Toren, were just assemblages of medical data, data that were meaningless without context.If, in my present dismal mood, I had just stepped off a ship, Station would possibly see it, but not understand why I felt the way I did, and would not be able to draw any conclusions from it.But the longer I was here, the more of me Station saw, the more data Station would have.It would be able to assemble its own context, its own picture of what I was.And would be able to compare that to what it thought I ought to be.The danger would be if those two didnt match.I swallowed a mouthful of fish, looked at the console.Hello, I said.The AI whos watching me.Honored Ghaiad Breq, said Station from the console, a placid voice.Hello.I am usually addressed as Station.Station, then.Another bite of fish and fruit.So you are watching me.I was, genuinely, worried about Stations surveillance.I wouldnt be able to hide that from Station.I watch everyone, honored.Is your leg still troubling you?It was, and doubtless Station could see me favor it, see the effects of it in the way I sat now.Our medical facilities are excellent.Im sure one of our doctors could find a solution to your problem.An alarming prospect.But I could make that look entirely understandable.No, thank you.Ive been warned about Radchaai medical facilities.Id rather endure a little inconvenience and still be who I am.Silence, for a moment.Then Station asked, Do you mean the aptitudes?Or reeducation?Neither would change who you are.And you arent eligible for either one, I assure you.All the same.I set my utensil down.We have a saying, where I come from: Power requires neither permission nor forgiveness.I have never met anyone from the Gerentate before, said Station.I had, of course, been depending on that.I suppose your misapprehension is understandable.Foreigners often dont understand what the Radchaai are really like.Do you realize what youve just said?Literally that the uncivilized dont understand civilization?Do you realize that quite a lot of people outside Radch space consider themselves to be civilized?The sentence was nearly impossible in Radchaai, a self contradiction.I waited for That wasnt what I meant, but it didnt come.Instead, Station said, Would you have come here if not for Citizen Seivarden?Possibly, I answered, knowing I could not lie outright to Station, not with it watching me so closely.Knowing that now any anger or resentmentor any apprehension about Radchaai officialsthat I felt would be attributed to my being resentful and fearful of the Radch.Is there any music in this very civilized place?Yes, answered Station.Though I dont think I have any music from the Gerentate.If I only ever wanted to hear music from the Gerentate, I said, acid, I would never have left there.This did not seem to faze Station.Would you prefer to go out or stay in?I preferred to stay in.Station called up an entertainment for me, new this year but a comfortably familiar sort of thinga young woman of humble family with hopes of clientage to a more prestigious house.A jealous rival who undermines her, deceiving the putative patron as to her true, noble nature.The eventual recognition of the heroines superior virtue, her loyalty through the most terrible trials, even uncontracted as she is, and the downfall of her rival, culminating in the long awaited clientage contract and ten minutes of triumphant singing and dancing, the last of eleven such interludes over four separate episodes.It was a very small scale worksome of these ran for dozens of episodes that added up to days or even weeks.It was mindless, but the songs were nice and improved my mood considerably.I had nothing urgent to do until word came of Seivardens appeal, and if Seivardens request for an audience, and for me to accompany her, was granted, that would mean another, even longer wait.I rose, brushed my new trousers straight, put on shoes and jacket.Station, I said.Do you know where I can find the citizen Seivarden Vendaai?The citizen Seivarden Vendaai, answered Station from the console, in its always even voice, is in the Security office on sublevel nine.Excuse me?There was a fight, said Station.Normally Security would have contacted her family, but she has none here.I wasnt her family, of course.And she could have called for me if shed wanted me.Still.Can you direct me to the Security office on sublevel nine, please?Of course, honored.The office on sublevel nine was tiny: nothing more, really, than a console, a few chairs, a table with mismatched tea things, and some storage lockers.Seivarden sat on a bench at the back wall.She wore gray gloves and an ill fitting jacket and trousers of some stiff, coarse fabric, the sort of thing extruded on demand, not sewn, and probably produced in a preset range of sizes.My own uniforms, when I had been a ship, had been made that way, but had looked better.Of course Id sized each one properly, it had been a simple thing for me to do at the time.The front of Seivardens gray jacket was spattered with blood, and one glove was soaked with it.Blood was crusted on her upper lip, and the small clear shell of a corrective sat across the bridge of her nose.Another corrective lay across a bruise forming on one cheek.She stared dully ahead, not looking up at me, or at the Security officer who had admitted me.Heres your friend, citizen, said Security.Seivarden frowned.Looked up, around the small space.Then she looked more closely at me.Breq?Aatrs tits, thats you.You look She blinked.Opened her mouth to finish the sentence, stopped again.Took another, somewhat ragged breath.Different, she concluded.Really, really different.I only bought clothes.What happened to you?There was a fight, said Seivarden.Just happened on its own, did it?I asked.No, she admitted.I was assigned a place to sleep, but there was already someone living there.I tried to talk to her but I could hardly understand her.Where did you sleep last night?I asked.She looked down at the floor.I managed.Looked up again, at me, at the Security officer beside me.But I wasnt going to be able to keep managing.You should have come to us, citizen, said Security.Now youve got a warning on your record.Not something you want.And her opponent?I asked.Security made a negating gesture.It wasnt something I was supposed to ask.Im not managing very well on my own, am I, said Seivarden, miserably.Heedless of Skaaiat Awers disapproval, I bought Seivarden new gloves and jacket, dark green, still the sort of thing that was extruded on demand, but at least it fit better, and the higher quality was obvious.The gray ones were past laundering, and I knew the supply office wouldnt issue more clothes so soon.When Seivarden had put them on, and sent the old ones for recycling, I said, Have you eaten?I was planning to offer you supper when Station told me where you were.Shed washed her face, and now looked more or less reputable, give or take the bruising under the corrective on her cheek.Im not hungry, she said.A flicker of somethingregret?Annoyance?I couldnt quite tellflashed across her face.She crossed her arms and quickly uncrossed them again, a gesture I hadnt seen in months.Can I offer you tea, then, while I eat?I would love tea, she said with emphatic sincerity.I remembered that she had no money, had refused to let me give her any.All that tea we had carried with us was in my luggage, she had taken none of it with her when wed parted the night before.And tea, of course, was an extra.A luxury.Which wasnt really a luxury.Not by Seivardens standards, anyway.Likely not by any Radchaais standards.We found a tea shop, and I bought something rolled in a sheet of algae, and some fruit and tea, and we took a table in a corner.Are you sure you dont want anything?I asked.Fruit?She feigned lack of interest in the fruit, and then took a piece.I hope you had a better day than I did.Probably.I waited a moment, to see if she wanted to talk about what had happened, but she said nothing, just waited for me to continue.I went to the temple this morning.And ran into some ships captain who stared quite rudely and then sent one of her soldiers after me to invite me to tea.One of her soldiers.Seivarden realized her arms were crossed, uncrossed them, picked up her tea cup, set it down again.Ancillary?Human.Im pretty sure.Seivarden lifted an eyebrow briefly.You shouldnt go.She should have invited you herself.You didnt say yes, did you?I didnt say no.Three Radchaai entered the tea shop, laughing.All wore the dark blue of dock authority.One of them was Daos Ceit, Inspector Supervisor Skaaiats assistant.She didnt seem to notice me.I dont think the invitation was on my account.I think she wants me to introduce her to you.But She frowned.Looked at the bowl of tea in one green gloved hand.Brushed the front of the new jacket with the other.Whats her name?Vel Osck.Osck.Never heard of them.She took another drink of tea.Daos Ceit and her friends bought tea and pastries, sat at a table on the other side of the room, talking animatedly.Why would she want to meet me?I raised an eyebrow, incredulous.Youre the one who believes any unlikely event is a message from God, I pointed out.Youre lost for a thousand years, found by accident, disappear again, and then turn up at a palace with a rich foreigner.And youre surprised when that gets attention.She made an ambiguous gesture.Absent Vendaai as a functioning house, you need to establish yourself somehow.She looked so dismayed, just for the shortest instant, that I thought my words had offended her in some way.But then she seemed to recover herself.If Captain Vel wanted my good will, or cared at all about my opinion, she made a bad start by insulting you.Her old arrogance lurked behind those words, a startling difference from her barely suppressed dejection up to now.What about that inspector supervisor?I asked.Skaaiat, right?She seemed polite enough.And you seemed to know who she was.All the Awers seem polite enough, Seivarden said, disgustedly.Over her shoulder I watched Daos Ceit laugh at something one of her companions had said.They seem totally normal at first, Seivarden went on, but then they go having visions, or deciding somethings wrong with the universe and they have to fix it.Or both at once.Theyre all insane.She was silent a moment, and then turned to see what I was looking at.Turned back.Oh, her.Isnt she kind of provincial looking?I turned my full attention on Seivarden.Looked at her.She looked down at the table.Im sorry.That was that was just wrong.I dont have any  I doubt, I interrupted, that her pay allows her to wear clothes that make her look different.Thats not what I meant.Seivarden looked up, distress and embarrassment obvious in her expression.But what I meant was bad enough.I just I was just surprised.All this time, I guess Ive just assumed you were an ascetic.It just surprised me.An ascetic.I could see why she would have assumed that, but not why it would have mattered that she was wrong.Unless Youre not jealous?I asked, incredulous.Well dressed or not, I was just as provincial looking as Daos Ceit.Just from a different province.No!And then the next moment, Well, yes.But not like that.I realized, then, that it wasnt just other Radchaai who might get the wrong impression from that gift of clothes Id just made.Even though Seivarden surely knew I couldnt offer clientage.Even though I knew that if she thought about it for longer than thirty seconds, she would never want from me what that gift implied.Surely she couldnt think that Id meant that.Yesterday the inspector supervisor told me I was in danger of giving you false expectations.Or of giving others the wrong impression.Seivarden made a scornful noise.That would be worth considering if I had the remotest interest in what Awer thinks.I raised an eyebrow, and she continued, in a more contrite tone, I thought Id be able to handle things by myself, but all last night, and all today, Ive just been wishing Id stayed with you.I guess its true, all citizens are taken care of.I didnt see anyone starving.Or naked.Her face momentarily showed disgust.But those clothes.And the skel.Just skel, all the time, very carefully measured out.I didnt think Id mind.I mean, I dont mind skel, but I could hardly choke it down.I could guess the mood shed been in, when shed gotten into that fight.I think it was knowing I wasnt going to get anything else for weeks and weeks.And, she said, with a rueful smile, knowing Id have had better if Id asked to stay with you.So you want your old job back, then?I asked.Fuck yes, she said, emphatic and relieved.Loud enough for the party across the room to hear and turn disapproving glances our way.Language, citizen.I took another bite of my algae roll.Relieved, I discovered, on several counts.Are you sure you wouldnt rather take your chances with Captain Vel?You can have tea with whoever you want, said Seivarden.But she should have invited you herself.Your manners are a thousand years old, I pointed out.Manners are manners, she said, indignant.But like I said, you can have tea with whoever you want.Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat entered the shop, saw Daos Ceit and nodded to her, but came over to where Seivarden and I sat.Hesitated, just an instant, noticing the correctives on Seivardens face, but then pretended she hadnt seen them.Citizen.Honored.Inspector Supervisor, I replied.Seivarden merely nodded.Im hosting a small get together tomorrow evening.She named a place.Just tea, nothing formal.Id be honored if you both came.Seivarden laughed outright.Manners, she said again, are manners.Skaaiat frowned, nonplussed.Yours is the second such invitation today, I explained.Citizen Seivarden tells me the first was less than entirely courteous.I hope mine met her exacting standards, Skaaiat said.Who failed them?Captain Vel, I answered.Of Mercy of Kalr.To someone who didnt know her well, Skaaiat probably looked as though she had no real opinions about Captain Vel.Well.I admit I intended to introduce you, citizen, to friends of mine who might be useful to you.But you might find Captain Vels acquaintance more congenial.You must have a low opinion of me, Seivarden said.Its possible, said Skaaiat, and oh how strange it was to hear her speak with such gravity, as I had known her twenty years ago but different, that Captain Vels approach was less than entirely respectful toward the honored Breq.But in other respects I suspect youd find her sympathetic.Before Seivarden could answer, Skaaiat continued, I have to go.I hope to see you both tomorrow evening.She looked over at the table where her assistant sat, and all three of the adjunct inspectors there stood, and left the shop behind her.Seivarden was silent a moment, watching the door they had exited from.Well, I said.Seivarden looked back to me.I guess if youre coming back Id better pay you so you can buy some more decent clothes.An expression I couldnt quite read flashed across Seivardens face.Where did you get yours?I dont think Ill pay you that much, I said.Seivarden laughed.Took a drink of her tea, another piece of fruit.I wasnt at all certain shed really eaten.Are you sure you dont want anything else?I asked.Im sure.What is that thing?She looked toward the last bit of my algae covered supper.No idea.I hadnt ever seen anything quite like it in the Radch, it must have been recently invented, or an idea imported from some other place.Its good, though, do you want one?We can take it back to the room if you like.Seivarden made a face.No, thanks.Youre more adventurous than I am.I suppose I am, I agreed, pleasantly.I finished the last of my supper, drained my tea.But you wouldnt know it to look at me, today.I spent the morning in the temple, like a good tourist, and the afternoon watching an entertainment in my room.Let me guess!Seivarden raised an eyebrow, sardonic.The one everyone is talking about.The heroine is virtuous and loyal, and her potential patrons lover hates her.She wins through because of her unswerving loyalty and devotion.Youve seen it.More than once.But not for a very long time.I smiled.Some things never change?Seivarden laughed in response.Apparently not.Songs any good?Pretty good.You can watch back at the room, if you like.But back in the room she folded down the servants cot, saying, Im just going to sit down a moment, and was asleep two minutes and three seconds later.20   It would almost certainly be weeks before Seivarden even had an audience date.In the meantime we were living here, and I would have a chance to see how things stood, who might side with which Mianaai if things came to an open breach.Maybe even whether one Mianaai or another was in ascendance here.Any information might prove crucial when the moment arrived.And it would arrive, I was increasingly sure.Anaander Mianaai might or might not realize what I was any time soonbut at this point there was no hiding me from the rest of herself.I was here, openly, noticeably, along with Seivarden.Thinking of Seivarden, and Captain Vel Oscks eagerness to meet her, I thought also of Hundred Captain Rubran Osck.Of Anaander Mianaai complaining she couldnt guess her opinion, could rely on neither her opposition nor her support, nor could she pressure her in order to discover or compel it.Captain Rubran had been fortunate enough in her family connections to be able to take such a neutral stance, and keep it.Did that say something about the state of Mianaais struggle with herself at the time?Did the captain of Mercy of Kalr also take that neutral stance?Or had something changed in that balance during the time I had been gone?And what did it mean that Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat disliked her?I was certain dislike was the expression I had seen on her face when I had mentioned the name.Military ships werent subject to dock authoritiesexcept of course in the matter of arrivals and departuresand the relationship between the two usually involved some contempt on one side and mild resentment on the other, all covered over with guarded courtesy.But Skaaiat Awer had never been given to resentment, and besides she knew both sides of the game.Had Captain Vel offended her personally?Did she merely dislike her, as happened sometimes?Or did her sympathies place her on the other side of some political dividing line?And after all, where was Skaaiat Awer likely to fall, in a divided Radch?Unless something had happened to change her personality and opinions drastically, I thought I knew where Skaaiat Awer would land in that toss.Captain Veland for that matter Mercy of KalrI didnt know well enough to say.As for Seivarden, I was under no illusions as to where her sympathies would lie, given a choice between citizens who kept their proper places along with an expanding, conquering Radch, or no more annexations and the elevation of citizens with the wrong accents and antecedents.I was under no illusions as to what Seivardens opinion of Lieutenant Awn would have been, had they ever met.The place where Captain Vel customarily took tea was not prominently marked.It didnt need to be.It was probably not at the very top of fashion and societynot unless Oscks fortunes had soared in the last twenty years.But it was still the sort of place that if you didnt already know it was there you were almost certainly not welcome.The place was dark and the sound muffledrugs and hangings absorbed echoes or unwanted noises.Stepping in from the noisy corridor it was as though I had suddenly put my hands over my ears.Groups of low chairs surrounded small tables.Captain Vel sat in one corner, flasks and bowls of tea and a half empty tray of pastries on the table in front of her.The chairs were full, and an outer circle had been pulled around.They had been here for at least an hour.Seivarden had said to me before we left the room, blandly, still irritated, that of course I wouldnt want to rush out to tea.If shed been in a better mood she would have told me straight out that I should arrive late.It had been my own inclination even before she spoke, so I said nothing and let her have the satisfaction of thinking shed influenced me, if she wished to have it.Captain Vel saw me and rose, bowing.Ah, Breq Ghaiad.Or is it Ghaiad Breq?I made my own bow in return, taking care that it was precisely as shallow as hers had been.In the Gerentate we put our house names first.The Gerentate didnt have houses the way Radchaai did, but it was the only term Radchaai had for a name that indicated family relationship.But I am not in the Gerentate at the moment.Ghaiad is my house name.Youve already put it in the right order for us then!Captain Vel said, falsely jovial.Very thoughtful.I couldnt see Seivarden, who stood behind me.I wondered briefly what expression was on her face, and also why Captain Vel had invited me here if her every interaction with me was going to be mildly insulting.Station was certainly watching me.It would see at least traces of my annoyance.Captain Vel would not.And likely would not care if she could have.And Captain Seivarden Vendaai, Captain Vel continued, and made another bow, noticeably deeper than the one before.An honor, sir.A distinct honor.Do sit.She gestured to chairs near her own, and two elegantly attired and bejeweled Radchaai rose to make way for us, no complaint or expression of resentment apparent.Your pardon, Captain, said Seivarden.Bland.The correctives from the day before had come off, and she looked very nearly what she had been a thousand years ago, the wealthy and arrogant daughter of a highly placed house.In a moment she would sneer and say something sarcastic, I was sure, but she didnt.I no longer deserve the rank.I am the honored Breqs servant.Slight stress on honored, as though Captain Vel might be ignorant of the appropriate courtesy title and Seivarden meant merely to politely and discreetly inform her.And I thank you for the invitation she was good enough to convey to me.There it was, a hint of disdain, though it was possible only someone who knew her well would hear it.But I have duties to attend to.Ive given you the afternoon off, citizen, I said before Captain Vel could answer.Spend it however you like.No reaction from Seivarden, and still I couldnt see her face.I took one of the seats cleared for us.A lieutenant had sat there previously, doubtless one of Captain Vels officers.Though I saw more brown uniforms here than a small ship like Mercy of Kalr could account for.The person next to me was a civilian in rose and azure, delicate satin gloves that suggested she never handled anything rougher or heavier than a bowl of tea, and an ostentatiously large brooch of woven and hammered gold wire set with sapphiresnot, I was sure, glass.Likely the design advertised whatever wealthy house she belonged to, but I didnt recognize it.She leaned toward me and said, loudly, as Seivarden took the seat opposite me, How fortunate you must have thought yourself, to find Seivarden Vendaai!Fortunate, I repeated, carefully, as though the word were unfamiliar to me, leaning just slightly more heavily on my Gerentate accent.Almost wishing the Radchaai language concerned itself with gender so I could use it wrongly and sound even more foreign.Almost.Is that the word for it?I had guessed correctly why Captain Vel had approached me the way she had.Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat had done something similar, addressing Seivarden even though she knew Seivarden had come as my servant.Of course, the inspector supervisor had seen her mistake almost immediately.Across from me, Seivarden was explaining to Captain Vel about the situation with her aptitudes.I was astonished at her icy calm, given I knew shed been angry ever since I told her Id intended to come.But this was, in some ways, her natural habitat.If the ship that had found her suspension pod had brought her somewhere like this, instead of a small, provincial station, things would have gone very differently for her.Ridiculous!exclaimed Rose and Azure beside me, while Captain Vel poured a bowl of tea and offered it to Seivarden.As though you were a child.As though no one knew what you were suited for.It used to be you could depend on officials to handle things properly.Justly, rang the silent companion of that last word.Beneficially.I did, citizen, lose my ship, Seivarden said.Not your fault, Captain, protested another civilian somewhere behind me.Surely not.Everything that happens on my watch is my fault, citizen, answered Seivarden.Captain Vel gestured agreement.Still, there shouldnt have been any question of you taking the tests again.Seivarden looked at her tea, looked over at me sitting empty handed across from her, and set her bowl down on the table in front of her without drinking.Captain Vel poured a bowl and offered it to me, as though she hadnt noticed Seivardens gesture.How do you find the Radch after a thousand years, Captain?asked someone behind me as I accepted the tea.Much changed?Seivarden didnt retrieve her own bowl.Changed some.The same some.For the better, or for the worse?I could hardly say, replied Seivarden, coolly.How beautifully you speak, Captain Seivarden, said someone else.So many young people these days are careless about their speech.Its lovely to hear someone speak with real refinement.Seivardens lips quirked in what might be taken for appreciation of a compliment, but almost certainly wasnt.These lower houses and provincials, with their accents and their slang, agreed Captain Vel.Really, my own ship, fine soldiers but to hear them talk youd think theyd never gone to school.Pure laziness, opined a lieutenant behind Seivarden.You dont have that with ancillaries, said someone, possibly another captain behind me.A lot of things you dont have with ancillaries, said someone else, a comment that might be taken two ways, but I was fairly sure I knew which way was meant.But thats not a safe topic.Not safe?I asked, all innocence.Surely it isnt illegal here to complain about young people these days?How cruel.I had thought it a basic part of human nature, one of the few universally practiced human customs.And surely, added Seivarden with a slight sneer, her mask finally cracking, its always safe to complain about lower houses and provincials.Youd think, said Rose and Azure beside me, mistaking Seivardens intent.But we are sadly changed, Captain, from your day.It used to be you could depend on the aptitudes to send the right citizen to the right assignment.I cant fathom some of the decisions they make these days.And atheists given privileges.She meant Valskaayans, who were, as a rule, not atheists but exclusive monotheists.The difference was invisible to many Radchaai.And human soldiers!People nowadays are squeamish about ancillaries, but you dont see ancillaries drunk and puking on the concourse.Seivarden made a sympathetic noise.Ive never known officers to be puking drunk.In your day, maybe not, answered someone behind me.Things have changed.Rose and Azure tipped her head toward Captain Vel, who to judge by her expression had finally understood Seivardens words as Rose and Azure had not.Not to say, Captain, that you dont keep your ship in order.But you wouldnt have to keep ancillaries in order, would you?Captain Vel waved the point away with an empty hand, her bowl of tea in the other.Thats command, citizen, its just my job.But there are more serious issues.You cant fill troop carriers with humans.The human crewed Justices are all half empty.And of course, interjected Rose and Azure, those all have to be paid.Captain Vel gestured assent.They say we dont need them anymore.They being, of course, Anaander Mianaai.No one would name her while being critical of her.That our borders are proper as they are.I dont pretend to understand policy, or politics.But it seems to me its less wasteful to store ancillaries than it is to train and pay humans and rotate them in and out of storage.They say, said Rose and Azure beside me, taking a pastry from the table in front of her, that if it hadnt been for Justice of Torens disappearance theyd have scrapped one of the other carriers by now.My surprise at hearing my own name couldnt have been visible to anyone here, but surely Station could see it.And that surprise, that startlement, wasnt something that would fit into the identity Id constructed.Station would be reevaluating me, I was sure.So would Anaander Mianaai.Ah, said a civilian behind me.But our visitor here is doubtless glad to hear our borders are fixed.I barely turned my head to answer.The Gerentate would be a very large mouthful.I kept my voice even.No one here could see my continuing consternation at that startlement moments ago.Except, of course, Station and Anaander Mianaai.And Anaander Mianaaior part of her, at leastwould have very good reasons for noticing talk about Justice of Toren, and reactions to it.I dont know, Captain Seivarden, Captain Vel was saying, if youve heard about the mutiny at Ime.An entire unit refused their orders and defected to an alien power.
