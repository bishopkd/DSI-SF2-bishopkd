she persisted."Certainly," I agreed."My family keeps a family book that goes back almost to first landing at Johnson City  every marriage, birth, death, every event of importance not only in direct line but all branches so far as we can keep track.And besides, is a man, a schoolteacher, going around copying old family records all over our warren, writing a history of Luna City.Hobby. ""But don't you have official records?Here in Kaintucky we have records that go back hundreds of years. ""Madam, we haven't lived there that long. ""Yes, but   Well, Luna City must have a city clerk.Perhaps you call him 'county recorder. 'The official who keeps track of such things.Deeds and so forth. "I said."Don't think so, madam.Some bookies do notary work, witnessing chops on contracts, keeping records of them.Is for people who don't read and write and can't keep own records.But never heard of one asked to keep record of marriage.Not saying couldn't happen.But haven't heard. ""How delightfully informal!Then this other rumor, about how simple it is to get a divorce on the Moon.I daresay that's true, too?""No, madam, wouldn't say divorce is simple.Too much to untangle.Mmm...take a simple example, one lady and say she has two husbands  "  "Two?""Might have more, might have just one.Or might be complex marriage.But let's take one lady and two men as typical.She decides to divorce one.Say it's friendly, with other husband agreeing and one she is getting rid of not making fuss.Not that it would do him any good.Okay, she divorces him; he leaves.Still leaves endless things.Men might be business partners, co husbands often are.Divorce may break up partnership.Money matters to settle.This three may own cubic together, and while will be in her name, ex husband probably has cash coming or rent.And almost always are children to consider, support and so forth.Many things.No, madam, divorce is never simple.Can divorce him in ten seconds but may take ten years to straighten out loose ends.Isn't it much that way here?""Uh...just fuhget ah evah asked the question, Cunn'l; it may be simpluh hyuh. "(She did talk that way but was understandable once I got program.Won't spell it again. )"But if that is a simple marriage, what is a 'complex' one?"Found self explaining polyandries, clans, groups, lines, and less common patterns considered vulgar by conservative people such as my own family  deal my mother set up, say, after she ticked off my old man, though didn't describe that one; Mother was always too extreme.Woman said, "You have me confused.What is the difference between a line and a clan?"Are quite different.Take own case.I have honor to be member of one of oldest line marriages in Luna  and, in my prejudiced opinion, best.You asked about divorce.Our family has never had one and would bet long odds never will.A line marriage increases in stability year after year, gains practice in art of getting along together, until notion of anybody leaving is unthinkable.Besides, takes unanimous decision of all wives to divorce a husband  could never happen.Senior wife would never let it get that far. "Went on describing advantages  financial security, fine home life it gives children, fact that death of a spouse, while tragic, could never be tragedy it was in a temporary family, especially for children  children simply could not be orphaned.Suppose I waxed too enthusiastic  but my family is most important thing in my life.Without them I'm just one armed mechanic who could be eliminated without causing a draft."Here's why is stable," I said."Take my youngest wife, sixteen.Likely be in her eighties before is senior wife.Doesn't mean all wives senior to her will die by then; unlikely in Luna, females seem to be immortal.But may all opt out of family management by then; by our family traditions they usually do, without younger wives putting pressure on them.So Ludmilla  "  "Ludmilla?""Russki name.From fairy tale.Milla will have over fifty years of good example before has to carry burden.She's sensible to start with, not likely to make mistakes and if did, has other wives to steady her.Self correcting, like a machine with proper negative feedback.A good line marriage is immortal; expect mine to outlast me at least a thousand years  and is why shan't mind dying when time comes; best part of me will go on living. "Prof was being wheeled out; he had them stop stretcher cart and listened.I turned to him."Professor," I said, "you know my family.Would mind telling this lady why it's a happy family?If you think so. ""It is," agreed Prof."However, I would rather make a more general remark.Dear madam, I gather that you find our Lunar marriage customs somewhat exotic. ""Oh, I wouldn't go that far!"she said hastily."Just somewhat unusual. ""They arise, as marriage customs always do, from economic necessities of the circumstances  and our circumstances are very different from those here on Earth.Take the line type of marriage which my colleague has been praising...nd justifiably, I assure you, despite his personal bias  I am a bachelor and have no bias.Line marriage is the strongest possible device for conserving capital and insuring the welfare of children  the two basic societal functions for marriage everywhere  in an enviroment in which there is no security, neither for capital nor for children, other than that devised by individuals.Somehow human beings always cope with their environments.Line marriage is a remarkably successful invention to that end.All other Lunar forms of marriage serve that same purpose, though not as well. "He said goodnight and left.I had with me  always!a picture of my family, newest one, our wedding with Wyoming.Brides are at their prettiest and Wyoh was radiant  and rest of us looked handsome and happy, with Grandpaw tall and proud and not showing failing faculties.But was disappointed; they looked at it oddly.But man   Mathews, name was  said, "Can you spare this picture, Colonel?"Winced."Only copy I have.And a long way from home. ""For a moment, I mean.Let me have it photographed.Right here, it need never leave your hands,"  "Oh.Oh, certainly!"Not a good picture of me but is face I have, and did Wyoh justice and they just don't come prettier than Lenore.So he photographed it and next morning they did come right into our hotel suite and woke me before time and did arrest and take me away wheel chair and all and did lock me in a cell with bars!For bigamy.For polygamy.For open immorality and publicly inciting others to same.Was glad Mum couldn't see.19   Took Stu all day to get case transferred to an F. N.  court and dismissed.His lawyers asked to have it tossed out on "diplomatic immunity" but F. N.  judges did not fall into trap, merely noted that alleged offenses had taken place outside jurisdiction of lower court, except alleged "inciting" concerning which they found insufficient evidence.Aren't any F. N.  laws covering marriage; can't be  just a rule about each nation required to give "full faith and credence" to marriage customs of other member nations.Out of those eleven billion people perhaps seven billion lived where polygamy is legal, and Stu's opinion manipulators played up "persecution"; it gained us sympathy from people who otherwise would never have heard of us  even gained it in North America and other places where polygamy is not legal, from people who believe in "live and let live. "All good, because always problem was to be noticed.To most of those bee swarm billions Luna was nothing; our rebellion hadn't been noticed.Stu's operators had gone to much thought to plan setup to get me arrested.Was not told until weeks later after time to cool off and see benefits.Took a stupid judge, a dishonest sheriff, and barbaric local prejudice which I triggered with that sweet picture, for Stu admitted later that range of color in Davis family was what got judge angry enough to be foolish even beyond native talent for nonsense.My one consolation, that Mum could not see my disgrace, turned out mistaken; pictures, taken through bars and showing grim face, were in every Luna paper, and write ups used nastiest Earthside stories, not larger number that deplored injustice.But should have had more faith in Mimi; she wasn't ashamed, simply wanted to go Earthside and rip some people to pieces.While helped Earthside, greatest good was in Luna.Loonies become more unified over this silly huhu than had ever been before.They took it personally and "Adam Selene" and "Simon Jester" pushed it.Loonies are easygoing except on one subject, women.Every lady felt insulted by Terran news stories  so male Loonies who had ignored politics suddenly discovered I was their boy.Spin off  old lags feel superior to those not transported.Later found self greeted by ex cons with: "Hi, jailbird!"A lodge greeting  I was accepted.But saw nothing good about it then!Pushed around, treated like cattle, fingerprinted, photographed, given food we wouldn't offer hogs, exposed to endless indignity, and only that heavy field kept me from trying to kill somebody  had I been wearing number six arm when grabbed, might have tried.But steadied down once I was freed.Hour later we were on way to Agra; had at last been summoned by committee.Felt good to be back in suite in maharajah's palace but eleven hour zone change in less than three did not permit rest; we went to hearing bleary eyed and held together by drugs."Hearing" was one sided; we listened while chairman talked.Talked an hour; I'll summarize:  Our preposterous claims were rejected.Lunar Authority's sacred trust could not be abandoned.Disorders on Earth's Moon could not be tolerated.Moreover, recent disorders showed that Authority had been too lenient.Omission was now to be corrected by an activist program, a five year plan in which all phases of life in Authority's trusteeship would be overhauled.A code of laws was being drafted; civil and criminal courts would be instituted for benefit of "client employees"  which meant all persons in trust area, not just consignees with uncompleted sentences.Public schools would be established, plus indoctrinal adult schools for client employees in need of same.An economic, engineering, and agricultural planning board would be created to provide fullest and most efficient use of Moon's resources and labor of client employees.An interim goal of quadrupling grain shipments in five years had been adopted as a figure easily obtainable once scientific planning of resources and labor was in effect.First phase would be to withdraw client employees from occupations found not to be productive and put them to drilling a vast new system of farm tunnels in order that hydroponics would commence in them not later than March 2078.These new giant farms would be operated by Lunar Authority, scientifically, and not left to whims of private owners.It was contemplated that this system would, by end of five year plan, produce entire new grain quota; in meantime client employees producing grain privately would be allowed to continue.But they would be absorbed into new system as their less efficient methods were no longer needed.Chairman looked up from papers."In short, the Lunar colonies are going to be civilized and brought into managerial coordination with the rest of civilization.Distasteful as this task has been, I feel  speaking as a citizen rather than as chairman of this committee  I feel that we owe you thanks for bringing to our attention a situation so badly in need of correction. "Was ready to burn his ears off."Client employees!"What a fancy way to say "slaves"!But Prof said tranquilly, "I find the proposed plans most interesting.Is one permitted to ask questions?Purely for information?""For information, yes. "North American member leaned forward."But don't assume that we are going to take any backtalk from you cavemen!So mind your manners.You aren't in the clear on this, you know. ""Order," chairman said."Proceed, Professor. ""This term 'client employee' I find intriguing.Can it be stipulated that the majority of inhabitants of Earth's major satellite are not undischarged consignees but free individuals?""Certainly," chairman agreed blandly."All legal aspects of the new policy have been studied.With minor exceptions some ninety one percent of the colonists have citizenship, original or derived, in various member nations of the Federated Nations.Those who wish to return to their home countries have a right to do so.You will be pleased to learn that the Authority is considering a plan under which loans for transportation can be arranged...probably under supervision of International Red Cross and Crescent.I might add that I myself am heartily backing this plan  as it renders nonsensical any talk about 'slave labor. '"He smiled smugly."I see," agreed Prof."Most humane.Has the committee  or the Authority  pondered the fact that most  effectively all, I should say  considered the fact that inhabitants of Luna are physically unable to live on this planet?That they have undergone involuntary permanent exile through irreversible physiological changes and can never again live in comfort and health in a gravitational field six times greater than that to which their bodies have become adjusted?"Scoundrel pursed lips as if considering totally new idea."Speaking again for myself, I would not be prepared to stipulate that what you say is necessarily true.It might be true of some, might not be others; people vary widely.Your presence here proves that it is not impossible for a Lunar inhabitant to return to Earth.In any case we have no intention of forcing anyone to return.We hope that they will choose to stay and we hope to encourage others to emigrate to the Moon.But these are individual choices, under the freedoms guaranteed by the Great Charter.But as to this alleged physiological phenomenon  it is not a legal matter.If anyone deems it prudent, or thinks he would be happier, to stay on the Moon, that's his privilege. ""I see, sir.We are free.Free to remain in Luna and work, at tasks and for wages set by you...or free to return to Earth to die. "Chairman shrugged."You assume that we are villians  we're not.Why, if I were a young man I would emigrate to the Moon myself.Great opportunities!In any case I am not troubled by your distortions  history will justify us. "Was surprised at Prof; he was not fighting.Worried about him  weeks of strain and a bad night on top.All he said was, "Honorable Chairman, I assume that shipping to Luna will soon be resumed.Can passage be arranged for my colleague and myself in the first ship?For I must admit, sir, that this gravitational weakness of which I spoke is, in our cases, very real.Our mission is completed; we need to go home. "(Not a word about grain barges.Nor about "throwing rocks," nor even futility of beating a cow.Prof just sounded tired. )Chairman leaned forward and spoke with grim satisfaction."Professor, that presents difficulties.To put it bluntly, you appear to be guilty of treason against the Great Charter, indeed against all humanity...and an indictment is being considered.I doubt if anything more than a suspended sentence would be invoked against a man of your age and physical condition, however.Do you think it would be prudent of us to give you passage back to the place where you committed these acts  there to stir up more mischief?"Prof sighed."I understand your point.Then, sir, may I be excused?I am weary. ""Certainly.Hold yourself at the disposal of this committee.The hearing stands adjourned.Colonel Davis  "  "Sir?"I was directing wheel chair around, to get Prof out at once; our attendants had been sent outside."A word with you, please.In my office. ""Uh  " Looked at Prof; eyes were closed and seemed unconscious.But he moved one finger, motioning me to him."HonorabIe Chairman, I'm more nurse than diplomat; have to look after him.He's an old man, he's ill. ""The attendants will take care of him. ""Well... "Got as close to Prof as I could from chair, leaned over him."Prof, are you right?"He barely whispered."See what he wants.Agree with him.But stall. "Moments later was alone with chairman, soundproof door locked  meant nothing; room could have a dozen ears, plus one in my left arm.He said, "A drink?Coffee?"I answered, "No, thank you, sir.Have to watch my diet here. ""I suppose so.Are you really limited to that chair?You look healthy. "I said, "I could, if had to, get up and walk across room.Might faint.Or worse.Prefer not to risk.Weigh six times what I should.Heart's not used to it. ""I suppose so.Colonel, I hear you had some silly trouble in North America.I'm sorry, I truly am.Barbaric place.Always hate to have to go there.I suppose you're wondering why I wanted to see you. ""No, sir, assume you'll tell when suits you.Instead was wondering why you still call me 'Colonel. '"He gave a barking laugh."Habit, I suppose.A lifetime of protocol.Yet it might be well for you to continue with that title.Tell me, what do you think of our five year plan?"Thought it stunk."Seems to have been carefully thought out. ""Much thought went into it.Colonel, you seem to be a sensible man   I know you are, I know not only your background but practically every word you've spoken, almost your thoughts, ever since you set foot on Earth.You were born on the Moon.Do you regard yourself as a patriot?Of the Moon?""Suppose so.Though tend to think of what we did just as something that had to be done. ""Between ourselves  yes.That old fool Hobart.Colonel, that is a good plan...but lacks an executive.If you are really a patriot or let's say a practical man with your country's best interests at heart, you might be the man to carry it out. "He held up hand."Don't be hasty!I'm not asking you to sell out, turn traitor, or any nonsense like that.This is your chance to be a real patriot  not some phony hero who gets himself killed in a lost cause.Put it this way.Do you think it is possible for the Lunar colonies to hold out against all the force that the Federated Nations of Earth can bring to bear?You're not really a military man, I know  and I'm glad you're not  but you are a technical man, and I know that, too.In your honest estimation, how many ships and bombs do you think it would take to destroy the Lunar colonies?"I answered, "One ship, six bombs. ""Correct!My God, it's good to talk to a sensible man.Two of them would have to be awf'ly big, perhaps specially built.A few people would stay alive, for a while, in smaller warrens beyond the blast areas.But one ship would do it, in ten minutes. "I said, "Conceded, sir, but Professor de la Paz pointed out that you don't get milk by beating a cow.And certainly can't by shooting it. ""Why do you think we've held back, done nothing, for over a month?That idiot colleague of mine  I won't name him  spoke of 'backtalk. 'Backtalk doesn't fret me; it's just talk and I'm interested in results.No, my dear Colonel, we won't shoot the cow...but we would, if forced to, let the cow know that it could be shot.H missiles are expensive toys but we could afford to expend some as warning shots, wasted on bare rock to let the cow know what could happen.But that is more force than one likes to use  it might frighten the cow and sour its milk. "He gave another barking laugh."Better to persuade old bossy to give down willingly. "I waited."Don't you want to know how?"he asked."How?"I agreed."Through you.Don't say a word and let me explain  "  He took me up on that high mountain and offered me kingdoms of Earth.Or of Luna.Take job of "Protector Pro Tem" with understanding was mine permanently if I could deliver.Convince Loonies they could not win.Convince them that this new setup was to their advantage  emphasize benefits, free schools, free hospitals, free this and that  details later but an everywhere government just like on Terra.Taxes starting low and handled painlessly by automatic checkoff and through kickback revenues from grain shipments.But, most important, this time Authority would not send a boy to do a man's job  two regiments of police at once."Those damned Peace Dragoons were a mistake," he said, "one we won't make again.Between ourselves, the reason it has taken us a month to work this out is that we had to convince the Peace Control Commission that a handful of men cannot police three million people spread through six largish warrens and fifty and more small ones.So you'll start with enough police  not combat troops but military police used to quelling civilians with a minimum of fuss.Besides that, this time they'll have female auxiliaries, the standard ten per cent no more rape complaints.Well, sir?Think you can swing it?Knowing it's best in the long run for your own people?"I said I ought to study it in detail, particularly plans and quotas for five year plan, rather than make snap decision.~Certainly, certainly!"he agreed."I'll give you a copy of the white paper we've made up; take it home, study it, sleep on it.Tomorrow we'll talk again.Just give me your word as a gentleman to keep it under your hair.No secret, really...but these things are best settled before they are publicized.Speaking of publicity, you'll need help  and you'll get it.We'll go to the expense of sending up topnotch men, pay them what it's worth, have them centrifuge the way those scientists do  you know.This time we're doing it right.That fool Hobart  he's actually dead, isn't he?""No, sir.Senile, however. ""Should have killed him, Here's your copy of the plan. ""Sir?Speaking of old men   Professor de la Paz can't stay here.Wouldn't live six months. ""That's best, isn't it?"I tried to answer levelly, "You don't understand.He is greatly loved and respected.Best thing would be for me to convince him that you mean business with those H missiles  and that it is his patriotic duty to salvage what we can.But, either way, if I return without him...well, not only could not swing it; wouldn't live long enough to try. ""Hmm   Sleep on it.We'll talk tomorrow.Say fourteen o'clock. "I left and as soon as was loaded into lorry gave way to shakes.Just don't have high level approach.Stu was waiting with Prof."Well?"said Prof.I glanced around, tapped ear.We huddled, heads over Prof's head and two blankets over us all.Stretcher wagon was clean and so was my chair; I checked them each morning.But for room itself seemed safer to whisper under blankets.Started in.Prof stopped me."Discuss his ancestry and habits later.The facts. ""He offered me job of Warden. ""I trust you accepted. ""Ninety percent.I'm to study this garbage and give answer tomorrow.Stu, how fast can we execute Plan Scoot?""Started.We were waiting for you to return.If they let you return. "Next fifty minutes were busy.Stu produced a gaunt Hindu in a dhoti; in thirty minutes he was a twin of Prof, and lifted Prof off wagon onto a divan.Duplicating me was easier.Our doubles were wheeled into suite's living room just at dusk and dinner was brought in.Several people came and went   among them elderly Hindu woman in sari, on arm of Stuart LaJoie.A plump babu followed them.Getting Prof up steps to roof was worst; he had never worn powered walkers, had no chance to practice, and had been flat on back for more than a month.But Stu's arm kept him steady; I gritted teeth and climbed those thirteen terrible steps by myself.By time I reached roof, heart was ready to burst.Was put to it not to black out.A silent little flitter craft came out of gloom right on schedule and ten minutes later we were in chartered ship we had used past month  two minutes after that we jetted for Australia.Don't know what it cost to prepare this dance and keep it ready against need, but was no hitch.Stretched out by Prof and caught breath, then said, "How you feel, Prof?""Okay.A bit tired.Frustrated. ""Ja da.Frustrated. ""Over not seeing the Taj Mahal, I mean.I never had opportunity as a young man  and here I've been within a kilometer of it twice, once for several days, now for another day...and still I haven't seen it and never shall. ""Just a tomb. ""And Helen of Troy was just a woman.Sleep, lad. "We landed in Chinee half of Australia, place called Darwin, and were carried straight into a ship, placed in acceleration couches and dosed.Prof was already out and I was beginning to feel dopy when Stu came in, grinned, and strapped down by us.I looked at him."You, too?Who's minding shop?""The same people who've been doing the real work all along.It's a good setup and doesn't need me any longer.Mannie old cobber, I did not want to be marooned a long way from home.Luna, I mean, in case you have doubts.This looks like the last train from Shanghai. ""What's Shanghai got to do with?""Forget I mentioned it.Mannie, I'm flat broke, concave.I owe money in all directions  debts that will be paid only if certain stocks move the way Adam Selene convinced me they would move, shortly after this point in history.And I'm wanted, or will be, for offenses against the public peace and dignity.Put it this way.I'm saving them the trouble of transporting me.Do you think I can learn to be a drillman at my age?"Was feeling foggy, drug taking hold."Stu, in Luna y'aren't old...barely started...'nyway...eat our table f'ever!Mimi likes you. ""Thanks, cobber, I might.Warning light!Deep breath!"Suddenly was kicked by ten gee.20   Our craft was ground to orbit ferry type used for manned satellites, for supplying F. N.  ships in patrol orbit, and for passengers to and from pleasure and gambling satellites.She was carrying three passengers instead of forty, no cargo except three p suits and a brass cannon (yes, silly toy was along; p suits and Prof's bang bang were in Australia a week before we were) and good ship Lark had been stripped  total crew was skipper and a Cyborg pilot.She was heavily overfueled.We made (was told) normal approach on Elysium satellite...then suddenly scooted from orbital speed to escape speed, a change even more violent than liftoff.This was scanned by F. N.  Skytrack; we were commanded to stop and explain.I got this secondhand from Stu, self still recovering and enjoying luxury of no gee with one strap to anchor.Prof was still out."So they want to know who we are and what we think we are doing," Stu told me."We told them that we were Chinese registry sky wagon Opening Lotus bound on an errand of mercy, to wit, rescuing those scientists marooned on the Moon, and gave our identification  as Opening Lotus. ""How about transponder?""Mannie, if I got what I paid for, our transponder identified us as the Lark up to ten minutes ago...and now has I. D.'d us as the Lotus.Soon we will know.Just one ship is in position to get a missile off and it must blast us in"  he stopped to look  "another twenty seven minutes according to the wired up gentleman booting this bucket, or its chances of getting us are poor to zero.So if it worries you  if you have prayers to say or messages to send or whatever it is one does at such times  now is the time. ""Think we ought to rouse Prof?""Let him sleep.Can you think of a better way to make jump than from peaceful sleep instantaneously into a cloud of radiant gas?Unless you know that he has religious necessities to attend to?He never struck me as a religious man, orthodoctrinally speaking. ""He's not.But if you have such duties, don't let me keep you. ""Thank you, I took care of what seemed necessary before we left ground.How about yourself, Mannie?I'm not much of a padre but I'll do my best, if I can help.Any sins on your mind, old cobber?If you need to confess, I know quite a little about sin. "Told him my needs did not run that way.Then did recall sins, some I cherished, and gave him a version more or less true.That reminded him of some of his own, which remind me   Zero time came and went before we ran out of sins.S LaJoie is a good person to spend last minutes with, even if don't turn out to be last.We had two days with naught to do but undergo drastic routines to keep us from carrying umpteen plagues to Luna.But didn't mind shaking from induced chills and burning with fever; free fall was such a relief and was so happy to be going home.Or almost happy   Prof asked what was troubling me,~ "Nothing," I said."Can't wait to be home.But   Truth is, ashamed to show face after we've failed.Prof, what did we do wrong?""Failed, my boy?""Don't see what else can call it.Asked to be recognized.Not what we got. ""Manuel, I owe you an apology.You will recall Adam Selene's projection of our chances just before we left home. "Stu was not in earshot but "Mike" was word we never used; was always "Adam Selene" for security."Certainly do!One in fifty three.Then when we reached Earthside dropped to reeking one in hundred.What you guess it is now?One in thousand?""I've had new projections every few days...which is why I owe you an apology.The last, received just before we left, included the then untested assumption that we would escape, get clear of Terra and home safely.Or that at least one of us three would make it, which is why Comrade Stu was summoned home, he having a Terran's tolerance of high acceleration.Eight projections, in fact, ranging from three of us dead, through various combinations up to three surviving.Would you care to stake a few dollars on what that last projection is, setting a bracket and naming your own odds?I'll give a hint.You are far too pessimistic. ""Uh...no, damn it!Just tell. ""The odds against us are now only seventeen to one...and they've been shortening all month.Which I couldn't tell you. ""Was amazed, delighted, overjoyed  hurt."What you mean, couldn't tell me?Look, Prof, if not trusted, deal me out and put Stu in executive cell. ""Please, son.That's where he will go if anything happens to any of us  you, me, or dear Wyoming.I could not tell you Earthside  and can tell you now  not because you aren't trusted but because you are no actor.You could carry out your role more effectively if you believed that our purpose was to achieve recognition of independence. ""Now he tells!""Manuel, Manuel, we had to fight hard every instant  and lose. ""So?Am big enough boy to be told?""Please, Manuel.Keeping you temporarily in the dark greatly enhanced our chances; you can check this with Adam.May I add that Stuart accepted his summons to Luna blithely without asking why?Comrade, that committee was too small, its chairman too intelligent; there was always the hazard that they might offer an acceptable compromise  that first day there was grave danger of it.Had we been able to force our case before the Grand Assembly there would have been no danger of intelligent action.But we were balked.The best I could do was to antagonize the committee, even stooping to personal insult to make certain of at least one holdout against common sense. ""Guess I never will understand high level approach. ""Possibly not.But your talents and mine complement each other.Manuel, you wish to see Luna free. ""You know I do. ""You also know that Terra can defeat us. ""Sure.No projection ever gave anything close to even money.So don't see why you set out to antagonize  "  "Please.Since they can inflict their will on us, our only chance lies in weakening their will.That was why we had to go to Terra.To be divisive.To create many opinions.The shrewdest of the great generals in China's history once said that perfection in war lay in so sapping the opponent's will that he surrenders without fighting.In that maxim lies both our ultimate purpose and our most pressing danger.Suppose, as seemed possible that first day, we had been offered an inviting compromise.A governor in place of a warden, possibly from our own number.Local autonomy.A delegate in the Grand Assembly.A higher price for grain at the catapult head, plus a bonus for increased shipments.A disavowal of Hobart's policies combined with an expression of regret over the rape and the killings with handsome cash settlements to the victims' survivors.Would it have been accepted?Back home?""They did not offer that. ""The chairman was ready to offer something like it that first afternoon and at that time he had his committee in hand.He offered us an asking price close enough to permit such a dicker.Assume that we reached in substance what I outlined.Would it have been acceptable at home?""Uh...maybe. ""More than a 'maybe' by the bleak projection made just before we left home; it was the thing to be avoided at any cost  a settlement which would quiet things down, destroy our will to resist, without changing any essential in the longer range prediction of disaster.So I switched the subject and squelched possibility by being difficult about irrelevancies politely offensive.Manuel, you and I know  and Adam knows  that there must be an end to food shipments; nothing less will save Luna from disaster.But can you imagine a wheat farmer fighting to end those shipments?""No.Wonder if can pick up news from home on how they're taking stoppage?""There won't be any.Here is how Adam has timed it, Manuel: No announcement is to be made on either planet until after we get home.We are still buying wheat.Barges are still arriving at Bombay. ""You told them shipments would stop at once. ""That was a threat, not a moral commitment.A few more loads won't matter and we need time.We don't have everyone on our side; we have only a minority.There is a majority who don't care either way but can be swayed  temporarily.We have another minority against us...especially grain farmers whose interest is never politics but the price of wheat.They are grumbling but accepting Scrip, hoping it wili be worth face value later.But the instant we announce that shipments have stopped they will be actively against us.Adam plans to have the majority committed to us at the time the announcement is made. ""How long?One year?Two?""Two days, three days, perhaps four.Carefully edited excerpts from that five year plan, excerpts from the recordings you've made  especially that yellow dog offer  exploitation of your arrest in Kentucky  "  "Hey!I'd rather forget that. "Prof smiled and cocked an eyebrow."Uh  " I said uncomfortably."Okay.If will help. ""It will help more than any statistics about natural resources. "Wired up ex human piloting us went in as one maneuver without bothering to orbit and gave us even heavier beating; ship was light and lively.But change in motion is under two and a half kilometers; was over in nineteen seconds and we were down at Johnson City.I took it right, just a terrible constriction in chest and a feeling as if giant were squeezing heart, then was over and I was gasping back to normal and glad to be proper weight.But did almost kill poor old Prof.Mike told me later that pilot refused to surrender control; Mike would have brought ship down in a low gee, no breakum egg, knowing Prof was aboard.But perhaps that Cyborg knew what he was doing; a low gee landing wastes mass and Lotus Lark grounded almost dry.None of which we cared about, as looked as if that Garrison landing had wasted Prof.Stu saw it while I was still gasping, then we were both at him  heart stimulant, manual respiration, massage.At last he fluttered eyelids, looked at us, smiled."Home," he whispered.We made him rest twenty minutes before we let him suit up to leave ship; had been as near dead as can be and not hear angels.Skipper was filling tanks, anxious to get rid of us and take on passengers  that Dutchman never spoke to us whole trip; think he regretted letting money talk him into a trip that could ruin or kill him.By then Wyoh was inside ship, p suited to come meet us.Don't think Stu had ever seen her in a p suit and certain he had never seen her as a blonde; did not recognize.I was hugging her in spite of p suit; he was standing by, waiting to be introduced.Then strange "man" in p suit hugged him  he was surprised.Heard Wyoh's muffled voice: "Oh heavens!Mannie, my helmet. "I unclamped it, lifted off.She shook curls and grinned."Stu, aren't you glad to see me?Don't you know me?"A grin spread over his face, slowly as dawn across maria."Zdra'stvooeet'ye, Gospazha!I am most happy to see you. ""'Gospazha' indeed!I'm Wyoh to you, dear, always.Didn't Mannie tell you I'd gone back to blonde?""Yes, he did.But knowing it and seeing are not the same. ""You'll get used to it. "She stopped to bend over Prof, kiss him, giggle at him, then straightened up and gave me a no helmet welcome home that left us both with tears despite pesky suit.Then turned again to Stu, started to kiss him.He held back a little.She stopped."Stu, am I going to have to put on brown makeup to welcome you?"Stu glanced at me, then kissed her.Wyoh put in as much time and thought as she had to welcoming me.Was later I figured out his odd behavior.Stu, despite commitment, was still not a Loonie  and in meantime Wyoh had married.What's that got to do with it?Well, Earthside it makes a difference, and Stu did not know deep down in bones that a Loonie lady is own mistress.Poor chum thought I might take offense!We got Prof into suit, ourselves same, and left, me with cannon under arm.Once underground and locked through, we unsuited  and I was flattered to see that Wyoh was wearing crushed under p suit that red dress I bought her ages ago.She brushed it and skirt flared out.Immigration room was empty save for about forty men lined up along wall like new transportees; were wearing p suits and carrying helmets  Terrans going home, stranded tourists and some scientists.Their p suits would not go, would be unloaded before lift.I looked at them and thought about Cyborg pilot.When Lark had been stripped, all but three couches had been removed; these people were going to take acceleration lying on floorplates  if skipper was not careful he was going to have mashed Terrans au blut.Mentioned to Stu."Forget it," he said."Captain Leures has foam pads aboard.He won't let them be hurt; they're his life insurance. "21   My family, all thirty odd from Grandpaw to babies, was waiting beyond next lock on level he!ow and we got cried on and slobbered on and hugged and this time Stu did not hold back.Little Hazel made ceremony of kissing us; she had Liberty Caps, set one on each, then kissed us  and at that signal whole family put on Liberty Caps, and I got sudden tears.Perhaps is what patriotism feels like, choked up and so happy it hurts.Or maybe was just being with my beloveds again."Where's Slim?"I asked Hazel."Wasn't he invited?""Couldn't come.He's junior marshal of your reception. ""Reception?This is all we want. ""You'll see. "Did.Good thing family came out to meet us; that and ride to L City (filled a capsule) were all I saw of them for some time.Tube Station West was a howling mob, all in Liberty Caps.We three were carried on shoulders all way to Old Dome, surrounded by a stilyagi bodyguard, elbows locked to force through cheering, singing crowds.Boys were wearing red caps and white shirts and their girls wore white jumpers and red shorts color of caps.At station and again when they put us down in Old Dome I got kissed by fems I have never seen before or since.Remember hoping that measures we had taken in lieu of quarantine were effective  or half of L City would be down with colds or worse.(Apparently we were clean; was no epidemic.But I remember time  was quite small  when measles got loose and thousands died. )Worried about Prof, too; reception was too rough for a man good as dead an hour earlier.But he not only enjoyed it, he made a wonderful speech in Old Dome  one short on logic, loaded with ringing phrases."Love" was in it, and "home" and "Luna" and "comrades and neighbors" and even "shoulder to shoulder" and all sounded good.They had erected a platform under big news video on south face.Adam Selene greeted us from video screen and now Prof's face and voice were projected from it, much magnified, over his head  did not have to shout.But did have to pause after every sentence; crowd roars drowned out even bull voice from screen  and no doubt pauses helped, as rest.But Prof no longer seemed old, tired, ill; being back inside The Rock seemed to be tonic he needed.And me, too!Was wonderful to be right weight, feel strong, breathe pure, replenished air of own city.No mean city!Impossible to get all of L City inside Old Dome  but looked as if they tried.I estimated an area ten meters square, tried to count heads, got over two hundred not half through and gave up.Lunatic placed crowd at thirty thousand, seems impossible.Prof's words reached more nearly three million; video carried scene to those who could not crowd into Old Dome, cable and relay flashed it across lonely maria to all warrens.He grabbed chance to tell of slave future Authority planned for them.Waved that "white paper. ""Here it is!"he cried."Your fetters!Your leg irons!Will you wear them?""NO!""They say you must.They say they will H bomb...then survivors will surrender and put on these chains.Will you?""NO!NEVER!""Never," agreed Prof."They threaten to send troops...more and more troops to rape and murder.We shall fight them. ""DA!""We shall fight them on the surface, we shall fight them in the tubes, we shall fight them in the corridors!If die we must, we shall die free!""Yes!Ja da!Tell 'em, tell 'em!""And if we die, let history write: This was Luna's finest hour!Give us liberty...or give us death!"Some of that sounded familiar.But his words came out fresh and new; I joined in roars.Look...I knew we couldn't whip Terra  I'm tech by trade and know that an H missile doesn't care how brave you are.But was ready, too.If they wanted a fight, let's have it!Prof let them roar, then led them in "Battle Hymn of the Republic," Simon's version.Adam appeared on screen again, took over leading it and sang with them, and we tried to slip away, off back of platform, with help of stilyagi led by Slim.But women didn't want to let us go and lads aren't at their best in trying to stop ladies; they broke through.Was twenty two hundred before we four, Wyoh, Prof, Stu, self, were locked in room L of Raffles, where Adam Mike joined us by video.I was starved by then, all were, so I ordered dinner and Prof insisted that we eat before reviewing plans.Then we got down to business.Adam started by asking me to read aloud white paper, for his benefit and for Comrade Wyoming   "But first, Comrade Manuel, if you have the recordings you made Earthside, could you transmit them by phone at high speed to my office?I'll have them transcribed for study  all I have so far are the coded summaries Comrade Stuart sent up. "I did so, knowing Mike would study them at once, phrasing was part of "Adam Selene" myth  and decided to talk to Prof about letting Stu in on facts.If Stu was to be in executive cell, pretending was too clumsy.Feeding recordings into Mike at overspeed took five minutes, reading aloud another thirty.That done, Adam said, "Professor, the reception was more successful than I had counted on, due to your speech.I think we should push the embargo through Congress at once.I can send out a call tonight for a session at noon tomorrow.Comments?"I said, "Look, those yammerheads will kick it around for weeks.If you must put it up to them  can't see why  do as you did with Declaration.Start late, jam it through after midnight using own people. "Adam said, "Sorry, Manuel.I'm getting caught up on events Earthside and you have catching up to do here.It's no longer the same group.Comrade Wyoming?""Mannie dear, it's an elected Congress now.They must pass it.Congress is what government we have. "I said slowly, "You held election and turned things over to them?Everything?Then what are we doing?"Looked at Prof, expecting explosion.My objections would not be on his grounds  but couldn't see any use in swapping one talk talk for another.At least first group had been so loose we could pack it  this new group would be glued to seats.Prof was undisturbed.Fitted fingertips together and looked relaxed."Manuel, I don't think the situation is as bad as you seem to feel that it is.In each age it is necessary to adapt to the popular mythology.At one time kings were anointed by Deity, so the problem was to see to it that Deity anointed the tight candidate.In this age the myth is 'the will of the people'...but the problem changes only superficially.Comrade Adam and I have had long discussions about how to determine the will of the people.I venture to suggest that this solution is one we can work with. ""Well...okay.But why weren't we told?Stu, did you know?""No, Mannie.There was no reason to tell me. "He shrugged."I'm a monarchist, I wouldn't have been interested.But I go along with Prof that in this day and age elections are a necessary ritual. "Prof said, "Manuel, it wasn't necessary to tell us till we got back; you and I had other work to do.Comrade Adam and dear Comrade Wyoming handled it in our absence...so let's find out what they did before we judge what they've done. ""Sorry.Well, Wyoh?""Mannie, we didn't leave everything to chance.Adam and I decided that a Congress of three hundred would be about right.Then we spent hours going over the Party lists  plus prominent people not in the Party.At last we had a list of candidates  a list that included some from the Ad Hoc Congress; not all were yammerheads, we included as many as we could.Then Adam phoned each one and asked him  or her  if he would serve...binding him to secrecy in the meantime.Some we had to replace."When we were ready, Adam spoke on video, announced that it was time to carry out the Party's pledge of free elections, set a date, said that everybody over sixteen could vote, and that all anyone had to do to be a candidate was to get a hundred chops on a nominating petition and post it in Old Dome, or the public notice place for his warren.Oh, yes, thirty temporary election districts, ten Congressmen from each district  that let all but the smallest warrens be at least one district. ""So you had it lined up and Party ticket went through?""Oh, no, dear!There wasn't any Party ticket  officially.But we were ready with our candidates...and I must say my stilyagi did a smart job getting chops on nominations; our optings were posted the first day.Many other people posted; there were over two thousand candidates.But there was only ten days from announcement to election, and we knew what we wanted whereas the opposition was split up.It wasn't necessary for Adam to come out publicly and endorse candidates.It worked out  you won by seven thousand votes, dear, while your nearest rival got less than a thousand. ""I won?""You won, I won, Professor won, Comrade Clayton won, and just about everybody we thought should be in the Congress.It wasn't hard.Although Adam never endorsed anyone, I didn't hesitate to let our comrades know who was favored.Simon poked his finger in, too.And we do have good connections with newspapers.I wish you had been here election night, watching the results.Exciting!""How did you go about nose counting?Never known how election works.Write names on a piece of paper?""Oh, no, we used a better system...because, after all, some of our best people can't write.We used banks for voting places, with bank clerks identifying customers and customers identifying members of their families and neighbors who don't have bank accounts  and people voted orally and the clerks punched the votes into the banks' computers with the voter watching, and results were all tallied at once in Luna City clearinghouse.We voted everybody in less than three hours and results were printed out just minutes after voting stopped. "Suddenly a light came on in my skull and I decided to question Wyoh privately.No, not Wyoh  Mike.Get past his "Adam Selene" dignity and hammer truth out of his neuristors.Recalled a cheque ten million dollars too large and wondered how many had voted for me?Seven thousand?Seven hundred?Or just my family and friends?But no longer worried about new Congress.Prof had not slipped them a cold deck but one that was frozen solid  then ducked Earthside while crime was committed.No use asking Wyoh; she didn't even need to know what Mike had done...and could do her part better if did not suspect.Nor would anybody suspect.If was one thing all people took for granted, was conviction that if you feed honest figures into a computer, honest figures come out.Never doubted it myself till met a computer with sense of humor.Changed mind about suggesting that Stu be let in on Mike's self awareness.Three was two too many.Or perhaps three."Mi  " I started to say, and changed to: "My word!Sounds efficient.How big did we win?"Adam answered without expression."Eighty six percent of our candidates were successful  approximately what I had expected. "("Approximately," my false left arm!Exactly what expected, Mike old ironmongery!)"Withdraw objection to a noon session  I'll be there. ""It seems to me," said Stu, "assuming that the embargo starts at once, we will need something to maintain the enthusiasm we witnessed tonight.Or there will be a long quiet period of increasing economic depression  from the embargo, I mean  and growing disillusionment.Adam, you first impressed me through your ability to make shrewd guesses as to future events.Do my misgivings make sense?""They do. ""Well?"Adam looked at us in turn, and was almost impossible to believe that this was a false image and Mike was simply placing us through binaural receptors."Comrades...it must be turned into open war as quickly as possible. "Nobody said anything.One thing to talk about war, another to face up to it.At last I sighed and said, "When do we start throwing rocks?""We do not start," Adam answered."They must throw the first one.How do we antagonize them into doing so?I will reserve my thoughts to the last.Comrade Manuel?""Uh...don't look at me.Way I feel, would start with a nice big rock smack on Agra  a bloke there who is a waste of space.But is not what you are after. ""No, it is not," Adam answered seriously."You would not only anger the entire Hindu nation, a people intensely opposed to destruction of life, but you would also anger and shock people throughout Earth by destroying the Taj Mahal. ""Including me," said Prof."Don't talk dirty, Manuel. ""Look," I said, "didn't say to do it.Anyhow, could miss Taj. ""Manuel," said Prof, "as Adam pointed out, our strategy must be to antagonize them into striking the first blow, the classic 'Pearl Harbor' maneuver of game theory, a great advantage in Weltpolitick.The question is how?Adam, I suggest that what is needed is to plant the idea that we are weak and divided and that all it takes is a show of force to bring us back into line.Stu?Your people Earthside should be useful.Suppose the Congress repudiated myself and Manuel?The effect?""Oh, no!"said Wyoh."Oh, yes, dear Wyoh.Not necessary to do it but simply to put it over news channels to Earth.Perhaps still better to put it out over a clandestine beam attributed to the Terran scientists still with us while our official channels display the classic stigmata of tight censorship.Adam?""I'm noting it as a tactic which probably will be included in the strategy.But it will not be sufficient alone.We must be bombed. ""Adam," said Wyoh, "why do you say so?Even if Luna City can stand up under their biggest bombs  something I hope never to find out  we know that Luna can't win an all out war.You've said so, many times.Isn't there some way to work it so that they will just plain leave us alone?"Adam pulled at right cheek  and I thought: Mike, if you don't knock off play acting, you'll have me believing in you myself!Was annoyed at him and looked forward to a talk  one in which I would not have to defer to "Chairman Selene. ""Comrade Wyoming," he said soberly, "it's a matter of game theory in a complex non zero sum game.We have certain resources or 'pieces in the game' and many possible moves.Our opponents have much larger resources and a far larger spectrum of responses.Our problem is to manipulate the game so that our strength is utilized toward an optimax solution while inducing them to waste their superior strength and to refrain from using it at maximum.Timing is of the essence and a gambit is necessary to start a chain of events favorable to our strategy.I realize this is not clear.I could put the factors through a computer and show you.Or you can accept the conclusion.Or you can use your own judgment. "He was reminding Wyoh (under Stu's nose) that he was not Adam Selene but Mike, our dinkum thinkum who could handle so complex a problem because he was a computer and smartest one anywhere.Wyoh backtracked."No, no," she said, "I wouldn't underitand the maths.Okay, it has to be done.How do we do it?"Was four hundred before we had a plan that suited Prof and Stu as well as Adam  or took that long for Mike to sell his plan while appearing to pull ideas out of rest of us.Or was it Prof's plan with Adam Selene as salesman?In any case we had a plan and calendar, one that grew out of master strategy of Tuesday 14 May 2075 and varied from it only to match events as they actually had occurred.In essence it called for us to behave as nastily as possible while strengthening impression that we would be awfully easy to spank.Was at Community Hall at noon, after too little sleep, and found I could have slept two hours longer; Congressmen from Hong Kong could not make it that early despite tube all way.Wyoh did not bang gavel until fourteen thirty.Yes, my bride wife was chairman pro tem in a body not yet organized.Parliamentary rulings seemed to come naturally to her, and she was not a bad choice; a mob of Loonies behaves better when a lady bangs gavel.Not going to detail what new Congress did and said that session and later; minutes are available.I showed up only when necessary and never bothered to learn talk talk rules  seemed to be equal parts common politeness and ways in which chairman could invoke magic to do it his (her) way.No sooner had Wyoh banged them to order but a cobber jumped up and said, "Gospazha Chairmah, move we suspend rules and hear from Comrade Professor de la Paz!"which brought a whoop of approval.Wyoh banged again."Motion is out of order and Member from Lower Churchill will be seated.This house recessed without adjourning and Chairman of Committee on Permanent Organization, Resolutions, and Government Structure still has the floor. "Turned out to be Wolfgang Korsakov, Member from Tycho Under (and a member of Prof's cell and our number one finagler of LuNoHoCo) and he not only had floor, he had it all day, yielding time as he saw fit (i. e. , picking out whom he wanted to speak rather than letting just anyone talk).But nobody was too irked; this mob seemed satisfied with leadership.Were noisy but not unruly.By dinnertime Luna had a government to replace co opted provisional government  i. e. , dummy government we had opted ourselves, which sent Prof and me to Earth.Congress confirmed all acts of provisional government, thus putting face on what we had done, thanked outgoing government for services and instructed Wolfgang's committee to continue work on permanent government structure.Prof was elected President of Congress and ex officio Prime Minister of interim government until we acquired a constitution.He protested age and health...then said would serve if could have certain things to help him; too old and too exhausted from trip Earthside to have responsibility of presiding  except on occasions of state  so he wanted Congress to elect a Speaker and Speaker Pro Tem...and besides that, he felt that Congress should augment its numbers by not more than ten percent by itself electing members at large so that Prime Minister, whoever he might be, could opt cabinet members or ministers of state who might not now be members of Congress  especially ministers without portfolio to take load off his shoulders.They balked.Most were proud of being "Congressmen" and already jealous of status.But Prof just sat looking tired, and waited  and somebody pointed out that it still left control in hands of Congress.So they gave him what he asked for.Then somebody squeezed in a speech by making it a question to Chair.Everybody knew (he said) that Adam Selene had refrained from standing for Congress on grounds that Chairman of Emergency Committee should not take advantage of positon to elbow way into new government...but could Honorable Chairlady tell member whether was any reason not elect Adam Selene a member at large?As gesture of appreciation for great services?To let all Luna  yes, and all those earthworms, especially ex Lunar ex Authonty  know that we not repudiating Adam Selene, on contrary he was our beloved elder statesman and was not President simply because he chose not to be!More whoops that went on and on.You can find in minutes who made that speech but one gets you ten Prof wrote it and Wyoh planted it.Here is how it wound up over course of days:  Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs: Professor Bernardo de la Paz.Speaker, Finn Nielsen; Speaker Pro Tem, Wyoming Davis.Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Minister of Defense, General O'Kelly Davis; Minister of Information, Terence Sheehan (Sheenie turned Pravda over to managing editor to work with Adam and Stu); Special Minister without Portfolio in Ministry of Information, Stuart Rene LaJoie, Congressman at Large; Secretary of State for Economics and Finance (and Custodian of Enemy Property), Wolfgang Korsakov; Minister of Interior Affairs and Safety, Comrade "Clayton" Watenabe; Minter without Portfolio and Special Advisor to Prime Minister, Adam Selene  plus a dozen ministers and ministers without portfolio from warrens other than Luna City.See where that left things?Brush away fancy titles and B cell was still running things as advised by Mike, backed by a Congress in which we could not lose a test vote  but did lose others we did not want to win, or did not care about.But at time could not see sense in all that talk talk.During evening session Prof reported on trip and then yielded to me  Committee Chairman Korsakov consenting  so that I could report what "five year plan" meant and how Authority had tried to bribe me.I'll never make a speaker but had time during dinner break to swot speech Mike had written.He had slanted it so nastily that I got angry all over again and was angry when I spoke and managed to make it catching.Congress was ready to riot by time I sat down.Prof stepped forward, thin and pale, and said quietly, "Comrade Members, what shall we do?I suggest, Chairman Korsakov consenting, that we discuss informally how to treat this latest insolence to our nation. "One member from Novylen wanted to declare war and they would have done so right then if Prof had not pointed out that they were still hearing committee reports.More talk, all bitter.At last Comrade Member Chang Jones spoke: "Fellow Congressmen  sorry, Gospodin Chairman Korsakov  I'm a rice and wheat farmer.Mean I used to be, because back in May I got a bank loan and sons and I are converting to variety farming.We're broke  had to borrow tube fare to get here  but family is eating and someday we might pull square with bank.At least I'm no longer raising grain."But others are.Catapult has never reduced headway by one barge whole time we've been free.We're still shipping, hoping their cheques will be worth something someday."But now we know!They've told us what they mean to do with us  to us!I say only way to make those scoundrels know we mean business is stop shipments right now!Not another tonne, not a kilo...until they come here and dicker honestly for honest price!"Around midnight they passed Embargo, then adjourned subject to call...standing committees to continue.Wyoh and I went home and I got reacquainted with my family.Was nothing to do; Mike Adam and Stu had been working on how to hit them with it Earthside and Mike had shut catapult down ("technical difficulties with ballistic computer") twenty four hours earlier.Last barge in trajectory would be taken by Poona Ground Control in slightly over one day and Earth would be told, nastily, that was last they would ever get.22   Shock to farmers was eased by continuing to buy grain at catapult  but cheques now carried printed warning that Luna Free State did not stand behind them, did not warrant that Lunar Authority would ever redeem them even in Scrip, etc., etc.Some farmers left grain anyhow, some did not, all screamed.But was nothing they could do; catapult was shut down, loading belts not moving.Depression was not immediately felt in rest of economy.Defense regiments had depleted ranks of ice miners so much that selling ice on free market was profitable; LuNoH0Co steel subsidiary was hiring every able bodied man it could find, and Wolfgang Korsakov was ready with paper money, "National Dollars," printed to resemble Hong Kong dollar and in theory pegged to it.Luna had plenty of food, plenty of work, plenty of money; people were not hurting, "beer, betting, women, and work" went on as usual."Nationals," as they were called, were inflation money, war money, fiat money, and were discounted a fraction of a percent on day of first issue, concealed as "exchange service charge. "They were spendable money and never did drop to zero but were inflationary and exchange reflected it increasingly; new government was spending money it did not have.But that was later   Challenge to Earth, to Authority and Federated Nations, was made intentionally nasty.F. N.  vessels were ordered to stay clear of Luna by ten diameters and not orbit at any distance under pain of being destroyed without warning.(No mention of how, since we could not. )Vessels of private registry would be permitted to land if a) permission was requested ahead of time with ballistic plan, b) a vessel thus cleared placed itself under Luna Ground Control (Mike') at a distance of one hundred thousand kilometers while following approved trajectory, and c) was unarmed save for three hand guns permitted three officers.Last was to be confirmed by inspection on landing before anybody was allowed to leave ship and before ship was serviced with fuel and/or reaction mass; violation would mean confiscation of ship.No person allowed to land at Luna other than ship's crew in connection with loading, unloading, or servicing save citizens of Terran countries who had recognized Free Luna.(Only Chad  and Chad had no ships.Prof expected some private vessels to be re registered under Chad merchant flag. )Manifesto noted that Terran scientists still in Luna could return home in any vessel which conformed to our requirements.It invited all freedom loving Terran nations to denounce wrongs done us and which the Authority planned against us, recognize us, and enjoy free trade and full intercourse  and pointed out that there were no tariffs or any artificial restrictions against trade in Luna, and was policy of Luna government to keep it that way.We invited immigration, unlimited, and pointed out that we had a labor shortage and any immigrant could be self supporting at once.We also boasted of food  adult consumption over four thousand calories per day, high in protein, low in cost, no rationing.(Stu had Adam Mike stick in price of 100 proof vodka  fifty cents HKL per liter, less in quantity, no taxes.Since this was less than one tenth retail price of 80 proot vodka in North America, Stu knew it would hit home.Adam, "by nature" a teetotaler, hadn't thought of it  one of Mike's few oversights. )Lunar Authority was invited to gather at one spot well away from other people, say in unirrigated part of Sahara, and receive one last barge of grain free  straight down at terminal velocity.This was followed by a snotty lecture which implied that we were prepared to do same to anyone who threatened our peace, there being a number of loaded barges at catapult head, ready for such unceremonious delivery.Then we waited.But we waited busily.Were indeed a few loaded barges; these we unloaded and reloaded with rock, with changes made in guidance transponders so that Poona Control could not affect them.Their retros were removed, leaving only lateral thrustors, and spare retros were taken to new catapult, to be modified for lateral guidance.Greatest effort went into moving steel to new catapult and shaping it into jackets for solid rock cylinders  steel was bottleneck.Two days after our manifesto a "clandestine" radio started beaming to Terra.Was weak and tended to fade and was supposed to be concealed, presumably in a crater, and could be worked only certain hours until brave Terran scientists managed to rig automatic repeat.Was near frequency of Voice of Free Luna, which tended to drown it out with brassy boasts.(Terrans remaining in Luna had no chance to make signals.Those who had chosen to stick with research were chaperoned by stilyagi every instant and locked into barracks to sleep. )But "clandestine" station managed to get "truth" to Terra.Prof had been tried for deviationism and was under house arrest.I had been executed for treason.Hong Kong Luna had pulled out, declared self separately independent...might be open to reason.Rioting in Novylen.All food growing had been collectivized and black market eggs were selling for three dollars apiece in Lana City.Battalions of female troops were being enlisted, each sworn to kill at least one Terran, and were drilling with fake guns in corridors of Luna City.Last was an almost true.Many ladies wanted to do something militant and had formed a Home Defense Guard, "Ladies from Hades. "But their drills were of a practical nature  and Hazel was sulking because Mum had not allowed her to join.Then she got over sulks and started "Stilyagi Debs," a very junior home guard which drilled after school hours, did not use weapons, concentrated on backing up stilyagi air & pressure corps, and practiced first aid  and own no weapons fighting, which  possibly  Mum never learned.I don't know how much to tell.Can't tell all, but stuff in history books is so wrong!I was no better a "defense minister" than "congressman. "Not apologizing, had no training for either.Revolution is an amateur thing for almost everybody; Prof was only one who seemed to know what he was doing, and, at that, was new to him, too  he had never taken part in a successful revolution or ever been part of a government, much less head.As Minister of Defense I could not see many ways to defend except for steps already taken; that is, stilyagi air squads in warrens and laser gunners around ballistic radars.If F. N.  decided to bomb, didn't see any way to stop them; wasn't an interception missile in all Luna and that's not a gadget you whomp up from bits and pieces.My word, we couldn't even make fusion weapons with which such a rocket is tipped.But I went through motions.Asked same Chinee engineers who had built laser guns to take a crack at problem of intercepting bombs or missiles  one same problem save that a missile comes at you faster.Then turned attention to other things.Simply hoped that F. N.  would never bomb warrens.Some warrens, L City in particular, were so deep down that they could probably stand direct hits.One cubic, lowest level of Complex where central part of Mike lived, had been designed to withstand bombing.On other hand Tycho Under was a big natural bubble cave like Old Dome and roof was only meters thick; sealer on under side is kept warm with hot water pipes to make sure new cracks sealed  would not take much of a bomb to crack Tycho Under.But is no limit to how big a fusion bomb can be; F. N.  could build one big enough to smash L City    or theoretically even a Doomsday job that would split Luna like a melon and finish job some asteroid started at Tycho.If they did, couldn't see any way to stop them, so didn't worry.Instead put time on problems I could manage, helping at new catapult, trying to work up better aiming arrangements for laser drills around radars (and trying to get drillmen to stick; half of them quit once price of ice went up), trying to arrange decentralized standby engineering controls for all warrens.Mike did designing on this, we grabbed every general purpose computer we could find (paying in "nationals" with ink barely dry), and I turned job over to McIntyre, former chief engineer for Authority; was a job within his talents and I couldn't do all rewiring and so forth, even if had tried.Held out biggest computer, one that did accounting for Bank of Hong Kong in Luna and also was clearinghouse there.Looked over its instruction manuals and decided was a smart computer for one that could not talk, so asked Mike if he could teach it ballistics?We made temporary link ups to let two machines get acquainted and Mike reported it could learn simple job we wanted it for  standby for new catapult  although Mike would not care to ride in ship controlled by it; was too matter of fact and uncritical.Stupid, really.Well, didn't want it to whistle tunes or crack jokes; just wanted it to shove loads out a catapult at right millisecond and at correct velocity, then watch load approach Terra and give a nudge.HK Bank was not anxious to sell.But we had patriots on their board, we promised to return it when emergency was over, and moved it to new site  by rolligon, too big for tubes, and took all one dark semi lunar.Had to jerry rig a big airlock to get it out of Kong warren.I hooked it to Mike again and he undertook to teach art of ballistics against possibility that his linkage to new site might be cut in an attack.(You know what bank used to replace computer?Two hundred clerks working abacuses.Abacusi?You know, slipsticks with beads, oldest digital computer, so far back in prehistory that nobody knows who invented.Russki and Chinee and Nips have always used them, and small shops today. )Trying to improve laser drills into space defense weapons was easier but less straightforward.We had to leave them mounted on original cradles; was neither time, steel, nor metalsmiths to start fresh.So we concentrated on better aiming arrangements.Call went out for telescopes.Scarce  what con fetches along a spyglass when transported?What market later to create supply?Surveying instruments and helmet binoculars were all we turned up, plus optical instruments confiscated in Terran labs.But we managed to equip drills with low power big field sights to coach on with and high powcr scopes for fine sighting, plus train and elevation circles and phones so that Mike could tell them where to point.Four drills we equipped with self synchronous repeater drives so that Mike could control them himself  liberated these selsyns at Richardson; astronomers used them for Bausch cameras and Schmidts in sky mapping.But big problem was men.Wasn't money, we kept upping wages.No, a drillman likes to work or wouldn't be in that trade.Standing by in a ready room day after day, waiting for alert that always turns out to be just another practice  drove 'em crackers.They quit.
