Before long, all eleven of the keys were in her possession, and after liquidating her holdings and turning them into jewels, which she sewed into her clothes, she rode her horse out of the sixth castle and turned north, heading for the seventh: the Castle of King Coyote, and the ultimate goal of her lifelong quest.Nell goes to Madame Ping's Theatre;  rumors of the Fists;  an important client;  assault of the Fists of Righteous Harmony;  ruminations on the inner workings of ractives.Like much that was done with nanotechnology, Feed lines were assembled primarily from a few species of small and uncomplicated atoms in the upper right hand corner of Mendeleev's grid: carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, and chlorine.The Fists of Righteous Harmony had discovered, to their enduring delight, that objects made of these atoms burned rather nicely once you got them going.The flat, low Yangtze Delta country east of Shanghai was a silk district well stocked with mulberry trees, which when felled, stacked, and burned beneath the Feed lines would eventually ignite them like road flares.The Nipponese Feed was heavy on the phosphorus and burned with a furious white flame that lit up the night sky in several places as seen from the tall buildings in Pudong.One major line led toward Nanjing, one toward Suzhou, one toward Hangzhou: these distant flares inevitably led to rumors, among the hordes of refugees in Shanghai, that those cities were themselves burning.The New Atlantan Feed had a higher sulfur content that, when burned, produced a plutonic reek that permeated everything for dozens of miles downwind, making the fires seem much closer than they really were.Shanghai was smelling pretty sulfurous as Nell walked into it across one of the bridges linking downtown Pudong with the much lower and older Bund.The Huang Pu had been too wide to bridge easily until nano had come along, so the four downtown bridges were made of the new materials and seemed impossibly fragile compared with the reinforced concrete behemoths built to the north and south during the previous century.A few days ago, working on a script in Madame Ping's offices far above, Nell had gazed out the window at a barge making its way down the river, pulled by a rickety old diesel tug, swathed in dun tarps.A few hundred meters upstream of this very bridge she was now crossing, the tarps had begun squirming and boiling, and a dozen young men in white tunics had jumped out from beneath, scarlet bands tied about their waists, scarlet ribbons around their wrists and foreheads.They had swarmed across the top of the barge hacking at ropes with knives, and the tarps had reluctantly and unevenly fallen away to expose a patchy new coat of red paint and, lined up on the top of the barge like a string of enormous firecrackers, several dozen compressed gas tanks, also painted a festive red for the occasion.Under the circumstances, she did not doubt for a moment that the men were Fists and the gas hydrogen or something else that burned well.But before they had been able to reach the bridge, the tanks had been burst and ignited by something too small and fast for Nell to see from her high post.The barge silently turned into a carbuncle of yellow flame that took up half the width of the Huang Pu, and though the diamond window filtered all of the heat out of its radiance, Nell was able to put her hand on the pane and feel the absorbed warmth, not much hotter than a person's skin.The whole operation had been touchingly hapless, in an age when a hand size battery could contain as much energy as all those cylinders of gas.It had a quaint twentieth century feel and made Nell oddly nostalgic for the days when dangerousness was a function of mass and bulk.The passives of that era were so fun to watch, with their big, stupid cars and big, stupid guns and big, stupid people.Up and downstream of the bridge, the funeral piers were crowded with refugee families heaving corpses into the Huang Pu; the emaciated bodies, rolled up in white sheets, looked like cigarettes.The Coastal Republic authorities had instituted a pass system on the bridges to prevent rural refugees from swarming across into the relatively spacious streets, plazas, atria, and lobbies of Pudong and gumming up the works for the office crowd.By the time Nell made it across, a couple of hundred refugees had already picked her out as a likely alms source and were waiting with canned demonstrations: women holding up their gaunt babies, or older children who were trained to hang comatose in their arms; men with open wounds, and legless gaffers dauntlessly knucklewalking through the crowd, butting at people's knees.The taxi drivers were stronger and more aggressive than the rurals, though, and had a fearsome reputation that created space around them in the crowd, and that was more valuable than an actual vehicle; a vehicle would always get stuck in traffic, but a taxi driver's hat generated a magic force field that enabled the wearer to walk faster than anyone else.The taxi drivers converged on Nell too, and she picked out the biggest one and haggled with him, holding up fingers and essaying a few words in Shanghainese.When the numbers had climbed into the right range for him, he spun around suddenly to face the crowd.The suddenness of the movement drove people back, and the meter long bamboo stick in his hand didn't hurt either.He stepped forward and Nell hurried after him, ignoring the myriad tuggings at her long skirts, trying not to wonder which of the beggars was a Fist with a concealed knife.If her clothes hadn't been made of untearable, uncuttable nanostuff, she would have been stripped naked within a block.Madame Ping's was still doing a decent business.Its clientele were willing to put up with some inconvenience to get there.It was only a short distance from the bridgehead, and the Madame had put a few truculent taxi drivers on retainer as personal escorts.The business was startlingly large given the scarcity of real estate in Shanghai; it occupied most of a five story reinforced concrete Mao Dynasty apartment block, having started out with just a couple of flats and expanded room by room as the years went on.The reception area reminded one of a not bad hotel lobby, except that it had no restaurant or bar; none of the clients wanted to see or be seen by any other.The desk was staffed by concierges whose job was to get the clients out of view as quickly as possible, and they did it so well that an uninitiated passerby might get the impression that Madame Ping's was some kind of a walk in kidnapping operation.One of these functionaries, a tiny woman who seemed oddly prim and asexual considering that she was wearing a black leather miniskirt, briskly took Nell to the top floor, where the large apartments had been built and elaborate scenarios were now realized for Madame Ping's clients.As the writer, Nell of course never actually entered the same room as the client.The woman in the miniskirt escorted her into a nearby observation room, where a high res cine feed from the next room covered most of one wall.If she hadn't known it already, Nell would have seen from the client's uniform that he was a colonel in Her Majesty's Joint Forces.He was wearing a full dress uniform, and the various pins and medals on his coat indicated that he had spent a good deal of his career attached to various Protocol Enforcement units, been wounded in action several times, and displayed exceptional heroism on one occasion.In fact, it was clear that he was a rather important fellow.Reviewing the previous half hour, Nell saw that, not surprisingly, he had arrived in mufti, carrying the uniform in a leather satchel.Wearing the uniform must be part of the scenario.At the moment he was seated in a rather typical Victorian parlor, sipping tea from a Royal Albert china cup decorated with a somewhat agonistic briar rose pattern.He looked fidgety; he'd been kept waiting for half an hour, which was also part of the scenario.Madame Ping kept telling her that no one ever complained about having to wait too long for an orgasm; that men could do that to themselves any time they wanted, and that it was the business leading up to it that they would pay for.The biological readouts seemed to confirm Madame Ping's rule: Perspiration and pulse were rather high, and he was about half erect.Nell heard the sound of a door opening.Switching to a different angle she saw a parlormaid entering the room.Her uniform was not as overtly sexy as most of the ones in Madame Ping's wardrobe department; the client was sophisticated.The woman was Chinese, but she played the role with the mid Atlantic accent currently in vogue among neo Victorians: "Mrs.Braithwaite will see you now. "The client stepped into an adjoining drawing room, where two women awaited him: a heavy Anglo in late middle age and a very attractive Eurasian woman, about thirty.Introductions were performed: The old woman was Mrs.Braithwaite, and the younger woman was her daughter.Mrs.was somewhat addled, and Miss was obviously running the show.This section of the script never changed, and Nell had been over it a hundred times trying to troubleshoot it.The client went through a little speech in which he informed Mrs.Braithwaite that her son Richard had been killed in action, displaying great heroism in the process, and that he was recommending him for a posthumous Victoria Cross.Nell had already done the obvious, going back through the Times archives to see whether this was a reconstruction of an actual event in the client's life.As far as she could determine, it was more like a composite of many similar events, perhaps with a dollop of fantasy thrown in.At this point, the old lady got a case of the vapors and had to be helped from the room by the parlormaid and other servants, leaving the client alone with Miss Braithwaite, who was taking the whole thing quite stoically."Your composure is admirable, Miss Braithwaite," said the client, "but please be assured that no one will blame you for giving vent to your emotions at such a time. "When the client spoke this line, there was an audible tremor of excitement in his voice."Very well, then," said Miss Braithwaite.She withdrew a small black box from her reticule and pressed a button.The client grunted and arched his back so violently that he fell out of his chair onto the rug, where he lay paralyzed."Mites you have infected my body with some insidious nanosite," he gasped."in the tea. ""But that is impossible most mites highly susceptible to thermal damage boiling water would destroy them. ""You underestimate the capabilities of CryptNet, Colonel Napier.Our technology is advanced far beyond your knowledge as you will discover during the next few days!""Whatever your plan is be assured that it will fail!""Oh, I have no plan in particular," Miss Braithwaite said."This is not a CryptNet operation.This is personal.You are responsible for the death of my brother Richard and I will have you show the proper contrition. ""I assure you that I was as deeply saddened "  She zapped him again."I do not want your sadness," she said."I want you to admit the truth: that you are responsible for his death!"She pressed another button, which caused Colonel Napier's body to go limp.She and a maid wrestled him into a dumbwaiter and moved him down to a lower floor, where, after descending via the stairway, they tied him to a rack.This was where the problem came in.By the time they had finished tying him up, he was sound asleep."He did it again," said the woman playing the role of Miss Braithwaite, addressing herself to Nell and anyone else who might be monitoring."Six weeks in a row now. "When Madame Ping had explained this problem to Nell, Nell wondered what the problem was.Let the man sleep, as long as he kept coming and paid his bill.But Madame Ping knew her clients and feared that Colonel Napier was losing interest and might shift his business to some other establishment unless they put some variety into the scenario."The fighting has been very bad," the actress said."He's probably exhausted. ""I don't think it's that," Nell said.She had now opened a private voice channel direct to the woman's eardrum."I think it is a personal change. ""They never change, sweetheart," said the actress."Once they get the taste, they have it forever. ""Yes, but different situations may trigger those feelings at different times of life," Nell said."In the past it has been guilt over the deaths of his soldiers.Now he has made his peace.He has accepted his guilt, and so he accepts the punishment.There is no longer a contest of wills, because he has become submissive. ""So what do we do?""We must create a genuine contest of wills.We must force him to do something he really doesn't want to do," Nell said, thinking aloud.What would fit that bill?"Wake him up," Nell said."Tell him you were lying when you said this wasn't a CryptNet operation.Tell him you want real information.You want military secrets. "Miss Braithwaite sent the maid out for a bucket of cold water and heaved it over Colonel Napier's body.Then she played the role as Nell had suggested, and did it well; Madame Ping hired people who were good at improvisation, and since most of them never actually had to have sex with clients, she had no trouble finding good ones.Colonel Napier seemed surprised, not unpleasantly so, at the script change."If you suppose that I will divulge information that might lead to the deaths of more of my soldiers, you are sadly mistaken," he said.But his voice sounded a little bored and disappointed, and the bio readouts coming in from the nanosites in his body did not show the full flush of sexual excitement that, presumably, he was paying for.They still were not meeting their client's needs.On the private channel to Miss Braithwaite, Nell said, "He still doesn't get it.This isn't a fantasy scenario anymore.This is real.Madame Ping's is actually a CryptNet operation.We've been drawing him in for the last several years.Now he belongs to us, and he's going to give us information, and he's going to keep giving it to us, because he's our slave. "Miss Braithwaite acted the scene as suggested, making up more florid dialogue as she went along.Watching the bio readouts, Nell could see that Colonel Napier was just as scared and excited, now, as he had been on his very first visit to Madame Ping's several years ago (they kept records).They were making him feel young again, and fully alive."Are you connected with Dr.X?"Colonel Napier said."We'll ask the questions," Nell said."I shall do the asking.Lotus, give him twenty for that!"said Miss Braithwajte, and the maid went to work on Colonel Napier with a cane.The rest of the session almost ran itself, which was good for Nell, because she had been startled by Napier's reference to Dr.X and had gone into a reverie, remembering comments that Harv had made about the same person many years ago.Miss Braithwaite knew her job and understood Nell's strategy instantly: the scenario did not excite the client unless there was a genuine contest of wills, and the only way for them to create that contest was to force Napier to reveal real classified information.Reveal it he did, bit by bit, under the encouragement of Lotus's bamboo and Miss Braithwaite's voice.Most of it had to do with troop movements and other minutiae that he probably thought was terribly interesting.Nell didn't."Get more about Dr.X," she said."Why did he assume a connection between CryptNet and Dr.X?"After a few more minutes of whacking and verbal domination, Colonel Napier was ready to spill."Big operation of ours for many years now Dr.X is working in collusion with a high level CryptNet figure, the Alchemist.Working on something they mustn't be allowed to have. ""Don't you dare hold back on me," Miss Braithwaite said.But before she could extract more information about the Alchemist, the building was jolted by a tremendous force that sent thin cracks racing through the old concrete.In the silence that followed, Nell could hear women screaming all over the building, and a crackling, hissing sound as dust and sand sifted out of a fissure in the ceiling.Then her ears began to resolve another sound: men shouting, "Sha!Sha!""I suggest that someone has just breached the wall of your building with an explosive charge," Colonel Napier said, perfectly calm."If you would be so good as to terminate the scenario now and release me, I shall try to make myself useful in whatever is to follow. "Whatever is to follow.The shouting meant simply, "Kill!Kill!"and was the battle cry of the Fists of Righteous Harmony.Perhaps they wanted Colonel Napier.But it was more likely that they had decided to attack this place for its symbolic value as a den of barbarian decadence.Miss Braithwaite and Lotus had already gotten Colonel Napier out of his restraints, and he was pulling on his trousers."That we are not all dead implies that they are not making use of nanotechnological methods," he said professorially."Hence this attack may safely be assumed to originate from a low level neighborhood cell.The attackers probably believe the Fist doctrine that they are immune from all weapons.It never hurts, in these situations, to give them a reality check of some sort. "The door to Napier's room flew open, splinters of blond naked wood hissing across the floor.Nell watched, as though watching an old movie, as Colonel Napier drew a ridiculously shiny cavalry saber from its scabbard and ran it through the chest of the attacking Fist.This one fell back into another, creating momentary confusion; Napier took advantage of it, methodically planting his feet in a rather prissy looking stance, squaring his shoulders, calmly reaching out, as if he were using the saber to poke around in a dark closet, and twitching the point beneath the second Fist's chin, incidentally cutting his throat in the process.A third Fist had gotten into the room by this point, this one bearing a long pole with a knife lashed to the end of it with the gray polymer ribbon peasants used for rope.But as he tried to wheel the weapon around, its butt end got tangled up in the rack to which Napier had lately been tied.Napier stepped forward cautiously, checking his footing as he went, as if he did not want to get any blood on his boots, parried a belated attack, and stabbed the Fist in the thorax three times in quick succession.Someone kicked at the door to Nell's room."Ah," Colonel Napier sighed, when it seemed clear that there were no more attackers in this party, "it is really very singular that I happen to have brought the full dress uniform, as edged weapons are not a part of our usual kit. "Several kicks had failed to open Nell's door, which unlike the ones in the scenario rooms was made of a modern substance and could not possibly be broken in that way.But Nell could hear voices out in the corridor and suspected that contrary to Napier's speculation, they might have nanotech devices of a very primitive sort small explosives, say, capable of blowing doors open.She ditched her long dress, which would only get in the way, and got down on knees and elbows to peer through the crack under the door.There were two pairs of feet.She could hear them conversing in low, businesslike tones.Nell opened the door suddenly with one hand, reaching through with the other to shove a fountain pen into the throat of the Fist standing closest to the door.The other one reached for an old automatic rifle slung over his shoulder.This gave Nell more than enough time to kick him in the knee, which may or may not have done permanent damage but certainly threw him off balance.The Fist kept trying to bring his rifle to bear, as Nell kicked him over and over again.In the end she was able to twist the rifle free from his feeble one handed grasp, whirl it around, and butt him in the head.The Fist with the pen in his neck was sitting on the floor watching her calmly.She aimed the rifle his way, and he held up one hand and looked down and away.His wound was bleeding, but not all that much; she had ruined his week but not hit anything big.She reflected that it was probably a healthy thing for him in the long run to be rid of the superstition that he was immune to weapons.Constable Moore had taught her a thing or two about rifles.She stepped back into her room, locked the door, and devoted a minute or so to familiarizing herself with its controls, checking the magazine (only half full) and firing a single round (into the door, which stopped it) just to make sure it worked.She was trying to suppress a flashback to the screwdriver incident.This frightened her until she realized that this time around she was much more in control of the situation.Her conversations with the Constable had not been without effect.Then she made her way down the corridors and stairwells toward the lobby, slowly gathering a retinue of terrified young women along her way.They passed a few clients, mostly male and mostly European, who had been pulled from their scenario rooms and crudely hacked up by the Fists.Three times she had to fire, surprised each time at how complicated it was.Accustomed to the Primer, Nell had to make allowances when functioning in the real world.She and her followers found Colonel Napier in the lobby, about three quarters dressed, carrying on a memorable edged weapons duel with a couple of Fists who had, perhaps, been left there to keep the path of escape open.Nell considered trying to shoot at the Fists but decided against it, because she did not trust her marksmanship and also because she was mesmerized by the entire scene.Nell would have been dazzled by Colonel Napier if she had not recently seen him strapped to a rack.Still, there was something about this very contradiction that made him, and by extension all Victorian men, fascinating to her.They lived a life of nearly perfect emotional denial a form of asceticism as extreme as that of a medieval stylite.Yet they did have emotions, the same as anyone else, and only vented them in carefully selected circumstances.Napier calmly impaled a Fist who had tripped and fallen, then turned his attention to a new antagonist, a formidable character skilled with a real sword.The duel between Western and Eastern martial arts moved back and forth across the lobby floor, the two combatants staring directly into one another's eyes and trying to intuit the other's thoughts and emotional state.The actual thrusts and parries and ripostes, when they came, were too rapid to be understood.The Fist's style was quite beautiful to watch, involving many slow movements that looked like the stretching of large felines at the zoo.Napier's style was almost perfectly boring: He moved about in a crabbed stance, watched his opponent calmly, and apparently did a lot of deep thinking.Watching Napier at work, watching the medals and braid swinging and glinting on his jacket, Nell realized that it was precisely their emotional repression that made the Victorians the richest and most powerful people in the world.Their ability to submerge their feelings, far from pathological, was rather a kind of mystical art that gave them nearly magical power over Nature and over the more intuitive tribes.Such was also the strength of the Nipponese.Before the struggle could be resolved, a smart flechette, horsefly size, trailing a whip antenna as thick as a hair and as long as a finger, hissed in through a broken window and thunked into the back of the Fist's neck.It did not strike very hard but must have shot some poison into his brain.He sat down quickly on the floor, closed his eyes, and died in that position."Not very chivalrous," Colonel Napier said distastefully."I suppose I have some bureaucrat up on New Chusan to thank for that. "A cautious tour of the building turned up several more Fists who had died in the same fashion.Outside, the same old crowd of refugees, beggars, pedestrians, and cargo carrying bicyclists streamed on, about as undisturbed as the Yangtze.Colonel Napier did not return to Madame Ping's the next week, but Madame Ping did not blame Nell for the loss of his custom.To the contrary, she praised Nell for having correctly divined Napier's wishes and for improvising so well."A fine performance," she said.Nell had not really thought of her work as a performance, and for some reason Madame Ping's choice of words provoked her in a way that kept her awake late that night, staring into the darkness above her bunk.Since she had been very small, she had made up stories and recited them to the Primer, which were often digested and incorporated into the Primer's stories.It had come naturally to Nell to do the same work for Madame Ping.But now her boss was calling it a performance, and Nell had to admit that it was, in a way.Her stories were being digested, not by the Primer, but by another human being, becoming a part of that person's mind.That seemed simple enough, but the notion troubled her for a reason that did not become clear until she had lain half asleep and fretted over it for several hours.Colonel Napier did not know her and probably never would.All of the intercourse between him and Nell had been mediated through the actress pretending to be Miss Braithwaite, and through various technological systems.Nonetheless she had touched him deeply.She had penetrated farther into his soul than any lover.If Colonel Napier had chosen to return the following week and Nell had not been present to make up the story for him, would he have missed her?Nell suspected that he would have.From his point of view, some indefinable essence would have been wanting, and he would have departed unsatisfied.If this could happen to Colonel Napier in his dealings with Madame Ping's, could it happen to Nell in her dealings with the Primer?She had always felt that there was some essence in the book, something that understood her and even loved her, something that forgave her when she did wrong and appreciated what she did right.When she'd been very young, she hadn't questioned this at all; it had been part of the book's magic.More recently she had understood it as the workings of a parallel computer of enormous size and power, carefully programmed to understand the human mind and give it what it needed.Now she wasn't so sure.Princess Nell's recent travels through the lands of King Coyote, and the various castles with their increasingly sophisticated computers that were, in the end, nothing more than Turing machines, had caught her up in a bewildering logical circle.In Castle Turing she had learned that a Turing machine could not really understand a human being.But the Primer was, itself, a Turing machine, or so she suspected; so how could it understand Nell?Could it be that the Primer was just a conduit, a technological system that mediated between Nell and some human being who really loved her?In the end, she knew, this was basically how all ractives worked.The idea was too alarming to consider at first, and so she circled around it cautiously, poking at it from different directions, like a cavewoman discovering fire for the first time.But as she settled in closer, she found that it warmed her and satisfied her, and by the time her mind wandered into sleep, she had become dependent upon it and would not consider going back into the cold and dark place where she had been traveling for so many years.Carl Hollywood returns to Shanghai;  his forebears in the territory of the Lone Eagles;  Mrs.Kwan's teahouse.Heavy rains had come rolling into Shanghai from the West, like a harbinger of the Fists of Righteous Harmony and the thundering herald of the coming Celestial Kingdom.Stepping off the airship from London, Carl Hollywood at once felt himself in a different Shanghai from the one he had left; the old city had always been wild, but in a sophisticated urban way, and now it was wild like a frontier town.He sensed this ambience before he even left the Aerodrome; it leaked in from the streets, like ozone before a thunderstorm.Looking out the windows, he could see a heavy rain rushing down, knocking all the nanotech out of the air and down into the gutters, whence it would eventually stain the Huang Pu and then the Yangtze.Whether it was the wild atmosphere or the prospect of being rained upon, he stopped his porters short of the main exit doors so that he could change hats.The hatboxes were stacked on one of the carts; his bowler went into the smallest and topmost box, which was empty, and then he yanked the largest box out from underneath, popping the stack, and took out a ten gallon Stetson of breathtaking width and sweep, almost like a head mounted umbrella.Casting an eye into the street, where a rushing brown stream carried litter, road dust, choleraridden sewage, and tons of captive nanotech toward the storm drains, he slipped off his leather shoes and exchanged them for a pair of handtooled cowboy boots, made from hides of gaudy reptiles and avians, the pores of which had been corked with mites that would keep his feet dry even if he chose to wade through the gutters.Thus reconfigured, Carl Hollywood stepped out into the streets of Shanghai.As he came out the doors of the Aerodrome, his duster billowed in the cold wind of the storm and even the beggars stepped away from him.He paused to light a cigar before proceeding and was not molested; even the refugees, who were starving or at least claimed to be, derived more enjoyment from simply looking at him than they would have from the coins in his pocket.He walked the four blocks to his hotel, pursued doggedly by the porters and by a crowd of youngsters entranced by the sight of a real cowboy.Carl's grandfather was a Lone Eagle who had ridden out from the crowding and squalor of Silicon Valley in the 1990s and homesteaded a patch of abandoned ranch along a violent cold river on the eastern slope of the Wind River Range.From there he had made a comfortable living as a freelance coder and consultant.His wife had left him for the bright lights and social life of California and been startled when he had managed to persuade a judge that he was better equipped to raise their son than she was.Grandfather had raised Carl Hollywood's father mostly in the out of doors, hunting and fishing and chopping wood when he wasn't sitting inside studying his calculus.As the years went by, they had gradually been joined by like minded sorts with similar stories to tell, so that by the time of the Interregnum they had formed a community of several hundred, loosely spread over a few thousand square miles of nearwilderness but, in the electronic sense, as tightly knit as any small village in the Old West.Their technological prowess, prodigious wealth, and numerous large weapons had made them a dangerous group, and the odd pickup truck driving desperadoes who attacked an isolated ranch had found themselves surrounded and outgunned with cataclysmic swiftness.Grandfather loved to tell stories of these criminals, how they had tried to excuse their own crimes by pleading that they were economically disadvantaged or infected with the disease of substance abuse, and how the Lone Eagles many of whom had overcome poverty or addiction themselves had dispatched them with firing squads and left them posted around the edge of their territory as NO TRESPASSING signs that even the illiterate could read.The advent of the Common Economic Protocol had settled things down and, in the eyes of the old timers, begun to soften and ruin the place.There was nothing like getting up at three in the morning and riding the defensive perimeter in subzero cold, with a loaded rifle, to build up one's sense of responsibility and community.Carl Hollywood's clearest and best memories were of going on such rides with his father.But as they squatted on packed snow boiling coffee over a fire, they would listen to the radio and hear stories about the jihad raging across Xinjiang, driving the Han back into the east, and about the first incidents of nanotech terrorism in Eastern Europe.Carl's father didn't have to tell him that their community was rapidly acquiring the character of a historical theme park, and that before long they would have to give up the mounted patrols for more modern defensive systems.Even after those innovations had been made and the community had mostly joined up with the First Distributed Republic, Carl and his father and grandfather had continued to do things in the old way, hunting elk and heating their houses with wood burning stoves and sitting behind their computer screens in dark rooms late into the night hand tooling code in assembly language.It was a purely male household (Carl's mother had died when he was nine years old, in a rafting accident), and Carl had fled the place as soon as he'd found a way, going to San Francisco, then New York, then London, and making himself useful in theatrical productions.But the older he got, the more he understood in how many ways he was rooted in the place where he grew up, and he never felt it more purely than he did striding down a crowded street in a Shanghai thunderstorm, puffing on a thick cigar and watching the rain dribble from the rim of his hat.The most intense and clear sensations of his life had flooded into his young and defenseless mind during his first dawn patrol, knowing the desperadoes were out there somewhere.He kept returning to these memories in later life, trying to recapture the same purity and intensity of sensation, or trying to get his ractors to feel it.Now for the first time in thirty years he felt the same thing, this time on the streets of Shanghai, hot and pulsing on the edge of a dynastic rebellion, like the arteries of an old man about to have his first orgasm in years.He merely touched base at his hotel, where he stuffed the pockets of his coat with a sheaf of foolscap, a fountain pen, a silver box loaded with cigars like rounds in an ammo clip, and some tiny containers of nanosnuff that he could use to adjust the functioning of his brain and body.He also hefted a heavy walking stick, a real wizard's staff loaded with security aerostats that would shepherd him back to the hotel in the event of a riot.Then he returned once more to the streets, shouldering for a mile through the crowd until he reached a teahouse where he had passed many long nights during his tenure at the Parnasse.Old Mrs.Kwan welcomed him warmly, bowing many times and showing him to his favorite corner table where he could look out on the intersection of Nanjing Road and a narrow side street jammed with tiny market stalls.All he could see now were the backs and buttocks of people in the street, jammed up against the glass by the pressure of the crowd.He ordered a big pot of his favorite green tea, the most expensive kind, picked in April when the leaves were tender and young, and spread out his sheets of foolscap across the table.This teahouse was fully integrated into the worldwide media network, and so the pages automatically jacked themselves in.Under Carl Hollywood's murmured commands they began to fill themselves with columns of animated text and windows bearing images and cine feeds.He took his first sip of tea always the best one withdrew his big fountain pen from his pocket, removed the lid, and touched it to the paper.He began to inscribe commands onto the page, in words and drawings.As he finished the words, they were enacted before him, and as he drew the lines between the boxes and circles, links were made and information flowed.At the bottom of the page he wrote the word MIRANDA and drew a circle around it.It was not connected to anything else in the diagram yet.He hoped that before long it would be.Carl Hollywood worked on his papers late into the night, and Mrs.Kwan continued to replenish his teapot and to bring him little sweets and decorated the edge of his table with candles as night fell and the teahouse darkened, for she remembered that he liked to work by candlelight.The Chinese people outside, separated from him by half an inch of crosslinked diamond, watched with their noses making white ellipses against the pane, their faces glowing in the candlelight like ripe peaches hanging in dark lush foliage.The Hackworths in transit, and in London;  the East End;  a remarkable boatride;  Dramatis Personae;  a night at the theatre.Smooth, fine grained arctic clouds undulated slowly like snow drifts into the distance, a thousand miles looking like the width of a front yard, lit but not warmed by a low apricot sun that never quite went down.Fiona lay on her stomach on the top bunk, looking out the window, watching her breath condense on the pane and then evaporate in the parched air."Father?"she said, very softly, to see if he was awake.He wasn't, but he woke up quickly, as if he'd been in one of those dreams that just skims beneath the surface of consciousness, like an airship clipping a few cloud tops."Yes?""Who is the Alchemist?Why are you looking for him?""I would rather not explain why I'm looking for him.Let us say that I have incurred obligations that want settling. "Her father seemed more preoccupied with the second part of the question than she'd expected, and his voice was steeped in regret."Who is he?"she insisted gently."Oh.Well, my darling, if I knew that, I'd have found him. ""Father!""What sort of a person is he?I haven't been afforded many clues, unfortunately.I've tried to draw some deductions from the sorts of people who are looking for him, and the sort of person I am. ""Pardon me, Father, but what bearing does your own nature have on that of the Alchemist?""More than one knowledgeable sort has arrived at the conclusion that I'm just the right man to find this fellow, even though I know nothing of criminals and espionage and so forth.I'm just a nanotechnological engineer. ""That's not true, Father!You're ever so much more than that.You know so many stories you told me so many, when you were gone, remember?""I suppose so," he allowed, strangely diffident."And I read it every night.And though the stories were about faeries and pirates and djinns and such, I could always sense that you were behind them.Like the puppeteer pulling the strings and imbuing them with voices and personalities.So I think you're more than an engineer.It's just that you need a magic book to bring it out. ""Well ...that's a point I had not considered," her father said, his voice suddenly emotional.She fought the temptation to peer over the edge of the bed and look at his face, which would have embarrassed him.Instead she curled up in her bed and closed her eyes."Whatever you may think of me, Fiona and I must say I am pleasantly surprised that you think of me so favourably to those who despatched me on this errand, I am an engineer.Without being arrogant, I might add that I have advanced rapidly in that field and attained a position of not inconsiderable responsibility.As this is the only characteristic that distinguishes me from other men, it can be the only reason I was chosen to find the Alchemist.From this I infer that the Alchemist is himself a nanotechnological researcher of some sophistication, and that he is thought to be developing a product that is of interest to more than one of the Powers. ""Are you talking about the Seed, Father?"He was silent for a few moments.When he spoke again, his voice was high and tight."The Seed.How did you know about the Seed?""You told me about it, Father.You told me it was a dangerous thing, and that Protocol Enforcement mustn't allow it to be created.And besides ..."Besides what?"She was on the verge of reminding him that her dreams had been filled with seeds for the last several years, and that every story she had seen in her Primer had been replete with them: seeds that grew up into castles; dragon's teeth that grew up into soldiers; seeds that sprouted into giant beanstalks leading to alternate universes in the clouds; and seeds, given to hospitable, barren couples by itinerant crones, that grew up into plants with bulging pods that contained happy, kicking babies.But she sensed that if she mentioned this directly, he would slam the steel door in her face a door that was tantalizingly cracked open at the moment."Why do you think that Seeds are so interesting?"she essayed."They are interesting inasmuch as a beaker of nitroglycerin is interesting," he said."They are subversive technology.You are not to speak of Seeds again, Fiona CryptNet agents could be anywhere, listening to our conversation. "Fiona sighed.When her father spoke freely, she could sense the man who had told her the stories.When certain subjects were broached, he drew down his veil and became just another Victorian gentleman.It was irksome.But she could sense how the same characteristic, in a man who was not her father, could be provocative.It was such an obvious weakness that neither she nor any woman could resist the temptation to exploit it a mischievous and hence tantalizing notion that was to occupy much of Fiona's thinking for the next few days, as they encountered other members of their tribe in London....After a simple dinner of beer and pasties in a pub on the fringes of the City, they rode south across the Tower Bridge, pierced a shallow layer of posh development along the right bank of the river, and entered into Southwark.As in other Atlantan districts of London, Feed lines had been worked into the sinews of the place, coursing through utility tunnels, clinging to the clammy undersides of bridges, and sneaking into buildings through small holes bored in the foundations.The tiny old houses and flats of this once impoverished quarter had mostly been refurbished into toeholds for young Atlantans from all around the Anglosphere, poor in equity but rich in expectations, who had come to the great city to incubate their careers.The businesses on the ground floors tended to be pubs, coffeehouses, and music halls.As father and daughter worked their way east, generally paralleling the river, the lustre that was so evident near the approaches to the bridge began to wear thin in places, and the ancient character of the neighborhood began to assert itself, as the bones of the knuckles reveal their shape beneath the stretched skin of a fist.Wide gaps developed between the waterfront developments, allowing them to look across the river into a district whose blanket of evening fog was already stained with the carcinogenic candy colored hues of big mediatrons.Fiona Hackworth noticed a glow in the air, which resolved into a constellation when she blinked and focused.A pinprick of green light, an infinitesimal chip of emerald, touched the surface of her eye, expanding into a cloud of light.She blinked twice, and it was gone.Sooner or later it and many others would make their way to the corners of her eyes, giving her a grotesque appearance.She drew a handkerchief from her sleeve and wiped her eyes.The presence of so many lidar emitting mites prompted her to realize that they had been infiltrating a great expanse of fog for some minutes without really being aware of it; moisture from the river was condensing around the microscopic guardians of the border.Colored light flashed vaguely across the screen of fog before them, silhouetting a stone column planted in the center of the road: wings of a gryphon, horn of a unicorn, crisp and black against a lurid cosmos.A constable stood beside the pediment, symbolically guarding the bar.He nodded to the Hackworths and mumbled something gruff but polite through his chinstrap as father and daughter rode out of New Atlantis and into a gaudy dave full of loutish thetes scrumming and chanting before the entrances of pubs.Fiona caught sight of an old Union Jack, then did a double take and realized that the limbs of the St.Andrew's Cross had been enhanced with stars, like the Confederate Battle Flag.She gave her chevaline a nudge and pulled up nearly abreast with her father.Then the city became darker and quieter, though no less crowded, and for a few blocks they saw only dark haired men with mustaches and women who were nothing more than columns of black fabric.Then Fiona smelled anise and garlic, and they passed into Vietnamese territory for a short time.She would have enjoyed stopping at one of the sidewalk cafs for a bowl of pho, but her father rode on, pursuing the tide that was ebbing down the Thames, and in a few more minutes they had come once again to the bank.It was lined with ancient masonry warehouses a category of structure now so obsolete as to defy explanation which had been converted into offices.A pier rode on the surface of the river, riding up and down on the tide, linked to the rim of the granite embankment by a hinged gangway.A shaggy black vessel was tied up to the pier, but it was completely unlit, visible only by its black shadow against the charcoal gray water.After the chevalines had planted themselves and the Hackworths had dismounted, they were able to hear low voices coming from below.John Hackworth withdrew some tickets from his breast pocket and asked them to illuminate themselves; but they were printed on old fashioned paper that did not contain its own energy source, and so he finally had to use the microtorch dangling from his watch chain.Apparently satisfied that they had arrived at the right place, he offered Fiona his arm and escorted her down the gangway to the pier.A tiny flickering light bobbed toward them and resolved into an Afro Caribbean man, wearing rimless glasses and carrying an antique hurricane lamp.Fiona watched his face as his enormous eyes, yellowed like antique ivory billiard balls, scanned their tickets.His skin was rich and warm and glowing in the light of the candle, and he smelled faintly of citrus combined with something darker and less ingratiating.When he was finished, he looked up, not at the Hackworths but off into the distance, turned his back, and ambled away.John Hackworth stood there for a few moments, awaiting instructions, then straightened, squared his shoulders, and led Fiona across the pier to the boat.It was eight or ten meters long.There was no gangway, and persons already on board had to reach out and clutch their arms and pull them in, a breach of formality that happened so quickly that they had no time to become uncomfortable.The boat was basically a large flat open tub, not much more than a liferaft, with some controls in the bow and some sort of modern and hence negligibly small propulsion system built into the stern.As their eyes adjusted to the dim light scattering through the fog, they could see perhaps a dozen other passengers around the edge of the boat, seated so that wakes from passing vessels would not upset them.Seeing wisdom in this, John led Fiona to the only remaining open space, and they sat down between two other groups: a trio of young Nipponese men forcing cigarettes on one another, and a man and woman in bohemian but expensive clothes, sipping lager from cans and conversing in Canadian accents.The man from the pier cast off the painters and vaulted aboard.Another functionary had taken the controls and gently accelerated into the current, cutting the throttle at one point and swinging her about into an oncoming wake.When the boat entered the main channel and came up to speed, it very quickly became chilly, and all the passengers murmured, demanding more warmth from their thermogenic clothing.The AfroCaribbean man made a circuit lugging a heavy chest stocked with cans of lager and splits of pinot noir.Conversation stopped for several minutes as the passengers, all driven by the same primal impulses, turned their faces into the cool wind and relaxed into the gentle thumping of hull against waves.The trip took the better part of an hour.After several minutes, conversation resumed, most of the passengers remaining within their little groups.The refreshment chest made a few more circuits.John Hackworth began to realize, from a few subtleties, that one of the Nipponese youths was much more intoxicated than he was letting on and had probably spent a few hours in a dockside pub before reaching the pier.He took a drink from the chest every time it came by, and half an hour into the ride, he rose unsteadily to his feet, leaned over the edge, and threw up.John turned to smirk at his daughter.The boat struck an unseen wave, rolling sideways into the trough.Hackworth clutched first at the railing and then at his daughter's arm.Fiona screamed.She was staring over John's shoulder at the Nipponese youths.John turned around to see that there were only two of them now; the sick one was gone, and the other two had flung their bellies across the gunwhale and stretched out their arms, fingers like white rays shining into the black water.John felt Fiona's arm pull free from his grasp, and as he turned toward her, he just saw her vaulting over the rail.It was over before he had an opportunity to get really scared.The crew dealt with the matter with a practiced efficiency that suggested to Hackworth that the Nipponese man was really an actor, the entire incident part of the production.The Afro Caribbean man cursed and shouted for them to hang on, his voice pure and powerful as a Stradivarius cello, a stage voice.He inverted the cooler, dumping out all the beer and wine, then snapped it shut and flung it over the stern as a life preserver.Meanwhile the pilot was swinging the boat round.Several passengers, including Hackworth, had turned on microtorches and focused their beams on Fiona, whose skirts had inflated as she'd jumped in feet first and now surrounded her like a raft of flowers.With one hand she was clutching the Nipponese man's collar, and with the other, the handle of the ice chest.She did not have the strength or buoyancy to hold the drunken man out of the water, and so both of them were swamped by the estuary's rolling waves.The man with the dreadlocks hauled Fiona out first and handed her off to her father.The fabricules making up her clothing countless mites linked elbow to elbow in a two dimensional array went to work pumping away the water trapped in the interstices.Fiona was wreathed in a sinuous veil of mist that burned with the captured light of the torches.Her thick red hair had been freed from the confines of her hat, which had been torn away by the waves and now fell about her in a cape of fire.She was looking defiantly at Hackworth, whose adrenal glands had finally jumped into the endocrinological fray.When he saw his daughter in this way, it felt as though someone were inexorably sliding a hundred pound block of ice up the length of his spine.When the sensation reached his medulla, he staggered and nearly had to sit down.She had somehow flung herself through an unknown and unmarked barrier and become supernatural, a naiad rising from the waves cloaked in fire and steam.In some rational compartment of his mind that had now become irrelevant, Hackworth wondered whether Dramatis Personae (for this was the name of the troupe that was running this show) had got some nanosites into his system, and if so what exactly they were doing to his mind.Water streamed from Fiona's skirts and ran between the floorboards, and then she was dry, except for her face and hair.She wiped her face on her sleeves, ignoring her father's proffered handkerchief.No words passed between them, and they did not embrace, as if Fiona were conscious now of the impact she was having upon her father and all the others a faculty that, Hackworth supposed, must be highly acute in sixteen year old girls.By now the Nipponese man was just about finished coughing water out of his lungs and gasping piteously for air.As soon as he had the airways up and running, he spoke hoarsely and lengthily.One of his companions translated."He says that we are not alone that the water is filled with spirits that they spoke to him.He followed them beneath the waves.But feeling his spirit about to leave his body, he felt fear and swam to the surface and was saved by the young woman.He says that the spirits are talking to all of us, and we must listen to them!"This was, needless to say, embarrassing, and so all of the passengers doused their torches and turned their backs on the stricken passenger.But when Hackworth's eyes had adjusted, he took another look at this man and saw that the exposed portions of his flesh had begun to radiate colored light.He looked at Fiona and saw that a band of white light encircled her head like a tiara, bright enough that it shone red through her hair, with a jewel centered upon her forehead.Hackworth marveled at this sight from a distance, knowing that she wanted to be free of him for now.Fat lights hung low above the water, describing the envelopes of great ships, sliding past each other as their parallax shifted with the steady progress of the boat.They had come to a place near the mouth of the estuary but not on the usual shipping lanes, where ships lay at anchor awaiting shifts in tides, winds, or markets.One constellation of lights did not move but only grew larger as they drew toward it.Experimenting with shadows and examining the pattern of light cast upon the water from this vessel, Hackworth concluded that the lights were being deliberately shone into their faces so that they could not make any judgments about the nature of the source.The fog slowly congealed into a wall of rust, so vast and featureless that it might have been ten or a hundred feet distant.The helmsman waited until they were about to ram it, then cut the engines.The raft lost speed instantly and nuzzled the hull of the big ship.Chains, slimy and dripping, descended from the firmament, diverging in Hackworth's view like radiance emanating from some heavy industrial demigod, clanking harbingers of iron that the crew, heads thrown back ecstatically, throats bared to this kinky revelation, received into their bosoms.They snapped the chains onto metal loops fixed into the floor of the boat.Shackled, the boat rose free of the water and began to ascend the wall of rust, which soared vaguely into the infinite fog.Suddenly there was a railing, an open deck beyond it, pools of light here and there, a few red cigar coals reciprocating through space.The deck swung under and rose to shove at the hull of the little boat.As they disembarked, they could see similar boats scattered about."Dodgy" did not begin to describe the reputation of Dramatis Personae in the New Atlantan parts of London, but that was the adjective they always used anyway, delivered in a near whisper, with brows raised nearly into the hairline and eyes glancing significantly over the shoulder.It had quickly become clear to Hackworth that a man could get a bad reputation simply for having known that Dramatis Personae existed at the same time, it was clear that almost everyone had heard about it.Rather than being spattered with any more opprobrium, he had sought the tickets among other tribes.After all this it did not surprise him in the least to see that most of the attendees were fellow Victorians, and not just young bachelors having a night out, but ostensibly respectable couples, strolling the decks in their top hats and veils.Fiona vaulted out of the boat before it even touched the deck of the ship and vanished.She had repatterned her dress, ditching the chintzy flowered pattern for basic white, and skipped off into the darkness, her integral tiara glowing like a halo.Hackworth took a slow turn around the deck, watching his fellow tribesmen trying to solve the following problem: get close enough to another couple to recognize them without getting so close that they can recognize you.From time to time, couples recognized each other simultaneously and had to say something: the women tittered wickedly, and the men laughed from their bellies and called each other scoundrels, the words glancing off the deckplates and burying themselves in the fog like arrows fired into a bale of cotton.Some kind of amplified music emanated from compartments below; atonal power chords came up through the deck like seismic disturbances.She was a bulk cargo carrier, now empty and bobbing, surprisingly jittery for something so big.Hackworth was alone and separate from all humanity, a feeling he had grown up with, like a childhood friend living next door.He had found Gwen by some miracle and lost touch with that old friend for a few years, but now he and solitude were back together, out for a stroll, familiar and comfortable.A makeshift bar amidships had drawn a dozen or so congregants, but Hackworth knew that he could not join in with them.He had been born without the ability to blend and socialize as some are born without hands."Standing above it all?"said a voice."Or standing aside perhaps?"It was a man in a clown outfit.Hackworth recognized it, vaguely, as an advertising fetish for an old American fast food chain.But the costume was conspicuously ill used, as if it were the sole garment of a refugee.It had been patched all over with swatches of chintz, Chinese silk, studded black leather, charcoal gray pinstripe, and jungle camo.The clown wore integral makeup his face glowed like an injection molded plastic toy from the previous century with a light bulb stuck inside the head.It was disturbing to see him talk, like watching one of those animated CAT scans of a man swallowing."Are you of it?Or just in it?"the Clown said, and looked at Hackworth expectantly.As soon as Hackworth had realized, quite some time ago, that this Dramatis Personae thing was going to be some kind of participatory theatre, he had been dreading this moment: his first cue."Please excuse me," he said in a tense and not altogether steady voice, "this is not my milieu. ""That's for damn fucking sure," said the Clown."Put these on," he continued, taking something out of his pocket.He reached out to Hackworth, who was two or three meters away from him but shockingly, his hand detached itself from his arm and flew through the air, the smutty white glove like a dirty ball of ice tumbling elliptically through the inner planets.It shoved something into Hackworth's breast pocket and then withdrew; but because Hackworth was watching, it described a smooth sudden figure eight pattern in space before reattaching itself to the stump of the forearm.Hackworth realized that the clown was mechanical."Put 'em on and be yourself, mister alienated loner steppenwolf bemused distant meta izing technocrat rationalist fucking shithead. "The Clown spun on his heel to leave; his floppy clown shoes were built around some kind of trick heel with a swivel built in, so that when he spun on his heel he really did spin on his heel, performing several complete rotations before stopping with his back turned to Hackworth and storming away."Revolutionary, ain't it?"he snapped.The thing in Hackworth's pocket was a pair of dark sunglasses: wraparounds with a glimmering rainbow finish, the sort of thing that, decades ago, would have been worn by a Magnum slinging rebel cop in a prematurely canceled television series.Hackworth unfolded them and slid the polished ends of the bows cautiously over his temples.As the lenses approached, he could see light coming from them; they were phenomenoscopes.Though in this context, the word phantascope might have been more appropriate.The image grew to fill his sight but would not focus until he put them all the way on, so he reluctantly plummeted into the hallucination until it resolved, and just then the bows behind his ears came alive, stretched, and grew around the back of his skull like a rubber band snapping in reverse, joining in the back to form an unbreakable band."Release," Hackworth said, and then ran through a litany of other standard yuvree commands.The spectacles would not release his head.Finally, a cone of light pierced space from somewhere above and behind him and splashed across a stage.Footlights came up, and a man in a top hat emerged from behind a curtain."Welcome to your show," he said."You can remove the glasses at any time by securing a standing ovation from not less than ninety percent of the audience. "Then the lights and curtain vanished, and Hackworth was left with what he had seen before, namely, a cybernetically enhanced night vision rendering of the deck of the ship.He tried a few more commands.Most phenomenoscopes had a transparent mode, or at least translucent, that allowed the wearer to view what was really there.But these ones were doggedly opaque and would only show him a mediatronic rendering of the scene.The strolling and chatting theatregoers were represented by preposterously oversimplified wireframes, a display technology unused these eighty years or so, clearly intended to irritate Hackworth.Each figure had a large placard strapped to its chest:   JARED MASON GRIFFIN III, aged 35  (too Late to become an interesting character like you!)Nephew of an earl level Equity Lord  (don't you envy him?)Married to that sunken bitch on his right  They go on these little escapades to escape their own crippledlives.(why are you here?)Hackworth looked down and tried to read the placard on his own chest but couldn't focus on it.When he walked around the deck, his viewpoint changed correspondingly.There was also a standard interface that enabled him to "fly" around the ship; Hackworth himself remained in one fixed location, of course, but his viewpoint in the spectacles became unlinked to his real coordinates.Whenever he used this mode, the following legend was superimposed on his view in giant flashing red block letters: JOHN PERCIVAL HACKWORTH'S GODLIKE PERSPECTIVE sometimes accompanied by a cartoon of a wizardly sort of fellow sitting atop a mountain peering down into a village of squalid midgets.Because of this annoyance, Hackworth did not use this feature very frequently.But on his initial reconnaissance, he discovered a few items of interest.For one thing, the Nipponese fellow who had got pissed and fallen overboard had encountered a group of several other people who had, by a remarkable coincidence, also fallen out of their boats on the way here, and who upon being rescued had all begun to emit colored light and see visions that they insisted on recounting to anyone in the vicinity.These people convened into a poorly organized chorus, all shouting at once and articulating visions that seemed to be linked in an approximate way as if they had all just now awakened from the same dream and were all doing an equally bad job describing it.They stuck together despite their differences, drawn together by the same mysterious attractive force that causes streetcorner crackpots to set up their soapboxes right next to each other.Shortly after Hackworth zoomed toward them in his phenomenoscopic view, they began to hallucinate something along the lines of a giant eyeball peering at them from the heavens, the black skin of its eyelids studded with stars.Hackworth skulked away and focused in on another large gathering: a couple of dozen older people of the trim, fit, and active style, tennis sweaters draped over their shoulders and sensible walking shoes firmly but not too tightly laced to their feet, piling off a small airship that had just moored on the old helicopter pad near the ship's stern.The airship had many windows and was festooned with mediatronic advertisements for aerial tours of London.As the tourists climbed off, they tended to stop in their tracks, so that a severe bottleneck was forever forming.They had to be goaded into the outer darkness by their tour guide, a young actress dressed in a cheesy devil outfit, complete with flashing red horns and a trident."Is this Whitechapel?"one of them said to the fog, speaking in an American accent.These people were obviously members of the Heartland tribe, a prosperous phyle closely allied with New Atlantis that had absorbed many responsible, sane, educated, white, Midwestern, middleclass types.Listening in on their furtive conversations, Hackworth divined that these tourists had been brought in from a Holiday Inn in Kensington, under the ruse that they were going to take the Jack the Ripper tour in Whitechapel.As Hackworth listened, the diabolical tour guide explained that their drunken airship pilot had accidentally flown them to a floating theatre, and they were welcome to enjoy the show, which would be starting shortly; a free (to them) performance of Cats, the longest running musical of all time, which most of them had already seen on their first night in London.Hackworth, still peering through the mocking red letters, did a quick scan belowdecks.There were a dozen cavernous compartments down there.Four of them had been consolidated into a capacious theatre; four more served as the stage and backstage.Hackworth located his daughter there.She was seated on a throne of light, rehearsing some lines.Apparently she'd already been cast in a major role."I don't want you to watch me like that," she said, and vanished from Hackworth's display in a burst of light.The ship's foghorn sounded.The sound continued to echo sporadically from other ships in the area.Hackworth returned to his natural view of the deck just in time to see a blazing figment rushing toward him: the Clown again, who apparently possessed the special power of moving through Hackworth's display like a phantasm."Going to stay up here all night, guessing the distance to the other ships by timing the echoes?Or may I show you to your seat?"Hackworth decided that the best thing was not to be ruffled."Please," he said."Well, there it is then," said the Clown, gesturing with one maculated glove toward a plain wooden chair right before them on the deck.Hackworth did not believe it was really there, because he hadn't seen it before now.But the spectacles allowed him no way to tell.He stepped forward like a man making his way to the toilet in a dark and unfamiliar room, knees bent, hands outstretched, moving his feet gingerly so as not to bark shins or toes on anything.The Clown had drawn to one side and was watching him scornfully."Is this what you call getting into your role?Think you can get away with scientific rationalism all night?What's going to happen the first time you actually start believing what you see?"Hackworth found his seat exactly where the display told him it would be, but it wasn't a simple wooden chair; it was foam covered and it had arms.It was like a seat in a theatre, but when he groped to either side, he did not find any others.So he depressed the seat and fell into it."You'll be needing this," the Clown said, and snapped a tubular object into the palm of Hackworth's hand.Hackworth was just recognizing it as some kind of torch when something loud and violent happened just below him.His feet, which had been resting on the deckplates, were now dangling in air.In fact, all of him was dangling.A trap door had flown open beneath him, and he was in free fall."Enjoy the show," the Clown said, tipping his hat and peering down at him through a rapidly diminishing square hole."And while you're accelerating toward the center of the earth at nine point eight meters per second squared, riddle me this: We can fake sounds, we can fake images, we can even fake the wind blowing over your face, but how do we fake the sensation of free fall?"Pseudopods had sprouted from the chair's foam and wrapped around Hackworth's waist and upper thighs.This was fortunate as he had gone into a slow backward spin and soon found himself falling face first, passing through great amorphous clouds of light: a collection of old chandeliers that Dramatis Personae had scavenged from condemned buildings.The Clown was right: Hackworth was definitely in free fall, a sensation that could not be faked with spectacles.If his eyes and ears were to be believed, he was plunging toward the floor of the big theatre he had reconnoitered earlier.But it was not grooved with neat rows of seats like an ordinary theatre.The seats were present but scattered about randomly.And some of them were moving.The floor continued to accelerate toward him until he got really scared and started to scream.Then he felt gravity again as some force began to slow him down.The chair spun around so that Hackworth was looking up into the irregular constellation of chandeliers, and the acceleration shot up to several gees.Then back to normal.The chair rotated so that he was on the level once more, and the phenomenoscope went brilliant, blinding white.The earpieces were pumping white noise at him; but as it began to diminish, he realized it was actually the sound of applause.Hackworth was not able to see anything until he fiddled with the interface and got back to a more schematic view of the theatre.Then he determined that the place was about half full of theatregoers, moving about independently on their chairs, which were somehow motorized, and that several dozen of them were aiming their torches toward him, which accounted for the blinding light.He was on center stage, the main attraction.He wondered if he was supposed to say something.A line was written across his spectacles: Thanks very much, Ladies and gentlemen, for letting me  drop in.We have a great show for you tonight....Hackworth wondered if he was somehow obligated to read this line.But soon the torches turned away from him, as more audience members began to rain down through the astral plane of the chandeliers.Watching them fall, Hackworth realized that he'd seen something like it before at amusement parks: This was nothing more than bungee jumping.It's just that the spectacles had declined to show Hackworth his own bungee cord, just to add an extra frisson to the whole experience.The armrest of Hackworth's chair included some controls that enabled him to move it around the floor of the house, which was coneshaped, sloping sharply in toward the center.A pedestrian would have found difficult footing, but the chair had powerful nanotech motors and compensated for the slope.It was a round theatre, Globe style.The conical floor was encompassed by a circular wall, pierced here and there by openings of different sizes.Some appeared to be ventilation shafts, some were the apertures of private boxes or technical control rooms, and by far the largest was a proscenium that occupied a quarter of the circumference, and that was currently closed off by a curtain.Hackworth noted that the lowest and innermost part of the house floor was not occupied.He motored down the slope and was shocked to realize that he was suddenly up to his waist in painfully chilly water.He threw the chair into reverse, but it did not respond to the controls."Dead in the water!"cried the Clown triumphantly, sounding as if he were standing right there, though Hackworth couldn't see him.He found a way to release the chair's built in restraints and struggled up the raked floor, his legs stiff from the cold and reeking of seawater.Evidently the central third of the floor actually plunged beneath the waterline and was open to the sea another fact that Hackworth's spectacles had not bothered to reveal.Again, dozens of lights were on him.The audience was laughing, and there was even some sarcastic applause.Come on in,  folks, the water 's fine!suggested the spectacles, but once again Hackworth declined to read the line.Apparently these were nothing more than suggestions tossed out by Dramatis Personae's writers, which faded from the display as they lost their currency.The events of the last few minutes the phenomenoscopes that couldn't be taken off, the unexpected bungee jump, the plunge into cold seawater had left Hackworth in a state of shock.He felt a strong need to hole up somewhere and shake off the disorientation.He clambered up toward the perimeter of the house, dodging the occasional moving chair, and tracked by a few spotlight beams from fellow audience members who had taken a particular interest in his personal story.An aperture was above him, glowing with warm light, and passing through it, Hackworth found himself in a cozy little bar with a curving window that afforded an excellent view of the theatre.It was a refuge in more ways than one; he could see normally through the spectacles here, they seemed to be giving him an untampered view of reality.He ordered a pint of stout from the barman and took a seat at the counter along the window.Somewhere around his third or fourth gulp of stout, he realized that he had already submitted to the Clown's imperative.The plunge into the water had taught him that he had no choice but to believe in what the spectades showed his eyes and ears even though he knew it to be false and to accept the consequences.A pint of stout went some distance toward warming up his legs, and toward relaxing his mind.He had come here for a show, and he was getting one, and there was no reason to fight it; Dramatis Personae might have a dodgy reputation, but no one had ever accused them of killing a member of the audience.The chandeliers dimmed.The torch wielding audience went into motion like sparks stirred by a gust of wind, some motoring toward the high ground and others preferring the water's edge.As the house lights faded to black, they amused themselves playing their torches back and forth across the walls and the curtain, creating an apocalyptic sky torn by hundreds of comets.A tongue of clammy, algae colored light shone beneath the water, resolving itself into a long narrow thrust stage as it rose toward the surface, like Atlantis resurgent.The audience noticed it and bounced their spotlights off the surface, catching a few dark motes in the crossfire: the heads of a dozen or so performers, slowly rising out of the water.They began to speak in something like unison, and Hackworth realized that they were the chorus of lunatics he had seen earlier."Set me up, Nick," said a woman's voice behind him."Tucked 'em in, did you?"said the barkeep."Ninnies. "Hackworth turned and saw that it was the young woman in the devil costume who had acted as tour guide for the Heartlanders.She was very petite, dressed in a long black skirt slit all the way to the hipbone, and she had nice hair, very thick and black and glossy.She carried a glass of wheat beer over to the counter, primly swept her devil's tail out of the way in a gesture that Hackworth found hopelessly fetching, and took a seat.Then she let out an explosive sigh and put her head down on her arms for a few moments, her blinking red horns reflecting in the curved window like the taillights of a full laner.Hackworth laced his fingers together around his pint and smelled her perfume.Down below, the chorus had gotten out of hand and was trying to pull off a rather ambitious Busby Berkeley dance number.They showed an uncanny ability to act in unison something to do with the 'sites that had burrowed into their brains but their bodies were stiff, weak, and badly coordinated.What they did, they did with absolute conviction, which made it good anyway."Did they buy it?"Hackworth said."Pardon me?"said the woman, looking up alertly like a bird, as if she hadn't known Hackworth was here."Do those Heartlanders really believe that story about the drunken pilot?""Oh.Who cares?"the woman said.Hackworth laughed, pleased that a member of Dramatis Personae was affording him this confidence."It's off the point, isn't it," the woman said in a lower voice, getting a bit philosophical now.She squeezed a wedge of lemon into her wheat beer and took a sip."Belief isn't a binary state, not here at least.Does anyone believe anything one hundred percent?Do you believe everything you see through those goggles?""No," Hackworth said, "the only thing I believe at the moment is that my legs are wet, this stout is good, and I like your perfume. "She looked a bit surprised, not unpleasantly so, but she wasn't nearly that easy."So why are you here?Which show did you come to see?""What do you mean?I suppose I came to see this one. ""But there is no this one.It's a whole family of shows.Interlaced. "She parked her beer and executed Phase 1 of the here is the church maneuver."Which show you see depends on which feed you're viewing. ""I don't seem to have any control over what I see. ""Ah, then you're a performer. ""So far I have felt like a very inept slapstick performer. ""Inept slapstick?Isn't that a bit redundant?"It wasn't that funny, but she said it wittily, and Hackworth chuckled politely."It sounds as though you've been singled out to be a performer. ""You don't say. ""Now, I don't normally reveal our trade secrets," the woman continued in a lower voice, "but usually when someone is singled out as a performer, it's because they have come here for some purpose other than pure, passive entertainment. "Hackworth stuttered and fumbled for words a bit."Does that is that done?""Oh, yes!"the woman said.She rose from her stool and moved to the one right next to Hackworth."Theatre's not just a few people clowning about on a stage, being watched by this herd of oxen.I mean, sometimes it's that.But it can be ever so much more really it can be any sort of interaction between people and people, or people and information. "The woman had become quite passionate now, forgotten herself completely.Hackworth got boundless pleasure just from watching her.When she'd first entered the bar, he'd thought she had a sort of nondescript face, but as she let her guard down and spoke without any self consciousness, she seemed to become prettier and prettier."We are tied in to everything here plugged into the whole universe of information.Really, it's a virtual theatre.Instead of being hard wired, the stage, sets, cast, and script are all soft they can be reconfigured simply by shifting bits about. ""Oh.So the show or interlaced set of shows can be different each night?""No, you're still not getting it," she said, becoming very excited.She reached out and gripped his forearm just below the elbow and leaned toward him, desperate to make sure he got this."It's not that we do a set show, reconfigure, and a different one next night.The changes are dynamic and take place in real time.The show reconfigures itself dynamically depending upon what happens moment to moment and mind you, not just what happens here, but what is happening in the world at large.It is a smart playan intelligent organism. ""So, if, for example, a battle between the Fists of Righteous Harmony and the Coastal Republic were taking place in the interior of China at this moment, then shifts in the battle might in some way "  "Might change the color of a spotlight or a line of dialogue not necessarily in any simple and deterministic fashion, mind you "  "I think I understand," Hackworth said."The internal variables of the play depend on the total universe of information outside "  The woman nodded vigorously, quite pleased with him, her huge black eyes shining.Hackworth continued, "As, for example, a person's state of mind at any given moment might depend on the relative concentrations of innumerable chemical compounds circulating through his bloodstream. ""Yes," the woman said, "like if you're in a pub being chatted up by a fetching young gentleman, the words coming out of your mouth are affected by the amount of alcohol you've put into your system, and, of course, by concentrations of natural hormones again, not in a simple deterministic way these things are all inputs. ""I think I'm beginning to get your meaning," Hackworth said."Substitute tonight's show for the brain, and the information flowing across the net for molecules flowing through the bloodstream, and you have it," the woman said.Hackworth was a bit disappointed that she had chosen to pull back from the pub metaphor, which he had found more immediately interesting.The woman continued, "That lack of determinism causes some to dismiss the whole process as wanking.But in fact it's an incredibly powerful tool.Some people understand that. ""I believe I do," Hackworth said, desperately wanting her to believe that he did."And so some people come here because they are on a quest of some sort trying to find a lost lover, let's say, or to understand why something terrible happened in their lives, or why there is cruelty in the world, or why they aren't satisfied with their career.Society has never been good at answering these questions the sorts of questions you can't just look up in a reference database. ""But the dynamic theatre allows one to interface with the universe of data in a more intuitive way," Hackworth said."That is precisely it," the woman said."I'm so pleased that you get this. ""When I was working with information, it frequently occurred to me, in a vague and general way, that such a thing might be desirable," Hackworth said."But this is beyond my imagination. ""Where did you hear of us?""I was referred here by a friend who has been associated with you in the past, in some vague way. ""Oh?May I ask who?Perhaps we have a mutual friend," the woman said, as if that would be a fine thing.Hackworth felt himself reddening and let out a deep breath."All right," he said, "I lied.It wasn't really a friend of mine.It was someone I was led to. ""Ah, now we're getting into it," the woman said."I knew there was something mysterious going on with you. "Hackworth was abashed and did not know what to say.He looked into his beer.The woman was staring at him, and he could feel her eqes on his face like the warmth of a follow spot."So you did come here in search of something.Didn't you?Something you couldn't find by looking it up in a database. ""I'm seeking a fellow called the Alchemist," Hackworth said.Suddenly, things got bright.The side of the woman's face that was toward the window was brilliantly illuminated, like a probe in space lit on one side by the directional light of the sun.Hackworth sensed, somehow, that this was not a new development.Looking out over the audience, he saw that nearly all of them were aiming their spotlights into the bar, and that everyone in the place had been watching and listening to his entire conversation with the woman.The spectacles had deceived him by adjusting the apparent light levels.The woman looked different too; her face had reverted to the way it looked when she came in, and Hackworth now understood that her image in his spectacles had been gradually evolving during their conversation, getting feedback from whatever part of his brain buzzed when he saw a beautiful woman.The curtain parted to reveal a large electric sign descending from the fly space: JOHN HACKWORTH in QUEST FOR THE ALCHEMIST starring JOHN HACKWORTH as HIMSELF.The Chorus sang:  He's such a stiff John Hackworth is  Can't show emotion to save his life  With nasty repercussions, viz  He lost his job and lost his wife  So now he's on a goshdarn Quest  Wandering all o'er the world  Hunting down that Alchemist  'Cept when he stops to pick up girls.Maybe he'll clean up his act  And do the job tonight  A fabulous adventure packed  With marvelous sounds and sights  Let's get it on, oh Hacker John  Let's get it on, on, on.Something jerked violently at Hackworth's neck.The woman had tossed a noose around him while he'd been staring out the window, and now she was hauling him out the door of the bar like a recalcitrant dog.As soon as she cleared the doorway, her cape inflated like a time lapse explosion, and she shot twelve feet into the air, propelled on jets of air built into her clothing somehow she payed out the leash so that Hackworth wasn't hanged in the process.Flying above the audience like the cone of fire from a rocket engine, she led the stumbling Hackworth down the sloping floor and to the edge of the water.The thrust stage was linked to the water's edge by a couple of narrow bridges, and Hackworth negotiated one of these, feeling hundreds of lights on his shoulders, seemingly hot enough to ignite his clothing.She led him straight back through the center of the Chorus, beneath the electric sign, through the backstage area, and through a doorway, which clanged shut behind him.Then she vanished.Hackworth was surrounded on three sides by softly glowing blue walls.He reached out to touch one and received a mild shock for his troubles.Stepping forward, he tripped over something that skittered across the floor: a dry bone, big and heavy, larger than a human femur.He stepped forward through the only gap available to him and found more walls.He had been deposited into the heart of a labyrinth.It took him an hour or so to realize that escape through normal means was hopeless.He didn't even try to figure out the labyrinth's floor plan; instead, realizing that it couldn't possibly be larger than the ship, he followed the foolproof expedient of turning right at every corner, which as all clever boys knew must always lead to an exit.But it didn't, and he did not understand why until once, in the corner of his eye, he saw a wall segment shift sideways, closing up an old gap and creating a new one.It was a dynamic labyrinth.He found a rusty bolt on the floor, picked it up, and threw it at a wall.It did not bounce off but passed through and clattered onto the floor beyond.So the walls did not exist except as figments in his spectacles.The labyrinth was constructed of information.In order to escape, he would have to hack it.He sat down on the floor.Nick the barman appeared, walking unhindered through walls, bearing a tray with another stout on it, and handed it to him along with a bowl of salty peanuts.As the evening went on, other people passed through his area, dancing or singing or dueling or arguing or making love.None of these had anything to do, particularly, with Hackworth's Quest, and they appeared to have nothing to do with each other.Apparently Hackworth's Quest was (as the devil woman herself had told him) just one of several concurrent stories being acted out tonight, coexisting in the same space.So what did any of this have to do with the life of John Hackworth?And how was Fiona mixed up in it?As Hackworth thought about Fiona, a panel in front of him slid to the side, exposing several yards of corridor.During the next couple of hours he noted the same thing several times: An idea would occur to him, and a wall would move.In this way he moved in fits and starts through the maze, as his mind moved from one idea to the next.The floor was definitely sloping downward, which would obviously bring him below the waterline at some point; and indeed he had begun to sense a heavy drumming noise coming up through the deckplates, which might have been the pounding of mighty engines except that this ship, as far as he knew, wasn't going anywhere.He smelled seawater before him and saw dim lights shining through its surface, broken by the waves, and knew that in the flooded ballast tanks of this ship lay a network of underwater tunnels, and that in those tunnels were Drummers.For all he knew, the whole show was just a figment being enacted in the mind of the Drummers.Probably not the main event either; it was probably just an epiphenomenon of whatever deep processes the Drummers were running down there in their collective mind.A wall panel slid aside and gave him a clear path to the water.Hackworth squatted at the water's edge for a few minutes, listening to the drums, then stood up and began to undo his necktie....He was terribly hot and sweaty, and bright light was in his eyes, and none of these things were consistent with being underwater.He awoke to see a bright blue sky overhead, pawed at his face, and found that the spectacles were gone.Fiona was there in her white dress, watching him with a rueful smile.The floor was pounding Hackworth on the buttocks and evidently had been for some time, as the bony parts of his backside were bruised and raw.He realized that they were on the raft, heading back toward the London docks; that he was naked and that Fiona had covered him with a sheet of plastic to protect his skin from the sun.A few other theatergoers were scattered about, slumped against one another, utterly passive, like refugees, or people who've just had the greatest sex of their lives, or people who are tremendously hung over."You were quite a hit," Fiona said.And suddenly Hackworth remembered himself being paraded naked and dripping down the thrust stage, waves of applause rolling over him from the standing audience."The Quest is finished," he blurted."We're going to Shanghai. ""You're going to Shanghai," Fiona said."I'll see you off at the dock.Then I'll be going back. "She cocked her head over the stern."Back to the ship?""I was a bigger hit than you were," she said."I've found my calling in life, Father.I've accepted an invitation to join Dramatis Personae. "Carl Hollywood's hack.Carl Hollywood leaned back against the hard lacquered back of his corner seat for the first time in many hours and rubbed his face with both hands, scratching himself with his own whiskers.He had been sitting in the teahouse for almost twenty four hours, consumed twelve pots of tea, and twice called in masseuses to unknot his back.The afternoon light coming in the windows behind him flickered as the crowd outside began to break up.They had been treated to a remarkable free media show, watching over his shoulders for hours as the dramaturgical exploits of John Percival Hackworth had played themselves out, in several different camera angles, on floating cine windows on Carl Hollywood's pages.None of them could read English, and so they had been unable to follow the story of Princess Nell's adventures in the land of King Coyote, which had been streaming across the pages at the same time, the storyline fluctuating and curling in upon itself like a cloud of smoke spun and torn by invisible currents.Now the pages were blank and empty.Carl reached out lazily with one hand and began to stack the sheets on top of each other, just for something to occupy his hands while his mind worked though it wasn't working, at this point, so much as stumbling blindly through a dark labyrinth a la John Percival Hackworth.Carl Hollywood had long suspected that, among other things, the network of the Drummers was a giant system for breaking codes.The cryptographic systems that made the media network run securely, and that made it capable of securely transferring money, were based on the use of immense prime numbers as magic keys.The keys could theoretically be broken by throwing enough computing power at the problem.But at any given level of computing power, code making was always much easier than code breaking, so as long as the system kept moving to larger and larger prime numbers as computers got faster, the code makers could stay far ahead of the code breakers forever.But the human mind didn't work like a digital computer and was capable of doing some funny things.Carl Hollywood remembered one of the Lone Eagles, an older man who could add huge columns of numbers in his head as quickly as they were called out.That, in and of itself, was merely a duplication of something that a digital computer could do.But this man could also do numerical tricks that could not easily be programmed into a computer.If many minds were gathered together in the network of the Drummers, perhaps they could somehow see through the storm of encrypted data that roared continuously through media space, cause the seemingly random bits to coalesce into meaning.The men who had come to talk to Miranda, who had persuaded her to enter the world of the Drummers, had implied that this was possible; that through them, Miranda could find Nell.Superficially, this would be disastrous, because it would destroy the system used for financial transactions.It would be as if, in a world where commerce was based upon the exchange of gold, some person had figured out how to change lead into gold.An Alchemist.But Carl Hollywood wondered if it really made a difference.The Drummers could only do such things by subsuming themselves into a gestalt society.As the case of Hackworth demonstrated, as soon as a Drummer removed himself from that gestalt, he lost touch with it completely.All communication between the Drummers and normal human society took place unconsciously, through their influence upon the Net, in patterns that appeared subliminally in the ractives that everyone played with in their homes and saw playing across the walls of buildings.The Drummers could break the code, but they couldn't take advantage of it in an obvious way, or perhaps they simply did not want to.They could make gold, but they were no longer interested in having it.John Hackworth, somehow, was better than anyone else at making the transition between the society of Drummers and the Victorian tribe, and each time he crossed the boundary, he seemed to bring something with him, clinging to his garments like traces of scent.These faint echoes of forbidden data entrained in his wake caused tangled and unpredictable repercussions, on both sides of the boundary, that Hackworth himself might not even be aware of.Carl Hollywood had known little of Hackworth until several hours ago, when, alerted by a friend in Dramatis Personae, he had joined his story in progress on the black decks of the show boat.Now he seemed to know a great deal: that Hackworth was the progenitor of the Young Lady's Illustrated Primer, and that he had a deep relationship with the Drummers that went far beyond anything as simple minded as captivity.He had not just been eating lotuses and getting his rocks off during his years beneath the waves.Hackworth had brought something back with him this time, when he had emerged naked and streaming with cold seawater from the warren of Drummers in the ballast tanks of the ship.He had emerged with a set of numerical keys that were used to identify certain entities: the Primer, Nell, Miranda, and someone else who went by the name of Dr.X.  Before he had fully reentered his conscious state, he had supplied those keys to the Clown, who had been there to haul his gasping and shivering body out of the water.The Clown was a mechanical device, but Dramatis Personae had been good enough to allow Carl Hollywood to control it and to improvise much of Hackworth's personal script and storyline for the duration of the show.Now Carl had the keys and, for the purposes of the Net, was indistinguishable from Miranda or Nell or Dr.X or even Hackworth himself.They were written out across the surface of a page, long columns of digits grouped in bunches of four.Carl Hollywood told this sheet to fold itself and then tucked it into his breast pocket.He could use them to untangle this whole business, but that would be another night's hack.Snuff and caffeine had done as much as they could.It was time to go back to the hotel, soak in a bath, get some sleep, and prepare for the final act.From the Primer, Princess Nell's ride to the Castle of King Coyote;  description of the castle;  an audience with a Wizard;  her final triumph over King Coyote;  an enchanted army.Princess Nell rode north into an explosive thunderstorm.The horses were driven nearly mad with terror by the cannonlike explosions of the thunder and the unearthly blue flashes of the lightning, but with a firm hand and a soothing voice in the ear, Nell urged them forward.The cairns of bones strewn along the roadside were evidence that this mountain pass was no place to dawdle, and the poor animals would be no less terrified huddling under a rock.For all she knew, the great King Coyote was capable of controlling even the weather itself and had prepared this reception to try Princess Nell's will.Finally she crested the pass, and none too soon, as the horses' hooves had begun to slip on a thick layer of ice, and ice had begun thickly to coat the reins and to weigh down the animals' manes and tails.Working her way down the switchbacks, she left the high fury of the storm behind and pushed into masses of rain as dense as any jungle.It was well that she had paused for a few days at the foot of the mountains to review all of Purple's magic books, for on this night ride through the mountains she used every spell Purple had taught her: spells for casting light, for choosing the right fork in the road, for calming animals and warming chilled bodies, for bolstering her own failing courage, for sensing the approach of any monsters foolish enough to venture out in such weather, and for defeating those desperate enough to attack.This night ride was, perhaps, a rash act, but Princess Nell proved equal to the challenge.King Coyote would not expect her to make such a crossing.Tomorrow when the storm on high had cleared, he would send his raven sentinels winging through the pass and down into the plain below to spy on her, as he had for the last several days, and they would return with dismaying news: The Princess had vanished!Even King Coyote's best trackers would not be able to follow her path from yesterday's campsite, so craftily had she covered her real tracks and laid false ones.Dawn found her in the heart of a great forest.King Coyote's castle was built on a high woodland plateau surrounded by mountains; she estimated she was several hours' ride away.Staying well clear of the high road taken by the messengers from the Cipherers' Market, she made camp under an overhanging rock along a river, sheltered from the chill wet wind and safe from the eyes of the raven sentinels, and lit a tiny fire where she made some tea and porridge.She napped until the middle of the afternoon, then rose, bathed in the bitter water of the stream, and untied the oilcloth packet she had brought with her.It contained one of the costumes worn by the messengers who galloped to and from the Cipherers' Market.It also contained a few books containing enciphered messages authentic ones dispatched from various stalls in the market addressed to King Coyote's castle.As she made her way through the woods toward the high road, she heard massed hoofbeats rolling by and knew that the first contingent of messengers had just come over the pass after waiting for the storm to pass.She waited a few minutes and then followed them.Turning onto the high road out of the dense woods, she reined in her horse and sat for a moment, astonished by her first sight of the Castle of King Coyote.She had never seen its like in all of her travels through the Land Beyond.Its base was as wide as a mountain, and its walls rose sheer and straight into the clouds.Galactic clouds of lights shone from its myriad windows.It was guarded by mighty stockades, each of them a great castle unto itself, but built not on stony foundations, but upon the very clouds themselves; for King Coyote, in his cleverness, had devised a way to make buildings that floated on the air.Princess Nell spurred her horse forward, for even in her numbness she sensed that someone might be watching the high road from a window high in one of the castle's glittering oriels.As she galloped toward the castle, she was torn between a sense of her own foolishness in daring to assault such a mighty fortress and admiration for King Coyote's work.Faint clouds of diaphanous black oozed between the towers and stockades, and as Princess Nell drew closer, she saw that they were actually regiments of ravens going through their military drills.They were the closest thing King Coyote had to an army; for as one of the ravens had told her, after he had stolen the eleven keys from around her neck,  Castles, gardens, gold, and jewels  Contentment signify, for fools  Like Princess Nell; but those  Who cultivate their wit  Like King Coyote and his crows  Compile their power bit by bit  And hide it places no one knows.King Coyote did not preserve his power by armed might but by cleverness, and sentinels were the only army he needed, information his only weapon.As she galloped the final miles to the gate, wondering whether her legs and back would hold out, a thin steam of black issued from a narrow portal high in one of the floating stockades, thickened into a transparent ball, and dove toward her like a plunging comet.She could not help flinching from the illusion of mass and momentum, but, a stone's throw above her head the cloud of ravens parted into several contingents that whirled around and struck from several directions, converging on her, passing around her so closely that the wind from their rattling wings blew her hair back, finally reforming into a disciplined group that returned to its stockade without a look back.Apparently she had passed the inspection.When she reached the mighty gate, it was standing open for her, and no one was guarding it.Princess Nell rode into the broad streets of King Coyote's castle.It was the finest place she had ever seen.Here gold and crystal were not hidden away in the King's treasury but were used as building materials.Green and growing things were everywhere, for King Coyote was fascinated by the secrets of nature and had sent his agents to the farthest reaches of the world to bring back exotic seeds.The wide boulevards of King Coyote's city were lined with trees whose arching limbs closed over the ashlars to form a rustling vault.The undersides of the leaves were silver and seemed to cast a gentle light, and the branches were filled with violet and magenta bromeliads the size of kettles, making a sweet sharp smell, aswarm with ruby throated hummingbirds and filled with water where tiny fluorescent frogs and beetles lived.The Messenger's Route was marked with polished brass plates set among the paving stones.Princess Nell followed it down the grand boulevard, into a park that encircled the city, and then onto a rising street that spiraled around the central promontory.As the horse took her toward the clouds, her ears popped again and again, and from each curve in the road she enjoyed a sweeping view over the lower city and into the constellation of floating stockades where the raven sentinels soared, coming and going in flights and squadrons, bringing news from every corner of the empire.She rode by a place where King Coyote was adding on to the castle; but instead of an army of stonemasons and carpenters, the builder was a single man, a portly gray bearded fellow puffing at a long slender pipe, carrying a leather bag on his belt.Arriving at the center of the building site, he reached into his bag and drew out a great seed the size of an apple and pitched it into the soil.By the time this man had walked back to the spiral road, a tall shaft of gleaming crystal had arisen from the soil and grown far above their heads, gleaming in the sunlight, and branched out like a tree.By the time Princess Nell lost sight of it around the corner, the builder was puffing contentedly and looking at a crystalline vault that nearly covered the lot.This and many other wonders Princess Nell saw during her long ride up the spiral road.The clouds cleared away, and Nell found that she could see great distances in every direction.King Coyote's domain was in the very heart of the Land Beyond, and his castle was built on a high plateau in the center of his domain, so that from his windows he could see all the way to the shining ocean in every direction.Nell kept a sharp eye on the horizon as she climbed toward the King's inner keep, hoping she might get a glimpse of the faraway island where Harv languished in the Dark Castle; but there were many islands in the distant sea, and it was hard to tell the Dark Castle's towers from mountain crags.Finally the road became level and turned inward to pierce another unguarded gate in another high wall, and Princess Nell found herself in a green, flowery court before the King's keep a high palace that appeared to have been hewn from a single diamond the size of an iceberg.By now the sun was sinking low in the west, and its orange rays ignited the walls of the keep and cast tiny rainbows everywhere like shards from a shattered crystal bowl.A dozen or so messengers stood in a queue before the doors of the keep.They had left their horses in a corner of the yard where a watering trough and manger were available.Princess Nell did likewise and joined the queue."I have never had the honor of carrying a message to King Coyote," Princess Nell said to the messenger preceding her in the queue."It is an experience you will never forget," said the messenger, a cocky young man with black hair and a goatee."Why must we wait in this queue?In the stalls at the Cipherers' Market, we leave the books on the table and continue on our way. "Several of the messengers turned and looked back at Princess Nell disdainfully.The messenger with the goatee made a visible effort to control his amusement and said, "King Coyote is no small timer sitting in a stall at the Cipherers' Market!This you will soon see for yourself. ""But doesn't he make his decisions the same way as all the others by consulting rules in a book?"At this the other messengers made no effort to control their amusement.The one with the goatee took on a distinctly sneering tone."What would be the point of having a King in that case?"he said."He does not take his decisions from any book.King Coyote has built a mighty thinking machine, Wizard 0.2, containing all the wisdom in the world.When we bring a book to this place, his acolytes decipher it and consult with Wizard 0.2.Sometimes it takes hours for Wizard to reach its decision.I would advise you to wait respectfully and quietly in the presence of the great machine!""That I will certainly do," said Princess Nell, amused rather than angered by this lowly messenger's impertinence.The queue moved along steadily, and as darkness fell and the orange rays of the sun died away, Princess Nell became aware of colored lights streaming out from within the keep.The lights seemed to be quite brilliant whenever Wizard 0.2 was cogitating and dropped to a low flicker the rest of the time.Princess Nell tried to make out other details of what was going on inside the keep, but the countless facets broke up the light and bent it into all directions so that she could get only hints and fragments; trying to see into King Coyote's inner sanctum was like trying to remember the details of a forgotten dream.Finally the messenger with the goatee emerged, gave Princess Nell a final smirk, and reminded her to display proper respect."Next," intoned the acolyte in a chanting voice, and Princess Nell entered the keep.Five acolytes sat in the anteroom, each one at a desk piled high with dusty old books and long reels of paper tape.Nell had brought thirteen books from the Cipherers' Market, and at their direction, she distributed these books among the acolytes for decipherment.The acolytes were neither young nor old but in the middle of their lives, all dressed in white coats decorated, in golden thread, with the crest of King Coyote.Each also had a key around his neck.As Princess Nell waited, they deciphered the contents of the books she had brought and punched the results onto strips of paper tape using little machines built into their tables.Then, with great ceremony, the thirteen paper tapes were coiled up and placed on a tremendous silver platter carried by a young altar boy.A pair of large doors was swung open, and the acolytes, the altar boy, and Princess Nell formed into a procession of sorts, which marched into the Chamber of the Wizard, a vast vaulted room, and down its long central aisle.At the far end of the chamber was nothing.A sort of large empty space surrounded by elaborate machinery and clockwork, with a small altar at the front.It reminded Princess Nell of a stage, empty of curtains and scenery.Standing next to the stage was a high priest, older and wearing a more impressive white robe.When they reached the head of the aisle, the priest went through a perfunctory ceremony, praising the Wizard's excellent features and asking for its cooperation.As he said these words, lights began to come on and the machinery began to whir.Princess Nell saw that this vault was, in fact, nothing more than an anteroom for a much vaster space within, and that this space was filled with machinery: countless narrow shining rods, scarcely larger than pencil leads, laid in a fine gridwork, sliding back and forth under the impetus of geared power shafts running throughout the place.All of the machinery threw off heat as it ran, and the room was quite warm despite a vigorous draught of cold mountain air being pumped through it by windmill size fans.The priest took the first of the thirteen rolls of paper tape from the platter and fed it into a slot on the top of the altar.At this point, Wizard 0.2 really went into action, and Princess Nell saw that all the whirring and humming she'd seen to this point had been nothing more than a low idle.Each of its million pushrods was tiny, but the force needed to move all of them at once was seismic, and she could sense the tremendous strains on the power shafts and gear boxes thundering through the sturdy floor of the keep.Lights came on around the stage, some of them built into the surface of the stage itself and some hidden in the machinery around it.To Princess Nell's surprise, a seemingly three dimensional shape of light began to coalesce in the center of the empty stage.It gradually formed itself into a head, which took on additional details as the machinery thundered and hissed away: it was an old bald man with a long white beard, his face deeply furrowed in thought.After a few moments, the beard exploded into a flock of white birds and the head turned into a craggy mountain, the white birds swarming about it, and then the mountain erupted in orange lava that gradually filled up the entire volume of the stage until it was a solid glowing cube of orange light.In this fashion did one image merge into another, most astonishingly, for several minutes, and all the time the machinery was screaming away and making Princess Nell most anxious, and she suspected that if she had not seen less sophisticated machines at work at Castle Turing, she might have turned around and fled.Finally, though, the images died away, the stage became empty again, and the altar spat out a length of paper tape, which the priest carefully folded up and handed to one of the acolytes.After a brief prayer of thanks, the priest fed the second tape into the altar, and the whole process started up again, this time with different but equally remarkable images.So it went with one tape after another.When Princess Nell became accustomed to the noise and vibration of the Wizard, she began to enjoy the images, which seemed quite artistic to her like something a human would come up with, and not machinelike at all.But the Wizard was undoubtedly a machine.She had not yet had the opportunity to study it in detail, but after her experiences in all of King Coyote's other castles, she suspected that it, too, was just another Turing machine.Her study of the Cipherers' Market, and particularly of the rulebooks used by the cipherers to respond to messages, had taught her that for all its complexity, it too was nothing more than another Turing machine.She had come here to the Castle of King Coyote to see whether the King answered his messages according to Turing like rules.For if he did, then the entire system the entire kingdom the entire Land Beyond was nothing more than a vast Turing machine.And as she had established when she'd been locked up in the dungeon at Castle Turing, communicating with the mysterious Duke by sending messages on a chain, a Turing machine, no matter how complex, was not human.It had no soul.It could not do what a human did.The thirteenth tape was fed into the altar, and the machinery began to whine, then to whir, and then to rumble.The images appearing above the stage flourished into wilder and more exotic forms than any they had seen yet, and watching the faces of the priest and the acolytes, Princess Nell could see that even they were surprised; they had never seen anything of the like before.As the minutes wore on, the images became fragmented and bizarre, mere incarnations of mathematical ideas, and finally the stage went entirely dark except for occasional random flashes of color.The Wizard had worked itself up to such a pitch that all of them felt trapped within the bowels of a mighty machine that could tear them to shreds in a moment.The little altar boy finally broke away and fled down the aisle.Within a minute or so, the acolytes, one by one, did the same, backing slowly away from the Wizard until they were about halfway down the aisle and then turning away and running.Finally even the high priest turned and fled.The rumbling of the machinery had now reached such a pitch that it felt as though an epochal earthquake were in progress, and Nell had to steady herself with a hand on the altar.The heat coming from back in the machine was like that from a forge, and Nell could see a dim red light from deep inside as some of the pushrods became hot enough to glow.Finally it all stopped.The silence was astonishing.Nell realized she had been cringing and stood up straight.The red glow from inside the Wizard began to die away.White light poured in from all around.Princess Nell could tell that it was coming in from outside the diamond walls of the keep.A few minutes ago it had been nighttime.Now there was light, but not daylight; it came from all directions and was cool and colorless.She ran down the aisle and opened the door to the anteroom, but it wasn't there.Nothing was there.The anteroom was gone.The flowery garden beyond it was gone, and the horses, the wall, the spiral road, the City of King Coyote, and the Land Beyond.Instead there was nothing but gentle white light.She turned around.The Chamber of the Wizard was still there.At the head of the aisle she could see a man sitting atop the altar, looking at her.He was wearing a crown.Around his neck was a key the twelfth key to the Dark Castle.Princess Nell walked down the aisle toward King Coyote.He was a middle aged man, sandy hair losing its color, gray eyes, and a beard, somewhat darker than his hair and not especially well trimmed.As Princess Nell approached, he seemed to become conscious of the crown around his head.He reached up, lifted it from his head, and tossed it carelessly onto the top of the altar."Very funny," he said."You snuck a zero divide past all of my defenses. "Princess Nell refused to be drawn by his studied informality.She stopped several paces away."As there is no one here to make introductions, I shall take the liberty of doing so myself.I am Princess Nell, Duchess of Turing," she said, and held out her hand.King Coyote looked slightly embarrassed.He jumped down from the altar, approached Princess Nell, and kissed her hand."King Coyote at your service. ""Pleased to make your acquaintance. ""The pleasure is mine.Sorry!I should have known that the Primer would have taught you better manners. ""I am not acquainted with the Primer to which you refer," Princess Nell said."I am simply a Princess on a quest: to obtain the twelve keys to the Dark Castle.I note you have one of them in your possession. "King Coyote held up his hands, palms facing toward her."Say no more," he said."Single combat will not be necessary.You are already the victor. "He removed the twelfth key from his neck and held it out to Princess Nell.She took it from him with a little curtsy; but as the chain was sliding through his fingers, he tightened his grip suddenly, so that both of them were joined by the chain."Now that your quest is over," he said, "can we drop the pretense?""I'm sure I don't take your meaning, Your Majesty. "He bore a controlled look of exasperation."What was your purpose in coming here?""To obtain the twelfth key. ""Anything else?""To learn about Wizard 0.2. ""Ah. ""To discover whether it was, in fact, a Turing machine. ""Well, you have your answer.Wizard 0.2 is most certainly a Turing machine the most powerful ever built. ""And the Land Beyond?""All grown from seeds.Seeds that I invented. ""And it is also a Turing machine, then?All controlled by Wizard 0.2?""No," said King Coyote."Managed by Wizard.Controlled by me. ""But the messages in the Cipherers' Market control all the events in the Land Beyond, do they not?"
