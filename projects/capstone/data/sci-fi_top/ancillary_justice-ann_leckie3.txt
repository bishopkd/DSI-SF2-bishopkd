I checked itit was undisturbedput it away, latched my pack closed, thinking the while what my next step should be.Citizen, I said to Seivarden, brisk and authoritative.Breakfast.What?She was surprised enough to stop moving for a moment.I lifted the corner of my lip, just slightly.Shall I ask the doctor to check your hearing?The stringed instrument lay beside me, where I had set it the night before.I picked it up, plucked a fifth.Breakfast.Im not your servant, she protested.Indignant.I increased my sneer, just the smallest increment.Then what are you?She froze, anger visible in her expression, and then very visibly debated with herself how best to answer me.But the question was, now, too difficult for her to answer easily.Her confidence in her superiority had apparently taken too severe a blow for her to deal with just now.She didnt seem to be able to find a response.I bent to the instrument and began to pick out a line of music.I expected her to sit where she was, sullen, until at the very least hunger drove her to prepare her own meal.Or maybe, much delayed, find something to say to me.I found I half hoped shed take a swing at me, so I could retaliate, but perhaps she was still under the influence of whatever Strigan had given her last night, even if only slightly.The door to Strigans room opened, and she walked into the main living space, stopped, folded her arms, and cocked an eyebrow.Seivarden ignored her.None of us said anything, and after five seconds Strigan turned and strode to the kitchen and swung open a cabinet.It was empty.Which Id known the evening before.Youve cleaned me out, Breq from the Gerentate, Strigan said, without rancor.Almost as though she thought it was funny.We were in very little danger of starvingeven in summer here, the outdoors effectively functioned as a huge freezer, and the unheated storage building held plenty of provisions.It was only a matter of fetching some, and thawing them.Seivarden.I spoke in the casually disdainful tone I had heard from Seivarden herself in the distant past.Bring some food from the shed.She froze, and then blinked, startled.Who the hell do you think you are?Language, citizen, I chided.And I might ask you the same question.You you ignorant nobody.The sudden intensity of her anger had brought her close to tears again.You think youre better than me?Youre barely even human.She didnt mean because I was an ancillary.I was fairly sure she hadnt yet realized that.She meant because I wasnt Radchaai, and perhaps because I might have implants that were common some places outside Radch space and that would, in Radchaai eyes, compromise my humanity.I wasnt bred to be your servant.I can move very, very quickly.I was standing, and my arm halfway through its swing, before I registered my intention to move.The barest fraction of a second passed during which I could have possibly checked myself, and then it was gone, and my fist connected with Seivardens face, too quickly for her to even look surprised.She dropped, falling backward onto her pallet, blood pouring from her nose, and lay unmoving.Is he dead?asked Strigan, still standing in the kitchen, her voice mildly curious.I made an ambiguous gesture.Youre the doctor.She walked over to where Seivarden lay, unconscious and bleeding.Gazed down at her.Not dead, she pronounced.Though Id like to make sure the concussion doesnt turn into anything worse.I gestured resignation.It is as Amaat wills, I said, and put on my coat and went outside to bring in food.6   On Shisurna, in Ors, the Justice of Ente Seven Issa who had accompanied Lieutenant Skaaiat to Jen Shinnans sat with me in the lower level of the house.She had a name beyond her designationone I never used, though I knew it.Even Lieutenant Skaaiat sometimes addressed individual human soldiers under her command as merely Seven Issa.Or by their segment numbers.I brought out a board and counters, and we played a silent two games.Cant you let me win a time or two?she asked, when the second was concluded, and before I could answer a thump sounded from the upper floor and she grinned.It looks like Lieutenant Stiff can unbend after all!and she cast me a look intended to share the joke, her amusement at the contrast between Awns usual careful formality and what was obviously going on upstairs between her and Lieutenant Skaaiat.But the instant after Seven Issa had spoken, her smile faded.Im sorry.I didnt mean anything by it, its just what we  I know, I said.I took no offense.Seven Issa frowned, and made a doubtful gesture with her left hand, awkwardly, her gloved fingers still curled around half a dozen counters.Ships have feelings.Yes, of course.Without feelings insignificant decisions become excruciating attempts to compare endless arrays of inconsequential things.Its just easier to handle those with emotions.But as I said, I took no offense.Seven Issa looked down at the board, and dropped the counters she held into one of its depressions.She stared at them a moment, and then looked up.You hear rumors.About ships and people they like.And Id swear your face never changes, but  I engaged my facial muscles, smiled, an expression Id seen many times.Seven Issa flinched.Dont do that!she said, indignant, but still hushed lest the lieutenants hear us.It wasnt that Id gotten the smile wrongI knew I hadnt.It was the sudden change, from my habitual lack of expression to something human, that some of the Seven Issas found disturbing.I dropped the smile.Aatrs tits, swore Seven Issa.When you do that its like youre possessed or something.She shook her head, and scooped up the counters and began to distribute them around the board.All right, then, you dont want to talk about it.One more game.The evening grew later.The neighbors conversations turned slow and aimless and finally ceased as people picked up sleeping children and went to bed.Denz Ay arrived four hours before dawn, and I joined her, stepping into her boat without speaking.She did not acknowledge my presence, and neither did her daughter, sitting in the stern.Slowly, nearly noiselessly, we slid away from the house.The vigil at the temple continued, the priests prayers audible on the plaza as an intermittent shushing murmur.The streets, upper and lower, were silent except for my own footsteps and the sound of the water, dark but for the stars brilliant overhead, the blinking of the prohibited zones encircling buoys, and the light from the temple of Ikkt.The Seven Issa who had accompanied us back to Lieutenant Awns house slept on a pallet on the ground floor.Lieutenant Awn and Lieutenant Skaaiat lay together on the upper floor, still and on the edge of sleep.No one else was out on the water with us.In the bottom of the boat I saw rope, nets, breathers, and a round, covered basket tied to an anchor.The daughter saw me look at it, and she kicked it under her seat, with studied nonchalance.I looked away, over the water, toward the blinking buoys, and said nothing.The fiction that they could hide or alter the information coming from their trackers was a useful one, even if no one actually believed it.Just inside the buoys, Denz Ays daughter put a breather in her mouth and slid over the edge, a rope in her hand.The lake wasnt terribly deep, especially at this time of year.Moments later she reemerged and climbed back aboard, and we pulled the crate upa relatively easy job until it reached the surface, but the three of us managed to tip it into the boat without taking on too much water.I wiped mud off the lid.It was of Radchaai manufacture, but that wasnt too alarming in itself.I found the latch and popped it open.The guns withinlong, sleek, and deadlywere the sort that had been carried by Tanmind troops before the annexation.I knew each one would have an identifying mark, and the marks of any guns confiscated by us would have been listed and reported, so that I could consult the inventory and determine more or less immediately if these were confiscated weapons, or ones we had missed.If they were confiscated weapons, this situation would suddenly become a great deal more complicated than it seemed at the momentand it was already a complicated situation.Lieutenant Awn was in stage one of NREM sleep.Lieutenant Skaaiat seemed to be as well.I could consult the inventory on my own initiative.Indeed, I should.But I didntpartly because I had just been reminded, yesterday, of the corrupt authorities at Ime, the misuse of accesses, the most appalling abuse of power, something any citizen would have thought was impossible.That reminder itself was enough to make me cautious.But also, after Denz Ays assertions about residents of the upper city planting evidence in the past, and the evenings dinner conversation with its clear reminder of resentment in that upper city, something didnt seem quite right.No one in the upper city would know I had requested information about confiscated weapons, but what if someone else was involved?Someone who could set alerts to notify her if certain questions were asked in certain places?Denz Ay and her daughter sat quietly in the boat, to all appearances unconcerned and not particularly eager to be anywhere, or to be doing anything else.Within a few moments I had Justice of Torens attention.I had seen no few of those confiscated weaponsnot I, One Esk, but I, Justice of Toren, whose thousands of ancillary troops had been on the planet during the annexation.If I could not consult an official inventory without alerting an authority to the fact that I had found this cache, I could consult my own memory to see if any of them had passed under my own eyes.And they had.I went in to where Lieutenant Awn was sleeping and put a hand on her bare shoulder.Lieutenant, I said, softly.In the boat I closed the crate with a soft snap and said, Back to the city.Lieutenant Awn jerked awake.Im not asleep, she said blearily.In the boat, Denz Ay and her daughter silently picked up their oars and started back.The weapons were confiscated, I said to Lieutenant Awn, still quiet.Not wanting to wake Lieutenant Skaaiat, not wanting anyone else to hear what I was saying.I recognized the serial numbers.Lieutenant Awn looked at me dazedly for a few moments, uncomprehending.Then I saw her understand.But And then she woke fully, and turned to Lieutenant Skaaiat.Skaaiat, wake up.Ive got a problem.I brought the guns to the upper level of Lieutenant Awns house.Seven Issa didnt even stir when I went past.Youre sure?asked Lieutenant Skaaiat, kneeling by the open crate, naked but for gloves, a bowl of tea in one hand.I confiscated these myself, I answered.I remember them.We were all speaking very quietly, so that no one outside could hear.Then they would have been destroyed, argued Lieutenant Skaaiat.Obviously they werent, said Lieutenant Awn.And then, after a brief silence, Oh, shit.This is not good.Silently I messaged her.Language, Lieutenant.Lieutenant Skaaiat made a short, breathy sound, unamused laughter.To put it mildly.She frowned.But why?Why would anyone go to the trouble?And how?asked Lieutenant Awn.She seemed to have forgotten her own tea, in a bowl on the floor beside her.They put them there without us seeing them.Id looked at the logs for the past thirty days and seen nothing I couldnt already account for.Indeed, no one had been to that spot at all besides Denz Ay and her daughter thirty days ago, and just the other night.How is the easy part, if youve got the right accesses, said Lieutenant Skaaiat.Which might tell us something.Its not someone whos got high level access to Justice of Toren, or theyd have made sure it didnt remember these guns.Or at least couldnt say it did.Or they didnt think of that particular detail, suggested Lieutenant Awn.She was puzzled.And only beginning to be frightened.Or maybe thats part of the plan to begin with.But were back to why, arent we?It doesnt much matter how, not right this moment.Lieutenant Skaaiat looked up at me.Tell me about the trouble Jen Taas niece had in the lower city.Lieutenant Awn looked at her, frowning.But Lieutenant Skaaiat shushed her with a gesture.There was no trouble, I said.She sat by herself and threw rocks in the Fore Temple water.She bought some tea in the shop behind the temple.Beyond that, no one spoke to her.Youre certain?asked Lieutenant Awn.She was in my view the entire time.And I would take care that she would be on any future visits, but that hardly needed saying.The two lieutenants were silent a moment.Lieutenant Awn closed her eyes and took a deep breath.She was now truly frightened.Theyre lying about that, she said, eyes still closed.They want some excuse to accuse someone in the lower city of something.Sedition, Lieutenant Skaaiat said.She remembered her tea, and took a sip.And getting above themselves.Thats easy enough to see.Yes, I can see that, said Lieutenant Awn.Her accent had slipped entirely, but she hadnt noticed.But why the hell would anyone with this sort of accessshe gestured at the crate of gunswant to help them?That would seem to be the question, answered Lieutenant Skaaiat.They were silent for several seconds.What are you going to do?The question upset Lieutenant Awn, who presumably had been wondering just that.She looked up at me.I wonder if this is all.I can ask Denz Ay to take me out again, I said.Lieutenant Awn gestured affirmatively.Ill write the report, but I wont file it just yet.Pending our further investigation.Everything Lieutenant Awn did and said was observed and recordedbut as with the trackers everyone in Ors wore, there wasnt always someone paying attention.Lieutenant Skaaiat made a low whistle.Is someone setting you up, dear?Lieutenant Awn looked incomprehension at her.Like maybe, Lieutenant Skaaiat continued, Jen Shinnan?I may have underestimated her.Or can you trust Denz Ay?If someone wants me gone, theyre in the upper city, said Lieutenant Awn, and privately I agreed but I didnt say it.But that cant be it.If anyone who could do this, she gestured at the crate, wanted me out of here, it would be easy enoughjust give the order.And Jen Shinnan couldnt have done this.Unspoken, hanging behind every word, was the memory of news from Ime.Of the fact that the person who had revealed the corruption there was condemned to die, probably was already dead.No one in Ors could have, not without Not without help, from a very high level, she would surely have said, but she let the sentence trail off.True, mused Lieutenant Skaaiat.Understanding her.So its someone high up.Who would benefit?The niece, said Lieutenant Awn, distressed.Jen Taas niece would benefit?asked Lieutenant Skaaiat, puzzled.No, no.The niece is insulted or assaultedallegedly.I wont do anything, I say nothing happened.Because nothing happened, said Lieutenant Skaaiat, looking as though something was beginning to come clear to her, but still puzzled.They cant get justice from me, so they come down to the lower city to get it for themselves.Its the sort of thing that happened before we came.And afterward, said Lieutenant Skaaiat, they find all these guns.Or even during.Or She shook her head.Its not all fitting together.Lets say youre right.Still.Who benefits?Not the Tanmind, not if they cause trouble.They can accuse all they like, but no matter what anyone finds in the lake, theyre still for reeducation if they riot.Lieutenant Awn gestured doubtfully.Someone who could get those guns here without our seeing them might be able to keep the Tanmind out of trouble.Or believably say they could.Ah.Lieutenant Skaaiat understood immediately.A minor fine, mitigating circumstances.No doubt of it.Itll be someone high up.Very dangerous.But why?Lieutenant Awn looked at me.Go to the head priest and ask her a favor.Tell her, from me, even though its not the rainy season, to station someone near the storm alarm at all times.The alarm, an earsplitting siren, was on the top of the temple residence.Its sounding would trigger the storm shutters of most of the buildings in the lower city, and would certainly wake the inhabitants of any building not automated in that fashion.Ask her to be ready to sound it if I ask.Excellent, said Lieutenant Skaaiat.Any mob will at least have to work a bit harder to get past the shutters.And then?It might not even happen, said Lieutenant Awn.Whatever it is, well have to take it as it comes.What came, the next morning, was news that Anaander Mianaai, Lord of the Radch, would be visiting us some time in the next few days.For three thousand years Anaander Mianaai had ruled Radch space absolutely.She resided in each of the thirteen provincial palaces, and was present at every annexation.She was able to do this because she possessed thousands of bodies, all of them genetically identical, all of them linked to each other.She was still in Shisurnas system, some of her on the flagship of this annexation, Sword of Amaat, and some of her on Shisurna Station.It was she who made Radchaai law, and she who decided on any exceptions to that law.She was the ultimate commander of the military, the highest head priest of Amaat, the person to whom, ultimately, all Radchaai houses were clients.And she was coming to Ors, at some unspecified date within the next few days.It was, in fact, mildly surprising she hadnt visited Ors soonersmall as it was, far as Orsians had fallen from their former glory, still the yearly pilgrimage made Ors a moderately important place.Important enough that officers of higher families and more influence than Lieutenant Awn had wanted this postand tried continually to pry her out of it, despite the determined resistance of the Divine of Ikkt.So the visit itself wasnt unexpected.Though the timing seemed odd.It was two weeks before the start of the pilgrimage, when hundreds of thousands of Orsians and tourists would pass through the city.During pilgrimage Anaander Mianaais presence would be highly visible, an opportunity to impress a high number of the worshippers of Ikkt.Instead she was coming just before.And of course it was impossible not to notice the sharp coincidence between her arrival and the discovery of the guns.Whoever had placed those guns was acting either for or against the interests of the Lord of the Radch.She should have been the one logical person to tell, and to ask for further instructions.And her being in Ors in person was incredibly convenientit presented an opportunity to tell her about the situation without anyone else intercepting the message and either spoiling whatever the plan was, or alerting wrongdoers that their plan had been discovered, making them harder to catch.On that account alone, Lieutenant Awn was relieved to hear of her visit.Even though for the next few days, and while she was here, Lieutenant Awn would have to wear her full uniform.In the meantime I listened more closely to conversations in the upper citymore difficult than in the lower, because the houses were all enclosed and of course any Tanmind involved would be closemouthed if they knew I was in earshot.And no one was foolish enough to have the sort of conversation I was listening for anywhere but in person, in private.I also watched Jen Taas nieceor as well as I could.After the dinner party she never left Jen Shinnans house, but I could see her tracker data.For two nights I went out on the marsh with Denz Ay and her daughter, and we found two more crates of guns.Once again I had no way of determining who had left them, or when, though Denz Ays oblique statements, careful not to implicate the fishermen I knew usually poached in those areas, implied that they must have arrived some time in the past month or two.Ill be glad when the Lord of Mianaai gets here, said Lieutenant Awn to me, quietly, late one night.I dont think I should be handling something like this.And in the meantime I noticed that no one but Denz Ay went out on the water at night, and in the lower city no one sat or lay where the shutters might come downa routine precaution during the rainy season, even though there were safeties to stop them if someone was in their way, but one that was usually ignored in the dry season.The Lord of the Radch arrived in the middle of the day, on foot, a single one of her walking down through the upper city, no trace of her in the tracker logs, and went straight to the temple of Ikkt.She was old, gray haired, broad shoulders slightly stooping, the almost black skin of her face linedwhich accounted for the lack of guards.The loss of one body that was more or less near death anyway would not be a large one.The use of such older bodies allowed the Lord of the Radch to walk unprotected, without any sort of entourage, when she wished, without much risk.She wore not the jeweled coat and trousers of the Radchaai, nor the coverall or trousers and shirt a Shisurnan Tanmind would wear, but instead the Orsian lungi, shirtless.As soon as I saw her, I messaged Lieutenant Awn, who came as quickly as she could to the temple, and arrived while the head priest was prostrating herself in the plaza before the Lord of the Radch.Lieutenant Awn hesitated.Most Radchaai were never in the personal presence of Anaander Mianaai in such circumstances.Of course she was always present during annexations, but the sheer number of troops compared to the number of bodies the Lord of the Radch sent made it unlikely one would run into her by chance.And any citizen can travel to one of the provincial palaces and ask for an audiencefor a request, for an appeal in a legal case, for whatever reasonbut in such a case, an ordinary citizen is briefed beforehand on how to conduct herself.Perhaps someone like Lieutenant Skaaiat would know how to draw Anaander Mianaais attention to herself without breaching propriety, but Lieutenant Awn did not.My lord, Lieutenant Awn said, heart speeding with fear, and knelt.Anaander Mianaai turned to her, eyebrow raised.I beg my lords pardon, said Lieutenant Awn.She was slightly dizzy, either from the weight of her uniform in the heat, or from nerves.I must speak with you.The eyebrow rose farther.Lieutenant Awn, she said, yes?Yes, my lord.This evening I attend the vigil in the temple of Ikkt.Ill speak to you in the morning.It took Lieutenant Awn a few moments to digest this.My lord, a moment only.I dont think thats a good idea.The Lord of the Radch tilted her head inquisitively.I understood you had this area under control.Yes, lord, its just Lieutenant Awn stopped, panicked, at a loss for words for a second.Relations between the upper and lower city just now She halted again.Concern yourself with your own job, said Anaander Mianaai.And I will concern myself with mine.She turned away from Lieutenant Awn.A public slight.An inexplicable onethere was no reason the Lord of the Radch could not have turned aside for a few urgent words with the officer who was chief of local security.And Lieutenant Awn had done nothing to deserve such a slight.At first I thought that was the only reason for the distress I read coming from Lieutenant Awn.The matter of the guns could be communicated in the morning just as well as now, and there seemed no other difficulty.But as the Lord of the Radch had walked through the upper city, word of Anaander Mianaais presence had spread, as of course it would, and the residents of the upper city had come out of their houses and begun gathering on the northern edge of the Fore Temple water to watch the Lord of the Radch, dressed like an Orsian, stand in front of the temple of Ikkt with the Divine.And listening to the mutterings of the watching Tanmind, I realized that at this particular instant the guns were only a secondary concern.The Tanmind residents of the upper city were wealthy, well fed, the owners of shops and farms and tamarind orchards.Even in the precarious months following the annexation, when supplies had been scarce and food expensive, they had managed to keep their families fed.When Jen Shinnan had said, a few evenings earlier, that no one here had starved, she had likely believed that to be true.She had not, nor had anyone she knew well, nearly all of them wealthy Tanmind.As much as they complained, they had come out of the annexation relatively comfortably.And their children did well when they took the aptitudes, and would continue to do so, as Lieutenant Skaaiat had said.And yet these same people, when they saw the Lord of the Radch walk straight through the upper city to the temple of Ikkt, concluded that this gesture of respect to the Orsians was a calculated insult to them.This was clear in their expressions, in their indignant exclamations.I had not foreseen it.Perhaps the Lord of the Radch had not foreseen it.But Lieutenant Awn had realized it would happen, when she saw the Divine on the ground in front of the Lord of the Radch.I left the plaza, and some of the upper city streets, and went to where the Tanmind were standing, a half dozen of me.I didnt draw any weapons, didnt make any threats.I said, merely, to anyone near me, Go home, citizens.Most turned away and left, and if their expressions werent pleasant, they offered no actual protest.Others took longer to leave, testing my authority, perhaps, though not faranyone with the stomach to do such a thing had been shot sometime in the last five years, or at least had learned to restrain such a near suicidal impulse.The Divine, rising to escort Anaander Mianaai into the temple, cast an unreadable look at Lieutenant Awn, where she still knelt on the plaza stones.The Lord of the Radch did not even glance at her.7   And then, Strigan said as we ate, latest in a long list of grievances against the Radchaai, theres the treaty with the Presger.Seivarden lay still, eyes closed, breathing even, blood caked on her lip and chin, spattered on the front of her coat.Across her nose and forehead lay a corrective.You resent the treaty?I asked.Youd prefer the Presger felt free to do as they always have done?The Presger didnt care if a species was sentient or not, conscious or not, intelligent or not.The word they usedor the concept, at any rate, as I understood they didnt speak in wordswas usually translated as significance.And only the Presger were significant.All other beings were their rightful prey, property, or playthings.Mostly they just didnt care about humans, but some of them liked to stop ships and pull themand their contentsapart.Id prefer the Radch not make binding promises on behalf of all humanity, Strigan answered.Not dictate policy for every single human government and then tell us were supposed to be grateful.The Presger dont recognize such divisions.It was all or none.It was the Radch extending control yet another way, one cheaper and easier than outright conquest.It might surprise you to learn that some high ranking Radchaai dislike the treaty as much as you do.Strigan raised an eyebrow, set down her cup of stinking fermented milk.Somehow I doubt Id find these high ranking Radchaai sympathetic.Her tone was bitter, slightly sarcastic.No, I answered.I dont think youd like them much.They certainly wouldnt have much use for you.She blinked and looked intently at my face, as though trying to read something from my expression.Then she shook her head and made a dismissing gesture.Do tell.When one is the agent of order and civilization in the universe, one doesnt stoop to negotiate.Especially with nonhumans.Which included quite a number of people who considered themselves human, but that was a topic best left undiscussed just now.Why make a treaty with such an implacable enemy?Destroy them and be done.Could you?Strigan asked, incredulous.Could you have destroyed the Presger?No.She folded her arms, leaned back in her chair.So why any debate at all?I would think it was obvious, I answered.Some find it difficult to admit the Radch might be fallible, or that its power might have limits.Strigan glanced across the room, toward Seivarden.But this is meaningless.Debate.Theres no real debate possible.Certainly, I agreed.Youre the expert.Oh ho!she exclaimed, sitting straighter.Ive made you angry.I was sure I hadnt changed my expression.I dont think youve ever been to the Radch.I dont think you know many Radchaai, not personally.Not well.You look at it from the outside, and you see conformity and brainwashing.Rank on rank of identical silver armored soldiers, with no wills of their own, no minds of their own.And its true the lowest Radchaai thinks herself immeasurably superior to any noncitizen.What people like Seivarden think of themselves is past bearing.Strigan made a brief, amused snort.But they are people, and they do have different opinions about things.Opinions that dont matter.Anaander Mianaai declares what will be, and thats how it is.That was a more complicated issue than she realized, I was certain.Which only adds to their frustration.Imagine.Imagine your whole life aimed at conquest, at the spread of Radchaai space.You see murder and destruction on an unimaginable scale, but they see the spread of civilization, of Justice and Propriety, of Benefit for the universe.The death and destruction, these are unavoidable by products of this one, supreme good.I dont think I can muster much sympathy for their perspective.I dont ask it.Only stand there a moment, and look.Not only your life, but the lives of all your house, and your ancestors for a thousand years or more before you, are invested in this idea, these actions.Amaat wills it.God wills it, the universe itself wills all this.And then one day someone tells you maybe you were mistaken.And your life wont be what you imagined it to be.Happens to people all the time, said Strigan, rising from her seat.Except most of us dont delude ourselves that we ever had great destinies.The exception is not an insignificant one, I pointed out.And you?She stood beside the chair, her cup and bowl in her hands.Youre certainly Radchaai.Your accent, when you speak Radchaaiwe were speaking her own native languagesounds like youre from the Gerentate.But you have almost no accent right now.You might just be very good with languagesinhumanly good, I might even say She paused.The gender thing is a giveaway, though.Only a Radchaai would misgender people the way you do.Id guessed wrong.I cant see under your clothes.And even if I could, thats not always a reliable indicator.She blinked, hesitated a moment as though what Id said made no sense to her.I used to wonder how Radchaai reproduced, if they were all the same gender.Theyre not.And they reproduce like anyone else.Strigan raised one skeptical eyebrow.They go to the medic, I continued, and have their contraceptive implants deactivated.Or they use a tank.Or they have surgery so they can carry a pregnancy.Or they hire someone to carry it.None of it was very different from what any other kind of people did, but Strigan seemed slightly scandalized.Youre certainly Radchaai.And certainly very familiar with Captain Seivarden, but youre not like him.I wondered from the start if you were an ancillary, but I dont see much in the way of implants.Who are you?She would have to look a good deal closer than she already had to see evidence of what I wasto a casual observer I looked as though I had one or two communications and optical implants, the sort of thing millions of people got as a matter of course, Radchaai or not.And during the last twenty years Id found ways of concealing the specifics of what I had.I picked up my own dishes, rose.Im Breq, from the Gerentate.Strigan snorted, disbelieving.The Gerentate was far enough from where Id been for the last nineteen years to conceal any small mistakes I might make.Just a tourist, Strigan observed, in a tone that made it clear she didnt believe me at all.Yes, I agreed.So whats the interest in She gestured again at Seivarden, still sleeping, breathing slow and even.Just a stray animal that needed rescuing?I didnt answer.I didnt know the answer, truthfully.Ive met people who collect strays.I dont think youre one of them.Theres something something cold about you.Something edged.Youre far more self possessed than any tourist Ive ever seen.And of course I knew she had the gun, which no one but herself and Anaander Mianaai should have known existed.But she couldnt say that without admitting she had it.Theres no way in seventeen hells youre a Gerentate tourist.What are you?If I told you it would spoil your fun, I said.Strigan opened her mouth to say somethingpossibly something angry, to judge from her expressionwhen an alarm tone sounded.Visitors, she said instead.By the time we got our coats on, and got out the two doors, a crawler had made a ragged path up to the house, dragging a white trench across the moss tinged snow, its half spinning halt missing my flier by centimeters.The door popped open and a Nilter slid out, shorter than many I had met, bundled in a scarlet coat embroidered in bright blue and a screaming shade of yellow, but overlaid with dark stainssnowmoss, and blood.The person halted a moment, and then saw us standing at the entrance to the house.Doctor!she called.Help!Before she was done speaking, Strigan was striding across the snow.I followed.On closer inspection I saw the driver was only a child, barely fourteen.In the passenger seat lay sprawled an adult, unconscious, clothes torn nearly to shreds, in places all the way through every layer.Blood soaked the cloth, and the seat.Her right leg was missing below the knee, and her left foot.Among the three of us we got the injured person into the house, into the infirmary.What happened?Strigan asked as she removed bloody fragments of coat.Ice devil, said the girl.We didnt see it!Tears welled in her eyes, but didnt fall.She swallowed hard.Strigan appraised the makeshift tourniquets the girl had obviously applied.You did everything you could, she told the girl.She nodded toward the door to the main room.Ill take it from here.We left the infirmary, the girl apparently not even aware of my presence, or Seivardens, where she still lay on her pallet.She stood for a few seconds in the middle of the room, uncertain, seeming paralyzed, and then she sank down on a bench.I brought her a cup of fermented milk and she started, as though I had suddenly appeared from nowhere.Are you injured?I asked her.No misgendering this timeI had already heard Strigan use the feminine pronoun.I She stopped, looking at the cup of milk as though it might bite her.No, not a little.She seemed on the verge of collapse.She might well be.By Radchaai standards she was still a child, but she had seen this adult injuredwas she a parent, a cousin, a neighbor?and had the presence of mind to render some small bits of first aid, get her into a crawler, and come here.Small wonder if she was about to fall to pieces now.What happened to the ice devil?I asked.I dont know.She looked up at me, from the milk, still not taking it.I kicked it.I stabbed it with my knife.It went away.I dont know.It took a few minutes for me to get the information out of her, that shed left messages for the others at her familys camp but that no one had been near enough to help, or was near enough to be here terribly soon.While we were talking she seemed to collect herself, at least slightly, at least enough to take the milk I offered and drink it.Within a few minutes she was sweating, and she removed both her coats and laid them on the bench beside her, and then sat, quiet and awkward.I knew of nothing that might relieve her distress.Do you know any songs?I asked her.She blinked, startled.Im not a singer, she said.It might have been a language issue.I hadnt paid much attention to customs in this part of this world, but I was fairly sure there was no division between songs anyone might sing and songs that were, usually for religious reasons, only sung by specialistsnot in the cities near the equator.Maybe it was different this far south.Excuse me, I said, I must have used the wrong word.What do you call it when youre working or playing, or trying to get a baby to sleep?Or just  Oh!Comprehension animated her, for just a moment.You mean songs!I smiled encouragingly, but she lapsed into silence again.Try not to worry too much, I said.The doctor is very good at what she does.And sometimes you just have to leave things to the gods.She curled her lower lip inward and bit it.I dont believe in any god, she said, with a slight vehemence.Still.Things will happen as they happen.She gestured agreement, perfunctory.Do you play counters?I asked.Maybe she could show me the game Strigans board was meant for, though I doubted it was from Nilt.No.And with that, I had exhausted what small means I might have had to amuse or distract her.After ten minutes of silence she said, I have a Tiktik set.Whats Tiktik?Her eyes widened, round in her round, pale face.How can you not know what Tiktik is?You must be from very far away!I acknowledged that I was, and she answered, Its a game.Its mostly a game for children.Her tone implied she wasnt a child, but Id best not ask why she was carrying a childs game set.Youve really never played Tiktik?Never.Where I come from we mostly play counters, and cards, and dice.But even those are different, in different places.She pondered that a moment.I can teach you, she said finally.Its easy.Two hours later, as I was tossing my handful of tiny bov bone dice, the visitor alarm sounded.The girl looked up, startled.Someones here, I said.The door to the infirmary stayed shut, Strigan paying no attention.Mama, the girl suggested, hope and relief lending the tiniest tremble to her voice.I hope so.I hope its not another patient.Immediately I realized I shouldnt have suggested it.Ill go see.It was Mama, unquestionably.She jumped out of the flier she had arrived in, and made for the house with a speed I wouldnt have thought possible over the snow.She strode past me without acknowledging my existence in any way, tall for a Nilter and broad, as they all were, bundled in coats, the signs of her relationship to the girl inside clear in the lines of her face.I followed her in.On seeing the girl, now standing by the abandoned Tiktik board, she said, Well, then, what?A Radchaai parent would have put her arms around her daughter, kissed her, told her how relieved she was her daughter was well, maybe even would have wept.Some Radchaai would have thought this parent cold and affectionless.But I was sure that would have been a mistake.They sat down together on a bench, sides touching, as the girl gave her report, what she knew of the patients condition, and what had happened out in the snow with the herd, and the ice devil.When she had finished, her mother patted her twice on the knee, briskly, and it was as though she were suddenly a different girl, taller, stronger, now she had, it seemed, not only her mothers strong, comforting presence, but her approval.I brought them two cups of fermented milk, and Mamas attention snapped to me, but not, I thought, because I was of any interest in particular.Youre not the doctor, she said, bare statement.I could see her attention was still on her daughter; her interest in me stretched only as far as I might be a threat or a help.Im a guest here, I told her.But the doctor is busy, and I thought you might like something to drink.Her eyes went to Seivarden, still sleeping, as she had for the last several hours, that black, trembling corrective spread across her forehead, the remains of bruising around her mouth and nose.Shes from very far away, said the girl.She didnt know how to play Tiktik!Her mothers gaze flicked over the set on the floor, the dice, the board and flat, painted stone pieces halted in midcourse.She said nothing, but her expression changed, just slightly.She gave a small, almost imperceptible nod, and took the milk I offered.Twenty minutes later Seivarden woke, brushed the black corrective off her head, and wiped fretfully at her upper lip, pausing at the flakes of dried blood that rubbed away.She looked at the two Nilters, sitting silent, side by side, on a nearby bench, studiously ignoring both her and me.Neither of them seemed to find it odd that I didnt go to Seivardens side, or say anything to her.I didnt know if she remembered why I had hit her, or even that I had.Sometimes a blow to the head affects memories of the moments leading up to it.But she must have either remembered or suspected something, because she didnt look at me at all.After fidgeting a few minutes she rose and went to the kitchen and opened a cabinet.She stared for thirty seconds, and then got a bowl, and hard bread to put in it, and water to pour over it, and then stood, staring, waiting for it to soften, saying nothing, looking at no one.8   At first the people I had sent away from the Fore Temple water stood whispering in small groups on the street, and then dispersed when I approached, walking my regular rounds.But soon after, everyone disappeared into their houses, clustered together within.For the next few hours the upper city was quiet.Eerily so, and it didnt help that Lieutenant Awn continually asked me what was happening there.Lieutenant Awn was sure increasing my presence in the upper city would only make the situation worse, so instead she ordered me to stay close to the plaza.If anything happened I would be there, between the upper and lower city.It was largely because of this that when things went to pieces, I was still able to function more or less effectively.For hours nothing happened.The Lord of the Radch mouthed prayers along with the priests of Ikkt.In the lower city I passed the word that it might be a good idea to stay in tonight, and as a result there were no conversations in the streets, no knots of neighbors congregating on someones ground floor to watch an entertainment.By dark nearly everyone had retired to an upper floor, and was talking quietly, or looking out over the railings, saying nothing.Four hours before dawn, things went to pieces.Or, more accurately, I went to pieces.The tracker data I had been monitoring cut out, and suddenly all twenty of me were blind, deaf, immobile.Each segment could see only from a single pair of eyes, hear only through a single pair of ears, move only that single body.It took a few bewildered, panicked moments for my segments to realize that each was cut off from the others, each instance of me alone in a single body.Worst of all, in that same instant all data from Lieutenant Awn ceased.From that moment I was twenty different people, with twenty different sets of observations and memories, and I can only remember what happened by piecing those separate experiences together.At the moment the blow fell, all twenty segments immediately, without thought, extended my armor, those segments that were dressed not making even the least attempt to modify it to cover any part of my uniforms.In the house eight sleeping segments woke instantly, and once I had recovered my composure they rushed to where Lieutenant Awn lay trying to sleep.Two of those segments, Seventeen and Four, seeing Lieutenant Awn seemingly well, and several other segments around her, went to the house console to check communications statusthe console wasnt working.Communications are out, my Seventeen segment called, voice distorted by the smooth, silver armor.Not possible, said Four, and Seventeen didnt answer, because no answer was necessary, given the actuality.Some of my segments in the upper city actually turned toward the Fore Temple water before realizing Id best stay where I was.Every single segment in the plaza and the temple turned toward the house.One of me took off running to be sure of Lieutenant Awn, and two said, at once, The upper city!and another two, The storm siren!and for two confused seconds the pieces of me tried to decide what to do next.Segment Nine ran into the temple residence and woke the priest sleeping by the storm siren, who tripped it.Just before the siren blew, Jen Shinnan ran out of her house in the upper city shouting, Murder!Murder!Lights came on in the houses around her, but further noise was drowned out by the shrieking of the siren.My nearest segment was four streets away.All around the lower city, storm shutters rattled down.The priests in the temple ceased their prayers, and the head priest looked at me, but I had no information for her, and gestured my helplessness.My communications are cut off, Divine, said that segment.The head priest blinked, uncomprehending.Speech was useless while the siren blew.The Lord of the Radch hadnt reacted at the moment I had fragmented, though she was connected to the rest of herself in much the same way I ordinarily was.Her apparent lack of surprise was strange enough for my segment nearest her to notice it.But it might have been no more than self possession; the siren elicited no more than an upward glance and a raised eyebrow.Then she stood and walked out onto the plaza.It was the third worst thing that has ever happened to me.I had lost all sense of Justice of Toren overhead, all sense of myself.I had shattered into twenty fragments that could barely communicate with each other.Just before the siren had blown, Lieutenant Awn had sent a segment to the temple, with orders to sound the alarm.Now that segment came running into the plaza, where it stood, hesitating, looking at the rest of itself, visible but not there as far as my sense of myself was concerned.The siren stopped.The lower city was silent, the only sound was my footsteps, and my armor filtered voices, trying to talk to myself, to get organized so I could function at least in some small way.The Lord of the Radch raised one graying eyebrow.Where is Lieutenant Awn?That was, of course, the question uppermost in the minds of all my segments that didnt already know, but now the one of me who had arrived with the order from Lieutenant Awn had something it knew it could do.Lieutenant Awn is on her way, my lord, it said, and ten seconds later Lieutenant Awn and most of the rest of me that had been in the house arrived, rushing into the plaza.I thought you had this area under control.Anaander Mianaai didnt look at Lieutenant Awn as she spoke, but the direction of her words was clear.So did I.  And then Lieutenant Awn remembered where she was, and to whom she was speaking.My lord.Begging your pardon.Each of me had to restrain itself from turning entirely to watch Lieutenant Awn, to be sure she was really there, because I couldnt sense her otherwise.A few whispers sorted out which of my segments would keep close to her, and the rest would have to trust that.My Ten segment came around the Fore Temple water at a dead run.Trouble in the upper city!it called, and came to a halt in front of Lieutenant Awn, where I cleared the path for myself.People are gathering at Jen Shinnans house, theyre angry, theyre talking about murder, and getting justice.Murder.Oh, fuck!All the segments near Lieutenant Awn said, in unison, Language, Lieutenant!Anaander Mianaai turned a disbelieving look on me, but said nothing.Oh, fuck!Lieutenant Awn repeated.Are you, asked Anaander Mianaai, calm and deliberate, going to do anything except swear?Lieutenant Awn froze for half a second, then looked around, across the water, toward the lower city, at the temple.Whos here?Count!And when we had done so, One through Seven, out here.The rest, with me.I followed her into the temple, leaving Anaander Mianaai standing in the plaza.The priests stood near the dais, watching us approach.Divine, said Lieutenant Awn.Lieutenant, said the head priest.Theres a mob bent on violence headed here from the upper city.Im guessing we have five minutes.They cant do much damage with the storm shutters down, Id like to bring them in here, keep them from doing anything drastic.Bring them in here, the head priest repeated, doubtfully.Everything else is dark and shut.The big doors are open, its the most obvious place to come, when most of them are in here we close the doors and One Esk surrounds them.We could just shut the temple doors and let them try their luck with the shutters on the houses, but I dont really want to find out how hard those are to breach.If, she added, seeing Anaander Mianaai come into the temple, walking slowly, as though nothing unusual were happening, my lord permits.The Lord of the Radch gestured a silent assent.The head priest clearly didnt like the suggestion, but she agreed.By now my segments on the plaza were seeing hand lights sporadically visible in the nearest upper city streets.Within moments Lieutenant Awn had me behind the large temple doors, ready to close them on her signal, and a few of me dispatched to the streets around the plaza to help herd Tanmind toward the temple.The rest of me stood in the shadows around the perimeter inside the temple itself, and the priests returned to their prayers, their backs to the wide and inviting entrance.More than a hundred Tanmind came down from the upper city.Most of them did precisely as we wished, and rushed in a swirling, shouting mass into the temple, except for twenty three, a dozen of whom veered off down a dark, empty avenue.The other eleven, who had already been trailing the larger group, saw one segment of me standing quiet nearby, and thought better of their actions.They stopped, muttered among themselves for a moment, watching the mass of Tanmind run into the temple, the others rushing, shouting, down the street.They watched me close the temple doors, the segments posted there not uniformed, covered only with the silver of my own generated armor, and maybe it reminded them of the annexation.Several of them swore, and they turned and ran back to the upper city.Eighty three Tanmind had run into the temple; their angry voices echoed and reechoed, magnified.At the sound of the doors slamming closed, they turned and tried to rush back the way they had come, but I had surrounded them, my guns drawn and aimed at whoever was nearest each segment.Citizens!shouted Lieutenant Awn, but she didnt have the trick of making herself heard.Citizens!the various fragments of me shouted, my own voices echoing and then dying down.Along with the Tanminds tumult: Jen Shinnan, and Jen Taa, and a few others I knew were friends or relations of theirs, shushed those near them, urged them to calm themselves, to consider that the Lord of the Radch herself was here, and they could speak directly to her.Citizens!Lieutenant Awn shouted again.Have you lost your minds?What are you doing?Murder!shouted Jen Shinnan, who was at the front of the crowd, shouting over my head at Lieutenant Awn where she stood behind me, beside the Lord of the Radch and the Divine.The junior priests stood huddled together, seemingly frozen.The Tanmind voices grumbled, echoing, in support of Jen Shinnan.We wont get justice from you so well take it ourselves!Jen Shinnan cried.The grumbling from the crowd rolled around the stone walls of the temple.Explain yourself, citizen, said Anaander Mianaai, voice pitched to sound above the noise.The Tanmind hushed each other for five seconds, and then, My lord, said Jen Shinnan.Her respectful tone sounded almost sincere.My young niece has been staying in my house for the past week.She was harassed and threatened by Orsians when she came to the lower city, which I reported to Lieutenant Awn, but nothing was done.This evening I found her room empty, the window broken, blood everywhere!What am I to conclude?The Orsians have always resented us!Now they mean to kill us all, is it any wonder we should defend ourselves?Anaander Mianaai turned to Lieutenant Awn.Was this reported?It was, my lord, said Lieutenant Awn.I investigated and found that the young person in question had never left sight of Justice of Toren One Esk, who reported that she had spent all her time in the lower city alone.The only words that passed between her and anyone else were routine business transactions.She was not harassed or threatened at any time.You see!cried Jen Shinnan.You see why we are compelled to take justice into our own hands!And what leads you to believe all your lives are threatened?asked Anaander Mianaai.My lord, said Jen Shinnan, Lieutenant Awn would have you believe everyone in the lower city is loyal and law abiding, but we know from experience that the Orsians are anything but paragons of virtue.The fishermen go out on the water at night, unseen.Sources She hesitated, just a moment, whether because of the gun pointed directly at her, or Anaander Mianaais continued impassivity, or something else, I couldnt tell.But it seemed to me something had amused her.Then she recovered her composure.Sources I prefer not to name have seen the boatmen of the lower city depositing weapons in caches in the lake.What would those be for, except to finally take their revenge on us, who they believe have mistreated them?And how could those guns have come here without Lieutenant Awns collusion?Anaander Mianaai turned her dark face toward Lieutenant Awn and raised one grayed eyebrow.Do you have an answer for that, Lieutenant Awn?Something about the question, or the way it was asked, troubled all the segments that heard it.And Jen Shinnan actually smiled.She had expected the Lord of the Radch to turn on Lieutenant Awn, and was pleased by it.I do have an answer, my lord, said Lieutenant Awn.Some nights ago, a local fisherman reported to me that she had found a cache of weapons under the lake.I removed them and took them to my house, and upon searching, discovered two more caches, which I also removed.I had intended to search further this evening, but events have, as you see, prevented me.My report is written but not yet sent, because I, too, wondered how the guns could have come here without my knowledge.Perhaps it was only because of Jen Shinnans smile, and the oddly accusatory questions from Anaander Mianaaiand the slight earlier, in the temple plazabut in the charged air of the temple, the echoes of Lieutenant Awns words themselves felt like an accusation.I have also wondered, Lieutenant Awn said, in the silence after those echoes died away, why the young person in question would falsely accuse residents of the lower city of harassing her, when they assuredly did not.I am quite certain no one from the lower city has harmed her.Someone has!shouted a voice in the crowd, and mutterings of assent started, and grew and echoed around the vast stone space.What time did you last see your cousin?asked Lieutenant Awn.Three hours ago, said Jen Shinnan.She told us good night, and went to her room.Lieutenant Awn addressed the segment of me that was nearest her.One Esk, did anyone cross from the lower city to the upper in the last three hours?The segment that answeredThirteenknew I should be careful about my answer, which by necessity everyone would hear.No.No one crossed in either direction.Though I cant be certain about the last fifteen minutes.Someone might have come earlier, Jen Shinnan pointed out.In that case, answered Lieutenant Awn, theyre still in the upper city, and you ought to be looking for them there.The guns Jen Shinnan began.Are no danger to you.Theyre locked under the top floor of my house, and One Esk has disabled most of them by now.Jen Shinnan cast an odd, appealing look to Anaander Mianaai, who had stood silent and impassive through this exchange.But  Lieutenant Awn, said the Lord of the Radch.A word.She gestured aside, and Lieutenant Awn followed her to a spot fifteen meters off.One of my segments followed, which Mianaai ignored.Lieutenant, she said in a quiet voice.Tell me what you think is happening.Lieutenant Awn swallowed, took a breath.My lord.Im certain no one from the lower city has harmed the young person in question.I am also certain the guns were not cached by anyone from the lower city.And the weapons were all ones which had been confiscated during the annexation.This can only originate from a very high level.Thats why I havent filed the report.I was hoping to speak directly to you about this when you arrived, but never had the opportunity.You were afraid if you reported it through regular channels, whoever did this would realize their plan had been detected, and cover their tracks.Yes, my lord.When I heard you were coming, my lord, I planned to speak to you about it immediately.Justice of Toren.The Lord of the Radch addressed my segment without looking at me.Is this true?Entirely, my lord, I answered.The junior priests still huddled, the head priest standing apart from them, looking at Lieutenant Awn and the Lord of the Radch where they conferred, an expression on her face that I couldnt read.So, said Anaander Mianaai.Whats your assessment of this situation?Lieutenant Awn blinked in astonishment.I it looks very much to me as though Jen Shinnan is involved with the weapons.How would she have known of their existence otherwise?And this murdered young person?If she is murdered, no one from the lower city did it.But can they have killed her themselves to have an excuse to Lieutenant Awn stopped, appalled.An excuse to come down to the lower city and murder innocent citizens in their beds.And then use the existence of the weapons caches to support their assertion that they were only acting in self defense and you had refused to do your duty and protect them.She cast a glance at the Tanmind, ringed by my still armed and  silver armored segments.Well.We can concern ourselves with details later.Right now we need to deal with these people.My lord, acknowledged Lieutenant Awn, with a slight bow.Shoot them.To noncitizens, who only ever see Radchaai in melodramatic entertainments, who know nothing of the Radch besides ancillaries and annexations and what they think of as brainwashing, such an order might be appalling, but hardly surprising.But the idea of shooting citizens was, in fact, extremely shocking and upsetting.What, after all, was the point of civilization if not the well being of citizens?And these people were citizens now.Lieutenant Awn froze, for two seconds.M my lord?Anaander Mianaais voice, which had been dispassionate, perhaps slightly stern, turned chill and severe.Are you refusing an order, Lieutenant?No, my lord, only theyre citizens.And were in a temple.And we have them under control, and Ive sent Justice of Toren One Esk to the next division to ask for reinforcements.Justice of Ente Seven Issa should be here in an hour, perhaps two, and we can arrest the Tanmind and assign them to reeducation very easily, since youre here.Are you, asked Anaander Mianaai, slowly and clearly, refusing an order?Jen Shinnans amusement, her willingnesseven eagernessto speak to the Lord of the Radch, it fell into a pattern for my listening segment.Someone very high up had made those guns available, had known how to cut off communications.No one was higher up than Anaander Mianaai.But it made no sense.Jen Shinnans motivation was obvious, but how could the Lord of the Radch possibly profit by it?Lieutenant Awn was likely having the same thoughts.I could read her distress in the tension of her jaw, the stiff set of her shoulders.Still, it seemed unreal, because the external signs were all I could see.I wont refuse an order, my lord, she said after five seconds.May I protest it?I believe you already have, said Anaander Mianaai, coldly.Now shoot them.Lieutenant Awn turned.I thought she was the slightest bit shaky as she walked toward the surrounded Tanmind.Justice of Toren, Mianaai said, and the segment of me that had been about to follow Lieutenant Awn stopped.When was the last time I visited you?I remembered the last time the Lord of the Radch had boarded Justice of Toren very clearly.It had been an unusual visitunannounced, four older bodies with no entourage.She had mostly stayed in her quarters talking to meJustice of Toren me, not One Eskme, but she had asked One Esk to sing for her.I had obliged with a Valskaayan piece.It had been ninety four years, two months, two weeks, and six days before, shortly after the annexation of Valskaay.I opened my mouth to say so, but instead heard myself say, Two hundred three years, four months, one week, and one day ago, my lord.Hmm, said Anaander Mianaai, but she said nothing else.Lieutenant Awn approached me, where I ringed the Tanmind.She stood there, behind a segment, for three and a half seconds, saying nothing.Her distress must have been obvious to more than just me.Jen Shinnan, seeing her stand there silent and unhappy, smiled.Almost triumphantly.Well?One Esk, Lieutenant Awn said, clearly dreading the finish of her sentence.Jen Shinnans smile grew slightly larger.Expecting Lieutenant Awn to send the Tanmind home, no doubt.Expecting, in the fullness of time, Lieutenant Awns dismissal and the decline of the lower citys influence.I didnt want this, Lieutenant Awn said to her, quietly, but I have a direct order.She raised her voice.One Esk.Shoot them.Jen Shinnans smile disappeared, replaced by horror, and, I thought, betrayal, and she looked, plainly, directly, toward Anaander Mianaai.Who stood impassive.The other Tanmind clamored, crying out in fear and protest.All my segments hesitated.The order made no sense.Whatever they had done, these were citizens, and I had them under control.But Lieutenant Awn said, loud and harsh, Fire!and I did.Within three seconds all the Tanmind were dead.No one in the temple at that moment was young enough to be surprised at what had happened, though perhaps the several years since Id executed anyone had lent the memories some distance, maybe even engendered some confidence that citizenship meant an end to such things.The junior priests stood where they had since this had begun, not moving, saying nothing.The head priest wept openly, soundlessly.I think, said Anaander Mianaai into the vast silence that surrounded us, once the echoes of gunfire had died down, there wont be any more trouble from the Tanmind here.Lieutenant Awns mouth and throat twitched slightly, as though she were about to speak, but she didnt.Instead she walked forward, around the bodies, tapping four of my segments on the shoulder as she passed and gesturing to them to follow.I realized she simply could not bring herself to speak.Or perhaps she feared what would come out of her mouth if she attempted it.Having only visual data from her was frustrating.Where are you going, Lieutenant?asked the Lord of the Radch.Her back to Mianaai, Lieutenant Awn opened her mouth, and then closed it again.Closed her eyes, took a breath.With my lords permission, I intend to discover whatever it is thats blocking communications.Anaander Mianaai didnt answer, and Lieutenant Awn turned to my nearest segment.Jen Shinnans house, that segment said, since it was clear Lieutenant Awn was still in emotional distress.Ill look for the young person as well.Just before sunrise I found the device there.The instant I disabled it I was myself againminus one missing segment.I saw the silent, barely twilit streets of the upper and lower city, the temple empty of anyone but myself and eighty three silent, staring corpses.Lieutenant Awns grief and distress and shame were suddenly clear and visible, to my combined relief and discomfort.And with a moments willing it, the tracker signals of all the people in Ors flared into life in my vision, including the people who had died and still lay in the temple of Ikkt; my missing segment in an upper city street, neck broken; and Jen Shinnans niecein the mud at the bottom of the northern edge of the Fore Temple water.9   Strigan came out of the infirmary, undercoat bloody, and the girl and her mother, who had been talking quietly in a language I didnt understand, fell silent and looked expectantly to her.Ive done what I can, Strigan said, with no preamble.
