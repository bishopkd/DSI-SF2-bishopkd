The reaction had come, but too late.He knew the reaction period down to a fraction of a second, the correct reaction period; there should have been none.Thanks, Miss Rosen, he said, and gathered together the equipment again; he had concluded his retesting.Thats all.Youre leaving?Rachael asked.Yes, he said.Im satisfied.Cautiously, Rachael said, What about the other nine subjects?The scale has been adequate in your case, he answered.I can extrapolate from that; its clearly still effective.To Eldon Rosen, who slumped morosely by the door of the room, he said, Does she know?Sometimes they didnt; false memories had been tried various times, generally in the mistaken idea that through them reactions to testing would be altered.Eldon Rosen said, No.We programmed her completely.But I think toward the end she suspected.To the girl he said, You guessed when he asked for one more try.Pale, Rachael nodded fixedly.Dont be afraid of him, Eldon Rosen told her.Youre not an escaped android on Earth illegally; youre the property of the Rosen Association, used as a sales device for prospective emigrants.He walked to the girl, put his hand comfortingly on her shoulder; at the touch the girl flinched.Hes right, Rick said.Im not going to retire you, Miss Rosen.Good day.He started toward the door, then halted briefly.To the two of them he said, is the owl genuine?Rachael glanced swiftly at the elder Rosen.Hes leaving anyhow, Eldon Rosen said.It doesnt matter; the owl is artificial.There are no owls.Hmm, Rick muttered, and stepped numbly out into the corridor.The two of them watched him go.Neither said anything.Nothing remained to say.So thats how the largest manufacturer of androids operates, Rick said to himself.Devious, and in a manner he had never encountered before.A weird and convoluted new personality type; no wonder law enforcement agencies were having trouble with the Nexus 6.The Nexus 6.He had now come up against it.Rachael, he realized; she must be a Nexus 6.Im seeing one of them for the first time.And they damn near did it; they came awfully damn close to undermining the Voigt Kampff scale, the only method we have for detecting them.The Rosen Association does a good jobmakes a good try, anyhowat protecting its products.And I have to face six more of them, he reflected.Before Im finished.He would earn the bounty money.Every cent.Assuming he made it through alive.6  The TV set boomed; descending the great empty apartment buildings dust stricken stairs to the level below, John Isidore made out now the familiar voice of Buster Friendly, burbling happily to his system wide vast audience.ho ho, folks!Zip click zip!Time for a brief note on tomorrows weather; first the Eastern seaboard of the U. S. A.  Mongoose satellite reports that fallout will be especially pronounced toward noon and then will taper off.So all you dear folks wholl be venturing out ought to wait until afternoon, eh?And speaking of waiting, its now only ten hours til that big piece of news, my special expos!Tell your friends to watch!Im revealing something thatll amaze you.Now, you might guess that its just the usual  As Isidore knocked on the apartment door the television died immediately into nonbeing.It had not merely become silent; it had stopped existing, scared into its grave by his knock.He sensed, behind the closed door, the presence of life, beyond that of the TV.His straining faculties manufactured or else picked up a haunted, tongueless fear, by someone retreating from him, someone blown back to the farthest wall of the apartment in an attempt to evade him.Hey, he called.I live upstairs.I heard your TV.Lets meet; okay?He waited, listening.No sound and no motion; his words had not pried the person loose.I brought you a cube of margarine, he said, standing close to the door in an effort to speak through its thickness.My names J.  R.  Isidore and I work for the well known animal vet Mr.Hannibal Sloat; youve heard of him.Im reputable; I have a job.I drive Mr.Sloats truck.The door, meagerly, opened and he saw within the apartment a fragmented and misaligned shrinking figure, a girl who cringed and slunk away and yet held onto the door, as if for physical support.Fear made her seem ill; it distorted her body lines, made her appear as if someone had broken her and then, with malice, patched her together badly.Her eyes, enormous, glazed over fixedly as she attempted to smile.He said, with sudden understanding, You thought no one lived in this building.You thought it was abandoned.Nodding, the girl whispered, Yes.But, Isidore said, its good to have neighbors.Heck, until you came along I didnt have any.And that was no fun, god knew.Youre the only one?the girl asked.In this building besides me?She seemed less timid, now; her body straightened and with her hand she smoothed her dark hair.Now he saw that she had a nice figure, although small, and nice eyes markedly established by long black lashes.Caught by surprise, the girl wore pajama bottoms and nothing more.And as he looked past her he perceived a room in disorder.Suitcases lay here and there, opened, their contents half spilled onto the littered floor.But this was natural; she had barely arrived.Im the only one besides you, Isidore said.And I wont bother you.He felt glum; his offering, possessing the quality of an authentic old pre war ritual, had not been accepted.In fact the girl did even seem aware of it.Or maybe she did not understand what a cube of margarine was for.He had that intuition; the girl seemed more bewildered than anything else.Out of her depth and helplessly floating in now receding circles of fear.Good old Buster, he said, trying to reduce her rigid postural stance.You like him?I watch him every morning and then again at night when I get home; I watch him while Im eating dinner and then his late late show until I go to bed.At least until my TV set broke.Who the girl began and then broke off; she bit her lip as if savagely angry.Evidently at herself.Buster Friendly, he explained.It seemed odd to him that this girl had never heard of Earths most knee slapping TV comic.Where did you come here from?he asked curiously.I dont see that it matters.She shot a swift glance upward at him.Something that she saw seemed to ease her concern; her body noticeably relaxed.Ill be glad to receive company, she said, later on when Im more moved in.Right now, of course, its out of the question.Why out of the question?He was puzzled; everything about her puzzled him.Maybe, he thought, Ive been living here alone too long.Ive become strange.They say chickenheads are like that.The thought made him feel even more glum.I could help you unpack, he ventured; the door, now, had virtually shut in his face.And your furniture.The girl said, I have no furniture.All these thingsshe indicated the room behind herthey were here.They wont do, Isidore said.He could tell that at a glance.The chairs, the carpet, the tablesall had rotted away; they sagged in mutual ruin, victims of the despotic force of time.And of abandonment.No one had lived in this apartment for years; the ruin had become almost complete.He couldnt imagine how she figured on living in such surroundings.Listen, he said earnestly.If we go all over the building looking we can probably find you things that arent so tattered.A lamp from one apartment, a table from another.Ill do it, the girl said.Myself, thanks.Youd go into those apartments alone?He could not believe it.Why not?Again she shuddered nervously, grimacing in awareness of saying something wrong.Isidore said, Ive tried it.Once.After that I just come home and go in my own place and I dont think about the rest.The apartments in which no one liveshundreds of them and all full of the possessions people had, like family photographs and clothes.Those that died couldnt take anything and those who emigrated didnt want to.This building, except for my apartment, is completely kipple ized.Kipple ized?She did not comprehend.Kipple is useless objects, like junk mail or match folders after you use the last match or gum wrappers or yesterdays homeopape.When nobodys around, kipple reproduces itself.For instance, if you go to bed leaving any kipple around your apartment, when you wake up the next morning theres twice as much of it.It always gets more and more.I see.The girl regarded him uncertainly, not knowing whether to believe him.Not sure if he meant it seriously.Theres the First Law of Kipple, he said.Kipple drives out nonkipple.Like Greshams law about bad money.And in these apartments theres been nobody there to fight the kipple.So it has taken over completely, the girl finished.She nodded.Now I understand.Your place, here, he said, this apartment youve pickedits too kipple ized to live in.We can roll the kipple factor back; we can do like I said, raid the other apts.But He broke off.But what?Isidore said, We cant win.Why not?The girl stepped into the hall, closing the door behind her; arms folded self consciously before her small high breasts she faced him, eager to understand.Or so it appeared to him, anyhow.She was at least listening.No one can win against kipple, he said, except temporarily and maybe in one spot, like in my apartment Ive sort of created a stasis between the pressure of kipple and nonkipple, for the time being.But eventually Ill die or go away, and then the kipple will again take over.Its a universal principle operating throughout the universe; the entire universe is moving toward a final state of total, absolute kippleization.He added, Except of course for the upward climb of Wilbur Mercer.The girl eyed him.I dont see any relation.Thats what Mercerism is all about.Again he found himself puzzled.Dont you participate in fusion?Dont you own an empathy box?After a pause the girl said carefully, I didnt bring mine with me.I assumed Id find one here.But an empathy box, he said, stammering in his excitement, is the most personal possession you have!Its an extension of your body; its the way you touch other humans, its the way you stop being alone.But you know that.Everybody knows that.Mercer even lets people like me He broke off.But too late; he had already told her and he could see by her face, by the flicker of sudden aversion, that she knew.I almost passed the IQ test, he said in a low, shaky voice.Im not very special, only moderately; not like some you see.But thats what Mercer doesnt care about.As far as Im concerned, the girl said, you can count that as a major objection to Mercerism.Her voice was clean and neutral; she intended only to state a fact, he realized.The fact of her attitude toward chickenheads.I guess Ill go back upstairs, he said, and started away from her, his cube of margarine clutched; it had become plastic and damp from the squeeze of his hand.The girl watched him go, still with the neutral expression on her face.And then she called, Wait.Turning, he said, Why?Ill need you.For getting myself adequate furniture.From other apartments, as you said.She strolled toward him, her bare upper body sleek and trim, without an excess gram of far.What time do you get home from work?You can help me then.Isidore said, Could you maybe fix dinner for us?If I brought home the ingredients?No, I have too much to do.The girl shook off the request effortlessly and he noticed that, perceived it without understanding it.Now that her initial fear had diminished, something else had begun to emerge from her.Something more strange.And, he thought, deplorable.A coldness.Like, he thought, a breath from the vacuum between inhabited worlds, in fact from nowhere: it was not what she did or said but what she did not do and say.Some other time, the girl said, and moved back toward her apartment door.Did you get my name?he said eagerly, John Isidore, and I work for  You told me who you work for.She had stopped briefly at her door; pushing it open she said, Some incredible person named Hannibal Sloat, who Im sure doesnt exist outside your imagination.My name is She gave him one last warmthless glance as she returned to her apartment, hesitated, and said, Im Rachael Rosen.Of the Rosen Association?he asked.The systems largest manufacturer of humanoid robots used in our colonization program?A complicated expression instantly crossed her face, fleetingly, gone at once.No, she said.I never heard of them; I dont know anything about it.More of your chickenbead imagination, I suppose.John Isidore and his personal, private empathy box.Poor Mr.Isidore.But your name suggests  My name, the girt said, is Pris Stratton.Thats my married name; I always use it.I never use any other name but Pris.You can call me Pris.She reflected, then said, No, youd better address me as Miss Stratton.Because we dont really know each other.At least I dont know you.The door shut after her and he found himself alone in the dust strewn dim hall.7  Well, so it goes, J.  R.  Isidore thought as he stood clutching his soft cube of margarine.Maybe shell change her mind about letting me call her Pris.And possibly, if I can pick up a can of pre war vegetables, about dinner, too.But maybe she doesnt know how to cook, he thought suddenly.Okay, I can do it; Ill fix dinner for both of us.And Ill show her how so she can do it in the future if she wants.Shell probably want to, once I show her how; as near as I can make out, most women, even young ones like her, like to cook: its an instinct.Ascending the darkened stairs he returned to his own apartment.Shes really out of touch, he thought as he donned his white work uniform; even if he hurried hed be late to work and Mr.Sloat would be angry but so what?For instance, shes never beard of Buster Friendly.And thats impossible; Buster is the most important human being alive, except of course for Wilbur Mercer  but Mercer, he reflected, isnt a human being; he evidently is an archetypal entity from the stars, superimposed on our culture by a cosmic template.At least thats what Ive heard people say; thats what Mr.Sloat says, for instance.And Hannibal Sloat would know.Odd that she isnt consistent about her own name, he pondered.She may need help.Can I give her any help?he asked himself.A special, a chickenhead; what do I know?I cant marry and I cant emigrate and the dust will eventually kill me.I have nothing to offer.Dressed and ready to go he left his apartment, ascended to the roof where his battered used hovercar lay parked.An hour later, in the company track, he had picked up the first malfunctioning animal for the day.An electric cat: it lay in the plastic dust proof carrying cage in the rear of the truck and panted erratically.Youd almost think it was real,  Isidore observed as he headed back to the Van Ness Pet Hospitalthat carefully misnamed little enterprise which barely existed in the tough, competitive field of false animal repair.The cat, in its travail, groaned.Wow, Isidore said to himself.It really sounds as if its dying.Maybe its ten year battery has shorted, and all its circuits are systematically burning out.A major job; Milt Borogrove, Van Ness Pet Hospitals repairman, would have his bands full.And I didnt give the owner an estimate, Isidore realized gloomily.The guy simply thrust the cat at me, said it had begun failing during the night, and then I guess he took off for work.Anyhow all of a sudden the momentary verbal exchange had ceased; the cats owner had gone roaring up into the sky in his custom new model handsome hovercar.And the man constituted a new customer.To the cat, Isidore said, Can you hang on until we reach the shop?The cat continued to wheeze.Ill recharge you while were en route, Isidore decided; he dropped the truck toward the nearest available roof and there, temporarily parked with the motor running, crawled into the back of the truck and opened the plastic dust proof carrying cage, which, in conjunction with his own white suit and the name on the truck, created a total impression of a true animal vet picking up a true animal.The electric mechanism, within its compellingly authentic style gray pelt, gurgled and blew bubbles, its vid lenses glassy, its metal jaws locked together.This had always amazed him, these disease circuits built into false animals; the construct which he now held on his lap had been put together in such a fashion that when a primary component misfired, the whole thing appearednot brokenbut organically ill.It would have fooled me, Isidore said to himself as he groped within the ersatz stomach fur for the concealed control panel (quite small on this variety of false animal) plus the quick charge battery terminals, He could find neither.Nor could he search very long; the mechanism had almost failed.If it does consist of a short, he reflected, which is busy burning out circuits, then maybe I should try to detach one of the battery cables; the mechanism will shut down, but no more harm will be done.And then, in the shop, Milt can charge it back up.Deftly, he ran his fingers along the pseudo bony spine.The cables should be about here.Damn expert workmanship; so absolutely perfect an imitation.Cables not apparent even under close scrutiny.Must be a Wheelright & Carpenter productthey cost more, but look what good work they do.He gave up; the false cat had ceased functioning, so evidently the shortif that was what ailed the thinghad finished off the power supply and basic drive train.Thatll run into money, he thought pessimistically.Well, the guy evidently hadnt been getting the three times yearly preventive cleaning and lubricating, which made all the difference.Maybe this would teach the ownerthe hard way.Crawling back in the drivers seat he put the wheel into climb position, buzzed up into the air once I more, and resumed his flight back to the repair shop.Anyhow he no longer had to listen to the nerve wracking wheezing of the construct; he could relax.Funny, he thought; even though I know rationally its faked the sound of a false animal burning out its drive train and power supply ties my stomach in knots.I wish, he thought painfully, that I could get another job.If I hadnt failed that IQ test I wouldnt be reduced to this ignominious task with its attendant emotional by products.On the other hand, the synthetic sufferings of false animals didnt bother Milt Borogrove or their boss Hannibal Sloat.So maybe its I, John Isidore said to himself.Maybe when you deteriorate back down the ladder of evolution as I have, when you sink into the tomb world slough of being a specialwell, best to abandon that line of inquiry.Nothing depressed him more than the moments in which he contrasted his current mental powers with what he had formerly possessed.Every day he declined in sagacity and vigor.He and the thousands of other specials throughout Terra, all of them moving toward the ash heap.Turning into living Ripple.For company he clicked on the trucks radio and tuned for Buster Friendlys aud show, which, Eke the TV version, continued twenty three unbroken warm hours a day  the additional one hour being a religious sign off, ten minutes of silence, and then a religious sign on.glad to have you on the show again, Buster Friendly was saying.Lets see, Amanda; its been two whole days since weve visited with you.Starting on any new pics, dear?Veil, I vuz goink to do a pic yestooday baht vell, dey vanted me to staht ad seven  Seven A. M. ?Buster Friendly broke in.Yess, dots right, Booster; it vuz seven hey hem!Amanda Werner laughed her famous laugh, nearly as imitated as Busters.Amanda Werner and several other beautiful, elegant, conically breasted foreign ladies, from unspecified vaguely defined countries, plus a few bucolic so called humorists, comprised Busters perpetual core of repeats.Women like Amanda Werner never made movies, never appeared in plays; they lived out their queer, beautiful lives as guests on Busters unending show, appearing, Isidore had once calculated, as much as seventy hours a week.How did Buster Friendly find the time to tape both his aud and vid shows?Isidore wondered.And how did Amanda Werner find time to be a guest every other day, month after month, year after year?How did they keep talking?They never repeated themselvesnot so far as he could determine.Their remarks, always witty, always new, werent rehearsed.Amandas hair glowed, her eyes glinted, her teeth shone; she never ran down, never became tired, never found herself at a loss as to a clever retort to Busters bang bang string of quips, jokes, and sharp observations.The Buster Friendly Show, telecast and broadcast over all Earth via satellite, also poured down on the emigrants of the colony planets.Practice transmissions beamed to Proxima had been attempted, in case human colonization extended that far.Had the Salander 3 reached its destination the travelers aboard would have found the Buster Friendly Show awaiting them.And they would have been glad.But something about Buster Friendly irritated John Isidore, one specific thing.In subtle, almost inconspicuous ways, Buster ridiculed the empathy boxes.Not once but many times.He was, in fact, doing it right now.no rock nicks on me, Buster prattled away to Amanda Werner.And if Im going up the side of a mountain I want a couple of bottles of Budweiser beer along!The studio audience laughed, and Isidore heard a sprinkling of handclaps.And Ill reveal my carefully documented expos from up therethat expos coming exactly ten hours from now!Ent me, too, dahiink!Amanda gushed.Tek me wit you!I go alonk en ven dey trow a rock et us I protek you!Again the audience howled, and John Isidore felt baffled and impotent rage seep up into the back of his neck.Why did Buster Friendly always chip away at Mercerism?No one else seemed bothered by it; even the U. N.  approved.And the American and Soviet police had publicly stated that Mercerism reduced crime by making citizens more concerned about the plight of their neighbors.Mankind needs more empathy, Titus Corning, the U.  N.  Secretary General, had declared several times.Maybe Buster is jealous, Isidore conjectured.Sure, that would explain it; he and Wilbur Mercer are in competition.But for what?Our minds, Isidore decided.Theyre fighting for control of our psychic selves; the empathy box on one hand, Busters guffaws and off the cuff jibes on the other.Ill have to tell Hannibal Sloat that, he decided.Ask him if its true; hell know.When he had parked his truck on the roof of the Van Ness Pet Hospital he quickly carried the plastic cage containing the inert false cat downstairs to Hannibal Sloats office.As he entered, Mr.Sloat glanced up from a parts inventory page, his gray, seamed face rippling like troubled water.Too old to emigrate, Hannibal Sloat, although not a special, was doomed to creep out his remaining life on Earth.The dust, over the years, had eroded him; it had left his features gray, his thoughts gray; it had shrunk him and made his legs spindly and his gait unsteady.He saw the world through glasses literally dense with dust.For some reason Sloat never cleaned his glasses.It was as if he had given up; he had accepted the radioactive dirt and it had begun its job, long ago, of burying him.Already it obscured his sight.In the few years he had remaining it would corrupt his other senses until at last only his bird screech voice would remain, and then that would expire, too.What do you have there?Mr.Sloat asked.A cat with a short in its power supply.Isidore set the cage down on the document littered desk of his boss.Why show it to me?Sloat demanded.Take it down in the shop to Milt.However, reflexively, he opened the cage and tugged the false animal out.Once, he had been a repairman.A very good one.Isidore said, I think Buster Friendly and Mercerism are fighting for control of our psychic souls.If so, Sloat said, examining the cat, Buster is winning.Hes winning now, Isidore said, but ultimately hell lose.Sloat lifted his bead, peered at him.Why?Because Wilbur Mercer is always renewed.Hes eternal.At the top of the hill hes struck down; he sinks into the tomb world but then he rises inevitably.And us with him.So were eternal, too.He felt good, speaking so well; usually around Mr.Sloat he stammered.Sloat said, Buster is immortal, like Mercer.Theres no difference.How can he he?Hes a man.I dont know, Sloat said.But its true.Theyve never admitted it, of course.Is that how come Buster Friendly can do forty six hours of show a day?Thats right, Sloat said.What about Amanda Werner and those other women?Theyre immortal, too.Are they a superior life form from another system?Ive never been able to determine that for sure, Mr.Sloat said, still examining the cat.He now removed his dust filmed glasses, peered without them at the half open mouth.As I have conclusively in the case of Wilbur Mercer, he finished almost inaudibly.He cursed, then, a string of abuse lasting what seemed to Isidore a full minute.This cat, Sloat said finally, isnt false.I knew sometime this would happen.And its dead.He stared down at the corpse of the cat.And cursed again.Wearing his grimy blue sailcloth apron, burly pebble skinned Milt Borogrove appeared at the office door.Whats the matter?he said.Seeing the cat he entered the office and picked up the animal.The chickenhead, Sloat said, brought it in.Never before had he used that term in front of Isidore.If it was still alive, Milt said, we could take it to a real animal vet.I wonder what its worth.Anybody got a copy of Sidneys?D doesnt y y your insurance c c cover this?Isidore asked Mr.Sloat.Under him his legs wavered and he felt the room begin to turn dark maroon cast over with specks of green.Yes, Sloat said finally, half snarling.But its the waste that gets me.The loss of one more living creature.Couldnt you tell, Isidore?Didnt you notice the difference?I thought, Isidore managed to say, it was a really good job.So good it fooled me; I mean, it seemed alive and a job that good  I dont think Isidore can tell the difference, Milt said mildly.To him theyre all alive, false animals included.He probably tried to save it.To Isidore he said, What did you do, try to recharge its battery?Or locate a short in it?Yyes, Isidore admitted.It probably was so far gone it wouldnt have made it anyhow, Milt said.Let the chickenhead off the hook, Han.Hes got a point; the fakes are beginning to be darn near real, what with those disease circuits theyre building into the new ones.And living animals do die; thats one of the risks in owning them.Were just not used to it because all we see are fakes.The goddamn waste, Sloat said.According to M mercer, Isidore pointed Out, a all life returns.The cycle is c c complete for a a animals, too.I mean, we all ascend with him, die  Tell that to the guy that owned this cat, Mr.Sloat said.Not sure if his boss was serious Isidore said, You mean I have to?But you always handle vidcalls.He had a phobia about the vidphone and found making a call, especially to a stranger, virtually impossible.Mr.Sloat, of course, knew this.Dont make him, Milt said.Ill do it.He reached for the receiver.Whats his number?Ive got it here somewhere.Isidore fumbled in his work smock pockets.Sloat said, I want the chickenhead to do it.I c c cant use the vidphone, Isidore protested, his heart laboring.Because Im hairy, ugly, dirty, stooped, snaggletoothed, and gray.And also I feel sick from the radiation; I think Im going to die.Milt smiled and said to Sloat, I guess if I felt that way I wouldnt use the vidphone either.Come on, Isidore; if you dont give me the owners number I cant make the call and youll have to.He held out his hand amiably.The chickenhead makes it, Sloat said, or hes fired.He did not look either at Isidore or at Milt; he glared fixedly forward.Aw come on, Milt protested.Isidore said, I d d dont like to be c c called a chickenhead.I mean, the d d dust has d d done a lot to you, too, physically.Although maybe n n not your brain, as in m my case.Im fired, he realized.I cant make the call.And then all at once he remembered that the owner of the cat had zipped off to work.There would be no one home.I g guess I can call him, he said, as he fished out the tag with the information on it.See?Mr.Sloat said to Milt.He can do it if he has to.Seated at the vidphone, receiver in hand, Isidore dialed.Yeah, Milt said, but he shouldnt have to.And hes right; the dust has affected you; youre damn near blind and in a couple of years you wont be able to hear.Sloat said, Its got to you, too, Borogrove.Your skin is the color of dog manure.On the vidscreen a face appeared, a mitteleuropaische some what careful looking woman who wore her hair in a tight bun.Yes?she said.M m mrs.Pilsen?Isidore said, terror spewing through him; he had not thought of it naturally but the owner had a wife, who of course was home.I want to t t talk to you about your c c c c c c He broke off, rubbed his chin tic wise.Your cat.Oh yes, you picked up Horace, Mrs.Pilsen said.Did it turn out to be pneumonitis?Thats what Mr.Pilsen thought.Isidore said, Your cat died.Oh no god in heaven.Well replace it, he said.We have insurance.He glanced toward Mr.Sloat; he seemed to concur.The owner of our firm, Mr.Hannibal Sloat He floundered.Will personally  No, Sloat said, well give them a check.Sidneys list price.will personally pick the replacement cat out for you, Isidore found himself saying.Having started a conversation which he could not endure he discovered himself unable to get back out.What he was saying possessed an intrinsic logic which he had no means of halting; it had to grind to its own conclusion.Both Mr.Sloat and Milt Borogrove stared at him as he rattled on, Give us the specifications of the cat you desire.Color, sex, subtype, such as Manx, Persian, Abyssinian  Horace is dead, Mrs.Pilsen said.He had pneumonitis, Isidore said.He died on the trip to the hospital.Our senior staff physician, Dr.Hannibal Sloat, expressed the belief that nothing at this point could have saved him.But isnt it fortunate, Mrs.Pilsen, that were going to replace him.Am I correct?Mrs.Pilsen, tears appearing in her eyes, said, There is only one cat like Horace.He used towhen he was just a kittenstand and stare up at us as if asking a question.We never understood what the question was.Maybe now he knows the answer.Fresh tears appeared.I guess we all will eventually.An inspiration came to Isidore.What about an exact electric duplicate of your cat?We can have a superb handcrafted job by Wheelright & Carpenter in which every detail of the old animal is faithfully repeated in permanent  Oh thats dreadful!Mrs.Pilsen protested.What are you saying?Dont tell my husband that; dont suggest that to Ed or hell go mad.He loved Horace more than any cat he ever had, and hes had a cat since he was a child.Taking the vidphone receiver from Isidore, Milt said to the woman, We can give you a check in the amount of Sidneys list, or as Mr.Isidore suggested we can pick out a new cat for you.Were very sorry that your cat died, but as Mr.Isidore pointed out, the cat had pneumonitis, which is almost always fatal.His tone rolled out professionally; of the three of them at the Van Ness Pet Hospital, Milt performed the best in the matter of business phone calls.I cant tell my husband, Mrs.Pilsen said.All right, maam, Milt said, and grimaced slightly.Well call him.Would you give me his number at his place of employment?He groped for a pen and pad of paper; Mr.Sloat handed them to him.Listen, Mrs.Pilsen said; she seemed now to rally.Maybe the other gentleman is right.Maybe I ought to commission an electric replacement of Horace but without Ed ever knowing; could it be so faithful a reproduction that my husband wouldnt be able to tell?Dubiously, Milt said, If thats what you want.But its been our experience that the owner of the animal is never fooled.Its only casual observers such as neighbors.You see, once you get real close to a false animal  Ed never got physically close to Horace, even though he loved him; I was the one who took care of all Horaces personal needs such as his sandbox.I think I would like to try a false animal, and if it didnt work then you could find us a real cat to replace Horace.I just dont want my husband to know; I dont think he could live through it.Thats why he never got close to Horace; he was afraid to.And when Horace got sickwith pneumonitis, as you tell meEd got panic stricken and just wouldnt face it.Thats why we waited so long to call you.Too long  as I knew before you called.I knew.She nodded, her tears under control, now.How long will it take?Milt essayed, We can have it ready in ten days.Well deliver it during the day while your husband is at work.He wound up the call, said good by, and hung up.Hell know, he said to Mr.Sloat.In five seconds.But thats what she wants.Owners who get to love their animals, Sloat said somberly, go to pieces.Im glad were not usually involved with real animals.You realize that actual animal vets have to make calls like that all the time?He contemplated John Isidore.In some ways youre not so stupid after all, Isidore.You handled that reasonably well.Even though Milt had to come in and take over.He was doing fine, Milt said.God, that was tough.He picked up the dead Horace.Ill take this down to the shop; Han, you phone Wheelright & Carpenter and get their builder over to measure and photograph it.Im not going to let them take it to their shop; I want to compare the replica myself.I think Ill have Isidore talk to them, Mr.
