You tell me. ""We know what we know.We want to know what you know. ""These are very good soldiers, Major Anderson.I'm sure they have limits, but we haven't reached them yet.Some of the newer ones are having trouble because they never really mastered some basic techniques, but they're working hard and improving.What do you want me to say, that they need to rest?Of course they need to rest.They need a couple of weeks off.Their studies are shot to hell, none of us are doing any good in our classes.But you know that, and apparently you don't care, so why should I?"Graff and Anderson exchanged glances."Ender, why are you studying the videos of the bugger wars?""To learn strategy, of course. ""Those videos were created for propaganda purposes.All our strategies have been edited out. ""I know. "Graff and Anderson exchanged glances again.Graff drummed on his table."You don't play the fantasy game anymore," he said.Ender didn't answer."Tell me why you don't play it. ""Because I won. ""You never win everything in that game.There's always more. ""I won everything. ""Ender, we want to help you be as happy as possible, but if you  "  "You want to make me the best soldier possible.Go down and look at the standings.Look at the all time standings.So far you're doing an excellent job with me.Congratulations.Now when are you going to put me up against a good army?"Graff's set lips turned to a smile, and he shook a little with silent laughter.Anderson handed Ender a slip of paper."Now," he said.BONZO MADRID, SALAMANDER ARMY, 1200   "That's ten minutes from now," said Ender."My army will be in the middle of showering up after practice. "Graff smiled."Better hurry, then, boy. "He got to his army's barracks five minutes later.Most were dressing after their showers; some had already gone to the game room or the video room to wait for lunch.He sent three younger boys to call everyone in, and made everyone else dress for battle as quickly as they could."This one's hot and there's no time," Ender said."They gave Bonzo notice about twenty minutes ago, and by the time we get to the door they'll have been inside for a good five minutes at least. "The boys were outraged, complaining loudly in the slang that they usually avoided around the commander.What they doing to us?They be crazy, neh?"Forget why, we'll worry about that tonight.Are you tired?"Fly Molo answered."We worked our butts off in practice today.Not to mention beating the crap out of Ferret Army this morning. ""Same day nobody ever do two battles!"said Crazy Tom.Ender answered in the same tone."Nobody ever beat Dragon Army, either.This be your big chance to lose?"Ender's taunting question was the answer to their complaints.Win first, ask questions later.All of them were back in the room, and most of them were dressed."Move!"shouted Ender, and they ran along behind him, some of them still dressing when they reached the corridor outside the battleroom.Many of them were panting, a bad sign; they were too tired for this battle.The door was already open.There were no stars at all.Just empty, empty space in a dazzlingly bright room.Nowhere to hide, not even in darkness."My heart," said Crazy Tom, "they haven't come out yet, either. "Ender put his hand across his own mouth, to tell them to be silent.With the door open, of course the enemy could hear every word they said.Ender pointed all around the door, to tell them that Salamander Army was undoubtedly deployed against the wall all around the door, where they couldn't be seen but could easily flash anyone who came out.Ender motioned for them all to back away from the door.Then he pulled forward a few of the taller boys, including Crazy Tom, and made them kneel, not squatting back to sit on their heels, but fully upright, so they formed an L with their bodies.He flashed them.In silence the army watched him.He selected the smallest boy, Bean, handed him Tom's gun, and made Bean kneel on Tom's frozen legs.Then pulled Bean's hands, each holding a gun, through Tom's armpits.Now the boys understood.Tom was a shield, an armored spacecraft, and Bean was hiding inside.He was certainly not invulnerable, but he would have time.Ender assigned two more boys to throw Tom and Bean through the door and signaled them to wait.He went on through the army quickly assigning groups of four    a shield, a shooter, and two throwers.Then, when all were frozen or armed or ready to throw, he signaled the throwers to pick up their burdens, throw them through the door, and then jump through themselves."Move!"shouted Ender.They moved.Two at a time the shield pairs went through the door, backwards so that the shield would be between the shooter and the enemy.The enemy opened fire at once, but they mostly hit the frozen boy in front.In the meantime, with two guns to work with and their targets neatly lined up and spread flat along the wall, the Dragons had an easy time of it.It was almost impossible to miss.And as the throwers also jumped through the door, they got handholds on the same wall with the enemy, shooting at a deadly angle so that the Salamanders couldn't figure out whether to shoot at the shield pairs slaughtering them from above or the throwers shooting at them from their own level.By the time Ender himself came through the door, the battle was over.It hadn't taken a full minute from the time the first Dragon passed through the door until the shooting stopped.Dragon had lost twenty frozen or disabled, and only twelve boys were undamaged.It was their worst score yet, but they had won.When Major Anderson came out and gave Ender the hook, Ender could not contain his anger."I thought you were going to put us against an army that could match us in a fair fight. ""Congratulations on the victory, commander. ""Bean!"shouted Ender."If you had commanded Salamander Army, what would you have done?"Bean, disabled but not completely frozen, called out from where he drifted near the enemy door."Keep a shifting pattern of movement going in front of the door.You never hold still when the enemy knows exactly where you are."As long as you're cheating," Ender said to Anderson, "why don't you train the other army to cheat intelligently!""I suggest that you remobilize your army," said Anderson.Ender pressed the buttons to thaw both armies at once."Dragon Army dismissed!"he shouted immediately.There would be no elaborate formation to accept the surrender of the other army.This had not been a fair fight, even though they had won    the teachers had meant them to lose, and it was only Bonzo's ineptitude that had saved them.There was no glory in that.Only as Ender himself was leaving the battleroom did he realize that Bonzo would not realize that Ender was angry at the teachers.Spanish honor.Bonzo would only know that he had been defeated even when the odds were stacked in his favor; that Ender had had the youngest child in his army publicly state what Bonzo should have done to win; and that Ender had not even stayed to receive Bonzo's dignified surrender.If Bonzo had not already hated Ender he would surely have begun; and hating him as he did, this would surely turn his rage murderous.Bonzo was the last person to strike me, thought Ender.I'm sure he has not forgotten that.Nor had he forgotten the bloody affair in the battleroom when the older boys tried to break up Ender's practice session.Nor had many others.They were hungry for blood then; Bonzo will be thirsting for it now.Ender toyed with the idea of going back to take advanced personal defense; but with battles now possible not only every day, but twice in the same day, Ender knew he could not spare the time.I'll have to take my chances.The teachers got me into this    they can keep me safe.Bean flopped down on his bunk in utter exhaustion    half the boys in the barracks were already asleep, and it was still fifteen minutes before lights out.Wearily he pulled his desk from its locker and signed on.There was a test tomorrow in geometry and Bean was woefully unprepared.He could always reason things out if he had enough time, and he had read Euclid when he was five, but the test had a time limit so there wouldn't be a chance to think.He had to know.And he didn't know.And he would probably do badly on the test.But they had won twice today, and so he felt good.As soon as he signed on, however, all thoughts of geometry were banished.A message paraded around the desk:   SEE ME AT ONCE    ENDER   The time was 2150, only ten minutes before lights out.How long ago had Ender sent it?Still, he'd better not ignore it.There might be another battle in the morning    the thought made him weary    and whatever Ender wanted to talk to him about, there wouldn't be time then.So Bean rolled off the bunk and walked emptily through the corridor to Ender's room.He knocked."Come in," said Ender."Just saw your message. ""Fine," said Ender."It's near lights out. ""I'll help you find your way in the dark. ""I just didn't know if you knew what time it was  "  "I always know what time it is. "Bean sighed inwardly.It never failed.Whenever he had any conversation with Ender, it turned into an argument.Bean hated it.He recognized Ender's genius and honored him for it.Why couldn't Ender ever see anything good in him?"Remember four weeks ago, Bean?When you told me to make you a toon leader?""Eh. ""I've made five toon leaders and five assistants since then.And none of them was you. "Ender raised his eyebrows."Was I right?""Yes, sir. ""So tell me how you've done in these eight battles. ""Today was the first time they disabled me, but the computer listed me as getting eleven hits, before I had to stop.I've never had less than five hits in a battle.I've also completed every assignment I've been given. ""Why did they make you a soldier so young, Bean?""No younger than you were. ""But why?""I don't know. ""Yes you do, and so do I. ""I've tried to guess, but they're just guesses.You're   very good.They knew that, they pushed you ahead  "  "Tell me why, Bean. ""Because they need us, that's why. "Bean sat down on the floor and stared at Enders feet."Because they need somebody to beat the buggers.That's the only thing they care about. ""It's important that you know that, Bean.Because most boys in this school think the game is important for itself   but it isn't.It's only important because it helps them find kids who might grow up to be real commanders, in the real war.But as for the game, screw that.That's what they're doing.Screwing up the game. ""Funny.I thought they were just doing it to us. ""A game nine weeks earlier than it should have come.A game every day.And now two games in the same day.Bean, I don't know what the teachers are doing, but my army is getting tired, and I'm getting tired, and they don't care at all about the rules of the game.I've pulled the old charts up from the computer.No one has ever destroyed so many enemies and kept so many of his own soldiers whole in the history of the game. ""You're the best, Ender. "Ender shook his head."Maybe.But it was no accident that I got the soldiers I got.Launchies, rejects from other armies, but put them together and my worst soldier could be a toon leader in another army.They've loaded things my way, but now they're loading it all against me.Bean, they want to break us down. ""They can't break you. ""You'd be surprised. "Ender breathed sharply, suddenly, as if there were a stab of pain, or he had to catch a sudden breath in a wind; Bean looked at him and realized that the impossible was happening.Far from baiting him, Ender Wiggin was actually confiding in him.Not much.But a little.Ender was human and Bean had been allowed to see."Maybe you'll be surprised," said Bean."There's a limit to how many clever new ideas I can come up with every day.Somebody's going to come up with something to throw at me that I haven't thought of before, and I won't be ready. ""What's the worst that could happen?You lose one game. ""Yes.That's the worst that could happen.I can't lose any games.Because if I lose any  "  He didn't explain himself, and Bean didn't ask."I need you to be clever, Bean.I need you to think of solutions to problems we haven't seen yet.I want you to try things that no one has ever tried because they're absolutely stupid. ""Why me?""Because even though there are some better soldiers than you in Dragon Army    not many, but some    there's nobody who can think better and faster than you. "Bean said nothing.They both knew it was true.Ender showed him his desk.On it were twelve names.Two or three from each toon."Choose five of these," said Ender."One from each toon.They're a special squad, and you'll train them.Only during the extra practice sessions.Talk to me about what you're training them to do.Don't spend too long on any one thing.Most of the time you and your squad will be part of the whole army, part of your regular toons.But when I need you.When there's something to be done that only you can do. ""These are all new," said Bean."No veterans. ""After last week, Bean, all our soldiers are veterans.Don't you realize that on the individual soldier standings, all forty of our soldiers are in the top fifty?That you have to go down seventeen places to find a soldier who isn't a Dragon?""What if I can't think of anything?""Then I was wrong about you. "Bean grinned."You weren't wrong. "The lights went out."Can you find your way back, Bean?""Probably not. ""Then stay here.If you listen very carefully you can hear the good fairy come in the night and leave our assignment for tomorrow. ""They won't give us another battle tomorrow, will they?"Ender didn't answer.Bean heard him climb into bed.He got up from the floor and did likewise.He thought of a half dozen ideas before he went to sleep.Ender would be pleased    every one of them was stupid.12   Bonzo    "General Pace, please sit down.I understand you have come to me about a matter of some urgency. ""Ordinarily, Colonel Graff, I would not presume to interfere in the internal workings of the Battle School.Your autonomy is guaranteed, and despite our difference in ranks I am quite aware that it is my authority only to advise, not to order, you to take action. ""Action?""Do not be disingenuous with me, Colonel Graff.Americans are quite apt at playing stupid when they choose to, but I am not to be deceived.You know why I am here. ""Ah.I guess this means Dap filed a report?""He feels paternal toward the students here.He feels your neglect of a potentially lethal situation is more than negligence    that it borders on conspiracy to cause the death or serious injury of one of the students here. ""This is a school for children, General Pace.Hardly a matter to bring the chief of I. F.  military police here for. ""Colonel Graff, the name of Ender Wiggin has percolated through the high command.It has even reached my ears    I have heard him described modestly as our only hope of victory in the upcoming invasion.When it is his life or health that is in danger, I do not think it untoward that the military police take some interest in preserving and protecting the boy.Do you?""Damn Dap and damn you too, sir, I know what I'm doing. ""Do you?""Better than anyone else. ""Oh, that is obvious, since nobody else has the faintest idea what you're doing.You have known for eight days that there is a conspiracy among some of the more vicious of these 'children' to cause the beating of Ender Wiggin, if they can.And that some members of this conspiracy, notably the boy named Bonito de Madrid, commonly called Bonzo, are quite likely to exhibit no self restraint when this punishment takes place, so that Ender Wiggin, an inestimably important international resource, will be placed in serious danger of having his brains pasted on the walls of your simple orbiting schoolhouse.And you, fully warned of this danger, propose to do exactly  "  "Nothing. ""You can see how this excites our puzzlement. ""Ender Wiggin has been in this situation before.Back on Earth, the day he lost his monitor, and again when a large group of older boys  "  "I did not come here ignorant of the past.Ender Wiggin has provoked Bonzo Madrid beyond human endurance.And you have no military police standing by to break up disturbances.It is unconscionable. ""When Ender Wiggin holds our fleets in his control, when he must make the decisions that bring us victory or destruction, will there be military police to came save him if things get out of hand?""I fail to see the connection. ""Obviously.But the connection is there Ender Wiggin must believe that no matter what happens, no adult will ever, ever step in to help him in any way.He must believe, to the core of his soul, that he can only do what he and the other children work out for themselves.If he does not believe that, then he will never reach the peak of his abilities. ""He will also not reach the peak of his abilities if he is dead or permanently crippled. ""He won't be. ""Why don't you simply graduate Bonzo?He's old enough. ""Because Ender knows that Bonzo plans to kill him.If we transfer Bonzo ahead of schedule, he'll know that we saved him.Heaven knows Bonzo isn't a good enough commander to be promoted on merit. ""What about the other children?Getting them to help him?""We'll see what happens.That is my first, final, and only decision. ""God help you if you're wrong. ""God help us all if I'm wrong. ""I'll have you before a capital court martial.I'll have your name disgraced throughout the world if you're wrong. ""Fair enough.But do remember if I happen to be right to make sure I get a few dozen medals. ""For what?""For keeping you from meddling. "Ender sat in a corner of the battleroom, his arm hooked through a handhold watching Bean practice with his squad.Yesterday they had worked on attacks without guns, disarming enemies with their feet.Ender had helped them with some techniques from gravity personal combat     many things had to be changed, but inertia in flight was a tool that could be used against the enemy as easily in nullo as in Earth gravity.Today, though, Bean had a new toy.It was a deadline, one of the thin, almost invisible twines used during construction in space to hold two objects together.Deadlines were sometimes kilometers long.This one was just a bit longer than a wall of the battleroom and yet it looped easily, almost invisibly, around Bean's wrist.He pulled it off like an article of clothing and handed one end to one of his soldiers."Hook it to a handhold and wind it around a few times. "Bean carried the other end across the battleroom.As a tripwire it wasn't too useful, Bean decided.It was invisible enough, but one strand of twine wouldn't have much chance of stopping an enemy that could easily go above or below it.Then he got the idea of using it to change his direction of movement in midair.He fastened it around his waist, the other end still fastened to a handhold, slipped a few meters away, and launched himself straight out.The twine caught him, changed his direction abruptly, and swung him in an arc that crashed him brutally against the wall.He screamed and screamed.It took Ender a moment to realize that he wasn't screaming in pain."Did you see how fast I went!Did you see how I changed direction!"Soon all of Dragon Army stopped work to watch Bean practice with the twine.The changes in direction were stunning, especially when you didn't know where to look for the twine, When he used the twine to wrap himself around a star, he attained speeds no one had ever seen before.It was 2140 when Ender dismissed the evening practice.Weary but delighted at having seen something new, his army walked through the corridors back to the barracks.Ender walked among them, not talking, but listening to their talk.They were tired, yes    a battle every day for more than four weeks, often in situations that tested their abilities to the utmost.But they were proud, happy, close    they had never lost, and they had learned to trust each other.Trust their fellow soldiers to fight hard and well; trust their leaders to use them rather than waste their efforts; above all trust Ender to prepare them for anything and everything that might happen.As they walked the corridor, Ender noticed several older boys seemingly engaged in conversations in branching corridors and ladderways; some were in their corridor, walking slowly in the other direction.It became too much of a coincidence, however, that so many of them were wearing Salamander uniforms, and that those who weren't were often older boys belonging to armies whose commanders most hated Ender Wiggin.A few of them looked at him, and looked away too quickly; others were too tense, too nervous as they pretended to be relaxed.What will I do if they attack my army here in the corridor?My boys are all young, all small, and completely untrained in gravity combat.When would they learn?"Ho, Ender!"someone called.Ender stopped and looked back, It was Petra."Ender, can I talk to you?"Ender saw in a moment that if he stopped and talked, his army would quickly pass him by and he would be alone with Petra in the hallway."Walk with me," Ender said."It's just for a moment. "Ender turned around and walked on with his army.He heard Petra running to catch up."All right, I'll walk with you. "Ender tensed when she came near.Was she one of them, one of the ones who hated him enough to hurt him?"A friend of yours wanted me to warn you.There are some boys who want to kill you. ""Surprise," said Ender.Some of his soldiers seemed to perk up at this.Plots against their commander were interesting news, it seemed."Ender, they can do it.He said they've been planning it ever since you went commander. ""Ever since I beat Salamander, you mean. ""I hated you after you beat Phoenix Army, too, Ender. ""I didn't say I blamed anybody. ""It's true.He told me to take you aside today and warn you, on the way back from the battleroom, to be careful tomorrow because  "  "Petra, if you had actually taken me aside just now, there are about a dozen boys following along who would have taken me in the corridor.Can you tell me you didn't notice them?"Suddenly her face flushed."No.I didn't.How can you think I did?Don't you know who your friends are?"She pushed her way through Dragon Army, got ahead of him, and scrambled up a ladderway to a higher deck."Is it true?"asked Crazy Tom."Is what true?"Ender scanned the room and shouted for two roughhousing boys to get to bed."That some of the older boys want to kill you?""All talk," said Ender.But he knew that it wasn't.Petra had known something, and what he saw on the way here tonight wasn't imagination."It may be all talk, but I hope you'll understand when I say you've got five toon leaders who are going to escort you to your room tonight. ""Completely unnecessary. ""Humor us.You owe us a favor. ""I owe you nothing. "He'd be a fool to turn them down."Do as you want. "He turned and left.The toon leaders trotted along with him.One ran ahead and opened his door.They checked the room, made Ender promise to lock it, and left him just before lights out.There was a message on his desk.DON'T BE ALONE.EVER.DINK   Ender grinned.So Dink was still his friend.Don't worry.They won't do anything to me.I have my army.But in the darkness he did not have his army.He dreamed that night of Stilson, only he saw now how small Stilson was, only six years old, how ridiculous his tough guy posturing was; and yet in the dream Stilson and his friends tied Ender so he couldn't fight back, and then everything that Ender had done to Stilson in life, they did to Ender in the dream.And afterward Ender saw himself babbling like an idiot, trying hard to give orders to his army, but all his words came out as nonsense.He awoke in darkness, and he was afraid.Then he calmed himself by remembering that the teachers obviously valued him, or they wouldn't be putting so much pressure on him; they wouldn't let anything happen to him, nothing bad, anyway.Probably when the older kids attacked him in the battleroom years ago, there were teachers just outside the room, waiting to see what would happen; if things had got out of hand, they would have stepped in and stopped it.I probably could have sat here and done nothing, and they would have seen to it I came through all right.They'll push me as hard as they can in the game, but outside the game they'll keep me safe.With that assurance, he slept again, until the door opened softly and the morning's war was left on the floor for him to find.They won, of course, but it was a grueling affair, with the battleroom so filled with a labyrinth of stars that hunting down the enemy during mop up took forty five minutes.It was Pol Slattery's Badger Army, and they refused to give up.There was a new wrinkle in the game, too    when they disabled or damaged an enemy, he thawed in about five minutes, the way it worked in practice.Only when the enemy was completely frozen did he stay out of action the whole time.But the gradual thawing did not work for Dragon Army.Crazy Tom was the one who realized what was happening, when they started getting hit from behind by people they thought were safely out of the way.And at the end of the battle, Slattery shook Ender's hand and said, "I'm glad you won.If I ever beat you, Ender, I want to do it fair. ""Use what they give you," Ender said."If you've ever got an advantage over the enemy, use it. ""Oh, I did," said Slattery.He grinned."I'm only fair minded before and after battles. "The battle took so long that breakfast was over.Ender looked at his hot, sweating, tired soldiers waiting in the corridor and said, "Today you know everything.No practice.Get some rest.Have some fun.Pass a test. "It was a measure of their weariness that they didn't even cheer or laugh or smile, just walked into the barracks and stripped off their clothes.They would have practiced if he had asked them to, but they were reaching the end of their strength, and going without breakfast was one unfairness too many.Ender meant to shower right away, but he was also tired.He lay down on his bed in his flash suit, just for a moment, and woke up at the beginning of lunchtime.So much for his idea of studying more about the buggers this morning.Just time to clean up, go eat, and head for class.He peeled off his flash suit, which stank from his sweat.His body felt cold, his joints oddly weak.Shouldn't have slept in the middle of the day.I'm beginning to slack off.I'm beginning to wear down.Can't let it get to me.So he jogged to the gym and forced himself to climb the rope three times before going to the bathroom to shower.It didn't occur to him that his absence in the commanders' mess would be noticed, that showering during the noon hour, when his own army would be wolfing down their first meal of the day, he would he completely, helplessly alone.Even when he heard them come into the bathroom he paid no attention.He was letting the water pour over his head, over his body; the muffled sound of footsteps was hardly noticeable.Maybe lunch was over, he thought.He started to soap himself again.Maybe somebody finished practice late.And maybe not.He turned around, There were seven of them, leaning back against the metal sinks or standing closer to the showers, watching him.Bonzo stood in front of them, Many were smiling, the condescending leer of the hunter for his cornered victim.Bonzo was not smiling, however."Ho," Ender said.Nobody answered.So Ender turned off the shower even though there was still soap on him, and reached for his towel.It wasn't there.One of the boys was holding it.It was Bernard.All it would take for the picture to be complete was for Stilson and Peter to be there, too.They needed Peter's smile; they needed Stilson's obvious stupidity.Ender recognized the towel as their opening point.Nothing would make him look weaker than to chase naked after the towel.That was what they wanted, to humiliate him, to break him down.He wasn't going to play.He refused to feel weak because he was wet and cold and unclothed.He stood strongly, facing them, his arms at his sides.He fastened his gaze on Bonzo."Your move," Ender said."This is no game," said Bernard."We're tired of you, Ender.You graduate today.On ice. "Ender did not look at Bernard.It was Bonzo who hungered for his death, even though he was silent.The others were along for the ride, daring themselves to see how far they might go.Bonzo knew how far he would go."Bonzo," Ender said softly."Your father would be proud of you. "Bonzo stiffened."He would love to see you now, come to fight a naked boy in a shower, smaller than you, and you brought six friends.He would say, Oh, what honor. ""Nobody came to fight you," said Bernard, "We just came to talk you into playing fair with the games.Maybe lose a couple now and then. "The others laughed, but Bonzo didn't laugh, and neither did Ender."Be proud, Bonito, pretty boy.You can go home and tell your father, Yes, I beat up Ender Wiggin, who was barely ten years old, and I was thirteen.And I had only six of my friends to help me, and somehow we managed to defeat him, even though he was naked and wet and alone    Ender Wiggin is so dangerous and terrifying it was all we could do not to bring two hundred. ""Shut your mouth, Wiggin," said one of the boys."We didn't come to hear the little bastard talk," said another."You shut up," said Bonzo."Shut up and stand out of the way. "He began to take off his uniform."Naked and wet and alone, Ender, so we're even.I can't help that I'm bigger than you.You're such a genius, you figure out how to handle me. "He turned to the others."Watch the door.Don't let anyone else in. "The bathroom wasn't large, and plumbing fixtures protruded everywhere, It had been launched in one piece, as a low orbit satellite, packed full of the water reclamation equipment; it was designed to have no wasted space.It was obvious what their tactics would have to be.Throw the other boy against fixtures until one of them does enough damage that he stops.When Ender saw Bonzo's stance, his heart sank.Bonzo had also taken classes.And probably more recently than Ender.His reach was better, he was stronger, and he was full of hate.He would not be gentle.He will go for my head, thought Ender.He will try above all to damage my brain.And if this fight is long, he's bound to win.His strength can control me.If I'm to walk away from here, I have to win quickly, and permanently.He could feel again the sickening way that Stilson's bones had given way.But this time it will be my body that breaks, unless I can break him first.Ender stepped back, flipped the showerhead so it turned outward, and turned on pure hot water.Almost at once the steam began to rise.He turned on the next and the next."I'm not afraid of hot water," said Bonzo.His voice was soft.But it wasn't the hot water that Ender wanted.It was the heat.His body still had soap on it, and his sweat moistened it, made his skin more slippery than Bonzo would expect.Suddenly there was a voice from the door."Stop it!"For a moment Ender thought it was a teacher, come to stop the fight, but it was only Dink Meeker.Bonzo's friends caught him at the door held him."Stop it, Bonzo!"Dink cried."Don't hurt him!""Why not?"asked Bonzo, and for the first time he smiled.Ah, thought Ender, he loves to have someone recognize that he is the one in control, that he has power."Because he's the best, that's why!Who else can fight the buggers!That's what matters, you fool, the buggers!"Bonzo stopped smiling.It was the thing he hated most about Ender, that Ender really mattered to other people, and in the end, Bonzo did not.You've killed me with those words, Dink.Bonzo doesn't want to hear that I might save the world.Where are the teachers?thought Ender.Don't they realize that the first contact between us in this fight might be the end of it?This isn't like the fight in the battleroom, where no one had the leverage to do any terrible damage.There's gravity in here, and the floor and walls are hard and jutted with metal.Stop this now or not at all."If you touch him you're a buggerlover!"cried Dink."You're a traitor, if you touch him you deserve to die!"They jammed Dink's face backward into the door and he was silent.The mist from the showers dimmed the room, and the sweat was streaming down Ender's body.Now, before the soap is carried off me.Now, while I'm still too slippery to hold.Ender stepped back, letting the fear he felt show in his face."Bonzo, don't hurt me," he said."Please. "It was what Bonzo was waiting for, the confession that he was in power.For other boys it might have been enough that Ender had submitted; for Bonzo, it was only a sign that his victory was sure.He swung his leg as if to kick, but changed it to a leap at the last moment.Ender noticed the shifting weight and stooped lower, so that Bonzo would be more off balance when he tried to grab Ender and throw him.Bonzo's tight, hard ribs came against Ender's face, and his hands slapped against his back, trying to grip him.But Ender twisted, and Bonzo's hands slipped.In an instant Ender was completely turned, yet still inside Bonzo's grasp.The classic move at this moment would be to bring up his heel into Bonzo's crotch, but for that move to be effective required too much accuracy, and Bonzo expected it.He was already rising onto his toes, thrusting his hips backward to keep Ender from reaching his groin.Without seeing him, Ender knew it would bring his face closer, almost in Ender's hair; so instead of kicking he lunged upward off the floor, with the powerful lunge of the soldier bounding from the wall, and jammed his head into Bonzo's face.Ender whirled in time to see Bonzo stagger backward, his nose bleeding, gasping from surprise and pain.Ender knew that at this moment he might be able to walk out of the room and end the battle.The way he had escaped from the battleroom after drawing blood.But the battle would only be fought again.Again and again until the will to fight was finished.The only way to end things completely was to hurt Bonzo enough that his fear was stronger than his hate.So Ender leaned back against the wall behind him, then jumped up and pushed off with his arms.His feet landed in Bonzo's belly and chest.Ender spun in the air and landed on his toes and hands; he flipped over, scooted under Bonzo, and this time when he kicked upward into Bonzo's crotch, he connected, hard and sure.Bonzo did not cry out in pain.He did not react at all, except that his body rose a little in the air.It was as if Ender had kicked a piece of furniture.Bonzo collapsed, fell to the side, and sprawled directly under the spray of streaming water from a shower.He made no movement whatever to escape the murderous heat."My God!"someone shouted.Bonzo's friends leaped to turn off the water.Ender slowly rose to his feet.Someone thrust his towel at him.It was Dink."Come on out of here," Dink said.He led Ender away.Behind them they heard the heavy clatter of adults running down a  ladderway.Now the teachers would come.The medical staff.To dress the wounds of Ender's enemy.Where were they before the fight, when there might have been no wounds at all?There was no doubt now in Ender's mind.There was no help for him.Whatever he faced, now and forever, no one would save him from it.Peter might be scum, but Peter had been right, always right; the power to cause pain is the only power that matters, the power to kill and destroy, because if you can't kill then you are always subject to those who can, and nothing and no one will ever save you.Dink led him to his room, made him lie on the bed."Are you hurt anywhere?"he asked,   Ender shook his head."You took him apart.I thought you were dead meat, the way he grabbed you.But you took him apart.If he'd stood up longer, you would've killed him. ""He meant to kill me. ""I know it.I know him.Nobody hates like Bonzo.But not anymore.If they don't ice him for this and send him home, he'll never look you in the eye again.You or anybody.He had twenty centimeters on you, and you made him look like a crippled cow standing there chewing her cud. "All Ender could see, though, was the way Bonzo looked as Ender kicked upward into his groin.The empty, dead look in his eyes.He was already finished then.Already unconscious.His eyes were open, but he wasn't thinking or moving anymore, just that dead, stupid look on his lace, that terrible look, the way Stilson looked when I finished with him."They'll ice him, though," Dink said."Everybody knows he started it.I saw them get up and leave the commanders' mess.Took me a couple of seconds to realize you weren't there, either, and then a minute more to find out where you had gone.I told you not to be alone. ""Sorry. ""They're bound to ice him.Troublemaker.Him and his stinking honor. "Then, to Dink's surprise, Ender began to cry.Lying on his back, still soaking wet with sweat and water, he gasped his sobs, tears seeping out of his closed eyelids and disappearing in the water on his face."Are you all right?""I didn't want to hurt him!"Ender cried."Why didn't he just leave me alone!"He heard his door open softly, then close.He knew at once that it was his battle instructions, He opened his eyes, expecting to find the darkness of early morning, before 0600.Instead, the lights were on, He was naked and when he moved the bed was soaking wet, His eyes were puffy and painful from crying.He looked at the clock on his desk.1820, it said.It's the same day.I already had a battle today, I had two battles today    the bastards know what I've been through, and they're doing this to me.WILLIAM BEE, GRIFFIN ARMY,  TALO MOMOE, TIGER ARMY, 1900   He sat on the edge of the bed.The note trembled in his hand.I can't do this, he said silently.And then not silently."I can't do this. "He got up, bleary, and looked for his flash suit.Then he remembered    he had put it in the cleaner while he showered.It was still there.Holding the paper, he walked out of his room.Dinner was nearly over, and there were a few people in the corridor, but no one spoke to him, just watched him, perhaps in awe of what had happened at noon in the bathroom, perhaps because of the forbidding, terrible look on his face.Most of his boys were in the barracks.Ho, Ender.There gonna be a practice tonight?Ender handed the paper to Hot Soup."Those sons of bitches," he said."Two at once?""Two armies!"shouted Crazy Tom."They'll just trip over each other," said Bean."I've got to clean up," Ender said."Get them ready, get everybody together, I'll meet you there, at the gate. "He walked out of the barracks.A tumult of conversation rose behind him.He heard Crazy Tom scream, "Two farteating armies!We'll whip their butts!"The bathroom was empty.All cleaned up.None of the blood that poured from Bonzo's nose into the shower water.All gone.Nothing bad ever happened here.Ender stepped under the water and rinsed himself, took the sweat of combat and let it run down the drain.All gone, except they recycled it and we'll be drinking Bonzo's bloodwater in the morning.All the life gone out of it, but his blood just the same, his blood and my sweat, washed down in their stupidity or cruelty or whatever it was that made them let it happen.He dried himself, dressed in his flash suit, and walked to the battleroom.His army was waiting in the corridor, the door still not opened.They watched him in silence as he walked to the front to stand by the blank grey forcefield.Of course they all knew about his fight in the bathroom today; that and their own weariness from the battle that morning kept them quiet, while the knowledge that they would be facing two armies filled them with dread.Everything they can do to beat me, thought Ender.Everything they can think of, change all the rules, they don't care, just so they beat me.Well, I'm sick of the game.No game is worth Bonzo's blood pinking the water on the bathroom floor.Ice me, send me home, I don't want to play anymore.The door disappeared.Only three meters out there were four stars together, completely blocking the view from the door.Two armies weren't enough.They had to make Ender deploy his forces blind."Bean," said Ender."Take your boys and tell me what's on the other side of this star. "Bean pulled the coil of twine from his waist, tied one end around him, handed the other end to a boy in his squad, and stepped gently through the door.His squad quickly followed.They had practiced this several times, and it took only a moment before they were braced on the star, holding the end of the twine.Bean pushed off at great speed, in a line almost parallel to the door; when he reached the corner of the room, he pushed off again and rocketed straight out toward the enemy.The spots of light on the wall showed that the enemy was shooting at him.As the rope was stopped by each edge of the star in turn, his arc became tighter, his direction changed, and he became an impossible target to hit.His squad caught him neatly as he came around the star from the other side.He moved all his arms and legs so those waiting inside the door would know that the enemy hadn't flashed him anywhere.Ender dropped through the gate."It's really dim," said Bean, "but light enough you can't follow people easily by the lights on their suits.Worst possible for seeing.It's all open space from this star to the enemy side of the room.They've got eight stars making a square around their door.I didn't see anybody except the ones peeking around the boxes.They're just sitting there waiting for us. "As if to corroborate Bean's statement, the enemy began to call out to them."Hey!We be hungry, come and feed us!Your ass is draggin'!Your ass is Dragon!"Ender's mind felt dead.This was stupid.He didn't have a chance, outnumbered two to one and forced to attack a protected enemy."In a real war, any commander with brains at all would retreat and save his army. ""What the hell," said Bean."It's only a game. ""It stopped being a game when they threw away the rules. ""So, you throw 'em away, too. "Ender grinned."OK.Why not, Let's see how they react to a formation. "Bean was appalled."A formation!We've never done a formation in the whole time we've been an army!""We've still got a month to go before our training period is normally supposed to end.About time we started doing formations.Always have to know formations," He formed an A with his fingers, showed it to the blank door, and beckoned, A toon quickly emerged and Ender began arranging them behind the star.Three meters wasn't enough room to work in, the boys were frightened and confused, and it took nearly five minutes just to get them to understand what they were doing.Tiger and Griffin soldiers were reduced to chanting catcalls, while their commanders argued about whether to try to use their overwhelming force to attack Dragon Army while they were still behind the star.Momoe was all for attacking    "We outnumber him two to one"    while Bee said, "Sit tight and we can't lose, move out and he can figure out a way to beat us. "So they sat tight, until finally in the dusky light they saw a large mass slip out from behind Ender's star.It held its shape, even when it abruptly stopped moving sideways and launched itself toward the dead center of the eight stars where eighty two soldiers waited."Doobie doe," said a Griffin."They're doing a formation. ""They must have been putting that together for all five minutes," said Momoe."If we'd attacked while they were doing it, we could've destroyed them. ""Eat it, Momoe," whispered Bee."You saw the way that little kid flew.He went all the way around the star and back behind without ever touching a wall.Maybe they've all got hooks, did you think of that?They've got something new there. "The formation was a strange one.A square formation of tightly packed bodies in front, making a wall.Behind it, a cylinder, six boys in circumference and two boys deep, their limbs outstretched and frozen so they couldn't possibly be holding on to each other.Yet they held together as tightly as if they had been tied    which, in fact, they were.From inside the formation, Dragon Army was firing with deadly accuracy, forcing Griffins and Tigers to stay tightly packed on their stars."The back of that sucker is open," said Bee."As soon as they get between the stars, we can get around behind  "  "Don't talk about it, do it!"said Momoe.Then he took his own advice and ordered his boys to launch against the wall and rebound out behind the Dragon formation.In the chaos of their takeoff, while Griffin Army held tight to their stars, the Dragon formation abruptly changed.Both the cylinder and the front wall split in two, as boys inside it pushed off; almost at once, the formations also reversed direction, heading back toward the Dragon gate.Most of the Griffins fired at the formations and the boys moving backward with them; and the Tigers took the survivors of Dragon Army from behind.But there was something wrong.William Bee thought for a moment and realized what it was.Those formations couldn't have reversed direction in midflight unless someone pushed off in the opposite direction, and if they took off with enough force to make that twenty man formation move backward, they must be going fast.There they were, six small Dragon soldiers down near William Bee's own door.From the number of lights showing on their flash suits, Bee could see that three of them were disabled and two of them damaged; only one was whole.Nothing to be frightened of.Bee casually aimed at them, pressed the button, and    Nothing happened.The lights went on.The game was over.Even though he was looking right at them, it took Bee a moment to realize what had just happened.Four of the Dragon soldiers had their helmets pressed on the corners of the door.And one of them had just passed through.They had just carried out the victory ritual.They were getting destroyed, they had hardly inflicted any casualties, and they had the gall to perform the victory ritual and end the game right under their noses.Only then did it occur to William Bee that not only had Dragon Army ended the game, it was possible that, under the rules, they had won it.After all, no matter what happened, you were not certified as the winner unless you had enough unfrozen soldiers to touch the corners of the gate and pass someone through into the enemy's corridor.Therefore, by one way of thinking, you could argue that the ending ritual was victory.The battleroom certainly recognized it as the end of the game.The teachergate opened and Major Anderson came into the room."Ender," he called, looking around.One of the frozen Dragon soldiers tried to answer him through jaws that were clamped shut by the flash suit.Anderson hooked over to him and thawed him.Ender was smiling."I beat you again, sir," he said."Nonsense, Ender," Anderson said softly."Your battle was with Griffin and Tiger. ""How stupid do you think I am?"said Ender.Loudly, Anderson said, "After that little maneuver, the rules are being revised to require that all of the enemy's soldiers must be frozen or disabled before the gate can be reversed. ""It could only work once anyway," Ender said.Anderson handed him the hook.Ender unfroze everyone at once.To hell with protocol.To hell with everything."Hey!"he shouted as Anderson moved away."What is it next time?My army in a cage without guns, with the rest of the Battle School against them?How about a little equality?"There was a loud murmur of agreement from the other boys, and not all of it came from Dragon Army.Anderson did not so much as turn around to acknowledge Ender's challenge.Finally, it was William Bee who answered."Ender, if you're on one side of the battle, it won't be equal no matter what the conditions are. "Right!called the boys.Many of them laughed.Talo Momoe began clapping his hands."Ender Wiggin!"he shouted.The other boys also clapped and shouted Ender's name.Ender passed through the enemy gate.His soldiers followed him.The sound of them shouting his name followed him through the corridors."Practice tonight?"asked Crazy Tom.Ender shook his head."Tomorrow morning then?""No. ""Well, when?""Never again, as far as I'm concerned. "He could hear the murmurs behind him."Hey, that's not fair," said one of the boys."It's not our fault the teachers are screwing up the game.You can't just stop teaching us stuff because  "  Ender slammed his open hand against the wall and shouted at the boy."I don't care about the game anymore!"His voice echoed through the corridor.Boys from other armies came to their doors.He spoke quietly into the silence    "Do you understand that?"And he whispered."The game is over. "He walked back to his room alone.He wanted to lie down, but he couldn't because the bed was wet.It reminded him of all that had happened today, and in fury he tore the mattress and blankets from the bedframe and shoved them out into the corridor.Then he wadded up a uniform to serve as a pillow and lay on the fabric of wires strung across the frame.It was uncomfortable, but Ender didn't care enough to get up.He had only been there a few minutes when someone knocked on his door."Go away," he said softly.Whoever was knocking didn't hear him or didn't care.Finally, Ender said to come in.It was Bean."Go away, Bean. "Bean nodded but didn't leave.Instead he looked at his shoes.Ender almost yelled at him, cursed at him, screamed at him to leave.Instead he noticed how very tired Bean looked, his whole body bent with weariness, his eyes dark from lack of sleep; and yet his skin was still soft and translucent, the skin of a child, the soft curved cheek, the slender limbs of a little boy.He wasn't eight years old yet.It didn't matter he was brilliant and dedicated and good.He was a child.He was young      .No he isn't, thought Ender.Small, yes.But Bean has been through a battle with a whole army depending on him and on the soldiers that he led, and he performed splendidly, and they won.There's no youth in that.No childhood.Taking Ender's silence and softening expression as permission to stay, Bean took another step into the room.Only then did Ender see the small slip of paper in his hand."You're transferred?"asked Ender.He was incredulous, but his voice came out sounding uninterested, dead."To Rabbit Army. "Ender nodded.Of course.It was obvious.If I can't be defeated with my army, they'll take my army away."Carn Carby's a good man," said Ender."I hope he recognizes what you're worth. ""Carn Carby was graduated today.He got his notice while we were fighting our battle. ""Well, who's commanding Rabbit then?"Bean held his hands out helplessly."Me. "Ender looked at the ceiling and nodded."Of course.After all, you're only four years younger than the regular age. ""It isn't funny.I don't know what's going on here.All the changes in the game.And now this.I wasn't the only one transferred, you know.They graduated half the commanders, and transferred a lot of our guys to command their armies. ""Which guys?""It looks like    every toon leader and every assistant. ""Of course.If they decide to wreck my army, they'll cut it to the ground.Whatever they're doing, they're thorough. ""You'll still win, Ender.We all know that.Crazy Tom, he said, 'You mean I'm supposed to figure out how to beat Dragon Army?'Everybody knows you're the best.They can't break you down, no matter what they  "  "They already have. ""No, Ender, they can't  "  "I don't care about their game anymore, Bean.I'm not going to play it anymore.No more practices.No more battles.They can put their little slips of paper on the floor all they want, but I won't go.I decided that before I went through the door today.That's why I had you go for the gate.I didn't think it would work, but I didn't care.I just wanted to go out in style. ""You should've seen William Bee's face.He just stood there trying to figure out how he had lost when you only had seven boys who could wiggle their toes and he only had three who couldn't. ""Why should I want to see William Bee's face?Why should I want to beat anybody?"Ender pressed his palms against his eyes."I hurt Bonzo really bad today, Bean.I really hurt him bad. ""He had it coming. ""I knocked him out standing up.It was like he was dead, standing there.And I kept hurting him. "Bean said nothing."I just wanted to make sure he never hurt me again. ""He won't," said Bean."They sent him home. ""Already?""The teachers didn't say much, they never do.The official notice says he was graduated, but where they put the assignment    you know, tactical school, support, precommand, navigation, that kind of thing    it just said Cartagena, Spain.That's his home. ""I'm glad they graduated him. ""Hell, Ender, we're just glad he's gone.If we'd known what he was doing to you, we would've killed him on the spot.Was it true he had a whole bunch of guys gang up on you?""No.It was just him and me.He fought with honor. "If it weren't for his honor, he and the others would have beaten me together.They might have killed me, then.His sense of honor saved my life."I didn't fight with honor," Ender added."I fought to win. "Bean laughed."And you did.Kicked him right out of orbit. "A knock on the door.Before Ender could answer, the door opened.Ender had been expecting more of his soldiers.Instead it was Major Anderson.And behind him came Colonel Graff."Ender Wiggin," said Graff.Ender got to his feet."Yes sir. ""Your display of temper in the battleroom today was insubordinate and is not to be repeated. ""Yes sir," said Ender.Bean was still feeling insubordinate, and he didn't think Ender deserved the rebuke."I think it was about time somebody told a teacher how we felt about what you've been doing. "The adults ignored him.Anderson handed Ender a sheet of paper.A full sized sheet.Not one of the little slips of paper that served for internal orders within the Battle School; it was a full fledged set of orders.Bean knew what it meant.Ender was being transferred out of the school."Graduated?"asked Bean.Ender nodded."What took them so long?You're only two or three years early.You've already learned how to walk and talk and dress yourself.What will they have left to teach you?"
