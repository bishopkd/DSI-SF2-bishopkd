'Dead' it turned out, along with three Loonies.One was a boy not more than thirteen.He had died with his hands on a Dragoon's throat and his head still sporting a little red cap.I pushed way to a public phone and reported."Go back," said Prof."and read the I. D.  of one of those guards.I want name and rank.Have you seen Finn?""No. ""He's headed there with three guns.Tell me where the booth you're in is, get that name and come back to it. "One body was gone, dragged away; Bog knows what they wanted with it.Other had been badly battered but I managed to crowd in and snatch dog chain from neck before it, too, was taken somewhere.I elbowed back to phone, found a woman at it."Lady," I said, "I've got to use that phone.Emergency!""You're welcome to it!Pesky thing's out of order. "Worked for me; Mike bad saved it.Gave Prof guard's name."Good," he said."Have you seen Finn?He'll be looking for you at that booth. ""Haven't s   Hold it, just spotted him. ""Okay, hang onto him.Mike, do you have a voice to fit that Dragoon's name?""Sorry, Prof.No. ""All right, just make it hoarse and frightened; chances are the C. O.  won't know it that well.Or would the trooper call Alvarez?""He would call his C. O.  Alvarez gives orders through him. ""So call the C. O.  Report the attack and call for help and die in the middle of it.Riot sounds behind you and maybe a shout of 'There's the dirty bastard now!'just before you die.Can you swing it?"'Programmed.No huhu," Mike said cheerfully."Run it.Mannie, put Finn on. "Prof's plan was to sucker off duty guards out of barracks and keep suckering them  with Finn's men posted to pick them off as they got out of capsules.And it worked, right up to point where Mort the Wart lost his nerve and kept remaining few to protect himself while he sent frantic messages Earthside  none of which got through.I wiggled out of Prof's discipline and took a laser gun when second capsule of Peace Dragoons was due.I burned two Goons, found blood lust gone and let other snipers have rest of squad.Too easy.They would stick heads up out of hatch and that would be that.Half of squad would not come out  until smoked out and then died with rest.By that time I was back at my advance post at phone.Warden's decision to hole up caused trouble at Complex; Alvarez was killed and so was Goon C. O.  and two of original yellow jackets.But a mixed lot of Dragoons and yellows, thirteen, holed up with Mort, or perhaps were already with him; Mike's ability to follow events by listening was spotty.But once it seemed clear that all armed effectives were inside Warden's residence, Prof ordered Mike to start next phase.Mike turned out all lights in Complex save those in Warden's residence, and reduced oxygen to gasping point  not killing point but low enough to insure that anyone looking for trouble would not be in shape.But in residence, oxygen supply was cut to zero, leaving pure nitrogen, and left that way ten minutes.At end of that time Finn's men, waiting in p suits at Warden's private tube station, broke latch on airlock and went in, "shoulder to shoulder. "Luna was ours.Book Two.A RABBLE IN ARMS      14   So a wave of patriotism swept over our new nation and unified it.Isn't that what histories say?Oh, brother!My dinkum word, preparing a revolution isn't as much huhu as having won it.Here we were, in control too soon, nothing ready and a thousand things to do.Authority in Luna was gone  but Lunar Authority Earthside and Federated Nations behind it were very much alive.Had they landed one troopship, orbited one cruiser, anytime next week or two, could have taken Luna back cheap.We were a mob.New catapult had been tested but canned rock missiles ready to go you could count on fingers of one hand  my left hand.Nor was catapult a weapon that could be used against ships, nor against troops.We had notions for fighting off ships; at moment were just notions.We had a few hundred cheap laser guns stockpiled in Hong Kong Luna  Chinee engineers are smart  but few men trained to use them.Moreover, Authority had useful functions.Bought ice and grain, sold air and water and power, held ownership or control at a dozen key points.No matter what was done in future, wheels had to turn.Perhaps wrecking city offices of Authority had been hasty (I thought so) as records were destroyed.However, Prof maintained that Loonies, all Loonies, needed a symbol to hate and destroy and those offices were least valuable and most public.But Mike controlled communications and that meant control of most everything.Prof had started with control of news to and from Earthside, leaving to Mike censorship and faking of news until we could get around to what to tell Terra, and had added sub phase "M" which cut off Complex from rest of Luna, and with it Richardson Observatory and associated laboratories  Pierce Radioscope, Selenophysical Station, and so forth.These were a problem as Terran scientists were always coming and going and staying as long as six months, stretching time by centrifuge.Most Terrans in Luna, save for a handful of tourists  thirty four  were scientists.Something had to be done about these Terrans, but meanwhile keeping them from talking to Terra was enough.For time being, Complex was cut off by phone and Mike did not permit capsules to stop at any station in Complex even after travel was resumed, which it was as soon as Finn Nielsen and squad were through with dirty work.Turned out Warden was not dead, nor had we planned to kill him; Prof figured that a live warden could always be made dead, whereas a dead one could not be made live if we needed him.So plan was to half kill him, make sure he and his guards could put up no fight, then break in fast while Mike restored oxygen.With fans turning at top speed, Mike computed it would take four minutes and a bit to reduce oxygen to effective zero  so, five minutes of increasing hypoxia, five minutes of anoxia, then force lower lock while Mike shot in pure oxygen to restore balance.This should not kill anyone  but would knock out a person as thoroughly as anesthesia.Hazard to attackers would come from some or all of those inside having p suits.But even that might not matter; hypoxia is sneaky, you can pass out without realizing you are short on oxygen.Is new chum's favorite fatal mistake.So Warden lived through it and three of his women.But Warden, though he lived, was no use; brain had been oxygen starved too long, a vegetable.No guard recovered, even though younger than he; would appear anoxia broke necks.In rest of Complex nobody was hurt.Once lights were on and oxygen restored they were okay, including six rapist murderers under lock in barracks.Finn decided that shooting was too good for them, so he went judge and used his squad as jury.They were stripped, hamstrung at ankles and wrists, turned over to women in Complex.Makes me sick to think about what happened next but don't suppose they lived through as long an ordeal as Marie Lyons endured.Women are amazing creatures  sweet, soft, gentle, and far more savage than we are.Let me mention those fink spies out of order.Wyoh had been fiercely ready to eliminate them but when we got around to them she had lost stomach.I expected Prof to agree.But he shook head."No, dear Wyoh, much as I deplore violence, there are only two things to do with an enemy: Kill him.Or make a friend of him.Anything in between piles up trouble for the future.A man who finks on his friends once will do it again and we have a long period ahead in which a fink can be dangerous; they must go.And publicly, to cause others to be thoughtful. "Wyoh said, "Professor, you once said that if you condemned a man, you would eliminate him personally.Is that what you are going to do?""Yes, dear lady, and no.Their blood shall be on my hands; I accept responsibility.But I have in mind a way more likely to discourage other finks. "So Adam Selene announced that these persons had been employed by Juan Alvarez, late Security Chief for former Authority, as undercover spies  and gave names and addresses.Adam did not suggest that anything be done.One man remained on dodge for seven months by changing warrens and name.Then early in '77 his body was found outside Novylen's lock.But most of them lasted no more than hours.During first hours after coup d'etat we were faced with a problem we had never managed to plan  Adam Selene himself.Who is Adam Selene?Where is he?This is his revolution; he handled every detail, every comrade knows his voice.We're out in open now...so where is Adam?We batted it around much of that night, in room L of Raffles  argued it between decisions on a hundred things that came up and people wanted to know what to do, while "Adam" through other voices handled other decisions that did not require talk, composed phony news to send Earthside, kept Complex isolated, many things.(Is no possible doubt: without Mike we could not have taken Luna nor held it. )My notion was that Prof should become "Adam. "Prof was always our planner and theoretician; everybody knew him; some key comrades knew that he was "Comrade Bill" and all others knew and respected Professor Bernardo de la Paz   My word, he had taught half of leading citizens in Luna City, many from other warrens, was known to every vip in Luna."No," said Prof."Why not?"asked Wyoh."Prof.you're opted.Tell him, Mike. ""Comment reserved," said Mike."I want to hear what Prof has to say. ""I say you've analyzed it, Mike," Prof answered."Wyoh dearest comrade, I would not refuse were it possible.But there is no way to make my voice match that of Adam  and every comrade knows Adam by his voice; Mike made it memorable for that very purpose. "We then considered whether Prof could be slipped in anyhow, showing him only on video and letting Mike reshape whatever Prof said into voice expected from Adam.Was turned down.Too many people knew Prof, had heard him speak; his voice and way of speaking could not be reconciled with Adam.Then they considered same possibility for me  my voice and Mike's were baritone and not too many people knew what I sounded like over phone and none over video.I tromped on it.People were going to be surprised enough to find me one of our Chairman's lieutenants; they would never believe I was number one.I said, "Let's combine deals.Adam has been a mystery all along; keep him that way.He'll be seen only over video  in a mask.Prof.you supply body; Mike, you supply voice. "Prof shook head."I can think of no surer way to destroy confidence at our most critical period than by having a leader who wears a mask.No, Mannie. "We talked about finding an actor to play it.Were no professional actors in Luna then but were good amateurs in Luna Civic Players and in Novy Bolshoi Teatr Associates."No," said Prof, "aside from finding an actor of requisite character  one who would not decide to be Napoleon  we can't wait.Adam must start handling things not later than tomorrow morning. ""In that case," I said, "you've answered it.Have to use Mike and never put him on video.Radio only.Have to figure excuse but Adam must never be seen. ""I'm forced to agree," said Prof."Man my oldest friend," said Mike, "why do you say that I can't be seen?""Haven't you listened?"I said."Mike, we have to show a face and body on video.You have a body  but it's several tons of metal.A face you don't have  lucky you, don't have to shave. ""But what's to keep me from showing a face, Man?I'm showing a voice this instant.But there's no sound behind it.I can show a face the same way. "Was so taken aback I didn't answer.I stared at video screen, installed when we leased that room.A pulse is a pulse is a pulse.Electrons chasing each other.To Mike, whole world was variable series of electrical pulses, sent or received or chasing around his innards.I said, "No, Mike. ""Why not, Man?""Because you can't!Voice you handle beautifully.Involves only a few thousand decisions a second, a slow crawl to you.But to build up video picture would require, uh, say ten million decisions every second.Mike, you're so fast I can't even think about it.But you aren't that fast. "Mike said softly, "Want to bet, Man?"Wyoh said indignantly, "Of course Mike can if he says he can!Mannie, you shouldn't talk that way. "(Wyoh thinks an electron is something about size and shape of a small pea. )"Mike," I said slowly, "I won't put money on it.Okay, want to try?Shall I switch on video?""I can switch it on," he answered."Sure you'll get right one?Wouldn't do to have this show somewhere else. "He answered testily, "I'm not stupid.Now let me be, Man  for I admit this is going to take just about all I've got. "We waited in silence.Then screen showed neutral gray with a hint of scan lines.Went black again, then a faint light filled middle and congealed into cloudy areas light and dark, ellipsoid.Not a face, but suggestion of face that one sees in cloud patterns covering Terra.It cleared a little and reminded me of pictures alleged to be ectoplasm.A ghost of a face.Suddenly firmed and we saw "Adam Selcne. "Was a still picture of a mature man.No background, just a face as if trimmed out of a print.Yet was, to me, "Adam Selene. "Could not he anybody else.Then he smiled, moving lips and jaw and touching tongue to lips, a quick gesture  and I was frightened."How do I look?"he asked."Adam," said Wyoh, "your hair isn't that curly.And it should go back on each side above your forehead.You look as if you were wearing a wig, dear. "Mike corrected it."Is that better?'"Not quite so much.And don't you have dimples?I was sure I could hear dimples when you chuckle.Like Prof's. "Mike Adam smiled again; this time he had dimples."How should I be dressed, Wyoh?""Are you at your office?""I'm still at office.Have to be, tonight. "Background turned gray, then came into focus and color.A wall calendar behind him gave date, Tuesday 19 May 2076; a clock showed correct time.Near his elbow was a carton of coffee.On desk was a solid picture, a family group, two men, a woman, four children.Was background noise, muted roar of Old Dome Plaza louder than usual; I heard shouts and in distance some singing: Simon's version of "Marseillaise. "Off screen Ginwallah's voice said, "Gospodin?"Adam turned toward it."I'm busy, Albert," he said patiently."No calls from anyone but cell B.  You handle everything else. "He looked back at us."Well, Wyoh?Suggestions?Prof?Man my doubting friend?Will I pass?"I rubbed eyes."Mike, can you cook?""Certainly.But I don't; I'm married. ""Adam," said Wyoh, "how can you look so neat after the day we've had?""I don't let little things worry me. "He looked at Prof."Professor, if the picture is okay, let's discuss what I'll say tomorrow.I was thinking of pre empting the eight hundred newscast, have it announced all night, and pass the word down the cells. "We talked rest of night.I sent up for coffee twice and Mike Adam had his carton renewed.When I ordered sandwiches, he asked Ginwallah to send out for some.I caught a glimpse of Albert Ginwallah in profile, a typical babu, polite and faintly scornful.Hadn't known what he looked like.Mike ate while we ate, sometimes mumbling around a mouthful of food.When I asked (professional interest) Mike told me that, after he had picture built up, he had programmed most of it for automatic and gave his attention just to facial expressions.But soon I forgot it was fake.Mike Adam was talking with us by video, was all, much more convenient than by phone.By oh three hundred we had policy settled, then Mike rehearsed speech.Prof found points be wanted to add; Mike made revisions, then we decided to get some rest, even Mike Adam was yawning  although in fact Mike held fort all through night, guarding transmissions to Terra, keeping Complex wailed off, listening at many phones.Prof and I shared big bed, Wyoh stretched out on couch, I whistled lights out.For once we slept without weights.While we had breakfast, Adam Selene addressed Free Luna.He was gentle, strong, warm, and persuasive."Citizens of Free Luna, friends, comrades  to those of you who do not know me let me introduce myself.I am Adam Selene.Chairman of the Emergency Committee of Comrades for Free Luna...now of Free Luna, we are free at last.The so called 'Authority' which has long unsurped power in this our home has been overthrown.I find myself temporary head of such government as we have  the Emergency Committee."Shortly, as quickly as can be arranged, you will opt your own government. "Adam smiled and made a gesture inviting help."In the meantime, with your help, I shall do my best.We will make mistakes  be tolerant.Comrades, if you have not revealed yourselves to friends and neighbors, it is time you did so.Citizens, requests may reach you through your comrade neighbors.I hope you will comply willingly; it will speed the day when I can bow out and life can get back to normal  a new normal, free of the Authority, free of guards, free of troops stationed on us, free of passports and searches and arbitrary arrests."There has to be a transition.To all of you  please go back to work, resume normal lives.To those who worked for the Authority, the need is the same.Go back to work.Wages will go on, your jobs stay the same, until we can decide what is needed, what happily no longer is needed now that we are free, and what must be kept but modified.You new citizens, transportees sweating out sentences pronounced on you Earthside  you are free, your sentences are finished!But in the meantime I hope that you will go on working.You are not required to  the days of coercion are gone  but you are urged to.You are of course free to leave the Complex, free to go anywhere...and capsule service to and from the Complex will resume at once.But before you use your new freedom to rush into town, let me remind you: 'There is no such thing as a free lunch. 'You are better off for the time being where you are; the food may not be fancy but will continue hot and on time."To take on temporarily those necessary functions of the defunct Authority I have asked the General Manager of LuNoHo Company to serve.This company will provide termporary supervision and will start analyzing how to do away with the tyrannical parts of the Authority and how to transfer the useful parts to private hands.So please help them."To you citizens of Terran nations among us, scientists and travelers and others, greetings!You are witnessing a rare event, the birth of a nation.Birth means blood and pain; there has been some.We hope it is over.You will not be inconvenienced unnecessarily and your passage home will be arranged as soon as possible.Conversely, you are welcome to stay, still more welcome to become citizens.But for the present I urge you to stay out of the corridors, avoid incidents that might lead to unnecessary blood, unnecessary pain.Be patient with us and I urge my fellow citizens to be patient with you.Scientists from Terra, at the Observatory and elsewhere, go on with your work and ignore us.Then you won't even notice that we are going through the pangs of creating a new nation.One thing   I am sorry to say that we are temporarily interfering with your right to communicate with Earthside.This we do from necessity; censorship will be lifted as quickly as possible  we hate it as much as you do. "Adam added one more request: "Don't try to see me, comrades, and phone me only if you must; all others, write if you need to, your letters will receive prompt attention.But I am not twins, I got no sleep last night and can't expect much tonight.I can't address meetings, can't shake hands, can't meet delegations; I must stick to this desk and work  so that I can get rid of this job and turn it over to your choice. "He grinned at them."Expect me to be as hard to see as Simon Jester!"It was a fifteen minute cast but that was essence: Go back to work, be patient, give us time.Those scientists gave us almost no time  I should have guessed; was my sort of pidgin.All communication Earthside channeled through Mike.But those brain boys had enough electronic equipment to stock a warehouse; once they decided to, it took them only hours to breadboard a rig that could reach Terra.Only thing that saved us was a fellow traveler who thought Luna should be free.He tried to phone Adam Selene, wound up talking to one of a squad of women we had co opted from C and D level  a system thrown together in self defense as, despite Mike's request, half of Luna tried to phone Adam Selene after that videocast, everything from requests and demands to busybodies who wanted to tell Adam how to do his job.After about a hundred calls got routed to me through too much zeal by a comrade in phone company, we set up this buffer squad.Happily, comrade lady who took this call recognized that soothe 'em down doctrine did not apply; she phoned me.Minutes later myself and Finn Nielsen plus some eager guns headed by capsule for laboratory area.Our informant was scared to give name but had told me where to find transmitter.We caught them transmitting, and only fast action on Finn's part kept them breathing; his boys were itchy.But we did not want to "make an example"; Finn and I had settled that on way out.Is hard to frighten scientists, their minds don't work that way.Have to get at them from other angles.I kicked that transmitter to pieces and ordered Director to have everyone assemble in mess hall and required roll call  where a phone could hear.Then I talked to Mike, got names from him, and said to Director: "Doctor, you told me they were all here.We're missing so and so"  seven names."Get them here!"Missing Terrans had been notified, had refused to stop what they were doing  typical scientists.Then I talked, Loonies on one side of room, Terrans on other.To Terrans I said; "We tried to treat you as guests.But three of you tried and perhaps succeeded in sending message Earthside. "I turned to Director."Doctor, I could search  warren, surface structures, all labs, every space  and destroy everything that might be used for transmitter.I'm electron pusher by trade; I know what wide variety of components can be converted into transmitters.Suppose I destroy everything that might be useful for that and, being stupid, take no chance and smash anything I don't understand.What result?"Would have thought I was about to kill his baby!He turned gray."That would stop every research...destroy priceless data.., waste, oh, I don't know how much!Call it a half billion dollars!""So I thought.Could take all that gear instead of smashing and let you go on best you can. ""That would be almost as bad.You must understand, Gospodin, that when an experiment is interrupted  "  "I know.Easier than moving anything  and maybe missing some  is to take you all to Complex and quarter you there.We have what used to be Dragoon barracks.But that too would ruin experiments.Besides   Where you from, Doctor?""Princeton, New Jersey. ""So?You've been here five months and no doubt exercising and wearing weights.Doctor, if we did that, you might never see Princeton again.If we move you, we'll keep you locked up.You'll get soft.If emergency goes on very long, you'll be a Loonie like it or not.And all your brainy help with you. "A cocky chum stepped forward  one who had to be sent for twice."You can't do this!It's against the law!""What law, Gospodin?Some law back in your hometown?"I turned."Finn, show him law. "Finn stepped forward and placed emission bell of gun at man's belly button.Thumb started to press down  safety switched, I could see.I said, "Don't kill him, Finn!"then went on: "I will eliminate this man if that's what it takes to convince you.So watch each other!One more offense will kill all your chances of seeing home again  as well as ruining researches.Doctor, I warn you to find ways to keep check on your staff. "I turned to Loonies."Tovarishchee, keep them honest.Work up own guard system.Don't take nonsense; every earthworm is on probation.If you have to eliminate some, don't hesitate. "I turned to Director."Doctor, any Loonie can go anywhere any time  even your bedroom.Your assistants are now your bosses so far as security is concerned; if a Loonie decides to follow you or anybody into a W. C. , don't argue; he might be jumpy. "I turned to Loonies."Security first!You each work for some earthworm  watch him!Split it among you and don't miss anything.Watch 'em so close they can't build mouse trap, much less transmitter.If interferes with work for them, don't worry; wages will go on. "Could see grins.Lab assistant was best job a Loonie could find those days  but they worked under earthworms who looked down on us, even ones who pretended and were oh so gracious.I let it go at that.When I had been phoned, I had intended to eliminate offenders.But Prof and Mike set me straight: Plan did not permit violence against Terrans that could be avoided.We set up "ears," wideband sensitive receivers, around lab area, since even most directional rig spills a little in neighborhood.And Mike listened on all phones in area, After that we chewed nails and hoped.Presently we relaxed as news up from Earthside showed nothing, they seemed to accept censored transmissions without suspicion, and private and commercial traffic and Authority's transmissions all seemed routine.Meanwhile we worked, trying in days what should take months.We received one break in timing; no passenger ship was on Luna and none was due until 7 July.We could have coped  suckered a ship's officers to "dine with Warden" or something, then mounted guard on its senders or dismantled them.Could not have lifted without our help; in those days one drain on ice was providing water for reaction mass.Was not much drain compared with grain shipments; one manned ship a month was heavy traffic then, while grain lifted every day.What it did mean was that an incoming ship was not an insuperable hazard.Nevertheless was lucky break; we were trying so hard to make everything look normal until we could defend ourselves.Grain shipments went on as before; one was catapulted almost as Finn's men were breaking into Warden's residence.And next went out on time, and all others.Neither oversight nor faking for interim; Prof knew what he was doing.Grain shipments were a big operation (for a little country like Luna) and couldn't be changed in one semi lunar; bread and beer of too many people was involved.If our committee had ordered embargo and quit buying grain, we would have been chucked out and a new committee with other ideas would have taken over.Prof said that an educational period was necessary.Meanwhile grain barges catapulted as usual; LuNoHoCo kept books and issued receipts, using civil service personnel.Dispatches went out in Warden's name and Mike talked to Authority Earthside, using Warden's voice.Deputy Administrator proved reasonable, once he understood it upped his life expectancy.Chief Engineer stayed on job, too  McIntyre was a real Loonie, given chance, rather than fink by nature.Other department heads and minor stooges were no problem; life went on as before and we were too busy to unwind Authority system and put useful parts up for sale.Over a dozen people turned up claiming to be Simon Jester; Simon wrote a rude verse disclairning them and had picture on front page of Lunatic, Pravda, and Gong.Wyoh let herself go blond and made trip to see Greg at new catapult site, then a longer trip, ten days, to old home in Hong Kong Luna, taking Anna who wanted to see it.Wyoh needed a vacation and Prof urged her to take it, pointing on that she was in touch by phone and that closer Party contact was needed in Hong Kong.I took over her stilyagi with Slim and Hazel as my lieutenants  bright, sharp kids I could trust.Slim was awed to discover that I was "Comrade Bork" and saw "Adam Selene" every day; his Party name started with "G. "Made a good team for other reason, too.Hazel suddenly started showing cushiony curves and not all from Mimi's superb table; she had reached that point in her orbit.Slim was ready to change her name to "Stone" any time she was willing to opt.In meantime he was anxious to do Party work he could share with our fierce little redhead.Not everybody was willing.Many comrades turned out to be talk talk soldiers.Still more thought war was over once we had eliminated Peace Goons and captured Warden.Others were indignant to learn how far down they were in Party structure; they wanted to elect a new structure, themselves at top.Adam received endless calls proposing this or something like it  would listen, agree, assure them that their services must not be wasted by waiting for election  and refer them to Prof or me.Can't recall any of these ambitious people who amounted to anything when I tried to put them to work.Was endless work and nobody wanted to do it.Well, a few.Some best volunteers were people Party had never located.But in general, Loonies in and out of Party had no interest in "patriotic" work unless well paid.One chum who claimed to be a Party member (was not) spragged me in Raffles where we set up headquarters and wanted me to contract for fifty thousand buttons to be worn by pre coup "Veterans of Revolution"  a "small" profit for him (I estimate 400 percent markup), easy dollars for me, a fine thing for everybody.When I brushed him off, he threatened to denounce me to Adam Selene  "A very good friend of mine, I'll have you know!"for sabotage.That was "help" we got.What we needed was something else.Needed steel at new catapult and plenty  Prof asked, if really necessary to put steel around rock missiles; I had to point out that an induction field won't grab bare rock.We needed to relocate Mike's ballistic radars at old site and install doppler radar at new site  both jobs because we could expect attacks from space at old site.We called for volunteers, got only two who could be used  and needed several hundred mechanics who did not mind hard work in p suits.So we hired, paying what we had to   LuNoHoCo went in hock to Bank of Hong Kong Luna; was no time to steal that much and most funds had been transferred Earthside to Stu.A dinkum comrade, Foo Moses Morris, co signed much paper to keep us going  and wound up broke and started over with a little tailoring shop in Kongville.That was later.Authority Scrip dropped from 3 to 1 to 17 to 1 after coup and civil service people screamed, as Mike was still paying in Authority checks.We said they could stay on or resign; then those we needed, we rehired with Hong Kong dollars.But created a large group not on our side from then on; they longed for good old days and were ready to stab new regime.Grain farmers and brokers were unhappy because payment at catapult head continued to be Authority scrip at same old fixed prices."We won't take it!"they cried  and LuNoHoCo man would shrug and tell them they didn't have to but this grain still went to Authority Earthside (it did) and Authority scrip was all they would get.So take cheque, or load your grain back into rolligons and get it out of here.Most took it.All grumbled and some threatened to get out of grain and start growing vegetables or fibers or something that brought Hong Kong dollars  and Prof smiled.We needed every drillman in Luna, especially ice miners who owned heavy duty laser drills.As soldiers.We needed them so badly that, despite being shy one wing and rusty, I considered joining up, even though takes muscle to wrestle a big drill, and prosthetic just isn't muscle.Prof told me not to be a fool.Dodge we had in mind would not work well Earthside; a laser beam carrying heavy power works best in vacuum  but there it works just dandy for whatever range its collimation is good for.These big drills, which had carved through rock seeking pockets of ice, were now being mounted as "artillery" to repel space attacks.Both ships and missiles have electronic nervous systems and does electronic gear no good to blast it with umpteen joules placed in a tight beam.If target is pressured (as manned ships are and most missiles), all it takes is to burn a hole, depressure it.If not pressured, a heavy laser beam can still kill it  burn eyes, louse guidance, spoil anything depending on electronics as most everything does.An H bomb with circuitry ruined is not a bomb, is just big tub of lithium deuteride that can't do anything but crash.A ship with eyes gone is a derelict, not a warship.Sounds easy, is not.Those laser drills were never meant for targets a thousand kilometers away, or even one, and was no quick way to rig their cradles for accuracy.Gunner had to have guts to hold fire until last few seconds  on a target heading at him maybe two kilometers per second.But was best we had, so we organized First and Second Volunteer Defense Gunners of Free Luna  two regiments so that First could snub lowly Second and Second could be Jealous of First.First got older men, Second got young and eager.Having called them "volunteers," we hired in Hong Kong dollars  and was no accident that ice was being paid for in controlled market in wastepaper Authority script.On top of all, we were talking up a war scare.Adam Selene talked over video, reminding that Authority was certain to try to regain its tyranny and we had only days to prepare; papers quoted him and published stories of their own  we had made special effort to recruit newsmen before coup.People were urged to keep p suits always near and to test pressure alarms in homes.A volunteer Civil Defense Corps was organized in each warren.What with moonquakes always with us, each warren's pressure co op always had sealing crews ready at any hour.Even with silicone stay soft and fiberglass any warren leaks.In Davis Tunnels our boys did maintenance on seal every day.But now we recruited hundreds of emergency sealing crews, mostly stilyagi, drilled them with fake emergencies, had them stay in p suits with helmets open when on duty.They did beautifully.But idiots made fun of them  "play soldiers," "Adam's little apples," other names.A team was going through a drill, showing they could throw a temporary lock around one that had been damaged, and one of these pinheads stood by and rode them loudly.Civil Defense team went ahead, completed temporary lock, tested it with helmets closed; it held  came out, grabbed this joker, took him through into temporary lock and on out into zero pressure, dumped him.Belittlers kept opinions to selves after that.Prof thought we ought to send out a gentle warning not to eliminate so peremptorily.I opposed it and got my way; could see no better way to improve breed.Certain types of loudmouthism should be a capital offense among decent people.But our biggest headaches were self anointed statesmen.Did I say that Loonies are "non politica1"?They are, when comes to doing anything.But doubt if was ever a time two Loonies over a liter of beer did not swap loud opinions about how things ought to be run.As mentioned, these self appointed political scientists tried to grab Adam Selene's ear.But Prof had a place for them; each was invited to take part in "Ad Hoc Congress for Organization of Free Luna"  which met in Community Hall in Luna City, then resolved to stay in session until work was done, a week in L City, a week in Novylen, then Hong Kong, and start over.All sessions were in video.Prof presided over first and Adam Selene addressed them by video and encouraged them to do a thorough job  "History is watching you. "I listened to some sessions, then cornered Prof and asked what in Bog's name he was up to?"Thought you didn't want any government.Have you heard those nuts since you turned them loose?"He smiled most dimply smile."What's troubling you, Manuel?"Many things were troubling me.With me breaking heart trying to round up heavy drills and men who could treat them as guns these idlers had spent an entire afternoon discussing immigration.Some wanted to stop it entirely.Some wanted to tax it, high enough to finance government (when ninety nine out of a hundred Loonies had had to be dragged to The Rock!); some wanted to make it selective by "ethnic ratios. "(Wondered how they would count me?)Some wanted to limit it to females until we were 50 50.That had produced a Scandinavian shout: "Ja, cobber!Tell 'em send us hoors!Tousands and tousands of hoors!I marry 'em, I betcha!"Was most sensible remark all afternoon.Another time they argued "time. "Sure, Greenwich time bears no relation to lunar.But why should it when we live Underground?Show me a Loonie who can sleep two weeks and work two weeks; lunars don't fit our metabolism.What was urged was to make a lunar exactly equal to twenty eight days (instead of 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes, 2.78 seconds) and do this by making days longer  and hours, minutes, and seconds, thus making each semi lunar exactly two weeks.Sure, lunar is necessary for many purposes.Controls when we go up on surface, why we go, and how long we stay.But, aside from throwing us out of gear with our only neighbor, had that wordy vacuum skull thought what this would do to every critical figure in science and engineering?As an electronics man I shuddered.Throw away every book, table, instrument, and start over?I know that some of my ancestors did that in switching from old English units to MKS  but they did it to make things easier.Fourteen inches to a foot and some odd number of feet to a mile.Ounces and pounds.Oh, Bog!Made sense to change that  but why go out of your way to create confusion?Somebody wanted a committee to determine exactly what Loonie language is, then fine everybody who talked Earthside English or other language.Oh, my people!I read tax proposals in Lunatic  four sorts of "SingleTaxers"  a cubic tax that would penalize a man if he extended tunnels, a head tax (everybody pay same), income tax (like to see anyone figure income of Davis Family or try to get information out of Mum!), and an "air tax" which was not fees we paid then but something else.Hadn't realized "Free Luna" was going to have taxes.Hadn't had any before and got along.You paid for what you got.Tanstaafl.How else?Another time some pompous choom proposed that bad breath and body odors be made an elimination offense.Could almost sympathize, having been stuck on occasion in a capsule with such stinks.But doesn't happen often and tends to be self correcting; chronic offenders, or unfortunates who can't correct, aren't likely to reproduce, seeing how choosy women are.One female (most were men, but women made up for it in silliness) had a long list she wanted made permanent laws  about private matters.No more plural marriage of any sort.No divorces.No "fornication"  had to look that one up.No drinks stronger than 4% beer.Church services only on Saturdays and all else to stop that day.(Air and temperature and pressure engineering, lady?Phones and capsules?)A long list of drugs to be prohibited and a shorter list dispensed only by licensed physicians.(What is a "licensed physician"?Healer I go to has a sign reading "practical doctor"  makcs book on side, which is why I go to him.Look, lady, aren't any medical schools in Luna!)(Then, I mean. )She even wanted to make gambling illegal.If a Loonie couldn't roll double or nothing, he would go to a shop that would, even if dice were loaded.Thing that got me was not her list of things she hated, since she was obviously crazy as a Cyborg, but fact that always somebody agreed with her prohibitions.Must be a yearning deep in human heart to stop other people from doing as they please.Rules, laws  always for other fellow.A murky part of us, something we had before we came down out of trees, and failed to shuck when we stood up.Because not one of those people said: "Please pass this so that I won't be able to do something I know I should stop. "Nyet, tovarishchee, was always something they hated to see neighbors doing.Stop them "for their own good"  not because speaker claimed to be harmed by it.Listening to that session I was almost sorry we got rid of Mort the Wart.He stayed holed up with his women and didn't tell us how to run private lives.But Prof didn't get excited; he went on smiling."Manuel, do you really think that mob of retarded children can pass any laws?""You told them to.Urged them to. ""My dear Manuel, I was simply putting all my nuts in one basket.I know those nuts; I've listened to them for years.I was very careful in selecting their committees; they all have built in confusion, they will quarrel.The chairman I forced on them while letting them elect him is a ditherer who could not unravel a piece of string  thinks every subject needs 'more study. 'I almost needn't have bothered; more than six people cannot agree on anything, three is better  and one is perfect for a job that one can do.This is why parliamentary bodies all through history, when they accomplished anything, owed it to a few strong men who dominated the rest.Never fear, son, this Ad Hoc Congress will do nothing...or if they pass something through sheer fatigue, it will be so loaded with contradictions that it will have to be thrown out.In the meantime they are out of our hair.Besides, there is something we need them for, later. ""Thought you said they could do nothing. ""They won't do this.One man will write it  a dead man  and late at night when they are very tired, they'll pass it by acclamation. ""Who's this dead man?You don't mean Mike?""No, no!Mike is far more alive than those yammerheads.The dead man is Thomas Jefferson  first of the rational anarchists, my boy, and one who once almost managed to slip over his non system through the most beautiful rhetoric ever written.But they caught him at it, which I hope to avoid.I cannot improve on his phrasing; I shall merely adapt it to Luna and the twenty first century. ""Heard of him, Freed slaves, nyet?""One might say he tried but failed.Never mind.How are the defenses progressing?I don't see how we can keep up the pretense past the arrival date of this next ship. ""Can't be ready then. ""Mike says we must be. "We weren't but ship never arrived.Those scientists outsmarted me and Loonies I had told to watch them.Was a rig at focal point of biggest reflector and Loonie assistants believed doubletalk about astronomical purpose  a new wrinkle in radiotelescopes.I suppose it was.Was ultramicrowave and stuff was bounced at reflector by a wave guide and thus left scope lined up nicely by mirror.Remarkably like early radar.And metal latticework and foil heat shield of barrel stopped stray radiation, thus "ears" I had staked out heard nothing.They put message across, their version and in detail.First we heard was demand from Authority to Warden to deny this hoax, find hoaxer, put stop to it.So instead we gave them a Declaration of Independence."In Congress assembled, July Fourth, Twenty Seventy Six  "  Was beautiful.15   Signing of Declaration of Independence went as Prof said it would.He sprang it on them at end of long day, announced a special session after dinner at which Adam Selene would speak.Adam read aloud, discussing each sentence, then read it without stopping, making music of sonorous phrases.People wept.Wyoh, seated by me, was one, and I felt like it even though had read it earlier.Then Adam looked at them and said, "The future is waiting.Mark well what you do," and turned meeting over to Prof rather than usual chairman.Was twenty two hundred and fight began.Sure, they were in favor of it; news all day had been jammed with what bad boys we were, how we were to be punished, taught a lesson, so forth.Not necessary to spice it up; stuff up from Earthside was nasty  Mike merely left out on other hand opinions.If ever was a day when Luna felt unified it was probably second of July 2076.So they were going to pass it; Prof knew that before he offered it.But not as written  "Honorable Chairman, in second paragraph, that word 'unalienable,' is no such word; should be 'inalienable'  and anyhow wouldn't it be more dignified to say 'sacred rights' rather than 'inalienable rights'?I'd like to hear discussion on this. "That choom was almost sensible, merely a literary critic, which is harmless, like dead yeast left in beer.But   Well, take that woman who hated everything.She was there with list; read it aloud and moved to have it incorporated into Declaration "so that the peoples of Terra will know that we are civilized and fit to take our places in the councils of mankind!"Prof not only let her get away with it; he encouraged her, letting her talk when other people wanted to  then blandly put her proposal to a vote when hadn't even been seconded.(Congress operated by rules they had wrangled over for days.Prof was familiar with rules but followed them only as suited him. )She was voted down in a shout, and left.Then somebody stood up and said of course that long list didn't belong in Declaration  but shouldn't we have general principles?Maybe a statement that Luna Free State guaranteed freedom, equality, and security to all?Nothing elaborate, just those fundamental principles that everybody knew was proper purpose of goiverament.True enough and let's pass it  but must read "Freedom, equality, peace, and security"  right, Comrade?They wrangled over whether "freedom" included "free air," or was that part of "security"?Why not be on safe side and list "free air" by name?Move to amend to make it "free air and water"  because you didn't have "freedom" or "security" unless you had both air and water.Air, water, and food.Air, water, food, and cubic.Air, water, food, cubic, and heat.No, make "heat" read "power" and you had it all covered.Everything.Cobber, have you lost your mind?That's far from everything and what you've left out is an affront to all womankind   Step outside and say that!Let me finish.We've got to tell them right from deal that we will permit no more ships to land unless they carry at least as many women as men.At least, I said  and I for one won't chop it unless it sets immigration issue straight.Prof never lost dimples.Began to see why Prof had slept all day and was not wearing weights.Me, I was tired, having spent all day in p suit out beyond catapult head cutting in last of relocated ballistic radars.And everybody was tired; by midnight crowd began to thin, convinced that nothing would be accomplished that night and bored by any yammer not their own.Was later than midnight when someone asked why this Declaration was dated fourth when today was second?Prof said mildly that it was July third now  and it seemed unlikely that our Declaration could be announced earlier than fourth and that July fourth carried historical symbolism that might help.Several people walked out at announcement that probably nothing would be settled until fourth of July.But I began to notice something: Hall was filling as fast as was emptying.Finn Nielsen slid into a seat that had just been vacated.Comrade Clayton from Hong Kong showed up, pressed my shoulder, smiled at Wyoh, found a seat.My youngest lieutenants.Slim and Hazel, I spotted down front  and was thinking I must alibi Hazel by telling Mum I had kept her out on Parts business  when was amused to see Mum herself next to them.And Sidris.And Greg, who was supposed to be at new catapult.Looked around and picked out a dozen more  night editor of Lunaya Pravda, General Manager of LuNoHoCo, others, and each one a working comrade, Began to see that Prof had stacked deck.That Congress never had a fixed membership; these dinkum comrades had as much right to show up as those who had been talking a month.Now they sat  and voted down amendments.About three hundred, when I was wondering how much more I could take, someone brought a note to Prof.He read it, banged gavel and said, "Adam Selene begs your indulgence.Do I hear unanimous consent?"So screen back of rostrum lighted up again and Adam told them that he had been following debate and was warmed by many thoughtful and constructive criticisms.But could he made a suggestion?Why not admit that any piece of writing was imperfect?If thin declaration was in general what they wanted, why not postpone perfection for another day and pass this as it stands?"Honorable Chairman, I so move. "They passed it with a yell.Prof said, "Do I hear objection?"and waited with gavel raised.A man who had been talking when Adam had asked to be heard said, "Well,...still say that's a dangling participle, but okay, leave it in. "Prof hanged gavel."So ordered!"Then we filed up and put our chops on a big scroll that had been "sent over from Adam's office"   and I noticed Adam's chop on it.I signed right under Hazel  child now could write although was still short on book learning.Her chop was shaky but she wrote it large and proud.Comrade Clayton signed his Party name, real name in letters, and Japanese chop, three little pictures one above other.Two comrades chopped with X's and had them witnessed.All Party leaders were there that night (morning), all chopped it, and not more than a dozen yammerers stuck.But those who did, put their chops down for history to read.And thereby committed "their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honors. "While queue was moving slowly past and people were talking, Prof banged for attention."I ask for volunteers for a dangerous mission.This Declaration will go on the news channels  but must be presented in person to the Federated Nations, on Terra. "That put stop to noise.Prof was looking at me.I swallowed and said, "I volunteer. "Wyoh echoed, "So do I!"and little Hazel Meade said, "Me, too!"In moments were a dozen, from Finn Nielsen to Gospodin Dangling Participle (turned out to be good cobber aside from his fetish).Prof took names, murmured something about getting in touch as transportation became available.I got Prof aside and said, "Look, Prof, you too tired to track?You know ship for seventh was canceled; now they're talking about slapping embargo on us.Next ship they lift for Luna will be a warship.How you planning to travel?As prisoner?""Oh, we won't use their ships. ""So?Going to build one?Any idea how long that takes?If could build one at all.Which I doubt. ""Manuel, Mike says it's necessary  and has it all worked out. "I did know Mike said was necessary; he had rerun problem soon as we learned that bright laddies at Richardson had snuck one home  he now gave us only one chance in fifty three...with imperative need for Prof to go Earthside.But I'm not one to worry about impossibilities; I had spent day working to make that one chance in fifty three turn up."Mike will provide the ship," Prof went on."He has completed its design and it is being worked on. ""He has?It is?Since when is Mike engineer?""Isn't he?"asked Prof.I started to answer, shut up.Mike had no degrees.Simply knew more engineering than any man alive.Or about Shakespeare's plays, or riddles, or history, name it."Tell me more. ""Manuel, we'll go to Terra as a load of grain. ""What?Who's 'we'?""You and myself.The other volunteers are merely decorative. "I said, "Look, Prof.I've stuck.Worked hard when whole thing seemed silly.Worn these weights  got 'em on now  on chance I might have to go to that dreadful place.But contracted to go in a ship, with at least a Cyborg pilot to help me get down safely.Did not agree to go as meteorite. "He said, "Very well, Manuel.I believe in free choice, always.Your alternate will go. ""My   Who?""Comrade Wyoming.So far as I know she is the only other person in training for the trip...other than a few Terrans. "So I went.But talked to Mike first.He said patiently."Man my first friend, there isn't a thing to worry about.You are scheduled load KM187 series '76 and you'll arrive in Bombay with no trouble.But to be sure  to reassure you  I selected that barge because it will be taken out of parking orbit and landed when India is faced toward me, and I've added an override so that I can take you away from ground control if I don't like the way they handle you.Trust me, Man, it has all been thought through.Even the decision to continue shipments when security was broken was part of this plan. ""Might have told me. ""There was no need to worry you.Professor had to know and I've kept in touch with him.But you are going simply to take care of him and back him up  do his job if he dies, a factor on which I can give you no reassurance. "I sighed."Okay.But, Mike, surely you don't think you can pilot a barge into a soft landing at this distance?Speed of light alone would trip you. ""Man, don't you think I understand ballistics?For the orbital position then, from query through reply and then to command received is under four seconds...and you can rely on me not to waste microseconds.Your maximum parking orbit travel in four seconds is only thirty two kilometers, diminishing asymptotically to zero at landing.My reflex time will be effectively less than that of a pilot in a manual landing because I don't waste time grasping a situation and deciding on correct action.So my maximum is four seconds.But my effective reflex time is much less, as I project and predict constantly, see ahead, program it out  in effect, I'll stay four seconds ahead of you in your trajectory and respond instantly. ""That steel can doesn't even have an altimeter!""It does now.Man, please believe me; I've thought of everything.The only reason I've ordered this extra equipment is to reassure you.Poona ground control hasn't made a bobble in the last five thousand loads.For a computer it's fairly bright. ""Okay.Uh, Mike, how hard do they splash those bleeding barges?What gee?""Not high, Man.Ten gravities at injection, then that programs down to a steady, soft four gees...then you'll be nudged again between six and five gees just before splash.The splash itself is gentle, equal to a fall of fifty meters and you enter ogive first with no sudden shock, less than three gees.Then you surface and splash again, lightly, and simply float at one gee.Man, those barge shells are built as lightly as possible for economy's sake.We can't afford to toss them around or they would split their seams. ""How sweet.Mike, what would 'six to five gees' do to you?Split your seams?""I conjecture that I was subjected to about six gravities when they shipped me up here.Six gravities in my present condition would shear many of my essential connections.However, I'm more interested in the extremely high, transient accelerations I am going to experience from shock waves when Terra starts bombing us.Data are insufficient for prediction but I may lose control of my outlying functions, Man.This could be a major factor in any tactical situation. ""Mike, you really think they are going to bomb us?""Count on it, Man.That is why this trip is so important. "Left it at that and went out to see this coffin.Should have stayed home.Ever looked at one of those silly barges?Just a steel cylinder with retro and guidance rockets and radar transponder.Resembles a spaceship way a pair of pliers resembles my number three arm.They had this one cut open and were outfitting our "living quarters. "No galley.No W. C.  No nothing.Why bother?We were going to be in it only fifty hours.Start empty so that you won't need a honey sack in your suit.Dispense with lounge and bar; you'll never be out of your suit, you'll be drugged and not caring.At least Prof would be drugged almost whole time; I had to be alert at landing to try to get us out of this death trap if something went wrong and nobody came along with a tin opener.They were building a shaped cradle in which backs of our p suits would fit; we would be strapped into these holes.And stay there, clear to Terra.They seemed more concerned about making total mass equal to displaced wheat and same center of gravity and all moment arms adding up correctly than they did about our comfort; engineer in charge told me that even padding to be added inside our p suits was figured in.Was glad to learn we were going to have padding; those holes did not look soft.Returned home in thoughtful condition.Wyoh was not at dinner, unusual; Greg was, more unusual.Nobody said anything about my being scheduled to imitate a falling rock next day although all knew.But did not realize anything special was on until all next generation left table without being told.Then knew why Greg had not gone back to Mare Undarum site after Congress adjourned that morning; somebody had asked for a Family talk talk.Mum looked around and said, "We're all here.Ali, shut that door; that's a dear.Grandpaw, will you start us?"Our senior husband stopped nodding over coffee and firmed up.He looked down table and said strongly, "I see that we are all here.I see that children have been put to bed.I see that there is no stranger, no guest.I say that we are met in accordance with customs created by Black Jack Davis our First Husband and Tillie our First Wife.If there is any matter that concerns safety and happiness of our marriage, haul it out in the light now.Don't let it fester.This is our custom. "Grandpaw turned to Mum and said softly, "Take it, Mimi," and slumped back into gentle apathy.But for a minute he had been strong, handsome, virile, dynamic man of days of my opting...and I thought with sudden tears how lucky I had been!Then didn't know whether I felt lucky or not.Only excuse I could see for a Family talk talk was fact that I was due to be shipped Earthside next day, labeled as grain.Could Mum be thinking of trying to set Family against it?Nobody had to abide by results of a talk talk.But one always did.That was strength of our marriage: When came down to issues, we stood together.Mimi was saying, "Does anyone have anything that needs to be discussed?Speak up, dears. "Greg said, "I have. ""We'll listen to Greg. "Greg is a good speaker.Can stand up in front of a congregation and speak with confidence about matters I don't feel confident about even when alone.But that night he seemed anything but sure of himself."Well, uh, we've always tried to keep this marriage in balance, some old, some young, a regular alternation, well spaced, just as it was handed down to us.But we've varied sometimes  for good reason. "He looked at Ludmilla."And adjusted it later. "He looked again at far end of table, at Frank and Ali, on each side of Ludmilla."Over years, as you can see from records, average age of husbands has been about forty, wives about thirty five  and that age spread was just what our marriage started with, nearly a hundred years gone by, for Tillie was fifteen when she opted Black Jack and he had just turned twenty.Right now I find that average age of husbands is almost exactly forty, while average  "  Mum said firmly, "Never mind arithmetic, Greg dear.Simply state it. "I was trying to think who Greg could possibly mean.True, I had been much away during past year, and if did get home, was often after everybody was asleep.But he was clearly talking about marriage and nobody ever proposes another wedding in our marriage without first giving everybody a long careful chance to look prospect over.You just didn't do it any other way!So I'm stupid.Greg stuttered and said, "I propose Wyoming Knott!"I said I was stupid.I understand machinery and machinery understands me.But didn't claim to know anything about people.When I get to be senior husband, if live that long, am going to do exactly what Grandpaw does with Mum: Let Sidris run it.Just same   Well, look, Wyoh joined Greg's church.I like Greg, love Greg.And admire him.But you could never feed theology of his church through a computer and get anything but null.Wyoh surely knew this, since she encountered it in adult years  truthfully, I had suspected that Wyoh's conversion was proof that she would do anything for our Cause.But Wyoh had recruited Greg even earlier.And had made most of trips out to new site, easier for her to get away than me or Prof.Oh, well.Was taken by surprise.Should not have been.Mimi said, "Greg, do you have reason to think that Wyoming would accept an opting from us?""Yes. ""Very well.We all know Wyoming; I'm sure we've formed our opinions of her.I see no reason to discuss it...unless someone has something to say?Speak up. "Was no surprise to Mum.But wouldn't be.Nor to anyone else, either, since Mum never let a talk talk take place until she was sure of outcome.But wondered why Mum was sure of my opinion, so certain that she had not felt me out ahead of time?And sat there in a soggy quandary, knowing I should speak up, knowing I knew something terribly pertinent which nobody else knew or matter would never have gone this far.Something that didn't matter to me but would matter to Mum and all our women.Sat there, miserable coward, and said nothing, Mum said, "Very well.Let's call the roll.Ludmilla?""Me?Why, I love Wyoh, everybody knows that.Sure!""Lenore dear?""Well, I may try to talk her into going back to being a brownie again; I think we set each other off.But that's her only fault, being blonder than I am.Da!""Sidris?""Thumbs up.Wyoh is our kind of people. ""Anna?""I've something to say before I express my opinion, Mimi. '"I don't think it's necessary, dear. ""Nevertheless I'm going to haul it out in the open, just as Tillie always did according to our traditions.In this marriage every wife has carried her load, given children to the family.It may come as a surprise to some of you to learn that Wyoh has had eight children  "  Certainly surprised Ali; his head jerked and jaw dropped.I stared at plate.Oh, Wyoh, Wyoh!How could I let this happen?Was going to have to speak up.And realized Anna was still speaking: "  so now she can have children of her own; the operation was successful.But she worries about possibility of another defective baby, unlikely as that is according to the head of the clinic in Hong Kong.So we'll just have to love her enough to make her quit fretting. ""We will love her," Mum said serenely."We do love her.Anna, are you ready to express opinion?""Hardly necessary, is it?I went to Hong Kong with her, held her hand while her tubes were restored.I opt Wyoh. ""In this family," Mum went on, "we have always felt that our husbands should be allowed a veto.Odd of us perhaps, hut Tillie started it and it has always worked well.Well, Grandpaw?""Eh?What were you saying, my dear?""We are opting Wyoming, Gospodin Grandpaw.Do you give consent?""What?Why, of course, of course!Very nice little girl.Say, whatever became of that pretty little Afro, name something like that?She get mad at us?""Greg?""I proposed it. ""Manuel?Do you forbid this?""Me?Why, you know me, Mum. ""I do.I sometimes wonder if you know you.Hans?""What would happen if I said No?""You'd lose some teeth, that's what," Lenore said promptly."Hans votes Yes. ""Stop it, darlings," Mum said with soft reproof."Opting is a serious matter.Hans, speak up. ""Da.Yes.Ja.Oui.Si.High time we had a pretty blonde in this   Ouch!""Stop it, Lenore.Frank?""Yes, Mum. ""Ali dear?Is it unanimous?"Lad blushed bright pink and couldn't talk.Nodded vigorously.Instead of appointing a husband and a wife to seek out selectee and propose opting for us, Mum sent Ludmilla and Anna to fetch Wyoh at once  and turned out she was only as far away as Bon Ton.Nor was that only irregularity; instead of setting a date and arranging a wedding party, our children were called in, and twenty minutes later Greg had his Book open and we did the taking vows  and I finally got it through my confused head that was being done with breakneck speed because of my date to break my neck next day.Not that it could matter save as symbol of my family's love for me, since a bride spent her first night with her senior husband, and second night and third I was going to spend out in space.But did matter anyhow and when women started to cry during ceremony, I found self dripping tears right with them.Then I went to bed, alone in workshop, once Wyoh had kissed us and left on Grandpaw's arm.Was terribly tired and last two days had been hard.Thought about exercises and decided was too late to matter; thought about calling Mike and asking him for news from Terra.Went to bed.Don't know how long had been asleep when realized was no longer asleep and somebody was in room."Manuel?"came soft whisper in dark."Huh?Wyoh, you aren't supposed to be here, dear. ""I am indeed supposed to be here, my husband.Mum knows I'm here, so does Greg.And Grandpaw went right to sleep. ""Oh.What time is?""About four hundred.Please, dear, may I come to bed?""What?Oh, certainly. "Something I should remember.Oh, yes."Mike!""Yes, Man?"he answered."Switch off.Don't listen.If you want me, call me on Family phone. ""So Wyoh told me, Man.Congratulations!"Then her head was pillowed on my stump and I put right arm around her."What are you crying about, Wyoh?""I'm not crying!I'm just frightened silly that you won't come back!"16   Woke up scared silly in pitch darkness."Manuel!"Didn't know which end was up."Manuel!"it called again."Wake up!"That brought me out some; was signal intended to trigger me.Recalled being stretched on a table in infirmary at Complex, staring up at a light and listening to a voice while a drug dripped into my veins.But was a hundred years ago, endless time of nightmares, unendurable pressure, pain.Knew now what no end is up feeling was; had experienced before.Free fall.Was in space.What had gone wrong?Had Mike dropped a decimal point?Or had he given in to childish nature and played a joke, not realizing would kill?Then why, after all years of pain, was I alive?Or was I?Was this normal way for ghost to feel, just lonely, lost, nowhere?"Wake up, Manuel!Wake up, Manuel!""Oh, shut up!"I snarled."Button your filthy king and ace!"Recording went on; I paid no attention.Where was that reeking light switch?No, doesn't take a century of pain to accelerate to Luna's escape speed at three gravities, merely feels so.Eighty two seconds  but is one time when human nervous system feels every microsecond.Three gees is eighteen grim times as much as a Loonie ought to weigh.Then discovered those vacuum skulls had not put arm back on.For some silly reason they had taken it off when they stripped me to prepare me and I was loaded with enough don't worry and let's sleep pills not to protest.No huhu had they put it on again.But that drecklich switch was on my left and sleeve of p suit was empty.Spent next ten years getting unstrapped with one hand, then a twenty year sentence floating around in dark before managed to find my cradle again, figure out which was head end, and from that hint locate switch by touch.That compartment was not over two meters in any dimension.This turns out to be larger than Old Dome in free fall and total darkness.Found it.We had light.(And don't ask why that coffin did not have at least three lighting systems all working all time.Habit, probably.A lighting system implies a switch to control it, nyet?Thing was built in two days; should be thankful switch worked. )Once I had light, cubic shrank to true claustrophobic dimensions and ten percent smaller, and I took a look at Prof.Dead, apparently.Well, he had every excuse.Envied him but was now supposed to check his pulse and breathing and suchlike in case he had been unlucky and still had such troubles.And was again hampered and not just by being onearmed.Grain load had been dried and depressured as usual before loading but that cell was supposed to be pressured  oh, nothing fancy, just a tank with air in it.Our p suits were supposed to handle needs such as life's breath for those two days.But even best p suit is more comfortable in pressure than in vacuum and, anyhow, I was supposed to be able to get at my patient.Could not.Didn't need to open helmet to know this steel can had not stayed gas tight, knew at once, naturally, from way p suit felt.Oh, drugs I had for Prof, heart stimulants and so forth, were in field ampules; could jab them through his suit.But how to check heart and breathing?His suit was cheapest sort, sold for Loonie who rarely Leaves warren; had no readouts.His mouth hung open and eyes stared.A deader, I decided.No need to ex Prof beyond that old limen; had eliminated himself.Tried to see pulse on throat; his helmet was in way.They had provided a program clock which was mighty kind of them.Showed I had been out forty four plus hours, all to plan, and in three hours we should receive horrible booting to place us in parking orbit around Terra.Then, after two circums, call it three more hours, we should start injection into landing program  if Poona Ground Control didn't change its feeble mind and leave us in orbit.Reminded self that was unlikely; grain is not left in vacuum longer than necessary.Has tendency to become puffed wheat or popped corn, which not only lowers value but can split those thin canisters like a melon.Wouldn't that be sweet?Why had they packed us in with grain?Why not just a load of rock that doesn't mind vacuum?Had time to think about that and to become very thirsty.Took nipple for half a mouthful, no more, because certainly did not want to take six gees with a full bladder.(Need not have worried; was equipped with catheter.But did not know. )When time got short I decided couldn't hurt Prof to give him a jolt of drug that was supposed to take him through heavy acceleration; then, after in parking orbit, give him heart stimulant  since didn't seem as if anything could hurt him.Gave him first drug, then spent rest of minutes struggling back into straps, one handed.Was sorry I didn't know name of my helpful friend; could have cursed him better.Ten gees gets you into parking orbit around Terra in a mere 3.26 x 10^7 microseconds; merely seems longer, ten gravities being sixty times what a fragile sack of protoplasm should be asked to endure.Call it thirty three seconds.My truthful word, I suspect my ancestress in Salem spent a worse half minute day they made her dance.Gave Prof heart stimulant, then spent three hours trying to decide whether to drug self as well as Prof for landing sequence.Decided against.All drug had done for me at catapulting had been to swap a minute and a half of misery and two days of boredom for a century of terrible dreams  and besides, if those last minutes were going to be my very last, I decided to experience them.Bad as they would be, they were my very own and I would not give them up.They were bad.Six gees did not feel better than ten; felt worse.Four gees no relief.Then we were kicked harder.Then suddenly, just for seconds, in free fall again.Then came splash which was not "gentle" and which we took on straps, not pads, as we went in headfirst.Also, don't think Mike realized that, after diving in hard, we would then surface and splash hard again before we damped down into floating.Earthworms call it "floating" but is nothing like floating in free fall; you do it at one gee, six times what is decent, and odd side motions tacked on.Very odd motions   Mike had assured us that solar weather was good, no radiation danger inside that Iron Maiden.But he had not been so interested in Earthside Indian Ocean weather; prediction was acceptable for landing barges and suppose he felt that was good enough  and I would have thought so, too.Stomach was supposed to be empty.But I filled helmet with sourest, nastiest fluid you would ever go a long way to avoid.Then we turned completely over and I got it in hair and eyes and some in nose.This is thing earthworms call "seasickness" and is one of many horrors they take for granted.Won't go into long period during which we were towed into port.Let it stand that, in addition to seasickness, my air bottles were playing out.They were rated for twelve hours, plenty for a fifty hour orbit most of which I was unconscious and none involving heavy exercise, but not quite enough with some hours of towing added.By time barge finally held still I was almost too dopy to care about trying to break out.Except for one fact   We were picked up, I think, and tumbled a bit, then brought to rest with me upside down.This is a no good position at best under one gravity; simply impossible when supposed to a) unstrap self, b) get out of suit shaped cavity, c) get loose a sledgehammer fastened with butterfly nuts to bulkhead.
