          1                 Third          "I've watched through his eyes, I've listened through his ears, and tell you he's the one.Or at least as close as we're going to get. ""That's what you said about the brother. ""The brother tested out impossible.For other reasons.Nothing to do with his ability. ""Same with the sister.And there are doubts about him.He's too malleable.Too willing to submerge himself in someone else's will. ""Not if the other person is his enemy. ""So what do we do?Surround him with enemies all the time?""If we have to. ""I thought you said you liked this kid. ""If the buggers get him, they'll make me look like his favorite uncle. ""All right.We're saving the world, after all.Take him. "The monitor lady smiled very nicely and tousled his hair and said, "Andrew, I suppose by now you're just absolutely sick of having that horrid monitor.Well, I have good news for you.That monitor is going to come out today.We're going to just take it right out, and it won't hurt a bit. "Ender nodded.It was a lie, of course, that it wouldn't hurt a bit.But since adults always said it when it was going to hurt, he could count on that statement as an accurate prediction of the future.Sometimes lies were more dependable than the truth."So if you'll just come over here, Andrew, just sit right up here on the examining table.The doctor will be in to see you in a moment. "The monitor gone.Ender tried to imagine the little device missing from the back of his neck.I'll roll over on my back in bed and it won't be pressing there.I won't feel it tingling and taking up the heat when I shower.And Peter won't hate me anymore.I'll come home and show him that the monitor's gone, and he'll see that I didn't make it, either.That I'll just be a normal kid now, like him.That won't be so bad then.He'll forgive me that I had my monitor a whole year longer than he had his.We'll be   not friends, probably.No, Peter was too dangerous.Peter got so angry.Brothers, though.Not enemies, not friends, but brothers   able to live in the same house.He won't hate me, he'll just leave me alone.And when he wants to play buggers and astronauts, maybe I won't have to play, maybe I can just go read a book.But Ender knew, even as he thought it, that Peter wouldn't leave him alone.There was something in Peter's eyes, when he was in his mad mood, and whenever Ender saw that look, that glint, he knew that the one thing Peter would not do was leave him alone.I'm practicing piano, Ender.Come turn the pages for me.Oh, is the monitor boy too busy to help his brother?Is he too smart?Got to go kill some buggers, astronaut?No, no, I don't want your help.I can do it on my own, you little bastard, you little Third."This won't take long, Andrew," said the doctor.Ender nodded."It's designed to be removed.Without infection, without damage.But there'll be some tickling, and some people say they have a feeling of something missing.You'll keep looking around for something.Something you were looking for, but you can't find it, and you can't remember what it was.So I'll tell you.It's the monitor you're looking for, and it isn't there.In a few days that feeling will pass. "The doctor was twisting something at the back of Ender's head.Suddenly a pain stabbed through him like a needle from his neck to his groin.Ender felt his back spasm, and his body arched violently backward; hi head struck the bed.He could feel his legs thrashing, and his hands were clenching each other, wringing each other so tightly that they ached."Deedee!"shouted the doctor."I need you!"The nurse ran in, gasped."Got to relax these muscles.Get it to me, now!What are you waiting for!"Something changed hands; Ender could not see.He lurched to one side and fell off the examining table."Catch him!"cried the nurse."Just hold him steady. ""You hold him, doctor, he's too strong for me. ""Not the whole thing!You'll stop his heart. "Ender felt a needle enter his back just above the neck of his shirt.It burned, but wherever in him the fire spread, his muscles gradually unclenched.Now he could cry for the fear and pain of it."Are you all right, Andrew?"the nurse asked.Andrew could not remember how to speak.They lifted him onto the table.They checked his pulse, did other things; he did not understand it all.The doctor was trembling; his voice shook as he spoke."They leave these things in the kids for three years, what do they expect?We could have switched him off, do you realize that?We could have unplugged his brain for all time. ""When does the drug wear off'?"asked the nurse."Keep him here for at least an hour.Watch him.If he doesn't start talking in fifteen minutes, call me.Could have unplugged him forever.I don't have the brains of a bugger. "He got back to Miss Pumphrey's class only fifteen minutes before the closing bell.He was still a little unsteady on his feet."Are you all right, Andrew?"asked Miss Pumphrey.He nodded."Were you ill?"He shook his head."You don't look well. ""I'm OK. ""You'd better sit down, Andrew. "He started toward his seat, but stopped.Now what was I looking for?I can't think what I was looking for."Your seat is over there," said Miss Pumphrey.He sat down, but it was something else he needed, something he had lost.I'll find it later."Your monitor," whispered the girl behind him.Andrew shrugged."His monitor," she whispered to the others.Andrew reached up and felt his neck.There was a bandaid.It was gone.He was just like everybody else now."Washed out, Andy?"asked a boy who sat across the aisle and behind him.Couldn't think of his name.Peter.No, that was someone else."Quiet, Mr.Stilson," said Miss Pumphrey.Stilson smirked.Miss Pumphrey talked about multiplication.Ender doodled on his desk, drawing contour maps of mountainous islands and then telling his desk to display them in three dimensions from every angle.The teacher would know, of course, that he wasn't paying attention, but she wouldn't bother him.He always knew the answer, even when she thought he wasn't paying attention.In the corner of his desk a word appeared and began marching around the perimeter of the desk.It was upside down and backward at first, but Ender knew what it said long before it reached the bottom of the desk and turned right side up.THIRD   Ender smiled.He was the one who had figured out how to send messages and make them march   even as his secret enemy called him names, the method of delivery praised him.It was not his fault he was a Third.It was the government's idea, they were the ones who authorized it   how else could a Third like Ender have got into school?And now the monitor was gone.The experiment entitled Andrew Wiggin hadn't worked out after all.If they could, he was sure they would like to rescind the waivers that had allowed him to be born at all.Didn't work, so erase the experiment.The bell rang.Everyone signed off their desks or hurriedly typed in reminders to themselves.Some were dumping lessons or data into their computers at home.A few gathered at the printers while something they wanted to show was printed out.Ender spread his hands over the child size keyboard near the edge of the desk and wondered what it would feel like to have hands as large as a grown up's.They must feel so big and awkward, thick stubby fingers and beefy palms.Of course, they had bigger keyboards   but how could their thick fingers draw a fine line, the way Ender could, a thin line so precise that he could make it spiral seventy nine times from the center to the edge of the desk without the lines ever touching or overlapping.It gave him something to do while the teacher droned on about arithmetic.Arithmetic!Valentine had taught him arithmetic when he was three."Are you all right, Andrew?""Yes, ma'am. ""You'll miss the bus. "Ender nodded and got up.The other kids were gone.They would be waiting, though, the bad ones.His monitor wasn't perched on his neck, hearing what heard and seeing what he saw.They could say what they liked.They might even hit him now   no one could see anymore, and so no one would come to Ender's rescue.There were advantages to the monitor, and he would miss them.It was Stilson, of course.He wasn't bigger than most other kids, but he was bigger than Ender.And he had some others with him.He always did."Hey, Third. "Don't answer.Nothing to say."Hey, Third, we're talkin to you, Third, hey bugger lover, we're talkin to you. "Can't think of anything to answer.Anything I say will make it worse.So will saying nothing."Hey, Third, hey, turd, you flunked out, huh?Thought you were better than us, but you lost your little birdie, Thirdie, got a bandaid on your neck. ""Are you going to let me through?"Ender asked."Are we going to let him through?Should we let him through?"They all laughed."Sure we'll let you through.First we'll let your arm through, then your butt through, then maybe a piece of your knee. "The others chimed in now."Lost your birdie, Thirdie.Lost your birdie, Thirdie. "Stilson began pushing him with one hand, someone behind him then pushed him toward Stilson."See saw, marjorie daw," somebody said."Tennis!""Ping pong!"This would not have a happy ending.So Ender decided that he'd rather not be the unhappiest at the end.The next time Stilson's arm came out to push him, Ender grabbed at it.He missed."Oh, gonna fight me, huh?Gonna fight me, Thirdie?"The people behind Ender grabbed at him, to hold him.Ender did not feel like laughing, but he laughed."You mean it takes this many of you to fight one Third?""We're people, not Thirds, turd face.You're about as strong as a fart!"But they let go of him.And as soon as they did, Ender kicked out high and hard, catching Stilson square in the breastbone.He dropped.It took Ender by surprise he hadn't thought to put Stilson on the ground with one kick.It didn't occur to him that Stilson didn't take a fight like this seriously, that he wasn't prepared for a truly desperate blow.For a moment, the others backed away and Stilson lay motionless.They were all wondering if he was dead.Ender, however, was trying to figure out a way to forestall vengeance.To keep them from taking him in a pack tomorrow.I have to win this now, and for all time, or I'll fight it every day and it will get worse and worse.Ender knew the unspoken rules of manly warfare, even though he was only six.It was forbidden to strike the opponent who lay helpless on the ground; only an animal would do that.So Ender walked to Stilson's supine body and kicked him again, viciously, in the ribs.Stilson groaned and rolled away from him.Ender walked around him and kicked him again, in the crotch.Stilson could not make a sound; he only doubled up and tears streamed out of his eyes.Then Ender looked at the others coldly."You might be having some idea of ganging up on me.You could probably beat me up pretty bad.But just remember what I do to people who try to hurt me.From then on you'd be wondering when I'd get you, and how bad it would be. "He kicked Stilson in the face.Blood from his nose spattered the ground nearby."It wouldn't be this bad," Ender said."It would be worse. "He turned and walked away.Nobody followed him, He turned a corner into the corridor leading to the bus stop.He could hear the boys behind him saying, "Geez.Look at him.He's wasted. "Ender leaned his head against the wall of the corridor and cried until the bus came.I am just like Peter.Take my monitor away, and I am just like Peter.2          Peter    "All right, it's off.How's he doing?""You live inside somebody's body for a few years, you get used to it.I look at his face now, I can't tell what's going on.I'm not used to seeing his facial expressions.I'm used to feeling them. ""Come on, we're not talking about psychoanalysis here.We're soldiers, not witch doctors.You just saw him beat the guts out of the leader of a gang. ""He was thorough.He didn't just beat him, he beat him deep.Like Mazer Rackham at the  "  "Spare me.So in the judgment of the committee, he passes."Mostly.Let's see what he does with his brother, now that the monitor's off. ""His brother.Aren't you afraid of what his brother will do to him?""You were the one who told me that this wasn't a no risk business. ""I went back through some of the tapes.I can't help it.I like the kid.I think were going to screw him up. ""Of course we are.It's our job.We're the wicked witch.We promise gingerbread, but we eat the little bastards alive. ""I'm sorry, Ender," Valentine whispered.She was looking at the bandaid on his neck.Ender touched the wall and the door closed behind him."I don't care.I'm glad it's gone. ""What's gone?"Peter walked into the parlor, chewing on a mouthful of bread and peanut butter.Ender did not see Peter as the beautiful ten year old boy that grown ups saw, with dark, thick, tousled hair and a face that could have belonged to Alexander the Great.Ender looked at Peter only to detect anger or boredom, the dangerous moods that almost always led to pain.Now as Peter's eyes discovered the bandaid on his neck, the telltale flicker of anger appeared.Valentine saw it too."Now he's like us," she said, trying to soothe him before he had time to strike.But Peter would not be soothed."Like us?He keeps the little sucker till he's six years old.When did you lose yours?You were three.I lost mine before I was five.He almost made it, little bastard, little bugger. "This is all right, Ender thought.Talk and talk, Peter.Talk is fine."Well, now your guardian angels aren't watching over you," Peter said."Now they aren't checking to see if you feel pain, listening to hear what I'm saying, seeing what I'm doing to you.How about that?How about it?"Ender shrugged.Suddenly Peter smiled and clapped his hands together in a mockery of good cheer."Let's play buggers and astronauts," he said."Where's Mom?"asked Valentine."Out," said Peter."I'm in charge. ""I think I'll call Daddy. ""Call away," said Peter."You know he's never in. ""I'll play," Ender said."You be the bugger," said Peter."Let him be the astronaut for once," Valentine said."Keep your fat face out of it, fart mouth," said Peter."Come on upstairs and choose your weapons. "It would not be a good game, Ender knew it was not a question of winning.When kids played in the corridors, whole troops of them, the buggers never won, and sometimes the games got mean.But here in their flat, the game would start mean, and the bugger couldn't just go empty and quit the way buggers did in the real wars.The bugger was in it until the astronaut decided it was over.Peter opened his bottom drawer and took out the bugger mask.Mother had got upset at him when Peter bought it, but Dad pointed out that the war wouldn't go away just because you hid bugger masks and wouldn't let your kids play with make believe laser guns.The better to play the war games, and have a better chance of surviving when the buggers came again.If I survive the games, thought Ender.He put on the mask.It closed him in like a hand pressed tight against his face.But this isn't how it feels to he a bugger, thought Ender.They don't wear this face like a mask, it is their face.On their home worlds, do the buggers put on human masks, and play?And what do they call its?Slimies, because we're so soft and oily compared to them?"Watch out, Slimy," Ender said.He could barely see Peter through the eyeholes.Peter smiled at him."Slimy, huh?Well, bugger wugger, let's see how you break that face of yours. "Ender couldn't see it coming, except a slight shift of Peter's weight; the mask cut out his peripheral vision.Suddenly there was the pain and pressure of a blow to the side of his head; he lost balance, fell that way."Don't see too well, do you, bugger?"said Peter.Ender began to take off the mask.Peter put his toe against Ender's groin."Don't take off the mask," Peter said.Ender pulled the mask down into place, took his hands away.Peter pressed with his foot.Pain shot through Ender; he doubled up."Lie flat, bugger.We're gonna vivisect you, bugger.At long last we've got one of you alive, and we're going to see how you work. ""Peter, stop it," Ender said."Peter, stop it.Very good.So you buggers can guess our names.You can make yourselves sound like pathetic, cute little children so we'll love you and be nice to you.But it doesn't work.I can see you for what you really are.They meant you to be human, little Third, but you're really a bugger, and now it shows. "He lifted his foot, took a step, and then knelt on Ender, his knee pressing into Ender's belly just below the breastbone.He put more and more of his weight on Ender.It became hard to breathe."I could kill you like this," Peter whispered."Just press and press until you're dead.And I could say that I didn't know it would hurt you, that we were just playing, and they'd believe me, and everything would be fine.And you'd be dead.Everything would be fine. "Ender could not speak; the breath was being forced from his lungs.Peter might mean it.Probably didn't mean it, but then he might."I do mean it," Peter said."Whatever you think.I mean it.They only authorized you because I was so promising.But I didn't pan out.You did better.They think you're better.But I don't want a better little brother, Ender.I don't want a Third. ""I'll tell," Valentine said."No one would believe you. ""They'd believe me. ""Then you're dead, too, sweet little sister. ""Oh, yes," said Valentine."They'll believe that.'I didn't know it would kill Andrew.And when he was dead, I didn't know it would kill Valentine too. '"The pressure let up a little."So.Not today.But someday you two won't be together.And there'll be an accident. ""You're all talk," Valentine said."You don't mean any of it. ""I don't?""And do you know why you don't mean it?"Valentine asked."Because you want to be in government someday.You want to be elected.And they won't elect you if your opponents can dig up the fact that your brother and sister both died in suspicious accidents when they were little.Especially because of the letter I've put in my secret file, which will be opened in the event of my death. ""Don't give me that kind of crap," Peter said."It says, I didn't die a natural death.Peter killed me, and if he hasn't already killed Andrew, he will soon.Not enough to convict you, but enough to keep you from ever getting elected. ""You're his monitor now," said Peter."You better watch him, day and night.You better be there. ""Ender and I aren't stupid.We scored as well as you did on everything.Better on some things.We're all such wonderfully bright children.You're not the smartest, Peter, just the biggest. ""Oh, I know.But there'll come a day when you aren't there with him, when you forget.And suddenly you'll remember, and you'll rush to him, and there he'll be perfectly all right.And the next time you won't worry so much, and you won't come so fast.And every time, he'll be all right.And you'll think that I forgot.Even though you'll remember that I said this, you'll think that I forgot.And years will pass.And then there'll be a terrible accident, and I'll find his body, and I'll cry and cry over him, and you'll remember this conversation, Vally, but you'll be ashamed of yourself for remembering, because you'll know that I changed, that it really was an accident, that it's cruel of you even to remember what I said in a childhood quarrel.Except that it'll be true.I'm gonna save this up, and he's gonna die, and you won't do a thing, not a thing.But you go on believing that I'm just the biggest. ""The biggest asshole," Valentine said.Peter leaped to his feet and started for her.She shied away.Ender pried off his mask.Peter flopped back on his bed and started to laugh.Loud, but with real mirth, tears coming to his eyes."Oh, you guys are just super, just the biggest suckers on the planet earth. ""Now he's going to tell us it was all a joke," Valentine said."Not a joke, a game.I can make you guys believe anything.I can make you dance around like puppets. "In a phony monster voice he said, "I'm going to kill you and chop you into little pieces and put you into the garbage hole. "He laughed again."Biggest suckers in the solar system. "Ender stood there watching him laugh and thought of Stilson, thought of how it felt to crunch into his body.This is who needed it.This is who should have got it.As if she could read his mind, Valentine whispered, "No, Ender. "Peter suddenly rolled to the side, flipped off the bed, and got in position for a fight."Oh, yes, Ender," he said."Any time, Ender. "Ender lifted his right leg and took off the shoe.He held it up."See there, on the toe?That's blood, Peter. ""Ooh.Ooh, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die.Ender killed a capper tiller and now he's gonna kill me. "There was no getting to him.Peter was a murderer at heart, and nobody knew it but Valentine and Ender.Mother came home and commiserated with Ender about the monitor.Father came home and kept saying it was such a wonderful surprise, they had such fantastic children that the government told them to have three and now the government didn't want to take any of them after all, so here they were with three, they still had a Third...until Ender wanted to scream at him, I know I'm a Third, I know it, if you want I'll go away so you don't have to be embarrassed in front of everybody, I'm sorry I lost the monitor and now you have three kids and no obvious explanation, so inconvenient for you, I'm sorry sorry sorry.He lay in bed staring upward into the darkness...On the bunk above him, he could hear Peter turning and tossing restlessly.Then Peter slid off the bunk and walked out of the room.Ender heard the hushing sound of the toilet clearing; then Peter stood silhouetted in the doorway.He thinks I'm asleep.He's going to kill me.Peter walked to the bed, and sure enough, he did not lift himself up to his bed.Instead he came and stood by Ender's head.But he did not reach for a pillow to smother Ender.He did not have a weapon.He whispered, "Ender, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I know how it feels.I'm sorry, I'm your brother.I love you. "A long time later, Peter's even breathing said that he was asleep.Ender peeled the bandaid from his neck.And for the second time that day he cried.3   Graff    "The sister is our weak link.He really loves her. ""I know.She can undo it all, from the start.He won't want to leave her. ""So, what are you going to do?""Persuade him that he wants to come with us more than he wants to stay with her. ""How will you do that?""I'll lie to him. ""And if that doesn't work?""Then I'll tell the truth.We're allowed to do that in emergencies.We can't plan for everything, you know. "Ender wasn't very hungry during breakfast.He kept wondering what it would be like at school.Facing Stilson after yesterday's fight.What Stilson's friends would do.Probably nothing, but he couldn't be sure.He didn't want to go."You're not eating, Andrew," his mother said.Peter came into the room."Morning.Ender.Thanks for leaving your slimy washcloth in the middle of the shower. ""Just for you," Ender murmured."Andrew, you have to eat. "Ender held out his wrists, a gesture that said, So feed it to me through a needle."Very funny. "Mother said."I try to be concerned, but it makes no difference to my genius children. ""It was all your genes that made us, Mom. "said Peter."We sure didn't get any from Dad. ""I heard that," Father said, not looking up from the news that was being displayed on the table while he ate."It would've been wasted if you hadn't. "The table beeped.Someone was at the door."Who is it?"Mother asked.Father thumbed a key and a man appeared on the video.He was wearing the only military uniform that meant anything anymore, the I. F. , the International Fleet."I thought it was over," said Father.Peter said nothing, just poured milk over his cereal.And Ender thought, Maybe I won't have to go to school today after all.Father coded the door open and got up from the table."I'll see to it," he said."Stay and eat. "They stayed, but they didn't eat.A few moments later, Father came back into the room and beckoned to Mother."You're in deep poo," said Peter."They found out what you did to Stilson, and now they're gonna make you do time out in the Belt. ""I'm only six, moron.I'm a juvenile. ""You're a Third, turd.You've got no rights. "Valentine came in, her hair in a sleepy halo around her face."Where's Mom and Dad?I'm too sick to go to school. ""Another oral exam, huh?"Peter said."Shut up, Peter," said Valentine."You should relax and enjoy it," said Peter."It could be worse. ""I don't know how. ""It could be an anal exam. ""Hyuk hyuk," Valentine said."Where are Mother and Father?""Talking to a guy from I. F. "Instinctively she looked at Ender.After all, for years they had expected someone to come and tell them that Ender had passed, that Ender was needed."That's right, look at him," Peter said."But it might he me, you know.They might have realized I was the best of the lot after all. "Peter's feelings were hurt, and so he was being a snot, as usual.The door opened."Ender," said Father, "you better come in here. ""Sorry, Peter," Valentine taunted.Father glowered."Children, this is no laughing matter. "Ender followed Father into the parlor.The I. F.  officer rose to his feet when they entered, but he did not extend a hand to Ender.Mother was twisting her wedding band on her finger."Andrew," she said."I never thought you were the kind to get in a fight. ""The Stilson boy is in the hospital," Father said."You really did a number on him.With your shoe, Ender, that wasn't exactly fair. "Ender shook his head.He had expected someone from the school to come about Stilson, not an officer of the fleet.This was more serious than he had thought.And yet he couldn't think what else he could have done."Do you have any explanation for your behavior, young man?"asked the officer.Ender shook his head again.He didn't know what to say, and he was afraid to reveal himself to be any more monstrous than his actions had made him out to be.I'll take it, whatever the punishment is, he thought.Let's get it over with."We're willing to consider extenuating circumstances," the officer said."But I must tell you it doesn't look good.Kicking him in the groin, kicking him repeatedly in the face and body when he was down   sounds like you really enjoyed it. ""I didn't," Ender whispered."Then why did you do it?""He had his gang there," Ender said."So?This excuses anything?""No. ""Tell me why you kept on kicking him.You had already won. ""Knocking him down won the first fight.I wanted to win all the next ones, too, right then, so they'd leave me alone. "Ender couldn't help it, he was too afraid, too ashamed of his own acts: though he tried not to, he cried again.Ender did not like to cry and rarely did; now, in less than a day, he had done it three times.And each time was worse.To cry in front of his mother and father and this military man, that was shameful."You took away the monitor," Ender said."I had to take care of myself, didn't I?""Ender, you should have asked a grown up for help," Father began.But the officer stood up and stepped across the room to Ender.He held out his hand."My name is Graff.Ender.Colonel Hyrum Graff.I'm director of primary training at Battle School in the Belt.I've come to invite you to enter the school. "After all."But the monitor  "  "The final step in your testing was to see what would happen if the monitor comes off.We don't always do it that way, but in your case  "  "And I passed?"Mother was incredulous."Putting the Stilson boy in the hospital?What would you have done if Andrew had killed him, given him a medal?""It isn't what he did, Mrs.Wiggin.It's why. "Colonel Graff handed her a folder full of papers."Here are the requisitions.Your son has been cleared by the I. F.  Selective Service.Of course we already have your consent, granted in writing at the time conception was confirmed, or he could not have been born.He has been ours from then, if he qualified. "Father's voice was trembling as he spoke."It's not very kind of you, to let us think you didn't want him, and then to take him after all. ""And this charade about the Stilson boy," Mother said."It wasn't a charade, Mrs.Wiggin.Until we knew what Ender's motivation was, we couldn't be sure he wasn't another   we had to know what the action meant.Or at least what Ender believed that it meant. ""Must you call him that stupid nickname?"Mother began to cry."I'm sorry, Mrs.Wiggin.But that's the name he calls himself. ""What are you going to do, Colonel Graff?"Father asked."Walk out the door with him now?""That depends," said Graff."On what?""On whether Ender wants to come. "Mother's weeping turned to bitter laughter."Oh, so it's voluntary after all, how sweet!""For the two of you, the choice was made when Ender was conceived.But for Ender, the choice has not been made at all.Conscripts make good cannon fodder, but for officers we need volunteers. ""Officers?"Ender asked.At the sound of his voice, the others fell silent."Yes," said Graff."Battle School is for training future starship captains and commodores of flotillas and admirals of the fleet. ""Let's not have any deception here!"Father said angrily."How many of the boys at the Battle School actually end up in command of ships!""Unfortunately, Mr.Wiggin, that is classified information.But I can say that none of our boys who makes it through the first year has ever failed to receive a commission as an officer.And none has served in a position of lower rank than chief executive officer of an interplanetary vessel.Even in the domestic defense forces within our own solar system, there's honor to be had. ""How many make it through the first year?"asked Ender."All who want to," said Graff.Ender almost said, I want to.But he held his tongue.This would keep him out of school, but that was stupid, that was just a problem for a few days.It would keep him away from Peter   that was more important, that might be a matter of life itself.But to leave Mother and Father, and above all, to leave Valentine.And become a soldier.Ender didn't like fighting.He didn't like Peter's kind, the strong against the weak, and he didn't like his own kind either, the smart against the stupid."I think," Graff said, "that Ender and I should have a private conversation. ""No," Father said."I won't take him without letting you speak to him again," Graff said."And you really can't stop me. "Father glared at Graff a moment longer, then got up and left the room.Mother paused to squeeze Ender's hand.She closed the door behind her when she left."Ender," Graff said, "if you come with me, you won't be back here for a long time.There aren't any vacations from Battle School.No visitors, either.A full course of training lasts until you're sixteen years old   you get your first leave, under certain circumstances, when you're twelve.Believe me, Ender, people change in six years, in ten years.Your sister Valentine will be a woman when you see her again, if you come with me.You'll be strangers.You'll still love her, Ender, but you won't know her.You see I'm not pretending it's easy. ""Mom and Daddy?""I know you, Ender.I've been watching the monitor disks for some time.You won't miss your mother and father, not much, not for long.And they won't miss you long, either. "Tears came to Ender's eyes, in spite of himself.He turned his face away, but would not reach up to wipe them."They do love you, Ender.But you have to understand what your life has cost them.They were born religious, you know.Your father was baptized with the name John Paul Wieczorek.Catholic.The seventh of nine children. "Nine children.That was unthinkable.Criminal."Yes, well, people do strange things for religion.You know the sanctions, Ender   they were not as harsh then, but still not easy.Only the first two children had a free education.Taxes steadily rose with each new child.Your father turned sixteen and invoked the Noncomplying Families Act to separate himself from his family.He changed his name, renounced his religion, and vowed never to have more than the allotted two children.He meant it.All the shame and persecution he went through as a child   he vowed no child of his would go through it.Do you understand?""He didn't want me. ""Well, no one wants a Third anymore.You can't expect them to be glad.But your father and mother are a special case.They both renounced their religions   your mother was a Mormon   but in fact their feelings are still ambiguous.Do you know what ambiguous means?""They feel both ways. ""They're ashamed of having come from noncompliant families.They conceal it.To the degree that your mother refuses to admit to anyone that she was born in Utah, lest they suspect.Your father denies his Polish ancestry, since Poland is still a noncompliant nation, and under international sanction because of it.So, you see, having a Third, even under the government's direct instructions, undoes everything they've been trying to do. ""I know that. ""But it's more complicated than that.Your father still named you with legitimate saints' names.In fact, he baptized all three of you himself as soon as he got you home after you were born.And your mother objected.They quarreled over it each time, not because she didn't want you baptized, but because she didn't want you baptized Catholic.They haven't really given up their religion.They look at you and see you as a badge of pride, because they were able to circumvent the law and have a Third.But you're also a badge of cowardice, because they dare not go further and practice the noncompliance they still feel is right.And you're a badge of public shame, because at every step you interfere with their efforts at assimilation into normal complying society. ""How can you know all this?""We monitored your brother and sister, Ender.You'd be amazed at how sensitive the instruments are.We were connected directly to your brain.We heard all that you heard, whether you were listening carefully or not.Whether you understood or not.We understand. ""So my parents love me and don't love me?""They love you.The question is whether they want you here.Your presence in this house is a constant disruption.A source of tension.Do you understand?""I'm not the one who causes tension. ""Not anything you do, Ender.Your life itself.Your brother hates you because you are living proof that he wasn't good enough.Your parents resent you because of all the past they are trying to evade. ""Valentine loves me. ""With all her heart.Completely, unstintingly, she's devoted to you, and you adore her.I told you it wouldn't be easy. ""What is it like, there?""Hard work.Studies, just like school here, except we put you into mathematics and computers much more heavily.Military history.Strategy and tactics.And above all, the Battle Room. ""What's that?""War games.All the boys are organized into armies.Day after day, in zero gravity, there are mock battles.Nobody gets hurt, but winning and losing matter.Everybody starts as a common soldier, taking orders.Older boys are your officers, and it's their duty to train you and command you in battle.More than that I can't tell you.It's like playing buggers and astronauts   except that you have weapons that work, and fellow soldiers fighting beside you, and your whole future and the future of the human race depends on how well you learn, how well you fight.It's a hard life, and you won't have a normal childhood.Of course, with your mind, and as a Third to boot, you wouldn't have a particularly normal childhood anyway. ""All boys?""A few girls.They don't often pass the tests to get in.Too many centuries of evolution are working against them.None of them will be like Valentine, anyway.But there'll be brothers there, Ender. ""Like Peter?""Peter wasn't accepted, Ender, for the very reasons that you hate him. ""I don't hate him.I'm just  "  "Afraid of him.Well, Peter isn't all bad, you know.He was the best we'd seen in a long time.We asked your parents to choose a daughter next   they would have anyway   hoping that Valentine would be Peter, but milder.She was too mild.And so we requisitioned you. ""To be half Peter and half Valentine. ""If things worked out right. ""Am I?""As far as we can tell.Our tests are very good, Ender.But they don't tell us everything.In fact, when it comes down to it, they hardly tell us anything.But they're better than nothing. "Graff leaned over and took Ender's hands in his."Ender Wiggin, if it were just a matter of choosing the best and happiest future for you, I'd tell you to stay home.Stay here, grow up, be happy.There are worse things than being a Third, worse things than a big brother who can't make up his mind whether to be a human being or a jackal.Battle School is one of those worse things.But we need you.The buggers may seem like a game to you now, Ender, but they damn near wiped us out last time.But it wasn't enough.They had us cold, outnumbered and outweaponed.The only thing that saved us was that we had the most brilliant military commander we've ever found.Call it fate, call it God, call it damnfool luck, we had Mazer Rackham. ""But we don't have him now, Ender.We've scraped together everything mankind could produce, a fleet that makes the one they sent against us last time seem like a bunch of kids playing in a swimming pool.We have some new weapons, too.But it might not be enough, even so.Because in the eighty years since the last war, they've had as much time to prepare as we have.We need the best we can get, and we need them fast.Maybe you're not going to work out for us, and maybe you are.Maybe you'll break down under the pressure, maybe it'll ruin your life, maybe you'll hate me for coming here to your house today.But if there's a chance that because you're with the fleet, mankind might survive and the buggers might leave us alone forever then I'm going to ask you to do it.To come with me. "Ender had trouble focusing on Colonel Graff.The man looked far away and very small, as if Ender could pick him up with tweezers and drop him in a pocket.To leave everything here, and go to a place that was very hard, with no Valentine, no Mom and Dad.And then he thought of the films of the buggers that everyone had to see at least once a year.The Scathing of China.The Battle of the Belt.Death and suffering and terror.And Mazer Rackham and his brilliant maneuvers, destroying an enemy fleet twice his size and twice his firepower, using the little human ships that seemed so frail and weak.Like children fighting with grown ups.And we won."I'm afraid," said Ender quietly."But I'll go with you. ""Tell me again," said Graff."It's what I was born for, isn't it?If I don't go, why am I alive?""Not good enough," said Graff."I don't want to go," said Ender, "but I will. "Graff nodded."You can change your mind.Up until the time you get in my car with me, you can change your mind.After that, you stay at the pleasure of the International Fleet.Do you understand that?"Ender nodded."All right.Let's tell them. "Mother cried.Father held Ender tight.Peter shook his hand and said, "You lucky little pinheaded fart eater. "Valentine kissed him and left her tears on his cheek.There was nothing to pack.No belongings to take."The school provides everything you need, from uniforms to school supplies.And as for toys   there's only one game. ""Good bye," Ender said to his family.He reached up and took Colonel Graff's hand and walked out the door with him."Kill some buggers for me!"Peter shouted."I love you, Andrew!"Mother called."We'll write to you!"Father said.And as he got into the car that waited silently in the corridor, he heard Valentine's anguished cry."Come back to me!I love you forever!"4   Launch    "With Ender, we have to strike a delicate balance.Isolate him enough that he remains creative   otherwise he'll adopt the system here and we'll lose him.At the same time, we need to make sure he keeps a strong ability to lead. ""If he earns rank, he'll lead. ""lt isn't that simple.Mazer Rackham could handle his little fleet and win.By the time this war happens, there'll be too much, even for a genius.Too many little coats.He has to work smoothly with his subordinates. ""Oh.good.He has to be a genius and nice.too. ""Not nice.Nice will let the buggers have us all,"  "So you're going to isolate him. ""I'll have him completely separated from the rest of the boys by the time we get to the School. ""I have no doubt of it.I'll be waiting for you to get here.I watched the vids of what he did to the Stilson boy.This is not a sweet little kid you're bringing up here. ""That's where you're mistaken.He's even sweeter.But don't worry.We'll purge that in a hurry. ""Sometimes I think you enjoy breaking these little geniuses. ""There is an art to it, and I'm very, very good at it.But enjoy?Well, maybe.When they put back the pieces afterward, and it makes them better. ""You're a monster. ""Thanks.Does this mean I get a raise?""Just a medal.The budget isn't inexhaustible. "They say that weightlessness can cause disorientation, especially in children, whose sense of direction isn't yet secure.But Ender was disoriented before he left Earth's gravity.Before the shuttle launch even began.There were nineteen other boys in his launch.They filed out of the bus and into the elevator.They talked and joked and bragged and laughed.Ender kept his silence.He noticed how Graff and the other officers were watching them.Analyzing.Everything we do means something, Ender realized.Them laughing.Me not laughing.He toyed with the idea of trying to be like the other boys.But he couldn't think of any jokes, and none of theirs seemed funny.Wherever their laughter came from, Ender couldn't find such a place in himself.He was afraid, and fear made him serious.They had dressed him in a uniform, all in a single piece; it felt funny not to have a belt cinched around his waist.He felt baggy and naked, dressed like that.There were TV cameras going, perched like animals on the shoulders of crouching, prowling men.The men moved slowly, catlike, so the camera motion would be smooth.Ender caught himself moving smoothly, too.He imagined himself being on TV, in an interview.The announcer asking him, How do you feel, Mr.Wiggin?Actually quite well, except hungry.Hungry?Oh, yes, they don't let you eat for twenty hours before the launch.How interesting, I never knew that.All of us are quite hungry, actually.And all the while, during the interview, Ender and the TV guy would slink along smoothly in front of the cameraman, taking long, lithe strides.For the first time, Ender felt like laughing.He smiled.The other boys near him were laughing at the moment, too, for another reason.They think I'm smiling at their joke, thought Ender.But I'm smiling at something much funnier."Go up the ladder one at a time," said an officer."When you come to an aisle with empty seats, take one.There aren't any window seats. "It was a joke.The other boys laughed.Ender was near the last, but not the very last.The TV cameras did not give up, though.Will Valentine see me disappear into the shuttle?He thought of waving at her, of running to the cameraman and saying, "Can I tell Valentine good bye?"He didn't know that it would be censored out of the tape if he did, for the boys soaring out to Battle School were all supposed to be heroes.They weren't supposed to miss anybody.Ender didn't know about the censorship, but he did know that running to the cameras would be wrong.He walked the short bridge to the door in the shuttle.He noticed that the wall to his right was carpeted like a floor.That was where the disorientation began.The moment he thought of the wall as a floor, he began to feel like he was walking on a wall.He got to the ladder, and noticed that the vertical surface behind it was also carpeted.I am climbing up the floor.Hand over hand, step by step.And then, for fun, he pretended that he was climbing down the wall.He did it almost instantly in his mind, convinced himself against the best evidence of gravity.He found himself gripping the seat tightly, even though gravity pulled him firmly against it.The other boys were bouncing on their seats a little, poking and pushing, shouting.Ender carefully found the straps, figured out how they fit together to hold him at crotch, waist, and shoulders.He imagined the ship dangling upside down on the undersurface of the Earth, the giant fingers of gravity holding them firmly in place.But we will slip away, he thought.We are going to fall off this planet.He did not know its significance at the time.Later, though, he would remember that it was even before he left Earth that he first thought of it as a planet, like any other, not particularly his own."Oh, already figured it out," said Graff.He was standing on the ladder."Coming with us?"Ender asked."I don't usually come down for recruiting," Graff said."I'm kind of in charge there.
