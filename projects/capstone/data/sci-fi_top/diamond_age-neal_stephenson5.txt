"Why are you putting that stick in the fire?""It is my duty to see that the evil Baron never troubles you again," Miranda said, reading from the prompter."But what are you going to do with that stick?"Please don't do this.It's not the time to ask why."You must make haste!"Miranda read, trying once again to sell the line as best she could.But Princess Nell had been playing with the Primer for a couple of years now and had gotten in the habit of asking endless questions."Why are you making the stick sharper?""This is how Odysseus and I took care of the Cyclops," Dinosaur said.Shit.It's going all wrong."What's Cyclops?"Nell said.A new illustration grew on the next page, facing the illustration of Dinosaur by the fire.It was a picture of a one eyed giant herding some sheep.Dinosaur told the story of how Odysseus killed the Cyclops with a pointed stick, just as he was about to do to Baron Burt.Nell insisted on hearing what happened after that.One story led to another.Miranda tried to tell the stories as fast as she could, tried to put a tone of boredom and impatience into her voice, which wasn't easy because she was actually on the verge of panic.She had to get Nell out of that apartment before Burt woke up from his drunk.The eastern sky was beginning to glow ...Shit.Get out of there, Nell!...Dinosaur was just in the middle of telling Princess Nell about a witch who turned men into swine when suddenly, poof, he turned back into a stuffed animal.The sun had come up.Nell was a bit startled by this turn of events, and closed the Primer for a while, and sat in the dark listening to Harv wheeze and Burt snore in the next room.She'd been looking forward to the moment when Dinosaur would kill Baron Burt, just as Odysseus had done to the Cyclops.But now it wasn't going to happen.Baron Burt would wake up, realize he'd been tricked, and hurt them worse.They'd be stuck in the Dark Castle forever.Nell was tired of being in the Dark Castle.She knew it was time to get out.She opened the Primer."Princess Nell knew what she had to do," Nell said.Then she closed the Primer and left it on her pillow.Even if she hadn't learned how to read pretty well, she would have had no trouble finding what she wanted just by using the M. C.'s mediaglyphics.It was a thing she'd seen people use in the old passives, a thing she'd seen when Mom's old boyfriend Brad had taken her to visit the horse barn in Dovetail.It was called a screwdriver, and you could have the M. C.  make them in all different shapes: long, short, fat, skinny.She had it make one that was very long and very skinny.When it was finished, it made the hissing sound that it always made, and she thought she heard Burt stirring on the sofa.She peeked into the living room.He was still lying there, his eyes closed, but his arms were moving around.His head turned from side to side once, and she could see a glimmer between his half opened eyelids.He was about to wake up and hurt her some more.She held the screwdriver out in front of her like a lance and ran straight toward him.At the last instant she faltered.The tool went astray and skidded across his forehead, leaving a trail of red stitches.Nell was so horrified that she dropped it and jumped back Burt was shaking his head violently back and forth.He opened his eyes and looked right at Nell.Then he put his hand to his forehead and brought it back all bloody.He sat up on the sofa, still uncomprehending.The screwdriver rolled off and bounced on the floor.He picked it up and found the tip bloody, then fixed his eyes on Nell, who had shrunk into the corner of the room.Nell knew that she had done the wrong thing.Dinosaur had told her to run away, and she had pestered him with questions instead."Harv!"she said.But her voice came out all dry and squeaky, like a mouse's."We must fly!""Yeah, you're gonna fly all right," Burt said swinging his feet around to the floor."Right out the fucking window you're gonna fly. "Harv came out.He was carrying his nunchuks under his injured arm and the Primer in his good hand.The book hung open to an illustration of Princess Nell and Harv running away from the Dark Castle with Baron Burt in pursuit."Nell, your book talked to me," he said."It said we should run away. "Then he saw Burt rising from the sofa with the bloody screwdriver in his hand.Harv didn't bother with the nunchuks.He bolted across the room and dropped the Primer, freeing his good hand to fling the front door open.Nell, who had been frozen in a nearby corner for some time, shot toward the door like a bolt finally loosed from a crossbow, snatching up the Primer as she ran past it.They ran into the hallway with Burt only a few paces behind.The lobby with the elevators was some distance away from them.On impulse, Nell stopped and dropped to a crouch in Burt's path.Harv turned toward her, terrified."Nell!"he cried.Burt's pumping legs struck Nell in the side.He spun forward and landed hard on the hallway floor, skidding for a short distance.This brought him to the feet of Harv, who had turned to face him and deployed his nunchuks.Harv went upside Burt's head a few times, but he was panicked and didn't do a very good job of it.Burt groped with one hand and managed to catch the chain that joined the halves of the weapon.Nell had gotten to her feet by this point and ran up Burt's back; she lunged forward and sank her teeth into the fleshy base of Burt's thumb.Something fast and confusing happened, Nell was rolling on the floor, Harv was dragging her back to her feet, she reached back to snatch up the Primer, which she had dropped again.They made it into the emergency stairs and began to skitter down the tunnel of urine, graffiti, and refuse, jumping over the odd slumbering body.Burt entered the stairwell in pursuit, a couple of flights behind them.He tried to make a shortcut by vaulting over the banister as he had seen and done in ractives, but his drunk body didn't do it as well as a media hero, and he tumbled down one flight, cursing and screaming, now rabid with pain and anger.Nell and Harv kept running.Burt's pratfall gave them enough of a lead to make it to the ground floor.They ran straight across the lobby and into the street.It was the wee hours of the morning, and there was almost no one out here, which was slightly unusual; normally there would have been decoys and lookouts for drug sellers.But tonight there was only one person on the whole block: a bulky Chinese man with a short beard and close cropped hair, wearing traditional indigo pajamas and a black leather skullcap, standing in the middle of the street with his hands stuck in his sleeves.He gave Nell and Harv an appraising look as they ran past.Nell did not pay him much attention.She just ran as fast as she could."Nell!"Harv was saying."Nell!Look!"She was afraid to look.She kept running."Nell, stop and look. "Harv cried.He sounded exultant.Finally Nell ran around the corner of a building, stopped, turned, and peeked back cautiously.She was looking down the empty street past the building where she had lived her whole life.At the end of the street was a big mediatronic advertising display currently running a big Coca Cola ad, in the ancient and traditional red used by that company.Silhouetted against it were two men: Burt and the big round headed Chinese man.They were dancing together.No, the Chinese man was dancing.Burt was just staggering around like a drunk.No, the Chinese man was not dancing, but doing some of the exercises that Dojo had taught Nell about.He moved slowly and beautifully except for some moments when every muscle in his body would join into one explosive movement.Usually these explosions were directed toward Burt.Burt fell down, then struggled up to his knees.The Chinese man gathered himself together into a black seed, rose into the air, spun around, and unfolded like a blooming flower.One of his feet struck Burt on the point of his chin and seemed to accelerate all the way through Burt's head.Burt's body fell back to the pavement like a few gallons of water sloshed out of a bucket.The Chinese man became very still, settled his breathing, adjusted his skullcap and the sash on his robe.Then he turned his back to Nell and Harv and walked away down the middle of the street.Nell opened her Primer.It was showing a picture of Dinosaur, seen in silhouette through a window in the Dark Castle, standing over the corpse of Baron Burt with a smoking stake in his claws.Nell said, "The little boy and the little girl were running away to the Land Beyond. "Hackworth departs from Shanghai;  his speculations as to the possible motives of Dr.X.   Would be passengers skidded to a halt on the saliva slickened floor of the Shanghai Aerodrome as the announcer brayed the names of great and ancient Chinese cities into his microphone.They set bags down, shushed children, furrowed brows, cupped hands around ears, and pursed lips in utter bewilderment.None of this was made any easier by the extended family of some two dozen just arrived Boers, women in bonnets and boys in heavy coarse farmer's pants, who had convened by one of the gates and begun to sing a hymn of thanksgiving in thick hoarse voices.When the announcer called out Hackworth's flight (San Diego with stops in Seoul, Vladivostok, Magadan, Anchorage, Juneau, Prince Rupert, Vancouver, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Santa Barbara, and Los Angeles), he apparently decided that it was beneath his dignity, above his abilities, or both to speak Korean, Russian, English, French, Coast Salish, and Spanish in the same sentence, and so he just hummed into the microphone for a while as if, far from being a professional announcer, he were a shy, indifferent vocalist hidden within in a vast choir.Hackworth knew perfectly well that hours would pass before he actually found himself on an airship, and that having achieved that milestone, he might have to wait hours more for its actual departure.Nonetheless, he had to say good bye to his family at some point, and this seemed no worse a time than any other.Holding Fiona (so big and solid now!)in the crook of one arm, and holding hands with Gwen, he pushed insistently across a rip tide of travelers, beggars, pickpockets, and entrepreneurs trading in everything from bolts of real silk to stolen intellectual property.Finally they reached a corner where a languid eddy had separated itself from the flow of people, and where Fiona could safely be set down.He turned first to Gwen.She still looked as stunned and vacant as she had, more or less consistently, since he told her that he had received a new assignment "whose nature I am not at liberty to disclose, save to say that it concerns the future, not merely of my department, nor of John Zaibatsu, but of that phyle into which you had the good fortune to have been born and to which I have sworn undying loyalty," and that he was making a trip "of indefinite duration" to North America.It had been increasingly clear of late that Gwen simply didn't get it.At first, Hackworth had been annoyed by this, viewing it as a symptom of hitherto unevidenced intellectual shortcomings.More recently, he had come to understand that it had more to do with emotional stance.Hackworth was embarking on a quest of sorts here, real Boy's Own Paper stuff, highly romantic.Gwen hadn't been raised on the proper diet of specious adventure yarns and simply found the whole concept unfathomable.She did a bit of rote sniffling and tear wiping, gave him a quick kiss and a hug, and stepped back, having completed her role in the ceremony with nothing close to enough histrionics.Hackworth, feeling somewhat disgruntled, squatted down to face Fiona.His daughter seemed to have a better intuitive grasp of the situation; she had been up several times a night recently, complaining of bad dreams, and on the way to the Aerodrome she had been perfectly quiet.She stared at her father with large red eyes.Tears came to Hackworth's eyes, and his nose began to run.He blew his nose plangently, held the handkerchief over his face for a moment, and composed himself.Then he reached into the breast pocket of his overcoat and drew out a flat package, wrapped up in mediatronic paper of spring wildflowers bending in a gentle breeze.Fiona brightened up immediately, and Hackworth could not help chudding, not for the first time, at the charming susceptibility of small people to frank bribery."You will forgive me for ruining the surprise," he said, "by telling you that this is a book, my darling.A magic book.I made it for you, because I love you and could not think of a better way to express that love.And whenever you open its pages, no matter how far away I might be, you will find me here. ""Thank you ever so much, Father," she said, taking it with both hands, and he could not help himself from sweeping her up in both arms and giving her a great hug and a kiss."Good bye, my best beloved, you will see me in your dreams," he whispered into her tiny, flawless ear, and then he set her free, spun around, and walked away before she could see the tears that had begun to run down his face.Hackworth was a free man now, wandering through the Aerodrome in an emotional stupor, and only reached his flight by participating in the same flock instinct that all the natives used to reach theirs.'Whenever he saw more than one gwailo heading purposefully in one direction, he followed them, and then others started following him, and thus did a mob of foreign devils coalesce among a hundred times as many natives, and finally, two hours after their ffight was supposed to leave, they mobbed a gate and climbed aboard the airship Hanjin Takhomawhich might or might not have been their assigned vessel, but the passengers now had a sufficient numerical majority to hijack it to America, which was the only thing that really counted in China.He had received a summons from the Celestial Kingdom.Now he was on his way to the territory still known vaguely as America.His eyes were red from crying over Gwen and Fiona, and his blood was swarming with nanosites whose functions were known only to Dr.X; Hackworth had lain back, closed his eyes, rolled up his sleeve, and hummed "Rule, Atlantis" while Dr.X's physicians (at least he hoped they were physicians) shoved a fat needle into his arm.The needle was fed by a tube that ran directly into a special fitting on the matter compiler; Hackworth was plugged directly into the Feed, not the regulation Atlantan kind but Dr.X's black market kludge.He could only hope that they'd given it the right instructions, as it would be a shame to have a washing machine, a mediatronic chopstick, or a kilo of China 'White materialize in his arm.Since then, he'd had a few attacks of the shivers, suggesting that his immune system was reacting to something Dr.X had put in there.His body would either get used to it or (preferably) destroy the offending nanosites.The airship was a dromond, the largest class of noncargo vessel.It was divided into four classes.Hackworth was second from the bottom, in third.Below that was steerage, which was for migrating thetes, and for sky girls, prostitutes of the air.Even now, these were bribing their way past the conductors and into the third class lounge, making eyes at Hackworth and at the white shirted sararimen who tended to travel this way.Those gentlemen had grown up in one crowded Dragon or another, where they knew how to generate a sort of artificial privacy field by determinedly ignoring each other.Hackworth had arrived at the point where he frankly didn't care, and so he stared directly at these men, front line soldiers of their various microstates, as each one primly folded his navy blue suit jacket and elbow crawled into a coffinlike microcabin like a GI squirming under a roll of concertina wire, accompanied or not by a camp follower.Hackworth pointlessly wondered whether he was the only one of this ship's some two thousand passengers who believed that prostitution (or anything) was immoral.He did not consider this question in a selfrighteous way, more out of rueful curiosity; some of the sky girls were quite fetching.But as he dragged his body into his microberth, he suffered another attack of the shivers, reminding him that even if his soul had been willing, his flesh was simply too weak.Another possible explanation for the chills was that Dr.X's nanosites were seeking out and destroying the ones that H. M.  Joint Forces had put in there, waging a turf war inside his body, and his immune system was doing overtime trying to pick up the carnage.Hackworth unexpectedly fell asleep before the dromond had even pulled away from her mooring mast, and had dreams about the murderous implements he had seen magnified on Dr.X's mediatron during his first visit.In the abstract they were frightening enough.Having a few million of them in his veins didn't do much for his peace of mind.In the end it wasn't as bad as knowing your blood was full of spirochetes, which people used to live with for decades.Amazing what a person could get used to.When he settled into bed, he heard a small chime, like faery bells.It was coming from the little pen dangling from his watch chain, and it meant that he had mail.Perhaps a thank you note from Fiona.He couldn't sleep anyway, and so he took out a sheet of mediatronic paper and spoke the commands that transferred the mail from the pen charm onto the page.He was disappointed to note that it was printed, not handwritten; some kind of official correspondence, and not, unfortunately, a note from Fiona.When he began to read it, he understood that it wasn't even official.It wasn't even from a human.It was a notification sent back to him automatically by a piece of machinery he had set into motion two years ago.The central message was wreathed in pages of technical gibberish, maps, graphs, and diagrams.The message was:   THE YOUNG LADY'S ILLUSTRATED PRIMER HAS BEEN FOUND.It was accompanied by an animated, three dimensional map of New Chusan with a red line drawn across it, starting in front of a rather seedy looking high rise apartment building in the Leased Territory called Enchantment and making its way erratically around the island from there.Hackworth laughed until his neighbors pounded on the adjoining walls and asked him to shut up.Nell and Harv at large in the Leased Territories;  encounter with an inhospitable security pod: a revelation about the Primer.The Leased Territories were too valuable to leave much room for Nature, but the geotects of Imperial Tectonics Limited had heard that trees were useful for cleaning and cooling the air, and so they had built in green belts along the borders between sectors.In the first hour that they lived free in the streets, Nell glimpsed one of those green belts, though it looked black at the time.She broke away from Harv and ran toward it down a street that had developed into a luminescent tunnel of mediatronic billboards.Harv chased her, just barely matching her speed because he had gotten a worse spanking than she had.They were almost the only people on the street, certainly the only ones moving purposefully, and so, as they ran, the messages on the billboards pursued them like starving wolves, making sure they understood that if they used cerrain ractives or took certain drugs, they could rely on being able to have sex with certain unrealistically perfect young persons.Some of the billboards made an even more elemental pitch, selling the sex directly.The mediatrons on this street were exceptionally large because they were made to be seen clearly from the heaths, bluffs, terraces, and courts of the New Atlantis Clave, miles up the mountain.Unremitting exposure to this kind of thing produced mediatron burnout among the target audience.Instead of turning them off and giving people a break for once, the proprietors had joined in an arms race of sorts, trying to find the magic image that would make people ignore all the other adverts and fix raptly on theirs.The obvious step of making their mediatrons bigger than the others had been taken about as far as it could go.Quite some time ago the content issue had been settled: tits, tires, and explosions were the only things that seemed to draw the notice of their supremely jaded focus groups, though from time to time they would play the juxtaposition card and throw in something incongruous, like a nature scene or a man in a black turtleneck reading poetry.Once all the mediatrons were a hundred feet high and filled with tits, the only competitive strategy that hadn't already been pushed to the redline was technical tricks: painfully bright flashes, jump cuts, and simulated 3 D phantoms that made bluff charges toward specific viewers who didn't seem to be paying enough attention.It was down a mile long gallery of these stimuli that Nell made her unexpected breakaway, looking from Harv's increasingly distant point of view like an ant scuttling across a television screen with the intensity and saturation turned all the way up, violently changing course from time to time as she was menaced by a virtual pitch daemon lunging at her from the false parallax of a moving z buffer, flaring like a comet against a bogus firmament of video black She knew that they were fake and in most cases didn't even recognize the products they were pitching, but her life had taught her everything about dodging.She couldn't not dodge.They hadn't figured out a way to make the adverts come at you headon, and so she maintained a roughly consistent direction down the middle of the street until she vaulted an energy absorbing barrier at its end and vanished into the forest.Harv followed her a few seconds later, though his arm didn't support vaulting and so he ended up hurtling ignominiously over the top, like a hyped autoskater who hadn't seen the barrier at all, just body kissed it full tilt."Nell!"he was already hollering, as he came to rest in a nest of colorful discarded packaging materials."You can't stay in here!You can't stay in the trees, Nell!"Nell had already worked her way deep into the woods, or as deep as you could get in a narrow green belt made to separate one Leased Territory from another.She fell down a couple of times and banged her head on a tree until, with childish adaptivity, she realized that she was on one of those surfaces that wasn't flat like a floor, street, or sidewalk.The ankles would actually have to show some versatility here.It was like one of those places she had read about in the Illustrated Primer, a magical zone where the fractal dimension of the terrain had been allowed to struggle off the pin, bumps supporting smaller copies of themselves, repeat until microscopic, throw dirt over it, and plant some of those creepy new Douglas firs that grow as fast as bamboo.Nell soon encountered a big Doug that had blown down in a recent typhoon, popping its own rootball out of the ground and thereby excavating a handy depression that invited nestling.Nell jumped in.For a few minutes she found it strangely hilarious that Harv could not find her.Their flat had only two hiding places, both closets, and so their traditional exploits in the hide and go seek field had provided them with minimal entertainment value and left them wondering what the big deal was anyway about that stupid game.But now, here in the dark woods, Nell was beginning to get it."Do you give up?"she finally said, and then Harv found her.He stood at the edge of the rootball pit and demanded that she come out.She refused.Finally he clambered down, though to an eye more critical than Nell's it might have looked as if he were falling.Nell jumped into his lap before he could get up."We gotta go," he said."I want to stay here.It's nice," Nell said."You ain't the only one who thinks so," Harv said."That's why they got pods here. ""Pods?""Aerostats.For security. "Nell was delighted to hear it and could not fathom why her brother spoke of security with such dread in his voice.A soprano turbojet seemed to bear down on them, fading in and out as it tacked through the flora.The creepy apparatus Dopplered down a couple of notes as it came to a stop directly above them.They couldn't see more than the odd glint of colored light, picked up by whatever itwas from the distant mediatrons.A voice, flawlessly reproduced and just a hair too loud, came out of it:  "Visitors are welcome to stroll through this park at any time.We hope you have enjoyed your stay.Please inquire if you need directions, and this unit will assist you. ""It's nice," Nell said."Not for long," Harv said."Let's get out of here before it gets pissed. ""I like it here. "Bluish light exploded out of the aerostat.They both hollered as their irises convulsed.It was hollering right back at them: "Allow me to light your way to the nearest exit!""We're running away from home," Nell explained.But Harv was scrambling up out of the hole, yanking Nell behind him with his good hand.The thing's turbines screeched briefly as it made a bluff charge.In this fashion it herded them briskly toward the nearest street.When they had finally climbed over a barrier and gotten their feet back on concreta firma, it snapped off its light and zoomed off without so much as a fare thee well."It's okay, Nell, they always do that. ""Why?""So this place don't fill up with transients. ""What's that?""That's what we are, now," Harv explained."Let's go stay with your buds!"Nell said.Harv had never introduced Nell to any of his buds before, she knew them only as children of earlier epochs knew Gilgamesh, Roland, or Superman.She was under the impression that the streets of the Leased Territories were rife with Harv's buds and that they were more or less all powerful.Harv's face squirmed for a while, and then he said, "We gotta talk about your magic book. ""The Young Lady's Illustrated Primer?""Yeah, whatever it's called. ""Why must we talk about it?""Huh?"Harv said in the dopey voice he affected whenever Nell talked fancy."Why do we gotta talk about it?"Nell said patiently."There's something I never told you about that book, but I gotta tell you now," Harv said."Come on, let's keep moving, or some creep's gonna come hassle us. "They headed toward the main street of Lazy Bay Towne, which was the Leased Territory into which the pod had ejected them.The main street curved along the waterfront, separating a beach from a very large number of drinking establishments fronted with lurid, bawdy mediatrons."I don't want to go that way," Nell said, remembering that last gauntlet of electromagnetic pimps.But Harv grabbed her wrist and hobbled downhill, pulling her behind."It's safer than being in the back streets.Now let me tell you about that book.My buds and I pinched it and some other stuff from a Vicky we rolled.Doc told us to roll him. ""Doc?""This Chinese guy who runs the Flea Circus.He said we should roll him, and make sure we made it good so it'd get picked up on the monitors. ""What does that mean?""Never mind.He also said he wanted us to lift something from this Vicky a certain package about yay big. "Harv formed right angles with his thumbs and index fingers and defined the vertices of a rectangle, book size."Gave us to understand it was valuable.Well, we didn't find any such package.We did find a shitty old book on him, though.I mean, it looked old and fine, but no one reckoned it could be the thing Doc was looking for, since he's got lots of books.So I took it for you."Well, a week or two later, Doc wants to know where is the package, and we told him this story.When he heard about that book, he flipped and told us that the book and the package were one and the same..By that time, you were already playing with that book all night and all day, Nell, and I couldn't bear to take it away from you, so I lied.I told him I threw the book down on the sidewalk when I saw it was junk, and if it wasn't still there, then someone else must have come along and picked it up.Doc was pissed, but he fell for it."That's why I never brought my buds to the flat.If anyone finds out you still have that book, Doc'll kill me. ""What should we do?"Harv got a look on his face like he'd rather not talk about it."For starters, let's get some free stuff. "They took a sneaky and indirect route to the waterfront, staying as far as possible from the clusters of drunks winding through the constellation of incandescent bordellos like cold dark clumps of rock wending their way through a bright nebula of young stars.They made their way to a public M. C.  on a streetcorner and picked out items from the free menu: boxes of water and nutri broth, envelopes of sushi made from nanosurimi and rice, candy bars, and packages about the size of Harv's hand, festooned with implausible block letter promises ("REFLECTS 99% OF INFRARED!")that folded out into huge crinkly metallized blankets.Nell had been noticing a lot of rough shapes strewn around on the beach like giant chrome plated larva.Must be fellow transients wrapped up in these selfsame.As soon as they had scored the goodies, they ran down to the beach and picked out their own spot.Nell wanted one closer to the surf, but Harv made some very well considered observations about the inadvisability of sleeping below high tide.They trudged along the seawall for a good mile or so before finding a relatively abandoned bit of beach and wrapped themselves up in their blankets there.Harv insisted that one of them had to stay awake at all times to act as a sentry.Nell had learned all about this kind of thing from her virtual adventures in the Primer, and so she volunteered to stay up first.Harv went to sleep pretty soon, and Nell opened up her book.At times like this, the paper glowed softly and the letters stood out crisp and black, like tree branches silhouetted against a full moon.Miranda's reactions to the evening's events;  solace from an unexpected quarter;  from the Primer, the demise of a hero, flight to the Land Beyond, and the lands of King Magpie.The Theatre Parnasse had a rather nice bar, nothing spectacular, just a sort of living room off the main floor, with the bar itself recessed into one wall.The old furniture and pictures had been looted by the Red Guards and later replaced with post Mao stuff that was not as fine.The management kept the booze locked up when the ractors were working, not sharing any romantic notions about substance abusing creative geniuses.Miranda stumbled down from her box, fixed herself a club soda, and settled into a plastic chair.She put her shaking hands together like the covers of a book and then buried her face in them.After a few deep breaths she got tears to come, though they came silently, a temporary letting off steam cry, not the catharsis she was hoping for.She hadn't earned the catharsis yet, she knew, because what had happened was just the first act.Just the initial incident, or whatever they called it in the books."Rough session?"said a voice.Miranda recognized it, but just barely: It was Carl Hollywood, the dramaturge, in effect her boss.But he didn't sound like a gruff son of a bitch tonight, which was a switch.Carl was in his forties, six and a half feet tall, massively built and given to wearing long black coats that almost swept the floor.He had long wavy blond hair drawn back from his forehead and affected a sort of King Tut beard.Either he was celibate, or else he believed that the particulars of his sexual orientation and needs were infinitely too complex to be shared with those he worked with.Everyone was scared shitless of him, and he liked it that way; he couldn't do his job if he was buddies with all of the ractors.She heard his cowboy boots approaching across the bare, stained Chinese rug.He confiscated her club soda."Don't want to drink this fizzy stuff when you're having a cry.It'll come out your nose.You need something like tomato juice replace those lost electrolytes.I tell you what," he said, rattling his tremendous keychain, "I'll break the rules and fix you an honest to god bloody mary.Usually I make 'em with tabasco, which is how we do it where I'm from.But since your mucus membranes are already irritated enough, I'll just make a boring one. "By the time he was finished with this oration, Miranda had gotten her hands away from her face at least.She turned away from him."Kind of funny racting in that little box, ain't it," Carl said, "kind of isolating.Theatre didn't used to be that way. ""Isolating?Sort of," Miranda said."I could use a little more isolation tonight. ""You telling me to leave you alone, or "  "No!"Miranda said, sounding desperate to herself.She brought her voice to heel before continuing."No, that's not how I meant it.It's just that you never know what role you're going to play.And some of the roles can cut pretty deep.If someone handed me a script for what I just did and asked me if I were interested in the part, I'd refuse it. ""Was it a porn thing?"Carl Hollywood said.His voice sounded a bit strangled.He was angry all of a sudden.He had stopped in the middle of the room, clenching her bloody mary as if he might pop the glass in his fist."No.It wasn't like that," Miranda said."At least, it wasn't porn in the sense you're talking about," Miranda said, "though you never know what turns people on. ""Was the payer looking to get turned on?""No.Absolutely not," Miranda said.Then, after a long time, she said, "It was a kid.A little girl. "Carl gave her a searching look, then remembered his manners and glanced away, pretending to appraise the carving on the front of the bar."So the next question is," Miranda said after she'd steadied herself with a few gulps of the drink, "why I should get so upset over a kiddie ractive. "Carl shook his head."I wasn't going to ask it. ""But you're wondering. ""What I'm wondering about is my problem," Carl said."Let's concentrate on your problems for now. "He frowned, sat down across from her and ran his hand back through his hair absent mindedly."Is this that big account?"He had access to her spreadsheets; he knew how she'd been spending her time."Yeah. ""I've sat in on a few of those sessions. ""I know you have. ""Seems different from normal kiddie stuff.The education is there, but it's darker.Lots of unreconstructed Grimm Brothers content.Powerful. ""Yeah. ""It's amazing to me that one kid can spend that much time "  "Me too. "Miranda took another swallow, then bit off the end of the celery stick and chewed awhile, stalling."What it comes down to," she said, "is that I'm raising someone's kid for them. "Carl looked her straight in the eye for the first time in a while."And some heavy shit just went down," he said."Some very heavy shit, yes. "Carl nodded."It's so heavy," Miranda said, "that I don't even know if this girl is alive or dead. "Carl glanced up at the fancy old clock on the wall, its face yellowed from a century and a half's accumulation of tar and nicotine."If she's alive," he said, "then she probably needs you. ""Right," Miranda said.She stood up and headed for the exit.Then, before Carl could react, she spun on the ball of her foot, bent down, and kissed him on the cheek."Aw, stop it," he said."See you later, Carl.Thanks. "She ran up the narrow staircase heading for her box.Baron Burt lay dead upon the floor of the Dark Castle.Princess Nell was terrified of the blood that gushed from his wound, but she approached him bravely and plucked the keychain with the twelve keys from his belt.Then she gathered up her Night Friends, tucking them into a little knapsack, and hurriedly packed a picnic lunch while Harv gathered up blankets and ropes and tools for their journey.They were walking across the courtyard of the Dark Castle, heading for the great gate with its twelve locks, when suddenly the evil Queen appeared before them, as tall as a giant, wreathed in lightning and thunder clouds!Tears gushed from her eyes and turned to blood as they rolled down her cheeks."You have taken him away from me!"she cried.And Nell understood that this was a terrible thing for her wicked stepmother, because she was weak and helpless without a man."For this," the Queen continued, "I shall curse you to remain locked up in this Dark Castle forever!"And she reached down with one hand like talons and snatched the keychain from Princess Nell's hand.Then she turned into a great vulture and flew away across the ocean toward the Land Beyond."We are lost!"Harv cried."Now we shall never escape from this place!"But Princess Nell did not lose hope.Not long after the Queen had vanished over the horizon, another bird came flying toward them.It was the Raven, their friend from the Land Beyond, who frequently came to visit them and to entertain them with stories of far off countries and famous heroes."Now is your chance to escape," said the Raven."The evil Queen is engaged in a great battle of sorcery with the Faery Kings and Queens who rule the Land Beyond.Throw a rope out of yon arrow slit, and climb down to freedom. "Princess Nell and Harv climbed the stairway into one of the bastions flanking the Dark Castle's main gate.These had narrow windows where in olden times soldiers should shoot arrows down at invaders.Harv tied one end of a rope to a hook in the wall and threw it out one of these slits.Princess Nell threw her Night Friends out, knowing that they would land harmlessly below.Then she climbed out through the slit and down the rope to freedom."Follow me, Harv!"she cried."All is well down here, and it is a much brighter place than you can possibly imagine!""I cannot," he said."I am too big to pass through the slit. "And he began to throw out the loaves of bread, pieces of cheese, wineskins, and pickles that they had packed for their lunch."Then I will come back up the rope and stay with you," Princess Nell said generously."No!"Harv said, and reeled in the rope, trapping Nell on the outside."But I will be lost without you!"Princess Nell cried."That's your stepmother talking," Harv said."You are a strong, smart, and brave girl and can do fine without me. ""Harv is right," said the Raven, flying overhead."Your destiny is in the Land Beyond.Hurry, lest your stepmother return and trap you here. ""Then I will go to the Land Beyond with my Night Friends," said Princess Nell, "and I will find the twelve keys, and I will come back here one day and free you from this Dark Castle. ""I'm not holding my breath," Harv said, "but thanks anyway. "Down on the shore was a little boat that Nell's father had once used to row around the island.Nell climbed in with her Night Friends and began to row.Nell rowed for many hours until her back and shoulders ached.The sun set in the west, the sky became dark, and it became harder to make out the Raven against the darkling sky.Then, much to her relief, her Night Friends came alive as they always did.There was plenty of room in the boat for Princess Nell, Purple, Peter, and Duck, but Dinosaur was so big that he nearly swamped it; he had to sit in the bow and row while the others sat in the stern trying to balance his weight.They moved much faster with Dinosaur's strong rowing; but early in the morning a storm blew up, and soon the waves were above their heads, above even Dinosaur's head, and rain was coming down so fast that Purple and Princess Nell had to bail using Dinosaur's shiny helmet as a bucket.Dinosaur threw out all of his armor to lighten the load, but it soon became evident that this was not enough."Then I shall do my duty as a warrior," Dinosaur said."My usefulness to you is finished, Princess Nell; from now, you must listen to the wisdom of your other Night Friends and use what you have learned from me only when nothing else will work. "And he dove into the water and disappeared beneath the waves.The boat bobbed up like a cork.An hour later, the storm began to diminish, and as dawn approached, the ocean was smooth as glass, and filling the western horizon was a green country vaster than anything Princess Nell had ever imagined: the Land Beyond.Princess Nell wept bitterly for lost Dinosaur and wanted to wait on the shore in case he had clung to a piece of flotsam or jetsam and drifted to safety."We must not dawdle here," Purple said, "lest we be seen by one of King Magpie's sentries. ""King Magpie?"said Princess Nell."One of the twelve Faery Kings and Queens.This shore is part of his domain," Purple said."He has a flock of starlings who watch his borders. ""Too late!"cried sharp eyed Peter."We are discovered!"At that moment, the sun rose, and the Night Friends turned back into stuffed animals.A solitary bird was diving toward them out of the morning sky.When it drew closer, Princess Nell saw that it was not one of King Magpie's starlings after all; it was their friend the Raven.He landed on a branch above her head and cried,  "Good news!Bad news!Where shall I start?""With the good news," Princess Nell said."The wicked Queen lost the battle.Her power has been broken by the other twelve. ""What is the bad news?""Each of them took one of the twelve keys as spoil and locked it up in his or her royal treasury.You will never be able to collect all twelve. ""But I am sworn to get them," said Princess Nell, "and Dinosaur showed me last night that a warrior must hold to her duty even if it leads her into destruction.Show me the way to the castle of King Magpie; we will get his key first. "She plunged into the forest and, before long, found a dirt road that the Raven said would lead her toward King Magpie's castle.After a break for lunch she started down this road, keeping one sharp eye on the sky.There followed a funny little chapter in which Nell encountered the footprints of another traveler on the road, who was soon joined by another traveler, and another.This continued until nightfall, when Purple examined the footprints and informed Princess Nell that she had been walking in circles all day."But I have followed the road carefully," Nell said."The road is one of King Magpie's tricks," Purple said."It is a circular road.In order to find his castle, we must put on our thinking caps and use our own brains, for everything in this country is a trick of one kind or another. ""But how can we find his castle if all of the roads are made to deceive us?"Peter Rabbit said."Nell, do you have your sewing needle?"Purple said."Yes," said Nell, reaching into her pocket and taking out her mending kit."Peter, do you have your magic stone?"Purple continued."Yes," Peter said, taking it out of his pocket.It did not look magic, being just a gray lump, but it had the magic property of attracting small bits of metal."And Duck, can you spare a cork from one of the lemonade bottles?""This one's almost empty," Duck said."Very well.I will also need a bowl of water," Purple said, and collected the three items from her three friends.Nell read on into the Primer, learning about how Purple made a compass by magnetizing the needle, thrusting it through the cork, and floating it in the bowl of water.She read about their three day journey through the land of King Magpie, and of all the tricks it contained animals that stole their food, quicksand, sudden rainstorms, appetizing but poisonous berries, snares, and pitfalls set to catch uninvited guests.Nell knew that if she wanted, she could go back and ask questions about these things later and spend many hours reading about this part of the adventure.But the important part seemed to be the discussions with Peter that ended each day's journey.Peter Rabbit was their guide through all of these perils.His eyes were sharp from eating carrots, and his giant ears could hear trouble coming from miles away.His quivering nose sniffed out danger, and his mind was too sharp for most of King Magpie's tricks.Before long they had reached the outskirts of King Magpie's city, which did not even have a wall around it, so confident was King Magpie that no invader could possibly pass through all of the traps and pitfalls in the forest.Princess Nell in the city of King Magpie;  hyena trouble;  the story of Peter;  Nell deals with a stranger.The city of King Magpie was more frightening to Princess Nell than any wilderness, and she would have sooner trusted her life to the wild beasts of the forest than to many of its people.They tried to sleep in a nice glade of trees in the middle of the city, which reminded Princess Nell of the glades on the Enchanted Isle.But before they could even make themselves comfortable, a hissing hyena with red eyes and dripping fangs came and chased them all away."Perhaps we can sneak back into the glade after it gets dark, when the hyena will not see us," Nell suggested."The hyena will always see us, even in the dark, because it can see the infrared light that comes out of our bodies," Purple said.Eventually, Nell, Peter, Duck, and Purple found a place to camp in a field where other poor people lived.Duck set up a little camp and lit a fire, and they had some soup before going to bed.But try as she might, Princess Nell could not sleep.She saw that Peter Rabbit could not sleep either; he only sat with his back to the fire looking off into the darkness."Why are you looking into the darkness and not into the fire as we do?"Nell asked."Because the darkness is where danger comes from," Peter said, "and from the fire comes only illusion.When I was a little bunny running away from home, that is one of the first lessons I learned. "Peter went on to tell his own story, just as Dinosaur had earlier in the Primer.It was a story about how he and his brothers had run away from home and fallen afoul of various cats, vultures, weasels, dogs, and humans who tended to see them, not as intrepid little adventurers but as lunch.Peter was the only one of them who had survived, because he was the cleverest of them all.I made up my mind that one day I would avenge my brothers," Peter said."Did you?""Well, that's a long story in itself. ""Tell it to me!"Princess Nell said.But before Peter could launch into the next part of his story, they became aware of a stranger who was approaching them."We should wake up Duck and Purple," Peter said."Oh, let them sleep," Princess Nell said."They can use the rest, and this stranger doesn't look so bad. ""What does a bad stranger look like exactly?"Peter said."You know, like a weasel or a vulture," Princess Nell said."Hello, young lady," said the stranger, who was dressed in expensive clothes and jewelry."I couldn't help noticing that you are new to beautiful Magpie City and down on your luck.I can't sit in my comfortable, warm house eating my big, tasty meals without feeling guilty, knowing that you are out here suffering.Won't you come with me and let me take care of you?""I won't leave my friends behind," said Princess Nell."Of course not I wasn't suggesting that," the stranger said."Too bad they're asleep.Say, I have an idea!You come with me, your rabbit friend stays awake here to keep an eye on your sleeping friends, and I'll show you my place y'know, prove to you that I'm not some kind of creepy stranger who's trying to take advantage of you, like you see in all those dumb kids' stories that only little babies read.You're not a little baby, are you?""No, I don't think so," Princess Nell said."Then come with me, give me a fair hearing, check me out, and if I turn out to be an okay guy, we'll come back and pick up the rest of your little group.Come on, time's a wasting!"Princess Nell found it very hard to say no to the stranger."Don't go with him, Nell!"Peter said.But in the end, Nell went with him anyway.In her heart she knew it was wrong, but her head was foolish, and because she was still just a little girl, she did not feel she could say no to a grownup man.At this point the story became very ractive.Nell stayed up for a while in the ractive, trying different things.Sometimes the man gave her a drink, and she fell asleep.But if she refused to take the drink, he would grab her and tie her up.Either way, the man always turned out to be a pirate, or else he would sell Princess Nell to some other pirates who would keep her and not let her go.Nell tried every trick she could think of, but it seemed as though the ractive were made in such a way that, once she'd made the decision to go away with the stranger, nothing she could do would prevent her from becoming a slave to the pirates.After the tenth or twelfth iteration she dropped the book into the sand and hunched over it, crying.She cried silently so Harv wouldn't wake up.She cried for a long time, seeing no reason to stop, because she felt that she was trapped now, just like Princess Nell in the book."Hey," said a man's voice, very soft.At first Nell thought it was coming out of the Primer, and she ignored it because she was angry at the Primer."What's wrong, little girl?"said the voice.Nell tried to look up toward the source, but all she saw was fat colored light from the mediatrons filtered through tears.She rubbed her eyes, but her hands had sand on them.She got panicky for a moment, because she had realized there was definitely someone there, a grownup man, and she felt blind and helpless.Finally she got a look at him.He was squatting about six feet away from her, a safe enough distance, watching her with his forehead all wrinkled up, looking terribly concerned."There's no reason to be crying," he said."It can't be that bad. ""Who are you?"Nell said."I'm just a friend who wants to help you.C'mon," he said, cocking his head down the beach."I need to talk to you for a second, and I don't want to wake up your friend there. ""Talk to me about what?""How I can help you out.Now, come on, do you want help or not?""Sure," Nell said."Okay.C'mon then," the stranger said, rising to his feet.He took a step toward Nell, bent down, and held out one hand.Nell reached for him with her left and at the last minute flung a handful of sand into his face with her right."Fuck!"the stranger said."You little bitch, I'm gonna get you for that. "The nunchuks were, as always, under Harv's head.Nell yanked them out and turned back toward the stranger, spinning her whole body around and snapping her wrist at the last moment just as Dojo had taught her.The end of the nunchuk struck the stranger's left kneecap like a steel cobra, and she heard something crack.The stranger screamed, astonishingly loud, and toppled into the sand.Nell spun the nunchuks around, working them up to a hum, and drew a bead on his temporal bone.But before she could strike, Harv grabbed her wrist.The free end of the weapon spun around out of control and bonked her on the eyebrow, splitting it open and giving her a total body ice cream headache.She wanted to throw up."Good one, Nell," he said, "but now's the time to get the hell out of here. "She snatched up the Primer.The two of them ran off down the beach, jumping over the silver larvae that glittered noisily in the mediatronic light."The cops are probably gonna be after us now," Harv said."We gotta go somewhere. ""Grab one of those blankets," Nell said."I have an idea. "They had left their own silvery blanket behind.A discarded one was overflowing from a wastebasket by the seawall, so Harv snatched it as they ran by and crumpled it into a wad.Nell led Harv back to the little patch of forest.They found their way to the little cavity where they had stopped earlier.This time, Nell spread the blanket over both of them, and they tucked it in all around themselves to make a bubble.They waited quietly for a minute, then five, then ten.From time to time they heard the thin whine of a pod going by, but they always kept on going, and before they knew it they were asleep.Mysterious souvenir from Dr.X;  Hackworth's arrival in Vancouver;  the Atlantan quarter of that city;  he acquires a new mode of conveyance.Dr.X had dispatched a messenger to the Shanghai Aerodrome with instructions to seek out Hackworth.The messenger had sidled up next to him while he was addressing a piss trough, greeted him cheerfully, and taken a piss himself.Then the two men had exchanged business cards, accepting them with both hands and a slight bow.Hackworth's card was about as flashy as he was.It was white, with his name stamped out in rather severe capitals.Like most cards, it was made of smart paper and had lots of memory space left over to store digitized information.This particular copy contained a matter compiler program descended from the one that had created the original Young Lady's Illustrated Primer.This revision used automatic voice generation algorithms instead of relying on professional ractors, and it contained all of the hooks that Dr.X's coders would need to translate the text into Chinese.The Doctor's card was more picturesque.It had a few Hanzi characters scrawled across it and also bore Dr.X's chop.Now that paper was smart, chops were dynamic.The stamp infused the paper with a program that caused it to run a little graphics program forever.Dr.X's chop depicted a poxy looking gaffer with a conical hat slung on his back, squatting on a rock in a river with a bamboo pole, hauling a fish out of the water no wait, it wasn't a fish, it was a dragon squirming on the end of the line, and just as you realized it, the gaffer turned and smiled at you insolently.This kitschy tableau then freeze framed and morphed cleverly into the characters representing Dr.X's name.Then it looped back to the beginning.On the back of the card were a few mediaglyphs indicating that it was, in fact, a chit: that is to say, a totipotent program for a matter compiler, combined with sufficient ucus to run it.The mediaglyphs indicated that it would run only on a matter compiler of eight cubic meters or larger, which was enormous, and which made it obvious he was not to use it until he reached America.He debarked from the Hanjin Takhoma at Vancouver, which besides having the most scenic airship moorage in the world, boasted a sizable Atlantan clave.Dr.X hadn't given him a specific destination just the chit and a flight number so there didn't seem any point in staying aboard all the way to the end of the line.From here he could always bullet train down the coast if necessary.The city itself was a sprawling bazaar of claves.Consequently it was generously supplied with agoras, owned and managed by Protocol, where citizens and subjects of different phyles could convene on neutral ground and trade, negotiate, fornicate, or whatever.Some of the agoras were simply open plazas in the classical tradition, others looked more like convention centers or office buildings.Many of Old Vancouver's pricier and more view endowed precincts had been acquired by the Hong Kong Mutual Benevolent Society or the Nipponese, and the Confucians owned the tallest office building in the downtown area.East of town in the fertile delta of the Fraser River, the Slays and the Germans were both supposed to have large patches of Lebensraum staked out, surrounded by grids of somewhat nastier than usual security pods.Hindustan had a spray of tiny claves all over the metropolitan area.The Atlantis clave climbed out of the water half a mile west of the university, to which it was joined by a causeway.Imperial Tectonics had made it look like just another island, as if it had been sitting there for a million years.As Hackworth's rented velocipede took him over the causeway, cool salt air flowing through his stubble, he began to relax, finding himself once again on home territory.On an emerald green playing field above the breakwater, young boys in short pants were knotted into a scrum, playing at fieldball.On the opposite side of the road was the girls' school, which had its own playing field of equal size, except that this one was surrounded by a dense twelve foot hedge so that the girls could run around in very little or skin tight clothing without giving rise to etiquette problems.He hadn't slept well in his microberth and wouldn't have minded checking into the guest hostel and taking a nap, but it was only eleven in the morning and he couldn't see wasting the day.So he rode his velocipede to the center of town, stopped in at the first pub he saw, and had lunch.The bartender gave him directions to the Royal Post Office, which was just a few blocks away.The post office was a big one, sporting a variety of matter compilers, including a ten cubic meter model directly adjacent to the loading dock.Hackworth shoved Dr.X's chit into its reader and held his breath.But nothing dramatic happened; the display on the control panel said that this job was going to take a couple of hours.Hackworth killed most of the time wandering around the clave.The middle of town was smallish and quickly gave way to leafy neighborhoods filled with magnificent Georgian, Victorian, and Romanesque homes, with the occasional rugged Tudor perched on a rise or nestled into a verdant hollow.Beyond the homes was a belt of gentrified farms mingled with golf courses and parks.He sat down on a bench in one flowery public garden and unfolded the sheet of mediatronic paper that was keeping track of the movements of the original copy of the Young Lady's Illustrated Primer.It seemed to have spent some time in a green belt and then made its way up the hill in the general direction of the New Atlantis Clave.Hackworth took out his fountain pen and wrote a short letter addressed to Lord Finkle McGraw.Your Grace,  Since accepting the trust you have reposed in me, I have endeavoured to be perfectly frank, serving as an open conduit for all information pertaining to the task at hand.In that spirit, I must inform you that two years ago, in my desperate search for the lost copy of the Primer, I initiated a search of the Leased Territories ...(&c. , &c. )Please find enclosed a map and other data regarding the recent movements of this book, whose whereabouts were unknown to me until yesterday.I have no way of knowing who possesses it, but given the book's programming, I suspect it to be a young thete girl, probably between the ages of five and seven.The book must have remained indoors for the last two years, or else my systems would have detected it.If these suppositions are correct, and if my invention has not fallen desperately short of intentions, then it is safe to assume that the book has become an important part of the girl's life ...He went on to write that the book should not be taken from the girl if this were the case; but thinking about it a bit more carefully, he scribbled out that part of the letter and it vanished from the page.It was not Hackworth's role to tell Finkle McGraw how to manage affairs.He signed the letter and dispatched it.Half an hour letter, his pen chimed again and he checked his mail.Hackworth,  Message received.Better late than never.Can't wait to meet the girl.Yours &c.   Finkle McGraw   When Hackworth got back to the post office and looked through the window of the big matter compiler, he saw a large machine taking shape in the dim red light.Its body had already been finished and was now rising slowly as its four legs were compiled underneath.Dr.X had provided Hackworth with a chevaline.Hackworth noted, not without approval, that this one's engineers had put a high priority on the virtues of simplicity and strength and a low priority on comfort and style.Very Chinese.No effort was made to disguise it as a real animal.Much of the mechanical business in the legs was exposed so that you could see how the joints and pushrods worked, a little like staring at the wheels of an old steam locomotive.The body looked gaunt and skeletal.It was made of star shaped connectors where five or six cigarette size rods would come together, the rods and connectors forming into an irregular web that wrapped around into a geodesic space frame.The rods could change their length.Hackworth knew from seeing the same construction elsewhere that the web could change its size and shape to an amazing degree while providing whatever combination of stiffness and flexibility the controlling system needed at the moment.Inside the space frame Hackworth could see aluminum plated spheres and ellipsoids, no doubt vacuum filled, containing the mount's machinephase guts: basically some rod logic and an energy source.The legs compiled quickly, the complicated feet took a little longer.When it was finished, Hackworth released the vacuum and opened the door."Fold," he said.The chevaline's legs buckled, and it lay down on the floor of the M. C.  Its space frame contracted as much as it could, and its neck shortened.Hackworth bent down, laced his fingers through the space frame, and lifted the chevaline with one hand.He carried it through the lobby of the post office, past bemused customers, and out the door onto the street."Mount," he said.The chevaline rose into a crouch.Hackworth threw one leg over its saddle, which was padded with some kind of elastomeric stuff, and immediately felt it shoving him into the air.His feet left the ground and flailed around until they found the stirrups.A lumbar support pressed thoughtfully on his kidneys, and then the chevaline trotted into the street and began heading back toward the causeway.It wasn't supposed to do that.Hackworth was about to tell it to stop.Then he figured out why he'd gotten the chit at the last minute:  Dr.X's engineers had been programming something into this mount's brain, telling it where to take him."Name?"Hackworth said."Unnamed," the chevaline said."Rename Kidnapper," Hackworth said."Name Kidnapper," said Kidnapper; and sensing that it was reaching the edge of the business district, it started to canter.Within a few minutes they were blasting across the causeway at a tantivy.Hackworth turned back toward Atlantis and looked for pursuing aerostats; but if Napier was tracking him, he was doing so with some subtlety.A morning stroll through the Leased Territories;  Dovetail;  a congenial Constable.High up the mountain before them, they could see St.Mark's Cathedral and hear its bells ringing changes, mostly just tuneless sequences of notes, but sometimes a pretty melody would tumble out, like an unexpected gem from the permutations of the I Ching.The Diamond Palace of Source Victoria glittered peach and amber as it caught the sunrise, which was still hidden behind the mountain.Nell and Harv had slept surprisingly well under the silver blanket, but they had not by any means slept late.The martial reveille from the Sendero Clave had woken them, and by the time they hit the streets again, Sendero's burly Korean and Incan evangelists were already pouring out of their gate into the common byways of the Leased Territories, humping their folding mediatrons and heavy crates of little red books."We could go in there, Nell," Harv said, and Nell thought he must be joking."Always plenty to eat and a warm cot in Sendero. ""They wouldn't let me keep my book," Nell said.Harv looked at her, mildly startled."How do you know?Oh, don't tell me, you learned it from the Primer. ""They only have one book in Sendero, and it tells them to burn all the other books. "As they climbed toward the green belt, the way got steeper and Harv started wheezing.From time to time he would stop with his hands on his knees and cough in high hoarse bursts like the bark of a seal.But the air was cleaner up here, they could tell by the way it felt going down their throats, and it was colder too, which helped.A band of forest surrounded the high central plateau of New Chusan.The clave called Dovetail backed right up against this green belt and was no less densely wooded, though from a distance it had a finer texture more and smaller trees, and many flowers.Dovetail was surrounded by a fence made of iron bars and painted black.Harv took one look at it and said it was a joke if that was all the security they had.Then he got to noticing that the fence was lined with a greensward about a stone's throw in width, smooth enough for championship croquet.He raised his eyebrows significantly at Nell, implying that any unauthorized personnel who tried to walk across it would be impaled on hydraulic stainless steel spikes or shot through with cookiecutters or rent by robot dogs.The gates to Dovetail stood wide open, which deeply alarmed Harv.He got in front of Nell lest she try to run through them.At the boundary line, the pavement changed from the usual hard but flexible, smoothbut high traction nanostuff to an irregular mosaic of granite blocks.The only human in evidence was a white haired Constable whose belly had created a visible divergence between his two rows of brass buttons.He was bent over using a trowel to extract a steaming turd from the emerald grass.Circumstances suggested that it had come from one of two corgis who were even now slamming their preposterous bodies into each other not far away, trying to roll each other over, which runs contrary to the laws of mechanics even in the case of corgis that are lean and trim, which these were not.This struggle, which appeared to be only one skirmish in a conflict of epochal standing, had driven all lesser considerations, such as guarding the gate, from the combatants' sphere of attention, and so it was the Constable who first noticed Nell and Harv."Away with you!"he hollered cheerfully enough, waving his redolent trowel down the hill."We've no work for such as you today!And the free matter compilers are all down by the waterfront. "The effect of this news on Harv was contrary to what the Constable had intended, for it implied that sometimes there was work for such as him.He stepped forward alertly.Nell took advantage of this to run out from behind him."Pardon me, sir," she called, "we're not here for work or to get free things, but to find someone who belongs to this phyle. "The Constable straightened his tunic and squared his shoulders at the appearance of this little girl, who looked like a thete but talked like a Vicky.Suspicion gave way to benevolence, and he ambled toward them after shouting a few imprecations at his dogs, who evidently suffered from advanced hearing loss."Very well," he said."Who is it that you're looking for?""A man by the name of Brad.A blacksmith.He works at a stable in the New Atlantis Clave, taking care of horses. ""I know him well," the Constable said."I'd be glad to ring him for you.You're a ...friend of his, then?""We should like to think that he remembers us favorably," Nell said.Harv turned around and made a face at her for talking this way, but the Constable was eating it up."It's a brisk morning," the Constable said."Why don't you join me inside the gatehouse, where it's nice and cozy, and I'll get you some tea. "On either side of the main gate, the fence terminated in a small stone tower with narrow diamond paned windows set deeply into its walls.The Constable entered one of these from his side of the fence and then opened a heavy wooden door with huge wrought iron hinges, letting Nell and Harv in from their side.The tiny octagonal room was cluttered with fine furniture made of dark wood, a shelf of old books, and a small cast iron stove with a red enamel kettle on top, pocked like an asteroid from ancient impacts, piping out a tenuous column of steam.The Constable directed them into a pair of wooden chairs.Trying to scoot them back from the table, they discovered that each was ten times the weight of any other chair they'd seen, being made of actual wood, and thick pieces of it too.They were not especially comfortable, but Nell liked sitting in hers nevertheless, as something about its size and weight gave her a feeling of security.The windows on the Dovetail side of the gatehouse were larger, and she could see the two corgi dogs outside, peering in through the lead latticework, flabbergasted that they had, through some enormous lacuna in procedure, been left on the outside, wagging their tails somewhat uncertainly, as if, in a world that allowed such mistakes, nothing could be counted on.The Constable found a wooden tray and carried it about the room, cautiously assembling a collection of cups, saucers, spoons, tongs, and other tea related armaments.When all the necessary tools were properly laid out, he manufactured the beverage, hewing closely to the ancient procedure, and set it before them.Resting on a counter by the window was an outlandishly shaped black object that Nell recognized as a telephone, only because she had seen them on the old passives that her mother liked to watch where they seemed to take on a talismanic significance out of proportion to what they actually did.The Constable picked up a piece of paper on which many names and strings and digits had been hand written.He turned his back to the nearest window, then leaned backward over the counter so as to bring most of him closer to its illumination.He tilted the paper into the light and then adjusted the elevation of his own chin through a rather sweeping arc, converging on a position that placed the lenses of his reading spectacles between pupil and page.Having maneuvered all of these elements into the optimal geometry, he let out a little sigh, as though the arrangement suited him, and peered up over his glasses at Nell and Harv for a moment, as if to suggest that they could learn some valuable tricks by keeping a sharp eye on him.Nell watched him, fascinated not least because she rarely saw people in spectacles.The Constable returned his attention to the piece of paper and scanned it with a furrowed brow for a few minutes before suddenly calling out a series of several numbers, which sounded random to his visitors but seemed both deeply significant and perfectly obvious to the Constable.The black telephone sported a metal disk with finger size holes bored around its edge.The Constable hooked the phone's handset over his epaulet and then began to insert his finger into various of these holes, using them to torque the disk around against the countervailing force of a spring.A brief but exceedingly cheerful conversation ensued.Then he hung up the telephone and clasped his hands over his belly, as if he had accomplished his assigned tasks so completely that said extremities were now superfluous decorations."It'll be a minute," he said."Please take your time, and don't scald yourselves on that tea.Care for some shortbread?"Nell was not familiar with this delight."No thank you, sir," she said, but Harv, ever pragmatic, allowed as he might enjoy some.Suddenly the Constable's hands found a new reason for existence and began to busy themselves exploring the darker corners of old wooden cupboards here and there around the little room."By the way," he said absent mindedly, as he pursued this quest, "if you had in mind actually passing through the gate, that is to say, if you wanted to visit Dovetail, as you would be abundantly welcome to do, then you should know a few things about our rules.He stood up and turned toward them, displaying a tin box labeled SHORTBREAD."To be specific, the young gentleman's chocky sticks and switchblade will have to come out of his trousers and lodge here, in the loving care of me and my colleagues, and I will have to have a good long look at that monstrous chunk of rod logic, batteries, sensor arrays, and what haveyou that the young lady is carrying in her little knapsack, concealed, unless I am mistaken, in the guise of a book.Hmmm?"And the Constable turned toward them with his eyebrows raised very high on his forehead, shaking the plaid box.Constable Moore, as he introduced himself, examined Harv's weapons with more care than really seemed warranted, as if they were relics freshly exhumed from a pyramid.He took care to compliment Harv on their presumed effectiveness, and to meditate aloud on the grave foolishness of anyone's messing about with a young fellow like Harv.The weapons went into one of the cupboards, which Constable Moore locked by talking to it."And now the book, young lady," he said to Nell, pleasantly enough.She didn't want to let the Primer out of her hands, but she remembered the kids at the playroom who had tried to take it from her and been shocked, or something, for their trouble.So she handed it over.Constable Moore took it very carefully in both hands, and a tiny little moan of appreciation escaped his lips."I should inform you that sometimes it does rather nasty things to people who, as it supposes, are trying to steal it from me," Nell said, then bit her lip, hoping she hadn't implied that Constable Moore was a thief."Young lady, I should be crestfallen if it didn't. "After Constable Moore had turned the book over in his hands a few times, complimenting Nell on the binding, the gold script, the feel of the paper, be set it down gingerly on the table, first rubbing his hand over the wood to ensure no tea or sugar had earlier been spilled there.He wandered away from the table and seemed to stumble at random upon an oak and brass copier that sat in one of the obtuse corners of the octagonal room.He happened upon a few pages in its output tray and went through them for a bit, from time to time chuckling ruefully.At one point he looked up at Nell and shook his head wordlessly before finally saying, "Do you have any idea ... "but then he just chuckled again, shook his head, and went back to the papers."Right," he finally said, "right. "He fed the papers back into the copier and told it to destroy them.He thrust his fists into his trouser pockets and walked up and down the length of the room twice, then sat down again, looking not at Nell and Harv and not at the book, but somewhere off into the distance."Right," he said."I will not confiscate the book during your stay in Dovetail, if you follow certain conditions.First of all, you will not under any circumstances make use of a matter compiler.Secondly, the book is for your use, and your use only.Third, you will not copy or reproduce any of the information contained in the book.Fourth, you will not show the book to anyone here or make anyone aware of its existence.Violation of any of these conditions will lead to your immediate expulsion from Dovetail and the confiscation and probable destruction of the book.Do I make myself clear?""Perfectly clear, sir," Nell said.Outside, they heard the thrudalump thrudalump of an approaching horse.A new friend;  Nell sees a real horse;  a ride through Dovetail;  Nell and Harv are separated.The person on the horse was not Brad, it was a woman Nell and Harv didn't know.She had straight reddish blond hair, pale skin with thousands of freckles, and carrot colored eyebrows and eyelashes that were almost invisible except when the sun grazed her face."I'm a friend of Brad's," she said."He's at work.Does he know you?"Nell was about to pipe up, but Harv shushed her with a hand on her arm and gave the woman a somewhat more abridged version than Nell might have provided.He mentioned that Brad had been "a friend of" their mother's for a while, that he had always treated them kindly and had actually taken them to the NAC to see the horses.Not far into the story, the blank expression on the woman's face was replaced by one that was somewhat more guarded, and she stopped listening."I think Brad told me about you once," she finally said when Harv had wandered into a blind alley."I know he remembers you.So what is it that you would like to happen now?"This was a poser.Nell and Harv had settled into a habit of concentrating very strongly on what they would like not to happen.They were baffled by options, which to them seemed like dilemmas.Harv left off clutching Nell's arm and took her hand instead.Neither of them said anything."Perhaps," Constable Moore finally said, after the woman had turned to him for a cue, "it would be useful for the two of you to set awhile in some safe, quiet place and gather your thoughts. ""That would do nicely, thank you," Nell said."Dovetail contains many public parks and gardens .."Forget it," the woman said, knowing her cue when she heard it."I'll take them back to the Milihouse until Brad gets home.Then," she said significantly to the Constable, "we'll figure something out. "The woman stepped out of the gatehouse briskly, not looking back at Nell and Harv.She was tall and wore a pair of loose khaki trousers, much worn at the knees but hardly at all in the seat, and splotched here and there with old unidentifiable stains.Above that she wore a very loose Irish fisherman's sweater, sleeves rolled up and safety pinned to form a dense woolen torus orbiting each of her freckled forearms, the motif echoed by a whorl of cheap silver bangles on each wrist.She was muttering something in the direction of her horse, an Appaloosa mare who had already swung her neck down and begun to nuzzle at the disappointingly close cropped grass inside the fence, looking for a blade or two that had not been marked by the assiduous corgis.When she stopped to stroke the mare's neck, Nell and Harv caught up with her and learned that she was simply giving a simplified account of what had just happened in the gatehouse, and what was going to happen now, all delivered rather absent mindedly, just in case the mare might want to know.For a moment Nell thought that the mare might actually be a chevaline dressed up in a fake horse skin, but then it ejected a stream of urine the dimensions of a fencepost, glittering like a light saber in the morning sun and clad in a torn cloak of steam, and Nell smelled it and knew the horse was real.The woman did not mount the horse, which she had apparently ridden bareback, but took its reins as gently as if they were cobwebs and led the horse on.Nell and Harv followed, a few paces behind, and the woman walked across the green for some time, apparently organizing things in her mind, before finally tucking her hair behind her ear on one side and turning toward them."Did Constable Moore talk to you about rules at all?""What rules?"Harv blurted before Nell could get into it in a level of detail that might have cast a negative light on them.Nell marveled for the hundredth time at her brother's multifarious trickiness, which would have done Peter himself proud."We make things," the woman said, as if this provided a nearly perfect and sufficient explanation of the phyle called Dovetail."Brad makes horseshoes.But Brad's the exception because mostly he provides services relating to horses.Doesn't he, Eggshell?"the woman added for the mare's benefit."That's why he had to live down in the L. T.  for a while, because there was disagreement as to whether grooms, butlers, and other service providers fit in with Dovetail's charter.But we had a vote and decided to let them in.This is boring you, isn't it?My name's Rita, and I make paper. ""You mean, in the M. C.?"This seemed like an obvious question to Nell, but Rita was surprised to hear it and eventually laughed it off."I'll show you later.But what I was getting at is that, unlike where you've been living, everything here at Dovetail was made by hand.We have a few matter compilers here.But if we want a chair, say, one of our craftsmen will put it together out of wood, just like in ancient times. ""Why don't you just compile it?"Harv said."The M. C.  can make wood. ""It can make fake wood," Rita said, "but some people don't like fake things. ""Why don't you like fake things?"Nell asked.Rita smiled at her."It's not just us.It's them," she said, pointing up the mountain toward the belt of high trees that separated Dovetail from New Atlantis territory.Light dawned on Harv's face."The Vickys buy stuff from you!"he said.Rita looked a little surprised, as if she'd never heard them called Vickys before."Anyway, what was I getting at?Oh, yeah, the point is that everything here is unique, so you have to be careful with it. "Nell had a rough idea of what unique was, but Harv didn't, and so Rita explained it for a while as they walked through Dovetail.At some length it dawned on both Nell and Harv that Rita was actually trying to tell them, in the most bewilderingly circumspect way imaginable, that she didn't want them  to run around and break stuff.This approach to child behavior modification was so at odds with everything they knew that, in spite of Rita's efforts to be pleasant, the conversation was blighted by confusion on the children's part and frustration on hers.From time to time her freckles vanished as her face turned red.Where Dovetail had streets, they were paved with little blocks of stone laid close together.The vehicles were horses, chevalines, and velocipedes with fat knobby tires.Except for one spot where a number of buildings clustered together around a central green, houses were widely spaced and tended to be very small or very large.All of them seemed to have nice gardens though, and from time to time Nell would dart off the road to smell a flower.At first Rita would watch her nervously, telling her not to pick any of the flowers as they belonged to other people.At the end of a road was a wooden gate with a laughably primitive latch consisting of a sliding plank, glossy with use.Past the gate, the road became a very rough mosaic of flagstones with grass growing between them.It wound between undulating pastures where horses and the occasional dairy cow grazed and eventually terminated at a great three story stone building perched on the bank of a river that ran down the mountain from the New Atlantis Clave.A giant wheel grew out of the side of the building and spun slowly as the river pushed on it.A man stood outside before a large chopping block, using a hatchet with an exceptionally wide blade to split thin wedges of red wood from a log.These were piled into a wicker basket that was hauled up on a rope by a man who stood on the roof, replacing some of the old gray shingles with these new red ones.Harv was paralyzed with wonder at this exhibition and stopped walking.Nell had seen much the same sort of process at work in the pages of her Primer.She followed Rita over to a long low building where the horses lived.Most of the people did not live in the Millhouse proper but in a couple of long outbuildings, two stories each, with workshops below and living quarters above.Nell was a little surprised to see that Rita did not actually live with Brad.Her apartment and her shop were each twice the size of Nell's old flat and filled with fine things of heavy wood, metal, cotton, linen, and porcelain that, as Nell was beginning to understand, had all been made by human hands, probably right here in Dovetail.Rita's shop had great kettles where she would brew thick fibrous stew.She spread the stew thinly over screens to draw out the water and flattened it with a great hand cranked press to make paper, thick and roughedged and subtly colored from the thousands of tiny fibers wending through it.When she had a stack of paper made, she would take it next door to a shop with a sharp oily smell, where a bearded man with a smudged apron would run it through another big hand cranked machine.When it came out of this machine, it had letters on the top, giving the name and address of a lady in New Atlantis.Since Nell had been decorous so far and not tried to stick her fingers into the machinery and not driven anyone to distraction with her questions, Rita gave her leave to visit some of the other shops, as long as she asked permission at each one.Nell spent most of the day making friends with various shopowners: a glassblower, a jeweler, a cabinetmaker, a weaver, even a.  toymaker who gave her a tiny wooden doll in a calico dress.Harv spent a while bothering the men who were putting shingles on the roof, then wandered about in the fields for most of the day, kicking small rocks from place to place, generally scoping out the boundaries and general condition of the community centered on the Millhouse.Nell checked in on him from time to time.At first he looked tense and skeptical, then he relaxed and enjoyed it, and finally, late in the afternoon, he became surly and perched himself on a boulder above the running stream, tossing pebbles into it, chewing his thumbnail, and thinking.Brad came home early, riding a bay stallion straight down the mountain from the New Atlantis Clave, angling through the green belt and piercing the dog pod grid with scant consequences as the authorities knew him.Harv approached him with a formal mien, harrumphing phlegm out of the way as he prepared to offer up an explanation and a plea.But Brad's eyes merely glanced over Harv, settled on Nell, appraised her for a moment, then looked away shyly.The verdict was that they could stay the night, but all else depended on legal niceties that were beyond his powers."Have you done anything the Shanghai Police might find interesting?"Brad asked Harv gravely.Harv said no, a simple no without the usual technicalities, provisos, and subclauses.Nell wanted to tell Brad everything.But she had been noticing how, in the Primer, whenever someone asked Peter Rabbit a direct question of any kind, he always lied."To look at our green fields and big houses, you might think we're on Atlantis turf here," Brad said, "but we're under Shanghai jurisdiction just like the rest of the Leased Territories.Now usually the Shanghai Police don't come around, because we are peaceable folk and because we have made certain arrangements with them.But if it were known that we were harboring runaway gang members "  "'Nuff said," Harv blurted.It was clear that he had already worked all of this out in his head as he sat on the riverbank and was only waiting for the adults to catch up with his logic.Before Nell understood what was going on, he came up to her and gave her a hug and a kiss on the lips.Then he turned away from her and began running across a green field, down toward the ocean.Nell ran after him, but she could not keep up, and finally she fell down in a stand of bluebells and watched Harv dissolve into a curtain of tears.When she could no longer see him, she curled up sobbing, and in time Rita came and gathered her up in her strong arms and carried her slowly back across the field to the Millhouse where the steady wheel rolled.Orphans of the Han are exposed to the benefits of modern educational technology;  Judge Fang reflects on the fundamental precepts of Confucianism.The orphanage ships had built in matter compilers, but they could not, of course, be hooked up to Sources.Instead they drew their supplies of matter from cubical containers, rather like tanks of atoms arranged very precisely.These containers could be loaded on board with cranes and hooked up to the matter compilers in the same way that Feed lines would be if they resided on shore.The ships put in to Shanghai frequently, offloaded empty containers, and took new ones on board their hungry populations were fed almost exclusively on synthetic rice produced by the matter compilers.There were seven ships now.The first five had been named after the Master's Five Virtues, and after that they had taken to naming them after major Confucian philosophers.Judge Fang flew out to the one named (as best it could be translated into English) Generosity of Soul, personally carrying the M. C.  program in the sleeve of his garment.This was the very ship he had visited on the eventful night of his boat ride with Dr.X, and ever since then he had somehow felt closer to these fifty thousand little mice than any of the other quarter million in the other vessels.The program was written to work in a bulk compiler, extruding dozens of Primers each cycle.When the first batch was finished, Judge Fang plucked out one of the new volumes, inspected its cover, which had the appearance of marbled jade, flipped through the pages admiring the illustrations, and cast a critical eye over the calligraphy.Then he carried it down a corridor and into a playroom where a few hundred little mice were running around, blowing off steam.He caught the eye of one girl and beckoned her over.She came, reluctantly, chivvied along by an energetic teacher who alternated between smiling to the girl and bowing to Judge Fang.He squatted so that he could look her in the eye and handed her the book.She was much more interested in the book than in Judge Fang, but she had been taught the proper formalities and bowed and thanked him.Then she opened it up.Her eyes got wide.The book began to talk to her.To Judge Fang the voice sounded a bit dull, the rhythm of the speech not exactly right.But the girl didn't care.The girl was hooked.Judge Fang stood up to find himself surrounded by a hundred little girls, all facing toward the little jade book, standing on tiptoes, mouths open.Finally he had been able to do something unambiguously good with his position.In the Coastal Republic it wouldn't have been possible; in the Middle Kingdom, which hewed to the words and spirit of the Master, it was simply part of his duties.He turned and left the room; none of the girls noticed, which was just as well, as they might have seen a quiver in his lip and a tear in his eye.As he made his way through the corridors toward the upper deck where his airship awaited him, he reviewed for the thousandth time the Great Learning, the kernel of the Master's thought:    The ancients who wished to demonstrate illustrious virtue throughout the kingdom, first ordered well their own states.Wishing to order well their states, they first regulated their families.Wishing to regulate their families, they first cultivated their persons.Wishing to cultivate their persons, they first rectified their hearts.Wishing to rectify their hearts, they first sought to be sincere in their thoughts.Wishing to be sincere in their thoughts, they first extended to the utmost their knowledge.Such extention of knowledge lay in the investigation of things....From the Son of Heaven down to the mass of the people, all must consider the cultivation of the person the root of everything besides.Hackworth receives an ambiguous message;  a ride through Vancouver;  tattooed woman and totem poles;  he enters the hidden world of the Drummers.Kidnapper had a glove compartment of sorts hollowed into the back of its neck.As he was riding across the causeway, Hackworth opened it up because he wanted to see whether it was large enough to contain his bowler without folding, bending, spindling, or mutilating the exquisite hyperboloid of its brim.The answer was that it was just a wee bit too small.But Dr.X had been thoughtful enough to toss in some snacks: a handful of fortune cookies, three of them to be exact.They looked good.Hackworth picked one and snapped it open.The strip of paper bore some kind of gaudily animated geometric pattern, long strands of something tumbling end over end and bouncing against one another.It looked vaguely familiar: These were supposed to be yarrow stalks, which Taoists used for divination.But instead of forming a hexagram of the I Ching, they began falling into place, one after another, in such a way as to form letters in the pseudo Chinese typeface used in the logos of onestar Chinese restaurants.When the last one had bounced into place, the fortune read:  SEEK THE ALCHEMIST."Thanks ever so much, Dr.X," Hackworth snapped.He continued to watch the fortune for a while, hoping that it would turn into something a little more informative, but it was dead, just a piece of litter now and forever.Kidnapper slowed to a canter and cruised purposefully through the university, then turned north and crossed a bridge into the peninsula that contained most of Vancouver proper.The chevaline did a perfectly good job of not stepping on anyone, and Hackworth soon learned to stop worrying and trust its instincts.This left his eyes free to wander through the sights of Vancouver, which had not been advisable when he'd come this way on the velocipede.He had not noticed, before, the sheer maddening profusion of the place, each person seemingly an ethnic group of one, each with his or her own costume, dialect, sect, and pedigree.It was as if, sooner or later, every part of the world became India and thus ceased to function in any sense meaningful to straight arrow Cartesian rationalists like John Percival Hackworth, his family and friends.Shortly after passing the Aerodrome they reached Stanley Park, an unruined peninsula several miles around, which had, thank God, been forked over to Protocol and kept much as it had always been, with the same Douglas firs and mossy red cedars that had been growing there forever.Hackworth had been here a few times and had a vague idea of how it was laid out: restaurants here and there, paths along the beach, a zoo and aquarium, public playing fields.Kidnapper took him for a nice lope along a pebbly beach and then somewhat abruptly bounded up a slope, for that purpose switching into a gait never used by any real horse.Its legs shortened, and it clawed its way surefootedly up the forty five degree surface like a mountain lion.An alarmingly quick zigzag through a stand of firs brought them into an open grassy area.Then Kidnapper slowed to a mere walk, as if it were a real horse that had to be cooled down gradually, and took Hackworth into a semicircle of old totem poles.A young woman was here, standing before one of the poles with her hands clasped behind her back, which would have given her an endearingly prim appearance if she had not been stark naked and covered with constantly shifting mediatronic tattoos.Even her hair, which fell loosely to her waist, had been infiltrated with some kind of nanosite so that each strand's color fluctuated from place to place according to a scheme not just now apparent to Hackworth.She was looking intently at the carving of a totem pole and apparently not for the first time, for her tattoos were done in much the same style.The woman was looking at a totem pole dominated by a representation of an orca, head down and tail up, dorsal fin projecting horizontally out of the pole and evidently carved from a separate piece of wood.The orca's blowhole had a human face carved around it.The face's mouth and the orca's blowhole were the same thing.This promiscuous denial of boundaries was everywhere on the totem poles and on the woman's tattoo: The staring eyes of a bear were also the faces of some other sort of creature.The woman's navel was also the mouth of a human face, much like the orca's blowhole, and sometimes that face became the mouth of a larger face whose eyes were her nipples and whose goatee was her pubic hair.
