He glances at Anderson, explains."If the fires get out of control, we won't have a city to defend. "Anderson studies the spreading fire, the gleam of palace chedi, the Temple of the Emerald Buddha."That fire's near the city pillar. ""Khap.We can't allow the pillar to burn.It would be a bad omen for a new regime that is supposed to be strong and forward looking. "Anderson goes and leans on a balcony railing.His hand, splinted now, still throbs, but with the bone reset by a military doctor, it feels better than it has in hours.A swaddling layer of morphine helps keep the pain at bay.Another arc of fire crosses the sky, a missile that buries itself in the distance, somewhere in the Environment Ministry compound.It's hard to believe the forces that Akkarat has mustered for his ascension.The man had far more power at his disposal than he let on.Anderson pretends nonchalance as he asks the next question."I assume this accelerated schedule won't affect the specifics of our agreement. ""AgriGen remains a favored partner in the new era. "At these soothing words, Anderson relaxes, but Akkarat's next sentence yanks him alert."Of course, the situation has changed somewhat.After all, you were unable to bring certain promised resources to bear. "Anderson looks at him sharply."We had a timetable.The promised troops are en route, along with more weapons and funding. "Akkarat smiles slightly."Don't look so concerned.I'm sure we'll work something out. ""We want the seedbank still. "Akkarat shrugs."I understand your position. ""Don't forget that Carlyle also has the pumps you'll need before the rainy season. "Akkarat glances at Carlyle."I'm sure separate arrangements can be made. ""No!"Carlyle grins, glances from one to the other, then holds up his hands as he backs away."You all work this out.It's not my argument. ""Just so. "Akkarat turns back to the arrangements of the battle.Anderson watches, eyes narrowed.They still have leverage on this man.Guarantees of fertile, latest generation seedstock.Rice that will resist blister rust for at least a dozen plantings.He considers how best to affect Akkarat, to bring him back into alignment, but the morphine and exhaustion of the last twenty four hours are wearing on him.Smoke from one of the fires drifts across them, sending everyone into coughing fits before the wind shifts again.More tracer fire and shells arc across the city, followed by the distant rumble of explosions.Carlyle frowns."What was that?""Probably the Army's Krut Company.Their commander refused our friendship offer.He'll be shelling the anchor pads on behalf of Pracha. "Akkarat says."The white shirts don't want to allow a resupply.They'll also go after the seawalls if we let them. ""But the city would drown. ""And it would be our fault. "Akkarat grimaces."In the December 12 coup, the dikes were barely defended successfully.If Pracha feels he is losing and by now he must know he is then the white shirts may try to take the city hostage to force a more favorable surrender. "He shrugs."It's a pity we don't already have your coal pumps delivered. ""As soon as the shooting stops," Carlyle says, "I'll contact Kolkata and ship them out. ""I would have expected no less. "Akkarat's teeth gleam.Anderson fights to keep the scowl off his own face.He doesn't like their friendly banter.It's almost as if their earlier captivity is forgotten, and Carlyle and Akkarat are old friends.He doesn't like the way Akkarat seems to have separated Anderson's own interests from Carlyle's.Anderson studies the landscape, mulling his options.If he just knew the location of the seedbank, he could order a strike team to move in and take it in the confusion of this urban war  Shouts filter up from below.People milling in the streets, all of them looking toward the havoc, all of them curious what this warfare bodes for them.He follows the gaze of the confused throng.Old Expansion towers stand black amongst the fires, bits of remnant glass windows twinkling merrily with the blazes all around.Beyond the city and the fires, the black ocean ripples, a sheet of darkness.From high up, the seawalls seem curiously insubstantial.A ring of gas lights, and then nothing beyond except hungry blackness."Can they really breach the dikes?"he asks.Akkarat shrugs."There are weak points.We had planned to defend them with additional Navy personnel from the south, but we think we can hold. ""And if you don't?""The man who allows the city to drown will never be forgiven," Akkarat says."It cannot be allowed.We will fight for the dikes as if we are the villagers of Bang Rajan. "Anderson watches the burning fires and the sea beyond.Carlyle leans on the railing beside him.His face glimmers in the light.He has the satisfied smile of a man who cannot lose.Anderson leans over."Akkarat might have influence here, but AgriGen is everywhere else. "He locks eyes with the trader."Remember that. "He's pleased to see Carlyle's smile falter.More gunfire echoes across the landscape.From high up, the battle lacks visceral power.It's a battle of ants fighting over piles of sand.As if someone has kicked two nests together to test the clash of trivial civilizations.Mortars rumble.Fires twinkle and flare.In the distance, a shadow descends from the black night overhead.A dirigible, sinking toward the city blazes.It floats low over the fires and suddenly a portion of a blaze winks out as a deluge of seawater pours from its belly.Akkarat watches, smiling."Ours," he says.And then, as though the fire is not snuffed, but actually airborne, the dirigible explodes.Flames roar around it, pieces of its skin blazing and peeling off, fluttering away as the whole great beast sinks toward the city and crashes to pieces on the buildings."Christ," Anderson says, "you sure you don't want our reinforcements now?"Akkarat's face remains impassive."I didn't think they would have time to deploy missiles. "A massive explosion rocks the city, green gas burning bright, rising at the skyline's edge.A cloud of flame, roiling and expanding.Unimaginable pounds of compressed gas going up in a roaring green mushroom."The Environment Ministry's strategic reserve, I think," Akkarat comments."Beautiful," Carlyle murmurs."Fucking beautiful. "42  Hock Seng shelters in an alley as tanks and trucks rumble down Thanon Phosri.He shudders at the thought of the fuel burning.It has to be much of the Kingdom's diesel stock, all of it going up in a single orgy of violence.Coal smoke fills the air as stoked tanks surge past on clanking treads.Hock Seng crouches in garbage.Everything he planned has fallen apart in this moment of crisis.Instead of waiting and moving north as a careful unit, he left his valuables to burn for the sake of one long shot risk.Quit complaining, you old fool.You would have roasted, your purple baht and your yellow card friends all together, if you hadn't left when you did.Still, he wishes he'd had the forethought to bring at least some of that carefully squirrelled insurance.He wonders if his karma is so broken that he cannot ever truly hope to succeed.He peers into the street again.The SpringLife offices are within view.Best of all, there are no guards present.Hock Seng allows himself a smile at that.The white shirts have their own troubles now.He wheels the bicycle across the street, using it as a crutch to keep him upright.Inside the compound, it looks as though there was brief fighting.A trio of bodies lie against a wall, seemingly executed.Their yellow armbands have been pulled off and tossed in the dust beside them.More foolish children playing at politics   Movement behind him.Hock Seng turns and jams his spring gun into his stalker.Mai gasps as his gun barrel buries itself in her guts.Mewls with fear, eyes wide."What are you doing here?"Hock Seng whispers.Mai stumbles back from his gun."I came to look for you.The white shirts found our village.People are sick there. "She sobs."And then your house burned. "For the first time he sees the soot and cuts covering her body."You were in Yaowarat?In the slums?"he asks, shocked.She nods."I was lucky. "She fights back a sob.Hock Seng shakes his head."Why come here?""I couldn't think of any other place"  "And more people are sick?"She nods, fearful."The white shirts questioned us, I didn't know what to do, I told "  "Don't worry," Hock Seng sets a soothing hand on her shoulder."The white shirts won't trouble us anymore.They have their own problems. ""Do you have " She stops.Finally says, "They burned our village.Everything. "She is a pathetic creature.So small.So vulnerable.He imagines her fleeing her destroyed home, seeking refuge in the only place left to her.And then finding herself in the heart of warfare.A part of him wants to be rid of her burden, but too many have already died around him, and he is obscurely pleased for her company.He shakes his head."Foolish child. "He motions her into the factory."Come with me. "A furious stink envelopes them as the enter the main hall.They both cover their faces, breathing shallowly."The algae baths," Hock Seng murmurs."The kink springs have stopped running the fans.Nothing is being vented. "He climbs the steps to the office, shoves open the door.The room is close and hot and reeks as badly as the manufacturing floor from the long days without air flow.He pushes open shutters, letting in night breeze and city burn.Across the roofs, flames flicker, sparking in the night like prayers going up to heaven.Mai comes to stand beside him, her face illuminated in the irregular glow.A gas lamp is burning freely down on the street, broken.They must be burning all over the city.Hock Seng is somewhat surprised that no one has cut off the gas lines.Someone should have done it already, and yet still this one flares, bright and green, reflecting on Mai's face.She is pretty, he realizes.Slight and beautiful.An innocent trapped amongst warring animals.He turns from the window and goes to squat before the safe.Studies its dials and heavy locks, its combinations and levers.Expensive to manufacture something with so much steel.When he had his own company, when the Tri Clipper ruled the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean, he had one like it in his offices, an heirloom, salvaged from an old bank when it lost liquidity, straight from the vault and carried into Three Prosperities Trading Company with the help of two megodonts.This one sits before him, taunting him.He must destroy it at its joints.It will take time."Come with me," he says.He leads her back down to the factory floor.Mai hangs back when he wants to go into the fining rooms.He hands her a line worker's mask."It should be enough. ""You're sure?"He shrugs."Stay, then. "But she follows him anyway, back to where they store the curing acid.They walk gingerly.He uses a rag to push aside the fining room curtains, careful to let nothing touch him.His breath is loud inside the mask, ragged sawing.The manufacturing rooms are disarrayed.White shirts have been here, inspecting.The stink of the rotting algae tanks is intense, even through the mask.Hock Seng breathes shallowly, forcing himself not to gag.Overhead, the drying screens are all black with withered algae.A few streamers dangle down, black emaciated tentacles.Hock Seng fights the urge to duck from them."What are you doing?"Mai pants."Looking for a future. "He spares her small smile before he realizes she can't see his expressions through the mask.He digs gloves out of a supply cabinet and hands her a pair.Gives her an apron as well."Help me with this. "He indicates a sack of powder."We're working for ourselves, now.No more foreign influences, yes?"He stops her as she reaches for the sack."Don't get any on your skin," he says."And don't let your sweat touch it. "He guides her back up to the offices."What is it?""You shall see, child. ""Yes, but "  "It's magic.Now go get some water from the khlong out back. "When she returns, he takes a knife and carefully slices into the sacking."Bring me the water. "She pulls the bucket close.He dips into the water with his knife, then runs it through the powder.The powder hisses and begins to boil.When he takes the knife out, it's half gone, melted into nothing, still hissing.Mai's eyes go wide.A viscous liquid pours off the knife."What is it?""A specialized bacteria.Something the farang have created. ""Not acid, though"  "No.It's alive.In a way. "He takes the knife and begins to scrape it along the face of the safe.The knife disintegrates completely.Hock Seng grimaces."I need something else, something long, to spread it with. ""Put water on the safe," Mai suggests."Then pour on the powder. "He laughs."Clever child. "Soon the safe is soaking.He prepares a paper funnel and lets the powder stream through in a tiny fountain.Wherever it touches the metal face it begins to boil.Hock Seng steps back, horrified at the speed of the stuff.Fights the urge to wipe his hands."Don't get any on your skin," he mutters.Stares at his gloves.If there is a trace of powder on them and they are wetted His skin crawls.Mai is already backed away to the far side of the office, watching with terrified eyes.Metal pours off the face, eaten and discarded iron, peeling away in sheaves, layers of it flaking away as if blown by autumn winds.The bright leaves of melting iron land on teak flooring.They hiss and spread.The flakes burn on, creating a lattice of broken seared wood."It doesn't stop," Mai says, awed.Hock Seng watches with increasing unease, wondering if the yeastlike stuff will eat away the floor below and send the safe crashing down into the manufacturing lines.He finds his voice."It is alive.It should lose its ability to digest, soon. ""This is what the farang make. "Mai's voice is frightened and awed."Our people have made such things as well. "Hock Seng shakes his head."Don't think the farang are so much as all that. "The safe continues to disintegrate.If only he had been brave before.He could have done this when there wasn't a war boiling outside the window.He wishes he could go back in time to his former frightened paranoid self, so worried about deportation, about angering foreign devils, about preserving his good name, and simply whisper in that old man's ear that there was no hope.That he should steal and run, and it could not turn out worse.A voice interrupts his thoughts."Well, well.Tan Hock Seng.How nice to see you here. "Hock Seng turns.Dog Fucker and Old Bones, along with six others, are standing in the doorway.All of them carrying spring guns.They're scratched and sooted from the warfare of the streets, but smiling and confident."We all seem to have been thinking along the same lines," Dog Fucker observes.An explosion lights the sky, casting orange across the office.The rumble of destruction trembles through Hock Seng's soles.It's hard to tell how far away it was.The shells seem to fall randomly.If there is intelligence guiding them, it's not for them to understand.Another rumble, this one closer.The white shirts, defending the levees, most likely.Hock Seng fights an urge to flee.The cracking of the iron digesting bacteria continues.Leaves of metal waft to the floor.Hock Seng tests the waters."I'm glad you're here.Help me, then.Come on. "Old Bones smiles."I think not. "The men shoulder past Hock Seng.All of them larger than he.All of them armed.All of them uncaring of his and Mai's presence.Hock Seng staggers as they bump him aside."But it's mine," he protests."You can't take it!I told you where it was!"The men ignore him."You can't take it!"Hock Seng fumbles for his gun.Suddenly a pistol presses against his skull.Old Bones, smiling.Dog Fucker watches with interest."Another killing will make little difference on my rebirth.Don't test me. "Hock Seng can barely control his rage.A part of him wants to fire anyway, to steal away the man's smug expression.The safe's metal continues to bubble and hiss, falling away, slowly revealing his last object of hope.The nak leng all watch Hock Seng and Old Bones.They're loose, smiling.Unafraid.They haven't even lifted their pistols.They simply watch, interested, as Hock Seng points his pistol at them.Dog Fucker grins."Go away, yellow card.Before I change my mind. "Mai tugs at Hock Seng's hand."Whatever it is, it isn't worth your life. ""She's right, yellow card," Old Bones says."This is not a fight you can win. "Hock Seng lowers his pistol and allows Mai to pull him away.They back out of the office.The Dung Lord's men watch with small smiles, and then Hock Seng and Mai are going down the stairs and out into the factory, and from there into the rubbled streets.In the distance, a megodont screams in pain.The wind gusts, carrying ash and political pamphlets and the scent of burning WeatherAll.Hock Seng feels old.Too old to still be striving against a fate that clearly wishes him destroyed.Another whisper sheet tumbles past.The headline screams of windup girls and murder.Amazing that Mr.Lake's windup could cause so much trouble.And now everyone in the city is hunting for her.He almost smiles.Even if he's a yellow card, he's not as disadvantaged as that sorry creature.He probably owes her thanks.If it hadn't been for her and the news of Mr.Lake's arrest, he supposes he would be dead by now, burned in the slums with all his jade and cash and diamonds.I should be grateful.Instead, he feels the weight of his ancestors pressing down upon him, crushing him with their judgments.He took what his father and grandfather before him had built in Malaya and turned it to ash.The failure is overwhelming.Another whisper sheet flutters up against the factory wall.The windup girl again, along with accusations against General Pracha.Mr.Lake was obsessed with that windup girl.Couldn't stop fucking her.Couldn't resist bringing her to his bed at every opportunity.Hock Seng picks up the whisper sheet, suddenly thoughtful."What is it?"Mai asks.I am too old for this.But still, Hock Seng feels his heart beating faster."I have an idea," he says."A possibility. "A new absurd flicker of hope.He cannot help it.Even when he has nothing, he must strive.43  A tank round explodes.Dirt and woody debris showers Kanya's head.They've abandoned the Ministry buildings giving ground is what Kanya has called it, but in truth it's a rout running as fast as they can from the oncoming tanks and megodonts.The only thing that has saved them so far is that the army seems intent on securing the main campus of the Ministry, and so its strength remains gathered there.Still, she and her men have encountered three commando units coming over the south walls of the compound and they have cut Kanya's platoon in half.And now another tank, just as they were about to slip out a secondary exit.The tank smashed through the gate and blocked their escape.She has ordered her men into the forest groves near Phra Seub's temple.It is in shambles.The carefully tended garden has been trampled by war megodonts.Its main columns have been burnt by a fire bomb attack that swept through the dry teak of the forest like a raging demon, shrieking and roaring, so now they shelter in ash and stumps and smolder.Another tank shell drops into their hillside position.More commandos slip around the tank, break into teams and dash across the compound.It looks as though they're heading for the biological laboratories.Kanya wonders if Ratana is working there, if she even knows of the warfare above ground.A tree shatters beside her as another tank round explodes."They know we're up here, even if they can't see us," Pai says.As if to emphasize his words, a hail of disks whines overhead, embedding themselves in the burnt forest trunks, gleaming silver in the black wood.Kanya motions to her men that they should pull back.The other white shirts, all their uniforms carefully smeared now with soot and ash, scamper deeper into the guttering forest.Another shell drops below them.Burning teak splinters whine through the air."This is too close. "She gets up and runs, Pai dogging her.Hiroko streaks past, takes cover behind a black fallen log and waits for them to catch up."Can you imagine fighting that?"Pai gasps.Kanya shakes her head.Already the windup has saved them twice.Once by spying out the shadow movement of commandos coming toward them, the second time pushing Kanya down a moment before a rain of spring disks shredded the air above her head.The windup's eyes are sharp where Kanya's are not, and she is blisteringly fast.Already, though, she is flushed, her skin dry and scalding to the touch.Hiroko is not built for this tropic warfare, and even though they pour water on her and try to keep her cool, she is fading.When Kanya catches up, Hiroko looks up at her with fever bright eyes."I will have to drink something soon.Ice. ""We don't have any. ""The river then.Anything.I must return to Yashimoto sama. ""There's fighting all along the river. "Kanya has heard from others that General Pracha is at the levees, trying to repel the landing Navy boats.Fighting his old ally, Admiral Noi.Hiroko reaches out with a scalding hand."I cannot last. "Kanya searches around her, seeking an answer.Bodies are everywhere.It's worse than a plague, the men and women ripped by high explosives.The carnage is immense.Arms and legs, a foot separated and flung into a tree branch.Bodies piled and burning.Napalm hissing.The clank of tanks rumbling through the compounds, the burn of coal exhaust."I need the radio," she says."Pichai had it last. "But Pichai is dead and they aren't sure where the radio has gone.We aren't trained for this sort of thing.We were supposed to stop blister rust and influenza, not tanks and megodonts.When she finally finds a radio, it is from a dead hand that she takes it.She cranks the handset.Tests the codes that the Ministry uses for discussing plagues, not warfare.Nothing.Finally she speaks in the clear."This is Captain Kanya.Is there anyone else out there?Over?"A long pause.The crackle and static.She repeats herself.Again she repeats.Nothing.And then, "Captain?This is Lieutenant Apichart. "She recognizes the assistant's voice."Yes?Where is General Pracha?"More silence."We don't know. ""You aren't with him?"Another pause."We think he's dead. "He coughs."They used a gas. ""Who is our ranking officer?"Another long pause."I believe it is you, ma'am. "She pauses, shocked."It can't be.What about the fifth?""We haven't heard. ""General Som?""He was found in his home, assassinated.Also Karmatha, and Phailin. ""It's not possible. ""It is rumor.But they have not been seen, and General Pracha believed it when we received word. ""No other captains?""Bhirombhakdi was at the anchor pads, but all we see is fire from there. ""Where are you?""An Expansion tower, near Phraram Road."How many do you have with you?""Maybe thirty. "She surveys her people with dismay.Wounded men and women.Hiroko lying against a dead shorn banana tree, face flushed like a Chinese paper lantern, eyes closed.Perhaps dead already.Fleetingly she wonders if she cares about the creature or Her men are all around her, watching.Kanya takes in their pathetic ammunition.Their wounds.So few of them.The radio crackles."What should we do, Captain? "Lieutenant Apichart asks."Our guns don't do anything against tanks.There's no way for us " The channel crackles with static.From the direction of the river, a deep explosion rumbles.Private Sarawut climbs down from a tree."They stopped shelling the docks. ""We're alone," Pai murmurs.44  It's the silence that wakes her.Emiko has passed the night in a blurry sprawl, periods of sleep broken by the rumble of high explosives and the whine of high capacity springs unleashing.Tanks clank down the streets burning coal, but much of it is distant, battles fought in other districts.On the streets bodies lie abandoned, casualties of the riot, now forgotten in the larger conflict.A strange silence has settled over the city.A few candles twinkle in windows where people keep midnight watch on the ravaged city, but nothing else is lit.No gas lights in the buildings or on the streets.Total blackness.It seems that either the city's methane has run out, or someone has finally shut off the mains.Emiko pulls herself out of the garbage, wrinkling her nose in disgust at the discarded melon rinds and banana peels.Against the flame orange sky, she can see a few columns of smoke, but nothing else.The streets are empty.There is no better time for what she plans.She turns her attention to the tower.Six stories above, Anderson sama's apartment waits.If only she can get to it.At first, she had hoped to simply speed through the lobby and find her way higher, but the doors are locked and guards patrol within.And she is now too well known to risk an attempt at direct entrance.But she has an alternative.She is hot.Terribly hot.A green coconut that she found and smashed early in the night is a wistful memory now.She counts the balconies again, one after the other, rising above her.Water is up there.Breezes.Survival and a temporary hiding place, if she can make it.A rumble comes from the distance, then a crackle like fireworks.She listens.Best not to wait any longer.She scrambles for the lowest balcony.It is cased in iron bars, as is the one above.She pulls herself up the face of the first and second balconies, using the easy handholds of the bars to climb.She stands at last on the open third balcony, panting with the effort.She feels dizzy with the heat building within her.Below her, the alley cobbles beckon.She looks up at the balcony lip of the fourth floor.She gathers herself and jumps and is rewarded with a good handhold.She pulls herself up.On the fourth balcony, she perches on its railing, staring up at the fifth.The heat of her exertion is building.She takes a breath and jumps.Her fingers catch.She dangles in the open air.She looks down and immediately regrets it.The alley is far below, now.She slowly pulls herself up, gasping.The apartment within is dark.No one stirs.Emiko tests the iron lattice of the security gate, hoping for a lucky entrance, but it is locked.She would give anything to drink water now, to pour it over her face and body.She studies the security gate's construction, but there is no way for her to break in.One more jump.She returns to the balcony's edge.Her hands are the only part of her that seem to sweat like a normal creature's, and now they are as slick as oil with her body's moisture.She wipes them again and again, trying to make them dry.The intense flush of too much exertion is swallowing her.She scrambles up onto the balcony's lip, balances.Dizzy.She crouches, steadying herself.She leaps.Her fingers scrabble at the balcony rim, then slip.She crashes back, slamming across the lower railing.Her ribs explode with pain as she flips over and smashes into potted jasmine vines.Another blossom of pain flares in her elbow.She lies whimpering amongst shattered pottery and night jasmine perfume.Blood gleams black on her hands.She can't stop whimpering.Her whole body is shaking.She's burning up with the exertion of climbing and jumping.She pushes herself up awkwardly, cradling her damaged arm, expecting people to come charging out at her, but the apartment beyond the gate remains dark.Emiko staggers to her feet and leans against the balcony rail, looking up at her goal.You foolish girl.Why do you try so hard to survive?Why not just jump and die?It would be so much simpler.She peers down into the black alley below.She doesn't have an answer.It is something in her genetics, as deeply ingrained as her urge to please.She hauls herself up again onto the railing, balancing awkwardly, cradling her throbbing arm.She looks upward, praying to Mizuko Jizo the windup bodhisattva to give her mercy.She jumps, reaching one handed for salvation.Her fingers catch then slip away.Emiko lashes out with her bad hand and catches hold.Her elbow's ligaments tear away.She yelps as the bones separate, then crack wide.Sobbing, breath sawing in and out of her throat, she scrabbles for the railing with her good hand.Seizes a handhold.She lets her broken arm fall and hang limp.Emiko dangles one handed, high above the street.Her arm is nothing but flame.She whimpers quietly, preparing to wound herself once again.She lets out a ragged sob and then reaches up once again with her ruined arm.Her hand closes on the railing.Please.Please.Just a little more.She lets her weight settle onto the arm.White pain.Emiko's breath saws ragged in her throat.She hauls a leg up, feeling with her foot, scrabbling for a toehold, finally it hooks on the iron.She pulls herself up, teeth gritted, sobbing, refusing to let go.Only a bit more.The barrel of a spring gun presses against her forehead.Emiko opens her eyes.A young girl grips the pistol in trembling hands.She stares at Emiko, terror stricken."You were right," she whispers.An old Chinese man looms behind her, his expression shadowed.They peer over the balcony precipice, watching Emiko as she dangles.Emiko's hands begin to slip.The pain is almost unbearable now."Please," Emiko whispers."Help me. "45  The gas lights in Akkarat's operations center gutter out.Anderson straightens in the sudden darkness, surprised.The fighting has been desultory for some time, but all across the city it is the same.Krung Thep's gas lamps are winking out, green points of light smothered down the thoroughfares, one by one.A few zones of conflict still flicker yellow and orange with burning WeatherAll, but all the green is gone from the city.A black blanket covers it, almost as complete as that of the ocean beyond the levees."What's happening?"Anderson asks.The dim glow of computer monitors is all that still lights the room.Akkarat comes back inside from the balcony.The operations room buzzes with activity.Emergency hand cranked lantern LEDs come to life, spattering light around the room, illuminating Akkarat's smiling face."We've taken the methane works," he says."The country is ours. ""You're certain?""The anchor pads and the docks are secure.The white shirts are surrendering.We've gotten word from their commanding officer.They will be laying down their weapons and surrendering unconditionally.The word is going out over their coded radio now.A few will fight on, but we have the city now. "Anderson rubs at his broken ribs."Does that mean we can leave?"Akkarat nods."Of course.I will detail men to escort you back to your homes in just a little while.The streets will still take a bit of time to settle. "He smiles."I think you will be very happy with the new management of our Kingdom. "A few hours later they're being ushered into an elevator.They plunge to street level and find Akkarat's personal limousine waiting.Outside, the sky is just starting to lighten.Carlyle stops on the verge of climbing into the car, staring down the thoroughfare to where the yellow edge of dawn is thickening."Now that's something I wasn't expecting to see. ""I thought we were dead. ""You seemed cool enough. "Anderson shrugs gingerly."Finland was worse. "But as he climbs into the car, he has another coughing fit.It goes on for half a minute, wracking him.He wipes blood off his lips as Carlyle stares  "Are you all right?"Carlyle asks.Anderson nods as he gingerly pulls the door closed."I think I'm busted up inside.Akkarat used a pistol on my ribs. "Carlyle studies him."You sure you haven't caught something?""Are you kidding?"Anderson laughs, which makes his ribs hurt."I work for AgriGen.I'm inoculated against diseases that haven't even been released yet. "The car accelerates away from the curb with an escort of kink spring scooters swarming around the coal diesel limo.Anderson settles himself more comfortably in his seat, watching as the city slides past beyond the glass.Carlyle taps a leather armrest thoughtfully."I'll have to get me one of these.Once the trade starts flowing, I'm going to have a lot of money to spend. "Anderson nods, distracted."We're going to need to start shipping calories right away.Famine relief.I want to commission your dirigibles immediately, as a stopgap.We'll bring U Tex in from India.Give Akkarat something to crow about.Benefits of open markets, all that.Lots of good press from the whisper sheets.Get things cemented. ""You can't just enjoy the moment?"Carlyle laughs."It's not often you escape a black hood, Anderson.The first thing we do is go find some whiskey and a rooftop, and watch the damn sun rise over the country we just bought.That's what we do first.The rest of the crap will all wait for tomorrow. "The limousine makes a turn onto Phraram I Road and their escort forges ahead of them, hurtling across the rapidly lightening city.They come down off a flyway and detour around a rubbled Expansion tower that has been entirely toppled in the fighting.A few people are scavenging in the wreckage, but no one is armed."It's over," Anderson murmurs."Just like that. "He feels tired.A pair of white shirt bodies lie half off the curb, rag doll limp.A vulture stands beside them, edging closer.Anderson touches his ribs gingerly, suddenly glad to be alive."You know someplace we can buy that whiskey?"46  The old Chinese man and the young girl crouch away from her, watching carefully as she guzzles water.Emiko was surprised when the old man allowed the girl to help her crawl over the balcony's edge.But now that she is safe, he keeps his spring gun trained on her and Emiko understands that he is not motivated by charity."Did you really kill them?"he asks.Emiko gingerly lifts her glass and drinks again.If she didn't hurt so much, she could almost enjoy the fact that they are afraid of her.With water, she feels vastly improved, even with her right arm lying limp and swollen in her lap.She sets the glass on the floor and cradles her wounded elbow close.She breathes shallowly through the pain."Did you?"he asks again.She shrugs slightly."I was fast.They were slow. "They are speaking Mandarin, a language she hasn't used since her time with Gendo sama.English, Thai, French, Mandarin Chinese, accounting, political protocol, catering and hospitality So many skills she doesn't use anymore.It took a few minutes for her memories of the language to surface but then it was there, like a limb that had atrophied from long neglect, and then miraculously turned out to be strong.She wonders if her broken arm will heal as easily, if her body still holds surprises for her."You are the yellow card secretary from the factory," she says."Hock Seng, yes?Anderson sama told me that you ran away when the whites shirts came. "The old man shrugs."I came back. ""Why?"He grins without humor."We cling to whatever flotsam we have. "Outside, an explosion rumbles.They all look toward the sound."I think it's ending," the girl murmurs."That's the first one in more than an hour. "Emiko thinks that with the two of them distracted, she could probably kill them both, even with her shattered arm.But she is so tired.Tired of destruction.Tired of slaughter.Beyond the balcony, the city smokes against a lightening sky.An entire city torn to ribbons over what?A windup girl who couldn't keep her place.Emiko closes her eyes against the shame of it.She can almost see Mizumi sensei frowning disapproval.She's surprised that the woman still holds any power over her at all.Perhaps she will never be free of her old teacher.Mizumi is as much a part of her as her wretched pore structure."You want to collect the reward for me?"she asks."Wish to profit from catching a killer?""The Thais want you very badly. "The apartment's locks rattle.They all look up as Anderson sama and another gaijin stumble through the door.Dark bruises decorate the foreigners' faces, but they're laughing and smiling.They both stop short.Anderson sama's eyes flick from Emiko to the old man, to the pistol that now points at him."Hock Seng?"The other gaijin backpedals and slips behind Anderson sama."What the hell?""Good question. "Anderson sama is studying the scene before him, pale blue eyes evaluating.The girl Mai makes a reflexive wai to the gaijin.Emiko almost smiles in recognition.She too knows that knee jerk urge to show respect."What are you doing here, Hock Seng?"Anderson sama asks.Hock Seng gives him a thin smile."You aren't pleased to capture the killer of the Somdet Chaopraya?"Anderson sama doesn't respond, just looks from Hock Seng to Emiko and back again.Finally he asks, "How did you get in here?"Hock Seng shrugs."I did, after all, find this flat for Mr.Yates.Presented the keys to him myself. "Anderson sama shakes his head."He was a fool, wasn't he?"Hock Seng inclines his head.With a chill, Emiko sees that this confrontation can only turn against her.The only person here who is disposable is herself.If she is quick, she can simply strip the pistol from the old man's hand.Just as she took the pistols from those slow bodyguards.It will hurt, but it can be done.The old man is no match for her.The other gaijin is slipping out the door without another word, but Emiko is surprised to see Anderson sama does not retreat as well.Instead, he eases into the room, hands held up, palms out.One of his hands is bandaged.His voice is soothing."What do you want, Hock Seng?"Hock Seng backs away, keeping space between himself and the gaijin."Nothing. "Hock Seng shrugs slightly."The killer of the Somdet Chaopraya, righteously punished.That is all. "Anderson sama laughs."Nice. "He turns and settles carefully into a couch.Grunts and winces as he leans back.Smiles again."Now, what do you really want?"The old man's lips quirk, sharing the joke."What I've always wanted.A future. "Anderson sama nods thoughtfully."You think this girl will help you get that?Get you a nice reward?""The capture of a royal assassin will surely earn me enough to rebuild my family. "Anderson sama doesn't say anything, just stares at Hock Seng with his cold blue eyes.His gaze turns to Emiko."Did you kill him?Really?"A part of her wants to lie.She can see in his eyes that he wants that lie as well, but she can't force the words out."I am sorry, Anderson sama. ""And all the bodyguards, too?""They hurt me. "He shakes his head."I didn't believe it.I was sure Akkarat set it all up.But then you jumped off the balcony. "His unsettling blue eyes continue to watch her."Are you trained to kill?""No!"She recoils, shocked at the suggestion.Rushes to explain."I did not know.They hurt me.I was angry.I didn't know " She has an overwhelming urge to kowtow before him.To try to convince him of her loyalty.She fights the instinct, recognizing her own genetic need to roll over on her back and bare her belly."So you're not an assassin, trained?"he asks."A military windup?""No.Not military.Please.Believe me. ""But still dangerous.You tore the Somdet Chaopraya's head off with your bare hands. "Emiko wants to protest, to say that she is not that creature, that it was not her, but the words won't come out.All she can do is whisper, "I did not take off his head. ""You could kill us all if you wanted, though.Before we even knew you were coming.Before Hock Seng could even lift his pistol. "At these words, Hock Seng whips his spring gun back to point at her.Pathetically slow.Emiko shakes her head."I do not wish it," she says."I only wish to leave.To go north.That is all. ""But still, you're a dangerous creature," Anderson sama says."Dangerous to me.To other people.If anyone saw me with you, now. "He shakes his head and grimaces."You're worth far more dead than alive. "Emiko readies herself, prepares for the excruciating pain that will come.First the Chinese, then Anderson sama.Maybe not the little girl   "I'm sorry, Hock Seng," Anderson sama says abruptly."You can't have her. "Emiko stares at the gaijin, shocked.The Chinese laughs."You will stop me?"Anderson sama shakes his head."Times are changing, Hock Seng.My people are coming.In force.All our fortunes will be changing.It won't just be the factory anymore.It'll be calorie contracts, freight shipping, R &D centers, trade negotiations Starting today, everything changes. ""And this rising tide will raise my ship as well?"Anderson sama laughs, then winces, touching his ribs."More than ever, Hock Seng.We'll need people like you more than ever. "The old man looks from Anderson sama to Emiko."What about Mai?"Anderson sama coughs."Stop worrying about small things, Hock Seng.You're going to have an almost unlimited expense account.Hire her.Marry her.I don't care.Do what you like.Hell, I'm sure Carlyle would find a place for her too, if you don't want her on your own payroll. "He leans back and shouts out into the hall."I know you're still out there, you coward.Get in here. "The gaijin Carlyle's voice calls in."You're really going to protect that windup?"He peers around the corner, cautious.Anderson sama shrugs."Without her, we wouldn't even have had an excuse for the coup. "He gives her a crooked smile."That must be worth something. "He looks again at Hock Seng."Well?What do you think?""You swear this?"the old man asks."If we break faith, you can always report her later.She's not going anywhere soon.Not with everyone on the lookout for a windup assassin.We all benefit, every one of us, if we come to agreement.Come on, Hock Seng.This is an easy call.Everyone wins, for once. "Hock Seng hesitates, then gives a sharp nod and lowers his gun.Emiko feels a sudden flood of relief.Anderson smiles.He turns his attention to her and his expression softens."Many things will be changing now.But we can't let anyone see you.There are too many people who will never forgive.You understand?""Yes.I will not be seen. ""Good.Once things calm down, we'll see about getting you out of here.For the moment, you'll stay here.We'll splint up that arm.I'll get someone to bring in a case of ice.Would you like that?"The relief is almost overwhelming."Yes.Thank you.You are kind. "Anderson sama smiles."Where's that whiskey, Carlyle?We need a toast. "He gets up, wincing, and comes back with an array of glasses and a bottle.As he sets the glassware down on a small end table, he coughs."Goddamn Akkarat," he mutters, and then he coughs again, a deep hoarse sound.Suddenly he doubles over.Another cough wracks him and then more follow in a wet rattling series.Anderson sama puts out a hand to steady himself but instead jostles the table.Tips it.Emiko watches as the glasses and whiskey bottle slide toward the edge of the table, spill off.They fall very slowly, glinting in the light of the rising sun.They're very pretty, she thinks.So clean and bright.They shatter across the floor.Anderson sama's coughing spasm continues.He collapses to his knees amongst the shards.He tries to get up, but another spasm seizes him.He curls over on his side.When the coughing finally releases him, he looks toward Emiko, blue eyes staring out from sunken hollows."Akkarat really cracked me up," he rasps.Hock Seng and Mai are backing away.Carlyle has an arm over his mouth, frightened eyes peering over the crook of an elbow."It's like the factory," Mai murmurs.Emiko crouches down beside the gaijin.He suddenly seems small and frail.He reaches for her, clumsy, and she takes his hand.Blood spackles his lips.47  The formal surrender occurs on the open parade grounds before the Grand Palace.Akkarat is there to greet Kanya and accept her khrab of submission.Already AgriGen ships are in the docks, unloading U Tex rice and SoyPRO onto the docks.The sterile seeds of the grain monopolies some to feed people now, some to go to Thai farmers in the next planting cycle.From where she stands in the parade grounds, Kanya can see the corporate sails with their red wheat crest logos billowing above the levee rim.There was a rumor that the young Queen would oversee the ceremony and cement the new government under Akkarat, and so the throngs are larger than would be expected.But at the last moment, word came that she would not, after all, attend, and so they all stand in the heat of the dry season that has gone on too long already, sweating and sweltering as Akkarat steps up on a dais while monks chant.He swears oaths as the new Somdet Chaopraya to protect the Kingdom in this unsettled state of military law, then he turns and faces the army and civilians and remaining white shirts under Kanya, all arrayed before him.Sweat trickles down Kanya's temples but she refuses to move.Even though she surrendered the Environment Ministry into Akkarat's hands, still she wishes to present it in the best, most disciplined light, and so she remains at attention, sweating, with Pai in the front rank beside her, his face schooled into careful immobility.She catches sight of Narong standing a little behind Akkarat, watching the proceedings.He inclines his head to her and it is all she can do not to scream at him, to shriek that all of this destruction is his fault.Wanton and pointless and avoidable.Kanya grits her teeth and sweats and drills her hatred into Narong's forehead.It's stupid.The one she hates is herself.She will formally surrender the last of her good men and women to Akkarat and see the white shirts disbanded.Jaidee stands beside her, watching thoughtfully."You have something you want to say?"Kanya mutters.Jaidee shrugs."They took the rest of my family.In the fighting. "Kanya sucks in her breath."I am sorry. "She wishes she could reach out.Touch him.Jaidee smiles sadly."It is war.I always tried to explain that to you. "She wants to answer but Akkarat beckons for her.Now is the time for her abasement.She hates the man so.How is it that her youthful rage can be so undone?She swore as a child she would destroy the white shirts, and yet now her victory has the reek of the Ministry's burning grounds.Kanya climbs the steps and performs her khrab.Akkarat allows her to remain prostrate for a long time.Above her, she can hear him speaking."It is natural to grieve a man such as General Pracha," he says to the multitudes."Though he was not loyal, he was passionate, and for that, if nothing else, we owe him a measure of respect.His last days were not his only days.He labored on behalf of the Kingdom for many years.He worked to preserve our people in times of great uncertainty.I will never speak against his good work, even if, at the end, he went astray. "He pauses, then says, "We, as a Kingdom, must heal. "He looks down at them all."In the spirit of good will, I am very happy to announce that the Queen has accepted my request that all the combatants who fought on behalf of General Pracha and his coup attempt are granted amnesty.Unconditionally.For those of you who still wish to work at the Environment Ministry, I hope that you will continue to work there with pride.We face all manner of hardships, and we cannot know what our future holds. "He motions to Kanya to stand and walks across to her."Captain Kanya, though you fought against the Kingdom and the palace, I grant you both a pardon and something more. "He pauses."We must reconcile.We, as a kingdom and nation, must reconcile.Must reach across to one another. "Kanya's stomach tightens, she feels sick with disgust at the whole proceeding.Akkarat says, "As you are the highest ranking member of the Environment Ministry, I now appoint you to its head.Your duty is as it was.Protect the Kingdom and Her Royal Majesty the Queen. "Kanya stares at Akkarat.Behind him, Narong is smiling slightly.He inclines his head, showing respect.Kanya is speechless.She wais, deeply shocked.Akkarat smiles."You may dismiss your men, General.Tomorrow we must once again rebuild. "Still speechless, she wais again, then turns.Her first attempt at an order comes out as a croak.She swallows and give the order again, her voice cracking.Faces, as surprised and uncertain as her own feels, stare at up at her.For a moment, she fears that they know her for a fraud, that they will not obey.Then ranks of white shirts turn as one.They march away, uniforms flashing in the sunlight.Jaidee marches with them.But before he does, he wais to her as if she truly is a general, and this hurts more than anything that has come before.48  "They're leaving.It's done. "Anderson lets his head fall back on the pillow."We've won then. "Emiko doesn't respond; she's still looking out toward the distant parade grounds.Morning light burns through the window.He is shivering.Freezing and grateful for the onslaught of sun.Sweat pours off of him.Emiko lays a hand on his forehead and he's surprised to feel that it is cool.He looks up at her through his haze of fever and sickness."Is Hock Seng here yet?"She shakes her head sadly."Your people are not loyal. "Anderson almost laughs at that.He pushes ineffectually at his blankets.Emiko helps him strip them away."No.They're not. "He turns his face to the sun again, soaking it up, allowing it to bathe him."But I knew that. "He would laugh more, if he weren't so tired.If his body didn't feel as if it was breaking apart."Do you want more water?"she asks.The thought doesn't appeal.He's not thirsty.Last night, he was thirsty.When the doctor came at Akkarat's order he could have drunk the ocean, but now, he is not.After examining him, the doctor went way, fear in his eyes, saying that he would send people.That the Environment Ministry would have to be notified.That white shirts would come to work some black containment magic upon him.All that time Emiko hid, and after the doctor went away, she waited with Anderson through the days and nights.At least, he remembers her in fractured moments.He dreamed.Hallucinated.Yates sat with him for a time on his bed.Laughed at him.Pointed out the futility of his life.Peered into his eyes and asked him if he understood.And Anderson tried to answer but his throat was parched.No words could force their way out.And Yates laughed at that as well, and asked him what he thought of the newly arrived AgriGen Trade Representative coming to take his niche.If Anderson liked being replaced any better than he had.And then Emiko was there with a cool cloth and he was grateful, desperately grateful for any sort of attention, for her human connection and he had laughed weakly at the irony.Now he looks at Emiko through bleary vision and thinks about debts he owes, and wonders if he will live long enough to pay them."We're going to get you out," he whispers.A new wave of shivering takes him.All through the night, he was hot, and now, abruptly he is cold, shaking with the freezing feel, as if he has returned to the Upper Midwest and freezes in those still cold winters, as if he looks out at snow.Now he is cold, and not thirsty at all, and even a windup girl's fingers feel icy against his face.He pushes weakly at her hand."Is Hock Seng here yet?""You're burning up. "Emiko's face is full of concern."Has he come?"Anderson asks.It is intensely important that the man come.That Hock Seng be here, in the room with him.Though he can barely remember why.It is important."I think he will not come. "she says."He has all the letters he needed from you.The introductions.He is already busy with your people.With the new representative.The Boudry woman. "A cheshire appears on the balcony.It yowls low and slips inside.Emiko doesn't seem to notice or care, but then, she and it are siblings.Sympathetic creatures, manufactured by the same flawed gods.Anderson watches dully as the cat makes its way across his bedroom and molts through the door.If he weren't so weak, he would throw something at it.He sighs.He's past that, now.Too tired to complain about a cat.He lets his gaze roll up to the ceiling and the slow whirl of the crank fan.He wants to still be angry.But even that has gone.At first, when he discovered that he was sick, when Hock Seng and the girl had pulled back, alarmed, he had thought they were crazy.That he hadn't been exposed to any vectors, but then, looking at them, at their fear and certainty, he had understood."The factory?"he'd whispered, repeating the girl Mai's words, and Hock Seng had nodded, keeping his hand over his face."The fining rooms, or the algae baths," he murmured.Anderson had wanted to be angry then, but the sickness was already sapping his strength.All he could summon was a dull rage that quickly burned away."Has anyone survived?""One," the girl had whispered.And he had nodded, and they had slunk away.Hock Seng.Always with his secrets.Always with his angles and his planning.Always waiting  "Is he coming?"He has a hard time forcing the words out."He will not come," Emiko murmurs."You're here. "She shrugs."I am New People.Your sicknesses do not frighten me.That one will not come.Not the Carlyle man either. ""At least they're leaving you alone.Kept their word, there. ""Maybe," she says, but she lacks conviction.Anderson wonders if she's right.Wonders if he is wrong about Hock Seng as he was wrong about so many things.Wonders if his every understanding of the place was wrong.He forces away the fear."He'll keep faith.He's a businessman. "Emiko doesn't answer.The cheshire jumps onto the bed.She shoos it away, but it jumps up again, seemingly sensing the carrion opportunity he represents.Anderson tries to raise a hand."No," he croaks."Let it stay. "49  AgriGen people march off the docks.Kanya and her men stand at attention, an honor guard for demons.The farang all stand and squint at the tropic sun, taking in the land they have never before seen.They point rudely at young girls walking down the street, talk and laugh loudly.They are an uncouth race.So confident."They're very self satisfied," Pai mutters.Kanya startles at hearing her own thoughts voiced aloud, but doesn't respond.Simply waits while Akkarat meets these new creatures.A blond, scowling woman called Elizabeth Boudry is at their head, an AgriGen creature through and through.She has a long sweeping black cloak as do others of the AgriGen people, all of them with their red wheat crest logos shining in the sun.The only satisfying thing about seeing these people in their hated uniforms is that the tropic heat must be awful for them.Their faces shine with sweat.Akkarat says to Kanya."These are the ones who will be going to the seedbank. ""Are you sure about this?"she asks.He shrugs."They only want samples.Genetic diversity for their generipping.The Kingdom will benefit as well. "Kanya studies the people who used to be called calorie demons and who now walk so brazenly in Krung Thep, the City of Divine Beings.Crates of grain are coming off the ship and being stacked on megodont wagons, the AgriGen logo prominent on every one.Seeming to sense her thoughts, Akkarat says, "We've passed the time when we can hide behind our walls and hope to survive.We must engage with this outside world. ""But the seedbank," Kanya protests quietly."King Rama's legacy. "Akkarat nods shortly."They will only be taking samples.Do not concern yourself. "He turns to another farang and shakes hands with him in the foreign style.Speaks with him using the Angrit language and sends him on his way."Richard Carlyle," Akkarat comments as he returns to Kanya's side."We'll have our pumps, finally.He's sending out a dirigible this afternoon.With luck we'll beat the rainy season. "He looks at her significantly."You understand all this?You understand what I'm doing here?It is better to lose a little of the Kingdom than everything.There are times to fight and times to negotiate.We cannot survive if we are entirely isolated.History tells us we must engage with the outside world. "Kanya nods stiffly.Jaidee leans over her shoulder."At least they never got Gi Bu Sen. ""I would rather give them Gi Bu Sen than the seedbank," Kanya mutters."Yes, but I think that losing the man was even more irritating to them. "He nods at the Boudry woman."She was quite enraged.Shouted, even.Lost all her face.Paced back and forth waving her arms. "He demonstrates.Kanya grimaces."Akkarat was angry, too.He was after me all day, demanding to know how we could have allowed the old man to escape. ""A clever man, that one. "Kanya laughs."Akkarat?""The generipper. "Before Kanya can plumb more of Jaidee's thoughts, the Boudry woman and her seed scientists approach.An ancient yellow card Chinese man approaches with her.He stands ramrod straight, nods to Kanya."I will be translating for Khun Elizabeth Boudry. "Kanya makes herself smile politely as she studies the people before her.This is what it comes to.Yellow cards and farang."Everything is change. "Jaidee sighs."It would be good for you to remember it.Clinging to the past, worrying about the future" He shrugs."It's all suffering. "The farang are waiting for her.Impatient.She guides them down into the war damaged streets.Somewhere in the distance, off near the anchor pads, a tank booms.Perhaps a cell of holdout students, people not under her control.People beholden to different sorts of honor than she.She waves to two of her new underlings, Malivalaya and Yuthakon, if she remembers correctly."General," one of them starts, but Kanya scowls at him."I told you, no more generals.No more of that nonsense.I am a captain.If captain was good enough for Jaidee, then I won't name myself higher. "Malivalaya wais apology.Kanya orders the farang into the comfort of the coal diesel car, and then they are whispering through the streets.It is a luxury that she has never experienced, but she forces herself not to exclaim at Akkarat's suddenly exposed wealth.The car slides through the empty streets, making its way toward the City Pillar Shrine.Fifteen minutes later, they emerge from the car into burning sun.Monks lower their heads in courtesy to her, acknowledging her authority.She nods back, feeling sick.In this, King Rama XII placed the Environment Ministry above even monks.The monks throw open gates and lead her and the rest of the entourage down below, down into the cool deeps.Airtight doors swing up, filtered air under negative pressure wafts out.Perfectly humid air, chilly.She forces herself not to clutch her arms to her as the cool increases.More vault doors open, revealing interior corridors, powered by coal burning systems, triple fail safed.Monks in saffron wait politely, stepping away from her to ensure that she doesn't come in contact with them.She turns to the Boudry woman."Don't touch the monks.They have taken vows not to touch women. "The yellow card translates into the farang's squawking language.Kanya hears a snort of laughter behind her but forces herself not to react.The Boudry woman and her generipper scientists all chatter excitedly as they work their way deeper into the seedbank.The yellow card translator doesn't bother to explain their weird exclamations, but Kanya can guess most of it from the delighted expressions.She leads them deeper into the vaults, to the cataloging rooms, all the time thinking on the nature of loyalty.Better to give up a limb than to give up the head.The Kingdom survives when other countries fall because of Thai practicality.Kanya glances back at the farang.Their greedy pale eyes scan the shelves, the vacuum sealed containers of thousands of seeds, each one a potential line of defense against their kind.The true treasure of a kingdom, laid out before them.The spoils of war.When the Burmese toppled Ayutthaya, the city fell without a fight.And now, again, it is the same.In the end, after all the blood and sweat and deaths and toil, after the struggles of seed saints and martyrs like Phra Seub, after the sale of girls like Kip to Gi Bu Sen and all the rest, it comes down to this.Farang standing triumphant at the heart of a kingdom betrayed once again by ministers uncaring for the crown."Don't take it so badly. "Jaidee touches her on her shoulder."We all must come to terms with our failures, Kanya. ""I am sorry.For everything. ""I forgave you a long time ago.We all have our patrons and our loyalties.It was kamma that brought you to Akkarat before you came to me. ""I never thought it would come to this. ""It is a great loss. "Jaidee agrees.Then he shrugs."But even now, it doesn't have to be this way. "Kanya glances over at the farang.One of the scientists catches her eye, says something to the woman.Kanya can't tell if it is mocking or thoughtful.Their wheat crest logos gleam in the flicker of electric lighting.Jaidee raises an eyebrow."There is always Her Majesty the Queen, yes?""And what can that accomplish?""Would you not prefer to be remembered as a villager of Bang Rajan who fought when all was lost, and held the Burmese at bay for a little while, than as one of the cowardly courtiers of Ayutthaya who sacrificed a kingdom?""It's all ego," Kanya mutters."Maybe. "Jaidee shrugs."But I'll tell you true: Ayutthaya was nothing in our history.Did the Thai not survive the sack of it?Have we not survived the Burmese?The Khmers?The French?The Japanese?The Americans?The Chinese?The calorie companies?Have we not held them all at bay when others fell?It is our people who carry the lifeblood of this country, not this city.Our people carry the names that the Chakri gave us, and it is our people who are everything.And it is this seedbank that sustains us. ""But His Majesty declared that we would always defend "  "King Rama did not care an ounce for Krung Thep; he cared for us, and so he made a symbol for us to protect.But it is not the city, it is the people that matter.What good is a city if the people are enslaved?"Kanya's breathing has become rapid.Icy air saws in and out of her lungs.The Boudry woman says something.The generippers yawp in their awful tongue.Kanya turns to Pai."Follow my lead. "She draws her spring gun and fires it point blank into the farang woman's head.50  Elizabeth Boudry's head jerks back.Blood sprays Hock Seng in fine mist, spattering his skin and newly tailored clothes.The white shirt general turns and Hock Seng immediately drops to his knees, making a khrab of obeisance beside the collapsed body of the foreign devil.The blond creature's surprised dead eyes stare out at him as he prostrates himself.Spring gun disks chatter across the walls, people are screaming.Suddenly there is silence.The white shirt general yanks him to his feet and shoves her spring gun into his face."Please," Hock Seng whispers in Thai."I am not their kind. "The general's hard eyes study him.She nods sharply, and shoves him aside.He huddles against a wall as she begins barking orders to her men.They quickly drag the AgriGen bodies aside, then coalesce around her.Hock Seng is surprised at how quickly the unsmiling woman musters her troops.She goes to the monks of the seedbank.Makes her own khrab of respect and begins speaking quickly.Even though she performs a khrab to their spiritual authority, there can be no doubt that she is the one who is the master of the place.Hock Seng's eyes widen as he hears what she is planning.It's terrifying.An act of destruction that cannot be allowed and yet, the monks are nodding and now people are streaming out of the seedbank, all of them working quickly.The general and her men begin throwing open doors, revealing rack after rack of weaponry.She begins assigning teams: the Grand Palace, Korakot Pump, Khlong Toey Seawall Lock  The general spares a glance at Hock Seng as she finishes dispatching her people.The monks are already taking seeds down from the shelves.Hock Seng cringes at her attention.After what he has heard, she cannot intend to let him live.The bustle of activity increases.More and more monks stream in.They stack the seeds cases carefully.Rank after rank of seeds coming down from the shelves.Seeds from more than a hundred years ago, seeds that every so often are cultured in the strictest of isolation chambers and then carried back to this underground safe, to be stored again.The heritage of millennia in the boxes, the heritage of the world.And then the monks are streaming out of the seedbank, carrying the boxes on their shoulders, a river of shaven headed men in saffron robes, bearing forth their nation's treasure.Hock Seng watches, breathless at the sight of so much genetic material disappearing into the wilds.Somewhere outside, he thinks he hears monks chanting, blessing this project of renewal and destruction, and then the white shirt general is looking at him again.He forces himself not to duck his head.Not to grovel.She will kill him.She must.He will not grovel and piss himself.At least he will die with dignity.The general purses her lips, then simply jerks her head toward the open doors."Run, yellow card.This city is no longer a refuge for you. "He stares at her, surprised.She jerks her head again and the shadow of a smile touches her lips.Hock Seng wais quickly and climbs off his knees.He hurries through the tunnels and out into hot open air, the river of saffron robed men all around him.Once they reach the temple grounds, the monks disperse through various gates, separating into smaller and smaller groups, a diaspora bound eventually for some pre arranged place of distant safety.A secret place, far from calorie company reach, watched over by Phra Seub and all the spirits of the nation.Hock Seng watches for a moment longer as the monks continue to pour from the seedbank, and then he runs for the street.A rickshaw man sees him and slows to a stop.Hock Seng leaps in."Where to?"the man asks.Hock Seng hesitates, thinking furiously.The anchor pads.It is the only certain way to escape the coming chaos.The yang guizi Richard Carlyle is probably still there.The man and his dirigible, preparing to fly for Kolkata to retrieve the Kingdom's coal pumps.There will be safety in the air.But only if Hock Seng is fast enough to the catch the foreign devil before he untethers the last anchor."Where to?"Mai.Hock Seng shakes his head.Why does she torment him now?He owes her nothing.She is nothing, in truth.Just some fishing girl.And yet against his better judgment he allowed her to stay with him, told her he would hire her as a servant of some sort.Would keep her safe.It was the least he could do But that was before.He was going to be flush with money from the calorie companies.It was a different sort of promise, then.She will forgive him."The anchor pads," Hock Seng says."Quickly.I don't have much time. "The rickshaw man nods and the bike accelerates.Mai.Hock Seng curses himself.He is a fool.Why does he never focus on the most important goal?Always he is distracted.Always he fails to do what would keep him alive and safe.He leans forward, angry with himself.Angry at Mai."No.Wait.I have another address.First to Krungthon Bridge, then to the anchor pads. ""That's in the opposite direction. "Hock Seng grimaces."You think I don't know it?"The rickshaw man nods and slows.He turns his bike and aims it back the way he came.He stands on his pedals, getting up to speed.The city slides past, colorful and busy with cleanup activity.A city completely unaware of its impending doom.The cycle weaves through the sunshine, shifting smoothly through its gears, faster and faster toward the girl.If he is very lucky there will be enough time.Hock Seng prays that he will be lucky.Prays that there will be enough time to collect Mai and still make the dirigible.If he were smart, he would simply run.Instead, he prays for luck.Epilogue  The destroyed locks and sabotaged pumps take six days to kill the City of Divine Beings.Emiko watches from the balcony of the finest apartment tower in Bangkok as water rushes in.Anderson sama is nothing but a husk.Emiko squeezed water into his mouth from a cloth and he sucked at it like a baby before he finally expired, whispering apologies to ghosts that only he could see.When she first heard the colossal explosions at the edge of the city, she did not guess at first what was happening, but as more explosions followed and twelve coils of smoke rose like naga along the levees it became clear that King Rama XII's great floodwater pumps had been destroyed, and that the city was once again under siege.Emiko watched the fight to save the city for three days, and then the monsoons came and the last attempts at holding back the ocean were abandoned.Rain gushed down, a vast deluge sweeping out dust and debris, sending every bit of the city swirling and rising.People swarmed from their homes with their belongings on their heads.The city slowly filled with water, becoming a vast lake lapping around second story windows.On the sixth day, her Royal Majesty the Child Queen announces the abandonment of the divine city.There is no Somdet Chaopraya now.Only the Queen, and the people rally to her.The white shirts, so despised and disgraced just days before, are everywhere, guiding people north under the command of a new Tiger, a strange unsmiling woman who people say is possessed by spirits and who drives her white shirts to struggle and save as many of the people of Krung Thep as possible.Emiko herself is forced to hide as a young volunteer in a white uniform works the halls of her building offering assistance to anyone who needs food or safe water.Even as the city dies, the Environment Ministry is rehabilitated.Slowly, the city empties.The lap of seawater and the yowl of cheshires replace the call of durian sellers and the ring of bicycle bells.At times, Emiko suspects that she is the only person living.When she cranks a radio she hears that the capital has decamped north to Ayutthaya, once again above sea level.She hears that Akkarat has shaven his head and become a monk to atone for his failure to protect the city.But it is all distant.With the wet season, Emiko's life becomes bearable.The flooded metropolis means that there is always water nearby, even if it is a stagnant bathtub stinking with the refuse of millions.Emiko locates a small skiff and uses it to navigate the city's wilderness.Rain pours down daily and she lets it bathe her, washing away everything that has come before.She lives by scavenge and the hunt.She eats cheshires and catches fish with her bare hands.She is very quick.Her fingers flash down to spear a carp whenever she desires it.She eats well and sleeps easily, and with water all around, she does not so greatly fear the heat that burns within her.If it is not the place for New People that she once imagined, it is still a niche.She decorates her apartment.She crosses the wide mouth of the Chao Phraya to investigate the Mishimoto factory where she had once been employed.It is shuttered, but she finds remnants of her past and collects some of them.Calligraphy torn and left behind, Raku chawan bowls.A few times, she encounters people.Most of them are too occupied with their own problems of survival to bother with a tick tock creature more glimpsed than seen, but there are a few who prey on a lone girl's perceived weakness.Emiko deals with them quickly, and with as much mercy as she knows how.The days pass.She becomes comfortable entirely in her world of water and scavenge.She is so comfortable, in fact, that when the gaijin and the girl find her, scrubbing her laundry from atop a second floor apartment rail, they surprise her utterly."And who is this?"a voice asks.Emiko draws back, startled, and nearly falls from where she perches.She jumps down and darts splashing into the safety of the abandoned apartment's shadows.The gaijin's boat bumps up against the rail."Sawatdi khrap?"he calls."Hello?"He's old, mottled skin and bright intelligent eyes.The girl is lithe and brown with a soft smile.They both lean against the balcony railing, peering into the dimness from their boat."Don't run away little thing," the old man says."We are quite harmless.I can't walk at all, and Kip here is a gentle soul. "Emiko waits.They don't give up, though.Just continue to peer in at her."Please?"the girl calls.Against her better judgment, Emiko steps out, wading carefully in the ankle deep water.It has been a long time since she has spoken with a person."Heechy keechy," the girl breathes.The old gaijin smiles at the words."New People, they call themselves. "His eyes contain no judgment.He holds up a limp pair of cheshires."Would you like to dine with us, young lady?"Emiko motions toward the balcony rail where she has tethered her own day's catch just under water."I do not need your help. "The man looks down at the string of fish, then up at her with new respect."I suppose you don't.Not if your design is the one I know. "He invites her closer."You live near here?"She points upstairs."Lovely real estate.Perhaps we could dine with you this evening.If cheshire is not to your taste, we would certainly enjoy a bite of fish. "Emiko shrugs, but she is lonely and the man and girl seem harmless.As night falls, they light a fire of kindled furniture on her apartment's balcony and roast the fish.Stars show through gaps in the clouds.The city stretches before them, black and tangled.When they are finished eating, the old gaijin drags his wounded body closer to the fire while the girl attends him."Tell me, what is a windup girl doing here?"Emiko shrugs."I was left behind. ""Ourselves, as well. "The old man exchanges smiles with his friend."Though I think our vacation will be ending soon.It seems we are to return to the pleasures of calorie detente and genetic warfare, so I think that the white shirts will once again have uses for me. "He laughs at that."Are you a generipper?"Emiko asks."More than just that, I hope. ""You said you know about my platform?"The man smiles.He beckons his girl over to him and runs his hand idly up her leg as he studies Emiko.Emiko realizes that the girl is not entirely what she seems; she is boy and girl, together.The girl smiles at Emiko, seeming to sense her thoughts."I have read about your kind," the old man says."About your genetics.Your training  "Stand up!"he barks.Emiko is standing before she knows it.Standing and shaking with fear and the urge to obey.The man shakes his head."It's a hard thing they have done to you. "Emiko blazes with anger."They also made me strong.I can hurt you. ""Yes.That's true. "He nods."They took shortcuts.Your training masks that, but the shortcuts are there.Your obedience I don't know where they got that.A Labrador of some sort, I suspect. "He shrugs."Still, you are better than human in almost all other ways.Faster, smarter, better eyesight, better hearing.You are obedient, but you don't catch diseases like mine. "He waves at his scarred and oozing legs."You're lucky enough. "Emiko stares at him."You are one of the scientists who made me. ""Not the same, but close enough. "He smiles slightly."I know your secrets, just as I know the secrets of megodonts and TotalNutrient wheat. "He nods at his dead cheshires."I know everything about these felines here.If I cared enough, I might even be able to drop a genetic bomb in them that would strip away their camouflage and over the course of generations turn them back into their less successful version. ""You would do this?"He laughs and shakes his head."I like them better this way. ""I hate your kind. ""Because someone like me made you?"He laughs again."I'm surprised you aren't more pleased to meet me.You're as close as anyone ever comes to meeting God.Come now, don't you have any questions for God?"Emiko scowls at him, nods at the cheshires."If you were my God, you would have made New People first. "The old gaijin laughs."That would have been exciting. ""We would have beaten you.Just like the cheshires. ""You may yet. "He shrugs."You do not fear cibiscosis or blister rust. ""No. "Emiko shakes her head."We cannot breed.We depend on you for that. "She moves her hand.Telltale stutter stop motion."I am marked.Always, we are marked.As obvious as a ten hands or a megodont. "He waves a hand dismissively."The windup movement is not a required trait.There is no reason it couldn't be removed.Sterility" He shrugs."Limitations can be stripped away.The safeties are there because of lessons learned, but they are not required; some of them even make it more difficult to create you.Nothing about you is inevitable. "He smiles."Someday, perhaps, all people will be New People and you will look back on us as we now look back at the poor Neanderthals. "Emiko falls silent.The fire crackles.Finally she says, "You know how to do this?Can make me breed true, like the cheshires?"The old man exchanges a glance with his ladyboy."Can you do it?"Emiko presses.He sighs."I cannot change the mechanics of what you already are.Your ovaries are non existent.You cannot be made fertile any more than the pores of your skin supplemented. "Emiko slumps.The man laughs."Don't look so glum!I was never much enamored with a woman's eggs as a source of genetic material anyway. "He smiles."A strand of your hair would do.You cannot be changed, but your children in genetic terms, if not physical ones they can be made fertile, a part of the natural world. "Emiko feels her heart pounding."You can do this, truly?""Oh yes.I can do that for you. "The man's eyes are far away, considering.A smile flickers across his lips."I can do that for you, and much, much more. "
