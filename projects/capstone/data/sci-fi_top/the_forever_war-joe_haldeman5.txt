Marygay and I were the only ones in shells; my presence wasnt really vital since the flooding and emptying could be done by Control.But it was safer to have redundancy in the system and besides, I wanted to be there.It wasnt nearly as bad as the normal routine; none of the crushing bloating sensation.You were just suddenly filled with the plastic smelling stuff (you never perceived the first moments, when it rushed in to replace the air in your lungs), and then there was a slight acceleration, and then you were breathing air again, waiting for the shell to pop; then unplugging and unzipping and climbing out    Marygays shell was empty.I walked over to it and saw blood.She hemorrhaged.Doc Wilsons voice echoed sepulchrally.I turned, eyes stinging, and saw him leaning in the door to the locker alcove.He was unaccountably, horribly, smiling.Which was expected.Doctor Harmonys taking care of it.Shell be just fine.6  Marygay was walking in another week, Confraternizing in two, and pronounced completely healed in six.Ten long months in space and it was army, army, army all the way.Calisthenics, meaningless work details, compulsory lectures  there was even talk that they were going to reinstate the sleeping roster wed had in basic, but they never did, probably out of fear of mutiny.A random partner every night wouldnt have set too well with those of us whod established more or less permanent pairs.All this crap, this insistence on military discipline, bothered me mainly because I was afraid it meant they werent going to let us out.Marygay said I was being paranoid; they only did it because there was no other way to maintain order for ten months.Most of the talk, besides the usual bitching about the army, was speculation about how much Earth would have changed and what we would do when we got out.Wed be fairly rich: twenty six years salary all at once.Compound interest, too; the $500 wed been paid for our first month in the army had grown to over $1500.We arrived at Stargate in late 2023, Greenwich date.The base had grown astonishingly in the nearly seventeen years we had been on the Yod 4 campaign.It was one building the size of Tycho City, housing nearly ten thousand.There were seventy eight cruisers, the size of Anniversary or larger, involved in raids on Tauran held portal planets.Another ten guarded Stargate itself, and two were in orbit waiting for their infantry and crew to be outprocessed.One other ship, the Earths Hope II, had returned from fighting and had been waiting at Stargate for another cruiser to return.They had lost two thirds of their crew, and it was just not economical to send a cruiser back to Earth with only thirty nine people aboard.Thirty nine confirmed civilians.We went planetside in two scoutships.7  General Botsford (who had only been a full major the first time we met him, when Stargate was two huts and twenty four graves) received us in an elegantly appointed seminar room.He was pacing back and forth at the end of the room, in front of a huge holographic operations chart.You know, he said, too loud, and then, more conversationally, you know that we could disperse you into other strike forces and send you right out again.The Elite Conscription Act has been changed now, five years subjective in service instead of two.And I dont see why some of you dont want to stay in!Another couple of years and compound interest would make you independently wealthy for life.Sure, you took heavy losses  but that was inevitable, you were the first.Things are going to be easier now.The fighting suits have been improved, we know more about the Taurans tactics, our weapons are more effective  theres no need to be afraid.He sat down at the head of the table and looked at nobody in particular.My own memories of combat are over a half century old.To me it was exhilarating, strengthening.I must be a different kind of person than all of you.Or have a very selective memory, I thought.But thats neither here nor there.I have one alternative to offer you, one that doesnt involve direct combat.Were very short of qualified instructors.The Force will offer any one of you a lieutenancy if you will accept a training position.It can be on Earth; on the Moon at double pay; on Charon at triple pay; or here at Stargate for quadruple pay.Furthermore, you dont have to make up your mind now.Youre all getting a free trip back to Earth  I envy you, I havent been back in fifteen years, will probably never go back  and you can get the feel of being a civilian again.If you dont like it, just walk into any UNEF installation and youll walk out an officer.Your choice of assignment.Some of you are smiling.I think you ought to reserve judgment.Earth is not the same place you left.He pulled a little card out of his tunic and looked at it, smiling.Most of you have something on the order of four hundred thousand dollars coming to you, accumulated pay and interest.But Earth is on a war footing and, of course, it is the citizens of Earth who are supporting the war.Your income puts you in a ninety two percent income tax bracket: thirty two thousand might last you about three years if youre careful.Eventually youre going to have to get a job, and this is one job for which you are uniquely trained.There are not that many jobs available.The population of Earth is nearly nine billion, with five or six billion unemployed.Also keep in mind that your friends and sweethearts of two years ago are now going to be twenty one years older than you.Many of your relatives will have passed away.I think youll find it a very lonely world.But to tell you something about this world, Im going to turn you over to Captain Siri, who just arrived from Earth.Captain?Thank you, General.It looked as if there was something wrong with his skin, his face; and then I realized he was wearing powder and lipstick.His nails were smooth white almonds.I dont know where to begin.He sucked in his upper lip and looked at us, frowning.Things have changed so very much since I was a boy.Im twenty three, so I was still in diapers when you people left for Aleph  to begin with, how many of you are homosexual?Nobody.That doesnt really surprise me.I am, of course.I guess about a third of everybody in Europe and America is.Most governments encourage homosexuality  the United Nations is neutral, leaves it up to the individual countries  they encourage homolife mainly because its the one sure method of birth control.That seemed specious to me.Our method of birth control in the army is pretty foolproof  all men making a deposit in the sperm bank, and then vasectomy.As the General said, the population of the world is nine billion.Its more than doubled since you were drafted.And nearly two thirds of those people get out of school only to go on relief.Speaking of school, how many years of public schooling did the government give you?He was looking at me, so I answered.Fourteen.He nodded.Its eighteen now.More, if you dont pass your examinations.And youre required by law to pass your exams before youre eligible for any job or Class One relief.And brotherboy, anything besides Class One is hard to live on.Yes?Hofstadter had his hand up.Sir, is it eighteen years public school in every country?Where do they find enough schools?Oh, most people take the last five or six years at home or in a community center, via holoscreen.The UN has forty or fifty information channels, giving instruction twenty four hours a day.But most of you wont have to concern yourselves with that.If youre in the Force, youre already too smart by half.He brushed hair from his eyes in a thoroughly feminine gesture, pouting a little.Let me do some history to you.I guess the first really important thing that happened after you left was the Ration War.That was 2007.A lot of things happened at once.Locust plague in North America, rice blight from Burma to the South China Sea, red tides all along the west coast of South America: suddenly there just wasnt enough food to go around.The UN stepped in and took over food distribution.Every man, woman, and child got a ration booklet, allowing thim to consume so many calories per month.If tha went over their monthly allotment, they just went hungry until the first of the next month.Some of the new people wed picked up after Aleph used tha, then thim instead of he, his, him, for the collective pronoun.I wondered whether it had become universal.Of course, an illegal market developed, and soon there was great inequality in the amount of food people in various strata of society consumed.A vengeance group in Ecuador, the Imparciales, systematically began to assassinate people who appeared to be well fed.The idea caught on pretty quickly, and in a few months there was a full scale, undeclared class war going on all over the world.The United Nations managed to get things back under control in a year or so, by which time the population was down to four billion, crops were more or less recovered, and the food crisis was over.They kept the rationing, but its never been really severe again.Incidentally, the General translated the money coming to you into dollars just for your own convenience.The world has only one currency now, calories.Your thirty two thousand dollars comes to about three thousand million calories.Or three million KS, kilocalories.Ever since the Ration War, the UN has encouraged subsistence farming wherever its practical.Food you grow yourself, of course, isnt rationed  It got people out of the cities, onto UN farming reservations, which helped alleviate some urban problems.But subsistence farming seems to encourage large families, so the population of the world has more than doubled since the Ration War.Also, we no longer have the abundance of electrical power I remember from boyhood  probably a good deal less than you remember.There are only a few places in the world where you can have power all day and night.They keep saying its a temporary situation, but its been going on for over a decade.He went on like that for a long time.Well, hell, it wasnt really surprising, much of it.Wed probably spent more time in the past two years talking about what home was going to be like than about anything else.Unfortunately, most of the bad things wed prognosticated seemed to have come true, and not many of the good things.The worst thing for me, I guess, was that theyd taken over most of the good parkland and subdivided it into little farms.If you wanted to find some wildemess, you had to go someplace where they couldnt possibly make a plant grow.He said that the relations between people who chose homolife and the ones he called breeders were quite smooth, but I wondered.I never had much trouble accepting homosexuals myself, but then Id never had to cope with such an abundance of them.He also said, in answer to an impolite question, that his powder and paint had nothing to do with his sexual orientation.It was just stylish.I decided Id be an anachronism and just wear my face.I dont guess it should have surprised me that language had changed considerably in twenty years.My parents were always saying things were cool, joints were grass, and so on.We had to wait several weeks before we could get a ride back to Earth.Wed be going back on the Anniversary, but first she had to be taken apart and put back together again.Meanwhile, we were put in cozy little two man billets and released from all military responsibilities.Most of us spent our days down at the library, trying to catch up on twenty two years of current events.Evenings, wed get together at the Flowing Bowl, an NCO club.The privates, of course, werent supposed to be there, but we found that nobody argues with a person who has two of the fluorescent battle ribbons.I was surprised that they served heroin fixes at the bar.The waiter said that you get a compensating shot to keep you from getting addicted to it.I got really stoned and tried one.Never again.Sub major Stott stayed at Stargate, where they were assembling a new Strike Force Alpha.The rest of us boarded the Anniversary and had a fairly pleasant six month journey.Cortez didnt insist on everything being capital M military, so it was a lot better than the trip from Yod 4.8  I hadnt given it too much thought, but of course we were celebrities on Earth: the first vets home from the war.The Secretary General greeted us at Kennedy and we had a week long whirl of banquets, receptions, interviews, and all that.It was enjoyable enough, and profitable  I made a million KS from Time Life/Fax  but we really saw little of Earth until after the novelty wore off and we were more or less allowed to go our own way.I picked up the Washington monorail at Grand Central Station and headed home.My mother had met me at Kennedy, suddenly and sadly old, and told me my father was dead.Flyer accident.I was going to stay with her until I could get a job.She was living in Columbia, a satellite of Washington.She had moved back into the city after the Ration War having moved out in 1980  and then failing services and rising crime had forced her out again.She was waiting for me at the monorail station.Beside her stood a blond giant in a heavy black vinyl uniform, with a big gunpowder pistol on his hip and spiked brass knuckles on his right hand.William, this is Carl, my bodyguard and very dear friend.Carl slipped off the knuckles long enough to shake hands with surprising gentleness.Pleasameecha Misser Mandella.We got into a groundcar that had Jefferson written on it in bright orange letters.I thought that was an odd thing to name a car, but then found out that it was the name of the high rise Mother and Carl lived in.The groundcar was one of several that belonged to the community, and she paid 100K per kilometer for the use of it.I had to admit that Columbia was rather pretty: formal gardens and lots of trees and grass.Even the high rises, roughly conical jumbles of granite with trees growing out at odd places, looked more like mountains than buildings.We drove into the base of one of these mountains, down a well lit corridor to where a number of other cars were parked.Carl carried my solitary bag to the elevator and set it down.Miz Mandella, if is awright witcha, I gots to go pick up Miz Freeman in like five.She over West Branch.Sure, Carl, William can take care of me.Hes a soldier, you know.Thats right, I remember learning eight silent ways to kill a man.Maybe if things got really tight, I could get a job like Carls.Righty oh, yeah, you tol me.Whassit like, man?Mostly boring, I said automatically.When you arent bored, youre scared.He nodded wisely.Thass what I heard.Miz Mandella, I be vailable anytime after six.Righty oh?Thats fine, Carl.The elevator came and a tall skinny boy stepped out, an unlit joint dangling from his lips.Carl ran his fingers over the spikes on his knuckles, and the boy walked rapidly away.Gots to watch out fer them riders.Tcare a yerself, Miz Mandella.We got on the elevator and Mother punched 47.Whats a rider?Oh, theyre just young toughs who ride up and down the elevators looking for defenseless people without bodyguards.They arent too much of a problem here.The forty seventh floor was a huge mall filled with shops and offices.We went to a food store.Have you gotten your ration book yet, William?I told her I hadnt, but the Force had given me travel tickets worth a hundred thousand calories and Id used up only half of them.It was a little confusing, but theyd explained it to us.When the world went on a single currency, theyd tried to coordinate it with the food rationing in some way, hoping to eventually eliminate the ration books, so theyd made the new currency Ks, kilocalories, because thats the unit for measuring the energy equivalent of food.But a person who eats 2,000 kilocalories of steak a day obviously has to pay more than a person eating the same amount of bread.So they instituted a sliding ration factor, so complicated that nobody could understand it.After a few weeks they were using the books again, but calling food kilocalories calories in an attempt to make things less confusing.Seemed to me theyd save a lot of trouble all around if theyd just call money dollars again, or rubles or sisterces or whatever  anything but kilocalories.Food prices were astonishing, except for grains and legumes.I insisted on splurging on some good red meat: 1500 calories worth of ground beef, costing 1730K.The same amount of fakesteak, made from soy beans, would have cost 80x.I also got a head of lettuce for 140K and a little bottle of olive oil for 175K.Mother said she had some vinegar.Started to buy some mushrooms but she said she had a neighbor who grew them and could trade something from her balcony garden.At her apartment on the ninety second floor, she apologized for the smallness of the place.It didnt seem so little to me, but then shed never lived on a spaceship.Even this high up, there were bars on the windows.The door had four separate locks, one of which didnt work because somebody had used a crowbar on it.Mother went off to turn the ground beef into a meatloaf and I settled down with the evening fax.She pulled some carrots from her little garden and called the mushroom lady, whose son came over to make the trade.He had a riot gun slung under his arm.Mother, wheres the rest of the Star?I called into the kitchen.As far as I know, its all there.What were you looking for?Well  I found the classified section, but noHelp Wanted.She laughed.Son, there hasnt been aHelp Wanted ad in ten years.The government takes care of jobs  well, most of them.Everybody works for the government?No, thats not it.She came in, wiping her hands on a frayed towel.The government, they tell us, handles the distribution of all natural resources.And there arent many resources more valuable than empty jobs.Well, Ill go talk to them tomorrow.Dont bother, son.How much retirement pay you say youre getting from the Force?Twenty thousand K a month.Doesnt look like itll go far.No, it wont.But your fathers pension gave me less than half that, and they wouldnt give me a job.Jobs are assigned on a basis of need.And youve got to be living on rice and water before the Employment Board considers you needy.Well, hell, its a bureaucracy  there must be somebody I can pay off, slip me into a good  No.Sorry, thats one part of the UN thats absolutely incorruptible.The whole shebang is cybernetic, untouched by human souls.You cant  But you said you had a job!I was getting to that.If you want a job badly enough, you can go to a dealer and sometimes get a hand me down.Hand me down?Dealer?Take my job as an example, son.A woman named Hailey Williams has a job in a hospital, running a machine that analyzes blood, a chromatography machine.She works six nights a week, for 12,000K a week.She gets tired of working, so she contacts a dealer and lets him know that her job is available.Some time before this, Id given the dealer his initial fee of 50,000K to get on his list.He comes by and describes the job to me and I say fine, Ill take it.He knew I would and already has fake identification and a uniform.He distributes small bribes to the various supervisors who might know Miss Williams by sight.Miss Williams shows me how to run the machine and quits.She still gets the weekly 12,000K credited to her account, but she pays me half.I pay the dealer ten percent and wind up with 5400K per week.This, added to the nine grand I get monthly from your fathers pension, makes me quite comfortable.Then it gets complicated.Finding myself with plenty of money and too little time, I contact the dealer again, offering to sublet half my job.The next day a girl shows up who also hasHailey Williams identification.I show her how to run the machine, and she takes over Monday Wednesday Friday.Half of my real salary is 2700K, so she gets half that, 1350K, and pays the dealer 135.She got a pad and a stylus and did some figuring.So the real Hailey Williams gets 6000K weekly for doing nothing.I work three days a week for 4050K.My assistant works three days for 1115K.The dealer gets 100,000K in fees and 735K per week.Lopsided, isnt it?Hmm  Ill say.Quite illegal, too, I suppose.For the dealer.Everybody else might lose their job and have to start over, if the Employment Board finds out.But the dealer gets brainwiped.Guess I better find a dealer, while I can still afford the fifty grand bite.Actually, I still had over three million, but planned to run through most of it in a short time.Hell, Id earned it.I was getting ready to go the next morning when Mother came in with a shoebox.Inside, there was a small pistol in a clip on holster.This belonged to your father, she explained.Better wear it if youre planning to go downtown without a bodyguard.It was a gunpowder pistol with ridiculously thin bullets.I hefted it in my hand.Did Dad ever use it?Several times  just to scare away riders and hitters, though.He never actually shot anybody.Youre probably right that I need a gun, I said, putting.it back.But Id have to have something with more heft to it.Can I buy one legally?Sure, theres a gun store down in the Mall.As long as you dont have a police record, you can buy anything that suits you.Good; Id get a little pocket laser.I could hardly hit the wall with a gunpowder pistol.But  William, Id feel a lot better if youd hire a bodyguard, at least until you know your way around.Wed gone all around that last night.Being an official Trained Killer, I thought I was tougher than any clown I might hire for the job.Ill check into it, Mother.Dont worry  Im not even going downtown today, just into Hyattsville.Thats just as bad.When the elevator came, it was already occupied.He looked at me blandly as I got in, a man a little older than me, clean shaven and well dressed.He stepped back to let me at the row of buttons.I punched 47 and then, realizing his motive might not have been politeness, turned to see him struggling to get at a metal pipe stuck in his waistband.It had been hidden by his cape.Come on, fella, I said, reaching for a nonexistent weapon.You wanna get caulked?He had the pipe free but let it hang loosely at his side.Caulked?Killed.Army term.I took one step toward him, trying to remember.Kick just under the knee, then either groin or kidney.I decided on the groin.No.He put the pipe back in his waistband.I dont want to getcaulked.The door opened at 47 and I backed out.The gun shop was all bright white plastic and gleamy black metal.A little bald man bobbed over to wait on me.He had a pistol in a shoulder rig.And a fine morning to you, sir, he said and giggled.What will it be today?Lightweight pocket laser, I said.Carbon dioxide.He looked at me quizzically and then brightened.Coming right up, sir.Giggle.Special today, I throw in a handful of tachyon grenades.Fine.Theyd be handy.He looked at me expectantly.So?Whats the popper?Huh?The punch, man; you set me up, now knock me down.Laser.He giggled.I was beginning to understand.You mean I cant buy a laser.Of course not, sweetie, he said and sobered.You didnt know that?Ive been out of the country for a long time.The world, you mean.Youve been out of the world a long time.He put his left hand on a chubby hip in a gesture that incidentally made his gun easier to get.He scratched the center of his chest.I stood very still.Thats right.I just got out of the Force.His jaw dropped.Hey, no bully bull?You been out shootin em up, out in space?Thats right.Hey, all that crap about you not gettin older, theres nothin to that, is there?Oh, its true.I was born in 1975.Well, god  damn.Youre almost as old as I am.He giggled.I thought that was just something the government made up.Anyhow  you say I cant buy a laser  Oh, no.No no no.I run a legal shop here.What can I buy?Oh, pistol, rifle, shotgun, knife, body armor  just no lasers or explosives or fully automatic weapons.Let me see a pistol.The biggest you have.Ah, Ive got just the thing.He motioned me over to a display case and opened the back, taking out a huge revolver.Four ten gauge six shooter.He cradled it in both hands.Dinosaur stopper.Authentic Old West styling.Slugs or flechettes.Flechettes?Sure  uh, theyre like a bunch of tiny darts.You shoot and they spread out in a Pattern.Hard to miss that way.Sounded like my speed.Anyplace I can try it out?Course, of course, we have a range in back.Let me get my assistant.He rang a bell and a boy came out to watch the store while we went in back.He picked up a red and green box of shotgun shells on the way.The range was in two sections, a little anteroom with a plastic transparent door and a long corridor on the other side of the door with a table at one end and targets at the other.Behind the targets was a sheet of metal that evidently deflected the bullets down into a pool of water.He loaded the pistol and set it on the table.Please dont pick it up until the doors closed.He went into the anteroom, closed the door, and picked up a microphone.Okay.First time, you better hold on to it with both hands.I did so, raising it up in line with the center target, a square of paper looking about the size of your thumbnail at arms length.Doubted Id even come near it.I pulled the trigger and it went back easily enough, but nothing happened.No, no, he said over, the microphone with a tinny giggle.Authentic Old West styling.Youve got to pull the hammer back.Sure, just like in the flicks.I hauled the hammer back, lined it up again, and squeezed the trigger.The noise was so loud it made my face sting.The gun bucked up and almost hit me on the forehead.But the three center targets were gone: just tiny tatters of paper drifting in the air.Ill take it.He sold me a hip holster, twenty shells, a chest and back shield, and a dagger in a boot sheath.I felt more heavily armed than I had in a fighting suit.But no waldos to help me cart it around.The monorail had two guards for each car.I was beginning to feel that all my heavy artillery was superfluous, until I got off at the Hyattsville station.Everyone who got off at Hyattsville was either heavily armed or had a bodyguard.The people loitering around the station were all armed.The police carried lasers.I pushed a cab call button, and the readout told me mine would be No.3856.I asked a policeman and he told me to wait for it down on the street; it would cruise around the block twice.During the five minutes I waited, I twice heard staccato arguments of gunfire, both of them rather far away.I was glad Id bought the shield.Eventually the cab came.It swerved to the curb when I waved at it, the door sliding open as it stopped.Looked as if it worked the same way as the autocabs I remembered.The door stayed open while it checked the thumbprint to verify that I was the one who had called, then slammed shut.It was thick steel.The view through the windows was dim and distorted; probably thick bulletproof plastic.Not quite the same as I remembered.I had to leaf through a grimy book to find the code for the address of the bar in Hyattsville where I was supposed to meet the dealer.I punched it out and sat back to watch the city go by.This part of town was mostly residential: grayed brick warrens built around the middle of the last century competing for space with more modem modular setups and, occasionally, individual houses behind tall brick or concrete walls with jagged broken glass and barbed wire at the top.A few people seemed to be going somewhere, walking very quickly down the sidewalks, hands on weapons.Most of the people I saw were either sitting in doorways, smoking, or loitering around shopfronts in groups of no fewer than six.Everything was dirty and cluttered.The gutters were clotted with garbage, and shoals of waste paper drifted with the wind of the light traffic.It was understandable, though; street sweeping was probably a very high risk profession.The cab pulled up in front of Tom Jerrys Bar and Grill and let me out after I paid 430x.I stepped to the sidewalk with my hand on the shotgun pistol, but there was nobody around.I hustled into the bar.It was surprisingly clean on the inside, dimly lit and furnished in fake leather and fake pine.I went to the bar and got some fake bourbon and, presumably, real water for 120K.The water cost 20K.A waitress came over with a tray.Pop one, brother boy?The tray had a rack of old fashioned hypodermic needles.Not today, thanks.If I was going to pop one, Id use an aerosol.The needles looked unsanitary and painful.She set the dope down on the bar and eased onto the stool next to me.She sat with her chin cupped in her palm and stared at her reflection in the mirror behind the bar.God.Tuesdays.I mumbled something.You wanna go in back fer a quickie?I looked at her with what I hoped was a neutral expression.She was wearing only a short skirt of some gossamer material, and it plunged in a shallow V in the front, exposing her hipbones and a few bleached pubic hairs.I wondered what could possibly keep it up.She wasnt bad looking, could have been anywhere from her late twenties to her early forties.No telling what they could do with cosmetic surgery and makeup nowadays, though.Maybe she was older than my mother.Thanks anyhow.Not today?Thats right.I can get you a nice boy, if  No.No thanks.What a world.She pouted into the mirror, an expression that was probably older than Homo sapiens.You dont like me.I like you fine.Thats just not what I came here for.Well  different funs for different ones.She shrugged.Hey, Jerry.Get me a short beer.He brought it.Oh, damn, my purse is locked up.Mister, can you spare forty calories?I had enough ration tickets to take care of a whole banquet.Tore off a fifty and gave it to the bartender.Jesus.She stared.Howd you get a full book at the end of the month?I told her in as few words, as possible who I was and how I managed to have so many calories.There had been two months worth of books waiting in my mail, and I hadnt even used up the ones the Force had given me.She offered to buy a book from me for ten grand, but I didnt want to get involved in more than one illegal enterprise at a time.Two men came in, one unarmed and the other with both a pistol and a riot gun.The bodyguard sat by the door and the other came over to me.Mr.Mandella?Thats right.Shall we take a booth?He didnt offer his name.He had a cup of coffee, and I sipped a mug of beer.I dont keep any written records, but I have an excellent memory.Tell me what sort of a job youre interested in, what your qualifications are, what salary youll accept, and so on.I told him Id prefer to wait for a job where I could use my physics, teaching or research, even engineering.I wouldnt need a job for two or three months, since I planned to travel and spend money for a while.Wanted at least 20,000K monthly, but how much Id accept would depend on the nature of the job.He didnt say a word until Id finished.Righty oh.Now, Im afraid  youd have a hard time, getting a job in physics.Teaching is out; I cant supply jobs where the person is constantly exposed to the public.Research, well, your degree is almost a quarter of a century old.Youd have to go back to school, maybe five or six years.Might do that, I said.The one really marketable feature you have is your combat experience.I could probably place you in a supervisory job at a bodyguard agency for even more than twenty grand.You could make almost that much, being a bodyguard yourself  Thanks, but I wouldnt want to take chances for somebody elses hide.Righty oh.Cant say I blame you.He finished his coffee in a long slurp.Well, Ive got to run, got a thousand things to do.Ill keep you in mind and talk to some people.Good.Ill see you in a few months.Righty oh.Dont need to make an appointment.I come in here every day at eleven for coffee.Just show up.I finished my beer and called a cab to take me home.I wanted to walk around the city, but Mother was right.Id get a bodyguard first.9  I came home and the phone was blinking pale blue.Didnt know what to do so I punched Operator.A pretty young girls head materialized in the cube.Jefferson operator, she said.May I help you?Yes  what does it mean when the cube is blinking blue?Huh?What does it mean when the phone  Are you serious?I was getting a little tired of this kind of thing.Its a long story.Honest, I dont know.When it blinks blue youre supposed to call the operator.Okay, here I am.No, not me, the real operator.Punch nine.Then punch zero.I did that and an old harridan appeared.Ob a ray duh.This is William Mandella at 301 52 574 3975.I was supposed to call you.Juzza segun.She reached outside the field of view and typed something.You godda call from 605 19 556 2027.I scribbled it down on the pad by the phone.Wheres that?Juzza segun.South Dakota.Thanks.I didnt know anybody in South Dakota.A pleasant looking old woman answered the phone.Yes?I had a call from this number  uh  Im  Oh.Sergeant Mandella!Just a second.I watched the diagonal bar of the holding Pattern for a second, then fifty or so more.Then a head came into focus.Marygay.William.I had a heck of a time finding you.Darling, me too.What are you doing in South Dakota?My parents live here, in a little commune.Thats why it took me so long to get to the phone.She held up two grimy hands.Digging potatoes.But when I checked  the records said  the records in Tucson said your parents were both dead.No, theyre just dropouts  you know about dropouts?New name, new life.I got the word through a cousin.Well  well, howve you been?Like the country life?Thats one reason Ive been wanting to get you.Willy, Im bored.Its all very healthy and nice, but I want to do something dissipated and wicked.Naturally I thought of you.Im flattered.Pick you up at eight?She checked a clock above the phone.No, look, lets get a good nights sleep.Besides, Ive got to get in the rest of the potatoes.Meet me at  the Ellis Island jetport at ten tomorrow morning.Mmm  Trans World information desk.Okay.Make reservations for where?She shrugged.Pick a place.London used to be pretty wicked.Sounds good.First class?What else?Ill get us a suite on one of the dirigibles.Good.Decadent.How long shall I pack for?Well buy clothes along the way.Travel light.Just one stuffed wallet apiece.She giggled.Wonderful.Tomorrow at ten.Fine uh  Marygay, do you have a gun?Its that bad?Here around Washington it is.Well, Ill get one.Dad has a couple over the fireplace.Guess theyre left over from Tucson.Well hope we wont need them.Willy, you know itll just be for decoration.I couldnt even kill a Tauran.Of course.We just looked at each other for a second.Tomorrow at ten, then.Right.Love you.Uh  She giggled again and hung up.That was just too many things to think about all at once.I got us two round the world dirigible tickets; unlimited stops as long as you kept going east.It took me a little over two hours to get to Ellis by autocab and monorail.I was early, but so was Marygay.She was talking to the girl at the desk and didnt see me coming.Her outfit was really arresting, a tight coverall of plastic in a pattern of interlocking hands; as your angle of sight changed various strategic hands became transparent.She had a ruddy sun glow all over her body.I dont know whether the feeling that rushed over me was simple honest lust or something more complicated.I hurried up behind her.Whispering: What are we going to do for three hours?She turned and gave me a quick hug and thanked the girl at the desk, then grabbed my hand and pulled me along to a slidewalk.Um  where are we headed?
