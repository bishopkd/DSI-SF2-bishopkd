Her fear and her confusion were evident.I knew how she felt, but this wasnt the time to sympathize.She asked you, and not her own guard, because her own guard is fighting her, and probably each other.Depending on which of them got orders from which of her.I dont know who to believe, said Senior Security.But I thought Securitys natural inclination to side with dock authority might tip the balance in our favor.And Captain Vel and her lieutenant and troops had lost the initiative, lost any chance to disarm me, with Security in the balance but ready to tip my way, them and their stun sticks.Maybe if the Mercy of Kalrs had ever seen combat, ever seen any enemy that wasnt a training exercise.Hadnt spent so long on a Mercy, ferrying supplies or running long, dull patrols.Or visiting palaces and eating pastry.Eating pastry and having tea with associates who had decided political opinions.You dont even know, I said to Captain Vel, which one is giving which orders.She frowned, puzzled.She hadnt entirely understood the situation, then.Id assumed she knew more than she did.Youre confused, said Captain Vel.It isnt your fault, the enemy has misinformed you, and your mind was never your own to begin with.My lord is leaving!called a Security officer.As a body, Security looked toward Senior Security.Who looked at me.None of this distracted Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat.And just who, Captain, is the enemy?You!Captain Vel answered, vehement and bitter.And everyone like you who aids and encourages whats happened to us in the last five hundred years.Five hundred years of alien infiltration and corruption.The word she used was a close cousin of the one the Lord of the Radch had used to describe my pollution of temple offerings.Captain Vel turned to me again.Youre confused, but you were made by Anaander Mianaai to serve Anaander Mianaai.Not her enemies.There is no way to serve Anaander Mianaai without serving her enemy, I said.Senior Security, Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat has seen to the docks.You secure any airlocks you can reach.We need to be certain no one leaves this station.The continued existence of this station depends on it.Yes, sir, said Senior Security, and began to consult with her officers.She spoke with you, I guessed, turning back to Captain Vel.She told you the Presger had infiltrated the Radch in order to subvert and destroy it.I saw answering recognition on Captain Vels face.I had guessed correctly.She couldnt have told that lie to anyone who remembered what the Presger did, when they thought humans were their legitimate prey.They are powerful enough to destroy us whenever they wish.No one is subverting the Lord of the Radch except the Lord of the Radch.She has been secretly at war with herself for a thousand years.I forced her to see it, all of her here, and she will do anything to prevent having to acknowledge this to the rest of herself.Including using Mercy of Kalr to destroy this station before that information can leave here.Shocked silence.Then Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat said, We cant control all the accesses to the hull.If she goes outside and finds a launch unattended, or willing to take her Which would be anyone she found, because who here would think of disobeying the Lord of the Radch?And there was no way to broadcast a warning to everyone.Or to ensure that anyone believed the warning.Carry the message as quickly as you can, as far as you can, I said, and let the omens fall as they will.And I need to warn Mercy of Kalr not to let anyone aboard.Captain Vel made a quick, angry motion.Dont, Captain, I said.Id rather not have to tell Mercy of Kalr I killed you.The shuttle pilot was armed and armored, and unwilling to leave without her captains direct order.I was unwilling to allow Captain Vel anywhere near the shuttle.If the pilot had been an ancillary I wouldnt have hesitated to kill her, but as it was I shot her in the leg and let Seivarden and the two dock inspectors whod come to do the manual undock for me drag her onto the station.Put pressure on the wound, I said to Seivarden.I dont know if its possible to reach Medical.I thought of the Security, soldiers, and palace guards all over the station, who likely had conflicting orders and priorities, and hoped that all the civilians were safely sheltered by now.Im coming with you, said Seivarden, looking up from where she knelt half on the shuttle pilots back, binding her wrists.No.You might have some authority with Captain Vels sort.Maybe even with Captain Vel herself.You do have a thousand years seniority, after all.A thousand years back pay, said a dock inspector, in an awed voice.Like that will ever happen, said Seivarden, and then, Breq.And recollecting herself, Ship.I dont have time, I said, brusque and flat.A brief flash of anger on her face, and then, Youre right.But her voice shook, just slightly, and her hands.I turned without saying anything more and boarded the shuttle, pushing off from the stations gravity into the shuttles lack of it, and closed the lock, then kicked myself over to the pilots seat, waving away a globule of blood, and strapped in.Thunking and pounding told me undocking had started.I had one wired in camera fore, which showed me a few of the ships around the palace, shuttles, miners, little tenders and sail pods, the bigger passenger and cargo ships either on their way out or waiting for permission to approach.Mercy of Kalr, white hulled, awkward shaped, its deadly engines larger than the rest of it, was somewhere out there.And beyond all of this, the beacons that lit the gates that brought ships from system to system.The station would have gone utterly, suddenly silent to them.The pilots and captains of these ships must be confused or frightened.I hoped none of them would be foolish enough to approach without permission from dock authorities.My only other wired camera, aft, showed me the gray hull of the station.The last thunk of the undocking vibrated through the shuttle, and I set the controls on manual and started outslowly, carefully, because I couldnt see to either side.Once I judged myself clear, I picked up speed.And then sat back to waiteven at this shuttles top speed Mercy of Kalr was half a day away.I had time to think.After all this time, after all this effort, here I was.I had hardly dared hope that I could revenge myself so thoroughly, hardly hoped that I could shoot even one Anaander Mianaai, and I had shot four.And more Anaander Mianaais were almost certainly killing each other back there in the palace as she battled herself for control of the station, and ultimately of the Radch itself, the result of my message.None of it would bring back Lieutenant Awn.Or me.I was all but dead, had been for twenty years, just a last, tiny fragment of myself that had managed to exist a bit longer than the rest, each action I took a very good candidate for the last thing Id ever do.A song bubbled up into my memory.Oh, have you gone to the battlefield, armored and well armed, and shall dreadful events force you to drop your weapons?And that led, inexplicably, to the memory of the children in the temple plaza in Ors.One, two, my aunt told me, three, four, the corpse soldier.I had very little to do now besides sing to myself, and no one to disturb, no worries I might choose some tune that would lead someone to recognize or suspect me, or that anyone would complain about the quality of my voice.I opened my mouth to sing out, in a way I hadnt for years, when I was checked mid breath by the sound of something banging against the airlock.This sort of shuttle had two airlocks.One would only open when docked with a ship or a station.The other was a smaller emergency hatch along the side.It was just the sort of hatch Id used to board the shuttle Id taken when Id left Justice of Toren so long ago.The sound came one more time and then stopped.It occurred to me that it might only have been some debris knocking into the hull as I passed.Then again, if I were in Anaander Mianaais place, Id try anything I could think of to achieve my aims.And I couldnt see the outside of the shuttle with communications blocked, only those two narrow views fore and aft.I might well be bringing Anaander Mianaai to Mercy of Kalr myself.If someone was out there, if it wasnt just debris, it was Anaander Mianaai.How many of her?The airlock was small, and easily defensible, but it would be easiest not to have to defend it at all.It would be best to keep her from opening the airlock.Surely the communications blackout didnt reach much farther away from the palace.I quickly made the changes in heading that would steer me away from Mercy of Kalr but still, I hoped, toward the outer edges of the communications block.I could speak to Mercy of Kalr and never go any closer to it.That done, I turned my attention to the airlock.Both doors of the lock were built to swing inward, so that any pressure difference would force them shut.And I knew how to remove the inner door, had cleaned and maintained shuttles just like this one for decades.For centuries.Once I removed the inner door it would be nearly impossible to open the outer one so long as there was air in the shuttle.It took me twelve minutes to remove the hinges and maneuver the door to a place where I could secure it.It should have taken ten, but the pins were dirty and didnt slide as smoothly as they should have, once Id released their catches.Human troops shirking, I was sureId never have allowed such a thing on any of my own shuttles.Just as I finished, the shuttles console began to speak, in a flat, even voice I knew belonged to a ship.Shuttle, respond.Shuttle, respond.Mercy of Kalr, I said, kicking myself forward.This is Justice of Toren piloting your shuttle.No immediate answerI didnt doubt what Id said had been enough to shock Mercy of Kalr into silent surprise.Do not let anyone aboard you.In particular do not let any version of Anaander Mianaai anywhere near you.If shes already there keep her away from your engines.Now I could access the cameras that werent physically wired, I hit the switch that would show me a panoramic view of what was outside the shuttleI wanted more than just that forward camera view.Hit the buttons that would broadcast my words to anyone listening.All ships.Whether they would listenor obeyI couldnt predict, but that wasnt something I could realistically control anyway.Do not let anyone aboard you.Do not let Anaander Mianaai aboard you under any circumstances.Your lives depend on it.The lives of everyone on the station depend on it.As I spoke the gray bulkheads seemed to dissolve away.The main console, the seats, the two airlock hatches remained, but otherwise I might have been floating unprotected in vacuum.Three vacuum suited figures clung to handholds around the airlock Id disabled.One had turned her head to look at a sail pod that had swung dangerously close.A fourth was pulling herself forward along the hull.Shes not aboard me, said Mercy of Kalrs voice through the console.But shes on your hull and ordering my officers to assist her.Ordering me to order you to allow her into the shuttle.How can you be Justice of Toren?Not What do you mean dont let the Lord of the Radch aboard, I noticed.I came with Captain Seivarden, I said.The Anaander Mianaai whod come forward clipped herself to one handhold, then another, and pulled a gun from the tool holder on her suit.What is the pod doing?The sail pod was still too close to me.The pilot is offering help to the people on your hull.Shes only just realized its the Lord of the Radch, whos told her to back off.The sail pod would do the Lord of the Radch very little goodit was built for only very short trips, more a toy than anything else.It would never make it as far as Mercy of Kalr.Not in one piece, and not with its passengers alive and breathing.Are there any other Anaanders outside the station?There dont appear to be.The Anaander Mianaai with the gun extended armor in a flash of silver that covered her vacuum suit, held the gun against the shuttles hull, and fired.Ive heard it said that guns wont fire in a vacuum, but really it depends on the gun.This one fired, the impact a bang that I could feel where I clung to the pilots seat.The force of the shot pushed her back, but not far, securely clipped as she was to the hull.She fired again, bang.And again.And again.Some shuttles were armored.Some even had a larger version of my own armor.This shuttle wasnt, didnt.This shuttles hull was built to withstand a fair number of random impacts, but it wasnt built to endure continued stress on the same spot, over and over again.Bang.She had thought through her inability to open the airlock, realized that whoever was piloting this shuttle was her enemy.Realized that I had removed the inner door, and that the outer wouldnt open until the air was out of the entire shuttle.If Anaander Mianaai could get in, she could patch the bullet hole and repressurize the shuttle.Even after a hull breach the shuttle (unlike the sail pod) would have enough air to take her all the way to Mercy of Kalr.If she had tried to order the palaces destruction from where she hung on to the side of this shuttle, she had failed.More likely, I realized, shed known from the beginning such an order would fail and had not tried to give it.She needed to get aboard a ship, order it closer to the palace, and breach its heat shield herself.She wouldnt be able to get anyone else to do it for her.If Mercy of Kalr was correct, and there were no other Anaanders outside the station, all I had to do was get rid of these.The rest, whatever was happening on the station, I would have to leave to Skaaiat and Seivarden.And Anaander Mianaai.I remember the last time we met, said Mercy of Kalr.It was at Prid Nadeni.A trap.We never met.Bang.The sail pod moved away, but not far.Until now.And I was never at Prid Nadeni.But what did it prove, that I knew that?Verifying my identity might have been easy, if I hadnt disabled or hidden so many of my implants.I thought for a moment, considering, and then I spoke a string of words, the closest I could get with my single, human mouth to the way I would have identified myself to another ship, so long ago.Silence, punctuated by another shot against the shuttle hull.Are you really Justice of Toren?asked Mercy of Kalr at length.Where have you been?And wheres the rest of you?And whats happening?Where Ive been is a long story.The rest of me is gone.Anaander Mianaai breached my heat shield.Bang.The forward Anaander ejected the magazine from her gun, slowly and methodically, and inserted another.The others still huddled around the airlock.I assume you know whats going on with Anaander Mianaai.Only partially, said Mercy of Kalr.I find Im having difficulty saying what I think is happening.No surprise at all, to me.The Lord of the Radch visited you in secret, and placed some new accesses.Probably other things.Orders.Instructions.In secret, because she was hiding what shed done from herself.Back at the palaceit seemed ages ago, now, but it had only been a few hoursI told all of her straight out what was happening.That she was divided, moving against herself.She doesnt want that knowledge to go any further, and theres a part of her that wants to use you to destroy the station before the information can get out.Shed rather do that than face the results of that knowledge.Silence from Mercy of Kalr.Youre bound to obey her.But I know My throat closed up.I swallowed.I know theres only so far you can be forced to go.But it would be extremely unfortunate for the residents of Omaugh Palace if you discovered that point after having killed them all.Bang.Steady.Patient.Anaander Mianaai only needed one very small hole, and some time.And there was plenty of time.Which one destroyed you?Does it matter?I dont know, answered Mercy of Kalr, from the console, voice calm.Ive been unhappy with the situation for some time.Anaander Mianaai had said that Mercy of Kalr was hers, but Captain Vel was not.That had to be uncomfortable for it.Could potentially be uncomfortable for me, and extremely unfortunate for the palace, if Mercy of Kalr was sufficiently attached to its captain.The one that destroyed me was the one Captain Vel supports.Not, I think, the one that visited you.Im not completely certain, though.How are we supposed to tell them apart when theyre all the same person?Where is my captain?asked Mercy of Kalr.It said something to me, that the ship had waited this long to ask.She was fine when I left her.Your lieutenant too.Bang.I did injure the shuttle pilot, she wouldnt leave her station.I hope shes all right.Mercy of Kalr, whichever Lord of the Radch has your support, I beg you not to let any on board, or obey her orders.The firing stopped.The Lord of the Radch was worried, perhaps, that her gun would overheat.Still, she had plenty of time, no need to rush.I see what the Lord of the Radch is doing to the shuttle, said Mercy of Kalr.That in itself would be enough to tell me something is wrong.But of course, Mercy of Kalr had more indications than just that.The communications blackout, which resembled what had happened on Shisurna twenty years ago, probably only reported in rumor, but still sobering, assuming rumors had reached this far.MyJustice of Torensdisappearance.Its own clandestine visit from the Lord of the Radch.Its captains political opinions.Silence, the four Anaander Mianaais clinging motionless to the shuttle hull.You still had your ancillaries, said Mercy of Kalr.Yes.I like my soldiers, but I miss having ancillaries.That reminded me.They arent doing maintenance as they should.The hinges on the airlock door were very sticky.Im sorry.It doesnt matter right now, I said, and it struck me that something similar might have delayed Anaander Mianaais attempts to open the lock on her side.But youll want to have your officers get after them.Anaander began firing again.Bang.Its funny, Mercy of Kalr said.Youre what Ive lost, and Im what youve lost.I suppose.Bang.Occasionally, over the past twenty years, I had had moments when I didnt feel quite so utterly lonely, lost, and helpless as I had since the moment Justice of Toren had vaporized behind me.This wasnt one of those moments.I cant help you, said Mercy of Kalr.No one I could send would get there in time.And besides, it was an open question, to me, whether in the end Mercy of Kalr would help me or the Lord of the Radch.It was best not to let Anaander inside this shuttle, near its steering or even its communications equipment.I know.If I didnt find some way to get rid of these Anaanders, and find it soon, everyone on the palace station would die.I knew every millimeter of this shuttle, or others just like it.There had to be something I could use, something I could do.I still had the gun, but I would have just as difficult a time getting through the hull as the Lord of the Radch.I could put the door back on and let her come in the small, easily defensible airlock, but if I failed to kill all of her but I would certainly fail if I did nothing.I took the gun out of my jacket pocket, made sure it was loaded, pushed over to face the airlock and braced myself against a passenger seat.Extended my armor, though that wouldnt help me if a bullet bounced back at me, not with this gun.What are you going to do?asked Mercy of Kalr.Mercy of Kalr, I said, gun raised, it was good to meet you.Dont let Anaander Mianaai destroy the palace.Tell the other ships.And please tell that incredibly, stupidly persistent sail pod pilot to get the hell away from my airlock.The shuttle was not only too small for a gravity generator, it was too small for growing plants to make its own air.On the aft side of the airlock, behind a bulkhead, was a large tank of oxygen.Right underneath where the three Mianaais waited.I considered angles.The Lord of the Radch fired again.Bang.An orange light on the console flashed and a shrill alarm sounded.Hull breach.The fourth Lord of the Radch, seeing the jet of fine ice crystals stream from the hull, unclipped herself, turned, pulled herself back toward the airlock, I could see it on the display.She moved more slowly than I wanted, but she had all the time in the world.I was the one in a hurry.The sail pod engaged its small engine and moved out of the way.I fired the gun into the oxygen tank.I had thought it would take several shots, but immediately the world tumbled around, all sound cut off, a cloud of frozen vapor forming around me and then dispersing, and everything spinning.My tongue tingled, saliva boiling away in the vacuum, and I couldnt breathe.I would probably have tenmaybe fifteenseconds of consciousness, and in two minutes I would be dead.I hurt all overa burn?Some other injury despite my armor?It didnt matter.I watched, as I spun, counting Lords of the Radch.One, vacuum suit breached, blood boiling through the tear.Another, one arm sheared off, certainly dead.That was two.And a half.Counts as a whole, I thought, and that made three.One left.My vision was going red and black, but I could see she was still hanging on to the shuttle hull, still armored, out of the way of the exploded tank.But I had always been, first and foremost, a weapon.A machine meant for killing.The moment I saw that still living Anaander Mianaai I aimed my gun without conscious thought and fired.I couldnt see the results of the shot, couldnt see anything except one silver flash of sail pod and after that black, and then I passed out.23   Something rough and writhing surged up out of my throat and I retched, and gasped convulsively.Someone held me by the shoulders, gravity pulled me forward.I opened my eyes, saw the surface of a medical bed, and a shallow container holding a bile covered tangled mass of green and black tendrils that pulsed and quivered, that led back to my mouth.Another retch forced me to close my eyes and the thing came all the way free with an audible plop into the container.Someone wiped my mouth and turned me over, laid me down.Still gasping, I opened my eyes.A medic stood beside the bed I lay on, the slimy green and black thing I had just vomited up dangling from her hand.She stared at it, frowning.Looks good, she said, and then dropped it back into its dish.Thats unpleasant, citizen, I know, she said, apparently to me.Your throat will be raw for a few minutes.You  Wh I tried to speak, but ended up retching again.You dont want to try to talk just yet, said the medic as someoneanother medicrolled me over again.You had a close call.The pilot who brought you in got you just in time, but she only had a basic emergency kit.That stupid, stubborn sail pod.It must have been.She hadnt known I wasnt human, hadnt known saving me would be pointless.And she couldnt get you here right away, the medic continued.We were worried for a little bit there.But the pulmonary correctives come all the way out, and the readings are good.Very minimal brain damage, if any, though you might not quite feel like yourself for a while.That actually struck me as funny, but the retching had subsided again and I didnt want to restart it, so I refused to acknowledge it.I kept my eyes closed and lay as still and quiet as I could while I was rolled over and laid down again.If I opened my eyes I would want to ask questions.She can have tea in ten minutes, said the medic, to whom I didnt know.Nothing solid just yet.Dont talk to her for the next five.Yes, Doctor.Seivarden.I opened my eyes, turned my head.Seivarden stood at my bedside.Dont talk, she said to me.The sudden decompression  It will be easier for her to keep silent, admonished the medic, if you dont talk to her.Seivarden fell silent.But I knew what the sudden decompression would have done to me.Dissolved gasses in my blood would have come out of solution, suddenly and violently.Very possibly violently enough to kill me even without the complete lack of air.But an increase in pressuresay, being hauled back into atmospherewould have sent those bubbles back into solution.The pressure difference between my lungs and the vacuum might have injured me.And I had been surprised when the tank blew, and preoccupied with shooting Anaander Mianaais, and might not have exhaled as I should have.And that had probably been the least of my injuries, given the explosion that had propelled me into the vacuum to begin with.A sail pod would have had only the most rudimentary means of treating such injuries, and the pilot had probably shoved me into a bare bones version of a suspension pod to hold me until I could get to a medic.Good, said the medic.Stay nice and quiet.She left.How long?I asked Seivarden.And didnt retch, though my throat was, as the medic had promised, still raw.About a week.Seivarden pulled a chair over and sat.A week.I take it the palace is still here.Yes, said Seivarden, as though my question hadnt been completely foolish but deserved an answer.Thanks to you.Security and the dock crew managed to seal off all the exits before any other Lords of the Radch made it out onto the hull.If you hadnt stopped the ones that did She made an averting gesture.Two gates have gone down.Out of twelve, that would be.That would cause enormous headaches, both here and at the other ends of those gates.And any ships in them when theyd gone might or might not have made it to safety.Our side won, though, thats good.Our side.I dont have a side in this, I said.From somewhere behind her Seivarden produced a bowl of tea.She kicked something below me, and the bed inclined itself, slowly.She held the bowl to my mouth and I took one small, cautious sip.It was wonderful.Why, I asked, when Id taken another, am I here?I know why the idiot who hauled me in did it, but why did the medics bother with me?Seivarden frowned.Youre serious.Im always serious.Thats true.She stood, opened a drawer and brought out a blanket, which she laid over me, and carefully tucked around my bare hands.Before she could answer my question, Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat came partway into the small room.Medic said you were awake.Why?I asked.And in answer to her puzzled expression, Why am I awake?Why am I not dead?Did you want to be?asked Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat, still looking as though she didnt understand me.No.Seivarden offered the tea again, and I drank, a larger sip than before.No, I dont want to be dead, but it seems like a lot of work just to revive an ancillary.And cruel to have brought me back just so the Lord of the Radch could order me destroyed.I dont think anyone here thinks of you as an ancillary, said Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat.I looked at her.She seemed entirely serious.Skaaiat Awer, I began, flat voiced.Breq, said Seivarden before I could speak further, voice urgent.The doctor said lie still.Here, have more tea.Why was Seivarden even here?Why was Skaaiat?What have you done for Lieutenant Awns sister?I asked, flat and harsh.Offered her clientage, actually.Which she wouldnt take.She was sure her sister held me in high regard but she herself didnt know me and wasnt in need of my assistance.Very stubborn.Shes in horticulture, two gates away.Shes doing fine, I keep an eye on her, best I can from this distance.Have you offered it to Daos Ceit?This is about Awn, Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat said.I can see it is, but you wont come out and say it.And youre right.There was a great deal more that I could have said to her before she left, and I should have said it.Youre the ancillary, the non person, the piece of equipment, but to compare our actions, you loved her more than I ever did.Compare our actions.It was like a slap.No, I said.Glad of my expressionless ancillarys voice.You left her in doubt.I killed her.Silence.The Lord of the Radch doubted your loyalty, doubted Awer, and wanted Lieutenant Awn to spy on you.Lieutenant Awn refused, and demanded to be interrogated to prove her loyalty.Of course Anaander Mianaai didnt want that.She ordered me to shoot Lieutenant Awn.Three seconds of silence.Seivarden stood motionless.Then Skaaiat Awer said, You didnt have a choice.I dont know if I had a choice or not.I didnt think I did.But the next thing I did, after I shot Lieutenant Awn, was to shoot Anaander Mianaai.Which is why I stopped.Took a breath.Which is why she breached my heat shield.Skaaiat Awer, I have no right to be angry with you.I couldnt speak further.You have every right to be as angry as you wish, said Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat.If I had understood when you first came here, I would have spoken differently to you.And if I had wings Id be a sail pod.Ifs and would haves changed nothing.Tell the tyrant, I used the Orsian word, that I will see her as soon as I can get out of bed.Seivarden, bring me my clothes.Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat had, it turned out, actually come to see Daos Ceit, whod been badly injured in the last convulsions of Anaander Mianaais struggle with herself.I walked slowly down a corridor lined with corrective swathed injured lying on hastily made pallets, or encased in pods that would hold them suspended until the medics could get to them.Daos Ceit lay on a bed, in a room, unconscious.Looking smaller and younger than I knew she was.Will she be all right?I asked Seivarden.Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat hadnt waited for me to make my slow way down the corridor, shed had to get back to the docks.She will, answered the medic, behind me.You shouldnt be out of bed.She was right.Just dressing, even with Seivardens assistance, had left me shaking with exhaustion.I had come down the corridor on sheer determination.Now I felt turning my head to answer the medic would take more strength than I had.You just grew a new pair of lungs, continued the medic.Among other things.Youre not going to be walking around for a few days.At the very least.Daos Ceit breathed shallowly and regularly, looking so much like the tiny child Id known I wondered for a moment that I hadnt recognized her as soon as Id seen her.You need the space, I said, and then that clicked together with another bit of information.You could have left me in suspension until you werent so busy.The Lord of the Radch said she needed you, citizen.She wanted you up as soon as possible.Faintly aggrieved, I thought.The medics, not unreasonably, would have prioritized patients differently.And she hadnt argued when Id said she needed the space.You should go back to bed, said Seivarden.Solid Seivarden, the only thing between me and utter collapse just now.I shouldnt have gotten up.No.She gets like this, said Seivarden, her voice apologetic.So I see.Lets go back to the room.Seivarden sounded extremely patient and calm.It was a moment before I realized she was talking to me.You can get some rest.We can deal with the Lord of the Radch when youre good and ready.No, I repeated.Lets go.With Seivardens support I made it out of Medical, into a lift, and then what seemed to be an endless length of corridor, and then, suddenly, a tremendous open space, the ground stretching away covered with glittering shards of colored glass that crunched and ground under my few steps.The fight spilled over into the temple, Seivarden said, without my asking.The main concourse, thats where I was.And all this broken glass, what was left of that room full of funeral offerings.Only a few people were out, mostly picking through the shards, looking, I supposed, for any large pieces that might be restored.Light brown jacketed Security looked on.Communications were restored within a day or so, I think, Seivarden continued, guiding me around patches of glass, toward the entrance to the palace proper.And then people started figuring out what was going on.And picking sides.After a while you couldnt not pick a side.Not really.For a bit we were afraid the military ships might attack each other, but there were only two on the other side, and they went for the gates instead, and left the system.Civilian casualties?I asked.There always are.We crossed the last few meters of glass strewn concourse and entered the palace proper.An official stood there, her uniform jacket grimy, stained dark on one sleeve.Door one, she said, barely looking at us.Sounding exhausted.Door one led to a lawn.On three sides, a vista of hills and trees, and above, a blue sky streaked with pearly clouds.The fourth side was beige wall, the grass gouged and torn at its base.A plain but thickly padded green chair sat a few meters in front of me.Not for me, surely, but I didnt much care.I need to sit down.Yes, said Seivarden, and walked me there, and lowered me into it.I closed my eyes, just for a moment.A child was speaking, a high, piping voice.The Presger had approached me before Garsedd, said the child.The translators they sent had been grown from what theyd taken off human ships, of course, but theyd been raised and taught by the Presger and I might as well have been talking to aliens.Theyre better now, but theyre still unsettling company.Begging my lords pardon.Seivarden.Why did you refuse them?I was already planning to destroy them, said the child.Anaander Mianaai.I had begun to marshal the resources I thought Id need.I thought theyd gotten wind of my plans and were frightened enough to want to make peace.I thought they were showing weakness.She laughed, bitter and regretful, odd to hear in such a young voice.But Anaander Mianaai was hardly young.I opened my eyes.Seivarden knelt beside my chair.A child of about five or six sat cross legged on the grass in front of me, dressed all in black, a pastry in one hand, and the contents of my luggage spread around her.Youre awake.You got icing on my icons, I accused.Theyre beautiful.She picked up the disk of the smaller one, triggered it.The image sprang forth, jeweled and enameled, the knife in its third hand glittering in the false sunlight.This is you, isnt it.Yes.The Itran Tetrarchy!Is that where you found the gun?No.Its where I got my money.Anaander Mianaai frankly stared in astonishment.They let you leave with that much money?One of the tetrarchs owed me a favor.That must have been some favor.It was.Do they really practice human sacrifice there?Or is this, she gestured to the severed head the figure held, just metaphorical?Its complicated.She made a breathy hmf.Seivarden knelt silent and motionless.The medic said you needed me.Five year old Anaander Mianaai laughed.And so I do.In that case, I said, go fuck yourself.Which she could actually, literally do, in fact.Half your anger is for yourself.She ate the last bite of pastry and brushed her small gloved hands together, showering fragments of sugar icing onto the grass.But its such a monumentally enormous anger even half is quite devastating.I could be ten times as angry, I said, and it would mean nothing if I was unarmed.Her mouth quirked in a half smile.I havent gotten to where I am by laying aside useful instruments.You destroy the instruments of your enemy wherever you find them, I said.You told me so yourself.And I wont be useful to you.Im the right one, the child said.Ill sing for you if you like, though I dont know if it will work with this voice.This is going to spread to other systems.It already has, I just havent seen the reply signal from the neighboring provincial palaces yet.I need you on my side.I tried sitting up straighter.It seemed to work.It doesnt matter whose side anyone is on.It doesnt matter who wins, because either way it will be you and nothing will really change.Thats easy for you to say, said five year old Anaander Mianaai.And maybe in some ways youre right.A lot of things havent really changed, a lot of things might stay the same no matter which side of me is uppermost.But tell me, do you think it made no difference to Lieutenant Awn, which of me was on board that day?I had no answer for that.If youve got power and money and connections, some differences wont change anything.Or if youre resigned to dying in the near future, which I gather is your position at the moment.Its the people without the money and the power, who desperately want to live, for those people small things arent small at all.What you call no difference is life and death to them.And you care so much for the insignificant and the powerless, I said.Im sure you stay awake nights worrying for them.Your heart must bleed.Dont come all self righteous on me, said Anaander Mianaai.You served me without a qualm for two thousand years.You know what that means, better than almost anyone else here.And I do care.But in, perhaps, a more abstract way than you do, at least these days.Still, this is all my own doing.And youre right, I cant exactly rid myself of myself.I could use a reminder of that.It might be best if I had a conscience that was armed and independent.Last time someone tried to be your conscience, I said, thinking of Ime, and that Mercy of Sarrse soldier who had refused her orders, she ended up dead.You mean at Ime.You mean the soldier Mercy of Sarrse One Amaat One, the child said, grinning as if at a particularly delightful memory.I have never been dressed down like that in my long life.She cursed me at the end of it, and tossed her poison back like it was arrack.Poison.You didnt shoot her?Gunshot wounds make such a mess, the child said, still grinning.Which reminds me.She reached beside herself and brushed the air with one small gloved hand.Suddenly a box sat there, light suckingly black.Citizen Seivarden.Seivarden leaned forward, took the box.Im well aware, said Anaander Mianaai, that you werent speaking metaphorically when you said your anger had to be armed to mean anything.I wasnt either, when I said my conscience should be.Just so you know I mean what Im saying.And just so you dont do anything foolish out of ignorance, I need to explain just what it is you have.You know how it works?But shed had the others for a thousand years.More than enough time to figure it out.To a point.Anaander Mianaai smiled wryly.A bullet, as Im sure you already know, does what it does because the gun its fired from gives it a large amount of kinetic energy.The bullet hits something, and that energy has to go somewhere.I didnt answer, didnt even raise an eyebrow.The bullets in the Garseddai gun, five year old Mianaai continued, arent really bullets.Theyre devices.Dormant, until the gun arms them.At that point, it doesnt matter how much kinetic energy they have leaving the gun.From the moment of impact, it makes however much energy it needs to cut through the target for precisely 1.11 meters.And then it stops.Stops.I was aghast.One point eleven meters?asked Seivarden, kneeling beside me.Puzzled.Mianaai made a dismissive gesture.Aliens.Different standard units, I assume.Theoretically, once it was armed, you could toss one of those bullets gently against something and it would burn right through it.But you can only arm them with the gun.As far as I can tell theres nothing in the universe those bullets cant cut through.Where does all that energy come from?I asked.Still aghast.Appalled.No wonder I had only needed one shot to take out that oxygen tank.It has to come from somewhere.Youd think, said Mianaai.And youre about to ask me how it knows how much it needs, or the difference between air and what youre shooting at.And I dont know that either.You see why I made that treaty with the Presger.And why Im so anxious to keep its terms.And anxious, I said, to destroy them.The aim, the fervent desire, of the other Anaander, I guessed.I didnt get where I am by having reasonable goals, said Anaander Mianaai.Youre not to speak of this to anyone.Before I could react, she continued, I could force you to keep quiet.But I wont.Youre clearly a significant piece in this cast, and it would be improper of me to interfere with your trajectory.I hadnt thought you would be superstitious, I said.I wouldnt say superstitious.But I have other things to attend to.Few of me are left herefew enough that the exact number is sensitive information.And theres a lot to do, so I really dont have time to sit here talking.Mercy of Kalr needs a captain.And lieutenants, actually.You can probably promote them from your own crew.I cant be a captain.Im not a citizen.Im not even human.You are if I say you are, she said.Ask Seivarden.Seivarden had set the box on my lap, and now once again knelt silent beside my chair.Or Skaaiat.Seivarden isnt going anywhere you arent going, said the Lord of the Radch.She made that clear to me while you were asleep.Then Skaaiat.She already told me to fuck off.What a coincidence.And really, I do need her here.She clambered to her feet, barely tall enough to meet my eyes without looking up, even sitting as I was.Medical says you need a week at the least.I can give you a few additional days to inspect Mercy of Kalr and take on whatever supplies you might need.Itll be easier for everyone if you just say yes now and appoint Seivarden your first lieutenant and let her take care of things.But youll manage it the way you want.She brushed grass and dirt off her legs.As soon as youre ready I need you to get to Athoek Station as quickly as you can.Its two gates away.Or it would be if Sword of Tlen hadnt taken that gate down.Two gates away, Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat had said, of Lieutenant Awns sister.What else are you going to do with yourself?I actually have another option?She might have named me a citizen, but she could take it back as easily.Besides death, I mean.She made a gesture of ambiguity.As much as any of us.Which is to say, possibly none at all.But we can talk philosophy later.Weve both got things to do right now.And she left.Seivarden gathered my things, repacked them, and helped me to my feet, and out.She didnt speak until we were on the concourse.Its a ship.Even if it is just a Mercy.I had slept for some time, it seemed, long enough for the shards of glass to be cleared away, long enough for people to come out, though not in great numbers.Everyone looked slightly haggard, looked as though theyd be easily startled.Any conversations were low, subdued, so the place felt deserted even with people there.I turned my head to look at Seivarden, and raised an eyebrow.Youre the captain here.Take it if you want it.No.We stopped by a bench, and she lowered me onto it.If I were still a captain someone would owe me back pay.I officially left the service when I was declared dead a thousand years ago.If I want back in, I have to start all over again.Besides.She hesitated, and then sat beside me.Besides, when I came out of that suspension pod, it was like everyone and everything had failed me.The Radch had failed me.My ship had failed me.I frowned, and she made a placatory gesture.No, its not fair.None of its fair, its just how I felt.And Id failed myself.But you hadnt.You didnt.I didnt know what to say to that.She didnt seem to expect an answer.Mercy of Kalr doesnt need a captain, I said, after four seconds of silence.Maybe it doesnt want one.You cant refuse your assignment.I can if I have enough money to support myself.Seivarden frowned, took a breath as though she wanted to argue, but didnt.After another moment of silence, she said, You could go into the temple and ask for a cast.I wondered if the image of foreign piety Id constructed had convinced her I had some sort of faith, or if she was merely too Radchaai not to think the toss of a handful of omens would answer any pressing question, persuade me toward the right action.I made a small, doubtful gesture.I really dont feel the need.You can, if you want.Or toss right now.If she had something with a front and a back, she could make a throw.If it comes up heads you stop bothering me about it and get me some tea.She made a quick, amused ha.And then said, Oh, and reached into her jacket.Skaaiat gave me this to give you.Skaaiat.Not that Awer.Seivarden opened her hand, showed me a gold disk two centimeters in diameter.A tiny, leafy border stamped around its edge, slightly off center, surrounding a name.AWN ELMING.I dont think you want to throw it, though, Seivarden said.And, when I didnt answer, She said you really should have it.While I was still trying to find something to say, and a voice to say it with, a Security officer approached, cautious.Said, voice deferential, Excuse me, citizen.Station would like to speak with you.Theres a console right over there.She gestured aside.Dont you have implants?Seivarden asked.I concealed them.Disabled some.Station probably cant see them.And I didnt know where my handheld was.Probably somewhere in my luggage.I had to get up and walk to the console, and stand while I spoke.You wanted to speak to me, Station, here I am.The week of rest Anaander Mianaai had spoken of became more and more inviting.Citizen Breq Mianaai, said Station in its flat, untroubled voice.Mianaai.My hand still curled around Lieutenant Awns memorial pin, I looked at Seivarden coming behind me with my luggage.There was no point in making you any more upset than you already were, she said, as though Id spoken.The Lord of the Radch had said independent, and I was unsurprised to discover she hadnt meant it.But the move shed chosen to undercut it did surprise me.Citizen Breq Mianaai, Station said again, from the console, voice as smooth and serene as ever, but I thought the repetition was slightly malicious.My suspicion was confirmed when Station continued.I would like you to leave here.Would you.No answer more cogent than that came to my mind.Why?A half second of delay, and then the answer.Look around you.I didnt have the energy to actually do that, so I took the imperative as rhetorical.Medical is overwhelmed with injured and dying citizens.Many of my facilities are damaged.My residents are anxious and afraid.I am anxious and afraid.I dont even mention the confusion surrounding the palace proper.And you are the cause of all this.Im not.I reminded myself that, childish and petty as it seemed now, Station wasnt very different from what I had been, and in some ways the job it did was far more complicated and urgent than mine, caring as it did for hundreds of thousands, even millions of citizens.And my leaving wont change any of that.I dont care, said Station, calm.The petulance I detected was certainly my imagination.I advise you to leave now, while its possible.It may become difficult at some point in the near future.Station couldnt order me to leave.Strictly speaking it shouldnt have spoken to me the way it had, not if I was, in fact, a citizen.It cant make you leave, Seivarden said, echoing part of my thoughts.But it can express its disapproval.Quietly.Subtly.We do it all the time.Mostly nobody notices, except they visit another ship or station and suddenly find things inexplicably more comfortable.A second of silence from Seivarden, and then, Oh.From the sound, she was remembering her days on Justice of Toren, and the move to Sword of Nathtas.I leaned forward, my forehead against the wall adjoining the console.Are you finished, Station?Mercy of Kalr would like to speak with you.Five seconds of silence.I sighed, knowing I couldnt win this game, shouldnt even try to play it.I will speak to Mercy of Kalr now, Station.Justice of Toren, said Mercy of Kalr from the console.The name caught me by surprise, started exhausted tears.I blinked them away.Im only One Esk, I said.And swallowed.Nineteen.Captain Vel is under arrest, said Mercy of Kalr.I dont know if shes going to be reeducated or executed.And my lieutenants as well.Im sorry.It isnt your fault.They made their own choices.So whos in command?I asked.Beside me Seivarden stood silent, one hand on my arm.I wanted to lie down and sleep, just that, nothing else.One Amaat One.The senior soldier in Mercy of Kalrs highest ranking unit, that would be.Unit leader.Ancillary units hadnt needed leaders.She can be captain, then.No, said Mercy of Kalr.Shell make a good lieutenant but shes not ready to be captain.Shes doing her best but shes overwhelmed.Mercy of Kalr, I said.If I can be a captain, why cant you be your own?That would be ridiculous, answered Mercy of Kalr.Its voice was calm as ever but I thought it was exasperated.My crew needs a captain.But then, Im just a Mercy, arent I.  Im sure the Lord of the Radch would give you a Sword if you asked.Not that a Sword captain would be any happier to be sent to a Mercy, but I suppose its better than no captain at all.No, Ship, its not  Seivarden interrupted, voice severe.Cut it out, Ship.Youre not one of my officers, said Mercy of Kalr from the console, and now the impassivity of its voice audibly broke, if only slightly.Not yet, Seivarden replied.I began to suspect a setup, but Seivarden wouldnt have made me stand like this in the middle of the concourse.Not right now.Ship, I cant be what youve lost.You cant ever have that back, Im sorry.And I couldnt have back what Id lost, either.I cant stand here anymore.Ship, said Seivarden, stern.Your captain is still recovering from her injuries and Station has her standing here in the middle of the concourse.Ive sent a shuttle, said Mercy of Kalr after a pause that was, I supposed, meant to express what it thought of Station.Youll be more comfortable aboard, Captain.Im not I began, but Mercy of Kalr had already signed off.Breq, said Seivarden, pulling me away from the wall I was leaning on.Lets go.Where?You know youll be more comfortable aboard.More comfortable than here.I didnt answer, just let Seivarden pull me along.All that money wont mean much if more gates go and ships are stranded and supplies are cut off.We were headed, I saw, toward a bank of lifts.Its all falling apart.This isnt going to just be happening here, its going to fall apart all over Radch space, isnt it?It was, but I didnt have the energy to contemplate it.Maybe you think you can stand aside and watch everything happen.But I dont really think you can.No.If I could, I wouldnt have been here.Seivarden wouldnt have been here, Id have left her in the snow on Nilt, or never have gone to Nilt to begin with.The lift doors closed us in, briskly.A little more briskly than usual, though perhaps it was just my imagination that Station was expressing its eagerness to see me gone.But the lift didnt move.Docks, Station, I said.Defeated.There was, in truth, nowhere else for me to go.It was what I was made to do, what I was.And even if the tyrants protestations were insincere, which they ultimately had to be, no matter her intentions at this moment, still she was right.My actions would make some sort of difference, even if small.Some sort of difference, maybe, to Lieutenant Awns sister.And I had already failed Lieutenant Awn once.Badly.I wouldnt a second time.Skaaiat will give you tea, Seivarden said, voice unsurprised, as the lift moved.I wondered when Id eaten last.I think Im hungry.Thats a good sign, said Seivarden, and grasped my arm more securely as the lift stopped, and the doors opened on the god filled lobby of the docks.Choose my aim, take one step and then the next.It had never been anything else.
