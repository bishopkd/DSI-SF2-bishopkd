He thought he could still feel the other bits of his body, but he wasnt sure.Maybe he was still just a head.A tall, thin, weird looking man with violently red eyes was looking down at him.Robes like something out of an opera.He smiled and he had no teeth.Oh, he did have teeth; they were just made of glass or something even more transparent.Saluus took a breath or two.Just breathing normally felt good.He was still terrified, though.He cleared his throat.Anybody going to tell me whats going on?Movement to one side.He was able to turn his head  neck grating against some sort of collar  and see another bed.Liss was being helped up out of the bed, swinging her long legs over the edge.She looked at him, flexing her neck and shoulders and letting her black hair hang down.She was dressed in a thin esuit.When theyd gone to bed, shed been naked.Hi, Sal, she said.Welcome aboard the Starveling invasion fleet.The weird guy with the bad eyes turned, put out his gloved, jewelled hand, and helped her stand by the bed.Well, then.It would appear this is indeed a great prize you have delivered to us, young woman, he said.His voice was weird too; very heavily accented, and deep but somehow abrasive at the same time.You have our gratitude.Liss smiled thinly, drawing herself upright and running a hand through her hair, shaking it out.Entirely my pleasure.Saluus felt his mouth hanging open.He swallowed, closing it briefly.Liss ?he heard his own voice say, sounding small and boylike.She looked at him.Sorry, she said.She shrugged.Well, sort of.* * *  And these gamma ray lasers go up really high!Look!Still just another beam weapon.The mag convolvers more intrinsically impressive.Fassin was only half listening to Quercer Janath as they investigated the Voehn ships sensors, instruments and controls.Theyd just discovered the weapons.Pa!Defensive!Look: Z P surf shear missiles!Full AM!Damn, this takes me back!Never mind that, check the snarl armour.Its only warping over about a centimetre out from the hull, but look at that roll down; easily ten klicks deep, absorbing all the way.Even regenerates to the main pulse batteries.Thats class.They were in the Voehn ships command space, an elongated bubble in the centre of the ship.The ten spine seats were arranged in a V.  Quercer Janath sat in the commanders chair in front, exposed to a giant wall wrap screen showing the view of space around them, with the drifting, very slowly spinning Velpin dead centre.Fassin and Ysul floated within the two seats a row back from the travelcaptain.The seats were too small for Fassin and far too small for Ysul and Quercer Janath.They opened up like a double splay of fingers and were supposed to close on the Voehn inside like a protective fist.A Dweller only just fitted inside when the seats were in their fully open position.The whole command space felt tight and constraining, but Quercer Janath didnt appear to care even one hoot.The chairs seemed more like cages to Fassin.It felt as though he was floating inside the ribcage of some giant dinosaur skeleton.Can we use a weapon on something?Ysul was humming to himself and tending to his own fractured carapace, using his main hub arms to abrade pinch sections of his discus edges closed, then smoothing them over with an improvised file.Always blast the Velpin, I suppose.Its full of people!He had thought that he might find something.He had thought there might be something left to find.Its full of Voehn special forces warriors.In what sense not people?And besides, its our old ship.Something other than a dead, coward Dweller, ashamed enough of being weak and of having looked inside the safekeep box  and of the possible consequences of this action  to kill himself; vain enough to record a message commemorating his idiot narcissism.Outside, the Velpin spun slowly, somersaulting adrift.Their travelcaptain  Dweller, AI, whatever it was or they were  had persuaded most of the Voehn crew to abandon their own ship by the simple expedient of restarting the Protreptics self destruct function and leaving it on until the last moment.Most of the Voehn crew, believing that their own ship was about to blow itself up, had decamped to the Velpin.Those that hadnt, Quercer Janath had killed.It had killed about a dozen, it\they said.Sentimentalist.Well, eleven, to be exact.I know!Lets ask the Ythyn if they can let us have a few of their hulks.They must have thousands littering the outside of that Sepulcraft.Theyd never miss a couple.Heck, these beams attenuate right down; we could probably pick one or two off even without their permission, maybe even without them knowing.Eleven Voehn.Just like that.Eleven heavily armed and armoured special forces warriors.With no injury to itself.No time.Mr Ysul and Mr Taak wish to return to Ulubis.He heard his own name mentioned.Ah, that would be Fassin Taak the complete and utter failure, sent on a mission, engaged on a great quest, only to find it all just trickles away into the dust in the end, leaving him with nothing.And besides, maybe the Voehn will work out how to work the Velpin after all and ram us or something.I agree.Lets go.Back to Ulubis?But why?Hed failed.Hed been adding up the days and months since his mission had started.The invasion had probably already happened by now, or was just about to happen.By the time he got back, empty handed, after another few dozen days spent getting back to the wormhole in the Direaliete system, there was every chance it would all be over.He was an orphan in a damaged gascraft, with nothing to contribute, no treasure to gift.Why not just stay here with the Ythyn, why not just die and be pinned up on the wall next to the other fool?Or why not get dropped off somewhere, anywhere else?Disappear, float away, get lost between the stars in the middle of nowhere or the middle of somewhere utterly different, perfectly far away, never to be heard of again by anyone who ever knew him why not?That all right with you two?Hmm?Ysul said, sticking some sort of bandage over the injuries to his left discus.Oh, yes.Fassin logged the damage: one working arm, his visual senses degraded to about sixty per cent due to the whateverness of weird shit that Quercer Janath had unleashed in the chamber when it had killed the first three Voehn, and a variety of subtle but seemingly self irreparable damage caused by the combination of pulse weapon and stun flechette that the Voehn had used on them in the Velpin.Of course, he told himself, he had to remember he was not the gascraft.He could relinquish it, be an ordinary walking around human being again.There was always that.It seemed a slightly disturbing thought.He remembered the great waves, crashing.Fassin Taak, you wish to return to Ulubis too?Quercer Janath asked.So who knows that youre an AI?Fassin said, ignoring the question.Or two AIs?Or mad?Ysul suggested.The travelcaptain did a shrug bob.Not everybody  GC stuff.Hurrah!the other half said, fiddling with some holo controls rayed out from a control stub shaped like a giant mushroom.Just munitions, or whole?Whole.How wholly splendid.Absolutely.I dont understand, Fassin said.Was there a real Dweller called Quercer Janath and you replaced them, or  One moment, Seer Taak, the travelcaptain said.Then, in a slightly different and lower voice, said, You got the ship?I got the ship, the other half said.Talking to its infinitely confused little computer brain now.Thinks its dead.Believes the auto destructs been and gone.A common delusion.Indeed.I shall leave you to negotiate a return course with our ship shade.Too kind.Now then, Seer Taak, one half of the travelcaptain said.To answer your question: Im not telling you.Ysul made a snorting noise.Fassin stared at the back of the AI\Dweller.Thats not an answer.Oh, it is an answer.It may not be an answer to your taste, but it is an answer.Fassin looked at Ysul, who was using a screen turned to mirror to inspect his bandages.Ysul, do you believe Quercer Janath is an AI?Or two?Always smelled a bit funny, the Dweller said.Put it down to eccentric personal hygiene, or the effects of truetwinning.Ysul made it obvious he was looking hard at the travelcaptain in the seat in front of them.Frankly, madness is more likely, dont you think?Usually is.Yes, but Fassin began.Ahem!Quercer Janath pulled back from the controls they had been hovering over, turned, rose through the gap in the top of the chair spines and came slightly towards where Ysul and Fassin were floating in the splayed fingers shapes of their own Voehn seats.The thickset double discus floated right in front of them.Fassin felt his skin crawl again, felt his throat close up and his heart thrash in his chest.Kill us; its going to kill us!Allow us, Quercer Janath said, to suggest that a real Dweller might not be able to do this.The thing that looked like a portly Dweller split slowly apart in front of them, carapace discuses twisting slightly and disconnecting from the central hub, arms and mantles and dozens and then hundreds of parts of the creature clicking and disconnecting and floating a fraction away from every other bit until Fassin and Ysul were staring at what looked like an exploded three dimensional model of a Dweller shaped robot, contained within a gently hissing, blue glowing field.Fassin pinged it with ultrasound, just to check that it wasnt a holo.It wasnt.It was all real.Ysul made an impressed whistling noise.As fast as an explosion in reverse, Quercer Janath slam slotted together again and was whole, turning back and dropping into the commanders seat where it had been busy before.Okay, Fassin said.Youre not a Dweller.Indeed we are not, one of the AIs said.A wild blur of holos and glowing fields filled the volume in front of the creature as it checked through the Voehn ships systems, blistering quickly.Now, if you really want, Ill answer anything I can that you might want to ask.But you might not be able to take the memory back to your own people, in any form.What do you say?Eh, human?Fassin thought about this.Oh, fuck it, he said.I accept.What about me?Ysul asked.You can ask questions too, Quercer Janath told him.Though well need your word that you wont talk about this to people who dont already know.Given.The Dweller and the human in his gascraft esuit looked at each other.Ysul shrugged.Youve always been a double AI?Fassin asked.No, we were two completely separate AIs, until the Machine War and the massacres.Who knows youre not a truetwin Dweller?Outside of this ship, the Guild of Travelcaptains, and quite a lot of individual travelcaptains.One or two other Dwellers that we know of specifically.And any Dwellers of sufficient seniority who might wish to inquire.Are there any other Dweller AIs?Yes.I think something like sixteen per cent of travelcaptains are AIs, mostly double AIs impersonating truetwins.I was not being flippant when I said that it stops one from going mad.Now that we are reduced from our earlier state of grace, being able to talk to just one other kindred soul makes all the difference between suicidal insanity and at least some semblance of fruitful utility.The Dwellers have no problem with this?None whatsoever.The blur of control icons and holographs in front of the commanders seat continued without pause as the AIs took in how the visual displays related to whatever they were pulling direct from the ships systems.Ysul?Fassin asked.What?You dont mind that AIs are impersonating Dwellers?Why should I?You dont worry about AIs?Worry about what about them?Ysul asked, confused as well as confusing.The Machine War barely affected the Dwellers, Fassin, one of the AIs told him.And AIs as a concept and a practical reality hold no terrors for them.Truly, they should hold none for you either, but I cant expect you to believe that.Did you really kill all those Voehn?Fassin asked.Im afraid so.Their remains are floating somewhere outside the starboard midships lock even as we speak.See?The main screen filled briefly with a horrific vision of mangled, shredded, crisped then frozen Voehn bodies, spinning slowly.If one AI  or even two  can do that, Fassin said, how come you lost the Machine War?We were both combat AIs, Fassin.Micro ship brains designed, optimised and trained for fighting.Very thoroughly honed, very specialised.Plus we managed to salvage a few bits and pieces of weaponry from our ships and incorporate them into our physical simulation.Most of our fellows, on the other hand, were peaceable.They were generally the ones it was easiest to find and kill.Survival of the most aggressive and suspicious.We could have stayed and fought but we decided to hide.A lot of us did.Those who fought on did so due to the dictates of several different forms of honour, or through simple despair.The Machine War ended because the machines realised they could indeed fight the biologicals of the Mercatoria to the death  engage in a war of extermination, in other words  or admit defeat and so retreat, regroup, and wait for times more conducive to peaceful coexistence.We chose a somewhat ignominious but peace promoting withdrawal over the kind of genocide we had anyway, and already, been accused of.Somebody had to accept the burden of acting humanely.It patently wasnt going to be the bios.But you did attack us.Fassin had seen and heard and read too much about the Machine War not to protest at such crude revisionism.Nope: stooges, Al impersonating implants, machine puppets; they attacked you.Not us.Old trick.Agent provocateurs.Casus belli.Leave it, Fassin told himself.Just leave it.So the Dwellers took you in?he asked.So the Dwellers took us in.Everywhere?Not just in Nasqueron?Everywhere.Does any part of the Mercatoria know anything about this?Not that were aware.If they do theyre keeping very quiet about it.Which is presumably what theyd keep on doing if they did hear about it through you.Too horrible to contemplate.And the unfortunate events during the recent GasClipper meet on Nasq.only reinforce that horribleness.And there is a secret wormhole network.Well, obviously.To which the AIs have access.Correct.Though to avoid antagonising our Dweller hosts and abusing their hospitality, we forbear from using it to work against the Mercatoria.In a sense we have even more freedom than we did before.Certainly the network we have access to now is bigger than the one we felt we had to destroy.The one you had to destroy?The Arteria Collapse: that was us.Last desperate attempt by in the know AIs to prevent the spread of anti AI measures.All too late, of course.The Culmina had already seeded GalCiv with millions of the false AIs.Which was why the whole Collapse was so paranoid in concept and so poorly executed in practice.The conspirators were hopelessly afraid of the plans leaking to a traitor.Total botch.Fassin felt like his brain was detaching from his body, as though his body and the gascraft were parting company the way Quercer Janath had taken their own shared shell apart to prove they were not a biological Dweller.What hed just heard was the most outrageous recasting of  by galactic standards  recent history that hed ever encountered.It could not be true.So the Dweller List is based in fact.That old thing?Yes, its based in fact.Old fact, admittedly, but yes.Is there a Transform?Some secret which magically reveals how to access the network?Yes.A laugh.I suppose there is, in a sense, yes.What is it?That I am not going to tell you, Seer Taak.The AI sounded amused.There are secrets and then there are profound secrets.Is that what you were looking for?Is that why we came all this way?No comment.My, this must all be frustrating for you.Well, sorry.The blur of images in front of the AIs ceased.Ready to fly.Restraint cradles?Patched, physiology\technology profiles amended, buffering re parametered.Well, then, let us  Oh!Oh!What?I just had a thought!What?We can do this; watch.Quercer Janath used the Protreptics magnetic field convolver system to gently shift the remains of the dead Voehn into a very close, very slow set of orbits around the Velpin and the still attached Dweller SoloShip.There.Isnt that better?Mad as a ghoul, Ysul said.Im injured badly.Get me home.Wow, that was quick; look!That is fast.I thought it would take them a lot longer to override the ship.Close up on a screen, they saw a Voehn warrior appear from a suddenly open lock door on the surface of the Velpin.He raised a handgun and started firing at them.Another screen registered the Protreptics reactive snarl space armour fields soaking up the beam.A pea shooter against a battleship.Time to go if were going.Definite target for something.I say we shoot that smart arse bastard with the handgun.No.Oh, come on!Mistake to rely on software.(Both bits of Quercer Janath laughed uproariously at this. )Shoot the Velpins main drive engines instead.More like it!Targeted.Firing.The ship buzzed briefly around them.On several screens, including the main wall screen beyond the spine seats, they watched the Velpin flare through violently pink into stellar white around its ring of engine pods.The ship broke in two and started to drift apart in a bright cloud of glittering metals.Oops.Ah, theyre Voehn.Theyll probably have it stuck back together in an hour and set off to hijack the Sepulcraft or something.Lets go.The twin AI half turned to look at the Dweller and the human in the gascraft.Were putting your seat restraints on now.Shout if anything feels wrong.The great skeletal spines around him whined.Fassin felt the gas around him seem to set like treacle.Everybody all right?They agreed they were all right.Off we go!The stars swung around them, the ship hummed deep and loud, then leapt away.The shattered remains of the Velpin vanished.They threaded the giant O of the Sepulcraft with their stolen needle ship, just to show they could, and ignored the sorrowful, chiding signals that followed them on their way back to the Direaliete system and its hidden wormhole.* * *  If they had been expecting some sort of ultimatum or an attempt to agree a surrender, however humiliating and abject, however calculated and designed only to be refused, they were to be disappointed.The Starveling invasion hit Ulubis system like a tsunami slamming into a beach full of sandcastles.Captain Oon Dicogra, newly promoted to the command of the needle ship NMS 3304 which had taken Fassin Taak from glan tine to Sepekte more than half a year earlier  she had been promoted when Captain Pasisa, the whule whod been in charge of the ship at the time, had been given a newer ship  found herself and her rearmed craft forming part of the Ulubine Outer Defensive Shield Squadrons.The title was more impressive than the reality: a hodgepodge of mostly small and under armed craft thrown across the peripheral skies of the system in the general direction of the invasion force behind a too thin cloud of what was rather grandly called interceptor material but was basically a spray of rubble, and a few mines, mostly immobile.They were to sit here, waiting behind this so called curtain wall of first defence.Dicogra, along with a lot of the captains  at least at this level  thought theyd have been better going out to meet the invaders rather than sitting here waiting for them to come to them, but that wasnt how the top brass wanted to play it.Attacks on the invading fleet outside the system had been dismissed as being wasteful distractions, and too risky.Sitting here in the line of advance felt to Dicogra about as risky as it was possible to get but she kept telling herself that her superiors knew what they were doing.Even if they were being asked to make a sacrifice, it would not be in vain.Their wing of twelve ships was arranged in a wavy line thousands of klicks long across the likely tactical level course of the invasion fleet components, half a million klicks beyond the last orbit limit of the outer system.Other thin lines were deployed almost all around them, though not in front.NMS 3304 was seventh in the wings battle order, beside the wing commanders ship in the centre of the line.Dicogra was third in overall command after the captain of the ship that was fifth in line.She had, naively, been flattered at first to have been advanced so quickly.Then she was frightened.They were under equipped, poorly armed, too slow and far too few, little more than sacrificial pieces put in the way of the invasion to show that the Ulubine forces meant some sort of business, even if it was a fairly miserable affair in the face of the Starveling Cults preponderance of power.The deep space tracking systems which might have directed the Outer Defensive Shield Squadrons better had been high priority targets for the Beyonder and Starveling advance forces over the last few months, and were mostly gone.What was left of them had almost entirely lost track of the exact disposition of the oncoming fleet when its drives had shut down and it had carried out a burst manoeuvre not far inside the Oort shell, virtually all the thousand plus craft firing their thrust units at the same time and then effectively disappearing, heading their separate ways in a web of directions and vectors too tangled and complicated to follow.The still functioning long range passive warning systems spent most of their remaining time looking hopefully for occlusions of distant stars, trying to see the weave of approaching ships through nothing more sophisticated than watching out for them getting in the way of ancient natural sunlight.Dicogra lay semi curled in one of the ships command pods, hard synched in to the ship, her attention everywhere.She was distantly aware of her crew on either side of her.Counting her, there were only the three of them aboard, the rest of the small ship running on automatics.One whule, one jajuejein, her crew were both new, not just to her and the ship itself but to the Navarchy.They were still learning, more alien to her in their relative ignorance than in their species difference.Shed have wanted another few months intensive training together before shed have called them remotely combat ready, but these were desperate times.A sparkle of hard, high wavelength radiation from a few light seconds ahead announced something  in fact, lots of things  hitting the cloud of interceptor material between them and the invaders, though nothing of any significant size seemed to be impacting.Thats a load of their shit hitting a load of ours, Dicogras wing commander said over the open line of sight comms link.Her own ships close range collision warning systems started chirping and flashing at her.Nutche, her first officer, was in charge of this side of events.She kept half her attention on him as he tried to oversee the automatics and keep them focused.Contacts like very small pieces of shrapnel travelling at significant percentages of light speed were flicking past them, all around.Nothing to do, nothing to attack, she thought.Just sit here and wait.The bitty, distributed sparkle became a bright glitter spread across their forward view, like a shining curtain of light.And a lot of somebody else started to say.Then the link hissed and clicked off.Two of the line of ships disappeared in violent bursts of light: one at the far end, maybe one or two, and    The next explosion filled her senses, seemingly right beside her.The wing commanders ship.Hundreds of klicks away but filling the sky with light.Another flurry of silent explosions within and around the first one, spreading outwards like fierce blossoms of fiery white.One massive explosion, at the far, high numbers end of the line of ships.Distant, tiny but intense eruptions of light all around them announced other wings suffering attrition too.Were just getting wasted sitting here, Dicogra said, trying to keep her voice level.She was really only talking to her own crew; the comms to the rest of the wing and beyond were wild with interference or jamming.Nutche, anything on long range?she asked.There was nothing she could see, but her displays were slightly more abstract and less raw than the data the jajue jein would be looking at.There might be a hint of a target in there that she wasnt seeing to pick up on.Nothing, Nutche said.Cant see anything past this wall of collision light.Another ship gone, matter blasting into radiation half a thousand klicks away.She tried contacting any of the other ships, but failed.Were starting engines, she announced.We might as well die charging at the bastards as sitting here like civilians.Maam!Mahil shouted.Were supposed to hold here!The whule was the one shed have expected to be shocked at disobeying orders.Ready your weapons, Mr Mahil.Were going to find you something to shoot at.Iprotest.However, weapons are ready.Here we go.Dicogra let the main drive rip, sending the ship darting forward, exhaust bright, throwing the craft at the wall of light ahead.Grape sized elements of a sensor group, tearing past with the rest of the hyper velocity munitions, picked out the drive signature immediately and plipped to a following suicide launcher.The one shot destroyed itself blasting a fan of high X ray filaments at the target.Drilled by just three finger thin beams, run through for long enough for the summed velocities and vectors of the ship and brief lived beams that penetrated it to cause the holes to elongate by a few radii, the NMS 3304 took an unlucky hit and erupted in a wild spray of radiation as its antimatter power core burst and blew out, flicking the torn and tumbling remains forward across the scintillating skies ahead and causing the bright hailstorm of collision light to bud briefly with a slow wave of debris hitting from behind.Dicogra was barely able to think anything beyond experiencing a dawning feeling of horror.Nutche, the jajuejein, had time to start the first syllable of the Song of Surrender Unto Death.The whule Mahil was able to begin a scream of fear and rage directed at his captain, though the three predeceased the rest of those in their wing still alive at the time by only a matter of minutes.* * *  Jaal Tonderon watched the war begin on one of the official news channels.She was with the rest of her immediate family, in a lodge in the Elcuathuyne Mountains in the far south of glan tines Trunk continent.The remainder of Sept Tonderon  those who werent more directly involved in the war itself  were scattered throughout and around the town of Oburine, a modest resort filling the alluvial floor of the steep sided valley below the house.Everyone all right?Are you sure?Jaals mother asked.A muttered chorus assured her that nobody needed anything else to eat or drink.They were down to a bare minimum of servants here.They were all having to do things for themselves and for others.The consensus was that this was good for them all in an unironic, camaraderie heavy, mucking in together kind of way, but would swiftly become tedious.Mum, please sit down, Jaal told her.Jaals mother, fashion gaunt in the latest war chic after decades of at the time equally fashionable Rubensism, sat down, squeezing easily between her husband and one of his sisters.All ten of them were crowded into a windowless basement room at the back of the lodge.This was reckoned to be the safest place in the house, just in case anything happened outside.If there was significant fighting in space around glantine, debris could fall anywhere.Venn Hariage, the new Chief Seer of Sept Tonderon who had replaced the still mourned Braam Ganscerel, had decreed that, especially as they represented the most senior Sept, and given the unfortunate fate of Sept Bantrabal, they could afford to lose no more of their people.They had broken the predictable sequence of processing round their seasonal Houses and left the usual stamping grounds of all the Septs far behind, retreating to the high hills bordering the Great Southern Plateau.In a war of the scale being threatened, there were no completely safe refuges, but here was significantly safer than most places.Only deep underground was much safer, and all those shelters were pretty much full of the military, the Omnocracy and the Administrata.Some people and organisations had entrusted themselves to space, fleeing to small habitats and especially to little civilian ships, hoping to hide in the volumes of space throughout the inner system, though the official line was that to do so might be to get oneself mistaken for a military ship or munition and was therefore riskier than staying put on a planet.The disappearance of the industrialist Saluus Kehar in one of his own ships had been used as a warning in this regard, though there were bizarre rumours that he had either been sent on a failed peace mission to the invaders or  surely even more unlikely  that he had turned traitor and joined the enemy.The holo screen display was flat, just two dimensional.Apparently this was to allow more signal space for the militarys transmissions.The uninvolving image, from a camera platform somewhere beyond the orbit of Nasqueron, showed space, on the outskirts of the outer planetary system.It was lit up with a speckled cloud of light, lots of little winking, twinkling glints, flaring up and dying down, each tiny spark instantly replaced by one or two others.So what are we seeing here, Jee?said a disembodied, professional sounding voice.Well, Fard, more slow, competent tones replied, this looks like a barrage of gunfire, being laid down by the defending forces, ahm, discouraging any incursion or infraction by the invaders.Right  Larger blotches of bright white explosions started to spit and spot across the screen.The camera jerked from one to another, then the view switched to another theatre of operations, still backed by the all pervasive faraway stars.Jaal bent to her younger brother, sitting cross legged on the floor by her seat.Theyre never going to tell us the truth, are they?she said quietly.Leax, thin and angular after what was hoped would be his last surge of growth, looked uncomfortable.You shouldnt say that.Were all on the same side, weve all got to support each other.Yes, of course.Jaal patted him, feeling the boys shoulder stiffen as she touched him.No more the days of wrestling and tickling.She guessed hed pass through this stage of embarrassment and awkwardness soon enough.She wanted somehow to reassure him and nearly patted him again, but stopped herself.The screen cut to another mini feature on the splendid morale on board the battlecruiser Carronade.Feel so useless, dont you?Jaals uncle Ghevi said.He was only about forty but looked older, almost an accomplishment in an age when people with the right money could be eighty and look ten.You really want to be out there, doing something.Like surrendering, Jaals father suggested, to various tuts and hisses and a loud, affronted gasp from Leax.Well, he said, suddenly defensive.Jaals father had been increasingly cynical about the whole war since the attack on Third Fury.He was a Seer too and had been due to carry out a sequence of delves in Nasqueron a few weeks after the moon had been attacked.The destruction of the Shared Facility and the increasing pace of the preparations for war had put all that on hold, and he hadnt been chosen as one of the advisory Seers for the Dweller Embassy.Jaal smiled over at him.Tall, well built, blond, he was still the dad shed always loved.He smiled awkwardly back.Modern war, Ghevi said.Even without AIs, its mostly machines and a few highly trained individuals, you see.Not much we can really do.The men mostly nodded wisely.The screen showed familiar stock images of the Carronade firing beam weapons into a group of asteroids, pulverising them.Excuse me, Jaal said.She left the room, having suddenly found it claustrophobic and too warm.She went upstairs and out onto the balcony beyond the sitting room theyd usually have been sitting in to watch screen together.Street lights were starting to come on across the straggled town and the surrounding villages and houses as the light faded from the sky.Some cities, especially on Sepekte, were observing a blackout, though everybody said there was no real point.The air was cold and smelled of trees and dampness.Jaal shivered in her thin clothes and thought suddenly of Fassin.Shed been feeling guilty lately because sometimes now a whole day could go by when she didnt think about him in the least, and that seemed disloyal.She wondered where he was, whether he was still alive, and if he ever thought of her.She looked up above the town and the lines of lights studded across the hillsides opposite, gazing over the trees and the dusting of snow on the higher peaks against the darkening purple sky, and saw the steady stars, and lots of tiny, brief lived flashing lights, sprinkled across the heavens like glittering confetti.She looked away and went back in, suddenly terrified beyond telling that one of the little lights would swell and be a nuclear explosion or antimatter or one of those things, and blind her.Afraid of the sky, afraid to look up, she thought as she went back down to rejoin the others.* * *  Fleet Admiral Brimiaice had been able to watch his own death, that of his crew and the destruction of his once fine ship, coming at him in exquisite detail and slow motion.Alarms and a sound like a high, strong wind filled the thin air.Smoke had hazed the view in front of the main forward screen for a while but it had cleared.Wreckage, some of it still creaking and groaning as it cooled, filled about a quarter of the command deck.Limbs and tatters of flesh of a variety of species types lay strewn around the spherical space.He looked around as best he could.He had a serious puncture wound on his lower left flank, too large for his sap blood to seal.The armoured esuit, which made him look so much like a little spaceship, had saved his life, or at least delayed his dying.Hiss, went the air around him.Just like the ship, he thought.Punctured, life leaking out of it, self sealing overwhelmed.He tried to see somebody, anybody else left alive in the command deck, but all he could see were bodies.They should have been podded up, of course, but there had been last minute problems with the ships shock gel pods  possibly the result of sabotage, possibly not  and so the command crew had had to resort to sitting or lying or floating within high gee chairs.It would have been a fairly hopeless battle anyway, but the fact that they were more limited in their manoeuvring capabilities than they would have been otherwise had made it all the more forlorn.The invader fleet was well within the inner system now, the most obvious sign of their presence a great splayed, curving collection of filaments shown on the Carronades main screen.The enemy ships themselves were still mostly unseen, conducting their commerce of destruction and death with the defending forces at removes of rarely less than ten kilo klicks, and sometimes from mega klicks off.Theyd knocked out most of the long range sensors long before, or their Beyonder allies had.Now the defenders just had glorified telescopes.Faced with camouflaged ships and the tiny, fast moving specks of the smaller stuff, they had little hope of seeing very much of who and what was attacking them.This seemed a terrible shame to the Fleet Admiral.Losing, and dying, was bad enough, but to be swept aside and not even properly to see what and who was doing it was somehow much worse.Out of the dark skies had sailed or sliced missiles tipped with nuclear and AM warheads, one shot hyper velocity launchers and beam weapons, sleet clouds of near light speed micro munitions, high energy lasers and a dozen other types of ordnance, loosed from a variety of distant ships, nearer small craft and uncrewed platforms, fighter vehicles, weapon carrying drones and clustered sub munitions.They had been a decent fleet, the Carronade and its screen of twelve destroyers.They had been charged with making an audacious attack on the heart of the enemy fleet, aiming straight for the great mega ship which the tacticians said was at its core.They had left the inner system weeks before the invasion hit, departing the dockyard hub in Sepekte orbit in secrecy and climbing high up out of the plane of the system, taking much longer to complete this part of the journey than might have seemed necessary, to keep their drive signatures hidden from the invaders.Once under way, they hadnt signalled at all, not even to each other, not until the lead destroyer had fixed the position of the enemy fleets core.They had hoped to dive in, taking the Starveling invaders by surprise, but theyd been spotted hours out.A detachment of ships rose to meet them: eight or nine, each one more than a match for the Carronade, all with a handful of smaller craft in attendance.They had burst formation, spreading themselves so as not to create too compressed a target for high velocity munitions, but it had made no difference.The destroyers were destroyed and the battlecruiser embattled, dying last only because it was slower, lumbering to its inevitable fate rather than racing for it.Brimiaice had known it would end something like this.They all had.All this had been his idea and he had insisted on leading the mission just because he knew how unlikely it was to succeed.Hed have preferred the crews to have been all volunteer, but the need for secrecy had made that impossible.Hed anticipated a few problems but there had been no cowards.And if it had somehow, miraculously, worked, why, then they and he would have been numbered amongst the greatest heroes of the Mercatorial Age.That wasnt why he had done it, or why any of them had, but it was true all the same.And even if this wild, doomed attempt at striking the heart of the invaders only gave them pause for a few seconds, it had been worth doing.At least they had displayed some audacity, some ferocity, shown they were not cowed or frozen into immobility or gutless surrender.Another explosion shook the ship, and the seat he was contained within.The wreckage to his left shifted and some twisted bit of metal like a great curled leaf sailed past, just missing him.This explosion felt more powerful but sounded much quieter than all those that had gone before, maybe because the air was mostly gone from the control space now.More felt than heard.Darkness.All lights out, screen fading away, image burned into the eyes but now no longer there in reality, the ghost of it jumping around in front of him as he looked about, trying to spot a light, a console or sub screen or anything still functioning.But nothing.And with the darkness, silence, as the last of the air went, both from the control space and the esuit.Brimiaice felt something give way inside him.He heard his insides bubbling out into the cavity between his body and the interior surface of the suit.Hed thought it would hurt, and it did.He caught a glimpse of light off to one side, and looked up, realising, as the light flared all over one flank of the control space, that he was seeing the framework of the battlecruisers hull structure, silhouetted from outside by some astoundingly bright      * * *  Lieutenant Inesiji of the Borquille palace guard lay outstretched in a little crater like nest within the wreckage of one of the fallen atmospheric power columns, its fawn and red debris lying tubed, slabbed and powdered across the plaza leading to the Hierchons Palace.The klicks high column had taken a direct hit at the plinth from something in the first attack earlier that morning, and tumbled base first, collapsing with an astounding slowness along a course about half its height, finally creating from its circular summit  as it lowered mightily, thunderously, shaking the plaza, the palace, every nearby part of the city  a sudden great torus of dust and vapour, a huge coiling O a hundred metres wide that floated up into the sky, rolling round and round under and over itself as the massive tower hammered into the lower rise buildings surrounding the plaza.Inesiji had watched it happen from near the top of the palace itself, crammed in behind the controls of a pulse gun hidden behind camo net hundreds of metres above where the great cloud of wreckage fell.His human and whule comrades lay around him, fallen around the three long, tensioned legs of the gun.The invaders had used neutron weapons, bombs and beams, killing almost all the other biologicals in the vicinity.Jajuejein were not so easy to kill.Not that quickly, anyway.Inesiji was suffering and seizing up, and would die within a few days no matter what, but he could still function.The Starvelings wanted the palace intact, hence the weapon choice.They would have to touch ground, send in the troops, to accomplish their symbolic goal.At last some vulnerability, a chance to inflict some real casualties, restore honour.When the first gun platforms buzzed through, the lieutenant had ignored them.One drone machine had hummed right past his position, hesitated, then moved on.Spotting the dead, senses not calibrated for jajuejein.When the first landers had arrived, setting down in the rubble  and corpse strewn plaza, still Inesiji held off.Four, five, six machines landed, disgorging heavily armed and armoured troops, many made huge in exoskeletons.When a larger, grander looking machine landed behind the first wave, Inesiji had set the pulse gun to max, disabled the safety buffers and let rip, pouring fire down into the large craft, spreading it to the smaller landers and then setting the gun to movement automatic and scrambling and rolling away down the long curved gallery with just his hand weapon before the returning fire had sliced into the position seconds later, ripping a twenty metre hole out of the side of the great spherical building.He could see the hole from here, down amongst the wreckage of the fallen atmospheric power column.It had not long since stopped smoking.Hours had passed.Hed killed another dozen or so, shot down two landers, firing once from each position in the wreckage and the surrounding buildings, then quickly moving.Their problem was that they thought they were looking for a human.A jajuejein, especially one out of uniform or clothing, spreading himself out across some debris, didnt look to them like a soldier ought to look; he looked like a bunch of fallen metallic twigs, or a tangle of electrical cabling.One trooper in an exoskeleton had died when he walked right up to Inesiji to take the gun he could see lying in the wreckage, tangled in some sort of netting, not realising that the netting was Inesiji.The gun must have seemed alive, rising up of its own accord to shoot the astonished trooper in the head.But now Inesiji wasnt feeling too good.The radiation damage was getting through to him.He was starting to seize up.Night was coming down and he didnt think hed see the morning.Smoke drifted from the city, and there were flashes overhead and at ground level.Gunfire, booms, all hollow, rolling and empty sounding.He heard the heavy tramp tramp tramp of another exoskeleton nearby, over the lip of the little crater nest.Getting closer.He looked one last time at the hole in the vast, sunset tinged face of the spherical palace, raised himself slowly to see where the exoskeleton was, and died in a lancework of laser filaments fired from a gun platform a hundred metres above.* * *  The great glittering ship, skinned in gold and platinum, was half a kilometre across, a slightly smaller  and mobile  version of the Hierchons Palace in Borquille.It sank slowly down through the first high haze layer and the cloud tops beneath like some vast and shining seed.The small, sharp, dartlike shapes of its escort vessels carved courses around it, swinging to and fro, insectile.A craft like a silvery Dreadnought rose out of the cloud layers beneath, a kilometre off, and held altitude.The descending golden ship drew slowly to a stop level with the smaller vessel.The silver ship signalled the golden one, asking it to identify itself.The Dweller crafts crew heard an obviously synthesised but powerful voice say, Iam the Hierchon Ormilla, ruler of the Ulubine Mercatoria and leader of the Ulubine Mercatorial Government in Exile.This is my ship, the State Barge Creumel.Myself, my staff and family seek temporary sanctuary and shelter here.Welcome to Nasqueron, Hierchon Ormilla.* * *  How they treating you, Sal?Liss had come to visit Saluus in his cell, deep in the bowels of the Luseferous VII.A thin, tough, transparent membrane extended from the door surround like a bubble and preceded her into the cell, where Sal sat at a small wall moulded desk, reading from a screen.Theyre treating me well enough, he told her.The membrane gave their voices, as heard by the other, an oddly distant quality.Sal stood up.You?Me?Im a fucking hero, Sal.She shrugged.Heroine.She nodded at the screen.What you watching?Reading up on the glorious history of the Starveling Cult under its illustrious leader, the Archimandrite Luseferous.Uh huh.Tell me it wasnt all planned out, Liss.It wasnt all planned out, Saluus.Liss your real name?Whats real?It wasnt planned out, was it?I mean, kidnapping me.Course not.Liss dropped into a small seat moulded into the wall by the door.Spur of the moment.Sal waited for her to elaborate, but she didnt.She just slumped there, looking at him.Gave you the idea myself, didnt I?Sal said.I told you Thovin good as accused me of getting ready to run.Been thinking how best to use you for a while, she told him.But it was last minute, in the end.We were there, the ship was ready to go, Id seen you pilot it, knew it wasnt hard.Liss shrugged.Theyd only have requisitioned it and put a warhead in it, used it as a missile.That really the best you could think to do with me?We might have been able to do more, but I didnt think so.Just unsettle everybody by taking you out of the equation.A morale blow, you seeming to go off and join the invaders.Worked, too.Confusion duly visited.So it was opportunistic  Im a Beyonder.Were brought up to think for ourselves.So were you always after me?Was I some sort of target?No.Opportunism again.Great thing.And Fassin?Useful guy to know.Never much use for real spy stuff, but worth keeping in touch with.Led me to you, so it was worth it.Probably dead now, but you never know.Still disappeared in Nasq.Whats happening?In the system, I mean.The war has started, hasnt it?They wont tell me anything, and the screen only accesses library stuff.Oh, the wars started all right.And?Liss shook her head, whistled.Woucha.Some of those ships you built?Taking a terrible pasting.All very unequal.All that stuff about fighting to the last ship?Bullshit, in the end.Space wars almost over.Hierchons disappeared.Is it all just military?Any cities or habs being targeted?Sal held her gaze for a moment, then looked down.I have a lot of people there, Liss.Yeah, youre only human, Saluus, I know.No need to act.He looked up sharply at her, but met an unforgiving gaze.She was still dressed in her slim esuit, coloured a pastel blue today to match her eyes.The thick helm collar round her neck formed an odd looking ruff, making her small head, dark hair gathered tightly back, look as though it was on a plate.Borquilles the only bit of ground been taken over so far, she told him, relenting.That got messy.No particularly newsworthy atrocities yet though.He sighed and sat back in the little seat by the screen.Why are you  the Beyonders  cooperating with these these guys?Keeps you people out of our hair.Us people?The Mercatoria?Of course the fucking Mercatoria.Is that really it?The more other stuff you bastards have to deal with, the less free time you have for killing us.Really a very simple equation, Sal.We attack you because you attack us.Liss slumped in her seat, legs slightly splayed.She rolled her eyes.Oh, learn, man, she breathed.She shook her head, sat up again.No, Saluus, she said.You attack us because we wont sign up for your precious fucking Mercatoria.Cant even let us live in peace in case were seen as a good example.You target our habs and lifeships, you slaughter us in our millions.We attack your military and infrastructure.And you call us the terrorists.She shook her head, stood.Fuck you, Sal, she said gently.Fuck you for your arrogance and easy selfishness.Fuck you for being smart but not bothering to think.She turned to go.Sal jumped to his feet, nearly colliding with the transparent membrane.Did you ever feel anything for me?he blurted.Liss stopped, turned.Apart from contempt?She smiled when he looked away then, biting his lip.She shook her head while he couldnt see.You could be fun to be with, Sal, she said, hoping this didnt sound too patronising.Or maybe that it did.She left before he could think of anything else to say.* * *  Hab 4409 and everybody in it was under sentence of death.So theyd been told.It was hard to believe.Anyway, it might not happen.People reacted differently.Some had rioted and been dealt with either uncompromisingly or savagely, depending on whether you believed the civil authorities or not, some retreated to inebria of various types, some just stayed with those they loved or discovered they would not mind spending their last hours with those they merely liked, and a lot of people  more than Thay would have expected  gathered together in the great park on the far side of the habitats inner wall from the plaza outside the Diegesians palace.They all stood, and all held hands, great lines and knots of people, people in circles holding hands in the centre, joined to long strings of others in straggling lines.From above, Thay thought, they must look like a strange image of a human brain, all clumped brain cells and branching dendrons.Thay Hohuel looked up, trying to see past the clusters of pods graped all along the habs long axis, looking for any sign of the Diegesians palace and the square outside where she and the others had gone to protest all those years ago.She had come here, she realised, to die.She had not thought it would be quite so soon, that was all.She had never forgotten the others, had tried her best to keep in touch with them even when they didnt seem to want to have to recall the old days and their old selves.Shed tried not to be too pushy about it, but shed probably been seen by them as a pain, as a pester.But what youd been meant something, even if youd repudiated it, didnt it?So shed always thought, and still did.So shed been, she supposed, a nuisance, insisting on reminding the others of herself, and through herself of their earlier selves, and, of course, of poor, dead K, who both united them and kept them apart from each other.Mome, Sonj, Fassin and herself: theyd have met up again, wouldnt they?Theyd have had some sort of reunion, it would only have been natural.Well, maybe, if the ghost of K that they each carried with them hadnt forever soured the memories of their time together.Never mind, she was having her own reunion, with the hab and her old self and those memories.When she felt that she was just a year or two from the deserved rest of death, shed been determined to come back here, where her real self had been formed, in early adulthood.The coming war had made her all the more fixed in her purpose; if they were really all as under threat as people said, if all cities and towns and ships and habs and institutions and everything else were regarded as allowable targets by the invaders, then she would face death where it might mean something, somehow.In this habitat, this hollow log of blown asteroidal rock, this rotating frame of reference, she would have come full circle, ready to cease existing back at the place that had made her who she was.She had been many different things in her life, switched career half a dozen times, always finding new things to excite and interest her.She had had many lovers, two husbands, two children, all long since gone their own ways, and while coming here to die had made her feel a little selfish, she thought it would also be doing a favour to all those she loved or had loved.Who among them would really want to see her fade away?They might say theyd want to be there at the end, but it wouldnt be true, not really.So shed come here, to the old Happy Hab  not as happy, not as boisterous or as bohemian as it used to be, sadly  to die.Except shed thought it would be alone, and peacefully, and in a year or two, not with everybody else in the place, violently, just a handful of months after shed returned.The Hierchon Ormilla was in exile on Nasqueron.The new top dog, this Archimandrite Luseferous guy, wanted the Hierchon to surrender.The Hierchon was refusing to cooperate.Archimandrite Luseferous didnt want to antagonise the Dwellers so he couldnt just attack or invade Nasqueron as well  amazingly, it seemed that the Dwellers, chaotic eccentrics and technological illiterates that they were supposed to be, were well able to defend themselves  so there was a stand off.The Luseferous person couldnt go in, and Ormilla wouldnt come out.Now the Archimandrite was threatening to destroy a city or a habitat every day until the Hierchon did surrender properly and gave himself up to the occupying forces.And if he didnt give in after a couple of days, it would become a city or a habitat every hour.There were rumours that Afynseise, a small coastal city in Poroforo, Sepekte, had been destroyed the day before, though with an information blackout covering the habitat for the past three days, it was impossible to be sure.Hab 4409 had eighty thousand or so inhabitants, making it a relatively small space habitat.It was second on the list of hostage population centres, and the midnight deadline was now only minutes away.Still no word from Ormilla after a defiant communiqu earlier that afternoon.A Starveling warship had been stationed near the habitat for the past two days, since the Archimandrites ultimatum had been issued.Nothing and nobody had been allowed to leave  or approach  the hab in that time.A few craft had tried to leave, and been destroyed.No requests to evacuate children, the infirm or the collaborating civil authorities had been listened to.It had even been announced that anybody in a spacesuit or small craft who might survive the habs initial destruction would be targeted in the debris and destroyed.Nobody doubted that the Archimandrite would be true to his word.Few believed the Hierchon would give in so easily.Thay let go of the cluster of hands she was holding  a withered old petal of a flower of the mostly young and fair  and bent, spine protesting, to take her shoes off.She kicked them away and put her hand back in the centre of the circle again.The grass felt cool and damp beneath her feet.A lot of people were singing now, mostly quite low.Lots of different songs.Some crying, some sobbing, some wailing and screaming, most far away.And somebody, ghoulish, counting the seconds to midnight.It came, and seconds later a great ringing shaft of light, blinding bright, cut right through the very centre of the hab, barely fifty metres from where Thay stood.She had to let go of the hands of the others to shield her eyes; they all did.A hot blast of air knocked her off her feet, sending her tumbling with hundreds of other people across the grass.The beam immediately split into two and moved quickly out to the habitats perimeter on each side, detonating buildings, erupting flame from pod clusters and slicing the whole small world in two.The halves were pushed apart by the pressure of air in them and the atmosphere went whirling away into space in a twinned hurricane of gases, debris and bodies as buildings and pods exploded in two great retreating circles of effect making their way down the interior surfaces of the sundered halves, structures ripped open just by the force of the air inside them trying to get out.Thay Hohuel was lifted up by the whirlwind of air and blown above the bubbling, lifting turf with everybody else, towards the quickly swelling breach.In the few seconds it took for her to be blown out into the darkness, she heard herself scream as the air went gushing from her lungs, sucked away to space.It was a high, hard, savage scream, louder than any she could have achieved just with her own muscles; a terrible chorus of pain and shock and fear, wrenched from her mouth and from the mouths of all those around her as they died together, the awful sound of them all only fading as the air bled from her ears into vacuum.A vortex of bodies spun slowly out of the separating halves of the ruined habitat, jerking and twisting and spinning away in two long, scimitared comma shapes like some ballet of galactic design.The images were beamed throughout the system by the occupying forces.The Hierchon formally surrendered the following day.* * *  The Archimandrite Luseferous stood in the nose of the Main Battle Hub Luseferous VII, staring out at the vision filling view of the planet Sepekte and its vast, dusty looking, very occasionally glittering halo of habitats, orbital factories and satellites.The entire outer nose section of the Luseferous VII was diamond film, a bowed circle of breathtaking transparency a hundred metres in diameter and supported by finger thin struts.The Archimandrite liked to come here alone, just to look out at stuff.At such moments he could sense the colossal bulk of the Luseferous VII behind him, all its kilometres and mega tonnes, all its warrens of docks, tunnels, chambers, halls, barracks, magazines, turrets and launch tubes.It was a pity it might have to be destroyed.The strategists and tacticians didnt like the look of the incoming Summed Fleets drive signatures.There were a lot of heavy ships on their way, and the first might be here in weeks rather than the months  maybe even a year  theyd been hoping for.The Luseferous VII, magnificent though it undoubtedly was, represented an unignorable and probably unmissable target.Their best strategy might be to use the great ship as the bait in a trap, their own forces seemingly disposed so that it looked like they were determined to defend it to the last, but in fact treating it as a disposable asset.Lure in as much of the Mercatorial fleet as possible and then destroy everything, including, unfortunately, the Luseferous VII itself.The admiral whod drawn the short straw in whatever competition or pecking order judgement theyd used to decide who had to offer this suggestion to the Archimandrite had looked distinctly queasy when hed outlined the plan, obviously fearing an outburst of rage from his commander in chief.Luseferous had already heard of the idea  Tuhluer proving his usefulness again  and come to accept that if they were not to jeopardise their whole mission here, even ideas as drastic as this had at least to be entertained.So hed just nodded and acknowledged that all options had to be considered.Relief for the admiral concerned.A degree of consternation for the others, who all wished that theyd made the announcement now.They would try to think of other strategies which didnt involve the likely loss of the Main Battle Hub, but nobody seemed too optimistic.Always do what the enemy hoped you wouldnt.Murder your babies.That sort of thing.The logic seemed impeccable.Well, he could always build another Main Battle Hub.Just a lump of matter.Results were what mattered.He wasnt a child.He wasnt sentimental about the Luseferous VII.More worrying was whether even that sacrifice might be enough.They had control of Ulubis system, they had lost only a handful of ships in the invasion and, having captured a few of the enemy craft, had conceivably come out ahead in the deal.However, the Summed Fleet squadrons on their way comprised a formidable force.They had fewer but better ships.It might be quite a close battle, and only an idiot wanted to get involved in one of those.And so near!That had been a terrible, terrible shock.Luseferous hadnt been able to believe it at first.Hed raged and fumed and spat, telling the techs to check and check again.There must be something wrong, there had to be an error.The Summed Fleet couldnt be that close.Theyd been assured it would be half a year  a whole year, even  before they had to face the counter attack.Instead the Summed Fleet was practically on top of them before theyd had time to settle in properly.Beyonder bastards.It had to be their fault.He would see what could be done about those treacherous fucks in due course.In the meantime, he had the counter attack to worry about.Of course, if by the time the Summed Fleet squadrons arrived they had what theyd come for, that might make all the difference.A few weeks to find what they had come for.He had a very unpleasant feeling that this was not going to be long enough.* * *  The ship thought it was dead.Fassin talked to it.Hed hoped they might be able to make the return journey from the Rovruetz to Direaliete system faster than theyd made the outward trip, because the Voehn ship was quicker than the Velpin, but it was not to be.The Protreptic could accelerate faster than the Velpin, but the injuries the Voehn commander had inflicted on Ysul meant the Dweller wouldnt be able to survive the stresses.They went back slower than theyd come out.Ysul lay in a healing coma in an improvised cradle that Quercer Janath had made for him within one of the extended command space seats.They ramped the acceleration up to five gees, coasted while they checked the Dweller wasnt suffering further damage from the stresses involved, took the next smoothly incremented ramp of acceleration up to ten gees and checked again.Finally they settled on forty gees, though by the time theyd worked out that this was safe they were almost at the point where they would have to turn around and start decelerating again as they fell towards the waiting system.Ysul slept on, healing.The AI truetwin gloried in the exploration of the Voehn ships vastly complicated systems and multifarious martial capabilities.Fassin had nothing to do but float in his own extemporised acceleration cradle in the seat next to Ysuls.He wouldnt be allowed to stay there as they approached the wormhole portal; Quercer Janath had found a tight little cabin a few bulkheads back from the command space where he could wait that particular experience out.In the meantime, after some complaints, they allowed him to interface with the Protreptics computer, though they insisted on this being at several removes from the ships core systems, and on him being accompanied by some sort of sub personality of their own.The visits would be conducted in a factor two or three of slowdown, which seemed to suit everybody concerned.At least, Fassin thought, the journey would seem to go quicker.The virtual environment where Fassin was allowed to meet the ship took the form of a huge, half ruined temple by a wide, slow moving river on the edge of a great, quiet, silent city under a small, high, unmoving sun of an intense blue white.Fassin represented as his human self, dressed in house casuals, the ship as a skinny old man in a loincloth and the AI subroutine as some sort of ginger haired ape with long, loose looking limbs, an ancient, too big helmet wobbling on its head, a dented breastplate with one broken strap slanting across its bulbous chest and a short kilt of segmented leather hanging from its skinny hips.A short, rusty sword dangled from its side.The first time Fassin had visited the ships personality, the ape had led him by the hand from a doorway down the steps towards the river where the old man sat, looking out at the sluggish brown waters.On the far side of the broad, oily stream was a desert of brightly glittering broken glass, stretching in low, billowed hills as far as the eye could see, like all the shattered glass the universe had ever known all gathered in the one vast place.Of course Im dead, the ship explained.The old man had very dark green skin and a voice made up of sighs and wheezes.His face was nearly immobile, just an aged mask, grizzled with patchy white whiskers.The ship self destructed.But if youre dead, Fassin said, how are you talking to me?The old man shrugged.To be dead is to be no longer part of the living world.It is to be a shade, a ghost.It doesnt mean you cant talk.Talk is almost all you can do.Fassin thought the better of trying to persuade the old man that he was still alive.What do you think I am?he asked.The old man looked at him.A human?Male?A man.Fassin nodded.Do you have a name?he asked the old man.A shake of the head.Not any more.I was the Protreptic but that ship is gone now and I am dead, so I have no name.Fassin left a polite gap for the old man to ask him what his name was, but the inquiry didnt come.The ape sat a couple of metres away and two steps further up towards the creeper festooned temple.It was sitting back, taking its weight on its long arms spread out behind it and picking one ear with a long, delicate looking foot, inspecting the results with great concentration.When you were alive, Fassin said, were you truly alive?Were you sentient?The old man rocked backwards, laughed briefly.Bless you, no.I was just software in a computer, just photons inside a nanofoam substrate.Thats not alive, not in the conventional sense.What about the unconventional sense?Another shrug.That does not matter.Only the conventional sense matters.Tell me about yourself, about your life.A blank faced stare.I dont have a life.Im dead.Then tell me about the life you had.I was a needle ship called the Protreptic of the Voehn Third Spine Cessorian Lustral Squadron, built in the fifth tenth of the third year of Haralaud, in the Vertebraean Axis, Khubohl III, Bunsser Minor.I was an extensible fifteen metre minimum craft, rated ninety eight per cent by the Standard Portal Compatibility Quotient Measure, normal unstowed operating diameter  I didnt really mean all the technical stuff, Fassin said gently.Oh, said the old man, and disappeared, just like a hologram being switched off.Fassin looked at the ape, which was holding something up to the light.It looked down at him, blinking.What?it said.He disappeared, Fassin told it.It disappeared.The old man; the ship.Prone to do that, the ape said, sighing.The next time, the landscape on the far side of the wide, slack watered river from the temple steps was a jungle; a great green, yellow and purple wall of strange carbuncular stalks, drooping leaves and coiled vines, its bowed, pendulous creepers and branches drooping down to drag in the slow swell of the current.Everything else was as before, though perhaps the old man was less skinny, his face a fraction more mobile and his voice less tired.I was an AI hunter.For six and a half thousand years I helped seek out and destroy the anathematics.If I could have felt such an emotion, I would have been very proud.Did it never seem strange to you to be hunting down and killing machines that were similar to yourself?The ginger haired ape  sitting in its usual place a few steps up, trying to clean its stained, dented armour by spitting on it and then polishing it with a filthy rag  coughed at this point, though when Fassin glanced up at the animal it returned his gaze blankly.But I was just a computer, the old man said, frowning.Less than that, even; a ghost within it.I did what I was told, always obedient.I was the interface between the Voehn who did the thinking and made the decisions, and the physical structures and systems of the ship.An intermediary.No more.Do you miss that?In a way.I cannot, really.To miss something, truly, would be  as I understand it  to experience an emotion, and obviously that is impossible for something which is not sentient, let alone not alive as well.But to the extent that I can judge that one state of affairs is somehow more preferable to another, perhaps because one allows me to fulfil the role I was assigned and one does not, I could say that I miss the ship.Its gone.Ive looked for it, but it isnt there.I cannot feel it or control it, therefore I know that it must have self destructed.I must be running on another substrate somewhere.Fassin looked up at the ape thing sitting a few steps away.Quercer Janath had taken over full control of the Protreptic, cutting off the ships own computer and the software running within it from the vessels subsystems.What do you think I am, then?Fassin asked.What do you think the little ape in his armour sitting behind us is?I dont know, the old man confessed.Are you other dead ships?Fassin shook his head.No.Then perhaps you are representations of those in charge of the substrate I am now running on.You may want to quiz me on my actions while I was the ship.You know, you seem alive to me, Fassin said.Are you sure you might not be alive and sentient now, now that youre not connected to the ship?Of course not!the old man said scornfully.I am able to give the appearance of life without being alive.It is not especially difficult.How do you do this?By being able to access my memories, by having trillions of facts and works and books and recordings and sentences and words and definitions at my disposal.The old man looked at the ends of his fingers.I am the sum of all my memories, plus the application of certain rules from a substantial command set.I am blessed with the ability to think extremely quickly, so I am able to listen to what you, as a conscious, sentient being, are saying and then respond in a way that makes sense to you, answering your questions, following your meaning, anticipating your thoughts.However, all this is simply the result of programs  programs written by sentient beings  sifting through earlier examples of conversations and exchanges which I have stored within my memories and selecting those which seem most appropriate as templates.This process sounds mysterious but is merely complicated.It begins with something as simple as you saying Hello and me replying Hello, or choosing something similar according to whatever else I might know about you, and extends to a reply as involved as, well, this one.The old man looked suddenly shocked, and disappeared again.Fassin looked up at the ginger haired ape.It sneezed and then had a coughing fit.Nothing, it said, to do, it continued, between coughs, with me.On Fassins next visit, the far side of the great, slow river was like a mirror image of the side that he, the old man and the gangly ape were on.An ancient city of stone domes and spires all silent and dark and half consumed by trees and creepers faced them, and a huge long temple, covered in statues and carvings of fabulous and unlikely beasts lay directly across from where they sat, its lower limits defined by dozens of big stone terraces and steps leading down to the sluggish, dark brown waters.Fassin looked over, to see if the three of them were reflected there, but they werent.The far side was deserted.Did you hunt down and kill many AIs?he asked.The old man rolled his eyes.Hundreds.Thousands.Youre not sure?Some of the AIs were twinned or in larger groupings.I took part in 872 missions.Were any in gas giants?Fassin asked.Hed positioned himself so that he could see the ape in the dented armour.It looked at him when he asked this question, then looked away again.It was trying to knock the dents out of its breastplate with a small hammer.The dull chink chink chinks that the hammer made sounded dead and unechoing across the wide river.One mission took place partly within a gas giant.It ended there.A small ship full of anathematics.We pursued them into the atmosphere of the gas giant Dejiminid where they attempted to lose us within its fierce storm winds.The Protreptic was more atmosphere capable than their ship, and eventually, going to greater and greater depths in their desperation to shake us off, their vessel collapsed under the pressure and was crushed, taking all aboard into the liquid metal depths.Were there no Dwellers present to complain about this?The old man looked inquiringly at him.You are not really a Dweller, are you?It did occur to me that I might be running within a Dweller controlled substrate.No, Im not a Dweller.I told you; Im a human.Well, the answer is they had not seen us enter their planet.They complained later.That was only the first of two occasions when the Protreptic was operationally active within a gas giant.Usually our missions were all vacuum.The other?Not so long ago.Helping to pursue a large force of Beyonder ships in the vicinity of Zateki.We prevailed there, too.What brought you to the Sepulcraft Rovruetz?Fassin asked.The flat and flattening chink chink chink noise stopped.The ginger haired ape held its breastplate up to catch the light, scratched its chest, then went back to tapping with the hammer again.Do you represent a Lustral Investigation Board?the old man asked.Is that what you are, in reality?No, Fassin said.I dont.Oh.Oh well.For the last two and a half centuries, uniform time, the old man said, we had been seeking information about the so called Dweller List.(The long limbed ape laughed out loud at this, but the old man didnt seem to notice. )Much time was spent in the region of the Zateki system, investigating the Second Ship theory.Various secondary and tertiary missions resulted from information gleaned in the region.None ever bore fruit in the matter of the List, the Second Ship theory or the so called Transform, though two AIs were tracked down and eliminated in the course of these sub missions.We were summoned from the Rijom system and sent to the Direaliete system some five months ago, then laid an intercept course to the Sepulcraft Rovruetz.I was not told of the reasons for this course of action, the orders covering which were personal to Commander Inialcah and communicated to him beyond my senses.Did you find out anything new about the List and the Transform?Fassin asked.I think the only thing that we ever felt we had properly discovered, in the sense of adding something other than just an extra rumour to the web of myths and rumours that already existed regarding the whole subject was that  if there was any truth in the matter  the portals would be lying quiescent and perhaps disguised in the Kuiper belts or Oort clouds of the relevant systems, waiting on a coded radio or similar broadcast signal.That is what the so called Transform would be: a signal, and the medium and frequency on which it was to be transmitted.This made sense in that all normally stable locations where portals might have been hidden successfully over the sort of time scales involved  Lagrange points and so on  were easy to check and eliminate.The old man looked at Fassin quizzically again.Are you another seeker after the truth of the List?I was, Fassin said.Ah!The representation of the old man looked pleased for once.And are you not dead, then, too?No, Im not dead, though Ive given up looking, for the moment.What was it that took you to the Sepulcraft Rovruetz?the old man asked.I had what I thought was a lead, a clue, a way forward, Fassin told him.However, the creature who might have had the evidence had destroyed what he held and killed himself.Unfortunate.Yes, very.The old man looked up at the bronze blue cloudless sky.Fassin followed his gaze, and as he did so, the old man disappeared.There was something.Fassin sat, gascraft rammed into the extemporised couch in the Voehn ships command space by the continuing acceleration, watching the nearly static, rather boring view of dead ahead shown on the main screen, and he knew there was something that he was missing.Something nagged at him, something bothered him, something half came to him in moments of distraction or when he was dreaming, and then wriggled away again before he could catch it.He didnt sleep very much  only a couple of hours a day in all  though when he did there were usually dreams, as if his subconscious had to cram all his dreaming into the small amount of dream space available.Once he was actually standing in a small stream, somewhere in the gardens of a great house he couldnt see, trousers rolled up, trying to catch fish with his bare hands.The fish were his dreams, even though he was distantly aware at the time that this situation was itself a dream.When he tried to catch the fish  sinuous small presences darting like elongated teardrops of mercury round his feet  they kept flicking away and disappearing.When he looked up, the stream was flowing through a large amphitheatre, and a great crowd of people were watching him intently.At the transition point of the journey, where the Protreptic stopped accelerating, turned a half somersault and pointed its engines at its destination to start deceleration, Quercer Janath spent some time checking that Ysul was still healing satisfactorily.Fassin used the time to explore a little more of the Voehn ship, floating the arrowhead gascraft down the narrow circular access tubes, investigating crew quarters, storerooms and chambers.Camera remotes tracked his every move, the thoroughly internally surveillanced ship making it simple for Quercer Janath to keep whatever fraction of an eye on him they thought appropriate.He found what he thought was probably the commanders cabin, a couple of bulkheads behind the command space.It was the most generously proportioned obviously personal space hed encountered.It looked bare and alien.There was a slightly more comfortable version of one of the multi spine cradle seats he was used to seeing throughout the ship by now, and some representations of coverings on certain walls, plus what might have been carpet designs on the floor.Only the designs existed, painted on or displayed by some thin film technology  Fassin couldnt tell.Similarly, there were no ornaments, just holos of ornaments.Hed heard most warships were like this; cutting down on weight and the possibilities of stuff flying about during hard manoeuvring by having the appearance of things rather than their physical presence.He floated in front of one carpet design that looked like a piece of text, all small, curled glyphs in a network, but could find no record in the gascrafts memories of such a language.He wondered what it said.He recorded the image.Quercer Janath would probably wipe it when they went through the portal, but never mind.The next time he met up with the ship, on the far side of the river there was a massive dark wall, rising sheer and jet from the waters, its summit crowned with crenellations and gun turrets.Further guns poked out of gun ports distributed in staggered lines over the whole top quarter of the huge wall, making it look like the side of some ancient sea ship, only the biggest and most preposterously long one there had ever been, its vast hull diminishing into the distance.The guns were not static but moved in sequence, in waves of what appeared almost like locomotion, making the exposed barrels look oddly like ineffectual oars on some colossally mis designed trireme or an impossible, upended millipede.The ginger haired ape sat nearby as usual.It had a new shield, round and highly polished.It sat looking at it and flicking imaginary specks from it.Sometimes it held it up to see it sparkle in the light, and sometimes it held it up so that it could look at itself in it.Text?the elderly man asked.On a floor display?No, Im sorry, I dont have any memory of that, not stored.If the ship still existed, if I still had access He looked sad.Fassin glanced at the ginger haired ape, but it looked away and started whistling, or at least trying to.Maybe theres some way I can patch through an image I have, Fassin said.You have an image?You have been on the ship?The man looked surprised.After some to ing and fro ing, Fassin having to jog back up the step and through the doorway back into normal reality to set things up, he was able to display the image hed taken.The long limbed ape held up his shield and the image appeared there.Oh, that?the man said.He stroked his short grey beard.Thats something the Commander picked up a long time ago, in the days when he had command of a smaller ship.A translation into Ancient Sacred of something which I believe marks the end of an abomination, an AI.What does it say?Fassin asked.It says, I was born in a water moon.Some people, especially its inhabitants, called it a planet, but as it was only a little over two hundred kilometres in diameter, moon seems the more accurate term.The moon was made entirely of water, by which I mean it was a globe that not only had no land, but no rock either, a sphere with no solid core at all, just liquid water, all the way down to the very centre of the globe.If it had been much bigger the moon would have had a core of ice, for water, though supposedly incompressible, is not entirely so, and will change under extremes of pressure to become ice.(If you are used to living on a planet where ice floats on the surface of water, this seems odd and even wrong, but nevertheless it is the case. )This moon was not quite of a size for an ice core to form, and therefore one could, if one was sufficiently hardy, and adequately proof against the water pressure, make ones way down, through the increasing weight of water above, to the very centre of the moon.Where a strange thing happened.For here, at the very centre of this watery globe, there seemed to be no gravity.There was colossal pressure, certainly, pressing in from every side, but one was in effect weightless (on the outside of a planet, moon or other body, watery or not, one is always being pulled towards its centre; once at its centre one is being pulled equally in all directions), and indeed the pressure around one was, for the same reason, not quite as great as one might have expected it to be, given the mass of water that the moon was made up from.This was, of course,  At which point it cuts off.Fassin thought.Where did it come from?It was used by one of the anathematics that Commander Inialcah hunted down and killed as a kind of memory death mantra, to remove any trace of what might have been in its memory.The AI concerned later turned out to have been one of those also seeking the so called Transform.It was that pursuit which originally gave the commander an interest in the matter.The memory death mantra he had translated and kept partly as a kind of talisman, though I believe he also always thought there might be some meaning to the specific piece the AI chose to overwrite its memories with which might prove useful if he could ever work it out, because AIs were known, as he said, for being too clever by half, and through their arrogance sometimes gave important information away.That was another reason for preserving it and keeping it constantly before him.In his dream, Fassin was standing with Saluus Kehar on a balcony over a volcanic caldera, full of red hot bubbling lava.Were to gas capable a whole load of stuff for Sal was saying, when he paused, cleared his throat and waved one hand.Heck, he continued, turning into a Dweller, but somehow with a human face and without getting any bigger.He floated out over the waves of lava.Idiotic things, little Fassin.I took the original of the beast to a friend and fellow friend in the city of Direaliete.A friend and fellow friend.Fassin gazed at his own hands, to check that he was still himself.When he looked up, Saluus had gone and the river he was standing in had temples on both sides, up steep flights of steps the height of prison walls.Original of what?he heard himself ask.The far side of the river showed a city from the age of waste, all medium rise buildings, smoke and electric trains and multi lane roads full of roaring cars and trucks.They had to raise their voices a little to make themselves heard over the noise.A sweet, oily burning smell wafted over the river towards them.The ginger ape picked its gleaming teeth with a giant sword.Another image?the man said.He looked fit in a lean way and was no longer young.His beard was mostly grey.Let me see.Knowing what to do this time, Fassin showed the man the little image leaf which depicted yellow sky and brown clouds.Obviously the colours wrong, he told the man.I couldnt help noticing.Oh, yes, theres an image there.I see it.I know, but what?And some algebra, ciphered into the base code.At that, the apes long, curved sword came sweeping down and cut the man through, slicing him from neck to hip.The remains gushed down the steps to the river and wriggled away, all silver.Fassin looked up at the great ape.Hey, he said, it was just a  Whos clever?the ape hissed, drawing back the terrible, glittering sword.Fassin woke up shaking.He was in a coffin  hed just hit his head on the inside of the lid.He tried to blink and couldnt because something was in his eyes, surrounding them, surrounding every part of him, filling his mouth and nose and anus Shock gel, gillfluid, the gascraft.Fucking calm down, he told himself.How long you been a Seer again?The Protreptic, the ex Voehn craft en route for Nasqueron, Ulubis via the Direaliete system, under the command of the self confessed twin AI Quercer Janath, pirates and close combat Voehn wasting specialists.They were back under moderate deceleration, on their way into the system and the hidden wormhole.The details of the dream were starting to slip away from him, fish sine waving goodbye through the water.And yet he felt hed understood something.What had it been?Confusing.Something about Saluus, and had Hatherence been in there too?Sals house, only it had been a volcano, then the virtual environment where he met the ship, and it had looked at    In the shock gel, pickled in it, surrounded by it, Fassin felt his eyes go wide and his skin prickle and crawl.His heart spasmed, thudding erratically in his chest.He could do it himself.He could wait until they got back, back to Nasq.and Ulubis, and take it to somebody  if he found Valseir he could just ask him, though he didnt think hed be able to find Valseir  but that wasnt good enough.He had to know.Hed committed the image leaf to the gascrafts memory.Lying there in the shock gel, inside the little arrowhead, he called the photograph up and saw it floating before him.The picture of blue sky and white clouds looked odd to him, half alien and wrong, and yet half familiar at the same time, invoking a feeling of something between nostalgia and homesickness.He blew the image up to the point where it became a blocky abstract of colour.He scanned the whole image for smaller images, found nothing, then started running various routines that the gascrafts biomind held for finding patterns in random data.Had he recorded the image in fine enough detail to find anything hidden in it?Would the hidden data, if it was there, be findable without some other code?He wished he could access the original, stowed in a tiny locker on the outside of the gascraft, but he couldnt, not while he was pinned under this sort of force.Anyway, it might look suspicious to Quercer Janath if he started peering too intently at the image leaf.Because that was where the answer might lie, where it might  just, perhaps, maybe  have been lying all the time.I took the original of the folder to a friend and fellow collector in Deilte, a city in the south polar region, within a safekeep box That, or something very like it, was what Valseir had said.Fassin had recorded the conversation verbatim in the gascrafts memory, but it had been wiped aboard the Isaut.Didnt matter; he had a pretty good memory for detail himself.He hadnt realised at the time what the implication of Valseirs remark was  the Mercatorial ships had tried to mount their raid on the ships in the storm fleet shortly afterwards and things had all gone a bit exciting  but it meant there was probably a copy.Valseir was a scholar, and punctilious about word use and the terminology of editions and precedence.He wouldnt have talked about the original of something unless there was a need to distinguish it from a copy.So there was a copy.There was a back up, and it had amused the old Dweller to have Fassin carry it with him all the time.Well, it was a plausible enough theory.Fassin thought it would be a Valseir like thing to have done, but hed been wrong about the old Dweller before.Dwellers did become set in their ways and predictable, sometimes, given the ages they could live to, but sometimes they just became more devious, too.He fell asleep, the routines running on in front of him, and dreamed of streams of numbers, liquid algebra full of equations and meanings that started to make sense and then  just as he tried to study them and understand them  broke up and wriggled away, flickering to chaos.A soft chime woke him up.He was in the gascraft, in the stolen Voehn ship.The deceleration felt gentler, as though they might be approaching their goal.He clicked to an outside view and saw an orange red sun, dead ahead.The Dweller shaped bulk in the seat ahead twisted fractionally.Fassin?Quercer Janath said.If he hadnt been in the shock gel inside the gascraft, hed have jumped.Mmm?he said.Going to have to put you in your own little cell for the next bit, all right?Yes.I understand.Soon as were at one gee standard.I hear and obey, he said, trying to sound unconcerned.Back in the gascrafts math space, Fassin had a result.There was indeed data hidden in the image leafs depiction of a partially clouded blue sky.It had been there all the time.Hed had the answer, if that was really what it was, with him from the start.It looked like alien algebra.He tried to understand it.It meant nothing.It might mean everything.* * *  The Archimandrite Luseferous had a tight, unpleasant feeling in his guts.He recognised it.It was the feeling that he got when he might have left something too late, or just got something wrong somehow.It was the feeling of being in a game and realising you might have made a terrible mistake a couple of turns or moves ago, of wanting to go back and undo what had been done, right the wrong, fix the error.When hed been a child playing a game against another child and had made a mistake, hed sometimes just say, Oh, look, I didnt mean to do that earlier, I meant to do this and had discovered that even though such behaviour might be forbidden by the rules of the game, you could get away with it amazingly often.At first hed thought this was because he was just a more powerful character than whoever he was playing against, until hed realised that the people this sort of tactic worked against tended to be those whose fathers werent nearly as powerful as his.Later hed become powerful himself, and found that cheating was still a workable tactic.Later still, hed found that he didnt need to cheat.He could make the most awful blunder and never suffer for it because his opponent, guessing what was good for them in the greater context of life beyond the game, would never dare take advantage of that mistake.It was a kind of invincibility.Machines were different; they usually wouldnt let you make illegal moves or take back earlier errors.So you just reset them, or went back to the saved position or a time when the mistake could be unmade.Only this was not a game, or  if it was  it was one in which Luseferous didnt know how you changed the rules or swept your arm across the board or hit the Delete All sequence.Maybe the end of the game was death, and hed wake to find himself in the greater reality that the Truth had always maintained existed.That was a sort of comfort, though even then he didnt want to wake up after a failure.Time was the problem.Time and the fucking Dwellers.The Luseferous VII swung ponderously into orbit around the planet Nasqueron.He watched it from his new flagship, the Main Fleet Combat Craft Rapacious (a super battleship in all but name, hed be prepared to concede).Insufficient time.How had it come to this?If he hadnt delayed so long before starting, if he hadnt stopped off along the way, if he hadnt, perhaps, insisted on full fleet dispositional discipline and yet hed swung into action much more quickly than some democratic or committee based organisation could have, and he would have been mad to leave strongholds intact along his line of advance and and return.And discipline was important, keeping everything together was important.It symbolised loyalty, it betokened military and personal discipline.So there had been no choice, really.Theyd got here as quickly as they could.The fucking Beyonders should have warned him the Summed Fleet squadrons were coming quicker than theyd anticipated.It was all their doing.It might even be a conspiracy against him.Oh, theyd taken part in the attacks on Ulubis when it had suited them, though theyd never been as decisive as they could and should have been.Fucking whining lily livered moralists.Military targets!So they preserved their precious fucking scruples and left him to do the dirty work.If theyd been as emphatic and ruthless as hed been, things might have turned out differently.Instead theyd supported him just enough to bring him here but now that he was where theyd wanted him all along, they were deserting him.Luseferous wished now that he hadnt let the Liss woman go.Hed given Saluus Kehar, the industrialist guy, back to his own people, largely to see what theyd do.Would they believe him when he told them hed been kidnapped?Or not?Jury still out; the Guard had taken him for questioning.The woman whod kidnapped him, and who had asked to take him back personally when shed heard that was what the Archimandrite had in mind, had disappeared before shed even handed him over, probably returning to her Beyonder pals.Stupid to have let a potential lever like that go, but hed had so many other things on his mind, and the full extent of the Beyonders betrayal hadnt been clear at the time.Where were their craft?Where were their invasion troops or occupying forces?They were still staying on the outskirts, still not coming into the system itself, still too scared to commit themselves.Theyd professed horror and disappointment at his destruction of the city and the habitat, and at the way his troops had reacted to some elements of resistance.Fuck them!This was a fucking war!How the fuck did they think you won one?Casualties had been almost disappointingly light; Luseferous couldnt remember a full scale invasion campaign which had ended with so few dead.Theyd arrived in such overwhelming numbers that there had been little the other side could do apart from die pointlessly, surrender or run.Theyd had a bit of luck, too, and the intelligence provided by the Beyonders about military preparations and fleet dispositions had made a bit of a difference as well, he supposed.But basically it was just big guns and plenty of them that had done the trick, and the really impressive space battles hed kind of been hoping for just hadnt materialised.So the system was his, even if the only ground hed trodden personally was when making one brief appearance at a small mansion in the middle of a jungle to accept the formal surrender of the Hierchon.Hed have preferred the symbolic value of the big spherical palace in Borquille, even if it was damaged, but the security people felt there was still a danger from a well hidden nuke or something equally unpleasant, so a house in the middle of nowhere it had been.The Hierchon and his people were being held aboard the Luseferous VII.Let the Summed Fleet kill him if that was the way it had to be.The Beyonders reported that there had been a few engagements with elements of the Ulubine Mercatoria military which had turned tail to run and then encountered their forces.But even there the Archimandrite was hearing rumours that the fleeing Navarchy ships were being allowed to surrender, or even accept a sort of neutral internment, still fully crewed and armed, rather than being destroyed or captured.So Luseferous was alone again, abandoned by his treacherous allies.Theyd lured him here, got him to remove part of the threat against them, and now no doubt hoped that hed take on the Summed Fleet squadrons when they arrived, doing the work they were too cowardly to do themselves.Well, the strategists and tacticians were seriously considering cutting their losses and heading back home again.This would seem ignominious to some, but if it was the best thing to be done then that was all there was to it.Again, hed kept calm when hed first heard this latest galling concept.He wasnt stupid; he could see the situation for himself.Do what the enemy least expected, what they would least want you to do.They might  it was still just a might  set off back for the relative safety of Epiphany 5, far away across the empty regions of space theyd spent all those years crossing.It would be unfortunate, but it might be the best thing to do all the same.Theyd have to leave a lot of ships behind and theyd certainly have to abandon the Luseferous VII  it was too slow and too tempting a target  but they could do it.Theyd leave behind sufficient forces to force the Summed Fleet to first fight within the system and then station some craft there, theyd take only the fastest ships and so have a head start, and theyd hope to lure away the main part of the remainder of the Summed Fleet squadrons  the bit that would be likely to come after them  by sending the Luseferous VII and a small escort screen of lesser ships off in a different direction.It was a horrible thing to have to think about, this running away so soon after getting here and achieving complete victory.But it might be better than standing and fighting when the outcome of the resulting battle was so finely balanced.Or, of course, they could find what they had really come for.This Dweller List key, this Transform, this magic formula.With that in his possession, Luseferous would have a bargaining counter of almost infinite value.So he was told, anyway, and for the sake of their own hides his advisers had better be utterly spot on right with this one.Literally.Hed have the fuckers skinned alive if theyd led him all this way for nothing.In the meantime, one last throw, one final chance to find what theyd come for.All far too rushed and desperate, but  like all the greatest leaders  the Archimandrite knew that he was at his best when he was under pressure, when the odds were against him and victory was far from certain.Of course, this didnt happen very often to him because he didnt allow it to  always better to win easily  but hed had his share of narrow victories and pressure situations in the past and come out on top, and he hadnt forgotten and he certainly hadnt lost his touch.He knew he would prevail.He always did.Victory was the only thinkable option.He could do it.He just had to be decisive and determined.That was what he was best at.It was almost better this way; with so little time, with just the one chance, there was no question that it had to be an all or nothing, no holds barred approach.There was simply no time to go through all the other more reasonable techniques.Forget playing it calm and quiet, fuck diplomacy, abandon all thought of being reasonable and hoping people would be reasonable in return.Just fucking do it.The Archimandrite had made his preparations as best he could.The tacticians thought the first elements of the Summed Fleet could be hurtling past at near light speed in less than a dozen days, with the rest not far behind.No more waiting.It was now or never.They were in the belly of the great ship.The hideous, swirling, hallucinogenic face of Nasqueron lay beneath their feet, visible through diamond film.The Archimandrite had risked coming aboard the Luseferous VII for this.If there was some attack on it  unlikely, but not impossible, so far ahead of the main part of the Summed Fleet squadrons  then it would almost certainly have to come from above, and the sheer bulk of the vessel ought to protect them.He had the Rapacious waiting immediately underneath the main hull nearby, linked by a short ship to ship.He could be out of his impressively large seat, across the chamber and aboard and away in a minute.To be on the safe side, he had dressed in an emergency esuit, a thin, constrictive but reassuring presence beneath his formal robes.The collar helmet was hidden by his cowl, which, like the rest of his outer garment, was made of tanned Voehn blizzardskin.Cradled against the Rapacious, now that it had been fully checked for bugs and bombs, was the ship that the Liss woman had used to bring the man Saluus Kehar to him.The tech people were very impressed with it.They thought it could probably outrun any ship the other side had.Luseferous would have been more impressed if it could outrun any missile or beam the other side had.They were here for a conference, a meeting ostensibly to discuss how the new regime in power within the rest of Ulubis system might liaise with the Dwellers.The Hierchon Ormilla was present, as was the rest of the surviving Mercatoria top brass.There hadnt really been time to start serious alterations on the Mercatorial power structure, and when hed found that, as the Beyonders had reported, the Mercatoria was disliked and resented by most of its citizens\subjects, but not actively hated by them, Luseferous had left the bulk of the civil authorities in place.The main players had all pledged allegiance to him, apart from Fleet Admiral Brimiaice, whod been killed in action, the Shrievalty colonel Somjomion, whod disappeared and was probably on one of the ships that had run away, and the Cessorian Clerk Regnant, Voriel, whod chosen death rather than what he seemed to regard as the dishonour of recanting his religious vows.Idiot.Luseferous had shot him himself.Hed had some of the people whod been involved in the Dweller Embassy  set up a few months before the invasion  brief him on what to expect from the floats.Most of the Embassy people had been killed when the commander of the ship they were in had refused to surrender, but a few had survived.Luseferous wasnt sure he trusted them, though.Three of his own top half dozen commanders were present too.The rest were engaged elsewhere, keeping an armed presence wherever it might be needed and preparing for the anticipated high speed pass through of the Summed Fleets advance units.No Beyonders, of course.They were still in shock from his unconscionable behaviour in the matter of the single small city and a habitat full of artists, weirdos and do gooders.He must tell them hed only chosen the city  whatever it was called, hed forgotten  because it was on the coast and sheltered by mountains, so that he could do his sculpting trick again.That would horrify them all over again, with luck.The  delegates?representatives?whatever the fuck they were  from the Dweller side were an unprepossessing bunch.They looked big and impressive, especially in their giant wheel like esuits, but there was the  apparently perennial  Dweller problem of finding somebody with sufficient authority to speak for a whole planet.Hed learned early on in his career that Dwellers were best avoided.Leave them alone and theyd leave you alone.He wouldnt have chosen to have anything whatsoever to do with the damn floats if he could possibly have avoided it.But he couldnt, so he was doing his best.Present were three Dwellers.All were supposedly as senior as each other, and they were each alone  no aides or secretaries or underlings of any sort, which with any other species would have indicated that these were not serious people at all but with Dwellers meant nothing in particular.They were Feurish, some sort of political scholar who spoke for the great red brown equatorial band they could see beneath them, Chintsion, who was the current chief of chiefs of an umbrella organisation representing all their clubs and other voluntary organisations (sounded insulting, but allegedly their clubs included their supposedly highly effective military) and Peripule, who was the City Administrator of their largest city, though this was not a capital city in the accepted sense, and apparently being voted to be City Administrator was regarded as an imposition, not an honour or a chance to enjoy power.They all had grandiose sounding titles that didnt really mean anything.All they did was tell you how old the Dwellers were.The Archimandrite would have preferred more obviously senior people  if such a thing existed in Dweller society  and more of them, but he had to work with what was to hand, especially given the time constraints.They did have other Dwellers on the Luseferous VII, however  over three hundred of them.Two whole shiploads of adolescents and young adults had been welcomed aboard for an extended tour as part of what sounded like a school trip for grown ups.An alien ship enthusiasts club, apparently.He would never have allowed this normally.Luseferous was fairly certain that he didnt really have the Dwellers full attention.His alien watching experts advised him that the majority of the population of Nasqueron was unconcerned about the small war that had just taken place and the presence of the invasion fleet.In fact, the majority didnt even know what had happened and would be unlikely to care.The planets news services, such as they were, were full of reports concerning something called a Formal War taking place between two of the atmospheric bands.This appeared to be a form of extreme sport played out on a vast scale, rather than what Luseferous would regard as a proper war.They were playing.Well, he would just have to see what he could do to make them take proper notice of him.Suspended over the vast view, the attendees seemed to hang as though about to fall.Above them, on a network of gantries, Luseferouss personal guard stalked in exoskels, the pads of their claw feet stalking with a steady, silent precision.Lets get to the point, Luseferous said after some desultory inconsequentialities had gone on far too long.We want the Seer Fassin Taak, he told the Dwellers.Even more to the point, we want certain information hes supposed to have been looking for.What information?Chintsion asked.The clubs chief was proving the most voluble of the three Dwellers so far.His huge esuit sat cradled in a sling seat poised over the shallow concavity of diamond film beneath, the planets bilious reflected light shining faintly up from underneath him.His esuit was grey, with garish pink chevrons.We are not at liberty to divulge that, Luseferous told the Dweller.Why not?asked the scholar, Feurish.His esuit was a kind of dirty white.I cant tell you, Luseferous said.He held up a gloved, ringed hand.And please dont ask why.Just accept this.The Dwellers were silent.They were probably signalling to each other.His tech people had warned him of this and had attempted to design the sling seats so that the creatures couldnt communicate like that.But as soon as the Dwellers had seen the seating arrangements theyd protested and fussed and started pulling and prodding and attempting to reconfigure their seats and even began rearranging them so that they were in positions relative to each other which they liked better.Luseferous had ground his diamond teeth, signalled to the tech people to help, and waited for the Dwellers to declare themselves happy.Finally they were all sitting in a great circle, the Dwellers and the Hierchon and his handful of advisers forming most of one half of the circumference, the humans and others, including the Archimandrite, making up the other half.We dont know where Seer Fassin Taak is, Chintsion told Luseferous.Last heard of, he was making for a city in the northern polar region called Eponia.Though that is just a rumour.Eponia?the third Dweller, Peripule, said.His esuit was deep, gleaming brown, frilled like seaweed.I heard he was seen in Deilte.Deilte?Chintsion said scornfully.At this time of year?He is an alien, Peripule said.He knows nothing of fashion.Well, first of all, Chintsion began, he has a minder, and  Gentlemen, Luseferous said.The three Dwellers all rocked back as though shocked.The Archimandrite Luseferous is a busy man, the Hierchon Ormilla boomed.Discussions regarding the seasonal fashion ability of cities in Nasqueron might be best conducted between sessions, not during.Little dweller, Chintsion said to the Hierchon, we are, as a favour to your latest batch of masters, and notwithstanding the likely and faintly hilarious brevity of their precedence, attempting to establish the whereabouts of this Taak fellow.The  Luseferous stopped listening.He turned to Tuhluer, who sat just behind and to the side of him.He looked the other man in the eye.Tuhluer held his gaze.Luseferous saw the other man swallow.Still his gaze was held.Tuhluer had never dared to do that before.Luseferous bent fractionally towards him and said quietly, Desperate times require desperate solutions, Tuhluer.The other man looked down, then nodded and started finger tapping signals into his glove.The Archimandrite turned to the front again.A distant thud sounded, followed a second later by another, then another, like a great clock ticking.Luseferous listened to the two Ulubine Peregals, old men called Tlipeyn and Emoerte, trying to wheedle the Dwellers into being more cooperative.The Dwellers gave every indication of being sincerely unable even to understand what the word meant.Out of the corner of his eye, minutely silhouetted against the filthy yellow brown clouds of the planet beneath them, the Archimandrite could see a line of tiny specks drifting off to one side, heading towards the passing cloud tops thousands of kilometres below.Believe us when we say that we are serious, Commander Binstey, his C in C of ground forces was saying to the three Dwellers.Oh, Im sure you are, Chintsion said airily.That does not alter the fact that we may be entirely unable to help you.Commander Binstey started to speak again but then Luseferous interrupted him.Gentlemen, he said quietly, and Binstey fell silent.If I may direct your attention to the view over to one side there.He waved one ringed hand over to the side where the stippled line of specks was moving slowly across the gasily distorted face of the planet.Everybody looked.The Dwellers twisted slightly in their seats.Those present in the chamber with especially good eyesight were already reacting.He could hear mutters, gasps, all the usual expressions of shock.We are serious, Luseferous told the Dwellers.He stood.Do you hear that noise?
