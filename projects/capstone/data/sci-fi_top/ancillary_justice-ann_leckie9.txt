Certainly wouldnt have happened on an ancillary crewed ship, said someone behind Seivarden.Not too big a mouthful for the Radch, I imagine, said the person behind me.I daresayagain I leaned just slightly on my Gerentate accentsharing a border with us this long, youve learned better table manners.I refused to turn all the way around to see whether the answering silence was amused, indignant, or merely distracted by Seivarden and Captain Vel.Tried not to think too hard about what conclusions Anaander Mianaai would draw from my reaction to hearing my name.I think I heard something about it, said Seivarden, frowning thoughtfully.Ime.That was where the provincial governor and the captains of the ships in the system murdered and stole, and sabotaged the ships and station so they couldnt report to higher authorities.Yes?No point worrying what Stationor the Lord of the Radchwould make of my reaction to that.It would fall where it fell.I needed to stay calm.Thats beside the point, answered Rose and Azure.The point is, it was mutiny.Mutiny winked at, but one cant make a plain statement of fact about the dangers of promoting the ill bred and vulgar to positions of authority, or policies that encourage the most vile sort of behavior, and even undermine everything civilization has always stood for, without losing business contacts or promotions.You must be very brave, then, to speak so, I observed.But I was sure Rose and Azure wasnt particularly brave.She spoke as she did because she could do so without danger to herself.Calm.I could control my breathing, keep it smooth and regular.My skin was too dark to show a flush, but Station would see the temperature change.Station might just think I was angry about something.I had good reason to be angry.Honored, Seivarden said abruptly.From the set of her jaw and shoulders, she was suppressing an urge to cross her arms.Would be, quite soon, in one of those silently facing the wall moods.Well be late to our next engagement.She rose, more abruptly than was strictly polite.Indeed, I acknowledged, and set down my untasted tea.Hoped her action was on her own account, and not because shed seen any sign of my agitation.Captain Vel, thank you for your very kind invitation.It was an honor to meet you all.Out on the main concourse, Seivarden, walking behind me, muttered, Fucking snobs.People passed, mostly not paying any attention to us.That was good.That was normal.I could feel my adrenaline levels dropping.Better.I stopped and turned to look at Seivarden, raised an eyebrow.Well, but they are snobs, she said.What do they think the aptitudes are for?The whole point is that anyone can test into anything.I remembered twenty years younger Lieutenant Skaaiat asking, in the humid darkness of the upper city, if the aptitudes had lacked impartiality before, or lacked them now, and answering, for herself, both.And Lieutenant Awns hurt and distress.Seivarden crossed her arms, then uncrossed them, balled her gloved hands into fists.And of course someone from a lower house is going to be ill bred and have a vulgar accent.They can hardly help it.And what were they thinking, Seivarden continued, to have a conversation like that.In a tea shop.On a palace station.I mean, not just when we were young and provincials are vulgar but the aptitudes are corrupt?The military is badly mismanaged?I didnt speak, but she answered as though I had.Oh, of course, everyone complains things are mismanaged.But not like that.Whats going on?Dont ask me.Though of course I knewor thought I did.And wondered again what it meant that Rose and Azure, and others there, had felt so freely able to speak as they had.Which Anaander Mianaai might hold an advantage here?Though such free speaking might only mean the Lord of the Radch preferred to let her enemies identify themselves clearly and unambiguously.And have you always been in favor of the ill bred testing into high positions?I asked, knowing she hadnt.Realizing, suddenly, that if Station had never met anyone from the Gerentate, Anaander Mianaai very possibly had.Why had that not occurred to me before?Something programmed into my ship mind, invisible to me until now, or just the limitations of this one small brain remaining to me?I might have deceived Station, and everyone else here, but I had not for a moment deceived the Lord of the Radch.She had certainly known from the instant I set foot on the palace docks that I was not what I said I was.It would fall where it fell, I told myself.I thought about what you told me, about Ime, Seivarden said, as though it answered my question.Oblivious to my renewed distress.I dont know if that unit leader did the right thing.But I dont know what the right thing to do would have been.And I dont know if Id have had the courage to die for that right thing if I knew what it was.I mean She paused.I mean, Id like to think I would.There was a time Id have been sure I would.But I cant even She trailed off, her voice shaking slightly.She seemed on the verge of breaking into tears, like the Seivarden of a year ago, nearly any feelings at all too raw for her to handle.That sustained politeness, back in the tea shop, must have been the result of considerable effort.I hadnt paid much attention to the people passing us as we walked.But now something struck me as wrong.I was suddenly aware of the location and direction of the people around us.Something indefinite troubled me, something about the way certain people moved.At least four people were watching us, surreptitiously.Had no doubt been following us, and I had not noticed until now.This had to be new, surely.I would have noticed if I had been followed from the moment Id stepped onto the docks.I was sure I would have.Station had certainly seen my startlement back in the tea shop, when Rose and Azure had said, Justice of Toren.Station would certainly have wondered why I had reacted the way I had.Would certainly have begun to watch me even more closely than it had been.Still, Station didnt need to have me followed to watch me.This was not merely observation.This was not Station.I had never been given to panic.I would not panic now.This throw was mine, and if I had miscalculated slightly the trajectory of one piece, I had not miscalculated the others.Keeping my voice very, very even I said to Seivarden, Well be early for the inspector supervisor.Do we have to go to that Awers?Seivarden asked.I think we should.Having said it, immediately wishing I hadnt.I didnt want to see Skaaiat Awer, not now, not in this state.Maybe we shouldnt, said Seivarden.Maybe we should go back to the room.You can meditate or pray or whatever it is, and then we can have supper and listen to some music.I think that would be better.She was worried about me.Clearly she was.And she was right, back to the room would be better.I would have a chance to calm down, to take stock.And Anaander Mianaai would have a chance to make me disappear with no one watching, no one the wiser.The inspector supervisors, I said.Yes, honored, Seivarden replied, subdued.Skaaiat Awers quarters were their own small maze of corridors and rooms.She lived there with a collection of dock inspectors and clients and even clients of clients.She was certainly not Awers only presence here, and the house would have had its own quarters elsewhere on the station, but Skaaiat evidently preferred this arrangement.Eccentric, but that was expected of any Awer.Though as with so many Awers, there was a practical edge to her eccentricitywe were very near the docks here.A servant admitted us, escorted us to a sitting room floored with blue and white stone, walled floor to ceiling with plants of all kinds, dark or light green, narrow leaved or broad , trailing or upright, some flowering, spots and swaths here and there of white, red, purple, yellow.Likely they were the entire occupation of at least one member of this household.Daos Ceit waited for us there.Bowed low, seeming genuinely pleased to see us.Honored Breq, Citizen Seivarden.Inspector Supervisor will be so pleased youve come.Do please sit.She gestured to the chairs spread around.Will you have tea?Or are you full up?I know you had another engagement today.Tea would be nice, thank you, I said.Neither I nor Seivarden had actually drunk any at Captain Vels gathering.But I didnt want to sit.All the chairs looked as though theyd impede my freedom of movement if I was attacked and had to defend myself.Breq?Seivarden, voice very quiet.Concerned.She could see something was wrong, but she couldnt discreetly ask what it was.Daos Ceit handed me a bowl of tea, smiling, to all appearances sincerely.Oblivious, it seemed, to the state of tension I was in, which was so obvious to Seivarden.How had I not recognized her the moment Id seen her?Not immediately identified her Orsian accent?How had I not realized I couldnt possibly deceive Anaander Mianaai for more than the smallest instant?I couldnt stand through this, not courteously.I would have to choose a seat.None of the available chairs was tenable.But I was more dangerous than nearly anyone here realized, even sitting.I still had the gun, a reassuring pressure against my ribs, under my jacket.I still had the attention of Station, of all of Anaander Mianaai, yes, and that was what I had wanted.This was still my game.It was.Choose a seat.The omens will fall where they fall.Before I could make myself sit, Skaaiat Awer came into the room.As modestly jeweled as when she was working, but Id seen the pale yellow fabric of her elegantly cut jacket on a bolt at that expensive clothiers shop.On her right sleeve cuff that cheap, machine stamped gold tag flashed.She bowed.Honored Breq.Citizen Seivarden.How good to see you both.I see Adjunct Ceit has given you tea.Seivarden and I acknowledged this with polite gestures.Let me say, before anyone else arrives, that Im hoping youll both stay to supper.You tried to warn us yesterday, didnt you?asked Seivarden.Seivarden, I began.Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat raised one elegantly yellow gloved hand.Its all right, honored.I knew Captain Vel prided herself on being old fashioned.On knowing how much better things were when children respected their elders and good taste and refined manners were the rule.All familiar enough, Im sure you heard such talk a thousand years ago, citizen.Seivarden gave a small, acknowledging ha.Im sure you heard all about how Radchaai have a duty to bring civilization to humanity.And that ancillaries are far more efficient for that purpose than human soldiers.Well, as to that, said Seivarden, Id say they are.Of course you would.Skaaiat showed a small flash of anger.Seivarden probably couldnt see it, didnt know her well enough.You probably dont know, citizen, that I commanded human troops during an annexation myself.Seivarden hadnt known that.Her surprise was obvious.I had known, of course.My lack of surprise would be obvious to Station.To Anaander Mianaai.There was no point in worrying about it.Its true, Skaaiat continued, that you dont have to pay ancillaries, and they never have personal problems.They do whatever you ask them to, without any sort of complaint or comment, and they do it well and completely.And that wasnt true of my human troops.And most of my soldiers were good people, but its so easy, isnt it, to decide the people youre fighting arent really human.Or maybe you have to do it, to be able to kill them.People like Captain Vel love pointing out the atrocities that human troops have committed, that ancillaries never would.As though making those ancillaries was not an atrocity in itself.Theyre more efficient, as I said.In Ors, Skaaiat would have been sarcastic on this topic, but she spoke seriously.Carefully and precisely.And if we were still expanding we would have to still use them.Because we couldnt do it with human soldiers, not for long.And were built to expand, weve been expanding for more than two thousand years and to stop will mean completely changing what we are.Right now most people dont see that, dont care.They wont, until it affects their lives directly, and for most people it doesnt yet.Its an abstract question, except to people like Captain Vel.But Captain Vels opinion is meaningless, said Seivarden.So is anyone elses.The Lord of the Radch has decided, for whatever reason.And its foolish to go around saying anything against it.She might decide otherwise, if persuaded, answered Skaaiat.All of us still standing.I was too tense to sit, Seivarden too agitated, Skaaiat, I thought, angry.Daos Ceit standing frozen, trying to pretend she wasnt hearing any of this.Or the decision might be a sign that the Lord of the Radch has been corrupted in some way.Captain Vels sort certainly doesnt approve of all the talking with aliens weve been doing.The Radch has always stood for civilization, and civilization has always meant pure, uncorrupted humanity.Actually dealing with nonhumans instead of just killing them cant be good for us.Is that what that business at Ime was about?asked Seivarden, who had clearly spent our walk here thinking about this.Someone decided to set up a base and stockpile ancillaries and and what?Force the issue?Youre talking about rebellion.Treason.Why would anyone be talking about something like that now?Unless, when they got the people responsible for Ime, they didnt get everyone.And now theyre letting a few people put their heads up and make some noise, and once they think everyone involved has identified themselves She was openly angry now.It was a fairly good guess, it might well be more or less right.Depending on which Anaander had the upper hand here.Why didnt you warn us?I tried, citizen, but I ought to have spoken more directly.Even so, I wasnt sure Captain Vel had gone so far.All I knew was that she idealized the past in a way I cant agree with.The noblest, most well intentioned people in the world cant make annexations a good thing.Arguing that ancillaries are efficient and convenient is not, to me, a point in favor of using ancillaries.It doesnt make it better, it only makes it look a little cleaner.And that only if you ignored what ancillaries were to begin with.Tell meI almost said Tell me, Lieutenant, but caught myself in timeTell me, Inspector Supervisor, what happens to the people waiting to be made into ancillaries?Some are still in storage, or on troop carriers, Skaaiat said.But most have been destroyed.Well, that makes it all better then, I said, seriously.Evenly.Awer was against it from the start, said Skaaiat.She meant the continual expansion, not any expansion at all.And the Radch had used ancillaries long before Anaander Mianaai had made herself into what she was.There just hadnt been quite so many of them.Awers lords have said so to the Lord of the Radch, repeatedly.But the lords of Awer have not refused to profit from it.I kept my voice even.Pleasant.Its so easy to go along with things, isnt it?Skaaiat said.Especially when, as you say, it profits you.She frowned then, and cocked her head slightly, listened a few seconds to something only she could hear.Looked questioningly at me, at Seivarden.Station Security is at the door.Asking for Citizen Seivarden.Asking was certainly more polite than the reality.Excuse me a moment.She stepped into the corridor, followed by Daos Ceit.Seivarden looked at me, oddly calm.Im beginning to wish I were still frozen in my escape pod.I smiled, but apparently it didnt convince her.Are you all right?You havent been all right since we left that Vel Osck person.Damn Skaaiat Awer for not speaking more directly!Usually you cant get an Awer to stop saying unpleasant things.She picks now to be discreet!Im fine, I lied.As I spoke, Skaaiat returned with a citizen in the light brown of Station Security, who bowed and said to Seivarden, Citizen, will you and this person come with me?The courtesy was, of course, merely a form.One didnt refuse Station Securitys invitations.Even if we tried there were reinforcements outside, placed there to make sure we didnt refuse.They wouldnt be Station Security, those people who had followed us from Captain Vels meeting.They would be Special Missions, or even Anaander Mianaais own guard.The Lord of the Radch had put all the pieces together and decided to remove me before I could do any serious damage.But it was almost certainly too late for that.All of her was paying attention.The fact that shed sent Station Security to arrest me, and not some Special Missions officer to kill me quickly and quietly, told me that.Of course, Seivarden answered, all calm courtesy.Of course.She knew she was innocent of any wrongdoing, she was sure I was Special Missions and working for Anaander herself, why should she worry?But I knew that finally the moment had come.The omens that had been in the air for twenty years were about to come down and show meshow Anaander Mianaaiwhat pattern they made.This Security officer didnt even twitch an eyebrow as she answered.The Lord of the Radch wishes to speak with you privately, citizen.Not a glance at me.She likely didnt know why shed been sent to escort us to the Lord of the Radch, didnt realize I was dangerous, that she needed the backup that awaited us out in the stations corridors.If she even knew it was there.The gun still sat under my jacket, and extra magazines tucked here and there, wherever the bulge wouldnt show.Anaander Mianaai almost certainly didnt know what I intended.Is this my audience I requested, then?asked Seivarden.The Security officer gestured ambiguity.I couldnt say, citizen.Anaander Mianaai couldnt have known my object in coming, knew only that I had disappeared some twenty years ago.Part of her might know that shed been aboard my last voyage, but none of her could know what had happened after Id gated out of Shisurnas system.I did ask, said Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat, if you might have tea and supper first.The fact shed asked said something about her relationship with Security.The fact shed been refused said something about the urgency behind this arrestit was an arrest, I was sure.Security, oblivious, made an apologetic gesture.My orders, Inspector Supervisor.Citizen.Of course, said Skaaiat, smooth and unruffled, but I knew her, heard worry hidden in her voice.Citizen Seivarden.Honored Breq.If theres any assistance I can provide please dont hesitate to call on me.Thank you, Inspector Supervisor, I said, and bowed.My fear and uncertainty, my near panic, drained away.The omen Stillness had flipped, become Movement.And Justice was about to land before me, clear and unambiguous.The Security officer escorted us not to the main entrance of the palace proper, but into the temple, quiet at this hour when many people were visiting, or sitting home with family and a bowl of tea.A young priest sat behind the now half empty baskets of flowers, bored and sullen.She gave us a resentful glance as we entered, but didnt even turn her head as we passed.We went through the main hall, four armed Amaat looming, the air still smelling of incense and the heap of flowers at the gods feet and knees, back to a tiny chapel tucked into a corner, dedicated to an old and now obscure provincial god, one of those personifications of abstract concepts so many pantheons hold, in this case a deification of legitimate political authority.No doubt when the palace had been built there had been no question of this gods placement next to Amaat, but she seemed to have fallen out of favor, the demographic of the station, or perhaps just fashion, having changed.Or perhaps something more ominous had caused it.In the wall behind the image of the god a panel slid open.Behind it an armed and armored guard, her weapon holstered but not far from her hand, silver smooth armor covering her face.Ancillary, I thought, but there was no way to be sure.I wondered, as I had occasionally over the past twenty years, how that worked.Surely the palace proper wasnt guarded by Station.Were Anaander Mianaais guards just another part of herself?Seivarden looked at me, irritated, and, I thought, a bit afraid.I didnt think I rated the secret entrance.Though it probably wasnt all that secret, just slightly less public than the one outside on the concourse.The Security officer made that ambiguous gesture again, but said nothing.Well, I said, and Seivarden gave me an expectant look.Clearly she thought this was due to whatever special status she had decided I had.I stepped through the door, past the unmoving guard, who didnt acknowledge me at all, nor Seivarden coming behind me.The panel slid shut behind us.21   Beyond the short stretch of blank corridor, another door opened onto a room four meters by eight, its ceiling three meters above.Leafy vines snaked across the walls, trailing from supports rising from the floor.Pale blue walls suggested vast distances beyond the greenery, making the room feel larger than it was, the last vestige of a fashion for false vistas, more than five hundred years out of date.At the far end a dais, and behind it images of the four Emanations hung in the vines.On the dais stood Anaander Mianaaitwo of her.The Lord of the Radch was so curious about us she wanted more than one part of herself here to question us, I guessed.Though likely she had rationalized it to herself some other way.We walked to within three meters of the Lord of the Radch, and Seivarden knelt, and then prostrated herself.I was, supposedly, not Radchaai, not subject to Anaander Mianaai.But Anaander Mianaai knew, she had to know, who I really was.She had not summoned us this way without knowing.Still, I didnt kneel, or even bow.Neither Mianaai betrayed any surprise or indignation at this.Citizen Seivarden Vendaai, said the Mianaai on the right.What exactly do you think youre playing at?Seivardens shoulders twitched, as though, facedown on the floor, she had momentarily wanted to cross her arms.The Mianaai on the left said, Justice of Torens behavior has been alarming and perplexing enough, just on its own.Entering the temple and defiling the offerings!Whatever could you have meant by it?What am I to say to the priests?The gun still lay against my side, under my jacket, unremarked.I was an ancillary.Ancillaries were notorious for their expressionless faces.I could easily keep from smiling.If my lord pleases, said Seivarden into the pause that followed Anaander Mianaais words.Her voice was slightly breathy, and I thought maybe she was hyperventilating slightly.Wh I dont  The Mianaai on the right let out a sardonic ha.Citizen Seivarden is surprised, and doesnt understand me, that Mianaai continued.And you, Justice of Toren.You intended to deceive me.Why?When I first suspected who you were, said the Mianaai on the left before I could answer, I almost didnt believe it.Another long lost omen fetching up at my feet.I watched you, to see what you would do, to try to understand what you were intending by your rather extraordinary behavior.If I had been human, I would have laughed.Two Mianaais before me.Neither trusted the other to hold this interview unsupervised, unobstructed.Neither knew the details of the destruction of Justice of Toren, each no doubt suspected the others involvement.I might be an instrument of either, neither trusting the other.Which was which?The Mianaai on the right said, Youve done a fairly decent job concealing your origin.It was Inspector Adjunct Ceit who first made me suspect.I havent heard that song since I was a child, shed said.That song, that had obviously come from Shisurna.I admit it took me an entire day to piece everything together, and even then I could hardly believe it.You hid your implants reasonably well.Station was completely deceived.But the humming would likely have given you away eventually, I imagine.Are you aware you do it almost constantly?I suspect youre making an effort not to do it now.Which I do appreciate.Still facedown on the floor, Seivarden said, in a small voice, Breq?Not Breq, said the Mianaai on the left.Justice of Toren.Justice of Toren One Esk, I corrected, dropping all pretense of a Gerentate accent, or human expression.I was done pretending.It was terrifying, because I knew I couldnt live long past this, but also, oddly, a relief.A weight gone.The right hand Mianaai gestured the obviousness of my statement.Justice of Toren is destroyed, I said.Both Mianaais seemed to stop breathing.Stared at me.Again I might have laughed, if I were capable of it.Begging my lords indulgence, said Seivarden from the floor, voice tentative.Surely theres some mistake.Breq is human.She cant possibly be Justice of Toren One Esk.I served in Justice of Torens Esk decade.No Justice of Toren medic would give One Esk a body with a voice like Breqs.Not unless she wanted to seriously annoy the Esk lieutenants.Silence, thick and heavy, for three seconds.She thinks Im Special Missions, I said, breaking that silence.I never told her I was.I never told her I was anything, except Breq from the Gerentate, and she never believed that.I wanted to leave her where I found her, but I couldnt and I dont know why.She was never one of my favorites.I knew that sounded insane.A particular sort of insane, an AI insanity.I didnt care.She doesnt have anything to do with this.The right hand Mianaai lifted an eyebrow.Then why is she here?No one could ignore her arrival here.Since I arrived with her, no one could ignore or conceal mine.And you already know why I couldnt just come straight to you.The slight twitch of a frown on the right hand Mianaai.Citizen Seivarden Vendaai, said the Mianaai on the left, it is now clear to me that Justice of Toren deceived you.You didnt know what it was.It would be best, I think, if you left now.Without, of course, speaking of this to anyone else.No?breathed Seivarden into the floor, as though she were asking a question.Or as though she was surprised to hear the word come out of her mouth.No, she said again, more certainly.Theres a mistake somewhere.Breq jumped off a bridge for me.My hip hurt, thinking of it.No sane human being would have done that.I never said you were sane, Seivarden said, quietly, sounding slightly choked.Seivarden Vendaai, said the left hand Mianaai, this ancillaryand it is an ancillaryisnt human.The fact you thought it was explains a good deal of your behavior that was unclear to me before.Im sorry for its deception and your disappointment, but you need to leave.Now.Begging my lords indulgence.Seivarden still lay facedown, speaking into the floor.Whether you give it or not.Im not leaving Breq.Go away, Seivarden, I said, expressionless.Sorry, she said, sounding almost blithe except her voice still shook slightly.Youre stuck with me.I looked down at her.She turned her head to look up at me, her expression a mix of fear and determination.You dont know what youre doing, I told her.You dont understand whats happening here.I dont need to.Fair enough, said the Mianaai on the right, seeming almost amused.The left hand one seemed less so.I wondered why that was.Explain yourself, Justice of Toren.Here it was, the moment I had worked toward for twenty years.Waited for.Feared would never come.First, I said, as Im sure you already suspect, you were aboard Justice of Toren, and it was you yourself who destroyed it.You breached the heat shield because you discovered you had already suborned me yourself, some time previously.Youre fighting yourself.At least two of you, maybe more.Both Mianaais blinked and shifted their stances a fraction of a millimeter, in a way I recognized.Id seen myself do it, in Ors, when communications cut out.Another of those communications blocking boxespart of Anaander Mianaai, at least, must have worried about what I might say, must have been waiting with her hand on the switch.I wondered how far the effect reached, and which Mianaai had triggered it, trying, too late, to hide my revelation from herself.Wondered what that must have been like, knowing that facing me this way could only lead to disaster, and yet obligated by the nature of her struggle with herself to do so.The thought amused me briefly.Second.I reached into my jacket, pulled out the gun, the dark gray of my glove bleeding into the white the weapon had taken from my shirt.Im going to kill you.I aimed at the right hand Mianaai.Who began to sing, in a slightly flat baritone, in a language dead for ten thousand years.The person, the person, the person with weapons.I couldnt move.Couldnt squeeze the trigger.You should be afraid of the person with weapons.You should be afraid.All around the cry goes out, put on armor made of iron.The person, the person, the person with weapons.You should be afraid of the person with weapons.You should be afraid.She shouldnt know that song.Why would Anaander Mianaai ever go digging in forgotten Valskaayan archives, why would she trouble to learn a song that very possibly no one but me had sung for longer than she had been alive?Justice of Toren One Esk, said the right hand Mianaai, shoot the instance of me to the left of the instance thats speaking to you.Muscles moved without my willing them.I shifted my aim to the left and fired.The left hand Mianaai collapsed to the ground.The right hand one said, Now I just have to get to the docks before I do.And yes, Seivarden, I know youre confused but you were warned.Where did you learn that song?I asked.Still otherwise frozen.From you, said Anaander Mianaai.A hundred years ago, at Valskaay.This, then, was that Anaander who had pushed reforms, begun dismantling Radchaai ships.The one who had first visited me secretly at Valskaay and laid down those orders I could sense but never see.I asked you to teach me the song least likely to ever be sung by anyone else, and then I set it as an access and hid it from you.My enemy and I are far too evenly matched.The only advantage I have is what might occur to me when Im apart from myself.And that day it occurred to me that I had never paid close enough attention to youyou, One Esk.To what you might be.Something like you, I guessed.Apart from myself.My arm still outstretched, gun aimed at the back wall.Insurance, Mianaai corrected.An access I wouldnt think of looking for, to erase or invalidate.So very clever of me.And now its blown up in my face.All of this, it seems, is happening because I paid attention to you, in particular, and because I never paid any attention to you.Im going to return control of your body to you, because itll be more efficient, but youll find you cant shoot me.I lowered the gun.Which me?Whats blown up?asked Seivarden, still on the floor.My lord, she added.Shes split, I explained.It started at Garsedd.She was appalled by what shed done, but she couldnt decide how to react.Shes been secretly moving against herself ever since.The reformsgetting rid of ancillaries, stopping the annexations, opening up assignments to lower houses, she did all of that.And Ime was the other part of her, building up a base, and resources, to go to war against herself and put things back the way they had been.And the whole time all of her has been pretending not to know it was happening, because as soon as she admitted it the conflict would be in the open, and unavoidable.But you said it straight out to all of me, Mianaai acknowledged.Because I couldnt exactly pretend the rest of me wasnt interested in Seivarden Vendaais second return.Or what had happened to you.You showed up so publically, so obviously, I couldnt hide it and pretend it hadnt happened, and only talk to you myself.And now I cant ignore it anymore.Why?Why would you do such a thing?It wasnt any order I ever gave you.No, I agreed.It wasnt.And surely you guessed what would happen if you did such a thing.Yes.I could be my ancillary self again.Unsmiling.No satisfaction in my voice.Anaander considered me a moment and then made a hmf sound, as though shed reached some conclusion that surprised her.Get up off the floor, citizen, she said to Seivarden.Seivarden rose, brushing her trouser legs with one gloved hand.Are you all right, Breq?Breq, interrupted Mianaai before I could answer, stepping off the dais and striding past, is the last remaining fragment of a grief crazed AI, which has just managed to trigger a civil war.She turned to me.Is that what you wanted?I havent been crazed with grief for at least ten years, I protested.And the civil war was going to happen anyway, sooner or later.I was rather hoping to avoid the worst of it.If were extremely fortunate, that war will only cause decades of chaos, and not tear the Radch apart completely.Come with me.Ships cant do that anymore, insisted Seivarden, walking beside me.You made them that way, my lord, so they didnt lose their minds when their captains died, like they used to, or follow their captains against you.Mianaai lifted an eyebrow.Not exactly.She found a panel on the wall by the door that had been previously invisible to me, yanked it open, and triggered the manual door switch.They still get attached, still have favorites.The door slid open.One Esk, shoot the guard.My arm swung up and I fired.The guard staggered back against the wall, reached for her own weapon, but slid to the floor and then lay still.Dead, because her armor retracted.I couldnt take that away without making them useless to me, Anaander Mianaai continued, oblivious to the personthe citizen?shed just ordered killed.Still explaining to Seivarden, who frowned, not understanding.They have to be smart.They have to be able to think.Right, agreed Seivarden.Her voice trembled, just slightly, the edge of her self control wearing thin, I thought.And theyre armed ships, with engines capable of vaporizing planets.What am I going to do if they dont want to obey me?Threaten them?With what?A few strides had brought us to the door communicating with the temple.Anaander opened that and stepped briskly into the chapel of legitimate political authority.Seivarden made an odd sound in the back of her throat.An aborted laugh or a noise of distress, I wasnt sure which.I thought they were just made so they had to do as they were told.Well, exactly, said Anaander Mianaai as we followed her through the temples main hall.Sounds from the concourse reached us, someone speaking urgently, voice pitched high and loud.The temple itself seemed deserted.Thats how they were made from the start, but their minds are complex, and its a tricky proposition.The original designers did that by giving them an overwhelming reason to want to obey.Which had advantages, and rather spectacular disadvantages.I couldnt completely change what they were, I just adjusted it to suit me.I made obeying me an overriding priority for them.But I confused the issue when I gave Justice of Toren two mes to obey, with conflicting aims.And then, I suspect, I unknowingly ordered the execution of a favorite.Didnt I?She looked at me.Not Justice of Torens favorite, I wouldnt have been so foolish.But I never paid attention to you, Id never have asked if someone was One Esks favorite.You thought no one would care about some nobody cooks daughter.I wanted to raise the gun.Wanted to smash all that beautiful glass in the mortuary chapel as we passed it.Anaander Mianaai stopped, turned to look at me.That wasnt me.Help me now, Im fighting that other me even now, Im quite certain.I wasnt ready to move openly, but now youve forced my hand, help me and Ill destroy her and remove her utterly from myself.You cant, I said.I know what you are, better than anyone.Shes you and youre her.You cant remove her from yourself without destroying yourself.Because shes you.Once I reach the docks, Anaander Mianaai said, as though it were an answer to what I had just said, I can find a ship.Any civilian ship will take me where I want to go without question.Any military ship will be a dicier proposition.But I can tell you one thing, Justice of Toren One Esk, one thing Im certain of.Ive got more ships than she does.Meaning what, exactly?asked Seivarden.Meaning, I guessed, the other Mianaai is likely to lose an open battle, so she has a slightly better reason to want to stop this spreading any further.I could see Seivarden didnt understand what that meant.Shes held it back by concealing it from herself, but now all of her here  Most of me, anyway, corrected Anaander Mianaai.Now shes heard it straight out she cant ignore it.Not here.But she might be able to prevent the knowledge from reaching the parts of her that arent here.At least long enough to strengthen her position.Realization made Seivardens eyes widen.Shell need to destroy the gates as soon as possible.But it cant work.The signal travels at the speed of light, surely.She cant possibly overtake it.The information hasnt left the station yet, said Anaander Mianaai.Theres always a slight delay.It would be far more efficient to destroy the palace instead.Which would mean turning a warship engine on the entire station, vaporizing it, along with everyone on it.And Id have to destroy the whole palace to stop the information going any further.There isnt just one spot where my memories are stored.Its made hard to destroy or tamper with on purpose.Do you think, I asked, into Seivardens shocked silence, that even you could get a Sword or a Mercy to do that?Even with accesses?How badly would you like the answer to that question?asked Anaander Mianaai.You know Im capable of it.I do, I acknowledged.Which option do you prefer?None of the currently available choices is very good.The loss of either the palace or the gatesor bothwill cause disruption on an unprecedented scale, all through Radch space.Disruption that will last for years, simply because of the size of that space.Not destroying the palaceand the gates, really theyre still part of the problemwill ultimately be even worse.Does Skaaiat Awer know whats going on?I asked.Awer has been a thorn in my side for nearly three thousand years, said Mianaai.Calmly.As though this were an ordinary, casual conversation.So much moral indignation!Id almost think they bred for it, but theyre not all genetically related.But if I stray from the path of propriety and justice, Im sure to hear about it from Awer.Then why not get rid of them?asked Seivarden.Why go and make one inspector supervisor here?Pain is a warning, said Anaander Mianaai.What would happen if you removed all discomfort from your life?No, Mianaai continued, ignoring Seivardens obvious distress at her words, I value that moral indignation.I encourage it.No you dont, I said.By now we were on the concourse.Security and military herded sections of the frightened crowdmany of them would have implants, would have been receiving information from Station when it suddenly cut out, with no explanation.A ships captain I didnt know spotted us, and hurried over.My lord, she said, bowing.Get these people off the concourse, Captain, Anaander Mianaai said, and clear the corridors, as quickly and safely as you can.Continue to cooperate with Station Security.Im working to resolve this as quickly as possible.As Anaander Mianaai spoke, a flash of movement caught my eye.Gun.Instinctively I raised my armor, saw the person holding the gun was one of the people who had been following us on the concourse, just before Security had summoned us.The Lord of the Radch must have sent orders before she triggered her device and cut off all communications.Before she knew about the Garseddai gun.The captain Anaander Mianaai had been speaking to recoiled, visibly startled by the sudden appearance of my armor.I raised my own gun, and a hammer hard blow hit me from the sidesomeone else had shot at me.I fired, hit the person holding the gun.She fell, her own shot wild, hitting the temple faade behind me, shattering some god, bright colored chips flying.Sudden, shocked silence from the already frightened citizens along the concourse.I turned, looked along the trajectory of the bullet that had hit me, saw panicked citizens and the sudden silver gleam of armorthis other shooter had seen me shoot the first, didnt know armor wouldnt help her.Half a meter from her another flash of silver as someone else armored herself.Citizens between me and my targets, moving unpredictably.But I was used to crowds of the frightened and the hostile.I fired, and fired again.The armor disappeared, both my targets fallen.Seivarden said, Fuck, you are an ancillary!Wed better get off the concourse, said Anaander Mianaai.And to the nameless captain beside her, Captain, get these people to safety.But the captain began, but we were already moving away, Seivarden and Anaander Mianaai staying low, moving as speedily as they could.I wondered briefly what was happening in other parts of the station.Omaugh Palace was huge.There were four other concourses, though all were smaller than this one, and level upon level of homes, workplaces, schools, public spaces, all of it full of citizens who would certainly be frightened and confused.If nothing else, anyone who lived here knew the necessity of following emergency procedures, wouldnt stop to argue or wonder once the order to seek shelter had gone out.But of course, Station couldnt give that order.I couldnt know, or help.Whos in the system?I asked, as soon as we were out of earshot, climbing down an emergency access ladder well, my armor retracted.Near enough to matter, you mean?Anaander Mianaai answered from above me.Three Swords and four Mercies in easy shuttle distance.Any order from Anaander Mianaai on the station would have to come by shuttle, because of the communications blackout.Im not worried about them at this very moment.Theres no possibility of giving them orders from here.And the instant there would be, the instant that blackout was raised, the entire question would already be settled, the knowledge Anaander Mianaai was so desperate to hide from herself already speeding toward the gates that would take it through all of Radch space.Is anyone docked?I asked.Right now, those would be the only ships that mattered.Only a shuttle from Mercy of Kalr, said Anaander Mianaai, sounding half amused.Its mine.Are you certain?And when she didnt answer I said, Captain Vel isnt yours.You got that impression too, did you?Anaander Mianaais voice was definitely amused now.Above me, above Anaander Mianaai, Seivarden climbed, silent except for her shoes on the ladder rungs.I saw a door, halted, pulled the latch.Swung it open, and peered into the corridor beyond.I recognized the area behind the dock offices.Once wed all clambered into the corridor and shut the emergency door, Anaander Mianaai strode ahead, Seivarden and me following.How do we know shes the one she says she is?Seivarden asked me, very quietly.Her voice still shook, and her jaw looked tight.I was surprised she hadnt curled up in a corner somewhere, or fled.It doesnt matter which one she is, I said, not making any attempt to lower my voice.I dont trust any of her.If she tries to go anywhere near Mercy of Kalrs shuttle youre going to take this gun and shoot her.All of what shed said to me might easily be a ruse, intended to get me to help her to the docks, and to Mercy of Kalr, so she could destroy this station herself.You dont need the Garseddai gun to shoot me, Anaander Mianaai said, without looking behind her.Im not armored.Well, some of me is.But not me.Not most of me.She turned her head briefly, to look at me.That is troublesome, isnt it.With my free hand I gestured my lack of concern or sympathy.We turned a corner and stopped cold, confronted with Inspector Adjunct Ceit holding a stun stick, the sort of thing Station Security might use.She must have heard us talking in the corridor, because she evinced no surprise at our appearance, just a look of terrified determination.Inspector Supervisor says Im not to let anyone past.Her eyes were wide, her voice unsure.She looked at Anaander Mianaai.Especially not you.Anaander Mianaai laughed.Quiet, I said, or Seivarden will shoot you.Anaander Mianaai raised an eyebrow, plainly disbelieving that Seivarden could bring herself to do any such thing, but she was silent.Daos Ceit, I said, in the language I knew had been her first.Do you remember the day you came to the lieutenants house and found the tyrant there?You were afraid and you grabbed my hand.Her eyes, impossibly, grew wider.You must have woken before anyone else in your house or theyd never have let you come, not after what happened the night before.But  I must speak with Skaaiat Awer.Youre alive!she said, eyes still wide, still not quite believing.Is the lieutenant Inspector Supervisor will be so  Shes dead, I interrupted before she could get any further.Im dead.Im all thats left.I have to speak to Skaaiat Awer right now.The tyrant will stay here and if she wont then you should hit her as hard as you can.I had thought Daos Ceit was mainly astonished, but now tears welled, and one dropped onto her sleeve, where she held the stick at the ready.All right, she said.I will.She looked at Anaander Mianaai and lifted the stick just slightly, the threat plain.Though it did strike me as foolhardy to post no one here but Daos Ceit.Whats the inspector supervisor doing?Shes sent people to manually lock down all the docks.That would take a lot of people, and a long time.It explained why Daos Ceit was here by herself.I thought of storm shutters rolling down, in the lower city.She said it was just like that night in Ors, and the tyrant had to be doing it.Anaander Mianaai listened to all this, bemused.Seivarden seemed to have passed into some sort of shocked state, beyond astonishment.You stay here, I said to Anaander Mianaai, in Radchaai.Or Daos Ceit will stun you.Yes, I got that much, said Anaander Mianaai.I see I didnt make a very positive impression when last we met, citizen.Everyone knows you killed all those people, Daos Ceit said.Two more tears escaped.And blamed the lieutenant for it.I had thought she was too young to have such strong feelings about the event.Why are you crying?Im scared.Not taking her eyes off Anaander Mianaai, or lowering the stick.That struck me as very sensible.Come on, Seivarden.I walked past Daos Ceit.Voices sounded ahead, where the outer office lay, past a turning.One step and then the next.It had never been anything else.Seivarden let out a convulsive breath.It might have started as a laugh, or something shed wanted to say.Well, she said then.We survived the bridge.That was easy.I stopped and checked under my brocaded jacket, counting magazines even though I already knew how many I had.Shifted one from under the waistband of my trousers to a jacket pocket.This is not going to be easy.Or end half as well.Are you with me?Always, she said, voice still oddly steady though I was sure she was on the point of collapse.Havent I already said that?I didnt understand what she meant, but now wasnt the time to wonder, or ask.Then lets go.22   We rounded the corner, my gun at the ready, and found the outer office empty.Not silent.Inspector Supervisor Skaaiats voice sounded outside, slightly muted through the wall.I appreciate that, Captain, but Im ultimately responsible for the safety of the docks.An answer, muffled, words indistinguishable, but I thought I recognized the voice.I stand by my actions, Captain, Skaaiat Awer answered as Seivarden and I came through the office and reached the wide lobby just outside.Captain Vel stood, her back to an open lift shaft, a lieutenant and two troops behind her.The lieutenant still had pastry crumbs on her brown jacket.They must have climbed down the shaft, because I was quite certain Station controlled the lifts.In front of us, facing them and all the lobbys watching gods, stood Skaaiat Awer and four dock inspectors.Captain Vel saw me, saw Seivarden, and frowned slightly in surprise.Captain Seivarden, she said.Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat didnt turn around, but I could guess what she was thinking, that shed sent Daos Ceit to defend the back way in, all by herself.Shes fine, I said, answering her, and not Captain Vel.She let me past.And then, not having planned it, the words seeming to come out of my mouth of their own volition, Lieutenant, its me, Im Justice of Toren One Esk.As soon as I said it I knew she would turn.I raised the gun to aim it at Captain Vel.Dont move, Captain.But she hadnt.She and the rest of Mercy of Kalr stood puzzling out what I had just said.Skaaiat Awer turned.Daos Ceit would never have let me by otherwise, I said.And remembered Daos Ceits hopeful question.Lieutenant Awn is dead.Justice of Toren is destroyed.Its only me now.Youre lying, she said, but even with my attention on Captain Vel and the others I could see she believed me.One of the lift doors came jerkily open and Anaander Mianaai jumped out.And then another.The first turned, fist raised, as the second lunged for her.Soldiers and dock inspectors backed reflexively away from the struggling Anaanders, into my line of fire.Mercy of Kalr stand clear!I shouted, and the soldiers moved, even Captain Vel.I fired twice, hitting one Anaander in the head and the other in the back.Everyone else stood frozen.Shocked.Inspector Supervisor, I said, you cant let the Lord of the Radch reach Mercy of Kalr.Shell breach its heat shield and destroy us all.One Anaander still lived, struggled vainly to stand.Youve got it backward, she gasped, bleeding.Dying, I thought, unless she got to a medic soon.But it hardly mattered, this was only one of thousands of bodies.I wondered what was happening in the private center of the palace proper, what sort of violence had broken out.Im not the one you want to shoot.If youre Anaander Mianaai, I said, then I want to shoot you.Whichever half she represented, this body hadnt heard all of that conversation in the audience hall, still thought it possible that I was on her side.She gasped, and for a moment I thought she was gone.Then she said, faintly, My fault.And then, If I were mea brief moment of pained amusementIll have gone to Security.Except, of course, unlike Anaander Mianaais personal guard (and whoever had shot at me on the concourse), Station Securitys armed was stun sticks, and armored was helmets and vests.They never had to face opponents with guns.I had a gun, and because of who I was, I was deadly with it.This Mianaai had missed that part of the conversation as well.Have you noticed my gun?I asked.Have you recognized it?She wasnt armored, hadnt realized that the gun I had shot her with was different from any other gun.Hadnt had, I thought, time or attention to wonder how anyone on the station could have had a gun she didnt know about.Or maybe she just assumed I had shot her with a weapon shed hidden from herself.But she saw now.No one else understood, no one else recognized the weapon, except Seivarden who already knew.I can stand right here and pick off anyone who comes through the shafts.Just like I did you.Ive got plenty of ammunition.She didnt answer.Shock would defeat her in a matter of minutes, I thought.Before any of the Mercy of Kalrs could react, a dozen vested and helmeted Station Security came thunking down the lift shaft.The first six tumbled out into the corridor, then stopped, shocked and confused by the dead Anaander Mianaais lying on the ground.I had spoken the truth, I could pick them off, could shoot them in this moment of frozen surprise.But I didnt want to.Security, I said, as firmly and authoritatively as I could.Noting which fresh magazine was nearest to hand.Whose orders are you following?The senior Security officer turned and stared at me, saw Skaaiat Awer and her dock inspectors, facing Captain Vel and her two lieutenants.Hesitated as she tried to put us together in some shape she understood.I am ordered by the Lord of the Radch to secure the docks, she announced.As she spoke I saw on her face the moment she connected the dead Mianaais with the gun I held ready.The gun I shouldnt have had.I have the docks secured, said Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat.All due respect, Inspector Supervisor.Senior Security sounded reasonably sincere.The Lord of the Radch has to get to a gate so she can send for help.Were to ensure she makes it safely to a ship.Why not her own security?I asked, already knowing the answer, as Senior Security did not.It was plain on her face that the question hadnt occurred to her.Captain Vel said, brusque, My own ships shuttle is docked, Id be more than happy to take my lord where she wants to go.This with a pointed look at Skaaiat Awer.Another Anaander Mianaai was almost certainly in that shaft behind those other Security officers.Seivarden, I said, escort Senior Security to where Inspector Adjunct Daos Ceit is.And to Senior Securitys look of dubious alarm, It will make a number of things clear to you.Youll still outnumber us and if youre not back within five minutes they can take me down.Or try to.They had probably never any of them met an ancillary and didnt know how dangerous I could be.And if I wont?asked Senior Security.I had left my face expressionless, but now, in answer, I smiled, as sweetly as I could manage.Try it and see.The smile unnerved her, and she obviously had no idea what was going on, and knew it, knew things werent adding up to anything she could make sense of.Likely her entire career had been spent dealing with drunks, and arguments between neighbors.Five minutes, she said.Good choice, I said, still smiling.Do please leave the stun stick behind.This way, citizen.Seivarden, all elegant servants politeness.When they had gone Captain Vel said, urgently, Security, we outnumber them, despite the gun.Them.The apparently next ranking Security officer was plainly still confused, still hadnt worked out what was going on.And, I realized, Security was used to thinking of Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat, indeed all of the dock inspectors, as being allies.And of course military officers held both dock authorities and Station Security forces in mild contempt, a fact Security here was certainly aware of.Why is there a them?A look of frustrated irritation crossed Captain Vels face.All this time, muttered words had been passing from the Security on solid ground to the Security still hanging in the shaft.I was certain an Anaander Mianaai was with them, and that the only thing that had kept her from herself ordering Security to rush me was her realizing that despite what Station (and certainly her own sensors) had told her, I had a gun.She needed to protect her own particular body, now she couldnt rely on any of the others.That and the lag time of questions and information passing from citizen to citizen up and down the shaft had kept her from acting until now, but surely she would move soon.And as if in answer to my thought the whispering in the shaft intensified, and the Security officers shifted their stances, just slightly, in a way that told me they were about to charge.Just then, Senior Security returned.She turned to look at me as she passed, a horrified expression on her face.Said to her now hesitating officers, I dont know what to do.The Lord of the Radch is back there, and she says the inspector supervisor and this this person are acting under her direct orders and were not to allow even one of her on the docks or onto any ship, under any circumstances.
