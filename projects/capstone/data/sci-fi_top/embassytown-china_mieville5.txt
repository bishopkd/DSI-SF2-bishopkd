Their eloquence depended on the sophistication of their processors: most were little more than ecstatics, but a few were sudden theologians.They ambled as they always had but now accosted us and exhorted us to defend prelapsarian language, Language, we poor sinners (the rhetoric was kitsch), doomed forever ourselves to speak with a deep structure of lie but at least granted service to the double tongue of truth, and more like that.Patches were programmed and released and did their job but the infection was tenacious, and for weeks these tramp priests proselytised us, their catechisms changing as their ware degraded and threw up protestant, variant sects.We are the stewards of the angels, I was told by one machine that staggered like a supplicant.We are the stewards of the speaking angels, of Gods language.The virus shut down when its resultant theories strayed too far from emergent Drumanian orthodoxy.I asked Ehrsul if she was concerned, if shed felt the tickling of virtual germs.She dismissed the other automa as mental weaklings and told me that yes, though shed felt it, shed hardly been in danger herself.Of course Valdik and his radical similes were suspected, but no one could prove who had programmed it, and though it was a nuisance that was all it ultimately was.I knew Scile didnt have the expertise to program, or Id have thought it his doing.WHEN I WENT back to The Cravat, now, I did so for socially diagnostic reasons.Many previous regulars no longer drank there: alienated by Valdiks vatic pronouncements, they set up refusenik simile salons.Others had taken their place.I went to hear Valdik speak, out of what I told myself was a pornography of doomed causes, and maybe to listen for grounds to demand some intervention.He hymned the Ambassadors (in his model, interceding hierophants); expressed gratitude at being simile, truths, Language in flesh.was there, with Spanish Dancer and others, at the last of Valdiks gatherings I went to.The Host had amassed more followers, too, so I thought it must be improving its technique, a better and better liar.They watched each other.Valdik glowered.I didnt know if the Hosts felt his hostility.Hasser was thereone of the few who retained friends on both sides of the emergent simile split.He acknowledged me, his face displaying an emotion for which Ive no name; it reminded me of my own.An unease, is as close as I can get to it.Arent you worried?I asked Ehrsul.I told you, she said, Im immune.No I mean...what do you reckon?Do you ever think about it?I mean, does it ever make you feel anything one way or the other, that some of the Hosts are learning...well, can talk their way around truth, now?She said nothing, so I said: Can lie.We were in a bar in one of Embassytowns shopping streets.Ehrsul in her minor notoriety was being glanced at by slightly moneyed youth.We spoke quietly under music and the clatter of glasses.Ehrsul did not answer me.Somethings changing.Which may or may not be a good thing, I said finally.She looked at me with a projected face that, by design or a coincidence of ambiguous stimuli responses in her ware, was inscrutable.She said nothing.I grew more and more uncomfortable in that enigmatic silence, until I talked about something else, to which she responded as normal, with all the exaggerated intimacies of our friendship.It never meant that much to me one way or the other that I was simile; I didnt care what Valdik preached.Its Scile, I said to myself: but no, though I was worried for him that wasnt all.I never really knew what else it was.SO WHATS being done?I asked CalVin.Even the Ambassadors were concerned, now, I gathered.The new philosophy couldnt have had more than a score or two of serious devotees, but fervour unnerved us in Embassytown.The Hosts must surely have picked up some atmosphere: Id seen more Ariekei than usual in the aeolian breath of our quarter.Were talking to the Hosts, CalVin said.Were going to organise......a festival.Here, in Embassytown.To stress that its theirs too, to speak in.Okay, I said slowly.Id never heard of an Ariekene event in Embassytown.But is that supposed to...What are you doing about Valdik?One of CalVin stared at me, the other looked away.I was angry and I tried to work out with whom.Scile was ensconced somewhere, with radical similes or the Staff, and would never respond to me now, and that seemed to concern no one.There I was, between cliques and secrets.I couldnt tell if I was perspicacious or paranoid.Its the doldrums, Avvy, Ehrsul said to me later.This is what happens.Youre talking as if its end time.I think...She paused.Youre upset because of Scile.You care about him, and hes gone from you.She stumbled exactly like someone who thought would.ARIEKEI REPRESENTATIVES came in flyers, to plan this hybrid festival.I was often in the Embassy, floaking, and I came to know them all.One tall and thickset Ariekes had a mark on its fanwing like a bird in a canopy of leaf, so I called it Pear Tree.This is what we need, CalVin said.Were all too tense.Therell be a parade, and stalls and games for Terre......and a Festival of Lies for the Hosts.What about Valdik?I said again.And what about Scile?Valdiks nothing.Scile weve not seen for a couple of weeks.So where is he...?Dont worry.Itll be okay.Honestly, this eventll put paid to a lot of these problems.I thought it was absolutely absurd.No one agreed with me.In all my life Ive never felt so alone.The festival was to take place in a piazza near the southern edge of Embassytown.It was christened the Licence Party: a pun on Lies and Sense, I was told.I never got what the sense referred to.Signs went up displaying that idiot name, and a necessary explanation.VALDIK LIVED in Embassytowns east.There was a balcony in front of his door overlooking a leisure canal, and a garden full of flowers and birds, altbirds, local fauna.Avice, he said, slowly, when he opened the door to me.If he was surprised he hid it.Valdik, I said.Can you help me?I need to find Scile.His relief was visible.Is everything alright...?he said.Yes, I said.No.I just...I havent seen him for days...My hesitation was real, though my main reason for being there was not Scile, but to assess Valdik and his theology.He let me in and I saw the trappings of his new beliefs.Papers everywhere, all the crazy cabbala and misplaced rigour of a sect.Me neither, he said.Im sorry.I dont know.I think hes still with CalVin and the others.They havent seen him for weeks, I said.No, they were with him a few days ago.That silenced me.He was at The Cravat and they came for him, Valdik said.When?I said.Who?CalVin and some Staff.CalVin?I said.Are you sure?Yes.Valdik didnt sound like a prophet.I had to leave: I could hardly focus on his beliefs at that moment.WHEN FINALLY CalVin next said they had time to see me, I was careful to be good company.We ate together.They spoke mostly about the Licence Party.One day, one night, half another day.CalVin emerged from their ablutions equalised.Their accrued blemishes were gone or replicated.I said nothing.I watched them sleep, watched their skins take on differential marks from cotton and the unconscious motion of their hands.When one or other would half wake, I would be waiting.I would try to murmur talk to them: gauge what Cal or Vin said.It was strange, trying to do something Id not known could even occur to me.He on my left, I decided, at last, murmured my name with a care I recognised, smiled with something really warm.It was desperately hard to tell with only these night fuddled moments.But he on my left, I decided at last, Cal or Vin, was the one who liked me more.I put my fingers to his lips, made him wake without sound.He opened his eyes.Cal, I whispered.Or Vin.Tell me.I know he wont.I indicated the sleeping other.I know youve seen Scile.I know.Where is he?Whats happening?I saw my mistake.I saw it the instant I moved my hands.You, he said, and though he was quiet I could hear his outrage.That Id try to find out secrets, and that Id do so by this blasphemy.My expression was frozen in misplaced intimacy.How dare you...I cursed.He sat up.His doppel shifted.You have some bastard nerve, Avice, the man Id woken said.How dare you.If weve seen Scile its not your business...Hes my husband!Its not your business.Were taking care of things.Like you begged us to.And you come here and treat us...like this...do this...?Beside us the newly woken doppel was rising.I looked at him and felt shame.How could I have mis seen it?There it was, that thing Id thought I detected in his brother.You thought he was me...?he said.I saw hurt, and other emotions.How could you?he said.His doppel added: ...do this?The raging one stood, sheets puddling on the floor.Get out, he said.Leave.You are damned...fucking lucky we dont pursue this.I cant believe you did that, said the other quietly.This is over, the standing one, Cal or Vin, said, and his doppel, the man I should have woken, looked up at him, looked at me, shook his head, turned away.I left the room having ruined my own plan.On my way home, through the night, I cursed myself.I passed a little tour of Ariekei murmuring in Language as they looked like curators at our lamplit dwellings.Formerly, 10  AT VARIOUS FAIRS and events in Embassytown, Id been asked to tell stories of the immer.Id shown trids and images of my hours in the out, supposedly for children, though there were always many adults in the audience.The immer was and is full of renegades and refugees.They emerge where they can and do what they can get away with.Id tell the stories.I had transported most things to most places: jewellery; immer miserable livestock; payloads of organic garbage to a trash planet state run by pirates.Id save the best for the end, a changing display of the pharos that marks the edge of the known always: here, right beside Arieka.Id show it through various filters, culminating in the tropeware that made it a lighthouse, a beacon in murk.See?Thats what you see.Thats right here.Beyond us theres nothing charted.We live at the end of the light.I was amazed at how addictive the spook and thrill was.My presence wasnt requested this time, for the Licence Party.What happened between you and CalVin?Ehrsul asked me.I didnt tell her, or anyone.THE MICROCLIMATES over the city and those over Embassytown were rigged according to a complex algorithm Id never bothered to decode.I was always vaguely charmed by planets in thrall to their tilt, with seasons that were more or less predictable.In Embassytown, I noticed particular weathers, of course, but didnt ever expect them.It grew warm.It was apparently time for us to have a summer.I went to the Licence Party alone.When I realised that she was expecting us to go together I had to tell Ehrsul no.From her silence I know I hurt her, or spurred the subroutine of her Turingware that manifested as if that were so.But I couldnt be there with anyone.I wasnt punishing herbecause this had not been Ehrsuls only silence recentlybut I needed to be alone for whatever would happen.I knew that something would as certainly as if this was a last chapter.THERE WERE game rooms, food halls, massage houses, places for sex; and there were zones designed for our Hosts.They came in large numbers, informed by their networks, the tech like town criers that we had helped to automate.Id never seen so many Hosts in Embassytown.Fortune tellers and performers were on the streets.Trid caricatures of passersby flashed in and out of existence.We came in through security: Terretech detectors of metals and energy flows, and biorigged proscenia that snuffled as we came through, tasting for the telltales of weapon compounds.There were constables in the crowd.With night the humans and Kedis grew more drunk or drugged.Children ran on frenetic missions.Automa wandered in.I saw a pod of adolescent Shurasi, a lone Pannegetch casting dice.The Hosts spectated as we played our shovepenny games.They looked with tourist fascination, listened to the songs our singers sung, titillated by our harmonics.I couldnt find Scile.I dont think the Ariekei ever empathised with our predilection for symmetry and hinge points: solstices, noon.But the Licence Party was ours as well as theirs, and the Festival of Lies started at midnight.The marquee was the size of a cathedral: in places the biorigged skin hadnt finished growing, and decorative gauze or plastic were woven over the holes.There was theatrical seating for Terre around the arena, and standing places for exots and for the Hosts.I saw people I knew.They shouted my name.I saw Hasser, and he raised his hand.He looked afraid.He was gone too fast for me to reach him.By the main performance space was a large group of Ambassadors.CalVin was there, and CharLott, JoaQuin and MagDa and JasMin and others, conferring with Staff.Ariekei were near them, one or two I recognised.Pear Tree, and others that perhaps I might call leaders.Beyond them performers waited, Host and Ariekei.was there, with Spanish Dancer and the others of its entourage.It wasnt hard to recognise.There was a hush, whispered Terre excitement when the lights went down and a few coloured illuminations fired.In a strong, projected doubled voice, Ambassador CharLott stepped into the centre of the spectators, spoke Language.A translator shouted to us locals theatrically,  Its raining in here, the Ambassador says!Its raining liquor on us!It sounded as though they were trying to excite Embassytowners with these feeble falsities as if we were Host, and I thought it absurd.But, over the delighted noises of the Ariekei looking up to find the rain that wasnt there, came the shrieks of Terre, my neighbours yelling delight at each new untruth from the Ambassador.As if none of them could lie.I reached the front as CharLott came to the end of their set.Other Ambassadors performed.They were building an arc for the listeners, I realised.For us.Here were lies that were a comic interlude, here a ratcheting up of tension, here a moving moment.When after long heady minutes they were done, Hosts stepped up in their place.Each Ariekes spoke only one or two short lies.Most did it by verbal trickery like a whispered final clause.Each success was marked with Terre cheers and Ariekene approval.Many competitors stumbled and said something true.The Host audience responded with what could have been scorn or could have been pity.I stand, I dont stand.This before me is not red.stepped forward at last, for a scheduled confrontation.Opposite it was an Ambassador, LuCy, moving like pugilists, swinging their arms as if limbering.I realised I was surprised, that when Id read about this contest I had thought it would be CalVin representing Embassytown.Ambassador and Host squared.This was some blasphemy, I thought.Who could have allowed this?There was cheering, but I heard a man beside me, as if channelling my opinion, muttering, This is not right.Before the humans came we didnt speak so much of certain things,  said.The MC was shouting the rules of the stand off.Before the humans came we didnt speak so much of certain things,  said again, and shucked its wings.Whatever alien feelings it was feeling, they looked to us like bravado.The two women of the Ambassador and that intricate big beast the Ariekes stared at each other.The Ambassador opened their mouths.Before they spoke,  said, Before the humans came we didnt speak so much.Ruckus.Before the humans came, the Host went on, and I knew what the lie would be, we didnt speak.It said it clearly.There was a moment, then the Ariekei stuttered in their ecstasy of reception.Even the Terre knew that we had heard something extraordinary.There was noise everywhere.Some shouted argument.I saw jostling in the crowd.Not true!someone was shouting.Not true!Men and women were got suddenly, violently, out of someone elses way.They screamed and parted.I could see the man coming, and it was Valdik.Not true!he said.He ran and shouted and brought a cudgel down on the ground, and I felt a spasming report.There was energy in his weapon.So much for security.He faced .Valdik shouted that it was not true.He raised his weapon.Eye corals strained.People were running toward us.Valdik shouted, Fucking snake!watched him, its coral spreading wide as horns.I heard the bark of a weapon and Valdik went down, his club scorching the floor.Constables grabbed him.He was beaten down.He went for a Host?people were gasping.I could hear Valdik still shouting: The devil!Hell fucking destroy us!Dont let it lie!None of the Ariekei made a sound.The officers hauled Valdik upright finally, blood smeared and ragged, hardly conscious.They began to drag him, his feet scratching on the floor, out of the grounds.Tens of seconds had passed since his attack.In that whole hall, I think I was the only person watching CalVin and their silent colleagues, one of the very few not staring at the battered would be assassin being taken away.I saw Scile.He was with them, among the Ambassadors and Staff.That was it; that was where to look.They were looking not at Valdik but at , and beyond it at Pear Tree and its group of Ariekei.I was one of very few in that hall who saw what happened then.Pear Tree moved.From behind it stepped Hasser.He walked quickly.Even  was still looking at Valdik.No constables saw Hasser coming, or were there to intervene.They were busy, suckers to the oldest feint.I moved.One of s eyebuds glimpsed something and the whole coral arced backward, to stare.I saw Spanish Dancer, heard it calling, its giftwing moving in alien distress.Hasser aimed a biorigged thing.A ceramic carapace, a pistolgrip that gripped him back.He fired.No one was there to stop him.He fired and the gun animal opened its throat and howled.He blasted  across the lying ground, spraying mud coloured Host blood.It broke apart as it flew.Hasser didnt stop firing.The assault tore s giftwing from its body.Its legs dyingly scuttled, so insectile it was appalling.It gushed from everywhere.Then Hasser was snatched out of my sight himself by a constables bullet.By the time screaming started again I was beside him.I trembled.I struggled for breath as if I were beyond the aeoli.Hasser stared without sight.I heard the rattle of scute from s posthumous fitting.Spanish Dancer traced shapes with its wings.Its colours flushed.Id never before seen Ariekene grief.I looked at Pear Tree, which looked down at me.I ignored the commotion and all the wails in the room, and watched Pear Tree, and CalVin, and Scile.I remember I moaned every time I exhaled.They were looking at Hassers body without expression.They must have seen me.THAT IS HOW the most virtuoso liar of the Ariekei was murdered.The days after that were as youd imagine.Chaos, fear, excitement.No Host had been harmed by an Embassytowner for hundreds of thousands of hours, for lifetimes.Suddenly we felt we existed on sufferance.Staff imposed a curfew, gave the constabulary and SecStaff extraordinary powers.In the out, Id spent time in cities and colonies under dictatorships of various forms, and I knew that what we had was a quaint approximation of martial law; but for Embassytown it was unprecedented.I HAD SO MUCH sadness in me.I cried, only when I was alone.I was so sorry for Hasser, silly secret zealot; and for Valdik who I still believe never knew hed been a distraction, and whose loyalty to Scile was such that, after that night, he went to his execution denying that anyone else had had any hand in his plan.So sorry for .I never knew what emotion would have been appropriate for an Ariekene loss, so I settled for sadness.For a day I turned off my buzz and did not answer when anyone came to my door.The second day I kept the buzz off, but I did answer the knocking.It was an autom Id never seen before, a whirring anthropoid outline.I blinked and wondered whod sent this thing and then I saw its face.Its screen was cruder than any Id seen her rendered on before, but it was Ehrsul.Avice, she said.Can I come in?Ehrsul, whyd you load yourself into...?I shook my head and stepped back for her to enter.The usual one doesnt have these.She swung the things arms like deadweight ropes.Why do you need them?I said.And Pharotekton bless her she grabbed hold of me, just as if Id lost someone.She did not ask me anything.I hugged her right back, for a long time.I WENT BACK once more to The Cravat.Set my expression, walked a floaker walk.None of the similes were there, nor, I think, did any ever come back.I let my show drop.But the owner, a man whose name I had never bothered to learn, referring to him only by the vernacular slang handle wed granted him that I now cannot remember, hurried up to me in agitation, as if I could help him.He told me that Ariekei were still coming: Spanish Dancer; one wed known as Baptist; others of the Professors.Theyd been staring at where the similes used to sit.Surl Tesh echer used to come here all the time, I said.Maybe theyre coming to be where their friend used to be.The owner was terrified the Hosts would commit reprisal for s death.Most people were.I was not.Id seen Pear Tree step aside for Hasser and say something to him on his way.Id seen CalVin and the others waiting for that.had been murdered but it also had been executed, publicly, by its peers.For heresy,  had been sentenced to Death by Human.Embassytown couldnt know, and would not.The situation must be made to look to most people, and did, like a bloody mess, rather than the careful juridical moment it also was.Ariekei traditioners had decided they could not tolerate , would not brook its experiments.A lie was a performance; a simile was rhetoric: their synthesis, though, the first step in their becoming quite another trope, was sedition.I would never assume I understood the motivations of any exot, and I had grown up knowing the thinking of the Hosts was beyond me.Whatever drove the Ariekene powers to their brutal decision might, might not, be comparable to the calculations that had also gone on behind Embassy doors.The Ariekene resistance to these innovations might have been ethical, or aesthetic, or random.It might have been religious or a game.Or instrumental, an expression of some cool, cynical calculation, a power jostling among cliques.I remembered Cal or Vins anxiety, when theyd told me that some of Sciles ideas about  made sense.The Ambassadors, as much as its Ariekene judges, had seen in it an approaching danger.I never thought CalVin saw whatever that coming badness was as my husband had, but where theres commitment and dissent there might be change, and perhaps that was enough.Thered been a catastrophe on its way that, together, Ariekei and Terre had staved off.A problem they had solved.Who could I tell?If I could prove anything, so what?Not everyone would think any of this the slightest crime.And what would I bring on myself?Id no idea how many of the Ambassadors knew, or if they would disapprove if they did, or what they would do to me if I complained.I cant have been the only one who worked out what had happened.There were enough snatches of information.But Staff asserted horror and shock and stressed to Embassytowners that they had apologised to our Hosts, and that Hasser and Valdik had both been brought to justice.They unleashed harsh policing against the remnants of the Druman cult.Scile moved at last into the Embassy, became Staff.One day all his possessions were gone from my home.Among his flaws wasnt cowardice.I think he was avoiding me; perhaps he wanted to spare me his rage.I NEVER STOPPED being appalled by the sentencing Id seen.But months passedand our months are longand we were out of the doldrums, and Valdik and Hasser were long dead.I still wouldnt speak to CalVin or Scile, but though I didnt know which Staff and Ambassadors were complicit in what had happened I couldnt spurn them all forever.I couldnt live in Embassytown like that.It felt not like compromise but survival.Even CalVin and I came wordlessly to a way of being in the same room, if we so found ourselves.We might, I eventually came to accept, one day even exchange brief cool words.I remembered those elements in Scile, the little opacities that had always been present, that Id always been intrigued by, that now seemed to have come to constitute all of him.I didnt know what fears the rest of the complicit Staff had had of , but I thought they must have been political.I was never sure about Scile, though, for all that he was Staff too now, and had for a long time been of their party.For all his consummate manipulation of the credulous simile zealots.He worked as apparatchik, but I wondered if he really was a prophet.Many months after those horrible events, the first crisis, as Embassytown geared into a different kind of time, as the arrival of the next ship grew closer, as the time Ive called formerly ended, the Hosts apparently made Scile a simile.I heard that from Ehrsul.She couldnt find out exactly what hed had to do.He was part of Language but I never heard him used and in various, I hoped untraceable, eavesdropping ways, I did try.By contrast the similes Hasser and Valdik, changed as they were by the events, were invigorated.Its like the boy who was opened and closed again and is dead.Its like the man who swam weekly with the fishes and is dead.The Ariekei found new uses for these new formulations.Ehrsul was a good friend to me in what was a pretty bleak time, though I wouldnt risk telling her everything that I knew had happened.I told myself that I was just waiting.I was immerser.When the relief came, Id go into the out, away from this place.Then the miab arrived, with details of what would be arriving next, and news of our impossible Ambassador.Wasnt I going to stay to see what would happen?Everything  after this was latterday, and its the only story remaining.Wasnt I eager for Embassytown to change?Later, the scale of the crisis that unfolded made this, retrospectively, a guilty memory, but when first I realised that things were not going quite to plan, the first time I met EzRa at the Arrival Ball, when I sensed that they were spreading some unexpected chaos in Embassytown, it had made me happy.Part Four  ADDICT    9  PEOPLE WANDERED through streets in a kind of utopian uncertainty, knowing that everything was different but unsure in what sort of place they lived now.Adults were talking and children playing games.Im minded to be careful, I heard one man say, and I could have laughed in his face.Minded, are you?I could have said.Minded how?What will you do?How will you be careful?Wed always lived in a ghetto, in a city that didnt belong to us but to beings far more powerful and strange.Wed lived among godslittle tiny gods but gods compared to us, considering what was at their and our disposaland ignored the fact.Now theyd changed, and we had no way to understand that, and all we could do was wait.Embassytowners foolish discussions were as meaningless right then as the sounds of birds.Our news figures said things to me from screens and tridflats like: The situation is being closely monitored.We were trying to find language to make sense of a time before whatever came after.I walked through the tiny Kedis district.The ruling troikas there had heard about the killing, knew enough Terre psychology that all our fears were rubbing off on them, and they were very anxious, too.I couldnt persuade Ehrsul to come to join me in the agitation and rush of Embassytown main, in the hilltop districts where people massed, following rumours that taught them nothing, staring, powerless spectators, into the city moving as opaquely as ever but differently opaquely now.We could all see it.I went to her apartment.Ehrsul was subdued, but then we all were.She spiked me a coffee with one of the edgers many of us were taking.She moved backwards and forwards on her treads.Her mechanisms were smooth, but inevitably with that repetition tiny infelicitous noises in the machine of her became audible, then irritations.Have you found anything out?I said.About whats going on?Nothing.Nothing.What about on the...?I said, nothing.She made her face blink.Theres all kinds of blather all over the nets, but if anyone out there understands whats happened or knows whats about to happen, theyre talking about it below what I can tap.EzRa?What about them?Do you think Im just neglecting to tell you important bits?Christ.I was embarrassed at her tone.I dont know where they are any more than you.I havent seen them since the party either.I didnt say that Id seen Ra more recently.Oh, theres plenty of rumours: theyre in the out, theyre taking control, theyre preparing an invasion, theyre dead.Nothing Id stake a rep on.If your channels to the Embassy havent netted anything, why would my pitiful little searchware?We regarded each other.Alright, I said slowly.Come with me...Im not going anywhere, Avice, she said, and her voice foreclosed argument.I was not, this one time, wholly disappointed at that.I WENT TO the coin wall.The return to anywhere you last visited as a child is difficult, especially when its a door.Your heart beats harder when you knock.But I knocked, and Bren answered.I was looking down when he opened the door, to give myself a second.I raised my head to him.He looked much older to me, because his hair was grey.That was all, though: he was hardly collapsing.He recognised me.Before I met his eyes, Im sure.Avice, he said.Benner.Cho.Bren, I said.We stared at each other, and eventually he made a sound between a sigh and a laugh, and I smiled if sadly and he stepped aside for me to enter the room I remembered so extraordinarily well, which hadnt changed at all.He brought me a drink and I joked about the cordial hed given me the first time I was there.He remembered the chant wed used when spinning coins, and recited it to me, imperfectly.He said something or other, something that meant you went into the out, youre an immerser!A congratulations.I felt like thanking him.We sat looking at each other.He was still thin, wore what could have been the same smart clothes I remembered.So, he said.Youve come here because the worlds ending.A muted screen behind him played out the confusion of Embassytown.Is it?I said.Oh I think so.Dont you?I dont know what to think, I said.Thats why Im here.I think its the end of the world, yes.He sat back.He looked comfortable.He drank and looked at me.Yes I do.Everything you knows finished.You know that, dont you?Yes, I can see you do.I saw his affection for me.You impressed me, he said.Such an intense girl.I wanted to laugh.Even while you were looking after your poor friend.Who breathed Host air.Yohn.Anyway.Anyway.He smiled.Its the end of the world and youre here why?You think I can help?I think you can tell me things.Oh believe me, he said, no one in that castle wants me to know anything.They keep me as out of it as they can these days.Im not saying Ive no ins at allthere are those who keep an old man in gossipbut you probably know at least as much as me.Whos Oratees?I said.He looked sharply up.Oratees?he said.It really is?Oh.Well.Christ Pharotekton.He smoothed down his shirt.I did wonder.I thought maybe that must be it, but...He shook his head.But you doubt.You can hardly believe it, can you?Oratees isnt a person, Bren said.Theyre a thing.Theyre junkies.Everything that could happen has happened sometime, he said.He leaned towards me.Where are the failed Ambassadors, dyou think, Avice?It was so shocking a question that I held my breath.If I put it to you outright, you wouldnt imagine, would you, that every single one of the monozogs the Embassy raises is suited to Ambassadorial duties?he said.Of course not.Some doppels dont takedont look enough like each other to be fixed, have quirks, cant think enough alike, despite all the training.Whatever.Youd have known that without being told if you let yourself think about it.Its not exactly a secret.Its just not thought.You know that doppels retire, when the other dies.He raised his hands, slightly, indicating himself.Youve never been in the Embassy crche, have you?There are those who never get out of it in the first place.If youve been grown and raised and trained for one job, and you cant do it, whats the profit in letting you out?That could only cause trouble.Little rooms of rendered twins, mouldering.Slack and separate doppels gone bad, one whole, one like a melted image; or perhaps both wrong; or neither wrong in any physical way but with some bone deep meanness; or just not able to do what they were born to.And if youre already out, Bren said, by the time you realise you hate your job or your doppel, or whatever?Well.Well.He spoke gently, breaking something to me.When he died, my...it was an accident.Its not as if we were old.People knew us...me.I was much too young to disappear.They tried to entice me to the rest home of course.But they couldnt force me.So what if my neighbours dont like me?So what if they see something crippled?No one likes a cleaved showing off their injury.Were stumps.He smiled.Thats what we are.There are trainees who can never speak Language.I dont know why.Just cant speak in time no matter how they practise.Thats simple: you dont let them go.But there are harder cases.They might look like any other pair.Its happened before, to varying degrees.We had a colleague, when I was training.WilSon.Whatever joined up mind it was behind their Language, for the Hosts to understand, it must have been a little out.A tiny bit.Nothing I could hear, but the Hosts...well.We were doing exams.Wed been tested by other Ambassadors and Staff, and in our last practical we had to speak to a Host.It was waiting.I dont know what it thought it was doing, how they asked it to help.Hello, WilSon say, when its their turn.Straightaway we can see somethings wrong, he said.From how the Ariekes moves.Every time they talk to us, they taste our minds, and were alien.So its heady stuff.But if the two halves of an Ambassador arent...quite enmeshed enough?Not two random voices: close enough to speak Language and for them to get it.But wrong?Broken?I said nothing.You know what Language is to them, Bren said.What they hear through the words.So, if they hear words they understand, they know are words, but its fractured?Ambassadors speak with empathic unity.Thats our job.What if that unitys there and not there?He waited.Its impossible, is what.Right there in its form.And that is intoxicating.And they mainline it.Its like a hallucination, a there not there.A contradiction that gets them high.Maybe not all of them.Every Host WilSon spoke to knew something was strange, and a few of them...He shrugged.Got drunk.On their words.Didnt matter what WilSon said.Isnt it a nice day; Please pass the tea; anything.The Hosts heard it and some of them got swoony and some of them wanted it again and again.Ambassadors are orators, and those to whom their oration happens are oratees.Oratees are addicts.Strung out on an Ambassadors Language.OUTSIDE PEOPLE ran through the streets in frightened carnival.There was the noise of fireworks.Bren refilled my glass.What happened to them?I asked.WilSon?They were quarantined, and they died.He drank.Everyone respects me, but that cant stop them hating me, Bren said.I understand that.They dont like to see my wound.He wrote his name in the airhis full name, seven letters: Bren.Thered been a time he was BrenDan, or more properly .Then his doppel had died, and hed become Bren, .He couldnt say his own name correctly.Bren looked at me thoughtfully for a long time.He went to a desk.Let me show you something.He threw me a shallow box.Inside were two links.His, and his doppel s.  I examined the filigree circuits, the wires and contacts, the carefully carved initials and silver leaves.Their clasps had been cut open.I looked at him and could see the tiny marks on his neck where his had been embedded.What are you thinking?he said.Are you thinking that I keep them so theyre close at hand?Are you thinking I hide them away, to try to forget them?Avice.If Id thrown his away and kept mine, youd think I was clinging to my dead identity, or resenting his death.If I threw them both away, youd see me in denial.If I kept his but not mine youd say I was refusing to let him go.Theres nothing I can do you wont do that to.Its not your fault.You cant help it, its what we do.Whatever I do, itll be one story or another.(Later, the next but one time I was with him, because I did come back and after that he came to me, he said to me, I look at that link and I hate him.I said nothing.What could I say?We were sitting on the sofa in my rooms.They were nothing like as splendid as Brens.I dont know when it started, he said.For a long time I thought I hated him when he died, because he died, poor bastard.Now I think it might have started earlier.You mustnt blame me.He was suddenly plaintive.Im sure he hated me, too.It was neither of our faults. )They must have suspected what would happen, you know, Bren said.The Ambassadors.It was always the oddballs who seemed to risk...unplaiting...just enough to make a few Ariekei oratees.Those were the ones they restrained.Other sorts of troublemakers went AWOL or native.You think they knew?I said.And who went what?They must have hoped EzRa were a drug, he said.So theyd affect one or two of the Hosts and not be usable.One in the eye for Bremen.Theyve all been very concerned about who was calling what shots, what agendas were being forced, since they heard EzRa were coming.I know, I said.But Bremen mustve known too, if this has happened before.Why would they send them...?Known about oratees, you mean?Why would we tell Bremen about that?I dont know what they had in mind, but this, letting EzRa speak, was the Embassys riposte, I think.Not that they expected this, though.Not like this.Language like this, right there but so impossible, so doping, that EzRa are infecting every, single, Host.All of which are spreading the word.All hooked on the new Ambassador.OUR EVERYDAY pantheon gone needy, desperate for hits of Ez and Ra speaking together, fermenting Language into some indispensable brew of contradiction, insinuation and untethered meaning.We were quartered in an addict city.That procession Id seen had been craving.What happens now?I said.It was very quiet in the room.There were hundreds of thousands of Ariekei in the city.Maybe millions.I didnt know.We knew hardly anything, at all.Their heads were all made of Language.EzRa spoke it and changed it.Every Host, everywhere, would become hardwired with need, do anything, for the blatherings of a newly trained bureaucrat.Sweet Jesus Pharotekton Christ light our way, I said.It is, said Bren, the end of the world.10  THE ARIEKEI told us how it would be.I was ahead of this curve, but it didnt take long for the rest of the Embassytowners to understand that the Hosts were junkies, though they may not have known how or why.I suspect there was a power struggle in the Embassy, that some would have tried, out of habit, without rationale, to wall up information.They didnt win.The streets of Embassytown were something between carnival and apocalypse: moods of ending; hysteria; happiness, or its giddy approximation.Constables apprehended people walking determinedly toward the edge of town, in biorigging that might let them breathe the city air.Youre going nowhere!the officers said.Get that off.People are dying...Some would be city voyagers must have got through.Embassytowners wanting something from the Hosts.Pointlessthe Ariekei wouldnt perceive them as people, but as the meat belongings of Ambassadors.I was able to bluff my way back into the Embassy.Seeing the way the Ambassadors were scurrying I felt for a moment almost protective of them.They didnt question me.Even JasMin seemed to have forgotten they disliked me.One of EdGar gave me a kiss, to my surprise.I couldnt see his doppel.I saw the discomfort in Ed or Gars eyes, from stretching their links field.Where...?I said.Coming, coming.Being so separated must have made it hard to concentrate.We didnt say much until his doppel turned a corridor corner and joined us.Have you been into the city?I said.(Of course.No onell talk to us. )Dyou know whats happening?(No.No. )Wheres EzRa?Wheres Wyatt?(Dont know.Dont care. )You dont know where EzRa are?I said.After they caused all this shit?So what, youve just left them to fucking conspire?Conspire?Ed and Gar laughed.They wont even talk to each other.AN ARIEKENE ship beast came toward us over their city, in which the outline of that obscure malaise was spreading, building to building.When the flyer touched down on the pad, we rigged up something like an official welcome.Its perhaps tendentious to say we, but I made myself part of that community then, around the Staff and Ambassadors, and I think no one resented it.Every Ambassador I could think of was there.The Ariekei entered the hall with gusts of aeoli breath, our wind, with the gilted curtains snapping like capes around them.They walked on the altwood floor with the sound of fingernails.Not a fraction so many as had come that last pilgrimage time, but this was a more formal group.JoaQuin and MayBel stepped forward, and others shuffled behind them.Our two sides watched each other.Eye corals craned.The Ariekei spoke so quickly only the most fluent listeners could follow.I turned to see how the crowd were taking all this, and with shock saw my husband.He stood in the doorway, and with him was the new Ambassador.I WAS THE FIRST, but a few other people in the room started to notice them, and there were gasps.Ra, tall and looking very tired, stood in a pose midway between hopeful and resentful.Behind him, Ez looked at the floor.His bantam swagger was gone.His augmens were off.Scile saw me.He met my eye, then looked around the room again.Standing where he stood, he could have been shoring EzRa up, could have been protecting them, could have been menacing them.I recognised some of the visitors.On one fanwing I saw a moment of bird shape in tree shape.Pear Tree.I stared at it.The Hosts said EzRas name.EzRa found a reserve of dignity, and met that attention.The Ariekei spoke in a confusion, one then another, squabbling even, until at last something like sense emerged.Someone began to translate what they said.This is how it will be.An unqualified future tense, rare in Language.This wasnt an aspiration: the Hosts could only envisage that this was how it would be.They didnt allow discussion: later we would make sense of it all.They didnt raise details.They didnt present requests or even demands, not really.They expressed need.All they could say, repeatedly, in various ways, was that they needed.We will hear EzRa speak.This is how it will be.We will hear them speak.First now we will hear EzRa speak.I could see some Staff making calculations, muttering: the best of them could strategise even during this.I admired that.They were working out what to do, what relations could remain and how others would be saved, how we could live, what we would make Embassytown be.They made me hope, and Id not expected that.The Hosts had a simple and single priority, it seemed.I was never a fool; Id known there must be antagonisms, camps and struggles among them, before I ever saw that bloody result of one; and now a paradox, that that memory rose in me at that moment, when all that was evident was one implacable agenda.First we will hear EzRa speak.Ez came forward, then, grudgingly, Ra.They looked at each other with very different emotions, those two unalike men.They whispered.They spoke Language together, and brought the Hosts to rapture.11  AS THEY UNFOLDED those times seemed pure chaos, but by the prodigious efforts of the better Staff, a kind of life emerged.Even routines.Its shocking how fast a whole city can be made to change.Trade, all the moments and minutiae of exchange: knowledge, services, goods, promises and extras.Our culture.The way we lived.All of those things had to be fixed.There was a dangerous excitement, an amoralism manifesting in small cruelties and mass indulgence, that some let take them, while others struggled to make things work.In the first weeks, if you came to the Embassy, it would probably be guarded, but perhaps not.Meeting rooms and galleries might be uncleaned, might contain detritus of parties.I didnt find much pleasure in transgressions.I knew the vomited up red wine wasnt puked in ostentation, nor left to rot in libertine performance, but because those who partied had seen or heard about the Ariekene demand; couldnt conceive of how we could keep going or what would happen if we failed to fulfil them; so didnt know if they would live another week, and had never been so afraid.Ehrsul did not answer my buzzes, and I was so overwhelmed I didnt pursue it or visit her, as a good friend perhaps should have.EzRa was at some parties, I heard from others, then saw myself.After a short time it was only Ez who was there, at the millennial debauches.Ra did other things.There were assignations and the collapses of relationships.There were many marriages.I had my own hurried liaisons.Really those first days are hard to talk about.The heroes who ensured that Embassytown wasnt swept away by insistent addicted Hosts were the clerks, who set up structures while the rest of us failed not to fall apart.A little later I became something again, something important to Embassytown: just then I was not.In those days Embassytown felt as small as it ever had to me.Not two days could pass without me meeting, at some gathering, eager or desultory or both, people Id avoided for thousands of hours.Burnham, a simile from back when, caught my eye from the other end of a crowd gathered because of a bullshit rumour that information was about to be imparted by the Embassy gates.He looked away as carefully as I did, as I had every time since Hassers and Valdiks deaths, since way before this new cataclysm, that Id bumped into him or Shanita or any of the dispersed Cravat crew.I wandered Embassytown while civil servants took pills to stay awake and worked out plans to keep us alive.I bumped, more than once, into older friends: Gharda; Simmon, the guard.He had nothing to guard.He was terrified: his biorigged prosthesis seemed sick.Staff too lowly had no idea what to do, and those too high were crippled by the loss of everything.So were all those Ambassadors who told people that it was the viziers faults, that they would never themselves have let things come to this, that it had always been Staff who were the real powers and who had let everyone down.No one listened to that fairy tale any more.It was ignored people whod done the same thing for years who changed themselves for the sake of Embassytown, and changed Embassytown.Our bureaucratic feudalism of expertise became a remorseless meritocracy.Even a few Ambassadors proved themselves.Rarely the ones Id have guessed.Thats true but a trite observation.One of the first of the new leaderships achievements was the defeat of Wyatts insurgency.Simmon was key to that little war.He told me about it afterwards, invigorated again.You saw how suddenly all Wyatts lot got moving?They were opening the arsenals.I guess whatevers going on triggered some bloody Bremen emergency protocol.Thats what all that chaos was, a few days ago.Id not noticed whatever uprising of our overpowers representatives he was talking about.There was plenty of chaos enough.We got wind of itnever mind howand we were ready for them.But we had to take risks.He was drawing the plan, the actions, in schema, with his hand in the air.We could probably just have pre empted them, you know?But that Bremen tech theyve gotwe reckoned it had to be pretty damn useful.So we waited and went in after theyd opened the silos.We had a few officers placed with themits not as if we hadnt been preparing for this before.We took them with only a few casualties, and we got the weapons.Although honestly, theyre not as useful as wed hoped.Still.They didnt put up much fight.Its only Wyatt who was the problem.Weve put him away.Incommunicado.There are bound to be Bremen agents still out there, and we have to make sure he cant get codes or instructions or whatever to them.I didnt tell him I hadnt noticed the drama.Even ignorant of it as Id been, I was galvanised, hearing of it.RA, THE DIFFIDENT half of our cataclysmic Ambassador, was allowed his solitude and whatever his little projects were; Ez was allowed his louche collapse.But they were on orders, and they were guarded.They had duties.They were what kept us alive.A city of brainwashed, EdGar said to me.Stronger than us, armed.We need them hospitable.There was no thinking or strategy from the Hosts in those first days.I who was so used to glossing all their strangeness with special pleadingits some Ariekene thing, we wouldnt understand was aghast to become convinced that they were not indulging any inhuman strategy, but mindless addict need.At first crowds of Ariekei were gathered permanently outside the Embassy.When they became agitated and their demands particularly insistent, every few hours, EzRa would be fetched, appear at the entrance, and in flawless Language say something anything at allamplified to carry, to the crowds obvious stoned relief.The second time EzRa said to them We are happy to see you and look forward to learning together, the oratees reacted without quite the degree of bliss theyd shown previously.The third time they were unhappy, until EzRa announced some new pointlessness about the colour of the buildings, the time of day or the weather.Then they were rapt again.Fucking fantastic, I said to someone.Theyre building up tolerance.Keep EzRa inventive.We watched news programmes that after kilohours of trivialities now had to learn to report our own collapse.One channel sent an aeoli wearing team with vespcams into the city.They were neither invited nor barred.Their reports were astonishing.We were not used to seeing Ariekene streets, but there are new freedoms during a breakdown.The reporters edged into the city, past plaited ropes tethering gas filled Host rooms, past buildings that shied away from them or rose on spindled limbs like witch huts.Ariekei crossed our screens.They saw the reporters, stared and ran over sometimes like tottering horses.They asked questions in their double voices, but there were no Ambassadors to answer them.The reporters knew Language, translated for viewers.Where is EzRa?That was what the Hosts said.The reporters werent the only Terre in the city.Their vespcams glimpsed men and women in Embassy suits moving among the skittish houses.They were routing cables and speakers Terretech that looked jarring in that topography.They were extending a network of hailers and coms boxes.In return perhaps for our lives, the maintenance of our power, water, infrastructure, biorigging, they were getting ready to bring EzRas voice right into the city.We need EzRa now, EdGar said.They have to perform.That was our deal.With them, or the Hosts?I said.Yes.More EzRa, though.And that means we need Ez.He was drinking and drugging.More than once, hed disappear at the times he was scheduled to speak Language to the Ariekei, leaving Ra speechless and waiting.I didnt care if Ez killed himself, but that hed take us with him if he did.Theyre like normal Ambassadors in one way, right?I said.Recordings work?So build up a library of EzRas speeches, then let the fucker do what he wants.Let him drink himself dead.Theyd thought of that, but Ez would not comply.Even begged by Ra or threatened by Staff or guards, he would only speak with his Ambassador colleague an hour or so at any one time.We could grab the odd snippet onto dat, but he was careful not to let them collect a store of EzRas Language.He knows hed be redundant, EdGar said.This way we keep needing him.Even in his decline and terror, Ez thought with ruthless strategy.I was impressed.BY VESPCAM, I saw the first times that EzRas voice was played into that strung out city.The buildings had been unhappy for days.They were rearing and breathing steam, purging themselves of the biorigged parasites they bred, that were Ariekene furniture.Look out from the Embassy, to where the city began, an organic vista like piled up body parts, and the motion of the architecture was clear.The wrongness was endemic.The city twitched.It was infected.The Hosts had heard EzRas impossible voice, had taken energy from their zelles and let out waste, and in the exchange the chemistry of craving had been passed, and passed on again by the little beasts when they connected to buildings to power light and the business of life.Addiction had gone into the houses, which poor mindless things shook in endless withdrawal.The most afflicted sweated and bled.Their inhabitants rigged them crude ears, to hear EzRa speak, so the walls could get their fix.EzRa spoke.They said anything in Language.Their amplified voice sounded through all the byways.Everywhere in the city Ariekei staggered and stopped.Their buildings staggered with them.It disgusted me.My mouth twisted.Everything beyond Embassytown shuddered with relief.It moved through pipework, wires and tethers, to every corner of the grid, into the power stations stamping in a sudden wrong bliss.Withdrawal would start again within hours.By the edge of our zone we could feel it in the paving: a shaking as houses moved.We could track their biorhythms through our windows, could gauge how badly the drug of speech was needed.IN THE PAST, each few months at harvest  or weaning time, wed send aeolied Ambassadors and barter crews out to where Ariekene shepherds of the biorig flocks would explain different wares, these machines half designed half born to chance, what each did and how.Now, the Ariekei neglected their out of city lands.Biorigging still entered the city, and we could see by the convulsions of the enormous throats that stretched kilometres to the foodgrounds that pabulum was still coming in too.And that, with reverse peristalsis, addiction was being passed out.This worlds dying, I said.How can they let it go like this?We saw no attempts at self treatment, no struggles.No Ariekene heroes.Ambassadors could converse with them in the hours after theyd had a hit of EzRas voice, when they seemed to humans lucid, but only to make the shortest of plans, for scant hours ahead.What do you think they should be doing?MagDa was one of the few Ambassadors working to usher in change.Id joined them.I was trying to be part of this new team.I knew MagDa and Simmon, scientists like Southel.Mostly though it was people new to me.Theres no equilibrium possible.
