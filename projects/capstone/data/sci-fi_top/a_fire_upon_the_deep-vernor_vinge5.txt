All the memories are still there.And for all I know, it's all the Old One's lie, an afternoon's fraud to fool the Relayers. "Ravna bit her lip, but didn't say anything.She was too honest to lie, even now.He reached with his free hand to brush her hair away from her face."I know you said that too, Rav.Don't feel bad: I would have caught on by now anyway. ""Yeah," she said softly.Then she was looking him straight in the eye."But know this.One human to another: You are a human now.And there could have been a Qeng Ho, and you could have been exactly what you remember.And whatever the past, you could be great in the future. "Ghostly echoes, more than memory and less than reason: For an instant he saw her with wiser eyes.She loves you, foolish one.Almost laughter, kindly laughter.He slid his arms around her, drawing her tight against him.She was so real.He felt her slip her leg between his.To laugh.Like heart massage, unthinking reflex bringing a mind back to life.So foolish, so trivial, but, "I  I want to come back. "The words came out strangled in sobs."There's so much inside me now, so much I can't understand.I'm lost inside my own head. "She didn't say anything, probably couldn't even understand his speech.For a moment, all he knew was the feel of her in his arms, hugging back.Oh please, I do want to come back.Making it on the bridge of a starship was something Ravna had never done before.But then she'd never had her own starship before, either.They don't call this a bottom lugger for nothing.In the excitement, Pham lost his tiedown.They floated free, occasionally bumping into walls and discarded clothing, or drifting through tears.After many minutes, they ended up with their heads just a few centimeters off the floor, the rest of them angled off toward the ceiling.She was vaguely aware that her pants were flying like a banner from where they had caught on her ankle.The affair wasn't quite the stuff of romance fiction.For one thing, floating free you just couldn't get any leverage.For another Pham leaned back from her, relaxing his grip on her back.She brushed aside his red hair and looked into bloodshot eyes."You know," he said shakily, "I never guessed I could cry so hard my face hurt. "She smiled back."You've led a charmed life then. "She arched her back against his hands, then drew him gently close.They floated in silence for several minutes, their bodies relaxing into each other's curves, sensing nothing but each other.Then: "Thank you, Ravna. "" my pleasure. "Her voice came dreamy serious, and she hugged him tighter.Strange, all the things he had been to her, some frightening, some endearing, some enraging.And some she couldn't have admitted  even to herself  till now.For the first time since the fall of Relay, she felt real hope.A silly physical reaction maybe but maybe not.Here in her arms was a guy who might be the equal of any story book adventurer, and more: someone who had been part of a Power."Pham what do you think really happened back on Relay?Why was Old One murdered?"Pham's chuckle seemed unforced, but his arms stiffened around her."You're asking me?I was dying at the time, remember No, that's wrong.Old One, He was dying at the time. "He was silent for a minute.The bridge turned slowly around them, silent views on the stars beyond."My godself was in pain, I know that.He was desperate, panicked But He was also trying to do something to me before He died. "His voice went soft, wondering."Yes.It was like I was some cheap piece of luggage, and He was stuffing me with every piece of crap that he could move.You know, ten kilos in a nine kilo sack.He knew it was hurting me  I was part of Him, after all  but that didn't matter. "He twisted back from her, his face getting a little wild again."I'm not a sadist; I don't believe He was either.I  "  Ravna shook her head."I I think he was downloading. "Pham was silent an instant, trying to fit the idea into his situation."That doesn't makes sense.There's not room in me to be superhuman. "Fear chased hope in tight circles."No, no, wait.You're right.Even if the dying Power figures reincarnation is possible, there's not enough space in a normal brain to store much.But Old One was trying for something else Remember how I begged Him to help with our trip to the Bottom?""Yes.I  He  was sympathetic, the way you might be with animals that are confronting some new predator.He never considered that the Perversion might be a threat to him, not until  "  "Right.Not until he was under attack.That was a complete surprise to the Powers; suddenly the Perversion was more than a curious problem for underminds.Then Old One really did try to help.He jammed plans and automation down into you.He jammed so much, you nearly died, so much you can't make sense of it.I've read about things like that in Applied Theology  " as much legend as fact."Godshatter, it's called. ""Godshatter?"He seemed to play with the word, wondering."What a strange name.I remember His panic.But if He was doing what you say, why didn't He just tell me?And if I'm filled with good advice, how come all I see inside is" his gaze became a little like days past, "darkness dark statues with sharp edges, crowding. "Again a long silence.But now she could almost feel Pham thinking.His arms twitched tight and an occasional shudder swept his body."Yes yes.Lots of things fit.Most of it I still don't understand, never will.Old One discovered something right there at the end. "His arms tightened again, and he buried his face against her neck."It was a very personal sort of murder the Perversion committed on Him.Even dying, Old One learned. "More silence."The Perversion is something very old, Ravna.Probably billions of years.A threat Old One could only theorize before it actually killed Him.But"  One minute.Two.Yet Pham did not continue."Don't worry, Pham.Give it time. ""Yeah. "He backed off far enough to look her square in the face."But I know this much now: Old One did this for a reason.We aren't on a fool's chase.There's something on the Bottom, in that Straumer ship, that Old One thought could make a difference. "He ran his hand lightly across her face, and his smile was sad where there should have been joy."But don't you see, Ravna?If you're right, today may be the most human I'll ever be.I'm full of Old One's download, this godshatter.Most of it I'll never consciously understand, but if things work properly, it will eventually come exploding out.His remote device; His robot at the Bottom of the Beyond. "No!But she made herself shrug."Maybe.But you're human, and we're working for the same things and I'm not letting you go. "Ravna had known that "jumpstarting" technology must be a topic in the ship's library.It turned out the subject was a major academic specialty.Besides ten thousand case studies, there were customizing programs and lots of very dull looking theory.Though the "rediscovery problem" was trivial in the Beyond, down in the Slow Zone almost every conceivable combination of events had happened.Civilizations in the Slowness could not last more than a few thousand years.Their collapse was sometimes a short eclipse, a few decades spent recovering from war or atmosphere bashing.Others drove themselves back to medievalism.And of course, most races eventually exterminated themselves, at least within their single solar system.Those that didn't exterminate themselves (and even a few of those that did) eventually struggled back to their original heights.The study of these variations was called the Applied History of Technology.Unfortunately for both academicians and the civilizations in the Slow Zone, true applications were a bit rare: The events of the case studies were centuries old before news of them reached the Beyond, and few researchers were willing to do field work in the Slow Zone, where finding and conducting a single experiment could cost them much of their lives.In any case, it was a nice hobby for millions of university departments.One of the favorite games was to devise minimal paths from a given level of technology back to the highest level that could be supported in the Slowness.The details depended on many things, including the initial level of primitiveness, the amount of residual scientific awareness (or tolerance), and the physical nature of the race.The historians' theories were captured in programs whose inputs were facts about the civilization's plight and the desired results, and whose outputs were the steps that would most quickly produce those results.Two days later, the four of them were back on the OOB's bridge.And this time we're all talking."So we must decide what inventions to shoot for, something that will defend the Hidden Island Kingdom  "  " and something 'Mister Steel' can make in less than one hundred days," said Blueshell.He had spent most of the last two days fiddling with the development programs in OOB's library."I still say guns and radios," said Pham.Firepower and communications.Ravna grinned at him.Pham's human memories alone would be enough to save the kids on Tines World.He hadn't talked any more of Old One's plans.Old One's plans in Ravna's mind those were something like fate, perhaps good, perhaps terrible, but unknown for now.And even fate can be weaseled."How about it, Blueshell?"she said."Is radio something they can produce quickly, from a standing start?"On Nyjora, radio had come almost contemporary with orbital flight  a good century into the renaissance."Indeed, My Lady Ravna.There are simple tricks that are almost never noticed till a very high technology is attained.For instance, quantum torsion antennas can be built from silver and cobalt steel arrays, if the geometry is correct.Unfortunately, finding the proper geometry involves lots of theory and the ability to solve some large partial differential equations.There are many Slow Zoners who never discover the principle. ""Okay," said Pham."But there's still a translation problem.Jefri has probably heard the word 'cobalt' before, but how can he describe it to people who don't have the referent?Without knowing a lot more about their world, we couldn't even describe how to find cobalt bearing ore. ""That will slow things down," Blueshell admitted."But the program accounts for it.Mr.Steel seems to understand the concept of experimentation.For cobalt, we can provide him with a tree of experiments based on descriptions of likely ores and appropriate chemical tests. ""It's not quite that simple," said Greenstalk."Some of the chemical tests themselves involve search/test trees.And there are other experiments needed to check toxicity.We know far less about the pack creatures than is usual with this program. "Pham smiled."I hope these creatures are properly grateful; I never heard of 'quantum torsional antennas'.The Tines are ending up with comm gear that Qeng Ho never had. "But the gift could be made.The question was, could it be done in time to save Jefri and his ship from the Woodcarvers?The four of them ran the program again and again.They knew so little about the pack creatures themselves.The Hidden Island Kingdom appeared fairly flexible.If they were willing to go all out to follow the directions, and if they had good luck in finding nearby sources for critical materials, then it looked like they might have limited supplies of firearms and radios inside of one hundred days.On the other hand, if the packs of Hidden Island ended up chasing down some worst case branches of the search trees, things might stretch out to a few years.Ravna found it hard to accept that no matter what the four of them did, saving Jefri from the Woodcarvers would be partly a matter of luck.Sigh.In the end, she took the best scheme the Riders could produce, translated it into simple Samnorsk, and sent it down.Steel had always admired military architecture.Now he was adding a new chapter to the book, building a castle that protected against the sky as well as the land around.By now the boxy "ship" on stilts was known across the continent.Before another summer passed, there would be enemy armies here, trying to take  or at least destroy  the prize that had come to him.Far more deadly: the star people would be here.He must be ready.Steel inspected the work almost every day now.The stone replacement for the palisade was in place all across the south perimeter.On the cliffside, overlooking Hidden Island, his new den was almost complete had been complete for some time, a part of him grumbled.He really should move over here; the safety of Hidden Island was fast becoming illusion.Starship Hill was already the center of the Movement  and that wasn't just propaganda.What the Flenser embassies abroad called "the oracle on Starship Hill" was more than a glib liar could dream.Whoever stood nearest that oracle would ultimately rule, no matter how clever Steel might be otherwise.He had already transferred or executed several attendants, packs who seemed just a little too friendly with Amdijefri.Starship Hill: When the aliens landed, it had been heather and rock.Through the winter, there'd been a palisade and a wooden shelter.But now construction had resumed on the castle, the crown whose jewel was the starship.Soon this hill would be the capital of the continent and the world.And after that Steel looked into the blue depths of the sky.How much further his rule extended would depend on saying just the right thing, on building this castle in a very special way.Enough dreaming.Lord Steel pulled himself together and descended from the new wall along fresh cut stone stairs.The yard within was twelve acres, mostly mud.The muck was cold on his paws, but the snow and slush were confined to dwindling piles away from the work routes.Spring was well advanced, and the sun was warm in the chill air.He could see for miles, out over Hidden Island all the way to the Ocean, and down the coast along the fjord country.Steel walked the last hundred yards up the hill to the starship.His guards paced him on either side, with Shreck bringing up the rear.There was enough room that the workers didn't have to back away  and he had given orders that no one was to stop because of his presence.That was partly to maintain the fraud with Amdijefri, and partly because the Movement needed this fortress soon.Just how soon was a question that gnawed.Steel was still looking in all directions, but his attention was where it should be now, on the construction work.The yard was piled with cut stone and construction timbers.Now that the ground was thawing, the foundations for the inner wall were being dug.Where it was still hard, Steel's engineers were injecting boiling water.Steam rose from the holes, obscuring the windlasses and the diggers below.The place was louder than a battle field: windlasses creaking, blades hacking at dirt, leaders shouting to work teams.It was also as crowded as close combat, though not nearly so chaotic.Steel watched a digger pack at the bottom of one of the trenches.There were thirty members, so close to each other that their shoulders sometimes touched.It was an enormous mob, but there was nothing of an orgy about the association.Even before Woodcarver, construction and factory guilds had been doing this sort of thing: The thirty member pack below was probably not as bright as a threesome.The front rank of ten swung mattocks in unison, carving steadily into the wall of dirt.When their heads and mattocks were extended high, the ten members behind them darted forward to scoop back the dirt and rocks that had just been freed.Behind them, a third tier of members hauled the dirt from the pit.Making it work was a complicated bit of timing  the earth was not homogeneous  but it was well within the mental ability of the pack.They could go on like this for hours, shifting first and second ranks every few minutes.In years past, the guilds jealously guarded the secret of each special melding.After a hard day's work, such a team would split into normally intelligent packs  each going home very well paid.Steel smiled to himself.Woodcarver had improved on the old guild tricks  but Flenser had provided an essential refinement (actually a borrowing from the Tropics).Why let the team break up at the end of a work shift?Flenser work teams stayed together indefinitely, housed in barracks so small they could never recover their separate pack minds.It worked well.After a year or two, and with proper culling, the original packs in such teams were dull things that scarcely wanted to break away.For a moment Steel watched the cut stone being lowered into the new hole and mortared into place.Then he nodded at the whitejackets in charge, and walked on.The foundation holes continued right up to the walls of the starship compound.This was the trickiest construction of all, the part that would turn the castle into a beautiful snare.A little more information via Amdijefri and he would know just what to build.The door to the starship compound was open just now, and a whitejackets was sitting back to back in the opening.That guard heard the noise an instant before Steel: two of its members broke ranks to look around the side of the compound.Almost inaudibly, there came high screams, then honking attack calls.The whitejackets leaped from the stairs and raced around the building.Steel and his guards weren't far behind.He skidded to a stop at the foundation trench on the far side of the ship.The immediate source of the racket was obvious.Three packs of whitejackets were putting a team's talker to the question.They had separated out the verbal member and were beating it with truncheon whips.This close, the mental screams were almost as loud as the shouting.The rest of the digger team was coming out of the trench, breaking into functional packs and attacking the whitejackets with their mattocks.How could things get so bloody screwed up?He could guess.These inner foundations were to contain the most secret tunnels of the entire castle, and the even more secret devices he planned to use against the Two Legs.Of course, all of the workers on such sensitive areas would be disposed of after the job was done.Stupid though they were, maybe they had guessed their fate.Under other circumstances, Steel might have backed off and simply watched.Failures like this could be enlightening; they let him identify the weaknesses in his subordinates, who was too bad (and too good) to continue in their jobs.This time was different.Amdijefri were aboard the starship.There was no view through the wooden walls, and surely there was another whitejackets on guard within, but Even as he lunged forward, shouting to his servants, Steel's back looking member caught sight of Jefri coming out of the compound.Two of the pups were on his shoulders, the rest of Amdi spilling out around him."Stay back!"he yelled at them, and in his sparse Samnorsk, "Danger!Stay back!"Amdi paused, but the Two Legs kept coming.Two soldier packs scattered out of his way.They had standing orders: never touch the alien.Another second and the careful work of a year would be destroyed.Another second and Steel might lose the world  all on account of stupidity and bad luck.But even as his back members were shouting at the Two Legs, his forward ones leaped atop a pile of stone.He pointed at the teams coming out of the trench."Kill the invaders!"His personal guards moved close around him as Shreck and several troopers streamed by.Steel's consciousness sagged in the bloody noise.This was not the controlled mayhem of experiments beneath Hidden Island.This was random death flying in all directions: arrows, spears, mattocks.Members of the digger team ran about, flailing and crying.They never had a chance, but they killed a number of others in their dying.Steel backed away from the melee, toward Jefri.The Two Legs was still running toward him.Amdi followed, shouting in Samnorsk.A single mindless team member, a single misaimed arrow, and the Two Legs would die and all would be lost.Never in his life had Steel felt such panic for the safety of another.He raced to the human, surrounding him.The Two Legs fell to his knees and grabbed Steel by a neck.Only a lifetime of discipline kept Steel from slashing back: the alien wasn't attacking, he was hugging.The digger team was almost all dead now, and Shreck had pushed the surviving members too far away to be a threat.Steel's guards were securely around him only five or ten yards away.Amdi was all clumped together, cowering in the mind noise, but still shouting to Jefri.Steel tried to untangle himself from the human, but Jefri just grabbed one neck after another, sometimes two at a time.He was making burbling noises that didn't sound like Samnorsk.Steel trembled under the assault.Don't show the revulsion.The human would not recognize it, but Amdi might.Jefri had done this before, and Steel had taken advantage even though it cost him.The mantis child needed physical contact; it was the basis for the relationship between Amdi and Jefri.Similar trust must come from letting this thing touch him.Steel slid a head and neck across the creature's back the way he had seen parents do with pups down in the dungeon laboratories.Jefri hugged him harder, and swept his long articulate paws across Steel's pelt.Revulsion aside, it was a very strange experience.Ordinarily such close contact with another intelligent being could only come in battle or in sex  and in either case, there wasn't much room for rational thought.But with this human  well, the creature responded with obvious intelligence  but there wasn't a trace of mind noise.You could think and feel both at the same time.Steel bit down on a lip, trying to stifle his shivering.It was   it was like having sex with a corpse.Finally Jefri stepped back, holding his hand up.He said something very fast, and Amdi said, "Oh Lord Steel, you're hurt.See the blood. "There was red on the human's paw; Steel looked at himself.Sure enough, one rump had taken a nick.He hadn't even felt it till now.Steel backed away from the mantis and said to Amdi, "It's nothing.Are you and Jefri unhurt?"There was a rattling exchange between the two children, almost unintelligible to Steel."We're fine.Thank you for protecting us. "Fast thinking was something that Flenser had carved into Steel with knives: "Yes.But it never should have happened.The Woodcarvers disguised themselves as workers.I think they've been at this for days waiting for a chance at you.When we guessed the fraud, it was almost too late You should really have stayed inside when you heard the fighting. "Amdi hung his heads ashamedly, and translated to Jefri."We're sorry.We got excited, and t then we thought you might get hurt. "Steel made comforting noises.At the same time, two of him looked around at the carnage.Where was the whitejackets that had deserted the stairs right at the beginning?That pack would pay  His line of thought crashed to a halt as he noticed: Tyrathect.The Flenser Fragment was watching from the meeting hall.Now that he thought about it, he'd been watching since right after the battle began.To others his posture might seem impassive, but Steel could see the grim amusement in the Fragment's expression.He nodded briefly at the other, but inside Steel cringed; he had been so close to losing everything and the Flenser had noticed."Well let's get you two back to Hidden Island. "He signaled to the keepers that had come up behind the starship."Not yet, Lord Steel!"said Amdi, "We just got here.A reply from Ravna should arrive very soon. "Teeth grated, but out of sight of the children."Yes, please do stay.But we'll all be more careful now, right?""Yes, yes!"Amdi explained to the human.Steel stood forelegs on shoulders and patted Jefri on the head.Steel had Shreck take the children back into the compound.Till they were out of sight, all his members looked on with an expression of pride and affection.Then he turned and walked across the pinkish mud.Where was that stupid whitejackets?The meeting hall on Starship Hill was a small, temporary thing.It had been good enough to keep the cold out during the winter, but for a conference of more than three people it was a real madhouse.Steel stomped past the Flenser Fragment and collected himself on the loft with the best view of the construction.After a polite moment, Tyrathect entered and climbed to the facing loft.But all the decorum was an act for the groundlings outside; now Flenser's soft laughter hissed across the air to him, just loud enough for him to hear."Dear Steel.Sometimes I wonder if you are truly my student or perhaps some changeling inserted after my departure.Are you trying to screw us up?"Steel glared back.He was sure there was no uneasiness in his posture; all that was held within."Accidents happen.The incompetents will be culled. ""Quite so.But that appears to be your response to all problems.If you hadn't been so bent on silencing the digger teams, they might not have rioted and you would have had one less 'accident'. ""The flaw was in their guessing.Such executions are a necessary part of military construction. ""Oh?You really think I had to kill all those who built the halls under Hidden Island?""What?You mean you didn't?How  ?"The Flenser Fragment smiled the old, fanged smile."Think on it, Steel.An exercise. "Steel arranged his notes on the desk and pretended to study them.Then all of him looked back at the other pack."Tyrathect.I honor you because of the Flenser in you.But remember: You survive on my sufferance.You are not the Flenser in Waiting. "The news had come late last fall, just before winter closed the last pass over the Icefangs: The packs bearing the rest of the Master hadn't made it out of Parliament Bowl.The fullness of Flenser was gone forever.That had been an indescribable relief to Steel, and for a time afterward the Fragment had been quite tractable."Not one of my lieutenants would blink if I killed all of you  even the Flenser members. "And I'll do it, if you push me hard enough, I swear I will."Of course, dear Steel.You command. "For an instant the other's fear showed through.Remember, Steel thought to himself, always remember: This is just a fragment of the Master.Most of it is a little school teacher, not the Great Teacher with a Knife.True, its two Flenser members totally dominated the pack.The spirit of the Master was right here in this room, but gentled.Tyrathect could be managed, and the power of the Master used for Steel's ends."Good," Steel said smoothly."As long as you understand this, you can be of great use to the Movement.In particular," he riffled through the papers, "I want to review the Visitor situation with you. "I want some advice."Yes. ""We've convinced 'Ravna' that her precious Jefri is in imminent danger.Amdijefri has told her about all the Woodcarver attacks and how we fear an overwhelming assault. ""And that may really happen. ""Yes.Woodcarver really is planning an attack, and she has her own source of 'magical' help.We have something much better. "He tapped the papers; the advice had been coming down since early winter.He remembered when Amdijefri had brought in the first pages, pages of numerical tables, of directions and diagrams, all drawn in neat but childish style.Steel and the Fragment had spent days trying to understand.Some of the references were obvious.The Visitor's recipes required silver and gold in quantities that would otherwise finance a war.But what was this "liquid silver"?Tyrathect had recognized it; the Master had used such a thing in his labs in the Republic.Eventually they acquired the amount specified.But many of the ingredients were given only as methods for creating them.Steel remembered the Fragment musing over those, scheming against nature as if it were just another foe.The recipes of mystics were full of "horn of squid" and "frozen moonlight".The directions from Ravna were sometimes even stranger.There were directions within directions, long detours spent in testing common materials to decide which really fit the greater plan.Building, testing, building.It was like the Master's own method but without the dead ends.Some of it made sense early on.They would have the explosives and guns that Woodcarver thought were her secret weapons.But so much was still unintelligible  and it never got easier.Steel and the Fragment worked through the afternoon, planning how to set up the latest tests, deciding where to search for the new ingredients that Ravna demanded.Tyrathect leaned back, hissing a wondering sigh."Stage built upon stage.And soon we'll have our own radios.Old Woodcarver won't have a chance You are right, Steel.With this you can rule the world.Imagine knowing instantly what is happening in the Republic's Capital and being able to coordinate armies around that knowledge.The Movement will be the Mind of God. "That was an old slogan, and now it could be true."I salute you, Steel.You have a grasp worthy of the Movement. "Was there the Teacher's contempt in his smile?"Radio and guns can give us the world.But clearly these are crumbs from the Visitors' table.When do they arrive?""Between one hundred and one hundred twenty days from now; Ravna has revised her estimate again.Apparently even the Two Legs have problems flying between the stars. ""So we have that long to enjoy the Movement's triumph.And then we are nothing, less than savages.It might have been safer to forego the gifts, and persuade the Visitors that there is nothing here worth rescuing. "Steel looked out through the window slits that cut horizontally between timbers.He could see part of the starship compound, and the castle foundations, and beyond that the islands of the fjord country.He was suddenly more confident, more at peace, than he'd been in a long time.It felt right to reveal his dream."You really don't see it, do you Tyrathect?I wonder if the whole Master would understand, or whether I have exceeded him, too.In the beginning, we had no choice.The Starship was automatically sending some sort of signal to Ravna.We could have destroyed it; maybe Ravna would have lost interest And maybe not, in which case we would be taken like a fish gilled from a stream.Perhaps I took the greater risk, but if I win, the prize will be far more than you imagine. "The Fragment was watching him, heads cocked."I've studied these humans, Jefri and  through my spies  the one down at Woodcarvers.Their race may be older than ours, and the tricks they've learned make them seem all powerful.But the race is flawed.As singletons, they work with handicaps we can scarcely imagine.If I can use those weaknesses  "You know the average Tines cares for its pups.We've manipulated parental sentiments often enough.Imagine how it must be for the humans.To them, a single pup is also an entire child.Think of the leverage that gives us. ""You're seriously betting everything on this?Ravna isn't even Jefri's parent. "Steel made an irritated gesture."You haven't seen all of Amdi's translations. "Innocent Amdi, the perfect spy."But you're right, saving the one child is not the main reason for this Visit.I've tried to find out their real motive.There are one hundred fifty one children in some kind of deathly stupor, all stacked up in coffins within the ship.The Visitors are desperate to save the children, but there's something else they want.They never quite talk about it I think it's in the machinery of the ship itself. ""For all we know the children are a brood force, part of an invasion. "That was an old fear and  after watching Amdijefri  Steel saw no chance of it.There could be other traps but, "If the Visitors are lying to us, then there is really nothing we can do to win.We'll be hunted animals; maybe generations from now we'll learn their tricks, but it will be the end of us.On the other hand, we have good reason to believe that the Two Legs are weak, and whatever their goals, they do not involve us directly.You were there the day of the landing, much closer than I.  You saw how easy it was to ambush them, even though their ship is impregnable and their single weapon a match for a small army.It is obvious that they do not consider us a threat.No matter how powerful their tools, their real fears are elsewhere.And in that Starship, we have something they need."Look at the foundations of our new castle, Tyrathect.I've told Amdijefri that it is to protect the Starship against Woodcarver.It will do that  later in the Summer when I shatter Woodcarver upon its ramparts.But see the foundations of the curtain around the Starship.By the time our Visitors arrive, the ship will be envaulted.I've done some quiet tests on its hull.It can be breached; a few dozen tons of stone falling on it would quite nicely crush it.But Ravna is not to worry; this is all for the protection of her prize.And there will be an open courtyard nearby, surrounded by strangely high walls.I've asked Jefri to get Ravna's help on this.The courtyard will be just large enough to enclose Ravna's ship, protecting it too."There are many details still to be settled.We must make the tools Ravna describes.We must arrange the demise of Woodcarver, well before the Visitors arrive.I need your help in all those things, and I expect to receive it.In the end, if the Visitors are treacherous, we will make the best stand that can be.And if they are not well I think you'll agree that my reach has at least matched my teacher's. "For once, the Flenser Fragment had no reply.The ship's control cabin was Jefri and Amdi's favorite place in all of Lord Steel's domain.Being here could still make Jefri very sad, but now the good memories seemed the stronger and here was the best hope for the future.Amdi was still entranced by the window displays  even if the views were all of wooden walls.By their second visit they had already come to regard the place as their private kingdom, like Jefri's treehouse back on Straum.And in fact the cabin was much too small to hold more than a single pack.Usually a member of their bodyguard would sit just inside the entrance to the main hold, but even that seemed to be uncomfortable duty.This was a place where they were important.For all their rambunctiousness, Amdi and Jefri realized the trust that Lord Steel and Ravna were placing in them.The two kids might race around out of doors, driving their guards to distraction, but the equipment in this command cabin must be treated as cautiously as when Mom and Dad were here.In some ways, there was not much left in the ship.The datasets were destroyed; Jefri's parents had them outside when Woodcarver attacked.During the winter, Mr.Steel had carried out most of the loose items to study.The coldsleep boxes were now safe in cool chambers nearby.Every day Amdijefri inspected the boxes, looked at each familiar face, checked the diag displays.No sleeper had died since the ambush.What was left on the ship was hard fastened to the hull.Jefri had pointed out the control boards and status elements that managed the container shell's rocket; they stayed strictly away from those.Mr.Steel's quilting shrouded the walls.Jefri's folks' baggage and sleeping bags and exercisers were gone, but there were still the acc webbing and hard fastened equipment.And over the months, Amdijefri had brought in paper and pens and blankets and other junk.There was always a light breeze from the fans sweeping through the cabin.It was a happy place, strangely carefree even with all the memories it brought.This was where they would save the Tines and all the sleepers.And this was the only place in the world where Amdijefri could talk to another human being.In some ways, the means of talking seemed as medieval as Lord Steel's castle: They had one flat display  no depth, no color, no pictures.All they could coax from it were alphanumerics.But it was connected to the ship's ultrawave comm, and that was still programmed to track their rescuers.There was no voice recognition attached to the display; Jefri had almost panicked before he realized that the lower part of the screen worked as a keyboard.It was a laborious job typing in every letter of every word  though Amdi had gotten pretty good at it, using four noses to peck at the keys.And nowadays he could read Samnorsk even better than Jefri.Amdijefri spent many afternoons here.If there was a message waiting from the previous day, they would bring it up page by page and Amdi would copy and translate it.Then they would enter the questions and answers that Mr.Steel had talked to them about.Then there was a lot of waiting.Even if Ravna was watching at the other end, it could take several hours to get a reply.But the link was so much better than during the winter; they could almost feel Ravna getting closer.The unofficial conversations with her were often the high point of their day.So far, this day had been quite different.After the false workers attacked, Amdijefri had the shakes for about half an hour.Mr.Steel had been wounded trying to protect them.Maybe there was nowhere that was safe.They messed with the outside displays, trying to peek through cracks in the rough planking of the compound's walls."If we'd been able to see out, we could have warned Mr.Steel," said Jefri."We should ask him to put some holes in the walls.We could be like sentries. "They batted the idea around a bit.Then the latest message started coming in from the rescue ship.Jefri jumped into the acc webbing by the display.This was his dad's old spot, and there was plenty of room.Two of Amdi slid in beside him.Another member hopped on the armrest and braced its paws on Jefri's shoulders.Its slender neck extended toward the screen to get a good view.The rest scrambled to arrange paper and pens.It was easy to play back messages, but Amdijefri got a certain thrill out of seeing the stuff coming down "live".There was the initial header stuff  that wasn't so interesting after about the thousandth time you saw it  then Ravna's actual words.Only this time it was just tabular data, something to support the radio design."Nuts.It's numbers," said Jefri."Numbers!"said Amdi.He climbed a free member onto the boy's lap.It stuck its nose close to the screen, cross checking what the one by Jefri's shoulder was seeing.The four on the floor were busy scratching away, translating the decimal digits on the screen into the X's and O's and 1's and deltas of Tines' base four notation.Almost from the beginning Jefri had realized that Amdi was really good at math.Jefri wasn't envious.Amdi said that hardly any of the Tines were that good, either; Amdi was a very special pack.Jefri was proud that he had such a neat friend.Mom and Dad would have liked Amdi.Still Jefri sighed, and relaxed in the webbing.This number stuff was happening more and more often.Mom had read him a story once, "Lost in the Slow Zone", about how some marooned explorers brought civilization to a lost colony.In that, the heroes just collected the right materials and built what they needed.There had been no talk of precision or ratios or design.He looked away from the screen, and petted the two of Amdi that were sitting beside him.One of them wriggled under his hand.Their whole bodies hummed back at him.Their eyes were closed.If Jefri didn't know better, he would have assumed they were asleep.These were the parts of Amdi that specialized in talking."Anything interesting?"Jefri said after a while.The one on his left opened its eyes and looked at him."This is that bandwidth idea Ravna was talking about.If we don't make things just right, we'll just get clicks and clacks. ""Oh, right. "Jefri knew that the initial reinventions of radio were usually not good for much more than Morse code.Ravna seemed to think they could jump that stage."What do you think Ravna is like?""What?"The scritching of pens on paper stopped for an instant; he had all of Amdi's attention, even though they'd talked of this before."Well, like you only bigger and older?""Yeah, but  " Jefri knew Ravna was from Sjandra Kei.She was a grownup, somewhere older than Johanna and younger than Mom.What exactly does she look like?"I mean, she's coming all this way just to rescue us and finish what Mom and Dad were trying to do.She must really be a great person. "The scritching stopped again, and the display scrolled heedless on.They would have to replay it."Yes," Amdi said after a moment."She  she must be a lot like Mr.Steel.It will be nice to meet someone I can hug, the way you do Mr.Steel. "Jefri was a little miffed by that."Well wait, you can hug me!"The parts of Amdi next to him purred loudly."I know.But I mean someone that's a grownup like a parent. ""Yeah. "They got the tables translated and checked in about an hour.Then it was time to send up the latest things that Mr.Steel was asking about.There were about four pages, all neatly printed in Samnorsk by Amdi.Usually he liked to do the typing, too, all bunched up over the keyboard and display.Today he wasn't interested.He lay all over Jefri, but didn't pay any special attention to checking what was being keyed in.Every so often Jefri felt a buzzing through his chest, or the screen mounting would make a strange sound  all in sympathy to the unhearable sounds that Amdi was making between his members.Jefri recognized the signs of deep thought.He finished typing in the latest message, adding a few small questions of his own.Things like, "How old are you and Pham?Are you married?What are Skroderiders like?"Daylight had faded from the cracks in the walls.Soon the digger teams would be turning in their hoes and marching off to the barracks over the edge of the hill.Across the straits, the towers on Hidden Island would be golden in the mist, like something in a fairy tale.Their whitejackets would be calling Amdi and Jefri out for supper any minute now.Two of Amdi jumped off the acc webbing, and began chasing each other around the chair."I've been thinking!I've been thinking!Ravna's radio thing: why is it just for talking?She says all sound is just different frequencies of the same thing.But sound is all that thought is.If we could change some of the tables, and make the receivers and transmitters to cover my tympana, why couldn't I think over the radio?""I don't know. "Bandwidth was a familiar constraint on many everyday activities, though Jefri had only a vague notion of exactly what it was.He looked at the last of the tables, still displayed on the screen.He had a sudden insight, something that many adults in technical cultures never attain."I use these things all the time, but I don't know exactly how they work.We can follow these directions, but how would we know what to change?"Amdi was getting all excited now, the way he did when he'd thought of some great prank."No, no, no.We don't have to understand everything. "Three more of him jumped to the floor; he waved random sheets of paper up at Jefri."Ravna doesn't know for sure how we make sound.The directions include options for making small changes.I've been thinking.I can see how the changes relate. "He paused and made a high pitched squealing noise."Darn.I can't explain it exactly.But I think we can expand the tables, and that will change the machine in ob obvious ways.And then" Amdi was beside himself for a moment, and speechless."Oh Jefri, I wish you could be a pack, too!Imagine putting one of yourself each on a different mountain top, and then using radio to think.We could be as big as the world!"Just then there was the sound of interpack gobbling from outside the cabin, and then the Samnorsk: "Dinner time.We go now, Amdijefri.Okay?"It was Mr.Shreck; he spoke a fair amount of Samnorsk, though not as well as Mr.Steel.Amdijefri picked up the scattered sheets and carefully slipped them into the pockets on the back of Amdi's jackets.They powered down the display equipment and crawled into the main hold."Do you think Mr.Steel will let us make the changes?""Maybe we should also send them back to Ravna. "The whitejackets' member retreated from the hatch, and Amdijefri descended.A minute later they were out in the slanting sunlight.The two kids scarcely noticed; they were both caught up in Amdi's vision.For Johanna, lots of things changed in the weeks after Scriber Jaqueramaphan died.Most were for the better, things that might never have happened but for the murder and that made Johanna very sad.She let Woodcarver live in her cabin, and take the place of the helper pack.Apparently Woodcarver had wanted to do this from the beginning, but had been afraid of the human's anger.Now they kept the dataset in the cabin.There were never less than four packs of Vendacious' security surrounding the place, and there was talk of building barracks around it.She saw the others during the day at meetings, and individually when they needed help with the dataset.Scrupilo, Vendacious, and Scarbutt  the "Pilgrim"  all spoke fluent Samnorsk now, more than good enough so that she could see the character behind their inhuman forms: Scrupilo, prissy and very bright.Vendacious, as pompous as Scriber had ever seemed, but without the playfulness and imagination.Pilgrim Wickwrackscar.She felt a chill every time she saw his big, scarred one.It always sat in the back, hunched down to look unthreatening.Pilgrim obviously knew how the sight affected her and tried not to offend, but even after Scriber's death she couldn't do more than tolerate that pack And after all, there could be traitors in the Woodcarver castle.It was only Vendacious' theory that the murder had been a raid from outside.She kept a suspicious eye on Pilgrim.At night Woodcarver chased the other packs away.She huddled around the firepit, and asked the dataset questions that had no conceivable connection with fighting the Flenserists.Johanna sat with her and tried to explain things that Woodcarver didn't understand.It was strange.Woodcarver was something very like the Queen of these people.She had this enormous (primitive, uncomfortable, ugly  yet still enormous) castle.She had dozens of servants.Yet she spent most of each night in this little wood cabin with Johanna, and helped with the fire and the food at least as much as the pack who had been here before.So it was that Woodcarver became Johanna's second friend among the Tines.(Scriber was the first, though she hadn't known it till after he was dead. )Woodcarver was very smart and very strange.In some ways she was the smartest person Johanna had ever known, though that conclusion came slowly.She hadn't really been surprised when the Tines mastered Samnorsk quickly  that's the way it was in most adventures, and more to the point, they had the language learning programs in the dataset.But night after night Johanna watched Woodcarver play with the set.The pack showed no interest in the military tactics and chemistry that preoccupied them all during the day.Instead she read about the Slow Zone and the Beyond and the history of Straumli Realm.She had mastered nonlinear reading faster than any of the others.Sometimes Johanna would just sit and stare over her shoulders.The screen was split into windows, the main one scrolling much faster than Johanna could follow.A dozen times a minute, Woodcarver might come upon words she didn't recognize.Most were just unfamiliar Samnorsk: she'd tap a nose on the offending word and the definition would flicker briefly in a dictionary window.Other things were conceptual, and the new windows would lead the pack off into other fields, sometimes for just a few seconds, sometimes for many minutes  and sometimes the detour would become her new main path.In a way, she was everything that Scriber had wanted to be.Many times she had questions the dataset couldn't really answer.She and Johanna would talk late into the night.What was a human family like?What had Straumli Realm thought to make at the High Lab?Johanna no longer thought of most packs as gangs of snake necked rats.Deep past midnight, the dataset's screen was brighter than the gray light from the firepit.It painted the backs of Woodcarver in cheerful colors.The pack gathered round her, looking up, almost like small children listening to a teacher.But Woodcarver was no child.Almost from the first, she had seemed old.Those late night talks were beginning to teach Johanna about the Tines, too.The pack said things she never did during the day.They were mostly things that must be obvious to other Tines, but never talked about.The human girl wondered if Woodcarver the Queen had anyone to confide in.Only one of Woodcarver's members was physically old; two were scarcely more than puppies.It was the pattern of the pack that was half a thousand years old.And that showed.Woodcarver's soul was held together by little more than willpower.The price of immortality had been inbreeding.The original stock had been healthy, but after six hundred years One of her youngest members couldn't stop drooling; it was constantly patting a kerchief to its muzzle.Another had milky white in its eyes where there should have been deep brown.Woodcarver said it was stone blind, but healthy and her best talker.Her oldest member was visibly feeble; it was panting all the time.Unfortunately, Woodcarver said it was the most alert and creative of all.When it died  Once she started looking for it, Johanna could see weakness in all of Woodcarver.Even the two healthiest members, strong and with plush fur, walked a little strangely compared to normal pack members.Was that due to spinal deformities?The two were also gaining weight, which wasn't helping the problem.Johanna didn't learn this all at once.Woodcarver had told her about various Tinish affairs, and gradually her own story came out, too.She seemed glad to have someone to confide in, but Johanna saw little self pity in her.Woodcarver had chosen this path  apparently it was perversion to some  and had beaten the odds for longer than any other pack in recorded history.She was more wistful than anything else, that her luck had finally run out.Tines architecture tended to extremes  grotesquely oversized, or too cramped for human use.Woodcarvers council chamber was at the large extreme; it was not a cozy place.You could get three hundred humans into the bowl shaped cavity with room to spare.The separated balconies that ran around its upper circumference could have held another hundred more.Johanna had been here often enough before; this was where most work was done with the dataset.Usually there was herself and Woodcarver and whoever else needed information.Today was different, not a day to consult the dataset at all: This was Johanna's first council meeting.There were twelve packs in the High Council, and they were all here.Every balcony contained a pack, and there were three on the floor.Johanna knew enough about Tines now to see that for all the empty space, the place was hideously crowded.There was the mind noise of fifteen packs.Even with all the padded tapestries, she felt an occasional buzzing in her head or through her hands from the railing.Johanna stood with Woodcarver on the largest balcony.When they arrived, Vendacious was already down on the main floor, arranging diagrams.As the packs of the council came to their feet, he looked up and said something to Woodcarver.The Queen replied in Samnorsk: "I know it will slow things down, but perhaps that's a good thing. "She made a human laughing sound.Peregrine Wickwrackscar was standing on the next balcony over, just like some council pack.Strange.Johanna had not yet figured out why, but Scarbutt seemed to be one of Woodcarver's favorites."Pilgrim, would you translate for Johanna?"Pilgrim bobbed several heads."Is, is that okay, Johanna?"The girl hesitated an instant, then nodded back.It made sense.Next to Woodcarver, Pilgrim spoke better Samnorsk than any of them.As Woodcarver sat down, she took the dataset from Johanna and popped it open.Johanna glanced at the figures on the screen.She's made notes.Her surprise didn't have a chance to register, before the Queen was talking again  this time in the gobble sounds of interpack talk.After a second, Pilgrim began translating:  "Everyone please sit.Hunker down.This meeting is crowded enough as it is. "Johanna almost smiled.Pilgrim Wickwrackscar was pretty good.He was imitating Woodcarver's human voice perfectly.His translation even captured the wry authority of her speech.After some shuffling around, only one or two heads were visible sticking up from each balcony.Most stray thought noise should now be caught in the padding around the balcony or absorbed by the quilted canopy that hung over the room."Vendacious, you may proceed. "On the main floor, Vendacious stood and looked up in all directions.He started talking."Thank you," came the translation, now imitating the security chief's tones."The Woodcarver asked me to call this meeting because of urgent developments in the North.Our sources there report that Steel is fortifying the region around Johanna's starship. "Gobble gobble interruption.Scrupilo?"That's not news.That's what our cannon and gunpowder are for. "Vendacious: "Yes, we've known of the plans for some time.Nevertheless the completion date has been advanced, and the final version will have walls a good deal thicker than we had figured.It also appears that once the enclosure is complete, Steel intends to break apart the starship and distribute its cargo through his various laboratories. "For Johanna the words came like a kick in the stomach.Before there had been a chance: If they fought hard enough, they might recapture the ship.She might finish her parents' mission, perhaps even get rescued.Pilgrim said something on his own account, translating: "So what's the new deadline?""They're confident of having the main walls complete in just under ten tendays. "Woodcarver bent a pair of noses to the keyboard, tapped in a note.At the same time she stuck a head over the railing and looked down at the security chief."I've noticed before that Steel tends to be a bit over optimistic.Do you have an objective estimate?""Yes.The walls will be complete between eight and eleven tendays from now. "Woodcarver: "We had been counting on at least fifteen.Is this a response to our plans?"On the floor below, Vendacious drew himself together."That was our first suspicion, Your Majesty.But as you know, we have a number of very special sources of information sources we shouldn't discuss even here. ""What a braggart.Sometimes I wonder if he knows anything.I've never seen him stick his asses out in the field. "Huh?It took Johanna a second to realize that this was Pilgrim, editorializing.She glanced across the railing.Three of Pilgrim's heads were visible, two looking her way.They bore an expression she recognized as a silly smile.No one else seemed to react to his comment; apparently he could focus his translation on Johanna alone.She glared at him, and after a moment he resumed his businesslike translation:  "Steel knows we plan to attack, but he does not know about our special weapons.This change in schedule appears to be a matter of random suspicion.Unfortunately we are the worse for it. "Three or four Councillors began talking at once."Much loud unhappiness," came Pilgrim's voice, summing up."They're full of 'I knew this plan would never work' and 'Why did we ever agree to attack the Flenserists in the first place'. "Right next to Johanna, Woodcarver emitted a shrill whistle.The recriminations dribbled to a halt."Some of you forget your courage.We agreed to attack Hidden Island because it has been a deadly threat, one we thought we could destroy with Johanna's cannons  and one that could surely destroy us if Steel ever learns to use the starship. "One of Woodcarver's members, crouching on the floor, reached out to brush Johanna's knee.Pilgrim's focused voice chuckled in her ear."And there's also the little matter of getting you home and making contact with the stars, but she can't say that aloud to the 'pragmatic' types.In case you haven't guessed, that's one reason you're here  to remind the chuckleheads there's more in heaven than they have dreamed. "He paused, and switched back to translating Woodcarver:  "No mistake was made in undertaking this campaign: avoiding it would be as deadly as fighting and losing.So do we have any chance of getting an effective army up the coast in time?"She jabbed a nose in the direction of a balcony across the room."Scrupilo.Please be brief. ""The last thing Scrupilo can be is brief  oops, sorry," More editorializing from Peregrine.Scrupilo stuck a couple more heads into view."I've already discussed this with Vendacious, Your Majesty.Raising an army, traveling up the coast  those all could be done in well under ten tendays.It's the cannon, and perhaps training packs to use cannon, that is the problem.That is my special area of responsibility. "Woodcarver said something abrupt."Yes, Majesty.We have the gunpowder.It is every bit as powerful as Dataset says.The gun tubes have been a much greater problem.Till very recently, the metal cracked at the breech as it cooled.Now I think I have that fixed.At least I have two unblemished guntubes.I had hoped for several tendays of testing  "  Woodcarver interrupted, " but that is something we can't afford now. "She came completely to her feet and looked all around the council room."I want full size testing immediately.If it's successful, we'll start making gun tubes as fast as we can. "And if not   Two days later  The funniest thing was that Scrupilo expected her to inspect the gun tube before he fired it.The pack walked excitedly around the rig, explaining things in awkward Samnorsk.Johanna followed, frowning seriously.Some meters off, mostly hidden behind a berm, Woodcarver and her High Council were watching the exercise.Well, the thing looked real enough.They'd mounted it on a small cart that could roll back into a pile of dirt under the recoil force.The tube itself was a single cast piece of metal about a meter long with a ten centimeter bore.Gunpowder and shot went in the front end.The powder was ignited through a tiny firehole at the rear.Johanna ran her hand along the barrel.The leaden surface was bumpy, and there seemed be pieces of dirt caught in the metal.Even the walls of the bore were not completely smooth; would that make a difference?Scrupilo was explaining how he had used straw in the molds to keep the metal from cracking as it cooled.Yecco."You should try it out with small amounts of gunpowder first," she said.Scrupilo's voice became a bit conspiratorial, more focused, "Just between you me, I did that.It went very good.Now for big test. "Hmm.So you're not a complete flake.She smiled at the nearest of him, a member with no black at all in his head fur.In a kooky way, Scrupilo reminded her of some the scientists at the High Lab.Scrupilo stepped back from the cannon and said loudly, "It is all okay to go now?"Two of him were looking nervously at the High Councillors beyond the berm."Um, yes, it looks fine to me. "And of course it should.The design was copied straight from Nyjoran models in Johanna's history files."But be careful  if it doesn't work right, it could kill anybody nearby. ""Yes, yes. "Having gotten her official endorsement, Scrupilo swept around the piece and shooed Johanna toward the sidelines.As she walked back to Woodcarver, he continued in Tinish, no doubt explaining the test."Do you think it will work?"Woodcarver asked her quietly.She seemed even more feeble than usual.They had spread a woven mat for her, on the mossy heather behind the berm.Most of her lay quietly, heads between paws.The blind one looked asleep; the young drooler cuddled against it, twitching nervously.As usual Peregrine Wickwrackscar was nearby, but he wasn't translating now.All his attention was on Scrupilo.Johanna thought of the straw that Scrupilo had used in the molds.Woodcarver's people were really trying to help, but She shook her head, "I  who knows. "She came to her knees and looked over the berm.The whole thing looked like a circus act from a history file.There were the performing animals, the cannon.There was even the circus tent: Vendacious had insisted on hiding the operation from possible spies in the hills.The enemy might see something, but the longer Steel lacked details the better.The Scrupilo pack hustled around the cannon, talking all the time.Two of him hauled up a keg of black powder and he began pushing the stuff down the barrel.A wad of silkpaper followed the powder down the barrel.He tamped it into place, then loaded the cannon ball.At the same time, the rest of him pushed the cart around to point out of the tent.They were on the forest side of the castle yard, between the old and new walls.Johanna could see a patch of green hillside, drizzly clouds hanging low.About a hundred meters away was the old wall.In fact this was the same stretch of stone where Scriber had been killed.Even if the damn cannon didn't blow up, no one had any idea how far the shot would go.Johanna was betting it wouldn't even get to the wall.Scrupilo was on this side of the gun now, trying to light a long wooden firing wand.With a sinking feeling in her stomach, Johanna knew this couldn't work.They were all fools and amateurs, she as much as they.And this poor guy is going to get killed for nothing.Johanna came to her feet.Gotta stop it.Something grabbed her belt and pulled her down.It was one of Woodcarver's members, one of the fat ones that couldn't walk quite right."We have to try," the pack said softly.Scrupilo had the wand alight now.Suddenly he stopped talking.All of him but the white headed one ran for the protection of the berm.For an instant it seemed like strange cowardice, and then Johanna understood: A human playing with something explosive would also try to shield his body  except for the hand that held the match.Scrupilo was risking a maiming, but not death.The white headed one looked across the trampled heather to the rest of Scrupilo.It didn't seem upset so much as attentively listening.At this distance it couldn't be part of Scrupilo's mind, but the creature was probably smarter than any dog  and apparently it was getting some kind of directions from the rest.White head turned and walked toward the cannon.It belly crawled the last meter, taking what cover there was in the dirt behind the gun cart.It held the wand so the flame at its tip came slowly down on the fire hole.Johanna ducked behind the berm  The explosion was a sharp snapping sound.Woodcarver shuddered against her, and whistles of pain came from all around the tent.Poor Scrupilo!Johanna felt tears starting.I have to look; I'm partly responsible.Slowly she stood and forced herself to look across the field to where a minute ago the cannon had been  and still is!Thick smoke floated from both ends, but the tube was intact.And more, White head was wobbling dazedly around the cart, his white fur now covered with soot.The rest of Scrupilo raced out to White head.The five of him ran round and round the cannon, bounding over each other in triumph.For a long moment, the rest of the audience just stared.The gun was in one piece.The gunner had survived.And, almost as a side effect Johanna looked over the gun, up the hillside: There was a meter wide notch in the top of the old wall, where none had been before.Vendacious would have a hard time disguising that from enemy inspection!Dumb silence gave way to the noisiest affair Johanna had seen yet.There was the usual gobbling, and other sounds  hissing that hovered right at the edge of sensibility.On the other side of the tent, two Tines she didn't know ran into each other: for a moment of mindless jubilation, they were an enormous pack of nine or ten members.We'll get the ship back yet!Johanna turned to hug Woodcarver.But the Queen was not shouting with the others.She huddled with her heads close together, shivering."Woodcarver?"She petted the neck of one of the big, fat ones.It jerked away, its body spasming.Stroke?Heart attack?The names of oldenday killers popped into her mind.Just how would they apply to a pack?Something was terribly wrong, and nobody else had noticed.Johanna bounced back to her feet."Pilgrim!"she screamed.Five minutes later, they had Woodcarver out of the tent.The place was still a madhouse, but gone deathly quiet to Johanna's ears.She'd helped the Queen onto her carriage, but after that no one would let her near.Even Pilgrim, so eager to translate everything the day before, brushed her aside."It will be okay," was all he said as he ran to the front of the carriage and grabbed the reins of the shaggy Whatsits.The carriage pulled out, surrounded by several packs of guards.For an instant, the weirdness of the Tines world came crashing back on Johanna.This was a obviously a great emergency.A person might be dying.People were rushing this way and that.And yet The packs drew into themselves.No one crowded close.No one could touch another.The instant passed, and Johanna was running out of the tent after the carriage.She tried to keep to the heather along the muddy path, and almost caught up.Everything was wet and chill, gunmetal gray.Everyone had been so intent on the test  could this be more Flenser treachery?Johanna stumbled, went down on her knees in the mud.The carriage turned a corner, onto cobblestones.Now it was lost to sight.She got up and slogged on through the wet, but a little slower now.There was nothing she could do, nothing she could do.She had made friends with Scriber, and Scriber had been killed.She had made friends with Woodcarver, and now  She walked along the cobbled alley between the castle's storehouses.The carriage was out of sight, but she could hear its clatter on ahead.Vendacious' security packs ran in both directions past her, stopping briefly in side niches to allow opposing traffic by.Nobody answered her questions  probably none of them even spoke Samnorsk.Johanna almost got lost.She could hear the carriage, but it had turned somewhere.She heard it again behind her.They were taking Woodcarver to Johanna's place!She went back, and a few minutes later was climbing the path to the two storey cabin she had shared with Woodcarver these last weeks.Johanna was too pooped to run anymore.She walked slowly up the hillside, vaguely aware of her wet and muddy state.The carriage was stopped about five meters short of the door.Guard packs were strung out along the hill, but their bows weren't nocked.The afternoon sunlight found a break in the western clouds and shone for a moment on the damp heather and glistening timbers, lighting them bright against dark sky above the hills.It was a combination of light and dark that had always seemed especially beautiful to Johanna.Please let her be okay.The guards let her pass.Peregrine Wickwrackscar was standing around the entrance, three of him watching her approach.The fourth, Scarbutt, had its long neck stuck through the doorway, watching whatever was inside."She wanted to be back here when it happened," he said."What h happened?"said Johanna.Pilgrim made the equivalent of a shrug."It was the shock of that cannon going off.But almost anything could have done it. "There was something odd about the way his heads were bobbing around.With a shock Johanna realized the pack was smiling, full of glee."I want to see her!"Scarbutt backed hastily away as she started for the door.Inside there was only the light from the door and the high window slits.It took a second for Johanna's eyes to adjust.Something smelled wet.Woodcarver was lying in a circle on the quilted mattress she used every evening.She crossed the room and went to her knees beside the pack.The pack edged nervously away from her touch.There was blood, and what looked like a pile of guts, in the middle of the mattress.Johanna felt vomit rising in her."W Woodcarver?"she said very softly.One of the Queen moved back toward Johanna and put its muzzle in the girl's hand."Hello, Johanna.It's so strange to have someone next to me at a time like this. ""You're bleeding.What's the matter?"Soft, human sounding laughter."I'm hurt, but it's good See. "The blind one was holding something small and wet in its jaws.One of the others was licking it.Whatever it was, it was wiggling, alive.And Johanna remembered how strangely plump and awkward parts of Woodcarver had become."A baby?""Yes.And I'm going to have another in a day or two. "Johanna sat back on the floor timbers, and covered her face with her hands.She was going to start crying again."Why didn't you tell me?"Woodcarver didn't say anything for a moment.She licked the little one all around, then set it against the tummy of the member that must be its mother.The newborn snuggled close, nuzzling into the belly fur.It didn't make any noise that Johanna could hear.Finally the Queen said, "I don't know if I can make you understand.This has been very hard for me. ""Having babies?"Johanna's hands were sticky with the blood on the quilt.Obviously this had been hard, but that's how all lives must start on a world like this.It was pain that needed the support of friends, pain that led to joy."No.Having the babies isn't it.I've borne more than a hundred in my memory's time.But these two are the ending of me.How can you understand?You humans don't even have the choice to keep on living; your offspring can never be you.But for me, it's the end of a soul six hundred years old.You see, I'm going to keep these two to be part of me and for the first time in all the centuries, I am not both the mother and the father.A newby I'll become. "Johanna looked at the blind one and the drooler.Six hundred years of incest.How much longer could Woodcarver have continued before the mind itself decayed?Not both the mother and the father."But then who is father?"she blurted out."Who do you think?"The voice came from just beyond the door.One of Peregrine Wickwrackscar's heads peered around the corner just far enough to show an eye."When Woodcarver makes a decision, she goes for extremes.She's been the most tightly held soul of all time.But now she has blood  genes, Dataset would say  from packs all over the world, from one of the flakiest pilgrims who ever cast his soul upon the wind. ""Also from one of the smartest," said Woodcarver, her voice wry and wistful at the same time."The new soul will be at least as intelligent as before, and probably a lot more flexible. ""And I'm a little bit pregnant, myself," said Pilgrim."But I'm not the least bit sad.I've been a foursome for too long.Imagine, having pups by Woodcarver herself!Maybe I'll turn all conservative and settle down. ""Hah!Even two from me is not enough to slow your pilgrim soul. "Johanna listened to the banter.The ideas were so alien, and yet the overtones of affection and humor were somehow very familiar.Somewhere then she had it: When Johanna was just five years old, and Mom and Dad brought little Jefri home.Johanna couldn't remember the words, or even the sense of what they'd said  but the tone was the same as what went between Woodcarver and Pilgrim.Johanna slid back to a sitting position, the tension of the day evaporating.Scrupilo's artillery really worked; there was a chance of getting the ship.And even if they failed she felt a little bit like she was back home."C can I pet your puppy?"The voyage of the Out of Band II had begun in catastrophe, where life and death were a difference of hours or minutes.In the first weeks there had been terror and loneliness and the resurrection of Pham.The OOB had fallen quickly toward the galactic plane, away from Relay.Day by day the whorl of stars tilted up to meet them, till it was the single band of light, the Milky Way as seen from the perspective of Nyjora and Old Earth  and from most all the habitable planets of the Galaxy.Twenty thousand light years in three weeks.But that had been on a path through the Middle Beyond.Now in the galactic plane, they were still six thousand light years from their goal at the Bottom of the Beyond.The Zone interfaces roughly followed surfaces of constant mean density; on a galactic scale, the Bottom was a vaguely lens shaped surface, surrounding much of the galactic disk.The OOB was moving in the plane of the disk now, more or less toward the galactic center.Every week took them deeper toward the Slowness.Worse, their path, and all variants that made any progress, extended right through a region of massive Zone shifting.The Net News had called it the Great Zone Storm, though of course there was not the slightest physical feeling of turbulence within the volume.But some days their progress was less that eighty percent what they'd expected.Early on they'd known that it was not only the storm that was slowing them.Blueshell had gone outside, looking over the damage that still remained from their escape."So it's the ship itself?"Ravna had glared out from the bridge, watching the now imperceptible crawl of near stars across the heavens.The confirmation was no revelation.But what to do?Blueshell trundled back and forth across the ceiling.Every time he reached the far wall, he'd query ship's management about the pressure seal on the nose lock.Ravna glared at him, "Hey, that was the n'th time you've checked status in the last three minutes.If you really think something is wrong, then fix it. "The Skroderider's wheeled progress came to an abrupt halt.Fronds waved uncertainly."But I was just outside.I want to be sure I shut the port correctly Oh, you mean I've already checked it?"Ravna looked up at him, and tried to get the sting out of her voice.Blueshell wasn't the proper target for her frustration."Yup.At least five times. ""I'm sorry. "He paused, going into the stillness of complete concentration."I've committed the memory. "Sometimes the habit was cute, and sometimes just irritating: When the Riders tried to think on more than one thing at a time, their Skrodes were sometimes unable to maintain short term memory.Blueshell especially got trapped into cycles of behavior, repeating an action and immediately forgetting the accomplishment.Pham grinned, looking a lot cooler than Ravna felt."What I don't see is why you Riders put up with it. ""What?""Well, according to the ship's library, you've had these Skrode gadgets since before there was a Net.So how come you haven't improved the design, gotten rid of the silly wheels, upgraded the memory tracking?I bet that even a Slow Zone combat programmer like me could come up with a better design than the one you're riding. ""It's really a matter of tradition," Blueshell said primly, "We're grateful to Whatever gave us wheels and memory in the first place. ""Hmm. "Ravna almost smiled.By now she knew Pham well enough to guess what he was thinking  namely that plenty of Riders might have gone on to better things in the Transcend.Those remaining were likely to have self imposed limitations."Yes.Tradition.Many who once were Riders have changed  even Transcended.But we persist. "Greenstalk paused, and when she continued sounded even more shy than usual."You've heard of the Rider Myth?""No," said Ravna, distracted in spite of herself.In the time ahead she would know as much about these Riders as about any human friends, but for now there were still surprises."Not many have.Not that it's a secret; it's just we don't make much of it.It comes close to being religion, but one we don't proselytize.Four or five billion years ago, Someone built the first skrodes and raised the first Riders to sentience.That much is verified fact.The Myth is that something destroyed our Creator and all its works A catastrophe so great that from this distance it is not even understood as an act of mind. "There were plenty of theories about what the galaxy had been like in the distant past, in the time of the Ur Partition.But the Net couldn't be forever.There had to be a beginning.Ravna had never been a big believer in Ancient Wars and Catastrophes."So in a sense," Greenstalk said, "we Riders are the faithful ones, waiting for What created us to return.The traditional skrode and the traditional interface are a standard.Staying with it has made our patience possible. ""Quite so," said Blueshell."And the design itself is very subtle, My Lady, even if the function is simple. "He rolled to the center of the ceiling."The skrode of tradition imposes a good discipline  concentration on what's truly important.Just now I was trying to worry about too many things" Abruptly he returned to the topic at hand: "Two of our drive spines never recovered from the damage at relay.Three more appear to be degrading.We thought this slow progress was just the storm, but now I've studied the spines up close.The diagnostic warnings were no false alarm. "" and it's still getting worse?""Unfortunately so. ""So how bad will it get?"Blueshell drew all his tendrils together."My Lady Ravna, we can't be certain of the extrapolations yet.It may not get much worse than now, or  You know the OOB was not fully ready for departure.There were the final consistency checks still to do.In a way, I worry about that more than anything.We don't know what bugs may lurk, especially when we reach the Bottom and our normal automation must be retired.We must watch the drives very carefully and hope. "It was the nightmare that haunted travelers, especially at the Bottom of the Beyond: with ultradrive gone, suddenly a light year was not a matter of minutes but of years.Even if they fired up the ramscoop and went into cold sleep, Jefri Olsndot would be a thousand years dead before they reached him, and the secret of his parents' ship buried in some medieval midden.Pham Nuwen waved at the slowly shifting star fields."Still, this is the Beyond.Every hour we go farther than the fleet of Qeng Ho could in a decade. "He shrugged."Surely there's some place we can get repairs?""Several. "So much for "a quick flight, all unobserved".Ravna sighed.The final fitting at Relay was to include spares and Bottom compatibility software.All that was faraway might have beens now.She looked at Greenstalk."Do you have any ideas?""About what?"Greenstalk said.Ravna bit her lip in frustration.Some said the Riders were a race of comedians; they were indeed, but it was mostly unintentional.Blueshell rattled at his mate."Oh!You mean where can we get help.Yes, there are several possibilities.Sjandra Kei is thirty nine hundred lights spinward from here, but outside this storm.We  "  "Too far," Blueshell and Ravna spoke almost in chorus."Yes, yes, but remember.The Sjandra Kei worlds are mainly human, your home, my lady Ravna.And Blueshell and I know them well; after all, they were the source of the crypto shipment we brought to Relay.We have friends there and you a family.Even Blueshell agrees that we can get the work done without notice there. ""Yes, if we could get there. "Blueshell's voder voice sounded petulant."Okay, what are the other choices?""They are not so well known.I'll make a list. "Her fronds drifted across a console."Our last chance for choice is rather near our planned course.It's a single system civilization.The Net name is it translates as Harmonious Repose. ""Rest in Peace, eh?"said Pham.But they had agreed to voyage on quietly, always watching the bad drive spines, postponing the decision to stop for help.The days became weeks, and weeks slowly counted into months.Four voyagers on a quest toward the Bottom.The drive became worse, but slowly, right on OOB's diagnostic projections.The Blight continued to spread across the Top of the Beyond, and its attacks on Network archives extended far beyond its direct reach.Communication with Jefri was improving.Messages trickled in at the rate of one or two a day.Sometimes, when OOB's antenna swarm was tuned just right, he and Ravna would talk almost in real time.Progress was being made on the Tines' world, faster than she had expected  perhaps fast enough that the boy could save himself.It should have been a hard time, locked up in the single ship with just three others, with only a thread of communication to the outside, and that with a lost child.In any case, it was rarely boring.Ravna found that each of them had plenty to do.For herself it was managing the ship's library, coaxing out of it the plans that would help Mr.Steel and Jefri.OOB's library was nothing compared to the Archive at Relay, or even the university libraries at Sjandra Kei, but without proper search automation it could be just as unknowable.And as their voyage proceeded, that automation need more and more special care.And things could never be boring with Pham around.He had a dozen projects, and curiosity about everything."Voyaging time can be a gift," he'd say."Now we have time to catch ourselves up, time to get ready for whatever we find ahead. "He was learning Samnorsk.It went slower than his faked learning on Relay, but the guy had a natural bent for languages, and Ravna gave him plenty of practice.He spent several hours each day in the OOB's workshop, often with Blueshell.Reality graphics were a new thing to him, but after a few weeks he was beyond toy prototypes.The pressure suits he built had power packs and weapons stores."We don't know what things may be like when we arrive; powered armor could be real useful. "At the end of each work day they would all meet on the command deck, to compare notes, to consider the latest from Jefri and Mr.Steel, to review the drive status.For Ravna this could be the happiest time of the day and sometimes the hardest.Pham had rigged the display automation to show castle walls all around.A huge fireplace replaced the normal window on comm status.The sound of it was almost perfect; he had even coaxed a small amount of "fire" heat from that wall.This was a castle hall out of Pham's memory, from Canberra he said.But it wasn't that different from the Age of Princesses on Nyjora (though most of those castles had been in tropical swamps, where big fireplaces were rarely used).For some perverse reason, even the Riders seemed to enjoy it; Greenstalk said it reminded her of a trading stop from her first years with Blueshell.Like travelers who have walked through a long day, the four of them rested in the coziness of a phantom lodge.And when the new business was settled, Pham and the Riders would trade stories, often late into the "night".Ravna sat beside him, the least talkative of the four.She joined in the laughter and sometimes the discussion: There was the time Blueshell had a humor fit at Pham's faith in public key encryption, and Ravna knew some stories of her own to illustrate the Rider's opinion.But this was also the hardest time for her.Yes, the stories were wonderful.Blueshell and Greenstalk had been so many places, and at heart they were traders.Swindles and bargains and good done were all part of their lives.Pham listened to his friends, almost enraptured and then told his own stories, of being a prince on Canberra, of being a Slow Zone trader and explorer.And for all the limitations of the Slowness, his life's adventures surpassed even the Skroderiders'.Ravna smiled and tried to pretend enthusiasm.For Pham's stories were too much.He honestly believed them, but she couldn't imagine one human seeing so much, doing so much.Back on Relay, she had claimed his memories were synthetic, a little joke of Old One.She had been very angry when she said it, and more than anything she wished she never had because it was so clearly the truth.Greenstalk and Blueshell never noticed, but sometimes in the middle of a story Pham would stumble on his memories and a look of barely concealed panic would come to his eyes.Somewhere inside, he knew the truth too, and she suddenly wanted to hug him, comfort him.It was like having a terribly wounded friend, with whom you can talk but never mutually admit the scope of the injuries.Instead she pretended the lapses didn't exist, smiling and laughing at the rest of his story.And Old One's jape was all so unnecessary.Pham didn't have to be a great hero.He was a decent person, though ebullient and kind of a rule breaker.He had every bit as much persistence as she, and more courage.What craft Old One must have had to make such a person, what Power.And how she hated Him, for making a joke of such a person.Of Pham's godshatter, there was scarcely a sign.For that Ravna was very grateful.Once or twice a month he had a dreamy spell.For a day or two after he would go nuts with some new project, often something he couldn't clearly explain.But it wasn't getting worse; he wasn't drifting away from her."And the godshatter may save us in the end," he would say when she had the courage to ask him about it."No, I don't know how. "He tapped his forehead."It's still god's own crowded attic up here."It's more than memory.Sometimes it needs all my mind to think with and there's no room left for self awareness, and afterwards I can't explain, but sometimes I have a glimmer.Whatever Jefri's parents brought to the Tines' world: it can hurt the Blight.Call it an antidote  better yet, a countermeasure.Something taken from the Perversion as it was aborning in the Straumli lab.Something the Perversion didn't even suspect was gone until much later. "Ravna sighed.It was hard to imagine good news that was also so frightening."The Straumers could sneak something like that right out from the Perversion's heart?""Maybe.Or maybe, Countermeasure used the Straumers to escape the Perversion.To hide inaccessibly deep, and wait to strike.And I think the plan might work, Rav, at least if I  if Old One's godshatter  can get down there and help it.Look at the News.The Blight is turning the top of the Beyond upside down  hunting for something.Hitting Relay was the least of it, a small by product of its murdering Old One.But it's looking in all the wrong places.We'll have our chance at Countermeasure. "She thought of Jefri's messages."The rot on the walls of Jefri's ship.You think that's what it is?"Pham's eyes went vague."Yes.It seems completely passive, but he says it was there from the beginning, that his parents kept him away from it.He seems a little disgusted by it That's good, probably keeps his Tinish friends away from it. "A thousand questions flitted up.Surely they must in Pham's mind too.And they could know the answer to none of them now.Yet someday they would stand before that unknown and Old One's dead hand would act through Pham.Ravna shivered, and didn't say anything more for a time.Month by month, the gunpowder project stayed right on the schedule of the library's development program.The Tines had been able to make the stuff easily; there had been very little backtracking through the development tree.Alloy testing had been the critical event that slowed things, but they were over the hump there too.The packs of "Hidden Island" had built the first three prototypes: breech loading cannon that were small enough to be carried by a single pack.Jefri guessed they could begin mass production in another ten days.The radio project was the weird one.In one sense it was behind schedule; in another, it had become something more than Ravna had ever imagined.After a long period of normal progress, Jefri had come back with a counterplan.It consisted of a complete reworking of the tables for the acoustic interface."I thought these jokers were first time medievals," Pham Nuwen said when he saw Jefri's message."That's right.And in principle, they just reasoned out consequences to what we sent them.The want to support pack thought across the radio. ""Hunh.Yes.We described how the tables specified the transducer grid  all in nontechnical Samnorsk.That included showing how small table changes would make the grid different.But look, our design would give them a three kilohertz band  a nice, voice grade connection.You're telling me that implementing this new table would give'em two hundred kilohertz. ""Yes.That's what my dataset says. "He grinned his cocky smile."Ha!And that's my point.Sure, in principle we gave them enough information to do the mod.It looks to me like making this expanded spec table is equivalent to solving a, hmm," he counted rows and columns, "a five hundred node numerical PDE.And little Jefri claims that all his datasets are destroyed, and that his ship computer is not generally usable. "Ravna leaned back from the display."Sorry.I see what you mean. "You get so used to everyday tools, sometimes you forget what it must be like without them."You you think this might be, uh, Countermeasure's doing?"Pham Nuwen hesitated, as if he hadn't even considered the possibility.Then, "No no, it's not that.I think this 'Mister Steel' is playing games with our heads.All we have is a byte stream from 'Jefri'.What do we really know about what's going on?""Well, I'll tell you some things I know.We are talking to a young human child who was raised in Straumli Realm.You've been reading most of his messages in Trisk translation.That loses a lot of the colloquialisms and the little errors of a child who is a native speaker of Samnorsk.The only way this might be faked is by a group of human adults And after twenty plus weeks of knowing Jefri, I'll tell you even that is unlikely. ""Okay.So suppose Jefri is for real.We have this eight year old kid down on the Tines' world.He's telling us what he considers to be the truth.I'm saying it looks like someone is lying to him.Maybe we can trust what he sees with his own eyes.He says these creatures aren't sapient except in groups of five or so.Okay.We'll believe that. "Pham rolled his eyes.Apparently his reading had shown how rare group intelligences were this side of the Transcend."The kid says they didn't see anything but small towns from space, and that everything on the ground is medieval.Okay, we'll buy that.But.What are the chances that this race is smart enough to do PDE's in their heads, and do them from just the implications in your message?""Well, there have been some humans that smart. "She could name one case in Nyjoran history, another couple from Old Earth.If such abilities were common among the packs, they were smarter than any natural race she had heard of."So this isn't first time medievalism?""Right.I bet this is some colony fallen on hard times  like your Nyjora and my Canberra, except that they have the good luck of being in the Beyond.These dog packs have a working computer somewhere.Maybe it's under control of their priest class; maybe they don't have much else.But they're holding out on us. ""But why?We'd be helping them in any case.And Jefri has told us how this group saved him. "Pham started to smile again, the old supercilious smile.Then he sobered.He was really trying to break that habit."You've been on a dozen different worlds, Ravna.And I know you've read about thousands more, at least in survey.You probably know of varieties of medievalism I've never guessed.But remember, I've actually been there I think. "The last was a nervous mutter."I've read about the Age of Princesses," Ravna said mildly."Yes and I'm sorry for belittling that.In any medieval politics, the blade and the thought are closely connected.But they become much more closely bound for someone who's lived through it.Look, even if we believe everything that Jefri says he has seen, this Hidden Island Kingdom is a sinister thing. ""You mean the names?""Like Flensers, Steel, Tines?Harsh names aren't necessarily meaningful. "Pham laughed."I mean, when I was eight years old, one of my titles was already 'Lord Master Disemboweler'. "He saw the look on Ravna's face and hurriedly added, "And at that age, I hadn't even witnessed more than a couple of executions!No, the names are only a small part of it.I'm thinking of the kid's description of the castle  which seems to be close by the ship  and this ambush he thinks he was rescued from.It doesn't add up.You asked 'what could they gain from betraying us'.I can see that question from their point of view.If they are a fallen colony, they have a clear idea what they've lost.They probably have some remnant technology, and are paranoid as hell.If I were them, I'd seriously consider ambushing the rescuers if those rescuers seemed weak or careless.And even if we come on strong look at the questions Jefri asks for Steel.The guy is fishing, trying to figure out what we really value: the refugee ship, Jefri and the coldsleepers, or something on the ship.By the time we arrive, Steel will probably have wiped the local opposition  thanks to us.My guess is we're in for some heavy blackmail when we get to Tines' world. "I thought we were talking about the good news.Ravna paged back through recent messages.Pham was right.The boy was telling the truth as he knew it, but "I don't see how we can play things any differently.If we don't help Steel against the Woodcarvers  "  "Yeah.We don't know enough to do much else.Whatever else is true, the Woodcarvers seem a valid threat to Jefri and the ship.I'm just saying we should be thinking about all the possibilities.One thing we absolutely mustn't do is show interest in Countermeasure.If the locals know how desperate we are for that, we don't have a chance."And it may be time to start planting a few lies of our own.Steel's been talking about building a landing place for us  within his castle.There's no way OOB could fit, but I think we should play along, tell Jefri that we can separate from our ultradrive, something like his container ship.Let Steel concentrate on building harmless traps"  He hummed one of his strange little "marching" tunes."About the radio thing: why don't we compliment the Tines real casually for improving our design.I wonder what they'd say?"Pham Nuwen got his answer less than three days later.Jefri Olsndot said that he had done the optimization.So if you believed the kid, there was no evidence for hidden computers.Pham was not at all convinced: "So just by coincidence, we have Isaac Newton on the other end of the line?"Ravna didn't argue the point.It was an enormous bit of luck, yet She went over the earlier messages.In language and general knowledge, the boy seemed very ordinary for his age.But occasionally there were situations involving mathematical insight  not formal, taught math  where Jefri said striking things.Some of those conversations had been under fine conditions, with turnaround times of less than a minute.It all seemed too consistent to be the lie Pham Nuwen thought.Jefri Olsndot, you are someone I want very much to meet.There was always something: problems with the Tines' developments, fears that the murderous Woodcarvers might attack Mr.Steel, worries about the steadily degrading drive spines and Zone turbulence that slowed OOB's progress even further.Life was by turns and at once frustrating, boring, frightening.And yet  One night about four months into the flight, Ravna woke in the cabin she had come to share with Pham.Maybe she had been dreaming, but she couldn't remember anything except that it had been no nightmare.There was no special noise in the room, nothing to wake her.Beside her, Pham was sleeping soundly in their hammock net.She eased her arm down his back, drawing him gently toward her.His breathing changed; he mumbled something placid and unintelligible.In Ravna's opinion, sex in zero gee was not the experience some people bragged it up to be; but really sleeping with someone   that was much nicer in free fall.An embrace could be light and enduring and effortless.Ravna looked around the dimly lit cabin, trying to imagine what had woken her.Maybe it had just been the problems of the day  Powers knew there had been enough of those.She nestled her face against Pham's shoulder.Yes, always problems, but in a way she more content than she had been in years.Sure there were problems.Poor Jefri's situation.All the people lost at Straum and Relay.But she had three friends, and a love.Alone in a tiny ship bound for the Bottom, she was less lonely than she'd been since leaving Sjandra Kei.More than ever in her life, maybe she could do something to help with the problems.And then she guessed, part in sadness, part in joy, that years from now she might look back on these months as goldenly happy.And finally, almost five months out, it was clear there was no hope of going on without repairing the drive spines.The OOB was suddenly doing only a quarter of a light year per hour in a volume that tested good for two.And things were getting worse.They would have no trouble making it to Harmonious Repose, but beyond that  Harmonious Repose.An ugly name, thought Ravna.Pham's "light hearted" translation was worse: Rest In Peace.In the Beyond, almost everything habitable was in use.Civilizations were transient and races faded but there were always new people moving up from Below.The result was most often patchwork, polyspecific systems.Young races just up from the Slowness lived uneasily with the remnants of older peoples.According to the ship's library, RIP had been in the Beyond for a long time.It had been continuously inhabited for at least two hundred million years, time for ten thousand species to call it home.The most recent notes showed better than one hundred racial terranes.Even the youngest was the residue of a dozen emigrations.The place should be peaceful to the point of being moribund.So be it.They jigged the OOB three light years spinward.Now they were flying down the main Net trunk towards RIP: they'd be able to listen to the News the whole way in.Harmonious Repose advertised.At least one species valued external goods, specializing in ship outfitting and repair.An industrious, hard footed(?)race, the ads said.Eventually, she saw some video: the creatures walked on ivory tusks and had a froth of short arms growing from just below their necks.The ads included Net addresses of satisfied users.Too bad we can't follow up on those.Instead, Ravna sent a short message in Triskweline, requesting generic drive replacements, and listing possible methods of payment.Meantime, the bad news kept rolling in:   Crypto: 0  As received by: OOB shipboard ad hoc  Language path: Baeloresk Triskweline, SjK units  From: Alliance for the Defense [Claimed cooperative of five polyspecific empires in the Beyond below Straumli Realm.No record of existence before the Fall of the Realm. ]Subject: Call to action  Distribution:  Threat of the Blight, War Trackers Interest Group, Homo Sapiens Interest Group  Date: 158.00 days since Fall of Relay  Key phrases: Action, not talk   Text of message:  Alliance Forces are preparing for action against the tools of the Perversion.It is time for our friends to declare themselves.At the moment we do not need your military pledges, but in the very near future we will need support services including free Net time.In the coming seconds we will be watching closely to see who supports our action and who may be enslaved to the Perversion.If you live with the human infestation, you have a choice: act now with a good possibility of victory  or wait, and be destroyed.Death to vermin.There were plenty of secondary messages, including speculation about who Death to Vermin (aka the "Alliance for the Defense") had in mind.There were also rumors of military movement.This wasn't making the splash the fall of Relay had, but it did have the attention of several News groups.Ravna swallowed hard and looked away from the display."Well, they're still making big noises," she tried for a light tone, but it didn't come out that way.Pham Nuwen touched her shoulder."Quite true.And real killers generally don't advertise beforehand. "But there was more sympathy than conviction in his voice."We still don't know that this is more than a single loud mouth.There's no definite word of ship movements.What can they do after all?"Ravna pushed herself up from the table."Not much, I hope.There are hundreds of civilizations with small human settlements.Surely they've have taken precautions since this Death to Vermin stuff began By the Powers, I wish I knew Sjandra Kei was safe. "It had been more than two years since she'd seen Lynne and her parents.Sometimes Sjandra Kei seemed something from another life, but just knowing it was there had been more comfort than she realized.Now  On the other side of the command deck, the Skroderiders had been working on the repair specs.Now Blueshell rolled toward them."I do fear for the small settlements, but the humans at Sjandra Kei are the driving force of that civilization; even the name is a human one.Any attack on them would be an attack on the entire civilization.Greenstalk and I have traded there often enough, and with their commercial security forces.Only fools or bluffers would announce an invasion beforehand. "Ravna thought a moment, brightened.The Dirokimes and Lophers would stand against any threat to humankind at Sjandra Kei."Yeah.We're not a ghetto there. "Things might be very bad for isolated humans, but Sjandra Kei would be okay."Bluffers.Well it's not called the Net of a Million Lies for nothing. "She pulled her mind back from worries beyond her control."But one thing is clear.Stopping at Harmonious Repose, we must be damn sure not to look like anything human. "And of course, part of not looking human was that there be no sign of Ravna and Pham.The Riders would do all the "talking".Ravna and the Riders went through all the ship's exterior programs, weeding out human nuances that had crept in since they left Relay.And if they were actually boarded?Well, they would never survive a determined search, but they isolated things human in a fake jovian hold.The two humans would slip in there if necessary.Pham Nuwen checked what they did  and found more than one slip up.For a barbarian programmer, he wasn't bad.But then they were rapidly reaching the depths where the best computer equipment wasn't that much more sophisticated than what he had known.Ironically, there was one thing they could not disguise: that the OOB was from the Top of the Beyond.True, the ship was a bottom lugger and based on a Mid Beyond design.But there was an elegance to the refit that screamed of nearly superhuman competence."The damn thing has the feel of a hand axe built in a factory," was how Pham Nuwen put it.RIPer security was an encouraging thing: a perfunctory velocity check and no boarding.OOB hopped into the system and finished a rocket burn to match position/velocity vector with the heart of Harmonious Repose and "Saint(?)Rihndell's Repair Harbor".(Pham: "If you're a 'saint', you gotta be honest, right?")Out of Band was above the ecliptic and some eighty million kilometers from RIP's single star.Even knowing what to expect, the view was spectacular: The inner system was as dusty/gassy as a stellar nursery, even though the primary was a three billion year old G star.That sun was surrounded by millions of rings, more spectacular than around any planet.The largest and brightest resolved into myriads more.Even in the natural view, there was bright color here, threads of green and red and violet.Warping of the ring plane laid lakes of shadow between colored hillsides, hillsides a million kilometers across.There were occasional objects  structures?sticking far enough up from the ring plane to cast needle like shadows out system.Infrared and proper motion windows showed more conventional features: Beyond the rings lay a massive asteroid belt, and far beyond that a single jovian planet, its own million klick ring system a puny afterthought.There were no other planets, either detected or on file.The largest objects in the main ring system were three hundred kilometers across but there appeared to be thousands of them.At "Saint Rihndell's" direction they brought the ship down to the ring plane and matched velocities with the local junk.That last was a big impulsive burn: three gees for almost five minutes."Just like old, old times," Pham Nuwen said.In free fall again, they looked out upon their harbor: Up close it looked like planetary ring systems Ravna had known all her life.There were objects of all sizes down to less than a handspan across, uncounted globs of icy froth  gently touching, sticking, separating.The debris hung nearly motionless all about them; this was chaos that had been tamed long ago.In the plane of the rings, they couldn't see more than a few hundred meters.The debris blocked further views.And it wasn't all loose.Greenstalk pointed to a line of white that seemed to curve from infinity, pass close by them, and then retreat forever in the other direction."Looks like a single structure," she said.Ravna stepped up the magnification.In planetary ring systems, the "frothy snowballs" sometimes accreted into strings thousands of klicks long The white thread spread wide beyond the window.The display said it was almost a kilometer across.This arc was definitely not made of snowballs.She could see ship locks and communications nodes.Checking with images from their approach, Ravna could see that the whole thing was better than forty million kilometers long.There were a number of breaks scattered along the arc.That figured: the scaled tensile strength of such a structure could be near zero.Depending on local distortions, it would pull apart briefly, then gently come together some time later.The whole affair was vaguely reminiscent of train cars coupling and uncoupling on some old time Nyjoran railway.Over the next hour, they moved carefully in to dock at the ring arc.The only thing regular about the structure was its linearity.Some of the modules were clearly designed for linking fore and aft.Others were jumbled heaps of oddball equipment meshed in dirty ice.The last few kilometers, they drifted through a forest of ultradrive spines.Two thirds of the berths were occupied.Blueshell opened a window on Saint Rihndell's business specs."Hmm.Hm.Sir Rihndell seems extraordinarily busy. "He angled some fronds back at the ships in the exterior view.Pham: "Maybe he's running a junkyard. "Blueshell and Greenstalk went down to the cargo lock to prepare for their first trip ashore.The Skroderiders had been together for two hundred years, and Blueshell came from a star trader tradition before that.Yet the two argued back and forth about the best approach to take with "Saint Rihndell"."Of course, Harmonious Repose is typical, dear Blueshell; I would remember the type even if I'd never ridden a Skrode.But our business here is not like anything we've done before. "Blueshell grumped wordlessly, and pushed another trade packet under his cargo scarf.The scarf was more than pretty.The material was tough, elastic stuff that protected what it covered.This was the same procedure they had always followed in new ring systems, and it had worked well before.Finally he replied, "Certainly, there are differences, mainly that we have very little to trade for the repairs and no previous commercial contacts.If we don't use hard business sense we'll get nothing here!"He checked the various sensors strung across his Skrode, then spoke to the humans."Do you want me to move any of the cameras?Do they all have a clear view?"Saint Rihndell was a miser when it came to renting bandwidth  or maybe it was simply cautious.Pham Nuwen's voice came back."No.They're okay.Can you hear me?"He was speaking through a microphone inside their skrodes.The link itself was encrypted."Yes. "The Skroderiders passed through OOB's locks into Saint Rihndell's arc habitat.From within, transparency arched around them, lines of natural windows that dwindled into the distance.They looked out upon Saint Rihndell's current customers and the ring fluff beyond.The sun was dimmed in the view, but there was a haze of brightness, a super corona.That was a power sat swarm, no doubt; ring systems did not naturally make good use of the central fire.For a moment the Riders stopped in their tracks, taken by the image of a sea greater than any sea: The light might have been sunset through shallow surf.And to them, the drifting of thousands of nearby particles looked like food in a slow tidal surge.The concourse was crowded.The creatures here had ordinary enough body plans, though none were of species Greenstalk recognized for certain.The tusk leg type that ran Saint Rihndell's was most numerous.After a moment, one such drifted out from the wall near the OOB's lock.It buzzed something that came out as Triskweline: "For trading, we go this way. "Its ivory legs moved agilely across netting into an open car.The Skroderiders settled behind and they accelerated along the arc.Blueshell waggled at Greenstalk, "The old story, eh; what good are their legs now?"It was the oldest Rider humor, but it was always worth a laugh: Two legs or four legs  evolved from flippers or jaws or whatever  were all very good for movement on land.But in space, it scarcely mattered.The car was making about one hundred meters per second, swaying slightly whenever they passed from one ring segment to the next.Blueshell kept up a steady patter of conversation with their guide, the sort of pitch that Greenstalk knew was one of his great joys in life."Where are we going?What are those creatures there?What sort of things are they in search of at Saint Rihndell's?"All jovial, and almost humanly brisk.Where short term memory was failing him, he depended on his skrode.Tusk legs spoke only reduced grammar Triskweline and didn't seem to understand some of the questions: "We go to the Master Seller helper creatures those are allies of big new customer" Their guide's limited speech bothered dear Blueshell not at all; he was collecting responses more than answers.Most races had interests that were obscure to the likes of Blueshell and Greenstalk.No doubt there were billions of creatures in Harmonious Repose who were totally inscrutable to Riders or Humans or Dirokimes.Yet simple dialog often gave insight on the two most important questions: What do you have that might be useful to me, and how can I persuade you to part with it?Dear Blueshell's questions were sounding out the other, trying to find the parameters of personality and interest and ability.It was a team game the two Skroderiders played.While Blueshell chattered, Greenstalk watched everything around them, running her skrode's recorders on all bands, trying to place this environment in the context of others they had known.Technology: What would these people need?What could work?In space this flat, there would be little use for agrav fabric.And this low in the Beyond, a lot of the most sophisticated imports from above would spoil almost immediately.Workers outside the long windows wore articulated pressure suits  the force field suits of the High Beyond would last only a few weeks down here.They passed trees(?)that twisted and twisted.Some of the trunks circled the wall of the arc; others trailed along their path for hundreds of meters.Tusk leg gardeners floated everywhere about the plants, yet there was no evidence of agriculture.All this was ornament.In the ring plane beyond the windows there were occasional towers, structures that sprouted a thousand kilometers above the plane and cast the pointy shadows they had seen on their final approach to the system.Ravna's voice and Pham's buzzed against her stalk, softly asking Greenstalk about the towers, speculating on their purpose.She stored their theories for later consideration but she doubted them; some would only work in the High Beyond, and others would be clumsy given this civilization's other accomplishments.Greenstalk had visited eight ring system civilizations in her life.They were a common consequence of accidents and wars (and occasionally, of deliberate habitat design).According to OOB's library, Harmonious Repose had been a normal planetary system up till ten million years ago.Then there'd been a real estate dispute: A young race from Below had thought to colonize and exterminate the moribund inhabitants.The attack had been a miscalculation, for the moribund could still kill and the system was reduced to rubble.Perhaps the young race survived.But after ten million years, if there were any of those young killers left they would now be the most frail of the systems' elder races.Perhaps a thousand new races had passed through in that time, and almost every one had done something to tailor the rings and the gas cloud left from the debacle.What was left was not a ruin at all, but old old.The ship's library claimed that no race had transcended from Harmonious Repose in a thousand years.That fact was more important than all the others.The current civilizations were in their twilight, refining mediocrity.More than anything else, the system had the feel of an old and beautiful tide pool, groomed and tended, shielded from the exciting waves that might upset its bansai plumes.Most likely the tusk legs were the liveliest species about, perhaps the only one interested in trade with the outside.Their car slowed and spiraled into a small tower."By the Fleet, what I wouldn't give to be out there with them!"Pham Nuwen waved at the views coming in from the skrode cameras.Ever since the Riders left, he'd been at the windows, alternately gaping wide eyed at the ringscape and bouncing abstractedly between the command deck's floor and ceiling.Ravna had never seen him so absorbed, so intense.However fraudulent his memories of trading days, he truly thought he could make a difference.And he may be right.Pham came down from the ceiling, pulled close to the screen.It looked like serious bargaining was about to begin.The Skroderiders had arrived in a spherical room perhaps fifty meters across.Apparently they were floating near the center of it.A forest grew inward from all directions, and the Riders seemed to float just a few meters from the tree tops.Here and there between the branches, they could see the ground, a mosaic of flowers.Saint Rihndell's sales creatures were scattered all about the tallest trees.They sat(?)with their ivory limbs twined about the tree tops.Tusk leg races were a common thing in the galaxy, but these were the first Ravna had known.The body plan was totally unlike anything from home, and even now she didn't have a clear idea of their appearance.Sitting in the trees, their legs had more of the aspect of a skeletal fingers grasping around the trunk.Their chief rep  who claimed to be Saint Rihndell itself  had scrimshaw covering two thirds of its ivory.Two of the windows showed the carving close up; Pham seemed to think that understanding the artwork might be useful.Progress was slow.Triskweline was the common language, but good interpreting devices didn't work this deep in the Beyond, and Saint Rihndell's folk were only marginally familiar with the trade talk.Ravna was used to clean translations.Even the Net messages she dealt with were usually intelligible (though sometimes misleadingly so).They'd been talking for twenty minutes and had only just established that Saint Rihndell might have the ability to repair OOB.It was the usual Riderly driftiness, and something more.The tedium seemed to please Pham Nuwen, "Rav, this is almost like a Qeng Ho operation, face to face with critters and scarcely a common language. ""We sent them a description of our repair problem hours ago.Why should it take so long for a simple yes or no?""Because they're haggling," said Pham, his grin broadening."'Honest' Saint Rihndell here  " he waved at the scrimshawed local, " wants to convince us just how hard the job is Lord I wish I was out there. "Even Blueshell and Greenstalk seemed a little strange now.Their Triskweline was stripped down, barely more complex than Saint Rihndell's.And much of the discussion seemed very round about.Working for Vrinimi, Ravna had had some experience with sales and trading.But haggling?You had your pricing data bases and strategy support, and directions from Grondr's people.You either had a deal or you didn't.What was going on between the Riders and Saint Rihndell was one of the more alien things Ravna had ever seen."Actually, things are going pretty well I think.You saw when we arrived, the bone legs took away Blueshell's samples.By now they know precisely what we have.There's something in those samples that they want."Yeah?""Sure.Saint Rihndell isn't bad mouthing our stuff for his health. ""Damn it, it's possible we don't have anything on board they could want.This was never intended to be a trade expedition. "Blueshell and Greenstalk had scavenged "product samples" from the ship's supplies, things that the OOB could survive without.These included sensoria and some Low Beyond computer gear.Some of that would be a serious loss.But one way or another, we need those repairs.Pham chuckled."No.There's something there Saint Rihndell wants.Otherwise he wouldn't still be jawing And see how he keeps needling us about his 'other customers' needs'?Saint Rihndell is a human kind of a guy. "Something like human song came over the link to the Riders.Ravna phased Greenstalk's cameras toward the sound.From the forest "floor" on the far side of Blueshell, three new creatures had appeared."Why they're beautiful.Butterflies," said Ravna."Huh?""I mean they look like butterflies.You know?Um.Insects with large colored wings. "Giant butterflies, actually.The newcomers had a generally humanoid body plan.They were about 150 centimeters tall and covered with soft looking brown fur.Their wings sprouted from behind their shoulder blades.At full spread they were almost two meters across, soft blues and yellows, some more intricately patterned than others.Surely they were artificial, or a gengineered affectation; they would have been useless for flying about in any reasonable gravity.But here in zero gee The three floated at the entrance for just a moment, their huge, soft eyes looking up at the Riders.Then they swept their wings in measured sweeps, and drifted gracefully into the air above the forest.The entire effect was like something out of a children's video.They had pert, button noses, like pet jorakorns, and eyes as wide and bashful as any human animator ever drew.Their voices sounded like youngsters singing.Saint Rihndell and his buddies sidled around their tree tops.The tallest visitor sang on, its wings gently flexing.After a moment, Ravna realized it was speaking fluent Trisk with a front end adapted to the creature's natural speech:  "Saint Rihndell, greetings!Our ships are ready for your repairs.We have made fair payment, and we are in a great hurry.Your work must begin at once!"Saint Rihndell's Trisk specialist translated the speech for his boss.Ravna leaned across Pham's back."So maybe our friendly repairman really is overbooked," she said.   "Yeah. "Saint Rihndell came back around his treetop.His little arms picked at the green needles as he made a reply."Honored Customers.You made offer of payment, not fully accepted.What you ask is in short supply, difficult to   do. "The cuddly butterfly made a squeaking noise that might have passed for joyous laughter in a human child.The sense behind its singing was different: "Times are changing, Rihndell creature!Your people must learn: We will not be stymied.You know my fleet's sacred mission.We count every passing hour against you.Think on the fleet you will face if your lack of cooperation is ever known  is ever even suspected. "There was a sweep of blue and yellow wings, and the butterfly turned.Its dark, bashful eyes rested on the Riders."And these potted plants, they are customers?Dismiss them.Till we are gone, you have no other customers. "Ravna sucked in a breath.The three had no visible weapons, but she was suddenly afraid for Blueshell and Greenstalk."Well, what do you know," Pham said."Butterflies in jackboots. "According to the clock, it took less than half an hour for the Skroderiders to make it back.It seemed a lot longer to Pham Nuwen, even though he tried to keep up a casual front with Ravna.Maybe they were both keeping up a front; he knew she still considered him a fragile case.But the Riders' cameras showed no more signs of the killer butterflies.Finally the cargo lock cracked open and Blueshell and Greenstalk were back."I was sure the wily tusk legs was just pretending there was strong demand," said Blueshell.He seemed as eager to rehash the story as Pham was."Yeah, I thought so too.
