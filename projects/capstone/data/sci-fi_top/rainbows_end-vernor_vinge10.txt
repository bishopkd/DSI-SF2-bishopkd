I didn't think we were that good.</sm>  "There's no need, Dad.There maybe follow up questioning about particular points, but we've dredged up all the dirty little secrets.You've been under interrogation for several days. "His father's eyes widened slightly.After a moment, he gave a nod."Yeah, all those weird dreams So that means you know about, about my own problems?""Yes. "Robert looked away."There are strange bad guys out there, Bob.The Mysterious Stranger  the one who hijacked Zulfi Sharif  he was on my case all the time.I've never known anyone who could manipulate me as he did.Can you imagine someone riding on your shoulder all the time, telling you what to do?"Eve  > Bob: <sm>Just as well not to follow up on the Rabbit.</sm>  Bob nodded.Rabbit  that was the name they had pried out of the Indo Europeans  might be something new under the sun.Rabbit had compromised the SHE.Scenario building within the DHS and USMC had actually been in support of Rabbit.The Indians and the Europeans and the Japanese had a lot to answer for, but Rabbit's scam might never have been detected if they hadn't launched their revocation attack against the creature.But how had Rabbit managed its trick?What else could it do?Those were burning questions, but not ones to discuss with your trai torous father."We're taking care of the loose ends, Dad.Meantime, you have results and consequences to catch up on. ""Yes.Consequences. "Robert's right hand played nervously with the chair's fine upholstery."Prison?"The words came out softly, almost a request.Eve  > Bob: <sm>No way.We want this guy running loose.</sm>  "No jail time, Dad.Officially, you and your pals were part of a campus demonstration that got wildly out of hand.Less officially  well, the rumor we're peddling is that you helped stop terrorist lab sabotage. "That would be another job for the ever useful Friends of Privacy.Robert shook his head."Stopping the bad guys, that part was Miri's idea. ""Yes, it was. "He gave his father a stony look."I was officer of the watch that night. "Eve  > Bob: <sm>Careful, Colonel.</sm> But the warning was empty.The interrogation strategists had agreed that Robert should learn part of this.The only problem was how to tell Dad without putting a fist into his face."Here?In San Diego?"Bob nodded."For CONUS Southwest, but all our action was here.Alice was my top analyst that night. "He hesitated, trying to hold down his rage."Did you ever guess that it was Alice who kept me from booting your ass out of the house?""I  " He swept his hand through unruly hair."She always seems so remote. ""Do you know what JITT stick is, Dad?"An abrupt nod: "Yes.Carlos Rivera gets stuck in Chinese.Is he okay?"The old man looked up and his face turned ashen."Alice ?""Alice collapsed right in the middle of your adventure.We have good evidence that the  "  Eve  > Bob: <sm>No details, please.</sm>  Bob continued with barely a hesitation, "She's still stuck. ""Bob I never meant her any harm.I was just so desperate.But maybe, maybe I set her up. "He looked into Bob's eyes and then away."We know, Dad.It came out in your debrief.And yes, you did set her up. "DHS had investigated the Gu home and personal logs as much as they had anything at UCSD; they even had pictures of the bot Dad had used in the front bathroom.But we still don't know exactly what it did .India and Japan and Europe blamed Rabbit, and Rabbit had been reduced to rumors and unreadable chunks of stale cache.Eve  > Bob: <sm>Heh.We'll figure it out.A network attack on a bio prepped victim  that's a technology that's way too interesting to ignore.</sm>  Dad's head was bowed."I'm sorry.I'm so sorry. "Bob stood up abruptly.It was something of an achievement that his voice came out calm and steady."You'll be out of here later today.Meantime, get something to wear and catch up with the outside world.For a while, you'll still live with us in Fallbrook.We want you to take up right where you left off.I'll tell Miri about Alice  "  "Bob, it won't work.Miri could never forgive  "  "That's probably true.But she's going to get the abbreviated version.After all, your part in the attack on Alice is circumstantial.And it's hidden behind security that even Miri Gu is unlikely to penetrate.I strongly suggest that you don't spell things out for her. "And so Lieutenant Colonel Robert Gu, Jr., had performed the duty that he'd been assigned here.And now he could get out.He walked across the room, reached for the door.Something made him turn and look back.Robert Gu, Sr., was watching with anguish in his eyes.It was a look Bob had seen before, on other faces.There had been times over the years, when youngsters in his command had fucked totally up.Young people get desperate.Young people do terrible, foolish, selfish things  sometimes with terrible consequences.But this is my old man !There was no desperation, no inexperience that could excuse him.And yet Bob had watched the CDC team's video as they followed Sharif's direction down into the labs.He had seen his father and daughter lying on the floor, just beyond the UP/Ex crater.He had seen the way Robert's arm was extended, how it dammed the curdling stone just inches from Miri's face.And so, despite the old man's monstrous fuckup, there was still something left to say:  "Thanks for saving her, Dad. ""Take up just where you left off," Bob had said.At Fairmont High, that was almost feasible.Juan and Robert had already taken their written final exams, then been out of action through Christmas and New Year's.Now they were back, and just in time for what most students considered the scariest part of the semester: the Parents' Night demonstration of their team projects.Problems of life and death and horrid guilt devolved to worrying about making a fool of oneself in front of some children and their parents.Amazingly, Juan Orozco was still talking to him.Juan didn't know quite what had happened at UCSD.His memories had been gutted even more systematically than Miri's.Now he was piecing things together from the news, trying his best to separate the truth from Friends of Privacy lies."I don't remember anything after Miri and I got to campus.And the police are still holding what I wore.I can't even see the last few minutes of my diary!"The kid waved his arms with the same desperation Robert had seen in him the first day they met.Robert patted his shoulder."They still have Miri's log, too. ""I know !I asked her. "Tears welled up in the boy's eyes."She doesn't remember either.We were getting to be friends, Robert.We wouldn't have gone after you together if she couldn't trust me. "Sure."Well, now she treats me like when we first met  pushing me away.She thinks I must have chickened out and that's why she had to find you by herself.And maybe I was chicken.I don't remember !"Lena  > Juan, Xiu: <sm>Give her time, Juan.Miri's distracted by what's happened, especially to her mother.I think she blames herself for that, and maybe all of us.I know you wouldn't chicken out.</sm>  Lena  > Xiu: <sm>But why he's asking the SOB for comfort is beyond me.</sm>  Juan looked away from Robert for a moment, gradually seemed to get himself back together.Robert gave the boy an awkward pat on the back.Comforting others was definitely not part of his former resume."She'll come around, Juan.She didn't call you a coward when we were underground.She was very worried about you.Just give her some time. "He cast around for some distraction."Meantime, do you want to waste all the work we put in this semester?What about the kids in Boston and down South?We have to catch up on our demo preparation. "Lena  > Xiu: <sm>Can you believe this jerk?All he wants is to trick some more help out of the boy.</sm>  Robert's attempt at humor was feeble, but Juan looked up at Robert and gave a creditable smile."Yes.Gotta keep track of the important things!"Bob and Miri didn't come to Fairmont High for the vocational track demos.At least they weren't physically visible  and Robert could tell that Juan Orozco was searching hard."Miri's at Crick's Clinic tonight, Juan.Her mother should be coming home from the hospital. "Bob had seemed just as happy that Robert had another commitment this evening.The boy brightened."But maybe she'll peek in here, right?"In fact this was rather a big deal for Fairmont, but not for good reasons.The popular press had built an enormous pile of speculation around the events at UCSD, and Friends of Privacy lies surrounded and embedded those speculations in conspiracies unending.The rumors contaminated everything and everyone associated with that night.Robert had dredged the public record  first to try to discover what had happened to him that night under UCSD, and then to see what people thought had happened.Robert and the cabal showed up in most of the theories, often as the picaresque heroes Bob had mentioned.But there were other theories.Robert had never heard of Timothy Huynh, but there were journalists who claimed that Huynh and Robert had engineered everything that happened in the riot and the underground!Robert had become very good at blocking paparazzi mail, but the notoriety was blowing over; his ratings were declining with a half life of about five days.Nevertheless, he spent a lot of time at Fairmont High, where the school rules banned the most intrusive visibles.Tonight, at the demos, that ban was in force.The bleachers were jammed with ticketed visitors  families of students and their guests, including virtual presences.Most of these people had no interest in Robert Gu.But if you looked at the network stats, a lot of people were invisibly watching.The vocational program was not the gem of Fairmont High.Most of these kids could not master the latest, cutting edge applications (and most of the retread students were even less competent).On the other hand, Chumlig had asserted in an unguarded moment that parents preferred the vocational demos, mainly because they made more sense to them than what other children were doing.The teams were duos and trios, but they were allowed to use solutions dredged from all over the world.Demo night didn't begin until after sunset, so meshing overlays with reality would be relatively easy.Chumlig wouldn't have given the regular students such a crutch.Those demos lasted two days  and would not begin until a week after the vocational track students had done their best.That was a kindly interval, a week for the vocational students to bask in their achievements.Tonight, the audience sat on the west side of the soccer field, leaving the east free for whatever grandiose imagery might be created.Robert sat with Juan Orozco right down on the sidelines, with the other performers.They all knew the order of their execution, er, performance.Their private views hung little signs over the field showing how much time remained in the current demo and who was up next.There had been no democratic choosing of the performance order.Louise Chumlig and the other teachers had their own ideas, and they ruled.Robert smiled to himself.In this, his old people sense hadn't deserted him.Even without knowing the details of each project, he knew who had a strong project and who did not.He knew who was the most frightened of getting out in public and in person So did Chumlig.Her play order was an orchestration, exercising each kid to his or her limits.Amazingly, that ordering also produced a pretty good show.The Radner twins started out.For these two, the east side of the campus was not enough.They had some kind of wacky suspension bridge  it looked like the Firth of Forth Railway Bridge, but scaled up  that put down steel caissons on each side of the bleachers, and then climbed higher and higher into the northeast till it broke into the departing daylight.Seconds passed  and the construction reappeared out of the southwest , their nineteenth century masterpiece making a virtual orbit of the Earth.The climax was the roaring passage of vast, steam powered trains across the sky.The bleachers shook with the apparent power of the locomotives."Hey!"said Juan, and gave Robert a nudge."That's new.They must have figured out some of the building maintenance protocols. "If the Radners had not been targeted by the Library Riot rumor mill before, they were now.Robert guessed that would please the twins just fine.Most of the demos were arty, visual things.But there were also students who had built gadgets.Doris Schley and Mahmoud Kwon had built a ground effect vehicle that could walk up the steps of the bleachers.They tipped it over the top; there was an explosion of sound, and then it touched down without breaking anything.Juan stood up from his place at the bottom of the bleachers to turn and watch with his own eyes.He cheered Schley and Kwon, then plunked himself back down."Wow, a ground effect parachute.But I bet Ms.Chumlig doesn't give'm more than a B. "His voice rose into a standard Louise Chumlig imitation: " 'What you did was scarcely more than off the shelf engineering. '"But he was still grinning.They both knew that a B was better than what most of the image plays were going to get.There were even kids who tried for the cutting edge, projects that seemed a little like what Miri said her friends did.There were two new materials demos, an extreme elastic band, and some kind of water filter.The elastic was not spectacular  until you realized there was no trick imagery.Two boys that Robert hardly knew did the demo.They stood twenty feet apart, swinging a large doll between them.The mannikin was suspended from a strand of their magical glop.The strand wasn't simply a strong composite.Somehow the boys could change its physical characteristics by the way they squeezed the ends.Sometimes if behaved like a giant spring, whipping the doll back to the center line.Other times, it stretched like taffy, and they swung the dummy in wide arcs.Their demo got the biggest cheers of all.On the other hand, the water filter demo was just a magnified image of a garden hose feeding into the filter.Above them, the students had floated an enormous graphic that showed just how their programmable zeolite could search for user specified impurities.There were no sound effects, and the graphics were slow moving and crude.Robert looked up into the sky and then back at the girls."They're going to get an A, aren't they?"Juan rocked back on his elbows.He was smiling, but enviously."Yeah.It's the sort of thing Chumlig likes. "And then his basic honesty forced him to add, "Lisa and Sandi never bother to polish their graphics, but I heard they've got a buyer for that water filter.I bet they're the only vocational kids who make real money off their demo. ""We're next, kiddo," said Robert.The only evidence that Juan understood was the way his gaze fixed on their private clock.Xiu  > Juan: <sm>You'll do fine, Juan.</sm>  Juan  > Xiu: <sm>Is Miri watching?</sm>  Juan and Robert were last, the only part of the schedule that was really beyond Chumlig's control.That had not been due to any Juan/Robert cleverness.It had been a consequence of the fact that their demo involved outside groups who had their own scheduling problems.Juan hesitated a second more.Then he was running out onto the soccer field, waving up a phantom stage parallel to and facing the bleachers.Their performers filed in from both sides of the stage.The imagery was subdued, with no impossibilities.These were real people and real musical instruments, as Juan's magnified voice explained to the audience."Hello, hello, hello !"Juan was huckster enthusiastic, and  to Robert's ears  clearly panicked out of his mind.Robert could have handled the emcee role, or they could have recorded this spiel, maybe have had Juan lip synch it  but that was just another way to lose points with Chumlig.So Juan made do with his live, cracking voice and words that came out with awkward pauses and forced bravado."Ladies and gentlemen!Meet the Orchestra of the Americas, created especially for you this evening from the Charles River High School orchestra and chorus, cheapnet live from Boston and  " he waved to his left "  the Gimnasio Clasico de Magal lanes, also cheapnet live but from Punta Arenas, Chile!"Both sides of the stage were full now, two hundred teenagers in school uniforms of red on the north and checkered green on the south: students who had their own "far cooperation" requirements to satisfy.Altogether they comprised parts of two choruses and two orchestras, seven thousand miles apart, with only cheapnet in between.Persuading them to try this scheme had been a miracle in itself.Success would look mundane to outsiders, yet failure was a real possibility.Well, things didn't go too badly in rehearsal ."And now  " Juan grabbed for still greater import"  and now, ladies and gentlemen, the Orchestra of the Americas will perform their very own adaptation of Beethoven's EU Anthem, with lyrics by Orozco and Gu, and network synchrony by Gu and Orozco!"He gave a hammy bow and ran back to the sidelines to sit by Robert.Sweat was streaming down his face, and he looked pale."You did good, kid," said Robert.Juan just nodded, shaking.The hybrid orchestra began to play.Now it was up to these kids and Robert's jitter algorithm.The sounds of cellos and basses rose from the young musicians in Boston and from the other end of the world.The kids' adaptation had a faster beat than the usual EU style.And every note came across hundreds of hops of randomly changing networkery, with delays that could vary by several hundred milliseconds.There was the same synchronization problem that had made Winnie's choir at the library such a noisy affair.Juan's lyrics climbed up, the chorus from the north singing his English version, and the one from the south his Spanish.Their student collaborators had created a flexible work with its own conductor interface; that helped some.Plus they were surprisingly good musicians and singers.But the performance still needed the magic of the adaptive delays that Robert's scheme injected into the transmissions (well, okay, and maybe also the far deeper magic that was Beethoven's).Robert listened.His contribution was not perfect.In fact, this was worse than the rehearsals.Too many people were watching, and too suddenly .He'd been afraid this might happen.The problem was not bandwidth.He glanced at the variance plot he had put in his private view.It showed the presence of several million people suddenly observing, grabbing resources so fast that they confused his poor little prediction program  and changed the nature of what was observed.And yet, the synch survived.The hybrid did not fragment.Ten seconds to go.The performance hit some slightly ragged crescen dos, and then, by some miracle, everything came together for the last two seconds.Juan's lyrics ended, and the central melody swept into silence.The joint orchestra/chorus looked out at the audience.They were smiling, some perhaps a little embarrassed  but they had brought it off!There was applause, wildly enthusiastic from some quarters.Poor Juan looked absolutely drained.Fortunately, he didn't have to venture out on the field to wind things up.The performers were making their bows and trooping to the north and south ends of the stage  back to their respective corners of the world.Juan's smile was a little sickly as he waved to the local audience.His voice came sideways to Robert."Hey, I don't care what grade it gets.We did it and we're done!"34    The British Museum and the British Library  The kids rushed off the bleachers, only slightly impeded by the fact that Chumlig & Co could review the evening and determine just who had been unacceptably bumptious.Juan and Robert were slower, hanging with the other demo students and exchanging congratulations.Grades for the demos wouldn't be available for another twenty hours or so.They would have plenty of time to agonize over their failings.Nevertheless, Louise Chumlig looked quite cheerful, giving each student her congratulations  and deflecting all manner of questions about whether this or that deficit should truly be of any grading significance.Still no sign of Miri or Bob.Robert's attention was filled with the kids and Chumlig and Juan Orozco  this last person alternating between hysterical relief and the conviction of failure.So it was without forewarning that Robert found himself face to face  almost nose to nose  with Winston Blount.Behind the former dean, Tommie Parker was standing hand in hand with Xiu Xiang.Now, that was surely the strangest pairing to come out of this adventure!The little guy was grinning ear to ear.He flashed a thumbs up at Robert.But for the moment, Blount had all his attention.Robert had seen little of Tommie and Winnie since that night at UCSD.They and Carlos had spent several days at Crick's Clinic.As far as Robert could tell, certain deals had been made, much as in his own case.And now they were loose.The official story was just what Bob had said: The cabal activity had been a protest that got out of hand, but they had never intended to damage laboratory equipment and they were all terribly sorry for that.The unofficial tales of heroic sacrifice helped explain why the university and the bio labs seemed happy not to pursue the matter.If the Elder Cabal kept its collective mouth shut, there would be no Consequences.Just now there was an odd smile on Winnie's face.He nodded to Juan and reached out to shake Robert's hand."Even though I've dropped out of Fairmont, I still I have family here.Doris Schley is my great grandniece. ""Oh!She did well, Winston!""Thank you, thank you.And you  Winnie hesitated.In years past, praise for Robert Gu came from all quarters and it had often been used as a club to beat down Winston Blount.  "you wrote something wonderful there, Robert.Those lyrics.I would never have imagined such a thing riding on Beethoven and in English and Spanish.It was art. "He shrugged, as if waiting for a sarcastic putdown."It wasn't my work, Winston. "And maybe this is a putdown, but I don't mean it that way ."Juan here did the lyrics.We collaborated all through the semester, but on this I let him go, just critiqued the final effort.Honestly  and this Chumlig character is the death of lies  honestly, Juan is responsible. ""Oh?"Winnie rocked back, then really seemed to notice Juan.He reached over to shake the boy's hand."It was beautiful, son. "And a sideways, still incredulous, glance at Robert."Do you know, Robert, in its way, that was as good as what you did in the old days?"Robert thought a second, listening to Juan's lyrics with his imagination the way he used to listen to his own poetry.No, I was better than that .Much better.But not better like being in a different world.If the old Robert could have seen these lyrics well, the old Robert couldn't abide second raters.Given half an excuse, he would have made sure that Juan's art died aborning."You're right.Juan made a beautiful thing. "He hesitated."I don't know what the years have done, Winston. "Juan looked back and forth between them.There was the beginning of shining pride on his face, though he seemed to guess that there were words unspoken going between Winnie and Robert.Winnie nodded."Yes.Lots of things have changed. "The crowd was diminishing, but that just meant that some of the kids thought they could run around even faster.They were getting jostled by the flow of bodies and the ever louder shouting and laughter."So if you didn't do the lyrics, what was your contribution, Robert?""Aha!I did the time lag synchronization. "As much as it could be done ."Really?"Winnie was trying to be polite, but even after his own choir experience, he didn't seem especially impressed.Well, it had been a bit ragged.Xiu  > Lena: <sm>For God's sake, say something to him, Lena!</sm>  Lena  > Xiu: <sm>Buzz off, you!</sm>  Xiu  > Lena: <sm>Then I will speak for you.</sm>  After a few more pleasantries, Winnie took off in the direction of the Schley family, Tommie and Xiu Xiang in tow.But Robert noticed a line of golden text drifting out behind Xiang.Xiu  > Robert: <sm>That was great, Robert.</sm> Juan was oblivious of Xiang's silent message."Dean Blount didn't understand your part in our project, did he?""No.But he liked what he did understand.It doesn't matter.You and I both did better than we thought we could. ""Yes, we really did. "Juan led him back along the bleachers.Even if Bob and Miri weren't here, Juan's own parents were.Greetings and congratulations all around, though the Orozcos still didn't know what to make of Robert Gu.A clot OF family and friends remained on the soccer field for some time.More than anything else, the parents seemed faintly surprised by their children.They loved the little klutzes, but they thought they knew their limits.Somehow Chumlig had transformed them  not into supermen, but into clever creatures who could do things the parents themselves had never mastered.It was a time for pride and a little uneasiness.Miri was still out of sight.Poor Juan.And I hope Alice got home okay .One armed, he wasn't quite good enough to check that in mid flight.Robert pressed into the densest part of the crowd, the folks swirling close around Louise Chumlig.She looked happy and tired, and mostly she denied responsibility."I just showed my students how to use what they have and what the world has. "He reached across, managed to catch her hand."Thanks. "Chumlig looked up at him, a crooked smile on her face.She held on to his hand for a moment."You!My very strangest child.You were almost the reverse of the problem I had with the others. ""How's that?""For everyone else, I had to make them reach out to learn what they were.But you first you had give up what you had been. "Her smile was fleetingly sad."Be sorry for what you lost, Robert, but be happy with what you are. "All along, she knew !But someone else had her attention, and she was gaily assuring them all that the rest of the school year would be even more exciting than what had gone before.Robert left Juan and the others when speculation turned to what the regular demos would be like.The kids didn't want to believe that they could be outdone, not after tonight.Robert spotted two familiar figures on his walk back to the traffic circle."I thought you were with Winston," he said."We were," said Tommie, "but we came back.Wanted to congratulate you on your music synch gimmick. "Xiu Xiang nodded agreement.Of the two, only she was wearing.A Congrats logo floated out from her.Poor Tommie was still lugging around his laptop, though whatever remained inside surely belonged to the secret police."Thanks.I'm proud of it, but emphasize the word 'gimmick. 'No one really needs to synch manual music across thousands of miles of cheapnet.And basically, I just took advantage of routing predictabilities plus knowledge of the music being played. ""Plus some timing analysis of the individual performers.Right, right?"said Tommie."Yes. ""Plus some counter jitter you inserted," said Xiu.Robert hesitated."You know, it was fun . "Tommie laughed."You should do some ego surfing.Your hack was noticed.Back when I was young, you could have got a patent off it.Nowadays  "  Xiu patted Tommie's shoulder."Nowadays, it should be worth a decent grade in a high school class.You and I  we have things to learn, Thomas. "Tommie made a grumbling noise."She means I should be learning to wear. "He glanced at the young looking woman."I never dreamed that X.  Xiang would end up saving my life.But of course she did it by getting us all arrested!"Lena  > Xiu: <sm>Parker is afraid to try new things, even when he brags about the future.</sm>  They walked in silence for a few steps.There were more golden words from Xiang; she was getting better and better at silent messaging.Xiu  > Robert: <sm><sigh/>Tommie is old, and all the medicine hasn't helped him that much.He's afraid to try new things."</sm>  Robert stifled a startled glance at the woman.Since when had the geek become a parlor shrink?But she could be right about Tommie.Tommie was surely oblivious of all the sming, but a familiar crafty grin was spreading across his face."What?"Robert finally said."Just thinking.Our UCSD op was the biggest and most dangerous I've ever been part of.We got used, yeah.But you know, it was like of lot of these modern whatsits  these affiliances.We contributed, and in one way, we got what we were aiming for. "Robert thought of the Stranger's promises."How is that?""We nailed the Huertas Librareome Project. ""But the library books are all consumed. "Tommie shrugged."I kind of like the Library Militant vision.The point is, we terminally embarrassed Huertas. ""That's a triumph?"They were walking along the traffic circle now, followed by a hopeful automobile."Yup.You can't stop progress, but we stopped Huertas long enough for other events to come to our rescue. "He glanced at Robert."You haven't heard?You wear all that fancy equipment and you can't keep up with news. "Tommie didn't wait for a reply: "Y'see, Huertas was in such an awful rush for a reason.It turns out, the Chinese were chewing up the British Museum and Library faster than we ever guessed.And the Chinese have years of experience in semi nondestructive digitization.They're positively gentle compared to Huertas's shredder operation.They made the San Diego effort look foolish, and they even got haptic data off non book exhibits.There's clear sky between them and everyone else, including the Google archives.Anyway, we stalled Huertas by a few days, long enough that he can't claim any sort of priority.And it was long enough so that the Chinese were able to frost the cake. "Tommie reached into his jacket and pulled out a three inch square piece of plastic."Here.A present for you, that cost me all of $19.99. "Robert held up the dark plastic.It looked a lot like the diskettes he'd used on his old PC at the turn of the century.He pointed a query at it.La bels floated in the air: Data Card.128PB capacity.97% in use .There was more, but Robert just looked back at Tommie."Do people still use removables like this?""Just paranoid propertarian old farts like me.It's a nuisance to carry around, but I have a reader right here in my laptop. "Of course."The data is all online, along with a lot of cross analysis that the Chinese will be charging you extra for.But even if you don't have a card reader, I thought you'd be interested in holding this in your own hot little hands. ""Ah. "Robert peeked at the top directory.It was like standing on a very high mountaintop."So this is  ?""The British Museum and Library, as digitized and databased by the Chinese Informagical Coalition.The haptics and artifact data are lo res, to make it all fit on one data card.But the library section is twenty times as big as what Max Huertas sucked out of UCSD.Leaving aside things that never got into a library, that's essentially the record of humanity up through 2000.The whole premodern world. "Robert hefted the plastic card."It doesn't seem like very much. "Tommie laughed."Well, it's not!"Robert started to hand it back, but Tommie waved him off."Like I said, it's a present.Put it on the wall where you can remind yourself that it's all we ever were.But if you really want to see it, just look on the net.The Chinese have it pretty well meshed.And their special servers are really clever. "Tommie stepped back and motioned to the car that was trailing them.The rear door opened and he waved Xiu in ahead of him.For a weird instant Tommie looked like an old rake with some sweet young thing.Just another image from the past that had nothing to do with the truth."So Huertas is out of the shredding business, and the Chinese promise their follow ups will be even gentler than what they did to the British Library.Imagine soft pinky robot hands, patiently picking over all the libraries and museums of the world.They'll be cross checking, scanning for annotations  giving whole new generations of academic types like Zulfi Sharif something to hang their degrees on. "He waved at Robert."Hi ho!"It was almost midnight when Xiu Xiang got back to Rainbows End.Lena was still up.She was in the kitchen, fixing some kind of snack.Lena's osteoporosis forced her to lean so far forward that her face was just a few inches off the table.It looked strange, but the wheelchair and the kitchen's design gave her plenty of freedom to maneuver.Xiu eased into the room, feeling entirely embarrassed."Sorry for cutting you out, Lena  "  The other twisted around to give her a direct look.There was a lopsided grin on her face."Hey, no problem.You young people need your privacy. "She waved for Xiu to sit down and have something to eat."Yes.Well, Tommie isn't really so young. "She felt a blush coming on."I, um, don't mean physically.He wants to keep up with progress, but he just can't cope with everything that means. "Lena shrugged."Tommie's mind is better than some. "She grabbed a sandwich off her plate and gave it a munch."Do you think he'll ever get his edge back?""Could be.Science marches on.And even if that doesn't help in Parker's case, we can give him pushes in the right direction.A big part of his problem is that life was too easy for him when he was young.He's too ornery to try anything that's really hard for him. "She jabbed a hand in Xiu's direction."Eat up. "Xiu nodded and reached for a sandwich.They had been over this before.In fact, it had been such discussions that had made all the difference for a certain Dr.X.  Xiang.But maybe she had more on the ball than Tommie.Her chief problem in the near future might be in avoiding government "job offers. "Xiu bit into the sandwich.Peanut butter and jelly.But not bad really."Have you had a chance to do your thing with the various people we saw today?""Play shrink, you mean?Yeah, I reviewed your Epiphany log; I posted some anonymous consults.The advice we gave Carlos Rivera was fine.He's got an ongoing problem, but that's life.As for Juan, we've done our best there, at least for the moment. "Xiu smiled around a mouthful of peanut butter and jelly.It had taken her some time to realize what a genius Lena was.After all, psychiatry was such a soft specialty.Lena said little Miri loved to view her grandmother as a some kind of female wizard.She claimed to know that even though the girl never announced the fact.Now Xiu had realized Lena was everything Miri imagined, at least metaphorically.I've never understood other people, but with Lena seeing out of my eyes and chatting in my ear, I am learning .There were still mysteries: "I don't understand why your granddaughter is pushing Juan away.Sure, the kids don't remember what really happened in Pilchner Hall, but we know they were coming to be friends.If we could only get Miri's logs"  what the government was still withholding.Lena didn't answer directly."You know Alice is home from hospital?""Yes!I caught the fact from you, no details. ""There won't be any details.'Alice was sick and now she's better. 'In fact, I've known for a long time that Alice plays dice for her own soul.She nearly lost it this time, and somehow that's related to my ex husband's grand screwup at UCSD.I think Alice will recover.That should help Juan with Miri. "Lena sat back in her chair.Or rather, she let the chair tilt into a different posture.On her own, Lena couldn't really straighten up."We've talked about this before.Miri can be stubborn to the point of being an asshole.She inherited that trait from the SOB, skipping a generation over Bob.And now that stubbornness has latched on to some deep down guilt: subconsciously Miri feels that she and Juan messed up and did this terrible thing to Alice. ""um, that doesn't really sound like science, Lena. ""I'm sparing you the technicalities. "Xiu nodded."You get results.There are people at Fairmont High who think I'm some sort of human relations genius.Me!"Lena reached her hand a few inches across the table, as far as her twisted bones could go.Xiu took the hand gently in her own."We've made a good team, haven't we?"said Lena."Yes. "It wasn't just Lena's way with people.It wasn't just saving Tom mie and his friends.There had been those dark days at the beginning of her time at Fairmont, when she was sure she could never come back  and Lena wasn't so happy go lucky either.Together they had climbed into the daylight.Xiu looked at the little old lady who was ten years younger than herself.Together, Lena and I have become something rather remarkable .Apart ?"Lena, do you think I'll ever be good at seeing into people the way you do?"Lena shrugged and gave a little smile."Oh, I don't know. "Xiu cocked her head, remembering little incidents here and there across the last few months.Lena Gu almost never lied outright.She seemed to realize what that would do to her credibility.But Lena could deceive, even in the face of a direct question."Do you know, Lena, when you say 'oh, I don't know' and shrug  that means you're thinking 'not in a million years?'"Lena's eyes widened.She gave Xiu's hand a squeeze."um.Well, there you go.Maybe in this case it won't take a million years!""Good.Because I want to tell you, Lena I don't think Robert is the SOB you remember.I think he's really changed. "Lena's hand slipped away from hers."I take it back.In your case, a million years may not be enough. "Xiu reached out, but Lena's hand was back in her lap.Never mind.There were things that had to be said."Robert was brutal in the beginning, but look how he has helped Juan.I have a theory. "She flicked the Nature citation across the table at Lena.This wasn't really her own theory."Robert has had the equivalent of major trauma, the sort of thing that rebuilds a personality's worldview. ""You read too much crap science, Xiu.Leave that to us professionals. ""It's as if he's been all unwound.He has his memories, but physically he's just a young man.He has a second chance to get things right.Can't you see that, Lena?"Lena flinched at the words, then hunched forward even more.She was silent for a long moment, staring down at her twisted body, her head swaying in gentle negation.Finally she cranked her gaze up to Xiu's.Something that might have been a tear glinted in her eye."You have a lot to learn, my girl. "And with that Lena backed away from the table, her chair making an agile rise and turn. "'Fraid I'm done for the evening. "She rolled off toward her bedroom.Xiu took care of the dishes.Usually Lena insisted on doing the kitchen work."That's something I can still do with my own hands," she often said.Not tonight.And if I were just a little more clever about people , thought Xiu, I might know why .35    The Missing Apostrophe  Zulfikar Sharif was no longer in the graduate program at Oregon State.Robert encountered a very old fashioned error message: "No longer a registered student, no longer at OSU. "Even Sharif's enum was a stub labeled "vacated. "That was a little scary.Robert hunted around.Worldwide, there were about a thousand matches for "Z* Sharif. "None of the accessible ones were a good match.The rest were people trying with various degrees of competence to keep their privacy.But the Zulfi Sharif whom Robert sought was still a techno bumpkin.After an hour or two, Robert had tracked him down to the University of Kolkata.Sharif was very subdued."Professor Blandings dimissed me. ""From the OSU graduate program?In my time, we professors were not so powerful. ""Professor Blandings had help from your authorities.I spent several weeks trying to explain myself to some very insistent U. S.  government agents.They couldn't believe that I was an innocent who had succeeded in being multiply hijacked. ""Hmm. "Robert looked away from Zulfi Sharif, at the city all around them.The day looked hot and muggy.Just beyond their small table, crowds swirled, young people laughing and smiling.The skyline had its share of tall and ivory towers.It was the Kolkata of modern Indian vision.For a moment he was tempted to open a second, naysayer channel and try to figure out what was real and what was hype.No, concentrate on figuring what part of Zulfi Sharif is real and what is hype ."I suppose the best evidence the cops think you're innocent is that they let you return to India. ""Indeed so, though sometimes I wonder if I'm not just a fish on a very long line. "He gave a wan smile."I really did want to do my thesis about you, Professor Gu.In the beginning, it was academic desperation.You were the trophy I could sell to Annie Blandings.But the more we talked, the more I  "  "How much was you, Sharif?How many  ?""I wondered that too!There were at least two besides myself.It was a most frustrating experience, sir, especially at the beginning.I would be in the middle of speaking with you, going through the questions that I knew would impress Professor Blandings  and then at a whack I was a mere bystander!""So you could still hear and see?""Yes, often that was so!So often that I think the others were using me to generate some questions for inspiration, and then warping them to their own purposes.In the end  and my confessing this to your police was a great mistake  in the end, I came to treasure these bizarre interventions.My dear hijackers were asking questions I would never have conceived.So I hung around throughout your Librareome conspiracy, and in the end I looked the perfect foreign provocateur. ""And if you hadn't been there the night of the riot, my Miri would have died.What did you see, Zulfi?""What?Well, I had been most thoroughly locked out that evening.The other players on my persona had agendas that did not include any discussion of literature.But I kept trying to get through.The police claimed I never would have succeeded without terrorist assistance.In any case, for a few seconds I could see you lying there on the floor.You asked for my help.The lava was creeping up against your arm" He shivered."In truth, I couldn't see any more than that. "Robert remembered that conversation.It was one of the sharpest fragments in the jumble.The two of them, eight thousand miles apart, sat in silence for a few moments.Then Sharif cocked his head quizzically."Now I am well quit of my perilous literary research.And yet, I cannot resist asking: You are at the beginning of your new life, Professor.Can we expect something new under the sun?For the first time in human history, a new Secret of the Ages?"Ah."You're right, there is room for something more.But you know  some secrets are beyond the expression of those who experience them. ""Not beyond you, sir!"Robert found himself smiling back.Sharif deserved the truth."I could write something, but it would not be poetry.I got a new life, but the Alzheimer's cure it destroyed my talent. ""Oh no!I had heard of Alzheimer failures, but I honestly never suspected you.Thinking there might be another canto of the Secrets was about the only good thing I still hoped to come out of this adventure.I am so sorry. ""Don't be too sorry.I wasn't a very nice person. "Sharif looked down and then back at Robert."I had heard that.In the days I couldn't get through to you, I interviewed your former colleagues at Stanford, even Winston Blount when he wasn't making conspiracies. ""But  "  "It doesn't matter, sir.I eventually realized that you had lost your sadistic edge. ""Then surely you would have guessed the rest!""Do you think so?Do you think your talent and your malevolence were a package deal?"Sharif leaned forward, engaged in a way that Robert had not seen since their interviews of weeks before."I doubt that.But researching the issue would be intriguing.For that matter, I have long wondered  and been too timid to ask  what really changed in you?Were you a decent fellow from the time of your dementia cure?Or was the change as in Dickens' 'A Christmas Carol,' with new experience making you kindlier?"He rocked back."I could make such a splendid thesis out of this!"His eyes swept back to Robert, questioning."No way!""Yes, yes," said Sharif, nodding."It is such a great opportunity that I almost forgot my resolutions.And the first of those resolutions is no more activities that get me mixed up with the security authorities. "He looked up, as if at unseen watchers."Do you hear that?I am clean, clean in body and soul and even in my fresh fried clothes!"And then addressing Robert once more: "In fact, I have a new academic major. ""Oh?""Yes.It will take several semesters of prerequisite fulfillment, but that will be worth it.You see, the University of Kolkata is starting a new department with new faculty, real go getters.We have a long way to go considering the competition from the universities in Mumbai  but the people here have funding, and they're willing to take on fresh faces such as myself. "He grinned enthusiasm at Robert's puzzled look."It's our new Institute of Bollywood Studies!A combination of cinema and literature.I'll be studying the influence of twentieth century lit on the latest Indian arts.And much as I regret our lost opportunities, Professor Gu, I am so happy to be in a major that will keep me out of further trouble with the authorities!"Robert was actually busy between semesters.His contrived synch hack had raised him to the lowest level of guru hood.He'd been noticed by a small company called Comms R Us.In a way it was a traditional firm.It was old (five years old), and it had three full time employees.So it wasn't as nimble as some operations, but it had managed several innovations in concurrent communications.Comms R Us had paid Robert to consult for a period of three weeks.And though it was clear that the "consult" was mainly an opportunity for Comms R Us to decide if Robert Gu had any future, Robert jumped at the chance.For the first time since he lost his marbles, he was creating something that others valued.Otherwise, things were not going entirely smoothly.Juan Orozco was gone; his parents had taken him on vacation to Puebla, where they were visiting his mother's grandfather.Juan still showed up occasionally, but Miri was not talking to him."I'm trying not to care, Robert.Maybe if I stop bothering her, Miri will let me start over with her. "Nevertheless, Robert had the feeling the boy might have camped out on their front steps if his parents had not dragged him away."I'll talk to her, Juan.I promise. "Juan had looked at him doubtfully."But don't make her think I put you up to it!""I won't.I'll choose the time carefully. "Robert had decades of experience in choosing the right time to strike.This should have been easy.Miri had wangled an Incomplete grade on her demo project.That meant that when she finally did perform, at the end of the next semester, she would have even higher standards to meet.For now, she was a busybody around the house, mainly taking care of her mother.Alice Gu was a ghost of her former self.The steel of the last fifteen weeks of their acquaintance had been torn out of her.The result was charming.More evenings than not, Alice and Miri were down in the kitchen, attempting to make hard work out of modern cookery.His daughter in law was distant, but her smile wasn't the meaningless reflex it had often seemed before.Then Bob was out of town again, and Miri seemed to be busier than ever.Every day, she had some news for him about her searches on burns and limb rehabilitation.Real soon now he should use that as an excuse to set her straight about Juan and about himself.Maybe tonight was the right night.Bob was still out of town.Alice had retired to the ground floor den shortly after dinner.None of Miri's "board games" tonight.They were fun, one of the nicer things about life since that terrible night at UCSD  but tonight Robert had finally seen his way through some of his Comms R Us problems.Working on them, he lost track of the time.When he came up for air, he had some results, maybe things worth showing his employers.What a good night!Downstairs, a door slammed.His eyes were still on his work, but he heard Miri come pounding up the stairs.She raced down the hallway and into her bedroom.A few minutes later she came out.There was a knock on his bedroom door."Hi Robert, can I show you some things I discovered today?""Sure. "She bounced into the room and grabbed a chair."I found three more projects that could help your arm. "In fact, the medical condition of Robert Gu's left arm was best characterized by its absence.It was completely burned off at the lower forearm.There were two places near the shoulder where all that was left was a strip of flesh.His "prosthesis" was more like an old style plaster cast.But interestingly, the medics had passed on the opportunity to whack the thing off and fit him with some modern miracle.Reed Weber  the physician's assistant had resurfaced now that the MDs needed someone to front for them  had explained the situation, though perhaps not in quite the way the doctors would like: "You're a victim of the new field of 'prospective medicine,' Robert.You see, we have prosthetics with five finger motor control, and with almost the durability of a natural arm.But they're a little heavy and the sensor system is nowhere near the real thing.On the other hand, there are clear trends in nerve and bone regeneration tech.Even though no one knows quite how it will happen  or if it will happen  the odds are that in eighteen months they'll be able to grow out from what you have now, into an effective natural arm.And the MDs are afraid that debriding what's left of your arm for a prosthesis might make the later solution much more expensive.So for a while you are stuck with a solution that wouldn't have impressed your own grandfather. "And Robert had nodded and not complained.Every day with this dead weight on his shoulder was a small penance, a reminder of how close his foolishness had come to destroying lives.Miri was oblivious of all that.In fact, she had dismissed "prospective medicine" as stupidity.Miri believed in making her own medical solutions."So there are these three teams, Robert.One of them has grown a complete monkey's paw, another is into whole limb prosthesis, but very lightweight, and the third has some improvements in neurocoding.I bet your Comms R Us friends would put you up as a fast track guinea pig.What do you think?"Robert touched the plastic shell that held the remains of his arm."Ah, I think a deal involving a monkey's paw is too risky for me. ""No, no, you wouldn't have a monkey's paw.The monkey's paw was just  " Then she got a Googling look."Robert!I'm not talking about some old story.I'm trying to help you.I want to more than ever.I owe you. "Yeah, tonight was definitely the night to set her straight."You don't owe me. ""Hey, I can't remember it, but Bob told me what he saw.You put your arm in the way of molten rock.You held it there. "Her face twisted with imagined pain."You saved me, Robert. ""I saved you, kiddo.Yes.But I created the problem.I played ball with something evil. "Or something very strange."You were desperate.I knew that.I just didn't know how deep things would get.So we both made a mess. "It really was time to get down on his knees and beg forgiveness.But first let her know why this was beyond forgiveness.The words were hard to say: "Miri, you made a mess trying to fix things.But I I was the guy who set up your mother for what practically killed her. "There.It was said.Miri sat very still.After a moment, her gaze fell.She said softly, "I know. "Now they both were very still."Bob told you?""No.Alice did. "She looked up."And she told me they still can't figure out how what you did could have brought her down.It's okay, Robert. "Then abruptly, she was crying.And Robert did get on his knees.His granddaughter threw her arms around his neck.She was in full bawl now, her body shaking.She pounded his back with her fists."I'm so sorry, Miri.I  "  Miri's wail got even louder, but she stopped beating on him.After half a minute, her weeping trailed off into choking sobs, and then silence.But she still held on to him.Her words were halting and muffled."I just found out that Alice is Alice is back in Training . "Oh."She's not even recovered!"Miri was sobbing again."What does your father say?""Bob is out of touch tonight. ""Out of touch?"In this day and age?Miri pushed him back.She started to wipe her face on her sleeve, then grabbed from the box of tissues he set beside her."Really out of touch.Tactical blackout.D Don't you follow the news, Robert?""um. ""Read between the lines.Bob is off somewhere making places and things glow in the dark. "She wiped energetically at her face, and her voice returned to something like its usual tones."Okay, maybe not literally.Bob talks that way when he has to do things he really doesn't want to do.But I watch the rumor mills and I watch Bob and Alice.Between the three I'm a pretty good guesser.Sometimes Bob is out of touch, and I read about something wonderful or something terrible happening in another country.Sometimes Alice goes into Training, and I know that somebody needs help or else very bad things may happen.Right now Bob is away and Alice is back in Training. "She hid behind her hands for a moment, then resumed wiping her face."My g guess is that the top rumors are right.Something awful happened at the Library Riot, worse than the GenGen takeover.Now all the superpowers are running scared.They think someone has figured how to crack their security.A Alice almost admitted that tonight.That was her excuse !"Robert sat down again, but on the edge of his chair.His great confession had vanished into the abyss."You should talk to Bob when he gets back. ""I will.And he'll argue with her.You've heard that yourself.But in the end he can't stop her. ""This time, maybe he can go over her head, or get the doctors to back him up. "Miri hesitated, seemed to relax a fraction."Yes.This time is different I I'm glad we can talk, Robert. ""Any time, kiddo. "But then she was quiet.Finally, Robert said, "Are you conspiring, or just Googling?"Miri shook her head."N Neither.I tried to call someone but they're not answering. "Ah !"You know, Miri, Juan is in Puebla visiting his great grandfather.He may not be wearing all the time. ""Juan?I wouldn't call him.He's not very bright, and when the crunch came in Pilchner Hall, he was useless. ""You can't know that!""I know I was down in the tunnels by myself. ""Miri, I've talked to Juan almost every day since I started at Fairmont.He wouldn't let you down.Think back to the times you do remember.You two must have conspired a lot to keep track of me.I'll bet he played fair.He could be your good friend, another person you could talk to. "For once, Miri's chin came down."You know I can't talk to him about these things.I couldn't talk to you, except you already know. ""That's true.There are things you can't tell him.But I think he deserves better from you. "Miri's eyes flicked up to meet his, but she didn't speak."Remember how I told you, you remind me of your great aunt Cara?"Miri nodded."You were happy to learn that.But I think you know how I treated Cara.It was like the Ezra Pound Incident, over and over again, for years.I never had a chance to make up for that; she died when she was not much older than Alice is now. "Tears were back in Miri's eyes, but she held the tissues tight on her lap."I went through my whole life like that, Miri.I married a wonderful lady who loved me very much.Lena put up with more than I ever dumped on Cara, and for years longer.Even after I drove her away, you know how she helped me at Rainbows End.And now she is dead, too. "Robert looked down, and for a moment all he could think of was lost opportunities.Where was I?Oh : "So I think you owe Juan.Dumping on him isn't in the same league as my screwups.But you still have a chance to set things right. "He looked at Miri.Her shoulders were hunched.She was shredding the tissues she held in her hands."Just think about it, okay, Miri?I didn't mean to get carried away. "Finally, she spoke: "Have you ever broken a solemn promise, Robert?"Where did that come from ?But before he could get his mouth in gear, Miri continued:  "Well, I just did!"And with that, she grabbed the box of tissues and ran from the room."Miri!"By the time he got into the hall, Miri had disappeared into her room.Robert dithered for a moment.He could go down and pound on her door.Or maybe he should message her.He stepped back into his room, turned  and saw the golden light on the table, right beside where Miri had been sitting.It was an enum, granting some kind of limited message capability.But he already had that and more for Miri.He opened the golden enum and looked inside.This one was for Lena Llewelyn Gu.Robert sat beside the enum for almost half an hour.He studied it.He studied the documentation.It was exactly what he thought.Lena lives .There was no physical address, but he could write her a simple message.It took him only two hours to do so.Less than two hundred words.They were the most important words that Robert Gu had ever written.Robert couldn't sleep that night.Morning came, then afternoon.There was no reply.Epilogue   Six weeks passed.Robert was watching the news more now; he had learned that the world can bite you.He and Miri compared notes on what they saw.The raids at the edge of the world were allegedly over.Rumors held that little had been discovered.Rumors  and some real news  spoke of scandals in the EU, Indian, and Japanese intelligence services.All the Great Powers remained very nervous about insert your favorite crazyass theory here.On the home front, Bob was back!Robert and Miri took that to mean that some disaster theories were much less likely.Others remained scarily viable.Indeed, Bob blew his stack when he learned about Alice.Things got very tense around the house.Both Robert and Miri sensed heartbreaking battles hiding behind the looks and silences.Miri had years of putting together the clues.Her best guess was that Bob had appealed to the doctors, that he had complained far up the chain of command.None of it mattered.Alice remained in Training.Somewhere in all of this, Juan returned from Puebla.Miri didn't have much to say about him, but they were talking.The boy was smiling more.From Lena there was silence.She lived.His messages didn't bounce and her enum remained accessible.It was like talking into an infinite void.And Robert did keep talking, a message every day  and wondering what more he should do.Xiu Xiang had left Rainbows End."Lena asked me to leave," Xiu told him."Maybe I pushed her too hard. "But I know where she lives now!I could go there.I could make her see how much I've changed .And maybe that would just prove that he had changed in all the ways that didn't matter.So Robert didn't drive out to Rainbows End; he didn't snoop the public cams there.But he continued to write her.And when he was outside, he often imagined that besides the 7 by 24 at tention of the security authorities, perhaps there was another watcher, one who would someday forgive him.Meantime, he threw himself into schoolwork.There was so much to learn.And the rest of his time was spent with Comms R Us.They liked his work.Two months after the Great Library Riot, Robert returned to UCSD.He had lost track of Winston and Carlos.It was strange when he thought about it.For a few days the cabal had been such a tight conspiracy, but now they never spoke.The easiest explanation was mutual shame.They had been used, and their various agendas had come close to killing a lot of people.There was truth in all that, but for Robert there was another explanation, something weirder and almost as unsettling: the cabal was like a childhood clique, the animosities and closeness now vanished as his childlike attention morphed in new directions.Sometimes the desperation of the fall semester seemed almost as remote as his life in the twentieth century.There were so many things he wanted to learn and do and be, and they had so little do with what had previously consumed him.In the end, it was his project with Comms R Us that brought him back to campus.Jitter and latency were bad problems in video protocols, worse in voice, and absolute death for touchy feely interfaces.Haptic robots were getting better and better  but they were almost useless when run over the net.Now, Comms R Us wanted Robert to try his crazy synch schemes on haptics.In the aftermath of the Librareome and the riot, the UCSD administration had dumped further bushel baskets of cash on the library.In some ways its touchy feely experience was better than commercial parks like Pyramid Hill.The question was, how could you export that across the net?He had done plenty of reading, studied the design of touchy feely bots, but until the problem was solved there would be no substitute for firsthand experience.He took a car down to UCSD.Two months.Not really a long time.The server shacks on the north side of Warschawski Hall had merged.There was a soccer field where the Software Engineering Department had been.Robert could see that this wasn't destruction related to the Library Riot or the marine landings; it was the normal churn of any modern institution.He took the footpath through the eucalyptus.As always, coming out of the trees gave the naked eye a sudden vision across miles of tableland, into the mountains.And there, standing before it all, was still the Geisel Library.It was by far the oldest building at UCSD, one of the twenty percent that had been rebuilt after the Rose Canyon quake.But that damage had been nothing compared with what befell it during the riot, when the cabal's sponsors literally ripped the east side from its foundations.Any other building on campus would have been razed after such trauma, perhaps restored if it was of sufficient historical value.But neither had happened in the case of the Geisel Library.Robert walked around the north side of the library, down past the loading dock.He had seen views of the structure immediately after the riot, the floors sloping and sagging, the ad hoc buttresses that the fire department had added as the internal servos burned out, the chunks of twentieth century concrete that littered the terrace.Those signs of destruction were gone.The overhanging floors were level once more.The university had not undertaken a simple restoration.On the west it looked almost unchanged, but there was perceptible distortion above the loading dock, and on the east there was a graceful twisting of the building's great pillars.Where those pillars had moved, where the library had "walked," now the pillars were set.At the base was grass and smooth concrete, the tiled path that was the snake of knowledge.Looking upward, lush ivy followed the curving twist of the concrete.Where the ivy ended, there were lines of colored pebbles set in the pillars, making bands like stress fringes in illuminated crystal.And then above that, the rectangle of each floor was slightly turned from the one beneath it.From the building specifications, Robert could see that some of the pillars were carbon fibers embedded in lightweight composite.Yet the building was as real and solid as it looked to the naked eye; more than any building on campus, this was real.This building lived.He took the stairs, stopping at each floor to look around.He recognized the Hacek domain.There were still Librarians Militant here.But I thought their circle got booted out ?In other places, there was craziness he recognized as Scooch a mouti.The Scoochi mythos was eclectic nonsense that he had never figured out.How it fit with library metaphors was beyond him.But the Scoochis had "won" the riot and the library.In other places, both belief circles were running in parallel.You could choose which you wanted, or neither.Robert concentrated on management and naked eye views.After all, he was here to study the touchy feely support.There were haptic robots everywhere  not as many as at Pyramid Hill, but the university had crammed almost as much parallel variety into a few floors of a single building.UCSD had spent an enormous amount of money on the gadgets.There were some free running models, but most were surface mounted.These were fast.As quick as a Librarian Militant could reach for the vision of a book, a robot would slide into position, altering its surface just where it would meet the reacher's hand.Robert stood for a few moments, watching the action.The naked eye view was like nothing in his experience.When the student  that's what she was without her "Librarian Militant" cover  turned the book in her hands, the haptics flipped in coordination, never losing contact or slipping in a way different from the vision it was supporting.When she set it on a table, the haptics moved instantly to another task  this supporting some Scoochi client in even more unintelligible maneuvering.He noticed that the girl was staring at him."Sorry, sorry!I just haven't seen all this before. ""Tragic, not?"and she gave him a wide grin."Yes, uh, tragic. "Somewhere on a high protocol layer, all this involved books and the contents of books.At the physical layer it was even more fascinating.He wandered along, his mind far away, trying to imagine how the intricate dance of the haptics could be replicated on robots that were at some distance on the network.If both sides had human players it would be infernally hard.But if it was an asymmetric service, maybe   "Hey, Professor Gu!Look up here. "Robert looked in the direction of the voice.The ceiling above him had become transparent, as had the one above that.His view had tunneled through to the sixth floor.Carlos Rivera was looking back down at him, a happy smile on his face."Long time no see, Professor.Come on up, why don't you?""Sure. "Robert found his way back to the stairwell.The stairs were free of haptic diversions   as was the sixth floor.But there were no more books either.Someone had set up some offices.Rivera gave him a tour.He seemed to be just about the only one on the floor."Right now, the team is spread all over.Some of them are working on the new extensions underground. ""So what's your job now?Still library staff, I assume?"Carlos hesitated."Well, I have several titles now.It's a long story.Hey, come into my office. "His office was on the southeast corner, with windows overlooking the Snake Path and the esplanades.In fact, this was just where the cabal had held its meetings.Carlos waved him to a seat, and sat behind a wide desk.Carlos himself he was still overweight, still wore the bottle glass spectacles and the old fashioned T shirt.But there was a difference.This Carlos seemed relaxed, energetic happy with whatever he was doing."I was hoping we could talk, but things have just been so busy since  you know, since we almost fucked things up beyond all recognition. ""Yes, I know what you mean.We were very lucky, Carlos. "He glanced around the office.Nowadays, rank could be hard to see in visible things, but much of the furniture and plants were really what they seemed."You were going to tell me about your job. ""Yes!It's a little embarrassing.I'm the new Director of Library Support.That's the title the university recognizes.In some circles that's not the important title.Downstairs and across the world, you'll find that I'm other things  like Dangerous Knowledge and the Greatest Lesser Scooch a mout. ""But those are two different belief circles.I thought  "  "You read that the Scoochis won it all, right?Not quite.When the dust settled, there was a very bizarre  well, 'compromise' isn't quite the right word.'Alliance' or 'distanced merger' might be better. "He leaned back in his chair."It's scary how close we came to blowing up this end of San Diego.But we stopped just short.And that crazy riot made more money than a new cinema release.More important, it sucked money and creativity from all over, and the school administration was smart enough to take advantage. "He hesitated, a little sadness creeping into his voice."So we failed in everything we told each other we were trying to do.The books are gone.Physically gone.But the Geisel Library lives, and these two crazy belief circles are driving its content all over the world.But you've seen that, right?That's why you came down here?""I came down to study your haptics, actually. "Robert explained his interest in distanced interactive touch."Hey, that's great!Both groups have been beating on me to extend our reach.But at a higher level, what did you think of what they're doing to the library experience?""um, the Librarian Militants look the same as before, I guess.It's an amusing interface, if you like that sort of thing.The Scoochis I tried to see what they're doing, but it doesn't make sense.It's so scattered, almost as if each individual book is its own consensual reality. ""Almost.The Scoochis have always been eclectic.Now that they have a librareome, they're building game consensus down to fine grained topic levels, often down to individual paragraphs.It's much more subtle than the Hacek stuff, though children pick up on it very quickly.Their real power is that Scoochis can blend realities.That's what's happened with them and the Hacekeans.The Scoochis come from all over, even from the failed states.Now they're feeding the digitizations back outwards.Wherever it fits, the Hacek people are running things.Other places, other visions  but all with access to the entire body of the library.If you can crack the problem of remote interactive touch, it should make their attraction even greater. "Carlos looked around his office, where the cabal had plotted for such very different ends."An awful lot has changed in just two months. ""What do you think really happened that night, Carlos?Was the riot intended to distract from what we four were doing  or was it the other way around?""I've thought about that a lot.I think the riot was a diversion, but one that got way out of hand and ended up causing immense  what's the opposite of collateral damage?Collateral benefit?Sharif whoever  he was more often a rabbit to me  was a merry madman. "Rabbit.That was what his interrogators had called the Mysterious Stranger.It was also what the Stranger had called itself there at the end."Well, our part of the business was darker.Rabbit manipulated all of us, each according to our own weaknesses. "Carlos nodded."Yes. ""Rabbit promised each of us our secret wish, then defaulted after we had committed the necessary treachery. "Though to be honest, Robert was pretty sure the critter was kaput.Maybe things would have been different if it had survived.His burning hope in the Stranger's promise had powered Robert's treason.That was cold ashes now.Thank God.Carlos leaned forward.Behind the bottle glass specs, his eyes looked skeptical."Okay," said Robert, "maybe Rabbit didn't promise everyone something.I think the power assisted scheming was its own reward for Tommie. ""That's probably so. "But the librarian did not look convinced."Look, we'd know if any of the promises came true.It would be spectacular.I'll bet Winston wanted to  Where is Winnie these days?"He was looking up the answer, but Carlos already had it:  "Dean Blount was hired by the university last month, in the Division of Arts and Letters. "Robert's gaze skittered across his search result."But as an entry level administrative assistant!""Yes, it's bizarre.The current Dean of A and L is Jessica Laskowicz.She's another medical retread.Back in the oughts, she was a secretary in the division.Nowadays, the career track for admin assistants doesn't have any ceiling, but Winston is starting awfully far down  and the best gossip is that he and Laskowicz never got along. "Oh my ."I guess maybe Winston finally made peace with his dreams. "Like me .In any case, it meant the Mysterious Stranger was really gone, his extravagant promises dead.He looked up at Carlos Rivera.And felt the stirring of a vast surprise.Robert had very little of his old people sense; nowadays, the obvious had to beat him over the head with a club."What what about you?. ""Do you notice anything different about me, Professor?"Robert gave him a close look, then glanced again around the real plush office.Carlos had done well for himself, but Robert had never thought that worldly success would be his demand of the Stranger."You seem happier, more confident, more articulate. "Bingo ."You haven't said one word of Mandarin.Not a single JITT slip!"Carlos's reply was a smile of purest joy."So you've lost the language?"FIXME: Get this right."No.Qishiwo hdi keyishuo zhongwen, bugud buxidng yiqidn name liuli le .And I haven't had a seizure in more than six weeks!The JITT doesn't rule me.Now I can enjoy the language.It has been a great help in working with the Chinese Informagical people.We'll be merging their capture of the British Library with what came out of Huertas's default. "Robert was silent for a long moment.Then he said, "Your cure, it could be coincidence. ""I've wondered.This is a medical breakthrough that came out of groups in Turkey and Indonesia.It had nothing to do with the Veterans Administration or institutional research programs.But that's the way of most medical breakthroughs these days.And I've had no gloating messages from Rabbit.Everything is in the open, even if the news hasn't got much traction.You see, this treatment for JITT syndrome isn't effective for most victims.They contacted me through Yellow Ribbons because I'm smack in the middle of the likeliest genotypes. "He shrugged."I guess that could be a coincidence. ""Yes. "The heavenly minefield."But it's an awfully big coincidence," Rivera continued."I got what I asked for, just a few weeks after I did my part of the bargain.And some of my Scoochi progress has been strange.I've made agreements in weeks that should have taken a year.Somebody's helping me along.I think you're wrong about Rabbit.Maybe he's just lying low.Maybe he can't do all the miracles at once  Professor?Are you okay?"Robert had turned away, and pressed his forehead against the cool window glass.I don't need this.I am happy with the new me !He opened his eyes and looked out through tears.Down below was the familiar footpath, the snake of knowledge wriggling up the hillside toward the library.Perhaps the Mysterious Stranger really was a god, or had grown to be one.A trickster god."Professor?""I'm okay, Carlos.Maybe you're right. "They chatted a few minutes more.Robert wasn't quite sure what they said, though he remembered that Carlos seemed a little worried for him, perhaps mistaking Robert's raw confusion for some kind of medical emergency.Then he was down the elevator and back on the sunny plaza.And hovering immanent all around him were the worlds of art and science that humankind was busy building.What if I can have it all?
