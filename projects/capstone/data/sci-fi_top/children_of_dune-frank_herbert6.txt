"You have made decisions in my name, decisions which I find extremely distasteful.Either I will make the decisions in my own name from this point on or you can find yourself another heir for House Corrino!"Jessica passed her gaze swiftly across the participants in this confrontation, seeing the real anger in Farad'n.The Bashar Aide stood stiffly at attention, trying to make it appear that he had heard nothing.Wensicia hesitated on the brink of screaming rage.Farad'n appeared perfectly willing to accept any outcome from his throw of the dice.Jessica rather admired his poise, seeing many things in this confrontation which could be of value to her.It seemed that the decision to send assassin tigers against her grandchildren had been made without Farad'n's knowledge.There could be little doubt of his truthfulness in saying he'd learned of the plot after its inception.There was no mistaking the real anger in his eyes as he stood there, ready to accept any decision.Wensicia took a deep, trembling breath.Then: "Very well.The formal investiture will take place tomorrow.You may act in advance of it now. "She looked at Tyekanik, who refused to meet her gaze.There'll be a screaming fight once mother and son get out of here, Jessica thought.But I do believe he has won.She allowed her thoughts to return then to the message from the Landsraad.The Sisterhood had judged their messengers with a finesse which did credit to Bene Gesserit planning.Hidden in the formal notice of protest was a message for Jessica's eyes.The fact of the message said the Sisterhood's spies knew Jessica's situation and they'd gauged Farad'n with a superb nicety to guess he'd show it to his captive."I'd like an answer to my question," Jessica said, addressing herself to Farad'n as he returned to face her."I shall tell the Landsraad that I had nothing to do with this assassination," Farad'n said."I will add that I share the Sisterhood's distaste for the manner of it, although I cannot be completely displeased at the outcome.My apologies for any grief this may have caused you.Fortune passes everywhere. "Fortune passes everywhere!Jessica thought.That'd been a favorite saying of her Duke, and there'd been something in Farad'n's manner which said he knew this.She forced herself to ignore the possibility that they'd really killed Leto.She had to assume that Ghanima's fears for Leto had motivated a complete revelation of the twins' plan.The smugglers would put Gurney in position to meet Leto then and the Sisterhood's devices would be carried out.Leto had to be tested.He had to be.Without the testing he was doomed as Alia was doomed.And Ghanima...Well, that could be faced later.There was no way to send the pre born before a Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam.Jessica allowed herself a deep sigh."Sooner or later," she said, "it'll occur to someone that you and my granddaughter could unite our two Houses and heal old wounds. ""This has already been mentioned to me as a possibility," Farad'n said, glancing briefly as his mother."My response was that I'd prefer to await the outcome of recent events on Arrakis.There's no need for a hasty decision. ""There's always the possibility that you've already played into my daughter's hands," Jessica said.Farad'n stiffened."Explain!""Matters on Arrakis are not as they may seem to you," Jessica said."Alia plays her own game.Abomination's game.My granddaughter is in danger unless Alia can contrive a way to use her. ""You expect me to believe that you and your daughter oppose each other, that Atreides fights Atreides?"Jessica looked at Wensicia, back to Farad'n."Corrino fights Corrino. "A wry smile moved Farad'n's lips."Well taken.How would I have played into your daughter's hands?""By becoming implicated in my grandson's death, by abducting me. ""Abduct... ""Don't trust this witch," Wensicia cautioned."I'll choose whom to trust, mother," Farad'n said."Forgive me, Lady Jessica, but I don't understand this matter of abduction.I'd understood that you and your faithful retainer  "  "Who is Alia's husband," Jessica said.Farad'n turned a measuring stare on Idaho, looked to the Bashar."What think you, Tyek?"The Bashar apparently was having thoughts similar to those Jessica professed.He said: "I like her reasoning.Caution!""He's a ghola mentat," Farad'n said."We could test him to the death and not find a certain answer. ""But it's a safe working assumption that we may've been tricked," Tyekanik said.Jessica knew the moment had come to make her move.Now if Idaho's grief only kept him locked in the part he'd chosen.She disliked using him this way, but there were larger considerations."To begin with," Jessica said, "I might announce publicly that I came here of my own free choice. ""Interesting," Farad'n said."You'd have to trust me and grant me the complete freedom of Salusa Secundus," Jessica said."There could be no appearance that I spoke out of compulsion. ""No!"Wensicia protested.Farad'n ignored her."What reason would you give?""That I'm the Sisterhood's plenipotentiary sent here to take over your education. ""But the Sisterhood accuses  "  "That'd require a decisive action from you," Jessica said."Don't trust her!"Wensicia said.With extreme politeness, Farad'n glanced at her, said: "If you interrupt me once more, I'll have Tyek remove you.He heard you consent to the formal investiture.That binds him to me now. ""She's a witch, I tell you!"Wensicia looked to the mute against the side wall.Farad'n hesitated.Then: "Tyek, what think you?Have I been witched?""Not in my judgment.She  "  "You've both been witched!""Mother. "His tone was flat and final.Wensicia clenched her fists, tried to speak, whirled, and fled the room.Addressing himself once more to Jessica, Farad'n asked: "Would the Bene Gesserit consent to this?""They would. "Farad'n absorbed the implications of this, smiled tightly."What does the Sisterhood want in all of this?""Your marriage to my granddaughter. "Idaho shot a questioning look at Jessica, made as though to speak, but remained silent.Jessica said: "You were going to say something, Duncan?""I was going to say that the Bene Gesserit want what they've always wanted: a universe which won't interfere with them. ""An obvious assumption," Farad'n said, "but I hardly see why you intrude with it. "Idaho's eyebrows managed the shrug which the shigawire would not permit his body.Disconcertingly, he smiled.Farad'n saw the smile, whirled to confront Idaho."I amuse you?""This whole situation amuses me.Someone in your family has compromised the Spacing Guild by using them to carry instruments of assassination to Arrakis, instruments whose intent could not be concealed.You've offended the Bene Gesserit by killing a male they wanted for their breeding pro  "  "You call me a liar, ghola?""No.I believe you didn't know about the plot.But I thought the situation needed bringing into focus. ""Don't forget that he's a mentat," Jessica cautioned."My very thought," Farad'n said.Once more he faced Jessica."Let us say that I free you and you make your announcement.That still leaves the matter of your grandson's death.The mentat is correct. ""Was it your mother?"Jessica asked."My Lord!"Tyekanik warned."It's all right, Tyek. "Farad'n waved a hand easily."And if I say it was my mother?"Risking everything in the test of this internal break among the Corrino, Jessica said: "You must denounce her and banish her. ""My Lord," Tyekanik said, "there could be trickery within trickery here. "Idaho said: "And the Lady Jessica and I are the ones who've been tricked. "Farad'n's jaw hardened.And Jessica thought: Don't interfere, Duncan!Not now!But Idaho's words had sent her own Bene Gesserit abilities at logic into motion.He shocked her.She began to wonder if there were the possibility that she was being used in ways she didn't understand.Ghanima and Leto...The pre born could draw upon countless inner experiences, a storehouse of advice far more extensive than the living Bene Gesserit depended upon.And there was that other question: Had her own Sisterhood been completely candid with her?They still might not trust her.After all, she'd betrayed them once...to her Duke.Farad'n looked at Idaho with a puzzled frown."Mentat, I need to know what this Preacher is to you. ""He arranged the passage here.I. ..We did not exchange ten words.Others acted for him.He could be...He could be Paul Atreides, but I don't have enough data for certainty.All I know for certain is that it was time for me to leave and he had the means. ""You speak of being tricked," Farad'n reminded him."Alia expects you to kill us quietly and conceal the evidence of it," Idaho said."Having rid her of the Lady Jessica, I'm no longer useful.And the Lady Jessica, having served her Sisterhood's purposes, is no longer useful to them.Alia will be calling the Bene Gesserit to account, but they will win. "Jessica closed her eyes in concentration.He was right!She could hear the mentat firmness in his voice, that deep sincerity of pronouncement.The pattern fell into place without a chink.She took two deep breaths and triggered the mnemonic trance, rolled the data through her mind, came out of the trance and opened her eyes.It was done while Farad'n moved from in front of her to a position within half a step of Idaho   a space of no more than three steps."Say no more, Duncan," Jessica said, and she thought mournfully of how Leto had warned her against Bene Gesserit conditioning.Idaho, about to speak, closed his mouth."I command here," Farad'n said."Continue, mentat. "Idaho remained silent.Farad'n half turned to study Jessica.She stared at a point on the far wall, reviewing what Idaho and the trance had built.The Bene Gesserit hadn't abandoned the Atreides line, of course.But they wanted control of a Kwisatz Haderach and they'd invested too much in the long breeding program.They wanted the open clash between Atreides and Corrino, a situation where they could step in as arbiters.And Duncan was right.They'd emerge with control of both Ghanima and Farad'n.It was the only compromise possible.The wonder was that Alia hadn't seen it.Jessica swallowed past a tightness in her throat.Alia...Abomination!Ghanima was right to pity her.But who was left to pity Ghanima?"The Sisterhood has promised to put you on the throne with Ghanima as your mate," Jessica said.Farad'n took a backward step.Did the witch read minds?"They worked secretly and not through your mother," Jessica said."They told you I was not privy to their plan. "Jessica read revelation in Farad'n's face.How open he was.But it was true, the whole structure.Idaho had demonstrated masterful abilities as a mentat in seeing through to the fabric on the limited data available to him."So they played a double game and told you," Farad'n said."They told me nothing of this," Jessica said."Duncan was correct: they tricked me. "She nodded to herself.It had been a classic delaying action in the Sisterhood's traditional pattern   a reasonable story, easily accepted because it squared with what one might believe of their motives.But they wanted Jessica out of the way   a flawed sister who'd failed them once.Tyekanik moved to Farad'n's side."My Lord, these two are too dangerous to  "  "Wait a bit, Tyek," Farad'n said."There are wheels within wheels here. "He faced Jessica."We've had reasons to believe that Alia might offer herself as my bride. "Idaho gave an involuntary start, controlled himself.Blood began dripping from his left wrist where the shigawire had cut.Jessica allowed herself a small, eye widening response.She who'd known the original Leto as lover, father of her children, confidant and friend, saw his trait of cold reasoning filtered now through the twistings of an Abomination."Will you accept?"Idaho asked."It is being considered. ""Duncan, I told you to be silent," Jessica said.She addressed Farad'n."Her price was two inconsequential deaths   the two of us. ""We suspected treachery," Farad'n said."Wasn't it your son who said 'treachery breeds treachery?'"  "The Sisterhood is out to control both Atreides and Corrino," Jessica said."Isn't that obvious?""We're toying now with the idea of accepting your offer, Lady Jessica, but Duncan Idaho should be sent back to his loving wife. "Pain is a function of nerves, Idaho reminded himself.Pain comes as light comes to the eyes.Effort comes from the muscles, not from nerves.It was an old mentat drill and he completed it in the space of one breath, flexed his right wrist and severed an artery against the shigawire.Tyekanik leaped to the chair, hit its trip lock to release the bindings, shouted for medical aid.It was revealing that assistants came swarming at once through doors hidden in wall panels.There was always a bit of foolishness in Duncan, Jessica thought.Farad'n studied Jessica a moment while the medics ministered to Idaho."I didn't say I was going to accept his Alia. ""That's not why he cut his wrist," Jessica said."Oh?I thought he was simply removing himself. ""You're not that stupid," Jessica said."Stop pretending with me. "He smiled."I'm well aware that Alia would destroy me.Not even the Bene Gesserit could expect me to accept her. "Jessica bent a weighted stare upon Farad'n.What was this young scion of House Corrino?He didn't play the fool well.Again, she recalled Leto's words that she'd encounter an interesting student.And The Preacher wanted this as well, Idaho said.She wished she'd met this Preacher."Will you banish Wensicia?"Jessica asked."It seems a reasonable bargain," Farad'n said.Jessica glanced at Idaho.The medics had finished with him.Less dangerous restraints held him in the floater chair."Mentats should beware of absolutes," she said."I'm tired," Idaho said."You've no idea how tired I am. ""When it's overexploited, even loyalty wears out finally," Farad'n said.Again Jessica shot that measuring stare at him.Farad'n, seeing this, thought: In time she'll know me for certain and that could be valuable.A renegade Bene Gesserit of my own!It's the one thing her son had that I don't have.Let her get only a glimpse of me now.She can see the rest later."A fair exchange," Farad'n said."I accept your offer on your terms. "He signaled the mute against the wall with a complex flickering of fingers.The mute nodded.Farad'n bent to the chair's controls, released Jessica.Tyekanik asked: "My Lord, are you sure?""Isn't it what we discussed?"Farad'n asked."Yes, but... "Farad'n chuckled, addressed Jessica."Tyek suspects my sources.But one learns from books and reels only that certain things can be done.Actual learning requires that you do those things. "Jessica mused on this as she lifted herself from the chair.Her mind returned to Farad'n's hand signals.He had an Atreides style battle language!It spoke of careful analysis.Someone here was consciously copying the Atreides."Of course," Jessica said, "you'll want me to teach you as the Bene Gesserit are taught. "Farad'n beamed at her."The one offer I cannot resist," he said.= = = = = =   The password was given to me by a man who died in the dungeons of Arrakeen.You see, that is where I got this ring in the shape of a tortoise.It was in the suk outside the city where I was hidden by the rebels.The password?Oh, that has been changed many times since then.It was "Persistence. "And the countersign was "Tortoise. "It got me out of there alive.That's why I bought this ring: a reminder.Tagir Mohandis: Conversations with a Friend   Leto was far out on the sand when he heard the worm behind him, coming to his thumper there and the dusting of spice he'd spread around the dead tigers.There was a good omen for this beginning of their plan: worms were scarce enough in these parts most times.The worm was not essential, but it helped.There would be no need for Ghanima to explain a missing body.By this time he knew that Ghanima had worked herself into the belief that he was dead.Only a tiny, isolated capsule of awareness would remain to her, a walled off memory which could be recalled by words uttered in the ancient language shared only by the two of them in all of this universe.Secher Nbiw.If she heard those words: Golden Path...only then would she remember him.Until then, he was dead.Now Leto felt truly alone.He moved with the random walk which made only those sounds natural to the desert.Nothing in his passage would tell that worm back there that human flesh moved here.It was a way of walking so deeply conditioned in him that he didn't need to think about it.The feet moved of themselves, no measurable rhythm to their pacing.Any sound his feet made could be ascribed to the wind, to gravity.No human passed here.When the worm had done its work behind him, Leto crouched behind a dune's slipface and peered back toward The Attendant.Yes, he was far enough.He planted a thumper and summoned his transportation.The worm came swiftly, giving him barely enough time to position himself before it engulfed the thumper.As it passed, he went up its side on the Maker hooks, opened the sensitive leading edge of a ring, and turned the mindless beast southeastward.It was a small worm, but strong.He could sense the strength in its twisting as it hissed across the dunes.There was a following breeze and he felt the heat of their passage, the friction which the worm converted to the beginnings of spice within itself.As the worm moved, his mind moved.Stilgar had taken him up for his first worm journey.Leto had only to let his memory flow and he could hear Stilgar's voice: calm and precise, full of politeness from another age.Not for Stilgar the threatening staggers of a Fremen drunk on spice liquor.Not for Stilgar the loud voice and bluster of these times.No   Stilgar had his duties.He was an instructor of royalty: "In the olden times, the birds were named for their songs.Each wind had its name.A six klick wind was called a Pastaza, a twenty klick wind was Cueshma, and a hundred klick wind was Heinali   Heinali, the man pusher.Then there was the wind of the demon in the open desert: Hulasikali Wala, the wind that eats flesh. "And Leto, who'd already known these things, had nodded his gratitude at the wisdom of such instruction.But Stilgar's voice could be filled with many valuable things."There were in olden times certain tribes which were known to be water hunters.They were called Iduali, which meant 'water insects,' because those people wouldn't hesitate to steal the water of another Fremen.If they caught you alone in the desert they would not even leave you the water of your flesh.There was this place where they lived: Sietch Jacurutu.That's where the other tribes banded and wiped out the Iduali.That was a long time ago, before Kynes even   in my great great grandfather's days.And from that day to this, no Fremen has gone to Jacurutu.It is tabu. "Thus had Leto been reminded of knowledge which lay in his memory.It had been an important lesson about the working of memory.A memory was not enough, even for one whose past was as multiform as his, unless its use was known and its value revealed to judgment.Jacurutu would have water, a wind trap, all of the attributes of a Fremen sietch, plus the value without compare that no Fremen would venture there.Many of the young would not even know such a place as Jacurutu had ever existed.Oh, they would know about Fondak, of course, but that was a smuggler place.It was a perfect place for the dead to hide   among the smugglers and the dead of another age.Thank you, Stilgar.The worm tired before dawn.Leto slid off its side and watched it dig itself into the dunes, moving slowly in the familiar pattern of the creatures.It would go deep and sulk.I must wait out the day, he thought.He stood atop a dune and scanned all around: emptiness, emptiness, emptiness.Only the wavering track of the vanished worm broke the pattern.The slow cry of a nightbird challenged the first green line of light along the eastern horizon.Leto dug himself into the sand's concealment, inflated a stilltent around his body and sent the tip of a sandsnorkel questing for air.For a long time before sleep came, he lay in the enforced darkness thinking about the decision he and Ghanima had made.It had not been an easy decision, especially for Ghanima.He had not told her all of his vision, nor all of the reasoning derived from it.It was a vision, not a dream, in his thinking now.But the peculiarity of this thing was that he saw it as a vision of a vision.If any argument existed to convince him that his father still lived, it lay in that vision vision.The life of the prophet locks us into his vision, Leto thought.And a prophet could only break out of the vision by creating his death at variance with that vision.That was how it appeared in Leto's doubled vision, and he pondered this as it related to the choice he had made.Poor Baptist John, he thought.If he'd only had the courage to die some other way...But perhaps his choice had been the bravest one.How do I know what alternatives faced him?I know what alternatives faced my father, though.Leto sighed.To turn his back on his father was like betraying a god.But the Atreides Empire needed shaking up.It had fallen into the worst of Paul's vision.How casually it obliterated men.It was done without a second thought.The mainspring of a religious insanity had been wound tight and left ticking.And we're locked in my father's vision.A way out of that insanity lay along the Golden Path, Leto knew.His father had seen it.But humanity might come out of that Golden Path and look back down it at Muad'Dib's time, seeing that as a better age.Humankind had to experience the alternative to Muad'Dib, though, or never understand its own myths.Security...peace...prosperity...Given the choice, there was little doubt what most citizens of this Empire would select.Though they hate me, he thought.Though Ghani hate me.His right hand itched, and he thought of the terrible glove in his vision vision.It will be, he thought.Yes, it will be.Arrakis, give me strength, he prayed.His planet remained strong and alive beneath him and around him.Its sand pressed close against the stilltent.Dune was a giant counting its massed riches.It was a beguiling entity, both beautiful and grossly ugly.The only coin its merchants really knew was the bloodpulse of their own power, no matter how that power had been amassed.They possessed this planet the way a man might possess a captive mistress, or the way the Bene Gesserits possessed their Sisters.No wonder Stilgar hated the merchant priests.Thank you, Stilgar.Leto recalled then the beauties of the old sietch ways, the life lived before the coming of the Imperium's technocracy, and his mind flowed as he knew Stilgar's dreams flowed.Before the glow globes and lasers, before the ornithopters and spice crawlers, there'd been another kind of life: brown skinned mothers with babies on their hips, lamps which burned spice oil amidst a heavy fragrance of cinnamon, Naibs who persuaded their people while knowing none could be compelled.It had been a darkswarming of life in rocky burrows...A terrible glove will restore the balance, Leto thought.Presently, he slept.= = = = = =   I saw his blood and a piece of his robe which had been ripped by sharp claws.His sister reports vividly of the tigers, the sureness of their attack.We have questioned one of the plotters, and others are dead or in custody.Everything points to a Corrino plot.A Truthsayer has attested to this testimony.Stilgar's Report to the Landsraad Commission   Farad'n studied Duncan Idaho through the spy circuit, seeking a clue to that strange man's behavior.It was shortly after noon and Idaho waited outside the quarters assigned to the Lady Jessica, seeking audience with her.Would she see him?She'd know they were spied upon, of course.But would she see him?Around Farad'n lay the room where Tyekanik had guided the training of the Laza tigers   an illegal room, really, filled as it was with forbidden instruments from the hands of the Tleilaxu and Ixians.By the movement of switches at his right hand, Farad'n could look at Idaho from six different angles, or shift to the interior of the Lady Jessica's suite where the spying facilities were equally sophisticated.Idaho's eyes bothered Farad'n.Those pitted metal orbs which the Tleilaxu had given their ghola in the regrowth tanks marked their possessor as profoundly different from other humans.Farad'n touched his own eyelids, feeling the hard surfaces of the permanent contact lenses which concealed the total blue of his spice addiction.Idaho's eyes must record a different universe.How could it be otherwise?It almost tempted Farad'n to seek out the Tleilaxu surgeons and answer that question himself.Why did Idaho try to kill himself?Was that really what he'd tried?He must've known we wouldn't permit it.Idaho remained a dangerous question mark.Tyekanik wanted to keep him on Salusa or kill him.Perhaps that would be best.Farad'n shifted to a frontal view.Idaho sat on a hard bench outside the door to the Lady Jessica's suite.It was a windowless foyer with light wood walls decorated by lance pennants.Idaho had been on that bench more than an hour and appeared ready to wait there forever.Farad'n bent close to the screen.The loyal swordmaster of the Atreides, instructor of Paul Muad'Dib, had been treated kindly by his years on Arrakis.He'd arrived with a youthful spring in his step.A steady spice diet must have helped him, of course.And that marvelous metabolic balance which the Tleilaxu tanks always imparted.Did Idaho really remember his past before the tanks?No other whom the Tleilaxu had revived could claim this.What an enigma this Idaho was!The reports of his death were in the library.The Sardaukar who'd slain him reported his prowess: nineteen of their number dispatched by Idaho before he'd fallen.Nineteen Sardaukar!His flesh had been well worth sending to the regrowth tanks.But the Tleilaxu had made a mentat out of him.What a strange creature lived in that regrown flesh.How did it feel to be a human computer in addition to all of his other talents?Why did he try to kill himself?Farad'n knew his own talents and held few illusions about them.He was a historian archaeologist and judge of men.Necessity had forced him to become an expert on those who would serve him   necessity and a careful study of the Atreides.He saw it as the price always demanded of aristocracy.To rule required accurate and incisive judgments about those who wielded your power.More than one ruler had fallen through mistakes and excesses of his underlings.Careful study of the Atreides revealed a superb talent in choosing servants.They'd known how to maintain loyalty, how to keep a fine edge on the ardor of their warriors.Idaho was not acting in character.Why?Farad'n squinted his eyes, trying to see past the skin of this man.There was a sense of duration about Idaho, a feeling that he could not be worn down.He gave the impression of being self contained, an organized and firmly integrated whole.The Tleilaxu tanks had set something more than human into motion.Farad'n sensed this.There was a self renewing movement about the man, as though he acted in accordance with immutable laws, beginning anew at every ending.He moved in a fixed orbit with an endurance about him like that of a planet around a star.He would respond to pressure without breaking   merely shifting his orbit slightly but not really changing anything basic.Why did he cut his wrist?Whatever his motive, he had done it for the Atreides, for his ruling House.The Atreides were the star of his orbit.Somehow he believes that my holding the Lady Jessica here strengthens the Atreides.And Farad'n reminded himself: A mentat thinks this.It gave the thought an added depth.Mentats made mistakes, but not often.Having come to this conclusion, Farad'n almost summoned his aides to have them send the Lady Jessica away with Idaho.He poised himself on the point of acting, withdrew.Both of those people   the ghola mentat and the Bene Gesserit witch   remained counters of unknown denomination in this game of power.Idaho must be sent back because that would certainly stir up troubles on Arrakis.Jessica must be kept here, drained of her strange knowledge to benefit House Corrino.Farad'n knew it was a subtle and deadly game he played.But he had prepared himself for this possibility over the years, ever since he'd realized that he was more intelligent, more sensitive than those around him.It had been a frightening discovery for a child, and he knew the library had been his refuge as well as his teacher.Doubts ate at him now, though, and he wondered if he was quite up to this game.He'd alienated his mother, lost her counsel, but her decisions had always been dangerous to him.Tigers!Their training had been an atrocity and their use had been stupidity.How easy they were to trace!She should be thankful to suffer nothing more than banishment.The Lady Jessica's advice had fitted his needs with a lovely precision there.She must be made to divulge the way of that Atreides thinking.His doubts began to fade away.He thought of his Sardaukar once more growing tough and resilient through the rigorous training and the denial of luxury which he commanded.His Sardaukar legions remained small, but once more they were a man to man match for the Fremen.That served little purpose as long as the limits imposed by the Treaty of Arrakeen governed the relative size of the forces.Fremen could overwhelm him by their numbers   unless they were tied up and weakened by civil war.It was too soon for a battle of Sardaukar against Fremen.He needed time.He needed new allies from among the discontented Houses Major and the newly powerful from the Houses Minor.He needed access to CHOAM financing.He needed the time for his Sardaukar to grow stronger and the Fremen to grow weaker.Again Farad'n looked at the screen which revealed the patient ghola.Why did Idaho want to see the Lady Jessica at this time?He would know they were spied upon, that every word, every gesture would be recorded and analyzed.Why?Farad'n glanced away from the screen to the ledge beside his control console.In the pale electronic light he could make out the spools which contained the latest reports from Arrakis.His spies were thorough; he had to give them credit.There was much to give him hope and pleasure in those reports.He closed his eyes, and the high points of those reports passed through his mind in the oddly editorial form to which he'd reduced the spools for his own uses:  As the planet is made fertile, Fremen are freed of land pressures and their new communities lose the traditional sietch stronghold character.From infancy, in the old sietch culture, the Fremen was taught by the rota: "Like the knowledge of your own being, the sietch forms a firm base from which you move out into the world and into the universe.  "The traditional Fremen says: "Look to the Massif," meaning that the master science is the Law.But the new social structure is loosening those old legal restrictions; discipline grows lax.The new Fremen leaders know only their Low Catechism of ancestry plus the history which is camouflaged in the myth structure of their songs.People of the new communities are more volatile, more open; they quarrel more often and are less responsive to authority.The old sietch folk are more disciplined, more inclined to group actions and they tend to work harder; they are more careful of their resources.The old folk still believe that the orderly society is the fulfillment of the individual.The young grow away from this belief.Those remnants of the older culture which remain look at the young and say: "The death wind has etched away their past. "Farad'n liked the pointedness of his own summary.The new diversity on Arrakis could only bring violence.He had the essential concepts firmly etched into the spools:  The religion of Muad'Dib is based firmly in the old Fremen sietch cultural tradition while the new culture moves farther and farther from those disciplines.Not for the first time, Farad'n asked himself why Tyekanik had embraced that religion.Tyekanik behaved oddly in his new morality.He seemed utterly sincere, but carried along as though against his will.Tyekanik was like one who had stepped into the whirlwind to test it and had been caught up by forces beyond his control.Tyekanik's conversion annoyed Farad'n by its characterless completeness.It was a reversion to very old Sardaukar ways.He warned that the young Fremen might yet revert in a similar way, that the inborn, ingrained traditions would prevail.Once more Farad'n thought about those report spools.They told of a disquieting thing: the persistence of a cultural remnant from the most ancient Fremen times   "The Water of Conception. "The amniotic fluid of the newborn was saved at birth, distilled into the first water fed to that child.The traditional form required a godmother to serve the water, saying: "Here is the water of thy conception. "Even the young Fremen still followed this tradition with their own newborn.The water of thy conception.Farad'n found himself revolted by the idea of drinking water distilled from the amniotic fluid which had borne him.And he thought about the surviving twin, Ghanima, her mother dead when she'd taken that strange water.Had she reflected later upon that odd link with her past?Probably not.She'd been raised Fremen, What was natural and acceptable to Fremen had been natural and acceptable to her.Momentarily Farad'n regretted the death of Leto II.It would have been interesting to discuss this point with him.Perhaps an opportunity would come to discuss it with Ghanima.Why did Idaho cut his wrists?The question persisted every time he glanced at the spy screen.Again doubts assailed Farad'n.He longed for the ability to sink into the mysterious spice trance as Paul Muad'Dib had done, there to seek out the future and know the answers to his questions.No matter how much spice he ingested, though, his ordinary awareness persisted in its singular flow of now, reflecting a universe of uncertainties.The spy screen showed a servant opening the Lady Jessica's door.The woman beckoned Idaho, who arose from the bench and went through the door.The servant would file a complete report later, but Farad'n, his curiosity once more fully aroused, touched another switch on his console, watched as Idaho entered the sitting room of the Lady Jessica's quarters.How calm and contained the mentat appeared.And how fathomless were his ghola eyes.= = = = = =   Above all else, the mentat must be a generalist, not a specialist.It is wise to have decisions of great moment monitored by generalists.Experts and specialists lead you quickly into chaos.They are a source of useless nit picking, the ferocious quibble over a comma.The mentat generalist, on the other hand, should bring to decision making a healthy common sense.He must not cut himself off from the broad sweep of what is happening in his universe.He must remain capable of saying: "There's no real mystery about this at the moment.This is what we want now.It may prove wrong later, but we'll correct that when we come to it. "The mentat generalist must understand that anything which we can identify as our universe is merely part of larger phenomena.But the expert looks backward; he looks into the narrow standards of his own specialty.The generalist looks outward; he looks for living principles, knowing full well that such principles change, that they develop.It is to the characteristics of change itself that the mentat generalist must look.There can be no permanent catalogue of such change, no handbook or manual.You must look at it with as few preconceptions as possible, asking yourself: "Now what is this thing doing?"The Mentat Handbook   It was the day of the Kwisatz Haderach, the first Holy Day of those who followed Muad'Dib.It recognized the deified Paul Atreides as that person who was everywhere simultaneously, the male Bene Gesserit who mingled both male and female ancestry in an inseparable power to become the One with All.The faithful called this day Ayil, the Sacrifice, to commemorate the death which made his presence "real in all places. "The Preacher chose the early morning of this day to appear once more in the plaza of Alia's temple, defying the order for his arrest which everyone knew had been issued.The delicate truce prevailed between Alia's Priesthood and those desert tribes which had rebelled, but the presence of this truce could be felt as a tangible thing which moved everyone in Arrakeen with uneasiness.The Preacher did not dispel that mood.It was the twenty eighth day of official mourning for Muad'Dib's son, six days following the memorial rite at Old Pass which had been delayed by the rebellion.Even the fighting had not stopped the Hajj, though.The Preacher knew the plaza would be heavily thronged on this day.Most pilgrims tried to time their stay on Arrakis to cross Ayil, "to feel then the Holy Presence of the Kwisatz Haderach on His day. "The Preacher entered the plaza at first light, finding the place already thronging with the faithful.He kept a hand lightly on the shoulder of his young guide, sensing the cynical pride in the lad's walk.Now, when the Preacher approached, people noticed every nuance of his behavior.Such attention was not entirely distasteful to the young guide.The Preacher merely accepted it as a necessity.Taking his stance on the third of the Temple's steps.The Preacher waited for the hush to come.When silence had spread like a wave through the throng and the hurrying footsteps of others come to listen could be heard at the plaza's limits, he cleared his throat.It was still morning cold around him and lights had not yet come down into the plaza from the building tops.He felt the grey hush of the great square as he began to speak."I have come to give homage and to preach in the memory of Leto Atreides II," he said, calling out in that strong voice so reminiscent of a wormsman from the desert."I do it in compassion for all who suffer.I say to you what the dead Leto has learned, that tomorrow has not yet happened and may never happen.This moment here is the only observable time and place for us in our universe.I tell you to savor this moment and understand what it teaches.I tell you to learn that a government's growth and its death are apparent in the growth and death of its citizens. "A disturbed murmur passed through the plaza.Did he mock the death of Leto II?They wondered if Priest Guards would rush out now and arrest The Preacher.Alia knew there would be no such interruption of The Preacher.It was her order that he be left unmolested on this day.She had disguised herself in a good stillsuit with a moisture mask to conceal her nose and mouth, and a common hooded robe to hide her hair.She stood in the second row beneath The Preacher, watching him carefully.Was this Paul?The years might have changed him thus.And he had always been superb with Voice, a fact which made it difficult to identify him by his speech.Still, this Preacher made his voice do what he wanted.Paul could not have done it better.She felt that she had to know his identity before she could act against him.How his words dazzled her!She sensed no irony in The Preacher's statement.He was using the seductive attraction of definite sentences uttered with a driving sincerity.People might stumble only momentarily at his meanings, realizing that he had meant them to stumble, teaching them in this fashion.Indeed, he picked up the crowd's response, saying: "Irony often masks the inability to think beyond one's assumptions.I am not being ironic.Ghanima has said to you that the blood of her brother cannot be washed off.I concur."It will be said that Leto has gone where his father went, has done what his father did.Muad'Dib's Church says he chose in behalf of his own humanity a course which might appear absurd and foolhardy, but which history will validate.That history is being rewritten even now."I say to you that there is another lesson to be learned from these lives and their endings. "Alia, alert to every nuance, asked herself why The Preacher said endings instead of deaths.Was he saying that one or both were not truly dead?How could that be?A Truthsayer had confirmed Ghanima's story.What was this Preacher doing, then?Was he making a statement of myth or reality?"Note this other lesson well!"The Preacher thundered, lifting his arms."If you would possess your humanity, let go of the universe!"He lowered his arms, pointed his empty sockets directly at Alia.He seemed to be speaking intimately to her, an action so obvious that several around her turned to peer inquiringly in her direction.Alia shivered at the power in him.This could be Paul.It could!"But I realize that humans cannot bear very much reality," he said."Most lives are a flight from selfhood.Most prefer the truths of the stable.You stick your heads into the stanchions and munch contentedly until you die.Others use you for their purposes.Not once do you live outside the stable to lift your head and be your own creature.Muad'Dib came to tell you about that.Without understanding his message, you cannot revere him!"Some in the throng, possibly a Priest in disguise, could stand no more.His hoarse male voice was lifted in a shout: "You don't live the life of Muad'Dib!How dare you to tell others how they must revere him!""Because he's dead!"The Preacher bellowed.Alia turned to see who had challenged The Preacher.The man remained hidden from her, but his voice came over the intervening heads in another shout: "If you believe him truly dead, then you are alone from this time forward!"Surely it was a Priest, Alia thought.But she failed to recognize the voice."I come only to ask a simple question," The Preacher said."Is Muad'Dib's death to be followed by the moral suicide of all men?Is that the inevitable aftermath of a Messiah?""Then you admit him Messiah!"the voice from the crowd shouted."Why not, since I'm the prophet of his times?"The Preacher asked.There was such calm assurance in his tone and manner that even his challenger fell silent.The crowd responded with a disturbed murmur, a low animal sound."Yes," The Preacher repeated, "I am the prophet of these times. "Alia, concentrating on him, detected the subtle inflections of Voice.He'd certainly controlled the crowd.Was he Bene Gesserit trained?Was this another ploy of the Missionaria Protectiva?Not Paul at all, but just another part of the endless power game?"I articulate the myth and the dream!"The Preacher shouted."I am the physician who delivers the child and announces that the child is born.Yet I come to you at a time of death.Does that not disturb you?It should shake your souls!"Even as she felt anger at his words, Alia understood the pointed way of his speech.With others, she found herself edging closer up the steps, crowding toward this tall man in desert garb.His young guide caught her attention: how bright eyed and saucy the lad appeared!Would Muad'Dib employ such a cynical youth?"I mean to disturb you!"The Preacher shouted."It is my intention!I come here to combat the fraud and illusion of your conventional, institutionalized religion.As with all such religions, your institution moves toward cowardice, it moves toward mediocrity, inertia, and self satisfaction. "Angry murmurs began to arise in the center of the throng.Alia felt the tensions and gloatingly wondered if there might not be a riot.Could The Preacher handle these tensions?If not, he could die right here!"That Priest who challenged me!"The Preacher called, pointing into the crowd.He knows!Alia thought.A thrill ran through her, almost sexual in its undertones.This Preacher played a dangerous game, but he played it consummately."You, Priest in your mufti," The Preacher called, "you are a chaplain to the self satisfied.I come not to challenge Muad'Dib but to challenge you!Is your religion real when it costs you nothing and carries no risk?Is your religion real when you fatten upon it?Is your religion real when you commit atrocities in its name?Whence comes your downward degeneration from the original revelation?Answer me, Priest!"But the challenger remained silent.And Alia noted that the crowd once more was listening with avid submission to The Preacher's every word.By attacking the Priesthood, he had their sympathy!And if her spies were correct, most of the pilgrims and Fremen on Arrakis believed this man was Muad'Dib."The son of Muad'Dib risked!"The Preacher shouted, and Alia heard tears in his voice."Muad'Dib risked!They paid their price!And what did Muad'Dib achieve?A religion which is doing away with him!"How different those words if they come from Paul himself, Alia thought.I must find out!She moved closer up the steps and others moved with her.She pressed through the throng until she could almost reach out and touch this mysterious prophet.She smelled the desert on him, a mixture of spice and flint.Both The Preacher and his young guide were dusty, as though they'd recently come from the bled.She could see where The Preacher's hands were deeply veined along the skin protruding from the wrist seals of his stillsuit.She could see that one finger of his left hand had worn a ring; the indentation remained.Paul had worn a ring on that finger: the Atreides Hawk which now reposed in Sietch Tabr.Leto would have worn it had he lived...or had she permitted him to ascend the throne.Again The Preacher aimed his empty sockets at Alia, spoke intimately, but with a voice which carried across the throng."Muad'Dib showed you two things: a certain future and an uncertain future.With full awareness, he confronted the ultimate uncertainty of the larger universe.He stepped off blindly from his position on this world.He showed us that men must do this always, choosing the uncertain instead of the certain. "His voice, Alia noted, took on a pleading tone at the end of this statement.Alia glanced around, slipped a hand onto the hilt of her crysknife.If I killed him right now, what would they do?Again, she felt a thrill rush through her.If I killed him and revealed myself, denouncing The Preacher as impostor and heretic!But what if they proved it was Paul?Someone pushed Alia even closer to him.She felt herself enthralled by his presence even as she fought to still her anger.Was this Paul?Gods below!What could she do?"Why has another Leto been taken from us?"The Preacher demanded.There was real pain in his voice."Answer me if you can!Ahhhh, their message is clear: abandon certainty. "He repeated it in a rolling stentorian shout: "Abandon certainty!That's life's deepest command.That's what life's all about.We're a probe into the unknown, into the uncertain.Why can't you hear Muad'Dib?If certainty is knowing absolutely an absolute future, then that's only death disguised!Such a future becomes now!He showed you this!"With a terrifying directness The Preacher reached out, grabbed Alia's arm.It was done without any groping or hesitation.She tried to pull away, but he held her in a painful grip, speaking directly into her face as those around them edged back in confusion."What did Paul Atreides tell you, woman?"he demanded.How does he know I'm a woman?she asked herself.She wanted to sink into her inner lives, ask their protection, but the world within remained frighteningly silent, mesmerized by this figure from their past."He told you that completion equals death!"The Preacher shouted."Absolute prediction is completion...is death!"She tried to pry his fingers away.She wanted to grab her knife and slash him away from her, but dared not.She had never felt this daunted in all of her life.The Preacher lifted his chin to speak over her to the crowd, shouted: "I give you Muad'Dib's words!He said, 'I'm going to rub your faces in things you try to avoid.I don't find it strange that all you want to believe is only that which comforts you.How else do humans invent the traps which betray us into mediocrity?How else do we define cowardice?'That's what Muad'Dib told you!"Abruptly he released Alia's arm, thrust her into the crowd.She would have fallen but for the press of people supporting her."To exist is to stand out, away from the background," The Preacher said."You aren't thinking or really existing unless you're willing to risk even your own sanity in the judgment of your existence. "Stepping down.The Preacher once more took Alia's arm   no faltering or hesitation.He was gentler this time, though.Leaning close, he pitched his voice for her ears alone, said: "Stop trying to pull me once more into the background, sister. "Then, hand on his young guide's shoulder, he stepped into the throng.Way was made for the strange pair.Hands reached out to touch The Preacher, but people reached with an awesome tenderness, fearful of what they might find beneath that dusty Fremen robe.Alia stood alone in her shock as the throng moved out behind The Preacher.Certainty filled her.It was Paul.No doubt remained.It was her brother.She felt what the crowd felt.She had stood in the sacred presence and now her universe tumbled all about her.She wanted to run after him, pleading for him to save her from herself, but she could not move.While others pressed to follow The Preacher and his guide, she stood intoxicated with an absolute despair, a distress so deep that she could only tremble with it, unable to command her own muscles.What will I do?What will I do?she asked herself.Now she did not even have Duncan to lean upon, nor her mother.The inner lives remained silent.There was Ghanima, held securely under guard within the Keep, but Alia could not bring herself to take this distress to the surviving twin.Everyone has turned against me.What can I do?= = = = = =   The one eyed view of our universe says you must not look far afield for problems.Such problems may never arrive.Instead, tend to the wolf within your fences.The packs ranging outside may not even exist.The Azhar Book; Shamra I:4   Jessica awaited Idaho at the window of her sitting room.It was a comfortable room with soft divans and old fashioned chairs.There wasn't a suspensor in any of her rooms, and the glowglobes were crystal from another age.Her window overlooked a courtyard garden one story down.She heard the servant open the door, then the sound of Idaho's footsteps on the wood floor, then on the carpet.She listened without turning, kept her gaze upon the dappled light of the courtyard's green floor.The silent, fearful warfare of her emotions must be suppressed now.She took the deep breaths of her prana bindu training, felt the outflow of enforced calmness.The high sun threw its searchlight along a dustbeam into the courtyard, highlighting the silver wheel of a spiderweb stretched in the branches of a linden tree which reached almost to her window.It was cool within her quarters, but outside the sealed window there was air which trembled with petrified heat.Castle Corrino sat in a stagnant place which belied the greens in her courtyard.She heard Idaho stop directly behind her.Without turning, she said: "The gift of words is the gift of deception and illusion, Duncan.Why do you wish words with me?""It may be that only one of us will survive," he said."And you wish me to make a good report of your efforts?"She turned, saw how calmly he stood there, watching her with those grey metal eyes which held no center of focus.How blank they were!"Duncan, is it possible that you're jealous of your place in history?"She spoke accusingly and remembered as she spoke that other time when she'd confronted this man.He'd been drunk then, set to spy upon her, and was torn by conflicting obligations.But that had been a pre ghola Duncan.This was not the same man at all.This one was not divided in his actions, not torn.He proved her summation by smiling."History holds its own court and delivers its own judgments," he said."I doubt that I'll be concerned when my judgment's handed down. ""Why are you here?"she asked."For the same reason you're here, My Lady. "No outward sign betrayed the shocking power of those simple words, but she reflected at a furious pace: Does he really know why I'm here?How could he?Only Ghanima knew.Then had he enough data for a mentat computation?That was possible.And what if he said something to give her away?Would he do that if he shared her reason for being here?He must know their every movement, every word was being spied upon by Farad'n or his servants."House Atreides has come to a bitter crossroads," she said."Family turned against itself.You were among my Duke's most loyal men, Duncan.When the Baron Harkonnen  "  "Let us not speak of Harkonnens," he said, "That was another age and your Duke is dead. "And he wondered: Can't she guess that Paul revealed the Harkonnen blood in the Atreides?What a risk that had been for Paul, but it had bound Duncan Idaho even more firmly to him.The trust in the revelation had been a coin almost too great to imagine.Paul had known what the Baron's people had done to Idaho."House Atreides is not dead," Jessica said."What is House Atreides?"he asked."Are you House Atreides?Is it Alia?Ghanima?Is it the people who serve this House?I look at those people and they bear the stamp of a travail beyond words!How can they be Atreides?Your son said it rightly: 'Travail and persecution are the lot of all who follow me. 'I would break myself away from that, My Lady. ""Have you really gone over to Farad'n?""Isn't that what you've done, My Lady?Didn't you come here to convince Farad'n that a marriage to Ghanima would solve all of our problems?"Does he really think that?she wondered.Or is he talking for the watchful spies?"House Atreides has always been essentially an idea," she said."You know that, Duncan.We bought loyalty with loyalty. ""Service to the people," Idaho sneered."Ahhh, many's the time I've heard your Duke say it.He must lie uneasy in his grave, My Lady. ""Do you really think us fallen that low?""My lady, did you not know that there are Fremen rebels   they call themselves 'Marquis of the Inner Desert'   who curse House Atreides and even Muad'Dib?""I heard Farad'n's report," she said, wondering where he was leading this conversation and to what point."More than that, My Lady.More than Farad'n's report.I've heard their curse myself.Here's the way of it: 'Burning be on you, Atreides!You shall have no souls, nor spirits, nor bodies, nor shades nor magic nor bones, nor hair nor utterances nor words.You shall have no grave, nor house nor hole nor tomb.You shall have no garden, nor tree nor bush.You shall have no water, nor bread nor light nor fire.You shall have no children, nor family nor heirs nor tribe.You shall have no head, nor arms nor legs nor gait nor seed.You shall have no seats on any planet.Your souls shall not be permitted to come up from the depths, and they shall never be among those permitted to live upon the earth.On no day shall you behold Shai Hulud, but you shall be bound and fettered in the nethermost abomination and your souls shall never enter into the glorious light for ever and ever. 'That's the way of the curse, My Lady.Can you imagine such hatred from Fremen?They consign all Atreides to the left hand of the damned, to the Woman Sun which is full of burning. "Jessica allowed herself a shudder.Idaho undoubtedly had delivered those words with the same voice in which he'd heard the original curse.Why did he expose this to House Corrino?She could picture an outraged Fremen, terrible in his anger, standing before his tribe to vent that ancient curse.Why did Idaho want Farad'n to hear it?"You make a strong argument for the marriage of Ghanima and Farad'n," she said."You always did have a single minded approach to problems," he said."Ghanima's Fremen.She can marry only one who pays no fai, no tax for protection.House Corrino gave up its entire CHOAM holdings to your son and his heirs.Farad'n exists on Atreides sufferance.And remember when your Duke planted the Hawk flag on Arrakis, remember what he said: 'Here I am; here I remain!'His bones are still there.And Farad'n would have to live on Arrakis, his Sardaukar with him. "Idaho shook his head at the very thought of such an alliance."There's an old saying that one peels a problem like an onion," she said, her voice cold.How dare he patronize me?Unless he's performing for Farad'n's watchful eyes..."Somehow, I can't see Fremen and Sardaukar sharing a planet," Idaho said."That's a layer which doesn't come off the onion. "She didn't like the thoughts which Idaho's words might arouse in Farad'n and his advisors, spoke sharply: "House Atreides is still the law in this Empire!"And she thought: Does Idaho want Farad'n to believe he can regain the throne without the Atreides?"Oh, yes," Idaho said."I almost forgot.Atreides Law!As translated, of course, by the Priests of the Golden Elixir.I have but to close my eyes and I hear your Duke telling me that real estate is always gained and held by violence or the threat of it.Fortune passes everywhere, as Gurney used to sing it.The end justifies the means?Or do I have my proverbs mixed up?Well, it doesn't matter whether the mailed fist is brandished openly by Fremen legions or Sardaukar, or whether it's hidden in the Atreides Law   the fist is still there.And the onion layer won't come off, My Lady.You know, I wonder which fist Farad'n will demand?"What is he doing?Jessica wondered.House Corrino would soak up this argument and gloat over it!"So you think the Priests wouldn't let Ghanima marry Farad'n?"Jessica ventured, probing to see where Idaho's words might be leading."Let her?Gods below!The Priests will let Alia do whatever she decrees.She could marry Farad'n herself!"Is that where he's fishing?Jessica wondered."No, My Lady," Idaho said."That's not the issue.This Empire's people cannot distinguish between Atreides government and the government of Beast Rabban.Men die every day in Arrakeen's dungeons.I left because I could not give my sword arm another hour to the Atreides!Don't you understand what I'm saying, why I came here to you as the nearest Atreides representative?The Atreides Empire has betrayed your Duke and your son.I loved your daughter, but she went one way and I went another.If it comes down to it, I'll advise Farad'n to accept Ghanima's hand   or Alia's   only on his own terms!"Ahhh, he sets the stage for a formal withdrawal with honor from Atreides service, she thought.But these other matters of which he spoke, could he possibly know how well they did her work for her?She scowled at him."You know spies are listening to every word, don't you?""Spies?"He chuckled."They listen as I would listen in their place.Don't you know how my loyalties move in a different way?Many's the night I've spent alone in the desert, and the Fremen are right about that place, in the desert, especially at night, you encounter the dangers of hard thinking. ""Is that where you heard Fremen curse us?""Yes.Among the al Ourouba.At The Preacher's bidding I joined them, My Lady.We call ourselves the Zarr Sadus, those who refuse to submit to the Priests.I am here to make formal announcement to an Atreides that I've removed myself to enemy territory. "Jessica studied him, looking for betrayals of minutiae, but Idaho gave no indication that he spoke falsely or with hidden plans.Was it really possible that he'd gone over to Farad'n?She was reminded of her Sisterhood's maxim: In human affairs, nothing remains enduring; all human affairs revolve in a helix, moving around and out.If Idaho had really left the Atreides fold, that would explain his present behavior.He was moving around and out.She had to consider this as a possibility.But why had he emphasized that he did The Preacher's bidding?Jessica's mind raced and, having considered alternatives, she realized she might have to kill Idaho.The plan upon which she had staked her hopes remained so delicate that nothing could be allowed to interfere with it.Nothing.And Idaho's words hinted that he knew her plan.She gauged their relative positions in the room, moving and turning to place herself in position for a lethal blow."I've always considered the normalizing effect of the faufreluches to be a pillar of our strength," she said.Let him wonder why she shifted their conversation to the system of class distinction."The Landsraad Council of the Great Houses, the regional Sysselraads, all deserve our  "  "You do not distract me," he said.And Idaho wondered at how transparent her actions had become.Was it that she had grown lax in concealment, or had he finally breached the walls of her Bene Gesserit training?The latter, he decided, but some of it was in herself   a changing as she aged.It saddened him to see the small ways the new Fremen differed from the old.The passing of the desert was the passing of something precious to humans and he could not describe this thing, no more than he could describe what had happened to the Lady Jessica.Jessica stared at Idaho in open astonishment, not trying to conceal her reaction.Could he read her that easily?"You will not slay me," he said.He used the Fremen words of warning: "Don't throw your blood upon my knife. "And he thought: I've become very much the Fremen.It gave him a wry sense of continuity to realize how deeply he had accepted the ways of the planet which had harbored his second life."I think you'd better leave," she said."Not until you accept my withdrawal from Atreides service. ""Accepted!"She bit it off.And only after she'd uttered the word did she realize how much pure reflex had gone into this exchange.She needed time to think and reconsider.How had Idaho known what she would do?She did not believe him capable of leaping Time in the spice way.Idaho backed away from her until he felt the door behind him.He bowed."Once more I call you My Lady, and then never again.My advice to Farad'n will be to send you back to Wallach, quietly and quickly, at the earliest practical moment.You are too dangerous a toy to keep around.Although I don't believe he thinks of you as a toy.You are working for the Sisterhood, not for the Atreides.I wonder now if you ever worked for the Atreides.You witches move too deeply and darkly for mere mortals ever to trust. ""A ghola considers himself a mere mortal," she jibed."Compared to you," he said."Leave!"she ordered."Such is my intention. "He slipped out the door, passing the curious stare of the servant who'd obviously been listening.It's done, he thought.And they can read it in only one way.= = = = = =   Only in the realm of mathematics can you understand Muad'Dib's precise view of the future.Thus: first, we postulate any number of point dimensions in space.(This is the classic n fold extended aggregate of n dimensions. )With this framework, Time as commonly understood becomes an aggregate of one dimensional properties.Applying this to the Muad'Dib phenomenon, we find that we either are confronted by new properties of Time or (by reduction through the infinity calculus) we are dealing with separate systems which contain n body properties.For Muad'Dib, we assume the latter.As demonstrated by the reduction, the point dimensions of the n fold can only have separate existence within different frameworks of Time.Separate dimensions of Time are thus demonstrated to coexist.This being the inescapable case, Muad'Dib's predictions required that he perceive the n fold not as extended aggregate but as an operation within a single framework.In effect, he froze his universe into that one framework which was his view of Time.Palimbasha: Lectures at Sietch Tabr   Leto lay at the crest of a dune, peering across open sand at a sinuous rock outcropping.The rock lay like an immense worm atop the sand, flat and threatening in the morning sunlight.Nothing stirred there.No bird circled overhead; no animal scampered among the rocks.He would see the slots of a windtrap almost at the center of the "worm's" back.There'd be water here.The rock worm held the familiar appearance of a sietch shelter, except for the absence of living things.He lay quietly, blending with sand, watching.One of Gurney Halleck's tunes kept flowing through his mind, monotonously persistent:  		Beneath the hill where the fox runs lightly, 		A dappled sun shines brightly 		Where my one love's still.Beneath the hill in the fennel brake 		I spy my love who cannot wake.He hides in a grave 		Beneath the hill.Where was the entrance to that place?Leto wondered.He felt the certainty that this must be Jacurutu/Fondak, but there was something wrong here beyond the lack of animal movement.Something flickered at the edges of conscious perception, warning him.What hid beneath the hill?Lack of animals was bothersome.It aroused his Fremen sense of caution: The absence says more than the presence when it comes to desert survival.But there was a windtrap.There would be water and humans to use it.This was the tabu place which hid behind Fondak's name, its other identity lost even to the memories of most Fremen.And no birds or animals could be seen there.No humans   yet here the Golden Path began.His father had once said: "There's unknown all around at every moment.That's where you seek knowledge. "Leto glanced out to his right along the dune crests.There'd been a mother storm recently.Lake Azrak, the gypsum plain, had been exposed from beneath its sandy cover.Fremen superstition said that whoever saw the Biyan, the White Lands, was granted a two edged wish, a wish which might destroy you.Leto saw only a gypsum plain which told him that open water had existed once here on Arrakis.As it would exist once more.He peered upward, swinging his gaze all around in the search for movement.The sky was porous after the storm.Light passing through it generated a sensation of milky presence, of a silver sun lost somewhere above the dust veil which persisted in the high altitudes.Once more Leto brought his attention back to the sinuous rock.He slipped the binoculars from his Fremkit, focused their motile lenses and peered at the naked greyness, this out cropping where once the men of Jacurutu had lived.Amplification revealed a thorn bush, the one called Queen of Night.The bush nestled in shadows at a cleft which might be an entrance into the old sietch.He scanned the length of the outcropping.The silver sun turned reds into grey, casting a diffuse flatness over the long expanse of rock.He rolled over, turning his back on Jacurutu, scanned the circle of his surroundings through the binoculars.Nothing in that wilderness preserved the marks of human passage.The wind already had obliterated his tracks, leaving only a vague roundness where he had dropped from his worm in the night.Again he looked at Jacurutu.Except for the windtrap, there was no sign that men had ever passed this way.And without that sinuous length of rock, there was nothing here to subtract from the bleached sand, a wilderness from horizon to horizon.Leto felt suddenly that he was in this place because he had refused to be confined in the system which his ancestors bequeathed him.He thought of how people looked at him, that universal mistake in every glance except Ghanima's.Except for that ragged mob of other memories, this child was never a child.I must accept responsibility for the decision we made, he thought.Once more he scanned the length of rock.By all the descriptions this had to be Fondak, and no other place could be Jacurutu.He felt a strange resonant relationship with the tabu of this place.In the Bene Gesserit Way, he opened his mind to Jacurutu, seeking to know nothing about it.Knowing was a barrier which prevented learning.For a few moments he allowed himself merely to resonate, making no demands, asking no questions.The problem lay within the lack of animal life, but it was a particular thing which alerted him.He perceived it then: there were no scavenger birds   no eagles, no vultures, no hawks.Even when other life hid, these remained.Every watering place in this desert held its chain of life.At the end of the chain were the omnipresent scavengers.Nothing had come to investigate his presence.How well he knew the "watchdogs of the sietch," that line of crouched birds on the cliff's edge at Tabr, primitive undertakers waiting for flesh.As the Fremen said: "Our competitors. "But they said it with no sense of jealousy because questing birds often told when strangers approached.What if this Fondak has been abandoned even by the smugglers?Leto paused to drink from one of his catchtubes.What if there's truly no water here?He reviewed his position.He'd run two worms into the sand getting here, riding them with his flail through the night, leaving them half dead.This was the Inner Desert where the smugglers' haven was to be found.If life existed here, if it could exist, it would have to be in the presence of water.What if there's no water?What if this isn't Fondak/Jacurutu?Once more he aimed his binoculars at the windtrap.Its outer edges were sand etched, in need of maintenance, but enough of it remained.There should be water.But what if there isn't?An abandoned sietch might lose its water to the air, to any number of catastrophes.Why were there no scavenger birds?Killed for their water?By whom?How could all of them be eliminated?Poison?Poisoned water.The legend of Jacurutu contained no story of the cistern poisoned, but it might have been.If the original flocks were slain, would they not have been renewed by this time?The Iduali were wiped out generations ago and the stories never mentioned poison.Again he examined the rock with his binoculars.How could an entire sietch have been wiped out?Certainly some must have escaped.All of the inhabitants of a sietch were seldom at home.Parties roamed the desert, trekked to the towns.With a sigh of resignation Leto put away his binoculars.He slipped down the hidden face of the dune, took extra care to dig in his stilltent and conceal all sign of his intrusion as he prepared to spend the hot hours.The sluggish currents of fatigue stole along his limbs as he sealed himself in the darkness.Within the tent's sweaty, confines he spent much of the day drowsing, imagining mistakes he could have made.His dreams were defensive, but there could be no self defense in this trial he and Ghanima had chosen.Failure would scald their souls.He ate spice biscuits and slept, awakened to eat once more, to drink and return to sleep.It had been a long journey to this place, a severe test for the muscles of a child.Toward evening he awoke refreshed, listened for signs of life.He crept out of his sandy shroud.There was dust high up in the sky blowing one way, but he could feel sand stinging his cheek from another direction   sure sign there would be a weather change.He sensed a storm coming.Cautiously he crept to the crest of his dune, peered once more at those enigmatic rocks.The intervening air was yellow.The signs spoke of a Coriolis storm approaching, the wind that carried death in its belly.There'd be a great winding sheet of wind driven sand that might stretch across four degrees of latitude.The desolate emptiness of the gypsum pan was a yellow surface now, reflecting the dust clouds.The false peace of evening enfolded him.Then the day collapsed and it was night, the quick night of the Inner Desert.The rocks were transformed into angular peaks frosted by the light of First Moon.He felt sandthorns stinging his skin.A peal of dry thunder sounded like an echo from distant drums and, in the space between moonlight and darkness he saw sudden movement: bats.He could hear the stirring of their wings, their tiny squeaks.Bats.By design or accident, this place conveyed a sense of abandoned desolation.It was where the half legendary smuggler stronghold should be: Fondak.But what if it were not Fondak?What if the tabu still ruled and this were only the shell of ghostly Jacurutu?Leto crouched in the lee of his dune and waited for the night to settle into its own rhythms.Patience and caution   caution and patience.For a time he amused himself by reviewing Chaucer's route from London to Canterbury, listing the places from Southwark: two miles to the watering place of St.Thomas, five miles to Deptford, six miles to Greenwich, thirty miles to Rochester, forty miles to Sittingboume, fifty five miles to Boughton under Blean, fifty eight miles to Harbledown, and sixty miles to Canterbury.It gave him a sense of timeless buoyancy to know that few in his universe would recall Chaucer or know any London except the village on Gansireed.St.Thomas was preserved in the Orange Catholic Bible and the Azhar Book, but Canterbury was gone from the memories of men, as was the planet which had known it.There lay the burden of his memories, of all those lives which threatened to engulf him.He had made that trip to Canterbury once.His present trip was longer, though, and more dangerous.Presently he crept over the dune's crest and made his way toward the moonlit rocks.He blended with shadows, slid across the crests, made no sounds that might signal his presence.The dust had gone as it often did just before a storm, and the night was brilliant.The day had revealed no movement, but he heard small creatures hustling in the darkness as he neared the rocks.In a valley between two dunes he came upon a family of jerboa which scampered away at his approach.He eased over the next crest, his emotions beset by salty anxieties.That cleft he had seen   did it lead up to an entrance?And there were other concerns: the old time sietch had always been guarded by traps   poisoned barbs in pits, poisoned spines on plants.He felt himself caught up in the Fremen agrapha: The ear minded night.And he listened for the slightest sound.The grey rocks lowered above him now, made giant by his nearness.As he listened, he heard birds invisible in that cliff, the soft calling of winged prey.They were the sounds of daybirds, but abroad by night.What had turned their world around?Human predation?Abruptly Leto froze against the sand.There was fire on the cliff, a ballet of glittering and mysterious gems against the night's black gauze, the sort of signal a sietch might send to wanderers across the bled.Who were these occupants of this place?He crept forward into the deepest shadows at the cliff's base, felt along the rock with a hand, sliding his body behind the hand as he sought the fissure he'd seen by daylight.He located it on his eighth step, slipped the sandsnorkel from his kit and probed the darkness.As he moved, something tight and binding dropped over his shoulders and arms, immobilizing him.Trapvine!He resisted the urge to struggle; that only made the vine pull tighter.He dropped the snorkel, flexed the fingers of his right hand, trying for the knife at his waist.He felt like a bare innocent for not throwing something into that fissure from a distance, testing the darkness for its dangers.His mind had been too occupied by the fire on the cliff.Each movement tightened the trapvine, but his fingers at last touched the knife hilt.Stealthily, he closed his hand around the hilt, began to slip it free.Flaring light enveloped him, arresting all movement."Ahhh, a fine catch in our net. "It was a heavy masculine voice from behind Leto, something vaguely familiar in the tone.Leto tried to turn his head, aware of the vine's dangerous propensity to crush a body which moved too freely.A hand took his knife, before he could see his captor.The hand moved expertly over his body, extracting the small devices he and Ghanima carried as a matter of survival.Nothing escaped the searcher, not even the shigawire garrote concealed in his hair.Leto still had not seen the man.Fingers did something with the trapvine and he found he could breathe easier, but the man said: "Do not struggle, Leto Atreides.I have your water in my cup. "By supreme effort Leto remained calm, said: "You know my name?""Of course!When one baits a trap, it's for a purpose.One aims for a specific quarry, not so?"Leto remained silent, but his thoughts whirled."You feel betrayed!"the heavy voice said.Hands turned him around, gently but with an obvious show of strength.An adult male was telling the child what the odds were.Leto stared up into the glare from twin floater flares, saw the black outline of a stillsuit masked face, the hood.As his eyes adjusted he made out a dark strip of skin, the utterly shadowed eyes of melange addiction."You wonder why we went to all this trouble," the man said.His voice issued from the shielded lower part of his face with a curious muffled quality, as though he tried to conceal an accent."I long ago ceased to wonder at the numbers of people who want the Atreides twins dead," Leto said."Their reasons are obvious. "As he spoke, Leto's mind flung itself against the unknown as against a cage, questing wildly for answers.A baited trap?But who had known except Ghanima?Impossible!Ghanima wouldn't betray her own brother.Then did someone know him well enough to predict his actions?Who?His grandmother?How could she?"You could not be permitted to go on as you were," the man said."Very bad.Before ascending the throne, you need to be educated. "The whiteless eyes stared down at him."You wonder how one could presume to educate such a person as yourself?You, with the knowledge of a multitude held there in your memories?That's just it, you see!You think yourself educated, but all you are is a repository of dead lives.You don't yet have a life of your own.You're just a walking surfeit of others, all with one goal   to seek death.Not good in a ruler, being a death seeker.You'd strew your surroundings with corpses.Your father, for example, never understood the  "  "You dare speak of him that way?""Many's the time I've dared it.He was only Paul Atreides, after all.Well, boy, welcome to your school. "The man brought a hand from beneath his robe, touched Leto's cheek.Leto felt the jolt of a slapshot and found himself winding downward into a darkness where a green flag waved.It was the green banner of the Atreides with its day and night symbols, its Dune staff which concealed a water tube.He heard the water gurgling as unconsciousness enfolded him.Or was it someone chuckling?= = = = = =   We can still remember the golden days before Heisenberg, who showed humans the walls enclosing our predestined arguments.The lives within me find this amusing.Knowledge, you see, has no uses without purpose, but purpose is what builds enclosing walls.Leto Atreides II, His Voice   Alia found herself speaking harshly to the guards she confronted in the Temple foyer.There were nine of them in the dusty green uniforms of the suburban patrol, and they were still panting and sweating with their exertions.The light of late afternoon came in the door behind them.The area had been cleared of pilgrims."So my orders mean nothing to you?"she demanded.And she wondered at her own anger, not trying to contain it but letting it run.Her body trembled with unleashed tensions.Idaho gone...the Lady Jessica...no reports...only rumors that they were on Salusa.Why hadn't Idaho sent a message?What had he done?Had he learned finally about Javid?Alia wore the yellow of Arrakeen mourning, the color of the burning sun from Fremen history.In a few minutes she would be leading the second and final funeral procession to Old Gap, there to complete the stone marker for her lost nephew.The work would be completed in the night, fitting homage to one who'd been destined to lead Fremen.The priestly guards appeared defiant in the face of her anger, not shamed at all.They stood in front of her, outlined by the waning light.The odor of their perspiration was easily detected through the light and inefficient stillsuits of city dwellers.Their leader, a tall blond Kaza with the bourka symbols of the Cadelam family, flung his stillsuit mask aside to speak more clearly.His voice was full of the prideful intonations to be expected from a scion of the family which once had ruled at Sietch Abbir."Certainly we tried to capture him!"The man was obviously outraged at her attack."He speaks blasphemy!We know your orders, but we heard him with our own ears!""And you failed to catch him," Alia said, her voice low and accusing.One of the other guards, a short young woman, tried to defend them."The crowds were thick there!I swear people interfered with us!""We'll keep after him," the Cadelam said."We'll not always fail. "Alia scowled."Why won't you understand and obey me?""My Lady, we  "  "What will you do, scion of the Cade Lamb, if you capture him and find him to be, in truth, my brother?"He obviously did not hear her special emphasis on his name, although he could not be a priestly guard without some education and the wit to go with it.Did he want to sacrifice himself?The guardsman swallowed, then: "We must kill him ourselves, for he breeds disorder. "The others stood aghast at this, but still defiant.They knew what they had heard."He calls upon the tribes to band against you," the Cadelam said.Alia knew how to handle him now.She spoke in a quiet, matter of fact tone: "I see.Then if you must sacrifice yourself this way, taking him openly for all to see who you are and what you do, then I guess you must. ""Sacrifice my... "He broke off, glanced at his companions.As Kaza of this group, their appointed leader, he had the right to speak for them, but he showed signs that he wished he'd remained silent.The other guards stirred uncomfortably.In the heat of the chase they'd defied Alia.One could only reflect now upon such defiance of the "Womb of Heaven. "With obvious discomfort the guards opened a small space between themselves and their Kaza."For the good of the Church, our official reaction would have to be severe," Alia said."You understand that, don't you?""But he  "  "I've heard him myself," she said."But this is a special case. ""He cannot be Muad'Dib, My Lady!"How little you know!she thought.She said: "We cannot risk taking him in the open, harming him where others could see it.If another opportunity presents itself, of course. ""He's always surrounded by crowds these days!""Then I fear you must be patient.Of course, if you insist on defying me... "She left the consequences hanging in the air, unspoken, but well understood.The Cadelam was ambitious, a shining career before him."We didn't mean defiance, My Lady. "The man had himself under control now."We acted hastily; I can see that.Forgive us, but he  "  "Nothing has happened; nothing to forgive," she said, using the common Fremen formula.It was one of the many ways a tribe kept peace in its ranks, and this Cadelam was still Old Fremen enough to remember that.His family carried a long tradition of leadership.Guilt was the Naib's whip, to be used sparingly.Fremen served best when free of guilt or resentment.He showed his realization of her judgment by bowing his head, saying: "For the good of the tribe; I understand. ""Go refresh yourselves," she said."The procession begins in a few minutes. ""Yes, My Lady. "They bustled away, every movement revealing their relief at this escape.Within Alia's head a bass rumbled: "Ahhhhh, you handled that most adroitly.One or two of them still believe you desire The Preacher dead.They'll find a way. ""Shut up!"she hissed."Shut up!I should never have listened to you!Look what you've done... ""Set you on the road to immortality," the bass voice said.She felt it echoing in her skull like a distant ache, thought: Where can I hide?There's no place to go!"Ghanima's knife is sharp," the Baron said."Remember that. "Alia blinked.Yes, that was something to remember.Ghanima's knife was sharp.That knife might yet cut them out of their present predicament.= = = = = =   If you believe certain words, you believe their hidden arguments.When you believe something is right or wrong, true or false, you believe the assumptions in the words which express the arguments.Such assumptions are often full of holes, but remain most precious to the convinced.The Open Ended Proof from, The Panoplia Prophetica   Leto's mind floated in a stew of fierce odors.He recognized the heavy cinnamon of melange, the confined sweat of working bodies, the acridity of an uncapped deathstill, dust of many sorts with flint dominant.The odors formed a trail through dreamsand, created shapes of fog in a dead land.He knew these odors should tell him something, but part of him could not yet listen.Thoughts like wraiths floated through his mind: In this time I have no finished features; I am all of my ancestors.The sun setting into the sand is the sun setting into my soul.Once this multitude within me was great, but that's ended.I'm Fremen and I'll have a Fremen ending.The Golden Path is ended before it began.It's nothing but a windblown trail.We Fremen knew all the tricks to conceal ourselves: we left no feces, no water, no tracks...Now, look at my trail vanish.A masculine voice spoke close to his ear: "I could kill you, Atreides.I could kill you, Atreides. "It was repeated over and over until it lost meaning, became a wordless thing carried within Leto's dreaming, a litany of sorts: "I could kill you, Atreides. "Leto cleared his throat and felt the reality of this simple act shake his senses.His dry throat managed: "Who... "The voice beside him said: "I'm an educated Fremen and I've killed my man.You took away our gods, Atreides.What do we care about your stinking Muad'Dib?Your god's dead!"Was that a real Ouraba voice or another part of his dream?Leto opened his eyes, found himself unfettered on a hard couch.He looked upward at rock, dim glowglobes, an unmasked face staring down at him so close he could smell the breath with its familiar odors of a sietch diet.The face was Fremen; no mistaking the dark skin, those sharp features and water wasted flesh.This was no fat city dweller.Here was a desert Fremen."I am Namri, father of Javid," the Fremen said."Do you know me now, Atreides?""I know Javid," Leto husked."Yes, your family knows my son well.I am proud of him.You Atreides may know him even better soon. ""What... ""I am one of your schoolmasters, Atreides.I have only one function: I am the one who could kill you.I'd do it gladly.In this school, to graduate is to live; to fail is to be given into my hands. "Leto heard implacable sincerity in that voice.It chilled him.This was a human gom jabbar, a high handed enemy to test his right of entrance into the human concourse.Leto sensed his grandmother's hand in this and, behind her, the faceless masses of the Bene Gesserit.He writhed at this thought."Your education begins with me," Namri said."That is just.It is fitting.Because it could end with me.Listen to me carefully now.My every word carries your life in it.Everything about me holds your death within it. "Leto shot his glance around the room: rock walls, barren   only this couch, the dim glowglobes, and a dark passage behind Namri."You will not get past me," Namri said.And Leto believed him."Why're you doing this?"Leto asked."That's already been explained.Think what plans are in your head!You are here and you cannot put a future into your present condition.The two don't go together: now and future.But if you really know your past, if you look backward and see where you've been, perhaps there'll be reason once more.If not, there will be your death. "Leto noted that Namri's tone was not unkind, but it was firm and no denying the death in it.Namri rocked back on his heels, stared at the rock ceiling."In olden times Fremen faced east at dawn.Eos, you know?That's dawn in one of the old tongues. "Bitter pride in his voice, Leto said: "I speak that tongue. ""You have not listened to me, then," Namri said, and there was a knife edge in his voice."Night was the time of chaos.Day was the time of order.That's how it was in the time of that tongue you say you speak: darkness disorder, light order.We Fremen changed that.Eos was the light we distrusted.
