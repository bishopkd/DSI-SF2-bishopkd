The Greater Scooch a mout!"Behind Huynh, one of the forklift mechs stirred to life.Ah!That was just the thing Huynh should have thought to do.Thank goodness Sheila was on the ball.The forklift stepped forward as delicately as could be imagined for a machine that was twelve feet tall, with a center of gravity that now was over six feet up.It certainly wasn't running autonomously, but he hadn't thought Sheila could drive it this well.Its foot platters descended slowly, giving humans and chirps and sal sipueds plenty of time to clear out of the way.It was impressive, but it was just a forklift.Then Huynh realized he was still watching it with his driver's view.Meshing with the belief circle view it was   Sheila had morphed the blue ioniped into something even more spectacular than Dangerous Knowledge.Now it was the Greater Scooch a mout, the most popular of the Scoochi critters.In its short career, the Greater Scooch had been the subject of refurbishments, spinoffs, spinups, mergers, and attempted government takeovers.It was the maximum hero to millions of schoolchildren across the poorest lands of Africa and South America, the champion of little people improving their place in the world.And this vision of it, tonight, topped everything in sight.What's more, this vision, tonight, had four tons of haptic truth clunking along inside.The Greater Scooch a mout reached the edge of the Scoochi lines, and advanced into spider bot territory.Now it moved fast , as fast as its stabilizers and motors would carry it.Whoa, who is driving that thing ?It danced through the Hacek robots and bellowed insults at Dangerous Knowledge.Knights and Librarians, pofu longs and dwelbs and baba llagas  everybody on both sides went wild.Special effects blossomed in the air above them.And then the shouting got even louder.The robots surged into combat.Huynh looked at the melee of robotic special effects.Mega munches and xoroshows were coming out from the bushes; Sheila was throwing their reserves into the maw of battle.This mech battle was real!When the Greater Scooch a mout tap danced on the backs of spider bots, fragments of carapace and leg flew into the air.In his technician's view he could see damage reports.Twenty regu lomics spiders were listed as "nonresponsive" on the lab's real time roster.Dozens of his tweezer bots were destroyed.Three of the sample carriers had lost mobility.Huynh  > Hanson: <sm>Borrowing robots is one thing, Sheila.But lots of these are going back as junk.</sm>  Sheila was at the other end of the front.It looked like she was trying to get the robots to advance into the Knights and Librarians.On Tim's end, the Greater Scooch a mout had already accomplished some of that by dancing toward the edge of the real human players.Hanson  > Huynh: <sm>Not to worry!Management is happy!Take a look at the publicity, Tim.</sm>  His coworkers and the virtual thousands pushed forward.In the network view jeez, GenGen was getting coverage like you couldn't pay for, better than in the twentieth century when millions were forced to watch just what the few had decided was Important.There were backbone routers in the UCSD area that had run out of capacity!That wouldn't last long, since there were endless ad hoc routers and dark fiber everywhere.But the whole world was here tonight.Step by step, the Scoochis advanced."We want our floor space!""We want our library!""And most of all, we want our REAL books!"Belief circles normally competed from within, based on their own popularity.Here, tonight, was a grand exception: belief circles fighting each other directly for attention and respect.In minutes they might burn up months of creativity, but reach an audience beyond all their earlier dreams.And whoever was driving the Greater Scooch a mout chatted with Huynh directly:  Greater Scooch a mout  > Lesser Scooch a mout: <sm>Your mechs are the thing, my man!Bring them on!</sm>  Okay!Huynh fired up the other forklift.He often dreamed of kicking ass with one of these monsters.He walked carefully through friendly lines, drawing the smaller robots along behind him.From somewhere across the world, Scoochi artists draped the forklift every bit as brilliantly as the Greater Scooch a mout.But this vision was mercurial as smoke: Huynh's forklift was tricked out as Mind Sum, the ambiguous spirit that sometimes helped Scooch a mout when enemies were at their wiliest.Its vapors both lagged and led the real device.Dozens of helpers and helper programs made sure that the effect was always in place.The forklift's hull was dark composite plastic.Unless you looked carefully in the real view, you couldn't be sure just where the robot might really be.Tim Huynh took advantage of all this, stomping like a steel mist across the bottish battle zone, high fiving the Greater Scooch a mout and treading with ambiguous location toward the Knights and Librarians.The Scoochi chant boomed from the forklift's speakers:  "We want our floor space!""We want our library!""And most of all, we want our REAL books!"The advance was a combination of beauty, surprise, and physical intimidation.The Hacek forces fell back and Huynh's chirps and salsipueds hustled forward to claim new ground.But Katie Rosenbaum's critters still outnumbered them and were far more agile.The spider bots raced backwards, keeping a battle zone between the contending human forces.Smale  > Night Crew: <sm>Keep after them!</sm>  As Huynh walked forward behind his forklift Mind Sum, he was also looking down from above and tracking the reviews.There were more than a hundred million people watching what the two belief circles had created.Not quite a game, not quite a work of art, this was a contest where you won with imagination and calculation and impudence.So far, the world thought that the two sides were matched as to imagination, but the Scoochis were way ahead on calculation and impudence.They had created real physical destruction  all around and among real humans!Yard by yard, the battle moved round the library.The Scoochis now occupied parts of the south esplanade, the principal axis of the campus.On the roads around campus, cars were bringing people from all over town, the physical counterpart of the far more numerous virtuals.Forty percent of the backbone routers were saturated.The audience had surged past two hundred million.Hundreds of thousands were players, tricked out with new imagery from the depths of Hacek and Scoochi design.The participants, real and virtual, spread out around the central hub that was the university library.Seen from journalist viewpoints a thousand feet up, the conflict looked like a strange spiral galaxy, its arms glowing the brightest where the battle was the fiercest.There were others present, invisible but for the reporting of the entertainment trade journalists: the movie and game people, maybe a hundred thousand professionals.Some watched the watchers, sampling and polling.Others were down in the bottish battles, collecting designs.He could see the spoor of SpielbergRowling, GameHappenings, Rio Magic, and the big Bollywood studios.Tim Huynh could see more.After all, he was running GenGen equipment.He could see nets that merged with the background, collecting and collecting  then subtly affecting.Those must belong to the Fantasists Guild, the richest artists' cooperative in the world.(Their motto: "We don't need no stinking middlemen!")And of course the police were here, a half dozen jurisdictions from campus cops up to the FBI.Greater Scooch a mout  > Lesser Scooch a mout: <sm>Hey, my man!We have ten minutes to win belief and decision.Then they're going to start shutting us down.</sm>   Alfred watched it all from under Pilchner Hall.Rabbit's riot had emptied the bio labs.The Indo European inspection equipment was in place, and already sending back results (faked results, but that was Alfred's doing).The stooges who had installed that equipment were now well away from the GenGen area, off where their eventual arrest would provoke diversionary suspicions.But   "We need at least fifteen minutes more," said Alfred.The faked data stream from the investigation would complete sooner than that, but cleaning up and getting out would take additional time.Rabbit shrugged."Don't worry, old fellow.I told Huynh ten minutes just to keep him on his toes.Even after the campus police crack down, you'll have another half hour before the GenGen crew begins to trickle back underground. "Mitsuri  > Braun, Vaz: <sm>I think Rabbit is right about the timing.His library operation is a masterpiece.We couldn't have organized a distraction like this without pressing every red button in the Americans' security apparatus.</sm>  Braun  > Mitsuri, Vaz: <sm>The riot has grown too large.</sm> The traffic still blocked their mobiles.Without sufficient mechs on site, they hadn't been able to fully control Pilchner Hall  and two unwelcome children had created the first real problem of the evening.Now one of those children lay unconscious by the caisson, right where Alfred had brought him down.Vaz glanced at where Rabbit sat on the edge of the pit, its furry feet dangling into the dark."What about the girl, Rabbit?Right now she is running around in the tunnels, out of control. "Rabbit smiled broadly."So call me the lord god of unintended consequences.When things get complicated, there are side effects, and Miri Gu is just one of them.You're the Local Honcho.Why don't you go after her?"Braun  > Mitsuri, Vaz: <sm>No.That would put you well outside of our contingency plans.</sm>  In fact, Alfred was tempted.Instead, he had sent down just one mobile to track the girl.It might be enough to distract her.And if she caught up with the stooges, why then they had another option available, something that should surprise Rabbit.Out loud, Vaz said, "I don't think so.Do you have any other suggestions?""The obvious, old fellow: Be flexible, like me.Who knows what opportunities may develop?You can't locate Miri Gu, but big deal.That must mean she's nowhere that interests you and your friends, right?"He waggled his ears inquisitively.Braun  > Mitsuri, Vaz: <sm>I want Mr.Rabbit out of there.He is trying to coopt us , and all the time distracting us with his impudence.</sm>  And that could be very distracting.Rabbit had started on another carrot.The creature grinned around large incisors as it chomped away, as if to say "Don't mind me; sming all you please!"From far beyond the walls, Alfred could hear the sounds of Rabbit's diversionary riot.Counterforce analysts reported that Homeland Security was watching UCSD with intense interest, but was otherwise calm.Gnberk and Keiko took that as good news.But does that mean Alice Gong is still functioning ?For Alfred, that was the question of the moment, far more important than his run in with the two children.In any case, it was time to get the inquisitive rabbit out of here.It had to be done without making Gnberk and Keiko suspicious.Fortunately, Gnberk was already pushing in the right direction.Braun floated a needs and goals matrix into view.The colors were shaded to reflect probability, but it was strikingly pure: for the library riot, Rabbit critical items glowed bright red, a hundred tasks that only he could do if the diversion were to proceed.For the underground labs, there were a dozen Rabbit critical items, mainly involving getting the stooges underground, guiding them around, and getting them out of the operational area.And every one of those was some shade of green.Vaz  > Braun, Mitsuri: <sm>Good point, Gnberk.</sm>  Mitsuri  > Braun, Vaz: <sm>Okay.Cut Rabbit loose, but gently.I suggest you blame this move on your obnoxious remote colleagues <grin/>.</sm>  Alfred gave Rabbit a smile."You are right, Mr.Rabbit.Some of us are sadly inflexible. ""Hey, no problem. "Rabbit waved magnanimously."In fact, you have made things so safe for us down here, my bosses want you to concentrate on topside operations. ""What are you doing  Hey!"Vaz reached down and undipped the fiber optic line from its scamful bridge.For a moment the image of the Rabbit was frozen, like some dumb graphic that had lost its remote source.Of course, Rabbit still had its Internet link to here; this pause was a moment of simple astonishment.When it passed, the creature hopped to its feet."Why did you do that?"Its voice and facial expression were almost without affect.Apparently, Rabbit had never conceived the possibility of having to confront real surprise and embarrassment.The fiber optic plug dangled loose in Alfred's hand.It took an effort of will not to flash a gloating smile at the creature.He slipped the line into a transceiver on his belt.What went in and out the fiber would now go through his private milnet.Braun  > Mitsuri, Vaz: <sm>Bravo, Alfred!</sm>  Mitsuri > Braun, Vaz: <sm>Be nice!We still need him for the riot.</sm>  Rabbit paced along the edge of the hole, its paws waving in a blur that might have been fists."You are breaking our agreement. "The voice was still flat.Alfred put on his kindliest expression and spoke without a hint of triumph."Please, Mr.Rabbit, look at our agreement.We both need the other to profit  and we are each best in our own domain.The equipment is now inserted in the labs.If you will maintain the riot environment for a few more minutes, you will have everything we promised you. "The Rabbit stared expressionlessly."You need me down in the labs.Surely"  He isn't all knowing !"Conceivably.I'll keep you apprised of our situation.What do you say?"There was a sudden cascade of expression across Rabbit's face: anger, then a knowing smile quickly covered up as though the operator had not wanted it seen, then an elaborate, overly patient sigh.Yes, the long suffering Rabbit."Ah, paranoia triumphant.Very well, I will bow to your wishes  " which it did elaborately, dancing on the edge of the pit "  and retreat to keeping you safe from surface threats. "A flash of unherbivorous teeth: "But I do expect all the agreed payoffs.You know my capabilities. ""I do.And I realize there may still be complications," and attempts by you to create complications ."One of our people will run liaison with you and your surface ops. "Vaz  > Braun, Mitsuri: <sm>Keiko?</sm>  Mitsuri  > Braun, Vaz: <sm>I'm on it.</sm>  Rabbit gave a last flippant wave, and suddenly the little room with the plastic walls and the concrete floor was free of all taint of Rabbit.Alfred shut down the remaining Internet links.Now there was just the pile of old clothes, the handcart, the hole in the middle of the floor and their one human casualty.The comforting sounds of mayhem continued to waft down the hill from the library.Vaz  > Braun: <sm>How does the lab data look?</sm> The inspection equipment had been transmitting for some minutes now.Were the lies being believed?Could Gnberk give up his precious theories?Braun  > Vaz: <sm>They're seventy percent complete.We have a lot of post analysis to do, but at first glance these labs look innocent.</sm>  Yes!Greater Scooch a mout  > Lesser Scooch a mout: <sm>Forward, now, my man!The Hacek bastards are giving way!</sm>  And Hacekeans were falling back, at least in the area ahead of Timothy Huynh.He walked his forklift into the gap, crushing what spider bots got in the way.The arc of contention had shifted round till he was almost due south of the library's main entrance.Here the enemy was in retreat.The Scoochis had more real people on the ground and that meant more backup for the visual effects.But the Hacekeans had perhaps two hundred thousand folk from afar compared with half that many virtual Scoochis.On the far side of the library, on the hill by the loading dock, there was no room for a real human mob.Over there, Hacek  the worldwide belief  was in ascendance.Dangerous Knowledge hung out there, more spectacular than ever, orchestrating a sky show that boomed over the north side valley.His reinforcements swarmed downward on lances of light.Tim did his best to follow the big picture, though just now he was very busy stomping on every spider bot that he could lay a foot platter on.He had seen marvels on both sides tonight, things that their belief circles could feast on for at least the next year.And yet there was still room for a clear win.Tonight Scooch a mout could transcend what had been a fringe market and reach the same worldwide big time as the Hacek and the Pratchett and the Bollywood empires.They needed something awesome, something that would put clear sky between them and the Hacekeans.He marched his Mind Sum, his being of mist and steel, back and forth across the front, crushing all that remained of the spider bots.He could think of nothing more spectacular to do.Damn .But there was a world of Scoochis out there, and cleverness to match.Greater Scooch a mout  > Lesser Scooch a mout: <sm>Release the overrides on my forklift.</sm>  Huynh did so.The figure of the Greater Scooch a mout was motionless for a moment, but in his technician's view, Huynh could see its power cells charging capacitors well into the burnout range.And then the Greater Scooch a mout sprinted forward like a human athlete and by God broad jumped thirty feet, to the lawn by the Snake Path.It looked over the north side valley and shouted down at Dangerous Knowledge in a voice that was both virtual and real.And the real was noise unto pain."Hey there!Little Bitty Knowledge!We're equally matched, don't you think?"From the valley by the loading dock, Dangerous Knowledge shook his fist at the teetering forklift."Too equally matched!""But one of us should clearly win, don't you think?""Of course!And that would be meself, as all the world knows. "Dangerous Knowledge waved at its virtual  millions!(But a big part of that count was faked images, Tim could tell. )"Maybe. "The Greater Scooch a mout jumped again, this time to the edge of the drop off over the loading dock.There was something awesome in the maneuver, knowing the tons of real machine behind it."But what is this whole conflict about?"It waved its arms, a cheerleader god, and Scoochis screamed with all the amplification they could muster:  "We want our floor space!""We want our library!""And most of all, we want our REAL books!""YES!"said the Scooch a mout."It's the Library we're all fighting about.It's the Library that should decide!"And with that all the Scoochi sound effects chopped to nothing.An uncertain silence spread across the Scoochis.Sometimes the belief thing got caught in its own metaphors and wound up spouting nonsense.Huynh looked back and forth, gauging the reaction the Greater Scooch had provoked.It sounded good to enlist the library itself, but what did that mean ?Down in the north side valley, there was a flare of laughter.The enemy had come to the same conclusion.We are screwed , thought Huynh.But then he noticed that Dangerous Knowledge was not laughing.The creature came partway up the hill, confronted the Greater Scooch a mout eye to eye.And now there was eerie silence on all sides.Somehow, Dangerous Knowledge knew what the Scooch a mout was talking about."So," the Hacek godling said at last, and its voice had a silken tone even though it echoed off the library and settled deep in the mind of every one in the world who was watching."Ye want the Library itself to decide who should care for it and who should have its space?""And how real the books should really be," the Greater Scooch a mout said, with a smile that seemed almost friendly."I propose that we put the question to the library  and whichever of us it chooses will be deemed the blessed. ""Ah!"Now Dangerous Knowledge was smiling, too, but it was a fierce stretching of the face.The creature backed down the hillside, but grew with each step so that its eyes stayed on a level with the Greater Scooch a mout.Ordinarily, such a cheap visual wouldn't have earned any respect, but the move seemed to fit the moment.Besides, whoever was behind the creature's design had saved some marvelous fractal armor for just this extension of height.Dangerous Knowledge turned to face the virtual millions behind him."The challenge is just.I say to all Followers of Knowledge: Join me in a final torque upon the enemy.Show the Library that we are its future and its greatest supporters.And let the Library show its choice to the world!"The silence was ended as the millions discovered new amplifiers on campus  or somehow usurped and reused the ones that the Scooch a mout had appropriated.The galaxy of players  mechs and humans, real and virtual  all came alive in renewed conflict.Knights and Librarians dumped fire on the Scoochi side.Huynh's Mind Sum was once again stomping and kicking.The ensemble resumed its vasty turn about the university library, and the spiral arms of the battlefront flared even brighter than before.But now the battle cries were appeals to the Library itself.And the library glowed in a light that seemed to come from infinitely high above.That light was purely virtual, but it was seen in every view.As Huynh tromped along with the screaming multitudes, he was almost totally taken by the moment.Almost.This had gone farther and higher than he had ever imagined.Part of the success was simply the audience, a significant part of the waking world.Part of it was the unexpected acquiescence of GenGen and the UCSD administration, and the awesome possibility of future revenue that might come streaming in from the various entertainment producers that now lurked all around.And none of that would have happened if not for the content that had suddenly appeared when they went to battle.Content from both sides, content that was as artistic as new designs and as physical as what they had done with their bottish legions.But now everyone's hopes, Hacek and Scoochi, were hostage to the impossible.If the Library did not "reply," or if the reply was simply more imagery, then in about another thirty seconds, the momentum would begin to dissipate and a very large number of people  among them Timothy Huynh  would begin to feel a little foolish.It was the fate of many flash crowds, especially those that at first seemed the most successful.Big promises earned big rewards, up to the point that the promises had to come true.What could the Greater Scooch a mout have in mind ?Huynh used his technician's view and his artist's.He looked out from Scoochi cams, from the aerobots above, even GenGen utilities.The best he could imagine was some pallid surprise, something to distract everyone from the promise that could not be kept.As the battlefronts tightened around the library, point and counterpoint came from the opposing armies and together made a concerted rhythm.Music seeped into the shouting.After a few moments, every local voice was synched to the sound and everyone was swaying to the beat.It came louder and louder, and Huynh noticed that the amplifiers included police and fire department equipment.Someone had committed real vandalism to make this even more spectacular.It would be for nothing without some definite result.In fact, the singing held together just a few more seconds.Then it faltered as nothing more happened, and no one could imagine anything more happening.But there was another sound, a trembling vibration that crept up from the ground.Ten years ago, Timothy Huynh had felt something similar.The Rose Canyon earthquake.Huynh freaked, dropping all the fantasy overlays.He stared out in panic with his own naked eyes.Real lights flashed back and forth, flickering across the faces of the thousands of real rioters, picking out the angular bodies of the larger mechs.Now there was no pillar of light from heaven.The library was occasionally lit, but more often a silhouette against the lights on the other side.The trembling in the earth grew stronger.The walls and overhanging floors of the library seemed to shiver.The magnificent double pyramid that had survived the decades, that had survived the Rose Canyon quake  it was shaking, all the thousands of tons of real concrete.In time to the rising music.There were screams.Lots of people remembered Rose Canyon.But lots of others were taken by the spectacle  and their singing resumed and was picked up by the vision of the night and blasted out across the world.The library swayed.Parts dipped; parts rose.It was not shaking as much as it was dancing.Not a bouncy riverdance.The building was dancing like a man with feet planted firmly in the ground.And Huynh realized there was no earthquake; somebody had hijacked the building's stabilization system.He had once read that a well powered building could survive almost any quake short of a great crack opening up beneath it.But here that power was being turned upon itself.The rhythmic swaying became more pronounced, twelve feet left and right, and up and down, with parts of the building shifting away and together.The shrugging, swaying dance of the overhanging floors shifted to the outlying pillars.There was a sound that might have been real and might have been ingenious invention.It might have been both.It was the sound of mountains being torn from their roots.The pillars shifted and the library walked.It was not as spectacular as fake imagery could be, but Huynh was seeing it with his naked eyes.In halting cadence, first one fifty foot pillar and then another rose visibly from the ground, moved several yards in the direction of the Greater Scooch a mout, and descended with the sound of rock penetrating rock.The rest of the building shifted with them, twisting on the utility core that was the library's central axis.The Greater Scooch a mout stepped forward and embraced a corner of the nearest pillar.The music became triumphal.Cheering blasted across the world, wondering and still a bit frightened.Hanson  > Night Crew: <sm>Hey is this an Event or is this an Event?</sm>  The Library had chosen.25    You Can't Ask Alice Anymore  Braun  > Mitsuri, Vaz: <sm>By damn!Homeland Security will respond to this.Has Mr.Rabbit gone mad?</sm>  Mitsuri  > Braun, Vaz: <sm>He claims his 'library dance' will only trigger FBI intervention, and all together give us more time.</sm>  Braun  > Mitsuri, Vaz: <sm>Okay.I have the complete dump from our inspection equipment.God willing, that's everything we need to prove what's been going on in these labs.</sm>  Alfred was already working through the exit checklist.He had fooled his friends, but what of his attack on Alice Gong?If she was still functioning, it might not matter what he did."FBI requests clearance to take charge of the riot area. ""On what grounds?"Bob Gu spoke without looking away from the library.Even the unfudged video was remarkable.This was a 1900s concrete behemoth, originally as dumb as snot.Yet it had moved without collapsing."The grounds are the frank evidence of violation of federal law, namely  "A stream of legal references spewed across Bob's vision."FBI argues that this is effectively an attack on a federal building. "Bob hesitated.There were criminal violations here, though UCSD had made no formal complaint.At this point, there was no watch related service FBI could render; they would simply be law enforcement.The watch priority  his priority  was to snoop and swoop.Snoop, then swoop.What might this disorder be a cover for?He glanced at the bio lab status.Still all green.Finally he replied, "Request denied.There is an ongoing Homeland Security investigation here.However, give the first layer of our analysis to San Diego Police and Rescue and the UCSD campus police.Be prepared to support emergency networking. ""Layer one to SDPD and campus police.Yes, sir. "Bob's eyes turned back to the library.It was still standing, but this was damn dangerous foolishness.His analyst pool certainly thought so.In the last thirty seconds, the node structure had come close to turning inside out.For the moment, Alice let the engineers dominate.The text clouds were full of gibber about how the library "walk" had been accomplished and the dangers there might be for the people in and around it.USMC nodes were lodged deep in the discussions, his own people thoroughly caught up in the excitement.That was not acceptable.Bob leaned forward and spoke: "All squads!Move to Launch Alert. "The chances of an actual launch were still near zero, but this would get his people into their assault craft.More important, it got their attention.The USMC nodes moved away from all the speculation and into the tight coordination of marines in a launch prep.Bob stared at the distracted analyst pool for a moment more.Alice was already drawing them away from the library.The structural engineers were no longer the center of the tangle.The library had walked.So what might that be covering?His marines' duty was to guard against the deadliest grand surprises.For instance, were the bio labs still secure?What was going on in the rest of CONUS Southwest?He turned and jogged out of his bunker, into the narrow tunnel that led to his own launcher.The analyst display followed along, hanging just to his right.Alice had grabbed another fifteen hundred analysts, more bio science and drug research people.The ceiling curved low at the end of the tunnel.His assault craft was a tiny vehicle, its design a compromise between time to target and the desire to make the local combat manager invisible.From the ingress tunnel all that was visible of it was the open hatch and a portion of the dead black fuselage.He settled into his place, but did not zip up.What is Alice doing ?He watched the analyst pool grow, now larger than for most worldwide operations.But all the attention was on the bioscience labs around UCSD.True, the situation there was strange.Even though lab security was in the green, the staff was topside in the riot.That justified some attention, but it also made lab surveillance even easier.Damn !Now Alice was stealing analysts tasked with cargo tracking throughout all of CONUS Southwest.Squelching your top analyst was a black mark on everyone, but there was no help for it.Even in combat, this sort of monomania would be bizarre.As it happened, Alice acted first.Emergency flags came up in every view.The assault craft's hatch slid shut and his acceleration pod zipped tight.LAUNCH LAUNCH LAUNCH flashed in his eyes, and a launch clock appeared, counting down from thirty seconds.This was analyst preemption, the sort of drama that happens when analysts realize that their own forces are about to be nuked in their bunkers.Everything would go at once and sort itself out in midnight.But the analyst pool showed no such threat.The launch target was UCSD.The gee pod was inflating tight around him.The countdown clock showed twenty five seconds.He brought up a view of his top analyst."Alice!Advise reason for launch. "Alice's eyes were wide."It's very simple.Onset was slow, but now insight has saturated.This one is undergoing threatful integration.Neuromodulator pathway Gat77 has been subverted.Signaling cascade has too many control points for MCog analysis, but reference"  some kind of arXiv pointer  "demonstrates the progression. "She frowned at him, and suddenly she was shouting: "Don't you understand?This one is failing!Conformational changes are preventing adaptive response!This one  "  Ten seconds to launch.Alice Gu's medicals were off the chart.Eight seconds to launch.Bob overrode the launch order and relieved his top analyst: STANDDOWN STANDDOWN STANDDOWN .The gee pod relaxed around him.He scarcely noticed.Alice's head was down, but she was still talking, desperate.Drool spattered her blouse.And he couldn't notice that either.He promoted her second in analysis, a CIA spook who'd been far too passive tonight.But then what could one do when a star like Alice crashed?The spook was trying her best."I'll have us up in two minutes, sir. "In the meantime, Bob Gu was blinded and the watch was just a mob of bright people watching a million data feeds.One of those feeds was medical: Alice had suffered a JITT stick, the most violent and sudden of her career.Despite all her desperation to communicate, she was stuck in molecular biology.The CIA analyst was back."Sir, are you all right?""I  I'm fine. "Bob considered the analyst display.The spook had hung the operation off the rest of the CONUS watches.There was close backup now.Big chunks of Alice's network were improperly connected, but the spook was healing it, forcing connections and possible correlations.Maybe she was still too heavy on UCSD.She seemed to think that Alice's last words pointed to enemy action there.Okay, after everything else tonight, that had to be followed up."I'm fine. "Over the past twelve weeks, Rabbit had learned a lot; he had grown , you might say.Tonight it all came together.Topside, the riot was at climax  better than sex could ever be, Rabbit was sure.I am the reality arm of the Scoochi belief circles, yeah !There were surprises, too.The affair had called into existence (or simply into his notice?)a creature who might be his equal.Rabbit had played both sides through the first part of the riot but now Dangerous Knowledge had been taken over by something very creative, something who was having as much fun tonight as Rabbit himself.So he had millions of new affiliates, some of them as capable as a human could ever be.And he'd found a special new friend, to boot.His riot fully outclassed the espionage hugger mugger it was designed to protect.It was amusing that despite the carrot greens and all the other generous clues Rabbit had provided, Alfred & Co had not realized whence his powers came, or how great they were.But something told Rabbit that in the long run, what was happening underground was important too.Alfred was playing out his mysterious game down there.Now was the time Rabbit had planned to find out just what Alfred was looking for  hey, and maybe get a piece of it.Now was the time, but Rabbit was locked out.Damn Alfred .The fiber link was behind Alfred's milnet.Short of tipping off DHS  and destroying the wonderful jape Rabbit had so carefully planned  Rabbit was balked.Heh!But what did Alfred's milnet talk to?Why, just a few thousand very clever Indo European analysts!And they didn't get to be so clever by hiding in government holes.They each had their own creative lives.Rabbit hopped from Brussels to Nice, to Mumbai and Tokyo, and  natch  listened to his own inner self.Now that he needed to think about it, he saw how the tricks he had used with American security might be applied.Rabbit tweaked a thousand affiliances, and he listened to a million conversations that he really had no intention of consciously reviewing.One last piece of SHE magic, and viola :  Rabbit was into the milnet!He zipped down through Alfred's stealthed aerobot and once again he was in Vaz's glorious command center in Pilchner Hall.Rabbit took a look at the medicals on the Orozco kid.Still alive.Ol'Alfred wasn't a monster, except when principle demanded it.What was he after?And can I get some ?Rabbit tiptoed down Alfred's connections into the labs.No surprise, Alfred Vaz was making good use of the devices Rabbit's little friends had planted in the GenGen area, sending oodles of data out to his colleagues in Japan and the EU.Rabbit watched quietly; one doesn't ask pointed questions when one is trying to be invisible.He captured the raw encryption, noted what was talking to what within Alfred's GenGen domain.Even so it didn't make sense.The exported data did not match what was locally observed.And then suddenly a big lightbulb went off in Rabbit's mind.Alfred was not searching for anything!He was making sure his Alliance friends did not see what was already there!Alfred, you old devil, running your own program on American equipment and keeping it secret from everybody .And what could be worth such secrecy and such a wild ass cover up?Figuring that out was still a guessing game  but Rabbit was the grand master of guessing, better than any Indo European analyst pool, better even than Alice Gu and all her analysts.Oops.Something told him Alice was in deep trouble.Rabbit had dutifully played messenger boy for Alfred's mysterious snooping on Alice.That must have been the setup for Alice's downfall.But how had he done it?Suddenly, the underground was more intriguing than ever.The heart of Alfred's research empire was in a corner of the Molecular Biology of Cognition area.The data from everywhere else was truthful reporting on innocent proprietary research.Rabbit looked more carefully at the lies coming out of the MCog area.The phrase "animal model" leaked from gaps in the encryption.Animal model, animal model.The term usually referred to animals possessing an analog of some human condition  usually a disease to cure.Somehow, Rabbit didn't think Alfred was trying to cure anything.And there were lots of animals in the MCog area.Of course most were bugs.Gallons of fruit flies, and every itsy bitsy one labeled and probed.Rabbit dipped into some of the local databases.It looked like Alfred was messing with YGBM, but the details were not easy to understand.Rabbit was not always fast.For hard problems, he was like lesser beings; he had to sleep on the question.Then in the morning, the old intuition would deliver remarkable insights.In this case, tomorrow would be too late.Five minutes from now might be too late.Alfred's show was almost over, and with it access to the snooper nodes; heck, the gadgets would probably fry themselves.Rabbit hesitated and listened to his inner self.He had a gut feeling about this.Modern intelligence services existed to prevent terrorism.But Alfred with whatever he was creating here, the dwit might proceed beyond Grand Terror into realms no man was meant to go.So maybe I should just call DHS .Even without Alice Gu, they could shut down Alfred in five minutes.Rabbit gave the possibility the serious thought it deserved about two seconds' worth.And then a big grin spread across his concept of face.Rabbit was full of ideas.And there was one that had been pounding on him since the moment he'd broken into Alfred's milnet.Besides having the greater intellect, I now have the physical advantage !Alfred was on the scene with very low latencies, very high bit rates, and more hard data.Nevertheless, he was stuck in his little room and all but one of his mechs were topside.But the "Elder Cabal" was still down in the labs.True, they were not in the GenGen area, but they were still reachable at the end of a fiber link.And hello, what's this ?The slightly overweight Chinese ninja princess.She was definitely not part of the original plan, but bless her, there she was.What a strange and marvelous girl.Back to business.He was already preparing contingency plans, contingency documents.And if I'm very careful, very quiet, I can sneak out along the fiber, tell Robert and Winnie and Carlos and Tommie the right stories.And then I'll have my own physical hands .What Alfred was planning might go beyond Grand Terror.But that same power in my hands well, that could be glorious fun !26    How to Survive the Next Thirty Minutes.pdf  "I told you my planning would pay off!Didn't I?"Tommie Parker stood knee deep in the remains of the library book collection.The shredda towered behind him like dirty snow, flakes as big as your hand.They had found the Librareome storage at the back of Max Huertas's cavern, just where Tommie had said.It was stored in rows of sturdy cargo containers labeled "Rescued Data. "The containers had been no match for Tommie's cutter.He had flooded the floor with the contents of "A BX. "This had been most of the fifth floor stacks.It seems so much smaller when it's in shreds , thought Robert.Tommie waved at the drifts of shredded paper."You guys ready to start with the glue?This will jam Huertas's operation up the wazoo.And where's your reporter guy?I haven't seen Sharif in a while. "He went around, handing out spray cans.Finally, he seemed to notice his pals' silence."We don't really need Sharif, do we?I mean, we've got our own record. "He lifted the laptop in its sling.Robert looked at Carlos and Winston.Winnie gave a little shake of his head.So none of them had heard from the Mysterious Stranger."Sure, Tommie," Robert said."That's  "  "That will be fine, Professor Parker. "Sharif's voice from Tommie's laptop."Perhaps you could have Professor Gu act as cameraman?"They untangled the laptop from its sling, and the voice directed Robert around to the side.The voice was very picky about where it wanted the laptop pointed, across the edge of the shredda, almost in line with their path into this vacant hall.Then Robert noticed letters painting silently across his field of view.It was sming and the letters were green.Mysterious Stranger  > Robert: <sm>Hey, my man!</sm>  Mysterious Stranger  > Robert: <sm>Ah, ah, ah!Be discreet.We don't want Alfred to know I've come back to help you.</sm>  Alfred ?thought Robert, but he kept quiet.No one else seemed to notice the Stranger's arrival.Tommie walked back into the drifts of paper, tossing them up in the air, squirting them with his spray can."Is the camera getting this, Robert?"Robert looked down at the laptop's screen. "Yes. "Any other time, the effect of Tommie's aerosol glue would have been a showstopper.He threw another armful of loose shredda into the air, and sprayed a mist of glue.Where mist and paper met, the page fragments were suddenly tumbling as one.The mass drifted slowly to earth.Most of the frags never actually touched the ground, but hung permanently in the air.Tommie laughed and pushed at the hazy something.The ensemble of scattered papers rocked back and forth, like bits of fruit in invisible Jell O.   Tommie whooped."Try it yourselves.Just don't squirt each other. "He threw another armful up, and another.Arches of paper and mist grew around him.Robert hung back, playing cameraman.Mysterious Stranger > Robert: <sm>Look where Alfred has you pointing the camera.See the light?Coming out of the dark?</sm>  There was a tiny pool of light, someone running down the steps into the Huertas cavern.It was Miri.The girl came pounding across the floor shouting, "Robert!Robert!"Tommie and the others turned to watch, openmouthed.Miri came around the edge of the shredda.She was gasping for breath.Winston looked her up and down and then looked at Robert."This is another Gu, isn't it?""um, my granddaughter. ""I thought we agreed to keep this among ourselves!"Winnie's glare was as good as any high tech messaging: You're going to ruin this for all of us .But Tommie was more astounded than any of them."How could she get through security?The cops should be all over. ""No, no. "Miri managed to speak between gasps for breath."Must call police!"The laptop had its say, too: "Pay no attention to this child.Remember why you are here. "Robert shoved the laptop at Winnie and reached for Miri."How did you find us, kiddo?"Her arms went around his middle."It was Juan and me, and  " She hesitated, looked up at him with her eyes wide.Gone was her usual assurance.Horror looked out.  "somebody's using you, Robert.I think they maybe, maybe killed Juan!""Not so," said the laptop."Uh  " The voice hesitated.Mysterious Stranger  > Robert: <sm>Heh.Alfred put ForgetIt gas ir your belt boxes, and now he's wondering why you're still standing.</sm>  "Gentlemen," the voice resumed, "I advise you to remember why you are really here. "Tommie had come out from his fountains of paper.His spray can dangled unnoticed from his fingers.He looked at Carlos and Winston and Robert."Yes, what is it that we're supposed to remember?Why are we really here?"Carlos and Winnie wouldn't look him in the eye.Carlos mumbled something in Mandarin."We did what we thought was right," Winston said.Yes, each our own vision of what was right, but Juan murdered ?He looked back at Tommie."We tricked you, Tommie.Someone else is behind this. "Tommie walked back to the pile, kicked aimlessly at his masterpiece."But I thought I had my touch back. "He glanced at Miri and seemed to be putting together all the inconsistencies.His shoulders slumped."Okay.I was an old idiot.Who was boosting me along, Robert?""I don't know. "Mysterious Stranger  > Robert: <sm>I could tell you.Maybe I will someday.</sm>  Apparently, Winnie and Carlos were not seeing the sming.Miri's chin came up."We've got to get word out. "And the laptop said, "It's not safe to move.Stay where you are. "Mysterious Stranger  > Robert: <sm>Actually, I would recommend the same.But right now I'm peeved with Alfred.Do what you please, my man.</sm>  Tommie Parker looked off into the emptiness of the Huertas cavern.He was shaking his spray can, almost an idle gesture."The gear we planted in GenGen, I thought I made that.Me, the big genius.It could be anything bombs, poison, some kind of takeover hardware.But we're at the north edge of the complex. "He waved at the wall that loomed from the dimness just beyond the shredda containers."That overlooks Sorrento Valley.There are some old entrances.We could have used them instead, except my research said the alarms would be harder to disable  but now I don't care if busting through them sets off alarms!""Stay where you are," said the laptop."You are surrounded by lethal weapons!"Something small and black sidled out of the darkness."I saw one of those on Gilman Drive. "Miri took a step toward it.The robot turned toward her.There was a metallic click that sounded very much like a round being chambered."Miri  " Robert held her arm, but Tommie was coming around from the other side and the robot turned toward him.Parker stopped about seven feet from the critter.Some of his old cockiness returned."I'll bet it's just a network superiority bot.Most of the pay load is communications and counternode gear.It's not much use all by itself. ""There are hundreds on the floor," said the laptop."Don't force us to act. "Miri slipped loose of Robert."I didn't see any others," she said, moving closer to the robot.Mysterious Stranger > Robert: <sm>There's only the one, but</sm>  And then several things happened at once: Robert pulled Miri behind him.Tommie stepped forward in a fencer's lunge that brought his spray can within a foot of the mech.The robot flipped up like a sprung rat trap.Tommie screamed and fell forward.Robert ran toward the robot and grabbed  hard air.The hardened froth was barely visible, but it held the robot beyond his reach.He spun the gel around, looking for some point closer to the enemy.There!He slammed the carapace into the concrete floor.Again.It was in pieces now, each still embedded in the mist.There was sound of tiny motors, whining to be free.Then Miri and Carlos were stomping on what remained.Sparks flew within the mist, and Robert felt a tingling that raised the hairs on his arms.And then the robot was just dead composites, the pieces hanging motionless in blocks of invisible fluff.The only sound was Tommie gasping.Winnie had rolled the little guy on his side.Tommie's face was bluish, his mouth a gaping grimace of pain."What happened, Tommie?"Parker's back arched."Bastard fried my pacemaker. "Carlos was on his knees.He touched Tommie's shoulder."Wmen shsi le ng jqrn .We killed the robot, Dr.Parker. "Tommie grunted acknowledgment, even as he rocked back and forth on the ground."We'll get you out of here, Tommie," said Blount.He looked up at Robert."No more games. "Mysterious Stranger  > Robert: <sm>Oh, damn.Parker was such an interesting wannabe.Okay, I'll help you get him out.And if you help me after that, I can still make good on my part of the bargain.How's that?</sm>  Robert looked past the greenish letters and nodded to Winston Blount."No more games. "Tommie still lay twisting in pain.His voice came out between spasms."Keycard in my pocket. "Mysterious Stranger  > Robert: <sm>Heh.Magical me, that ancient keycard will actually work.My little surprise present for Alfred.</sm>  The voice from the laptop  Alfred?was silent.Carlos looked down at where the laptop sat on the concrete floor."We should break this.It's the eye of the enemy. "Miri walked around the antique computer."I think if we pull the plug on that fiber, the bad guys are gone. ""Yup unplugit!"Mysterious Stranger  > Robert: <sm>Hey wait.Where do you think I'm coming from!So what if Alfred can still snoop?It's me you need.If you cut me off then well damn I'll have to</sm>  Miri picked up the laptop and turned it on edge.She studied the unfamiliar physical connectors for a moment, then reached down   Mysterious Stranger  > Robert: <sm>I hate Miri.</sm>   and popped the optical fiber out of the laptop.For a moment they grinned at each other like idiots.Tommie squeezed out a weak laugh."We're off the leash. "He gasped for a few seconds."Gotta carry me, guys Sorry.I'll show you the exit. "Winnie looked down at Tommie."We'll get you out, Tommie.You'll be okay. "He lifted Parker under the shoulders, then reached to support him under the knees.Parker didn't weigh that much, but Blount was staggering.Robert reached out."I can carry him, Winnie. "Blount glared back, and Robert shut up.Then Winnie's hands slipped and Tommie almost crashed to the ground."I got him, I got him!"Miri ran around Blount and slipped her hands under where he was holding Tommie's left arm.Winnie didn't object; maybe it was because she didn't ask.Robert took both legs and they started off along the wall.Carlos followed, carrying the cutter and what other gear might still be of use.Nothing more followed, nothing they could see.For what it might be worth, Robert's dumb little waist box showed only utility glimmers in the empty cavern.Tommie's breathing was a raspy wheeze.Every few paces he twisted within their grasp."About hundred yards more" He shuddered and went limp."Tommie?"Winston hesitated, bringing them almost to a halt."Keep going keep going. "And then after a moment, "So our Librareome protest was fraud from the beginning, huh?""I don't know, Tommie.I knew it was silly, but it seemed worthwhile. "Blount looked across at Robert."I thought it would lead to something I really want. ""Me too," said Carlos, his voice faint."In the end, Sharif whoever got to all of us, didn't he?""All but Tommie. "Miri was watching the back and forth silently, but her eyes were wide.Well, she had earned the right to listen.Robert said, "So what did he promise you, Winston?"Winnie's lips pulled back from his teeth."I sure as hell won't tell you. "He hesitated and the snarl became a twisted smile."But I bet I know what your deal with the devil was. "When Robert didn't reply, Blount's smile broadened and he continued, "You tried to disguise it, Gu.All the times we met in the library, and never once did you pull your old tricks.At first I just figured you were setting me up for one of your extreme traps.After I learned about Sharif, I thought maybe you were running him . "Winnie laughed."But then I began to suspect the truth.You've lost your killer edge, the way you could look inside people and see what would hurt them the most, and then do it to them.You've lost that, haven't you, Robert?"Robert lowered his head."Yes. "The word came out softly, without anger, almost a sigh."And I bet you can't write poetry anymore, either. ""It's the poetry I want back, Winnie. ""Oh. "Tommie twisted in their grasp, trying to suck in breath."Shut up the north gate should be in next hundred feet. "They walked in silence, eyes straining for some sign on the unmarked wall.And now that Robert was looking, he saw something else.Not more green lettering, but a blinking icon that meant pending mail.One last message before Miri had cut the fiber link.Almost without thinking, he shifted his grip on Tommie's leg, and tapped a go ahead on his waist box.A pdf, by God .He hadn't seen anything like this since his teaching days.The table of contents floated in the air above him.The critic in him couldn't resist scanning down the page.The ToC was impeccably formatted, with perfect spelling (at least, if you ignored context).The bullet headers were a mishmash of unparallel constructions and grammatical infelicities.It looked as if it had been thrown together by a gang of par aliterates in a hell of a hurry.But what it said was important:  FIXME: This needs to be replaced with proper formatting, actually doable, but not now.While We are out of Touch  or  How to Survive and Prosper during the Next Thirty Minutes  by Your Friend, the Mysterious Stranger Dedication:  To the idiots among you who cut the fiber link.Now Alfred can't see you, but I'm cut off, too.Hence, I'm breaking my stealthy cover and shipping down this bolus of bits before Miri pops the connector.Executive Summary  [none provided]  Table of Contents  Introductionpage iv o How to use this document  Chapter 1, Saving Tommie Parkerpage o The Huertas back door o The keycard that should not work, but does!Chapter 2, Your beknighted wearablespage o Not really hecho en Paraguay , unfortunately for you o The knockout gas  ah, but I already told you about that o What you can and cannot trust about these gadgets  Chapter 3, What Alfred is up topage o And why you really don't want Alfred to succeed *The animal model  or, world domination out of little fruit flies grows o Why calling 911 is not fast enough to stop him o If you don't believe me, just show this file to Miri!Chapter 4, What you can do to helppage o Map of Huertas territory o Map of GenGen MCog arrays.Alfred owns this territory, networkwise  but I'm there, too o How to get back to the MCog arrays o What you can do to defeat Alfred o Come be my hands in this glorious struggle!Chapter 5, What's in it for you?page o Promises made and promises kept o With your helping hands, I can still deliver  Appendix Apage o Neat stuff that will impress the Department of Homeland Security and which may make life easier after your arrest  Appendix Bpage o Why Scooch a mout should be the Library's lord and mascot  Robert looked at Miri.She was concentrating on holding up Tommie's shoulder.For the moment all her nerdly interests seemed far away.But we need the nerd as much as ever .Robert  > Miri: <file type='pdf7> And he pushed the Stranger's file across to her.Tommie did his best to count Winnie's paces.But there were distractions.There was this rock concert playing in Tommie's chest, and every screech of the beat sent fire across his shoulders and down his arms.This wasn't a real heart attack.This was just his pacemaker fallen into wild chaos.The last few years, Tommie hadn't been too envious of other people's diddling medical miracles.So what if his vascular system was falling apart; the pacemaker would keep him going till classic science fictional immortality arrived.But now all his plans for living forever were in trouble.Count the paces.Count the paces !And then there would be seconds when the pain would let up, and his heart was a butterfly flutter in his chest.For a few seconds his thoughts would clear, and then he would black out They were carrying him still, though the ride was bumpy.Ol'Robert was shifting around like he had business with the box on his belt."Okay.Stop," he whispered.He would have shouted, but the whisper was all he had just now.They heard him.And then he was lying on the cold, hard concrete.Winston's voice came down from high above him."So where is the door?I see!"Sounds of Winston fumbling with the keycard.Something big slid aside and there was a wall of faint light, maybe the night sky.He felt cool breeze on his face.The sound of the freeway was like distant surf."No alarms," said Winston."Maybe silent alarms?"he managed to wheeze.This exit had been such a wild ass escape option in his original plan.Winston was a shadow against the sky.He was tapping at his keypad."I got 911, Tommie!"Now he was talking to someone Tommie could not hear, telling them about a man down with a heart attack."They're on the way, Tommie!They want your med log. "The rock concert was back, whacking a new tune in his chest."Bet med log is fried. "He twisted onto his elbows.There were more important things."Tell'em about the labs, Win!""I told them.I just called 911 myself. "That was Robert's granddaughter.Her feet were right beside his head.Now she stepped away, became a second shadow, beside Winston.She turned this way and that, the way kids do when they're playing games with their wearables."I don't like this," she said after a moment."You heard the Highway Patrol, kid. "Winston's voice was tight, like he was worried as hell."They're sending a car.We just have to sit tight for a few moments. "Tommie's pacemaker was working upward to the next crescendo.Okay, give it a few seconds more and the pain would lessen  or maybe this time, his heart would break.The girl's words floated in and out of hearing: "  is an emergency.They should airlift.And the net is screwy.I can't route to my friends, not even sming.I think someone's spoofed the local nodes and  " Tommie rolled from side to side, pain blotting out the rest of the sentence.Someone was cradling his shoulders.Carlos?"It'll be okay, Professor Parker. "The voice turned away from him."I'm having some access problems, too.But the error messages make sense.I think the library riot is soaking up too much resource. "The little girl's voice was scornful."So much that I can't even sming?""How about laser direct to the freeway?"That was Robert.The girl's shadow repeated the strange little dance."I can't quite reach it from here. "She was silent for a moment."We're just playing into the Badguys' hands.Here.Take a look at this pdf. "Winston again: "There will be a car!If one doesn't show up in five minutes, we'll  we'll carry Tommie down the hill ourselves. "Tommie's heart had stopped.No, it was back in butterfly mode.He'd have a few seconds of clarity.The girl was probably right, but there was no way he was going down that hill.The others should go, see if they could get far enough to put out a real alarm.Or maybe they should go back into the labs and give the enemy a big surprise.Darkness was rising inside him.In a moment or two this would not be his problem.And his friends were too stupid to leave him here.Maybe he could set some of them loose.Listen to me !But Tommie's words came out scarcely louder than a sigh: "Guys we gotta split up. "And then the darkness had him.27    The Revocation Attack  Xiu Xiang looked out from their car, at the dark hillsides."I feel pretty useless, Lena. ""You feel useless?"Lena Gu shifted irritably in her wheelchair.Their plan had been to be a mobile presence across the places where Robert was most likely to show up.Tonight they would be on the scene and no one could balk them.Instead, all the action was elsewhere.Even the transportation was uncooperative, operating under "special event rules" in all areas near UCSD.Their car was moving as slowly as they could make it go, but in another thirty seconds it would reach the south end of this old bit of asphalt, at which point  no matter how loudly they demanded otherwise  it would turn left at the little T intersection, away from the hillside, and take them back to the freeway.Then, if they wished, it would drive north to the Ted Williams Expressway, turn and come down here still again.Xiu stared into the dark of the hillside.And saw nothing."I've practiced so much, and still I can't make my contacts work right. "Lena said, "Actually, there isn't a whole lot to see here.This hillside has to be the dumbest public land near campus. "There was some real light.It silhouetted the hilltops and lit the low overcast; around the library, insanity still reigned.A few minutes earlier, Lena had guided Xiu through some of the views.Celebration, riot, whatever it was, the network stats were impressive.Now Xiu couldn't see any of it.Okay, I confess defeat .She reached into the backpack on the floor by her feet.The pack contained her shop class projects.She had told herself they might come in handy tonight.How, she couldn't really imagine, but the gadgets did prove that X.  Xiang could still create.There was something useful there, even if it wasn't one of her gadgets.She pulled out her view page, sat back, and enjoyed the clunky comfort of its old fashioned inter face.What a fall from grace this was  but just now, she was too nervous for Epiphany.Lena abruptly said, "We have more audio from Juan!"The boy's voice was almost a whisper: "We're still in Pilchner Hall.We're waiting for Miri's grandpa to come back from the basement. "Miri's voice came faintly to the microphone: "They're not doing anything . ""Lemme talk to Miri," said Lena.Xiu listened to the two for a moment.They couldn't get any video, and Miri's Epiphany had suffered a 3030 error.(Xiu had looked that up; "3030" was a catchall code for a system deadlock caused by licensing conflicts. )Meantime all they had were these very occasional, very brief voice messages through Juan."Gotta go," whispered Juan, and the session was ended.Lena was silent a moment, just watching the familiar dark landscape slide by."I want to see those kids.They're needing a smart grilling Any chance the link was faked?""Juan is a careful boy.It would be almost impossible to fake his Epiphany's cert  "  Lena harrumphed."And as far as I can tell that was their voices, but talking in whispers and not saying much except that everything is boringly safe. "It was strange, if the children needed stealth and a low bit rate, that they had not used silent messaging.Maybe someone thought they could fool a pair of old ladies.In fact, with Juan's wearable, I could fake sessions like this !She glanced at Lena."Maybe you should call in the marines. "Bob and Alice."Yes, but if it's a small emergency, they can't do anything more than you or I.  And if it's a big emergency  well, they might have to do something awful. "Lena hummed a few bars of something nervous."And Miri says everything is fine.Just fine. ""Maybe we should call the police. ""Ha!Nowadays you don't have to call the police; they just happen to you. "Lena was staring at the hillside, her fingers trembling against her lips.The last couple of months, Lena Gu had been such a reliable source of certainty.What if we both wimp out ?Xiu thought.Now, that was a frightening idea.She tried to think of something really forceful to say: "um, your ex has been 'doing nothing' for almost half an hour.Don't you think that's too long?"Lena's head bowed, and she said softly, almost to herself, "Oh, Robert.You're up to something terribly stupid, aren't you?"She stared into the dark."Let's give Miri five more minutes.Then we'll call 911. ""Okay. "They tooled along the valley floor, slowly enough that the windows could roll down.The resinous scent of manzanita drifted in.On their left was southbound Highway 5, a lightless torrent of fast moving vehicles, edged by the blaze of the manual lanes.On their right were steep, dark hills, violet light flickering along the ridgelines.Xiang brought up a local network view, looked back and forth between that and the physical world.Their little automobile was speeding up again.A pleasant male voice spoke within the passenger cabin: "This portion of Valley Bottom Drive is misfunctioning.You may return after ten a. m.  tomorrow. ""What?Now we can't even circle back!There has to be some override, Xiu. "Xiang shook her head.This would be their last drive through here tonight.Xiu had helped design the hardware security layer.It solved so many problems.It made the Internet a safe and workable system.Now she was its victim She thought again of the bag of tricks that sat on the floor beside her feet.She had spent the whole semester building those gadgets, her mechanical daydreams.Maybe   "Xiu!Traffic!"Lena was pointing up the hillside.Xiu leaned over and looked out Lena's side.She saw two spears of light that just now were turning away from them."It looks like a car on manual," or maybe it was on automatic, but driving on unimproved roadway."It must be on the service road. "Lena paused, and a map appeared on Xiu's view page, showing the road they hadn't been able to get on.The road that led to Huertas's old back entrance.The lights turned back toward them, then disappeared behind an outcropping.Xiu's view page didn't even show a nav marker for the other vehicle."What are they up to?"said Lena.Their own car was almost to the T intersection."Car!"said Lena."Turn right. ""Sorry.That's not an existing road.The only legal turn is left. ""Turn right!Turn right!""I'm sorry.I'll have you in safe traffic in less than five minutes.Please think about giving me an ultimate destination. "Xiu bet herself that company logic had decided it was dealing with a DUI customer.If they didn't come up with something sensible, the vehicle would take them all the way back to Rainbows End.Lena sucked in a breath."We're so close.Wait.I got a ping response.It's from Thomas Parker's outfit.They are up there!"And then much louder: "Hey, car, I wanna speak to your supervisor  I mean a human beingf  "Certainly, twenty seconds please. "Twenty seconds would put them past the T intersection.Lena Gu seemed to shrink down in her wheelchair.Her gaze swept back and forth between the hillside and the approaching intersection."We've got to stop them, Xiu.I'll wager they could tell us what's going on. ""You'd come out from cover?Let You Know Who see you?""I'd lurk in the background. "But the question was moot.The intersection was just fifty yards ahead.In a few seconds they'd turn left, and be conveyed ignominiously away.Or maybe not.Xiu lifted her backpack onto the seat beside her.She picked up the curved tube with the can of diamond flakes; she had improved her first shop class project out of all resemblance to the original transport tray.This new model was very much designed with destruction in mind; sometimes you needed to get the machines' attention.She knelt on the back facing seat and set the tip of the cutter against the dashboard.Given Robert Gu's example, she had a good idea of what to expect.Oops."Lena, scrunch down!"Lena looked at the tube in Xiu's hands."Yes!"She laughed even as she tried to flatten herself out of Xiang's way.Xiu pressed the start button  a real physical button!and a roar ripped through the cabin.Her transport tray, now a very fine accelerator, drove three thousand diamond flecks into the dashboard every second.The recoil was a soft, steady push.It was easy to keep the tip pointed.Some of the diamonds bounced up, embedding in the acoustic ceiling, but most drove straight into the dashboard.She wobbled the cutter's tip and the hole widened.Now she was drilling through drive internals.The car slowed smoothly to a stop, parking itself just short of the intersection."System failure," it said."Emergency backup engaged.Please depart the vehicle and await emergency assistance. "The doors popped ajar on all sides."Hah!"said Lena."I was hoping for a real crash, and you having to cut the doors open. "But she was already backing out of the car.Xiu was speechless.Did I really do this?Timid little X.  Xiang ?Lena wheeled around to the front of the car."We have a hill to climb," she said.For Alfred Vaz, there had been various pieces of good news.He had completed his fake investigation of the GenGen labs and provided Gnberk's clever analysts with evidence that would eventually lead them far away.And finally Alice Gu had collapsed.That had come very late, but it was more spectacular than Alfred had expected; Keiko's people claimed that DHS surveillance was blinded, in chaos.That chaos was unexplained good fortune to her and Gnberk.For Alfred, it could mean complete success.Give him a few more minutes and his private research program would be safe not only from Gnberk and Keiko, but also from the inevitable American investigations.And then things went very wrong:  Miri Gu had found the stooges.He had lost his one mech in the labs, and also his fiber link to the stooges.And now   Braun  > Mitsuri, Vaz: <sm>Mr.Rabbit has penetrated our mil net.</sm>  It was a fantastic claim  and manifestly true.For the last ten minutes there had been minor comm glitches, error retry packets happening a little too often.The statistics were well below the level of reasonable suspicion.But then in a grand gesture  typical Rabbit madness  the creature had sent a two megabyte jumbogram straight through the milnet and off the end of the fiber.Braun  > Mitsuri, Vaz: <sm>Just before we lost the fiber, it seemed the local stooges intended on escape.How much time does that leave us?</sm>  Numerical estimates floated up for "Time till stooges can reach 911" and "Time till DHS responds. "But Keiko's people had an idea:  Mitsuri  > Braun, Vaz: <sm>For the moment, DHS is distracted.I can be very crude.I can fool the stooges into believing I'm the local police.</sm> Such a masquerade would mean hijacking a significant part of the local net.Within the highly regulated networks of the modern world, that was about as subtle as an infantry assault.DHS was truly in disarray.For several minutes, there was no manager level traffic.Alfred was aware of Keiko masquerading as the California Highway Patrol.His own attention was on a number of tasks he hadn't dared try while Alice Gong was still around.Gnberk's analysts were assessing how deeply Rabbit's intrusion had gone.Their conclusions were tagged a soothing green.Braun  > Mitsuri, Vaz: <sm>I wonder what Rabbit was doing?</sm> There were much easier ways of betraying the operation than this.As far as the network analysts could tell, Rabbit had managed little more than to rattle the metaphorical doorknobs of their milnet.The psych people had their explanation: Rabbit was known for its childish ego.It simply couldn't pass up a chance to show off  hence the jumbogram.Such antics could not be taken as a sign of overall betrayal.After all, Rabbit was still doing a magnificent job with the library riot.Some analysts had more paranoid theories.The current favorite was that Rabbit was China; that would make tonight a perfect Keystone Kops comedy, all the Great Powers chasing after each other.But there were also nightmare speculations: Maybe Rabbit had fooled the network analysts and all the lesser paranoids.After all, the jumbogram had been sent just before the fiberlink was broken.Maybe Rabbit was a Grand Terrorist, who had used the Alliance as its stooge, installing its own interests within the labs, a quick conversion of the entire establishment into a death factory.And there was that UP/Ex launcher in the GenGen area, what amounted to a delivery system.Alfred sighed to himself.In the long run, he feared Rabbit as much as the extreme paranoids did, but tonight  well, if they looked too closely, they might see Alfred's own operation lurking in the shadows.It was best to calm things down.Vaz  > Braun, Mitsuri: <sm>I'm with the greens on this.Yes, Rabbit has exceeded our worst estimates.He has broken into our operation's mil net.But we have hard limits on his bandwidth and my people still control the changes being made.Just look at the consistency checks.Short of having physical troops on the ground there, we own the MCog area.</sm>  Mitsuri  > Braun, Vaz: <sm>We also have good control of the topside operation, no sign of Rabbit funny business.The important</sm> <wait on message pause/>  Red doubt was hemorrhaging across the analyst pool, spreading from a statistical analysis team at Moscow Capetown.These were the same chaps who had been consistently right about the Soybean Futures Plot.They had credibility and they claimed that the views from the north side of the GenGen area were corrupt.Those were not views Alfred had subverted.For better or worse, his colleagues had discovered some other deception.Now the signals and stat people in all the analyst pools had precedence.A thousand specialists, who a second ago might have been looking at a dozen other problems, were suddenly watching the same data.Computing resources shifted from a myriad drudge tasks, began correlating data from the accessible sensors in the labs.It was as if Indo European intelligence were an immense cat suddenly come alert, listening and watching for sign of its prey.Only one of the area cams was offline, but others were subtly misregistered.The inconsistencies were scattered all across the area that the Alliance controlled but analysis made the Moscow Capetown guess more and more a certainty.A blotch of deception was moving into the GenGen area at the speed of a fast walk.There !A fleeting glimpse of the Gu child.The analysts pounced on the location, dredged two sets of footsteps out of the lying silence.So Rabbit did have troops on the ground.Mitsuri  > Braun, Vaz: <sm>That damned bunny.We can't stop him.He just keeps coming and coming and coming.</sm>  For a moment there was no conversation.Then:  Braun  > Mitsuri, Vaz: <sm>I can stop him.I can pull the plug on Credit Suisse.</sm>  There was another long pause.Yes.Gnberk's discovery that Rabbit depended on a single apex certificate authority.All power in the modern world, from flying the largest aircraft to moving bytes between components in a single processor, it all came down to the exchange of appropriate markers of trust, as enforced by the Secure Hardware Environment.And far at the top of Rabbit's operations, via billions of unknown paths, there was a single source, Credit Suisse CA.Revoking that authority would disarm Rabbit.It would likely destroy the fellow's access to his own most personal files, leaving nothing but what the creature held in his natural mind (unless Rabbit really was an AI, in which case nothing would be left).But the collateral damage would be enormous.Shutting down a top level certificate authority was a metaphorical weapon of mass destruction.And now it was all that was left to them.Braun  > Mitsuri, Vaz: <sm>Mr.Rabbit must be stopped I have begun the proceedings.Credit Suisse will begin issuing global revocations in fifteen seconds.</sm>  Mitsuri  > Braun, Vaz: <sm>I'm sorry, Gnberk.</sm> Ten percent of the trust apparatus of Europe would slide into chaos in the next half hour.The aftershocks would rattle the world.Whatever else came out of their mission here, for Gnberk Braun it was a career ending failure.Another kind of failure threatened Alfred Vaz.Shooting down Rabbit had been one of his fondest hopes, but not just now !Alfred dipped back into the GenGen viewpoints.Downing Rabbit had eliminated all the slack from the schedule.And I need that time for my own cover up .He was reduced to emergency measures: Alfred brought two more secret teams online.One would use the fruit fly scam to divert what was left of Rabbit.The other would destroy his lab within a lab, destroy Alfred's work of years.But they would also outship his secret lab's greatest prize through GenGen's UP/Ex launcher.For Alfred Vaz, some form of success was still possible.Gu the Eldest and Gu the Youngest hiked southward out of the Huertas cavern.Behind them the shredda containers and the north entrance were swallowed by darkness.The light that traveled above them shone just a few yards in all directions."How far till we're in enemy territory?"said Robert.Miri held a finger up to her lips.She gestured, and silent messaging paraded across his vision.Miri  > Robert: <sm>Your pdf says they only control a small part of GenGen.But I bet they can hear a long ways.Stick with silent messaging.</sm>  Robert fumbled with the box at his belt.The keypad display helped, but typing was tedious.All the tricks that Juan had taught him were nearly useless without Epiphany.Robert  > Miri: <sm>Ok.</sm>  Miri walked in almost perfect silence, and Robert tried to imitate her.In fact, with Winston and the others gone, things were very quiet in Huertas country.Maybe they were as alone as the Mysterious Stranger had claimed, shielded from friends and enemies alike.Miri must have been reading as they walked.More sming appeared.Miri  > Robert: <sm>I didn't know about "Alfred."</sm>  It was curious that she didn't wonder about the Mysterious Stranger.He tapped a few cramped words.Robert  > Miri: <sm>Wht cn we do?</sm>  Miri  > Robert: <sm>Well, there's Mr.Smart Aleck's list.</sm> She waved at the air, and a page of the Stranger's pdf popped into view.Page 17 What you can do to defeat Alfred  First off, even I, your mysterious friend, am not sure exactly what Alfred is up to (but I am afire with curiosity).Here are some possibilities.(l)To blow up the bio labs, classic straightforward terrorism.But don't you think he went to rather a lot of trouble if that's all he wants to do?It would be a gross under employment of everyone's talent.If this is the scam, you will be the heroes of the day, my hands in disabling those little boxes you and your friends planted  but your fame will likely be posthumous.My condolences!(2)To sabotage some component of the labs, maybe in a way that won't become evident till much later disasters.This is almost as stupid as (1).(3)To install (or cover) some fiendishly clever Man in the Middle software that gives Alfred de facto ownership of research done in that part of lab that you, Robert, infested for him.This would be cool, and it is my personal favorite (see my discussion of fruit flies in Chapter 3).Unfortunately for Alfred, this caper is so far blown that I doubt it will survive the audits that will surely come raining down.In this case, you two can help by grabbing anything that Alfred has not yet hidden.(4)In the failure of case (3), or perhaps as his original plan, Alfred may take advantage of your cabal's efforts and outship biologically interesting materials from the labs.[Diagram of the pneumo tube transport system]  [Picture of GenGen's UP/Ex launcher]  To what end?Oh, the usual terrorist possibilities  but more likely, something weird and interesting.I'm confident I can identify such activity, and you  my loyal hands  can physically prevent the loading and outshipment.For the moment we are all in the dark about this.But once you enter the perverted GenGen area, I should be able to contact you again.Be careful, be quiet, and Watch for Me in Your Sky!Miri's words were overwriting the text even before Robert finished reading it.Miri  > Robert: <sm>This guy is always so modest.</sm>  Robert grinned.Then he read her message a second time.And he thought back to all his conversations with Sharif, to the mystery of True Sharif and Stranger Sharif and SciFi Sharif.Oh, my God .Robert  > Miri: <sm>How much of sharif ws u?</sm>  She glanced up at him and for instant her intensity was transformed into a dazzling smile.Miri  > Robert: <sm>I'm not sure.Sometimes we were all mixed together with the real Zulfi.That was almost fun, hearing what the others asked and what you answered.But way too often, I was frozen out and it was just Mr.Smart Aleck.</sm>  Robert  > Miri: <sm>The Mysterious Stranger.</sm>  Miri  > Robert: <sm>Do you really call him that?Why?</sm>  Robert  > Miri: <sm>Yes.</sm>  Because of the magic he promised .But he didn't type that out.Miri  > Robert: <sm>Well, I think he's nothing without us.</sm>  Everything was still dark beyond their little pool of light, but now the walls were closer.They were almost back to the sky tunnel.Robert  > Miri: <sm>Whn will yr mom and dad gt here?</sm> Kids spying on family members and reporting to the government  that feature of tyranny is so much simpler when the family itself is mainly government agents.Miri  > Robert: <sm>I don't know.I didn't tell them.</sm>  Where is tyranny when you need it !For a moment, Robert couldn't think of anything to say.Robert  > Miri: <sm>But why?</sm>  Miri stopped for a second, looked up at him with that patented stubborn stare.Miri  > Robert: <sm>Because you're my grandfather.I knew you never meant to hurt me.I knew you must be hurting inside.I knew Bob must be wrong about you.I figured that if I could help you out from a different direction, you'd get better.And you did get better, didn't you?</sm>  Robert managed a nod.Miri turned and marched on.Miri  > Robert: <sm>But I messed up.I thought Smart Aleck was all I had to worry about.Wherever you broke in, I thought there'd be instant alarms  and me and Juan being there might make things go better for you.Now Juan is</sm>  She hesitated, then reached out to grasp his hand.Miri  > Robert: <sm>Juan is hurt bad.</sm> Her hand trapped his fingers.No matter.Robert had no sensible reply except to squeeze back.Miri  > Robert: <sm>But Dr.Xiang is out there.She'll call for help.And Mr.Blount should be calling the real 911 by now.Meantime, it's up to you and me down here.</sm>  There were surprises in almost every one of Miri's sentences, and if he could have spoken aloud or typed freely he would have asked a hundred questions.
