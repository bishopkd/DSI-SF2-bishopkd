Then, apparently as some sort of explanation, she offered: Volume seventeen.Okay, Sonar, Ty said, you are free to go.Or you can come with us.As much as I would hate to deprive your folk of their knowledge of the last part of the S topics and the beginning of the Ts, I recommend coming with us.He was working out how to explain matters to Sonar without taking all night, but Sonar abruptly said Okay!and, in her scurrying way, fell into step with them.You can leave that, Ty said, nodding at the lump of explosive.A mixture of RDX with beeswax and vegetable oil, Sonar said helpfully.It will not detonate without I know, Ty said, but we dont need it.Sensing eyes upon him, he looked toward the massive silhouette of Bard.The Neoanders face was in darkness, but Ty could guess that it bore an incredulous expression.Ill explain later, Ty said.They walked briskly uphill for several minutes, their view across and down the valley improving as they went.Far below them, the Red delegation had been ascending toward the glider encampment at a stately pace, following in the footsteps that the Seven had made yesterday.Quite clearly, they wanted to be as obvious as possible, and so they were advancing in a pool of brilliant illumination made by portable lanterns, which the members of the peloton were aiming toward the center.The same goalnot seeming to sneak up on the Diggersmight have been achieved simply by waiting a few hours and doing it in daylight.But that was just typical Blue thinking.They were doing it at night for the sheer drama and pageantry of it, this being the sort of thing that Red, by and large, was simply better at than Blue.Ty almost laughed out loud when they got to a place where they could get their first clear look at the approaching spectacle.He was comparing it in his mind to the pitiful show that the Seven had put on yesterday.Of course, the Seven had been surprised, so it wasnt a fair comparison.But the Diggers would not be making allowances for fairness.What they were seeing was probably a lot closer to how their folk, stuck underground, might have been imagining this moment during the last five thousand years.A tall Adan with a mane of glossy black hair preceded the rest.He wore some kind of ceremonial robe that streamed in the cold wind draining down the valley and glowed warmly in the light shone on him by the peloton.Advancing with a measured tread, he held the hoop standard in an absurdly dramatic pose with his upper hand reversed so that the thumb was down and the palm faced forward.It was meaningless but it looked great.A few paces behind him walked an older man with gray hair swept back from his high brow and a neatly trimmed beard.His robes were more subdued but, one suspected, really smashing if you could see them up close.A gold chain around his neck supported a medallion on his chest.His right arm was extended to cradle the left hand of none other than Marge the Digger, whom he was escorting up the hill in the manner of a dad giving away the bride.She was wearing what shed last been seen in, supplemented with a warmer garment thrown over her shoulders like a cape.It kept trying to fall off as she waved her free hand over her head, signaling to her Digger kin that all was well.When they recognized her, they shouted words of greeting and she waved the more vigorously; her cape fell off and was replaced by one of the uniformed Betas.Even at a distance it was obvious that the standard bearer and the one escorting Marge were Aretaics, which was to say, Adans of the first line of descent, presumably conceived as competitors to the children of Eve Dinah.They were tall and long maned, with magnificent noses and excellent posture.A few paces behind Marge and the senior Aretaic were a Camite and one of the Betas, walking abreast.They were joined by a pole about two meters long; each of them supported an end in the crooks of her elbows.In the poles center was a gleaming lump about the size of a persons head, which any Spacer would recognize as a small nickel iron asteroid, as common in space as dead leaves were on the reforested surface.But rare down here, even after the Hard Rain.Ariane must have told her higher ups about the truck, what the excavation of its engine block said about the lengths that the Diggers would go to in order to get their hands on a bit of metal, and how grateful they would be for such a gift.Or perhaps Ariane had been broadcasting the entire mission to Kyoto through some covert, encrypted channel.Anyway, it would make a better token of friendship than a busted shovel handle.Two of the members of the peloton were musicians.At a certain point one of them began to beat a drum that was harnessed to his midsection, and another began to play a melody on a shiny horn.Ty was convinced hed heard it in the Epic somewhere, but it took Bard to place it.Bread of Heaven, he said.Its what Rufus and company were singing when they welded themselves in.Also known as Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah, or in the original Welsh, Cwm Rhondda, added Sonar Taxlaw.Fuck, these people are good!Ty exclaimed.How long do you suppose theyve been preparing this?Bard asked.They have been way ahead of us for months.Maybe years, Ty said.But having said that, theres little in what were seeing that couldnt have been thrown together in a few hours.Confirmed, said Beled.He had let Kath gently to the ground, where she now lay in a fetal position curled about his shin.He was looking at the procession through optics.The ring at the top of the standard?It is an exercise hoop covered in silver tape.The white flag?A bedsheet.Do we even need to bother watching how this goes?Bard asked.And then he looked to Ty to give the answer.It had not been a rhetorical question.He was awaiting orders.Beled Tomov looked at him too.How is she?Ty asked.Pulse, respiration okay?I think it is the usual, Beled said with a nod.Meaning that abrupt hormone shifts in Kaths system were giving her something akin to morning sickness.Her microbiomethe ecosystem of bacteria that lived in her gut and on her skinhad been thrown into disarray, and she was being colonized by any old germs, including ones from the Diggers that had never been exposed to a Moiran body.Can you put her on your back or something?Beled nodded and dropped to one knee.He had been carrying a pack on his back.He emptied its contents on the ground and began slashing leg holes in its bottom corners so that Kath could just be inserted into it, like an infant into a carrier.We cant rule out that our guys will show up in force, Ty said, referring to Blue military.He looked south over the mountains, but didnt see anything coming.Nor would he, of course; anything headed their way from Qayaq would be running dark.Have you been in touch with them?Yes, Bard said.During this little pause he had been rooting a multitool out of his belt.He approached Ty, who held out the broken stake.Bard got his tool clamped around the head of the bolt and began to twist it out.Ty nodded wearily.On one level, he had just asked a stupid question.But the Diggers attackhell, for that matter, their existencehad taken them by surprise, and since then hed been preoccupied with being a prisoner under conditions so primitive as to verge on slapstick.He ought to have been thinking about the larger picture.Blue might bomb this whole valley into the Stone Age.But probably not.It was already in the Stone Age.Bard and Beled had gotten a message up to Denali, which was the closest major Teklan military habitat to 166 Thirty.Everyone of consequence in Blue would now be aware that the Diggers existed, that the initial contact had been botched, and that there was a hostage situation.The Thor would have made it clear that Red was a step ahead of them.The descent of those drop pods, a few minutes ago, would have made it clearer.The brilliant pool of light in which the Red delegation moved was as much for the benefit of long lensed video cameras peering down from orbit as for the Diggers.It was a fait accompli that Red would make formal contact, in about thirty seconds, with the Diggers, and that it would go a lot better than yesterday.Ariane would have prepped them, told them what to say: Yes, of course we accept your claim to the Earths surface.Its justice is self evident.We have plenty of room in orbit.No need for habitations on the planet.Of course, as youve already learned firsthand, you cant trust those people from Blue.We might be persuaded to install a discreet military presence just to keep them from encroaching on your territory.As long as were there, some cultural exchange programs might be in order.We could offer medicine.Dental care.Technical advice in rebuilding your civilization.How may we be of assistance?Blue isnt coming tonight, Ty said.It would just play into their hands.He nodded down at the procession, which was only a few meters away from making first contact with an equally sized group of Diggers.But some members of that peloton might come after us.Theyd look like heroes if they could march us back into camp in shackles.Or carry our heads in on spikes, Bard suggested in a casual tone.Shh!Ty said, with a glance toward the newest member of their band.But the Cyc looked unconcerned.Sonar, Ty said, we are going to have to move.Get away from any patrols those guys might send out, while its still dark.Can you do that?Move rapidly over rough terrain, in the dark?Sure, Sonar said, a little too blithely for Tys taste.But before he could press her, she added: Guess well be going north then?Why do you say that?Because the main group is going south.Probably as soon as the sun is up.How far south were they thinking of going?As it was, they were less than a hundred kilometers from the southern coast of Beringia.To the sea, Sonar said, as if this were self evident.Whats going to happen then?The question seemed simple enough, but it led to an outburst of chuckles from Sonar.Theyre going to wonder what became of me, thats what!she said, when she could get her mirth under control.Theyre probably wondering that already, Einstein remarked.No, I mean theyll be needing me then!Why?Einstein asked.Its a riddle.The bolt had been removed now, freeing the end of the chain, which Ty pulled clear of his collar.He opened the thing up and tossed it on the ground.The gesture caught the eye of the Cyc, who probably saw it as a shocking way to treat valuable metal.Ty was now free, holding the massive stake fragment and managing to control a certain natural impulse to bash her head in.This was not a time for riddles.Einstein got the chain out of his own collar, then carried it in the direction of Kath so that he could help her.The purpose of your expeditionbefore we blundered into your path, that iswas to go to the edge of the water and make contact with the Pingers, Ty ventured.Pingers?Bard asked.Ty ignored him, maintaining his focus on the Cyc.You, by virtue of your mastery of volume seventeen of the Encyclopdia Britannica, are the closest thing your folk have to an expert on the only technology capable of summoning them.Oh, Im an expert on other topics as well!Sonar said.Sophism, South Carolina, Pope Sylvester II ...Ty decided to let the witticisms go by without positive or negative reinforcement.What were you guys going to say to them?Its they who want to talk to us!Sonar said.They left us a messagea cairn on the beach.We are coming to respond.The ensuing silence lasted a long time: long enough for the final stanza of Bread of Heaven to stop reverberating from the mountain walls, long enough for the Adan leaders opening greetingwritten and pronounced in flawless pre Zero Englishto move through a solid paragraph of awe inspiringly sycophantic salutations.Long enough for Bard to get the unchained Kath socketed into his backpack.We move south, Ty announced.Bard, you keep pace with the Cyc.If she slows us down, carry her.Im going to need your radio.My what?!Bard exclaimed.An electromagnetic communications device Sonar began, but Ty cut her off.The thingamajibber you use to talk to Denali.Im going to tell them we have a second chance.A second chance to do what?To make friends with the natives of this planet.THEY CRESTED A PASS IN THE COASTAL RANGE THE FOLLOWING DAY and began making their way down toward the sea.When the going became easy enough to allow for something like normal conversation, Ty asked, How many Cycs are there in total?Sonars little head snapped around, like a birds, to regard him curiously.She would never look you directly in the eye, but she would lurk in your peripheral vision and sneak peeks all day long.I know, Ty said.As many as there are volumes of the Encyclopdia Britannica.But I dont know what that number is, because we no longer have copies of it lying around.Well, there are the Ten, the Nineteen, and the One, Sonar said.The Ten are the Micropdia.Many short articles.The Nineteen are the Macropdia: longer, more in depth articles.The One is the Propdia, the Outline.Which category do you belong to?Einstein, walking ahead of them down the slope, wheeled around.She already told us she was volume seventeen!Normally good natured, he was being unusually chippy all of a sudden.He returned his attention to the rocky terrain in front of him, displaying a flushed neck beneath his ponytail.Excuse me, Ty said.Then, turning back to the Cyc, he asked, Is that just luck of the draw?Or No!Of course not.The older Cycs started me on smaller books, to evaluate me.When?At what age did they start you?When it was decided that I was not a breeder.Einstein turned around again, this time so suddenly that he lost his footing and fell on his ass.The reaction was so outsized that Ty had to look away from it lest he break out laughing.But this brought Langobard into his line of sight, and the Neoander was in similar trouble.The two men had to stop walking and turn their backs on each other for a few moments just to keep their composure.If I can just anticipate some questions that I believe may be uppermost in young Einsteins mind, Langobard said, would it be untoward of me to inquire what, precisely, makes you not a breeder?The Cyc shrugged, staring down the mountain toward the Pacific Ocean as if she had not given the topic very much thought recently.I know not.Of mean stature?Nothing special to behold?On the spectrum?For context, Ty asked, how many young women out of ten are designated as breeders?Four, maybe?So being a nonbreeder is more common than being a breeder, Ty said, for Einsteins benefit.Of course, now that we have come out of the Hole, and we have more space, more people are breeding, Sonar said.I speak of how it was ten years ago.She had earlier told them that she was sixteen.Okay.So they think they know enough about you at the age of six to make that determination.They start you out on easier books.Then what?If you can read at all, you just start reading the whole Cyc.And so thats why you know stuff about radio, and epicanthic folds, and other topics not in volume seventeen.Yes.You have to read the whole thing.By ten, they decide whether you are Micropdia or Macropdia quality.Is one of those more prestigious than the other?Of course!Sonar exclaimed, without bothering to say which was which.Ill bet the Micropdia is just like memorizing a bunch of trivia, Einstein essayed.Somewhat dangerously, in case he guessed wrong.But love had made him impetuous.Yes, you have to be able to hold more in your head to be one of the Nineteen, Sonar said, favoring Einstein with a warm gaze.So, did you have to kill the previous Sonar Taxlaw in single combat or something?Ty asked, and immediately thought better of it, since in general Diggers did not seem to have a well developed sense of humor.Einstein threw him a mean look.No, not in this case, the Cyc said politely, leaving open the question of in what cases the Diggers did actually employ such methods.My mentor was Ceylon Congreve.Now, that is a lovely and distinguished name!Langobard exclaimed.Volume three?Four, she said, with a note of surprise in her voice, as if not quite able to believe that someone could not know this.Do the original paper copies still exist?Ty asked.Oh, yes, Sonar said, but we handle them only on ceremonial occasions.We work with handwritten copies.Rufus must have squirreled away a lot of paper.Tons of it, said the Cyc.Acid free, one hundred percent cotton.During their nighttime escape over the mountains, theyd had little time for such conversations, and so their knowledge of Digger culture was still spotty.Some reasonable guesses could be made simply from the known history of the Hard Rain.The phase known as the Cooling Off had not begun until some thirty nine hundred years after Zero, when the human races efforts to police the lunar rubble belt had finally paid off with a sharp falloff in the number of bolides striking the surface.Until then, the Diggers had been obliged to maintain a small, steady population in the space that Rufus had provided.Expansion of the Hole had been limited by the fact that it was a sealed system, with no place to put spoilthe quantities of loose material created by digging.As anyone knew who had ever dug a hole in the ground with a shovel, the size of the dirt pilethe spoilwas always larger than the volume of the hole.Theyd been able to dump some spoil down a deep and otherwise useless shaft, but once this had been filled, theyd been unable to expand their living space for as long as the Hard Rain had made a direct connection to the outside too dangerous to be contemplated.So during that phasewell over three thousand yearsthey had devoted all of their energies to maintaining a community of several hundred people.Hence the rigid controls on breeding.Thanks to their Cycs, they knew everything about contraception, but they had no ability to manufacture things like condoms and pills, so that lore was mostly useless.The limitations on breeding were enforced by moral strictures, by segregation of the sexes, and by surgical sterilization.This, like all of their surgery, was performed without chemical anesthesia once theyd run out of drugs, which occurred fairly soon after Zero.Apparently they had gotten rather good at acupuncture and at biting down on things.The reduction in the intensity of the Hard Rain would have been obvious to them on one level, since they could hear the impacts through the walls of the Hole.On another level it was easy to miss, since even dramatic changes spanned generations.But they had kept meticulous records of the frequency and intensity of strikes and so they recognized the downward trend in the late Fourth Millennium.When it was adjudged safe, they drilled an adita horizontal tunnelout the side of the mountain until it broke out of a slope that they guessed was steep enough to have shed ejecta, preventing the buildup of rocky debris that now covered most of Earths surface to a considerable depth.That much had been true, but the debris at the base of the mountain had piled higher than they had expectedalmost high enough to block the opening of their adit.Anyway, it had worked well enough that they had been able to push spoil out of it and thus begin expanding the Hole.The atmosphere was still far from breathable, so theyd been obliged to keep it sealed when they were not actively dumping stuff out of it, to prevent fumes from seeping in and poisoning the atmospheric system that they had looked after so meticulously for nearly four thousand years.This system, it seemed, was similar in principle to those used on space habitats.Carbon dioxide was removed by a combination of chemical scrubbers and green plants.Both of these required energy: the scrubber chemical had to be heated to drive off the CO2 it had absorbed, and the plants required light.Since they were cut off from the sun, they got their energy geothermally, using works that Rufus and the others of his generation had sunk deep into the roots of the mountain.The maintenance of this system had been the full time occupation of everyone in the Hole for the entire time theyd been down there.When they had neared the end of their stock of light emitting diodes they had revived the art of making lightbulbs, consulting the Cyc for particulars, blowing artisanal glass envelopes and winding the filaments by hand.Likewise with many other things they had found themselves in need of.Ty, not really an expert on technology, made little headway in trying to imagine the particulars.Someone of a more technical bent might have devoted weeks to debriefing Sonar Taxlaw and extracting every last detail about how they had managed to get along with just the stuff available to them underground.More important for present purposes was to get a general understanding of the Diggers culture, and why they behaved as they did.The requirement for a steel spined authoritarian culture was obvious.Any power structure one of whose main goals was to prevent humans from fucking each other at will had to be extremely formidable.Had these people been living in, for example, the agricultural paradise of the Nile Delta, they might have been able to get away with some mazy religious dogma as the basis for that system.But instead they had been trapped within a large machine that would kill them all if allowed to go on the fritz, and so they had been obliged to develop a culture in which engineering became their dukh.Their finite supply of tungsten, stockpiled by wise Rufus, had to be stretched and husbanded so that their descendants thousands of years in the future would be able to manufacture lightbulbs to grow plants to make food and air.And so on and so forth in every particular of how these people lived their daily lives.Thirty peoplethe Ten, the Nineteen, and the Onewere, at any given time, Cycs.Another thirty were toiling as their apprentices.Others played specific roles such as breeder mom, glassblower, acupuncturist, filament winder, potato nurturer, pump fixer.Structurally, culturally, it was very like a Bronze Age theocracy, but without any trace of God or the supernatural.To that point it was not radically different from the subcultures of many First and Second Millennium space habitats, whichat least for a little whilegave Ty the idea that he could get a quick handle on Digger culture.But that fantasy soon evaporated.Those early Spacers had been living in cramped conditions, yes, and they had been just as dependent upon technology as the Diggers in their Hole.So of course there were some common features in the two cultures.But Spacers had always been able to look outside to see what the situation was, andat least after a couple of thousand years of hunkering down in especially large rocksto venture forth and do something about it.Even in their most desperate hours they had always expected to reinherit the Earth.The Diggers only way of knowing their situation and their fate was to listen to loud noises, tally them on acid free, 100 percent cotton paper, and, every few years, compare the tally with a similar one made by some ancestor a couple of hundred years previously.For the first four thousand years, hope of a better future must have been seen as sheer folly.Worse than that, as an active betrayal of Digger principles, since people with hopes were apt to become profligate in spending resources and taking risks.Which all made for a picture of those first four millennia that was as clear as it was bleak.But change would come hard to a society like that one.What was most interesting to Ty was what had begun to go on within that society when theyd punched the spoil adit to the surface and begun to expand their underground domain.Their day to day lives would not have changed much, but theyd have had at least the abstract possibility that their civilization might expand, that more people might be able to breed.All of that had occurred more than a thousand years ago.The Hole had grown to the point where it could support a population of two thousand; then, around 4700 when the atmosphere had become breathable, theyd been able to take it up to ten thousand.All still beneath the surface, however, since thered been little for them above it.At some point the Committeewhich was what they called their ruling councilmust have become aware that vast numbers of humans were living in space and actively prosecuting the TerReForm.They could simply have walked out onto the surface and sent out some kind of an SOS at that point.Instead they had made a positive decision to conceal themselves, to hide their spoil dumps, to shun communication with the Spacers.The central question, then, was why they had made such a choice.Sonar Taxlaw wasnt much help in explaining it.When Ty or the others asked questions, she offered nonresponsive answers that told of a subterranean culture in which such things were never spoken of.It was clear, however, that having made that decision, the Committee would have to explain it, justify it, and perpetuate it by painting the Spacers as alien mutants, and furthermore by cultivating a finely developed sense of racial grievance against the cowards who had run away and abandoned them.All of which had been on vivid display during the brief and disastrous conversation between Doc and the Digger contingent.BETWEEN EINSTEINS PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE TERRAIN, GEOGRAPHICAL folklore stored in the Cycs encyclopedic mind, and Beleds digital map, they knew generally where to go at any particular moment.What made it difficult was negotiating obstacles in the terrain and steering clear of large animals.The latter group might, in theory, include Red military patrols, but they had no reason to believe that they were being pursued yet.Why would Red bother?Marching some Blue prisoners back in chains might score them some points with their new Digger friends, but having chased them off into the darkness was nearly as effective.Perhaps more so given the importance to the Diggers of the meme of Spacers as cowards.Ty considered explaining to the Cyc that if her group of Diggers had turned up on the west side of 166 Thirty making the same preposterous territorial claims, Red, instead of approaching them with music and nuggets of space iron, would simply have vaporized them.But burdening the poor girl with that awareness wasnt going to help.They holed up in a pocket of shelter beneath a leaf of rock about the size of a football field that had been driven like a blade into the southern slope of a coastal mountain.There they consumed a day recovering from their exertions and waiting out a snowstorm, while communicating in short bursts with a transmitter on the Denali habitat.Blue military dropped a pod through the storm.Kath awakened long enough to announce that it had landed just down the slope from them.Bard stomped out there, his huge feet acting like snowshoes, and returned a quarter of an hour later dragging it behind him.He then stood for a few minutes contemplating Kath.Her sickness had abated, but she woke up now only to eat, eliminate, or make delphic pronouncements.The pod contained food, fuel, ammunition, robots, and equipment for snow travel that stood them in good stead during the next day, as they descended out of the mountains toward the southern coast.Much of this happened under cover of the heavy clouds that almost always blanketed this part of the world, and so if anyone was watching them, it had to be directlyby actually following them aroundor with flying robots.But now they had flying robots of their own that could alert them to the presence of both.Since those remained quiet, they felt reasonably certain that they were not being tracked, except by large canids who tended to make their presence obvious by howling a lot.Because of them, the next night was a restless one, and led to an early departure and a final day of hiking that rapidly developed into a pell mell descent out of the Alpine zone and toward the Pacific.During their lunch break, they spied a trio of single person glidersinflatables like the one Kath Two had taken on her Survey missiondipping and darting along the coast from the general direction of Qayaq.As these carried Blue markings and were transmitting Blue codes, Beled felt comfortable divulging their position.Minutes later the gliders had touched down in an expanse of heather a few hundred meters below them.Their occupants climbed out, eviscerated their cargo holds, and began to deflate their gliders so that they could be rolled up.Most of that work ended up being done by a Teklan, shorter and more lithe than Beled.This left the other two new arrivals free to approach.One of them was a Camite whose gait and posture were more expressive of male than of female characteristics, and so Ty made a mental note to employ male pronouns until and unless the Camite requested otherwise.He wore one of the utilitarian coveralls employed by Survey personnel, with red cross patches on the chest and shoulder, marking him as a medic.The other was a middle aged Ivyn dressed in civilian clothes marginally more posh than might be expected in the wilderness of Beringia, but suited to the conditions.Regarding them from a more sheltered position overlooking the meadow, Ty had mixed feelings.Any assistance was, of course, welcome.He had known better than to expect a thunderous show of force.Blues high political councils, having been caught badly off guard, and having lost the first round to their Red counterparts, would still be assessing the situation and thinking about their options.For public consumption, they were probably characterizing the Seven as a plain vanilla Survey team that had fallen victim to an ambush.They didnt want to undercut that story now by sending in an undeniably military force.The name printed on the Camites uniform was Hope, which probably meant that, like many Camites, he only used one name.Bent under a medical pack, he went directly to Kath.Beled and Bard were descending to the meadow to help the Teklan pack up the gliders.The Ivyn singled out Ty from a distance and approached him.The family name on his uniform was Esa and he introduced himself as Arjun.The former was an acronym frequently seen in the background of shots in the Epic, standing for European Space Agency.It had become a common name.Ty considered asking Arjun flat out who he was and what he did for a living that caused him to show up in circumstances like these.But he knew it would get him nowhere.The man would have some bland answer cued up.He was probably some kind of high powered intelligence analyst with five advanced degrees.Hows this all playing up on the ring?Ty asked him.Do I even want to know?The mere question caused Arjun to break eye contact and gaze out over the sea.That bad?Ty prompted him.You know the Aretaics, Arjun said.They made it into grand opera, eh?Thats as good a description as any.I am still coming to grips with it.Of course, we rarely see content from the Red side of the ring.Just the propaganda, Ty said.Yes, and when we see that, we have a laugh at the overwrought style, the baroque production values, while harboring an inner sense of anxiety that some people within Blue might Might actually believe their shit?Exactly.So Red did broadcast it.Arjun nodded.Live, to the whole ring.Sorry I missed the show.We bolted before the actual contact.It seemed like as good a time as any.That was a fine tactic, Arjun replied, and saved you a great deal of annoyance.How do you mean?Arjun turned to look directly at him.The Diggers, he said, were as receptive to Reds overtures as they were hostile to yours.Ty felt something in his chest.The awareness that he had failed, and that people knew it.It was not a feeling to which he was accustomed, and he did not like it.So, he said, the Diggers ate it up?They signed an alliance with Red on the spot.Red recognized their claim to the entire land surface of Earth and urged Blue to follow suit.Just as a matter of basic human decency, Ty said sourly.Of course.The saber rattling began the next day ...Esa Arjun broke off as he noticed, and focused on, Sonar Taxlaw, who was standing next to Einstein, who was telling her how the gliders worked.Ty had grown used to it; all those two did the whole time they were awake was explain things to each other.But it was new to Arjun.Shes the ...Arjun said, and trailed off.Ty tried to put himself in Arjuns shoes: laying eyes on a rootstock human for the first time in his life, seeing someone who was clearly human and yet not of any identifiable human race, thinking about all that her ancestors had lived through.Yeah, Ty said.Arjun managed to snap out of his reverie and looked back at Ty.The narrative being put out is that you abducted her.Of course.Einstein said something funny.The Cyc laughed and leaned into him affectionately.His arm found its way around her waist, the hand sliding down to the hip.Are those two ...Arjun began.Fucking?Not yet.But only because weve been on the run.The Diggers, from what intelligence weve been able to scrape together, believe in strict gender roles and ...Not fucking.Yeah.Ill talk to Einstein.Tell him to not fuck her.But you didnt ...Abduct her?No, she just tagged along.Sensing doubt, or at least curiosity, from the Ivyn, Ty continued: And more would do the same given the chance.The transition to surface life is putting their culture through a blender.Which is why their leaders are being so reactionary.Arjun nodded.And hows your Moiran?Ty sighed.She saw Doc and Memmie die, and suffered a blunt force trauma to her arm, and was forced to draw her kat, and to use it.As soon as it happened she went into what Im guessing is a classic POTESH.This was military jargon for post traumatic epigenetic shift.That is confirmed, said Hope, who seemed to have finished an initial scan of Kaths vital signs.Higher metabolism and hyperacute senses are observable.Her microbiome is a mess; Im tuning it up with probiotic supplements thatll be a better fit with her new phenotype.Suggested by the nausea are big hormone shifts.Possibly predictive of some future ...Testosterone poisoning?Ty suggested, finishing Hopes thought.Hope responded with a diffident nod of the head.Ty turned his attention back to Arjun.So three billion people just learned that the Diggers exist.How are they taking it?Well, obviously it is a sensational bit of news, Arjun said.People are intensely curious.He turned his head again to study Sonar Taxlaw.As am I.  I admit it.Does the general public know how badly the first contact went wrong?Ty asked.None of the identities of your Seven are public knowledge.Certainly no one has the faintest idea that Hu Noah had anything to do with it.So Red hasnt been trumpeting that.It wouldnt be to Reds advantage, as I see it, Arjun said.Now that they are allied with the Diggers, they want to make the Diggers out to be sympathetic.Revealing that they killed Hu Noah and his nurse would hardly serve that end.So we are just being made out to be some sort of anonymous thug squad.The Diggers chased us off with help from Red.We abducted a hostage as we were running away.Arjun looked him in the eye.No intelligent person in Blue believes that, of course.But Blue hasnt put out a countervailing narrative yet either.It isnt Blues strong suit.Arjun sighed.Never has been, right?Were technocrats.We make decisions like engineers.Which doesnt always line up with what people imagine they want.Are you speaking of Blue in general?Ty asked.Or Rio in particular?Using the name of the Ivyn central habitat as synecdoche for its culture.Both.A Blue mentality that places us at the top of the decision making pyramid.Theres a reason why the very few Adans who have become prominent in Blue have been musicians, actors, artists.Theyre supplying something our culture lacks, Ty said.You were supposed to supply it, Arjun said.Meaning, as Ty understood, the Dinan race.And you did, during the heroic age.Ty could feel a not altogether cheerful smile on his face.By actually doing things, you mean, he said, as opposed to pretending to do them in made up entertainment programs.You know what, though?Its all entertainment.Real or made up.Its stuff that people watch on screens or varps.Red gets that.Well, Ty said, maybe we can continue the discussion in my bar if we get out of this.But the bottom line for now, if Im hearing you right, is that, narrative wise, Red is killing us.We have been a little distracted, Arjun said, showing a bit of defensiveness for the first time.By what Red did, you mean, Ty said.He was referring to the insertion of the peloton, Marges glorious return, and the lovey dovey stuff between their delegation and the Diggers.Arjun did not out and out disagree, but the look on his face was a bit impatient, the smart teacher working with the slow pupil.More by what theyve been doing.For a while now.Well, Ty said, as a mere bartender, I wouldnt know about anything other than what is on the news feeds.So tell me.What have they been doing?What do you know about the Kulak?What any civilian lacking a security clearance would know, Ty answered carefully.People are assumed to be living in the fist part of it.Kulak was Russian for fist.In this context it denoted an irregular lump of nickel iron some thirty kilometers across.A hundred and fifty years ago, Red had moved it from the Kamchatka boneyard to a position above the Makassar Strait, where it had orbited ever since.Like a loosely clenched fist, it had a cavity down the middle, a tunnel now presumed to be lined with rotating habitats.Reds answer to the Great Chain.Then theres the rigging and spars whatnot surrounding that, Ty went on.For the fist, viewed from a distance, seemed to be tangled in a sparse web of cables, like a seed in a spiderweb.Above and belowto the nadir and zenith sidesthese converged on hard points to which the long cables extending down to Earths surface and up to the counterweightthe Antimakassarwere attached.Sonar Taxlaw, a few meters away, had been engaged in a public display of affection with Einstein, but withdrew slightly and turned her head to listen.Ty had grown accustomed to her ways.It was because he had said spars.That was between Sonar and Taxlaw in the Encyclopdia Britannica, and thus belonged to her domain of knowledge.During their hike over the mountains and down the other side, she had turned out to be well informed, at least by troglodyte standards, about space exploration and the sun.So it had been easy to bring her up to speed on the last five thousand years off planet developments.She now began to drift toward Ty.Einstein followed her as if his eyes were connected to her butt cheeks with fishhooks.Oblivious to all thisfor he had his back to itArjun was regarding him coolly, expecting more.Ty went on: The part on the surfacetheir answer to Cradlewe dont know much about.Theyve been building it under the sea.They call it the Gnomon, Arjun informed him.Then he spelled the word out.What does it mean?It used to be the thing that stood up in the middle of a sundial, to cast the shadow.Aligned with the Earths axis.Ty considered it.Interesting choice of words.Its big, Ty.Much bigger than Cradle.Theres a reason theyve been building it in the ocean.Partly to hide it from us.And partly because its too large to construct on terra firma.How big are we talking about exactly?There is only so much Im at liberty to say, Arjun said.Then he drew out a tablet and began tapping at it, pulling up a world map, panning and zooming toward the mess of islands between Southeast Asia and Australia.But just look at this and tell me what you see.He handed it to Ty.Southeast Asia!exclaimed the Cyc, who had drawn close enough to see all of this over Arjuns shoulder.Is there anything you would care to know of it?Or of Sulawesi?Or of Sri Lanka?The Ivyn regarded her with fascination.I dont need to look, Ty said.I know whats there.The equator runs through all of that and rarely crosses over the land, and Red never stops whining about it.Not true!Sumatra ...said the Cyc.A big island to be sure, Ty said, but not a continent.Do you remember, Sonar, what I told you about how the Eye works?What Cradle does?Touches the equator, she returned.And only the equator.Which is great if you control Africa and South America.Which Blue does.But most of Reds territory lies north or south of the line.Sonar wasnt going to be talked down so easily.Singapore is close, she said, and that is connected to Asia.The former location of Singapore is close, yes.But not on the equator.Its one or two degrees north.Cradle cant dock there.And that one detail, more than anything else, is what infuriated the Adans about the design of the Eye and Cradle, Arjun put in.Sensing Einstein behind her, the Cyc leaned comfortably back against him and started rattling off factsher default mode of social interaction.Adans, she said.The ABC hierarchy.Aretaics, Betas, Camites.Camites are a different race, Einstein reminded her.Oh yeah.The relationship of the A and the B to the C is more akin to Symbiosis.Ty and Einstein exchanged a wry look.Oblivious, Sonar Taxlaw gazed down the hill toward Langobard.Neoanders.And two more.The smart ones and the crazy ones.Jinns and Extats, Einstein said.They dont get out much.Arjuns fascination with seeing a rootstock human had given way to impatience.He focused on Ty again.This is old history, of course, he said, but never forgotten by some people.Way back when the Eye was being designedIm talking a thousand years agothere were alternative schemes proposed.The one we ended up with was simplest, easiest to build with what people had back then.The Eye, the Big Rock, and a small Cradle with sockets on the equator.Great for access to South America and Africa.Almost useless, however, in the stretch of the equator under the habitats where Adans, half of the Camites, and most of the Julians lived.What later became Red, Einstein put in, for Sonar Taxlaws benefit.One of the reasons Red later coalesced, and built such a strong counteridentity to Blue, was their sense of grievance over this decision.We should have waited, they said.We could have had something much more useful than Cradle.Arjun zoomed in on Indonesia and dragged out a skinny rectangle, straddling the equator and spanning most of Reds latitudes.If instead of Cradle we had made something in the shape of a long arc, spanning a greater distance north south, it might have connected with Asia down here, where Singapore used to be.And here it could touch the northern cape of New Guinea.And New Guinea could be connected to Australia by dropping enough rocks into the shallows between them.A long arc.Aligned with the Earths axis, casting a shadow on the ground, Ty said, nodding.A Gnomon.It would have to be huge!Einstein exclaimed.Arjun nodded.Plans for it were drawn up.Studies commissioned on how it might be constructed, in orbit or on the surface.It was deemed too ambitious.So wiser heads prevailed, said Arjun, or so it seemed at the time, and we built what we built.We can always make something bigger later, they said.But it didnt turn out that way.Blue forgot about it.Red didnt.Their Jinns put as much effort into thinking about it as our Ivyns put into epigenetics.As soon as they closed the border and put up the two turnpikes, they went to work.What have they been doing that whole time?Smiting the Torres Strait with an unceasing storm of bolides, said Sonar Taxlaw, pointing to the narrows where Australias northern cape almost poked New Guinea in the belly.Filling it in.Damming the currents.Making a wall against those that swim in the sea.Arjun nodded.Then his head snapped around to focus on the Cyc.He stared at her intently for a moment, then looked at Ty.Did you ...he began.Not a word, Ty said.Einstein, did you tell her about Reds illegal terraforming operation here?And he tapped the same place on the map.First Ive heard of it, Einstein said.Sonar, Arjun said, how did you know about that?The Pingers told us, Sonar said.Who the hell are the Pingers?The people we are going to talk to, Sonar said.Beled and Bard had been assisting the Teklan.Those three now approached, carrying the glider packs.They set them down and began camouflaging them under such foliage as was available in this place: scrubby brushes that had been socked into the brow of the slope to stabilize it and provide refuge for small animals.Ty got the feeling, from cues in the Teklans physique and general style of movement, that he was some manner of Snake Eater.When it became evident to the Teklan that the two larger men were better than he was at uprooting plants and moving dirt, this man left them to finish the task and approached.Tucked under his left arm was a container matching the general size and shape of those still used, in Chainhattan, to transport pizza.Dangling from that hand was a roughly cubical equipment case.With his free right hand he exchanged salutes with Ty and identified himself as one Roskos Yur.He then set the two parcels in front of Ty and backed away from them.Thank you, Ty said.Youre welcome, sir.Why, Arjun asked, did you want those?Do you have any idea what it cost to get them here?The Cyc can explain along the way, Ty said.Arjun held his gaze on Ty for a moment, then glanced away with a diffident nod.Roskos Yur, by contrast, looked hard at him, and wouldnt stop looking.After a few moments of this, Ty felt obliged to meet the Teklans eye.Now that Ty could scan this mans insignia more carefully, he could see that he was part of a unit stationed at Nunivak: one of the forward Blue outposts, right up against the border.It was a byword for remote and isolated.It made Qayaq seem like a metropolis.Full of Snake Eaters always being sent off on crazy missions.Thats not really what hes asking, sir, said Roskos Yur.Hes really asking, who the fuck are you?Sergeant Major Yur Arjun said, in a tone of protest.But Yur would not be stopped.And dont tell us youre a bartender, sir.The late Dr.Hu handpicked Mr.Lake for inclusion in the Seven, Arjun pointed out.And now hes ramrodding this Yur looked about at the group and gave out an incredulous snort.I dont even know how to describe it.Ragtag makes it sound like more than it is.He led them out of a difficult situation, Arjun said.A difficult situation for which hes partly responsible, sir, Yur shot back.And at the moment he knows more about the Diggers, and the situation on the ground, than anyone.I assume he requested those objects for a reason, which will be explained as we go.Ty held up a hand.Sergeant Major Yur doesnt trust me because my allegiance isnt clear to him.Fair enough.Yurs face softened a little, and his gaze flicked to one side for a moment.Taking advantage of this break in the staredown, Ty turned to face Esa Arjun.The Ivyn made the tiniest movement that was still recognizable as shaking his head no.Once he was certain that Ty had caught it, he looked at Roskos Yur.Sergeant Major, Arjun said quietly, there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy.Yur snorted.Is that a fancy way of saying its above my pay grade, sir?Yes.I just want to know if its some kind of fucking dukh shit, sir.Oh, is that all?Ty asked.Why didnt you say so?No, Arjun said, the tension suddenly gone from his voice.Theres no dukh involved.Because that bar he works for Its not connected with any established kupol.Then who the hell is it connected with, sir?Yur demanded.I made some inquiries with friends of mine in intel.That bar makes no fucking sense as a business proposition.Its ownership structure is ...unusual.Connections to Red, Im told.One of the Owners happens to be of part Adan ancestry, Ty admitted, but be careful of making unwarranted assumptions about where his loyalties lie.Does this have something to do with the Purpose?Roskos Yur demanded.Neither Ty nor Arjun answered.After a few moments of this silence, Yur heaved a sigh, then continued in a more moderate tone: Never mind.I see it now.Its some kind of Purpose thing.Above my pay grade.You should have just told me.He drew himself up and saluted.What are my orders, sir?We march to the sea, Ty said, following the Cycs directions.And moving as fast as we can.Complicating matters is that our Moiran may have to be carried.Actually, said Langobard, who had been loping in their direction and was now in earshot, we may have to work rather hard to keep up with her.He extended one long arm, pointing down the slope of the meadow.The first thing they all saw was the huge form of Beled, charging downhill at the near sprint that, as they all knew, he could maintain for hours.Far ahead of him, then, they saw Kath Amalthova Three, moving even faster.HOPES DRUGS AND PROBIOTICS HAD SETTLED KATHREES MOOD A bit and reduced the nausea to the point where she could almost ignore it.This had been resolving on its own, but she was glad of any pharmaceutical assistance she could get; her body had become ravenous and she needed to keep her food down.But the most important drug in her system right nowso important that Hope had strapped a little pump to Kathrees arm, the better to keep dribbling it inwas one designed to home in on her amygdala and put the brakes on any slow neurological train wreck that might be under way there in reaction to the trauma she had seen four days ago.As such it was reaching her brain a few days too latebut apparently it was one of those better late than never things.It might help interrupt a vicious cycle in which her brain would keep replaying that little horror movie over and over, deepening the damage a little bit each time.The fact that shed spent so much time asleep might also be helping her in that regard.Some tangible and biologically measurable benefit might have accrued to her as a result of having spent most of that time physically strapped to Beled, her cheek on his shoulder, all but sucking him into her nostrils.For his part the Teklan had shown no particular reaction to having an indolent, vomit scented coma patient on his back during the day, and curled up against his belly during the night.The two of them had still never had sex, but she feared now that once she was cleaned up and feeling better she would be on him like a succubus.It was a well known POTESH symptom, which had produced colorful and legendary results in Moiran communities that had survived collective trauma.But since having rampant sex with everything that moved wasnt really an option today, she sought other outlets for her surging physical energy.The hike from the meadow down to the sea was longer than it had appeared and she ended up ranging far in front of the others, obliging Beled to push himself hard just to keep her in sight.She could not see him because he was behind her, but she could sense his footfalls through the ground.She could hear his breathing and the faint clicking of the ambots that he carried on his person, and when the wind was from behind she could smell the institutional wipes that he had been using for hygiene, and the detergent that had been used to clean his uniform, the lubricant in his kat, his most recent meal.Her ranging so far out in front of the others was partly a way to burn off a physical energy that threatened to make her crazy but as much an effort to get into a place where she was not taking in an equal amount of sensory data from everyone in the group.One was enough.She stormed through a hedge of whippy plants that had been seeded in a dune above the beach and broke out onto the wet sand.Waves were breaking half a kilometer out and washing up toward her in fizzing sheets.The smell in her nostrils spoke of an incalculable density of marine life, akin to what she had scented when she had stood on the top of the bridge in Cradle, but much more finely resolved now.This despite the chemically induced suppression of her amygdala.Without Hopes drugs in her system she might have spiraled into a sort of panic attack.As it was she felt her body overheating and looked down at her bare arms as if expecting them to crack open like sausages on a grill.Dropping from a run to a stride, she marched straight down the beach peeling off clothes as she went and depositing them in a ragged career over her footprints.Soon, but not soon enough, the surf was washing her ankles, then her shins.She dropped to her knees and let herself topple forward into an onrushing wave that caught her fall and let her down easy.Naked, she was floating facedown in the water, whose icy cold only made the exposed parts of her skinbuttocks and shoulder bladesfeel as if they were under a broiler.Pressed for a rational explanation of why she was lying facedown in the Pacific, eyes open, gazing at a starfish, she could not have answered.But it was having an effect.Her heart, which had been thumping out of control, dropped to something much closer to a normal rate, and a surprising amount of time passed before she felt obliged to plant her hands and knees in the sand, push herself up on all fours, and suck in a breath of air.She got her legs under her and squatted, then pivoted so that her back was to the sea.Her legs and buttocks were still submerged, cooling off from the run.Beled Tomov was standing a few meters away, surf washing around his ankles, breathing heavily, looking as though a dip in the icy Pacific might do him some good.But this was not his intent.He had been ready to pull Kathree out if she had gone too long without breathing.They looked at each other, Kathrees gaze saying I would do you right now, right here and his saying I know and hers saying I know that you know.Did you hear anything?he asked.That was unexpected.Just now, he explained, when your head was under.You mean, in the water?Yes.Like what?You havent been listening, have you?Are you kidding?Ive been listening so hard its driving me out of my mind.To the conversation, I mean.No.Everyone talks too loud.He considered it.Then he turned a little to one side and stretched out one arm, drawing her attention to a rocky headland that interrupted the beach a few hundred meters away.There, he said.The thermal spike in her body had finally subsided, so she pulled her clothes back on and they walked along the beach toward the headland: an abrupt, almost artificial looking rampart of shattered rock, held together by the roots of trees and scrub.It divided the beach like the blade of a shovel.She did not even know why they had been going to the sea.Was someone going to pick them up there?Was there even a plan?Or had they simply run away until they could run no farther?The Diggers believe, Beled said, in the existence of people who live beneath the sea.The Pingers.Supposedly there have been contacts.At specific places along the coast of Beringia.He nodded in the direction they were going.As in face to face contacts?Beled shrugged: a movement that, given the size of his shoulders, could almost be picked up on a seismograph.I fancied you might have heard something while your head was under the water, he said.They use a tech called sonar.Her disordered brain was a little while putting this all together.She knew a little about sonar.Survey used it to map the bottoms of lakes and to count fish.No coincidence that we are traveling with someone of that name?Beled nodded.She has been telling us about them, but much of it sounds more legend than fact.Where do they live?Submarines?He shrugged again.No one seems to know.Apparently they are good at holding their breath.The headland could not be skirted without a boat.They ended up cutting back inland so that they could get past it.This required gaining a couple of hundred meters in altitude and bushwhacking through vegetation that had grown thick on the south facing slope.When they reached a place from which they could look down toward the sea, it became obvious that they were on the edge of an impact crater a kilometer or so in diameter.The headland that had blocked their passage down the beach was part of its rim; this curved out into the Pacific, forming one side of a bay.A mirror image of it, as they could now see, formed the opposite side.The bolide that had formed the crater had struck very close to the shore.The central impact peak was a sharp rocky islet just a stones toss from the beach, precisely centered between the twin headlands.It was easy enough for the eye to fill in the missing shape of the rim.Out in the water between the headlands, it must be slung in a submerged arc.And indeed it was possible to see waves breaking as they tripped over it.On the landward side, the rim blended into the natural slope.The impact had hollowed out a bowl whose steepness now forced Beled and Kathree to make an awkward, skidding descent into the cove below.The beach there was more rocky than sandy, and many of the rocks had the translucency of wave worn beach glass.They could hear the remainder of the party on the slope high above, catching up with them.The middle of the beachjust opposite the sharp little islandseemed like the natural place to make camp.A little heap of glassy stones had been made therejust big enough to make it clear that this was no natural deposit, but an intentional act.Their signal, Beled explained.We should build a fire now.He began ranging along the beach picking up driftwood.Kathree, drawn somehow by the cairn, squatted there to wait for the others.She could hear Sonar Taxlaw chattering as she negotiated the slope above, running circles around the others, whose footfalls and breathing were audible.Their history is divided into three Deluges.The First Deluge was of rock and fire.It chased them into the deepest trenches of the sea, where it never fully dried out, even after the rest of the oceans had boiled off.They bred a race capable of living in confined spaces.The Second Deluge was of ice and water.The Cloudy Century!Einstein said.Yes, when you dropped comets on them for hundreds of years.They noticed that seas were expanding, growing away from the trenches where they had been holed up, expanding their range.They transformed themselves into a race that could swim in the sea.When you say they transformed themselves, asked Arjun, do you mean genetic engineering or Selective breeding, Sonar insisted.If wolves could become poodles in a few thousand years, think what humans could turn into, if there was a need!They began to explore the seafloor.They found a lot of industrial junk that had been washed into the oceans during the Hard Rain and sunk to the bottom.There is nothing of metallurgy that is a mystery to them.Which is why you trade with them?Ty ventured.Because you are short on metal?And they are short on things we have, Sonar affirmed.You said there were three Deluges, Einstein reminded her.The Third Deluge?Is now, said the Cyc.A Deluge of life, beginning with microorganisms and culminating with you.Meaning, the Spacers, Ty guessed.Yes.And the only Spacers they know about are the ones who dropped a lot of rocks into the Torres Strait and built the thing at Makassar.How is all of this being imparted to you?asked Arjun.Imparted?Have you, Sonar, actually had face to face conversations with Pingers?Me personally?!she asked, sounding amazed and horrified by the very idea.Oh no, just looked down on them from up here.So you lurk up above while more senior members of your clan go down to the beach and talk to the Pingers.Talking is difficult.Communication is mostly through the written word.They didnt have paper until we gave them some of ours.We use slates and chalk.Kathrees eye went to a detail she had noticed a minute ago: an unnatural looking deposit of flat black rocks half buried in wave driven sand.As the remainder of the party made their final descent to the waters edge, she used a piece of driftwood to scrape sand and gravel away from these until she could worry one loose.Though it was rough around the edges, it had clearly been shaped by humans: a slab of black rock about as thick as her finger, big enough to hold in the crook of an arm, smooth enough to write on.Scattered in the muck around it shed seen lumps of calcium carbonate: chalk.Traces of it were still visible on the slates.Not writing but a fragment of a diagram, a map perhaps, and a few numbers.PROJECTING FROM ONE SIDE OF THE ISLET, JUST BELOW THE TOP OF it, was a snarl of driftwood: the stump of a tree that a storm had torn from the edge of a cliff somewhere along the coast and later hurled up here.As soon as he arrived, Ty dropped his pack, emptied his pockets, and picked up the boxy equipment case that Roskos Yur had delivered in his glider.Holding this up above his head to keep it dry, he waded out to the islet, cursing at the intensity of the cold.At its deepest, the water came up to his waist, with occasional waves clipping him under the chin.He tossed the case up onto the flank of the islet and then clambered up after it.After gazing curiously at the stump for some moments, he squatted down, gripped it by a couple of protruding roots, and overturned it, causing it to tumble into the surf.He then edged back out of the others sight line to reveal what had been hidden beneath it: a vertical section of stout steel pipe, about a hands breadth in diameter, rising to the height of a persons knee, topped with a flat disk of battered steel the size of a dinner plate.The pipe wasnt rooted to the boulder itself.It was part of a longer object that extended out into the sea.The part above the waterline was lashed to spikes that had been driven into crevices in the rock, in a style that they had already learned to recognize as typical Digger improvisation.Tys attention strayed to something he had noticed at his feet.He bent down and heaved it up so that all on the beach could see it: a sledgehammer improvised from a length of pipe and a chunk of steel.Then he looked at the Cyc.Looking back at Ty she held her hands out, palms toward the gray sky, as if to say: See?Just like I said.Ty turned away from them, gazing down into the sea before the boulder.After a few moments he turned back around.How far does it extend?he shouted.The pipe?A few score yards, answered the Cyc.The crater is as a horn, channeling the sound out into the deep.She had scarcely finished the sentence before Ty hauled off with the sledgehammer and brought it down with all his might on the steel plate.The result was a blindingly loud metallic ping, drowned out, as it faded, by a scream from Kathree, who sank to her knees in the sand with her hands clamped over her head.Better get her out of here, Ty saidshe could hear him through her hands.She felt Beled reaching around her from behind, crooking her in one arm below her breasts, heaving her to her feet.Which was welcome on one level.But she was tired of being the one who had to be carried, and so she unwound herself from him, turned her back on the sea, and marched up toward the belt of scrub that marked the limit of the beach.Ty gave her a respectable head start before shouting, Plug your ears.She did so, and a moment later felt another ping go through her like an icicle jammed into the base of her skull.A moment later came another and another, not in a steady rhythm, but sporadic.And by the time she had climbed up to a place where she could look down over the cove, fingers in her ears, and not suffer pain from each stroke of the hammer, she had made sense of what Ty was doing.Each of the human races had its own set of cultural traditions that it traced back to its respective Eve.These were propagated from one generation to the next by social rituals, school curricula, and youth groups.Young Teklans learned zero gravity gymnastics with a martial arts flair, competing on obstacle courses that reproduced specific maneuvers that Tekla had performed during the Epic.Julians competed on debate teams and went on lengthy retreats intended to symbolize their Eves exile and ordeal in the Swarm.And so on.Young Dinans learned Morse code.It was used very rarely.Moirans most certainly didnt learn it, and so Kathree had no idea what message Tyuratam Lake was banging out into the deep.Everyone, of course, had watched the scene in the Epic, at the beginning of the Hard Rain, where Eve Dinah had made her final transmission to Rufus.This had trailed off with many repetitions of the code QRT, whichespecially after Dinah had dissolved in sobs, and slowed her transmission speed to a crawlhad a kind of solemn fanfare like rhythm to it, beginning with pahm, pahm, pa pahm.The letter Q.  Kathree recognized that pattern, at least, more frequently than you would expect in normal English sentences.So, Ty was using ancient Q codes to shorten his message.But she hadnt a clue what he was actually saying.He belted it out over and over again, a syncopated phrase of long and short strokes that started to get under her skin after a while.He stopped when Sonar Taxlaw waded out to the rock and assured him that, if the Pingers were about, they would surely have heard the message by now.How long now?he asked.He was shouting over the rush of the surf and because he had probably gone deaf.Depends on how far away they are, said Sonar Taxlaw.Maybe a day.Maybe three.Great, Ty said, and looked up to catch the eye of Roskos Yur, who, following a timeless military instinct, pushed his sleeve back to check his timepiece.Ty unlatched the lid of the box and began to take out pieces of equipment and to peruse instructional brochures.Kathree was too far away to see the details, and in any case it was getting dark.As the sky faded, she could see Ty sitting on the shore of the islet, facing out toward the sea, occasionally flicking on a small light and fussing with equipment.Perched next to him, swaddled in sleeping bags that Einstein had brought out to her, was the Cyc.She wore a bulky pair of headphones, occasionally turning her head toward Ty in an alert birdlike way to make some sort of comment.Esa Arjun paced slowly back and forth on the beach, just out of the waves reach, passing occasionally near Einstein, who just stood there gazing fretfully at his beloved.Hope had gone to ground in a small tent pitched a few meters higher up, on drier sand; a bluish flicker through its walls suggested he was working with a tablet, maybe trying to learn something about POTESH management.So much for the lower camp where Hope, Ty, Einstein, Sonar Taxlaw, and Arjun had made themselves at home.Beled had followed Kathree uphill.Langobard and Roskos Yur later followed him.Spreading out, bushwhacking in all directions, they identified a curved brow in the slope: the line of demarcation between the craters inland edge and the preexisting landscape from which it had been blasted.Above it, the slope was much gentler.Indeed, the first thing one saw upon cresting the rim was a slight drop in altitude.Before them, as they stood with their backs to the sea and their faces to the mountains, was a bog a few hundred meters in extent, with a pine forest rising up on its far side.They backpedaled a few paces and set to work establishing an upper camp just below the summit of the rim.Few words were spoken, but it was obvious that its purpose was to defend the beach if and when Red forces approached.If the foe came straight down out of the mountains, they would have to cross the bog.If they came along the beach, they would have to scale or circumvent a prong of the craters rim.Either way, they would be clearly visible from this vantage point.It could be guessed that an ONAN had struck the ground somewhere nearby, several decades ago.Seed packed siwis had slithered out of it, roaming about, mapping elevations and soil moisture, comparing notes over a mesh network.The collective had noticed the break in the slope leading down to the sea.Following a program drilled into it by some coder up on the ring, it had decided that the coastline might be stabilized here by planting some seeds that would grow up into tough, low, scrubby vegetation.And so it had all come to pass.Siwis that happened to wander away from the beach had found the flat ground beyond the rim and planted it with different species that would thrive in a wet environment.The vegetation had created a bit of a natural dam, holding back water coming down out of the mountains above them.One day it might be a lake, but for now it was a black bog, squishy and knee deep and screened with grasses and reeds that favored that sort of ground.Kath Two had not been a fighter.Her weapons training had given her the bare minimum of skill needed to discharge a katapult in the direction of a hungry canid.Kathree didnt know, yet, whether that was one of the things that had shifted.In a sense it did not matter.No matter how good she might turn out to be at combat, she would never be as effective as Beled, Bard, andjudging from appearancesRoskos Yur.She was, however, finding them to be a dull, slow bunch.They failed to notice much that was obvious to her.And it was clear that they were tired and fading toward sleep.After it had gotten fully dark, Kathree consumed three consecutive full meals from the rations that Roskos Yur had brought with him, then slipped away and climbed a short distance farther up, to the very top of the rim, from which she could look and listen inland.When she returned, she startled Roskos Yur, whose steady breathing had been audible from a thousand paces away.Hed been asleep, or close to it.You should warn me when you are approaching, Kath Two!he hissed.Shes dead.Kath Three, then.No one is coming, she said, at least not for a few hours.Not unless they drop from the sky, he retorted.Langobard, ever sociable, had approached.They will not come by air, he said.If they can take us out quietly, they will do soand never say a word of it.But to make a full assault?That would clash with the narrative that they are building for the consumption of the people of the ring.When are we going to begin writing our own fucking narrative?Yur said.And there the conversation stalled.But his question was answered an hour later when Kathree, then the rest of them, discerned a whine and a rumble coming from the direction of the water.Running lights appeared over the horizon, coming from the south over the limit of the world, but then winked out as the pilot made the decision to run dark.It was clear from the sound, and from the way it hugged the water, that this thing was neither an airplane nor a ship but the in between thing known as an ark.They heard it sough into the water a kilometer away and switch over to the chugging engines it used to maneuver on the surface.It dropped anchor several hundred meters offshore: well away from the land, so as to respect the hair trigger sensibilities of the Diggers, but close enough that people and gear could be ferried to and fro on small boats.It opened its big rear cargo ramp, allowing the sea to flood its interior and float a collection of small boats and barges that had been packed aboard.On one of these, a small party came ashore.Kathree heard them conversing, mostly with Ty and Arjun, though Einstein as usual found a way to make himself part of the action.A barge from the ark had been towed into the open water between it and the shore, and anchored.The sounds coming from it spoke of complex mechanical internals.After a few minutes it began to rumble and hum, and a fountain of glittering flynk chain, an upside down U, grew out of its top and began to extend skyward as its velocity built and its sound sharpened into a steady keening note.Within a few minutes the aitrain had elevated to a height of perhaps a hundred meters and begun to give off a soft light, filling the cove and the beach with enough illumination for people to move about easily and read documents.Kathree could now read the name of the ark, blazoned on its fuselage near the nose: Darwin.It must have been sent out from a big TerReForm basemost likely Haida, which served the northern Pacific coast.The aitrain that they had deployed on the barge was a common enough military device.As such it was probably radiating in other wavelengths besides just visible light.It was a sort of all in one communications hub that was interconnecting everything that had line of sight to it, as well as uplinking to Denali and other installations in the ring.Sleep was now out of the question for Kathree, and so she made her way down the crater to the beach.When she emerged from the brush she discovered Einstein and the Cyc, standing next to each other in a crossfire of lights, facing a camera.To one side, sorting through notes, was a new arrival, a tall Moiran woman with the posture, the self possession, and the golden eyes of a fashion model.She wore clothing suited for the chilly, damp coast of Beringia.It hung on her slender but strong frame in a way that suggested it had been made for her, probably by a clever designer on the Great Chain.Kathree didnt have to get any closer to understand what was happening: the tall Moiran woman was producing just what Roskos Yur had asked for.She began by talking directly into a camera for some time, then interviewed Einstein and the Cyc.It was all being beamed live to the ring.Kathree sat alone on the beach, hugging her knees and watching the woman do what she did and wondering what events in her life had caused her to shift into what she was now, so tall, so lovely, so watchable.She did not have the manner of one who had been born beautiful, which made Kathree suspect that she had come by it through some kind of personal disaster.After she was finished doing her interviews, she shut down the lights and the cameras, approached Esa Arjun, and stood face to face with him for a while, just talking.Both of them had put on varps and Kathree got the idea that they were conversing about whatever it was that the devices were projecting into their eyes.Kathree became certain that Kath Two had seen the woman broadcasting from trouble spots around the ring: habitats where general strikes or civil disorder had gotten out of hand, where Quarantine Enforcement or police had been called in to break things and hurt people.The mere fact that Kathree was sitting still long enough to make such observations and to string such thoughts together was indicative of a coming crashthe inevitable result of how she had spent most of the day.It was about halfway between midnight and dawn, and Kathree felt herself plummeting toward sleep with the same power and inevitability as Endurance diving into her final pass through perigee.Instead of which she found herself gazing at, and being gazed at by, the tall Moiran woman, who had silently drawn almost to within arms length of her.Kathree jumped to her feet and nearly fell over.Kath Amalthova Three, the woman said, I am Cantabrigia Barth Five.Five.Wow.You must have seen some crazy shit, Kathree said.I hope for your sake you have taken a set in your current form.Cantabrigia Five made a tiny movement of her golden eyes, by way of acknowledging the remark, but let it pass without comment.I am what amounts to the commanding officer here, she said.It was neither the craziest nor the least crazy thing Kathree had heard lately, so she took it impassively.By outward appearances, Cantabrigia Five was a video journalist.But it made sense that, in a world where no police or military action could be judged successful unless it looked good to ordinary persons watching it on video screens, she was also a general.Arjun had approached from behind Cantabrigia Five and now took up a position just to one side, peering over her right shoulder.He caught Kathrees eye briefly and nodded.Over the wireless, said Cantabrigia Five, I just now spoke to Sergeant Major Yur and Lieutenant Tomov and Langobard, and gave them their instructions.These are yours.A small Red military force is approaching.They are still some hours away.We have intelligence that they are being guided this way by two Diggers familiar with the route.When they get here, there may or may not be a fight.If there is, do not enter into it directly.Stay clear of our buckies.Look for the Diggers.If you can prevent them from doing harm, by all means do so.But dead Diggers on a video screen is a thing we cannot afford.Kathree nodded.I understand.Arjun apparently felt that some explanation was required.We dont know when, or if, the Pingers will show up.So we need to buy time.Okay, Kathree said.What are we hoping to buy it with?The look on Arjuns face suggested that the question had been impertinent.But Cantabrigia Five responded by reaching up to remove the varp she had perched atop her head.She swept it off and handed it to Kathree, who arranged it carefully on her own face.The fit was imperfect and so she had to hold it in position with one hand to get the right focus.Youll want the sound track, said Cantabrigia Five.Its just not the same otherwise.Sound track?Kathree said.But a faint shift in the set of Cantabrigia Fives face hinted that some deadpan humor was at work and that she should just play along.Groping along the sides of her head, she found the earbuds and flipped them down into position.The varp was causing her to see a number of imaginary objects, most of which were grayed and/or blurredit had figured out that Kathree was not its owner and so it had disabled anything personal or private.Hanging in space between her and Arjun, however, was a softly glowing red token having the apparent size of a table tennis ball, with a dimple in one side.He reached out and gave this a light tap and it flew in her direction.Be my guest, he said.She caught it in her hand and put her thumb into the dimple, then swooped it around in a big oval in front of her face.This caused a flat screen to make itself visible.She then drew the red ball toward her, sweeping the screen through a third dimension to define a volume about the size of a laundry basket.Cantabrigia Five hadnt been kidding about the sound track.It was a full orchestra, comprising some instruments that would have been familiar to Mozart and others that had been invented thousands of years after Zero.It, and a large choir, poured a three dimensional ocean of sound into her ears, performing the Red national anthem.Not the peppy, truncated version heard at sporting events but the symphonic arrangement, calculated to make people sit still and be awed.A nickel iron fist seemed to be hanging in the volume of space she had just swept out above the beach.The Kulak.Stout spars jutted from it here and there: anchor points for hair thin lines of rigging that extended in various directions, seeming to disappear in the vast distance.Moving carefully lest she turn an ankle on a cobble, Kathree circled around it until she could peer down the hole in the center.There, she saw movement: rings of light, each of them similar to the Great Chain, stacked up the interior, each spinning at a different rate, but all protected within the lumpy shell of the asteroid, many kilometers thick.This triggered a programmed camera movement that took her by surprise and obliged her to plant her feet and steady herself by laying a hand on Cantabrigia Fives forearm.The povv, or point of virtual view, took a slow dive down the center of the Kulak, which had now expanded far beyond the basket sized volume to surround her.She could not control the speed of the movement but she could gaze in all directions and see through the glass roofs of the ring shaped cities, picking out green fields where youngsters were kicking balls, blue ponds around which lovers strolled hand in hand, bustling high rise districts, residential utopias, cozy schools, and military bases where Betas and Neoanders practiced martial arts and marksmanship under the billowing red flag.Is this all real, or A mix, said Arjun, of stuff theyve actually built and renderings of what they imagine.And has this actually been made public or Broadcast six hours ago, he said.It is a huge reveal.Never before had Red divulged any picturesreal or imaginedof the inside of the Kulak.By now the fly through had reached the far end, and she could see space opening up around her as the povv exited from the Kulaks maw.The familiar sight of the habitat ring became visible, sweeping around in both directions to enclose the blue Earth in its jeweled embrace.From the system of rigging woven around the iron fist, a cable descended straight to the equator.Slowly at first, then building speed, the povv descended, achieving in a few seconds what would have taken several days in any kind of realistic elevator.Even through a screen of bright clouds Kathree could pick out the complex landforms of Southeast Asia to the north and, to the south, the huge dun slab of Australia, now joined to New Guinea by a lumpy gray green tendril.The povv chose to zoom down on that first, coming close enough that it became possible to see a road traversing the land bridge.Then it veered and banked onto a northwesterly course, following the green, steaming spine of New Guinea to the cape at its end, where it nearly touched the equator.There, construction was visible: cleared land, buildings, excavations, a hazy web of infrastructure, glimpsed but not lingered on.The povv soared out over a turquoise sea cluttered with landforms she recognized vaguely from having seen them on maps.But after a few moments her eye was drawn to something that was flagrantly unnatural, looking as if it had been drawn in with a ruler and a pencil: the tether from the Kulak, plunging vertically into the ocean between two big islands.These, she realized, had to be Borneo and Sulawesi, and the water between them the Makassar Strait.The povvs movement slowed, then stopped.The symphony and the choir were laboring through a slow crescendo.A change, more felt than seen, came over the display: the programmed camera movement was finished and the varp was now responding once again to Kathrees movements.Like a giantess bestriding the strait, she could move around and look at it from different angles.For a moment nothing really happened.Then her eye picked up turbulence in the sea, around where the tether stabbed into it.The surface was welling up and foaming.The tiny wrinkles of normal surface waves were erased, replaced by vast green whorls and galactic arms of swirling foam.Bending forward she saw angry gulls wheeling about.That detail convinced her that what she was seeing was realnot a rendering.The disturbed region grew north and south, spreading away from the cablewhich she knew to be on the equatorwithout growing east west.The cable forked, then forked again, becoming a fan that broadened north and south to support the full length of whatever was roiling the strait.It erupted from the surface first at the equator, then proceeded to rip a gash in the sea that spread up and down the meridian with immense velocity.The object could hardly be observed at first for all the water draining from it, plunging in multiple Niagaras back into the sea and hurling up a storm front of spray that rose higher than the structure itself.But in a minute the Gnomon became visible.Kathree had to back away to get a picture of the whole length of it.She extended her left hand and made a counterclockwise knob twiddling gesture, reducing the volume of the Kyoto Philharmonics brass section before the bass trombones and kettledrums imploded her skull.If the designers of the Gnomon had intended to make the anti Cradle, they could hardly have done better.It had the long wicked curve of a katanathe better to follow the curvature of the Earthcombined with the translucent delicacy of an insects exoskeleton.Indeed, it seemed to be unfolding, reshaping itself as it rose into the air, an origami praying mantis molting into a larger body.Its manifold corrugations and arching carapaces spoke of a million Jinns toiling in cubicles for centuries to build the strongest thing they could imagine with minimum weight.Whats it made of?Carbon and magnesium, mostly, said Arjun.Two light, strong materials that can be extracted from ocean sediments.Is that how they did it?Yes, said Cantabrigia Five.Energy intensive, Arjun remarked.They ran power down the tether to a production facility on the ocean floor.They had workers living on the ocean floor?Robots.And therein lies an opportunity, said Cantabrigia Five.The producers of this spectacle had once again seized control of the povv and begun taking Kathree on a forced march up the length of the Gnomon, slowing down to linger on the good bits and zooming past what was repetitive.She got the idea, which was that it had a sort of carriage that could move north south on a giant rail and connect with the ground along a range of latitudes.That it had its own internal train lines connecting residential pods, military installations, luxury resorts for the whole family, and so much more.It was obviously renderedstuff that hadnt actually been built yet.Her inability to control what the povv was doing made her a little queasy.She levered the earbuds up, closed her eyes, and carefully pulled the varp away from her face.Then she opened her eyes on reality: the beach, the islet, her two interlocutors.She handed the varp back.What sort of opportunity?If you are going to make first contact with an intelligent alien race, said Cantabrigia Five, dropping huge strip mining robots into their homeland might not be your best move.Kathree pondered that one for a bit.Ah, she said.Yes.So theres a reason they were so keen to make nice with the Diggers.Having fucked it up spectacularly with the Pingers.Yes.Cantabrigia Five stared at her for a little while.Her silence and her gaze were impressive, yet Kathree did not feel wholly uncomfortable.Finally she went on: Actions taken here today will cast long shadows into the future of New Earth.With more resources here, we might have effected a more elaborate strategy, with less uncertainty.But the mere fact of having had more would have spoiled it.HOW DID YOU GUYS COME UP WITH ALL THIS?TY ASKED.He was squatting on the islet next to the Cyc, who was still swaddled in sleeping bags, only her hands and head exposed.She was holding an instruction manual, angling it toward the light of the flynk chain.This was still illuminating the cove, but the crew of Ark Darwin had dimmed it so that people could sleep.She had to focus intensely to read the words, many of which must be unfamiliar to her.Her  lips moved slightly as she parsed unfamiliar Cyrillic characters sprinkled through almost every word.Headphones buried her ears in great donuts of foam.She hadnt heard Ty, didnt know he was looking at her.So he had his fill of looking for a minute.She wasnt his type, and anyway she was very young.But he was beginning to see what Einstein saw in her.Einstein had to know that there was nobody for him on his RIZ, no Indigen girl he could have an interesting conversation with.And yet if he were to somehow find his way to the habitat ring, hed be looked on by all the smart girls there as a hillbilly.The device in the box was a portable sonar rig.It was capable of sending out pings, but that wasnt how they were using it.They were using it to listen.Sonar Taxlaw had virtually wrenched it from Tys grasp and mastered it.The arrival of Ark Darwin and the movements of the boats and the barge had caused her no end of annoyance, but with a little encouragement from Ty, shed begun to see it as an interesting science experiment, a way of understanding what those technologies must sound like to Pingers and other mammals that frequented the deep.Moving carefully on the steep, glassy surface of the islet, he edged into her peripheral vision and gave her a light tap on the shoulder.He hated to break her out of her reverie, but there were questions he needed answered.She was stunned for a moment, as if shed just been teleported into this location from a thousand miles away, but rapidly she came around and pulled one of the headphones away from her ear.Come again?All of this.Ty rested a hand on the battered plate atop the pipe, nodded toward the makeshift sledgehammer.How did you come up with it?How do the Pingers know that when they want to talk to you they should build a cairn on the beach at such and such place?We began sending out scout parties as soon as the atmosphere became breathable, Sonar said.Thatd be three hundred years ago, Ty said.Two hundred and eighty two.Just making the point that this is old history.Not that old.Ty heaved a sigh.Not within living memory.It is not merely an oral tradition, if thats what youre getting at, Sonar said.We maintain written records.On one hundred percent cotton paper.Yes.Go on.There was nothing for the scouts to eat, of course.So they could only range as far as they could go with food that they carried on their backs.But in time they discovered edible seaweed and bivalves along the coast.Ty nodded.Once TerReForms engineered algae had done its job of building the atmosphere, it needed to be held in check.TerReForm seeded the coasts with filter feeders and the oceans with krill.Those clams were the first meat anyone had eaten in forty seven hundred years, said the Cyc.Scout parties that hugged the coast could stay out as long as they wanted, and roam for months or years, eating better than the Diggers who stayed in the Hole.Being a scout must have been popular.Too popular.Some went rogue, and had to be hunted down and subjected to the discipline of the Committee.That sounds ...unpleasant.It was not a good time.A lot of what you see that is bad in our culture started in those years.Anyway, the scouts would emerge from the Hole, said Ty, and make a beeline for the nearest coast.Exactly, and this route we have been traveling is like a game trail for uswe know it backwards and forwards.Well, at some point, after discipline had been reestablished, a scout party was exploring the coast a few kilometers from here, making camp up in the trees.One of them looked down and saw a person just walk up out of the sea.This person carried a little shovel like you might use to dig clams, and had a basket, but no clothes.He or she dug some clams and tossed them into the basket and then strolled back down into the ocean and disappeared.No scuba gear.No wet suit.Correct, just a belt with a knife.Well, word of this got back to the Hole and they talked to a predecessor of mine.A previous Sonar Taxlaw, you mean.Yes.A scout party went back down to the same place the next year and set up a contraption like this one, except not as good, and used it to send signals out into the deep.Nothing.Years, then decades went by.All they had to go on was the one sighting.Some old Digger who had been on a lot of scouting parties came up with the idea of building a bigger and better noisemaker herehe reckoned that the shape of the crater would act as a horn, channeling the sound outwards.To make a long story short, it worked.Contact was made.How recently?About fifty years, Sonar said.Then it was broken off around the time that you had your war.Five years ago, though, we began to see cairns.KATHREE WAS AWAKENED MUCH AS KATH TWO HAD BEEN ON THE morning when she had seen the Digger from her glider: by a certainty that something was out there, supported by no real evidence.This time, she was responding to sound: something shed heard while still asleep, accessible only through a memory that eluded her the harder she reached for it.She rolled over onto her belly, propped herself up on her elbows, aimed her face uphill, closed her eyes, opened her mouth, and froze.For the first few minutes she wasnt trying to hear anything, just taking in the ambient soundscape so that she could detect any noises that did not belong in it.The flynk chain on that barge was still operating, producing a steady note that could be filtered out by the minds neural circuitry.She was aware that Bard too had suddenly become very quiet, but she didnt know whether he had heard something or was simply following her cue.Kath Two might have been bookish and unobtrusive, but Kathree was the sort of person who kept nearby men on their toes.She heard it again: the same sound that had probably awakened her in the first place.And this time she knew what it was: hand forged steel arrowheads clinking faintly in a quiver, like coins in a pocket.The dilemma of the Digger hunter being that those shafts had to be held loosely enough to be fluidly drawn and nocked, but not so loosely that they jangled with each footfall.In measured strides across level ground, their kit might make no noise, but in a breathless predawn descent of an uneven slope, things might work themselves loose.As that aural picture sharpened in her mind, she could sense footfalls too, and hear bodies pushing through brush.The party, she guessed, was more numerous than the jangling quivers.Another Kath Two memory connected: preparing for Survey work in areas with a lot of Indigens, she had read ancient histories of the American West, where white men had made use of aborigines as scouts and guides.Langobard was hearing things too now, and had begun knuckle walking along the little picket line that they had established below the rim of the crater, quietly waking Roskos Yur and Beled Tomov.Kathree followed him, going to each man in turn and saying in a low voice: Maybe two Diggers with bows and arrows, guiding a small unit of Neoanders.How small?Beled asked.Probably not a full peloton.I will guess it is half of the group we observed landing.Go and notify Ty, Beled said.Tell him to turn the light on.And since it was too dark to see anything, he put a hand on the top of her shoulder, just where it curved up toward the neck, and gave the muscle there a pleasurable squeeze.Then he flattened his palm against her shoulder and gave her a firm shove downhill.A minute later she was down on the beach.Sonar Taxlaw was still sitting out on the islet wearing headphones.Einstein was snoring in a sleeping bag.Ty was sleeping in one of the little pop up shelters that had been supplied by the people from Ark Darwin, which was still anchored offshore, detectable by the slap of waves against its hull.As for Esa Arjun, she nearly collided with him, for he was simply standing there on the beach, robed in a sleeping bag.Odds were fifty fifty that he was silently meditating, or that he had gotten up to take a piss.Ivyns could be a little funny when their brains got the better of them.Either waywhether he was pissing or thinkinghe was temporarily useless, and so she went straight to the shelter and awoke Tyuratam Lake.That took a bit longer than she had been hoping for, which frustrated her greatly since it was now so obvious to her that something was happening up above: she could hear the building whine of the body orbiting flynk chains that Neoanders employed as both armor and weapons, but could not tell whether this was Langobard getting ready to mount a defense, or the interlopers coming down the hill.The latter she could easily hear now; they had abandoned stealth in favor of haste.Theyre coming, she said.Two Diggers, some Neoanders.Ty reached for his katapult, then remembered yet again that it had been taken by Ariane.Beled says to turn the light on.She was expecting him to use some sort of electronic devicethe sort of thing the Diggers lumped together under the heading of radiobut instead Ty rolled up to a seated position, bolted out of the shelter, and simply walked down the beach, hopping and cursing as his bare feet unerringly found stones.Turn the light on!he shouted.He cupped his hands around his mouth.Hey!Turn the light on!In this quiet cove, his words were loud as dynamite.Kathree heard some kind of answering shout from the direction of the barge.And from the boulder, a hissing noise.Shh!Shh!She thought it was waves surging against the stone until the flynk chain began to glow, illuminating Sonar Taxlaw, who had stood up and turned around to face them.She was shushing them with a finger pressed against her lips.Shh, be quiet!she insisted.Full blast!Ty shouted.All you got.Theyre coming!said the Cyc.And seeing that no one else cared, she caught the eye of Arjun, who had dropped his robe on the beach like a puddle and was advancing toward herstriding directly into the surf.Were hurting their ears.She heard shouting up above: fighters who had dropped all pretense of stealth and were closing for combat.The timbre of their voices was that of Neoanders.Suddenly feeling a desperate need to be up there in the fray, Kathree spun on her heel, getting ready to sprint back up the slope.She nearly collided with Cantabrigia Five.You are going back up?I feel like I have to, Kathree said.Godspeed.Remember.No damaged Diggers.Cantabrigia Five pivoted away from her in a manner that made the long skirts of her warm cloak flare beautifully, and gave Kathree a last look at her regal profile, her excellent posture emphasized by close cropped hair.As Kathree scrambled back up she reviewed the more detailed instructions that Cantabrigia Five had given her some hours ago: Stay clear of our buckies.Those would be camera carrying buckies, shooting video of whatever was about to happen.Theyd be programmed to look for clear, high ground.Kathree dropped to a low crouch perhaps fifty meters shy of Langobard.She could not see him, but she could hear the flynks careering around him as they whacked into small branches.Above and to her right, a boulder projected from the slope.It was too hard and too steep to support anything except moss.The pale stone was prominent in the directional light of the big aitrain below.A sapling had found a perch on its top, grappling the rock with a mostly exposed root system, and reaching toward the sky with a few straggly boughs that had been sculpted by the wind from the sea.Near it she saw movement, which she identified as a bucky rolling into position atop the boulder.She could see it, so it could see her.She flattened herself behind a particularly dense knot of shrubs and grass, and used her ears, which was about all she had to go on just now.Clink, clink.There it was.The sound, again, of those hand forged Digger arrowheads jostling in their quiver.Drowned out by the building whine of a nearby flynk chain, reconfiguring itself under the command of its owner.She risked looking up and saw a Neoander coming out into a place from which he had clear air to that bucky on the boulder.It wasnt Bard.It was a Red grunt in military kit.He reached out and closed his right hand on one of the chains flying around him, arresting its movement.At the same time the chain parted on the opposite side of his body and turned into a whip.It lashed out directly at the bucky on the boulder.Its shape and course were visible at first.Then it accelerated through the sound barrier and became invisible, known only by its results: a sonic bang, the complete disintegration of the bucky, and the toppling of the little sapling, cut clean through.The whip slowed as it arced back in the general direction of its owner, and, like a snake in space, reorganized itself into another flying aitrain spinning in the opposite direction from before.Having thus eliminated a robotic sentry on what to him was the left flank, the Neoander drew back toward the center of the action and disappeared from Kathrees view.Kathree moved toward the boulder.The destruction of one of Cantabrigia Fives video buckies made it a good place for her to be.She was churning headlong toward the base of the rock, wondering how she was going to find her way to the top, when movement above caught her eye.She stopped and looked steeply upward at a Digger who had just emerged onto its crown to claim the vacated high ground.He had come down the slope so impetuously that he nearly overran the top of the boulder.He had to plant a foot just short of disaster and wheel his arms backward to regain his balance.As he did so the arrowheads clinked together in his quiver.Kathree froze and crouched, watching him regain his equilibrium.Had he looked straight down hed have seen her, but he had eyes only for what was going on to his right: judging from sounds, the beginnings of a confused fight in a cluttered place.The Digger reached back, drew out a single shaft, and nocked it to his steel bow, looking out over the scene of the action below.He was thinking about choosing a target when Kathrees ambot hit him in the shoulder and sent him down twitching.Shooting the man had been easy.Not in the physical sensethat would have been easy in any case, since he was standing right there, and the ambot was largely self aiming.It had been psychologically easy.Days ago, when shed been in the worst part of her shift, barely conscious, shed overheard Ty speaking to Einstein: Fighting isnt about knowing how.Its about deciding to.Even in her delirium she had understood that the decision Ty spoke of wasnt an intellectual one.It was an overcoming of the emotional barrier that, in any civilized society, prevented people from doing damage to each other.She knew that because, hours earlier, she had done it.During that shocking initial combat between the Seven and the Diggers, she had stepped in to protect Ty after Ariane had shot him, and the old Digger had struck her on the arm with the Srap Tasmaner, bruising the bone, and something about that intense physical contact had pushed her through the barrier, made it easy to aim her katapult at the man and fire it.Since then, well meaning members of the group had approached her to offer their sympathies.All theyd wanted to talk about was Doc and Memmie, and what a shock it must have been for Kath to lose them so suddenly.Implicit was that Kath had gone epi because of their deaths.A reasonable seeming assumption.But wrong.It had happened, rather, in the moment when the old man had attacked her and she had fought back.Doc, at the time, had still been alive, and Memmie, though mortally wounded, had still been breathing.So Kath Two had actually been the first member of the Seven to die.Anyway, she was now the sort of girl who shot people.Useful to know.This all happened on what Blue would consider its right flank and Red would call its left.As aboriginal scouts supporting regular forces, the Diggers would stay on the wings or out in front.Which would imply that the other Diggershe was increasingly certain that there were exactly two of themwas likely to be on the opposite flank.The boulder itself was too steep to climb, but ashy talus had spilled to either side of it, forming loose ramps.She churned up one of these and gained an altitude where she could flatten herself against the slope and peer across the battleground.It was contained within a broad, shallow sump where water finding its way down from the slopes of the coastal range was dammed up against the outer wall of the crater.It was heavily grown over, and so its boggy nature was not evident until one set foot in it.Bard, Beled, and Roskos Yur had moved aggressively forward, made a show of force, then withdrawn to let the Red force get literally bogged down.Acting in Blues favor were difficulties in communication between, on the one hand, tightly organized, high tech Red troops and, on the other, aboriginal scouts who only knew about wireless communications because a long line of Cycs named Proboscidea Rubber had memorized the Radio entry.Anyway Kathree was now well forward of her compatriots, off to what they would call the right side of the bog.In order to reach its opposite flank she could try going straight across, but this would bring her directly into the envisioned path of the Red grunts as well as trapping her in the marsh.She could cut back toward the sea and run along the camp where theyd slept last night, but she already knew that most of the buckies were stationed there.Or she could proceed farther inland and run through the pine forest that rose above the uphill side of the bog.That would take her directly across Reds line of advance, which seemed like a bad idea on the face of it.But the Reds were just an isolated hit squad, not the vanguard of a larger force.They did not have lines of communication back to their rear.Once they had put ground behind them, they had no claim to it, no power there.Given that she could move over rough ground faster than even Beled, and given that she could hear the Neoanders a mile away, she liked her chances.So she kept moving uphill, rather than down, staying well off to the flank until she had gained a bit of altitude, then turning her attention inward.The Red Neoanders were clearly audible.All but one of them were below her, and as she paused and waited, she heard the thudding footfalls of the straggler going by her.They were getting orders from their B, or Beta, as per racial stereotype.To her credit, the B was not hanging back and commanding from the rear; she seemed to be in the thick of things, which placed her downslope just where the going started to get marshy enough to give them second thoughts about the way they were heading.They must have noticed by now that the native scout on their left had disappeared, which might encourage them to steer toward the right.In any case, they were briefly stymied.They were all downhill of Kathree.And they were all facing the other way.Looking directly across the slope she saw nothing but tall pinelike trees, forming a canopy that had stifled development of undergrowth.It would be easy going.A traversing run would take her rapidly to the opposite side of the field of battle, where she ought to be able to follow the other Diggers trail down to wherever hed stationed himself and zap him with an ambot before he was able to do anything heroic and stupid.The bang of a Neoanders flynk whip sounded from below, and she heard someone cry out and a clamor of whanging noises as ambots were projected toward targets.Feeling suddenly very late, she began to run through the trees, moving openly now.When gaps appeared, she looked down across the bog.The vantage from here was excellent.Which explained why she nearly collided with a lone man who had stationed himself in one of those clear places, perfectly situated to overlook the bog and the cove below.His only company was a robot: a siwi with a video camera for a head, capable of rising up out of its coils like a cobra from a basket and aiming its lens in any direction.The man was standing with his back to the fight, facing his siwi, which was shooting down the hill.Kathree was quite close to that siwi when she stumbled upon this, and so, when she first took it all in, she understood the setup exactly, just as a billion Red viewers would be doing in a few minutes: in the foreground, the man, framed in rugged rocks and trees that would fill habitat dwellers with that aching need to come down here and colonize the surface.In the near background, the bog where the fighting was under way.Beyond that, the cove nestled between the pincers of wave beaten rock, the flynk barge with its column of light making the whole scene into day, Ark Darwin farther out, rocking slowly on low seas, and the sky adding some light of its own as the dawn approached.The man wasnt expecting her.She got the impression, somehow, that hed been rehearsing, going over his lines, clearing his throat, preparing for a performance.So she had a few moments in which to stare at him.The three incarnations of Kath Amalthova had, in their collective lifespan, only laid eyes on live Aretaics a few times, and then only from a distance.So she had no clear measure of what counted as impressive or handsome among that race.But this one had to be one of the finer specimens.He must be over two full meters in height.His long raven hair was swept back from his forehead to make the most of a high noble brow, a strong prominent nose, large, jet black, deep set eyes.A few creases on his face gave him an air of sober maturity.Five thousand years ago, aristocracy had died, along with almost everything else, and yet the idea of aristocracythe aspirations that it, at least in an idealized form, drew out of the human psychelived on in everything about this mans appearance, his attire, his posture, and the way in which he gazed upon Kathree when he had recovered from his astonishment and understood what was happening.The look on his face said that this unexpected encounter was fascinating, as well as slightly amusing, the sort of twist of fortune that happened from time to time to sophisticated persons, and that, political differences notwithstanding, the two of them might one day discuss the whole affair wryly over a glass of fine red wine from Antimer.Or at least that was the case until Kathrees ambot struck him right in the middle of his forehead.Sensing movement and hearing the discharge of her katapult, the siwiwhich apparently had some rudimentary ability to follow what was interestingswiveled in her direction, but she stomped at its neck from behind.It gave way beneath the impact of her heel and made a creditable effort to remain standing, but was forced to uncoil itself so as to effect a soft landing on the ground.From there it might have pursued her into the trees, had it been programmed for pursuit.But it was really nothing more than a moderately smart camera platform, and so it stayed where it was, doggedly trying to center the face of the Aretaic in the middle of its frame.Since the Aretaic was rolling and writhing like a man on fire, this gave its algorithms a vigorous workout.Kathree resumed her headlong run through the trees.She bent her course back toward the sea, entering the final leg of a U shaped career around the bog.She slowed down.If her conjecture was correct, she must be drawing close to the other Digger.And unlike Bard, Beled, and Roskos Yur, she had nothing to protect her from those steel headed arrows.She heard a creaking noise from uphillbehind her.She turned around to see a redheaded, blue eyed Digger, no more than five meters away, holding an arrow at full draw, aimed right at her.The freshly sharpened edges of its hand forged steel warhead made bright arcs as they reflected the light from the cove.She had holstered her katapult to leave both hands free for scrambling.She had nothing.Cantabrigia Five hadnt exactly commanded her to incapacitate both of the Digger scouts.Just to prevent them from doing harm, and to prevent their dead bodies from showing up on video screens around the ring.Youre making a terrible mistake, she said.The Digger didnt move, but he did blink slowly.She took it as assent to keep talking.Those peoplethe Redsare only pretending to be your friends so that they can piggyback on your claim to the surface.They want to take it all for themselves.And you?he asked.Blue is no better, in some ways.Then why should we heed your counsel?You should heed no ones counsel blindly.Neither minenor his.She made a little movement of the head toward the Aretaic.Silence as he considered it.Do you know Ceylon Congreve?she asked.Of course.Has Ceylon Congreve spoken to you of chess?We do not need a Cyc to tell us of chess, the Digger said.We play it all the time.Then you know that pawns are weakexcept for when their position on the board gives them power.Early in the game they are sacrificed freely.Late in the game they may checkmate the king.She was interrupted by another whipcrack from below, followed by two more in rapid succession.She fought the temptation to turn around and look.The Diggers blue eyes strayed toward the battlefield, took something in, then returned to her.At no time did the arrowhead waver.Kathree continued: You are pawns.You cant begin to imagine how small and weak you are compared to the forces above.If you allow yourself to be played as such by Red, you will be sacrificed as soon as it suits their purposes.If you play a longer game, though, you can yet grow powerful.As powerful as the other human races.With a suddenness that made Kathree flinch, the Digger raised his weapon and relaxed the arm that had been drawing the arrow back.He plucked the nock off the string and placed the arrow back in his quiver.I take your words with a grain of salt, he said.Good.But some of what you say confirms suspicions that I have harbored in my breast since the coming of the Red people, and so I have made up my mind to go back and speak to the others of these matters.And then he simply turned his back on Kathree and began hiking back up into the mountains of Beringia.I KNOW YOUR STORY, TYURATAM LAKE, SAID CANTABRIGIA FIVE, OR at least the portions of it that have made their way into official records.Half of it, then.Be that as it may, I sense how distracting this must be for you.She made the tiniest suggestion of a glance up the slope.Even though her eyes were screened by the lenses of a stylish varp, their golden hue magnified the gesture.Part of you wishes to join the battle.Thats commendable, but I need youthe Purpose needs youhere.Fine.You have my attention, Ty said.Inappropriately, irrelevantly, he was wondering how old this woman was.Epigenetic shifts could roll back many of the visible effects of aging.At least one Moiran, Jamaica Hammerhead Twelve, had lived to the age of two hundred.Tys estimate of Cantabrigia Fives age increased by a decade every time he interacted with her.Currently he was thinking that she might be eighty years old.What do you know of the Pingers?she asked.In all honesty, they sound more myth than fact.Myth carries more weight anyway, in times like these.What do you know of them?Ty demanded.For once, Cantabrigia Five seemed a little off balance.She looked at him sharply, lifted her varp, rested it on the top of her head.I need to know, Ty said, whether they came out of some Red gene lab.Red doesnt even know they exist, said Cantabrigia Five.Did we make them?Blue?No, your hypothesis was correct, Ty.And how would you know what my hypothesis was?Her eyes strayed to the pizza box, which was leaning against a boulder that protruded from the beach.I know what is in there.Thank you, Ty said.He turned away from her and began striding in the direction of a tall young Ivyn, standing on the beach and gazing up nervously toward the sounds of battle.Einstein!Eyes on me.Time for you to make history.CRACKING A WHIP MADE OF SMALL ROBOTS JOINED END TO END into a long, flexible chain was neither an especially bad nor an especially good way of engaging a foe in ambot based combat.Extensive studies conducted within Blue military research labs had concluded that, on average, it was somewhat less effective than the more obvious procedure of just shooting individual ambots out of katapults.A dissenting opinion held that such studies were flawed because they failed to take into account two factors that were important in actual battle: One, the psychological impact on a defender who knew that the attack might literally whip around and come at him from any direction, including around corners or over barricades.Two, the element of skill, which was difficult to measure scientifically; the test subjects wielding those things in the lab were unlikely to have the same knack for it as Neoanders who had grown up using them and who had access to an ancient body of lorea martial art, in effectthat they were disinclined to share with anyone else.If the whip was allowed to dissociate in midcrack, then its component ambots would be flung toward the target at supersonic velocity, which was as good as could be achieved by shooting the same objects out of a katapult.If it made contact with the target, direct physical damage would be inflicted and the ambots that had inflicted it could decouple themselves and carry out their usual programs.And if the whipcrack was off target, the chain could be recovered in full with no waste of ammunition.All the ambots came back for another attempt: something that certainly could not be said of ones that had been fired out of kats.On Kathrees list, if they ever got out of this, was to sit down over a glass of pinot noir with Langobard and ask him where he had picked up his skills in this department, since, until recently, he had been sustaining a fairly credible cover story about being a peaceful wine merchant in Cradle.She already suspected that he would deflect any such questions by saying that the Antimer Neoanders, like many cultures throughout human history, had a tradition of teaching martial arts to their young ones.A skeptic might remark that fighting with whips made of little robots might be all well and good in the clean and well ordered confines of a space habitat or a hollowed out asteroid, or when dueling in space suits in a vacuum, or in relatively uncluttered places, such as deserts and icecaps on the surface.But in a bog full of dense, head high vegetation it was simply a mistake.Kathrees ears were taking in vast amounts of data that her brain didnt know what to do with.Someone who had grown up practicing these arts, as Langobard apparently had, might have been able to hear nuances in these repetitive bangs.A crack that landed on its target would sound different from one that dissociated into a burst of flying ambots, which in turn would sound different from one that had whipped back toward the attacker or gotten fouled up in vegetation.Instead of which, all she could tell was that they were fighting down there.By the time she had completed her circuit of the bog and returned to their original line of defense above the cove, they had been fighting for rather a long time, which she interpreted as good news.She was trying to think like Cantabrigia Five, who probably wouldnt worry so much about trivial matters like casualties and the control of the battlefield.More important was the narrative of the battle.And so far what it looked like was that a small Blue group, conducting Treaty approved survey operations on their side of the Treaty defined boundary, had been pursued by bloodthirsty Red Neoanders until trapped against the ocean, where they were now putting up a heroic and surprisingly prolonged last ditch stand to protect a few noncombatants.Kathree didnt wish to be this cynical, for Cantabrigia Five really was a fantastically appealing and charismatic person, but she suspected, at some level, that a Blue fatality or two, up in the bog, and perhaps an on camera interview with a maimed and bereaved survivor, might be the perfect counter for the propaganda coup that the Aretaics had scored a few days ago.Thoughts such as those were luxuries she did not afford herself until she had reached a position above the cove, well behind the battle zone.Andno coincidencealso behind the line of camera carrying buckies recording the heroic rearguard action.She looked down at the lower camp.A sunrise, in weather like this, was too much to ask for, but the sky was getting brighter all the time, and was now illuminating the beach more effectively than the towering Aitken loop on the barge.Perhaps in response to the sounds of battle, half a dozen or so inflatable boats had emerged from the flooded hull of Ark Darwin and begun making their way in, each carrying a few people who appeared to be wearing helmets.Good.But, annoyingly to Kathree, they were maintaining some distance.Sonar Taxlaw was standing on the boulder waving them off.Shed been joined by Einstein, who was doing likewise.That was about to become an intolerably crowded boulder, because Tyuratam Lake was wading out to join them with that pizza box under one arm.He had managed to equip himself with a dry suit, which probably made the experience a good deal more comfortable for him.Cantabrigia Five and Arjun were on the shore, facing out to sea, as if there were not a pitched battle going on a few hundred meters above them.Two of the buckies dislodged themselves from their positions above Kathree and began rolling down the slope like wire frame boulders.At first this seemed uncontrolled, like an avalanche, but then they began to stretch and deform in a way that accommodated the rocky ground rushing beneath them, and slowed to a mincing style of descent.One of them perched on a spot where it could get a clear view of the entire cove and the other picked its way down to the sand, angling for close ups, apparently.Cantabrigia Five turned toward it and advanced a few steps.Facing squarely into its camera, she began speaking words that Kathree had no hope of hearing at this distance.Kathree saw all of this while leaning back against the steep pitch of the inner crater wall.Just above her was a line of vegetation that had taken root along its brow, where the ground was level and the sunlight was as plentiful as it would ever get in these parts.It spread for some tens of meters to her left and to her right, walling off the cove from the bog and the high country above.Some loud grunting noises, and the sound of a lot of little sticks getting damaged, caused her to look sharply to her left just in time to see two large men, locked together, erupt through the wall of brush and tumble out into the open.Since the slope below was steep, they rolled together for several meters down toward the beach before the larger oneBeledwas able to lash out with one foot and plant it downslope, bringing both of them to a stop.At the same time he pushed up with both arms, shoving his opponenta Neoandercompletely off the ground, in a bid to flip him backward and send him tumbling down even farther.But the Neoander seemed to anticipate this and made his much longer arms whip around Beleds torso, scrabbling for purchase on his rib cage.Perhaps 50 percent of Beleds body was still covered by ambots locked together to form a patchy carapace.The Neoanders right hand came down on a cluster of them that was protecting Beleds armpit, and those obliged their owner by delivering a clearly audible shock into the offending hand.This disrupted whatever grapple the Neoander had been attempting.Still, Beleds gambit had basically failed, and he ended up toppling backward as his opponents momentum overthrew him.When he understood this he stopped fighting it and bent his knees, turning what might have been an ungainly sprawl into something more like a back somersault that employed the Neoanders stomach as an impact cushion.Kathree heard a snapping noise but was a little slow to understand it as a rib being broken.The Neoander, on his back, involuntarily tried to contract into a fetal position, bringing his head up into Beleds descending fist.The contact between the delicate structures of the modern hand and the massive bone arches of the Neanderthal skull was unequal and there was more cracking, to Beleds disadvantage.Still, the blow gave the Neoander a jolt, which was enough time for Beled finally to draw a knife from a sheath and press it against the others throat.He kept pressing until the Neoanders head was against the ground.The fightingat least that part of itwas over and Kathree was able for the first time to process a full image of Beleds state: bloody, half naked, spitting teeth, breathing much faster than he ever did when sprinting flat out on a treadmill.Anyway he was alive, and the fight was over for him, unless he chose to neutralize this opponent by cutting his throat.Which seemed inadvisable since he was now under the direct coverage of a bucky with a camera in it.The ancient Teklan Neoander fights of asteroid mining lore might have ended with throat cutting, but not this one.Other things happened in the bog that she did not see.Langobard emerged with Roskos Yur slung over his back in a firemans carry, and began tromping down the slope in some haste, not looking back.Beled, watching, called out a warning to him.In the same instant Kath heard movement from the bog and saw a human silhouettenot a Neoandervault through the gap that had been torn in it by Beled and his opponent, and begin running after Bard.She was a squat woman with close cropped hair, in military kita classic B.  Kathree aimed her katapult at her and fired an ambot, then two more, but all of them somehow missedthe B was evidently wearing some kind of armor that was good at spoofing this particular model, and so she could stand there all day shooting at her and nothing would happen.Still, the B heard the katapult go whang and sensed the ambots zipping around her, which was enough to stall her for a moment.She turned toward Kathree.The look on her face suggested that she had not expected to see a female Moiran.As she was taking in this extraordinary spectacle, a fist sized rock struck her on the downhill side of her head and, to all appearances, killed her.Kathree looked down the slope to see Beled following through from having thrown the rock.He had transferred his unbloodied knife to his broken hand, and now shifted it back.Nearby was Bard, who had paused in his headlong sprint toward the beach and turned around to see what Beled was throwing rocks at.Blood seemed to be draining out of him.On second thought, it was draining out of Sergeant Major Yur.The Neoander that Beled had been restraining rolled up to his feet.Just as rapidly he went down again, and a katapult whang traveled up to Kathrees ears.When Langobard turned around, she saw that Roskos Yur, badly mauled but still conscious, had brought his weapon into play with his free hand.If there were other Red forces to be accounted for, they were either dead, unconscious, or in retreat toward the mountains.For the first time in what seemed like a whilebut had probably been just a few seconds of elapsed timeKathree directed her attention to what was going on below.The rubber boats from the ark had made a decision to avoid the middle of the cove.Instead they were splitting to either side to make landfall on the prongs formed by the craters rim.From there, they could hike around if need be.A person was walking out of the water.TY HANDED THE PIZZA BOX UP TO EINSTEIN AND TOLD HIM TO OPEN it and to keep what was inside of it dry and near to hand.The dry suit was doing a fine job of keeping his legs warm and so he decided to remain below, thigh deep in the water next to the islet.His time in the war had left him with distrust, bordering on disgust, with people like Cantabrigia Five who were always thinking about the narrative.But that way of thinking was infectious.He saw the little scene on the islet through the eyes not of Tyuratam Lake, but of a video camera beaming coverage to the ring.And he thought it looked perfect the way it was: the small conical spike of glass, grubby around the waterline with wave washed sand, supporting two people: Einstein with the pizza box, and, standing next to him with a finger hooked through his belt loop, the Cyc with one headphone on and the other off.In fact he attended so closely to the image that he almost missed the main event.The look on the others faces told him he had best turn around and look out to sea.Only the head and shoulders were protruding above the waves.The Pinger was trudging up the sloping floor of the crater as if returning from a casual underwater stroll.He or she breathed loudly and deeply for a little while, apparently reoxygenating, but then settled down to a more normal respiration.Where did they live?Where had this person come from?They must have diving bells, or something, that moved about underwater.The Pinger was hairless and sleek, and, as soon became evident, lacked external genitalia.So, a woman?But if so it was a woman without breasts; and as far as Ty knew, these were still mammals.A few paces behind was a roundish object that presently turned out to be supported by a neck, which turned out to be anchored in a sloping pair of shoulders.This one did have breasts.And behind her was yet a third person of the same general description.As the first one ascended into shallower water, the shape of his body became clearer: round, and, in general, sort of projectile like.Some part of Tys brain wanted to identify him as a fat man.And maybe he was fat, in the same way that an otter or a seal is: a thick layer of subcutaneous fat held in beneath taut, rather thick looking skin.But in no way did he seem flabby or jiggly.His overall style of movement suggested heavy musculature hidden beneath that smooth jacket of, for lack of a better word, blubber.Basically naked, he did have a kind of web harness strapped around his torso, with a sufficient number of odds and ends attached to it to make it clear that he was a technological being.At first the Pingers had seemed black, but as they came out of the water it became clear that their skin was dark gray, and mottled with patches of lighter gray, shading toward blues and greens.Their bellies were of lighter hue than their backs, and the mottling tended to run up their sides.Ty didnt like to stare.But he couldnt help it.Nothing was visible between their legs save a system of concentric folds within which, Ty assumed, a fairly normal set of genitalia must be hiding.Perhaps just awaiting a suitable invitation to present themselves.They were drawing close enough now that their faces could be looked at.The underlying skulls probably looked the same as those of rootstock humans.But eyes, ears, and nostrils were guarded by systems of muscled flaps that were always in some amount of motion.Sonar Taxlaws earlier remark about breeding wolves into poodles had been a bit indelicate.But the analogy held up.These people were to more ordinary humans as bulldogs were to hounds.All the same stuff was there.You just had to look for it a little harder.Ty turned back to look at Einstein and Sonar.Understandably, they had eyes only for the approaching Pingers.Einstein, he said.Then, louder: Einstein!Startled, Einstein nearly fell into the water, then focused on Ty.Do you want it?he mouthed, nodding at the rectangle gripped in his hands.No, Ty said, it has to be a child of Ivy.Now?Now.Einstein gripped the things bottom corners in his hands and held it up above his head so that the approaching visitors could get a clear view of it.It was a picture, blown up to about half a meter square.Any Spacer would recognize it as an iconic image from the Epic.It was the last photograph that Ivys fianc, Cal Blankenship, had texted to her from the conning tower of his submarine, moments before closing the hatch and diving to escape from the opening salvo of the Hard Rain.The image was dominated by two concentric circles: in the middle distance, the aperture of the open hatch, framing a disk of sky already split in two by the fiery trace of a bolide.Surrounding that, much closer to the camera, the engagement ring that he had just removed from his finger.The question was whether Cals descendants would recognize it.The lead Pingers face unfolded a little, his gray eyes seeming to become larger, his ears blooming from mere slits into something more resembling normal human ears, except smaller and sleeker.He stopped trudging in knee deep water.The other two drew abreast of him.All three were gazing up at the picture held aloft by the shivering Ivyn.Tys ears were tickled by high pitched vocalizations that were almost recognizable as English words.The Pingers were talking to one another, turning their heads to exchange remarks, pointing at the picture, gesticulating broadly.Of course, people who spent a lot of time underwater would become good at talking with their hands.The female Pinger said something emphatic, getting the attention of the other two.Ty couldnt understand the words, but the tone and the body language were emphatic: Shut up.Listen.I know what this is.She held her left hand in front of her body.The palm was elongated.The fingers were stubby and, when she spread them apart, slightly webbed.With her right hand she enclosed the ring finger of the left and pantomimed sliding a ring off.She held the imaginary ring aloft, then brought her left hand up to her face and twitched her index finger once, pretending to take a picture.KATHREE FELT HERSELF, AS SHE WATCHED ALL OF THIS, SLIDING down the slope on her ass in a semicontrolled manner, almost afraid that she might scare the Pingers away with a sudden movement.Bard had reached the lower camp quicker and laid Sergeant Major Yur out on a sleeping bag, where Hope was attending to him, already hooking up an intravenous tube.Kathree passed by Beled, who was straddling the helpless Red Neoander, putting huge plastic ties on his ankles and wrists.She made it down to the beach, keeping well clear of Cantabrigia Five, who was speaking into a camera, and Arjun, who was just watching and mumbling into his varp.Several more Pingers had waded up into the shallows.One of thema male, strapped with more gear than the othershad approached Ty, and seemed to be trying to communicate with him.Ty was grinning, but he kept cupping a hand around his ear and shaking his head.The Pinger reached out, gently took Tys wrist, and plucked at the black stuff of his dry suit.Ty responded by mimicking the same gesture on the slick skin of the Pingers arm.Both of them laughed.The Pingers teeth were white and they were sharp.The first three Pingers had come ashore on the islet and were inspecting the photograph, which Einstein was holding now in front of his chest, part invitation and part shield.Sonar Taxlaw, not so encumbered, faced off uncertainly against the female Pinger, who suddenly stepped forward and embraced her.On the beach, Cantabrigia Five exchanged a satisfied look with Esa Arjun and glanced toward the sky.Epilogue  CAL SENT MORE THAN ONE PHOTO TO EVE IVY DURING THE WEEKS leading up to the Hard Rain, said Esa Arjun.A total of seventeen, including that one.He nodded at the picture.Somewhat the worse for wear, it was leaning against the inner wall of Ark Darwins fuselage at the end of the table where he and Ty were eating lunch.He and Ty and Deep.Deep was the Pinger who had approached Ty and befriended him with a nonverbal joke about his dry suit.He was seated a couple of chairs away at the same table.It wasnt really clear whether he thought of himself as part of this conversation.Can he understand what Im saying?Arjun asked.Hes getting better.We sound like tuba music to them.Is his name really what you say it is?Its the closest I can get to pronouncing it, Ty said, and he answers to it.Deep had been tearing into a raw fish filet, served on a platter with some seaweed garnishes.He seemed then to realize that he was being talked about, and tensed up in a way that seemed very human.At a loss for words, he grabbed his cup of cider and raised it to them.They raised theirs in return, and all drank.I think hes some kind of technician or scientist, Ty said.All that stuff in his harness.Yes, Arjun said, eyeing the Pinger curiously.Optics.Electronics.They preserved more technology than the Diggers were able to.They had more space, Ty pointed out, and they could scavenge whatever sank to the bottom.He turned his attention back to Arjun.Anyway, you were saying about the seventeen photos?Yes.Most of them were of a type referred to, in those days, as selfies.Now, technically, this was a criminal violation of military secrecy.Very strange given that Cal was otherwise so attentive to duty.Yes, said Ty, casting his mind back to scenes from the Epic.I remember Eve Ivy agonizing about that when Eve Julia ordered Cal to nuke Venezuela.Thats a perfect example.So, this lapseif thats what it washas attracted some attention from scholars.All seventeen of the photos were eventually recovered from Ivys phone.An obscure sub sub sub discipline of historical scholarship grew up around them.The kind of thing only Ivyns would care about, said Ty.Cloistered in some library on Stromness.Exactly.Ark Darwin was still riding at anchor outside the cove, and its fuselage was still flooded.This made it a perfect setting for what was happening now: a diplomatic conference between the Pingers and a delegation of important Blue officials who had been pod dropped, straight from Greenwich, a few hours after the conclusion of the battle above the beach.Einstein, Sonar Taxlaw, and all the other Blues had evacuated the cove and gone aboard the ark.Beled had been the last to depart; before climbing into the waiting boat, he had freed the captured Neoander and left him enough provisions to keep him in good stead until he could be rescued by his own people.And his own people had  shown up in force a few hours later.But according to the deal they themselves had struck with the Diggers, their claim was to the land surface only.And Ark Darwin wasnt on the land.So, a growing Red military encampment was spreading around the shore of the cove, facing their Blue counterparts across a few hundred meters of salt water.The arks flooded hull was chilly, and obliged the Blue diplomats to dress warmly.Ty, Deep, and Arjun were in a dry space higher up and farther forward, a sort of half exposed mezzanine where folding tables and chairs had been set up to act as a mess hall for the growing complement of Blue personnelas well as any Pingers who felt like wading up the ramp.They were eating hot soup and quaffing a funky but quite palatable cider from the northern slope of Antimer.Now, said Arjunenjoying, as only an Ivyn could, the opportunity to wax professorialwhat you must be wondering about these people is How the hell they survived.With only one submarine.Arjun nodded.It turns out that if you look at the work of those scholars I mentionedthe most recent of whom died two centuries agothere are clues.But if the selfies were taken before the Hard Rain even began, Ty protested, how could there be clues as to what happened after?I mean clues that Cal went out of his way to plant in the background of the photos.Clues intended for Ivys eyes only.Hints that he had more of a chance than one might imagine.Go on.Ty sat back and reached for his cup of cider.We know all about the Cloud Ark program, because its where we came from.It is our history.We have all of the records in our archives.Well, what Cal was hinting at, with these photos, is that there was another program, perhaps as large, that we never heard about.A program to keep people alive under the sea?Ty asked.Exactly.There are, in the background of these photos, detailed bathymetric charts of some of the deepest undersea canyons in the worlds oceans.There are documentsbinders on a shelfwhose titles suggest that they are about such preparations.Other clues as wellits all public research, Ill send you the information if you want it.Okay, Ty said, just to be cordial.He knew that he would never read those research papers.But the bottom line is that Deeps peoplehe nodded at their tablematedidnt survive just because Cal got lucky.They have an Epic of their own that, for all we know, might compare to ours, Arjun said.Sonar and Einstein had been making their way down the food service line and now approached, eyeing the two vacant seats at the table.Arjun took this as his cue to excuse himself.Deep said goodbye to him with a courteous bob of the head.Within moments Ty and his Pinger friend had been joined by the young Ivyn and the Cyc.For a minute or two, the new arrivals did nothing but eat ravenously, the only conversation being Sonar asking the names and origins of the various foodsall new to heron her tray.Ty handled those inquiries so that Einstein could be left free to stuff his face.After a while this became a source of amusement even to Sonar Taxlaw, who just watched the boy eat, and transferred some of her food to his tray when he began to run low.Sometime, youll have to tell me what its like, Ty remarked.What Einstein began, before food got in the way.whats like?Sonar said, completing his sentence.Finding someone so completely.The way you two did.Thats never happened to you?Einstein asked.He wasnt being rude.It had simply never occurred to him that he could have had experiences of which Tyuratam Lake knew nothing.No.Its never happened to me.Einstein had begun to approach the point of satiation.He sat back in his chair and cast his gaze over the wreckage of his lunch, looking for any morsels that deserved more attention.I have a question for you, he said.Fancy that, Ty returned.Whats the Purpose?People keep mentioning it.I wish I knew.Very funny, but you know what Im talking about.Roskos Yur mentioned it.Cantabrigia Five mentioned it.Purpose with a capital P.  My answer remains the same, Ty said.No one has ever told me.I have to make guesses, based on what I see from people who act like they know what it is.People like the owners of your bar?Evidently.And what is your guess?Sensing another pair of eyes on him, Ty glanced over toward Deep, who was chewing vigorously, trying to reduce a stubborn wad of seaweed to submission.But he seemed to be following the conversation.Ty shrugged.Humans have always He was about to say deluded themselves but didnt want to make a poor impression on Deep.preferred to believe that there was a purpose to the universe.Until the moon blew up, they had theories.After Zero, the theories all seemed kind of stupid.Fairy tales for coddled children.No one thought about the big picture for a few thousand years.We were all scrambling to survive.Like ants when their nest has been destroyed.On those rare occasions when we thought about the big picture, it wasnt really that bigRed versus Blue or what have you.There was surprisingly little thinking about the Agent.Where it came from.Whether it was natural or artificial, or even divine.Einstein, the Cyc, and Deep were all nodding as if to say Go on, go on!But he had nothing to go on with.Some peoplesome Red, some Blue, and some ambiguous folks like the Owners of my barmaybe even some of those kind of peoplehe nodded at Deepseem to think they know something.Do they?asked Sonar Taxlaw.I have no idea, said Ty.But from what Ive seen, theyre not stupid.Even if they are He paused, groping for words.Even if they are, Einstein repeated, what?!Its a waythe Purpose is a wayof saying theres something bigger than this crap weve spent the last week of our lives dealing with.Red versus Blue crap?Yes.And even though no one is sharing anything with meyetI like the feeling of that.People who claim they are motivated by the Purpose end up behaving differentlyand generally betterthan people who serve other masters.So it is like believing in God.Maybe yes.But without the theology, the scripture, the pigheaded certainty.Einstein and the Cyc nodded and looked thoughtful.But also, or so it seemed to Ty, a little let down.Sorry I didnt have an answer to your question, Ty said.What are you going to do next?Now that your Seven is disbanded?asked Sonar.Go back to my bar.On Cradle?On Cradle.Once, an astonishing wonder of technological prowess.Now a quaint, outmoded precursor to the vastly superior Gnomon.Id like to see it, Sonar said.We have rooms.Apartments where people can stay, around the courtyard in the back.They must be expensive.They are free, Ty said.How do you get one of those free rooms?Einstein asked.Beats me.The Owners hand them out to people who serve the Purpose.Very important people, then.Ty shrugged.They cant kill you for asking.Youre right about the Seven.Thats gone.Our Ivyn died.You took his place.Einstein cackled nervously.Im no replacement for Doc!You dont have to replace him.Not in that sense.But look what you did.You made first contact with these guys.He nodded at Deep.And first contact of another kind with the Diggers.Both Einstein and Sonar Taxlaw blushed deeply.The Cyc came along and replaced Memmie.Thats not a traditional Seven.But if we can pry Beled and Kathree apart, and if we can round up a Julian and a Camite who dont hate each other, well have ourselves a Nine.The first Nine ever assembled.Ty was just running his mouth, letting the cider talk.Sonar, however, was taking it all seriously.But only one of the Adan subraces will be represented, she pointed out.Bard is plenty.You should include the other four, Einstein said.That makes thirteen.An unlucky number.And a bit of a crowd, frankly.But the youngsters across the table from him were looking heartrendingly sincere.Ty broke eye contact.Ill bet I could talk the Owners out of a few free rooms, for such a momentous occasion.Are you really going to ask them?!Sonar exclaimed.Nah.As an ancient saying has it, its easier to ask forgiveness than permission.You are all welcome at the Crows Nest.Ty looked over at Deep.Just go easy on the cold baths, man.The plumbing in that place has seen better days, and Im the only one who knows how to fix it.
