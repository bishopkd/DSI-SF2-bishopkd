He stumbles down the other side of the embankment and heaves the girl into the sea.The splash soaks him with saltwater.She sinks like a stone.Anderson gasps and lunges after her sinking form.You fool.You stupid fool.He catches a limp arm and drags her body up from the depths.Holds her so that her face floats above the waves, bracing himself to keep her from sinking again.Her skin burns.He half expects the sea to boil around her.Her black hair fans out like a net in the lapping waves.She dangles in his grasp.Lao Gu jostles down beside him.Anderson waves him over."Here.Hold her. "Lao Gu hesitates."Hold her, damn it.Zhua ta. "Reluctantly, Lao Guslides his hands under her arms.Anderson touches her neck, feeling for a pulse.Is her brain already cooked?He could be trying to revive a vegetable.The windup's pulse whirs like a hummingbird's, faster than any creature her size should run.Anderson leans down to listen to her breathing.Her eyes snap open.He jerks away.She thrashes and Lao Gu loses his grip.She disappears under water."No!"Anderson lunges after her.She surfaces again, thrashing and coughing and reaching for him.Her hand locks on his and he pulls her to the bank.Her clothes swirl about her like tangled seaweed and her black hair glistens like silk.She stares up at Anderson with dark eyes.Her skin is suddenly blessedly cool.* * *   "Why did you help me?"Methane lamps flicker on the streets, turning the city ethereal shades of green.Darkness has fallen and the lampposts hiss against the blackness.Humidity reflects on cobbles and concrete, gleams on people's skin as they lean close around candles in the night markets.The windup girl asks again."Why?"Anderson shrugs, glad the darkness hides his expression.He doesn't have a good answer himself.If her attacker complains of a farang and a windup girl, it will trigger questions and attract white shirts to him.A foolish risk, considering how exposed he already finds himself.He's far too easy to describe, and it's not far from where he found the girl to Sir Francis', and from there to more uncomfortable questions.He forces down his paranoia.He's as bad as Hock Seng.The nak leng was obviously high on yaba.He won't go to the white shirts.He'll slink away and lick his wounds.Still, it was foolish.When she fainted in the rickshaw he was sure that she was about to die, and a part of him had been glad.Relieved that he could take back that moment when he recognized her, and against all his training, tied his fate to hers.He glances over at her.Her skin has lost its terrifying flush and furnace heat.She holds the remnants of slashed clothes around her, keeping her modesty.It's pitiable, really, that a creature so utterly owned clings to modesty."Why?"she asks again.He shrugs again."You needed help. ""No one helps a windup. "Her voice is flat."You are a fool. "She pushes damp hair away from her face.A surreal stutter stop motion, the genetic bits of her unkinking.Her smooth skin shines between the edges of her slashed blouse, the gentle promise of her breasts.What would she feel like?Her skin gleams, smooth and inviting.She catches him staring."Do you wish to use me?""No. "he looks away, uneasy."It's not necessary. ""I would not fight you," she says.Anderson feels a sudden revulsion at the acquiescence in her voice.On another day, at another time, he probably would have taken her for the novelty.Thought nothing of it.But the fact that she expects so little fills him with distaste.He forces a smile."Thank you.No. "She nods shortly.Looks out again at the humid night and the green glow of the street lamps.It's impossible to say if she is grateful or surprised, or if his decision even matters to her.However her mask might have slipped in the heat of terror and relief of escape, her thoughts are carefully locked away now."Is there someplace I should take you?"She shrugs."Raleigh.He is the only one who will keep me. ""But he wasn't the first, was he?You weren't always" He trails off.There's no polite word and, looking at the girl, he doesn't have the appetite to call her a toy.She glances over at him, then out again at the passing city.Gas lights puddle the street with low green pockets of phosphor, separated by deep canyons of shadow.They pass under a lamp and Anderson catches her face, dimly illuminated, humidity sheened and pensive, before it disappears again in darkness."No.I was not always this way.Not" she trails off."Not like this. "She falls quiet, thoughtful."Mishimoto employed me.I had" she shrugs, "an owner.An owner at the company.I was owned.Gen my owner acquired a temporary foreign business exemption to bring me to the Kingdom.A ninety day permit.Extendible by palace waiver because of the Japanese Friendship.I was his Personal Secretary: translation, office management and companion. "Another shrug, more felt than seen."But it is expensive to return to Japan.A dirigible ticket for a New Person is the same as for your kind.My owner concluded that leaving his secretary in Bangkok was more economical.When his assignment here ended, he decided to upgrade new in Osaka. ""Jesus and Noah. "She shrugs."I was given my final pay at the anchor pad and he went away.Up and away. ""And now Raleigh?"he asks.Again the shrug."No Thai wants a New Person for secretary, or translation.In Japan, okay.Common, even.Too few babies born, too much working needed.Here " She shakes her head."Calorie markets are controlled.Everyone is jealous for U Tex.Everyone protects their rice.Raleigh does not care.Raleigh likes novelty. "The clouded scent of fish frying washes over them, greasy and cloying.A night market, full of people dining by candlelight, hunched over noodles and skewers of octopus and plates of laap.Anderson stifles an urge to raise the rickshaw's rain hood and close the privacy curtain, to hide the evidence of her company.Woks flame brightly with the telltale green sparkles of Environment Ministry taxed methane.The sweat sheen on the people's dark skins is barely lit.At their feet, cheshires circle, alert for charity scraps and opportunities for theft.A cheshire shadow bleeds across the darkness, causing Lao Gu to swerve.He curses softly in his own language.Emiko laughs, a small surprised sound as she claps her hands in delight.Lao Gu glares back at her."You like cheshires?"Anderson asks.Emiko looks at him in surprise."You do not?""Back home, we can't kill them fast enough," he says."Even Grahamites offer blue bills for their skins.Probably the only thing they've ever done that I agreed with. ""Mmm, yes. "Emiko's brow wrinkles thoughtfully."They are too much improved for this world, I think.A natural bird has so little chance, now. "She smiles slightly."Just think if they had made New People first. "Is it mischief in her eyes?Or melancholy?"What do you think would have happened?"Anderson asks.Emiko doesn't meet his gaze, looks out instead at the circling cats amongst the diners."Generippers learned too much from cheshires. "She doesn't say anything else, but Anderson can guess what's in her mind.If her kind had come first, before the generippers knew better, she would not have been made sterile.She would not have the signature tick tock motions that make her so physically obvious.She might have even been designed as well as the military windups now operating in Vietnam deadly and fearless.Without the lesson of the cheshires, Emiko might have had the opportunity to supplant the human species entirely with her own improved version.Instead, she is a genetic dead end.Doomed to a single life cycle, just like SoyPRO and TotalNutrient Wheat.Another shadow cat bolts across the street, shimmering and shading through darkness.A high tech homage to Lewis Carroll, a few dirigible and clipper ship rides, and suddenly entire classes of animals are wiped out, unequipped to fight an invisible threat."We would have realized our mistake," Anderson observes."Yes.Of course.But perhaps not soon enough."She changes the subject abruptly.Nods at a temple rising against the night skyline."It's very pretty, yes?You like their temples?"Anderson wonders if she has changed the subject to avoid conflict and argument, or if she is actually afraid that he will successfully refute her fantasy.He studies the rising chedi and bot of the temple."It's a lot nicer than what the Grahamites are building back home. ""Grahamites. "She makes a face."So concerned with niche and nature.So focused on their Noah's ark, after the flood has already happened. "Anderson thinks of Hagg, sweating and distressed at the destruction caused by ivory beetle."If they could, they'd keep us all on our own continents. ""It is impossible, I think.People like to expand.To fill new niches. "The temple's golden filigree shines dully under the moon.The world truly is shrinking again.A few dirigible and clipper rides and Anderson clatters through darkened streets on the far side of the planet.It's astounding.In his grandparents' time, even the commute between an old Expansion suburb and a city center was impossible.His grandparents used to tell stories of exploring abandoned suburbs, scavenging for the scrap and leavings of whole sprawling neighborhoods that were destroyed in the petroleum Contraction.To travel ten miles had been a great journey for them, and now look at him  Ahead of them, white uniforms materialize at the mouth of an alley.Emiko blanches and leans close."Hold me. "Anderson tries to shake her off, but she clings.The white shirts have stopped, are watching them approach.The windup clings more tightly.Anderson fights an urge to shove her from the rickshaw and flee.This is the last thing he needs.She whispers, "I am against quarantine now, like Nippon genehack weevil.If they see my movement, they will know.They will mulch me. "She nestles close."I am sorry.Please. "Her eyes beg.In a sudden rush of pity he wraps his arms around her, enfolding her in whatever protection a calorie man can offer a piece of illegal Japanese trash.The Ministry men call out to them, smiling.Anderson smiles back and gives a bob of the head, even as his skin prickles.The white shirts' eyes linger.One of them smiles and says something to the other as he twirls the baton that dangles from his wrist.Emiko shivers uncontrollably beside Anderson, her smile a forced mask.Anderson pulls her closer.Please don't ask for a bribe.Not this time.Please.They slide past.Behind them, the white shirts start laughing, either about the farang and the girl clutched together or about something else completely unrelated and it doesn't matter really because they are disappearing into the distance and he and Emiko are safe again.She draws away, shaking."Thank you," she whispers."I was careless to come out.Stupid. "She pushes her hair away from her face and looks back.The Ministry men are quickly receding.Her fists clench."Stupid girl," she murmurs."You are not a cheshire who disappears as you please. "She shakes her head, angry, driving home her own lesson."Stupid.Stupid.Stupid. "Anderson watches, transfixed.Emiko is adapted for a different sort of world, not this brutal sweltering place.The city will swallow her eventually.It's obvious.She becomes aware of his gaze.Shares a small melancholy smile."Nothing lasts forever, I think. ""No. "Anderson's throat is tight.They stare at one another.Her blouse has fallen open again, showing the line of her throat, the inner curve of her breasts.She doesn't move to hide herself, just looks back at him, solemn.Is it deliberate?Does she mean to encourage him?Or is it simply her nature to entice?Perhaps she cannot help herself at all.A set of instincts as ingrained in her DNA as the cheshire's clever stalking of birds.Anderson leans close, unsure.Emiko doesn't pull away, moves instead to meet him.Her lips are soft.Anderson runs his hand up her hip, pushes her blouse open and quests inside.She sighs and presses closer, her lips opening to him.Does she wish this?Or only acquiesce?Is she even capable of refusing?Her breasts press against him.Her hands slip down his body.He's shaking.Trembling like a sixteen year old boy.Did the geneticists embed her DNA with pheromones?Her body is intoxicating.Mindless of the street, of Lao Gu, of everything, he pulls her to him, running his hand up to cup her breast, to hold her perfect flesh.The windup girl's heart speeds like a hummingbird's under his palm.11  Jaidee has a certain respect for the Chaozhou Chinese.Their factories are large and well run.They have generations rooted in the Kingdom, and they are intensely loyal to Her Majesty the Child Queen.They are utterly unlike the pathetic Chinese refugees who have flooded in from Malaya, fleeing to his country in hopes of succor after they alienated the natives of their own.If the Malayan Chinese had been half as clever as the Chaozhou, they would have converted to Islam generations ago, and woven themselves fully into the tapestry of that society.Instead, the Chinese of Malacca and Penang and the Western Coast arrogantly held themselves apart, thinking the rising tide of fundamentalism would not affect them.And now they come begging to the Kingdom, hoping that their Chaozhou cousins will aid them when they were not clever enough to help themselves.The Chaozhou are smart, where the Malayan Chinese are stupid.They are practically Thai themselves.They speak Thai.They took Thai names.They may have Chinese roots somewhere in their distant past, but they are Thai.And they are loyal.Which, when Jaidee thinks about it, is more than can be said about some of his own race, certainly more than can be said of Akkarat and his brood at the Trade Ministry.So Jaidee feels a certain sympathy when a Chaozhou businessman in a long white shirt, loose cotton trousers and sandals strides back and forth in front of him on the factory floor, complaining that his factory has been shut down because some coal ration has been exceeded, when he paid every white shirt who came through his door, and that Jaidee has no right no right to shut down the entire factory.Jaidee even has sympathy when the man calls him a turtle's egg which is certainly an annoying thing to hear, knowing that it is a terrible insult in Chinese.Yet still, he remains tolerant of the emotional explosions on the part of this businessman.It's in the Chinese nature to be a bit hot hearted.They are given to explosions of emotion that a Thai would never indulge in.All in all, Jaidee has sympathy for the man.But he doesn't have sympathy for a man who shoves a finger into his chest repeatedly while he curses, and so Jaidee is sitting atop that man's chest now with a black baton over his windpipe explaining the finer points of respect due a white shirt."You seem to have mistaken me for another Ministry man," Jaidee observes.The man gurgles and tries to get free, but the baton crushing his throat prevents him.Jaidee watches him carefully."You of course understand that we have coal rationing because we are a city underwater.Your carbon allocation was exceeded many months ago. ""Ghghhaha. "Jaidee considers the response.Shakes his head sadly."No.I think that we cannot allow it to continue.King Rama XII decreed, and Her Royal Majesty the Child Queen now supports that we shall never abandon Krung Thep to the invasions of the rising sea.We will not flee from our City of Divine Beings the way the cowards of Ayutthaya fled from the Burmese.The ocean is not some marching army.Once we accede to the waters, we will never again throw it out. "He regards the sweating Chinese man."And so we must all do our part.We must all fight together, like the villagers of Bang Rajan, to keep this invader from our streets, don't you think?""Gghhghghhghhhh"  "Good. "Jaidee smiles."I'm glad we're making progress. "Someone clears his throat.Jaidee looks up, stifling his annoyance."Yes?"A young private in new whites stands respectfully, waiting."Khun Jaidee" He wais, lowering his head to his pressed palms.Holds the pose."I am very sorry for my interruption. ""Yes?""Chao Khun General Pracha requests your presence. ""I'm busy," Jaidee says."Our friend here finally seems willing to communicate with a cool heart and a reasonable demeanor. "He smiles kindly down at the businessman.The boy says, "I was to tell you I was told to, to"  "Go ahead. ""To tell you that you should get your, your  so sorry  'glory seeking ass'  so sorry  back to the Ministry.Immediately if not before. "He winces at the words."If you have no cycle you were supposed to take mine. "Jaidee grimaces."Ah.Yes.Well then. "He gets up off the businessman.Nods to Kanya."Lieutenant?Perhaps you can reason with our friend here?"Kanya makes a face of puzzlement."Is something wrong?""It seems Pracha is finally ready to rant and rave at me. ""Should I come with you?"Kanya glances at the businessman."This lizard can wait for another day. "Jaidee grins at her concern."Don't worry about me.Finish here.I'll let you know whether we're being exiled south to guard yellow card internments for the rest of our careers when you get back. "As they head for the door, the businessman musters new bravery."I'll have your head for this, heeya!"The sound ofKanya's club connecting and a yelp are the last things Jaidee hears as he exits the factory.Outside, the sun glares down.He's already sweating from the exertion of working on the businessman, and the sun burns uncomfortably.He stands under the shade of a coconut palm until the messenger can bring the bike around.The boy eyes Jaidee's sweating face with concern."You wish to rest?"Jaidee laughs."Don't worry about me, I'm just getting old.That heeya was a troublesome one, and I'm not the fighter I used to be.In the cool season I wouldn't be sweating so. ""You won a lot of fights. ""Some. "Jaidee grins."And I trained in weather hotter than this. ""Your lieutenant could do such work," the boy says."No need for you to work so hard. "Jaidee wipes his brow and shakes his head."And then what would my men think?That I'm lazy. "The boy gasps."No one would think such a thing of you.Never!""When you're a captain, you'll understand better. "Jaidee smiles indulgently."Men are loyal when you lead from the front.I won't have a man wasting his time winding a crank fan for me, or waving a palm frond just to keep me comfortable like those heeya in the Trade Ministry.I may lead, but we are all brothers.When you're a captain, promise me you'll do the same. "The boy's eyes shine.He wais again."Yes, Khun.I won't forget.Thank you!""Good boy. "Jaidee swings his leg over the boy's bike."When Lieutenant Kanya is finished here, she'll give you a ride back on our tandem. "He steers out into traffic.In the hot season, without rain, not many except the insane or the motivated are out in the direct heat, but covered arches and paths hide markets full of vegetables and cooking implements and clothing.At Thanon Na Phralan, Jaidee takes his hands off the handlebars to wai to the City Pillar Shrine as he passes, whispering a prayer for the safety of the spiritual heart of Bangkok.It is the place where King Rama XII first announced that they would not abandon the city to the rising seas.Now, the sound of monks chanting for the city's survival filters out onto the street, filling Jaidee with a sense of peace.He raises his hands to his forehead three times, one of a river of other riders who all do the same.Fifteen minutes later, the Environment Ministry appears, a series of buildings, red tiled, with steeply sloping roofs peering out of bamboo thickets and teak and rain trees.High white walls and Garuda and Singha images guard the Ministry's perimeter, stained with old rain marks and fringed with growing ferns and mosses.Jaidee has seen the compound from the air, one of a handful taken up for a dirigible overflight of the city when Chaiyanuchit still ran the Ministry and white shirt influence was absolute, when the plagues that swept the earth were killing crops at such a fantastic rate that no one knew if anything at all would survive.Chaiyanuchit remembered the beginning of the plagues.Not many could claim that.And when Jaidee was just a young draftee, he was lucky enough to work in the man's office, bringing dispatches.Chaiyanuchit understood what was at stake, and what had to be done.When the borders needed closing, when ministries needed isolating, when Phuket and Chiang Mai needed razing, he did not hesitate.When jungle blooms exploded in the north, he burned and burned and burned, and when he took to the sky in His Majesty the King's dirigible, Jaidee was blessed to ride with him.By then, they were only mopping up.AgriGen and PurCal and the rest were shipping their plague resistant seeds and demanding exorbitant profits, and patriotic generippers were already working to crack the code of the calorie companies' products, fighting to keep the Kingdom fed as Burma and the Vietnamese and the Khmers all fell.AgriGen and its ilk were threatening embargo over intellectual property infringement, but the Thai Kingdom was still alive.Against all odds, they were alive.As others were crushed under the calorie companies' heels, the Kingdom stood strong.Embargo!Chaiyanuchit had laughed.Embargo is precisely what we want!We do not wish to interact with their outside world at all.And so the walls had gone up those that the oil collapse had not already created, those that had not been raised against civil war and starving refugees a final set of barriers to protect the Kingdom from the onslaughts of the outside world.As a young inductee Jaidee had been astounded at the hive of activity that was the Environment Ministry.White shirts rushing from office to street as they tried to maintain tabs on thousands of hazards.In no other ministry was the sense of urgency so acute.Plagues waited for no one.A single genehack weevil found in an outlying district meant a response time counted in hours, white shirts on a kink spring train rushing across the countryside to the epicenter.And at every turn the Ministry's purview was expanding.The plagues were but the latest insult to the Kingdom's survival.First came the rising sea levels, the need to construct the dikes and levees.And then came the oversight of power contracts and trading in pollution credits and climate infractions.The white shirts took over the licensing of methane capture and production.Then there was the monitoring of fishery health and toxin accumulations in the Kingdom's final bastion of calorie support (a blessing that the farang calorie companies thought as land locked people and had only desultorily attacked fishing stocks).And there was the tracking of human health and viruses and bacteria: H7V9; cibiscoscosis111.b, c, d; fa' gan fringe; bitter water mussels, and their viral mutations that jumped so easily from saltwater to dry land; blister rust There was no end to the duties of the Ministry.Jaidee passes a woman selling bananas.He can't resist hopping off his bike to buy one.It's a new varietal from the Ministry's rapid prototyping unit.Fast growing, resistant to makmak mites with their tiny black eggs that sicken banana flowers before they can hope to grow.He peels the banana and eats it greedily as he pushes his bike along, wishing he could take the time to have a real snack.He discards the peel beside the bulk of a rain tree.All life produces waste.The act of living produces costs, hazards and disposal questions, and so the Ministry has found itself in the center of all life, mitigating, guiding and policing the detritus of the average person along with investigating the infractions of the greedy and short sighted, the ones who wish to make quick profits and trade on others' lives for it.The symbol for the Environment Ministry is the eye of a tortoise, for the long view the understanding that nothing comes cheap or quickly without a hidden cost.And if others call them the Turtle Ministry, and if the Chaozhou Chinese now curse white shirts as turtle's eggs because they are not allowed to manufacture as many kink spring scooters as they would like, so be it.If the farang make fun of the tortoise for its slow pace, so be it.The Environment Ministry has ensured that the Kingdom endures, and Jaidee can only stand in awe of its past glories.And yet, when Jaidee climbs off his bicycle outside the Ministry gate, a man glares at him and a woman turns away.Even just outside their own compound or perhaps particularly there the people he protects turn away from him.Jaidee grimaces and wheels his cycle past the guards.The compound is still a hive of activity, and yet it is so different from when he first joined.There is mold on the walls and chunks of the edifice are cracking under the pressure of vines.An old bo tree leans against a wall, rotting, underlining their failures.It has lain so for ten years, rotting.Unremarked amongst the other things that have also died.There is an air of wreckage to the place, of jungle attempting to reclaim what was carved from it.If the vines were not cleared from the paths, the Ministry would disappear entirely.In a different time, when the the Ministry was a hero of the people, it was different.Then, people genuflected before Ministry officers, three times khrabbed to the ground as though they were monks themselves, their white uniforms inspiring respect and adoration.Now Jaidee watches civilians flinch as he walks past.Flinch and run.He is a bully, he thinks sourly.Nothing but a bully walking amongst water buffalo, and though he tries to herd them with kindness, again and again, he finds himself using the whip of fear.The whole Ministry is the same at least, those who still understand the dangers that they face, who still believe in the bright white line of protection that must be maintained.I am a bully.He sighs and parks the cycle in front of the administrative offices, which are desperately in need of a whitewashing that the shrinking budget cannot finance.Jaidee eyes the building, wondering if the Ministry has come to crisis thanks to overreaching, or because of its phenomenal success.People have lost their fear of the outside world.Environment's budget shrinks yearly while that of Trade increases.Jaidee finds a seat outside the general's office.White shirt officers walk past, carefully ignoring him.That he is waiting in front of Pracha's office should fill him with some satisfaction.It isn't often that he is called before a man of rank.He's done something right, for once.A young man approaches hesitantly.Wais."Khun Jaidee?"At Jaidee's nod, the young man breaks into a grin.His hair is cropped close and his eyebrows are only slight shadows; he has just come out of the monastery."Khun, I hoped it was you. "He hesitates, then holds out a small card.It is painted in the old Sukhothai style and depicts a young man in combat, blood on his face, driving an opponent down into the ring.His features are stylized, but Jaidee can't help smiling at the sight of it."Where did you get this?""I was at the fight, Khun.In the village.I was only this big " he holds his hand up to his waist " only like this, perhaps.Maybe smaller. "He laughs self consciously."You made me want to be a fighter.When Dithakar knocked you down and your blood was everywhere, I thought you were finished.I didn't think you were big enough to take him.He had muscles" he trails off."I remember.It was a good fight. "The youth grins."Yes, Khun.Fabulous.I thought I wanted to be a fighter, too. ""And now look at you. "The boy runs his hand over his close cropped hair."Ah.Well.Fighting is harder than I thought but" He pauses."Would you sign it?The card?Please.I would like to give it to my father.He still speaks highly of your fights. "Jaidee smiles and signs."Dithakar was not the most clever fighter I ever faced, but he was strong.I wish all my fights were so clear cut. ""Captain Jaidee," a voice interrupts."If you are quite finished with your fans. "The young man wais and flees.Jaidee watches him run and thinks that perhaps not all of the younger generation is a waste.Perhaps Jaidee turns to face the general."He is just a boy. "Pracha glowers at Jaidee.Jaidee grins."And it's hardly my fault that I was a good fighter.The Ministry was my sponsor for those years.I think you won quite a lot of money and recruits because of me, Khun General, sir. ""Don't give me your 'General' nonsense.We've known each other too long for that.Get in here. ""Yes, sir. "Pracha grimaces and waves Jaidee into the office."In!"Pracha closes the door and goes to sit behind the expanse of his mahogany desk.Overhead, a crank fan beats desultorily at the air.The room is large, with shuttered windows open to allow light but little direct sun.The slits of the windows look out onto the Ministry's ragged grounds.On one wall are various paintings and photographs, including one with Pracha's graduating class of ministry cadets along with another of Chaiyanuchit, founder of their modern ministry.Another of Her Royal Majesty the Child Queen, looking tiny and terrifyingly vulnerable seated on her throne, and in a corner, a small shrine to Buddha, Phra Pikanet and Seub Nakhasathien.Incense and marigolds drape the shrine.Jaidee wais the shrine then finds himself a seat in a rattan chair across from Pracha."Where did you get that class photo?""What?"Pracha looks back."Ah.We were young, then, weren't we?I found it in my mother's belongings.She had it all these years, tucked away in a closet.Who would have guessed the old lady was so sentimental?""It's a nice thing to see. ""You overstepped yourself at the anchor pads. "Jaidee returns his attention to Pracha.Whisper sheets lie scattered on the desk, rustling under the breeze of the crank fan: Thai Rath.Kom Chad Luek.Phuchatkan Rai Wan.Many of them with photos of Jaidee on the cover."The newspapers don't think so. "Pracha scowls.He shoves the papers into a bin for composting."The papers love a hero.It sells copies.Don't believe these people who call you a tiger for fighting the farang.The farang are the key to our future. "Jaidee nods at the portrait of his mentor Chaiyanuchit hanging below the Queen's image."I am not certain that he would agree. ""Times change, old friend.People are hunting for your head. ""And you'll give it to them?"Pracha sighs."Jaidee, I've known you too long for this.I know you're a fighter.And I know you have a hot heart. "He holds up a hand as Jaidee stirs to protest."Yes, a good heart, also, just like your name, but still, jai rawn.Not a bit of jai yen in you.You relish the conflict. "He purses his lips."So I know that if I rein you in, you will fight.And if I punish you, you will fight. ""Then let me go about my business.The Ministry benefits from a loose cannon like me. ""People were offended by your action.And not just stupid farang.Not everyone who ships air cargo is farang, these days.Our interests reach far and wide.Thai interests. "Jaidee studies the general's desk."I wasn't aware that the Environment Ministry only inspected cargo at others' convenience. ""I am trying to reason with you.My hands are full with tigers: blister rust, weevil, the coal war, Trade Ministry infiltrators, yellow cards, greenhouse quotas, fa' gan outbreaks And yet you choose to add another. "Jaidee looks up."Who is it?""What do you mean?""Who is so angry that you're pissing your pants this way?Coming to ask me not to fight?It's Trade, yes?Someone in the Trade Ministry has you by the balls. "Pracha doesn't say anything for a moment."I don't know who it is.Better that you don't know, either.What you do not know, you cannot fight. "He slides a card across the desk."This arrived today, under my door. "His eyes lock on Jaidee so that Jaidee cannot look away."Right here in the office.Inside the compound, you understand?We are completely infiltrated. "Jaidee turns over the card.* * *   Niwat and Surat are good boys.Four and Six.Young men.Fighters already.Niwat once came home with a bloody nose and bright eyes and told Jaidee that he had fought honorably and been horribly beaten, but that he was going to train and he would take the heeya next time.Chaya despairs over this.She accuses Jaidee of filling their heads with impossible ideas.Surat follows Niwat and encourages him, tells Niwat he can't be beat.Tells him he is a tiger.The best of the best.That he will reign in Krung Thep, and bring honor to them all.Surat calls himself trainer and tells Niwat to hit harder next time.Niwat is not afraid of beatings.He is not afraid of anything.He is four.It is at times like these that Jaidee's heart breaks.Only once when he was in the muay thai ring was he afraid.But many times when he has worked, he has been terrified.Fear is part of him.Fear is part of the Ministry.What else but fear could close borders, burn towns, slaughter fifty thousand chickens and inter them wholesale under clean dirt and a thick powdering of lye?When the Thonburi virus hit, he and his men wore little rice paper masks that were no protection and they shoveled avian corpses into mass graves, while their fears swirled around them like phii.Could the virus really have come so far in such little time?Would it spread further?Would it continue to accelerate?Was this the virus that would finally finish them?He and his men were quarantined for thirty days while they waited to die, and fear was their only companion.Jaidee works for a ministry that cannot hold against all the threats it faces; he is afraid all the time.It is not fighting that he fears; it is not death; it is the waiting and uncertainty, and it breaks Jaidee's heart that Niwat knows nothing of the waiting terrors, and that the waiting terrors are all around them now.So many things can only be fought by waiting.Jaidee is a man of action.He fought in the ring.He wore his Seub luck amulets blessed by Ajahn Nopadon himself in the White Temple, and went forth.He carried only his black baton and quelled the nam riots of Katchanaburi single handed by striding into the crowd.And yet the only battles that matter are the waiting battles: when his father and mother succumbed to cibiscosis and coughed the meat of their lungs out between their teeth; when his sister and Chaya's sister both saw their hands thicken and crack with the cauliflower growths of fa' gan before the ministry stole the genetic map from the Chinese and manufactured a partial cure.They prayed every day to Buddha and practiced non attachment and hoped that their two sisters would find a better rebirth than this one that turned their fingers to clubs and chewed away at their joints.They prayed.And waited.It breaks Jaidee's heart that Niwat knows no fear, and that Surat trains him so.It breaks his heart that he cannot make himself intervene, and he curses himself for it.Why must he destroy childhood illusions of invincibility?Why him?He resents this role.Instead, he lets his children tackle him and roars, "Ahh, you are a tiger's sons!Too fierce!Too fierce by half!"And they are pleased and laugh and tackle him again, and he lets them win, and shows them tricks that he has learned since the ring, the tricks a fighter in the streets must know, where no combat is ritualized and where even a champion has things to learn.He teaches them how to fight, because it is all he knows.And the other thing the waiting thing is something he could never prepare them for, anyway.These are his thoughts as he turns over Pracha's card, as his own heart closes in on itself, like a block of stone falling inward, as though the center of himself is plunging down a well, dragging all his innards with him, leaving him hollow.Chaya.Curled against a wall, blindfolded, hands behind her back, ankles tied before her.On the wall, "All Respect to the Environment Ministry" is scrawled in brown letters that must be blood.There is a bruise on Chaya's cheek.She wears the same blue pha sin that she had on when she made him a breakfast of gaeng kiew wan and sent him on his way this morning with a laugh.He stares dumbly at the photo.His sons are fighters, but they do not know this warfare.He himself does not know how to skirmish like this.A faceless foe who reaches out to touch him on the throat, who strokes a demon claw along his jaw and whispers I can hurt you without ever showing its face, without ever presenting itself as an opponent at all.At first, Jaidee's voice doesn't work.Finally, he manages to croak, "Is she alive?"Pracha sighs."We don't know. ""Who did this?""I don't know. ""You must!""If we knew, we would already have her safe in hand!"Pracha rubs his face angrily, then glares at Jaidee."We've received so many complaints about you, from so many quarters, that we just don't know!It could be anyone. "A new terror seizes Jaidee."What about my sons?"He leaps to his feet."I have to "  "Sit down!"Pracha lunges across the desk and grabs him."We've sent men to their school.Your own men.Loyal to you only.The only ones we could trust.They're fine.They're being brought to the Ministry.You need to have a cool heart and consider your position.You want to keep this quiet.We don't want anyone to make sudden decisions.We want Chaya to come back to us whole and alive.Too much noise and someone will lose face and then her body will surely arrive in bloody pieces. "Jaidee stares at the photograph still lying on the desk.He stands and starts to pace."It has to be Trade. "His thinks back to the night at the anchor pads, the man, watching him and his white shirts from across the landing fields.Casual.Contemptuous.Spitting a stream of betel like blood and slipping into the darkness."It was Trade. ""It could have been farang, or the Dung Lord he never liked that you wouldn't fix fights.It could have been some other godfather, some jao por who lost money on a smuggling operation. ""None of them would stoop so low.It was Trade.There is a man "  "Stop!"Pracha slams his hand on his desk."Everyone would like to stoop so low!You've made a lot of enemies very quickly.I've even had a chaopraya peer from the palace complaining.It could be anyone. ""You blame me for this?"Pracha sighs."There's no point in assigning blame.It's done now.You made enemies; I allowed you. "He puts his head in his hands."We need you to make a public apology.Something to appease them. ""I won't. ""Won't?"Pracha laughs bitterly."Put away that foolish pride of yours. "He fingers the picture of Chaya."What do you think their next move will be?We haven't had heeya like this since the last Expansion.Money at any cost.Wealth at any price. "He makes a face."Right now, we may still be able to get her back.But if you continue?"He shakes his head."They will surely slaughter her.They are animals."You will make a public apology for your actions at the anchor pads and you will be demoted.You will be transferred, probably to the south to process yellow cards and handle internments down there. "He sighs and studies the picture again."And if we are very very careful, and very lucky, perhaps you will get Chaya back."Don't look at me that way, Jaidee.If you were still in the muay thai ring, I would place every baht I own on you.But this is a different sort of fight. "Pracha leans forward, nearly begging."Please.Do what I say.Bow before these winds. "12  How was Hock Seng to know that the tamade anchor pads would be shut down?How was he to know that all his bribes would be wasted by the Tiger of Bangkok?Hock Seng grimaces at the memory of his meeting with Mr.Lake.Of crouching before that pale monster as though he were some sort of god, kowtowing obeisance while the creature shouted and swore and rained newspapers down on his head, all of them with Jaidee Rojjanasukchai on their front pages.The Tiger of Bangkok, a curse in his own right, as bad as one of the Thais' demons."Khun " Hock Seng tried to protest, but Mr.Lake cut him off."You told me you had everything arranged!"he shouted."Give me one good reason why I shouldn't fire you!"Hock Seng huddled under the assault, forcing himself not to fight back.Tried to be reasonable."Khun, everyone lost material.This is the doing of Carlyle & Sons.Mr.Carlyle is too close to Trade Minister Akkarat.He is always goading the white shirts.Always insulting them "  "Don't change the subject!The algae tanks should have cleared Customs last week.You told me you paid the bribes.And now I find out you were keeping money back.This wasn't Carlyle, this was you.Your fault. ""Khun, it was the Tiger of Bangkok.He is a natural disaster.An earthquake, a tsunami.You cannot blame me for not knowing "  "I'm tired of being lied to.You think because I'm farang that I'm stupid?That I don't see how you work the books?How you manipulate and lie and sneak "  "I do not lie "  "I don't care about your explanations and excuses!Your words are shit!I don't care what you say.I don't care what you think, what you feel, what you say.All I care about is results.Bring the line up to forty percent reliability within the month, or go back to the yellow card towers.That's your choice.You have a month before I fire your ass and find another manager. ""Khun "  "Do you understand?"Hock Seng stared bitterly at the floor, glad the creature couldn't see his expression."Of course Lake Xiansheng, I understand.It will be as you say. "Before he had even finished speaking, the foreign devil was stalking out of the office, leaving Hock Seng behind.It was enough of an insult that Hock Seng considered pouring acid on the great safe and simply stealing the factory plans.In his white hot rage, he got as far as the supply cabinets before good sense reined him in.If harm befell the factory, or the safe were robbed, suspicion would fall to him first.And if he ever hopes to forge a life in this new country, he cannot have any more blackness attached to his name.The white shirts need few excuses to revoke a yellow card.To kick a beggar Chinese back across the border and into the hands of fundamentalists.He must be patient.He must survive in this tamade factory for another day.So instead, Hock Seng lashes the employees forward, approves repairs that bleed more money, uses even his own carefully embezzled stores of cash to grease the skids so that Mr.Lake's demands will not escalate, so that the tamade foreign devil will not destroy him.They run tests on the line, rip up old drive links, canvass the city for teak that can be repurposed as a spindle.He has Laughing Chan offering a bounty to every yellow card in the city for rumors of old Expansion properties that may have crumbled and revealed structural items worth harvesting.Anything that will allow them to bring the line back to full production before the monsoons finally pour down and make river transport of a new teak spindle practicable.Hock Seng grinds his teeth with frustration.Everything is so close to fruition.And yet now his survival depends on a line that never worked and on people who have never been successful.It's almost enough for Hock Seng to attempt a little arm twisting of his own.To tell the tamade devil that he knows something of Mr.Lake's extracurricular life, thanks to the reports of Lao Gu.That he knows every place Mr.Lake has visited, of his trips to libraries and old family homes in Bangkok.Of his fascination with seeds.And now this strangest, most astonishing thing.The news that sent Lao Gu scurrying to Hock Seng as soon as it occurred.A windup girl.An illegal piece of genetic trash.A girl that Mr.Lake pursues as if he is drunk on the transgression.Lao Gu whispers that Mr.Lake brings the creature to his bed.Does so repeatedly.Pines for it.Astonishing.Disgusting.Useful.But a weapon to be used as a last resort, if Mr.Lake attempts to truly eject him from the factory.Better to have Lao Gu watching and listening and gathering more information than revealed and fired.When Hock Seng first arranged Lao Gu's employment, it was for just this sort of possibility.He must not waste this one bit of leverage just because he is angry.And so instead, even as his face feels as if it has been thrown on the floor, Hock Seng jumps like a monkey to make the foreign devil happy.Hock Seng grimaces as he crosses the factory floor, following Kit to another point of complaint.Problems.Always more problems.All around them, the activity of repair echoes.Half the power train has been torn out of the floor and reset.Nine Buddhist monks chant steadily at the far side of the building, stretching the Thais' sacred thread that they call saisin everywhere and imploring the spirits that infest the place half of them likely Contraction phii who are angered that the Thais are working for farang at all begging them to allow the factory to work correctly.Hock Seng grimaces at the sight of monks and the expenses he is incurring."What's this new problem?"Hock Seng asks as they squeeze past the cutting presses and duck under the line."It's here, Khun.I'll show you," Kit says.The salty warm stink of algae thickens, a humid reek that hangs heavy in the air.Kit points to the algae tanks where they stand in damp ranks, three dozen open surface breeding vats.Their waters are coated with the rich green skim of algae breeding.A worker is dragging her net across the surface of the tanks, drawing off the skim.She smears it across a man sized screen before hoisting it up on hemp ropes to hang overhead with the hundreds of similar screens."It's the tanks. "Kit says."They are contaminated. ""Yes?"Hock Seng eyes the tanks, hiding his distaste."What is the difficulty?"With the healthiest vats, the skim is more than six inches thick, a pillowy vibrant chlorophyll green.The voluptuous scent of seawater and life emanates from them.Water trickles down the sides of the translucent tanks, thin lines that damp the floor and leave salty white blooms as they evaporate.Streamers of still living algae trail down drain channels to rusty iron grates and disappear into darkness.Pig DNA and something else flax, Hock Seng thinks.It was flax that Mr.Yates always believed had been the key to this algae.That made it produce such useful skim.But Hock Seng always liked the pig proteins.Pigs are lucky.This algae should be, also.And yet it has caused nothing but trouble, despite its potential.Kit smiles nervously as he shows Hock Seng how several of the tanks have lowered levels of algae production, an off color skim, and a fishy reek, something more akin to shrimp paste than the verdant salty smells of the more active tanks."Banyat said they should not be used.That we should wait until the replacement supplies came. "Hock Seng laughs harshly and shakes his head."We won't have any replacements.Not with the Tiger of Bangkok burning everything that comes off the anchor pads.You'll have to make do with what we have. ""But it's contaminated.There are potential vectors.The problem could spread into the other tanks. ""You're certain of that?""Banyat said "  "Banyat walked under a megodont.And if we don't have this line running soon, the farang will be sending us all out to starve. ""But "  "You think another fifty Thais wouldn't like your job?A thousand yellow cards?"Kit closes his mouth.Hock Seng nods grimly."Make this line work. ""If the white shirts inspect us, they will see that the baths are impure. "Kit runs his finger through a gray froth coating the rim of one of the tanks."We shouldn't be seeing this.The algae should be much brighter.None of this bubbling. "Hock Seng studies the tanks sourly."If we don't get the line running we all starve. "He's about to say more, but the girl Mai runs into the room."Khun.A man has come looking for you. "Hock Seng gives her an impatient look."Is it someone with information on a new spindle?A teak log ripped from some temple bot, maybe?"Mai's mouth opens and closes, stunned at his blasphemy, but Hock Seng doesn't care."If this man doesn't have a winding spindle, I don't have time for him. "He turns back to Kit."Can you drain and scrub the tanks perhaps?"Kit shrugs noncommittally."It can be tried, Khun, but Banyat said that if we don't have new nutrient cultures, we can't start completely fresh.We will be forced to reuse the cultures that come from these same tanks.The problem will likely return. ""We can't sieve it?Filter somehow?""The tanks and cultures cannot be fully cleaned.Eventually it will be a vector.And the rest of the tanks will be contaminated. ""Eventually?Is that all?Eventually?"Hock Seng scowls at him."I don't care about 'eventually. 'I care about this month.If this factory fails to produce, we won't have a chance to worry about this 'eventually' you speak of.You'll be back in Thonburi, picking through chicken guts and hoping you aren't hit with flu, and I'll be back in a yellow card tower.Don't worry about tomorrow.Worry about whether Mr.Lake throws us all out on the street today.Use your imagination.Find a way to make this tamade algae breed. "Not for the first time, he curses that he works with Thais.They simply lack the spirit of entrepreneurship that a Chinese would throw into the work."Khun?"It's Mai, still lingering.She flinches at his glare."The man says that this is your last chance. ""My last chance?Show me this heeya. "Hock Seng storms toward the main floor, shoving aside the curtains of the fining rooms.Out in the main hall, where the megodonts lean against spindle cranks burning money that they simply don't have, Hock Seng stops short, wiping algae fines from his hands, feeling like a terrified fool.Dog Fucker stands in the middle of the factory like cibiscosis in the middle of Spring Festival, watching the whir and clatter of the QA line as it runs through tests.Old Bones and Horseface Ma and Dog Fucker.All of them standing so confidently.Dog Fucker, with his fa' gan fringe and his missing nose, and his thug cronies, hard edged nak leng who have no pity for yellow cards and no fear of police.It's only dumb luck that Mr.Lake is upstairs going over the books, only dumb luck that little Mai came to him and not to the foreign devil.Mai scampers ahead, leading him toward his future.Hock Seng motions for Dog Fucker to join him out of sight of the observation windows above, but Dog Fucker, maddeningly, sets his feet and continues to study the rumbling line and the shamble of the megodonts."Very impressive," he says."Is this where you make your fabulous kink springs?"Hock Seng glares and motions for him to move out of the factory."We should not be having this conversation here. "Dog Fucker ignores him.His eyes are on the offices and the observation windows.He stares up at them intently."And is that where you do your work?Up there?""Not for long, if a certain farang catches sight of you. "Hock Seng forces himself to make a polite smile."Please.It would be better if we went outside.Your presence arouses questions. "For a long moment, Dog Fucker doesn't move, still staring up at the offices.Hock Seng has the unnerving feeling that the man sees through the walls, that he sees the huge iron safe sitting up there, holding its valuable secrets tight."Please," Hock Seng mutters."The workers will speak enough about this as it is. "Abruptly the gangster turns away, nodding to his men to follow.Hock Seng stifles a rush of relief as he hurries after them."Someone wants to see you," Dog Fucker says, gesturing toward the outer gates.The Dung Lord.Now, of all times.Hock Seng glances up at the observation window.Mr.Lake will be angry if he leaves."Yes.Of course. "Hock Seng motions back toward the office."I will just tidy my papers. ""Now," Dog Fucker says."No one keeps him waiting. "He motions for Hock Seng to follow."Now or never. "Hock Seng hesitates, torn, then waves for Mai.She dashes up as Dog Fucker leads them toward the gates.Hock Seng leans low and whispers."Tell Khun Anderson that I will not be returning that I have an idea of where to locate a new winding spindle. "He nods sharply."Yes.Tell him that.A winding spindle. "Mai nods and starts to turn away, but Hock Seng pulls her back, pulls her close."Remember to speak slowly, and in simple words.I don't want the farang to misunderstand and put me out on the street.If I go, so do you.Remember that. "Mai grins."Mai pen rai.I will make him very happy that you are working so hard. "She dashes back into the factory.Dog Fucker smiles over his shoulder."And I thought you were only the king of yellow cards.Here you have a pretty Thai girl doing your bidding, too.Not bad for a Yellow Card King. "Hock Seng makes a face."The king of yellow cards is not a title to aspire to. ""Nor the Lord of Dung," he says."Names hide much. "He surveys the compound."I've never been in a farang factory," he says."It's very impressive.A lot of money here. "Hock Seng forces a smile."The farang are crazy with how much they spend. "His neck prickles at the workers' eyes watching him.He wonders how many of them know of Dog Fucker.For once he is grateful that more yellow card Chinese don't work at the factory.They would recognize in an instant who he treats with.Hock Seng forces down the irritation and fear he feels at the exposure.Of course Dog Fucker would like to see him off balance.It is part of the bargaining process.You are Tan Hock Seng, head of the New Tri Clipper.Do not let petty tactics unsettle you.This mantra of self assurance lasts until they reach the outer gates.Hock Seng stops short.Dog Fucker laughs as he opens the door for Hock Seng."What's the matter?You've never seen a car before?"Hock Seng stifles an urge to slap the man for his arrogance and stupidity."You're a fool," he mutters."Do you know how this exposes me?How people will speak of an extravagance like this, parked in front of this factory?"He ducks inside.Dog Fucker climbs in after him, still grinning.The rest of his men crowd in after.Old Bones calls forward to the driver.The machine's engine rumbles to life.They start to roll."Is it coal diesel?"Hock Seng asks.He can't help whispering.Dog Fucker grins."The boss does so much for the carbon load" He shrugs."This is a small extravagance. ""But the cost" Hock Seng trails off.The exorbitant cost of turning this steel behemoth into acceleration.An extraordinary waste.A testament to the Dung Lord's monopolies.Even in his wealthiest days in Malaya, Hock Seng would never have considered such an extravagance.Despite the heat in the car, he shivers.There is an ancient solidity to the thing, so heavy and massive it might as well be a tank.It's as if he's locked inside one of SpringLife's safes, isolated from the world beyond.Claustrophobia swallows him.Dog Fucker smiles as Hock Seng tries to master his emotions."I hope you aren't wasting his time," he says.Hock Seng makes himself meet Dog Fucker's gaze."I think you would like it better if I failed. ""You're right. "Dog Fucker shrugs."If it were up to me, we would have let your kind die on the other side of the border. "The car accelerates, pressing Hock Seng into the leather seat.Outside the windows, Krung Thep slides past, utterly removed from him: crowds of sun drenched skin and dusty draft animals and bicycles like schools of fish.Eyes turn toward the car as it forges past.Mouths open wide and silent as people shout and point at his passage.The speed of the machine is appalling.* * *   Yellow cards crowd around the tower entrances, Malayan Chinese men and women trying to look hopeful as they wait for labor opportunities that have already faded in the heat of the afternoon.And yet still they try to look vital, try to show that their bony limbs have calories to spare, if only someone will allow them to burn.Everyone stares as the Dung Lord's car arrives.When the door opens, they kneel in a wave, all of them performing khrabs of abasement, triple bows to the patron who keeps them housed, the one man in Krung Thep who willingly shoulders the burden of them, who provides a measure of safety from the red machetes of the Malays and the black batons of the white shirts.Hock Seng's eyes slide over yellow card backs, wondering if he knows any of them, momentarily surprised that he is not among them performing his own khrab of obeisance.Dog Fucker leads him into the tower darkness.The skitter of rats and the smell of close packed sweating bodies convects down from the floors above.At a pair of gaping elevator shafts he flips open a tarnished brass speaking tube and shouts with brisk authority.They wait, eyes on one another: Dog Fucker bored; Hock Seng carefully hiding anxiety.A rattling comes from above, gears clicking, the scrape of iron on stone.A lift sinks into view.Dog Fucker drags open the gate and steps in.The woman at the elevator controls disengages the brake and shouts into the speaking tube before yanking the gate closed again.Dog Fucker smiles through the gate."Wait here, yellow card. "And then he is whisked up into darkness.A minute later, ballast men slide into view in the secondary shaft.They squeeze out of the lift and dash for the stairwell in a herd.One of them catches sight of Hock Seng.Mistakes his look."There aren't any more places.He has enough of us already. "Hock Seng shakes his head."No.Of course not," he mutters, but the men are already disappearing back up the stairs, sandals slapping as they scramble for the sky to make the ballast drop again.From where he stands inside the building, the glare of the tropics is a distant rectangle, clotted with refugees, all watching the street with nothing to do and nowhere to go.A few yellow cards shuffle the halls.Babies cry, their small voices echoing against hot concrete.From somewhere above, the grunt of sex comes.People screwing in halls like animals, out in the open because they have given up on privacy.It is all so familiar.Extraordinary that he once lived in this same building, sweltered in this same pen.Minutes tick by.Perhaps the Dung Lord has changed his mind.Dog Fucker should have returned by now.Movement catches the corner of Hock Seng's eye and he flinches, but there is nothing but shadow.Sometimes he dreams that the Green Headbands have become cheshires, that they can molt and appear where he least expects them while he pours water over his head as he makes his bath, or as he eats a bowl of rice, or squats over the latrine they simply shimmer into existence and grab him and gut him and stack his head on the streets as a warning.Just like Jade Blossom and First Wife's elder sister.Just like his sons  The lift rattles.A moment later Dog Fucker descends.The elevator woman is gone, Dog Fucker's own hand runs the brake system."Good.You didn't run away. ""I'm not afraid of this place. "Dog Fucker gives him an appraising look."No.Of course not.You came from it, didn't you?"He steps out and motions toward the tower dimness.Guards materialize where Hock Seng thought only shadows existed.He forces himself not yelp, but Dog Fucker still catches his twitch.Smiles at it."Search him. "Hands pat Hock Seng's ribs, run down his legs, prod at his genitals.When the guards are finished, Dog Fucker gestures Hock Seng into the lift.He guesses the heft of them and shouts up the speaking tube.From high above, the rattle of men climbing into the ballast cage filters down.And then they are rising, climbing up through the layers of hell.The heat thickens.Deep in the heart of the building, exposed as it is to the full force of the tropic sun, it is an oven.Hock Seng remembers sleeping in the stairwells here, struggling to breathe as the bodies of his fellow refugees stank and rolled about him.Remembers how his belly pressed against his spine.And then, all in a rush he remembers blood on his hands, hot and alive.A fellow yellow card, reaching out to him, begging for aid, even as he drove the knife edge of his whiskey bottle into the man's throat.Hock Seng closes his eyes, forcing away memory.You were starving.There was no other way.But he has a hard time convincing himself.They continue to rise.A breeze caresses him.The air cools.Scents of hibiscus and citrus.An open hall flashes by a promenade, exposed to the city air, careful gardens, lime trees bordering the edges of wide balconies.Hock Seng wonders at the amount of water men must carry to this height.Wonders at the calories that must be spent and the man who has access to such power.It's both thrilling and terrifying.He is close.So very close.They reach the top of the building.The sun drenched expanse of the city spreads before them.The gold spires of the Grand Palace where the Child Queen holds court and the Somdet Chaopraya pulls the strings, the chedi of Mongkut's temple on its hill, the only thing that will survive if the levees fail.The broken and tumbling spires of the old Expansion.And all around, the sea."It's a good view, isn't it, yellow card?"Across the wide roof, a white pavilion has been erected.It rustles gently in salt breezes.Under its shade, in a rattan chair, the Dung Lord sprawls.The man is fat.Fatter than anyone Hock Seng has seen since Pearl Koh in Malaya cornered the market on blister rust resistant durian.Perhaps not as fat as Ah Deng who ran a sweet stand in Penang, but still, the man is astonishingly fat, given the privations of the calorie economy.Hock Seng approaches slowly, wais, lowering his head until his chin touches his chest and his pressed palms are nearly above his head with the respect he shows the man.The fat man regards Hock Seng."You wish to treat with me?"Hock Seng's throat catches.He nods.The man waits, patient.A servant brings cold sweet coffee and offers it to the Dung Lord.He takes a sip."Are you thirsty?"he asks.Hock Seng has the presence of mind to shake his head.The Dung Lord shrugs.Sips again.Says nothing.Four servants in white suits shuffle over, carrying a linen draped table.They set the table before him.The Dung Lord nods to Hock Seng."Come now, don't worry about being polite.Eat.Drink. "A chair is produced for him.The Dung Lord offers Hock Seng wide fried U Tex noodles, a crab and green papaya salad, along with laab mu, gaeng gai, and steamed U Tex.Along with it all, he offers a plate of sliced papaya."Don't be afraid.The chicken is latest generip and the papaya are just picked, from my eastern plantation.Not a trace of blister rust in the last two seasons. ""How ?""We burn any trees that show the disease and those around them as well.Also, we have widened our buffer perimeter to five kilometers.With UV sterilization, it seems to be enough. ""Ah. "The Dung Lord nods at the small kink spring, sitting on the table."A gigajoule?"Hock Seng nods."And you have them to sell?"Hock Seng shakes his head."The way of making them. ""What makes you think I am a buyer?"Hock Seng shrugs, forcing himself to hide his nervousness.There was a time when this sort of bargaining was easy for him.Second nature.But he wasn't desperate then."If you are not, then there are others. "The Dung Lord nods.Finishes his coffee.A servant pours more."And why do you come to me?""Because you are rich. "The Dung Lord laughs at that.He nearly spits out his coffee.His belly rolls and his body shakes.The servants freeze, watchful.When the Dung Lord finally controls his laughter, he wipes his mouth and shakes his head."A fair answer, that. "His smile disappears."But I am also dangerous. "Hock Seng buries his nervousness and speaks directly."When the rest of the Kingdom would have rejected our kind, you took us in.Not even our own people, the Thai Chinese, were so generous.Her Royal Majesty the Queen showed mercy, allowing us to come across the border, but it was you who provided safe haven. "The Dung Lord shrugs."No one uses these towers anyway. ""And yet you are the only one who showed compassion.An entire country full of good Buddhist people, and only you gave shelter, instead of forcing us back across the border.I would be dead by now if not for you. "The Dung Lord studies Hock Seng a moment longer."My advisors thought it was foolish.That it would put me in opposition with the white shirts.Set me at odds with General Pracha.Maybe even threaten my methane deals. "Hock Seng nods."Only you had enough influence to risk it. ""And what do you want for this wondrous bit of technology?"Hock Seng readies himself."A ship. "The Dung Lord looks up, surprised."Not money?Not jade?Not opium?"Hock Seng shakes his head."A ship.A fast clipper.Mishimoto designed.Registered and approved to transport cargo to the Kingdom and throughout the South China Sea.Under the protection of her Majesty the Queen" He waits a beat."And your patronage. ""Ah.Clever yellow card. "The Dung Lord smiles."And I thought you were truly grateful. "Hock Seng shrugs."You are the only person who has the influence to provide such permits and guarantees. ""The only one who can make a yellow card truly legitimate, you mean.The only one who could convince white shirts to allow a yellow card shipping king to develop. "Hock Seng doesn't blink."Your union lights the city.Your influence is unparalleled. "Unexpectedly, the Dung Lord forces himself out of his seat, stands."Yes.Well.So it is. "He turns and shambles across the patio to the edge of his terrace, hands behind his back, surveying the city below."Yes.I suppose I still have strings I can pull.Ministers I can influence. "He turns back."You're asking for a lot. ""I give even more. ""And if you're selling this to more than one?"Hock Seng shakes his head."I do not need a fleet.I need one ship. ""Tan Hock Seng, seeking to restore his shipping empire here in the Thai Kingdom" The Dung Lord turns abruptly."Maybe you've already sold it to others. ""I can only swear that it is not so. ""Would you swear on your ancestors?On your family's ghosts all walking hungry in Malaya?"Hock Seng shifts uneasily."I would. ""I want to see this technology you claim. "Hock Seng looks up surprised."You haven't already started to wind it?""Why don't you demonstrate now?"Hock Seng grins."You're afraid it is a booby trap of some sort?A blade bomb maybe?"He laughs."I do not play games.I come for business only. "He looks around."You have a winding man?Let us both see how many joules he can put into it.Wind it and see.But do be careful with it.It is not as resilient as a standard spring, because of the torque it operates under.It cannot be dropped. "He points at a servant."You there, put this spring on your winding spindle, see how many joules you can shove into it. "The servant looks uncertain.The Dung Lord nods agreement.A sea breeze rustles across the high garden as the young man sets the kink spring on its spindle and settles on the winding cycle.Hock Seng is suddenly seized by new worry.He confirmed with Banyat that he was taking one of the good springs, that it had passed QA, unlike the ones that always failed and cracked as soon as they started their winding.Banyat assured him that he should take one from a certain stack.But now, as the servant prepares to lean on his pedals, doubt flares.If he chose wrong, if Banyat was wrong and now Banyat is dead under the feet of a crazed megodont.Hock Seng couldn't confirm one last time.He was sure and yet  The servant leans against the pedals.Hock Seng holds his breath.Sweat appears on the servant's brow and he looks over at Hock Seng and the Dung Lord, surprised at the resistance.He changes gears.The pedals turn, slowly at first, then faster.He begins cycling up through the gears as his momentum increases, jamming more and more energy into the kink spring.The Dung Lord watches thoughtfully."I knew a man who worked at your kink spring company.A few years ago.He didn't spread his wealth around as you do.Didn't curry favor with so many of his fellow yellow cards. "He pauses."I understand that the white shirts killed him for his watch.Beat him bloody, robbed him blind, right in the street, because he was out after curfew. "Hock Seng shrugs, forcing down memories of a man lying on cobbles, a ruined mess, broken already, begging for help  The Dung Lord's eyes are thoughtful."And now you work for this company as well.It seems like an unlikely coincidence. "Hock Seng doesn't say anything.The Dung Lord says, "Dog Fucker should have paid more attention.You're a dangerous one. "Hock Seng shakes his head emphatically."I only wish to reestablish myself. "The servant continues to pedal, cranking more joules into the spring, forcing more energy into the tiny box.The Dung Lord watches, trying to hide his astonishment as the process continues, but still, his eyes have widened.Already the servant has pushed more energy into the box than any spring its size should accept.The cycle whines as the servant pedals.Hock Seng says, "It will take all night for a man like this to wind it.You should take it to a megodont. ""How does it work?"Hock Seng shrugs."There is a new lubricating solution, it allows the springs to be tightened to significantly higher tensions, without breaking or locking. "The man continues to pour power into the spring.Servants and bodyguards begin to gather around, all of them watching with a certain awe as he cranks away at the box."Astonishing," the Dung Lord mutters."If you chain it to a more efficient animal a megodont or a mulie the calorie to joule transfer is nearly lossless," Hock Seng says.The Dung Lord watches the spring as the man continues to wind.He is smiling."We'll test your spring, Hock Seng.If it performs as well as it winds, you'll have your ship.Bring the specifications and blueprints.Your kind I can do business with. "He motions to a servant and orders liquor."A toast.To a new business partner. "Relief floods through Hock Seng.For the first time since blood washed his hands in an alley long ago, since a man begged for mercy and found none, liquor flows in Hock Seng's veins, and he is content.13  Jaidee remembers when he first met Chaya.He had just finished one of his early muay thai bouts; he can't even remember who he competed against but he remembers coming out of the ring, people congratulating him, everyone saying that he moved better even than Nai Khanom Tom.He drank laolao that night, and then stumbled out into the streets with his friends, all of them laughing, trying to kick a takraw ball, drunk, absurd, and all of them flushed with victory and with life.And there Chaya was, closing her parents' shop, propping up the wooden panels that secured the storefront where they sold marigolds and newly reengineered jasmine flowers for temple offerings.When he smiled at her, she gave him and his drunk friends a look of disgust.But Jaidee felt a shock of recognition as if they had known one another in a past life, and were at last meeting again, fated lovers.He had stared at her, stunned, and his friends had caught the look Suttipong and Jaiporn and all the rest, all of them lost when the violet comb epidemic hit and they went into the breach to burn the villages where it had struck, all of them gone but he remembers them all catching him staring, suddenly stupid with infatuation, and how they teased him.Chaya looked at him with a studied contempt and sent him stumbling away.For Jaidee, it had always been easy to attract a girlfriend, some girl either pleased by his muay thai or his white uniform.But Chaya had simply looked through him and turned her back.It took him a month to get up the nerve to return.That first time, he dressed well, shopped for temple offerings, took his change, and slipped out silently.Over the course of weeks he dropped by, talking with her more, establishing a connection.At first, he thought that she knew him for the drunken fool trying to make amends, but over time it became apparent that she had not made the connection, that the arrogant drunk on the streets that night had been completely forgotten.Jaidee never told her how they first met, not even after they were married.It was too humiliating to admit to what she had seen in him that night on the street.To tell her that the man she loved was that other fool as well.And now he prepares to do something worse.He puts on his white dress uniform while Niwat and Surat watch.They are solemn as he prepares to bring himself low in their eyes.He kneels before them."Whatever you see today, do not let it shame you. "They nod solemnly, but he knows they do not understand.They are too young to understand pressures and necessity.He pulls them close, and then he goes out into blinding sunlight.Kanya awaits him in a cycle rickshaw, compassion in her eyes, even if she is too polite to speak what is in her heart.They ride silently through the streets.The Ministry appears ahead and they ride through the gates.Servants and rickshaw men and carriages clog the outer gates, waiting for their patrons to return.The witnesses have already been arriving, then.Their own rickshaw makes its way to the temple.Wat Phra Seub was erected inside the Ministry in honor of the biodiversity martyr.It is the place where white shirts make their vows and are formally ordained as protectors of the Kingdom, before they are given their first ranks.It is here that they receive their ordination, and it is here   Jaidee starts, and nearly jumps to his feet in anger.Farang are milling all around the temple's steps.Foreigners inside the Ministry compound.Traders and factory owners and Japanese, sunburned sweating stinking creatures, invading the Ministry's most sacred place."Jai yen yen," Kanya mutters."It's Akkarat's doing.Part of the bargain. "Jaidee can't hide his disgust.Worse yet, Akkarat is standing beside the Somdet Chaopraya, saying something to him, telling a joke, perhaps.The two of them have become too close by far.Jaidee looks away and sees General Pracha watching from the top of the temple steps, his face expressionless.Around him, the brothers and sisters that Jaidee has worked with and warred with are all streaming into the temple.Bhirombhakdi is there, smiling widely, pleased to have his revenge for his lost revenue.People catch sight of Jaidee's arrival.A hush overtakes the crowd."Jai yen yen," Kanya murmurs again, and then they are climbing down and he is being escorted inside.Golden statues of Buddha and Phra Seub gaze down on the assembling people, serene.The screens on the temple walls portray scenes of the fall of Old Thailand: The farang releasing their plagues on the earth, animals and plants collapsing as their food webs unravelled; his Royal Majesty King Rama XII mustering his final pitiful human forces, flanked by Hanuman and his monkey warriors.Images of Krut and Kirimukha and an army of half human kala fighting back the rising seas and plagues.Jaidee's eyes sweep over the panels, remembering how proud he had been at his own ordination.No cameras are allowed anywhere inside the Ministry, but the whisper sheet scribblers are there with their pencils.Jaidee removes his shoes and enters, followed by the jackals who slaver after this rendering down of their greatest enemy.The Somdet Chaopraya kneels beside Akkarat.Jaidee eyes the designated protector of the Queen, wondering how someone as divine as the last king could have been fooled into making the Somdet Chaopraya the protector of Her Royal Majesty the Child Queen.The man has so little that is good.Jaidee shivers at the thought of the Queen so close to someone so well known for his darkness   Jaidee sucks in his breath.The man from the anchor pads is kneeling beside Akkarat.A long rat face, watchful and arrogant."Cool heart," Kanya mutters again as she leads him forward."It's for Chaya. "Jaidee forces down his rage, the shock of seeing the man.He leans close to Kanya."That's the one who took her.The one from the airfields.Right there!Beside Akkarat. "Kanya scans the faces."Even if it is true, we must do this.It's the only way. ""Do you truly believe that?"Kanya has the grace to duck her head."I am sorry, Jaidee.I wish "  "Don't worry, Kanya. "He nods toward the man and Akkarat."Just remember those two.Remember that they will stop at nothing for power. "He looks at her."Will you remember that?""I will. ""You swear on Phra Seub?"She has the grace to look embarrassed, but she nods."If I could perform the triple bow before you, I would. "He thinks he sees tears in her eyes as she backs away.The crowd hushes as the Somdet Chaopraya stands and steps forward to witness the proceedings.Four monks begin to chant.On happier occasions, they would be seven or nine in number, and consecrating a wedding, or blessing the laying of a new building's cornerstone.Instead they are here to oversee a humiliation.Minister Akkarat and General Pracha go to stand before the assembled people.Incense fills the room along with the monk's chanting, a drone in Pali as they remind everyone that all is transient, that even Phra Seub in his despair recognized transience, even as his compassion for the natural world overwhelmed him.The chanting of the monks dies.The Somdet Chaopraya motions for both Akkarat and Pracha to come before him.To khrab and make obeisance.The Somdet Chaopraya watches without emotion as the two ancient enemies pay their respects to the only thing that binds them together: their respect for royalty and the palace.The Somdet Chaopraya is a tall man, well fed, and he towers over them.His face is hard.Rumors circle around him, about his tastes, about his darkness, but still, he is the one designated to protect Her Majesty the Child Queen until her ascension.He is not royalty, could never be so, and it terrifies Jaidee that she lives within his circle of influence.If it weren't for the fact that the man's own fate is tied so tightly to hers, he would probably Jaidee stifles the nearly blasphemous thought as Pracha and Akkarat approach.Jaidee kneels.Around him, whisper sheet pencils scratch frantically as he performs a khrab before Akkarat.Akkarat smiles with satisfaction and Jaidee stifles an urge to lunge at the man.I will pay you back in my own time.He stands carefully.Akkarat leans close."Well done, Captain.I almost believe you really are sorry. "Jaidee keeps his features impassive, turns to address the people, the scribblers his heart closes as he sees that his sons are present, brought to witness the humiliation of their father."I have overstepped my authority. "His eyes go to General Pracha, watching coldly from the edge of the dais, "I have dishonored my patron, General Pracha, and I have dishonored the Environment Ministry."All my life, the Ministry has been my home.I am ashamed that I have selfishly used its powers for my own benefit.That I have mislead my fellow officers, and my patrons.That I have been bankrupt morally. "He hesitates.Niwat and Surat are watching, held by their grandmother, Chaya's mother, all of them watching as he humiliates himself."I beg forgiveness.I beg an opportunity to rectify my wrongs. "General Pracha strides toward him.Jaidee drops again to his knees and makes a khrab of submission before him.General Pracha ignores, him, walks past his bowing face, his feet within inches of Jaidee's head.Speaks to the assembly."An independent investigating tribunal has determined that Captain Jaidee is guilty of accepting bribes, of corruption and the abuse of his powers. "He glances down at Jaidee."It has further been determined that he is no longer fit for service with the Ministry.He will become a monk, and perform a penance of nine years.His possessions will be disposed of.His sons will be adopted into the care of the Ministry, but their family name will be erased. "He looks down at Jaidee."If the Buddha is merciful, you will eventually come to understand that your pride and avarice has brought this upon you.We hope that if you do not attain understanding in this life, that your next one will provide you with hope of improvement. "He turns away, leaving Jaidee still in his bow.Akkarat speaks, "We accept the apologies of the Environment Ministry and the failures of General Pracha.We look forward to an improved working relationship in the future.Now that this snake has had its fangs pulled. "The Somdet Chaopraya motions to the two great powers of the government that they should show one another respect.Jaidee remains crouched.A sigh runs through the crowd.And then people are streaming out, to tell of what they have seen.Only once the Somdet Chaopraya is gone is Jaidee invited to stand by a pair of monks.Their aspect is serious, their heads shaven, their saffron robes aged and faded.They indicate to him where they will take him next.He is theirs now.Nine years of penance, for doing the right thing.Akkarat steps before him."Well, Khun Jaidee.It seems that you have at last discovered limits.It's a pity you didn't listen to warnings.All of this was so unnecessary. "Jaidee forces himself to wai."You have what you wanted," he mutters."Now let Chaya go. ""So sorry.I don't know what you're talking about. "Jaidee searches the man's eyes, hunting for the lie, but he can't tell.Are you my enemy?Or is it another?Is she dead already?Is she still alive, trapped in one of your friends' prison cells, an unnamed prisoner?Alive or dead?He forces down his worries."Bring her back, or I'll hunt you down and kill you like a mongoose killing a cobra. "Akkarat doesn't flinch."Careful with the threats, Jaidee.I'd hate to see you lose anything else. "His eyes stray toward Niwat and Surat.A chill runs through Jaidee."Stay away from my children. ""Your children?"Akkarat laughs."You have no children now.You have nothing at all.You're lucky that General Pracha is your friend.If I were him, I would have turned those two boys of yours out into the street to beg for blister rust scraps.That would have been a true lesson. "14  Crushing the Tiger of Bangkok should be more satisfying.But frankly, without a cue card of the various names involved, the ceremony looks like any number of impenetrable Thai religious and social events.In fact, the man's actual demotion is surprisingly quick.Within twenty minutes of being ushered into the Environment Ministry's temple, Anderson finds himself watching silently as the vaunted Jaidee Rojjanasukchai makes khrabs of humility to Trade Minister Akkarat.The golden statues of the Buddha and Seub Nakhasathien gleam dully, overseeing the solemn moment.None of the participants show any expression at all.Not even a smile of triumph from Akkarat.And then a few minutes, later the chanting monks end their droning, and everyone is standing to leave.That's it.And so now Anderson finds himself cooling his heels outside the Phra Seub Temple bot, waiting to be escorted out of the compound.After enduring the astonishing series of security checks and body searches to get into the Environment Ministry campus, he had begun to fantasize that he might glean some useful bit of intelligence about the place, perhaps get some better sense of where their lovely seedbank might be tucked away.It was foolish, and he knew it, but after the fourth patdown he was almost convinced that he was about to run into Gibbons himself, perhaps cradling a newly engineered ngaw like a proud father.Instead, he encountered grim cordons of white shirts and was whisked by cycle rickshaw directly to the temple steps where he was required to remove his shoes and stand in bare feet under tight supervision before being led inside with all the other witnesses.Around the temple, a thicket of rain trees prevents much view of the place at all.AgriGen arranged "accidental" dirigible overflights have given him more information about the compound than he's got right now, standing dead in the heart of the thing."I see you got your shoes back. "Carlyle, sauntering over, grinning."The way they inspected," Anderson says, "I thought they were going to lock them in quarantine. ""They just don't like your farang smell. "Carlyle pulls out a cigarette and offers Anderson one as well.Under the close gaze of their white shirt guards, they light up."Enjoy the ceremony?"Carlyle asks."I thought there might be more pomp and circumstance. ""They don't need it.Everyone knows what this means.General Pracha has lost his face. "Carlyle shakes his head."For a second I was sure we were going to look up and see their Phra Seub statue crack in half with the shame.You can feel the Kingdom changing.It's in the air. "Anderson thinks of the few buildings he glimpsed as he was escorted to the temple.They were all dilapidated.Water stained and covered with vines.If the Tiger's fall isn't proof enough, the fallen trees and unkempt grounds are fine indicators."You must be very proud of what you've accomplished. "Carlyle draws on his cigarette and exhales slowly."Let's just say it's a satisfying step. ""You've impressed them. "Anderson nods toward the Farang Phalanx, who seem to be already drunk on their reparation money.Lucy is trying to convince Otto to sing the Pacific Anthem under the stern gazes of the armed white shirts.The trader catches sight of Carlyle and lurches over.His breath stinks with laolao."Are you drunk?"Carlyle asks."Completely. "Otto smiles dreamily."I had to finish everything at the gate.Bastards wouldn't let me bring the celebration bottles inside.Took Lucy's opium, too. "He drapes an arm over Carlyle's shoulder."You were right, you bastard.Right as rain.Look at all these damn white shirts' expressions.They've been eating bitter melon all day!"He gropes for Carlyle's hand, tries to shake it."God damn it's good to see them taken down a notch.Them and their thieving 'gifts of goodwill. 'You're a good man, Carlyle.Good man. "His grins blearily."I'm going to be rich because of you.Rich!"He laughs and paws for Carlyle's hand again."Good man," he says as he gets a grip."Good man. "Lucy shouts for him to get back in line."Rickshaw's here, you drunk bastard!"Otto stumbles away and with Lucy's help tries to crawl into the rickshaw.The white shirts watch coldly.A woman in an officer's uniform studies them all from the top of the temple steps, her face expressionless.Anderson watches her."What do you think she's thinking?"he asks, nodding up at the woman officer."All these drunk farang crawling through her compound?What does she see?"Carlyle draws on his cigarette and lets out smoke in a slow stream."The dawn of a new era. ""Back to the future," Anderson murmurs."Sorry?""Nothing. "Anderson shakes his head."Something Yates used to say.We're in the sweet spot, now.The world's shrinking. "Lucy and Otto finally manage to climb into the rickshaw.They roll out with Otto shouting blessings on all the honorable white shirts who have made him so rich with their reparation money.Carlyle quirks an eyebrow at Anderson, the question unspoken.Anderson draws on his cigarette, considering the branches of possibility that underlie Carlyle's question."I want to talk to Akkarat directly. "Carlyle snorts."Children want all sorts of things. ""Children don't play this game. ""You think you can twist him around your finger?Turn him into a good little administrator, like in India?"Anderson favors him with a cold eye.
