It felt slick against the arrowheads skin.He let the eddy carry him round in a slow gyration for a while, then pointed down and fell, twisting slowly as he went, down through the hazes and the clouds and the slowly thickening weight and press of gas, down to where the temperature was suitable, where he levelled out and did something he had never done before; he opened the cover of the little gascraft and let the atmosphere in, let Nasqueron in, let it touch his naked human skin.Alarms were beeping and flashing and when he opened his eyes they stung in the dim orange light that seemed to shine from all around.He still had the gillfluid in his mouth and nose and throat and lungs, though now he was forced to try and breathe by himself, just his chest muscles against the pull of Nasquerons gravity field.He was still connected to the gascraft by the interface collar, too, and, when he could not raise himself up from the bed of shock gel, he made the little arrowhead tip gradually towards its nose, so that he was propped three quarters of the way towards a standing position.Blood roared in his ears.His feet and legs protested at the weight as he was slowly forced down through the gel until he was partly standing on the far end of the cramped coffin shape that contained him.Now he could force himself away from the mould.He used his elbows, forcing himself forward.The stinging in his eyes was making them water.Tears at last.Shaking with the effort, he pulled at one sticky slippy strand of the gillfluid where it disappeared into his right nostril, and opened his mouth, gulping some of the gas.Nasqueron smelled of rotten eggs.He looked around, blinking the tears away as best he could, the interface collar sucking at his neck, trying to keep contact while he tried to look up and out.It was a muddy looking old place, Nasqueron.Like a big bowl of beaten egg, with a load of liquid shit stirred in and little drops of blood spattered throughout.And sulphurous on the palate.He let the gillfluid snap back, filling his nose, granting him pure oxygen rich air again, though the stench still lingered.He was sweating, partly from the exertion, partly from the heat.Maybe he should have chosen to do this a bit further up.Now his nose was tingling, too, as well as his streaming eyes.He wondered if he could sneeze with the gillfluid inside him.Would it come splattering up out of him, some ghastly lung vomit, ejected, left drooped over the side of the gascraft like some pale blue mass of seaweed, leaving him to gasp and choke and die?He could hardly see because of the tears now, Nasquerons noxious skies finally drawing from him what he had not been able to express for himself.All of them.The whole Sept.Theyd made the move to the Winter complex early.The warhead had fallen there, killing all of them: Slovius, Zab, Verpych, all his family, all the people he had grown up with, all those he had known and loved through his childhood and as he had grown, all the people who had made him whoever he now was, whatever he had been, until this moment.It had been quick.Instantaneous, indeed, but so what?They had felt no pain but they were dead, gone, beyond recall.Only they were not beyond recall.He could not stop recalling, he could not cease bringing them back to life in his head, if only to apologise.He had suggested to Slovius that they get away from the Autumn House.Hed meant a neutral place, some hotel or university complex, but theyd gone to another of the Septs Seasonal Houses instead  a compromise.And that had killed them.He had killed them.His well meant advice, his desire to care and protect, and to be known to have thought of this, had taken them all away.He thought of just letting the craft tip further over, beyond ninety degrees, letting himself fall out, jerked down by his own mass, hurtling him plummeting downwards into that great sucking breath of gas giant gravity, the gillfluid wrenched from him, perhaps taking some parts of his lungs with it as it ripped away, tearing him apart and letting him fill the bloody, ragged remains with alien gas for his last scream  falsetto, like the voice you got when you sucked helium from a party balloon  as he plunged into the depths.The signals and messages had finally caught up with them round about the time hed been floating through the wreckage of Valseirs wrecked study.All the shocked mailings, all the garbled queries, all the official notices, all the messages of support and sympathy, all the requests and follow up signals asking for confirmation that he was still alive, all the news mentions, all the Oculas revised orders: they had all come through in a flood, a great tangled knot of incoming data, held up by the Shrievaltys default secrecy, especially in a time of threat, the usual chaos of Dweller communications in general and the particular breakdown in the smooth running of signalling protocols transmission that always attended a Formal War, an effect always at its most extreme within the war zone itself.Dead, all dead.But then, not quite all dead (a Sept was no small thing, and reality was rarely quite so neat).Just as good as all.Five junior servants, on leave or errands, had survived, as had one of his second cousins and her infant son.That was all.Enough to make it not a clean break, however awful, sufficient so that he would be expected to keep going, provide leadership, be strong all that easily said clichd stuff.His mother, absent, might have survived, but shed been killed too, in another attack  unrelated, it was supposed, just sheer bad luck  on the Cessorian habitat in the Kuiper belt where shed been on a Retreat for the last half year.He supposed he ought to be thankful that Jaal was still alive, that she had not been calling at the Winter House at the time of the attack.Instead he had a succession of alarmed, shocked, plaintive and then numb sounding messages from her, the last few pleading for him to get in touch if he could, if he was alive, if he was somewhere in Nasqueron and could hear this or read this  He had been listed as missing by the Shrievalty Ocula after the attack on Third Fury.Officially he still was.They hadnt been sure that he and Colonel Hatherence were still alive until theyd received her relayed signal days later, and subsequently had thought it best to keep his survival a secret for the time being.His interview with the news service in Hauskip had complicated matters  however, this was already being denounced as a fake even without their intervention, and a degree of confusion had ensued.Listed as missing in action, he was still officially alive and so Chief Seer of Sept Bantrabal.That would not change for at least a year.The situation in Ulubis system was no less desperate and the importance of what they had been asked to do had if anything increased with the latest hostile actions of the Invader\Beyonders.Even as it all came through, even as the signals downloaded into the gascrafts memory, with all the codes intact, all the routings displayed, he kept thinking, Maybe its all a hoax, maybe its all just some terrible mistake.Even when he saw the news screenage of the still smoking crater where the Winter House had been, in the rolling hills of Ualtus Great Valley, he had wanted to believe it wasnt true; this was faked, all of it was faked.It had happened more or less at the same time as the bombardment of Third Fury.The tiny flash he had seen on the surface of glantine as they fell towards Nasqueron in the escaping drop ship: that had been the impact, that had been the instant of their deaths, that had been the very second in which he became alone.The earlier Shrievalty message, slipping through before the data jam that had kept them ignorant all these days and recording the organisations sympathy for his loss had been referring to this catastrophe as well, not just to the loss of life in Third Fury.The wreckage of the drop ship had been found, in the upper Depths, the body of Master Technician Hervil Apsile within.It was as though nothing was to be left aside, nothing and nobody saved, nothing, almost nothing, left to him.Some servants he hardly knew and a second cousin he was moderately fond of, plus an infant he couldnt even picture.And Jaal.But would that  could that  ever be the same now?He liked but did not love her, and was fairly sure she felt the same way.It would have been a good match, but after this he would be different, another person altogether, even if he did return from this idiot adventure, even if there was anything to return to, even if the coming war hadnt destroyed or altered everything.And would her Sept want her to marry into a Sept that no longer existed?Where was the good match, the wise marriage there?Would even she want to, and if she still did, would it not be out of duty, out of sympathy, out of the feeling that their contract must still be honoured, no matter what?What a formula for future blame and bitterness that would be.It was almost a comfort to realise that Jaal too would probably be lost to him.It was as though he was hanging over some great drop, about to fall, destined to fall, and the greatest pain came from the act of still hanging on, fingers scraping, nails tearing.Let go of this one last thing to cling to, and the fall itself would at least be painless.He wasnt going to kill himself.It was grimly good to know he could do it, but he wouldnt.From a purely practical point of view, he was fairly certain that Hatherence had followed him, using her esuits military capabilities to hide herself from his gascrafts senses.Shed try to stop him.It could get undignified, and she might even succeed.If he really wanted to kill himself, he was sure there were easier ways.Just heading deeper into the war zone and powering hard straight for a Dreadnought should do the job.And it would be too easy.It would be selfish.It would be the end to this terrible, gnawing feeling of guilt, a line drawn under that, and he didnt think that he deserved such an easy way out.He felt guilty?So feel guilty.He had meant no harm  quite the opposite  hed just been wrong.Feeling guilty was stupid.It was understandable, but it was stupid, just beside the point.They were dead and he was alive.His actions might well have led directly to their deaths, but he hadnt killed them.What was left?Revenge, maybe.Though who to blame?If it really had been Beyonders, that made his old treachery (or principled, self sacrificing stand, depending) look foolish somehow.He still despised the Mercatoria, hated the whole vicious, cretinous, vacuously self important, sentience hating system, and hed never had any illusions about the unalloyed niceness of the Beyonders or any other large group, or thought that a struggle against the Mercatoria would be other than prolonged, painful and bloody.Hed always known that his own end might be painful and long drawn out  he would do everything he could to make sure it wasnt, but sometimes there was just nothing you could do.He had also realised that innocents died just as filthily and in equally great numbers in a just war as they did in an unjust one, and had known that war was to be avoided at almost all costs just because it magnified mistakes, exaggerated errors, but still hed hoped there would somehow be an elegance about his involvement in the struggle against the Mercatoria, a degree of gloriousness, a touch of the heroic.Instead: muddle, confusion, stupidity, insane waste, pointless pain, misery and mass death  all the usual stuff of war, affecting him as it might affect anybody else, without any necessary moral reason, without any justice and even without any vindictive ness, just through the ghastly, banal working out of physics, chemistry, biochemistry, orbital mechanics and the shared nature of sentient beings existing and contending.Perhaps he had brought it all down upon them.Never mind advising Slovius to get away from the Autumn House: his delve, his famous delve, the action of meeting Valseir and trading information might have produced all this.It might all be his fault.Taking all hed been told at face value, it was.He tried to laugh, but the gillfluid filling his mouth and throat and lungs wouldnt let him, not properly.Oh, come on then, be tried to say into the gassy skies of Nasqueron (it came out as a hopeless mumble), show me its all a sim, prove the Cessonas right.End run.Game over.Lift me out.Still all just a mumble, a gurgling somewhere down in his throat as he half stood, half lay there in his coffin shaped alcove in the little hovering gascraft, poised within the gas giants atmosphere at a place where a human could expose themselves to the elements and not die too quickly, if they had something to breathe.Revenge was a poor way out too, he thought through his tears.It was human nature, it was creat nature, it would be in the nature of almost any being capable of feeling angry and injured, but it was nearly as poor a way out as suicide.Self serving, self centred, selfish.Yes, if he was set in front of whoever had ordered the lobbing of a nuke at a house complex full of unarmed, unwarned civilians, hed be tempted to kill them if he could, but it would not bring the dead back.He never would have the opportunity, of course  again, reality scarcely ever worked that neatly  but if, in theory, he was presented with the chance, the fabled theyre tied to a chair and youve got a gun scenario, able to hurt or kill whoever had killed most of those hed loved, he might do it.There was an argument that it would only make him as bad as them, but then he knew that in a way he was already just as bad as them.The only moral reason for doing it would be to rid the world, the galaxy, the universe of one self evidently bad person.As though there would ever be a shortage, as though that wouldnt just leave the same niche for another.And it would be a military machine, a hierarchy involved here, anyway.The responsibility would almost certainly diffuse out from whoever  or whatever group  had drawn up the relevant strategy through to whoever had given some probably vague order down to whoever had drawn up the general and specific targeting criteria, on down to some schmuck grunt or thoughtless technician whod pressed a button or tapped a screen or thought clicked an icon floating in a holo tank.And doubtless that individual would be a product of the usual hammer subtle military induction and indoctrination process, breaking the individual down and building them back up again into a usefully obedient semi automatic asset, sentimental towards their closest comrades, loyal only to some cold code.And, oh, how utterly sure you would have to be that they really were responsible in the first place, that you werent being fooled by whoever had arranged all this tying to a chair stuff and equipped you with a gun in the first place.Maybe automatics had slotted in the final target programming.Was he supposed to track down the programmer too and tie him up with whoever had given the attack authorisation or dreamed up the whole wizzo plan for visiting Ulubis in the first place?If it had really been Beyonders, it might have been an AI which was responsible for the deed, for who knew what reason.Why, hed have to find it, turn the durn thing off.Though wasnt the Mercatorias murderous attitude to AIs one of the reasons he hated it so much?And maybe, of course, it had all been their mistake and his fault.Perhaps theyd thought they were going to hit an empty house and only his idiot advice, his meddling, had filled it with people.How to apportion the blame there?His eyes were bad now, like sand had been thrown in them.He couldnt really see anything, the tears were so thick.(He could still see via the collar, which was a strange experience, the tipped, clear view of the arrowheads senses overlaid on his bodys own. )He couldnt kill himself.He had to go on, see what could be done, pay tribute, try to make up, try to leave the place even fractionally better than hed found it, try to do whatever good he might be capable of.He waited for the Truth to kick in, for the sim run to end, and when it didnt  as hed known it wouldnt but had almost hoped it would  he felt bitter, resigned and grimly amused all at once.He told the little gascraft to tip back and seal him in again.The arrowhead angled backwards, closing the canopy and enveloping him once more, the shock gel already moving to cushion and cosset him, tendrils of salve within it starting to heal and repair his flesh and soothe his weeping eyes.He thought the machine did it all with something like relief, but knew that was a lie.The relief was his.Ah, opinions differ as opinions should.Always have, do and will.Might we have been bred?Who knows?Maybe we were pets.Perhaps professional prey.Maybe we were ornaments, palace entertainers, whipping beings, galaxy changing seed machines gone wrong (these are some of our myths).Maybe our makers disappeared, or we overthrew them (another myth  vainglorious, overly flattering  I distrust it).Maybe these makers were some proto plasmatics ?This, must be said, a pervasive one, a tenacious trope.Why plasmatics?Why would beings of the flux  stellar or planetary, no matter  wish to make something like us, so long ago?We have no idea.Yet the rumour persists.All we know is that we are here and we have been here for ten billion years or more.We come and we go and we live our lives at different rates, generally slower as we get older, as you good people have seen within these walls, but beyond that, why are we?What are we for?What is our point?We have no idea.Youll forgive me; these questions seem somehow more important when applied to us, to Dwellers, because we do seem  well, if not designed, certainly, as one might say, prone to persisting, given to hanging about.No disrespect, do understand, but the selfsame questions applied to Quick, to humans or even  like species apologies begged, dear colonel, accept  to oerileithe, have not the same force because you do not have our track record, our provenance, our sheer cussed, gratuitous, god denying abidance.Who knows?Maybe one day you will!After all, the universe is still young, for all our shared egocentricity, our handed down certitude of culmination, and perhaps when the Final Chronicles are written by our unknowable ultimate inheritors they will record that the Dwellers lasted a mere dozen billion years or so in the first heady flush of the universes infancy before they faded away to nothing, while the oerileithe and humans, those bywords for persistence, those doughty elongueurs, those synonyms for civilisational endurance, lasted two and three hundred billion years respectively, or whatever.Then the same questions might be asked of you: Why?What for?To what end?And  who can say!perhaps for you, such being the case, there will be an answer.Better yet, one that makes sense.For now, though, we alone are stuck with such awkward challenges.Everybody else seems to come and go, and that appears natural, that is to be expected, that is the given: species appear, develop, blossom, flourish, expand, coast, shrink and fade.Cynics would say: ha!just nature, is all  no credit to claim, no blame to take, but I say huzzah!Good for all for trying, for taking part, for being such sports.But we?Us?No, were different.We seem cursed, doomed, marked out to outstay our welcome, linger in a niche that could as well fit many  yes, many!others, making everybody else feel uncomfortable by our just still being here when by rights we should have shuffled off with our once contemporaries long ago.Its an embarrassment, I dont mind admitting.Im amongst friends, I can say these things.And anyway, Im just an old mad Dweller, a tramp, an itinerant, a floatful plodder from place to place, worthy of nothing but contempt and handouts, both if Im lucky, worse if Im not.I try your patience.Forgive me.I get to talk to so few apart from the voices I make up.The speaker was an off sequence Dweller of Cuspian age called Oazil.To be off sequence was to have declared oneself  or, sometimes, to have been declared by ones peers  uninterested in or apart from the usual steady progression of age and seniority that Dweller society assumed its citizens would follow.It was not by itself a state of disgrace  it was often compared to a person becoming a monk or a nun  though if it had been imposed on rather than chosen by a Dweller it was certainly a sign that they might later become an Outcast, and physically ejected from their home planet, a sanction which, given the relaxed attitude Dwellers displayed to both interstellar travel times and spaceship construction quality control, was effectively a sentence of somewhere between several thousand years solitary confinement, and death.Oazil was an itinerant, a tramp, a wanderer.He had entirely lost contact with a family he claimed to have anyway forgotten all details of, had no real friends to speak of, belonged to no clubs, sodalities, societies, leagues or groups and had no permanent home.He lived, hed told them, in his carapace and his clothes, which were tattered and motley but raggedly impressive, decorated with carefully painted panels depicting stars, planets and moons, preserved flowers from dozens of CloudPlant species and the polished carbon bones and gleaming, socketed skulls of various miniature gas giant fauna.It was a slightly larger scale and more feral collection of what Dwellers called life charms compared to the sort of stuff Valseir had worn save when there was some sort of formal event to attend.When Fassin had first seen the Dweller tramp it had even occurred to him that Oazil was Valseir in disguise, come back in some attempted secrecy to taunt them all, see how they would treat a poor itinerant before revealing himself as the true owner of the house come to reclaim his lost estate.But Valseir and Oazil looked quite different.Oazil was bulkier, his carapace fractionally less symmetrical, his markings less intricate, his voice far deeper and his quota of remaining vanes and limbs quite different too.Most marked of all, Oazils carapace was much darker than Valseirs.The two were of roughly similar age  Oazil would have been slightly junior to Valseir had he still been on sequence: a Cuspian baloan or Cuspian nompar to Valseirs Cuspian choal  but he looked much older, darker and more weather beaten, almost as dark as Jundriance, who was ten times his age but had spent much of his life as a scholar in slow time, not wandering the atmosphere exposed to the elements.Oazil towed behind him a little float trailer  shaped like a small Dweller and similarly bedecked  in which he carried a few changes of apparel, some sentimentally precious objects and a selection of gifts which he had made, usually carved from OxyTreeCloud roots.He had presented one of these, shaped to resemble the bubble house itself, to Nuern, to pass on to Jundriance when next he left his depths of slow academe.Nuern had not looked especially impressed to receive this small token.However, Oazil claimed that Valseirs house had been a stopping off point for him during his peregrinations for the last, oh, fifty or sixty thousand years or so.And there was anyway, especially away from cities, a tradition of hospitality towards wanderers that it would be profoundly kudos sacrificing to ignore, certainly when there were other guests around to witness the insult.Will you stay long, sir?Nuern asked.Yes, will you?asked Livilido.Oh, no, Ill be gone tomorrow, Oazil told the younger Dweller.This is, Im sure, a fine house still, though of course I am sorry to hear that my old friend is no more.However, I become awkward when I spend too long in one place, and houses, though not as terrifying to me as cities, provoke in me a kind of restlessness.I cannot wait to be away when I am near a house, no matter how pleasant its aspect or welcoming the hosts.They were outside on one of the many balconies girdling the house living spaces.They had originally convened for a morning meal to welcome Oazil in the net hung dining space.But the old Dweller had seemed uncomfortable from the start, edgy and a twitch, and before the first course was over he had asked, embarrassed and plaintive, if he might dine outside, perhaps beyond a window they would open so that they could still converse face to face.He suffered from a kind of claustrophobia brought on by countless millennia spent wandering the vast unceilinged skies, and felt uncomfortable enclosed like this.Nuern and Livilido had swiftly ordered their younger servants to strike table and set the meal up on the nearest balcony.Theyd all gone outside, and  after voluminous apologies for seeming to force his will upon them  Oazil had settled down, enjoyed his meal, and, subsequent to sampling some aura grains and timbre trace from the narcotics in the tables centrepiece  modelled on a globular university city  he had relaxed sufficiently to share with them all his thoughts on Dweller origins.It was a favourite after meal topic with Dwellers, and so one there was effectively nothing original to say concerning, though, to give Oazil some credit, the subject had been his academic speciality before hed slipped the moorings of scholastic life and set float upon the high skies of wander.Hatherence asked the old Dweller his thoughts on whether his species had always been unable to experience pain, or had had this bred out of them.Ah!If we only knew!I am fascinated that you ask the question, for it is one that I believe is of the utmost importance in the determining of what our species really means in the universe  Fassin, resting lightly in a cushioned dent across the ceremonial table from the old wanderer, found his attention slipping.It seemed to do this a lot now.Perhaps a dozen Nasqueron days had elapsed since the news of the Winter Houses destruction.He had spent almost all that time in the various libraries, searching for anything that might lead to their goal, the (to him, at least) increasingly mythical seeming third volume of the work that he had taken from here over two hundred years ago and which had, supposedly, led to so much that had happened since.He looked, he searched, he trawled and combed and scanned, but so often, even when it seemed to him that he was concentrating fully, hed find that hed spent the last few minutes just staring into space, seeing in his minds eye some aspect of the Sept and family life that was now gone, recalling an inconsequential conversation from decades ago, some at the time so what?exchange that he would not have believed hed ever have remembered, let alone have found brought to mind now, when they were all gone and he was in such a far and different place.He felt the welling of tears in his eyes sometimes.The shock gel drew them gently away.Sometimes he thought again of suicide, and found himself longing, as though for a lost love or a treasured, vanished age, for the will, the desire, the sheer determination to end things that would have made killing himself a realistic possibility.Instead, suicide seemed as pointless and futile as everything else in life.You needed desire, the desire for death, to kill yourself.When you seemed to have no desire, no emotions or drives of any sort left  just their shadows, habits  killing oneself became as impossible as falling in love.He looked up from the books and scrolls, the fiches and crystals, the etched diamond leaf and glowing screens and holos, and wondered what the point of anything was.He knew the standard answers, of course: people  all species, all species types  wanted to live, wanted comfort, to be free from threat, needed energy in some form  whether it was as direct as absorbed sunlight or as at a remove as meat  desired to procreate, were curious, wanted enlightenment or fame and\or success and\or any of the many forms of prosperity, but  ultimately  to what end?People died.Even the immortal died.Gods died.Some had faith, religious belief, even in this prodigiously, rampantly physically self sufficient age, even in the midst of this universal, abundant clarity of godlessness and godlack, but such people seemed, in his experience, no less prone to despair, and their faith a liability even in its renunciation, just one more thing to lose and mourn.People went on, they lived and struggled and insisted on living even in hopelessness and pain, desperate not to die, to cling to life regardless, as if it was the most precious thing, when all it had ever brought them, was bringing them and ever would bring them was more hopelessness, more pain.Everybody seemed to live as though things were always just about to get better, as though any bad times were just about to end, any time now, but they were usually wrong.Life ground on.Sometimes to the good, but often towards ill and always in the direction of death.Yet people acted as though death was just the biggest surprise  My, who put that there?Maybe that was the right way to treat it, of course.Maybe the sensible attitude was to act as though there had been nothing before one came to consciousness, and nothing would exist after ones death, as though the whole universe was built around ones own individual awareness.It was a working hypothesis, a useful half truth.But did that mean that the urge to live was the result of some sort of illusion?Was the reality, in fact, that nothing mattered and people were fools to think that anything did?Were the choices either despair, the rejection of reason for some idiot faith, or a sort of defensive solipsism?Valseir might have had something useful to say on the matter, Fassin thought.But then, he was dead too.He looked at Oazil and wondered if this self proclaimed wanderer really had known the dead Cuspian whose house this had been.Or was he just a chancer, a blow hard, a fantasist and liar?Thinking like this, circling round his studied despair, Fassin only half listened to the old Dweller with his theories about gas giant fauna development and his tales of wandering.Oazil told how once he had circumnavigated the South Tropical Band without seeing another Dweller in all those hundred and forty thousand kilometres, how he had once fallen in with a gang of Adolescent Sculpture Pirates, semi renegades who seeded public RootCloud and AmmoniaSluice forests, him becoming their figurehead, mascot, totem, and how, many millennia ago in the little travelled wastes of the Southern Polar Region, he had wandered into a vast warren of empty CloudTunnel.(The work of a troop of rogue Tunnel building machines since disappeared?An artwork?The lost prototype for a new kind of city?He didnt know  nobody had ever heard of this place, this thing. )He was lost inside this vast tree, this giant lung, this colossal root system of a labyrinth for a thousand years, exiting eleven twelfths starved and nearly mad.He had reported the find and people had looked for it but it had never been found again.Most people thought hed imagined it all, but he had not.They believed him, did they not?The tapping noise was there again.He had been vaguely aware of it but had ignored it, not even getting as far as dismissing it as some function of the houses plumbing or differential expansion or reaction to some brief current in the surrounding gas.It had stopped after a while  he had half noticed that, too, though still thought no more about it.Now it was there again, and slightly louder.Fassin was in Library Three, one of the inner libraries, speed reading through the contents of a sub library that Valseir appeared to have picked up as part of a job lot untold ages ago.From the earliest date that anybody had bothered to note, this stuff had been lying around uncalled up and unread for thirty millennia, dating from an era several different species of Slow Seers ago, long before humans had come to Ulubis.Fassin suspected this was traded material, data  second hand, third hand, who knew how many hand  dredged from who knew where, possibly auto translated (it certainly read like it whenever he dipped into the text itself, to make sure that the contents were what the abstracts claimed), bundled and presented and handed over to the Dwellers of Nasqueron by some long superseded (possibly even long extinct) species of Seer in return for  presumably  still older information.He wondered at what point most of the data the Dwellers held would become traded data, and if that point had already been reached.He was not the first Seer to think of this and, thanks to the absolute opaqueness of the Dwellers records, he would certainly not be the last.The volumes he was checking were mostly composed of stories concerning the romantic adventures and philosophical musings of some group of Stellar Field Liners, though they were either much translated or the work of not just another species but another species type altogether.They seemed fanciful, anyway.The tapping wasnt going to go away.He looked up from the screen to the round skylight set in the ceiling.Library Three, though now surrounded and surmounted by other spheres, had once been on the upper outskirts of the house and had a generous expanse of diamond leaf at its crown, though nowadays  even had the house been situated in less gloomy regions  it would let in little natural light.There was something small and pale out there.When Fassin looked up the tapping stopped and the thing waved.It looked like a Dweller infant, a pet child.Fassin watched it waving for a while, then went back to the screen and the not especially feasible exploits of the SLiners.The tapping started again.He felt himself attempt to sigh inside his little gascraft.He stopped the screen scroll and lifted out of the dent seat, rising to the centre of the ceiling.It was indeed a Dweller child: a rather elongated, deformed looking one, to human eyes more like a squid than a manta ray.It was dressed in rags and decorated with a few pathetic looking life charms.Fassin had never seen an infant wearing clothes or decorations.It was oddly, maturely dark for one so young.It pointed in at what looked like some sort of catch or lock on the side of one of the skylights hexagonal panes.Fassin looked at the curious infant for a while.It kept pointing at the catch.There had been no sign of pet children round the house in all the time theyd been here.This one looked entirely like it might belong to Oazil, but he had not displayed any earlier, and hadnt mentioned owning one.The child was still indicating the panes lock.It started to mime pressing and twisting and pulling motions.Fassin opened the pane and let the creature in.It flipped inside, made a sign that was probably meant to be the Dweller equivalent of Shh!and floated towards him, curling and cupping its body so that it formed a sickle shape, just a metre away from the prow of the arrowhead craft.Then, on its signal skin, now shielded from sight in all directions save that Fassin was watching from, it spelled out,  OAZIL: MEET ME 2KM STRAIGHT DOWN, HOUR 5.RE.VALSEIR.It waited till he light signalled back OK, then it sped out the way it had come, one slim tentacle staying behind after the rest of it had exited just long enough to pull the ceiling pane shut after it.It disappeared into the night time gloom between the dark library globes outside.Fassin looked at the time.Just before hour Four.He went back to his studies, finding nothing, thinking about nothing, until just before five, when he went back to Library Twenty One and slipped out through the secret doorway again.He dropped the two thousand metres down through the slowly increasing heat and pressure and met the old Dweller Oazil, complete with his float trailer.Oazil signalled,  Fassin Taak?Yes.What did Valseir once compare the Quick to?In some detail, if you please.Why?The old Dweller sent nothing for some time, then,  You might guess, little one.Or do this just because I ask.To humour an old Dweller.Fassin waited a while before answering.Clouds, he sent, eventually.Clouds above one of our worlds.We come and we go and we are as nothing compared to the landscape beneath, just vapour compared to implacable rock, which lasts seemingly beyond lasting and is always there long after the clouds of the day or the clouds of the season have long gone, and yet other clouds will always be there, the next day and the next and the next, and the next season and the next year and for as long as the mountains themselves last, and the wind and the rain wear away mountains in time.Hmm, Oazil sent, sounding distracted.Mountains.Curious idea.I have never seen a mountain.Nor ever will, I imagine.Do you want me to add any more?I dont think I recall much else.No, that will not be necessary.Then?Valseir is alive, the old Dweller said.He sends his regards.Alive?There is a GasClipper regatta at the C 2 Storm Ultra Violet 3667, beginning in seventeen days time.Thats in the war zone, isnt it?The tournament was arranged long before the hostilities were first mooted and so has been cleared with the Formal War Marshals.A special dispensation.Be there, Fassin Taak.He will find you.The old Dweller roted forward a metre, taking up the slack on the float trailers traces.Farewell, Seer Taak, he signalled.Remember me to our mutual friend, if youd be so kind.He turned and floated away into the deep hot darkness.In a few moments he was lost to most passive senses.Fassin waited until there was no sign of him at all, then rose slowly back up to the house.Ah, Fassin, I understand commiserations are in order, Ysul said, floating up to the bubble houses reception balcony from the Poaflias.Nuern, Fassin and Hatherence had watched the ship motor out of the dim haze, hearing its engines long before theyd seen it.Your sympathy is noted, Fassin told Ysul.Hed got Hatherence to call the Poaflias the day before and order it back from its hunting patrol.The little ship returned with a modest number of trophies strung from its rigging: various julmicker bladders, bobbing like grisly balloons on sticks, three gas drying RootHugger hides, the heads of a brace of gracile Tumblerines and  patently the most prized, mounted above the crafts nose  a Dweller Child carcass, already gutted and stretched wide on a frame so that it looked like some slightly grotesque figurehead, flying just ahead of the ship.Fassin had sensed the colonels esuit rolling fractionally back when shed realised what the new addition to the Poafliass nose actually was.What is your state of mind, Fassin, now that you have lost so many of your family?Ysul asked, coming to a stop in front of the Seer.Are you decided to return to your own people?My state of mind is calm.I may still be in shock, I suppose.Shock?Look it up.I have not decided to return to my own people yet.There are almost none to return to.We are, however, finished here.I wish to return to Munueyn.Hed told the colonel that morning that hed discovered something and they needed to leave.What have you discovered, major?May I see it?Ill tell you later.I see.So where next are we bound?Back to Munueyn, hed lied.Munueyn?Our captain will be pleased, Ysul said.They left that evening.Nuern and Livilido seemed relaxed, positively cheered, that they were departing.Ysul had returned with news of the war, in which two important Dreadnought actions had already taken place, resulting, in one engagement alone, in the loss of five Dreadnoughts and nearly a hundred deaths.The Zone forces were retreating in two volumes at least and the Belt certainly had the upper grasp at the moment.Fassin and Hatherence recorded short messages of gratitude for Jundriance to read at his leisure.Nuern asked them if they wanted to take any of the books or other works from the house.No, thank you, Fassin said.I found this humorous thesaurus, the colonel said, holding up a small diamond leaf book.Id like this.Be our guest, Nuern told her.Anything else?Diamond based works like that will burn up in a few decades when the house has dropped further into the heat.Take all you want.Over kind.This alone is most sufficient.The GasClipper regatta?Captain Slyne said.He scratched his mantle.I thought you wanted to go back to Munueyn?There was no reason to let our hosts know where we were really heading, Fassin told Slyne.You are suspicious of them?Ysul asked.Just no reason to trust them, Fassin said.The regatta takes place around the Storm Ultra Violet 3667, between Zone C and Belt 2, the colonel said.Starting in sixteen days.Have we time to get there, captain?They were in Slynes cabin, a fairly grand affair of flickering wall screens and antique furniture, the ceiling hung with ancient ordnance: guns, blaster tubes and crossbows all swaying gently as the Poaflias powered away at half throttle from Valseirs old house.So far Fassin had told Hatherence where they were really going, though not why.Slyne let himself tilt, looking as though he was about to fall over.He did some more mantle scratching.Ithink so.Id better change course, then.Leave the course change for a little longer, would you?Fassin asked.They were only a half hour away from the bubble house.Though you might go to full speed.Have to anyway, if were to get to that Storm in time, Slyne said, turning and manipulating a holo cube floating over his halo shaped desk.The largest screen, just in front of him, lit up with a chart of the volume and quickly became covered in gently curved lines and scrolling figure boxes.Slyne peered at this display for a few moments, then announced: Full speed, we can be there in eighteen days.Best I can do.Slyne gripped a large, polished looking handle sitting prominently on his desk and pushed it, with a degree of obvious relish, if also a little embarrassment, to its limit.The tone of the ships engines altered and the vessel began to accelerate gradually.We might contact Munueyn and hire a faster ship, Ysul suggested.Have it rendezvous with the Poaflias en route and transfer to it.Slyne rocked back, staring at the older Dweller with patterns of betrayal and horror (non mild) spreading across his signal skin.Eighteen days will have to do, captain, Fassin told Slyne.I dont think we need be there for the very start of the tournament.How long do these competitions last, in generality?Hatherence asked.Slyne tore his gaze from an unconcerned looking Ysul and said, Ten or twelve days, usually.They might cut this one a little short because of the War.Well be there in time for most of it.Good, Fassin said.Stay on your current course for another half hour, if you please, captain.Turn for the Storm then.Slyne looked happier.Consider it done.Slyne took advantage of a WindRiver, a brief lived ribbon of still faster current within the vast, wide jet stream of the whole rotating Zone, and they made good time.They were challenged twice by war craft but allowed to continue on their way, and slipped through a mine net, a wall of dark lace thrown across the sky, dotted with warheads.Dreadnought catcher, nothing to worry them, Slyne assured them.They had, oh, tens of metres to spare on almost every side.The screwburster Poaflias got to very near the bottom of the Storm called Ultra Violet 3667 within sixteen days, arriving more or less as the regatta began.Keep clipped on!Could get a bit rough!Ysul yelled, then repeated the warning as a signal, in case they hadnt heard.Fassin and Hatherence had come up on deck when the Poaflias had started bucking and heaving even more than usual.The gas around them, darker even than it had been at Valseirs house, though less dense and hot, was fairly shrieking through the ships vestigial rigging.Ribbons and streaks, just seen coiling briefly round the whole vessel, were then torn away again as the ship plunged into another great boiling mass of cloud.The human and the oerileithe, still within the relative calmness of the companionway shelter, exchanged glances, then quickly put the crude looking harnesses on.The colonels fitted well over her esuit.Fassins tied tight enough but looked messy, not designed forhis alien shape.Slyne had insisted that everybody should wear the things whenever they went on deck while the Poaflias was at full speed, even though both Hatherence and Fassin  in the unlikely event that they were somehow blown off the deck  could easily have caught up with the ship under their own power.Whats going on?Hatherence shouted as they neared Ysul, clinging to the rails near the bow harpoon gun.Going to shoot the storm!Ysul bellowed back.That sounds dangerous!Hatherence yelled.Oh, assuredly!So, what does it entail, exactly?Punching through the storm wall, Ysul shouted.Tackling the rim winds.Should be spectacular!Ahead, a great dark wall of tearing, whirling cloud could be glimpsed beyond the tatters and scraps of gas that the ship was stabbing its way through.Jagged lines of lightning pulsed across this vast cliff like veins of quicksilver.They were still making maximum speed towards the wall, which seemed to stretch as far to each side as they could see, and up for ever.Downwards was a more swirling mass of even darker gas, boiling like something cooking in a cauldron.The wind picked up, thrumming the rails and rigging and aerials like an enormous instrument.The Poaflias shuddered and buzzed.Time to get below, suspect, Hatherence shouted.A julmicker bladder blew off a nearby railing  it looked like it had been the last one left  smacked Ysul across his starboard side and was instantly lost to the shrieking gale.Could be, Ysul agreed.After you.They watched from the ships armoured storm deck, crowded in with Slyne beneath a blister of thick diamond set at midships, looking out across the deck and watching the Poafliass nose plunge into the storm like a torpedo thrown at ahorizontal waterfall of ink.The ship groaned, started to spin, and they were all thrown against each other.They disappeared into the wall of darkness.The Poaflias shook and leapt like a Dweller child on the end of a harpoon line.Slyne whooped, pulling on levers and whirling wheels.Stuck in the far reaches of the ovaloid space, Slynes pet children whimpered.This entirely necessary?Fassin asked Ysul.Doubt it!the Dweller said.A big flat board covered in studs above Slyne started to light up.In the darkness, it was quite bright  Hatherence pointed at it as dozens more of the studs lit.Whats that?Damage control indicators!Slyne said, still working levers and spinning wheels.They all rose to the ceiling as the ship dropped sharply, then crashed back down again.Thought it might be, Hatherence said.She was thrown hard against Fassin in a violent turn, and apologised.When the glare started to get too distracting, Slyne turned the damage control board off.In the worst of the turbulence, one of Slynes pet children threw itself at its master and had to be torn off and smacked unconscious before being thrown into a locker.It was unclear whether it had been desperately seeking comfort or attacking.Ysul was sick.Fassin had never seen a Dweller be sick.Stuck to the ceiling again, coated in a greasy film of vomit, Slyne cursing as he tried to keep hold of the controls, his pet children keening from all sides, somebody mumbled, Fuck, were going to die.They all denied responsibility afterwards.The Poaflias burst out of the torrent of storm cloud into a vast and hazy calm and started to drop like a lump of iron.Slyne drew in gas to whoop but caught some of Ysuls earlier output and just spluttered.Coughing and retching and cursing Ysuls lineage to some point only shortly after the Big Bang, he got the ship level and under control, contacted Regatta Control and limped  the ship had lost all its rigging, railings and four of its six engines  to the Lower Marina and a berth in a Storm Repair Facility.Looking up, into the colossal bowl of the circling storm and on into the haze and the star specked sky beyond, tiny shapes could be seen, slow circling against the brassy glare of light.The pick up fleet and relaying craft are all in orbit, Hatherence told him.They were in a steep pitched, multi tiered viewing gallery packed with Dwellers.Protected by carbon ribs ready to be explosively deployed should a competition craft come too close  and attached to the Dzunda, a klick long Blimper riding just inside the storm wall boundary  the gallery was a relatively safe place to watch GasClipper races.Giant banner screens could scroll up on either side of the fan of dent seats to provide highlights of other races and relay events too distant to witness directly.The pick up fleet?Fassin asked.That is as it was described to me, Hatherence said, settling into her seat alongside his.Dwellers around them were staring at them, seemingly fascinated by their alienness.Ysul had gone off to meet an old friend.While he was with them, Dwellers only glanced at Fassin and Hatherence now and again.With him gone, they stared shamelessly.They had both got used to it, and Fassin was confident that, if Valseir was here and looking for him, he wouldnt have too difficult a job finding him.How big a fleet?Fassin asked.Not sure.There were hundreds of accommodation and spectator Blimpers within the storms vast eye, scores of competing GasClippers and support vessels, plus dozens of media and ancillary craft, not to mention a ceremonial  and War neutral Dreadnought, the Puisiel.This was decked out with multi tudinous bunting, lines of ancient signal flags and festoons of Dweller size BalloonFlowers, just so that thered be no possi bility of anyone mistaking it for a Dreadnought taking part in the greater and fractionally more serious competition taking place beyond the Storm.The side screens lit up and they watched some early action from a race which had taken place the day before.Around them, a thousand Dwellers hooted and roared and laughed, threw food, made spoken kudos bets that they would later deny or inflate accordingly, and traded insults.Any other news from outside?Fassin asked.Our orders remain as they were.There have been more semi random attacks throughout the system.Nothing on the same scale as the assaults on the Seer assets earlier.The defen sive preparations continue apace.Manufacturers continue to make heroic efforts.The people continue to make great but willing sacrifice.Morale remains most high.Though, unofficially, people would seem to be growing more frightened.Some rioting.Deep space monitors have picked up still ambiguous traces of a great fleet approaching from the direction of the E 5 Disconnect.How great?Great enough to be bad.Much rioting?Not much rioting.The Blimper powered up, distantly revving its engines.A ragged cheer resounded around them as the Dwellers realised things were about to start happening.Well, major, the colonel sent, signal strength low in the clat tering hubbub of noise.We are finally off the ship Poaflias, we are alone, I think it unlikely we can be overheard, and I have built up an extravagant desire to know quite why we are here.Unless you have, in the course, perhaps, of your studies, discov ered that you are an insatiable fan of GasClippering.According to Oazil, Valseir is alive.The colonel was silent for a while.Then she sent,  You tell me so, do you?Of course, Oazil may be mad or deluded or a fantasist or just a mischief maker, but from what he said he knew Valseir, or had at least been instructed by Valseir on what to ask me to make sure I really was who I claimed to be.I see.So, his turning up at the house was not chance?I suspect hed been keeping a watch on it.Or somebody had, waiting for us  for me  to turn up.And he told you to come here?He did.And then?Valseir will find me.Another cheer went up as the Dzunda began to pick up speed, becoming part of a small fleet of similar spectator craft flocking through the gas towards the starting grid of GasClippers arranged a couple of kilometres ahead.This would be a short race, only lasting an hour or so, with turns around buoys set in the Storm Wall.The races would grow longer and more gruelling as the meet progressed, culminating in a last epic struggle all the way round the vast storms inner surface.So Valseir knew you were or might be looking for him,  and had put in place arrangements to Hmm.That is inter esting.Any contact so far?Not yet.But now you know why were here.You will keep me informed?Yes.Though you will understand if I have to go off by myself at some point, I hope.Your presence might make Valseir, or whoever, nervous.The Blimper picked up more speed, still heading towards the storm inward side of the starting grid.The slipstream started to blow away balloons and trays not secured.Nervous?You think this is all that serious?What do you think?I think Oazil is probably one or several of the things you thought he might be.However, we are here now and if he was telling the truth no doubt you will be contacted.Of course, the other possibility is that we might have been getting close to something of interest back at Valseirs house and this was simply a method of getting us out of the way.What exactly did Oazil say to you?Fassin had kept a record of the conversation hed had with the wandering Dweller, deep beneath the house.He signalled it across to Hatherence.The fleet of spectator craft passed by the starting grid like an unruly flock of fat birds.Another great cheer sounded.The GasClippers stayed on the starting plane, awaiting their own signal.Still, little enough to go on, major, Hatherence told him.You should have shared this with me earlier and let me decide on the correct course of action.I may have been overly indul gent with you.Your loss is still something I appreciate, of course.However, I fear I might have been guilty of dereliction.I wont report you if you dont, Fassin sent, without humour.The GasClippers  the larger, plural crewed versions of the single Dweller StormJammers  were sharp, angular looking things, all jag sails, keel lode and high gallants.Fifty metres long  fifty metres in most directions  bristling with glittering sails like enormous blades, they looked like the result of some monstrous permanent magnet being thrown into a hopper full of exotic edged weapons.Pennant sails carried identifying marks, little flowers of colour within the silvery blades, all bright beneath the glittering point of light that was Ulubis.It was not possible to sail in a single medium.True sailing required a keel (or something like one) in one medium, and sails (or something like them) in another.In a single great stream of gas, you could not sail: you flew.On the edges of two streams, the boundary between a zone moving in one direction and a belt moving in the other, you could, in theory, sail, if you could build a ship big enough.The Dwellers had tried to build ships on that scale that would stay together.They had failed.Instead, StormJammers and GasClippers exploited the titanic magnetic fields that most gas giant planets possessed.Flux lines were their water, the place where their steadying keels lay.With a colossal magnetic field trying to move them along one course and the planet girdling atmospheric bands of a Dweller inhabited gas giant expecting them to move along with everything else in a quite different direction, the possibility of sailing arose.And by sailing with sails dipped into the inside edges of giant storm systems, the sport could be made satisfactorily dangerous.We must hope that this was not a ruse to get us away from the house, the colonel told Fassin.And we must hope that Valseir will indeed contact you.If he is alive.We were given no hint that such might be the case.She looked at him.Were we?None.Almost the entire fleet of spectator craft had passed the starting grid.The GasClippers shook as one, then  bewilderingly quickly, when one knew they had no proper engines  they swung away towards the massive wall of dark, tearing cloud that was the inner limit of the great storm, peeling and jostling, weaving and carving through the gas as they fought for position, using the light breezes and simple gaseous inertia of the medium to allow them to steer while they rode their lines of force towards the storm wall.They never did find a body, though.This is right?Hatherence asked.Thats right, Fassin told her.Lost in a squall that could tear apart a StormJammer he wouldnt have had much of a chance, but he might have lived.Yet there is no water or the like?They cannot drown, and it is not too cold or hot.How do they die, just in a strong wind?Ripped apart, spun until they lose consciousness and then just whirled round too fast to hold together.Or left in a coma that means they do drop into the Depths.And they do need to breathe.If the pressure is too low, they cant.Hmm.The GasClippers swung at the storms inner surface, half disappearing as their extending blade sails cut into the stream of gas.They accelerated hard.Even with their head start and their bellowing engines labouring, even taking a shorter, inner curve route, the spectator craft began to lose ground to the small fleet of speeding GasClippers.It is possible that Valseir somehow arranged the accident?the Colonel asked.Possible.He might have arranged to have some friend, some accomplice nearby, to rescue him.It would make surviving likely rather than not.Do Dwellers often fake their own deaths?Almost never.So I thought.The group of GasClippers was level with the centre of the greater fleet of spectator ships and the shouting and hollering in the spectator craft rose still further in pitch and volume as the whole mass of GasClippers and their accompanying squadrons of Blimpers and ancillary vessels seemed to move briefly as one, the dark storm wall a vertical sea, troubled and tattered, tearing past in front of them.A vast slanting band of shade rose up to meet them all as they moved into the shadow of the storm, the hazy point of Ulubis eclipsed by a roaring circlet of dementedly gyrating gas a hundred klicks high and ten thousand kilometres across.Fassin.Made any bets yet?Ysul said, settling into his dent seat alongside.A pet child in a waiters uniform floated with a tray at his side, held back until the older Dweller settled into his seat, then left the tray with its drug paraphernalia clipped to the seat and retreated.No.Id be relying on your kudos, wouldnt I?Oh!I suppose you would, Ysul agreed, apparently only now thinking this through.Obviously I must trust you subconsciously.Most odd.He flipped to one side and started rummaging through the various drug works hed brought back.How was your friend?Hatherence asked him.Oh, in very good spirits, Ysul said, not looking at her.Father died yesterday in action.Stands to inherit kudos points for bravery or something.He kept on rummaging.Sworn I got some FeverBrain  Good to know hes taking it so well, Fassin said.Ah!Here we are, Ysul said, holding up a large bright orange capsule to take a good look at it.Oh yes, Fassin: bumped into some youngster who claimed to know you.Gave me this.Ysul dug into a pocket in his forebritch and came out with a tiny image leaf, passing it to Fassin.The human held it in one of the gascrafts fine scale manipulators and looked at the photograph.It was of white clouds in a blue sky.Yes, colours all wrong, obviously, Ysul commented.Couldnt help noticing.Fassin was aware of the colonel looking at the image too.She sat back, silent.Did this person who claimed to know me actually say anything?Fassin asked.Eh?Ysul said, still studying the finger sized orange lozenge.Oh, yes.Said to take good care of that thing, and that theyll be in the stern viewing gallery restaurant if you wanted to see them.Alone, they said.Bit rude, I thought.Very young, though.Almost expect that.Well, thanks, Fassin said.Nothing, Ysul said with a wave.He popped the giant pill.With your permission, colonel, Fassin sent to Hatherence.Granted.Take care.Excuse me, Fassin said as he rose from his dent seat.Ysul didnt hear; two of the leading GasClippers were having a private duel, swerving dangerously close, weaving in and out of each others course, trying to tangle field lines, steal wind and so eddy wake the other into dropping behind or crashing out, and Ysul was floating high up out of his seat, shouting and whooping with all the other spectators not yet in their own little narcotic world.The Dweller  a youth by his simple clothing and certainly looking at least that young  intercepted Fassin on the broad central corridor of the Dzunda, falling into pace with him as he made his way towards the rear of the ship.Fassin turned fractionally towards his sudden companion, kept on going.Seer Taak?the youth said.Yes.Would you come with me, please?Fassinfollowed the young Dweller not to the stern viewing restaurant but to a private box slung low beneath the Blimper.The captain of the Dzunda was there, talking to an old Dweller who looked to be at least early Sage in years.The captain turned when Fassin and the youth entered, then  with a small bow to Fassin  left with the youth, leaving Fassin alone in the round, diamond bubble space with the aged Dweller.A few screens showed silent views of the race.A float tray to one side carried a large narcincenser, grey blue smoke uncoiling from it, filling thecabin with haze and scent.Is it you, old one?I am still me, young Taak, the familiar voice said.The Dweller floated up to him.If it was Valseir, he was no more shrunken but rather more dark than the last time Fassin had seen him.He had lost all the life charms and decorations and was dressed now in severely formal, almost monastic yellow part robes.You have the token I sent?Fassin handed over the little image leaf.The Dweller looked at it, rim mantle rippling in a smile.Yes, you still wear us away, dont you?He handed it back.Take good care of that.And so, how was Oazil?I take it he found you at the house and youre not here by coincidence.He was well.Eccentric, but well.The old Dwellers smile grew, then faded.And the house?My libraries?They are sinking into the Depths.Whats left.Whats left?A bit was missing.Ah.The study  What happened to it?The CloudTunnel started to get too heavy to maintain.I had the house decoupled.I cleared the study first.The tunnel section fell into the Depths.And the contents?The old Dweller roted back a fraction, creating small roils of smoke in the haze.You are still testing me, arent you, Fassin Taak?You are still not prepared to trust me that I am who you think I am.Who do I think you are?Your  I thought  old friend, Valseir, once choal, now acting like a Sage child and hoping for the confirmation of my peers if I ever get to come out of hiding.Do you think I will ever get to come out of hiding, Seer Taak?That depends.Beyond the old Dweller, the GasClipper race continued, well ahead of the labouring Blimper.Screens relaying signals from camera jets showed the action in close up.The sounds of distant cheers came through the open diamond pane windows of the private box.Why did you go into hiding?The Dweller switched to signal whispering.Because I thought to skim through what Id traded you for the Expressionist paintings you had brought.I read a certain note at the end of a certain volume.Which reminds me that I must apologise.It was not my intention to seem to fob you off with three different translations of the same volume instead of all three parts of the one work.However, read that note I did, and came to the conclusion that what was being referred to was the sort of information that people die for, and most certainly will kill for.I decided to disappear.I became dead.Sorry I doubted you, Valseir, Fassin said, moving forward and holding out two manipulators towards the old Dweller.Suspicious to the last, sighed Valseir, ignoring the left manipulator and shaking the right with his own extended right hub arm.There; how humans greet.Are you satisfied now, Seer Taak?Fassin smiled.Entirely.Good to see you again.You must feel emotional pain, then.I feel sorry for you.I am trying not to feel too sorry for myself.Which is helped by getting on with what needs to be done.Fassin had told Valseir about the attacks on Third Fury and Sept Bantrabal.Valseir had related his life since they had last met, a time dominated by the Dweller List in a way that even Fassins hadnt been until recently.Most of that period he had spent in hiding, after arranging what looked like his own death with the help of Xessife, the Dweller captain whom Fassin had seen briefly earlier.He was an old StormSailor, a Jammerhand and Clipperine with a collection of trophies and medals that outweighed him.Retired now, pursuing a more contemplative course, content to take charge of a Blimper now and again just to stay part of the whole StormSailing scene.And what needs to be done, Seer Taak?I think we need to find that third volume.Do you still have it?I do not.However, it is not the third volume itself that is of consequence in this matter.Then what is?A note, a brief appendix.Do you have that?No.Do you know where it is?No.Then we may all, to use a human term, be fucked.I do know the direction it went in.That could help.You agree that it may be that important?That we may all be fucked without it?Oh, we may very well all be thoroughly fucked with it, but without it, while people think this thing exists, they will do terrible things to anybody who gets in their way or isnt being what they regard as a hundred per cent helpful.My minder here, an oerileithe Ocula colonel, tells me theres a fleet of Mercatoria warships over Nasqueron.The excuse is theyre here to help pick up me and her, but I think they might have another purpose.Military intervention?The instant they think there might be a firm lead towards the List.Well, we must try not to furnish them with one.I must also try not to furnish my fellow Dwellers with an excuse for regarding me as the most terrible traitor for even thinking of passing on anything to do with the thing in question to alien powers, even if my own studies and those of many others indi cate that the data being sought is hopelessly out of date or a fantasy, or both.However, I do need to tell somebody which direction to point in, or I may have to stay dead for ever.Fate seems to dictate that its me you tell.Where do I go?Ah.Now then.I must explain.When I realised what was being referred to in the note in the first volume, I naturally looked for volume three.Well, at least I did so after spending some days in a state of horror and rage, realising that through no fault of my own  save the usually harmless hobby of biblio philia  I had potentially unleashed something capable of destroying much, starting with my own quite happy and content life.This episode over, I devoted myself to my search and discovered the volume eventually.I have never had such cause to curse my own lackadaisical approach to cataloguing.The relevant piece was in the form of a separate folder attached within the appendices.I myself took the original of the folder to a friend and fellow collector in the city of Deilte, in the South Polar Region, contained within a safekeep box which I asked him to look after for me, and not to open.In the event of my death, he was to hand the safekeep box on to somebody he in turn would trust not to open the box.A family member or some other trusted person would appear in due course carrying an image leaf with a particular image in it.The one you now carry.They were to be given the box.So would your friend in Deilte have known of your death?I didnt.Perhaps, perhaps not.He is an antiquarian data collector like myself, but a recluse.He may have heard through mutual acquaintances.Right, Fassin sent.So I must make for Deilte.What was your friends name?Chimilinith.The name was barely out of Valseirs signal pit when Fassin registered a neutrino burst.Any particular part of Deilte?he asked, starting to look round in more detail.Chimilinith tended to move his house around.But I imagine the locals will know of him.Okay.So, did you take a look at this data?What did it look like?The diamond bubble private box was nearly empty: just the two of them, the float tray and bowl  hed scanned them automatically when hed entered and they were just what they appeared to be, no more  and the screens, which also seemed perfectly standard.Whod be using neutrino comms?From where?Why the sudden burst, just then?It looked like algebra.Fassin scanned Valseirs simple clothes.No hint of anything high tech there.The most sophisticated thing in his robes was the weave itself.Algebra?he asked.There was nothing on the inside or the outside surface of the diamond bubble itself.He scanned the access tube.Clear.It looked like alien algebra, Valseir told him.Fassin looked up at the undersurface of the Blimper immediately above, then swept for anything in the clear gas space outside within the same radius.Still nothing.Something further outside, then.Alien?he asked, distracted.There seemed to be nothing nearby.There was the Dzunda, then nothing for a hundred metres or so until the next Blimper, then the other spectator and ancillary craft beyond  with the single accompanying Dreadnought Puisiel a few klicks further up in the atmosphere, easily keeping pace with the spectating fleet  then the GasClippers themselves, currently starting to round the Storm Wall buoy which marked this short races first turning point.Alien symbology.Though not entirely.I thought I recognised some of the symbols.They looked like a form of Translatory IV, a pan species type, so called universal notation dating from perhaps two billion years ago, invented by the Wopuld  long extinct invert spongiforms  though with elements of ancient Dweller icons.I would have made notes, but I thought better of committing any of it to a form I could carry around save what exists  necessarily sketchy  in my own mind.Hence I have not been able to work on it since.Fassin was taking in what was being said  and recording it on the gascrafts systems in case he wanted to review it later  but he was still frantically scanning the volume all around them for some form of bug or surveillance device.Another burst of what certainly seemed like neutrino comms registered on the little gascrafts sensors; a sudden pattern in the general wash of near massless particle chaos.The first burst had come immediately Valseir had spoken the name of the Dweller hed given the folder to.Could it really just have been coincidence?But how could anybody have overheard?They were communicating by whisper signal, coherent light beams flickering from one surface sunk transceiver pit to another.There was no way to intercept what they were saying unless someone dropped a mirror or some sensor into the beams.Could it be him?Had the gascraft itself been bugged?Had Hatherence put something on him?He scanned and system checked, finding nothing.The Blimper above them ascended quickly and steadily as the GasClippers roared up the sheer face of the storm.The Dzunda rose into direct sunlight.So, just a field of equations ?Fassin asked the old Dweller.The drug fume haze in the private box was suddenly lit up, resolving into tiny individual particles of vapour, a tiny fraction of them glinting and glittering.Possibly just the one long one.Horrified, Fassin sucked a little of the surrounding vapour into the arrowheads high res analysis unit.One piece of algebra?he asked.The results coming from the gascrafts high tech nose looked bizarre, surface receptors seeming to change their mind about what they were smelling.Fassin toggled the analysis down another level of detail to electron microscopy.Possibly, Valseir replied.Outside, towards the Storm Wall, a few tens of metres away, something showed, briefly caught in the slanting sunlight and taking just an instant too long to adapt to the new lighting conditions.The results from the arrowheads internal electron microscope were for a moment baffling.Then Fassin realised what his analysis unit was looking at.Nanotech.A thin soup of tiny machines, receptors, analysers, processors and signallers, small enough to be suspended in the atmosphere, light enough to float in the midst of the drug smoke like particles of the fumes themselves.That was how theyd been bugged.There was something in the gas between them, riding right in the middle of their signal beams and capable of picking up their meaning.Nothing as gross as a mirror or some photon microphone dangling from a wire, just this, just these, just stuff that was supposed to be banned.Valseir, he sent urgently.Who brought this drug bowl in here?He turned up visual magnification, staring hard at the point in the open gas outside, where something had shown in the sunlight an instant before.There.He up magged again, almost to the point of graininess.What?Valseir said, sounding confused.Well, it was here when I    A rough sphere, forty metres away, barely ten centimetres across, almost perfectly camouflaged, like a disc of clear glass in front of the real view.Hint of a comms pit, a tiny crater like dish, pointing right at them.Fassin swung round to put himself between the tiny, distant machine and the old Dweller, then went right up to him, comms pit to comms pit like amorous Dwellers kiss signalling.Valseir tried to rote back.What the  ?Weve been bugged, Valseir, Fassin sent.Watched, listened to.The bowl smoke is part nanotech.We need to get out, now.What?But    Another burst of neutrino comms.Now that he knew where to look, it was definitely coming from the camouflaged sphere outside.Out, Valseir.Now.And another burst.This time from above.High above.Valseir pushed Fassin away.The bowl smoke ?Get out!Fassin sent, pushing the old Dweller towards the access port in the top of the diamond bubble box.Outside, the little sphere was rushing towards them.Fassin got underneath Valseir and forced him upwards.Fassin!All right!Valseir started to rise under his own power, entering the vertical access tube.The little sphere burst through the diamond bubble, shards spraying.It came to a stop just inside the jagged hole, still disguised, just a blur in the air.Major Taak!it shouted.This is General Linosu of the Shrievalty Ocula.This device is under the control of the Nasqueron Expeditionary Force.Dont be alarmed.Were coming down to  The voice cut off as the little sphere was pierced by a hair thin line of cerise light.The noise resounded, sharp and sudden, round the diamond bubble enclosure.Debris flew from the tiny machine, rattling against the far side of the private box.Fassin whirled to see Hatherence dropping down round the side of the Dzunda, carapace silvered.The laser beam had come from her.The little spherical device dropped its disguise, revealing itself as a mirror finish machine with stubby wings.It had a tiny hole in one flank, a much larger one on the far side, producing smoke.It rolled over in the air, made a crackling noise, then dropped to the transparent floor.Above him, Fassin was aware of Valseir hesitating in the access tube.Slipstream wind whistled in through the hole in the diamond bubble.The colonel swung quickly in towards them.You all right, major?she signalled, stopping immediately outside, buffeted by the slipstream.She tipped to look at the device lying rolling on the clear curved floor of the box.Shit, she sent.That looks like one of ours.There was a white flash, as though from everywhere at once, blinding Fassin for an instant.As the light faded Hatherence was already falling away, tumbling like a dropped stone through the gas.Something moved, faster than the GasClippers, across the StormWall face, carving in towards the Blimper.When the colonel had fallen twenty metres below the private box, a line of searing yellow white light flicked into existence between the incoming machine and Hatherences esuit, which erupted in fire and blew apart.The fast moving device looked like a small gascraft or missile, sharp and finned.Its exhaust flared bright as it powered round.Fassin looked down to see Hatherence.She was a dark, ragged manta shape falling, whirling downwards amongst the smoking debris of the destroyed esuit.She seemed to twist in the air, flicking round, something glinting in a stubby tentacle; a violet beam lanced towards the finned craft, missing by a metre.Another white line from the machine speared the colonel, obliterating her in a sun bright burst of light.Valseir had cleared the access tube.Fassin blasted up it like a shell up a gun barrel, letting the pulse of down draught tear the diamond bubble box out in a convulsive explosion of wreckage that whipped away from the Dzunda and followed the remains of the colonel and her esuit towards the storms concave base and the Depths beyond.Valseir was waiting in the broad corridor above.Fassin!What is going on?How do we get off this thing?he asked, taking the old Dweller by the hub arm and leading him towards the next vertical access.Do we really need to?Somethings attacking us, Valseir.Are you sure?Yes.So how do we get off?Whats wrong with roting?Bit vulnerable.I was thinking of a craft.Well, Im sure we can arrange a taxi.Or one of the Blimpers own skiffs.Ill ask Captain Xessife.No, Fassin said.Not Captain Xessife.Why not?Somebody had to put that drug bowl there.They got to the vertical.But Valseir hesitated.Wait, whats that noise?Fassin could hear a deep warbling sound coming from various directions.That could be an alarm.He indicated the tube above.After you.Lets move.They were halfway up the vertical to the central corridor when the Dzunda lurched.Oh oh, Valseir said.Keep going.When they got to the main concourse, the alarm noise was louder.Dwellers were shouting at each other, picking up dropped trays, food and drugs and staring at some of the wall screens.Fassin looked too.Oh fuck, he said quietly.The screens showed confused pictures of the surroundings, not all the cameras and screens now focusing on the still continuing GasClipper race.One camera seemed to be following a slim, finned craft, the one which had attacked Hatherence, as it circled the Blimper.Other screens showed ships, dozens of dark ships, dropping from the sky.They were gas capable Mercatoria spacecraft, some as little as fifty metres long, others three or four times that size; soot black ellipsoids with thick wings and sleek but rudimentary tailplanes and engine pods.They were diving towards the Blimper fleet, two or three peeling off every vertical klick or so to circle, guarding.Much higher above  another snatched camera angle, drifting out of focus then snapping clear more slick shapes gyrated above the high haze layer, like scavengers over carrion.Another screens view spun, then settled, jerking, on the spec tating fleets accompanying Dreadnought, the Puisiel, whose turrets were swinging, gun barrels elevating.A yellow white beam flicked on and off, boring straight through the war craft, making it shudder and sending shock waves running along its outer fabric.The beam hit the Storm Wall beyond at almost the same time, raising a dark puff of vapour like a bruise, quickly whipped away.The GasClippers seemed to have disappeared.What in all the gods farts is going on?Valseir asked.They had come to a stop, transfixed by the screens like most of the rest of the people in the concourse.The Puisiels turrets and guns continued to swing round for a moment, then came to rest, seemingly pointing in random directions.Oh, dont, Fassin said.The Dreadnoughts guns flashed, gouting fire and smoke.Smaller shapes dropped away from it at the same time, half obscured by the wreathing broadside smoke clouds, and then pulsed fire and smoke from their rears and started curving up and out towards the dropping spacecraft.Screens blinked.The dark, descending spacecraft glittered with light.Midway between the Puisiel and the scatter of black ships, piercing white lines ended in sudden detonations, filling the gas above and around the spectating fleet with black bursts of smoke.A screen swung to show one turning spacecraft dropping, trailing smoke.Dwellers started yelling.Trays, food, drugs and pet children were sent flying, carapace skins blazed naked signals of excitement and fury and whiffs of war lust filled the air as though a series of tiny scent grenades had gone off along the concourse.A black dot trailing a haze of exhaust sailed in towards the crippled spacecraft but was picked off from above in a blast of light.Then something still smaller and faster darted across the screen and hit the ship, detonating inside and tearing it entirely in half; the two torn sections flew down towards the Depths, dangled on elongating strings of smoke.The other missiles were picked off even more easily, swatted like slow insects.Fassin started pulling Valseir away.Dwellers all around them howled and barked at the screens and started taking bets.Distant concussive thumps and longer roars sounded throughout the concourse, bringing the long delayed battle sounds to accompany the near instant visuals.Dark glitterings, everywhere.The Dreadnought lit up all along its length, speckled with fire.The beams lanced it, plunging on into the Storm Wall, freckling bruises across the stir of dark gas.About a third of a last broadside, most of it aimed at where the fallen spaceship had been, punched out from the Puisiel a fraction of a second before the first beams hit.The great vessel shook like a leaf in a storm, then started to drop even as further rays riddled it.A final beam, less bright, much broader, punched through the whole central section, folding the craft about its middle and sending it flowing and spiralling downwards.A few tiny double discs drifted away from the stricken war craft and roted away or just fell, some trailing smoke.Some were hit by further beams of light, vanishing in miniature explosions.Valseir, move, Fassin whispered in the sudden silence.We have to get away.Just get to the outside.They were almost level with a 45 up access tube.Fassin nudged Valseir towards it.This way.He didnt even know if they really should get away.Maybe they were still somehow safer here in the Blimper.At least closer to the outside they might have more choice.Valseir allowed himself to be pushed towards the slope of the access tube.The lowest part of the fleet of dark ships was now almost level with the top of the spectating fleet.Howls started to fill the concourse.Fassin and Valseir were being held back from the tube entrance by a stream of Dwellers coming in the other direction.Fassin continued to push the old Dweller, though they both kept looking back at the screens.One of the dark ships circled gradually closer to the Storm Wall.Near its closest approach, a GasClipper came hurtling out of the dark curtain of whirling gas, blade sails extended like a frozen gleaming explosion.It rammed the dark warship amidships, hammering into it and pushing the two craft across the sky in a single tangled flailing mass.Still locked in their terrible embrace, the two craft started to fall away with everything else, heading for the foot of the storms great dark well and the hot crush of gas beneath.More screams and barks of joy echoed round the concourse.Another camera, another screen: a section of the StormWall was bulging, dark gas streaming around some huge rounded cone forcing its way through the storm as though it wasnt there.A huge Dreadnought flowed out of the storm, trailing streamers of gas like vast banners.Shrieks of encouragement and great, air quaking cheers resounded down the wide tunnel of the concourse, making it resonate like a vast organ pipe.The new Dreadnought silvered in an instant, white beams scattering off it as it flew into the clear gas heart of the storms colossal eye.Fuck me, Fassin heard himself say.They were waiting for them.The silver Dreadnought powered straight towards the fleet of dark ships, which, after starting to close in on the spectating fleet, were now swinging and swivelling to reconfigure and face the new threat.The Dreadnought raced forward, fire bright around its propellerless tail, guns firing and flashing.Its silvery skin, reflecting sky, storm and dark depths, sparkled with jagged scintillations, bouncing beams off in random directions like bright thrown spines.Two more of the dark ships detonated and fell, sending the Dweller screams in the concourse  and the bets  towards even wilder heights.The Dreadnought tore onwards, shaking under the weight of fire falling upon it.A missile from the fleet of Mercatoria ships slashed across the view, was missed by a fan of interceptor fire from the Dreadnought and slammed into it.There was just the hint of the start of an explosion, bursting the Dreadnought apart as though tearing open the wrapping round a piece of star, then the screen went utterly white before hazing out completely, blank.Lights in the concourse flickered and went out, came back, then faded again.The warbling sound, there but effectively unheard all this time, cut off, its absence in the sudden silence like a hearing loss.The Dzunda quivered like a struck animal.Other screens wavered, went black, filled with static.Some screens, now providing the only light in the concourse, remained working.Gradually more light filled the long tube, as low emergency lighting strobed on, caught and held.A low muttering sound of Dweller trepidation and resentment started to build.One camera swung to show the huge rolling mushroom cloud filling the space where the Dreadnought had been.A few tiny pieces of wreckage fell, far away, thin claws from a tumorously bloated fist.The dark ships started to close in again on the spectator fleet, currently composed of vessels commanded by two sorts of captains: those who thought it best to clump together and those who regarded scattering and even taking their chances with the storm winds as the safer bet.The stampede of Dwellers from the access tube which Fassin was trying to push Valseir towards was slowly forcing the two of them back into the centre of the concourse.More people were flooding into the wide space from every other access point.Somebody was screaming, Look, look!One distant screen image was suddenly repeated across several more.At first it looked like a replay of the entrance of the first Dreadnought, the great nose bulging out through, the curtain of streaming cloud, dragging gas like long flags of war.Then the view pulled back and the screen showed the Storm Wall bulging in another place, then another and another and another, until a whole vertical forest of the great ships was visible, hurtling out of the storm and towards the great column of black circling spacecraft hanging like a giant pendulum over the spectating fleet.The Dzunda shook, rippled and screamed like something alive as the shock wave of the earlier nuclear explosion seemed to pick it up and rattle it.Dwellers swung this way and that across the concourse, banging into each other, walls, floor and ceiling, filling the gas with oaths and debris.Another pair of screens cut out but enough remained to show the closing fleet of mercury coloured Dreadnoughts livid with fire outgoing and incoming.Lasers sheened off, fans of interceptor projectiles and beams combed the gas and sundered darting, twisting missiles.Two more of the dark ships, then a third, exploded or crumpled and started to fall or spiral down, but two more of the giant Dreadnoughts disappeared in massive, screen hazing detonations.A couple more Dreadnoughts were suddenly caught in a fiercely bright beam from immediately above, from out of the clear yellow sky.The beam fell between them, making each massive ship wobble as if stumbling in the gas.Then it split into two parallel shafts, each violet rod narrowing in an instant and chopping through its targeted Dreadnought like an axe through a neck.The concourse  half dark, filled with wild scents and the frenzied bellowing of Dwellers unsure whether to wail laments or shout huzzahs, lit by the spastic, spasming light of the battle views swinging wildly across the screens  achieved a sort of chaotic transcendence as very loud but defiantly soothing sounding music started to play, product of some confused automatic guest management system waking to insanity and trying to spread tranquillity.What, Fassin heard a nearby Dweller say, quite quietly but distinctly through the pandemonium, the fuck is that?(Another dark Mercatorial ship, another silver Dreadnought, ripped to shreds and blossoming in nuclear fire respectively.Another pair of Dreadnoughts shaking in the first beam fall of the violet ray flicking from on high. )And on the screen opposite, looking downwards into the wide bowl of the storms dead heart, a huge darkly red glowing globe was rising from the sump gases of the storm floor, dragging a great flute of gas after it like some absurdly steady fireball.It was kilometres across and striated, banded like a miniature gas giant, so that for one crazed instant Fassin thought he was watching the palace of the Hierchon Ormilla floating smoothly upwards into the fray.A crumpled scrap falling towards this apparition  a ruined and smoking Mercatoria spacecraft  appeared to lend a scale to the huge sphere, seeming to be about to fall just behind it, making the quickly rising globe three or four klicks across.The wrecked ship fell in front, instead, and upped that ready estimate by a factor of two.A couple of filament thin yellow white beams suddenly joined with the massive globe and seemed to sink into it without effect.The violet beam from high above swung onto it, spreading briefly as though to measure the full seven or eight kilometres of its diameter before starting to narrow.A pattern of black dots appeared on the surface of the giant globe.The Dzunda shook again and again as further blast waves crashed into it.Fassin stared at the great rising sphere even as Dwellers on either side thudded into him and he lost his hold on Valseir.There were maybe fifty or so of the black spots, spread as though randomly across the upper hemisphere of the huge globe.One appeared to be in the centre of the rapidly narrowing, focusing violet beam.Just as that ray grew too bright to see the ebony dot at its centre, it seemed to pulse and spread.Then it disappeared, just as each spot suddenly became the plinth for an intensely bright, thin column of pure white light.The beams lasted for an eye blink, disappearing almost as soon as theyd been produced, only their image lasting, burned into any naked eyes and insufficiently buffered cameras trained on them.Silence, even as another manic convulsion shook the Dzunda, making the whole concourse ripple and creak.More screens went out.The loud soothing music cut off.Two remaining screens nearby showed the dark ships, whole squadrons of them, entire flocks of them, reduced for most of their length to sparkling, wind blown ash, only the long needle noses and tailed, finned rears remaining intact to fall like meteors, unreeling scrawny trails of smoke into the storms tenebrous depths.The nearest screen showed the camera swinging across the sky, searching for an intact Mercatoria ship, only to find further drifts of smoke, new clouds of ash, already drifting on the wind.The other screens view pivoted to the sky, where something glowing yellow was fading and disappearing as it cooled, at first still keeping station with the scene directly beneath, then starting to drift away to the east.The huge sphere was still rising, though slowing now, coming gradually level with the remains of the spectating fleet.The remaining two dozen or so mirror finish Dreadnoughts were decelerating, heaving to on one side of the clumped and scattered ships.A bellowing roar of utter  and unexpected  victory built quickly in every Dweller throat along the length of the concourse, swelling to a clanging, thunderous cacophony of mind splitting, thought warping sound.Then a series of crashing, titanic shock waves pummelled the Dzunda like a gale whipping a flag.A barrage of noise like a troop of titans clapping entirely drowned out the hollering Dwellers.All the screens went dark.The Blimper Dzunda lurched for one last time, then started to fall out of the sky.Those Dwellers not already heading swiftly for the exits immediately began to do so, the ones near Fassin sweeping him along with them, up the access tube hed been trying to head for originally, out via a wide funnel port into a viewing gallery, through its massively shattered diamond roof and out into the bruised and battered skies of Nasqueron.You mean some of your ridiculous fucking fairy stories about secret ships and hyper weapons are actually true?Fassin said.Well, Ysul said, looking round.So it would appear.They were somewhere inside the Isaut, the enormous spherical ship which had destroyed almost the entire Mercatorial fleet  space based command and control plus heavy weaponry bombardment back up included  in the space of about half a second.The Isaut was something called a Planetary Protector (Deniable), not that Fassin or, apparently, anybody else rescued from the destroyed and damaged ships of the spectating fleet had ever heard of such a thing.That, as Ysul had pointed out, was a pretty unarguably convincing brand of deniability.There had, of course, been rumours and myths concerning secret Dweller martial capability and the general lack of wisdom of getting into a fight with such an ancient and widespread species for as long as people could remember, but  as most of these myths and rumours seemed to be spread by the Dwellers themselves  as a rule nobody ever really took them seriously.The Dwellers spent so much time huffing and puffing and telling people how completely wonderful and brilliant they were  and yet seemed so self obsessed, so inward looking and so careless of their distant fellows, so unconnected not just with the rest of the civilised galaxy but with their own vastly scattered diaspora  they were inevitably dismissed as vainglorious fantasists and their vaunted ships and weapons, at best, a sort of folk memory of earlier magnificence, long lost, entirely eclipsed.Even now, having just seen the results of the Isauts intervention with his own eyes  or at least through the little gascrafts sensors  Fassin could not entirely believe what hed witnessed.Well, this is a strange place to be, Valseir said, looking about the spherical space he, Ysul and Fassin had been shown to.They had rendezvoused quite quickly in the general gas borne confusion of survivors from the Dzunda.Fassins arrrowhead shaped craft, though smaller than all the surrounding Dwellers, was a sufficiently different shape for Valseir and Ysul to spot him quite without difficulty and head in his direction.Why is everybody else giving me such a wide berth?Fassin had asked when theyd each drifted up to him in the after battle calmness.It was true; all the other Dweller survivors were keeping a good fifty metres or so away from him.Worried youre going to be a target, Ysul had said, checking his various pockets and pouches to see what he might have lost in the excitement.Around them, various long smoky columns were drifting in the breeze like anaemic stalks rooted in the dark storm base far below, and great dumb bell shaped clouds  all that was left of the nuclear explosions  were twisting and slowly tearing apart, their round, barely rolling heads still climbing into higher and higher levels of atmosphere, being caught in differential wind streams and casting vast hazy shadows across the again quiet skies of the storms eye.Hovering to one side, the vast banded sphere which had risen from the Depths floated like a miniature planet caught in the eye of the great storm.To one side, in the Storm Wall, the GasClipper fleet seemed to be trying to regroup.Tumbling out of the sinking Dzunda with the rest of the survivors, only a lifelong exposure to Dweller insouciance  both congenital and feigned  had prevented Fassin gasping in disbelief at the sound of various people around him quite seriously discussing whether the GasClipper race would just continue, be restarted or declared void, and passing opinions regarding the status of already existing bets in the light of this suite of likely choices.The less damaged spectating and other craft were picking up the various free floating Dwellers.Ambulance skiffs from the surviving craft in the silver Dreadnought fleet and hospital vessels from the nearest port facilities were rescuing the more seriously injured and burned individuals.Fassin had indeed been targeted, but not by weaponry.A trio of skiffs had emerged from the giant sphere and made straight for the little group formed by Fassin and his two Dweller friends.Theyd been taken aboard and the skiffs returned immediately to the enormous globe, ignoring the outraged yells of the Dwellers who until moments before had been studiously avoiding Fassin.The lead skiff, crewed by a jolly pair of remarkably old looking Dwellers  they didnt volunteer their names, ranks or ages, but they each looked at least as old as Jundriance  had deposited them somewhere deep inside the giant spherical craft, way down a dark tunnel into a broad sphere of reception space, complete with washing facilities and what Ysul had taken one look at and sniffily dismissed as a snackateria.Before theyd left again in their skiff, it had been one of these unnamed Dwellers who, in response to a question of Fassins, had told them the name and category of the great craft theyd been brought inside.Fassin had warned him that his gascraft had been in contact with Mercatoria nanotech and he might be contaminated, which did not surprise or alarm anybody aboard as much as hed been expecting.The skiffs crew scanned the little gascraft and told him, well, he wasnt contaminated any more.Where is your little friend the Very Reverend Colonel?Ysul asked Fassin, making a show of looking around the reception space.She jumped out of her seat and raced off just before all the fun started.Shes dead, Fassin told him.Dead?Ysul rolled back.But she seemed so well armed!She shot what turned out to be a Mercatorial device, Fassin said.One of the first of their craft on the scene seemed to assume this meant she was a hostile and wasted her.Oh, Ysul said, sounding downcast.That was the Mercatoria, was it?Not these Disconnected people.You sure?Im fairly sure, Fassin said.Damn, Ysul said, sounding annoyed.Might sort of look like Ive lost a bet, in that case.Wonder how I can get out of it?He floated off, looking deep in thought.Fassin turned to Valseir.You sure youre all right?he asked.The old Dweller had looked a little shaken when theyd rendezvoused in the gas above the sinking Blimper, though apart from a few carapace abrasions picked up in the welter of people rushing to escape the sinking ship, he was uninjured.I am fine, Fassin, he told the human.And you?You have lost your colonel friend, I heard.Fassin had a sudden reprise of his last image of Hatherence, that dark manta shape twisting in the air  to a Dweller she would have looked like one of their young  firing a hand weapon at the craft that had ripped her out of her esuit, then dying in the returning splash of fire.Im getting used to anybody who gets close to me dying violently, he said.Hmm.I consider myself warned, Valseir said.She was my superior, Valseir, Fassin told him.She was my bodyguard but she was also my guard in another sense.Id be surprised if she hadnt been given orders to kill me if the relevant circumstances arose.Do you think she would have carried out those orders?Fassin hesitated, suddenly feeling bad about what hed just said, even though he still thought it was the truth.It was as though hed insulted Hatherences memory.He looked away and said, Well, well never know now, will we?A door in the centre of the ceiling swung back.They all looked up.Two Dwellers entered.Fassin recognised one of them as Setstyin, the self confessed influence pedlar hed talked to by phone the evening hed slipped away from Ysuls house in Hauskip city.The other Dweller looked very old indeed, dark and small  barely five metres in diameter  and dressed in high coverage clothes that probably concealed only a few remaining natural limbs and perhaps some prosthetics.Seer Fassin Taak, Setstyin said, roll nodding towards him.Then he greeted Ysul and lastly Valseir  as the most senior of the three Valseir came last and got an even more respectful bow.Ysul, Valseir: allow me to introduce the Sage cuspian chospe Drunisine, Executive Commander of this craft, the Planetary Protector (Deniable) Isaut.A pleasure, said the dark Dweller in a crisp, dry sounding voice.And for us an honour, Ysul said, brushing Fassin out of the way to present himself to the fore and execute an extravagantly complete bow.If I may say so.Our pleasure, pre child, Valseir half agreed, also roll bowing, less completely but with more dignity.Good to see you, Setstyin, Fassin said.And pleased to meet you, sir, he told the older Dweller.Drunisine was by far the oldest and most senior Dweller Fassin had ever encountered.As a Dweller  surviving the perils of childhood first, obviously  rose through Adolescence, Youth and Adulthood to attain the life stages called Prime and then Cuspian and then Sage, what they were eventually aiming for  destined for, if they lived that long  was to reach Childhood, the state of utter done everythingness that was the absolute zenith of all Dweller existence.The stage immediately before this culmination was the one which Drunisine had reached: chospe   pre child.There was every chance that Drunisine was over two billion years old.My name is Setstyin, the other Dweller said, coming to rest near the centre of the spherical room with the Sage and looking round at the others.I am a friend of Seer Taaks here.You are all sufficiently recovered and or rested, I hope.Because we need to talk.They agreed they were capable of talk.Setstyin waved and hammock seats descended from a ring round the ceiling door, which then closed.They settled in.Seer Taak, the ancient Dweller said.We will need to ensure that all record of the battle just finished is wiped from the memories of that little craft you inhabit.I understand, Fassin said.He thought about that (Deniable).He called up everything hed recorded of the battle in the storms eye and full deleted it.He called up a lot of other stored memories and got rid of those too.Its done, he said.We will need to check, Setstyin told him, sounding apologetic.Feel free, Fassin said.I take it were not supposed to say anything about what happened out there.Or about this thing.Say what you like, young sir, Drunisine told him.Our concern is with hard evidence.All surviving non Dweller surveillance systems around Nasqueron have been removed, Setstyin said, talking to Fassin.All the transgressing ships which had line of sight to the proceedings have already been destroyed.The remains of the Mercatorial fleet are being pursued and dispatched.They are being hunted down like dogs, Seer Taak, Drunisine said, looking straight at him and using the Anglish word.Harried, systems jammed, comms disrupted, fates sealed, all so that no direct evidence of this craft or its capabilities, even that garnered second hand, can escape.I might add that your own summary annihilation was contemplated.I am grateful to have been made an exception, Fassin said.Are none of the ships which were above Nasqueron to be allowed to escape?None, the ancient Dweller said.Those who start wars have to accept the consequences, Ysul said, rumbling sententiously.And after that?Fassin asked.Specify, please.Is this the start of a war with the Mercatoria, at least the part within Ulubis?I dont imagine so, Drunisine said, sounding as though this was the first time the thought had occurred.Not unless they choose to invade us again.Do you think they will, Fassin Taak?Fassin had the awful feeling that, given the Dwellers irredeemably dismissive approach to intelligence, what he said next might well constitute the single most germane piece of information on the matter that the Dwellers would have to work with and base their decisions on.No, I dont.I think theyll be sufficiently horrified at the extent of their losses today to think twice about risking any further craft, certainly as long as they have the prospect of invasion to look forward to.If the invasion fails, or the system is finally recaptured, then there might be some attempt to find out what happened and no doubt some people will argue that there should be some form of reprisal.Though, in the shorter term, from what little Ive heard of the Epiphany 5 Disconnect, theres a chance they might want to, ah, transgress, too.He looked at Drunisine and Setstyin, who remained silent.Though Im sure youll be ready for them.More silence.In fact, if the Ulubis Mercatoria work out whats happened here and realise you dont regard this as the start of a war, they might even want to suggest that you and they unite to resist the Epiphany 5 Disconnect forces.Why would we wish to do that?Drunisine asked flatly.It felt like it had been a long and tiring day.Fassin didnt really have the energy to start trying to explain.From a creature as old and experienced as Drunisine, the question was probably rhetorical anyway.Never mind, Fassin said.Act as though nothings happened.Signal glantine and make some helpful suggestions regarding the re establishment of a new Seer Shared Facility  Thats more or less what we were going to do anyway, Setstyin said, sounding amused.Fassin signalled polite mirth in return.He was still struggling to work out what this enormous, fleets destroyed in an eyeblink craft really meant.Who was responsible for this colossal machine?What sort of previously unknown societal structures and prodigious manufacturing capacity within Dweller civilisation could conjure up something this awesome?Was it a one off?Was it unique to Nasqueron?Dear grief, was it part of a fleet?Did this mean that all the Dweller claims about secret ships and hyper weapons were true?Could the Nasqueron Dwellers just swat the E 5 Discon out of the sky if they so desired, saving Ulubis from invasion?Could they feasibly take on the Mercatoria if they could be bothered?Did any of this mean that the Dweller List was now more likely to be genuine rather than some monstrous waste of time or just a joke?How hed have liked to have had some time alone with Setstyin before this meeting, to find out what had happened since theyd talked last.Hed have to ask some of these questions anyway, given half a chance.We come, then, Drunisine said, to the question of why the Ulubis Mercatoria Disconnect thought it might be a wise or profitable idea to enter Nasqueron in such a manner and in such numbers in the first place.Any ideas?Anybody?The ancient Dweller looked round at all of them.I think it might have something to do with me, Fassin admitted.You, Seer Taak?Drunisine asked.Ive been here attempting to track down some information.And you needed the help of a small war fleet to extract it?No.However, they might have thought I was in danger.From whom?I dont know.So, we are talking about information that the Mercatoria might consider momentous enough to start a war for?When they are already facing an invasion in the next few months or years?This must be information of some importance.Perhaps we can help.What is it?Thank you.However, I think I may finally be close to finding it.Ah, Valseir said.About that.What?Fassin asked him.All that stuff about the folder and the safekeep box and taking it personally to Chimilinith of Deilte?Yes?Not entirely true.Not entirely?Not entirely.So how much of it was true?Valseir rocked back a fraction, seemingly thinking.Patterns of surprise crossed his signal skin.Actually, most of it, he said.And the part that wasnt?Fassin asked patiently.There was no folder in the safekeep box.So Chimilinith hasnt got the information.Correct.I see.I am still waiting for enlightenment regarding the exact nature of this exemplary, if shy, information, Drunisine said frostily, looking at Valseir.Oh shit, Fassin thought, if Valseir tells them what it is, and it really exists, they might just kill us all.Possibly the same thought had occurred to Valseir.It allegedly involves a method for travelling faster than light, he told the ancient commander.Setstyins carapace flashed hilarity, quickly damped.Drunisine looked about as thoroughly unimpressed as it was possible for an elderly Dweller to look.What?he said.An ancient addition to a still more ancient book  which Seer Taak here traded over two hundred years ago during a delve, as the Quick call these things  makes mention of a method of achieving FTL travel without recourse to Adjutage and Cannula, Valseir said, using what Fassin recognised as the Dweller terms for portals and wormholes.Fassin thought  and sincerely hoped  that Valseir had put just the right amount of apology and wry amusement into his voice.Seer Taak has been sent here to try to find the details of this, ah, unlikely technology.Indeed?Drunisine said, looking at Fassin.Algebra, he blurted.Algebra?Drunisine asked.The data looks like a piece of algebra, apparently, Fassin said.It defines some sort of warping device.A way of bending space.Conventional to start with, but using this technique to exceed light speed.Fassin made a gesture of resignation.He let embarrassment patterns show on his arrowheads skin.Iwas seconded without any real choice into a paramilitary part of the Mercatoria and ordered to undertake this mission.I am as sceptical as I imagine you are, sir, regarding the likelihood of it coming to a successful conclusion.Drunisine let the most formal amusement pattern show on his skin.Oh, I doubt that you are, Seer Taak.Whats going on?I was about to ask you the same question, Setstyin told Fassin.Shall we trade?All right, but I asked first.What exactly do you want to know?They were still in the reception sphere inside the giant globe.Commander Drunisine had left.Two Adult medical orderlies were dealing with the few small injuries that Ysul and Valseir had picked up during the battle.What is this thing?Fassin asked, gesturing to indicate the whole ship.Where did it come from?Who made it?Who controls it?How many are there in Nasqueron?Id have thought the title said it all, Setstyin said.Its a machine to protect the planet.From willed aggression of a certain technical type and sophistication.Its not a spacecraft, if thats what you mean.Its limited to in atmosphere.It came from the Depths, where stuff like this is usually stored.We made it.I mean Dwellers did, probably a few billion years ago.Id have to check.Its controlled by people in the control centre, wholl be Dwellers with military experience whove sim trained for this sort of device specifically.As to numbers I wouldnt know.Probably not the sort of information ones meant to share, really.No offence, Fass, but in the end youre not actually one of us.We have to assume your loyalties lie elsewhere.Built billions of years ago?Can you still?Ah, that would count as a follow up question, Setstyin said, chiding.I think its my turn first.Fassin sighed.All right.Are you really looking for this warp drive FTL technology data?You do realise it doesnt exist, dont you?Its data that the Mercatoria believe might give them a better chance of winning the fight against the E 5 Discon.They are desperate.Theyll try anything.And I have my orders, no matter what I might think about the whole thing.Of course I know independent FTL drives dont exist.Will you still obey these orders, given the chance?Fassin thought about Aun Liss, about the people hed known in Hab 4409, about all the other people hed ever known throughout Ulubis system over the years.Yes, he said.Why do you obey these orders?Setstyin sounded genuinely puzzled.Your family and Seer Sept colleagues are almost all dead, your immediate military superior was killed in the recent battle and there is nobody nearby now to take her place.Its complicated, Fassin told Setstyin.Perhaps its duty or a guilty conscience or just the desire to be doing something.Can you still make more of these planetary protection machines?No idea, Setstyin admitted.Dont see why not, though.Id suggest asking somebody who might know, but even if the true answer was no wed be bound to say yes, wouldnt we?Was it my call to you that set all this in motion?Youre getting a lot of free questions, arent you?However, yes, it did.Though I suspect that watching dozens of recently modified gas capable warcraft suddenly parking themselves in orbit around us might have started a few alarm bells ringing amongst us even without your timely warning.Still, were grateful.I dont think Im entirely out of formation in saying that there is a feeling we probably owe you a favour.And if the Mercatoria ever finds out, Fassin said, Ill be executed as a traitor.Well, we wont tell if you dont, Setstyin said, perfectly seriously.Deal, Fassin said, unconvinced.The great spherical craft Isaut floated deep within a vast cloud of streaming gas, moving swiftly, seeming not to.It had started to submerge into the storms curdled floor of slowly swirling gas almost as soon as Fassin and the others had been brought aboard.Sinking, sidling, rising slightly again, it had entered into the Zone 2 weather band, quickly assumed its speed, and was now, in the late evening that was becoming night, half a thousand kilometres away from the storm where the battle had taken place, and adding another three hundred kilometres to that value with every passing hour.Fassin, Ysul, Valseir and Setstyin floated over a narrow platform set at the great vessels equator, near the body of Colonel Hatherence.A weak light and weaker breeze lent an appropriate atmosphere of quiet gloom to the scene.The colonels torn, burned body had been discovered along with hundreds of others, floating at the level at which Dweller bodies usually came to rest.Hers had come to rest a little higher than the others, as would a childs.Left to themselves, Dweller bodies degassed and gained density, and abandoned to the atmosphere would eventually disappear completely into the Depths.
