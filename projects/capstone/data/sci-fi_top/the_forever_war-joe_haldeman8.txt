The computer facilities and energy you go through in three weeks would keep the Earth running for several days.Too expensive for us deskwarmers.Your decorations say youre combat.Honorary.I was.The rum Antares was a tall slender glass with a little ice floating at the top, filled with pale amber liquid.At the bottom was a bright red globule about the size of a thumbnail; crimson filaments waved up from it.Whats that red stuff?Cinnamon.Oh, some ester with cinnamon in it.Quite good  want a taste?No, Ill stick to beer, thanks.Down at level one, the library machine has a temporal orientation file, that my staff updates every day.You can go to it for specific questions.Mainly I want to  prepare you for meeting your Strike Force.What, theyre all cyborgs?Clones?He laughed.No, its illegal to clone humans.The main problem is with, uh, youre heterosexual.Oh, thats no problem.Im tolerant.Yes, your profile shows that you  think youre tolerant, but thats not the problem, exactly.Oh, I knew what he was going to say.Not the details, but the substance.Only emotionally stable people are drafted into UNEF.I know this is hard for you to accept, but heterosexuality is considered an emotional dysfunction.Relatively easy to cure.If they think theyre going to cure me  Relax, youre too old.He took a delicate sip.It wont be as hard to get along with them as you might  Wait.You mean nobody  everybody in my company is homosexual?But me?William, everybody on Earth is homosexual.Except for a thousand or so; veterans and incurables.Ah.What could I say?Seems like a drastic way to solve the population problem.Perhaps.It does work, though; Earths population is stable at just under a billion.When one person dies or goes off planet, another is quickened.Notborn.Born, yes, but not the old fashioned way.Your old term for it wastest tube babies, but of course they dont use a test tube.Well, thats something.Part of every creche is an artificial womb that takes care of a person the first eight or ten months after quickening.What you would call birth takes place over a period of days; it isnt the sudden, drastic event that it used to be.O brave new world, I thought.No birth trauma.A billion perfectly adjusted homosexuals.Perfectly adjusted by present day Earth standards.You and I might find them a little odd.Thats an understatement.I drank off the rest of my beer.Yourself, you, uh  are you homosexual?Oh, no, he said.I relaxed.Actually, though, Im not hetero anymore, either.He slapped his hip and it made an odd sound.Got wounded and it turned out that I had a rare disorder of the lymphatic system, cant regenerate.Nothing but metal and plastic from the waist down.To use your word, Im a cyborg.Far out, as my mother used to say.Oh, Private, I called to the waiter, bring me one of those Antares things.Sitting here in a bar with an asexual cyborg who is probably the only other normal person on the whole goddamned planet.Make it a double, please.2  They looked normal enough, filing into the lecture hall where we held our first muster, the next day.Rather young and a little stiff.Most of them had only been out of the creche for seven or eight years.The creche was a controlled, isolated environment to which only a few specialists pediatricians and teachers, mostly  had access.When a person leaves the creche at age twelve or thirteen, he chooses a first name (his last name having been taken from the donor parent with the higher genetic rating) and is legally a probationary adult, with schooling about equivalent to what I had after my first year of college.Most of them go on to more specialized education, but some are assigned a job and go right to work.Theyre observed very closely and anyone who shows any signs of sociopathy, such as heterosexual leanings, is sent away to a correctional facility.Hes either cured or kept there for the rest of his life.Everyone is drafted into UNEF at the age of twenty.Most people work at a desk for five years and are discharged.A few lucky souls, about one in eight thousand, are invited to volunteer for combat training.Refusing is sociopathic, even though it means signing up for an extra five years.And your chance of surviving the ten years is so small as to be negligible; nobody ever had.Your best chance is to have the war end before your ten (subjective) years of service are up.Hope that time dilation puts many years between each of your battles.Since you can figure on going into battle roughly once every subjective year, and since an average of 34 percent survive each battle, its easy to compute your chances of being able to fight it out for ten years.It comes to about two one thousandths of one percent.Or, to put it another way, get an old fashioned six shooter and play Russian Roulette with four of the six chambers loaded.If you can do it ten times in a row without decorating the opposite wall, congratulations!Youre a civilian.There being some sixty thousand combat soldiers in UNEF, you could expect about 1.2 of them to survive for ten years.I didnt seriously plan on being the lucky one, even though I was halfway there.How many of these young soldiers filing into the auditorium knew they were doomed?I tried to match faces up with the dossiers Id been scanning ail morning, but it was hard.Theyd all been selected through the same battery of stringent parameters, and they looked remarkably alike: tall but not too tall, muscular but not heavy, intelligent but not in a brooding way  and Earth was much more racially homogenous than it had been in my century.Most of them looked vaguely Polynesian.Only two of them, Kayibanda and Lin, seemed pure representatives of racial types.I wondered whether the others gave them a hard time.Most of the women were achingly handsome, but I was in no position to be critical.Id been celibate for over a year, ever since saying goodbye to Marygay, back on Heaven.I wondered if one of them might have a trace of atavism, or might humor her commanders eccentricity.It is absolutely forbidden for an officer to form sexual liaison with his subordinates.Such a warm way of putting it.Violation of this regulation is punishable by attachment of all funds and reduction to the rank of private or, if the relationship interferes with a units combat efficiency, summary execution.If all of UNEFs regulations could be broken so casually and consistently as that one was, it would be a very easygoing army.But not one of the boys appealed to me.How theyd look after another year, I wasnt sure.Tench hut!That was Lieutenant Hilleboe.It was a credit to my new reflexes that I didnt jump to my feet.Everybody in the auditorium snapped to.My name is Lieutenant Hilleboe and I am your Second Field Officer.That used to be Field First Sergeant.A good sign that an army has been around too long is that it starts getting top heavy with officers.Hilleboe came on like a real hard ass professional soldier.Probably shouted orders at the mirror every morning, while she was shaving.But Id seen her profile and knew that shed only been in action once, and only for a couple of minutes at that.Lost an arm and a leg and was commissioned, same as me, as a result of the tests they give at the regeneration clinic.Hell, maybe she had been a very pleasant person before going through that trauma; it was bad enough just having one limb regrown.She was giving them the usual first sergeant peptalk, stern but fair: dont waste my time with little things, use the chain of command, most problems can be solved at the fifth echelon.It made me wish Id had more time to talk with her earlier.Strike Force Command had really rushed us into this first muster  we were scheduled to board ship the next day  and Id only had a few words with my officers.Not enough, because it was becoming clear that Hilleboe and I had rather disparate philosophies about how to run a company.It was true that running it was her job; I only commanded.But she was setting up a potential good guy bad guy situation, using the chain of command to so isolate herself from the men and women under her.I had planned not to be quite so aloof, setting aside an hour every other day when any soldier could come to me directly with grievances or suggestions, without permission from his superiors.We had both been given the same information during our three weeks in the can.It was interesting that wed arrived at such different conclusions about leadership.This Open Door policy, for instance, had shown good results in modern armies in Australia and America.And it seemed especially appropriate to our situation, in which everybody would be cooped up for months or even years at a time.Wed used the system on the Sangre y Victoria, the last starship to which Id been attached, and it had seemed to keep tensions down.She had them at ease while delivering this organizational harangue; pretty soon shed call them to attention and introduce me.What would I talk about?Id planned just to say a few predictable words and explain my Open Door policy, then turn them over to Commodore Antopol, who would say something about the Masaryk II.But Id better put off my explanation until after Id had a long talk with Hilleboe; in fact, it would be best if she were the one to introduce the policy to the men and women, so it wouldnt look like the two of us were at loggerheads.My executive officer, Captain Moore, saved me.He came rushing through a side door  he was always rushing, a pudgy meteor  threw a quick salute and handed me an envelope that contained our combat orders.I had a quick whispered conference with the Commodore, and she agreed that it wouldnt do any harm to tell them where we were going, even though the rank and file technically didnt have the need to know.One thing we didnt have to worry about in this war was enemy agents.With a good coat of paint, a Tauran might be able to disguise himself as an ambulatory mushroom.Bound to raise suspicions.Hilleboe had called them to attention and was dutifully telling them what a good commander I was going to be; that Id been in the war from the beginning, and if they intended to survive through their enlistment they had better follow my example.She didnt mention that I was a mediocre soldier with a talent for getting missed.Nor that Id resigned from the army at the earliest opportunity and only got back in because conditions on Earth were so intolerable.Thank you, Lieutenant.I took her place at the podium.At ease.I unfolded the single sheet that had our orders, and held it up.I have some good news and some bad news.What had been a joke five centuries before was now just a statement of fact.These are our combat orders for the Sade 138 campaign.The good news is that we probably wont be fighting, not immediately.The bad news is that were going to be a target.They stirred a little bit at that, but nobody said anything or took his eyes off me.Good discipline.Or maybe just fatalism; I didnt know how realistic a picture they had of their future.Their lack of a future, that is.What we are ordered to do  is to find the largest portal planet orbiting the Sade 138 collapsar and build a base there.Then stay at the base until we are relieved.That will be two or three years, probably.During that time we will almost certainly be attacked.As most of you probably know, Strike Force Command has uncovered a pattern in the enemys movements from collapsar to collapsar.They hope eventually to trace this complex pattern back through time and space and find the Taurans home planet.For the present, they can only send out intercepting forces, to hamper the enemys expansion.In a large perspective, this is what were ordered to do.Well be one of several dozen strike forces employed in these blocking maneuvers, on the enemys frontier.I wont be able to stress often enough or hard enough how important this mission is  if UNEF can keep the enemy from expanding, we may be able to envelop him.And win the war.Preferably before were all dead meat.One thing I want to be clear: we may be attacked the day we land, or we may simply occupy the planet for ten years and come on home.Fat chance.Whatever happens, every one of us will stay in the best fighting trim all the time.In transit, we will maintain a regular program of calisthenics as well as a review of our training.Especially construction techniques we have to set up the base and its defense facilities in the shortest possible time.God, I was beginning to sound like an officer.Any questions?There were none.Then Id like to introduce Commodore Antopol.Commodore?The commodore didnt try to hide her boredom as she outlined, to this room full of ground pounders, the characteristics and capabilities of Masaryk II.I had learned most of what she was saying through the cans force feeding, but the last thing she said caught my attention.Sade 138 will be the most distant collapsar men have gone to.It isnt even in the galaxy proper, but rather is part of the Large Magellanic Cloud, some 150,000 light years distant.Our voyage will require four collapsar jumps and will last some four months, subjective.Maneuvering into collapsar insertion will put us about three hundred years behind Stargates calendar by the time we reach Sade 138.And another seven hundred years gone, if I lived to return.Not that it would make that much difference; Marygay was as good as dead and there wasnt another person alive who meant anything to me.As the major said, you mustnt let these figures lull you into complacency.The enemy is also headed for Sade 138; we may all get there the same day.The mathematics of the situation is complicated, but take our word for it; its going to be a close race.Major, do you have anything more for them?I started to rise.Well  Tench hut!Hilleboe shouted.Had to learn to expect that.Only that Id like to meet with my senior officers, echelon 4 and above, for a few minutes.Platoon sergeants, youre responsible for getting your troops to Staging Area 67 at 0400 tomorrow morning.Your times your own until then.Dismissed.I invited the five officers up to my billet and brought out a bottle of real French brandy.It had cost two months pay, but what else could I do with the money?Invest it?I passed around glasses but Alsever, the doctor, demurred.Instead she broke a little capsule under her nose and inhaled deeply.Then tried without too much success to mask her euphoric expression.First lets get down to one basic personnel problem, I said, pouring.Do all of you know that Im not homosexual?Mixed chorus of yes sirs and no sirs.Do you think this is going to  complicate my situation as commander?As far as the rank and file?Sir, I dont Moore began.No need for honorifics, I said, not in this closed circle; I was a private four years ago, in my own time frame.When there arent any troops around, Im just Mandella, or William.I had a feeling that was a mistake even as I was saying it.Go on.Well, William, he continued, it might have been a problem a hundred years ago.You know how people felt then.Actually, I dont.All I know about the period from the twenty first century to the present is military history.Oh.Well, it was, uh, it was, how to say it?His hands fluttered.It was a crime, Alsever said laconically.That was when the Eugenics Council was first getting people used to the idea of universal homosex.Eugenics Council?Part of UNEF.Only has authority on Earth.She took a deep sniff at the empty capsule.The idea was to keep people from making babies the biological way.Because, A, people showed a regrettable lack of sense in choosing their genetic partner.And B, the Council saw that racial differences had an unnecessarily divisive effect on humanity; with total control over births, they could make everybody the same race in a few generations.I didnt know they had gone quite that far.But I suppose it was logical.You approve?As a doctor.As a doctor?Im not sure.She took another capsule from her pocket and rolled it between thumb and forefinger, staring at nothing.Or something the rest of us couldnt see.In a way, it makes my job simpler.A lot of diseases simply no longer exist.But I dont think they know as much about genetics as they think they do.Its not an exact science; they could be doing something very wrong, and the results wouldnt show up for centuries.She cracked the capsule under her nose and took two deep breaths.As a woman, though, Im all in favor of it.Hilleboe and Rusk nodded vigorously.Not having to go through childbirth?Thats part of it.She crossed her eyes comically, looking at the capsule, gave it a final sniff.Mostly, though, its not  having to  have a man.Inside me.You understand.Its disgusting.Moore laughed.If you havent tried it, Diana, dont  Oh, shut up.She threw the empty capsule at him playfully.But its perfectly natural, I protested.So is swinging through trees.Digging for roots with a blunt stick.Progress, my good major; progress.Anyway, Moore said, it was only a crime for a short period.Then it was considered a, oh, curable   Dysfunction, Alsever said.Thank you.And now, well, its so rare  I doubt that any of the men and women have any strong feelings about it, one way or the other.Just an eccentricity, Diana said, magnanimously.Not as if you ate babies.Thats right, Mandella, Hilleboe said.I dont feel any differently toward you because of it.I  Im glad.That was just great.It was dawning on me that I had not the slightest idea of how to conduct myself socially.So much of my normal behavior was based on a complex unspoken code of sexual etiquette.Was I suppose to treat the men like women, and vice versa?Or treat everybody like brothers and sisters?It was all very confusing.I finished off my glass and set it down.Well, thanks for your reassurances.That was mainly what I wanted to ask you about  Im sure you all have things to do, good byes and such.Dont let me hold you prisoner.They all wandered off except for Charlie Moore.He and I decided to go on a monumental binge, trying to hit every bar and officers club in the sector.We managed twelve and probably could have hit them all, but I decided to get a few hours sleep before the next days muster.The one time Charlie made a pass at me, he was very polite about it.I hoped my refusal was also polite  but figured Id be getting lots of practice.3  UNEFs first starships had been possessed of a kind of spidery, delicate beauty.But with various technological improvements, structural strength became more important than conserving mass (one of the old ships would have folded up like an accordion if youd tried a twenty five gee maneuver), and that was reflected in the design: stolid, heavy, functional looking.The only decoration was the name MASARYK a, stenciled in dull blue letters across the obsidian hull.Our shuttle drifted over the name on its way to the loading bay, and there was a crew of tiny men and women doing maintenance on the hull.With them as a reference, we could see that the letters were a good hundred meters tall.The ship was over a kilometer long (1036.5 meters, my latent memory said), and about a third that wide (319.4, meters).That didnt mean there was going to be plenty of elbowroom.In its belly, the ship held six large tachyondrive fighters and fifty robot drones.The infantry was tucked off in a corner.War is the province of friction, Chuck von Clausewitz said; I had a feeling we were going to put him to the test.We had about six hours before going into the acceleration tank.I dropped my kit in the tiny billet that would be my home for the next twenty months and went off to explore.Charlie had beaten me to the lounge and to the privilege of being first to evaluate the quality of Masaryk IIs coffee.Rhinoceros bile, he said.At least it isnt soya, I said, taking a first cautious sip.Decided I might be longing for soya in a week.The officers lounge was a cubicle about three meters by four, metal floor and walls, with a coffee machine and a library readout.Six hard chairs and a table with a typer on it.Jolly place, isnt it?He idly punched up a general index on the library machine.Lots of military theory.Thats good.Refresh our memories.Sign up for officer training?Me?No.Orders.At least you have an excuse.He slapped the on off button and watched the green spot dwindle.I signed up.They didnt tell me itd feel like this.Yeah.He wasnt talking about any subtle problem: burden of responsibility or anything.They say it wears off, a little at a time.All of that information they force into you; a constant silent whispering.Ah, there you are.Hilleboe came through the door and exchanged greetings with us.She gave the room a quick survey, and it was obvious that the Spartan arrangements met with her approval.Will you be wanting to address the company before we go into the acceleration tanks?No, I dont see why that would be  necessary.I almost said desirable.The art of chastising subordinates is a delicate art.I could see that Id have to keep reminding Hilleboe that she wasnt in charge.Or I could just switch insignia with her.Let her experience the joys of command.You could, please, round up all platoon leaders and go over the immersion sequence with them.Eventually well be doing speed drills.But for now, I think the troops could use a few hours rest.If they were as hungover as their commander.Yes, sir.She turned and left.A little miffed, because what Id asked her to do should properly have been a job for Riland or Rusk.Charlie eased his pudgy self into one of the hard chairs and sighed.Twenty months on this greasy machine.With her.Shit.Well, if youre nice to me, I wont billet the two of you together.All right.Im your slave forever.Starting, oh, next Friday.He peered into his cup and decided against drinking the dregs.Seriously, shes going to be a problem.What are you going to do with her?I dont know.Charlie was being insubordinate, too, of course.But he was my XO and out of the chain of command.Besides, I had to have one friend.Maybe shell mellow, once were under weigh.Sure.Technically, we were already under weigh, crawling toward the Stargate collapsar at one gee.But that was only for the convenience of the crew; its hard to batten down the hatches in free fall.The trip wouldnt really start until we were in the tanks.The lounge was too depressing, so Charlie and I used the remaining hours of mobility to explore the ship.The bridge looked like any other computer facility; they had dispensed with the luxury of viewscreens.We stood at a respectful distance while Antopol and her officers went through a last series of checks before climbing into the tanks and leaving our destiny to the machines.Actually, there was a porthole, a thick plastic bubble, in the navigation room forward.Lieutenant Williams wasnt busy, the pre insertion part of his job being fully automated, so he was glad to show us around.He tapped the porthole with a fingernail.Hope we dont have to use this, this trip.How so?Charlie said.We only use it if we get lost.If the insertion angle was off by a thousandth of a radian, we were liable to wind up on the other side of the galaxy.We can get a rough idea of our position by analyzing the spectra of the brightest stars.Thumbprints.Identify three and we can triangulate.Then find the nearest collapsar and get back on the rack, I said.Thats the problem.Sade 138 is the only collapsar we know of in the Magellanic Clouds.We know of it only because of captured enemy data.Even if we could find another collapsar, assuming we got lost in the cloud, we wouldnt know how to insert.Thats great.Its not as though wed be actually lost, he said with a rather wicked expression.We could zip up in the tanks, aim for Earth and blast away at full power.Wed get there in about three months, ship time.Sure, I said.But 150,000 years in the future.At twenty five gees, you get to nine tenths the speed of light in less than a month.From then on, youre in the arms of Saint Albert.Well, that is a drawback, he said.But at least wed find out whod won the war.It made you wonder how many soldiers had gotten out of the war in just that way.There were forty two strike forces lost somewhere and unaccounted for.It was possible that all of them were crawling through normal space at near lightspeed and would show up at Earth or Stargate one by one over the centuries.A convenient way to go AWOL, since once you were out of the chain of collapsar jumps youd be practically impossible to track down.Unfortunately, your jump sequence was pre programmed by Strike Force Command; the human navigator only came into the picture if a miscalculation slipped you into the wrong wormhole, and you popped out in some random part of space.Charlie and I went on to inspect the gym, which was big enough for about a dozen people at a time.I asked him to make up a roster so that everyone could work out for an hour each day when we were out of the tanks.The mess area was only a little larger than the gym even with four staggered shifts, the meals would be shoulder to shoulder affairs and the enlisted men and womens lounge was even more depressing than the officers.I was going to have a real morale problem on my hands long before the twenty months were up.The armorers bay was as large as the gym, mess hall and both lounges put together.It had to be, because of the great variety of infantry weapons that had evolved over the centuries.The basic weapon was still the fighting suit, though it was much more sophisticated than that first model I had been squeezed into, just before the Aleph Null campaign.Lieutenant Riland, the armory officer, was supervising his four subordinates, one from each platoon, who were doing a last minute check of weapons storage.Probably the most important job on the whole ship, when you contemplate what could happen to all those tons of explosives and radioactives under twenty five gees.I returned his perfunctory salute.Everything going all right, Lieutenant?Yessir, except for those damned swords.For use in the stasis field.No way we can orient them that they wont be bent.Just hope they dont break.I couldnt begin to understand the principles behind the stasis field; the gap between present day physics and my masters degree in the same subject was as long as the time that separated Galileo and Einstein.But I knew the effects.Nothing could move at greater than 16.3 meters per second inside the field, which was a hemispherical (in space, spherical) volume about fifty meters in radius.Inside, there was no such thing as electromagnetic radiation; no electricity, no magnetism, no light.From inside your suit, you could see your surroundings in ghostly monochrome which phenomenon was glibly explained to me as being due to phase transference of quasi energy leaking through from an adjacent tachyon reality, so much phlogiston to me.The result of it, though, was to make, all conventional weapons of warfare useless.Even a nova bomb was just an inert lump inside the field.And any creature, Terran or Tauran, caught inside the field without the proper insulation would die in a fraction of a second.At first it looked as though we had come upon the ultimate weapon.There were five engagements where whole Tauran bases were wiped out without any human ground casualties.All you had to do was carry the field to the enemy (four husky soldiers could handle it in Earth gravity) and watch them die as they slipped in through the fields opaque wall.The people carrying the generator were invulnerable except for the short periods when they might have to turn the thing off to get their bearings.The sixth time the field was used, though, the Taurans were ready for it.They wore protective suits and were armed with sharp spears, with which they could breach the suits of the generator carriers.From then on the carriers were armed.Only three other such battles had been reported, although a dozen strike forces had gone out with the stasis field.The others were still fighting, or still en route, or had been totally defeated.There was no way to tell unless they came back.And they werent encouraged to come back if Taurans were still in control of their real estate supposedly that constituted desertion under fire, which meant execution for all officers (although rumor had it that they were simply brainwiped, imprinted and sent back into the fray).Will we be using the stasis field, sir?Riland asked.Probably.Not at first, not unless the Taurans are already there.I dont relish the thought of living in a suit, day in and day out.Neither did I relish the thought of using sword, spear, throwing knife; no matter how many electronic illusions Id sent to Valhalla with them.Checked my watch.Well, wed better get on down to the tanks, Captain.Make sure everythings squared away.We had about two hours before the insertion sequence would start.The room the tanks were in resembled a huge chemical factory; the floor was a good hundred meters in diameter and jammed with, bulky apparatus painted a uniform, dull gray.The eight tanks were arranged almost symmetrically around the central elevator, the symmetry spoiled by the fact that one of the tanks was twice the size of the others.That would be the command tank, for all the senior officers and supporting specialists.Sergeant Blazynski stepped out from behind one of the tanks and saluted.I didnt return his salute.What the hell is that?In all that universe of gray, there was one spot of color.Its a cat, sir.Do tell.A big one, too, and bright calico.It looked ridiculous, draped over the sergeants shoulder.Let me rephrase the question: what the hell is a cat doing here?Its the maintenance squads mascot, sir.The cat raised its head enough to hiss half heartedly at me, then returned to its flaccid repose.I looked at Charlie and he shrugged back.It seems kind of cruel, he said.To the sergeant: You wont get much use of it.After twenty five gees, itll be just so much fur and guts.Oh no, sir!Sirs.He ruffed back the fur between the creatures shoulders.It had a fluorocarbon fitting imbedded there, just like the one above my hipbone.We bought it at a store on Stargate, already modified.Lots of ships have them now, sir.The Commodore signed the forms for us.Well, that was her right; maintenance was under both of us equally.And it was her ship.You couldnt have gotten a dog?God, I hated cats.Always sneaking around.No, sir, they dont adapt.Cant take free fall.Did you have to make any special adaptations?In the tank?Charlie asked.No sir.We had an extra couch.Great; that meant Id be sharing a tank with the animal.We only had to shorten the straps.It takes a different kind of drug for the cell wall strengthening, but that was included in the price.Charlie scratched it behind an ear.It purred softly but didnt move.Seems kind of stupid.The animal, I mean.We drugged him ahead of time.No wonder it was so inert; the drug slows your metabolism down to a rate barely adequate to sustain life.Makes it easier to strap him in.Guess its all right, I said.Maybe good for morale.But if it starts getting in the way, Ill personally recycle it.Yes, sir!he said, visibly relieved, thinking that I couldnt really do anything like that to such a cute bundle of fur.Try me, buddy.So we had seen it all.The only thing left, this side of the engines, was the huge hold where the fighters and drones waited, clamped in their massive cradles against the coming acceleration.Charlie and I went down to take a look, but there were no windows on our side of the airlock.I knew thered be one on the inside, but the chamber was evacuated, and it wasnt worth going through the fill and warm cycle merely to satisfy our curiosity.I was starting to feel really supernumerary.Called Hilleboe and she said everything was under control.With an hour to kill, we went back to the lounge and had the computer mediate a game of Kriegspieler, which was just starting to get interesting when the ten minute warning sounded.* * *   The acceleration tanks had a half life to failure of five weeks; there was a fifty fifty chance that you could stay immersed for five weeks before some valve or tube popped and you were squashed like a bug underfoot.In practice, it had to be one hell of an emergency to justify using the tanks for more than two weeks acceleration.We were only going under for ten days, this first leg of our journey.Five weeks or five hours, though, it was all the same as far as the tankee was concerned.Once the pressure got up to an operational level, you had no sense of the passage of time.Your body and brain were concrete.None of your senses provided any input, and you could amuse yourself for several hours just trying to spell your own name.So I wasnt really surprised that no time seemed to have passed when I was suddenly dry, my body tingling with the return of sensation.The place sounded like an asthmatics convention in the middle of a hay field: thirty nine people and one cat all coughing and sneezing to get rid of the last residues of fluorocarbon.While I was fumbling with my straps, the side door opened, flooding the tank with painfully bright light.The cat was the first one out, with a general scramble right behind him.For the sake of dignity, I waited until last.Over a hundred people were milling around outside, stretching and massaging out cramps.Dignity!Surrounded by acres of young female flesh, I stared into their faces and desperately tried to solve a third order differential equation in my head, to circumvent the gallant reflex.A temporary expedient, but it got me to the elevator.Hilleboe was shouting orders, getting people lined up, and as the doors closed I noticed that all of one platoon had a uniform light bruise, from head to foot.Twenty pairs of black eyes.Id have to see both Maintenance and Medical about that.After I got dressed.4  We stayed at one gee for three weeks, with occasional periods of free fall for navigation check, while the Masaryk II made a long, narrow loop away from the collapsar Resh 10, and back again.That period went all right, the people adjusting pretty well to ship routine.I gave them a minimum of busy work and a maximum of training review and exercise  for their own good, though I wasnt naive enough to think theyd see it that way.After about a week of one gee, Private Rudkoski (the cooks assistant) had a still, producing some eight liters a day of 95 percent ethyl alcohol.I didnt want to stop him, life was cheerless enough; I didnt mind as long as people showed up for duty sober  but I was damned curious both how he managed to divert the raw materials out of our sealed tight ecology, and how the people paid for their booze.So I used the chain of command in reverse, asking Alsever to find out.She asked Jarvil, who asked Carreras, who sat down with Orban, the cook.Turned out that Sergeant Orban had set the whole thing up, letting Rudkoski do the dirty work, and was aching to brag about it to a trustworthy person.If I had ever taken meals with the enlisted men and women, I might have figured out that something odd was going on.But the scheme didnt extend up to officers country.Through Rudkoski, Orban had jury rigged a ship wide economy based on alcohol.It went like this:  Each meal was prepared with one very sugary dessert jelly, custard or plain which you were free to eat if you could stand the cloying taste.But if it was still on your tray when you presented it at the recycling window, Rudkoski would give you a ten cent chit and scrape the sugary stuff into a fermentation vat.He had two twenty liter vats, one working while the other was being filled.The ten cent chit was at the bottom of a system that allowed you to buy a half liter of straight ethyl (with your choice of flavoring) for five dollars.A squad of five people who skipped all of their desserts could buy about a liter a week, enough for a party but not enough to constitute a public health problem.When Diana brought me this information, she also brought a bottle of Rudkoskis Worst  literally; it was a flavor that just hadnt worked.It came up through the chain of command with only a few centimeters missing.Its taste was a ghastly combination of strawberry and caraway seed.With a perversity not uncommon to people who rarely drink, Diana loved it.I had some ice water brought up, and she got totally blasted within an hour.For myself, I made one drink and didnt finish it.When she was more than halfway to oblivion, mumbling a reassuring soliloquy to her liver, she suddenly tilted her head up to stare at me with childlike directness.You have a real problem, Major William.Not half the problem youll have in the morning, Lieutenant Doctor Diana.Oh not really.She waved a drunken hand in front of her face.Some vitamins, some glu  cose, an eensy cc of adren  aline if all else fails.You  you  have  a real  problem.Look, Diana, dont you want me to  What you need  is to get an appointment with that nice Corporal Valdez.Valdez was the male sex counselor.He has empathy.Itsiz job.Hed make you  We talked about this before, remember?I want to stay the way I am.Dont we all.She wiped away a tear that was probably one percent alcohol.You know they call you the Old Creer.No they dont.She looked at the floor and then at the wall.The Ol Queer, thats what.I had expected names worse than that.But not so soon.I dont care.The commander always gets names.I know but.She stood up suddenly and wobbled a little bit.Too much t drink.Lie down.She turned her back to me and stretched so hard that a joint popped.Then a seam whispered open and she shrugged off her tunic, stepped out of it and tiptoed to my bed.She sat down and patted the mattress.Come on, William.Only chance.For Christs sake, Diana.It wouldnt be fair.Alls fair, she giggled.And sides, Im a doctor.I can be clinical; wont bother me a bit.Help me with this.After five hundred years, they were still putting brassiere clasps in the back.One kind of gentleman would have helped her get undressed and then made a quiet exit.Another kind of gentleman might have bolted for the door.Being neither kind, I closed in for the kill.Perhaps fortunately, she passed out before we had made any headway.I admired the sight and touch of her for a long time before, feeling like a cad, I managed to gather everything up and dress her.I lifted her out of the bed, sweet burden, and then realized that if anyone saw me carrying her down to her billet, shed be the butt of rumors for the rest of the campaign.I called up Charlie, told him wed had some booze and Diana was rather the worse for it, and asked him whether hed come up for a drink and help me haul the good doctor home.By the time Charlie knocked, she was draped innocently in a chair, snoring softly.He smiled at her.Physician, heal thyself.I offered him the bottle, with a warning.He sniffed it and made a face.What is this, varnish?Just something the cooks whipped up.Vacuum still.He set it down carefully, as if it might explode if jarred.I predict a coming shortage of customers.Epidemic of death by poisoning  she actually drank that vile stuff?Well, the cooks admitted it was an experiment that didnt pan out; their other flavors are evidently potable.Yeah, she loved it.Well He laughed.Damn!What, you take her legs and I take her arms?No, look, we each take an arm.Maybe we can get her to do part of the walking.She moaned a little when we lifted her out of the chair, opened one eye and said, Hello, Charlee.Then she closed the eye and let us drag her down to the billet.No one saw us on the way, but her bunkmate, Laasonen, was sitting up reading.She really drank the stuff, eh?She regarded her friend with wry affection.Here, let me help.The three of us wrestled her into bed.Laasonen smoothed the hair out of her eyes.She said it was in the nature of an experiment.More devotion to science than I have, Charlie said.A stronger stomach, too.We all wished he hadnt said that.Diana sheepishly admitted that she hadnt remembered anything after the first drink, and talking to her, I deduced that she thought Charlie had been there all along.Which was all for the best, of course.But oh!Diana, my lovely latent heterosexual, let me buy you a bottle of good scotch the next time we come into port.Seven hundred years from now.We got back into the tanks for the hop from Resh 10 to Kaph 35.That was two weeks at twenty five gees; then we had another four weeks of routine at one gravity.I had announced my open door policy, but practically no one ever took advantage of it.I saw very little of the troops and those occasions were almost always negative: testing them on their training review, handing out reprimands, and occasionally lecturing classes.And they rarely spoke intelligibly, except in response to a direct question.Most of them either had English as their native tongue or as a second language, but it had changed so drastically over 450 years that I could barely understand it, not at all if it was spoken rapidly.Fortunately, they had all been taught early twenty first century English during their basic training; that language, or dialect, served as a temporal lingua franca through which a twenty fifth century soldier could communicate with someone who had been a contemporary of his nineteen times great grandparents.If there had still been such a thing as grandparents.I thought of my first combat commander, Captain Stott  whom I had hated just as cordially as the rest of the company did  and tried to imagine how I would have felt if he had been a sexual deviate and Id been forced to learn a new language for his convenience.So we had discipline problems, sure.But the wonder was that we had any discipline at all.Hilleboe was responsible for that; as little as I liked her personally, I had to give her credit for keeping the troops in line.
