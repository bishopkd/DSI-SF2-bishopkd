Numbers fluctuate.Rarely dangerous, sometimes hunted, no bounty.So there.Ysul looked surprised.Really?he asked,  Oh, stop being so coy!their host chided, creating sinuous splashing patterns in the water, as though tickled.Of course!As though you didnt know.The Aumapile of Aumapile blew jets of water from each end.A scent of something vaguely rotten filled Fassins nose.But I know where our friend was going to next, and you dont.However, I shall be willing to tell you if you take me along, once I am aboard your ship.Such large places, gas giants!And of course we have four.One thinks, Oh, who can say, where would ones quarry be?The Sceuri flicked its tail.Fassin got splashed.And what do you say, sirs?Ysul looked at Fassin and quietly rippled his mantle, the Dweller equivalent of a head shake.The travelcaptain was silent for a moment or two, then said,  If we do take you with us  Ah!But I have my own ship!Indeed, you are in it!Wont work.Have to come with us in ours.I have smaller ships!Many of them!A choice!Makes no difference.Has to be ours.Conditions of Passage.Well the Sceuri said.Passengers travel unconditionally.Unconditionally.What does that mean?Trust us.Yes.No matter what.Means you get zapped unconscious every time we travel, is what it means, Ysul told their host.Quercer Janath made a hissing noise.Plus, Ysul added, oblivious, you may not end up where you thought you were going to.How primitive!Why, of course!* * *  Eleven hundred ships.They were facing eleven hundred ships.All of them had to be beyond a certain size, capable of crossing the great gulf of space between the E 5 Discon and here in reasonable time, and they would probably all be armed.Ulubis could muster less than three hundred true space capable war craft, even after their frenzy of building.The Summed Fleet on its way to their rescue was of similar size, but its ships would be of another order of magnitude in hitting power: a full mix of destroyers, light, medium and heavy cruisers, plus the real big guys, the battlecruisers and battleships.Ulubis had frigates, destroyers and light cruisers, and one old battlecruiser, the Carronade.Theyd built a significant fleet in the centuries following the destruction of the portal, and a few more ships in the half year since the news of the coming invasion, but nothing like enough to offer the invaders serious opposition.Theyd lost about a sixth of their total fighting force in the few minutes of action in the storm on Nasqueron, months earlier, including their only other battlecruiser.Those had mostly been light units, but it had been a grievous loss.The latest bit of bad news was that the consortium working on the rail gun had fallen so far behind schedule that it was highly doubtful theyd even get to the trials stage before the invasion took place.The giant gun was being dismantled so it wouldnt fall into the hands of the Starveling Cultists.There was something almost sublimely elegant, Sal thought, about how perfect a waste of time, people, resources and hard work the whole project had been.Kehar Heavy Industries and the other manufacturers had worked as hard as they could to construct, repair, upgrade and modify as many warships as they could, and had militarised dozens of civilian craft.But there was only so much they could do and it was never going to be enough.They were outnumbered.They could go down fighting, but they were going down.It couldnt be any worse!Guard General Thovin spluttered, practically spraying his drink.They were on a requisitioned ex cruise liner, one of the Embassy support ships, rolling in orbit around Nasqueron.Saluus and the Propylaea sub master Sorofieve had been sent by the rest of the War Cabinet to add, if it were possible, an extra note of urgency to the talks with the Dwellers.Thovin, seconded from his Guard duties to be Commander in Chief, Ulubis Orbital Forces, was there in charge of the very lightly armed escort detachment because he was out of the way and couldnt do too much harm.The grandeur of his new title seemed to almost entirely make up for the lack of viable military hardware at his disposal.We cant even surrender to the Starvelings because if we do the Summed Fleet will clobber us when they arrive, he said.Were going to get fucked over twice!He threw back his drink.Saluus didnt like Thovin  he was one of those people who got to the top of an organisation through luck, connections, the indulgence of superiors and that sort of carelessness towards others that the easily impressed termed ruthlessness and those of a less gullible nature called sociopathy.But sometimes, just through his sheer unthinking brusqueness and inability to think through the consequences of a remark, he said what everybody else was only thinking.A comic poet working in obscene doggerel.There is no need to talk of surrender, sub master Sorofieve said quickly, and, to Sals amusement, actually looked round, glancing left and right to make sure nobody else had heard the S word in the old cruise ships lounge, which was deserted apart from a few bar staff, the three men and a half dozen or so of their closest staff.(Liss was there, looking darkly beautiful, mostly silent, occasionally talking quietly with one or other of the other assistants, secretaries and ADCs.When the Propylaea sub master did his glancing around act, her gaze met Sals; she smiled and flexed her eyebrows. )If there were any spies here, Sal thought, they werent lurking behind the furniture in the shadows, they were sitting right here, around them.The indispensable aides and helpers they all relied on to run their so important lives were the obvious candidates for the post of spy.If anything ever got back to the Hierchon  or any other more lowly but still important branch of the Ulubine Mercatoria  regarding talk of surrender or anything else deemed Unspeakable it would probably be one of these people theyd have to thank.Saluus knew one could never be one hundred per cent certain, but he was pretty sure that the lovely Liss wasnt working for anybody else.Hed seemingly let slip a couple of things early on in their relationship which hed have expected to come back to him if shed been in the pay of somebody else.It had been a sort of recommendation that shed come via Fassin and hed obviously known her from decades earlier.That was far too long a game just to get to an industrialist, even Saluus Kehar.No need?Thovin said, turning to his secretary, holding up his glass and winking theatrically.Its what wed be talking about if the Summed Fleet wasnt on its way.Be the rational thing to do.He snorted.Im not saying we should surrender.Been ordered not to, been ordered to fight to the last, but if the Fleet wasnt coming and we werent looking for this this thing, supposedly somewhere on Nasq.(The fabled Transform, of course, Saluus thought.The mythical magic bullet which Fassin, if he was still alive, might be chasing yet. )What else would we be doing but thinking how to not all get ourselves killed?We are prepared, we are forewarned, sub master Sorofieve said, smiling desperately.We shall give a good account of ourselves, I am sure.We are fighting for our homes, for our honour, for   the man looked round again   for our very humanity!Ah, Sal realised, Sorofieve had been checking there were no aliens present whom he might be offending.We have millennia of Mercatorial, ah, wisdom and martial ability behind us.What are these Starveling renegades in comparison?Eleven hundred ships, thats what they were, Saluus thought.Eleven hundred to our three hundred, and a balance of forces the strategists say is way up the force yield spectrum compared to ours, too: medium heavy to our light.Plus one mega ship, to our one antique battlecruiser.They had had another meeting with some of the Dweller representatives just that afternoon.They went down these days in person, reclined in human form spacesuits held in small circular gascraft of two or three seats, congregating in a great hall in one of a whole fleet of giant Dreadnought sized craft the Dwellers had dedicated to the purpose.With the gascraft canopies hinged open it was possible to sit\lie there in some comfort and talk directly to the Dwellers, face to hub or whatever it was.Saluus wouldnt want to spend more than a day like that in multiple gees, but it was worth doing.The Dwellers seemed to appreciate it and  thanks to some cram coaching by the senior Seers who also came down with them to the meetings and stayed with them for all but the most delicate and high security clearance matters  Saluus was even starting to get the hang of Dweller expressions and nuances of meaning and demeanour, both as put across in speech and as displayed on their signal skin.Probably all too late, and  so far  to no avail whatsoever.But at least it felt like he was doing something  the shipyards of KHI were basically on autopilot, working flat out and so synched in to what the military wanted that theyd effectively become part of a command economy.Hed just been getting in the way.This is a threat to the whole of Ulubis system, Sorofieve said.Sal suppressed a sigh.This was only Sorofieves third day in this latest round  hed replaced First Secretary Heuypzlagger, whod found the high gravity too wearing  and he was talking to a Dweller called Yawiyuen who was also new to the process, but even so.Theyd been circling over this same ground for weeks now.These Starveling Cult people will show no respect for Nasquerons neutrality, the sub master concluded.How do you know?Gruonoshe, another of the Dwellers, asked.They were nine in all: the two human negotiators and a couple of assistants each  Liss was there in a seat behind Sal, having declared herself quite happy in the high gravity  Chief Seer Meretiy of Sept Krine, and just the two Dwellers, both in ceremonial half clothes, ribboned and jewelled.Know what?Sorofieve asked.Know that these Starveling Cult people will show no respect for Nasquerons neutrality, Gruonoshe said, innocently.Well, Sorofieve said, they are invaders, warmongers.Indeed, not to put too fine a point on it, they are barbarians.They respect nothing.Still, it does not follow that theyd quarrel with us, Yawiyuen said, signal skin showing reasonableness.They want to take over the whole system, Sorofieve said, looking to Saluus for help.To them that would include Nasqueron.We have heard of the Starveling Cult, Yawiyuen told them.(  Wonder from where?Liss sent to Saluus via his ear stud. )It appears to be an unremarkable Quick hegemonist diffusion, concerned with conquering its own kind and species type suitable environments, uninterested in attacking gas giants.The point here, Saluus said smoothly, his amplified voice sounding rich and powerful, is that they are only attacking Ulubis system to get to Nasqueron.Why?Gruonoshe asked.Were not entirely sure, Saluus said.We are sure they want something from Nasqueron, something they cant get from any other gas giant, but exactly what that may be, we cant say.But we are quite positive that that is why they are mounting this attack in the first place.Why are you sure?Gruonoshe again.We intercepted intelligence to that effect, Sorofieve replied.What intelligence?Yawiyuen asked.The intelligence, Sorofieve said, came from the personal diary of the Supreme Commander of the Starveling Cult invasion fleet sent to the Ruanthril system nearly eighteen years ago.The fleet was intercepted by a Mercatorial force.The captured records show that the enemy commander complained specifically about the need to divert so many of the E 5 Discons forces to somewhere as out of the way and strategically unimportant as Ulubis, just for some item or piece of information in Nasqueron.Nasqueron was mentioned by name?Gruonoshe asked.It was, Sal said.He half expected a little voice in his ear to say something like Good lie but then remembered that even Liss hadnt been told the full truth about the Dweller List and the mythical Transform.She would have an idea, as a lot of people close to the epicentres of power did, that Fassin had been sent on a secret mission to look for something valuable in Nasqueron, and that the object of this search might have some bearing on the war, but that was about all.She hadnt been present at the briefing by the AI projection of Admiral Quile, hadnt been let in on the secret subsequently by some of those who had been there  as Sal had  and so didnt know the details of the intelligence theyd been given.Well then, Yawiyuen said reasonably, you should let the Starveling Cult attack us and we will deal with them.This, of course, was exactly what the Emergency War Cabinet hoped would happen.Can we just say yes here?Liss sent.Wouldnt you then want some help from us?Sorofieve asked.Oh, no!Gruonoshe exclaimed, as though the idea was just too preposterous even to think about.As sub master Sorofieve has said, Saluus said, we are quite certain that the Starveling Cultists intend to take the entirety of Ulubis system, including Nasqueron.Were all under threat.Thats why it would make sense for you and us to organise our defence together.A common threat requires a common response, Sorofieve told the Dwellers.Or maybe a pincer movement, Yawiyuen suggested brightly.Saluus wanted to sigh again.These two guys were supposedly top grade negotiators with the authority to speak provisionally  in advance of some sort of still undefined plebiscite procedure  for the entire Dweller society on Nasqueron, but they frequently sounded like children.Well, perhaps, he said.Providing we can, at the very least, coordinate our actions.And of course, Sorofieve said, it may be that we can share defence technologies.Oh!Yawiyuen said, rising above his dent seat a fraction.Good idea!What do you have that we might want?He appeared guilelessly enthusiastic.Our strengths would lie more in intelligence, in knowing how these Starveling Cultists will think, Saluus said.Theyre basically humans, too.For all our differences, we think pretty much the same way they do.Our contribution would be to try to anticipate them, to out think them.And ours?Yawiyuen asked, settling back down in his seat again.Weaponry, I bet, Gruonoshe said, sounding unimpressed.As we have discovered, very much to our cost, Saluus said, you have the better of us in offensive capability, certainly  Defensive capability, Gruonoshe interrupted.Surely?Sal did his best to move his helmeted head in an acknowledging nod, straining his neck muscles in the high gravity.Defensive capability, as you say, he said.If we were able to share some of your knowledge of  Weapons technology is not something we are going to share, Gruonoshe said crisply.We could say we wanted to, Yawiyuen told them.We could even mean it  you might argue us round, somehow, to said point of view  but those who control the weapons themselves would not permit it.Well, can we perhaps talk to them?Saluus asked.Yawiyuen bobbed over his seat.No.Why would that be?Sorofieve asked.They dont talk to aliens, Yawiyuen told them bluntly.They barely talk to us, Gruonoshe admitted.How might we be able to?Saluus began.We are not the Mercatoria, Gruonoshe said, interrupting Saluus again.This was not an experience he was used to.He could see how it might get annoying.We are not the Mercatoria, the Dweller repeated.He sounded indignant.We are not one of your states or mercenary  or irrationality inspired groupings or forces.Bit of stress there, Sal heard in his ear.If I may, Chief Seer Meretiy began.The Seers were under instruction only to take a part in the talks when they felt there was some sort of basic misunderstanding taking place.Meretiy obviously felt that was happening now, but he didnt get a chance to take his point further.What is meant, one believes, Yawiyuen said, is that things do not work with us the way that they work with you.We are delegated to speak to you, and what we take from here will be shared with all who wish to take notice.We are not in a position to order other Dwellers to do or not do certain things.No Dweller is, not in the hierarchical sense that you may be used to.We can share information.The information regarding the approach of the Starveling Cultists has been made available to whoever it may concern, as was the information regarding the build up of Mercatorial forces immediately prior to the unfortunate incident which took place within C 2 Storm Ultra Violet 3667.Those in charge of the relevant defensive systems will doubtless have taken note of said information.That is really all we can share with you.Our colleagues in charge of the defensive systems would not consider talking to outsiders and there is no precedent for sharing, lending, leasing or giving such technologies to others.You talk of your colleagues in charge of the defensive systems, Sorofieve said.But who is in charge of them?And so to the point.Yawiyuen gave a little bob shrug.Nobody is.Somebody has to be, Sorofieve insisted.Why?Well, Sorofieve said, how do they know what to do?Lots of training, Yawiyuen told him.But when?When do they know what to do?Who directs them, who decides when its time to stop talking and start shooting?They do.They do?Sorofieve sounded incredulous.You let your military decide when to go to war?Our sub master hasnt done his homework, has he?Sal sent to Liss.He may have read, she replied.He didnt believe.Saluus had done as much research as he could into the Dwellers.Amazing how little hed known.He was smart, well educated and extremely well connected and yet hed been near shamed by how little hed known about the creatures that his own species shared the system with.It was as though, having realised how little the Dwellers were concerned with or cared about them, Ulubine humanity had decided to pay them back in the same coin.And this in a Seer system, with more inter species contact than any save another half dozen or so similarly favoured, scattered through the galaxy.Yet even here most people didnt know or want to know much of anything about the Dwellers.There was a large minority who did, but they were seen as slightly embarrassing  nerdy alien fans.Facing the threat they were, desperately needing the Dwellers help, how short sighted they all seemed now.And reading up on Dweller society proved the truth of one old cliche for sure: the more you learned, the more you realised how little you knew.(An image of the planet, Liss had suggested when hed first tried to articulate this feeling; unending depths. )Of course our military decide when we go to war, Gruonoshe said, calm again.Theyre the experts.I think that, if I might be allowed to butt in, Chief Seer Meretiy said from his gascraft, the point at issue is our different ways of looking at our two societies military capacity.We  that is, humans, and perhaps one might even presume to speak in this for the whole Mercatoria  regard our military as a tool, to be used by our politicians, who of course rule in the name of all.Conversely, our Dweller friends regard their military as an ancient and venerable calling for those with the relevant vocation, an institution to be honoured for its antiquity which has, almost as an afterthought, the duty of defending Dweller planets from any outside threat.As such, they are like what one might term a fire brigade, and a volunteer fire brigade, at that, for which no political clearance or oversight is required for it to spring into action, you see?Their raison detre is to respond as quickly as possible to emergencies, no more.Fuck me, that actually made a sort of sense, Liss sent.Just those first two words, delivered in her voice, with her so close behind him, gave Sal the start of an erection.He wondered how strong gravity had to be for hard ons to become impossible.Fire brigades have leaders, captains, dont they?Sorofieve said plaintively, looking from Meretiy to Saluus.We might talk to them.Mightnt we?Yawiyuen did the little bob shrug again.Absolutely not.But we need to!Sorofieve almost wailed.Why?That thing even looks fast, Guard General Thovin said, gazing out at the sleek, dark ship from one of the requisitioned liners viewing galleries.The stars swung around them.It have a name?Hull 8770, Saluus told him.The military will give it a proper name when its time to hand it over.Though its a prototype, probably not suitable for full military service.Desperate times, Thovin said, shrugging, picking something from between his teeth.Probably get used for something.Even if its just a missile.Thats what you think, Sal thought.We havent quite got to that stage yet, he said.They were alone.Thovin had suggested a stroll through the mostly empty ex civilian ship.Think were wasting our time here, Kehar?Thovin swung round to look at Saluus, his near neckless head raised and tilted to him.Talking to the Dwellers?Yes.Talking to the fucking Dwellers.Probably.But then our friend Fassin Taak is probably wasting his time  if hes still alive  looking for this Transform that probably doesnt exist.He was your friend, wasnt he?the Guard General said, eyes narrowing.Old school pals.Right, isnt it?Yes, we went to school and college together.Weve kept in touch over the years.Matter of fact, probably the last bit of R and R he got before delving into Nasq.was at my house on Murla.Straight to Guard academy for me, Thovin said, changing tack again and looking away at the dartlike ship floating in space just outside.That your escape route, is it, Kehar?he asked innocently.Not quite as stupid as you look, are you?Sal thought.Where to?he asked, smiling.The fuck out of harms way, thats where, Thovin said.Keep your head down during the Starveling occupation.Return when its safe.You know, I hadnt thought of that, Sal said.Why, are you going to make me an offer for it?Wouldnt know how to fly it.Course, you do, that right?It was no secret that Saluus had flown the Hull 8770 here himself.He was a capable enough pilot.Anybody could be with a little training and a modicum of computer help.Frees one of our brave boys for the front line, he told Thovin, deadpan.Be funny if we won against the invaders, or the Summed Fleet lost.Eh?Hilarious.Think well get anything out of the floats?I think our Dweller pals have probably given us all were ever going to get, but its still worthwhile keeping on looking.Uh huh?You think?Maybe the crew of one of their hyper weapons will suddenly decide itd be fun to defend Sepekte just for the sheer hell of it, or one of the scouts down in Nasq.will find the Transform, or Fassin Taak will just appear with it and we can all escape down a wormhole or bring in Summed Fleet ships from wherever we want.Who knows?So were not wasting our time here?No, probably we are.But what else could we be doing?Filling sandbags?Thovin almost smiled.Course, if they did suddenly turn up with some fancy super weapon ship, maybe we wouldnt need to build warships any more, eh?Im sure Kehar Heavy Industries could happily switch to building nothing but cruise ships.Sal looked round the viewing gallery they stood in.I can see a few areas fit for improvement just standing here.Thovin nodded out at the slim, dark ship cradled outside.You would hand that over to the Hierchon for his personal yacht if he asked for it, wouldnt you?Sal thought for a moment.Id almost sooner destroy it, he said.Thovin turned and looked at him, expression open, waiting.Im not kidding.It really is a prototype, Sal said, smiling.You wouldnt put the head of state of an entire system in something as untried as that, certainly not if you meant to take it up to anything near top speed, which would kind of have to be the only reason for choosing it in the first place, right?Ill entrust myself to the thing, but I couldnt let the Hierchon take it.What if it killed him?Think of the publicity.Good grief, man, think of our share price.Thovin nodded for a few moments, looking back at the ship.Missile, then, he said.Me too, Liss said quietly in the darkness.I thought he was just an idiot kicked upstairs.I think he does a good idiot act, Sal said.Actually, I think hes probably as genuinely stupid as our Dweller negotiators are genuinely naive.Maybe Thovin should take over the talks.Doubt he could do any worse.They were lying in bed on board the prototype ship.It was more secure than staying on the liner or one of the other Embassy support ships, if also far less luxurious and much more cramped.There was no absolute guarantee that somebody hadnt sneaked a bug aboard during the ships construction, but Saluus had had the craft built by his most trustworthy people and supervised the work as closely as he could; it was as safe as anyplace to say things that you might not want others to hear.Do you think he was trying to make a deal, get himself included if you did decide to escape?Saluus hesitated.This was not something hed ever discussed straight out even with Liss.He was quite sure shed guessed that using the ship as a way out was a possibility  so, for that matter, had Thovin, apparently, which kind of made you wonder who else might regard it as obvious (there was a slightly sweat inducing idea)  but there was nothing to gain for either of them in saying it out loud.No, Sal said, deciding against bringing that particular truth blinking into the light.You know, I actually thought that maybe Thovins a kind of spy himself.Really?I wouldnt be at all surprised if he reports to the Hierchon direct, or at least to the big guys top intelligence people.I think all this rough as bricks bluff stuff is just a way of getting people to drop their guard with him.Fucker could be a traitor sniffer.Liss fitted her long body against his, rubbing slowly, gently.He didnt sniff you, then?How could he?Sal said.For I am straight and true.Ah, yes.Sometimes, if she was still holding him when she was falling asleep, he would feel her fingers making strange patterns on his side or back, as though her hands were trying to spell out some secret code of love.Then she would be asleep and stop, or jerk awake, as though embarrassed, and roll away and curl up.* * *  Groggy again.Aboard the Velpin.Still.No idea yet how long they had taken.The truetwin had just told the three of them that it would take some days to get to where they were going.Then, to Fassin and Ysul when the Sceuri couldnt see, they had signal whispered, That thing about Just Trust Us applies to you two, too.But shh, right?Ysul and Fassin had exchanged looks.Some days.The travel time was near instant, of course, portal to portal.It was the getting to and from the portals at either end that took days.That and, perhaps, some sleight of course manoeuvres to fool anybody watching or following and trying to spot the hidden portals that way.Who knew?Quercer Janath did, of course, but they werent telling, wouldnt even contemplate any arguments about letting him or even just Ysul stay awake during these bizarre, so casually taken galaxy spanning transfers.Watching, following.How could you have all those ship movements and never be seen?Telescopes of every wavelength, gravity sensors, neutrino patternisers, something somewhere in practically every developed system that kept a devastatingly detailed close eye on every sort of signal that ever emanated from space close, near, mid or far: something had to show up.Or did they only have portals in undeveloped systems, so that they had less chance of being observed?No, they had them in Ulubis and Ashum.Watching, following.Followed by something small enough to be even less visible, perhaps?Somebody, something must have followed a Dweller ship in system, somewhere, and suddenly found itself plunging into a secret wormhole And yet, apparently, nobody and nothing ever had.So casual, so lackadaisical, so la la la; could it all be a perfect, never failing act?Could the Dwellers all really be geniuses at acting, brilliant at stealth, flawless exponents of the disciplines required to keep complete discipline for every single solitary journey transfer jump whatever?Dear reason and fate, theyd had ten billion years to get perfect at anything they wanted.Who knew what skills theyd developed to perfection in that time?(Yet there was still chaos, extreme chance, the simple stacking up of odds that something had to go wrong sometime, no matter how close to perfection you could get)  Coming round, slowly.Rovruetz, Direaliete.Shit, more names to deal with, more places to take in, another damn step along the way.He would die forever following this elusive fuck of a Dweller, or accumulate such dislocation, accrue so much summed grogginess that hed forget what the whole insane quest was for, and find Leisicrofe one day, finally, when it was all too late anyway, and just stare at the fellow, utterly unable to recall what it was he wanted to ask him or what it might be that the Dweller could possibly have that would be remotely interesting or important to him.The passenger compartment of the Velpin was mostly taken up by the esuit of the Sceuri called the Aumapile of Aumapile: a huge white stippled black lozenge like a strange distorting viewport into space.Fassin, waking slowly, feeling grubby and sore as usual, couldnt even see Ysul or the anyway useless screen on the far wall.Urgh!the giant black esuit exclaimed.So that is unconsciousness?How disagreeable.And I strongly suspect inherently so.Fassin was glad that somebody agreed.He started checking out the arrowheads systems as he warmed them up again.The left manipulator arm was proving sticky, the self repair mechanisms reaching the limits of their abilities.On past form it would sort of half work, jerkily, for a few real time months and then jam completely.He supposed he was lucky hed got this far without any equipment failure, especially given the punishment the little gascraft had taken since the flight from Third Fury.And yet interesting!the Sceuri announced, voice booming round the near full space.The Aumapile of Aumapile was even louder than Ysul.Hmm, it said.Yes, interesting, more than certainly.Are you two awake yet or am I first up?Ha ha!Either awake or having a very noisy nightmare, Ysul said testily and unseen from the creatures other side.Ditto, said Fassin.Super!So, are we there yet?They were.And they werent.When the fuzzy screen cleared, it showed they were in the middle layers of a gas giant atmosphere.The Velpin had done some high speed spinning after all, and the zapping unconscious had been more rough and ready than before.They had taken two days to get where they were going.This, their travelcaptain assured them, was Rovruetz, Direaliete, a weather district and gas region of Nhouaste, the systems own gas giant.The Aumapile of Aumapile was delighted.Just as it had thought!It fairly bounced out of the Velpins gaslock into the vast, shaded scape of towering RootClouds and horizon spanning RayCanopies.It twirled like a centrifuge from sheer happiness.They spent another day, perfectly undisturbed by any native Dwellers, investigating the supposedly Toiler remains, which actually looked remarkably like an abandoned Dweller globe city sitting on top of a damaged and discarded mega klick BandTurbine.All very impressive, but not, Fassin and Ysul both realised, what or where they were really looking for.This is not Rovruetz, Direaliete, is it?Fassin asked the truetwin shortly after they arrived, while the Aumapile of Aumapile dashed to and fro throughout the ruins, calibrating instruments and grabbing screenage.Are you mad?Of course not.Direalietes on the far side of the galaxy.Take days to get there.A system?Fassin asked.A system.Ive no record of it, Fassin told the truetwin.You wouldnt.Direaliete is its name in the Old Language.Well, variant thereof.So, Fassin sent,  this is just a trick.Correct.Our friend has what it wanted, we have what we wanted.Two out of two.One of our more successful missions.Meanwhile, Fassin sent,  were wasting time.Time wastes itself.Who are we to float in its way?After offering to leave the breathless Sceuri scholar behind and come back for it  it wasnt quite that easily fooled  and then telling it they really needed to be getting back now  it declared there was too much it still had to look for  Quercer Janath just abandoned the Sceuri, waiting until it had whirred off into the centre of the abandoned city before telling Fassin that the Aumapile of Aumapile had finally seen sense and was coming aboard in a moment for the trip back, getting the human and Ysul secured, and then closing the external doors and taking off, warning their passengers there was some fairly intense spiralling ahead.What the fuck?Fassin signalled to Ysul before the gascrafts systems were shut down.What about the Sceuri?The Dweller had been in on it.A good joke, eh?he sent back, laughing.Fassin signalled at the wall screen, getting through to Quercer Janath in the command space.Did you warn the Aumapile you were about to leave?Yes.Fassin waited.No more came.After a few moments he sent,  And?Didnt believe us.Laughed.So youre just abandoning this fabulously wealthy, appar ently politically well connected, Dweller naive idiot in a gas giant in its home system?About sums it up.Cant say we didnt warn him.It.Conditions of Passage.Dont you think it might get hunted or just die anyway?Fassin asked.Or get back home, eventually, deeply annoyed?Suppose its a possibility.Keep going?Get back home, eventually, deeply annoyed with all Dwellers?And that that might be a bad thing for the Dwellers who live in Nhouaste?Point.Could cause friction.Kudos loss!Maybe we should have warned somebody we were leaving the flop backed suck puncture behind.Thinking.Suggestion.Know!Well send a signal.Happy?Fassin didnt even get time to reply.No more talk time.Switch off now, start spiralling.* * *  The Archimandrite Luseferous reviewed his forces.The nearest parts were right here, within the curved, concentric hulls of the Main Battle Craft Luseferous VII: they were his space and ground crack troops, all stood at attention by their sleek all environments attack craft and high skill spec weaponry.The warships, support craft, troop carriers, landers, bombardment monitors, harrier drones, missile carriers, scout and surveillance machines and other vessels plus miscellaneous heavy devices he could discern  stretching as far as the unaided eye could see into the distance  were just projections.But they were live, real time, and mostly clustered within a few light seconds of the invasion fleets core, whose absolute, steely heart was the Main Battle Craft Luseferous VII.This was, in a way, the Archimandrites favourite bit.He had made a tradition of reviewing his forces like this before every major engagement, and especially before every system invasion, simply because it was such an astoundingly rewarding experience.Even the feeling of victory achieved  of having crushed and overcome, of having utterly prevailed  was hardly any better than this, when all the forces that would soon be thrown into the unavoidable mess and untidiness of battle  getting killed and shot up and dirty and lost and damaged and so on  stood or sat or lay or hovered or flew in perfect formation before him, gleaming, serried, grouped, exactly aligned, neatly laid out, symmetrically and systematically arranged, all just glistening with power and threat and promise.He stood on the reviewing balcony at one end of the vast curved series of halls that formed the layered outer hulls of the giant ship, and took a series of deep breaths, eyes wide, heart pounding.God or Truth, it was a beautiful sight.This was, in a way, genuinely better than sex.They were coasting in now, most of the deceleration completed, just one final burst of a few days weight and discomfort to come.Another week and they would be in the system, finally attacking.They had encountered little opposition so far, partly due to the high, angled course theyd taken.Any mine clouds and drone flocks that might have been set out to trap them would have been thrown across the more direct approaches, and by taking this longer but safer line theyd avoided them all so far.The only danger had lain in their mid course correction, subjective years earlier, when their drives might have shown up on any deep space monitoring systems in Ulubis, had they been turned in the right direction.The risk had been slight and as far as they could tell theyd got away with it.At any rate, no fleet had emerged from Ulubis to do battle; they had decided to wait and fight on their own doorsteps.His tacticians thought this indicated that Ulubis was prepared but weak.They might encounter some probe and destroyer level .craft, but that would probably be all until they hit the mid  and inner system.His admirals were confident their laser ships and close defence units could deal with anything else that might have been sent out to get in their way.Luseferous became aware of noises at his back, where some of his more senior commanders were permitted to stand, backed in turn by his personal Guards.There were whispers, and hushing noises of fear and exasperation.He felt his body stiffen.Now would not be a good time to bother him with anything other than the imminent destruction of the whole fleet.They had to know that.The people behind him quieted down.He relaxed, stood more upright in the spin produced three quarter gravity, and breathed deeply again, gazing out at the assembled men and materiel.Oh, this was a sweet and beautiful sight indeed, this was the very image of invincibility, an utterly thrilling spectacle of power made solid and real and uncompromising.This was his, this was him.The imminent destruction of the whole fleet He imagined that happening, imagined it happening right now; some cataclysmic hyper weapon of the ancients wiping out the entire invasion force without anyone being able to do anything to stop them.Nonsense  well, vanishingly unlikely, anyway  but just think of it!Hed be able to watch everything here just blink out of existence, one by one, or explode in flames or bright blasts of light.Hed be able to watch it all being destroyed around him!The idea made him shiver, half in horror, half in delight.It was never going to happen, of course, but the image alone was terrifyingly exciting.And a sort of warning, of course.Not from any god or from some program running the universe as the Truth saw it, but from something more trustworthy and direct; from inside himself.His subconscious, or some monitoring part personality playing the part of the fool who always stood at Caesars side in a Triumph, reminding him that all was vanity.That sort of thing.The thoughts of destruction were just him reminding himself to take nothing for granted, to concentrate and take full control, to prosecute the coming war with his usual ruthlessness and ignore any internal whining voices preaching moderation or unwarranted mercy.Be cruel and merciful always for a purpose, never just to satisfy some self image.Somebody had said that.He would never forget it.One last deep breath.So, prepared.And forearmed.Still, the mood had sort of been broken.No real damage done by the hint of interruption earlier.He would be justified, all the same, in being angry, if he needed to be.Better see what all the fuss had been about.He swivelled on his heels, pulled himself up to his full height  always have senior commanders you could look down on  and said, loudly, Yes?He loved to see these proud, vainglorious men flinch, these men used to being obeyed instantly and without question cower, even fractionally, before him.Tuhluer, perhaps his least annoying aide de camp and lately something of a favourite, came forward, smiling and frowning at the same time.Sir, sorry about the disturbance a moment earlier.He gave a tiny flex of the eyebrows, as if to say, Not my fault  you know what some of these guys are like.Ops alert just in: high speed craft coming direct from Ulubis, signalling unarmed, no warhead, one or two human occupants, wanting to talk.Already slowing to match with us in ten hours.On its current course that will leave it a hundred klicks off fleet centre, left level.The Archimandrite glared over Tuhluers head at the others.And this required my intervention?Warhead worries, sir, Tuhluer said smoothly, with a small smile.The craft was passing the leading units of the fleets forward destroyer screen at the time and was about to go out of their effective beam weapon range.Question was whether to shoot or not.Now moot.The ship will be in range of the second defensive layer in half an hour.Or there are missiles, of course.A drone missile carrier has already been launched in pursuit.The Archimandrite Luseferous paused a moment, then smiled.He could see them all relax.Well then, he said.Everything appears to be functioning as it should and I did not need to be disturbed, did I?Indeed not, sir, his aide de camp agreed ruefully.And what is the alleged status of this human or humans, if indeed that is what the thing contains?The claim is that theres a man aboard, a high ranking industrialist called Saluus Kehar.* * *  The grogginess again, the tired, gritty, grubby feeling.Fassin was sure he was coming round more and more slowly each time, and finding himself duller, slower and more confused with each new reawakening.Over forty days travel on this transition, to the other side of the galaxy, fully ninety kiloyears from Ulubis, not that such measurements meant much.The in wormhole time would still have been trivial.The extra days and weeks had been taken up by the flight from the portal to the ship they were looking for, deep in interstellar space.Some days.A distance.All just more time gone, more distance between him and whatever he was trying to accomplish, while events back at Ulubis moved on without him.He tested the arrowheads faulty left manipulator arm, flexing and tensing it, then forced himself to look at the screen on the far wall.Stars swung, as ever, then became just the backdrop to a vast dark gnarled craft, a giant torus shaped ship two hundred kilometres in diameter, all black gleaming ribs and fractured facets, glinting in the weak light of a far distant sun like a great rough crown of wet coal: the Cineropoline Sepulcraft Rovruetz, a vessel of the Ythyns vastly dispersed Greater Expiratory Fleet, a Death Carrier.Ysul studied the image on the screen from the far side of the chamber for a moment, then shook his mantles.We must mix amongst Morbs, he said, sounding sleepy, grumpy and resigned all at once.Oh, great.So what happened to the Toilers?Fassin asked.I thought Leisicrofe was supposed to be investigating Toilers next.Obviously they toiled in vain, Ysul sent.A mis lead.A bluff.The Velpin hung above a graveyard of ships scattered across the outer rim of the Death Carrier while Ysul and Fassin crossed to the giant ship.The Ythyn had suggested that the Velpin might enter the Rovruetz.Quercer Janath had demurred with what looked convincingly like a shiver of horror inside their silvery overall.Fassin got the impression that just being close to the Sepulcraft and its ancient collection of crumbling, lifeless ships was bad enough for them.The Ythyn were a Scavenger species with a speciality: they collected the dead.They did nothing with them, just stored them sorted roughly by category, type and size, and they usually only collected those bodies  and sometimes the ships and other devices they arrived on  that nobody else wanted.But it was still an irredeemably macabre habit and as a result they shared a generic nickname with other death obsessed species, having become known as Morbs.Fassin and Ysul were welcomed in the cavernous, gently lit entrance hall by a Ythyn officer, a great dark avian three metres tall in a glistening, near transparent slick suit over skin like dark blue parchment.Tightly bound double wings, which fully stretched would have spread a dozen metres, indicated the Ythyn was a junior.It stood on an uneven tripod of legs: one thick limb to the rear, two thinner ones in front.The creatures lipped beak was inlaid with precious metals, glittering under the gel of the slick suit.Its two eyes were huge roundels of black.Thin, curved pipes led from its nostril gratings to sets of small tanks on its back like spherical eggs of tarnished silver.There were no atmosphere locks on an Ythyn ship; the crew, like their dead charges, spent their entire time in hard vacuum.Exposed only to that hushed nothingness, enclosed by the great ship and so kept within a few degrees of absolute zero, the bodies of the dead could lie undisturbed and uncorrupted by nothing more than whatever had killed them and by the effects of their slow or sudden freezing, for aeons.You are welcome, the Ythyn officer told them in a flat, unaccented signal, prefixed only by formal signifiers for sadness and reverence.You are Mr Taak and you are Mr Ysul, yes?Yes, Fassin sent.I am Duty Receptioneer Ninth Lapidarian.I am happy and honoured to be known as Ninth or just Duty.Tell me, have either of you two gentlemen made any arrangements for the treatment or disposal of your bodies, after death?* * *  The Ythyn had been collecting the dead for a billion years, the result of a kind of gruesome techno curse visited upon them by a species they had fought against and been utterly defeated by.They had lost their small empire, lost their few planets, lost their major habitats and most of their ships and they had even lost themselves, coerced into a programme of genetic amendment that turned them from intellectually rounded beings into creatures utterly obsessed with death.The cruelty and cleverness of their vanquishers had lain in identifying and choosing a latent weakness congenital to the Ythyn.They had always been a little overly fascinated with mortality compared with the norm of vaguely similar species, but not to the stage of serious abnormality and certainly not to the point that it in any way defined them.And if they had been so grotesquely psychologically disfigured in the process of making them so excessively morbid that they ceased to be iden tifiably themselves there would have been no artistry, no fitness in their punishment.Instead, by this subtle but significant tweaking of their own bodies instruction set, they became what they might have become anyway had some bizarre shiftings in their environment and circumstances so decreed.Those who had not taken their own lives and refused to submit to the inheritable amendment were killed or hunted down and forced to undergo the treatment anyway, though most of those so treated killed themselves as well.The survivors became wanderers, one of the dozens of planet evolved species denied or  in a few cases  eschewing any sort of home world.They built massive cold, dark ships and accrued enormous libraries and data reservoirs filled with the subject of death.They haunted the sites of great battles, terrible massacres and awful disasters.Over time, they began to gather the unclaimed dead from such sites, storing them more or less as they found them in their great airless ships, each carrying a cargo of collected death, plodding from one end of the galaxy to the other or gradually spiralling around it.Too big for wormhole travel, loath even to approach too close to a star, the Sepulcraft depended on smaller ships to harvest the dead.Even these rarely used wormholes these days.The Propylaea, which had charge of all the Mercatorias portals, was not a charity, and demanded money for passage.The Ythyn had little to offer in payment.They collected ships from those bringing the dead  or themselves, to die  but those were usually hulks, wrecks or near the end of their useful working lives and anyway regarded by the Ythyn as sacred, amongst the dead themselves.There were occasional donations and bequests from many different societies but they were few and far between.When they could afford to, and there were bodies to be got from the far end of a wormhole, an Ythyn ship would spend the little collateral it had accumulated and send a needle craft to make the collection.But usually they just physically followed the galaxys generally sporadic instances of mass death.That they had long since dutifully gathered up the remaining bodies of the now extinct species which had inflicted their punishment upon them and could therefore relatively easily and without resistance have re amended themselves back to their original selves, but had chosen not to, was either their most poignant tragedy of all, or a recognition that they had found a place within the galactic scheme of things that suited them better than might any other.We are on our way to the Chistimonouth system, Duty Receptioneer Ninth Lapidarian told the Dweller and the human as they made their way along a vast curved corridor deep within the giant ship.The tall birdlike being used one of its two thin forelegs to manipulate the controls of a small cagelike car that carried them in perfect silence along a monorail set in the centre of the wide tunnel.It was perfectly dark, too.They were having to use active sensing to illuminate the seemingly never ending corridor.We seek the mortal remains of a newly contacted Serpenterian civilisation, a possible offshoot of the Desii Chau (themselves, lamentably, no more; extinct, or, at the very best, deep within the fifth category of abatement), unadopted, which fell prey, sadly, to a series of solar flares some centuries ago.The sole inhabited planet was sorely affected.Of the single sentient species thereon, it is believed that no living trace remains.It will be our privilege and our duty, when we arrive there in another few decades, to inter within these hallowed halls as many of the still unburied as we are able.How will they be unburied?Ysul asked.Do they float?Wont they all have sunk into their own depths?Into water or mud or dissolved rock or something?The corridors were lined with the dead: stapled, pinned, stitched or ice welded to the tubular surface (the concept of floors, walls and ceilings had some meaning while the ship was under power, but it was temporary).A few body types were best preserved in cavities, alcoves sealed with diamond leaf.Those happily buried will be left where they lie, underground, Duty told them.Some remains are expected in structures, even after all this time.The reports we have had from scouter species indicate that there may be many unclaimed cadavers still in space, at Lagrange points.What if theyre all gone?Ysul asked.What if somebodys beaten you to it and eaten them or recycled them or something?Then we will make our way to the next location where we may honour the dead, the dark bird told them, imperturbable.Come to think of it, Ysul said brightly,  there might be a few bods to pick up in a place called Ulubis fairly soon.Fassin looked at the Dweller but he wasnt paying any attention.Ulubis, Duty said.I have not heard of this place.Is it a planet?System, Ysul said.Home of the planet Nasqueron.In Stream Quaternary, one of the Southern Tendril Reefs.Ah, yes.Rather far away from here.Lots of humans there and another lot on their way, Ysul said.Probably going to be a war.Lot of deaths, Id imagine.You collect humans?We have difficulties only with certain Cincturian species, the bird creature told them.Humans we have heard of and accommodated in the past, though not on this craft.I shall pass on your information at the earliest opportunity to our most proximate Sepulcraft.They may well be aware already, of course,  and possibly on their way even as we speak.However, we are grateful for your thoughtfulness.My pleasure, Ysul said, sounding pleased with himself.He glanced at Fassin.What?Fassin looked away.They were passing bodies spread against the tunnels surface like small solidified explosions of rock.Palonne, their guide informed them.Ossile, obviously.Victims of war.Subject to a parasitic stone rot virus of some sort.Fascinating, Ysul said.Are we nearly at this Leisicrofe fellow yet?Duty looked at a small display clipped to one of his cinched in wings.Another few hundred metres.Whats he up to here, anyway?Ysul asked.Up to?The Ythyn sounded uncertain.Just studying you people, is he?Why, no.No, of course not.The Ythyn officer was silent for a moment.Oh dear.Fassin and Ysul exchanged looks.Fassin said,  Youre not saying hes dead, are you?Well, yes.Of course.This is a Sepulcraft, gentlemen.I was under the impression that you simply wanted to see the body.* * *  The news came while she was asleep.Taince watched an hours old recording of the faint, sideways seen, blue shifted glimmers approaching from the direction of the E 5 Discon as the Starveling invasion fleet started braking for its arrival in Ulubis system.The invaders would take nearly three months to reach Ulubis.The Summed Fleet was still four months travel away, including its own, more dramatic deceleration regime, due to start in a little more than eighty days.The Fleet tacticians had learned quite a lot just from the braking profile of E 5 Discons fleet.First, it was big: a thousand ships or more, unless there was something outlandishly clever going on with dummy drive signatures.Second, it was staying ninety five per cent together, with only a few dozen smaller ships venturing ahead of the main fleet.This might imply a significant straight through, braking beyond force still hidden, though from the rest of the profile this didnt look so likely.The size, definition and shifted frequency signatures of the drives themselves revealed a relatively slow, old tech vessel capability envelope.Basically all but the lightest craft in the Summed Fleet force would be able to take on all but the heaviest of the invaders ships with a better than average chance of prevailing, and anything that couldnt be outfought could be outrun (for whatever that was worth when there was nowhere to run to).And there was one behemoth in there, a giant ship, probably a command and control lander  and troop carrier plus facili ties and repair vessel.At least a billion tonnes, klicks across, doubtless very heavily armoured and armed and escorted, but a classic grade A high value target, a possible king piece, a back breaker, if it could be successfully engaged and destroyed or taken out of action or even captured.Just posting a powerful enough guard ship screen to try and keep it safe in the event of a serious attack threat would significantly sap the invading\ occupying forces abilities, cut down their dispositional options and drastically curtail their split regroup capacity.The Fleet tacticians had been positively cruel about this dinosaur of a ship.A vanity piece, they called it, an Idiot Aboard!sign hung round the neck of the enemy fleet.Every space faring species that built warcraft quickly found out one way or another  often the hard way  that big ships just didnt work except as a hideously expensive way of impressing the more credulous type of native.Flexibility, manoeuvrability, low unit risk cost, distributed inherent damage resistance, fully parsed battle space side blind denotation control grammar these and other even more arcane concepts were what really mattered in modern space warfare, apparently, and a Really Big Ship just didnt sit too comfortably with any of them.The tacticians pretty much spoke their own language, were mostly very intense, and blinked a lot.So a strong point thats really a weak point, Taince had suggested at one of their briefings.That would be a viable alternative definition, one of them said, after a moment or twos thought.Since just a week ago, though, relatively little evidence of further activity.Well, the Discon invaders had arrived later than anticipated, and the Summed Fleet forces were arriving earlier.Deliberate, on their part, of course.The invaders would have quickly found out when Ulubis had been told to expect the Summed Fleets arrival, and it was always prudent to keep the enemy off balance, to upset their assumptions.Let them think they had so much time and then arrive early before theyd got everything prepared.Smiting.It was all about smiting.That was one of Admiral Kisipts favourite words.The Voehn Fleet Commander knew it in several hundred different languages, including Earth Anglish.Be ready at all times to smite the enemy.Strike with speed, decisiveness and weight.Taince found herself lightly smitten with one of the junior male officers, discovered it was mutual and took part in some invasive tussling of her own.The time displays ticked down steadily towards the point where theyd have to get back into their lonely little individual pods again for the deceleration burn that would bring them down from near light speed to something close to Ulubis zero, for the start of the attack.* * *  The Cineropoline Sepulcraft Rovruetz spun very slowly beneath the Velpin, still gently accelerating for its distant target system and its unburied cargo of the long dead.The Velpin was tracking round the outer rim of the giant craft, senses primed.Fassin and Ysul were back aboard.They had been shown to the lifeless body of Leisicrofe, ice welded to the side of the great dark corridor in the company of a half dozen other dead Dwellers.Very well preserved, as you see, Duty Receptioneer Ninth Lapidarian had pointed out.I hope you feel this setting is appropriate.The Ythyn officer had still been upset at the earlier misunderstanding.So he just died, then?Ysul had asked.Very suddenly, apparently.We found him drifting  rolling along in his esuit, actually  a few days after he arrived.He had expressed an interest in mapping the distribution of bodies of different species and species types while he was here.We saw no reason not to allow him to do so.They werent permitted to use reaction motors inside the Sepulcraft.Ysul had used his esuited spine arms to push himself over to the side of the tunnel.Hed landed awkwardly by the Dwellers body, which was naked save for a small hub cloth.I have no idea whether this is this Leisicrofe guy or not, frankly, Ysul had said.But it is a Dweller, probably from Nasqueron and he is most certainly dead.Any sign of anything?Fassin asked.Ysul had inspected the body, using lights and radar sense, finding nothing.Hed unclipped the corpses hub cloth and shaken it.Fassin had sensed their Ythyn host preparing to object, but a moment later Ysul had replaced the hub cloth and was looking round the back of the body where ice attached it to the tunnel wall.Nothing, hed sent back.There, one half of Quercer Janath said.On one of the Velpins screens, a flickering outline appeared around one of the abandoned ships littering the carbuncularly irregular outer hull of the Sepulcraft.Fassin looked at the craft.It was a simple black ellipsoid, maybe sixty metres long.Deep space cold, lifeless.That it?Ysul asked.You sure?Its a Dweller Ail Purpose, Single Occupancy Standard Pattern SoloShip, the truetwin told them.And it pings recent.Can you wake its systems?Fassin asked.Find out where it was last, where it came from?The travelcaptain looked at him.Doesnt work like that.Pay attention.They got permission from the Ythyn to lift the SoloShip and join it to the Velpin.They warmed it up and introduced a standard gas giant atmosphere.There was just about enough room for Ysul and Fassin to board together.Quercer Janath had already laser synched the little ships closed down computer matrix to that of the Velpin.The screens, tanks, surfaces and other displays flickered, steadied and shone.The craft beeped and clicked around them.It still felt cold.Ysul knocked and tapped a few of the more obviously delicate looking bits of machinery with his hub arms.You getting anything?he asked.The truetwin was staying on board the larger craft.Theres stuff in the log, one half told them.Thats sailor talk for diary.No saying!Ysul said.Truly.But its not accessible from here.Youll have to input from there.How, exactly?Fassin asked.How should we know?Not our ship.Experiment.They experimented.The correct technique involved Ysul pressing in to a Dweller shaped double alcove sensory nook and pressing four glyphboard icons on four different glyph boards at once.The main screen stopped showing stars and the darkly glittering hull of the Sepulcraft and started showing what looked like the interior of a small library instead.Ysul reached out into the virtual space and pulled down a book whose spine said Log.He opened it.A motionless Dweller hub faced them in close up.Well, Ysul said, that certainly looks like the stiff in the big space hearse.We can see him.Should be a Play button.Try hitting it.Gee, Ysul said.Thank fuck you guys are there.He hit Play.* * *  Taince Yarabokin woke from a light sleep to a low level alarm, telling her not even to think about instigating a pod quit regime.She swung to the exterior fore view display and looked out.Ulubis glowed sharp and blue ahead, a tiny sun amongst the surrounding scrape of stars, at last.The blueness was a function of the ship and the fleets colossal speed, hammering into the light waves, compressing wavelength.Taince switched from LR Sensors to ship state.A fierce and terrible force pulled at everything.Theyd started their final deceleration burn.The majority of the fleet was losing speed hard, piling up a hundred or more gravities as it braked for the approach to and arrival at Ulubis system, still over a month away.Another group of ships  one full squadron of sixty vessels  was not decelerating so rapidly.A dozen were not slowing at all and would maintain full speed all the way to and most of the way through the system, their crews and systems trained over hundreds of simulations for an ultra high speed pass across Ulubis planetary system which would last for less than four hours.In that time, less than twenty days from now, they would have to collect and evaluate all the data they could on the then current state of the system and then both signal their intelligence back to the ships behind and choose a suite of attack profiles from a vast menu of possibilities they carried in their data banks before loosing all the munitions they could against whatever hostiles they had identified.They hoped the pickings would be rich for them.Theyd be arriving with little warning only a month after the Starveling fleet had struck.With luck the situation would be fluid and the E 5 Discon forces wouldnt have had time to organise their defences properly.Then, even before those advance ships were all the way through the system, they would begin their own still more violent deceleration, to come to a stop a light month beyond, and get back to Ulubis weeks after the main fleet had arrived: at best to help with the mopping up, at worst to deliver a retaliatory hammer blow.The remainder of the Advance attack Squadron would pass through the system in small groups of ships, their arrival staggered, unpredictable, distributed, their tactics in part defined by whatever the high speed craft had discovered.With luck, with what they hoped and trusted was a good battle plan, the waves of war craft, each able to spend more fighting time in the system than its immediate predecessor, would deliver a succession of softening up blows against the enemy: rocking it, unbalancing it, confusing and bloodying it.The main body of the fleet, arriving like a bunched fist, would just provide one final massive knockout punch.Their drive light would precede them, of course.There would be no complete surprise.The Starveling invasion had given the defenders of Ulubis even more warning, not that there was much they could have done with it.The E 5 Discon fleet had slowed right down, shut its drives off almost as one while still a few days out, well within the systems Oort shell, then slowed further as its lead ships crossed the boundary into the planetary system.For the next few weeks after the drive signatures meshed with the Ulubis system and shut off, when the invasion must have been at its height, there had been a lot of weapon blink.Much of it had been around the planets Sepekte and Nasqueron.* * *  My name is Leisicrofe of Hepieu, Nasqueron equatorial.This is my last testament.I will presume that whoever you are you have followed me for the data which I carried on behalf of my fellow Dweller, the scholar Valseir of Schenehen.If you have not, and this recording has fallen to you in what one might term a casual manner, it may be of little interest.If, however, you do seek the data I held, then I must tell you now that you are going to be disappointed.Something in Fassin seemed to break and fall away.Uh oh, Ysul said.This may seem unfortunate and may make you angry.However, I have most likely done you a considerable favour, as it is my sincere and firm belief that what I was asked to carry was something I should not have been, and something that nobody should have been or should be asked to take responsibility for.It was not something I was supposed to know about, of course, and it was not really Valseirs fault that I came into possession of the knowledge of what it represented.Talks a lot, doesnt he?Ysul said.To my shame, I think I must be more shallow than my friend Valseir gave me credit for.He gave me the data sealed in a safe keep box and asked me not to open it.I said I would not.He did not even ask me for my word, thinking, I am sure, that simply asking a friend and fellow scholar such a thing, and receiving such an assurance, was guarantee enough.However, I am not like Valseir.I am inquisitive by nature, not as the result of an intellectual fascination with any particular subject.I resisted the urge to open the safekeep box for many years while I was on my travels, but eventually I surrendered to temptation.I opened the safekeep, I began to read what was inside, and realised its importance.Even then I might have stopped reading, closed the box and put it away again, and had I done that I would still be alive.Instead, I carried on reading  and this has resulted in my death.I can only claim that perhaps I was in a sort of trance of disbelief at the time.More likely taken some recreational substances, Ysul snorted.And so I came to hold within myself the knowledge, the meaning of that which I had been asked to keep safe, rather than just having charge of the medium containing it.Realising what I now knew, and comprehending that it was of inestimable value, I came to the conclusion that I could not be trusted with it.While not entirely understanding what I had read, I could not forget it.I could tell others, and it was not impossible that I might be made to tell what I knew through the use of drugs or more direct intervention with my brain and mind.Nutter, Ysul said.Whats that?one of Quercer Janath said distantly over the open link to the Velpin.Hmm.Dont know.It didnt sound like they were paying attention to what was being said by the recording of Leisicrofe.I will not pretend that I had not been thinking of my own death for some time.However, it was habitually within the context of having completed my studies into the many differing forms of the Cincturia and publishing a learned  I had even hoped an at the time definitive  work on this, my chosen and beloved field of study.Knowing what I now know, I have thought it best, however reluctantly, to curtail my studies forthwith and kill myself as soon as may decently be achieved.I shall do so here, in the Ythyn Cineropoline Sepulcraft Rovruetz, where my death will at least appear to have a fraction more meaning than it might have had elsewhere.Looks like, or Fassin heard over the open channel.Ping it?No!Are you ?Shut off that  The open channel closed.Fassin looked back to the access hatch and the short ship to ship connecting them to the Velpin.Leisicrofe was still speaking.Will forgive me.You should.If you know what it is you are looking for, then all I will say is that it looked more like a code and frequency, not what I believe was expected.But it is quite gone now.Destroyed, along with the safekeep box itself, thrown into the sun called Direaliete.I know of no other copy.If none of this makes any sense to you, then please respect an old, and  as it turns out  foolish, Dwellers last wish, and leave him here in peace.The recording froze and an end message signal flashed.Fassin stared at the image of the dead Dweller.It was over.Hed failed.Maybe now there was no way ever to find out whether the Dweller List meant anything or even had ever meant anything.Totally mad, Ysul said, with something like a sigh.He fiddled with the glyphboard controls.Looks like thats our lot.He turned to Fassin.Doesnt sound too hopeful, does it, young human me lad?The open channel from the ship clicked on suddenly.Get out!Quercer Janath screamed.Ten seconds to get off there and back in the Velpin!Being attacked!Must run!Fassin shook himself out of his shock and started backing towards the open hatch leading to the Velpin.Ysul pulled out of the sensory nook, began to follow, one hub limb scratching at his mantle.This madness is obviously contag  Fucking

to it.Ysul was still behind him, moving quickly along the exit.Fassin swung through, flipped, turned and grabbed the hatchs moving edge with his left manipulator.The closing hatch nearly took the manipulator off.Fassin was swung around by the force of it and found himself having to brace with his other manipulator against the lock interior, struggling to keep the hatch  grinding, mechanism humming mightily  from closing.Somebody holding that hatch open?one half of Quercer Janath shouted indignantly.Out the way, Fassin!Ysul yelled, rising fast straight out of the ship to ship and colliding heavily with Fassins gascraft, sending the two of them tumbling through the lock and into the Velpins interior.Error\failure messages from the gascrafts left manipulator arm crowded against one edge of Fassins field of vision.The hatch slammed shut behind them.Immediately, a great force smashed them against the compartments sternward bulkhead.They were stuck there, unmoving, the arrowhead snagged over the Dwellers tipped left discus until the increasing acceleration and a series of sharp vibrations made Fassin slide off one edge of Ysuls carapace and whack down onto the carbon bulkhead by his side.The ship roared around them.Engines are on, one takes it, Ysul said, wheezing.Fassin could feel the apparent gravity building still further.They were at something over twenty gee already.A young, fit Dweller with no esuit protection stuck on his side against an inelastic surface could take about twenty four, twenty five gees continuous before their carapace just collapsed and turned their insides to mush.The Velpins acceleration topped out at twenty two gees.All right back there?their travelcaptain asked.Not really, Fassin said.Youre kind of near crushing Ysul.Acknowledged.Not outrunning the fucker.Cant.Cut off and come about.Surrender.Agree.The acceleration snapped off.Fassin and Ysul were instantly weightless, rebounding fractionally from the bulkhead just by the released compression in the hull of one and the carapace of the other.Get up here, you two, Quercer Janath told them.The Voehn ship was a klick long needle spined with swing guns and weapon tubes.It came quickly up on them and was alongside by the time the human in his gascraft and the Dweller Ysul got to the Velpins control space.Since when do the Voehn choose to attack Dweller craft going about their?the travelcaptain began to ask.Be quiet, said an imageless voice.Make yourself ready for boarding.Quercer Janaths shiny suit rustled as the truetwin turned to look at Fassin and Ysul while tapping some controls.Images of the Velpin appeared in holo displays, showing hatches and doors flashing in outline.The Voehn have turned pirates, Quercer Janath told them calmly.How fucking dare they!Ysul roared.They didnt follow us through the wormhole, did they?Fassin asked.Ha!No.The truetwin seemed purely amused.No, they were waiting in this system.Assume well see why shortly.The fucking scumbag bastards will pay grievously for this outrage!Ysul yelled, shaking with fury.A shudder rang through the Velpin and alarms started blaring.Quercer Janath roted closer to a brightly flashing display.Look at that.Penetrated amidships with a cut through.Cameras briefly showed a thick tube extending from the middle of the Voehn ship into a neat circular hole in the hull of the Velpin.Then the images crazed and faded.Other displays started to disappear.The alarms warbled down to a croak, then shut off.Fassin thought he could smell burning.And us cooperatively opening all our orifices.Fucking typical.Here they come.Thundering through.Another display showed an abstract of large beings pouring through the breach and spreading through the ship, bouncing off surfaces in the zero gee.The largest force was coming straight towards the control space.Then that display shut down too.All the lights went out.The background noises of the ship, hardly noticed until they ceased, just faded away.A ragged pulse of what sounded like heavy steps came pounding from the closed door leading to the Velpins central corridor.Probably going to zap us soon as they Quercer Janath began.Then the door punctured with a coughing noise and something small flew into the middle of the control space and exploded into a million barbs like dust.Ah ha.Though what got us was a fucking EMP cannon.Aimed at the ships vulnerables.Indeed.So there we are.And here.Indeed.See what happens?See what happens Better ship, anyway.Fassin was being carried within a sort of transparent, braced sack by two big creatures like giant eight legged dogs in mirror armour, one at either end.He was still in the Velpin.The cut through tube was a great pipe with a slanted hole, like the end of a massive syringe plunged into the guts of the ship.The two Voehn commandos flicked him and themselves up the tube and into the Voehn ship with near effortless ease.Fassin, confused, senses ringing, unable to move, peered through the transparent material of the prison stretcher and caught a glimpse of another two Voehn behind him carrying Ysul, similarly wrapped.They went through a rotate lock.The Voehn ship was dark inside, faintly red lit.It was in hard vacuum, like the Sepulcraft.The wrapping round the little gascraft ballooned taut.Fassin, Ysul and the truetwin were taken through another lock and into a pressurised, slightly heated circular chamber.The wrappings around them collapsed again.They were settled into something like dent seats and clamped there with thickly shining restraints.They were half unwrapped from their transparent covers, sufficient for them to be able to hear and see and speak.The warriors tested their bonds and then left.Fassin looked around as best he could.Ysul and the travel captain appeared still to be unconscious, Ysuls ruff mantles waving limply in the free fall and Quercer Janath, still in the shiny coveralls, floating seemingly lifeless in the dent seat.The chamber was plain, just a flattened ovoid, filled with a gas giant atmosphere entirely breathable by a Dweller but that didnt smell quite right.Light came dimly from every surface.A hint of gravity built up, producing about a quarter standard.A door appeared and irised open, closing behind a trio of Voehn: two of the mirror armoured commandos and another wearing just a torso uniform decorated with various insignia and a holstered side arm.He stood and looked at the three prisoners, the great grey snout face and fist sized multiple lidded eyes turning fractionally as he directed his attention from one to another.He arched his long body and flexed his back spines, raising all ten with what looked like a sensual motion.Blizzardskin on the Voehns spines scintillated like a minutely shattered mirror.Fassin, trying hard not to lose consciousness again, thought dreamily of the screen series hed watched as a child  Attack Squad Voehn.Had that been its name?and struggled to recall what the uniforms and insignia might indicate, remembering only slowly.The Voehn in the uniform was a Prime Commander.A multi talent.Top guy here, certainly.Significantly over ranked for a ship this size, unless it was on a special mission.(Oh oh. )One of the mirror armour soldiers waved a hand held instrument at them, watching a display.He barely glanced at the results from Fassin and Ysul, then did a double take when the device was aimed at Quercer Janath.He altered a few controls, swept the machine over the truetwins still lifeless looking body again and said something to the Voehn commander, who moved over, looked at the display and made a small swaying motion with his head.He clicked the machine off and came over to the prisoners, saying something as though to one of his decorations.The restraints holding the gascraft and the two Dweller bodies slid back into the floor.The Voehn commander took off a glove and ran one leathery looking hand over the surface of the little gascraft, then Ysuls carapace, then felt the shiny membrane covering Quercer Janath.He looked for and found a catch and opened the coverall up so that it hung down over the transparent material the prisoners had all been trussed in.The commander looked very closely at Quercer Janaths signal skin, and seemed to sniff it.He looked at Fassin.Youre awake already.His voice was quiet, with a deep, gurgling quality.Reply.Im awake, Fassin acknowledged.He tried moving his left manipulator.More error\damage messages.He moved his right manipulator and shifted fractionally in the dent seat.Aside from the partial constriction of the transparent material covering the gascrafts rear, he was actually fairly free to move; even the prisoner wrap felt like it would shuck off without too much difficulty.The Voehn reached for something in his uniform pocket and waved it at Ysul, who jerked once and then shook for a few moments, fringe mantles stiffening and limbs quivering.Warrgh, he said.The commander went to point the device at Quercer Janath, who said quite cheerfully, Already awake actually, thanks all the same.The Voehn looked through slitted eyes at the truetwin for a moment, then pocketed the device again and moved back to take in the view of all three prisoners.The two mirror armoured guards stood on either side of where the door had appeared.The commander sat back a fraction, resting on his rear legs and tail, crossing his forearms.To the point.I am Commander Inialcah of the Summed Fleet Special Forces Division Ultra Ship Protreptic.You are, in every sense, mine.We know what you have been looking for.We have been waiting for somebody to come here.We are combing your ship for data, hidden or otherwise, but we dont expect to find anything germane.We have authority covering all eventualities.That means we can do anything we want with or to you.That latitude will not need to be exploited if you cooperate fully and answer any questions honestly and completely.Now.You are the Dwellers known as Ysul and Quercer Janath, and the human Fassin Taak, correct?Ysul grunted.Hi, the travelcaptain replied.Correct, Fassin said.He could see Ysul moving, working his body as though to get rid of the prison wrap.Oh, no, dont do this, he thought.He was about to say it when    Who the fuck do you fucking think you are, you piratical pipsqueak?Ysul bellowed.The Dweller wriggled free from the transparent material and floated above the dent seat.The two guards by the doorway didnt even start to move.The commander, arms still crossed, watched as the Dweller roted up to him, towering over him.How fucking dare you start attacking a ship and taking people hostage!Do you know who I am?Go back to your seat, the commander said, voice level.Thats probably quite good ad the truetwin began.Go back to your fucking own planet!Ysul roared, and stretched out a hub limb to push the Voehn.The Voehn commander seemed to disappear in a blur of movement, as though all along hed been a hologram and was now dissolving into individual pixels, rearranging into a grey cloud shot through with rainbow shards.Ysul shuddered once and was sent sailing serenely back, colliding with the wall behind the dent seat and the discarded prison wrap.He hung there, then revolved backwards and fell slowly to the floor, spinning gradually downward along his rim like a coin on a table.The Voehn commander was sitting where and how he had been, unruffled.That was not cooperating fully, he said, voice soft.Urgh, Ysul said thickly.His carapace held two dents, one on each discus rim.There was another large, broken looking bruise on his inner hub.That was serious damage for a Dweller, the equivalent of a broken limb or two and perhaps a compressed skull fracture for a human.Fassin hadnt even seen quite how the Voehn commander had hit Ysul.Hed have gone back for a replay but the little gascrafts systems seemed to have been zapped and they werent providing any recording ability.Oh fuck, he thought.Were all going to die and the only one they can torture properly is me.He saw himself peeled, prised out of the gascraft like a snail from its shell.Ysul drew himself very slowly upright again, shaking slightly.He was mumbling something unintelligible.Quercer Janath turned very slowly, looked at the Dweller and then turned back to the commander.With your permission, sir?What?the Voehn asked.Like to aid our fellow.Go ahead.The travelcaptain let the prison wrap fall to the floor, then moved over to Ysul and guided the injured Dweller back to his dent seat.Ysul continued to talk; nonsense somewhere beneath the level of clear comprehension.With a noise like a sigh, the truetwin settled into its own housing, sparing one more look for Ysul, still trembling and mumbling to himself.We are not here to play games, we are here to discover truth, the Voehn commander told them.The complete truth may save you.Anything else will surely be your ruin.The Protreptic is a Lustral Order special forces ship, generally charged with the hunting down and extermination of anathematics, that is, the obscenities commonly called AIs.We have unbounded authority on this mission as on all our missions.You are entirely within our control and will cooperate without question or reserve, or will suffer accordingly.I hereby deem you to have understood fully everything I have told you thus far.Ah, well, Quercer Janath said.The truetwin sounded mildly peeved, as though it hadnt been listening to the commander at all and had just heard something moderately discomfiting over an internal radio link.The instrument one of the guards had pointed at the three prisoners, now slung on a strap across his back, glowed through red to yellow and spat tiny sparks.The soldier moved almost as quickly as the commander, turning and twisting and pulling the device off his back to throw it to the floor.It skidded and thudded against the curve of the wall, smoking.The commander looked at it for a moment, then turned calmly back to look at the prisoners again.Neat trick, he said, sounding amused.Whos the show off?He looked at Fassin.The two guards had levelled their guns at them, one pointing directly at Fassin, the other between Ysul and the truetwin.Ah, guilty, commander, said Quercer Janath breezily.But, heck, thats nothing.Watch this.The dim grey glow that came from every surface suddenly brightened wildly, leaving them all  the two Dwellers, the three Voehn and Fassin himself  seeming to float in the midst of an insanely bright flare of nova bright light.It was as though theyd all been instantly dropped into the surface of a sun.Fassin heard himself yelp and felt automatics in the gascrafts senses snap their burn out defences down.Very heavy again, and very suddenly.Fassin could see the light, he could swear.It was coming through the hull of the gascraft, hitting his closed, human eyes.Three great thumps sounded, shaking the air, echoing round the chamber.Somewhere in the middle of this he opened his visuals enough to see them all hanging, black blobs in light, and tiny bright crimson lines of still greater brilliance joining the Voehn to Quercer Janath.Stupidly, for a moment he waited to see the travelcaptain explode or get thrown back, but the great circular shape roted back barely at all; it was the Voehn who were getting thrown all over the place.Sudden silence, sudden darkness.Blind again.Fassin let the gascraft open up the equivalent of one eye until it was at normal exposure.There had been some damage but he could still see.There was a surprising amount of infrared radiation.He looked at where it was coming from.It was coming from the Voehn.They glowed.One of the guards lay spread, opened, against the curved wall by the doorway.The other was face down, two forelimbs blown off, halfway between the door and the place where the commander had been.The commander was making his way, jerkily, towards the tall figure of Quercer Janath.The commanders head had been half blown off, a side of skull hanging, twitching as he walked, held on only by connective tissue.He raised his arms and took a few more awkward steps towards the travelcaptain, then collapsed to the floor, loosening completely, like something thawing.Not fooling anyone, a voice that might have been Quercer Janaths said.The restraints slid up around Fassin and the still shaking Ysul.Hey hey, the travelcaptain said.The apparent gravity went crazy, shifting in an instant from one vector to another, ahead to astern in an instant.This had the effect of batting the Voehn commander from the floor to the ceiling and back again half a dozen times or so.Then he blurred into action.A half headless grey whirlwind darted towards Quercer Janath, almost quicker than the eye could follow.In an instant, all movement ceased.A tableau: the Voehn commander was held by the neck, struggling weakly, in the grip of one of Quercer Janaths outstretched hub arms.Oh, how ever did we let it come to this?the truetwin said, positively sultry.It snapped the commanders neck, then two thin blue beams cut through the gaseous atmosphere from near the travelcaptains outer discus fringes, dicing the struggling, flicking, spasming body of the commander until there was almost nothing left to hold.The truetwin let the remains drop to the floor.There was, Fassin noted, a grisly kind of wetness involved in this action.This is the ships autonomous loyalty system!shouted a voice from the gas.Integrity infraction!Integrity infraction!Self destruct in  Oh, said Quercer Janath, sounding tired, really.The voice from nowhere came back.This is the ships autonomou  Silence.And so much for that.The fus goin on?Ysul mumbled.Ditto that, Fassin said.Ah, good, Quercer Janath said.Still with us.A relief.Yeah, its ours, one half said cheerfully.The restraints slid back into the floor again.Ah, where to start?The Voehn will be annoyed.The Mercatoria will be annoyed.Not our fault.Didnt start it.Quercer Janath moved away from the dent seat, over the body parts of the Voehn commander and the two guards, flicking the soldiers weapons away from their bodies as it went.The truetwin hovered by the door.Seriously, Fassin said.What is happening?He looked at what was left of the three Voehn whod been in the chamber with them.How did you do that?Quercer Janath were still studying the doorway, which remained closed.We are not a Dweller, the travelcaptain said, not turning back to look at Fassin.One of its limbs went out and prodded at the wall around where the door ought to be.Purely mechanical.Very annoying.Mr Taak, would you look after Mr Ysul?Please?Fassin floated out of his dent seat, towards Ysul.He put his right manipulator out.Kin look after self, Ysul said, trying to shrug Fassins arm off.He sighed.So what are you?Fassin asked.An AI, Mr Taak, the creature said, still tapping round the door, not obviously looking back at him.What?he thought.Two AIs.An AI?Two fucking AIs?Were dead, Fassin thought.Indeed, two AIs.Keeps one from going mad.Well, more.For yourself.Hmm, as may be.Ysul moaned, then shook spastically.His sensory mantle ruffled.He looked about.Fuck, we still here?Ysul turned his attention to the dead Voehn.Fuck, he said.The Dweller made a show of turning towards Fassin.You seeing this too?Oh yes, Fassin told him.He looked at the creature feeling its way round the doorway.Youre an AI?Two AIs?he asked carefully.He could feel his skin crawl inside the shock gel.He couldnt help it.Hed been raised since birth to believe that AIs were the single greatest, most terrible enemy humanity and all biological, living things had ever faced.To be told, however preposterously, that he was trapped in a small space with one  let alone two  was to have one small, deep, vulnerable part of himself feel absolutely convinced that he was about to be ripped to bloody tatters at any moment.Thats right, Quercer Janath said absently.And weve just taken over this ship.Except we cant get out of this damn room.Cabin.We cant get out of this damn cabin.Whatever the.Most annoying.Purely    Mechanical.You said.Ah.Here we go.The travelcaptain struck a smart blow at a patch of wall.Then another.The door appeared and irised open, revealing a short corridor and another door.Quercer Janath turned to look at the Dweller and the human in his arrowhead esuit.Gentlemen.We must leave you for a while.Fuck that, action hero, Ysul said.You go, we go.Ysul paused.Well, unless theres an ambush out there.Obviously.Quercer Janath bobbed in the gas, laughing.Theres a vacuum out there, Ysul.And lots of angry, confused Voehn.The injured Dweller was silent for a moment.I forgot, he admitted.He shrugged.Okay.Hurry back.* * *  Saluus Kehar woke to a feeling of confusion and dread.There was a nagging feeling that what hed just experienced had not been an ordinary sleep, that there was something more to it.It had been somehow messier, even dirtier, than he might have expected.He had a sore head, but he didnt think hed been over indulging the day or evening before.Hed had a slightly boring, slightly depressing dinner with some of the Dweller Embassy people, a perplexing talk with Guard General Thovin, then a more pleasant interlude with Liss.Then sleep.That had been all, hadnt it?No terrible amount of drink or anything else to give him a headache and make it so hard to open his eyes.He really couldnt open his eyes.He tried very hard indeed but he couldnt do it.They wouldnt open.No light through his eyelids, either.And his breathing didnt feel right.He wasnt breathing!He tried to fill his lungs with air, but he couldnt breathe.He started to panic.He tried to move his body, bring his hands up to his face, to his eyes, to see if there was something over his head, but nothing moved  he was paralysed.Saluus felt his heart thud in his chest.There was a terrible, squirming, moving feeling in his guts, as though he was about to void his bowels or throw up or both.Mr Kehar?The voice didnt come through his ears.It was a virtual voice, a thought voice.He was in some sort of artificial environment.That at least started to make sense of what was going on.He must have been booked for some rejuvenation treatment.He was deep under, safe and fine in a clinic, probably one he owned.Theyd just got the wake up sequence wrong somehow, failing to monitor his signs properly.A whisper of painkiller, some feel good, de panic a simple enough cocktail for a Life Clinic to get together, youd have thought.And a fairly trivial mistake, but theyd still got it wrong.Hed have words.Except hed had nothing booked.Hed even cancelled a regular check up appointment until after the Emergency.He hadnt been due to have anything done at all.An attack.They must have been attacked in the ship, maybe while they were asleep.He was in a hospital somewhere, in a tank.Oh fuck, maybe hed been really badly injured.Maybe he was just a head or something.Hello?he sent.It was easy enough to think speak rather than really speak, just like being in a deep game or  again  like having serious hospital treatment.You are Saluus Kehar?They didnt know his name?Could he have been drugged, zapped in some way?Oh fuck, had he been kidnapped?Who is this?he asked.Confirm your identity.Perhaps you didnt hear me.I asked who you are.A wave of pain passed up his body, starting at his toes and ending at his skull.It had a startling purity about it, a sort of ghastly, dissociative quality.It vanished as quickly as it had appeared, leaving a dull ache in his balls and teeth.If you do not cooperate, the voice said,  more pain will be used.He gagged, trying to speak with his mouth, and failing.What the fuck was that for?he sent, eventually.What have I ?Okay, look, Im Saluus Kehar.Where am I?You are an industrialist?Yes.I own Kehar Heavy Industries.What is the problem here?Where am I?What is your last memory before waking up?What?His last memory?He tried to think.Well, what he had just been thinking about.Liss.Being on the ship, on Hull 8770 and feeling like he was about to fall asleep.Then he wondered what had happened to Liss.Where could she be?Was she here, wherever here was?Was she dead?Should he mention her or not?Answer.I was falling asleep.Where?On a ship.A spacecraft, the Hull 8770.Which was where?In orbit around Nasq.Look, could you tell me where I am?Im perfectly willing to cooperate, tell you all you need to know, but I need some context here.I need to know where I am.Were you with anybody?I was with a friend, a colleague.Name?Her name is Liss Alentiore.Is she here?Where is she?Where am I?What is her post?Her?Shes my assistant, my private secretary.Silence.After a while he sent,  Hello?Silence.A click, and the darkness was replaced by light.Saluus was returned to something like the real world, with a real body.The ceiling was shiny silver, lined with hundreds of glowing lines.Wherever he was, it was very bright.He was in a bed, in about half gravity or less, held down by he couldnt move.He might not be held down physically by anything, but he still couldnt move anything major like hands or legs.Somebody dressed like a doctor or a nurse had just taken a kind of helmet thing off him.He blinked, licked his lips, feeling some sort of capacity for movement in his face and neck but nothing beyond.
