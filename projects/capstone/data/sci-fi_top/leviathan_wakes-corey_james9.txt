Holden said, and half a breath later, Naomi whistled low.Miller nodded to her almost as if he were accepting applause.The Nauvoos launching in a long parabolic course, building up speed.Itll hit Eros at a velocity and angle calculated to knock Eros toward the sun.Set off the bombs too.Between the impact energy and the fusion warheads, we figure the surface of Erosll be hot and radioactive enough to cook anything that tries to land until its too damn late, Miller finished, then sat back down.He looked up as if he was waiting for reactions.This was your idea?Holden asked Miller.Nauvoo part was.But we didnt know about the Lyell when we first talked about it.The booby trap things kind of improvised.I think itll work, though.Buy us enough time.I agree, Holden said.We need to keep Eros out of anyones hands, and I cant think of a better way to do it.Were in.Well shoo the science ship away while you do your work.Fred leaned forward in his chair with a creak and said, I knew youd be on board.Miller was more skeptical.Throwing a million people into the sun seemed like something you might balk at, the detective said with a humorless grin.Theres nothing human left on that station.Whats your part in all of this?You armchair quarterbacking now?It came out nastier than hed intended, but Miller didnt appear offended.Ill be coordinating security.Security?Why will they need security?Miller smiled.All his smiles looked like he was hearing a good joke at a funeral.In case something crawls out of an airlock, tries to thumb a ride, he said.Holden frowned.I dont like to think those things can get around in vacuum.I dont like that idea at all.Once we bring the surface temp of Eros up to a nice balmy ten thousand degrees, Im thinking it wont matter much, Miller replied.Until then, best be safe.Holden found himself wishing he shared the detectives confidence.What are the odds the impact and detonations just break Eros into a million pieces and scatter them all over the solar system?Naomi asked.Freds got some of his best engineers calculating everything to the last decimal to make sure that doesnt happen, Miller replied.Tycho helped build Eros in the first place.Theyve got the blueprints.So, said Fred.Lets deal with the last bit of business.Holden waited.You still have the protomolecule, Fred said.Holden nodded again.And?And, replied Fred.And the last time we sent you out, your ship was almost wrecked.Once Eros has been nuked, it will be the only confirmed sample around, outside of what might still be on Phoebe.I cant find any reason to let you keep it.I want it to remain here on Tycho when you go.Holden stood up, shaking his head.I like you, Fred, but Im not handing that stuff over to anyone who might see it as a bargaining chip.I dont think you have a lot of  Fred started, but Holden held up a finger and cut him off.While Fred stared at him in surprise, he grabbed his terminal and opened the crew channel.Alex, Amos, either of you on the ship?Im here, Amos said a second later.Finishing up some   Lock it down, Holden said over him.Right now.Seal it up.If I dont call you in an hour, or if anyone other than me tries to board, leave the dock and fly away from Tycho at best possible speed.Direction is your choice.Shoot your way free if you have to.Read me?Loud and clear, Cap, Amos said.If Holden had asked him to get a cup of coffee, Amos would have sounded exactly the same.Fred was still staring at him incredulously.Dont force this issue, Fred, Holden said.If you think you can threaten me, youre mistaken, Fred said, his voice flat and frightening.Miller laughed.Something funny?Fred said.That wasnt a threat, Miller replied.No?What would you call it?An accurate report of the world, Miller said.He stretched slowly as he talked.If it was Alex on board, he might think the captain was trying to intimidate someone, maybe back down at the last minute.Amos, though?Amos will absolutely shoot his way free, even if it means he goes down with the ship.Fred scowled, and Miller shook his head.Its not a bluff, Miller said.Dont call it.Freds eyes narrowed, and Holden wondered if hed finally gone too far with the man.He certainly wouldnt be the first person Fred Johnson had ordered shot.And he had Miller standing right next to him.The unbalanced detective would probably shoot him at the first hint someone thought it was a good idea.It shook Holdens confidence in Fred that Miller was even here.Which made it a little more surprising when Miller saved him.Look, the detective said.Fact is, Holden is the best person to carry that shit around until you decide what to do with it.Talk me into it, Fred said, his voice still tight with anger.Once Eros goes up, he and the Roci are going to have their asses hanging in the breeze.Someone might be angry enough to nuke him just on general principles.And how does that make the sample safer with him?Fred asked, but Holden had understood Millers point.They might be less inclined to blow me up if I let them know that Ive got the sample and all the Protogen notes, he said.Wont make the sample safer, Miller said.But it makes the mission more likely to work.And thats the point, right?Also, hes an idealist, Miller continued.Offer Holden his weight in gold and hell just be offended you tried to bribe him.Naomi laughed.Miller glanced at her, a small shared smile at the corner of his mouth, then turned back to Fred.Are you saying he can be trusted and I cant?Fred said.I was thinking more about the crew, Miller said.Holdens got a small bunch, and they do what he says.They think hes righteous, so they are too.My people follow me, Fred said.Millers grin was weary and unassailable.Theres a lot of people in the OPA, he said.The stakes are too high, Fred said.Youre kind of in the wrong career for safe, Miller said.Im not saying its a great plan.Just you wont get a better one.Freds slitted eyes glittered with equal parts frustration and rage.His jaw worked silently for a moment before he spoke.Captain Holden?Im disappointed with your lack of trust after all Ive done for you and yours.If the human race still exists a month from now, Ill apologize, Holden said.Get your crew out to Eros before I change my mind.Holden rose, nodded to Fred, and left.Naomi walked at his side.Wow, that was close, she said under her breath.Once theyd left the office, Holden said, I think Fred was half a second from ordering Miller to shoot me.Millers on our side.Havent you figured that out yet?Miller had known when hed taken Holdens side against his new boss that there were going to be consequences.His position with Fred and the OPA was tenuous to start with, and pointing out that Holden and his crew were not only more dedicated but also more trustworthy than Freds people wasnt the thing you did when you were kissing up.That it was the truth only made it worse.Hed expected some kind of payback.He would have been naive not to.Rise up, O men of God, in one united throng, the resisters sang.Bring in the days of bro ther hood, and end the night of wrong   Miller took off his hat and ran fingers through his thinning hair.It wasnt going to be a good day.The interior of the Nauvoo showed more patchwork and process than its hull suggested.Two kilometers long, its designers had built it as more than a huge ship.The great levels stacked one atop the other; alloy girders worked organically with what would have been pastoral meadows.The structure echoed the greatest cathedrals of Earth and Mars, rising up through empty air and giving both thrust gravity stability and glory to God.It was still metal bones and woven agricultural substrate, but Miller could see where it was all heading.A generation ship was a statement of overarching ambition and utter faith.The Mormons had known that.Theyd embraced it.Theyd constructed a ship that was prayer and piety and celebration all at the same time.The Nauvoo would be the greatest temple mankind had ever built.It would shepherd its crew through the uncrossable gulfs of interstellar space, humanitys best hope of reaching the stars  Or it would have been, if not for him.You want us to gas them, Pampaw?Diogo asked.Miller considered the resisters.At a guess, there might have been two hundred of them strung in linked chains across the access paths and engineering ducts.Transport lifts and industrial waldoes stood idle, their displays dark, their batteries shorted.Yeah, probably should, Miller sighed.The security team his security team numbered fewer than three dozen.Men and women more unified by the OPA issued armbands than by their training, experience, loyalties, or politics.If the Mormons had chosen violence, it would have been a bloodbath.If theyd put on environment suits, the protest would have lasted hours.Days, possibly.Instead, Diogo gave the signal, and three minutes later, four small comets arced out into the null g space, wavering on their tails of NNLP alpha and tetrahydrocannabinol.It was the kindest, gentlest riot control device in the arsenal.Any of the protesters with compromised lungs could still be in trouble, but within half an hour, all of them would be relaxed into near stupor and high as a kite.NNLPa and THC wasnt a combination Miller had ever used on Ceres.If theyd tried to stock it, it would have been stolen for office parties.He tried to take some comfort in the thought.As if it would make up for the lifetimes of dreams and labor he was taking away.Beside him, Diogo laughed.It took them three hours to make the primary sweep of the ship, and another five to hunt down all the stowaways huddled in ducts and secure rooms, waiting to make their presence known at the last minute and sabotage the mission.As those were hauled weeping off the ship, Miller wondered whether hed just saved their lives.If all hed done with his life was keep Fred Johnson from deciding whether to let a handful of innocent people die with the Nauvoo, or risk keeping Eros around for the inner planets, that wasnt so bad.As soon as Miller gave the word, the OPA tech team moved into action, reengaging the waldoes and transports, fixing the hundred small acts of sabotage that would have kept the Nauvoos engines from firing, clearing out equipment they wanted to save.Miller watched industrial lifts big enough to house a family of five shift crate after crate, moving out things that had only recently been moved it.The docks were as busy as Ceres at mid shift.Miller half expected to see his old cohorts wandering among the stevedores and lift tubes, keeping what passed for the peace.In the quiet moments, he set his hand terminal to the Eros feed.Back when hed been a kid, there had been a performance artist making the rounds Jila Sorormaya, her name was.As he recalled, shed intentionally corrupted data storage devices and then put the data stream through her music kit.Shed gotten into trouble when some of the proprietary code of the storage device software got incorporated into her music and posted.Miller hadnt been a sophisticate.Hed figured another nutcase artist had to get a real job, and the universe could only be a better place.Listening to the Eros feed Radio Free Eros, he called it he thought maybe hed been a little rough on old Jila.The squeaks and cross chatter, the flow of empty noise punctuated by voices, were eerie and compelling.Just like the broken data stream, it was the music of corruption.asciugare il pus e che possano sentirsi meglio   ja min nousivat kuolleista ja halventaa kohtalo pakottaa minut ja siskoni   do what you have to  Hed listened to the feed for hours, picking out voices.Once, the whole thing had fluttered, cutting in and out like a piece of equipment on the edge of failure.Only after it had resumed did Miller wonder if the stutters of quiet had been Morse code.He leaned against the bulkhead, the overwhelming mass of the Nauvoo towering above him.The ship only half born and already marked for sacrifice.Julie sat beside him, looking up.Her hair floated around her face; her eyes never stopped smiling.Whatever trick of the imagination had kept his own internal Juliette Andromeda Mao from coming back to him as her corpse, he thanked it.It would have been something, wouldnt it?she said.Flying through vacuum without a suit.Sleeping for a hundred years and waking up in the light of a different sun.I didnt shoot that fucker fast enough, Miller said aloud.He could have given us the stars.A new voice broke in.A human voice shaking with rage.Antichrist!Miller blinked, returning to reality, and thumbed off the Eros feed.A prisoner transport wound its lazy way through the dock, a dozen Mormon technicians bound to its restraint poles.One was a young man with a pocked face and hatred in his eyes.He was staring at Miller.Youre the Antichrist, you vile excuse for a human!God knows you!Hell remember you!Miller tipped his hat as the prisoners ambled by.Stars are better off without us, he said, but too softly for anyone but Julie to hear.* * *   A dozen tugs flew before the Nauvoo, the web of nanotubule tethers invisible at this distance.All Miller saw was the great behemoth, as much a part of Tycho Station as the bulkheads and air, shift in its bed, shrug, and begin to move.The tugs drive flares lit the interior space of the station, flickering in their perfectly choreographed duties like Christmas lights, and a nearly subliminal shudder passed through the deep steel bones of Tycho.In eight hours, the Nauvoo would be far enough out that the great engines could be brought online without endangering the station with their exhaust plume.It might be more than two weeks after that before it reached Eros.Miller would beat it there by eighty hours.Oi, Pampaw, Diogo said.Done done?Yeah, Miller said with a sigh.Im ready.Lets get everyone together.The boy grinned.In the hours since the commandeering of the Nauvoo, Diogo had added bright red plastic decorations to three of his front teeth.It was apparently deeply meaningful in the youth culture of Tycho Station, and signified prowess, possibly sexual.Miller felt a moments relief that he wasnt hot bunking at the boys place anymore.Now that he was running security ops for the OPA, the irregular nature of the group was clearer to him than ever.There had been a time when hed thought the OPA might be something that could take on Earth or Mars when it came to a real war.Certainly, they had more money and resources than hed thought.They had Fred Johnson.They had Ceres now, for as long as they could hold it.Theyd taken on Thoth Station and won.And yet the same kids hed gone on the assault with had been working crowd control at the Nauvoo, and more than half of them would be on the demolitions ship when it left for Eros.It was the thing that Havelock would never understand.For that matter, it was the thing Holden would never understand.Maybe no one who had lived with the certainty and support of a natural atmosphere would ever completely accept the power and fragility of a society based in doing what needed doing, in becoming fast and flexible, the way the OPA had.In becoming articulated.If Fred couldnt build himself a peace treaty, the OPA would never win against the discipline and unity of an inner planet navy.But they would also never lose.War without end.Well, what was history if not that?And how would having the stars change anything?As he walked to his apartment, he opened a channel request on his hand terminal.Fred Johnson appeared, looking tired but alert.Miller, he said.Were getting ready to ship out if the ordinance is ready.Its loading now, Fred replied.Enough fissionable material to keep the surface of Eros unapproachable for years.Be careful with it.If one of your boys goes down for a smoke in the wrong place, we arent going to be able to replace the mines.Not in time.Not youll all be dead.The weapons were precious, not the people.Yeah, Ill watch it, Miller said.The Rocinantes already on its way.That wasnt something Miller needed to know, so there was some other reason Fred had mentioned it.His carefully neutral tone made it something like an accusation.The only controlled sample of protomolecule had left Freds sphere of influence.Well get out there to meet her in plenty of time to keep anybody off of Eros, Miller said.Shouldnt be a problem.On the tiny screen, it was hard to tell how genuine Freds smile was.I hope your friends are really up for this, he said.Miller felt something odd.A little hollowness just below his breastbone.They arent my friends, he said, keeping his tone of voice light.No?I dont exactly have friends.Its more Ive got a lot of people I used to work with, he said.You put a lot of faith in Holden, Fred said, making it almost a question.A challenge, at least.Miller smiled, knowing that Fred would be just as unsure if his was genuine.Not faith.Judgment, he said.Fred coughed out a laugh.And thats why you dont have friends, friend.Part of it, Miller said.There was nothing more to say.Miller dropped the connection.He was almost at his hole, anyway.It was nothing much.An anonymous cube on the station with even less personality to it than his place back on Ceres.He sat on his bunk, checked his terminal for the status of the demolitions ship.He knew that he should just go up to the docks.Diogo and the others were assembling, and while it wasnt likely that the drug haze of the pre mission parties would allow them all to arrive on time, it was at least possible.He didnt even have that excuse.Julie sat in the space behind his eyes.Her legs were folded under her.She was beautiful.Shed been like Fred and Holden and Havelock.Someone born in a gravity well who came to the Belt by choice.Shed died for her choice.Shed come looking for help and killed Eros by doing it.If shed stayed there, on that ghost ship  She tilted her head, her hair swinging against the spin gravity.There was a question in her eyes.She was right, of course.It would have slowed things down, maybe.It wouldnt have stopped them.Protogen and Dresden would have found her eventually.Would have found it.Or gone back and dug up a fresh sample.Nothing would have stopped them.And he knew knew the way he knew he was himself that Julie wasnt like the others.That shed understood the Belt and Belters, and the need to push on.If not for the stars, at least close to them.The luxury available to her was something Miller had never experienced, and never would.But shed turned away.Shed come out here, and stayed even when they were going to sell her racing pinnace.Her childhood.Her pride.That was why he loved her.When Miller reached the dock, it was clear something had happened.It was in the way the dockworkers held themselves and the looks half amusement and half pleasure, on their faces.Miller signed in and crawled through the awkward Ojino Gouch style airlock, seventy years out of date and hardly larger than a torpedo tube, into the cramped crew area of the Talbot Leeds.The ship looked like it had been welded together from two smaller ships, without particular concern for design.The acceleration couches were stacked three deep.The air smelled of old sweat and hot metal.Someone had been smoking marijuana recently enough that the filters hadnt cleared it out yet.Diogo was there along with a half dozen others.They all wore different uniforms, but they also all had the OPA armband.Oi, Pampaw!Kept top bunk  dir.Thanks, Miller said.I appreciate that.Thirteen days.He was going to spend thirteen days sharing this tiny space with the demolitions crew.Thirteen days pressed into these couches, with megatons of fission mines in the ships hold.And yet the others were all smiling.Miller hauled himself up to the acceleration couch Diogo had saved for him, and pointed to the others with his chin.Someone have a birthday?Diogo gave an elaborate shrug.Whys everyone in such a good fucking mood?Miller said, more sharply than hed intended.Diogo took no offense.He smiled his great red and white teeth.Audi nichts?No, I havent heard, or I wouldnt be asking, Miller said.Mars did the right thing, Diogo said.Got the feed off Eros, put two and two, and   The boy slammed a fist into his open palm.Miller tried to parse what he was saying.Theyd attacked Eros?Theyd taken on Protogen?Ah.Protogen.Protogen and Mars.Miller nodded.The Phoebe science station, he said.Mars quarantined it.Fuck that, Pampaw.Autoclaved it, them.Moon is gone.Dropped enough nukes on it to split it subatomic.They better have, Miller thought.It wasnt a big moon.If Mars had really destroyed it and there was any protomolecule left on a hunk of ejecta  Tu sabez?Diogo said.Theyre on our side now.They get it.Mars OPA alliance.You dont really think that, Miller said.Nah, Diogo said, just as pleased with himself in admitting that the hope was fragile at best and probably false.But dont hurt to dream, que no?You dont think?Miller said, and lay back.The acceleration gel was too stiff to conform to his body at the docks one third g, but it wasnt uncomfortable.He checked the news on his hand terminal, and indeed someone in the Martian navy had made a judgment call.It was a lot of ordinance to use, especially in the middle of a shooting war, but theyd expended it.Saturn had one fewer moon, one more tiny, unformed, filamentous ring if there was even enough matter left from the detonations to form that.It looked to Millers unpracticed eye as if the explosions had been designed to drop debris into the protective and crushing gravity of the gas giant.It was foolish to think it meant the Martian government wouldnt want samples of the protomolecule.It was naive to pretend that any organization of that size and complexity was univocal about anything, much less something as dangerous and transforming as this.But still.Perhaps it was enough just knowing that someone on the other side of the political and military divide had seen the same evidence they had seen and drawn the same conclusions.Maybe it left room for hope.He switched his hand terminal back to the Eros feed.A strong throbbing sound danced below a cascade of noise.Voices rose and fell and rose again.Data streams spewed into one another, and the pattern recognition servers burned every spare cycle making something from the resultant mess.Julie took his hand, the dream so convincing he could almost pretend he felt it.You belong with me, she said.As soon as its over, he thought.It was true he kept pushing back the end point of the case.First find Julie, then avenge her, and now destroy the project that had claimed her life.But after that was accomplished, he could let go.He just had this one last thing he needed to do.Twenty minutes later, the Klaxon sounded.Thirty minutes later, the engines kicked on, pressing him into the acceleration gel at a joint crushing high g burn for thirteen days, with one g breaks for biological function every four hours.And when they were done, the half trained jack of all trades crew would be handling nuclear mines capable of annihilating them if they screwed it up.But at least Julie would be there.Not really, but still.It didnt hurt to dream.Even the wet cellulose taste of reconstituted artificial scrambled eggs was not enough to ruin Holdens warm, self satisfied glow.He shoveled the faux eggs into his mouth, trying not to grin.Sitting at his left around the galley table, Amos ate with lip smacking enthusiasm.To Holdens right, Alex pushed the limp eggs around on his plate with a piece of equally fake toast.Across the table, Naomi sipped a cup of tea and looked at him from under her hair.He stifled the urge to wink at her.Theyd talked about how to break the news to the crew but hadnt come to any consensus.Holden hated to hide anything.Keeping it secret made it seem dirty or shameful.His parents had raised him to believe that sex was something you did in private not because it was embarrassing, but because it was intimate.With five fathers and three mothers, the sleeping arrangements were always complex at his house, but the discussions about who was bedding with whom were never hidden from him.It left him with a strong aversion to hiding his own activities.Naomi, on the other hand, thought they shouldnt do anything to upset the fragile equilibrium theyd found, and Holden trusted her instincts.She had an insight into group dynamics that he often lacked.So, for now, he was following her lead.Besides, it would have felt like boasting, and that would have been rude.Keeping his voice neutral and professional, he said, Naomi, can you pass the pepper?Amos head snapped up, and he dropped his fork on the table with a loud clatter.Holy shit, you guys are doing it!Um, Holden said.What?Somethings been screwy ever since we got back on the Roci, but I couldnt figure.But thats it!You guys are finally playing hide the weasel.Holden blinked twice at the big mechanic, unsure of what to say.He glanced at Naomi for support, but her head was down, and her hair completely covered her face.Her shoulders were shaking in silent laughter.Jesus, Cap, Amos said, a grin on his wide face.It fucking took you long enough.If shed been throwing herself at me like that, Id have been neck deep in that shit.Uh, Alex said, looking shocked enough that it was clear he hadnt shared Amos insights.Wow.Naomi stopped laughing and wiped tears away from the corners of her eyes.Busted, she said.Look.Guys, its important that you know this doesnt affect our  Holden said, but Amos cut him off with a snort.Hey, Alex, Amos said.Yo, Alex replied.XO boning the captain going to make you a really shitty pilot?Dont believe it will, Alex said with a grin, exaggerating his drawl.And, oddly enough, I dont feel the need to be a lousy mechanic.Holden tried again.I think its important that   Capn?Amos continued, ignoring him.Consider that no one gives a fuck, it wont stop us from doing our jobs, and just enjoy it, since well probably all be dead in a few days anyway.Naomi started laughing again.Fine, she said.I mean, everyone knows Im only doing it to get a promotion.Oh, wait, right.Already the second in command.Hey, can I be captain now?No, Holden said, laughing.Its a shit job.Id never ask you to do it.Naomi grinned and shrugged.See?Im not always right.Holden glanced at Alex, who was looking at him with genuine affection, clearly happy about the idea of him and Naomi together.Everything seemed right.* * *   Eros spun like a potato shaped top, its thick skin of rock hiding the horrors inside.Alex brought them in close to do a thorough scan of the station.The asteroid swelled on Holdens screen until it looked close enough to touch.At the other ops station, Naomi swept the surface with ladar, looking for anything that might pose a danger to the Tycho freighter crews, still a few days behind.On Holdens tactical display, the UNN science ship continued to flare in a braking maneuver toward Eros, its escort right beside it.Still not talking, huh?Holden asked.Naomi shook her head, then tapped on her screen and sent the comms monitoring information to his workstation.Nope, she said.But they see us.Theyve been bouncing radar off of us for a couple hours now.Holden tapped his fingers on the arm of his chair and thought about the choices.It was possible that the hull modifications Tycho had made to the Roci were fooling the Earth corvettes recognition software.They might just ignore the Roci, thinking she was a Belter gas runner that happened to be hanging around.But the Roci was running without a transponder, which made her illegal no matter what hull configuration she was showing.That the corvette wasnt trying to warn off a ship that was running dark made him nervous.The Belt and the inner planets were in a shooting war.A Belter ship with no identification was hanging around Eros while two Earth ships flew toward it.No way any captain with half a brain would just ignore them.The corvettes silence meant something else.Naomi, I have a feeling that corvette is going to try and blow us up, Holden said with a sigh.Its what Id do, she replied.Holden tapped one last complicated rhythm on his chair, then put his headset on.All right, I guess I make the first overture, then, he said.Not wishing to make their conversation public, Holden targeted the Earther corvette with the Rocinantes laser array and signaled a generic linkup request.After a few seconds, the link established light went green, and his earplugs began to hiss with faint background static.Holden waited, but the UN ship offered no greeting.They wanted him to speak first.He flicked off his mic, switching to the shipwide comm.Alex, get us moving.One g for now.If I cant bluff this guy, itll be a shooting match.Be ready to open her up.Roger, drawled Alex.Goin on the juice, just in case.Holden glanced over at Naomis station, but shed already switched to her tactical screen and had the Roci plotting firing solutions and jamming tactics on the two approaching ships.Naomi had been in only one battle, but she was reacting now like a seasoned veteran.He smiled at her back, then turned around before she had time to realize he was staring.Amos?he said.Locked down and shipshape down here, Cap.The Rocis pawing at the turf.Lets go kick some ass.Lets hope we dont have to, Holden thought.He turned his mic back on.This is Captain James Holden of the Rocinante, calling the captain of the approaching United Nations Navy corvette, call sign unknown.Please respond.There was a static filled pause, followed by Rocinante.Leave our flight path immediately.If you do not begin moving away from Eros at best possible speed, you will be fired upon.The voice was young.An aging corvette with the tedious task of following an asteroid mapping ship around wouldnt be a much sought after command.The captain was probably a lieutenant without patrons or prospects.Hed be inexperienced, but he might see a confrontation as an opportunity to prove himself to his superiors.And that made the next few moments treacherous to navigate.Sorry, said Holden.Still dont know your call sign, or your name.But I cant do what you want.In fact, I cant let anyone land on Eros.Im going to need you to stop approaching the station.Rocinante, I dont think you   Holden took control of the Rocis targeting system and began painting the approaching corvette with its targeting laser.Let me explain whats happening here, he said.Right now, youre looking at your sensors, and youre seeing what looks like a thrown together gas freighter thats giving your ship recognition software fits.And all of a sudden, meaning right now, its painting you with a state of the art target acquisition system.We dont   Dont lie.I know thats whats happening.So heres the deal.Despite how it looks, my ship is newer, faster, tougher, and better armed than yours.The only way for me to really prove that is to open fire, and Im hoping not to do that.Are you threatening me, Rocinante?the young voice on Holdens headset said, its tone hitting just the right notes of arrogance and disbelief.You?No, said Holden.Im threatening the big, fat, slow moving, and unarmed ship youre supposed to be protecting.You keep flying toward Eros, and I will unload everything Ive got at it.I guarantee we will blow that flying science lab out of the sky.Now, its possible you might get us while we do it, but by then your mission is screwed anyway, right?The line went silent again, only the hiss of background radiation letting him know his headset hadnt died.When his answer came, it came on the shipwide comms.Alex said, Theyre stoppin, Captain.They just started hard brakin.Tracking says theyll be relative stopped about two million klicks out.Want me to keep flyin toward em?No, bring us back to our stationary position over Eros, Holden replied.Roger that.Naomi, Holden said, spinning his chair around to face her.Are they doing anything else?Not that I can see through the clutter of their exhaust.But they could be tightbeaming messages the other direction and wed never know, she said.Holden flipped the shipwide comm off.He scratched his head for a minute, then unbuckled his restraints.Well, we stopped them for now.Im going to hit the head and then grab a drink.Want anything?* * *   Hes not wrong, you know, Naomi said later that night.Holden was floating in zero g on the ops deck, his station a few feet away.Hed turned down the deck lights, and the cabin was as dim as a moonlit night.Alex and Amos were sleeping two decks below.They might as well have been a million light years away.Naomi was floating near her own station, two meters away, her hair unbound and drifting around her like a black cloud.The panel behind her lit her face in profile: the long forehead, flat nose, large lips.He could tell that her eyes were closed.He felt like they were the only two people in the universe.Whos not wrong?he said, just to be saying something.Miller, she replied as though it were obvious.I have no idea what youre talking about.Naomi laughed, then swatted with one hand to rotate her body and face him in the air.Her eyes were open now, though with the panel lights behind her, they were visible only as black pools in her face.Ive been thinking about Miller, she said.I treated him badly on Tycho.Ignored him because you were angry.I owed him better than that.Why?He saved your life on Eros.Holden snorted, but she kept going anyway.When you were in the navy, she finally said, what were you supposed to do when someone went crazy on the ship?Started doing things that endangered everyone?Thinking they were talking about Miller, Holden said, You restrain him and remove him as a danger to the ship and crew.But Fred didnt   Naomi cut him off.What if its wartime?she said.The middle of a battle?If he cant be easily restrained, the chief of the watch has an obligation to protect the ship and crew by whatever means necessary.Even shooting him?If thats the only way to do it, Holden replied.Sure.But it would only be in the most pressing circumstances.Naomi nodded with her hand, sending her body slowly twisting the other way.She stopped her motion with one unconscious gesture.Holden was pretty good in zero g, but hed never be that good.The Belt is a network, Naomi said.Its like one big distributed ship.We have nodes that make air, or water, or power, or structural materials.Those nodes may be separated by millions of kilometers of space, but that doesnt make them any less interconnected.I see where this is going, Holden said with a sigh.Dresden was a madman on the ship, Miller shot him to protect the rest of us.He gave me that speech back on Tycho.Didnt buy it then either.Why?Because, Holden said.Dresden wasnt an immediate threat.He was just an evil little man in an expensive suit.He didnt have a gun in his hand, or his finger on a bomb trigger.And I will never trust a man who believes he has the right to unilaterally execute people.Holden put his foot against the bulkhead and tapped off just hard enough to float a few feet closer to Naomi, close enough to see her eyes, read her reaction to him.If that science ship starts flying toward Eros again, I will throw every torpedo we have at it, and tell myself I was protecting the rest of the solar system from whats on Eros.But I wont just start shooting at it now, on the idea that it might decide to head to Eros again, because thats murder.What Miller did was murder.Naomi smiled at him, then grabbed his flight suit and pulled him close enough for a kiss.You might be the best person I know.But youre totally uncompromising on what you think is right, and thats what you hate about Miller.I do?Yes, she said.Hes totally uncompromising too, but he has different ideas on how things work.You hate that.To Miller, Dresden was an active threat to the ship.Every second he stayed alive endangered everyone else around him.To Miller, it was self defense.But hes wrong.The man was helpless.The man talked the UN Navy into giving his company state of the art ships, she said.He talked his company into murdering a million and a half people.Everything Miller said about why the protomolecule is better off with us was just as true about Dresden.How long is he in an OPA lockup before he finds the jailer who can be bought?He was a prisoner, Holden said, feeing the argument slipping away from him.He was a monster with power, access, and allies who would have paid any price to keep his science project going, Naomi said.And Im telling you as a Belter, Miller wasnt wrong.Holden didnt answer; he just continued to float next to Naomi, keeping himself in her orbit.Was he angrier about the killing of Dresden or about Millers making a decision that disagreed with him?And Miller had known.When Holden had told him to find his own ride back to Tycho, hed seen it in the detectives sad basset hound face.Miller had known it was coming, and had made no attempt to fight or argue.That meant that Miller had made his choice fully cognizant of the cost and ready to pay it.That meant something.Holden wasnt sure exactly what, but something.A red telltale began flashing on the wall, and Naomis panel woke up and began throwing data onto the screen.She pulled herself down to it using the back of her chair, then tapped out several quick commands.Shit, she said.What is it?The corvette or science ship must have called for help, Naomi said, pointing at her screen.Weve got ships on their way from all over the system.How many are coming?Holden asked, trying to get a better look at her screen.Naomi made a small sound in the back of her throat, halfway between a chuckle and a cough.At a guess?All of them.You are, and you arent, the Eros feed said through a semi random drumming of static.You are, and you arent.You are, and you arent.The little ship shuddered and bumped.From a crash couch, one of the OPA techs called out a string of obscenities remarkable more for inventiveness than actual rancor.Miller closed his eyes, trying to keep the micro g adjustments of their nonstandard docking from nauseating him.After days of joint aching acceleration and an equally bruising braking routine, the small shifts and movements felt arbitrary and strange.You are, are, are, are, are, are, are   Hed spent some time listening to the newsfeeds.Three days after theyd left Tycho, the news of Protogens involvement with Eros broke.Amazingly, Holden hadnt been the one to do it.Since then, the corporation had gone from total denial, to blaming a rogue subcontractor, to claiming immunity under an Earth defense secrets statute.It didnt sound good for them.Earths blockade of Mars was still in place, but attention had shifted to the power struggle within Earth, and the Martian navy had slowed its burn, giving the Earth forces a little more breathing room before any permanent decisions had to be made.It looked like theyd postponed Armageddon for a few weeks, anyway.Miller found he could take a certain joy in that.It also left him tired.More often, he listened to the voice of Eros.Sometimes he watched the video feeds too, but usually, he just listened.Over the hours and days, he began to hear, if not patterns, at least common structures.Some of the voices spooling out of the dying station were consistent broadcasters and entertainers who were overrepresented in the audio files archives, he guessed.There seemed to be some specific tendencies in, for want of a better term, the music of it too.Hours of random, fluting static and snatched bits of phrases would give way, and Eros would latch on to some word or phrase, fixating on it with greater and greater intensity until it broke apart and the randomness poured back in.are, are, are, ARE, ARE, ARE   Arent, Miller thought, and the ship suddenly shoved itself up, leaving Millers stomach about half a foot from where it had been.A series of loud clanks followed, and then the brief wail of a Klaxon.Dieu!Dieu!someone shouted.Bombs son vamen roja!Going to fry it!Fry us toda!There was the usual polite chuckle that the same joke had occasioned over the course of the trip, and the boy whod made it a pimply Belter no more than fifteen years old grinned with pleasure at his own wit.If he didnt stop that shit, someone was going to beat him with a crowbar before they got back to Tycho.But Miller figured that someone wasnt him.A massive jolt forward pushed him hard into the couch, and then gravity was back, the familiar 0.3 g.  Maybe a little more.Except that with the airlocks pointing toward ships down, the pilot had to grapple the spinning skin of Eros belly first.The spin gravity made what had been the ceiling the new floor; the lowest rank of couches was now the top; and while they rigged the fusion bombs to the docks, they were all going to have to climb up onto a cold, dark rock that was trying to fling them off into the vacuum.Such were the joys of sabotage.Miller suited up.After the military grade suits of the Rocinante, the OPAs motley assortment of equipment felt like third hand clothes.His suit smelled of someone elses body, and the Mylar faceplate had a deformation where it had cracked and been repaired.He didnt like thinking about what had happened to the poor bastard whod been wearing it.The magnetic boots had a thick layer of corroded plastic and old mud between the plates and a triggering mechanism so old that Miller could feel it click on and off even before he moved his foot.He had the image of the suit locking on to Eros and never letting go.The thought made him smile.You belong with me, his own private Julie had said.It was true, and now that he was here, he felt perfectly certain that he wasnt going to leave.Hed been a cop for too long, and the idea of trying to reconnect to humanity again filled him with the presentiment of exhaustion.He was here to do the last part of his job.And then he was done.Oi!Pampaw!Im coming, Miller said.Hold your damn horses.Its not like the stations going anyplace.A rainbow is a circle you cant see.Cant see.Cant see, Eros said in a childs singsong voice.Miller turned down the volume of his feed.The rocky surface of the station had no particular purchase for the suits and control waldoes.Two other ships had made polar landings where there was no spin gravity to fight against, but the Coriolis would leave everyone with a subliminal nausea.Millers team had to keep to the exposed metal plates of the dock, clinging like flies looking down into the starlit abyss.Engineering the placement of the fusion bombs wasnt trivial work.If the bombs didnt pump enough energy into the station, the surface might cool enough to give someone another chance to put a science team on it before the penumbra of the sun swallowed it and whatever parts of the Nauvoo were still clinging to it.Even with the best minds of Tycho, there was still the chance that the detonations wouldnt sync up.If the pressure waves traveling through the rock amplified in ways they hadnt anticipated, the station could crack open like an egg, spreading the protomolecule through the wide, empty track of the solar system like scattering a handful of dust.But the difference between success and disaster might be literally a question of meters.Miller crawled up the airlock and out to the station surface.The first wave of technicians were setting up resonance seismographs, the glow of the work lights and readouts the brightest thing in the universe.Miller set his boots on a wide swath of a ceramic steel alloy and let the spin stretch the kinks out of his back.After days in the acceleration couch, the freedom felt euphoric.One of the techs raised her hands, the physical Belter idiom that called for attention.Miller upped the suit volume.insectes rampant sur ma peau   With a stab of impatience, he switched from the Eros feed to the team channel.Got to move, a womans voice said.Too much splashback here.We have to get to the other side of the docks.These go on for almost two kilometers, Miller said.Is, she agreed.We can unmoor and move the ship under power or we can tow it.Weve got enough lead line.Which ones fastest?We dont have a lot of spare time here.Towing.Tow it, then, Miller said.Slowly, the ship rose, twenty small, crawling transport drones clinging to leads like they were hauling a great metallic zeppelin.The ship was going to stay with him, here on the station, strapped to the rock like a sacrifice to the gods.Miller walked with the crew as they crossed the wide, closed bay doors.The only sounds were the tapping of his soles as the electromagnets jolted onto the surface and then a tick when they let go again.The only smells were of his own body and the fresh plastic of the air recycler.The metal under his feet shone like someone had cleaned it.Any dust or pebbles had been hurled away long ago.They worked fast to place the ship, arm the bombs, and fit the security codes, everyone tacitly aware of the great missile that had been the Nauvoo speeding toward them.If another ship came down and tried to disarm the trap, the ship would send synchronizing signals to all the other OPA bomb ships studding the moons surface.Three seconds later, the surface of Eros would be scrubbed clean.The spare air and supplies were loaded off the ship, bundled together and ready for reclamation.No reason to waste the resources.Nothing horrific crawled out of an airlock and tried to attack the crew, which made Millers presence during the mission entirely superfluous.Or maybe not.Maybe it was just a ride.When everything was done that could be, Miller sent the all clear, relayed through the now dead ships system.The return transport appeared slowly, a dot of light that grew gradually brighter and then spread, the null g boarding web strung out like scaffolding.At the new ships word, Millers team turned off their boots and fired simple maneuvering thrusters either from their suits or, if the suits were too old, from shared ablative evacuation shells.Miller watched them drop away.Call va and roll, Pampaw, Diogo said from someplace.Miller wasnt sure which of them he was at this distance.This tube dont sit.Im not coming, Miller said.Sa que?I decided.Im staying here.There was a moment of silence.Miller had been waiting for this.He had the security codes.If he needed to crawl back into the shell of their old ship and lock the door behind him, he could.But he didnt want to.Hed prepared his arguments: He would only be going back to Tycho as a political pawn for Fred Johnsons negotiations; he was tired and old in a way that years didnt describe; hed already died on Eros once, and he wanted to be here to finish it.Hed earned that much.Diogo and the others owed it to him.He waited for the boy to react, to try to talk him out of it.All correct, then, Diogo said.Buona morte.Buona morte, Miller said, and shut off his radio.The universe was silent.The stars below him shifted slowly but perceptibly as the station he hung from spun.One of those lights was the Rocinante.Two others were the ships Holden had been sent out to stall.Miller couldnt pick them out.Julie floated beside him, her dark hair floating in the vacuum, the stars shining through her.She looked peaceful.If you had it to do again, she said.If you could do it all over from the beginning?I wouldnt, he said.He watched the OPA transport ship start up its engines, glowing gold and white, and pull away until it was a star again.A small one.And then lost.Miller turned and considered the dark, empty moonscape and the permanent night.He just needed to be with her for another few hours, and they would both be safe.They would all be safe.It was enough.Miller found himself smiling and weeping, the tears tracking up from his eyes and into his hair.Its going to be fine, Julie said.I know, Miller said.He stood silently for almost an hour, then turned and made his slow, precarious way back to the sacrificed ship, down the airlock, and into the dim belly.There was enough residual atmosphere that he didnt need to sleep in his suit.He stripped naked, chose an acceleration couch, and curled up on the hard blue gel.Not twenty meters away, five fusion devices powerful enough to outshine the sun waited for a signal.Above him, everything that had once been human in Eros Station changed and re formed, pouring from one shape to another like Hieronymous Bosch made real.And still almost a day away, the Nauvoo, the hammer of God, hurtled toward him.Miller set his suit to play some old pop tunes hed enjoyed when he was young and let himself be sung to sleep.When he dreamed, he dreamed hed found a tunnel at the back of his old hole on Ceres that meant he would at last, at last, be free.* * *   His last breakfast was a hard kibble bar and a handful of chocolate scrounged from a forgotten survival pack.He ate it with tepid recycled water that tasted of iron and rot.The signals from Eros were almost drowned by the oscillating frequencies blasting out from the station above him, but Miller made out enough to know where things stood.Holden had won, much as Miller had expected him to.The OPA was responding to a thousand angry accusations from Earth and Mars and, in the true and permanent style, factions within the OPA itself.It was too late.The Nauvoo was due in hours now.The end was coming.Miller put on his suit for the last time, turned out the lights, and crawled back up the airlock.For a long moment, the exterior release didnt respond, the safety lights glowing red, and he had a stab of fear that he would spend his last moments there, trapped in a tube like a torpedo ready to fire.But he cycled the locks power, and it opened.The Eros feed was wordless now, with only a soft murmuring like water over stone.Miller walked out across the wide mouth of the docking bays.The sky above him turned, and the Nauvoo rose from the horizon like sun.His splayed hand held at full arms length wasnt big enough to cover the glow of its engines.He hung by his boots, watching the ship approach.The phantom Julie watched with him.If hed done the math right, the Nauvoos impact site would be at the center of Eros major axis.Miller would be able to see it when it happened, and the giddy excitement in his chest reminded him of being young.It would be a show.Oh, it would be something to see.He considered recording it.His suit would be able to make a simple visual file and stream the data out in real time.But no.This was his moment.His and Julies.The rest of humanity could guess what it had been like if they cared.The massive glow of the Nauvoo filled a quarter of the sky now, and the full circle of it was free of the horizon.The Eros feeds soft murmur shifted to something more clearly synthetic: a rising, spiraling sound that reminded him for no particular reason of the green sweeping radar screens of ancient films.There were voices at the back of it, but he couldnt make out the words or even the language.The great torch of the Nauvoo was a full half of the sky, the stars around it blotted out by the light of full burn.Millers suit chirped a radiation warning and he shut it off.A manned Nauvoo would never have sustained a burn like that; even in the best couch, the thrust gravity would have pulped bones.He tried to guess how fast the ship would be going when it hit.Fast enough.That was all that mattered.Fast enough.There, in the center of the fiery bloom, Miller saw a dark spot, no more than the dot of a pencils tip.The ship itself.He took a deep breath.When he closed his eyes, the light pressed red through his lids.When he opened them again, the Nauvoo had length.Shape.It was a needle, an arrow, a missile.A fist rising from the depths.For the first time in memory, Miller felt awe.Eros shouted.DONT YOU FUCKING TOUCH ME!Slowly, the bloom of engine fire changed from a circle to an oval to a great feathery plume, the Nauvoo itself showing silver in rough profile.Miller gaped.The Nauvoo had missed.It had turned.It was right now, right now, speeding past Eros and not into it.But he hadnt seen any kind of maneuvering rockets fire.And how would you turn something that big, moving that quickly, so abruptly that it would veer off between one breath and the next without also tearing the ship apart?The acceleration g alone  Miller looked at the stars as if there was some answer written in them.And to his surprise, there was.The sweep of the Milky Way, the infinite scattering of stars were still there.But the angles had changed.The rotation of Eros had shifted.Its relation to the plane of the ecliptic.For the Nauvoo to change course at the last minute without falling apart would have been impossible.And so it hadnt happened.Eros was roughly six hundred cubic kilometers.Before Protogen, it had housed the second largest active port in the Belt.And without so much as overcoming the grip of Millers magnetic boots, Eros Station had dodged.Holy shit, said Amos in a flat voice.Jim, Naomi said to Holdens back, but he waved her off and opened a channel to Alex in the cockpit.Alex, did we just see what my sensors say we saw?Yeah, Cap, the pilot replied.Radar and scopes are both sayin Eros jumped two hundred klicks spinward in a little less than a minute.Holy shit, Amos repeated in exactly the same emotionless tone.The metallic bang of deck hatches opening and closing echoed through the ship, signaling Amos approach up the crew ladder.Holden shook off the flush of irritation he felt at Amos leaving his post.Hed deal with that later.He needed to be sure that the Rocinante and her crew hadnt just experienced a group hallucination.Naomi, give me comms, he said.Naomi turned around in her chair to face him, her face ashen.How can you be so calm?she asked.Panic wont help.We need to know whats going on before we can plan intelligently.Please transfer the comms to me.Holy shit, Amos said as he climbed into the ops deck.The deck hatch shut with a punctuating bang.I dont remember ordering you to leave your post, sailor, Holden said.Plan intelligently, Naomi said like they were words in a foreign language that she almost understood.Plan intelligently.Amos threw himself at a chair hard enough that the cushioning gel grabbed him and kept him from bouncing off.Eros is really fucking big, Amos said.Plan intelligently, Naomi repeated, speaking to herself now.I mean, really fucking big, Amos said.Do you know how much energy it took to spin that rock up?I mean, it took years to do that shit.Holden put his headset on to drown Amos and Naomi out, and called up Alex again.Alex, is Eros still changing velocity?No, Cap.Just sitting there like a rock.Okay, Holden said.Amos and Naomi are vapor locked.How are you doing?Not taking my hands off the stick while that bastard is anywhere in my space, thats for damn sure.Thank God for military training, Holden thought.Good, keep us at a constant distance of five thousand klicks until I say otherwise.Let me know if it moves again, even an inch.Roger that, Cap, said Alex.Holden took off his headset and turned to face the rest of the crew.Amos was looking at the ceiling, ticking points off with his fingers, his eyes unfocused.dont really remember the mass of Eros off the top of my head  he was saying to no one in particular.About seven thousand trillion kilos, Naomi replied.Give or take.And the heat signatures up about two degrees.Jesus, the mechanic said.I cant do that math in my head.That much mass coming up two degrees like that?A lot, Holden said.So lets move on   About ten exajoules, Naomi said.Thats just off the top of my head, but Im not off by an order of magnitude or anything.Amos whistled.Ten exajoules is like, what, a two gigaton fusion bomb?Its about a hundred kilos converted directly to energy, Naomi said.Her voice began to steady.Which, of course, we couldnt do.But at least whatever they did wasnt magic.Holdens mind grabbed on to her words with an almost physical sensation.Naomi was, in fact, about the smartest person he knew.She had just spoken directly to the half articulated fear hed been harboring since Eros had jumped sideways: that this was magic, that the protomolecule didnt have to obey the laws of physics.Because if that was true, humans didnt stand a chance.Explain, he said.Well, she replied, tapping on her keypad.Heating Eros up didnt move it.So I assume that means it was waste heat from whatever it was they actually did.And that means?That entropy still exists.That they cant convert mass to energy with perfect efficiency.That their machines or processes or whatever they use to move seven thousand trillion tons of rock wastes some energy.About a two gigaton bombs worth of it.Ah.You couldnt move Eros two hundred kilometers with a two gigaton bomb, Amos said with a snort.No, you couldnt, Naomi replied.This is just the leftovers.Heat by product.Their efficiency is still off the charts, but it isnt perfect.Which means the laws of physics still hold.Which means it isnt magic.Might as well be, Amos said.Naomi looked at Holden.So, we  he started when Alex interrupted over the shipwide comm.Cap, Eros is movin again.Follow it, get me a course and speed as soon as you can, Holden said, turning back to his console.Amos, get back down to engineering.If you leave it again without a direct order, Ill have the XO beat you to death with a pipe wrench.The only reply was the hiss of the deck hatch opening and the bang as it closed behind the descending mechanic.Alex, Holden said, staring at the data stream the Rocinante was feeding him about Eros.Tell me something.Sunward is all we know for sure, Alex replied, his voice still calm and professional.When Holden had been in the military, hed been officer track right from the start.Hed never been to military pilot school, but he knew that years of training had compartmentalized Alexs brain into two halves: piloting problems and, secondarily, everything else.Matching Eros and getting a course for it was the former.Extra solar space aliens trying to destroy humanity wasnt a piloting issue and could be safely ignored until he left the cockpit.He might have a nervous breakdown afterward, but until then, Alex would keep doing his job.Drop back to fifty thousand klicks and maintain a constant distance, Holden told him.Huh, said Alex.Maintainin a constant distance might be tough, Cap.Eros just disappeared off the radar.Holden felt his throat go tight.Say again?Eros just disappeared off the radar, Alex was saying, but Holden was already punching up the sensor suite to check for himself.His telescopes showed the rock still moving on its new course toward the sun.Thermal imaging showed it as slightly warmer than space.The weird feed of voices and madness that had been leaking out of the station was still detectable, if faint.But radar said there was nothing there.Magic, a small voice at the back of his mind said again.No, not magic.Humans had stealth ships too.It was just a matter of absorbing the radars energy rather than reflecting it.But suddenly, keeping the asteroid in visual range became all the more important.Eros had shown that it could move fast and maneuver wildly, and it was now invisible to radar.It was entirely possible that a mountain sized rock could disappear completely.Gravity began to pile up as the Roci chased Eros toward the sun.Naomi?She looked up at him.The fear was still in her eyes, but she was holding it together.For now.Jim?The comm?Could you?The chagrin on her face was the most reassuring thing hed seen in hours.She shifted control to his station, and he opened a connection request.UNN corvette, this is the Rocinante, please respond.Go ahead, Rocinante, the other ship said after half a minute of static.Calling to confirm our sensor data, Holden said, then transmitted the data regarding Eros movement.You guys seeing the same thing?Another delay, this one longer.Roger that, Rocinante.I know we were just about to shoot each other and all, but I think were a little past that now, Holden said.Anyway, were chasing the rock.If we lose sight of it, we might never find it again.Want to come with?Might be nice to have some backup if it decides to shoot at us or something.Another delay, this one almost two minutes long; then a different voice came on the line.Older, female, and totally lacking the arrogance and anger of the young male voice hed been dealing with so far.Rocinante, this is Captain McBride of the UNN Escort Vessel Ravi.Ah, thought Holden.Ive been talking to the first officer all along.The captain finally took the horn.That might be a good sign.Ive sent word to fleet command, but its a twenty three minute lag right now, and that rocks putting on speed.You have a plan?Not really, Ravi.Just follow and gather intel until we find an opportunity to do something that makes a difference.But if you came along, maybe none of your people will shoot at us accidentally while we figure it out.There was a long pause.Holden knew that the captain of the Ravi was weighing the chance that he was telling the truth against the threat hed made against their science vessel.What if he was in on whatever was happening?Hed be wondering the same thing in their position.Look, he said.Ive told you my name.James Holden.I served as a lieutenant in the UNN.My records should be on file.Itll show a dishonorable discharge, but theyll also show that my family lives in Montana.I dont want that rock to hit Earth any more than you do.The silence on the other end continued for another few minutes.Captain, she said, I believe my superiors would want me to keep an eye on you.Well be coming along for the ride while the brains figure this out.Holden let out a long, noisy exhale.Thanks for that, McBride.Keep trying to get your people on the line.Im going to make a few calls myself.Two corvettes are not going to fix this problem.Roger that, the Ravi replied, then killed the connection.Ive opened a connection with Tycho, Naomi said.Holden leaned back in his chair, the mounting gravity of their acceleration pressing against him.A watery lump was gathering low in his gut, the loose knot telling him that he had no idea what he was doing, that all the best plans had failed, and that the end was near.The brief hope hed felt was already starting to slip away.How can you be so calm?I think Im watching the end of the human race, Holden thought.Im calling Fred so that it isnt my fault when no one has an idea how to stop it.Of course Im not calm.Im just spreading the guilt.* * *   How fast?Fred Johnson asked incredulously.Four gs now and climbing, Holden replied, his voice thick as his throat compressed.Oh, and its invisible to radar now.Four g.  Do you know how heavy Eros is?Theres, uh, been some discussion, Holden said, only the acceleration keeping his impatience from showing in his voice.The question is, now what?The Nauvoo missed.Our plans are shot to shit.There was another perceptible increase in pressure as Alex sped the ship up to keep up with Eros.A little while longer and speech wouldnt be possible.Its definitely headed for Earth?Fred asked.Alex and Naomi are ninety percent or so.Hard to be totally accurate when we can only use visual data.But I trust them.Id go to where there are thirty billion new hosts too.Thirty billion new hosts.Eight of whom were his parents.He imagined Father Tom as a bundle of tubes oozing brown goo.Mother Elise as a rib cage dragging itself across the floor with one skeletal arm.And with that much biomass, what could it do then?Move Earth?Turn out the sun?Have to warn them, Holden said, trying not to strangle on his own tongue as he spoke.You dont think they know?They see a threat.They may not see the end of all native life in the solar system, Holden said.You wanted a reason to sit at the table?How about this one: Come together or die.Fred was quiet for a moment.Background radiation spoke to Holden in mystic whispers full of dire portents while he waited.Newcomer, it said.Hang around for fourteen billion years or so.See what Ive seen.Then all this nonsense wont seem so important.Ill see what I can do, Fred said, interrupting the universes lecture on transience.In the meantime, what are you going to do?Get outrun by a rock and then watch the cradle of humanity die.Im open to suggestions, Holden said.Maybe you could detonate some of the surface nukes the demo team put down.Deflect Eros course.Buy us time.Theyre on proximity fuses.Cant set them off, Holden said, the last word turning into a yelp as his chair stabbed him in a dozen different places and injected him full of fire.Alex had hit them with the juice, which meant Eros was still speeding up, and he was worried theyd all black out.How fast was it going to go?Even on the juice they couldnt sustain prolonged acceleration past seven or eight g without serious risk.If Eros kept this rate of increase up, it would outrun them.You can remote detonate, Fred said.Miller will have the codes.Have the demo team calculate which ones to set off for maximum effect.Roger that, Holden said.Ill give Miller a call.Ill work on the inners, Fred said, using the Belter slang without a hint of self consciousness.See what I can do.Holden broke the connection, then linked up to Millers ship.Yo, said whoever was manning the radio there.This is Holden, on the Rocinante.Give me Miller.Uh  said the voice.Okay.There was a click, then static, then Miller saying hello with a faint echo.Still wearing his helmet, then.Miller, this is Holden.We need to talk about what just happened.Eros moved.Miller sounded strange, his voice distant, as though he was only barely paying attention to the conversation.Holden felt a flush of irritation but tamped it back down.He needed Miller right now, whether he wanted to or not.Look, he said.Ive talked to Fred and he wants us to coordinate with your demo guys.Youve got remote codes.If we set off all of them on one side, we can deflect its course.Get your techs on the line, and well work it out.Huh, yeah, that sounds like a good idea.Ill send the codes along, said Miller, his voice no longer distant, but holding back a laugh.Like a man about to tell the punch line of a really good joke.But I cant really help you with the techs.Shit, Miller, you pissed those people off, too?Miller did laugh now, a free, soft sound that someone who wasnt piling on g could afford.If there was a punch line, Holden had missed it.Yeah, Miller said.Probably.But thats not why I cant get them for you.Im not on the ship with them.What?Im still on Eros.What do you mean youre on Eros?Holden said.Pretty much that, Miller said, covering his growing sense of shame with a casual tone of voice.Hanging upside down outside the tertiary docks, where we moored one of the ships.Feel like a freaking bat.But   Funny thing, too.I didnt feel it when the thing moved.Youd think accelerating like that, it would have thrown me off or squashed me flat, one or the other.But there was nothing.Okay, hold on.Were coming to get you.Holden, Miller said.Just stop it, all right?The silence didnt last more than a dozen seconds, but it carried a wealth of meaning.Its not safe to bring the Rocinante to Eros, and I came here to die, and Dont make this harder than it is.Yeah, I just  Holden said.And then: Okay.Let me let me coordinate with the technicians.Ill Jesus.Ill let you know what they say.One thing, though, Miller said.Youre talking about deflecting this sonofabitch?Just keep in mind its not a rock anymore.Its a ship.Right, Holden said.And a moment later: Okay.The connection dropped with a tick.Miller checked his oxygen supply.Three hours in suit, but he could head back to his little ship and refill it well before that.So Eros was moving, was it?He still didnt feel it, but watching the curved surface of the asteroid, he could see micro asteroids, all coming from the same direction, bouncing off.If the station kept accelerating, theyd start coming more often, more powerfully.Hed need to stay in the ship.He turned his hand terminal back to the Eros feed.The station beneath him was chirping and muttering, long slow vowel sounds radiating out from it like recorded whale song.After the angry words and static, the voice of Eros sounded peaceful.He wondered what kind of music Diogos friends would be making out of this.Slow dancing didnt seem like their style.An annoying itch settled in the small of his back, and he shifted in his suit, trying to rub it away.Almost without his noticing it, he grinned.And then laughed.A wave of euphoria passed into him.There was alien life in the universe, and he was riding on it like a tick on a dog.Eros Station had moved of its own free will and by mechanisms he couldnt begin to imagine.He didnt know how many years it had been since hed been overwhelmed by awe.Hed forgotten the feeling.He raised his arms to his sides, reaching out as if he could embrace the endless dark vacuum below him.Then, with a sigh, he turned back toward the ship.Back in the protective shell, he took off the vac suit and hooked the air supply to the recyclers to charge up.With only one person to care for, even low level life support would have it ready to go within the hour.The ship batteries were still almost fully charged.His hand terminal chimed twice, reminding him that it was once again time for the anti cancer meds.The ones hed earned the last time hed been on Eros.The ones hed be on for the rest of his life.Good joke.The fusion bombs were in the ships cargo hold: gray square boxes about half again as long as they were tall, like bricks in a mortar of pink adhesive foam.It took Miller twenty minutes of searching through storage lockers to find a can of solvent that still had charge in it.The thin spray from it smelled like ozone and oil, and the stiff pink foam melted under it.Miller squatted beside the bombs and ate a ration bar that tasted convincingly like apples.Julie sat beside him, her head resting weightlessly on his shoulder.There had been a few times that Miller had flirted with faith.Most had been when he was young and trying out everything.Then when he was older, wiser, more worn, and in the crushing pain of the divorce.He understood the longing for a greater being, a huge and compassionate intelligence that could see everything from a perspective that dissolved the pettiness and evil and made everything all right.He still felt that longing.He just couldnt convince himself it was true.And still, maybe there was something like a plan.Maybe the universe had put him in the right place at the right time to do the thing that no one else would do.Maybe all the pain and suffering hed been through, all the disappointments and soul crushing years wallowing through the worst that humanity had to offer up, had been meant to bring him here, to this moment, when he was ready to die if it bought humanity a little time.It would be pretty to think so, Julie said in his mind.It would, he agreed with a sigh.At the sound of his voice, the vision of her vanished, just another daydream.The bombs were heavier than hed remembered.Under a full g, he wouldnt have been able to move them.At only one third, it was a struggle, but possible.An agonizing centimeter at a time, he dragged one of them onto a handcart and hauled it to the airlock.Eros, above him, sang to itself.He had to rest before he tackled the hard work.The airlock was thin enough that only the bomb or he could fit through at a time.He climbed on top of it to get out the outer airlock door, then had to lift the bomb out with straps he rigged from cargo netting.And once out, it had to be tethered to the ship with magnetic clamps to keep Eros spin from slinging it out into the void.After hed pulled it out and strapped it to the cart, he stopped to rest for half an hour.There were more impacts now, a rough sign that Eros was indeed accelerating.Each one a rifle shot, capable of bouncing clean through him or the ship behind him if bad luck sent it in the right direction.But the odds were low of one of the occasional rocks lining up a killing shot with his tiny antlike figure crawling across the surface.Once Eros cleared the Belt, theyd stop, anyway.Was Eros leaving the Belt?He realized he had no idea where Eros was going.Hed assumed it was Earth.Holden would know by now, probably.His shoulders ached a little from his efforts, but not badly.He worried that hed overloaded the cart.Its wheels were stronger than his mag boots, but they could still be overcome.The asteroid above him lurched once, a new and unsettling motion that didnt repeat.His hand terminal cut off the Eros feed, alerting him that he had an incoming connection.He looked at it, shrugged, and let the call come through.Naomi, he said before she could speak.Howve you been doing?Hey, she said.The silence between them stretched.You talked to Holden, then?I did, she said.Hes still talking about ways to get you off that thing.Hes a good guy, Miller said.Talk him out of it for me, okay?The silence hung long enough that Miller started to get uncomfortable.What are you doing there?she asked.As if there were an answer for that.As if all his life could be summarized in answer to one simple question.He danced around what she meant and replied only to what shed said.Well, Ive got a nuclear bomb strapped to a cargo wagon.Im hauling it over to the access hatch and taking it into station.Miller   The thing is, we were treating this like a rock.Now everyone knows thats a little simplistic, but its going to take people time to adjust.Navies are still going to be thinking of this thing like a billiard ball when its really a rat.He was talking too fast.The words spilling out of him in a rush.If he didnt give her room, she wouldnt talk.He wouldnt have to hear what she had to say.He wouldnt have to keep her from talking him down.Its going to have structure.Engines or control centers.Something.If I truck this thing inside, get it close to whatever coordinates the thing, I can break it.Turn it back into a billiard ball.Even if its just for a little while, that gives the rest of you a chance.I figured, she said.It makes sense.Its the right thing to do.Miller chuckled.A particularly solid impact tocked against the ship beneath him, the vibration of it jarring his bones.Gas started venting out of the new hole.The station was moving faster.Yeah, he said.Well.I was talking to Amos, she said.You need a dead mans switch.So that if something happens, the bomb still goes off.If you have the access codes?I do.Good.Ive got a routine you can put on your hand terminal.Youll need to keep your finger on the select button.If you go away for five seconds, it sends the go signal.If you want, I can upload it to you.So I have to wander around the station with my finger mashed on a button?Naomis tone made it an apology.They might take you out with a head shot.Or wrestle you down.The longer the gap, the more chance for the protomolecule to disable the bomb before it goes off.If you need more, I can reprogram it.Miller looked at the bomb resting on its cart just outside the ships airlock.Its readouts all glowed green and gold.His sigh briefly fogged the inside of his helmet.Yeah, no.Five is good.Upload the routine.Am I going to need to tweak it, or is there a simple place I can put the arm and fire string?Theres a setup section, Naomi said.It prompts you.The hand terminal chirped, announcing the new file.Miller accepted it, ran it.It was easy as keying in a door code.Somehow he felt that arming fusion bombs to detonate around him should have been more difficult.Got it, he said.Were good to go.I mean, I still have to move this bastard, but other than that.How fast am I accelerating on this thing, anyway?Eventually it will be faster than the Roci can go.Four g and ramping up with no sign of easing off the throttle.Cant feel it at all, he said.Im sorry about before, Naomi said.It was a bad situation.We did what we had to do.Same as always.Same as always, she echoed.They didnt speak for a few seconds.Thanks for the trigger, Miller said.Tell Amos I appreciate it.He cut the connection before she could answer.Long goodbyes werent anyones strong suit.The bomb rested in the handcart, magnetic clamps in place and a wide woven steel belt around the whole mess.He moved slowly across the metallic surface of the port docks.If the cart lost its grip on Eros, he wouldnt be strong enough to hold it back.Of course, if one of the increasingly frequent strikes hit him, it would be a lot like getting shot, so waiting around wasnt a good solve either.He put both dangers out of his mind and did the work.For ten nervous minutes, his suit smelled of overheating plastic.All the diagnostics showed within the error bars, and by the time the recyclers cleared it, his air supply still looked good.Another little mystery he wasnt going to solve.The abyss above him shone with unflickering stars.One of the dots of light was Earth.He didnt know which one.The service hatch had been tucked in a natural outcropping of stone, the raw ferrous cart track like a ribbon of silver in the darkness.Grunting, Miller hauled the cart and the bomb and his own exhausted body up around the curve, and spin gravity once again pressed down on his feet instead of stretching his knees and spine.Light headed, he keyed in the codes until the hatch opened.Eros lay before him, darker than the empty sky.He ran the hand terminal connection through the suit, calling Holden for what he expected was the last time.Miller, Holden said almost immediately.Im heading in now, he said.Wait.Look, theres a way we might be able to get an automated cart.If the Roci   Yeah, but you know how it is.Im already here.And we dont know how fast this sonofabitch can go.Weve got a problem we need to fix.This is how we do it.Holdens hope had been weak, anyway.Pro forma.A gesture and, Miller thought, maybe even heartfelt.Trying to save everyone, right to the last.I understand, Holden finally said.Okay.So once Ive broken whatever the hell I find in there?Were working on ways to annihilate the station.Good.Id hate to go through the trouble for nothing.Is there Is there anything you want me to do?After?Nah, Miller said, and then Julie was at his side, her hair floating around her like they were underwater.She glowed in more starlight than was actually there.Wait.Yes.A couple things.Julies parents.They run Mao Kwikowski Mercantile.They knew the war was going start before it did.Theyve got to have links to Protogen.Make sure they dont get away with it.And if you see them, tell them Im sorry I didnt find her in time.Right, Holden said.Miller squatted in the darkness.Was there anything else?Shouldnt there be more?A message to Havelock, maybe?Or Muss.Or Diogo and his OPA friends?But then there would have to be something to say.Okay, Miller said.Thats it, then.It was good working with you.Im sorry it came down this way, Holden said.It wasnt an apology for what hed done or said, for what hed chosen and refused.Yeah, Miller said.But what can you do, right?It was as close to goodbye as either of them could get.Miller shut the connection, brought up the script Naomi had sent him, and enabled it.While he was at it, he turned the Eros feed back on.A soft hushing sound, like fingernails scratching down an endless sheet of paper.He turned on the carts lights, the dark entrance of Eros brightening to industrial gray, shadows scattering to the corners.His imagined Julie stood in the glare like it was a spotlight, the glow illuminating her and all the structures behind her at the same time, the remnant of a long dream, almost over.He took off the brakes, pushed, and went inside Eros for the last time.Holden knew that humans could tolerate extremely high g forces over short durations.With proper safety systems, professional daredevils had sustained impacts in excess of twenty five gs and survived.The human body deformed naturally, absorbed energy in soft tissues, and diffused impacts across larger areas.He also knew that the problem with extended exposure to high g was that the constant pressure on the circulatory system would begin exposing weaknesses.Have a weak spot in an artery that could turn into an aneurysm in forty years?A few hours at seven g might just pop it open now.Capillaries in the eyes started to leak.The eye itself deformed, sometimes causing permanent damage.And then there were the hollow spaces, like the lungs and digestive tract.You piled on enough gravity, and they collapsed.And while combat ships might maneuver at very high g for short durations, every moment spent under thrust multiplied the danger.Eros didnt need to shoot anything at them.It could just keep speeding up until their bodies exploded under the pressure.His console was showing five g, but even as he watched, it shifted to six.They couldnt keep this up.Eros was going to get away.There was nothing he could do about it.But he still didnt order Alex to stop accelerating.As if Naomi were reading his mind, WE CANT KEEP THIS UP POPPED UP on his console, her user ID in front of the text.FREDS WORKING ON IT.THEY MIGHT NEED US TO BE WITHIN RANGE OF EROS WHEN THEY COME UP WITH A PLAN, he replied.Even moving his fingers the millimeters necessary to use the controls built into his chair for exactly this reason was painfully difficult.WITHIN RANGE FOR WHAT?NAOMI TYPED.Holden didnt answer.He had no idea.His blood was burning with drugs to keep him awake and alert even while his body was being crushed.The drugs had the contradictory effect of making his brain run at double speed while not allowing him to actually think.But Fred would come up with something.Lots of smart people were thinking about it.And Miller.Miller was lugging a fusion bomb through Eros right now.When your enemy had the tech advantage, you came at him as low tech as you could get.Maybe one sad detective pulling a nuclear weapon on a wagon would slip through their defenses.Naomi had said they werent magic.Maybe Miller could make it and give them the opening they needed.Either way, Holden had to be there, even if it was just to see.FRED, Naomi typed to him.Holden opened the connection.Fred looked to him like a man suppressing a grin.Holden, he said.How are you guys holding up?SIX GS.SPIT IT OUT.Right.So it turns out that the UN cops have been ripping Protogens network apart, looking for clues as to what the hells been going on.Guess who showed up as public enemy number one for the Protogen bigwigs?Yours truly.Suddenly all is forgiven, and Earth welcomes me back into her warm embrace.The enemy of my enemy thinks I am a righteous bastard.GOODY.MY SPLEEN IS COLLAPSING.HURRY UP.The idea of Eros crashing into Earth is bad enough.Extinction level event, even if its just a rock.But the UN people have been watching the Eros feeds, and its scaring the shit out of them.AND.Earth is preparing to launch her entire ground based nuclear arsenal.Thousands of nukes.Theyre going to vaporize that rock.The navy will intercept whats left after the initial attack and sterilize that entire area of space with constant nuclear bombardment.I know its a risk, but its what we have.Holden resisted the urge to shake his head.He didnt want to wind up with one cheek stuck to the chair permanently.EROS DODGED THE NAUVOO.ITS GOING SIX GS RIGHT NOW, AND ACCORDING TO NAOMI, MILLER FEELS NO ACCELERATION.WHATEVER ITS DOING, IT DOESNT HAVE THE SAME INERTIAL LIMITATIONS WE HAVE.WHATS TO STOP IT FROM JUST DODGING AGAIN?AT THESE SPEEDS, THE MISSILES WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO TURN AROUND AND CATCH IT.AND WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TARGETING ON?EROS DOESNT REFLECT RADAR ANYMORE.Thats where you come in.We need you to try bouncing a laser off of it.We can use the Rocinantes targeting system to guide the missiles in.I HATE TO BREAK IT TO YOU, BUT WELL BE OUT OF THIS GAME LONG BEFORE THOSE MISSILES SHOW.WE CANT KEEP UP.WE CANT GUIDE THE MISSILES IN FOR YOU.AND ONCE WE LOSE VISUAL, NO ONE WILL BE ABLE TO TRACK WHERE EROS IS.You might have to put it on autopilot, Fred said.Meaning You might all have to die in the seats youre in right now.IVE ALWAYS WANTED TO DIE A MARTYR AND ALL, BUT WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THE ROCI CAN BEAT THIS THING ON ITS OWN?IM NOT KILLING MY CREW BECAUSE YOU CANT COME UP WITH A GOOD PLAN.Fred leaned toward the screen, his eyes narrowing.For the first time, Freds mask slipped and Holden saw the fear and helplessness behind it.Look, I know what Im asking, but you know the stakes.This is what we have.I didnt call you to hear how it wont work.Either help or give up.Right now devils advocate is just another name for asshole.Im crushing myself to death, probably doing permanent damage, just because I wouldnt give up, you bastard.So sorry I didnt sign my crew up to die the minute you said to do it.Having to type everything out had the advantage of restraining emotional outbursts.Instead of ripping into Fred for questioning his commitment, Holden just typed LET ME THINK ABOUT IT and cut the connection.The optical tracking system watching Eros flashed a warning to him that the asteroid was increasing speed again.The giant sitting on his chest added a few pounds as Alex pushed the Rocinante to keep up.A flashing red indicator informed Holden that because of the duration theyd spent at the current acceleration, he could expect as much as 12 percent of the crew to stroke out.It would go up.Enough time, and it would reach 100 percent.He tried to remember the Rocis maximum theoretical acceleration.Alex had already flown it at twelve g briefly when theyd left the Donnager.The actual limit was one of those trivial numbers, a way to brag about something your ship would never really do.Fifteen g, was it?Twenty?Miller hadnt felt any acceleration at all.How fast could you go if you didnt even feel it?Almost without realizing he was going to do it, Holden activated the master engine cutoff switch.Within seconds he was in free fall, wracked with coughs as his organs tried to find their original resting places inside his body.When Holden had recovered enough to take one really deep breath, his first in hours, Alex came on the comm.Cap, did you kill the engines?the pilot said.Yeah, that was me.Were done.Eros is getting away no matter what we do.We were just prolonging the inevitable, and risking some crew deaths in the process.Naomi turned her chair and gave him a sad little smile.She was sporting a black eye from the acceleration.We did our best, she said.Holden shoved out of his chair hard enough that he bruised his forearms on the ceiling, then shoved off hard again and pinned his back to a bulkhead by grabbing on to a fire extinguisher mount.Naomi was watching him from across the deck, her mouth a comical O of surprise.He knew he probably looked ridiculous, like a petulant child throwing a tantrum, but he couldnt stop himself.He broke free of his grip on the fire extinguisher and floated into the middle of the deck.He hadnt known hed been pounding on the bulkhead with his other fist.Now that he did, his hand hurt.God dammit, he said.Just God dammit.We  Naomi started, but he cut her off.We did our best?What the hell does that matter?Holden felt a red haze in his mind, and not all of it was from the drugs.I did my best to help the Canterbury, too.I tried to do the right thing when I let us be taken by the Donnager.Did my good intentions mean jack shit?Naomis expression went flat.Now her eyelids dropped, and she stared at him from narrow slits.Her lips pressed together until they were almost white.They wanted me to kill you, Holden thought.They wanted me to kill my crew just in case Eros cant break fifteen g, and I couldnt do it.The guilt and rage and sorrow played against each other, turning into something thin and unfamiliar.He couldnt put a name to the feeling.Youre the last person Id expect to hear self pity from, she said, her voice tight.Wheres the captain whos always asking, What can we do right now to make things better?Holden gestured around himself helplessly.Show me which button to push to stop everyone on Earth from being killed, Ill push it.Just as long as it doesnt kill you.Naomi unbuckled her harness and floated toward the crew ladder.Im going below to check on Amos, she said, then opened the deck hatch.She paused.Im your operations officer, Holden.Monitoring communication lines is part of the job.I know what Fred wanted.Holden blinked, and Naomi pulled herself out of sight.The hatch slammed behind her with a bang that couldnt have been any harder than normal but felt like it was anyway.Holden called up to the cockpit and told Alex to take a break and get some coffee.The pilot stopped on his way through the deck, looking like he wanted to talk, but Holden just waved him on.Alex shrugged and left.The watery feeling in his gut had taken root and bloomed into a full fledged, limb shaking panic.Some vicious, vindictive, self flagellating part of his mind insisted on running nonstop movies of Eros hurtling toward Earth.It would come screaming down out of the sky like every religions vision of apocalypse made real, fire and earthquakes and pestilential rain sweeping the land.But each time Eros hit the Earth in his mind, it was the explosion of the Canterbury he saw.A shockingly sudden white light, and then nothing but the sound of ice pebbles rattling across his hull like gentle hail.Mars would survive, for a while.Pockets of the Belt would hold out even longer, probably.They had a culture of making do, surviving on scraps, living on the bleeding edge of their resources.But in the end, without Earth, everything would eventually die.Humans had been out of the gravity well a long time.Long enough to have developed the technology to cut that umbilical cord, but theyd just never bothered to do it.Stagnant.Humanity, for all its desire to fling itself into every livable pocket it could reach, had become stagnant.Satisfied to fly around in ships built half a century before, using technology that hadnt changed in longer than that.Earth had been so focused on her own problems that shed ignored her far flung children, except when asking for her share of their labors.Mars had bent her entire population to the task of remaking the planet, changing its red face to green.Trying to make a new Earth to end their reliance on the old.And the Belt had become the slums of the solar system.Everyone too busy trying to survive to spend any time creating something new.We found the protomolecule at exactly the right time for it to do the most damage to us, Holden thought.It had looked like a shortcut.A way to avoid having to do any of the work, to just jump straight to godhood.And it had been so long since anything was a real threat to humanity outside of itself that no one was even smart enough to be scared.Dresden had said it himself: The things that had made the protomolecule, loaded it into Phoebe, and shot it at the Earth were already godlike back when humanitys ancestors thought photosynthesis and the flagellum were cutting edge.But hed taken their ancient engine of destruction and turned the key anyway, because when you got right down to it, humans were still just curious monkeys.They still had to poke everything they found with a stick to see what it did.The red haze in Holdens vision had taken on a strange strobing pattern.It took him a moment to realize that a red telltale on his panel was flashing, letting him know that the Ravi was calling.He kicked off a nearby crash couch, floated back to his station, and opened the link.Rocinante here, Ravi, go ahead.Holden, why are we stopped?McBride asked.Because we werent going to keep up anyway, and the danger of crew casualties was getting too high, he replied.It sounded weak even to him.Cowardly.McBride didnt seem to notice.Roger.Im going to get new orders.Will let you know if anything changes.Holden killed the connection and stared blankly at the console.The visual tracking system was doing its very best to keep Eros in sight.The Roci was a good ship.State of the art.And since Alex had tagged the asteroid as a threat, the computer would do everything in its power to keep track of it.But Eros was a fast moving, low albedo object that didnt reflect radar.It could move unpredictably and at high speed.It was just a matter of time before they lost track of it, especially if it wanted to be lost track of.Next to the tracking information on his console, a small data window opened to inform him that the Ravi had turned on its transponder.It was standard practice even for military ships to keep them on when there was no apparent threat or need for stealth.The radio man on the little UNN corvette must have flipped it back on out of habit.And now the Roci registered it as a known vessel and threw it onto the threat display with a gently pulsing green dot and a name tag.Holden looked at it blankly for a long moment.He felt his eyes go wide.Shit, Holden said, then opened the shipwide comm.Naomi, I need you in ops.I think Id rather stay down here for a bit, she replied.Holden hit the battle stations alert button on his console.The deck lights shifted to red and a Klaxon sounded three times.XO Nagata to ops, he said.Let her chew him out later.Hed have it coming.But right now he didnt have any time to waste.Naomi was on the ops deck in less than a minute.Holden had already buckled back into his crash couch and was pulling up the comm logs.Naomi pushed over to her chair and belted in as well.She gave him an inquiring look Are we going to die after all?but said nothing.If he said so, she would.He felt a spike of equal parts admiration for and impatience with her.He found what he was looking for in the logs before speaking.Okay, he said.Weve had radio contact with Miller after Eros dropped off of radar.Is that right?Yes, thats right, she said.But his suit isnt powerful enough to transmit through the shell of Eros out to much distance, so one of the moored ships is boosting the signal for him.Which means that whatever Eros is doing to kill the radar isnt killing all radio transmissions from outside.That seems right, Naomi said, a growing curiosity in her voice.And you still have the control codes for the five OPA freighters on the surface, right?Yes, sir.And then a moment later: Oh, shit.Okay, Holden said, turning in his chair to face Naomi with a grin.Why do the Roci and every other naval ship in the system have a switch to turn off their transponders?So the enemy cant get a missile lock on the transponder signal and blow them up, she said, sharing his grin now.Holden spun his chair back around and began opening a comm channel to Tycho Station.XO, would you be so kind as to use the control codes Miller gave you to turn those five OPA freighters back on and fire up their transponders?Unless our visitor on Eros can outrun radio waves, I think weve gotten around the acceleration problem.Aye, aye, Captain, Naomi replied.Even looking the other way, Holden could hear the smile in her voice, and it melted the last of the ice in his gut.They had a plan.They were going to make a difference.Call coming in from the Ravi, Naomi said.You want it before I turn the transponders on?Hell yes.The line clicked.Captain Holden.Weve got our new orders.Seems were going to be chasing that thing a little further.McBride sounded almost like someone who hadnt just been sent to her death.Stoic.You might want to hold off on that for a couple minutes, Holden said.We have an alternative.As Naomi activated the transponders on the five OPA freighters Miller had left moored to the surface of Eros, Holden laid out the plan to McBride and then, on a separate line, Fred.By the time Fred had gotten back to him with an enthusiastic approval of the plan from both him and the UN Naval command, the five freighters were pinging away, telling the solar system where they were.An hour after that, the largest swarm of interplanetary nuclear weapons in the history of humanity had been fired and were winging their way toward Eros.Were going to win, Holden thought as he watched the missiles take flight like a swarm of angry red dots on his threat display.Were going to beat this thing.And what was more, his crew was going to see the end of it.No one else had to die.Except  Millers calling, Naomi said.Probably noticed we turned his ships back on.Holden had a wrenching feeling in his stomach.Miller would be there, on Eros, when those missiles arrived.Not everyone would get to celebrate the coming victory.Hey.Miller.How you doing?he said, not quite able to keep the funereal tone out of his voice.Millers voice was choppy, and half drowned by static, but not so garbled that Holden couldnt hear the tone in it and know that he was about to take a piss all over their parade.Holden, Miller said.We have a problem.One.Two.Three.Miller pushed down on the hand terminal, resetting the trigger again.The double doors in front of him had once been one of thousands of quietly automated mechanisms.They had run reliably in their subtle magnetic tracks, maybe for years.Now something black with the texture of tree bark grew like creepers around their sides, deforming the metal.Past them lay the port corridors, the warehouses, the casino.Everything that had been Eros Station and was now the vanguard of an invading alien intelligence.But to reach it, Miller had to pry open a stuck door.In less than five seconds.While wearing an environment suit.He put the hand terminal down again and reached quickly for the thin crack where the two doors met.One.Two.The door shifted a centimeter, flakes of black matter sifting down.Three.Four.He grabbed the hand terminal again, resetting the trigger.This shit just wasnt going to work.Miller sat on the ground beside the cart.The Eros feed whispered and muttered, apparently unaware of the tiny invader scratching at the stations skin.Miller took a long, deep breath.
