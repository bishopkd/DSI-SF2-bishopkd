Getting up, he walked glumly into the living room.How would I know if it was them?he inquired of himself.He opened the door.Two people stood in the dim hall, a small woman, lovely in the manner of Greta Garbo, with blue eyes and yellow blond hair; the man larger, with intelligent eyes but flat, Mongolian features which gave him a brutal look.The woman wore a fashionable wrap, high shiny boots, and tapered pants; the man lounged in a rumpled shirt and stained trousers, giving an air of almost deliberate vulgarity.He smiled at Isidore but his bright, small eyes remained oblique.Were looking the small blond woman began, but then she saw past Isidore; her face dissolved in rapture and she whisked past him, calling.Pris!How are you?Isidore turned.The two women were embracing.He stepped aside, and Roy Baty entered, somber and large, smiling his crooked, tuneless smile.14  Can we talk?Roy said, indicating Isidore.Pris, vibrant with bliss, said, Its okay up to a point.To Isidore she said, Excuse us.She led the Batys off to one side and muttered at them; then the three of them returned to confront J.  R.  Isidore, who felt uncomfortable and out of place.This is Mr.Isidore, Pris said.Hes taking care of me.The words came out tinged with an almost malicious sarcasm; Isidore blinked.See?He brought me some natural food.Food, Irmgard Baty echoed, and trotted lithely into the kitchen to see.Peaches, she said, immediately picking up a bowl and spoon; smiling at Isidore she ate with brisk little animal bites.Her smile, different from Priss, provided simple warmth; it had no veiled overtones.Going after herhe felt attracted to herIsidore said, Youre from Mars.Yes, we gave up.Her voice bobbed, as, with birdish acumen, her blue eyes sparkled at him.What an awful building you live in.Nobody else lives here, do they?We didnt see any other fights.I live upstairs, Isidore said.Oh, I thought you and Pris were maybe living together.Irmgard Baty did not sound disapproving; she meant it, obviously, as merely a statement.Dourlybut still smiling his smileRoy Baty said, Well, they got Polokov.The joy which had appeared on Priss face at seeing her friends at once melted away.Who else?They got Garland, Roy Baty said.They got Anders and Gitchel and then just a little earlier today they got Luba.He delivered the news as if, perversely, it pleased him to be telling this.As if he derived pleasure from Priss shock.I didnt think theyd get Luba; remember I kept saying that during the trip?So that leaves Pris said.The three of us, Irmgard said with apprehensive urgency.Thats why were here.Roy Batys voice boomed out with new, unexpected warmth; the worse the situation the more he seemed to enjoy it.Isidore could not fathom him in the slightest.Oh god, Pris said, stricken.Well, they had this investigator, this bounty hunter, Irmgard said in agitation, named Dave Holden.Her lips dripped venom at the name.And then Polokov almost got him.Almost got him, Roy echoed, his smile now immense.So hes in this hospital, this Holden, Irmgard continued.And evidently they gave his list to another bounty hunter, and Polokov almost got him, too.But it wound up with him retiring Polokov.And then he went after Luba; we know that because she managed to get hold of Garland and he sent out someone to capture the bounty hunter and take him to the Mission Street building.See, Luba called us after Garlands agent picked up the bounty hunter.She was sure it would be okay; she was sure that Garland would la him.She added, But evidently something went wrong on Mission.We dont know what.Maybe we never will.Pris asked, Does this bounty hunter have our names?Oh yes, dear, I suppose he does, Irmgard said.But he doesnt know where we are.Roy and I arent going back to our apartment; we have as much stuff in our car as we could cram in, and weve decided to take one of these abandoned apartments in this ratty old building.Is that wise?Isidore spoke up, summoning courage.T t to all be in one place?Well, they got everybody else, Irmgard said, matter of factly; she, too, like her husband, seemed strangely resigned, despite her superficial agitation.All of them, Isidore thought; theyre all strange.He sensed it without being able to finger it.As if a peculiar and malign abstractness pervaded their mental processes.Except, perhaps, for Pris; certainly she was radically frightened.Pris seemed almost right, almost natural.But  Why dont you move in with him?Roy said to Pris, indicating Isidore.He could give you a certain amount of protection.A chickenhead?Pris said.Im not going to live with a chickenhead.Her nostrils flared.Irmgard said rapidly, I think youre foolish to be a snob at a time like this.Bounty hunters move fast; he may try to tie it up this evening.There may be a bonus in it for him if he got it done by  Keerist, close the hall door, Roy said, going over to it; he slammed it with one blow of his hand, thereupon summarily locking it.I think you should move in with Isidore, Pris, and I think Irm and I should be here in the same building; that way we can help each other.Ive got some electronic components in my car, junk I ripped off the ship.Ill install a two way bug so Pris you can hear us and we can hear you, and Ill rig up an alarm system that any of the four of us can set off.Its obvious that the synthetic identities didnt work out, even Garlands.Of course, Garland put his head in the noose by bringing the bounty hunter to the Mission Street building; that was a mistake.And Polokov, instead of staying as far away as possible from the hunter, chose to approach him.We wont do that; well stay put.He did not sound worried in the slightest; the situation seemed to rouse him to crackling near manic energy.I think He sucked in his breath noisily, holding the attention of everyone else in the room, including Isidore.I think that theres a reason why the three of us are still alive.I think if he had any clue as to where we are hed have shown up here by now.The whole idea in bounty hunting is to work as fast as hell.Thats where the profit comes.And if he waits, Irmgard said in agreement, we slip away, like weve done.I bet Roy is right; I bet he has our names but no location.Poor Luba; stuck in the War Memorial Opera House, right out in the open.No difficulty finding her.Well, Roy said stiltedly, she wanted it that way; she believed shed be safer as a public figure.You told her otherwise, Irmgard said.Yes, Roy agreed, I told her, and I told Polokov not to try to pass himself off as a W. P. O.  man.And I told Garland that one of his own bounty hunters would get him, which is very possibly, just conceivably, exactly what did happen.He rocked back and forth on his heavy heels, his face wise with profundity.Isidore spoke up.I I I gather from l l listening to Mr.Baty that hes your n n natural leader.Oh yes, Roys a leader, Irmgard said.Pris said, He organized our trip.From Mars to here.Then, Isidore said, you better do what h h he suggests.His voice broke with hope and tension.I think it would be t t terrific, Pris, if you 1 l lived with me.Ill stay home a couple of days from my jobI have a vacation coming.To make sure youre okay.And maybe Milt, who was very inventive, could design a weapon for him to use.Something imaginative, which would slay bounty hunters  whatever they were.He had an indistinct, glimpsed darkly impression: of something merciless that carried a printed list and a gun, that moved machine like through the flat, bureaucratic job of killing.A thing without emotions, or even a face; a thing that if killed got replaced immediately by another resembling it.And so on, until everyone real and alive had been shot.Incredible, he thought, that the police cant do anything.I cant believe that.These people must have done something.Perhaps they emigrated back to Earth illegally.Were toldthe TV tells usto report any landing of a ship outside the approved pads.The police must be watching for this.But even so, no one got killed deliberately any more.It ran contrary to Mercerism.The chickenhead, Pris said, likes me.Dont call him that, Pris, Irmgard said; she gave Isidore a look of compassion.Think what he could call you.Pris said nothing.Her expression became enigmatic.Ill go start rigging up the bug, Roy said.Irmgard and Ill stay in this apartment; Pris you go withMr.Isidore.He started toward the door, striding with amazing speed for a man so heavy.In a blur he disappeared out the door, which banged back as he flung it open.Isidore, then, had a momentary, strange hallucination; he saw briefly a frame of metal, a platform of pullies and circuits and batteries and turrets and gearsand then the slovenly shape of Roy Baty faded back into view.Isidore felt a laugh rise up inside him; he nervously choked it off.And felt bewildered.A man,  Pris said distantly, of action.Too bad hes so poor with his hands, doing mechanical things.If we get saved, Irmgard said in a scolding, severe tone, as if chiding her, itll be because of Roy.But is it worth it, Pris said, mostly to herself.She shrugged, then nodded to Isidore.Okay, J .R.  Ill move in with you and you can protect me.A a all of you, Isidore said immediately.Solemnly, in a formal little voice, Irmgard Baty said to him, I want you to know we appreciate it very much, Mr.Isidore.Youre the first friend I think any of us have found here on Earth.Its very nice of you and maybe sometime we can repay you.She glided over to pat him on the arm.Do you have any pre colonial fiction I could read?he asked her.Pardon?Irmgard Baty glanced inquiringly at Pris.Those old magazines, Pris said; she had gathered a few things together to take with her, and Isidore lifted the bundle from her arms, feeling the glow that comes only from satisfaction at a goal achieved.No, J. R.  We didnt bring any back with us, for reasons I explained.Ill g g go to a library tomorrow, he said, going out into the hall.And g get you and me too some to read, so youll have something to do besides just waiting.He led Pris upstairs to his own apartment, dark and empty and stuffy and lukewarm as it was; carrying her possessions into the bedroom, he at once turned on the heater, lights, and the TV to its sole channel.I like this, Pris said, but in the same detached and remote toneas before.She meandered about, hands thrust in her skirt pockets; on her face a sour expression, almost righteous in the degree of its displeasure, appeared.In contrast to her stated reaction.Whats the matter?he asked as he laid her possessions out on the couch.Nothing.She halted at the picture window, drew the drapes back, and gazed morosely out.If you think theyre looking for you he began.Its a dream, Pris said.Induced by drugs that Roy gave me.P pardon?You really think that bounty hunters exist?Mr.Baty said they killed your friends.Roy Baty is as crazy as I am, Pris said.Our trip was between a mental hospital on the East Coast and here.Were all schizophrenic, with defective emotional livesflattening of affect, its called.And we have group hallucinations.I didnt think it was true, he said full of relief.Why didnt you?She swiveled to stare intently at him; her scrutiny was so strict that he felt himself flushing.B b because things like that dont happen.The g government never kills anyone, for any crime.And Mercerism  But you see, Pris said, if youre not human, then its all different.Thats not true.Even animalseven eels and gophers and snakes and spidersare sacred.Pris, still regarding him fixedly, said, So it cant be, can it?As you say, even animals are protected by law.All life.Everything organic that wriggles or squirms or burrows or flies or swarms or lays eggs or She broke off, because Roy Baty had appeared, abruptly throwing the door of the apartment open and entering; a trail of wire rustled after him.Insects, he said, showing no embarrassment at overhearing them, are especially sacrosanct.Lifting a picture rom the wall of the living room he attached a small electronic device to the nail, stepped back, viewed it, then replaced the picture.Now the alarm.He gathered up the trailing wire, which led to a complex assembly.Smiling his discordant smile, he showed the assembly to Pris and John Isidore.The alarm.These wires go under the carpet; theyre antennae.It picks up the presence of a He hesitated.A mentational entity, he said obscurely, which isnt one of us four.So it rings, Pris said, and then what?Hell have a gun.We cant fall on him and bite him to death.This assembly, Roy continued, has a Penfield unit built into it.When the alarm has been triggered it radiates a mood of panic to theintruder.Unless he acts very fast, which he may.Enormous panic; I have the gain turned all the way up.No human being can remain in the vicinity more than a matter of seconds.Thats the nature of panic: it leads to random circus motions, purposeless flight, and muscle and neural spasms.He concluded, Which will give us an opportunity to get him.Possibly.Depending on how good he is.Isidore said, Wont the alarm affect us?Thats right, Pris said to Roy Baty.Itll affect Isidore.Well, so what, Roy said.And resumed his task of installation.So they both go racing out of here panic stricken.Itll still give us time to react.And they wont kill Isidore; hes not on their list.Thats why hes usable as a cover.Pris said brusquely, You cant do any better, Roy?No, he answered, I cant.Ill be able to g g get a weapon tomorrow, Isidore spoke up.Youre sure Isidores presence here wont set off the alarm?Pris said.After all, hesyou know.Ive compensated for his cephalic emanations, Roy explained.Their sum wont trip anything; itll take an additional human.Person.Scowling, he glanced at Isidore, aware of what he had said.Youre androids, Isidore said.But he didnt care; it made no difference to him.I see why they want to kill you, he said.Actually youre not alive.Everything made sense to him, now.The bounty hunter, the killing of their friends, the trip to Earth, all these precautions.When I used the word human, Roy Baty said to Pris, I used the wrong word.Thats right, Mr.Baty, Isidore said.But what does it matter to me?I mean, Im a special; they dont treat me very well either, like for instance I cant emigrate.He found himself yabbering away like a folletto.You cant come here; I cant He calmed himself.After a pause Roy Baty said laconically, You wouldnt enjoy Mars.Youre missing nothing.I wondered how long it would be, Pris said to Isidore, before you realized.We are different, arent we?Thats what probably tripped up Garland and Max Polokov, Roy Baty said.They were so goddamn sure they could pass.Luba, too.Youre intellectual, Isidore said; he felt excited again at having understood.Excitement and pride.You think abstractly, and you dont He gesticulated, his words tangling up with one another.As usual.I wish I had an IQ like you have; then I could pass the test, I wouldnt be a chickenhead.I think youre very superior; I could learn a lot from you.After an interval Roy Baty said, Ill finish wiring up the alarm.He resumed work.He doesnt understand yet, Pris said in a sharp, brittle, stentorian voice, how we got off Mars.What we did there.What we couldnt help doing, Roy Baty grunted.At the open door to the hall Irmgard Baty had been standing; they noticed her as she spoke up.I dont think we have to worry about Mr.Isidore, she said earnestly; she walked swiftly toward him, looked up into his face.They dont treat him very well either, as he said.And what we did on Mars he isnt interested in; he knows us and he likes us and an emotional acceptance like thatits everything to him.Its hard for us to grasp that, but its true.To Isidore she said, standing very close to him once again and peering up at him, You could get a lot of money by turning us in; do you realize that?Twisting, she said to her husband, See, he realizes that but still he wouldnt say anything.Youre a great man, Isidore, Pris said.Youre a credit to your race.If he was an android, Roy said heartily, hed turn us in about ten tomorrow morning.Hed take off for his job and that would be it.Im overwhelmed with admiration.His tone could not be deciphered; at least Isidore could not crack it.And we imagined this would be a friendless world, a planet of hostile faces, all turned against us.He barked out a laugh.Im not at all worried, Irmgard said.You ought to be seared to the soles of your feet, Roy said.Lets vote, Pris said.As we did on the ship, when we had a disagreement.Well, Irmgard said, I wont say anything more.But if we turn this down I dont think well find any other human being wholl take us in and help us.Mr.Isidore is She searched for the word.Special, Pris said.15  Solemnly, and with ceremony, the vote was taken.We stay here, Irmgard said, with firmness.In this apartment, in this building.Roy Baty said, I vote we kill Mr.Isidore and hide somewhere else.He and his wifeand John Isidorenow turned tautly toward Pris.In a low voice Pris said, I vote we make our stand here.She added, more loudly, I think J. R. s value to us outweighs his danger, that of his knowing.Obviously we cant live among humans without being discovered; thats what killed Polokov and Garland and Luba and Anders.Thats what killed all of them.Maybe they did just what were doing, Roy Baty said.Confided in, trusted, one given human being who they believed was different.As you said, special.We dont know that, Irmgard said.Thats only a conjecture.I think they, they She gestured.Walked around.Sang from a stage like Luba.We trustIll tell you what we trust that fouls us up, Roy; its our goddamn superior intelligence!She glared at her husband, her small, high breasts rising and falling rapidly.Were so smartRoy, youre doing it right now; goddamn you, youre doing it now!Pris said, I think Irms right.So we hang our lives on a substandard, blighted Roy began, then gave up.Im tired, he said simply.Its been a long trip, Isidore.But not very long here.Unfortunately.I hope, Isidore said happily, I can help make your stay here on Earth pleasant.He felt sure he could.It seemed to him a cinch, the culmination of his whole lifeand of the new authority which he had manifested on the vidphone today at work.As soon as he officially quit work that evening, Rick Deckard flew across town to animal row: the several blocks of big time animal dealers with their huge glass windows and lurid signs.The new and horribly unique depression which had floored him earlier in the day had not left.This, his activity here with animals and animal dealers, seemed the only weak spot in the shroud of depression, a flaw by which he might be able to grab it and exorcise it.In the past, anyhow, the sight of animals, the scent of money deals with expensive stakes, had done much for him.Maybe it would accomplish as much now.Yes, sit, a nattily dressed new animal salesman said to him chattily as he stood gaping with a sort of glazed, meek need at the displays.See anything you like?Rick said, I see a lot I like.Its the cost that bothers me.You tell us the deal you want to make, the salesman said.What you want to take home with you and how you want to pay for it.Well take the package to our sales manager and get his big okay.Ive got three thou cash.The department, at the end of the day, had paid him his bounty.How much, he asked, is that family of rabbits over there?Sir, if you have a down payment of three thou, I can make you owner of something a lot better than a pair of rabbits.What about a goat?I havent thought much about goats, Rick said.May I ask if this represents a new price bracket for you?Well, I dont usually carry around three thou, Rick conceded.I thought as much, sit, when you mentioned rabbits.The thing about rabbits, sit, is that everybody has one.Id like to see you step up to the goat class where I feel you belong.Frankly you look more like a goat man to me.What are the advantages to goats?The animal salesman said, The distinct advantage of a goat is that it can be taught to butt anyone who tries to steal it.Not if they shoot it with a hypno dart and descend by rope ladder from a hovering hovercar, Rick said.The salesman, undaunted, continued, A goat is loyal.And it has a free, natural soul which no cage can chain up.And there is one exceptional additional feature about goats, one which you may not be aware of.Often times when you invest in an animal and take it home you find, some morning, that its eaten something radioactive and died.A goat isnt bothered by contaminated quasi foodstuffs; it can eat eclectically, even items that would fell a cow or a horse or most especially a cat.As a long term investment we feel that the goatespecially the femaleoffers unbeatable advantages to the serious animal owner.Is this goat a female?He had noticed a big black goat standing squarely in the center of its cage; he moved that way and the salesman accompanied him.The goat, it seemed to Rick, was beautiful.Yes, this goat is a female.A black Nubian goat, very large, as you can see.This is a superb contender in this years market, sir.And were offering her at an attractive, unusually low, low price.Getting out his creased Sidneys, Rick looked up the listing, on goats, black Nubian.Will this be a cash deal?the salesman asked.Or are you trading in a used animal?All cash, Rick said.On a slip of paper the salesman scribbled a price and then briefly, almost furtively, showed it to Rick.too much, Rick said, He took the slip of paper and wrote down a more modest figure.We couldnt let a goat go for that, the salesman protested.He wrote another figure.This goat is less than a year old; she has a very long life expectancy.He showed the figure to Rick.Its a deal, Rick said.He signed the time payment contract, paid over his three thousand dollarshis entire bounty moneyas down payment, and shortly found himself standing by his hovercar, rather dazed, as employees of the animal dealer loaded the crate of goat into the car.I own an animal now, he said to himself.A living animal, not electric.For the second time in my life.The expense, the contractual indebtedness, appalled him; he found himself shaking.But I had to do it, he said to himself.The experience with Phil ReschI have to get my confidence, my faith in myself and my abilities, back.Or I wont keep my job.His hands numb he guided the hovercar up into the sky and headed for his apartment and Iran.Shell be angry, he said to himself.Because itll worry her, the responsibility.And since shes home all day a lot of the maintenance will fall to her.Again he felt dismal.When he had landed on the roof of his building he sat for a time, weaving together in his mind a story thick with verisimilitude.My job requires it, he thought, scraping bottom.Prestige.We couldnt go on with the electric sheep any longer; it sapped my morale.Maybe I can tell her that, he decided.Climbing from the car he maneuvered the goat cage from the back seat, with wheezing effort managed to set it down on the roof.The goat, which had slid about during the transfer, regarded him with bright eyed perspicacity, but made no sound.He descended to his floor, followed a familiar path down the hall to his own door.Hi, Iran greeted him, busy in the kitchen with dinner.Why so late tonight?Come up to the roof, he said.I want to show you something.You bought an animal.She removed her apron, smoothed back her hair reflexively, and followed him out of the apartment; they progressed down the hall with huge, eager strides.You shouldnt have gotten it without me, Iran gasped.I have a right to participate in the decision, the most important acquisition well ever  I wanted it to be a surprise, he said.You made some bounty money today, Iran said, accusingly.Rick said, Yes.I retired three andys.He entered the elevator and together they moved nearer to god.I had to buy this, he said.Something went wrong, today; something about retiring them.It wouldnt have been possible for me to go on without getting an animal.The elevator had reached the roof; he led his wife out into the evening darkness, to the cage; switching on the spotlightsmaintained for the use of all building residentshe pointed to the goat, silently.Waiting for her reaction.Oh my god, Iran said softly.She walked to the cage, peered in; then she circled around it, viewing the goat from every angle.Is it really real?she asked.Its not false?Absolutely real, he said.Unless they swindled me.But that rarely happened; the fine for counterfeiting would be enormous:two and a half times the full market value of the genuine animal.No, they didnt swindle me.Its a goat, Iran said.A black Nubian goat.Female, Rick said.So maybe later on we can mate her.And well get milk out of which we can make cheese.Can we let her out?Put her where the sheep is?She ought to be tethered, he said.For a few days at least.Iran said in an odd little voice, My life is love and pleasure.An old, old song by Josef Strauss.Remember?When we first met.She put her hand gently on his shoulder, leaned toward him, and kissed him.Much love.And very much pleasure.Thanks, he said, and hugged her.Lets run downstairs and give thanks to Mercer.Then we can come up here again and right away name her; she needs a name.And maybe you can find some rope to tether her.She started off.Standing by his horse Judy, grooming and currying her, their neighbor Bill Barbour called to them, Hey, thats a nice looking goat you have, Deckards.Congratulations.Evening, Mrs.Deckard.Maybe youll have kids; Ill maybe trade you my colt for a couple of kids.Thanks, Rick said.He followed after Iran, in the direction of the elevator.Does this cure your depression?he asked her.It cures mine.Iran said, It certainly does cure my depression.Now we can admit to everybody that the sheeps false.No need to do that, he said cautiously.But we can, Iran persisted.See, now we have nothing to hide; what weve always wanted has come true.Its a dream!Once more she stood on tiptoe, leaning and nimbly kissing him; her breath, eager and erratic, tickled his neck.She reached, then, to stab at the elevator button.Something warned him.Something made him say, Lets not go down to the apartment yet.Lets stay up here with the goat.Lets just sit and look at her and maybe feed the goat something.They gave me a bag of oats to start us out.And we can read the manual on goat maintenance; they included that, too, at no extra charge.We can call her Euphemia.The elevator, however, had come and already Iran was trotting inside.Iran, wait, he said.It would be immoral not to fuse with Mercer in gratitude, Iran said.I had hold of the handles of the box today and it overcame my depression a littlejust a little, not like this.But anyhow I got hit by a rock, here.She held up her wrist; on it he made out a small dark bruise.And I remember thinking how much better we are, how much better off, when were with Mercer.Despite the pain.Physical pain but spiritually together; I felt everyone else, all over the world, all who had fused at the same time.She held the elevator door from sliding shut.Get in, Rick.Thisll be just for a moment.You hardly ever undergo fusion; I want you to transmit the mood youre in now to everyone else; you owe it to them.It would be immoral to keep it for ourselves.She, was, of course, right.So he entered the elevator and once again descended.In their living room, at the empathy box, Iran swiftly snapped the switch, her face animated with growing gladness; it lit her up like a rising new crescent of moon.I want everyone to know, she told him.Once that happened to me; I fused and picked up someone who had just acquired an animal.And then one day Her features momentarily darkened; the pleasure fled.One day I found myself receiving from someone whose animal had died.But others of us shared our different joys with themI didnt have any, as you might knowand that cheered the person up.We might even reach a potential suicide; what we have, what were feeling, might  Theyll have our joy, Rick said, but well lose.Well exchange what we feel for what they feel.Our joy will be lost.The screen of the empathy box now showed rushing streams of bright formless color; taking a breath his wife hung on tightly to the two handles.We wont really lose what we feel, not if we keep it clearly in mind.You never really have gotten the hang of fusion, have you, Rick?Guess not, he said.But now he had begun to sense, for the first time, the value that people such as Iran obtained from Mercerism.Possibly his experience with the bounty hunter Phil Resch had altered some minute synapsis in him, had closed one neurological switch and opened another.And this perhaps had started a chain reaction.Iran, he said urgently; he drew her away from the empathy box.Listen; I want to talk about what happened to me today.He led her over to the couch, sat her down facing him.I met another bounty hunter, he said.One I never saw before.A predatory one who seemed to like to destroy them.For the first time, after being with him, I looked at them differently.I mean, in my own way I had been viewing them as he did.Wont this wait?Iran said.Rick said, I took a test, one question, and verified it; Ive begun to empathize with androids, and look what that means.You said it this morning yourself.Those poor andys.So you know what Im talking about.Thats why I bought the goat.I never felt like that before.Maybe it could be a depression, like you get.I can understand now how you suffer when youre depressed; I always thought you liked it and I thought you could have snapped yourself out any time, if not alone then by means of the mood organ.But when you get that depressed you dont care.Apathy, because youve lost a sense of worth.It doesnt matter whether you feet better because if you have no worth  What about your job?Her tone jabbed at him; he blinked.Your job, Iran repeated.What are the monthly payments on the goat?She held out her hand; reflexively he got out the contract which he had signed, passed it to her.That much, she said in a thin voice.The interest; good godthe interest alone.And you did this because you were depressed.Not as a surprise for me, as you originally said.She handed the contract back to him.Well, it doesnt matter.Im still glad you got the goat; I love the goat.But its such an economic burden.She looked gray.Rick said, I can get switched to some other desk.The department does ten or eleven separate jobs.Animal theft; I could transfer to that.But the bounty money.We need it or theyll repossess the goat!Ill get the contract extended from thirty six months to forty eight.He whipped out a ball point pen, scribbled rapidly on the back of the contract.That way itll be fifty two fifty less a month.The vidphone rang.If we hadnt come back down here, Rick said, if wed stayed up on the roof, with the goat, we wouldnt have gotten this call.Going to the vidphone, Iran said, Why are you afraid?Theyre not repossessing the goat, not yet.She started to lift the receiver.Its the department, he said.Say Im not here.He headed for the bedroom.Hello, Iran said, into the receiver.Three more andys, Rick thought to himself, that I should have followed up on today, instead of coming home.On the vidscreen Harry Bryants face had formed, so it was too late to get away.He walked, with stiff leg muscles, back toward the phone.Yes, hes here, Iran was saying.We bought a goat.Come over and see it, Mr.Bryant.A pause as she listened and then she held the receiver up to Rick.He has something he wants to say to you, she said.Going over to the empathy box she quickly seated herself and once more gripped the twin handles.She became involved almost at once.Rick stood holding the phone receiver, conscious of her mental departure.Conscious of his own aloneness.Hello, he said into the receiver.We have a tail on two of the remaining androids, Harry Bryant said.He was calling from his office; Rick saw the familiar desk, the litter of documents and papers and kipple.Obviously theyve become alertedtheyve left the address Dave gave you and now they can be found at  wait.Bryant groped about on his desk, at last located the material he wanted.Automatically Rick searched for his pen; he held the goat payment contract on his knee and prepared to write.Conapt Building 3967 C, Inspector Bryant said.Get over there as soon as you can.We have to assume they know about the ones you picked off, Garland and Luft and Polokov; thats why theyve taken unlawful flight.
