***ORDERS***ORDERS***ORDERS***   They didnt waste any time, did they?Marygay said bitterly.Must be a standing order.Strike Force Commands light weeks away; they cant even know weve re upped yet.What about our She let it trail off.The guarantee.Well, we were given our assignment of choice.Nobody guaranteed wed have the assignment for more than an hour.Its so dirty.I shrugged.Its so army.But I couldnt shake the feeling that we were going home.LIEUTENANT MANDELLA  20242389 A. D.1  Quick and dirty.I was looking at my platoon sergeant, Santesteban, but talking to myself.And anybody else who was listening.Yeah, he said.Gotta do it in the first coupla minutes or were screwed tight.He was matter of fact, laconic.Drugged.Private Collins came up with Halliday.They were holding hands unselfconsciously.Lieutenant Mandella?Her voice broke a little.Can we have just a minute?One minute, I said, too abruptly.We have to leave in five, Im sorry.Hard to watch those two together now.Neither one had any combat experience.But they knew what everybody did; how slim their chances were of ever being together again.They slumped in a corner and mumbled words and traded mechanical caresses, no passion or even comfort.Collinss eyes shone but she wasnt weeping.Halliday just looked grim, numb.She was normally by far the prettier of the two, but the sparkle had gone out of her and left a well formed dull shell.Id gotten used to open female homosex in the months since wed left Earth.Even stopped resenting the loss of potential partners.The men together still gave me a chill, though.I stripped and backed into the clamshelled suit.The new ones were a hell of a lot more complicated, with all the new biometrics and trauma maintenance.But well worth the trouble of hooking up, in case you got blown apart just a little bit.Go home to a comfortable pension with heroic prosthesis.They were even talking about the possibility of regeneration, at least for missing arms and legs.Better get it soon, before Heaven filled up with fractional people.Heaven was the new hospital/rest and recreation planet.I finished the set up sequence and the suit closed by itself.Gritted my teeth against the pain that never came, when the internal sensors and fluid tubes poked into your body.Conditioned neural bypass, so you felt only a slight puzzling dislocation.Rather than the death of a thousand cuts.Collins and Halliday were getting into their suits now and the other dozen were almost set, so I stepped over to the third platoons staging area.Say goodbye again to Marygay.She was suited and heading my way.We touched helmets instead of using the radio.Privacy.Feeling OK, honey?All right, she said.Took my pill.Yeah, happy times.Id taken mine too, supposed to make you feel optimistic without interfering with your sense of judgment.I knew most of us would probably die, but I didnt feel too bad about it.Sack with me tonight?If were both here, she said neutrally.Have to take a pill for that, too.She tried to laugh.Sleep, I mean.Howre the new people taking it?You have ten?Ten, yeah, theyre OK.Doped up, quarter dose.I did that, too; try to keep them loose.In fact, Santesteban was the only other combat veteran in my platoon; the four corporals had been in UNEF for a while but hadnt ever fought.The speaker in my cheekbone crackled and Commander Cortez said, Two minutes.Get your people lined up.We had our goodbye and I went back to check my flock.Everybody seemed to have gotten suited up without any problems, so I put them on line.We waited for what seemed like a long time.All right, load em up.With the word up, the bay door in front of me opened  the staging area having already been bled of air  and I led my men and women through to the assault ship.These new ships were ugly as hell.Just an open framework with clamps to hold you in place, swiveled lasers fore and aft, small tachyon powerplants below the lasers.Everything automated; the machine would land us as quickly as possible and then zip off to harass the enemy.It was a one use, throwaway drone.The vehicle that would come pick us up if we survived was cradled next to it, much prettier.We clamped in and the assault ship cast off from the Sangre y Victoria with twin spurts from the yaw jets.Then the voice of the machine gave us a short countdown and we sped off at four gees acceleration, straight down.The planet, which we hadnt bothered to name, was a chunk of black rock without any normal star close enough to give it heat.At first it was visible only by the absence of stars where its bulk cut off their light, but as we dropped closer we could see subtle variations in the blackness of its surface.We were coming down on the hemisphere opposite the Taurans outpost.Our recon had shown that their camp sat in the middle of a flat lava plain several hundred kilometers in diameter.It was pretty primitive compared to other Tauran bases UNEF had encountered, but there wouldnt be any sneaking up on it.We were going to careen over the horizon some fifteen klicks from the place, four ships converging simultaneously from different directions, all of us decelerating like mad, hopefully to drop right in their laps and come up shooting.There would be nothing to hide behind.I wasnt worried, of course.Abstractedly, I wished I hadnt taken the pill.We leveled off about a kilometer from the surface and sped along much faster than the rocks escape velocity, constantly correcting to keep from flying away.The surface rolled below us in a dark gray blur; we shed a little light from the pseudo cerenkov glow made by our tachyon exhaust, scooting away from our reality into its own.The ungainly contraption skimmed and jumped along for some ten minutes; then suddenly the front jet glowed and we were snapped forward inside our suits, eyeballs trying to escape from their sockets in the rapid deceleration.Prepare for ejection, the machines female mechanical voice said.Five, four  The ships lasers started firing, millisecond flashes freezing the land below in jerky stroboscopic motion.It was a twisted, pock marked jumble of fissures and random black rocks, a few meters below our feet.We were dropping, slowing.Three It never got any farther.There was a too bright flash and I saw the horizon drop away as the ships tail pitched down  then clipped the ground, and we were rolling, horribly, pieces of people and ship scattering.Then we slid pinwheeling to a bumpy halt, and I tried to pull free but my leg was pinned under the ships bulk: excruciating pain and a dry crunch as the girder crushed my leg; shrill whistle of air escaping my breached suit; then the trauma maintenance turned on snick, more pain, then no pain and I was rolling free, short stump of a leg trailing blood that froze shiny black on the dull black rock.I tasted brass and a red haze closed everything out, then deepened to the brown of river clay, then loam and I passed out, with the pill thinking this is not so bad     * * *   The suit is set up to save as much of your body as possible.If you lose part of an arm or a leg, one of sixteen razor sharp irises closes around your limb with the force of a hydraulic press, snipping it off neatly and sealing the suit before you can die of explosive decompression.Then trauma maintenance cauterizes the stump, replaces lost blood, and fills you full of happy juice and No shock.So you will either die happy or, if your comrades go on to win the battle, eventually be carried back up to the ships aid station.Wed won that round, while I slept swaddled in dark cotton.I woke up in the infirmary.It was crowded.I was in the middle of a long row of cots, each one holding someone who had been three fourths (or less) saved by his suits trauma maintenance feature.We were being ignored by the ships two doctors, who stood in bright light at operating tables, absorbed in blood rituals.I watched them for a long time.Squinting into the bright light, the blood on their green tunics could have been grease, the swathed bodies, odd soft machines that they were fixing.But the machines would cry out in their sleep, and the mechanics muttered reassurances while they plied their greasy tools.I watched and slept and woke up in different places.Finally I woke up in a regular bay.I was strapped down and being fed through a tube, biosensor electrodes attached here and there, but no medics around.The only other person in the little room was Marygay, sleeping on the bunk next to me.Her right arm was amputated just above the elbow.I didnt wake her up, just looked at her for a long time and tried to sort out my feelings.Tried to filter out the effect of the mood drugs.Looking at her stump, I could feel neither empathy nor revulsion.I tried to force one reaction, and then the other, but nothing real happened.It was as if she had always been that way.Was it drugs; conditioning, love?Have to wait to see.Her eyes opened suddenly and I knew she had been awake for some time, had been giving me time to think.Hello, broken toy, she said.How  how do you feel?Bright question.She put a finger to her lips and kissed it, a familiar gesture, reflection.Stupid, numb.Glad not to be a soldier anymore.She smiled.Did they tell you?Were going to Heaven.No.I knew it would be either there or Earth.Heaven will be better.Anything would.I wish we were there now.How long?I asked.How long before we get there?She rolled over and looked at the ceiling.No telling.You havent talked to anybody?Just woke up.Theres a new directive they didnt bother to tell us about before.The Sangrey Victoria got orders for four missions.We have to keep on fighting until weve done all four.Or until weve sustained so many casualties that it wouldnt be practical to go on.How many is that?I wonder.We lost a good third already.But were headed for Aleph 7.Panty raid.New slang term for the type of operation whose main object was to gather Tauran artifacts, and prisoners if possible.I tried to find out where the term came from, but the one explanation I got was really idiotic.One knock on the door and Dr.Foster barged in.He fluttered his hands.Still in separate beds?Marygay, I thought you were more recovered than that.Foster was all right.A flaming mariposa, but he had an amused tolerance for heterosexuality.He examined Marygays stump and then mine.He stuck thermometers in our mouths so we couldnt talk.When he spoke, he was serious and blunt.Im not going to sugarcoat anything for you.Youre both on happy juice up to your ears, and the loss youve sustained isnt going to bother you until I take you off the stuff.For my own convenience Im keeping you drugged until you get to Heaven.I have twenty one amputees to take care of.We cant handle twenty one psychiatric cases.Enjoy your peace of mind while you still have it.You two especially, since youll probably want to stay together.The prosthetics you get on Heaven will work just fine, but every time you look at his mechanical leg or you look at her arm, youre going to think of how lucky the other one is.Youre going to constantly trigger memories of pain and loss for each other  You may be at each others throats in a week.Or you may share a sullen kind of love for the rest of your lives.Or you may be able to transcend it.Give each other strength.Just dont kid yourselves if it doesnt work out.He checked the readout on each thermometer and made a notation in his notebook.Doctor knows best, even if he is a little weird by your own old fashioned standards.Keep it in mind.He took the thermometer out of my mouth and gave me a little pat on the shoulder.Impartially, he did the same to Marygay.At the door, he said, Weve got collapsar insertion in about six hours.One of the nurses will take you to the tanks.We went into the tanks  so much more comfortable and safer than the old individual acceleration shells  and dropped into the Tet 2 collapsar field already starting the crazy fifty gee evasive maneuvers that would protect us from enemy cruisers when we popped out by Aleph 7, a microsecond later.Predictably, the Aleph 7 campaign was a dismal failure, and we limped away from it with a two campaign total of fifty four dead and thirty nine cripples bound for Heaven.Only twelve soldiers were still able to fight, but they werent exactly straining at the leash.It took three collapsar jumps to get to Heaven.No ship ever went there directly from a battle, even though the delay sometimes cost extra lives.It was the one place besides Earth that the Taurans could not be allowed to find.Heaven was a lovely, unspoiled Earth like world; what Earth might have been like if men had treated her with compassion instead of lust.Virgin forests, white beaches, pristine deserts.The few dozen cities there either blended perfectly with the environment (one was totally underground) or were brazen statements of human ingenuity; Oceanus, in a coral reef with six fathoms of water over its transparent roof, Boreas, perched on a sheared off mountaintop in the polar wasteland; and the fabulous Skye, a huge resort city that floated from continent to continent on the trade winds.We landed, as everyone does, at the jungle city, Threshold.Three fourths hospital, its by far the planets largest city, but you couldnt tell that from the air, flying down from orbit.The only sign of civilization was a short runway that suddenly appeared, a small white patch dwarfed to insignificance by the stately rain forest that crowded in from the east and an immense ocean that dominated the other horizon.Once under the arboreal cover, the city was very much in evidence.Low buildings of native stone and wood rested among ten meter thick tree trunks.They were connected by unobtrusive stone paths, with one wide promenade meandering off to the beach.Sunlight filtered down in patches, and the air held a mixture of forest sweetness and salt tang.I later learned that the city sprawled out over 200 square kilometers, that you could take a subway to anyplace that was too far to walk.The ecology of Threshold was very carefully balanced and maintained so as to resemble the jungle outside, with all the dangerous and uncomfortable elements eliminated.A powerful pressor field kept out large predators and such insect life as was not necessary for the health of the plants inside.We walked, limped and rolled into the nearest building, which was the hospitals reception area.The rest of the hospital was underneath, thirty subterranean stories.Each person was examined and assigned his own room; I tried to get a double with Marygay, but they werent set up for that.Earth year was 2189.So I was 215 years old, God, look at that old codger.Somebody pass the hat  no, not necessary.The doctor who examined me said that my accumulated pay would be transferred from Earth to Heaven.With compound interest, I was just shy of being a billionaire.He remarked that Id find lots of ways to spend my billion on Heaven.They took the most severely wounded first, so it was several days before I went into surgery.Afterwards, I woke up in my room and found that they had grafted a prosthesis onto my stump, an articulated structure of shiny metal that to my untrained eye looked exactly like the skeleton of a leg and foot.It looked creepy as hell, lying there in a transparent bag of fluid, wires running out of it to a machine at the end of the bed.An aide came in.How you feelin, sir?I almost told him to forget the sir bullshit, I was out of the army and staying out this time.But it might be nice for the guy to keep feeling that I outranked him.I dont know.Hurts a little.Gonna hurt like a sonuvabitch.Waitll the nerves start to grow.Nerves?Sure.He was fiddling with the machine, reading dials on the other side.How you gonna have a leg without nerves?Itd just sit there.Nerves?Like regular nerves?You mean I can just thinkmove and the thing moves?Course you can.He looked at me quizzically, then went back to his adjustments.What a wonder.Prosthetics has sure come a long way.Pross what ics?You know, artificial  Oh yeah, like in books.Wooden legs, hooks and stuff.Howd he ever get a job?Yeah, prosthetics.Like this thing on the end of my stump.Look, sir.He set down the clipboard hed been scribbling on.Youve been away a long time.Thats gonna be a leg, just like the other leg except it cant break.They do it with arms, too?Sure, any limb.He went back to his writing.Livers, kidneys, stomachs, all kinds of things.Still working on hearts and lungs, have to use mechanical substitutes.Fantastic.Marygay would be whole again, too.He shrugged.Guess so.Theyve been doing it since before I was born.How old are you, sir?I told him, and he whistled.Goddamn.You musta been in it from the beginning.His accent was very strange.All the words were right but all the sounds were wrong.Yeah.I was in the Epsilon attack.Aleph null.Theyd started naming collapsars after letters of the Hebrew alphabet, in order of discovery, then ran out of letters when the damn things started cropping up all over the place.So they added numbers after the letters; last I heard, they were up to Yod 42.Wow, ancient history.What was it like back then?I dont know.Less crowded, nicer.Went back to Earth a year ago, hell, a century ago.Depends on how you look at it.It was so bad I re enlisted, you know?Bunch of zombies.No offense.He shrugged.Never been there, myself.People who come from there seem to miss it.Maybe it got better.What, you were born on another planet?Heaven?No wonder I couldnt place his accent.Born, raised and drafted.He put the pen back in his pocket and folded the clipboard up to a wallet sized package.Yes, sir.Third generation angel.Best damned planet in all UNEF.He spelled it out, didnt say youneff the way Id always heard it.Look, Ive gotta run, lieutenant.Two other monitors to check, this hour.He backed out the door.You need anything, theres a buzzer on the table there.Third generation angel.His grandparents came from Earth, probably when I was a young punk of a hundred.I wondered how many other worlds theyd colonized while my back was turned.Lose an arm, grow a new one?It was going to be good to settle down and live a whole year for every year that went by.The guy wasnt kidding about the pain.And it wasnt just the new leg, though that hurt like boiling oil.For the new tissues to take theyd had to subvert my bodys resistance to alien cells; cancer broke out in a half dozen places and had to be treated separately, painfully.I was feeling pretty used up, but it was still kind of fascinating to watch the leg grow.White threads turned into blood vessels and nerves, first hanging a little slack, then moving into place as the musculature grew up around the metal bone.I got used to seeing it grow, so the sight never repelled me.But when Marygay came to visit, it was a jolt  she was ambulatory before the skin on her new arm had started to grow; looked like a walking anatomy demonstration.I got over the shock, though, and she eventually came in for a few hours every day to play games or trade gossip or just sit and read, her arm slowly growing inside the plastic cast.Id had skin for a week before they uncased the new leg and trundled the machine away.It was ugly as hell, hairless and dead white, stiff as a metal rod.But it worked, after a fashion.I could stand up and shuffle along.They transferred me to orthopedics, for range and motion repatterning  a fancy name for slow torture.They strap you into a machine that bends both the old and new legs simultaneously.The new one resists.Marygay was in a nearby section, having her arm twisted methodically.It must have been even worse on her; she looked gray and haggard every afternoon, when we met to go upstairs and sunbathe in the broken shade.As the days went by, the therapy became less like torture and more like strenuous exercise.We both began swimming for an hour or so every clear day, in the calm, pressor guarded water off the beach.I still limped on land, but in the water I could get around pretty well.The only real excitement we had on Heaven  excitement to our combat blunted sensibilities  was in that carefully guarded water.They have to turn off the pressor field for a split second every time a ship lands; otherwise it would just ricochet off over the ocean.Every now and then an animal slips in, but the dangerous land animals are too slow to get through.Not so in the sea.The undisputed master of Heavens oceans is an ugly customer that the angels, in a fit of originality, named the shark.It could eat a stack of earth sharks for breakfast, though.The one that got in was an average sized white shark who had been bumping around the edge of the pressor field for days, tormented by all that protein splashing around inside.Fortunately, theres a warning siren two minutes before the pressor is shut down, so nobody was in the water when he came streaking through.And streak through he did, almost beaching himself in the fury of his fruitless attack.He was twelve meters of flexible muscle with a razorsharp tail at one end and a collection of arm length fangs at the other.His eyes, big yellow globes, were set on stalks more than a meter out from his head.His mouth was so wide that, open, a man could comfortably stand in it.Make an impressive photo for his heirs.They couldnt just turn off the pressor field and wait for the thing to swim away.So the Recreation Committee organized a hunting party.I wasnt too enthusiastic about offering myself up as an hors doeuvre to a giant fish, but Marygay had spearfished a lot as a kid growing up in Florida and was really excited by the prospect.I went along with the gag when I found out how they were doing it; seemed safe enough.These sharks supposedly never attack people in boats.Two people who had more faith in fishermens stories than I had gone out to the edge of the pressor field in a rowboat, armed only with a side of beef.They kicked the meat overboard and the shark was there in a flash.This was the cue for us to step in and have our fun.There were twenty three of us fools waiting on the beach with flippers, masks, breathers and one spear each.The spears were pretty formidable, though, jet propelled and with high explosive heads.We splashed in and swam in phalanx, underwater, toward the feeding creature.When it saw us at first, it didnt attack.It tried to hide its meal, presumably so that some of us wouldnt be able to sneak around and munch on it while the shark was dealing with the others.But every time he tried for the deep water, hed bump into the pressor field.He was obviously getting pissed off.Finally, he just let go of the beef, whipped around and charged.Great sport.He was the size of your finger one second, way down there at the other end of the field, then suddenly as big as the guy next to you and closing fast.Maybe ten of the spears hit him  mine didnt  and they tore him to shreds.But even after an expert, or lucky, brain shot that took off the top of his head and one eye, even with half his flesh and entrails scattered in a bloody path behind him, he slammed into our line and clamped his jaws around a woman, grinding off both of her legs before it occurred to him to die.We carried her, barely alive, back to the beach, where an ambulance was waiting.They poured her full of blood surrogate and Noshocko and rushed her to the hospital, where she survived to eventually go through the agony of growing new legs.I decided that I would leave the hunting of fish to other fish.Most of our stay at Threshold, once the therapy became bearable, was pleasant enough.No military discipline, lots of reading and things to putter around with.But there was a pall over it, since it was obvious that we werent out of the army; just pieces of broken equipment that they were fixing up to throw back into the fray.Marygay and I each had another three years to serve in our lieutenancys.But we did have six months of rest and recreation coming once our new limbs were pronounced in good working order.Marygay was released two days before I was but waited around for me.My back pay came to $892,746,012.Not in, the form of bales of currency, fortunately; on Heaven they used an electronic credit exchange, so I carried my fortune around in a little machine with a digital readout.To buy something you punched in the vendors credit number and the amount of purchase; the sum was automatically shuffled from your account to his.The machine was the size of a slender wallet and coded to your thumbprint.Heavens economy was governed by the continual presence of thousands of resting, recreating millionaire soldiers.A modest snack would cost a hundred bucks, a room for a night at least ten times that.Since UNEF built and owned Heaven, this runaway inflation was pretty transparently a simple way of getting our accumulated pay back into the economic mainstream.We had fun, desperate fun.We rented a flyer and camping gear and went off for weeks, exploring the planet.There were icy rivers to swim and lush jungles to crawl through; meadows and mountains and polar wastes and deserts.We could be totally protected from the environment by adjusting our individual pressor fields  sleep naked in a blizzard  or we could take nature straight.At Marygays suggestion, the last thing we did before coming back to civilization was to climb a pinnacle in the desert, fasting for several days to heighten our sensibilities (or warp our perceptions, Im still not sure), and sit back to back in the searing heat, contemplating the languid flux of life.Then off to the fleshpots.We toured every city on the planet, and each had its own particular charm, but we finally returned to Skye to spend the rest of our leave time.The rest of the planet was bargain basement compared to Skye.In the four weeks we were using the airborne pleasure dome as our home base, Marygay and I each went through a good half billion dollars.We gambled  sometimes losing a million dollars or more in a night  ate and drank the finest the planet had to offer, and sampled every service and product that wasnt too bizarre for our admittedly archaic tastes.We each had a personal servant whose salary was rather more than that of a major general.Desperate fun, as I said.Unless the war changed radically, our chances of surviving the next three years were microscopic.We were remarkably healthy victims of a terminal disease, trying to cram a lifetime of sensation into a half of a year.We did have the consolation, not small, that however short the remainder of our lives would be, we would at least be together.For some reason it never occurred to me that even that could be taken from us.* * *   We were enjoying a light lunch in the transparent first floor of Skye, watching the ocean glide by underneath us, when a messenger bustled in and gave us two envelopes: our orders.Marygay had been bumped to captain, and I to major, on the basis of our military records and tests we had taken at Threshold.I was a company commander and she was a companys executive officer.But they werent the same company.She was going to muster with a new company being formed right here on Heaven.I was going back to Stargate for indoctrination and education before taking command.For a long time we couldnt say anything.Im going to protest, I said finally, weakly.They cant make me a commander.Into a commander.She was still struck dumb.This was not just a separation.Even if the war was over and we left for Earth only a few minutes apart, in different ships, the geometry of the collapsar jump would pile up years between us.When the second one arrived on Earth, his partner would probably be a half century older; more probably dead.We sat there for some time, not touching the exquisite food, ignoring the beauty around us and beneath us, only conscious of each other and the two sheets of paper that separated us with a gulf as wide and real as death.We went back to Threshold.I protested but my arguments were shrugged off.I tried to get Marygay assigned to my company, as my exec.They said my personnel had all been allotted.I pointed out that most of them probably hadnt even been born yet.Nevertheless, allotted, they said.It would be almost a century, I said, before I even get to Stargate.They replied that Strike Force Command plans in terms of centuries.Not in terms of people.We had a day and a night together.The less said about that, the better.It wasnt just losing a lover.Marygay and I were each others only link to real life, the Earth of the 1980s and 90s.Not the perverse grotesquerie we were supposedly fighting to preserve.When her shuttle took off it was like a casket rattling down into a grave.I commandeered computer time and found out the orbital elements of her ship and its departure time; found out I could watch her leave from our desert.I landed on the pinnacle where we had starved together and, a few hours before dawn, watched a new star appear over the western horizon, flare to brilliance and fade as it moved away, becoming just another star, then a dim star, and then nothing.I walked to the edge and looked down the sheer rock face to the dim frozen rippling of dunes half a kilometer below.I sat with my feet dangling over the edge, thinking nothing, until the suns oblique rays illuminated the dunes in a soft, tempting chiaroscuro of low relief Twice I shifted my weight as if to jump.When I didnt, it was not for fear of pain or loss.The pain would be only a bright spark and the loss would be only the armys.And it would be their ultimate victory over me having ruled my life for so long, to force an end to it.That much, I owed to the enemy.MAJOR MANDELLA  24583143 A. D.1  What was that old experiment they told us about in high school biology?Take a flatworm and teach it how to swim through a maze.Then mash it up and feed it to a stupid flatworm, and look the stupid flatworm would be able to swim the maze, too.I had a bad taste of major general in my mouth.Actually, I supposed they had refined the techniques since my high school days.With time dilation, that was about 450 years for research and development.At Stargate, my orders said, I was to undergo indoctrination and education prior to taking command of my very own Strike Force.Which was what they still called a company.For my education on Stargate, they didnt mince up major generals and serve them to me with hollandaise.They didnt feed me anything except glucose for three weeks.Glucose and electricity.They shaved every hair off my body, gave me a shot that turned me into a dishrag, attached dozens of electrodes to my head and body, immersed me in a tank of oxygenated fluorocarbon, and hooked me up to an ALSC.Thats an accelerated life situation computer.It kept me busy.I guess it took the machine about ten minutes to review everything I had learned previously about the martial (excuse the expression) arts.Then it started in on the new stuff.I learned the best way to use every weapon from a rock to a nova bomb.Not just intellectually; thats what all those electrodes were for.Cybernetically controlled negative feedback kinesthesia; I felt the weapons in my hands and watched my performance with them.And did it over and over until I did it right.The illusion of reality was total.I used a spear thrower with a band of Masai warriors on a village raid, and when I looked down at my body it was long and black.I relearned epee from a cruel looking man in foppish clothes, in an eighteenth century French courtyard.I sat quietly in a tree with a Sharps rifle and sniped at blue uniformed men as they crawled across a muddy field toward Vicksburg.In three weeks I killed several regiments of electronic ghosts.It seemed more like a year to me, but the ALSC does strange things to your sense of time.Learning to use useless exotic weapons was only a small part of the training.In fact, it was the relaxing part.Because when I wasnt in kinesthesia, the machine kept my body totally inert and zapped my brain with four millennias worth of military facts and theories.And I couldnt forget any of it!Not while I was in the tank.Want to know who Scipio Aemilianus was?I dont.Bright light of the Third Punic War.War is the province of danger and therefore courage above all things is the first quality of a warrior, von Clausewitz maintained.And Ill never forget the poetry of the advance party minus normally moves in a column formation with the platoon headquarters leading, followed by a laser squad, the heavy weapons squad, and the remaining laser squad; the column relies on observation for its flank security except when the terrain and visibility dictate the need for small security detachments to the flanks, in which case the advance party commander will detail one platoon sergeant and so on.Thats from Strike Force Command Small Unit Leaders Handbook, as if you could call something a handbook when it takes up two whole microfiche cards, 2,000 pages.If you want to become a thoroughly eclectic expert in a subject that repels you, join UNEF and sign up for officer training.One hundred nineteen people, and I was responsible for 118 of them.Counting myself but not counting the Commodore, who could presumably take care of herself.I hadnt met any of my company during the two weeks of physical rehabilitation that followed the ALSC session.Before our first muster I was supposed to report to the Temporal Orientation Officer.I called for an appointment and his clerk said the Colonel would meet me at the Level Six Officers Club after dinner.I went down to Six early, thinking to eat dinner there, but they had nothing but snacks.So I munched on a fungus thing that vaguely resembled escargots and took the rest of my calories in the form of alcohol.Major Mandella?Id been busily engaged in my seventh beer and hadnt seen the Colonel approach.I started to rise but he motioned for me to stay seated and dropped heavily into the chair opposite me.Im in your debt, he said.You saved me from at least half of a boring evening.He offered his hand.Jack Kynock, at your service.Colonel  Dont Colonel me and I wont Major you.We old fossils have to  keep our perspective.William.All right with me.He ordered a kind of drink Id never heard of.Where to start?Last time you were on Earth was 2007, according to the records.Thats right.Didnt like it much, did you?No.Zombies, happy robots.Well, it got better.Then it got worse, thank you.A private brought his drink, a bubbling concoction that was green at the bottom of the glass and lightened to chartreuse at the top.He sipped.Then they got better again, then worse, then  I dont know.Cycles.Whats it like now?Well  Im not really sure.Stacks of reports and such, but its hard to filter out the propaganda.I havent been back in almost two hundred years; it was pretty bad then.Depending on what you like.What do you mean?Oh, let me see.There was lots of excitement.Ever hear of the Pacifist movement?I dont think so.Hmn, the names deceptive.Actually, it was a war, a guerrilla war.I thought I could give you name, rank and serial number of every war from Troy on up.He smiled.They must have missed one.For good reason.It was run by veterans  survivors of Yod 38 and Aleph 40, I hear; they got discharged together and decided they could take on all of UNEF, Earthside.They got lots of support from the population.But didnt win.Were still here.He swirled his drink and the colors shifted.Actually, all I know is hearsay.Last time I got to Earth, the war was over, except for some sporadic sabotage.And it wasnt exactly a safe topic of conversation.It surprises me a little, I said, well, more than a little.That Earths population would do anything at all  against the governments wishes.He made a noncommittal sound.Least of all, revolution.When we were there, you couldnt get anybody to say a damned thing against the UNEF  or any of the local governments, for that matter.They were conditioned from ear to ear to accept things as they were.Ah.Thats a cyclic thing, too.He settled back in his chair.Its not a matter of technique.If they wanted to, Earths government could have total control over  every nontrivial thought and action of each citizen, from cradle to grave.They dont do it because it would be fatal.Because theres a war on.Take your own case: did you get any motivational conditioning while you were in the can?I thought for a moment.If I did, I wouldnt necessarily know about it.Thats true.Partially true.But take my word for it, they left that part of your brain alone.Any change in your attitude toward UNEF or the war, or war in general, comes only from new knowledge.Nobodys fiddled with your basic motivations.And you should know why.Names, dates, figures rattled down through the maze of new knowledge.Tet 17, Sed 21, Aleph 14.The Lazlo The Lazlo Emergency commission Report.June, 2106.Right.And by extension, your own experience on Aleph 1.Robots dont make good soldiers.They would, I said.Up to the twenty first century.Behavioral conditioning would have been the answer to a generals dream.Make up an army with all the best features of the SS, the Praetorian Guard, the Golden Horde.Mosbys Raiders, the Green Berets.He laughed over his glass.Then put that army up against a squad of men in modern fighting suits.Itd be over in a couple of minutes.So long as each man in the squad kept his head about, him.And just fought like hell to stay alive.The generation of soldiers that had precipitated the Lazlo Reports had been conditioned from birth to conform to somebodys vision of the ideal fighting man.They worked beautifully as a team, totally bloodthirsty, placing no great importance on personal survival  and the Taurans cut them to ribbons.The Taurans also fought with no regard for self.But they were better at it, and there were always more of them.Kynock took a drink and watched the colors.Ive seen your psych profile, he said.Both before you got here and after your session in the can.Its essentially the same, before and after.Thats reassuring.I signaled for another beer.Maybe it shouldnt be.What, it says I wont make a good officer?I told them that from the beginning.Im no leader.Right in a way, wrong in a way.Want to know what that profile says?I shrugged.Classified, isnt it?Yes, he said.But youre a major now.You can pull the profile of anybody in your command.I dont suppose it has any big surprises.But I was a little curious.What animal isnt fascinated by a mirror?No.It says youre a pacifist.A failed one at that, which gives you a mild neurosis.Which you handle by transferring the burden of guilt to the army.The fresh beer was so cold it hurt my teeth.No surprises yet.And as far as being a leader, you do have a certain potential.But it would be along the lines of a teacher or a minister; you would have to lead from empathy, compassion.You have the desire to impose your ideas on other people, but not your will.Which means, youre right, youll make one hell of a bad officer unless you shape up.I had to laugh.UNEF must have known all of this when they ordered me to officer training.There are other parameters, he said.For instance, youre adaptable, reasonably intelligent, analytical.And youre one of the eleven people whos lived through the whole war.Surviving is a virtue in a private.Couldnt resist it.But an officer should provide gallant example.Go down with the ship.Stride the parapet as if unafraid.He harrumphed at that.Not when youre a thousand light years from your replacement.It doesnt add up, though.Why would they haul me all the way from Heaven to take a chance on myshaping up, when probably a third of the people here on Stargate are better officer material?God, the military mind!I suspect the bureaucratic mind, at least, had something to do with it.You have an embarrassing amount of seniority to be a footsoldier.Thats all time dilation.Ive only been in three campaigns.Immaterial.Besides, thats two and a half more than the average soldier survives.The propaganda boys will probably make you into some kind of a folk hero.Folk hero.I sipped at the beer.Where is John Wayne now that we really need him?John Wayne?He shook his head.I never went in the can, you know.Im no expert at military history.Forget it.Kynock finished his drink and asked the private to get him  I swear to God  a rum Antares.Well, Im supposed to be your Temporal Orientation Officer.What do you want to know about the present?What passes for the present.Still on my mind: Youve never been in the can?No, combat officers only.
