They were partway through the scrub oaks now.Coming out the far side, you could see ocean haze; on a clear day  or if you used Clear Vision  you could see all the way to the ocean.On the south were more subdivisions, and a patch of green that was Fairmont High School.On the north was the most interesting place in Juan Orozco's neighborhood:  Pyramid Hill Amusement Park dominated the little valley that surrounded it.The underlying rock was more a pointy hill than a pyramid, but the park's management thought "pyramid" was the sexier adjective.Once upon a time it had been an avocado orchard, dark green trees clothing the hillsides.You could see it that way if you used the park's logo view.To the naked eye, there were still lots of trees.But there were also lawns, and real mansions, and the launch tower.Among other things.Pyramid Hill claimed to have the longest freefall ride in California.The twins were grinning at him.Jerry waved at the hill."How would you like to play Cretaceous Returns , but with real feeling?"Pyramid Hill managers knew exactly what to charge for different levels of touchy feely experience.The low end was pretty cheap; "real feeling" was at the top."Ah, that's too expensive. ""Sure it is.If you pay. ""And, um, don't you have a project to set up before class?"The twins had shop class first thing in the morning."That's still in Vancouver," said Jerry."But don't worry about us. "Fred looked upward, somehow prayerful and smug at the same time."'UP/Express will provide, and just in time. '""Well, okay.Just so we don't get into trouble. "Getting into trouble was the major downside of hanging with the Radners.A couple of weeks earlier, the twins had shown him how to avoid a product safety recall on his new wikiBay bicycle.That had left him with a great martial arts weapon  and a bike that was almost impossible to unfold.Ma had not been pleased."Hey, don't worry, Juan. "The three left the edge of the flood channel and followed a narrow trail along the east edge of Pyramid Hill.This was far from any entrance, but the twins' uncle worked for County Flood Control and they had access to CFC utilities support imagery  which just now they shared with Juan.The dirt beneath their feet became faintly translu cent.Fifteen feet down, Juan could see graphics representing a ten inch runoff tunnel.Here and there were pointers to local maintenance records.Jerry and Fred had used such omniscience before and not been caught.Today they were blending it with a map of the local network nodes.The overlay view was faint violet against the sunlit day, showing communication blind spots and active high rate links.The two stopped at the edge of a clearing.Fred looked at Jerry."Tsk.Flood Control should be ashamed.There's not a localizer node within thirty feet. ""Yeah, Jer.Almost anything could happen here. "Without a complete localizer mesh, nodes could not know precisely where they and their neighbors were.High rate laser comm could not be established, and low rate sensor output was smeared across the landscape.The outside world knew only mushy vagueness about this area.They walked into the clearing.They were deep in a network blind spot, but from here they had a naked eye view up the hillside, to ground that must surely be within Pyramid Hill.If they continued that way, the Hill would start charging them.But the twins were not looking at the Hill.Jerry walked to a small tree and squinted up."In fact, this is an interesting spot.They tried to patch the coverage with an airball. "He pointed into the branches and pinged.The utility view showed only a faint return, an error message."It's almost purely net guano at this point. "Juan shrugged."The gap will be fixed by tonight. "Around twilight, when aerobots flitted around the canyons, swapping out nodes here and there."Well, why don't we help the county by patching things right now?"Jerry held up a thumb sized greenish object.He handed it to Juan.Three antenna fins sprouted from the thing's top.It was a typical ad hoc node.The dead ones were more trouble than bird poop."You've perv'd this thing?"The node had Breaklns R Us written all over it, but perverting networks was harder in real life than in games."Where did you get the access codes?""Uncle Don gets careless. "Jerry pointed at the device."All the permissions are loaded.Unfortunately, the bottleneck node is still alive. "He pointed upward, into the sapling's branches."You're small enough to climb this, Juan.Just go up and knock down the node. ""Hmm. ""Hey, don't worry.Homeland Security won't notice. "In fact, the Department of Homeland Security would almost certainly notice, at least after the localizer mesh was patched.But just as certainly they wouldn't care.DHS logic was deeply embedded in all hardware."See All, Know All" was their motto, but what they knew and saw was for their own mission.They were notorious about not sharing with law enforcement.Juan stepped out of the blind spot and took a look at the Sheriff's Department view.The area around Pyramid Hill had its share of arrests, mostly for enhancement drugs but there had been nothing hereabouts for several weeks."Okay. "Juan came back to the tree and scrambled up about ten feet, to where the branches spread out.The old node was hanging from rotted Velcro.He knocked it free and the twins caused it to have an accident with a rock.Juan shinnied down from the tree.They watched the diagnostics for a moment.Violet mists sharpened into bright spots as the nodes figured out where they and their perved sibling were, and coordinated up toward full function.Now point to point, laser routing was available; they could see the property labels all along the boundary of Pyramid hill."Ha," said Fred.The twins started uphill toward the property line."C'mon, Juan.We're marked as county employees.We'll be fine if we don't stay too long. "Pyramid Hill had all the latest touchy feely gear.These were not just phantoms painted by your contact lenses on the back of your eyeballs.On Pyramid Hill there were games where you could ride a Scoochi salsipued or steal the eggs of raptors  or games with warm furry creatures that danced playfully around, begging to be picked up and cuddled.If you turned off all the game views, you could see other players wandering through the woods in their own worlds.Somehow the Hill kept them from crashing into each other.In Cretaceous Returns , the sound of the free fall launcher was disguised as thunder.The trees were imaged as towering ginkgoes, with lots of places you couldn't see through.Juan played the pure visual Cret Ret a lot these days, in person with the twins, and all over the world with others.It had not been an uplifting experience.He had been "killed and eaten" three times so far this week.It was a tough game, one where you had to contribute or maybe you got killed and eaten every time.So Juan had joined the Fantasists Guild  well, as a junior wannabe member.Maybe that would make him clueful.He had already designed a species for Cret Ret .His saurians were quick, small things that didn't attract the fiercest of the critics.The twins had not been impressed, though they had no alternatives of their own.As he walked through the ginkgo forest, he kept his eye out for critters with jaws lurking in the lower branches.That's what had gotten him on Monday.On Tuesday it had been some kind of paleo disease.So far things seemed safe enough, but there was no sign of his own contribution.They had been fast breeding and scalable, so where were the little monsters?Sigh.Sometime he should check out other game sites.They might be big in Kazakhstan.Here, today nada.Juan stumped across the Hill, a little discouraged, but still uneaten.The twins had taken the form of game standard velociraptors.They were having a grand time.Their chicken sized prey were Pyramid Hill game bots.The Jerry raptor looked over its shoulder at Juan."Where's your critter?"Juan had not assumed any animal form."I'm a time traveler," he said.That was a valid type, introduced with the initial game release.Fred flashed a face full of teeth."I mean where are the critters you invented last week?""I don't know. ""Most likely they got eaten by the critics," said Jerry.The brothers did a joint reptilian chortle."Give up on making creator points, Juan.Kick back and use the good stuff. "He illustrated with a soccer kick that connected with something that scuttled across their path.That got lots of classic points and a few thrilling moments of quality carnage.Fred joined in and red splattered everywhere.There was something familiar about this prey.It was young and clever looking a newborn from Juan's own design!And that meant its mommy would be nearby.Juan said, "You know, I don't think  "  "The Problem Is, None Of You Think Nearly Enough. "The sound was premium external, like sticking your head inside an old time boom box.Too late, they saw that the tree trunks behind them grew from yard long claws.Mommy.Drool fell in ten inch blobs from high above.This was Juan's design scaled up to the max."Sh  " said Fred.It was his last hiss as a velociraptor.The head and teeth behind the slobber descended from the ginkgo canopy and swallowed Fred down to the tips of his hind talons.The monster crunched and munched for a moment.The clearing was filled with the sound of splintering bones."Ahh!"The monster opened its mouth and vomited horror.It was so good  Juan flicker viewed on reality: Fred was standing in the steaming remains of his raptor.His shirt was pulled out of his pants, and he was drenched in slime  real, smelly slime.The kind you paid money for.The monster itself was one of the Hill's largest mechanicals, tricked out as a member of Juan's new species.The three of them looked up into its jaws."Was that touchy feely enough for you?"the creature said, its breath a hot breeze of rotting meat.For sure it was.Fred stepped backwards and almost slipped on the goo."The late Fred Radner just lost a cartload of points"  the monster waved its truck sized snout at them  "and I'm still hungry.I suggest you move off the Hill with all dispatch. "They backed away, their gaze still caught on the monster's teeth.The twins turned and ran.As usual, Juan was an instant behind them.Something like a big hand grabbed him."You, I have further business with. "The words were a burred roar through clenched fangs."Sit down.Let's chat. "Caray!I have the worst luck .Then he remembered that it had been Juan Orozco who had climbed a tree to perv the Hill entrance logic.Stupid Juan Orozco didn't need bad luck; he was already the perfect chump.And now the twins were gone.But when the "jaws" set him down and he turned around, the monster was still there  not some Pyramid Hill rent a cop.Maybe this really was a Cret Ret player!He edged sideways, trying to get out from under the pendulous gaze.This was just a game.He could walk away from this four story saurian.Of course, that would trash his credit with Cretaceous Returns , maybe drench him in smelly goo.And if Big Lizard took its play seriously, it might cause him trouble in other games.Okay .He sat down with his back to the nearest ginkgo.So he would be late another day; that couldn't make his school situation any worse.The saurian settled back and slid the steaming corpse of Fred Radner's raptor to one side.It brought its head close to the ground, to look at Juan straight on.The eyes and head and color were exactly Juan's original design, and this player had the moves to make it truly impressive.He could see from its battle scars that it had fought in several Cretaceous hot spots.Juan forced a cheerful smile."So, you like my design?"It flashed yard long fangs."I've been worse. "The creature shifted game parameters, bringing up critic layer details.This was a heavy player, maybe even a game cracker!On the ground between them was a dead and dissected example of Juan's creation.Big Lizard nudged it with a foreclaw."But the skin texture is from a Fantasists Guild example library.The color scheme is a cliche.The plaid kilt would be cute if it weren't in all the Epiphany Now ads. "Juan drew his knees in toward his chin.This was the same crap he had to put up with at school."I borrow from the best. "The saurian's chuckle was a buzzing roar that made Juan's skull vibrate."That might work with your teachers.They have to eat whatever garbage you feed them  at least till you graduate and can be dumped on the street.This design is so so.There have been some adoptions, mainly because it has good mechanics.But if we're talking real quality, it just don't measure up. "The creature flexed its custom battle scars."I do other things. ""Yes, and if you never deliver, you'll fail with them, too. "That was a point that occupied a lot of Juan Orozco's internal worry time.More and more it looked like he was going to end up like his pa  only Juan might never even get a job to be laid off from!"Try your best" was the motto of Fairmont High.But trying your best was only the beginning.Even if you tried your best, you could still be left behind.These were not things he'd confess to another gamer.He glared back at the slitted yellow eyes, and suddenly it occurred to him that  unlike teachers  this guy was not being paid to be nice.And it was wasting too much time for this to be some humiliating con.It actually wants something from met Juan sharpened his glare."And you have some suggestions, O Mighty Virtual Lizard?""That could be.Besides Cret Ret , I have other things going.How would you like to take an affiliate status on a little project?"Except for local games, no one had ever asked Juan to affiliate on anything.His mouth twisted in bogus contempt."Affiliate?A percent of a percent of what?How far down the value chain are you?"The saurian shrugged and there was the sound of ginkgoes creaking against its shoulders."My guess is I'm way, way down.That's how it is with most affiliances.But I can pay real money for each answer I pipe upwards. "The creature named a number; it was enough to ride the freefall every day for a year.A payoff certificate floated in the air between them, showing the named amount and a bonus schedule.Juan had played his share of finance games."I get twice that or no deal. "Then he noticed the subrights section.The numbers were not visible.That could be because anyone he recruited would get a lot more."Done!"said the Lizard, before Juan could correct his bid upward.And Juan was sure it was smiling!  "Okay, what do you want?"And what makes you think a dwit like me can supply it ?"You're at Fairmont High, aren't you?""You already know that. ""It's a strange place, isn't it?"When Juan did not reply, the critter said."Trust me, it is strange.Most schools, even charter schools, don't schedule Adult Education students in with the children. ""Yeah, the vocational track.The old farts don't like it.We don't like it. ""Well, the task from my upstream affiliate is to snoop around, mainly among these old guys.Make friends with them. "Yecco.But Juan glanced at the payoff certificate again.It tested valid.The payoff adjudication was more complicated than he wanted to read, but it was backed by Bank of America."Who in particular?""Ah, that's the problem.Whoever is at the top of my affiliance is coy.We're just collecting information.Basically, some of these senior citizens used to be big shots. ""If they were so big, how come they're in our classes now?"It was just the question the kids asked at school."Lots of reasons, Juan.Some of them are just lonely.Some of them are up to their ears in debt, and have to figure how to make a living in the current economy.Some of them aren't good for much but a healthy body and lots of old memories.They can be very bitter. ""Unh, how do I make friends with people like that?""If you want the money, you figure out a way.Anyway, here are the search criteria. "The Big Lizard shipped him a document.He browsed through the top layer."This covers a lot of ground. "Retired San Diego politicians, bioscientists, parents of persons currently in such job categories  "There are qualifying characteristics in the links.Your job is to interest appropriate people in my affiliance. ""I I'm just not that good at talking people up. "Especially people like this."Stay poor then.Chicken. "Juan was silent for a moment.His pa would never take a job like this.Finally, he said, "Okay, I'll go affiliate with you. ""I wouldn't want you doing anything you feel un  "  "I said , I'll take the job!""Okay!Well then, what I've given you should get you started.There's contact info in the document. "The creature lumbered to its feet, and now its voice came from high above."Just as well we don't meet again on Pyramid Hill. ""Suits me. "Juan stood up.He made a point of slapping the creature's mighty tail as he walked off downhill.The twins were way ahead of him, standing by the soccer field on the other side of campus.As Juan came up the driveway, he grabbed a viewpoint in the bleachers and gave them a ping.Fred waved back, but his shirt was still too gooey for comm.Jerry was looking upward at the UP/Ex shipment falling toward his outstretched hands.Just in time, for sure.The twins were popping the mailer open even as they walked into the shop tent.Unfortunately, Juan's first class was at the end of the far wing.He ran across the lawn, keeping his vision tied to unimproved reality: The buildings were mostly three stories today.Their gray walls were like playing cards stacked in a rickety array.Inside, the choice of view was not entirely his own.Mornings, the school administration required that the Fairmont News show all over the interior walls.Three kids at Hoover High had won IBM career fellowships.Applause, applause, even if Hoover was Fairmont's unfairly advantaged rival, a charter school run by the Math Ed Department at SDSU.The three young geniuses would have their college education paid for, right through grad school, even if they never worked a day at IBM.Big deal , Juan thought, trying to comfort himself.Someday those kids might be very rich, but a percentage of their professional fortunes would always go back to IBM.He followed the little green nav arrows with half his attention and abruptly realized he had climbed two flights of stairs.School admin had re arranged everything since yesterday.Of course, they had updated his nav arrows, too.It was a good thing he hadn't been paying attention.He slipped into his classroom and sat down.Ms.Chumlig had already started.Search and Analysis was Chumlig's main thing.She used to teach a fast track version of this at Hoover High, but well documented rumor held that she just couldn't keep up.So the Department of Education had moved her to the same named course here at Fairmont.Actually, Juan kind of liked her.She was a failure, too."There are many different skills," she was saying."Sometimes it's best to coordinate with lots of other people who together can make the answers. "The students nodded.Be a coordinator.That's where the biggest and most famous money was.But they also knew where Chumlig was going with this.She looked around the classroom, nodding that she knew they knew."Alas, you all intend to be top agents, don't you?""It's what some of us will be. "That was one of the Adult Ed students.Winston Blount was old enough to be Juan's great grandfather.When Blount had a bad day he liked to liven things up by harassing Ms.Chumlig.The Search and Analysis instructor smiled back."It's about as likely as being a major league baseball star.The pure 'coordinating agent' is a rare type, Dean Blount. ""Some of us must be the administrators. ""Oh. "Chumlig looked kind of sad for a moment, like she was figuring out how to pass on bad news."Administration has changed a lot, Dean Blount. "Winston Blount sat back in his chair."Okay.So we have to learn some new tricks. ""Yes. "Ms.Chumlig looked out over the class."That's an important point.This class is about search and analysis, the heart of the economy.We obviously need search and analysis as consumers.In almost all modern jobs, search and analysis are how we make our living.But, in the end, we must also know something about something. ""Meaning those courses we got C's in, right?"That was a voice from the peanut gallery, probably someone who was physically truant.Chumlig sighed."Yes.Don't let those skills die.You've been exposed to them.Use them.Improve on them.You can do it with a special form of preanalysis that I call 'study. '"One of the students actually held up a hand.She was that old."Yes, Dr.Xiang?""I know you are correct.But  " The woman glanced around the room.She looked about Chumlig's age, not nearly as old as Winston Blount.But there was kind of a frightened look in her eyes."But some people are better than others.I'm not as sharp as I once was.Or maybe others are just sharper What happens if we try our hardest, and it just isn't good enough?"Chumlig hesitated.How will she answer this !thought Juan.It was the real question."That's a problem that affects everyone, Dr.Xiang.Providence gives each of us our hand to play.In your case, you've got a new deal and a new start on life. "Her look took in the rest of the class."Some of you think your hand in life is all deuces and treys. "At the front of the room were some really dedicated students, not much older than Juan.They were wearing, but they had no clothes sense and had never learned ensemble coding.As Chumlig spoke, you could see their fingers tapping away, searching on "deuces" and "treys. ""But I have a theory of life," said Chumlig, "and it is straight out of gaming: There is always an angle .You, each of you, have some special wild cards.Play with them.Find out what makes you different and better.Because it is there, if only you can find it.And once you do, you'll be able to contribute answers to others and others will be willing to contribute back to you.In short, synthetic serendipity doesn't just happen.By golly, you must create it. "She hesitated, staring at invisible class notes, and her voice dropped down from oratory."So much for the big picture.Today, we're going to talk about morphing answerboard solutions.As usual, we're looking to ask the right questions. "Juan liked to sit by the outer wall, especially when the classroom was on the third floor.You could feel the wall sway gently back and forth as the building kept its balance.That sort of thing made his ma real nervous."One second of system failure and everything will fall apart!"she had complained at a PTA meeting.On the other hand, house of cards construction was cheap  and it could handle a big earthquake almost as easily as it did the morning breeze.He leaned away from the wall and listened to Chumlig.That was why the school made you show up in person for most classes; you had to pay a little bit of attention just because you were trapped in a real room with a real instructor.Chumlig's lecture graphics floated in the air above them.She had the class's attention; there was a minimum of insolent graffiti nibbling at the edges of her imagery.And for a while, Juan paid attention, too.He really did.Answerboards could generate solid results, usually for zero cost.There was no affiliation, just kindred minds batting problems around.But what if you weren't a kindred mind?Say you were on a genetics board.If you thought transcription was a type of translation, it could take you months to get anywhere.So Juan tuned her out and wandered from viewpoint to viewpoint around the room.Some were from students who'd set their viewpoints public.Most were just random cams.He browsed Big Lizard's task document as he paused between hops.In fact, the Lizard was interested in more than just the old farts.Some ordinary students made the list, too.This affiliance must be as wide as the California Lottery.He started some background checks.Like most kids, he kept lots of stuff saved on his wearable.He could run a search like this very close to his vest.He didn't route to the outside world except when he could use a site that Chumlig was talking about.She was real good at nailing the mentally truant.But Juan was good at ensemble coding, driving his wearable with little gesture cues and eye pointer menus.As her gaze passed over him, he nodded brightly and replayed the last few seconds of her talk.As for the old students competent retreads would never be here; they'd be rich and famous, the people who owned most of the real world.The ones in Adult Education were the has beens.These people trickled into Fairmont all through the semester.The oldfolks hospitals refused to batch them up for the beginning of classes.They claimed that senior citizens were "socially mature," able to handle the jumble of a midsemester entrance.Juan went from face to face, matching against public records: Winston Blount.The guy was a saggy mess.Retread medicine was such a crapshoot.Some things it could cure, others it couldn't.And what worked was different from person to person.Winston Blount had not been a total winner.Just now the old guy was squinting intensely, trying to follow Chumlig's answerboard example.He had been in several of Juan's classes.Juan couldn't see the guy's med records, but he guessed that his mind was mostly okay; he was as sharp as some of the kids in class.And once upon a time he had been an important player at UCSD.Once upon a time.Okay, put him on the "of interest" list.And then there was Xiu Xiang.PhD physics, PhD electrical engineering; 2010 Winner of the President's Medal for Secure Computation.Overall the hotstuff index on her was almost Nobel quality.Dr.Xiang sat hunched over, looking at the table in front of her.She was trying to keep up on a view page !Poor lady.But for sure she would have connections.Chumlig was still going on about how to morph results into new questions, oblivious of Juan's truancy.Who's next?Robert Gu.For a moment, Juan thought he had the wrong viewpoint.He sneaked a glance to his right, toward where the Adult Education crocks hung out.Robert Gu, PhD literature.A poet.He was sitting with the crocks, but he looked about seventeen years old!Juan brought his apparent attention back to Ms.Chumlig and inspected the new arrival close up.Gu was slender, almost scrawny, and tall.His skin was smooth and unblemished.But he looked like he was sweating.Juan risked a peek at outside medical references.Aha !Symptoms of the Venn Kurasawa treatment.Dr.Robert Gu was a lucky man, the one in a thousand who fully responded to that piece of retread magic.On the other hand, it looked to Juan like the guy had run out of luck after that.He was fully unpingable.There was a crumpled piece of view page on his desk, but he wasn't using it.Years ago, this guy had been more famous than Xiu Xiang, but he was an even bigger loser now What was "Deconstructive Revisionism" anyway?Oh.Definitely not something on the Big Lizard's list.Juan slid the name into the trashcan.But wait, he hadn't checked out Gu's family connections.He queried  and suddenly there was silent messaging hanging in letters of silent flame all across his vision:  Chumlig  > Orozco: <sm>You have all day to play games, Juan!If you won't pay attention here, you can darn well take this course over.</sm>  Orozco  > Chumlig: <sm>Sorry.Sorry!</sm> He suspended his question queue and dropped the external session.At the same time, he played back the last few minutes of her talk, desperately trying to summarize.Most times, Chumlig just asked embarrassing questions; this was the first she'd sminged him with a threat.And the amazing thing was, she'd done it in a short pause, when everyone else thought she was just looking at her notes.Juan eyed her with new respect."You were A little hard on the boy, don't you think?"Rabbit was trying out new imagery today, this based on classic Alice in Wonderland illustrations, complete with engraving lines.The effect was fully silly on a three dimensional body.Big Lizard did not seem impressed."You don't belong down here.Juan is my direct affiliate, not yours. ""A bit overly sensitive, aren't you?I'm simply spot checking the depths of my affiliance. ""Well, stay out.Juan needs this class. ""Of course I share your charitable motives. "The rabbit gave the lizard his most dishonest leer."But you cut him off just when he was looking at someone especially interesting to me.I have provided you with a most excellent affiliance.If you want my continued support, you must cooperate. ""Listen you!I want the boy to reach out for himself, but I don't want him to be hurt. "Lizard's voice trailed off, and Rabbit wondered if Chumlig was finally having second thoughts.Not that it mattered.Rabbit was having fun, spreading out across the Southern California social scene.Sooner or later, he would figure out what this job was all about.05    Dr.Xiang's SHE  Shop class.It was by far Juan Orozco's favorite class.Shop was like a premium game; there were real gadgets to touch and connect.That was the sort of thing you paid money for up on Pyramid Hill.And Mr.Williams was no Louise Chumlig.He let you follow your own inclinations, but he never came around afterward and complained because you hadn't accomplished anything.It was almost impossible not to get an A in Ron Williams's classes; he was wonderfully old fashioned.Shop class was also Juan's best opportunity to make progess on Big Lizard's project, at least with the old farts and the do not call privacy freaks.He wandered around the big gadget tent looking like an utter idiot.Juan had never been any good at diplomacy games.And now he was schmoozing oldsters.Well, trying to.Xiu Xiang was really a nice lady, but she just sat at the equipment bench and read from her view page.She had the parts list formatted like some kind of hardcopy catalog."Once I knew these things," she said."See that. "She pointed at a section in the museum pages: Xiang's Secure Hardware Environment ."I designed that system. "Juan came up with "You're world class, Dr.Xiang. ""But I don't understand even the principles of these new components.They look more like pond scum than self respecting optical semiconductors. "She read one of the product descriptions, stopped at the third line."What's redundant entanglement?""Ah. "He looked it up, saw pointers into jungles of background concepts."You don't need to know about 'redundant entanglement,' ma'am.Not for this class. "He waved at the product descriptions on Xiang's view page.The image sat like carven stone, not responding to his gesture."Go forward a few pages, you'll find the stuff we have available here in class.Look under"  jeez this was a pain, spelling out navigation in words  "look under 'fun functional compositions,' and go from there. "He showed her how to use her view page to ID local parts."You don't need to understand everything. ""Oh. "In a few moments she was playing with the possibilities, had downloaded half a dozen component gadgets."This is like being a child.Doing, without understanding. "But then she started putting Buildlt parts together, doing pretty well after Juan showed her how to find the interface specs.She laughed at some of the descriptions."Sorters and shifters.Solid state robots.I bet I could make a cutter out of this. ""I don't see it. "Cutter?"Don't worry, you can't hurt anything. "That wasn't quite true, but close enough.He sat and watched, made a few suggestions, even though he wasn't really sure what she was up to.Enough of establishing rapport; he marked that box in his diplomacy checklist and moved on to the next stage."So, Dr.Xiang, do you keep in touch with your friends at Intel?""That was a long time ago.I retired in 2010.And during the war, I couldn't even get consulting jobs.I could just feel my skills rusting out. ""Alzheimer's?"He knew she was much older than she looked, even older than Winston Blount.Xiang hesitated, and for a moment Juan was afraid he had made the lady really angry.But then she gave a sad little laugh."No Alzheimer's, no dementia.You  people nowadays don't know what it was like to be old. ""I do so!All my grandparents are still alive.And I have a great grandpa in Puebla.He plays a lot of golf.Great Grandma, she does have dementia  you know, a kind they still can't fix. "In fact, Great Grandma had looked as young as Dr.Xiang.Everyone thought she had really lucked out.But in the end that only meant she lived long enough to run into something they couldn't cure.Dr.Xiang just shook her head."Even in my day, not everyone went senile, not the way you mean.I just got behind in my skills.My girlfriend died.After a while I just didn't care too much.I didn't have the energy to care. "She looked at the gadget she was building."Now, I have at least the energy I had when I was sixty.Maybe I even have the same native intelligence. "She slapped the table."And all I'm good for is playing with jacked up Lego blocks!"It almost looked like she was going to start crying, right in the middle of shop class.Juan scanned around; no one seemed to be watching.He reached out to touch Xiang's hand.He didn't have the answer.Ms.Chumlig would say he didn't have the right question.There were still a few others to check out: Winston Blount, for instance.Not a jackpot case, but he ought to be worth something to the Lizard.In shop class, Blount just sat in the shade of the tent, staring off into space.The guy was wearing, but he didn't respond to messages.Juan waited until Williams went off for one of his coffee breaks.Then he sidled over and sat beside Blount.Jeez, the guy really looked old.Juan couldn't tell exactly where he was surfing, but it had nothing to do with shop class.Juan had noticed that when Blount wasn't interested in a class, he just blew it off.After a few minutes' silence, Juan realized that he wasn't interested in socializing either.So talk to him!It's just another kind of monster whacking .Juan mor phed a buffoon image onto the guy, and suddenly it wasn't so hard to cold start the encounter."So, Dean Blount, what do you think of shop class?"Ancient eyes turned to look at him."I couldn't care less, Mr.Orozco. "O kay !Hmm.There was lots about Winston Blount that was public record, even some legacy newsgroup correspondence.That was always good for getting a grown up's, um, attention.Fortunately, Blount continued talking on his own."I'm not like some of the people here.I've never been senile.By rights, I shouldn't be here. ""By rights?"Maybe he could score points just by imitating an old time shrink program."Yes.I was Dean of Arts and Letters through 2012.I was on track to be UCSD Chancellor.Instead I was pushed into academic retirement. "Juan knew all that."But you you never learned to wear. "Blount's eyes narrowed."I made it a point never to wear.I thought wearing was a demeaning fad. "He shrugged."I was wrong.I paid a heavy price for that.But things have changed. "His eyes glittered with deliberate iridescence."I've taken four semesters of this 'Adult Education. 'Now my resume is out there in the ether. ""You must know a lot of important people. ""Indeed.Success is just a matter of time. ""Y You know, Dean, I may be able to help.No wait  I don't mean by myself.I have an affiliance you might be interested in. ""Oh?"He seemed to know what affiliance was.Juan explained Big Lizard's deal."So there could be some real money in this. "He showed him the payoff certificates, and wondered how much his recruit would see there.Blount squinted his eyes, no doubt trying to parse the certificates into a form that Bank of America could validate.After a moment he nodded, without granting Juan numerical enlightenment."But money isn't everything, especially in my situation. ""Well, um, I bet whoever's behind these certs would have a lot of angles.Maybe you could get a conversion to help in kind.I mean, to something you need. ""True. "They talked a few minutes, till the place got busy.Some of the shop projects were finally showing results.At least two teams had made mobile nodes, swarm devices.Tiny paper wings fluttered all around.The other swarmer crawled in the grass and up the legs of the furniture and chairs.It stayed out of clothes, but it was awfully close to being intrusive.Juan zapped a few of them, but the others kept coming.Orozco  > Blount: <sm>Can you read me?</sm>  "Of course I can," replied the old man.So despite Blount's claims of withittude, he couldn't manage silent messaging, not even the finger tapping most grown ups used.The class period was almost over anyway.Juan looked up at the billowing tent fabric.He was a little discouraged.He had covered almost everyone on the list, and Winston Blount was the best he'd found: someone who couldn't even sming."Okay.Well, keep my offer in mind, Dean Blount.And remember, there are only a limited number of people I'm allowed to take in. "Blount rewarded this sales jabber with a thin smile."Meantime, I I have other possibilities. "Juan nodded in the direction of the weird new guy, Robert Gu.Winston Blount didn't follow Juan's gaze, but you could tell he was sneaking a peek sideways.For a moment the skin on his face seemed to tighten.Then the smile returned."May God have mercy on your soul, Mr.Orozco. "Juan didn't get his chance at Robert Gu till Friday, right after Ms.Chumlig's other class.Creative Composition was almost always the low point of Juan's school week.Chumlig was flexible as to media, but students had to stand up and perform their own work.That was bad enough when you had to watch some other kid mess up, but unbearable when you were the performer.Order of appearance was decided at Ms.Chumlig's whim.Normally worrying about that would have occupied most of Juan's attention.Today, he had other concerns that mercifully blotted out the usual panic.Juan skulked to the back of the class and slumped down, covertly watching the others.Winston Blount was here, which was a surprise.He blew off this class almost as often as he did shop.But he took me up on my offer .The Lizard's account showed that the old man had taken his first step toward signing on.On the far side of the room, Robert Gu was surfing with his view page.Even that looked like a struggle for the guy.But it turned out that Gu was part of a particular Marine Corps family  and when Juan had reviewed all of the affiliation instructions he had found that that was a big plus.If he could just interest Robert Gu in affiliation, he'd hit the top bonus level.Chumlig's voice cut across his thought."No volunteers for first up?Well  " she looked off into the air, and then turned to Juan.Caray!06    So Much Technology, So Little Talent  Chumlig's "Creative Composition" class was shaping up to be the low point of Robert Gu's first week at Fairmont High.Robert remembered his own high school years very well.In 1965, school had been easy, except for math and science, which he didn't care about anyway.Basically, he never did homework in anything.But the poems he wrote, almost without conscious effort, were already in a different world from what his poor teachers normally encountered.They considered themselves blessed to be in his presence  and rightly so.But in this brave new world he could see only a fraction of the "compositions" the students allegedly created, and he had no doubt they could appreciate very little about his work.Robert sat at the edge of the class, doodling on his view page.As usual, the children were on the left side of the room, and the Adult Ed students were on the right.Losers.He had learned a few names, even talked to the Xiang woman.She said she was going to have to drop Chumlig's composition class.She just didn't have the courage to perform in front of others.The only talent she had was in obsolete engineering, but at least she was smart enough to know she was a loser.Not like Winston Blount, the biggest loser of all.Occasionally he caught Winnie looking his way, and Robert would smile to himself.At the front of the class, Ms.Chumlig was coaxing today's first performer."I know you've been practicing, Juan.Show us what you can do. ""Juan" stood and walked to center stage.This was the kid who had been chatting up the Adult Ed students in shop class.Robert remembered his earnest sales rep behavior.At a guess, the boy was on the low side of average, the kind that high schools of Robert's time graduated pro forma.But here, in the twenty first century, incompetence was no excuse: Chumlig seemed to have serious expectations.The boy hesitated and then began waving his arms.Without any visible effect."I don' know, Ms.Chumlig, it's still not, um, fully ready. "Ms.Chumlig just nodded patiently, and gestured for him to continue."Okay. "The boy squinted his eyes and his armwaving became even more chaotic.It wasn't dance, and the boy wasn't speaking.But Chumlig leaned back against her desk, and nodded.Much of the class watched the random mime with similar attention, and Robert noticed that they were nodding their heads as if in time to music.Crap .More invisible nonsense.Robert looked down at his magic foolscap and played with the local browser selections.Internet Explorer was much as he remembered, but there were dropdowns that allowed him to "Select View. "Yes, the fantasy overlays.He tapped on "Juan Orozco Performs. "The first overlay looked like graffiti, rude commentary on Juan's performance.It was the sort of thing you might see on a note passed furtively from child to child.He tapped the second view selection.Ah.Here the boy stood on a concert stage.The classroom windows behind him opened onto a vast city as seen from a high tower.Robert held his hand along the margin of the page, and there was sound.It was tinny and faint compared with the room audio back in the house, but yes, it was music.It was almost Wagner, but then it rambled off into something that might have been a marching song.In the window on Robert's view page, rainbows formed around the boy's image.Fluffy white  ferrets ?hopped into existence at every jerk of his hands.Now all the other kids were laughing.Juan was laughing too, but his handwaving became desperate.Ferrets covered the floor, shoulder to shoulder, and the music was frenetic.The creatures misted together into snow and lifted on miniature tornadoes.The boy slowed his rhythm, and the sound became something like lullaby music.The snow glistened, sublimating into invisibility as the music faded.And now Robert's browser window showed the same unmagical child who stood in reality at the front of the room.Juan's peers applauded politely.One or two yawned."Very good, Juan!"said Ms.Chumlig.It was as impressive as any advertising video that Robert had seen in the twentieth century.At the same time it was essentially incoherent, a garbage dump of special effects.So much technology, so little talent.Chumlig talked the class through the components of Orozco's effort, gently asking the boy where he was going to take his work, suggesting that he collaborate (collaborate!)with other students in putting words to the composition.Robert looked surreptitiously about the room.The windows were opened onto the brown and sere hillsides of North County autumn.Out there, sunlight was everywhere, and a slow breeze brought in the smell of honeysuckle.He could hear kids playing on the far side of the lawn.Inside, the classroom was a cheap plastic construction, utterly without esthetic sensibility.Yes, school was easy, but it could also be mind numbingly boring; he'd have to reread his own poems about that.The forced confinement.The endless days of sitting still and listening to witless talk, while the whole world waited outside.Most of the students were actually looking in Chumlig's general direction.Was that just an artful scam?But when the woman asked a random child a snap question, she got relevant  if halting  answers.And then, much sooner than he had imagined:  " quitting early today, so we have time for only one more presentation," said Ms.Chumlig.What has she been saying?Damn .Chumlig was looking directly at him now."Please show us your composition, Professor Gu. "Juan slunk back to his seat, barely listening to Chumlig's analysis.She was always gentle in these public critiques, but the bad news was obvious all around him.Only the Radner twins had posted something nice.Someone who looked like a rabbit was grinning at him from the peanut gallery.Who was that ?He turned and plunked himself down in his chair.   "so we have time for only one more presentation," finished Ms.Chumlig."Please show us your composition, Professor Gu. "Juan looked back at where Gu was sitting.What sort of presentation could he make?Robert Gu seemed to wonder the same thing: "I really don't have anything that the class would appreciate.I don't do audiovisuals. "Chumlig smiled brightly.When she smiled like that at Juan, he knew his excuses would count for nothing."Nonsense, Professor Gu.You were  you are a poet. ""Indeed. ""And I made an assignment. "Gu looked young, but when he cocked his head and eyed Ms.Chumlig, there was such power in his gaze.Jeez, if only I could look like that when Chumlig has me on the hot seat .The young old man was silent for a second, and then he said calmly."I have written a short piece, but as I said it has none of  " his gaze swept the class, nailing Juan for an instant"  the pictures and sound that seem expected. "Ms.Chumlig gestured him forward."Your words will do splendidly today.Please.Come down. "After a second, Gu stood and came down the steps.He moved fast, with kind of a spastic lurch.Gossipy notes flew back and forth.For the moment, the class's attention was focused like Ms.Chumlig always wanted.Chumlig stepped out of his way, and Robert Gu turned to face the class.Of course, he couldn't call a up word display.But he didn't look at his view page either.He just looked at the class and said, "A poem.Three hundred words.I tell you about the land of North County as it really is, here and beyond. "His arm twitched outward, toward the open windows.Then he just talked.No special effects, no words scrolling through the air.And it couldn't really be a poem since his voice didn't get all singsong.Robert Gu just talked about the lawn that circled the school, the tiny mowers that circled and circled across it.The smell of the grass, and how it squeezed down moist in the morning.How the slope of the hills took running feet to the creek brush that edged the property.It was what you saw here every day  at least when you weren't using overlays to see somewhere else.And then Juan wasn't really aware of the words anymore.He was seeing; he was there.His mind floated above the little valley, scooted up the creek bed, had almost reached the foot of Pyramid Hill when suddenly Robert Gu stopped talking, and Juan was dumped back into the reality of his place at the rear end of Ms.Chumlig's composition class.He sat for a few seconds, dazed.Words.That's all they were.But what they did was more than visuals.It was more than haptics.There had even been the smell of the dry reeds along the creek bed.For a moment no one said anything.Ms.Chumlig looked glassy eyed.Either she was very impressed or she was surfing.But then a classic Pompous Bird flew up from the old farts' side of the room.It swooped across the room to drop a huge load of wet birdshit on Robert Gu.Fred and Jer burst out laughing, and after a moment the whole class responded.Of course, Robert Gu couldn't see the special effects.For a second he looked puzzled, and then he glared at the Radners."Class!"Ms.Chumlig sounded truly pissed.The laughter choked off and everyone applauded politely.Chumlig held them to it for a moment, then lowered her own hands.Juan could see she was scanning them all.Normally she ignored graffiti.This time she was searching for someone to crucify.Her gaze ended up in the old farts' section, and she looked a little surprised."Very well.Thank you, Robert.That is all we have time for today.Class, your next assignment is to collaborate and improve on what you have already done.It's up to you to find local partners for this step.Send me the teamings and your game plan before we meet next time. "The Ignominious Details would be in the mail by the time they got home.Then the class bell  triggered by Chumlig, in fact  rang out.By the time Juan got himself out of his chair, he was in the tail end of the mad rush for the door.It didn't matter.He was a little dazed by the strange form of virtual virtual reality that Robert Gu had created.Behind him he could see that Gu had finally figured out the class was over.He would be outside with the rest of them in a few seconds.My chance to enlist him for the Lizard .And maybe something else.He thought on the old man's magic words.Maybe, maybe, they could collaborate.Everybody had laughed at Robert Gu.But before the Pompous Bird had been launched, before they had laughed, Juan Orozco had felt the awed silence.And he did that with words alone    When Robert walked to the front of the class, he was more irritated than nervous.He had wowed students for thirty years.He could wow them with the bit of verse he had composed for today.He turned, and looked out the class."A poem," he said."Three hundred words.I tell you about the land of North County as it really is, here and beyond. "The poem was a pastoral cliche, composed last night and based on his memories of San Diego and what he saw on the drive to Fairmont.But for a few moments, his words held them, just as in the old days.When he was done there was a moment of absolute silence.What impressionable children.He looked over at the Adult Ed people, saw the jagged, hostile smile on Winston Blount's face.Envious as ever, eh, Winnie ?Then a pair of oafs near the front started laughing.That precipitated scattered giggles."Class!"Chumlig stepped forward and everyone applauded, even Blount.Chumlig said a few more words.Then the class bell rang and the students were all rushing for the door.He started after them."Ah, Robert," said Ms.Chumlig."Please stay a moment.That bell 'did not toll for you. '"She smiled, no doubt pleased by her command of literary allusion."Your poem was so beautiful.I want to apologize to you, for the class.They had no right to put the  " She gestured at the air above his head."What?""Never mind.This is not a truly talented class, I fear. "She look at him quizzically."It's hard to believe you're seventy five years old; modern medicine is working miracles.I've had a number of senior students.I understand your problems. ""Ah, you do. ""Anything you do in this class will be a favor for the others here.I hope you'll stay, help them.Rework your poem with some student's visuals.They can learn from you  and you can learn the skills that will make the world a more comfortable place for you. "Robert gave her a little smile.There would always be cretins like Louise Chumlig.Fortunately, she found something else to focus on: "Oh !Look at the time!I've got to start Remote Studies.Please excuse me. "Chumlig turned and walked to the center of the classroom.She jabbed a hand toward the top row of seats."Welcome, class.Sandi, stop playing with the unicorns!"Robert stared at the empty room, and the woman talking to herself.So much technology   Outside, the students had dispersed.Robert was left to ponder his reen counter with "academia. "It could have been worse.His little poem had been more than good enough for these people.Even Winnie Blount had applauded.To impress someone even when he hates you  that was always a kind of triumph."Mr.Gu?"The voice was tentative.Robert gave a start.It was the Orozco kid, lurking by the classroom door."Hello," he said, and gave the boy a generous smile.Maybe too generous.Orozco came out of the shadows and walked along with him."I  I thought your poem was wonderful. ""You're too kind. "The boy waved at the sunlit lawn."It made me feel like I was actually out here, running in the sunlight.And all without haptics or contacts or my wearable. "His gaze came up to Robert's face and then flickered away.It was a look of awe that might have really meant something if the speaker had been anyone worthwhile."I'll bet you're as good as any of the top game advertisers. ""I'll bet. "The boy dithered for an inarticulate moment."I notice you're not wearing.I could help you with that.Maybe, maybe we could team up.You know, you could help me with the words. "Another glance at Robert, and then the rest of the kid's speech came out in a rush."We could help each other, and then there's another deal I can get you in on.It could be a lot of money.Your friend Mr.Blount has already come on board. "They walked in silence for a dozen paces."So, Professor Gu, what do you think?"Robert gave Juan a kindly smile, and just as the kid brightened, he said, "Well, young man, I think it will be a cold day in hell before I team with an old fool like Winston Blount  or a young fool such as yourself. "Zing.The boy stumbled back almost as if Robert had punched him in the face.Robert walked on, smiling.It was a small thing, but like the poem, it was a start.07    The Ezra Pound Incident  There was a dark side to Robert's morning insights.Sometimes he would wake not to a grand solution but to the horrid realization that some problem was real, immediate, and apparently unsolvable.This wasn't worrywart obsessiveness, it was a form of defensive creativity.Sometimes the threat was a total surprise; more often it was a known inconvenience, now recognized as deadly serious.The panic attacks normally led to real solutions, as when he had withdrawn his earliest long poem from a small press, hiding its naive shallowness from public view.And very rarely, the new problem was truly unsolvable and he could but flail and rail against the impending disaster.Last night, coming away from his presentation at Fairmont High, he'd been feeling pretty good.The groundlings had been impressed, and so had the likes of Winston Blount  who was a more sophisticated kind of fool.Things are getting better.I'm coming back .Robert had drifted through dinner, pretty much ignoring Miri's pestering about all the things she could help him with.Bob was still absent.Robert had halfheartedly badgered Alice with questions about Lena's last days.Had Lena asked for him at the end?Who had come to her funeral?Alice was more patient than usual but still not a great source of information.Those were the questions he'd gone to sleep with.He woke with a plan for finding answers.When Bob returned, they would have a heart to heart talk about Lena.Bob would know some of the answers.And for the rest in Search and Analysis, Chumlig had been talking about the Friends of Privacy.There were methods of seeing through their lies.Robert was getting better and better at S&A.One way or another, he would recover his lost times with Lena.That was the good news.The bad news floated up as he lay there drowsing through his scheme for turning technology into a searchlight on Lena   The bad news was an absolute, gut certainty that replaced the vague uneasiness of earlier days.Yesterday, my poetry impressed the groundlings .That was no reason for joy, and he'd been a fool to be warmed by it for even an instant.Any blush of pleasure should have vanished when little Juan Whosits had announced that Robert was as brilliant as an advertising copywriter.Lord !But Winston Blount had applauded Robert's little effort.Winston Blount was certainly competent to judge such verse.And here Robert's morning insight came up with the memory of Winnie applauding, the measured beat of Blount's hands, the smile on his face.That had not been the look of an enemy bested and awed.Never in the old days would Robert have confused it for that.No, Winnie had been mocking him.Winston Blount was telling him what he should have known all along.His out doorsy poem was shit, good only for an audience accustomed to eating shit.Robert lay still for a long moment, a groan trapped in his throat, remembering the banal words of his little poem.That was the genius insight of this dark morning, the conclusion he had evaded every day since he was brought back from the dead: I've lost the music in the words .Every day he was awash with ideas for new poetry, but not the smallest piece of concrete verse.He had told himself that his genius was coming back with his other faculties, that it was coming back slowly, in his little poems.All that was a mirage.And now he knew it for a mirage.He was dead inside, his gifts turned into vaporous nothingness and random mechanical curiosity.You can't know that !He rolled out of bed and went into the bathroom.The air was cool and still.He stared out the half open bathroom window at the little gardens and twisted conifers, the empty street.Bob and Alice had given him an upstairs room.It had been fun to be able to run up and down stairs again.In truth nothing had changed about his problems.He had no new evidence that he was permanently maimed.It was just that suddenly  with the full authority of a Morning Insight  he was certain of it.But hell.For once this could be just panic without substance !Maybe obsessing on Lena's death was spilling over, making him see death in all directions.Yes.No problem.There was no problem.He spent the morning in a panicked rage, trying to prove to himself that he could still write.But the only paper was the foolscap, and when he wrote on it, his scrawling penmanship was re formed into neat, fontified lines.That had been an irritation in days past, but never enough to force him to dig up real paper.Today, now he could see that his soul was sucked out of the words before he could make them sing!It was the ultimate victory of automation over creative thought.Everything was beyond the direct touch of his hand.That was what was keeping him from finally connecting with his talents!And in the entire house there were no real paper and ink books.Aha .He rushed to the basement, pulled down one of the moldering cartons that Bob had brought from Palo Alto.Inside, there were real books.When he was a kid, he had practically camped out on the living room sofa the whole summer.They had no television, but every day he'd bring home a new pile of books from the library.Those summers, lying on the sofa, he had read his way through frivolous trash and deep wisdom  and learned more about truth than in an entire school year.Maybe that was where he had learned to make words sing.These books were mostly junk.There were school catalogs from before Stanford went all online.There were handouts that his TAs had painfully Xeroxed for the students.But, yes, there were a few books of poetry.Pitifully few, and read only by silverfish these last ten years.Robert stood up and stared at the boxes farther back in the basement dimness.Surely there were more books there, even if selected by brute chance, whatever was left after Bob auctioned off the Palo Alto place.He looked down at the book in his hand.Kipling.Damned jingoistic elevator music.But it's a start .Unlike the libraries that floated in cyberspace, this was something he could hold in his hands.He sat down on the boxes and began to read, all the while pushing his mind ahead of the words, trying to remember  trying to create  what should rightly be the rest of the poem.An hour passed.Two.He was vaguely aware that Alice came down to announce lunch, and that he waved her off impatiently.This was so much more important.He opened more boxes.Some contained Bob and Alice's own junk, even more vacuous than what they had retrieved from Palo Alto.But he found a dozen more books of poetry.Some of them were good stuff.The afternoon passed.He could still enjoy the poetry, but the enjoyment was also pain.I can't write a jot of the good stuff, except where I happen to remember it .And his panic grew.Finally, he stood and threw Ezra Pound into the basement wall.The spine of the old book split and it sprawled on the floor, a broken paper butterfly.Robert stared for a moment.He had never harmed a book before, not even if it bore the ugliest writing in the world.He walked across the room and knelt by the ruin.Miri chose that moment to come bouncing down the stairs."Robert!Alice says I can call an air taxi!Where would you like to go?"The words were noise, scraping on his despair.He picked up the book and shook his head."No. "Go away ."I don't understand.Why are you digging around here?There are easier ways to get what you want. "Robert stood, his fingers trying to put Ezra Pound back together again.His eyes found Miri.Now she had his attention.She was smiling, so sure of herself, in maximum bossiness mode.And for the moment she didn't understand the light in his eyes."And how is that, Miri?""The problem is that you can't access what's all around us.That's why you're down here reading these old books, right?In a way you're like a little kid  but that's good, that's good !Grown ups like Alice and Bob have all sorts of bad habits that hold them back.But you're starting almost fresh.It'll be easy for you to learn the new things.But not from dumbhead vocational classes.See?Let me teach you how to wear. "It was the same wearisome nag as always, but she thought she'd found a clever new angle.This time, he would not let it pass.Robert took a step toward her."So you've been watching me down here?"he said mildly, building up to what he intended."um, just in a general way.I  "  Robert took another step toward her and shoved the mutilated book toward her face."Have you ever heard of this poet?"Miri squinted at the broken spine. "'E,' Y  oh, 'Ezra Pound'?Well yes, I've got all her stuff.Let me show you, Robert!"She hesitated, then saw the foolscap lying atop a box.She picked it up and it came to life.Titles streamed down the page, the cantos, the essays  even, God help us, later criticism from the mindless depths of the twenty first century."But seeing it on this page is like looking through a keyhole, Robert.I can show you how to see it all around you, with  "  "Enough!"said Robert.He slid his voice down till it was quiet, cutting, overtly reasonable."You simpleton.You know nothing and yet you presume to run my life, just as you run the lives of your little friends. "Miri had backed up a step.There was shock on her face, but that had apparently not yet connected with her mouth."Yes, that's what Alice says, that I'm too bossy  "  Robert took another step, and Miri was against the stairs."You've spent your whole life playing video games, convincing yourself and your friends that you're worth something, that you're some kind of beautiful thing.I'll bet your parents are even foolish enough to tell you how clever you are.But it's not a pretty thing to be bossy when you're a fat, brainless brat. ""I  " Miri's hand rose to her mouth and her eyes grew wide.She took an awkward step backwards, up the steps.His words were connecting now.He could see the veneer of self confidence and bright cheeriness collapsing.And Robert pursued: "'I,' 'I'  yes, that's probably what your self centered little mind thinks about most.It would be hard to bear your worthlessness otherwise.But think about that before you come again trying to run my life. "Tears welled in the girl's eyes.She turned and sprinted up the stairs, her footsteps not a pounding of childish force, but soft  almost as if she didn't want anything about herself to be sensed.Robert stood for a moment, looking up the empty stairway.It was like standing at the bottom of a well, with a patch of daylight across the top.He remembered.There had been a time, when he was fifteen and his sister Cara was about ten when Cara became independent, bothersome.At the time Robert had had his own problems  totally trivial from the altitude of seventy five years, but they'd seemed significant at the time.Getting past his sister's newfound ego, making her realize how little she counted in the general scheme of things, that had given him such a rush of pleasure.Robert stared up into the patch of daylight and waited for the rush.Bob Gu got out of debrief late on Saturday.He had been delinquent about tracking events at home; the Paraguay operation had been all absorbing.Okay, that was an excuse.But it was also the truth.There had been hot launchers under that hostage orphanage.There in Asuncion, he had seen the abyss.So it wasn't until he arrived home that he got the local bad news  His daughter was too big and grown up to sit on his lap, but she sat close on the sofa and let him take her hands in his.Alice sat on the other side; she looked calm, but he knew she was totally freaked.Training jitters plus this problem at home were almost too much for her.So it was past time to face up to family responsibilities:  "It's nothing you did, Miri. "Miri shook her head.There were dark rings around her eyes; Alice said she had stopped crying only an hour ago."I was trying to help him and" The sentence dribbled off.Her voice held none of the confidence that had grown in it over the last two or three years.Damn .In the corner of his eye, Bob could see that his father was still ensconced in his room upstairs, silently sticking it to them all.Visiting Dad was next on the agenda.The old man was going to have a surprise.For now, there was something more important to set right."I know you were, Miri.And I think you have helped Grandpa a lot since he came to live with us. "The old man would still be trying to find his shoes if she hadn't."You remember, we talked about this when Grandpa came?He is not necessarily a nice fellow"  except when he wants a favor, or he's setting you up for a fall; then he can charm almost any human ever horn ."Y Yes.I remember. ""What he says when he's trying to hurt you doesn't have any connection with whether you've been good or bad, clever or stupid. ""B But maybe I was too pushy.You didn't see him this morning, Bob.He was so sad.He thinks I don't notice, but I do.His pulse was way up.He's so afraid that he can't write anymore.And he misses Grandma, I mean Lena.I miss Lena!But I  "  "It's not your responsibility to solve this problem, Miri. "He glanced over Miri's head at Alice."It's mine, and till now I've messed up.Your job, well, that's at Fairmont Junior High. ""Actually, we call it Fairmont High. ""Okay.Look.Before Grandpa came, school was just about all you thought about.That and your friends and your projects.Didn't you tell me you're going to transform the place this Halloween?"Some shred of her past enthusiasm lit Miri's face."Yeah.We've got the backstory on all the SpielbergRowling stuff.Annette's going to  "  "Then that and your regular schoolwork is what you should concentrate on.That's your mission, kiddo. ""But what about Robert?"Robert can go to hell ."I'll talk to him.I think you're right that he's got a problem.But, you know sometimes, well there's something you have to learn as you grow up.Some people make their own problems.And they never stop hurting themselves and messing up the people around them.When that's the case, then you shouldn't keep hurting yourself for them. "Miri's head bowed and she looked very sad.And then she looked back at him.Her jaw came up in that familiar, stubborn way."Maybe that's true about other people but this is my grandfather. "08    No User Serviceable Parts Within  After that remarkable Saturday, Robert Gu spent considerably less time at his son's home.He slept there, still in the upstairs room.Sometimes he even ate in the dining room.Miri was always somewhere else.Alice was as impassive as stone.When Bob was around, the hospitality was even more sparse.Robert was living on borrowed time, and it had nothing to do with his medical condition.He hung out in empty rooms at school, reading from his old books.He surfed the web more than ever.Chumlig showed him some modern utilities that hid in his view page, things that could not even pretend to be WinME programs.And he drove around town.That was as much to play with the automatic cars as it was to see what San Diego had become; in fact, the suburban sprawl was just as drab as in the past.But Robert discovered that his new, maimed personality had a thing about gadgets.Cryptic machines were everywhere nowadays.They lurked in walls, nestled in trees, even littered the lawns.They worked silently, almost invisibly, twenty four hours a day.He began to wonder where it all ended.One day after school, Robert drove into the far East County, past the endless, ordinary suburbs.The housing didn't thin out until he was well into the mountains.But twenty miles beyond El Cajon, he came to a gap in the housing and what looked like a war in progress.Dust plumes spouted from buildings several hundred yards back from the highway.When he rolled down the window, he heard what might have been artillery fire.A frontage road ran along a high fence.A rusted sign said "UP/Express" something or other.And then the strange firing range was behind him.The highway was a long straight climb now, up past four thousand feet.It was farther and farther between off ramps.The auto slowly accelerated.According to the awkward little dashboard display that he'd found in his WinME game folder, they were doing better than 120 miles per hour.The boulders and scrub along the shoulder were a blur, and the window rolled itself closed.He passed the manual vehicles in far right lanes as though they were standing still.Someday, I have to learn to drive again .Then he was over the crest.The auto slowed, taking the curves at a mere fifty miles per hour.He remembered driving this way with Lena, on a much smaller Highway 8, maybe in 1970.Lena Llewelyn was new to California, new to the U. S. A.  She had boggled at the size of the place compared with her native Britain.She'd been so open then, so trusting.That was even before she decided to specialize in psychiatry.The hills shed their faded green and stood as piles of rounded boulders.The desert spread endlessly below and beyond.He came down from the mountains, turned off Highway 8, and drove slowly along old desert roads toward Anza Borrego State Park.The last of the suburbs were up on the ridgeline.Down here, things were as they had been when he'd been in grad school  even as they had been for centuries before that.There were plenty of traffic signs on these smaller roads.Some were rusted and tilted, but they were real.His gaze turned to watch a bullet punctured stop sign dwindle behind him.It was beautiful.A little farther on he came upon a dusty path that ran off across endless desert.The automobile balked at following it: "Sorry, sir, there's no guidance that way, and I notice you don't have a driver's license. ""Ha.In that case, I'm taking a little walk. "Surprisingly, there was no objection to that.He opened the door and stepped out into the breezy afternoon.He could feel his spirit unlimber.He could see forever.Robert walked east along the rutted dirt road.Here at last he had reached the natural world.His foot kicked something metallic.A spent round?No.The gray lump had a triple antenna sticking out of the top.He tossed it into the bushes.He was not beyond the web even here.He pulled out his magic foolscap, surfed the local area.The picture showed the ground around him, from some kind of camera built into the paper; little signs floated above every weed  Ambrosia dumosa this and Encelia farinosa that.Ads for the park's gift shop scrolled across the top of the page.Robert pressed 411.The expense meter at the corner of the page was running now, almost five dollars a minute.That sort of money meant there was a human at the other end.Robert talked to the paper."So how far am I from  " from the natural world "  how far am I from unimproved land?"A tag changed color; his request had been subcontracted.
