A grunt answered him.Surprised me, he did.Twas an accident.I can travel.No accident, Stilgar said.Ill hold you responsible with Chani for the lads safety, Jamis.These people have my countenance.Jessica stared at the man, Jamis.His was the voice that had argued with Stilgar from the rocks.His was the voice with death in it.And Stilgar had seen fit to reinforce his order with this Jamis.Stilgar flicked a testing glance across the group, motioned two men out.Larus and Farrukh, you are to hide our tracks.See that we leave no trace.Extra care  we have two with us whove not been trained.He turned, hand upheld and aimed across the basin.In squad line with flankers  move out.We must be at Cave of the Ridges before dawn.Jessica fell into step beside Stilgar, counting heads.There were forty Fremen  she and Paul made it forty two.And she thought: They travel as a military company  even the girl, Chani.Paul took a place in the line behind Chani.He had put down the black feeling at being caught by a girl.In his mind now was the memory called up by his mothers barked reminder: My sons been tested with the gom jabbar!He found that his hand tingled with remembered pain.Watch where you go, Chani hissed.Do not brush against a bush lest you leave a thread to show our passage.Paul swallowed, nodded.Jessica listened to the sounds of the troop, hearing her own footsteps and Pauls, marveling at the way the Fremen moved.They were forty people crossing the basin with only the sounds natural to the place  ghostly feluccas, their robes flitting through the shadows.Their destination was Sietch Tabr  Stilgars sietch.She turned the word over in her mind: sietch.It was a Chakobsa word, unchanged from the old hunting language of countless centuries.Sietch: a meeting place in time of danger.The profound implications of the word and the language were just beginning to register with her after the tension of their encounter.We move well, Stilgar said.With Shai huluds favor, well reach Cave of the Ridges before dawn.Jessica nodded, conserving her strength, sensing the terrible fatigue she held at bay by force of will  and, she admitted it: by the force of elation.Her mind focused on the value of this troop, seeing what was revealed here about the Fremen culture.All of them, she thought, an entire culture trained to military order.What a priceless thing is here for an outcast Duke!The Fremen were supreme in that quality the ancients called spannungsbogen  which is the self imposed delay between desire for a thing and the act of reaching out to grasp that thing.from The Wisdom of MuadDib by the Princess Irulan    They approached Cave of the Ridges at dawnbreak, moving through a split in the basin wall so narrow they had to turn sideways to negotiate it.Jessica saw Stilgar detach guards in the thin dawnlight, saw them for a moment as they began their scrambling climb up the cliff.Paul turned his head upward as he walked, seeing the tapestry of this planet cut in cross section where the narrow cleft gaped toward gray blue sky.Chani pulled at his robe to hurry him, said: Quickly.It is already light.The men who climbed above us, where are they going?Paul whispered.The first daywatch, she said.Hurry now!A guard left outside, Paul thought.Wise.But it wouldve been wiser still for us to approach this place in separate bands.Less chance of losing the whole troop.He paused in the thought, realizing that this was guerrilla thinking, and he remembered his fathers fear that the Atreides might become a guerrilla house.Faster, Chani whispered.Paul sped his steps, hearing the swish of robes behind.And he thought of the words of the sirat from Yuehs tiny O. C.  Bible.Paradise on my right, Hell on my left and the Angel of Death behind.He rolled the quotation in his mind.They rounded a corner where the passage widened.Stilgar stood at one side motioning them into a low hole that opened at right angles.Quickly!he hissed.Were like rabbits in a cage if a patrol catches us here.Paul bent for the opening, followed Chani into a cave illuminated by thin gray light from somewhere ahead.You can stand up, she said.He straightened, studied the place: a deep and wide area with domed ceiling that curved away just out of a mans handreach.The troop spread out through shadows.Paul saw his mother come up on one side, saw her examine their companions.And he noted how she failed to blend with the Fremen even though her garb was identical.The way she moved  such a sense of power and grace.Find a place to rest and stay out of the way, child man, Chani said.Heres food.She pressed two leaf wrapped morsels into his hand.They reeked of spice.Stilgar came up behind Jessica, called an order to a group on the left.Get the doorseal in place and see to moisture security.He turned to another Fremen: Lemil, get glowglobes.He took Jessicas arm.I wish to show you something, weirding woman.He led her around a curve of rock toward the light source.Jessica found herself looking out across the wide lip of another opening to the cave, an opening high in a cliff wall  looking out across another basin about ten or twelve kilometers wide.The basin was shielded by high rock walls.Sparse clumps of plant growth were scattered around it.As she looked at the dawn gray basin, the sun lifted over the far escarpment illuminating a biscuit colored landscape of rocks and sand.And she noted how the sun of Arrakis appeared to leap over the horizon.Its because we want to hold it back, she thought.Night is safer than day.There came over her then a longing for a rainbow in this place that would never see rain.I must suppress such longings, she thought.Theyre a weakness.I no longer can afford weaknesses.Stilgar gripped her arm, pointed across the basin.There!There you see proper Druses.She looked where he pointed, saw movement: people on the basin floor scattering at the daylight into the shadows of the opposite cliffwall.In spite of the distance, their movements were plain in the clear air.She lifted her binoculars from beneath her robe, focused the oil lenses on the distant people.Kerchiefs fluttered like a flight of multicolored butterflies.That is home, Stilgar said.We will be there this night.He stared across the basin, tugging at his mustache.My people stayed out overlate working.That means there are no patrols about.Ill signal them later and theyll prepare for us.Your people show good discipline,Jessica said.She lowered the binoculars, saw that Stilgar was looking at them.They obey the preservation of the tribe, he said.It is the way we choose among us for a leader.The leader is the one who is the strongest, the one who brings water and security.He lifted his attention to her face.She returned his stare, noted the whiteless eyes, the stained eyepits, the dust rimmed beard and mustache, the line of the catchtube curving down from his nostrils into his stillsuit.Have I compromised your leadership by besting you, Stilgar?she asked.You did not call me out, he said.Its important that a leader keep the respect of his troop, she said.Isnt a one of those sandlice I cannot handle, Stilgar said.When you bested me, you bested us all.Now, they hope to learn from you  the weirding way  and some are curious to see if you intend to call me out.She weighed the implications.By besting you in formal battle?He nodded.Id advise you against this because theyd not follow you.Youre not of the sand.They saw this in our nights passage.Practical people, she said.True enough.He glanced at the basin.We know our needs.But not many are thinking deep thoughts now this close to home.Weve been out overlong arranging to deliver our spice quota to the free traders for the cursed Guild  may their faces be forever black.Jessica stopped in the act of turning away from him, looked back up into his face.The Guild?What has the Guild to do with your spice?Its Liets command, Stilgar said.We know the reason, but the taste of it sours us.We bribe the Guild with a monstrous payment in spice to keep our skies clear of satellites and such that none may spy what we do to the face of Arrakis.She weighed out her words, remembering that Paul had said this must be the reason Arrakeen skies were clear of satellites.And what is it you do to the face of Arrakis that must not be seen?We change it  slowly but with certainty  to make it fit for human life.Our generation will not see it, nor our children nor our childrens children nor the grandchildren of their children  but it will come.He stared with veiled eyes out over the basin.Open water and tall green plants and people walking freely without stillsuits.So thats the dream of this Liet Kynes, she thought.And she said: Bribes are dangerous; they have a way of growing larger and larger.They grow, he said, but the slow way is the safe way.Jessica turned, looked out over the basin, trying to see it the way Stilgar was seeing it in his imagination.She saw only the grayed mustard stain of distant rocks and a sudden hazy motion in the sky above the cliffs.Ah h h h, Stilgar said.She thought at first it must be a patrol vehicle, then realized it was a mirage  another landscape hovering over the desert sand and a distant wavering of greenery and in the middle distance a long worm traveling the surface with what looked like Fremen robes fluttering on its back.The mirage faded.It would be better to ride, Stilgar said, but we cannot permit a maker into this basin.Thus, we must walk again tonight.Maker  their word for worm, she thought.She measured the import of his words, the statement that they could not permit a worm into this basin.She knew what she had seen in the mirage  Fremen riding on the back of a giant worm.It took heavy control not to betray her shock at the implications.We must be getting back to the others, Stilgar said.Else my people may suspect I dally with you.Some already are jealous that my hands tasted your loveliness when we struggled last night in Tuono Basin.That will be enough of that!Jessica snapped.No offense, Stilgar said, and his voice was mild.Women among us are not taken against their will  and with you  He shrugged.even that convention isnt required.You will keep in mind that I was a dukes lady, she said, but her voice was calmer.As you wish, he said.Its time to seal off this opening, to permit relaxation of stillsuit discipline.My people need to rest in comfort this day.Their families will give them little rest on the morrow.Silence fell between them.Jessica stared out into the sunlight.She had heard what she had heard in Stilgars voice  the unspoken offer of more than his countenance.Did he need a wife?She realized she could step into that place with him.It would be one way to end conflict over tribal leadership  female properly aligned with male.But what of Paul then?Who could tell yet what rules of parenthood prevailed here?And what of the unborn daughter she had carried these few weeks?What of a dead Dukes daughter?And she permitted herself to face fully the significance of this other child growing within her, to see her own motives in permitting the conception.She knew what it was  she had succumbed to that profound drive shared by all creatures who are faced with death  the drive to seek immortality through progeny.The fertility drive of the species had overpowered them.Jessica glanced at Stilgar, saw that he was studying her, waiting.A daughter born here to a woman wed to such a one as this man  what would be the fate of such a daughter?she asked herself.Would he try to limit the necessities that a Bene Gesserit must follow?Stilgar cleared his throat and revealed then that he understood some of the questions in her mind.What is important for a leader is that which makes him a leader.It is the needs of his people.If you teach me your powers, there may come a day when one of us must challenge the other.I would prefer some alternative.There are several alternatives?she asked.The Sayyadina, he said.Our Reverend Mother is old.Their Reverend Mother!Before she could probe this, he said: I do not necessarily offer myself as mate.This is nothing personal, for you are beautiful and desirable.But should you become one of my women, that might lead some of my young men to believe that Im too much concerned with pleasures of the flesh and not enough concerned with the tribes needs.Even now they listen to us and watch us.A man who weighs his decisions, who thinks of consequences, she thought.There are those among my young men who have reached the age of wild spirits, he said.They must be eased through this period.I must leave no great reasons around for them to challenge me.Because I would have to maim and kill among them.This is not the proper course for a leader if it can be avoided with honor.A leader, you see, is one of the things that distinguishes a mob from a people.He maintains the level of individuals.Too few individuals, and a people reverts to a mob.His words, the depth of their awareness, the fact that he spoke as much to her as to those who secretly listened, forced her to re evaluate him.He has stature, she thought.Where did he learn such inner balance?The law that demands our form of choosing a leader is a just law, Stilgar said.But it does not follow that justice is always the thing a people needs.What we truly need now is time to grow and prosper, to spread our force over more land.What is his ancestry?she wondered.Whence comes such breeding?She said: Stilgar, I underestimated you.Such was my suspicion, he said.Each of us apparently underestimated the other, she said.I should like an end to this, he said.I should like friendship with you  and trust.I should like that respect for each other which grows in the breast without demand for the huddlings of sex.I understand, she said.Do you trust me?I hear your sincerity.Among us, he said, the Sayyadina, when they are not the formal leaders, hold a special place of honor.They teach.They maintain the strength of God here.He touched his breast.Now I must probe this Reverend Mother mystery, she thought.And she said: You spoke of your Reverend Mother  and Ive heard words of legend and prophecy.It is said that a Bene Gesserit and her offspring hold the key to our future, he said.Do you believe I am that one?She watched his face, thinking: The young reed dies so easily.Beginnings are times of such great peril.We do not know, he said.She nodded, thinking: Hes an honorable man.He wants a sign from me, but hell not tip fate by telling me the sign.Jessica turned her head, stared down into the basin at the golden shadows, the purple shadows, the vibrations of dust mote air across the lip of their cave.Her mind was filled suddenly with feline prudence.She knew the cant of the Missionaria Protectiva, knew how to adapt the techniques of legend and fear and hope to her emergency needs, but she sensed wild changes here  as though someone had been in among these Fremen and capitalized on the Missionaria Protectivas imprint.Stilgar cleared his throat.She sensed his impatience, knew that the day moved ahead and men waited to seal off this opening.This was a time for boldness on her part, and she realized what she needed: some dar al hikman, some school of translation that would give her   Adab, she whispered.Her mind felt as though it had rolled over within her.She recognized the sensation with a quickening of pulse.Nothing in all the Bene Gesserit training carried such a signal of recognition.It could be only the adab, the demanding memory that comes upon you of itself.She gave herself up to it, allowing the words to flow from her.Ibn qirtaiba, she said, as far as the spot where the dust ends.She stretched out an arm from her robe, seeing Stilgars eyes go wide.She heard a rustling of many robes in the background.I see a  Fremen with the book of examples, she intoned.He reads to al Lat, the sun whom he defied and subjugated.He reads to the Sadus of the Trial and this is what he reads:   Mine enemies are like green blades eaten down  That did stand in the path of the tempest.Hast thou not seen what our Lord did?He sent the pestilence among them  That did lay schemes against us.They are like birds scattered by the huntsman.Their schemes are like pellets of poison  That every mouth rejects.A trembling passed through her.She dropped her arm.Back to her from the inner caves shadows came a whispered response of many voices: Their works have been overturned.The fire of God mount over thy heart, she said.And she thought: Now, it goes in the proper channel.The fire of God set alight, came the response.She nodded.Thine enemies shall fall, she said.Bi lal kaifa, they answered.In the sudden hush, Stilgar bowed to her.Sayyadina, he said.If the Shai hulud grant, then you may yet pass within to become a Reverend Mother.Pass within, she thought.An odd way of putting it.But the rest of it fitted into the cant well enough.And she felt a cynical bitterness at what she had done.Our Missionaria Protectiva seldom fails.A place was prepared for us in this wilderness.The prayer of the salat has carved out our hiding place.Now  I must play the part of Auliya, the Friend of God  Sayyadina to rogue peoples whove been so heavily imprinted with our Bene Gesserit soothsay they even call their chief priestesses Reverend Mothers.Paul stood beside Chani in the shadows of the inner cave.He could still taste the morsel she had fed him  bird flesh and grain bound with spice honey and encased in a leaf.In tasting it he had realized he never before had eaten such a concentration of spice essence and there had been a moment of fear.He knew what this essence could do to him  the spice change that pushed his mind into prescient awareness.Bi lal kaifa, Chani whispered.He looked at her, seeing the awe with which the Fremen appeared to accept his mothers words.Only the man called Jamis seemed to stand aloof from the ceremony, holding himself apart with arms folded across his breast.Duy yakha hin mange, Chani whispered.Duy punra hin mange.I have two eyes.I have two feet.And she stared at Paul with a look of wonder.Paul took a deep breath, trying to still the tempest within him.His mothers words had locked onto the working of the spice essence, and he had felt her voice rise and fall within him like the shadows of an open fire.Through it all, he had sensed the edge of cynicism in her  he knew her so well!but nothing could stop this thing that had begun with a morsel of food.Terrible purpose!He sensed it, the race consciousness that he could not escape.There was the sharpened clarity, the inflow of data, the cold precision of his awareness.He sank to the floor, sitting with his back against rock, giving himself up to it.Awareness flowed into that timeless stratum where he could view time, sensing the available paths, the winds of the future  the winds of the past: the one eyed vision of the future  all combined in a trinocular vision that permitted him to see time become space.There was danger, he felt, of overrunning himself, and he had to hold onto his awareness of the present, sensing the blurred deflection of experience, the flowing moment, the continual solidification of that which is into the perpetual was.In grasping the present, he felt for the first time the massive steadiness of times movement everywhere complicated by shifting currents, waves, surges, and countersurges, like surf against rocky cliffs.It gave him a new understanding of his prescience, and he saw the source of blind time, the source of error in it, with an immediate sensation of fear.The prescience, he realized, was an illumination that incorporated the limits of what it revealed  at once a source of accuracy and meaningful error.A kind of Heisenberg indeterminacy intervened: the expenditure of energy that revealed what he saw, changed what he saw.And what he saw was a time nexus within this cave, a boiling of possibilities focused here, wherein the most minute action  the wink of an eye, a careless word, a misplaced grain of sand  moved a gigantic lever across the known universe.He saw violence with the outcome subject to so many variables that his slightest movement created vast shiftings in the pattern.The vision made him want to freeze into immobility, but this, too, was action with its consequences.The countless consequences  lines fanned out from this cave, and along most of these consequence lines he saw his own dead body with blood flowing from a gaping knife wound.My father, the Padishah Emperor, was 72 yet looked no more than 35 the year he encompassed the death of Duke Leto and gave Arrakis back to the Harkonnens.He seldom appeared in public wearing other than a Sardaukar uniform and a Bursegs black helmet with the Imperial lion in gold upon its crest.The uniform was an open reminder of where his power lay.He was not always that blatant, though.When he wanted, he could radiate charm and sincerity, but I often wonder in these later days if anything about him was as it seemed.I think now he was a man fighting constantly to escape the bars of an invisible cage.You must remember that he was an emperor, father head of a dynasty that reached back into the dimmest history.But we denied him a legal son.Was this not the most terrible defeat a ruler ever suffered?My mother obeyed her Sister Superiors where the Lady Jessica disobeyed.Which of them was the stronger?History already has answered.In My Fathers House by the Princess Irulan    Jessica awakened in cave darkness, sensing the stir of Fremen around her, smelling the acrid stillsuit odor.Her inner timesense told her it would soon be night outside, but the cave remained in blackness, shielded from the desert by the plastic hoods that trapped their body moisture within this space.She realized that she had permitted herself the utterly relaxing sleep of great fatigue, and this suggested something of her own unconscious assessment on personal security within Stilgars troop.She turned in the hammock that had been fashioned of her robe, slipped her feet to the rock floor and into her desert boots.I must remember to fasten the boots slip fashion to help my stillsuits pumping action, she thought.There are so many things to remember.She could still taste their morning meal  the morsel of bird flesh and grain bound within a leaf with spice honey  and it came to her that the use of time was turned around here: night was the day of activity and day was the time of rest.Night conceals; night is safest.She unhooked her robe from its hammock pegs in a rock alcove, fumbled with the fabric in the dark until she found the top, slipped into it.How to get a message out to the Bene Gesserit?she wondered.They would have to be told of the two strays in Arrakeen sanctuary.Glowglobes came alight farther into the cave.She saw people moving there, Paul among them already dressed and with his hood thrown back to reveal the aquiline Atreides profile.He had acted so strangely before they retired, she thought.Withdrawn.He was like one come back from the dead, not yet fully aware of his return, his eyes half shut and glassy with the inward stare.It made her think of his warning about the spice impregnated diet: addictive.Are there side effects?she wondered.He said it had something to do with his prescient faculty, but he has been strangely silent about what he sees.Stilgar came from shadows to her right, crossed to the group beneath the glowglobes.She marked how he fingered his beard and the watchful, cat stalking look of him.Abrupt fear shot through Jessica as her senses awakened to the tensions visible in the people gathered around Paul  the stiff movements, the ritual positions.They have my countenance!Stilgar rumbled.Jessica recognized the man Stilgar confronted  Jamis!She saw then the rage in Jamis  the tight set of his shoulders.Jamis, the man Paul bested!she thought.You know the rule, Stilgar,Jamis said.Who knows it better?Stilgar asked, and she heard the tone of placation in his voice, the attempt to smooth something over.I choose the combat,Jamis growled.Jessica sped across the cave, grasped Stilgars arm.What is this?she asked.It is the amtal rule, Stilgar said.Jamis is demanding the right to test your part in the legend.She must be championed,Jamis said.If her champion wins, thats the truth in it.But its said  He glanced across the press of people.that shed need no champion from the Fremen  which can mean only that she brings her own champion.Hes talking of single combat with Paul!Jessica thought.She released Stilgars arm, took a half step forward.Im always my own champion, she said.The meanings simple enough for   Youll not tell us our ways!Jamis snapped.Not without more proof than Ive seen.Stilgar couldve told you what to say last morning.He couldve filled your mind full of the coddle and you couldve bird talked it to us, hoping to make a false way among us.I can take him, Jessica thought, but that might conflict with the way they interpret the legend.And again she wondered at the way the Missionaria Protectivas work had been twisted on this planet.Stilgar looked at Jessica, spoke in a low voice but one designed to carry to the crowds fringe.Jamis is one to hold a grudge, Sayyadina.Your son bested him and  It was an accident!Jamis roared.There was witch force at Tuono Basin and Ill prove it now!and Ive bested him myself, Stilgar continued.He seeks by this tahaddi challenge to get back at me as well.Theres too much of violence in Jamis for him ever to make a good leader  too much ghafla, the distraction.He gives his mouth to the rules and his heart to the sarfa, the turning away.No, he could never make a good leader.Ive preserved him this long because hes useful in a fight as such, but when he gets this carving anger on him hes dangerous to his own society.Stilgar r r r!Jamis rumbled.And Jessica saw what Stilgar was doing, trying to enrage Jamis, to take the challenge away from Paul.Stilgar faced Jamis, and again Jessica heard the soothing in the rumbling voice.Jamis, hes but a boy.Hes  You named him a man, Jamis said.His mother says hes been through the gom jabbar.Hes full fleshed and with a surfeit of water.The ones who carried their pack say theres literjons of water in it.Literjons!And us sipping our catchpockets the instant they show dewsparkle.Stilgar glanced at Jessica.Is this true?Is there water in your pack?Yes.Literjons of it?Two literjons.What was intended with this wealth?Wealth?she thought.She shook her head, feeling the coldness in his voice.Where I was born, water fell from the sky and ran over the land in wide rivers, she said.There were oceans of it so broad you could not see the other shore.Ive not been trained to your water discipline.I never before had to think of it this way.A sighing gasp arose from the people around them: Water fell from the sky  it ran over the land.Did you know therere those among us whove lost from their catchpockets by accident and will be in sore trouble before we reach Tabr this night?How could I know?Jessica shook her head.If theyre in need, give them water from our pack.Is that what you intended with this wealth?I intended it to save life, she said.Then we accept your blessing, Sayyadina.Youll not buy us off with water, Jamis growled.Nor will you anger me against yourself, Stilgar.I see you trying to make me call you out before Ive proved my words.Stilgar faced Jamis.Are you determined to press this fight against a child, Jamis?His voice was low, venomous.She must be championed.Even though she has my countenance?I invoke the amtal rule,Jamis said.Its my right.Stilgar nodded.Then, if the boy does not carve you down, youll answer to my knife afterward.And this time Ill not hold back the blade as Ive done before.You cannot do this thing,Jessica said.Pauls just  You must not interfere, Sayyadina, Stilgar said.Oh, I know you can take me and, therefore, can take anyone among us, but you cannot best us all united.This must be; it is the amtal rule.Jessica fell silent, staring at him in the green light of the glowglobes, seeing the demoniacal stiffness that had taken over his expression.She shifted her attention to Jamis, saw the brooding look to his brows and thought: I shouldve seen that before.He broods.Hes the silent kind, one who works himself up inside.I shouldve been prepared.If you harm my son, she said, Youll have me to meet.I call you out now.Ill carve you into a joint of  Mother.Paul stepped forward, touched her sleeve.Perhaps if I explain to Jamis how  Explain!Jamis sneered.Paul fell silent, staring at the man.He felt no fear of him.Jamis appeared clumsy in his movements and he had fallen so easily in their night encounter on the sand.But Paul still felt the nexus boiling of this cave, still remembered the prescient visions of himself dead under a knife.There had been so few avenues of escape for him in that vision   Stilgar said: Sayyadina, you must step back now where  Stop calling her Sayyadina!Jamis said.Thats yet to be proved.So she knows the prayer!Whats that?Every child among us knows it.He has talked enough, Jessica thought.Ive the key to him.I could immobilize him with a word.She hesitated.But I cannot stop them all.You will answer to me then,Jessica said, and she pitched her voice in a twisting tone with a little whine in it and a catch at the end.Jamis stared at her, fright visible on his face.Ill teach you agony, she said in the same tone.Remember that as you fight.Youll have agony such as will make the gom jabbar a happy memory by comparison.You will writhe with your entire  She tries a spell on me!Jamis gasped.He put his clenched right fist beside his ear.I invoke the silence on her!So be it then, Stilgar said.He cast a warning glance at Jessica.If you speak again, Sayyadina, well know its your witchcraft and youll be forfeit.He nodded for her to step back.Jessica felt hands pulling her, helping her back, and she sensed they were not unkindly.She saw Paul being separated from the throng, the elfin faced Chani whispering in his ear as she nodded toward Jamis.A ring formed within the troop.More glowglobes were brought and all of them tuned to the yellow band.Jamis stepped into the ring, slipped out of his robe and tossed it to someone in the crowd.He stood there in a cloudy gray slickness of stillsuit that was patched and marked by tucks and gathers.For a moment, he bent with his mouth to his shoulder, drinking from a catchpocket tube.Presently he straightened, peeled off and detached the suit, handed it carefully into the crowd.He stood waiting, clad in loincloth and some tight fabric over his feet, a crysknife in his right hand.Jessica saw the girl child Chani helping Paul, saw her press a crysknife handle into his palm, saw him heft it, testing the weight and balance.And it came to Jessica that Paul had been trained in prana and bindu, the nerve and the fiber  that he had been taught fighting in a deadly school, his teachers men like Duncan Idaho and Gurney Halleck, men who were legends in their own lifetimes.The boy knew the devious ways of the Bene Gesserit and he looked supple and confident.But hes only fifteen, she thought.And he has no shield.I must stop this.Somehow, there must be a way to  She looked up, saw Stilgar watching her.You cannot stop it, he said.You must not speak.She put a hand over her mouth, thinking: Ive planted fear in Jamis mind.Itll slow him some  perhaps.If I could only pray  truly pray.Paul stood alone now just into the ring, clad in the fighting trunks hed worn under his stillsuit.He held a crysknife in his right hand; his feet were bare against the sand gritted rock.Idaho had warned him time and again: When in doubt of your surface, bare feet are best.And there were Chanis words of instruction still in the front of his consciousness: Jamis turns to the right with his knife after a parry.Its a habit weve all seen.And hell aim for the eyes to catch a blink in which to slash you.And he can fight either hand; look out for a knife shift.But the strongest in Paul so that he felt it with his entire body was the training and the instinctual reaction mechanism that had been hammered into him day after day, hour after hour on the practice floor.Gurney Hallecks words were there to remember: The good knife fighter thinks on point and blade and shearing guard simultaneously.The point can also cut; the blade can also stab; the shearing guard can also trap your opponents blade.Paul glanced at the crysknife.There was no shearing guard; only the slim round ring of the handle with its raised lips to protect the hand.And even so, he realized that he did not know the breaking tension of this blade, did not even know if it could be broken.Jamis began sidling to the right along the edge of the ring opposite Paul.Paul crouched, realizing then that he had no shield, but was trained to fighting with its subtle field around him, trained to react on defense with utmost speed while his attack would be timed to the controlled slowness necessary for penetrating the enemys shield.In spite of constant warning from his trainers not to depend on the shields mindless blunting of attack speed, he knew that shield awareness was part of him.Jamis called out in ritual challenge: May thy knife chip and shatter!This knife will break then, Paul thought.He cautioned himself that Jamis also was without shield, but the man wasnt trained to its use, had no shield fighter inhibitions.Paul stared across the ring at Jamis.The mans body looked like knotted whipcord on a dried skeleton.His crysknife shone milky yellow in the light of the glowglobes.Fear coursed through Paul.He felt suddenly alone and naked standing in dull yellow light within this ring of people.Prescience had fed his knowledge with countless experiences, hinted at the strongest currents of the future and the strings of decision that guided them, but this was the real now.This was death hanging on an infinite number of minuscule mischances.Anything could tip the future here, he realized.Someone coughing in the troop of watchers, a distraction.A variation in a glowglobes brilliance, a deceptive shadow.Im afraid, Paul told himself.And he circled warily opposite Jamis, repeating to himself the Bene Gesserit litany against fear.Fear is the mind killer It was a cool bath washing over him.He felt muscles unite themselves, become poised and ready.Ill sheathe my knife in your blood,Jamis snarled.And in the middle of the last word, he pounced.Jessica saw the motion, stifled an outcry.Where the man struck there was only empty air and Paul stood now behind Jamis with a clear shot at the exposed back.Now, Paul!Now!Jessica screamed it in her mind.Pauls motion was slowly timed, beautifully fluid, but so slow it gave Jamis the margin to twist away, backing and turning to the right.Paul withdrew, crouching low.First, you must find my blood, he said.Jessica recognized the shield fighter timing in her son, and it came over her what a two edged thing that was.The boys reactions were those of youth and trained to a peak these people had never seen.But the attack was trained, too, and conditioned by the necessities of penetrating a shield barrier.A shield would repel too fast a blow, admit only the slowly deceptive counter.It needed control and trickery to get through a shield.Does Paul see it?she asked herself.He must!Again Jamis attacked, ink dark eyes glaring, his body a yellow blur under the glowglobes.And again Paul slipped away to return too slowly on the attack.And again.And again.Each time, Pauls counterblow came an instant late.And Jessica saw a thing she hoped Jamis did not see.Pauls defensive reactions were blindingly fast, but they moved each time at the precisely correct angle they would take if a shield were helping deflect part of Jamis blow.Is your son playing with that poor fool?Stilgar asked.He waved her to silence before she could respond.Sorry; you must remain silent.Now the two figures on the rock floor circled each other: Jamis with knife hand held far forward and tipped up slightly; Paul crouched with knife held low.Again, Jamis pounced, and this time he twisted to the right where Paul had been dodging.Instead of faking back and out, Paul met the mans knife hand on the point of his own blade.Then the boy was gone, twisting away to the left and thankful for Chanis warning.Jamis backed into the center of the circle, rubbing his knife hand.Blood dripped from the injury for a moment, stopped.His eyes were wide and staring  two blue black holes  studying Paul with a new wariness in the dull light of the glowglobes.Ah, that one hurt, Stilgar murmured.Paul crouched at the ready and, as he had been trained to do after first blood, called out: Do you yield?Hah!Jamis cried.An angry murmur arose from the troop.Hold!Stilgar called out.The lad doesnt know our rule.Then, to Paul: There can be no yielding in the tahaddi challenge.Death is the test of it.Jessica saw Paul swallow hard.And she thought: Hes never killed a man like this  in the hot blood of a knife fight.Can he do it?Paul circled slowly right, forced by Jamis movement.The prescient knowledge of the time boiling variables in this cave came back to plague him now.His new understanding told him there were too many swiftly compressed decisions in this fight for any clear channel ahead to show itself.Variable piled on variable  that was why this cave lay as a blurred nexus in his path.It was like a gigantic rock in the flood, creating maelstroms in the current around it.Have an end to it, lad, Stilgar muttered.Dont play with him.Paul crept farther into the ring, relying on his own edge in speed.Jamis backed now that the realization swept over him  that this was no soft offworlder in the tahaddi ring, easy prey for a Fremen crysknife.Jessica saw the shadow of desperation in the mans face.Now is when hes most dangerous, she thought.Now hes desperate and can do anything.He sees that this is not like a child of his own people, but a fighting machine born and trained to it from infancy.Now the fear I planted in him has come to bloom.And she found in herself a sense of pity for Jamis  an emotion tempered by awareness of the immediate peril to her son.Jamis could do anything  any unpredictable thing, she told herself.She wondered then if Paul had glimpsed this future, if he were reliving this experience.But she saw the way her son moved, the beads of perspiration on his face and shoulders, the careful wariness visible in the flow of muscles.And for the first time she sensed, without understanding it, the uncertainty factor in Pauls gift.Paul pressed the fight now, circling but not attacking.He had seen the fear in his opponent.Memory of Duncan Idahos voice flowed through Pauls awareness: When your opponent fears you, thens the moment when you give the fear its own rein, give it the time to work on him.Let it become terror.The terrified man fights himself.Eventually, he attacks in desperation.That is the most dangerous moment, but the terrified man can be trusted usually to make a fatal mistake.You are being trained here to detect these mistakes and use them.The crowd in the cavern began to mutter.They think Pauls toying with Jamis, Jessica thought.They think Pauls being needlessly cruel.But she sensed also the undercurrent of crowd excitement, their enjoyment of the spectacle.And she could see the pressure building up in Jamis.The moment when it became too much for him to contain was as apparent to her as it was to Jamis  or to Paul.Jamis leaped high, feinting and striking down with his right hand, but the hand was empty.The crysknife had been shifted to his left hand.Jessica gasped.But Paul had been warned by Chani: Jamis fights with either hand.And the depth of his training had taken in that trick en passant.Keep the mind on the knife and not on the hand that holds it, Gurney Halleck had told him time and again.The knife is more dangerous than the hand and the knife can be in either hand.And Paul had seen Jamis mistake: bad footwork so that it took the man a heartbeat longer to recover from his leap, which had been intended to confuse Paul and hide the knife shift.Except for the low yellow light of the glowglobes and the inky eyes of the staring troop, it was similar to a session on the practice floor.Shields didnt count where the bodys own movement could be used against it.Paul shifted his own knife in a blurred motion, slipped sideways and thrust upward where Jamis chest was descending  then away to watch the man crumple.Jamis fell like a limp rag, face down, gasped once and turned his face toward Paul, then lay still on the rock floor.His dead eyes stared out like beads of dark glass.Killing with the point lacks artistry, Idaho had once told Paul, but dont let that hold your hand when the opening presents itself.The troop rushed forward, filling the ring, pushing Paul aside.They hid Jamis in a frenzy of huddling activity.Presently a group of them hurried back into the depths of the cavern carrying a burden wrapped in a robe.And there was no body on the rock floor.Jessica pressed through toward her son.She felt that she swam in a sea of robed and stinking backs, a throng strangely silent.Now is the terrible moment, she thought.He has killed a man in clear superiority of mind and muscle.He must not grow to enjoy such a victory.She forced herself through the last of the troop and into a small open space where two bearded Fremen were helping Paul into his stillsuit.Jessica stared at her son.Pauls eyes were bright.He breathed heavily, permitting the ministrations to his body rather than helping them.Him against Jamis and not a mark on him, one of the men muttered.Chani stood at one side, her eyes focused on Paul.Jessica saw the girls excitement, the admiration in the elfin face.It must be done now and swiftly, Jessica thought.She compressed ultimate scorn into her voice and manner, said: We l l, now  how does it feel to be a killer?Paul stiffened as though he had been struck.He met his mothers cold glare and his face darkened with a rush of blood.Involuntarily he glanced toward the place on the cavern floor where Jamis had lain.Stilgar pressed through to Jessicas side, returning from the cave depths where the body of Jamis had been taken.He spoke to Paul in a bitter, controlled tone: When the time comes for you to call me out and try for my burda, do not think you will play with me the way you played with Jamis.Jessica sensed the way her own words and Stilgars sank into Paul, doing their harsh work on the boy.The mistake these people made  it served a purpose now.She searched the faces around them as Paul was doing, seeing what he saw.Admiration, yes, and fear  and in some  loathing.She looked at Stilgar, saw his fatalism, knew how the fight had seemed to him.Paul looked at his mother.You know what it was, he said.She heard the return to sanity, the remorse in his voice.Jessica swept her glance across the troop, said: Paul has never killed a man with a naked blade.Stilgar faced her, disbelief in his face.I wasnt playing with him, Paul said.He pressed in front of his mother, straightening his robe, glanced at the dark place of Jamis blood on the cavern floor.I did not want to kill him.Jessica saw belief come slowly to Stilgar, saw the relief in him as he tugged at his beard with a deeply veined hand.She heard muttering awareness spread through the troop.Thats why y asked him to yield, Stilgar said.I see.Our ways are different, but youll see the sense in them.I thought wed admitted a scorpion into our midst.He hesitated, then: And I shall not call you lad the more.A voice from the troop called out: Needs a naming, Stil.Stilgar nodded, tugging at his beard.I see strength in you  like the strength beneath a pillar.Again he paused, then: You shall be known among us as Usul, the base of the pillar.This is your secret name, your troop name.We of Sietch Tabr may use it, but none other may so presume  Usul.Murmuring went through the troop: Good choice, that  strong  bring us luck.And Jessica sensed the acceptance, knowing she was included in it with her champion.She was indeed Sayyadina.Now, what name of manhood do you choose for us to call you openly?Stilgar asked.Paul glanced at his mother, back to Stilgar.Bits and pieces of this moment registered on his prescient memory, but he felt the differences as though they were physical, a pressure forcing him through the narrow door of the present.How do you call among you the little mouse, the mouse that jumps?Paul asked, remembering the pop hop of motion at Tuono Basin.He illustrated with one hand.A chuckle sounded through the troop.We call that one muaddib, Stilgar said.Jessica gasped.It was the name Paul had told her, saying that the Fremen would accept them and call him thus.She felt a sudden fear of her son and for him.Paul swallowed.He felt that he played a part already played over countless times in his mind  yet  there were differences.He could see himself perched on a dizzying summit, having experienced much and possessed of a profound store of knowledge, but all around him was abyss.And again he remembered the vision of fanatic legions following the green and black banner of the Atreides, pillaging and burning across the universe in the name of their prophet MuadDib.That must not happen, he told himself.Is that the name you wish, MuadDib?Stilgar asked.I am an Atreides, Paul whispered, and then louder: Its not right that I give up entirely the name my father gave me.Could I be known among you as Paul MuadDib?You are Paul MuadDib, Stilgar said.And Paul thought: That was in no vision of mine.I did a different thing.But he felt that the abyss remained all around him.Again a murmuring response went through the troop as man turned to man: Wisdom with strength  Couldnt ask more  Its the legend for sure  Lisan al Gaib  Lisan al Gaib   I will tell you a thing about your new name, Stilgar said.The choice pleases us.MuadDib is wise in the ways of the desert.MuadDib creates his own water.MuadDib hides from the sun and travels in the cool night.MuadDib is fruitful and multiplies over the land.MuadDib we call instructor of boys.That is a powerful base on which to build your life, Paul MuadDib, who is Usul among us.We welcome you.Stilgar touched Pauls forehead with one palm, withdrew his hand, embraced Paul and murmured, Usul.As Stilgar released him, another member of the troop embraced Paul, repeating his new troop name.And Paul was passed from embrace to embrace through the troop, hearing the voices, the shadings of tone: Usul  Usul  Usul.Already, he could place some of them by name.And there was Chani who pressed her cheek against his as she held him and said his name.Presently Paul stood again before Stilgar, who said: Now you are of the Ichwan Bedwine, our brother.His face hardened, and he spoke with command in his voice.And now, Paul MuadDib, tighten up that stillsuit.He glanced at Chani.Chani!Paul MuadDibs nose plugs are as poor a fit as Ive ever seen!I thought I ordered you to see after him!I hadnt the makings, Stil, she said.Theres Jamis, of course, but  Enough of that!Then Ill share one of mine, she said.I can make do with one until  You will not, Stilgar said.I know there are spares among us.Where are the spares?Are we a troop together or a band of savages?Hands reached out from the troop offering hard, fibrous objects.Stilgar selected four, handed them to Chani.Fit these to Usul and the Sayyadina.A voice lifted from the back of the troop: What of the water, Stil?What of the literjons in their pack?I know your need, Farok, Stilgar said.He glanced at Jessica.She nodded.Broach one for those that need it, Stilgar said.Water master  where is a watermaster?Ah, Shimoom, care for the measuring of what is needed.The necessity and no more.This water is the dower property of the Sayyadina and will be repaid in the sietch at field rates less pack fees.What is this repayment at field rates?Jessica asked.Ten for one, Stilgar said.But  Its a wise rule as youll come to see, Stilgar said.A rustling of robes marked movement at the back of the troop as men turned to get the water.Stilgar held up a hand, and there was silence.As to Jamis, he said, I order the full ceremony.Jamis was our companion and brother of the Ichwan Bedwine.There shall be no turning away without the respect due one who proved our fortune by his tahaddi challenge.I invoke the rite  at sunset, when the dark shall cover him.Paul, hearing these words, realized that he had plunged once more into the abyss  blind time.There was no past occupying the future in his mind  except  except  he could still sense the green and black Atreides banner waving  somewhere ahead  still see the jihads bloody swords and fanatic legions.It will not be, he told himself.I cannot let it be.God created Arrakis to train the faithful.from The Wisdom of MuadDib by the Princess Irulan    In the stillness of the cavern, Jessica heard the scrape of sand on rock as people moved, the distant bird calls that Stilgar had said were the signals of his watchmen.The great plastic hood seals had been removed from the caves openings.She could see the march of evening shadows across the lip of rock in front of her and the open basin beyond.She sensed the daylight leaving them, sensed it in the dry heat as well as the shadows.She knew her trained awareness soon would give her what these Fremen obviously had  the ability to sense even the slightest change in the airs moisture.How they had scurried to tighten their stillsuits when the cave was opened!Deep within the cave, someone began chanting:   Ima trava okolo!I korenja okolo!Jessica translated silently: These are ashes!And these are roots!The funeral ceremony for Jamis was beginning.She looked out at the Arrakeen sunset, at the banked decks of color in the sky.Night was beginning to utter its shadows along the distant rocks and the dunes.Yet the heat persisted.Heat forced her thoughts onto water and the observed fact that this whole people could be trained to be thirsty only at given times.Thirst.She could remember moonlit waves on Caladan throwing white robes over rocks  and the wind heavy with dampness.Now the breeze that fingered her robes seared the patches of exposed skin at cheeks and forehead.The new nose plugs irritated her, and she found herself overly conscious of the tube that trailed down across her face into the suit, recovering her breaths moisture.The suit itself was a sweatbox.Your suit will be more comfortable when youve adjusted to lower water content in your body, Stilgar had said.She knew he was right, but the knowledge made this moment no more comfortable.The unconscious preoccupation with water here weighed on her mind.No, she corrected herself: it was preoccupation with moisture.And that was a more subtle and profound matter.She heard approaching footsteps, turned to see Paul come out of the caves depths trailed by the elfin faced Chani.Theres another thing, Jessica thought.Paul must be cautioned about their women.One of these desert women would not do as wife to a Duke.As concubine, yes, but not as wife.Then she wondered at herself, thinking: Have I been infected with his schemes?And she saw how well she had been conditioned.I can think of the marital needs of royalty without once weighing my own concubinage.Yet  I was more than concubine.Mother.Paul stopped in front of her.Chani stood at his elbow.Mother, do you know what theyre doing back there?Jessica looked at the dark patch of his eyes staring out from the hood.I think so.Chani showed me  because Im supposed to see it and give my  permission for the weighing of the water.Jessica looked at Chani.Theyre recovering Jamis water, Chani said, and her thin voice came out nasal past the nose plugs.Its the rule.The flesh belongs to the person, but his water belongs to the tribe  except in the combat.They say the waters mine, Paul said.Jessica wondered why this should make her suddenly alert and cautious.Combat water belongs to the winner, Chani said.Its because you have to fight in the open without stillsuits.The winner has to get his water back that he loses while fighting.I dont want his water, Paul muttered.He felt that he was a part of many images moving simultaneously in a fragmenting way that was disconcerting to the inner eye.He could not be certain what he would do, but of one thing he was positive: he did not want the water distilled out of Jamis flesh.Its  water, Chani said.Jessica marveled at the way she said it.Water.So much meaning in a simple sound.A Bene Gesserit axiom came to Jessicas mind: Survival is the ability to swim in strange water.And Jessica thought: Paul and I, we must find the currents and patterns in these strange waters  if were to survive.You will accept the water,Jessica said.She recognized the tone in her voice.She had used that same tone once with Leto, telling her lost Duke that he would accept a large sum offered for his support in a questionable venture  because money maintained power for the Atreides.On Arrakis, water was money.She saw that clearly.Paul remained silent, knowing then that he would do as she ordered  not because she ordered it, but because her tone of voice had forced him to re evaluate.To refuse the water would be to break with accepted Fremen practice.Presently Paul recalled the words of 467 Kalima in Yuehs O. C.  Bible.He said: From water does all life begin.Jessica stared at him.Where did he learn that quotation?she asked herself.He hasnt studied the mysteries.Thus it is spoken, Chani said.Giudichar mantene: It is written in the Shah Nama that water was the first of all things created.For no reason she could explain (and this bothered her more than the sensation), Jessica suddenly shuddered.She turned away to hide her confusion and was just in time to see the sunset.A violent calamity of color spilled over the sky as the sun dipped beneath the horizon.It is time!The voice was Stilgars ringing in the cavern.Jamis weapon has been killed.Jamis has been called by Him, by Shai hulud, who has ordained the phases for the moons that daily wane and  in the end  appear as bent and withered twigs.Stilgars voice lowered.Thus it is with Jamis.Silence fell like a blanket on the cavern.Jessica saw the gray shadow movement of Stilgar like a ghost figure within the inner reaches.She glanced at the basin, sensing the coolness.The friends of Jamis will approach, Stilgar said.Men moved behind Jessica, dropping a curtain across the opening.A single glowglobe was lighted overhead far back in the cave.Its yellow glow picked out an inflowing of human figures.Jessica heard the rustling of the robes.Chani took a step away as though pulled by the light.Jessica bent close to Pauls ear, speaking in the family code: Follow their lead; do as they do.It will be a simple ceremony to placate the shade of Jamis.It will be more than that, Paul thought.And he felt a wrenching sensation within his awareness as though he were trying to grasp some thing in motion and render it motionless.Chani glided back to Jessicas side, took her hand.Come, Sayyadina.We must sit apart.Paul watched them move off into the shadows, leaving him alone.He felt abandoned.The men who had fixed the curtain came up beside him.Come, Usul.He allowed himself to be guided forward, to be pushed into a circle of people being formed around Stilgar, who stood beneath the glowglobe and beside a bundled, curving, and angular shape gathered beneath a robe on the rock floor.The troop crouched down at a gesture from Stilgar, their robes hissing with the movement.Paul settled with them, watching Stilgar, noting the way the overhead globe made pits of his eyes and brightened the touch of green fabric at his neck.Paul shifted his attention to the robe covered mound at Stilgars feet, recognized the handle of a baliset protruding from the fabric.The spirit leaves the bodys water when the first moon rises, Stilgar intoned.Thus it is spoken.When we see the first moon rise this night, whom will it summon?Jamis, the troop responded.Stilgar turned full circle on one heel, passing his gaze across the ring of faces.I was a friend of Jamis, he said.When the hawk plane stooped upon us at Hole in the Rock, it was Jamis pulled me to safety.He bent over the pile beside him, lifted away the robe.I take this robe as a friend of Jamis  leaders right.He draped the robe over a shoulder, straightening.Now, Paul saw the contents of the mound exposed: the pale glistening gray of a stillsuit, a battered literjon, a kerchief with a small book in its center, the bladeless handle of a crysknife, an empty sheath, a folded pack, a paracompass, a distrans, a thumper, a pile of fist sized metallic hooks, an assortment of what looked like small rocks within a fold of cloth, a clump of bundled feathers  and the baliset exposed beside the folded pack.So Jamis played the baliset, Paul thought.The instrument reminded him of Gurney Halleck and all that was lost.Paul knew with his memory of the future in the past that some chance lines could produce a meeting with Halleck, but the reunions were few and shadowed.They puzzled him.The uncertainty factor touched him with wonder.Does it mean that something I will do  that I may do, could destroy Gurney  or bring him back to life  or   Paul swallowed, shook his head.Again, Stilgar bent over the mound.For Jamis woman and for the guards, he said.The small rocks and the book were taken into the folds of his robe.Leaders right, the troop intoned.The marker for Jamis coffee service, Stilgar said, and he lifted a flat disc of green metal.That it shall be given to Usul in suitable ceremony when we return to the sietch.Leaders right, the troop intoned.Lastly, he took the crysknife handle and stood with it.For the funeral plain, he said.For the funeral plain, the troop responded.At her place in the circle across from Paul, Jessica nodded, recognizing the ancient source of the rite, and she thought: The meeting between ignorance and knowledge, between brutality and culture  it begins in the dignity with which we treat our dead.She looked across at Paul, wondering: Will he see it?Will he know what to do?We are friends of Jamis, Stilgar said.We are not wailing for our dead like a pack of garvarg.A gray bearded man to Pauls left stood up.I was a friend of Jamis, he said.He crossed to the mound, lifted the distrans.When our water went below minim at the siege of Two Birds, Jamis shared.The man returned to his place in the circle.Am I supposed to say I was a friend of Jamis?Paul wondered.Do they expect me to take something from that pile?He saw faces turn toward him, turn away.They expect it!Another man across from Paul arose, went to the pack and removed the paracompass.I was a friend of Jamis, he said.When the patrol caught us at Bight of the Cliff and I was wounded, Jamis drew them off so the wounded could be saved.He returned to his place in the circle.Again, the faces turned toward Paul, and he saw the expectancy in them, lowered his eyes.An elbow nudged him and a voice hissed: Would you bring the destruction on us?How can I say I was his friend?Paul wondered.Another figure arose from the circle opposite Paul and, as the hooded face came into the light, he recognized his mother.She removed a kerchief from the mound.I was a friend of Jamis, she said.When the spirit of spirits within him saw the needs of truth, that spirit withdrew and spared my son.She returned to her place.And Paul recalled the scorn in his mothers voice as she had confronted him after the fight.How does it feel to be a killer?Again, he saw the faces turned toward him, felt the anger and fear in the troop.A passage his mother had once filmbooked for him on The Cult of the Dead flickered through Pauls mind.He knew what he had to do.Slowly, Paul got to his feet.A sigh passed around the circle.Paul felt the diminishment of his self as he advanced into the center of the circle.It was as though he lost a fragment of himself and sought it here.He bent over the mound of belongings, lifted out the baliset.A string twanged softly as it struck against something in the pile.I was a friend of Jamis, Paul whispered.He felt tears burning his eyes, forced more volume into his voice.Jamis taught me  that  when you kill  you pay for it.I wish Id known Jamis better.Blindly, he groped his way back to his place in the circle, sank to the rock floor.A voice hissed: He sheds tears!It was taken up around the ring: Usul gives moisture to the dead!He felt fingers touch his damp cheek, heard the awed whispers.Jessica, hearing the voices, felt the depth of the experience, realized what terrible inhibitions there must be against shedding tears.She focused on the words: He gives moisture to the dead.It was a gift to the shadow world  tears.They would be sacred beyond a doubt.Nothing on this planet had so forcefully hammered into her the ultimate value of water.Not the water sellers, not the dried skins of the natives, not stillsuits or the rules of water discipline.Here there was a substance more precious than all others  it was life itself and entwined all around with symbolism and ritual.Water.I touched his cheek, someone whispered.I felt the gift.At first, the fingers touching his face frightened Paul.He clutched the cold handle of the baliset, feeling the strings bite his palm.Then he saw the faces beyond the groping hands  the eyes wide and wondering.Presently, the hands withdrew.The funeral ceremony resumed.But now there was a subtle space around Paul, a drawing back as the troop honored him by a respectful isolation.The ceremony ended with a low chant:   Full moon calls thee   Shai hulud shalt thou see;  Red the night, dusky sky,  Bloody death didst thou die.We pray to a moon: she is round   Luck with us will then abound,  What we seek for shall be found  In the land of solid ground.A bulging sack remained at Stilgars feet.He crouched, placed his palms against it.Someone came up beside him, crouched at his elbow, and Paul recognized Chanis face in the hood shadow.Jamis carried thirty three liters and seven and three thirty seconds drachms of the tribes water, Chani said.I bless it now in the presence of a Sayyadina.Ekkeri akairi, this is the water, fillissin follasy of Paul MuadDib!Kivi a kavi, never the more, nakalas!Nakelas!to be measured and counted, ukair an!by the heartbeats jan jan jan of our friend  Jamis.In an abrupt and profound silence, Chani turned, stared at Paul.Presently she said: Where I am flame be thou the coals.Where I am dew be thou the water.Bi lal kaifa, intoned the troop.To Paul MuadDib goes this portion, Chani said.May he guard it for the tribe, preserving it against careless loss.May he be generous with it in time of need.May he pass it on in his time for the good of the tribe.Bi lal kaifa, intoned the troop.I must accept that water, Paul thought.Slowly, he arose, made his way to Chanis side.Stilgar stepped back to make room for him, took the baliset gently from his hand.Kneel, Chani said.Paul knelt.She guided his hands to the waterbag, held them against the resilient surface.With this water the tribe entrusts thee, she said.Jamis is gone from it.Take it in peace.She stood, pulling Paul up with her.Stilgar returned the baliset, extended a small pile of metal rings in one palm.Paul looked at them, seeing the different sizes, the way the light of the glowglobe reflected off them.Chani took the largest ring, held it on a finger.Thirty liters, she said.One by one, she took the others, showing each to Paul, counting them.Two liters; one liter; seven watercounters of one drachm each; one watercounter of three thirty seconds drachms.In all  thirty three liters and seven and three thirty seconds drachms.She held them up on her finger for Paul to see.Do you accept them?Stilgar asked.Paul swallowed, nodded.Yes.Later, Chani said.I will show you how to tie them in a kerchief so they wont rattle and give you away when you need silence.She extended her hand.Will you  hold them for me?Paul asked.Chani turned a startled glance on Stilgar.He smiled, said, Paul MuadDib who is Usul does not yet know our ways, Chani.Hold his watercounters without commitment until its time to show him the manner of carrying them.She nodded, whipped a ribbon of cloth from beneath her robe, linked the rings onto it with an intricate over and under weaving, hesitated, then stuffed them into the sash beneath her robe.I missed something there, Paul thought.He sensed the feeling of humor around him, something bantering in it, and his mind linked up a prescient memory: watercounters offered to a woman  courtship ritual.Watermasters, Stilgar said.The troop arose in a hissing of robes.Two men stepped out, lifted the waterbag.Stilgar took down the glowglobe, led the way with it into the depths of the cave.Paul was pressed in behind Chani, noted the buttery glow of light over rock walls, the way the shadows danced, and he felt the troops lift of spirits contained in a hushed air of expectancy.Jessica, pulled into the end of the troop by eager hands, hemmed around by jostling bodies, suppressed a moment of panic.She had recognized fragments of the ritual, identified the shards of Chakobsa and Bhotani jib in the words, and she knew the wild violence that could explode out of these seemingly simple moments.Jan jan jan, she thought.Go go go.It was like a childs game that had lost all inhibition in adult hands.Stilgar stopped at a yellow rock wall.He pressed an outcropping and the wall swung silently away from him, opening along an irregular crack.He led the way through past a dark honeycomb lattice that directed a cool wash of air across Paul when he passed it.Paul turned a questioning stare on Chani, tugged her arm.That air felt damp, he said.Sh h h h, she whispered.But a man behind them said: Plenty of moisture in the trap tonight.Jamis way of telling us hes satisfied.Jessica passed through the secret door, heard it close behind.She saw how the Fremen slowed while passing the honeycomb lattice, felt the dampness of the air as she came opposite it.Windtrap!she thought.Theyve a concealed windtrap somewhere on the surface to funnel air down here into cooler regions and precipitate the moisture from it.They passed through another rock door with latticework above it, and the door closed behind them.The draft of air at their backs carried a sensation of moisture clearly perceptible to both Jessica and Paul.At the head of the troop, the glowglobe in Stilgars hands dropped below the level of the heads in front of Paul.Presently he felt steps beneath his feet, curving down to the left.Light reflected back up across hooded heads and a winding movement of people spiraling down the steps.Jessica sensed mounting tension in the people around her, a pressure of silence that rasped her nerves with its urgency.The steps ended and the troop passed through another low door.The light of the glowglobe was swallowed in a great open space with a high curved ceiling.Paul felt Chanis hand on his arm, heard a faint dripping sound in the chill air, felt an utter stillness come over the Fremen in the cathedral presence of water.I have seen this place in a dream, he thought.The thought was both reassuring and frustrating.Somewhere ahead of him on this path, the fantastic hordes cut their glory path across the universe in his name.The green and black Atreides banner would become a symbol of terror.Wild legions would charge into battle screaming their war cry: MuadDib!It must not be, he thought.I cannot let it happen.But he could feel the demanding race consciousness within him, his own terrible purpose, and he knew that no small thing could deflect the juggernaut.It was gathering weight and momentum.If he died this instant, the thing would go on through his mother and his unborn sister.Nothing less than the deaths of all the troop gathered here and now  himself and his mother included  could stop the thing.Paul stared around him, saw the troop spread out in a line.They pressed him forward against a low barrier carved from native rock.Beyond the barrier in the glow of Stilgars globe, Paul saw an unruffled dark surface of water.It stretched away into shadows  deep and black  the far wall only faintly visible, perhaps a hundred meters away.Jessica felt the dry pulling of skin on her cheeks and forehead relaxing in the presence of moisture.The water pool was deep; she could sense its deepness, and resisted a desire to dip her hands into it.A splashing sounded on her left.She looked down the shadowy line of Fremen, saw Stilgar with Paul standing beside him and the watermasters emptying their load into the pool through a flowmeter.The meter was a round gray eye above the pools rim.She saw its glowing pointer move as the water flowed through it, saw the pointer stop at thirty three liters, seven and three thirty seconds drachms.Superb accuracy in water measurement, Jessica thought.And she noted that the walls of the meter trough held no trace of moisture after the waters passage.The water flowed off those walls without binding tension.She saw a profound clue to Fremen technology in the simple fact: they were perfectionists.Jessica worked her way down the barrier to Stilgars side.Way was made for her with casual courtesy.She noted the withdrawn look in Pauls eyes, but the mystery of this great pool of water dominated her thoughts.Stilgar looked at her.There were those among us in need of water, he said, yet they would come here and not touch this water.Do you know that?I believe it, she said.He looked at the pool.We have more than thirty eight million decaliters here, he said.Walled off from the little makers, hidden and preserved.A treasure trove, she said.Stilgar lifted the globe to look into her eyes.It is greater than treasure.We have thousands of such caches.Only a few of us know them all.He cocked his head to one side.The globe cast a yellow shadowed glow across face and beard.Hear that?They listened.The dripping of water precipitated from the windtrap filled the room with its presence.Jessica saw that the entire troop was caught up in a rapture of listening.Only Paul seemed to stand remote from it.To Paul, the sound was like moments ticking away.He could feel time flowing through him, the instants never to be recaptured.He sensed a need for decision, but felt powerless to move.It has been calculated with precision, Stilgar whispered.We know to within a million decaliters how much we need.When we have it, we shall change the face of Arrakis.A hushed whisper of response lifted from the troop: Bi lal kaifa.We will trap the dunes beneath grass plantings, Stilgar said, his voice growing stonger.We will tie the water into the soil with trees and undergrowth.Bi lal kaifa, intoned the troop.Each year the polar ice retreats, Stilgar said.Bi lal kaifa, they chanted.We will make a homeworld of Arrakis  with melting lenses at the poles, with lakes in the temperate zones, and only the deep desert for the maker and his spice.Bi lal kaifa.And no man ever again shall want for water.It shall be his for dipping from well or pond or lake or canal.It shall run down through the qanats to feed our plants.It shall be there for any man to take.It shall be his for holding out his hand.Bi lal kaifa.Jessica felt the religious ritual in the words, noted her own instinctively awed response.Theyre in league with the future, she thought.They have their mountain to climb.This is the scientists dream  and these simple people, these peasants, are filled with it.Her thoughts turned to Liet Kynes, the Emperors planetary ecologist, the man who had gone native  and she wondered at him.This was a dream to capture mens souls, and she could sense the hand of the ecologist in it.This was a dream for which men would die willingly.It was another of the essential ingredients that she felt her son needed: people with a goal.Such people would be easy to imbue with fervor and fanaticism.They could be wielded like a sword to win back Pauls place for him.We leave now, Stilgar said, and wait for the first moons rising.When Jamis is safely on his way, we will go home.Whispering their reluctance, the troop fell in behind him, turned back along the water barrier and up the stairs.And Paul, walking behind Chani, felt that a vital moment had passed him, that he had missed an essential decision and was now caught up in his own myth.He knew he had seen this place before, experienced it in a fragment of prescient dream on faraway Caladan, but details of the place were being filled in now that he had not seen.He felt a new sense of wonder at the limits of his gift.It was as though he rode within the wave of time, sometimes in its trough, sometimes on a crest  and all around him the other waves lifted and fell, revealing and then hiding what they bore on their surface.Through it all, the wild jihad still loomed ahead of him, the violence and the slaughter.It was like a promontory above the surf.The troop filed through the last door into the main cavern.The door was sealed.Lights were extinguished, hoods removed from the cavern openings, revealing the night and the stars that had come over the desert.Jessica moved to the dry lip of the caverns edge, looked up at the stars.They were sharp and near.She felt the stirring of the troop around her, heard the sound of a baliset being tuned somewhere behind her, and Pauls voice humming the pitch.There was a melancholy in his tone that she did not like.Chanis voice intruded from the deep cave darkness: Tell me about the waters of your birthworld, Paul MuadDib.And Paul: Another time, Chani.I promise.Such sadness.Its a good baliset, Chani said.Very good, Paul said.Do you think Jamisll mind my using it?He speaks of the dead in the present tense, Jessica thought.The implications disturbed her.A mans voice intruded: He liked music betimes, Jamis did.Then sing me one of your songs, Chani pleaded.Such feminine allure in that girl childs voice, Jessica thought.I must caution Paul about their women  and soon.This was a song of a friend of mine, Paul said.I expect hes dead now, Gurney is.He called it his evensong.The troop grew still, listening as Pauls voice lifted in a sweet boy tenor with the baliset tinkling and strumming beneath it:   This clear time of seeing embers   A gold bright suns lost in first dusk.What frenzied senses, desprate musk  Are consort of remembring.Jessica felt the verbal music in her breast  pagan and charged with sounds that made her suddenly and intensely aware of herself, feeling her own body and its needs.She listened with a tense stillness.Nights pearl censered requi em   Tis for us!What joys run, then  Bright in your eyes  What flower spangled amores  Pull at our hearts   What flower spangled amores  Fill our desires.And Jessica heard the after stillness that hummed in the air with the last note.Why does my son sing a love song to that girl child?she asked herself.She felt an abrupt fear.She could sense life flowing around her and she had no grasp on its reins.Why did he choose that song?she wondered.The instincts are true sometimes.Why did he do this?Paul sat silently in the darkness, a single stark thought dominating his awareness: My mother is my enemy.She does not know it, but she is.She is bringing the jihad.She bore me; she trained me.She is my enemy.The concept of progress acts as a protective mechanism to shield us from the terrors of the future.from Collected Sayings of MuadDib by the Princess Irulan    On his seventeenth birthday, Feyd Rautha Harkonnen killed his one hundredth slave gladiator in the family games.Visiting observers from the Imperial Court  a Count and Lady Fenring  were on the Harkonnen home world of Giedi Prime for the event, invited to sit that afternoon with the immediate family in the golden box above the triangular arena.In honor of the na Barons nativity and to remind all Harkonnens and subjects that Feyd Rautha was heir designate, it was holiday on Giedi Prime.The old Baron had decreed a meridian to meridian rest from labors, and effort had been spent in the family city of Harko to create the illusion of gaiety: banners flew from buildings, new paint had been splashed on the walls along Court Way.But off the main way, Count Fenring and his lady noted the rubbish heaps, the scabrous brown walls reflected in the dark puddles of the streets, and the furtive scurrying of the people.In the Barons blue walled keep, there was fearful perfection, but the Count and his lady saw the price being paid  guards everywhere and weapons with that special sheen that told a trained eye they were in regular use.There were checkpoints for routine passage from area to area even within the keep.The servants revealed their military training in the way they walked, in the set of their shoulders  in the way their eyes watched and watched and watched.The pressures on, the Count hummed to his lady in their secret language.The Baron is just beginning to see the price he really paid to rid himself of the Duke Leto.Sometime I must recount for you the legend of the phoenix, she said.They were in the reception hall of the keep waiting to go to the family games.It was not a large hall  perhaps forty meters long and half that in width  but false pillars along the sides had been shaped with an abrupt taper, and the ceiling had a subtle arch, all giving the illusion of much greater space.Ah h h, here comes the Baron, the Count said.The Baron moved down the length of the hall with that peculiar waddling glide imparted by the necessities of guiding suspensor hung weight.His jowls bobbed up and down; the suspensors jiggled and shifted beneath his orange robe.Rings glittered on his hands and opafires shone where they had been woven into the robe.At the Barons elbow walked Feyd Rautha.His dark hair was dressed in close ringlets that seemed incongruously gay above sullen eyes.He wore a tight fitting black tunic and snug trousers with a suggestion of bell at the bottom.Soft soled slippers covered his small feet.Lady Fenring, noting the young mans poise and the sure flow of muscles beneath the tunic, thought: Heres one who wont let himself go to fat.The Baron stopped in front of them, took Feyd Rauthas arm in a possessive grip, said, My nephew, the na Baron, Feyd Rautha Harkonnen.And, turning his baby fat face toward Feyd Rautha, he said, The Count and Lady Fenring of whom Ive spoken.Feyd Rautha dipped his head with the required courtesy.He stared at the Lady Fenring.She was golden haired and willowy, her perfection of figure clothed in a flowing gown of ecru  simple fitness of form without ornament.Gray green eyes stared back at him.She had that Bene Gesserit serene repose about her that the young man found subtly disturbing.Um m m m ah hm m m m, said the Count.He studied Feyd Rautha.The, hm m m m, precise young man, ah, my  hm m m m  dear?The Count glanced at the Baron.My dear Baron, you say youve spoken of us to this precise young man?What did you say?I told my nephew of the great esteem our Emperor holds for you, Count Fenring, the Baron said.And he thought: Mark him well, Feyd!A killer with the manners of a rabbit  this is the most dangerous kind.Of course!said the Count, and he smiled at his lady.Feyd Rautha found the mans actions and words almost insulting.They stopped just short of something overt that would require notice.The young man focused his attention on the Count: a small man, weak looking.The face was weaselish with overlarge dark eyes.There was gray at the temples.And his movements  he moved a hand or turned his head one way, then he spoke another way.It was difficult to follow.Um m m m ah h h hm m m, you come upon such, mm m m, preciseness so rarely, the Count said, addressing the Barons shoulder.I  ah, congratulate you on the hm m m perfection of your ah h h heir.In the light of the hm m m elder, one might say.You are too kind, the Baron said.He bowed, but Feyd Rautha noted that his uncles eyes did not agree with the courtesy.When youre mm m m ironic, that ah h h suggests youre hm m m m thinking deep thoughts, the Count said.There he goes again, Feyd Rautha thought.It sounds like hes being insulting, but theres nothing you can call out for satisfaction.Listening to the man gave Feyd Rautha the feeling his head was being pushed through mush  um m m ah h h hm m m m!Feyd Rautha turned his attention back to the Lady Fenring.Were ah h h taking up too much of this young mans time, she said.I understand hes to appear in the arena today.By the houris of the Imperial hareem, shes a lovely one!Feyd Rautha thought.He said: I shall make a kill for you this day, my Lady.I shall make the dedication in the arena, with your permission.She returned his stare serenely, but her voice carried whiplash as she said: You do not have my permission.Feyd!the Baron said.And he thought: That imp!Does he want this deadly Count to call him out?But the Count only smiled and said: Hm m m m um m m.   You really must be getting ready for the arena, Feyd, the Baron said.You must be rested and not take any foolish risks.Feyd Rautha bowed, his face dark with resentment.Im sure everything will be as you wish, Uncle.He nodded to Count Fenring.Sir.To the lady: My Lady.And he turned, strode out of the hall, barely glancing at the knot of Families Minor near the double doors.Hes so young, the Baron sighed.Um m m m ah indeed hmmm, the Count said.And the Lady Fenring thought: Can that be the young man the Reverend Mother meant!Is that a bloodline we must preserve?Weve more than an hour before going to the arena, the Baron said.Perhaps we could have our little talk now, Count Fenring.He tipped his gross head to the right.Theres a considerable amount of progress to be discussed.And the Baron thought: Let us see now how the Emperors errand boy gets across whatever message he carries without ever being so crass as to speak it right out.The Count spoke to his lady: Um m m m ah h h hm m m, you mm m will ah h h excuse us, my dear?Each day, some time each hour, brings change, she said.Mm m m m.  And she smiled sweetly at the Baron before turning away.Her long skirts swished and she walked with a straight backed regal stride toward the double doors at the end of the hall.The Baron noted how all conversation among the Houses Minor there stopped at her approach, how the eyes followed her.Bene Gesserit!the Baron thought.The universe would be better rid of them all!Theres a cone of silence between two of the pillars over here on our left, the Baron said.We can talk there without fear of being overheard.He led the way with his waddling gait into the sound deadening field, feeling the noises of the keep become dull and distant.The Count moved up beside the Baron, and they turned, facing the wall so their lips could not be read.Were not satisfied with the way you ordered the Sardaukar off Arrakis, the Count said.Straight talk!the Baron thought.The Sardaukar could not stay longer without risking that others would find out how the Emperor helped me, the Baron said.But your nephew Rabban does not appear to be pressing strongly enough toward a solution of the Fremen problem.What does the Emperor wish?the Baron asked.There cannot be more than a handful of Fremen left on Arrakis.The southern desert is uninhabitable.The northern desert is swept regularly by our patrols.Who says the southern desert is uninhabitable?Your own planetologist said it, my dear Count.But Doctor Kynes is dead.Ah, yes  unfortunate, that.Weve word from an overflight across the southern reaches, the Count said.Theres evidence of plant life.Has the Guild then agreed to a watch from space?You know better than that, Baron.The Emperor cannot legally post a watch on Arrakis.And I cannot afford it, the Baron said.Who made this overflight?A  smuggler.Someone has lied to you, Count, the Baron said.Smugglers cannot navigate the southern reaches any better than can Rabbans men.Storms, sand static, and all that, you know.Navigation markers are knocked out faster than they can be installed.Well discuss various types of static another time, the Count said.Ah h h h, the Baron thought.Have you found some mistake in my accounting then?he demanded.When you imagine mistakes there can be no self defense, the Count said.Hes deliberately trying to arouse my anger, the Baron thought.He took two deep breaths to calm himself.He could smell his own sweat, and the harness of the suspensors beneath his robe felt suddenly itchy and galling.The Emperor cannot be unhappy about the death of the concubine and the boy, the Baron said.They fled into the desert.There was a storm.Yes, there were so many convenient accidents, the Count agreed.I do not like your tone, Count, the Baron said.Anger is one thing, violence another, the Count said.Let me caution you: Should an unfortunate accident occur to me here the Great Houses all would learn what you did on Arrakis.Theyve long suspected how you do business.The only recent business I can recall, the Baron said, was transportation of several legions of Sardaukar to Arrakis.You think you could hold that over the Emperors head?I wouldnt think of it!The Count smiled.Sardaukar commanders could be found whod confess they acted without orders because they wanted a battle with your Fremen scum.Many might doubt such a confession, the Baron said, but the threat staggered him.Are Sardaukar truly that disciplined?he wondered.The Emperor does wish to audit your books, the Count said.Any time.You  ah  have no objections?None.My CHOAM Company directorship will bear the closest scrunity.And he thought: Let him bring a false accusation against me and have it exposed.I shall stand there, promethean, saying: Behold me, I am wronged.Then let him bring any other accusation against me, even a true one.The Great Houses will not believe a second attack from an accuser once proved wrong.No doubt your books will bear the closest scrutiny, the Count muttered.Why is the Emperor so interested in exterminating the Fremen?the Baron asked.You wish the subject to be changed, eh?The Count shrugged.It is the Sardaukar who wish it, not the Emperor.They needed practice in killing  and they hate to see a task left undone.Does he think to frighten me by reminding me that he is supported by bloodthirsty killers?the Baron wondered.A certain amount of killing has always been an arm of business, the Baron said, but a line has to be drawn somewhere.Someone must be left to work the spice.The Count emitted a short, barking laugh.You think you can harness the Fremen?There never were enough of them for that, the Baron said.But the killing has made the rest of my population uneasy.Its reaching the point where Im considering another solution to the Arrakeen problem, my dear Fenring.And I must confess the Emperor deserves credit for the inspiration.Ah h h?You see, Count, I have the Emperors prison planet, Salusa Secundus, to inspire me.The Count stared at him with glittering intensity.What possible connection is there between Arrakis and Salusa Secundus?The Baron felt the alertness in Fenrings eyes, said: No connection yet.Yet?You must admit itd be a way to develop a substantial work force on Arrakis  use the place as a prison planet.You anticipate an increase in prisoners?There has been unrest, the Baron admitted.Ive had to squeeze rather severely, Fenring.After all, you know the price I paid that damnable Guild to transport our mutual force to Arrakis.That money has to come from somewhere.I suggest you not use Arrakis as a prison planet without the Emperors permission, Baron.Of course not, the Baron said, and he wondered at the sudden chill in Fenrings voice.Another matter, the Count said.We learn that Duke Letos Mentat, Thufir Hawat, is not dead but in your employ.I could not bring myself to waste him, the Baron said.You lied to our Sardaukar commander when you said Hawat was dead.Only a white lie, my dear Count.I hadnt the stomach for a long argument with the man.Was Hawat the real traitor?Oh, goodness, no!It was the false doctor.The Baron wiped at perspiration on his neck.You must understand, Fenring, I was without a Mentat.You know that.Ive never been without a Mentat.It was most unsettling.How could you get Hawat to shift allegiance?His Duke was dead.The Baron forced a smile.Theres nothing to fear from Hawat, my dear Count.The Mentats flesh has been impregnated with a latent poison.We administer an antidote in his meals.Without the antidote, the poison is triggered  hed die in a few days.Withdraw the antidote, the Count said.But hes useful!And he knows too many things no living man should know.You said the Emperor doesnt fear exposure.Dont play games with me, Baron!When I see such an order above the Imperial seal Ill obey it, the Baron said.But Ill not submit to your whim.You think it whim?What else can it be?The Emperor has obligations to me, too, Fenring.I rid him of the troublesome Duke.With the help of a few Sardaukar.Where else would the Emperor have found a House to provide the disguising uniforms to hide his hand in this matter?He has asked himself the same question, Baron, but with a slightly different emphasis.The Baron studied Fenring, noting the stiffness of jaw muscles, the careful control.Ah h h, now, the Baron said.I hope the Emperor doesnt believe he can move against me in total secrecy.He hopes it wont become necessary.The Emperor cannot believe I threaten him!The Baron permitted anger and grief to edge his voice, thinking: Let him wrong me in that!I could place myself on the throne while still beating my breast over how Id been wronged.The Counts voice went dry and remote as he said: The Emperor believes what his senses tell him.Dare the Emperor charge me with treason before a full Landsraad Council?And the Baron held his breath with the hope of it.The Emperor need dare nothing.The Baron whirled away in his suspensors to hide his expression.It could happen in my lifetime!he thought.Emperor!Let him wrong me!Then  the bribes and coercion, the rallying of the Great Houses: theyd flock to my banner like peasants running for shelter.The thing they fear above all else is the Emperors Sardaukar loosed upon them one House at a time.Its the Emperors sincere hope hell never have to charge you with treason, the Count said.The Baron found it difficult to keep irony out of his voice and permit only the expresson of hurt, but he managed.Ive been a most loyal subject.These words hurt me beyond my capacity to express.Um m m m ah hm m m, said the Count.The Baron kept his back to the Count, nodding.Presently he said, Its time to go to the arena.Indeed, said the Count.They moved out of the cone of silence and, side by side, walked toward the clumps of Houses Minor at the end of the hall.A bell began a slow tolling somewhere in the keep  twenty minute warning for the arena gathering.The Houses Minor wait for you to lead them, the Count said, nodding toward the people they approached.Double meaning  double meaning, the Baron thought.He looked up at the new talismans flanking the exit to his hall  the mounted bulls head and the oil painting of the Old Duke Atreides, the late Duke Letos father.They filled the Baron with an odd sense of foreboding, and he wondered what thoughts these talismans had inspired in the Duke Leto as they hung in the halls of Caladan and then on Arrakis  the bravura father and the head of the bull that had killed him.Mankind has ah only one mm m m science, the Count said as they picked up their parade of followers and emerged from the hall into the waiting room  a narrow space with high windows and floor of patterned white and purple tile.And what science is that?the Baron asked.Its the um m m ah h science of ah h h discontent, the Count said.The Houses Minor behind them, sheep faced and responsive, laughed with just the right tone of appreciation, but the sound carried a note of discord as it collided with the sudden blast of motors that came to them when pages threw open the outer doors, revealing the line of ground cars, their guidon pennants whipping in a breeze.The Baron raised his voice to surmount the sudden noise, said, I hope youll not be discontented with the performance of my nephew today, Count Fenring.I ah h h am filled um m m only with a hm m m sense of anticipation, yes, the Count said.Always in the ah h h proces verbal, one um m m ah h h must consider the ah h h office of origin.The Baron hid his sudden stiffening of surprise by stumbling on the first step down from the exit.Proces verbal!That was a report of a crime against the Imperium!But the Count chuckled to make it seem a joke, and patted the Barons arm.All the way to the arena, though, the Baron sat back among the armored cushions of his car, casting covert glances at the Count beside him, wondering why the Emperors errand boy had thought it necessary to make that particular kind of joke in front of the Houses Minor.It was obvious that Fenring seldom did anything he felt to be unnecessary, or used two words where one would do, or held himself to a single meaning in a single phrase.They were seated in the golden box above the triangular arena  horns blaring, the tiers above and around them jammed with a hubbub of people and waving pennants  when the answer came to the Baron.My dear Baron, the Count said, leaning close to his ear, you know, dont you, that the Emperor has not given official sanction to your choice of heir?The Baron felt himself to be within a sudden personal cone of silence produced by his own shock.He stared at Fenring, barely seeing the Counts lady come through the guards beyond to join the party in the golden box.Thats really why Im here today, the Count said.The Emperor wishes me to report on whether youve chosen a worthy successor.Theres nothing like the arena to expose the true person from beneath the mask, eh?The Emperor promised me free choice of heir!the Baron grated.We shall see, Fenring said, and turned away to greet his lady.She sat down, smiling at the Baron, then giving her attention to the sand floor beneath them where Feyd Rautha was emerging in giles and tights  the black glove and the long knife in his right hand, the white glove and the short knife in his left hand.White for poison, black for purity, the Lady Fenring said.A curious custom, isnt it, my love?Um m m m, the Count said.The greeting cheer lifted from the family galleries, and Feyd Rautha paused to accept it, looking up and scanning the faces  seeing his cousines and cousins, the demibrothers, the concubines and out freyn relations.They were so many pink trumpet mouths yammering amidst a flutter of colorful clothing and banners.It came to Feyd Rautha then that the packed ranks of faces would look just as avidly at his blood as at that of the slave gladiator.There was not a doubt of the outcome in this fight, of course.Here was only the form of danger without its substance  yet   Feyd Rautha held up his knives to the sun, saluted the three comers of the arena in the ancient manner.The short knife in white gloved hand (white, the sign of poison) went first into its sheath.Then the long blade in the black gloved hand  the pure blade that now was unpure, his secret weapon to turn this day into a purely personal victory: poison on the black blade.The adjustment of his body shield took only a moment, and he paused to sense the skin tightening at his forehead assuring him he was properly guarded.This moment carried its own suspense, and Feyd Rautha dragged it out with the sure hand of a showman, nodding to his handlers and distractors, checking their equipment with a measuring stare  gyves in place with their prickles sharp and glistening, the barbs and hooks waving with their blue streamers.Feyd Rautha signaled the musicians.The slow march began, sonorous with its ancient pomp, and Feyd Rautha led his troupe across the arena for obeisance at the foot of his uncles box.He caught the ceremonial key as it was thrown.The music stopped.Into the abrupt silence, he stepped back two paces, raised the key and shouted: I dedicate this truth to  And he paused, knowing his uncle would think: The young fools going to dedicate to Lady Fenring after all and cause a ruckus!to my uncle and patron, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen!Feyd Rautha shouted.And he was delighted to see his uncle sigh.The music resumed at the quick march, and Feyd Rautha led his men scampering back across the arena to the prudence door that admitted only those wearing the proper identification band.Feyd Rautha prided himself that he never used the pru door and seldom needed distractors.But it was good to know they were available this day  special plans sometimes involved special dangers.Again, silence settled over the arena.Feyd Rautha turned, faced the big red door across from him through which the gladiator would emerge.The special gladiator.The plan Thufir Hawat had devised was admirably simple and direct, Feyd Rautha thought.The slave would not be drugged  that was the danger.Instead, a key word had been drummed into the mans unconscious to immobilize his muscles at a critical instant.Feyd Rautha rolled the vital word in his mind, mouthing it without sound: Scum!To the audience, it would appear that an undrugged slave had been slipped into the arena to kill the na Baron.And all the carefully arranged evidence would point to the slavemaster.A low humming arose from the red doors servo motors as they were armed for opening.Feud Rautha focused all his awareness on the door.This first moment was the critical one.The appearance of the gladiator as he emerged told the trained eye much it needed to know.All gladiators were supposed to be hyped on elacca drug to come out kill ready in fighting stance  but you had to watch how they hefted the knife, which way they turned in defense, whether they were actually aware of the audience in the stands.The way a slave cocked his head could give the most vital clue to counter and feint.The red door slammed open.Out charged a tall, muscular man with shaved head and darkly pitted eyes.His skin was carrot colored as it should be from the elacca drug, but Feyd Rautha knew the color was paint.The slave wore green leotards and the red belt of a semishield  the belts arrow pointing left to indicate the slaves left side was shielded.He held his knife sword fashion, cocked slightly outward in the stance of a trained fighter.Slowly, he advanced into the arena, turning his shielded side toward Feyd Rautha and the group at the pru door.I like not the look of this one, said one of Feyd Rauthas barb men.Are you sure hes drugged, mLord?He has the color, Feyd Rautha said.Yet he stands like a fighter, said another helper.Feyd Rautha advanced two steps onto the sand, studied this slave.What has he done to his arm?asked one of the distractors.Feyd Rauthas attention went to a bloody scratch on the mans left forearm, followed the arm down to the hand as it pointed to a design drawn in blood on the left hip of the green leotards  a wet shape there; the formalized outline of a hawk.Hawk!Feyd Rautha looked up into the darkly pitted eyes, saw them glaring at him with uncommon alertness.Its one of Duke Letos fighting men we took on Arrakis!Feyd Rautha thought.No simple gladiator this!A chill ran through him, and he wondered if Hawat had another plan for this arena  a feint within a feint within a feint.And only the slavemaster prepared to take the blame!Feyd Rauthas chief handler spoke at his ear: I like not the look on that one, mLord.Let me set a barb or two in his left arm to try him.Ill set my own barbs, Feyd Rautha said.He took a pair of long, hooked shafts from the handler, hefted them, testing the balance.These barbs, too, were supposed to be drugged  but not this time, and the chief handler might die because of that.But it was all part of the plan.Youll come out of this a hero, Hawat had said.Killed your gladiator man to man and in spite of treachery.The slavemaster will be executed and your man will step into his spot.Feyd Rautha advanced another five paces into the arena, playing out the moment, studying the slave.Already, he knew, the experts in the stands above him were aware that something was wrong.The gladiator had the correct skin color for a drugged man, but he stood his ground and did not tremble.The aficionados would be whispering among themselves now: See how he stands.He should be agitated  attacking or retreating.See how he conserves his strength, how he waits.He should not wait.Feyd Rautha felt his own excitement kindle.Let there be treachery in Hawats mind, he thought.I can handle this slave.And its my long knife that carries the poison this time, not the short one.Even Hawat doesnt know that.Hai, Harkonnen!the slave called.Are you prepared to die?Deathly stillness gripped the arena.Slaves did not issue the challenge!Now, Feyd Rautha had a clear view of the gladiators eyes, saw the cold ferocity of despair in them.He marked the way the man stood, loose and ready, muscles prepared for victory.The slave grapevine had carried Hawats message to this one: Youll get a true chance to kill the na Baron.That much of the scheme was as theyd planned it, then.A tight smile crossed Feyd Rauthas mouth.He lifted the barbs, seeing success for his plans in the way the gladiator stood.Hai!Hai!the slave challenged, and crept forward two steps.No one in the galleries can mistake it now, Feyd Rautha thought.This slave should have been partly crippled by drug induced terror.Every movement should have betrayed his inner knowledge that there was no hope for him  he could not win.He should have been filled with the stories of the poisons the na Baron chose for the blade in his white gloved hand.The na Baron never gave quick death; he delighted in demonstrating rare poisons, could stand in the arena pointing out interesting side effects on a writhing victim.There was fear in the slave, yes  but not terror.Feyd Rautha lifted the barbs high, nodded in an almost greeting.The gladiator pounced.His feint and defensive counter were as good as any Feyd Rautha had ever seen.A timed side blow missed by the barest fraction from severing the tendons of the na Barons left leg.Feyd Rautha danced away, leaving a barbed shaft in the slaves right forearm, the hooks completely buried in flesh where the man could not withdraw them without ripping tendons.A concerted gasp lifted from the galleries.The sound filled Feyd Rautha with elation.He knew now what his uncle was experiencing, sitting up there with the Fenrings, the observers from the Imperial Court, beside him.There could be no interference with this fight.The forms must be observed in front of witnesses.And the Baron would interpret the events in the arena only one way  threat to himself.The slave backed, holding knife in teeth and lashing the barbed shaft to his arm with the pennant.I do not feel your needle!he shouted.Again he crept forward, knife ready, left side presented, the body bent backward to give it the greatest surface of protection from the half shield.That action, too, didnt escape the galleries.Sharp cries came from the family boxes, Feyd Rauthas handlers were calling out to ask if he needed them.He waved them back to the pru door.Ill give them a show such as theyve never had before, Feyd Rautha thought.No tame killing where they can sit back and admire the style.Thisll be something to take them by the guts and twist them.When Im Baron theyll remember this day and wont be a one of them can escape fear of me because of this day.Feyd Rautha gave ground slowly before the gladiators crablike advance.Arena sand grated underfoot.He heard the slaves panting, smelled his own sweat and a faint odor of blood on the air.Steadily, the na Baron moved backward, turning to the right, his second barb ready.The slave danced sideways.Feyd Rautha appeared to stumble, heard the scream from the galleries.Again, the slave pounced.Gods, what a fighting man!Feyd Rautha thought as he leaped aside.Only youths quickness saved him, but he left the second barb buried in the deltoid muscle of the slaves right arm.Shrill cheers rained from the galleries.They cheer me now, Feyd Rautha thought.He heard the wildness in the voices just as Hawat had said he would.Theyd never cheered a family fighter that way before.And he thought with an edge of grimness on a thing Hawat had told him: Its easier to be terrified by an enemy you admire.Swiftly, Feyd Rautha retreated to the center of the arena where all could see clearly.He drew his long blade, crouched and waited for the advancing slave.The man took only the time to lash the second barb tight to his arm, then sped in pursuit.Let the family see me do this thing, Feyd Rautha thought.I am their enemy: let them think of me as they see me now.He drew his short blade.I do not fear you, Harkonnen swine, the gladiator said.Your tortures cannot hurt a dead man.I can be dead on my own blade before a handler lays finger to my flesh.And Ill have you dead beside me!Feyd Rautha grinned, offered now the long blade, the one with the poison.Try this one, he said, and feinted with the short blade in his other hand.The slave shifted knife hands, turned inside both parry and feint to grapple the na Barons short blade  the one in the white gloved hand that tradition said should carry the poison.You will die, Harkonnen, the gladiator gasped.They struggled sideways across the sand.Where Feyd Rauthas shield met the slaves halfshield, a blue glow marked the contact.The air around them filled with ozone from the fields.Die on your own poison!the slave grated.He began forcing the white gloved hand inward, turning the blade he thought carried the poison.Let them see this!Feyd Rautha thought.He brought down the long blade, felt it clang uselessly against the barbed shaft lashed to the slaves arm.Feyd Rautha felt a moment of desperation.He had not thought the barbed shafts would be an advantage for the slave.But they gave the man another shield.And the strength of this gladiator!The short blade was being forced inward inexorably, and Feyd Rautha focused on the fact that a man could also die on an unpoisoned blade.Scum!Feyd Rautha gasped.At the key word, the gladiators muscles obeyed with a momentary slackness.It was enough for Feyd Rautha.He opened a space between them sufficient for the long blade.Its poisoned tip flicked out, drew a red line down the slaves chest.There was instant agony in the poison.The man disengaged himself, staggered backward.Now, let my dear family watch, Feyd Rautha thought.Let them think on this slave who tried to turn the knife he thought poisoned and use it against me.Let them wonder how a gladiator could come into this arena ready for such an attempt.And let them always be aware they cannot know for sure which of my hands carries the poison.Feyd Rautha stood in silence, watching the slowed motions of the slave.The man moved within a hesitation awareness.There was an orthographic thing on his face now for every watcher to recognize.The death was written there.The slave knew it had been done to him and he knew how it had been done.The wrong blade had carried the poison.You!the man moaned.Feyd Rautha drew back to give death its space.The paralyzing drug in the poison had yet to take full effect, but the mans slowness told of its advance.The slave staggered forward as though drawn by a string  one dragging step at a time.Each step was the only step in his universe.He still clutched his knife, but its point wavered.One day  one  of us  will  get  you, he gasped.A sad little moue contorted his mouth.He sat, sagged, then stiffened and rolled away from Feyd Rautha, face down.Feyd Rautha advanced in the silent arena, put a toe under the gladiator and rolled him onto his back to give the galleries a clear view of the face when the poison began its twisting, wrenching work on the muscles.But the gladiator came over with his own knife protruding from his breast.In spite of the frustration, there was for Feyd Rautha a measure of admiration for the effort this slave had managed in overcoming the paralysis to do this thing to himself.With the admiration came the realization that here was truly a thing to fear.That which makes a man superhuman is terrifying.As he focused on this thought, Feyd Rautha became conscious of the eruption of noise from the stands and galleries around him.They were cheering with utter abandon.Feyd Rautha turned, looking up at them.All were cheering except the Baron, who sat with hand to chin in deep contemplation  and the Count and his lady, both of whom were staring down at him, their faces masked by smiles.Count Fenring turned to his lady, said: Ah h h um m m, a resourceful um m m m young man.Eh, mm m m ah, my dear?His ah h h synaptic responses are very swift, she said.The Baron looked at her, at the Count, returned his attention to the arena: If someone could get that close to one of mine!Rage began to replace his fear.Ill have the slavemaster dead over a slow fire this night  and if this Count and his lady had a hand in it  The conversation in the Barons box was remote movement to Feyd Rautha, the voices drowned in the foot stamping chant that came now from all around:  Head!Head!Head!Head!The Baron scowled, seeing the way Feyd Rautha turned to him.Languidly, controlling his rage with difficulty, the Baron waved his hand toward the young man standing in the arena beside the sprawled body of the slave.Give the boy a head.He earned it by exposing the slavemaster.Feyd Rautha saw the signal of agreement, thought: They think they honor me.Let them see what I think!He saw his handlers approaching with a saw knife to do the honors, waved them back, repeated the gesture as they hesitated.They think they honor me with just a head!he thought.He bent and crossed the gladiators hands around the protruding knife handle, then removed the knife and placed it in the limp hands.It was done in an instant, and he straightened, beckoned his handlers.Bury this slave intact with his knife in his hands, he said.The man earned it.In the golden box, Count Fenring leaned close to the Baron, said: A grand gesture, that  true bravura.Your nephew has style as well as courage.He insults the crowd by refusing the head, the Baron muttered.Not at all, Lady Fenring said.She turned, looking up at the tiers around them.And the Baron noted the line of her neck  a truly lovely flowing of muscles  like a young boys.They like what your nephew did, she said.As the import of Feyd Rauthas gesture penetrated to the most distant seats, as the people saw the handlers carrying off the dead gladiator intact, the Baron watched them and realized she had interpreted the reaction correctly.The people were going wild, beating on each other, screaming and stamping.The Baron spoke wearily.I shall have to order a fete.You cannot send people home like this, their energies unspent.They must see that I share their elation.He gave a hand signal to the guard, and a servant above them dipped the Harkonnen orange pennant over the box  once, twice, three times  signal for a fete.Feyd Rautha crossed the arena to stand beneath the golden box, his weapons sheathed, arms hanging at his sides.Above the undiminished frenzy of the crowd, he called: A fete, Uncle?The noise began to subside as people saw the conversation and waited.In your honor, Feyd!the Baron called down.And again, he caused the pennant to be dipped in signal.Across the arena, the pru barriers had been dropped and young men were leaping down into the arena, racing toward Feyd Rautha.You ordered the pru shields dropped, Baron?the Count asked.No one will harm the lad, the Baron said.Hes a hero.The first of the charging mass reached Feyd Rautha, lifted him on their shoulders, began parading around the arena.He could walk unarmed and unshielded through the poorest quarters of Harko tonight, the Baron said.Theyd give him the last of their food and drink just for his company.The Baron pushed himself from his chair, settled his weight into his suspensors.You will forgive me, please.There are matters that require my immediate attention.The guard will see you to the keep.The Count arose, bowed.Certainly, Baron.Were looking forward to the fete.Ive ah h h mm m m never seen a Harkonnen fete.Yes, the Baron said.The fete.He turned, was enveloped by guards as he stepped into the private exit from the box.A guard captain bowed to Count Fenring.Your orders, my Lord?We will ah h h wait for the worst mm m m crush to um m m pass, the Count said.Yes, mLord.The man bowed himself back three paces.Count Fenring faced his lady, spoke again in their personal humming code tongue: You saw it, of course?In the same humming tongue, she said: The lad knew the gladiator wouldnt be drugged.There was a moment of fear, yes, but no surprise.It was planned, he said.The entire performance.Without a doubt.It stinks of Hawat.Indeed, she said.I demanded earlier that the Baron eliminate Hawat.That was an error, my dear.I see that now.The Harkonnens may have a new Baron ere long.If thats Hawats plan.That will bear examination, true, she said.The young one will be more amenable to control.For us  after tonight, she said.You dont anticipate difficulty seducing him, my little brood mother?No, my love.You saw how he looked at me.Yes, and I can see now why we must have that bloodline.Indeed, and its obvious we must have a hold on him.Ill plant deep in his deepest self the necessary prana bindu phrases to bend him.Well leave as soon as possible  as soon as youre sure, he said.She shuddered.By all means.I should not want to bear a child in this terrible place.The things we do in the name of humanity, he said.Yours is the easy part, she said.There are some ancient prejudices I overcome, he said.Theyre quite primordial, you know.My poor dear, she said, and patted his cheek.You know this is the only way to be sure of saving that bloodline.
