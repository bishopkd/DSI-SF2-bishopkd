Or sport a piratical grin.Why am I being treated like this?he asked.The little man looked incredulous.He appeared to be about to hurt Fassin again, then shook his head in exasperation.Because you took part in a violent demonstration against the Diegesian, thats why!he said.But I wasnt violent, Fassin said.You personally may not have been.The demonstration you took part in most certainly was.Fassin would have scratched his head.Is that all it takes?Of course!Who started the violence?he asked.The little man jerked his arms out to each side.His voice went very high.Does it matter?Fassin had meant which side, but he could tell the little man thought hed meant which demonstrator.He sighed.Look, I just want to get back to my friends, to my nest.Can I go?I didnt do anything, I got my teeth knocked out, I cant tell you anything, or anything he said.He sighed again.You can go when you sign this.The little man swivelled the screen around so Fassin could see.He looked at what he was supposed to sign, and at the fingerprint pad and camera patches on the screen which would record that it had really been him signing (or, more to the point, make a fake document take up a fraction more storage space).I cant sign this, he said.It basically says my friends are all Beyonder agents and deserve death.The little man rolled his eyes.Read it carefully, will you?It just says you have suspicions in that regard.You dont seriously think your word would be enough to convict anybody of anything, do you?Well then, why get me to?We want you to betray them!the little man shouted, as though it was the most obvious thing ever.We want you to turn your back on them and become a productive member of society.Thats all.But theyre my friends.Fassin coughed, swallowed.Look, could I get a drink of water?No.You cant.And theyre not your friends.Theyre just people you know.Theyre barely acquaintances.You got drunk with them, got stoned with them, talked a bit with them and slept with some of them.Youll all go your separate ways soon enough anyway and probably never keep in touch.They are not your friends.Accept that.Fassin thought better of debating what being a friend meant, in the circumstances.Well, Im still not betraying them.Theyve betrayed you!The little interrogator swung the screen round, clicked on a few patches and swung it back.Fassin watched Thay, Sonj and Mome  all stuck in seats like the one he was secured in, and Sonj looking pretty beaten up  say they thought that Fassin held Beyonder sympathies and was a danger to society who needed watching.They each mumbled something to that effect, signed the screen and pressed a thumb against the print patch (Sonjs left a smear of blood).The screenage shook him.It had probably been faked, but all the same.He sat back.You faked that, he said, unsteadily.The little man laughed.Are you mad?Why would we bother?I dont know, Fass admitted.But I know my friends.They wouldnt  The little man sat forward.So just sign this and in the highly unlikely event that it ever crops up, just say yours has been faked.So why not fake it anyway?Fassin shouted.Because then you wont have betrayed them!the little man yelled back.Come on!Sign and you can go.Ive got better things to do.But why do any of this?Fassin said, wanting to cry.Why make anybody betray anybody?The little man looked at him for a moment.Mr Taak, he said, sitting back, sounding patient.Ive inspected your profile.You are not stupid.Misguided, idealistic, naive, certainly, but not stupid.You must know how societies work.You must at least have an inkling.They work on force, power and coercion.People dont behave themselves because theyre nice.Thats the liberal fallacy.People behave themselves because if they dont theyll be punished.All this is known.It isnt even debatable.Civilisation after civilisation, society after society, species after species, all show the same pattern.Society is control: control is reward and punishment.Reward is being allowed to partake of the fruits of that society and, as a general but not unbreakable rule, not being punished without cause.But  Be quiet.The idiotic issue you chose to complain about  ownership of a habitat  really has nothing to do with you.Its a legal matter, an ownership thing.You werent even born here and you wouldnt have stayed beyond a few more months anyway, admit it.You should have kept out of it.You chose not to, you put yourself in harms way and now youre paying the price.Part of that price is letting us know that you have made an effort to dissociate yourself from the people you were complicit with.Once you do that, you can go.Home, I would suggest.I mean to glantine.And if I say no?You mean not sign?Yes.Seriously?Seriously.Then its taken out of my hands.Youll go to meet people who enjoy doing this sort of thing.This time, when the little man moved his hand over the desk, Fassin screamed with the pain.He must have bitten his tongue.There was a taste of iron and his mouth filled with fresh blood and hot saliva.Because I, the little man said wearily, dont.In the end Fassin signed.Hed kind of known he would.The little man looked happy, and a couple of big female guards came in and helped Fassin from the chair, his bonds unfastened.Thank you, Mr Taak, the little man said, and grasped his hand and shook it before they took him out of the room.I hate all that unpleasantness, and it is always so good to see somebody being sensible.Try not to think too badly of me.Good luck to you.They got him showered down and fixed up and he left after a medical and a cup of soup, dressed in paper thin overalls.He looked around when they ushered him through the doorways into what passed for outside in a hab.Hed been somewhere inside the Diegesians palace.Back at the nest, turmoil.The place had been raided, trashed, everything in it broken or sprayed with stinking, vomit inducing crowd control goo.They went to a bar instead and didnt really talk about anything after the protest and the crackdown.They talked instead of rumours of people being killed and others disappearing.K wasnt there.Shed been beaten up when the troopers came to turn the nest over.She was in a prison hospital ship for three weeks, then killed herself with a broken glass the day she was released.It was months before Fassin learned the truth.K had been sent into a nightmare tream.Somebody whod come with the law officers  maybe just one of them who happened to know how to handle tream gear  had found her still floating, not yet out of the delving tream, and altered the settings on the traumalyser and the subsal while some others had held her down and worked her over.Whoever did the thing with the traumalyser must have carried that sort of template chip around with them, just for such eventualities.Then theyd left her, bloody and bound, to some speeded up nightmare of horror, rape and torture.They were all split up, doing other, mostly more responsible things when they pieced all this together.They talked about a complaint, an investigation, a protest.Fassin went back to glantine and booked a place on the Seer induction course for the term after next.Then he returned to the habs, and then to Sepektes Boogeytown, to the roaring life, the drink and drugs and fucking and fun, and  after a while, gradually, carefully  made a few inquiries, hung out in the right places, and met certain people.Apparently he passed a few tests without realising hed been taking them, and then one night he was introduced to a girl who called herself Aun Liss.* * *  Fassin!His name jolted him awake.Third Fury; cabin.Still night dark.Clanging noise.The screen showed hour Four.The screen was red and flashing.Had somebody spoken?What?he said, tearing the restraints away and levering himself out of bed, floating towards the centre of the cabin.Herv Apsile, said a voice.Sounded like Apsile.Sounded like Apsile in a state of some excitement or distress.We have a situation.Looks like an attack.Oh, shit.Fassin pulled on clothes, called up full lights.That fucking horrendous clanging noise the alarm?Thats right.You in Facility Command?Yes.Who do we think?A light flashed over a storage locker and it revolved, revealing an emergency esuit.Dont know.Two naval units vaporised already.Get suited and  The lights  all the lights  flickered.The screen did not come back on.A tremor made the cabin shake.Something broke in the bathroom with a sharp crack.You feel that?You still there?Apsile said.Yes to both, Fassin said.He was looking at the esuit.Suit up and take a drop shaft to the emergency shelter.Apsile paused.You got that?Another pause.Fass?Here.Fassin started pulling all his clothes off again.That what youre going to do, Herv?Thats what were both supposed to do.Another tremble made the whole cabin rattle.The air seemed to quake like jelly.The alarm shut off.Somehow, though, not in an encouraging way.The screen flashed once, screeched.Fassin hauled the esuit out of its locker.Hows the main hangar?he asked.Intact.Whatevers hitting us seems to be coming in from the Nasq spin side, slightly retro.So heading into the centres going to be putting us closer, Fassin said.Was that a draught?He could hear a hissing sound.He clipped the esuit collar round his neck and let the gel helmet deploy.It turned everything hazy and quiet for a moment, then decided the situation wasnt too dire yet, and opened slits for him to breathe, talk and hear through.The face mask section thinned to near perfect transparency.For now, Apsile agreed.If the direction of the hostile fire stays constant well be coming round to face it full on in two hours.Fassin stepped into the esuit and pulled it up, letting it connect with the collar, adjusting to his body, huffing and settling.Very comfortable, really.That what you want to do, Herv?Sit in a huddle with everybody else like mice in a hole hoping the cat goes away?Standing orders.I know.Want to guess what I want to do?There was a pause.Another more violent tremor shook the cabin.The main door popped open, wobbling inwards, revealing the companionway outside.The pause went on.Herv?he asked.He looked round for anything he might want to take with him.Nothing.Herv?Ill see you there.Something blazed hard and blue white against Nasquerons side lit face, turning the hangar into a harsh jagged jumble of fiercely shining surfaces and intensely black shadows.Fassin flinched.The light faded quickly, turning to yellow and orange; a small fading sun shone between the moon and Nasqueron.Herv Apsile had got there ahead of him.He gave a quick wave and easily jumped the eight metres to the open nose blister of the carrier craft, disappearing inside.The nose blister closed.Herv?Fassin said, trying the suits emergency comms.No answer.He made slow bounds for the open hold.Colonel Hatherence was already there, the tall discus of her esuit floating a fraction above the floor directly beneath the place shed filled earlier.Seer Taak!I rather thought you might adopt this course!she shouted.Shit, Fassin thought.Hed kind of hoped the colonel would have made her way to the emergency shelter in the moons core, ten kilometres down, along with everybody else, like theyd all been told to.There was one drop shaft big enough, wasnt there?Oh well.He came to a stop beneath the little arrowhead gascraft hanging in its cradle directly above.Colonel, he said, nodding.Would she try to stop him?No idea.Could she?No doubt about that.Not sure whether to be relieved or terrified, the colonel yelled.A manipulator arm creased out from the side of the oerileithe esuit, unfolding towards Fassin.Oh, fuck, he thought.Here we go.After you!the colonel said, her arm indicating the space above.Fassin smiled and jumped.She rose with a whirr beside him.Stopped and then braced by the ceiling of the hold, he flipped open the cockpit of the little gascraft, revealing a vaguely coffin shaped space.He shucked the suit and unclipped the helmet.Out of uniform, major, the colonel said jovially, voice echoing in the enclosed space of the upper hold.Fassin let the suit fall slowly to the floor beneath and stepped into the foot of the little arrowheads cockpit.Gracious!Hatherence said.Are all human males of this form?Just the handsome ones, colonel, he assured her.He lowered himself carefully into the cool gel.The cockpit cover closed over him.He wriggled in the darkness, getting his neck positioned over the scanner collar.A soft light and a gentle chime confirmed all was well.He reached for the double nozzle of the gillfluid root, took a deep breath, let it out, then placed the nozzles at his nostrils.Fassin lay back, zoning out as best he could, fighting the urge to panic, the gag response of fear as the gillfluid poured into his nose, throat and lungs like the coldest drink anybody had ever taken.A moment of confusion, disorientation.Then the collar nestling closer against his neck and the warming gel closing over his body, tendrils seeking out ears, mouth, penis and anus.Twin stings of pain on his forearms, then another pair, one under each ear, as the blood slides went in.Set?said the voice of Herv Apsile, gurgling through the still calibrating gel in his ears.Thoroughly, he sent back just by thinking.And the colonel?I am set, also!Even over comms, it seemed, Colonel Hatherence tended to shout.Fassin had been wondering if they could leave her behind somehow.Probably not, then.Hold doors closing.Ready to go, Apsile said.Fassin started to become his little gascraft.It covered him, embraced him, multiply penetrated him, and in those acts offered itself up to him completely.The light from below disappeared as the hold doors closed.He could see Colonel Hatherences esuit hanging beside him, sense its cold and read its electromagnetic signature, just as he could feel the systems of the drop ship readying, flexing, preparing, changing as the ship nudged itself off the floor.Other senses registered an unusual wash of radiations, a faint gravity well set in a much greater, deeper one, a slather of meaningless comms shards, confused transmissions and EM signals from the Shared Facility base itself  and a sudden jolt, a transmitted faint but massive thud followed by a strange sideways, upwards sucking movement.He waited for Apsile to talk to them, meanwhile trying to work it out himself.Distant whirr and hiss of the carrier tanking the air in its hold.Sorry about that, Apsile said mildly.Back in control.Unconventional method of opening the hangar to vacuum there.No idea who to thank.We okay?Fassin asked.NSD, Apsile said, sounding mildly distracted.No Significant Damage.Let you get on with it, Fassin sent.Thanks.Cancel relief, emphasise terror, the colonel said.Fassin hoped she was talking only to him.He checked through all the little gascrafts settings and systems, settling into it as its life support tendrils settled into him.Something like a wide array of lights seen from the bottom corner of the eye swung into focus in front of him.He called up a few read outs and started a couple of subroutines to check that everything was working.Seemed to be.He felt the carrier accelerate away from the moon.Patch through to the larger ships senses suddenly appeared as an option on his controls and he took it.Now he could experience pretty much what Apsile could.Nasqueron filling the sky ahead and up, the grey brown surface of Third Fury disappearing fast below and behind.Debris clouds.Comms shards.More than there ought to be in a properly organised fleetlet like the one that had brought them here and that had been guarding the moon.No sign of illuminating radar or other targeting give away.Not that a civilian ship like the carrier would be able to spot any but the most glaringly obvious.No current damage flags, just records of a few small hull impacts, little more than pitting.Ship drive traces.A sudden flare of radiation as a ship turned hard a couple of hundred klicks away, dying away.Outgoing signal loop, broadcasting their unarmed condition, claiming lifeboat status.Flash!From right behind.A near semicircular debris cloud rising glittering from a new glowing crater maybe half a klick across on the surface of Third Fury.Three smaller craters coming into view, recent but cooled down to orange and red heat.The view twisted, overlays of lines and grids and drive symbols flickering into being.Apsile pointed the carriers nose straight at Nasqueron and started a long, purposefully irregular corkscrew towards the gas giant, accelerating the drop ship as hard as its engines would allow.The drop ship was no sort of high performance military unit; all it was supposed to do was take the gascraft from the Facility to the gas giant and pick them up later.It was rugged, able to take the strain of operating inside Nasquerons gravity well and its various pressure environments down to the liquid hydrogen level, and it had the power to lift itself and its charges easily enough out of Nasquerons grip.But it was not especially manoeuvrable, carried no armament or defensive systems and far from being stealthed had been designed from its invitation to tender spec, onwards to be as easy to see with as many different senses as it was possible to imagine, just so that no mischievous Dweller could crash something into it and then claim, sorry, they hadnt seen it.How you doing down there?Apsile asked.He sounded in control, unworried.Fine, for myself, the colonel said.Ditto, Fassin sent.Got an ETA yet?Trips from Third Fury to Nasq.usually took about an hour.Fassin hoped they could do it in less than half that.With the main drive maxed we should make turnaround in about ten minutes, Apsile said, then decelerate for another ten and then take hmm, another handful  five at most, Id hope  to get deep enough into the atmosphere.He meant deep enough into the atmosphere to be beyond any but the most scary weapons.Obviously not counting the scary weapons the Dwellers possessed.Anything we can clip off that?Fassin asked.Maybe we could make it down in less time once we hit the cloud tops, Apsile said.Steeper, carrying more speed.Maybe.Hmm.Fassin got the impression somehow that the man was rubbing his chin.Yes, maybe, if we let the heat and stress levels creep just a tad beyond tolerance.A pause.Though of course thats always assuming that the ship didnt take any damage we dont know about when the hangar dome got blown.Always assuming, Fassin agreed.Master Technician, Colonel Hatherence said, are we being pursued or under unit specific attack?No, colonel.Then I suggest we adopt your first entry profile.Decisions yours alone, Herv, Fassin sent.Copy.Can you access any military comms traffic, Master Technician?Im afraid not, maam, not unless they choose to target us with a clear beam or broadcast.That is unfortunate.What seems to be happening?Looks like theres been some sort of firefight.Still going on, possibly.Drives spreading away from the moon, heading in the direction the hostile munitions appeared to be coming from.Woh!The flash attracted Fassins second hand attention as well; another, even larger crater glowing white on the surface of Third Fury.What of the people still back within the Third Fury moonlet?the colonel asked.Been listening, Apsile said.Ill try and contact them direct.Give me a moment.Silence.Fassin watched space wheel around them through the carrier ships sensors.He checked the drop ships system profile, oriented, then searched for and found glantine; a tiny shining dot, far away.The sensors let him zoom in until the planet moon was a shining gibbous image, scintillating with magnification artefacts, hints of its topography just about visible.Could that be the uplands?There, that light patch  the Sea of Fines?A spark.There, back up A tiny flash?Had he seen that?Something colder and more invasive than any gel tendril seemed to invade him, clutching at his stomach and heart.No, surely not.Just another artefact of the system.He looked for the sensor replay controls.Shit, theres a fucking wreckage Apsile said, then the craft bucked and swung.Fassin, turning his focus of attention back to what Apsile was looking at saw it too now: a field of dark specks across the face of the planet ahead of them like a ragged flock of birds far in the distance.They were at near maximum velocity.The carrier started to turn.A rush of dark scraps, tearing by on all sides like a thin shell of soot black snow flakes.Fassin felt his arms, held by the cloying shock gel, attempt to draw themselves in towards his body, instinctively trying to make himself a smaller target.Then they were through.No impacts.After a moment, Fassin felt the drop ship start to swing round to present its drive tubes towards the planet, ready to begin deceleration.I think, Apsile said cautiously, that we just about got away with  Something slammed into them.The ship lurched  there was a concussive snap!that Fassin felt through the carrier ship, through the gascraft, even through the shock gel.He lost the patch through connection with the drop ship.He was back in his own little arrowhead again.They were whirling.And there was light, synched with the whirling.Light?It was coming from below, where the hold doors were.He could see Colonel Hs esuit, hanging alongside him.Oh oh  The ship began to come out of the spin, steadying.The light from below faded but did not go away.It had the spectrum to be light reflected from Nasqueron.Light from the gas giant coming in through supposedly closed doors.Fassin flipped the gascrafts sensor ring to look straight down at the doors.Oh fuck, he tried to say.There was a small but ragged hole, stuff hanging like spilled guts.The Nasqueron light was reflecting in off some polished looking surfaces.Force, building; very like the main drive decelerating them more or less on schedule.He retried the intercom, then broadcast a radio signal.Herv?Here.Sorry about that.Hit something after all.Got her straight and rearward.Back on track.No read outs from the hold at all, though.Including the door.Think thats where it hit.I can see a hole.How big?Maybe a metre lateral by two.I too can see the hole, the colonel told them, also joining in the radio broadcast fun.It is as Seer Taak describes.Too small for you guys to get out of, Apsile said.Hows the rest of the ship?Fassin sent.Holding together for now.Cant see where whatever hit us exited, or just went on to hit inside.I suspect it hit me, Hatherence said.My esuit casing, that is to say.Probably.A pause.Then Apsile said, And are you all right?Perfectly fine.Your hold doors took most of the energy out of it and my esuit is of exceptional quality, durability and damage tolerance.Scarcely a scratch.If we cant open the doors, we cant get out and the whole things pointless, Herv, Fassin sent.We can still hide in the carrier, under the clouds, Apsile said.Im not getting much from the Facility.That last hit looked like it must have shaken them pretty hard.We might still be safer under the gas than hanging around out here in clear view of whoever.Nothing comprehensible was coming out of the Shared Facility on Third Fury, and no military vessels were talking on civilian frequencies.Interference on EM bands, a problem at the best of times anywhere near Nasqueron, was especially intense.Apsile raised a couple of the Facilitys equatorial relay satellites, but, exceptionally, could not through patch via their transceivers and could get only static and meaningless rubbish out of them.He even tried some Dweller mirror sats, where the surprise would have been getting anything other than drivel, but there the service was perfectly normal.Ouch, they heard him say.Third Fury just took another hit.Were going in.Fairly slowly, to allow for the damage, but were going in.Whatever you think is best, Master Technician, the colonel said.The carrier craft began to shudder as it met the upper atmosphere of Nasqueron, carving a glowing trail above the cloud tops.They slowed.Weight began to return to them.And kept on increasing.Creaks and ticking sounds came through the solids joining them to the drop ship.The buffeting decreased, grew and fell away again; soft whumps and crisp bangs also communicated through the drop ships structure announced debris being torn off the ragged surrounds of the breach in the hold doors, which glowed and sparked as the space around them filled with gas and Fassin began to detect sound in the hold again.They were getting heavy, really heavy now.Fassin could feel the shock gel tightening around him, like the sound of snow cramping beneath your feet.He could almost sense any remaining gas bubbles in his body pancaking like blood cells.Good and heavy now  Master Technician, the colonel said suddenly.Hold on, Apsile said.That  The whole ship shook once, then rolled suddenly.Herv?Fassin sent.Got some sort of targeting Apsile began, then broke off as the craft shook again and slewed wildly across the sky.We are indeed being targeted by something, Hatherence announced.Master Technician, she shouted across the frequencies.Are you yet able to release us?Eh?What?No!I  Master Technician, attempt to perform a roll or part of an internal loop on my command, Hatherence told him.Ishall release us.You will?Apsile shouted.I shall.I will.I carry weapons.Now, excuse me, and good luck.Wait a minute, Fassin began.Seer Taak, the colonel said tersely, shield your senses.The big discus hanging beside him sent a pulse of blinding blue white light straight downward at the doors, which blew away in a brief gout of sparks.Rushing yellow brown clouds spun by outside.Fassins little arrowcraft was seeing spots.It got busy shuffling its damaged sensors round for working ones.He guessed he hadnt shielded his senses in time.He shut them down now.Releasing in three seconds, the colonel said.Make your manoeuvre now if you please, Master Technician.A blast of radiation and a spike of heat from above coincided with a sudden roll.The cradle holding Fassin in the drop ship gave way, sending him shooting from the hold like a cannon ball.The colonel in her oerileithe esuit came whirling after him a moment later, quickly drawing level.He glimpsed the drop ship above, still rolling, then saw a violet ray appear suddenly to one side, slicing through the gas around them, searing his barely mended vision.The beam just missed the carrier craft, then clouds of yellow fog rolled quickly up between them and the drop ship and it was just him and the colonel, a tiny arrow shape and a spinning coin of dirty grey, hurtling down into the vast chaotic skies of Nasqueron.* * *   It is a given amongst those who care to study such matters that there is, within certain species, a distinct class of being so contemptuous and suspicious of their fellow creats that they court only hatred and fear, counting these the most sincere emotional reactions they may hope to excite, because they are unlikely to have been feigned.The Archimandrite Luseferous looked up at the head on the wall.The head stared straight across the cabin, eyes wide with pain and terror and madness.The assassin had died not long after theyd set out on their long journey towards Ulubis, the upper set of fangs finally penetrating his brain deeply enough to produce death.The Archimandrite had had the fellows eyelids slit open again when the medical people said death was likely within a few days; hed wanted to see the look on the mans face when he died.Luseferous had been asleep when death had finally come for the nameless assassin, but hed watched the recording many times.(All that happened was that the mans face stopped contorting, his eyes rolled backwards and then came slowly back down, slightly cross eyed, while the life signs read out accompanying the visuals registered first the heart stopping and then a few minutes later the brain flat lining.Luseferous would have preferred something more dramatic, but you couldnt have everything. )Hed had the fellows head removed and mounted near that of the rebel chief Stinausin, pretty much in the first heads eye line, so that was what Stinausin had to look at all day.The Archimandrite glanced up at the staring, nameless head.What do you think?He looked over the passage again, lips moving but not actually reading it aloud.He pursed his lips.I think I agree with whats being said, but I cant help feeling theres a hint of criticism implied at the same time.He shook his head, closed the ancient book and glanced at the cover.Never heard of him, he muttered.But at least, he reflected, this holier than thou intellectual had a name.It had come to annoy Luseferous rather a lot that he didnt have a name for the failed assassin.Yes, the fellow had failed, yes, he had paid dearly for his crime, and yes, he was dead and now reduced to a mere trophy.But somehow the fact that his name had never been revealed had begun to strike Luseferous as almost a kind of triumph for the assassin, as though successfully withholding this nugget of information meant that Luseferouss victory over the wretch would never quite be complete.He had already sent word back to Leseum to have the matter investigated more thoroughly.His chief personal secretary appeared behind the sheet of mirrored diamond forming the main inner door of the stateroom study.Yes?Sir, the Marshal Lascert, sir.Two minutes.Sir.He saw the Beyonder marshal in the primary stateroom of the Main Battle Craft Luseferous VII, his fleet flagship.(Luseferous thought terms like battleship and fleet carrier and so on sounded old fashioned and too common. )Hed had the craft remodelled to provide accommodation befitting his rank, but there had come a point where the naval architects had actually started to cry because letting what they called voids grow beyond a certain volume weakened the ship too much.The result was that the stateroom wasnt really as extensive or as intimidating as hed have liked, so hed had some mirrors installed and a few holo projectors which made it look bigger, though he always had the nagging feeling that people could see through the illusion.The style hed chosen was New Brutalist: lots of exposed faux concrete and rusty pipes.Hed taken a fancy to the name but had gone off the look almost immediately.He entered with only his private secretary going before him.Guards, courtiers, admin, army and naval people bowed as he strode past.Marshal.Archimandrite.The Beyonder marshal was a woman, dressed in light armour which looked like it had been polished up but still gave off an impression of practicality and scruffiness.She was tall, slim and proud looking, if somewhat flat chested for Luseferouss taste.Bald women always repelled him anyway.She gave a formal nod that was probably the very least acknowledgement of his status that anybody who didnt patently hate him and or was about to die had given him for several decades.He couldnt decide whether he found it insulting or refreshing.Two senior officers behind her were jajuejein, currently in their standard tumbleweed configuration, no part of their glittering plate armour higher than the marshals waist.He suspected that the woman had been selected because she was human, just because he was; almost all the Beyonder High Command were non human.He sat.It wasnt really a throne, but it was an impressive seat on a dais.The Beyonder marshal could stand.You wanted to talk, Marshal Lascert.I speak on behalf of the Transgress, the True Free and the BiAlliance.We have wanted to talk to you for some time, the marshal said smoothly.Deep voice for a woman.Thank you for agreeing to this meeting.A pleasure, Im sure.So.How goes your end of our little war?Last you heard, obviously.It goes well, as far as we know.The marshal smiled.Lights reflected on her bald scalp.I understand your own campaign has gone from victory to victory.He waved a hand.The opposition has been light, he said.Your main fleet should be at the outskirts of Ulubis system in, what?One more year?Something like that.This is somewhat later than we had all planned for.It is a big invasion fleet.It took time to put together, Luseferous said, trying to show that he resented her implied criticism while also giving the impression that what she thought was of no great importance to him.They were behind schedule, though.He had personally assured these  temporary  allies of his that he would be ready to invade nearly a full half year earlier than it now looked would be possible.He supposed it was his fault, if fault it was.He liked to keep his fleet together rather than let it split up according to speed and then re form as needed for the invasion proper.His admirals and generals insisted (though not too strongly if they knew what was good for them) that they didnt need all units of the fleet to be together at all times, but Luseferous preferred it.It seemed more cohesive, more impressive, just more tidy and pleasing somehow.It also meant that the Beyonders would shoulder rather more of the responsibility for preparing Ulubis system for invasion than they might have expected, so that the invasion fleets job would be all the easier and the Beyonders  hopefully much depleted  forces would be in a position of weakness relative to his own mass of ships.Still, Lascert said, we imagine your advance units may be attacking even now.Weve had some automated scout warning ships and highspeed drone attack craft there or on their way for a while now, Luseferous told her.Always best to be prepared for any eventuality.Some needed reprogramming but we believe they should be effective in beginning the softening up process.He smiled.He watched her react to the clear diamond teeth.I am a great believer in the usefulness of spreading a little panic, marshal.Better still, a lot of panic.After a long enough exposure, people will welcome any power that brings an end to uncertainty, even if they might have resisted it before.The marshal smiled too, though it looked like she was making an effort.Of course.And we thought now might be an appropriate moment to talk in more depth about what you see your strategy being once you reach Ulubis.I intend to take it, marshal.Indeed.Of course, it may be quite well defended.I expect it might.Thats why Ive brought such a big fleet with me.They were between systems, way out in the empty wilderness of near nothingness less than a year from Ulubis.The Beyonder fast cruiser and its two escort destroyers had rendezvoused with his own fleet only hours earlier, skid turning and matching velocities with a grace and rapidity that he could see his own naval people envied.Fine ships, indeed.Well, they had the ships and he had the systems; just another opportunity to trade, maybe.Now those three fast ships lay embedded in a fleet of over a thousand craft, even if they were rather plodding in comparison.May I be frank, Archimandrite?He gave her a good wide look at his deep red eyes.I expect no less.We are concerned at the possible level of civilian casualties if Ulubis is assaulted over aggressively.Now why would she say that?Luseferous thought to himself with a sort of inward chuckle.He looked at his private secretary, then at his generals and admirals.Marshal, he said reasonably, we are going to invade them.We are going to attack them.He smiled broadly, and could see his admirals and generals grinning along with him.I think aggressiveness is essential, yes?He could hear light laughter from one or two of his top brass.People thought that having people so in awe of you that they were frightened to tell you bad news and always laughed when you laughed (and so on) was a bad thing, and supposedly insulated you from what was really going on, but if you knew what you were doing, it didnt.You just had to adjust your perceptions.Sometimes everybody laughed, sometimes only a few, and sometimes who kept quiet and who made a noise told you a lot more than when you asked them to just speak out and tell you the truth.It was a sort of code, he supposed.He was just lucky to be naturally adept at it.Aggression and judgement are both required, Archimandrite, the marshal said.We know you to possess both, of course.She smiled.He did not smile back.We merely seek an assurance that your troops will act in a manner which will bring you further praise and greater fame.Praise?the Archimandrite said.I inspire terror, marshal.Thats my strategy.Ive found that to be the quickest and most effective way of ensuring that people learn what is good both for them and for me.For glory, then, Archimandrite.Be merciful for glory?The marshal thought about this for a moment.Ultimately, yes.I shall conquer them as I see fit, marshal.We are partners in this.You dont tell me what to do.I am not trying to, Archimandrite, the marshal said quickly.I accept what you must do, I am merely delivering a request regarding the manner in which it is done.And I have heard your request and I will pay it all due heed.This was a form of words Luseferous had heard somebody use once  he couldnt remember who or where  which, when hed thought about it, he thought was rather good, especially if you said it slightly pompously: slowly, gravely even, keeping a straight face so that the person you were talking to thought you were taking them seriously and might even hope that you would do as they had asked rather than  at best  ignore them completely.At worst  as far as they were concerned  youd do the opposite of whatever they asked, just to spite them, precisely to prove you wouldnt be pushed around though that got tricky; then people might try to make you do one thing by pretending to favour another, and even without that complication you were still altering your behaviour because of something they had said, which was giving them a sort of power over you, when the whole point of everything the Archimandrite was doing was so that nobody could say they had any power over him.Power was everything.Money was nothing without it.Even happiness was a distraction, a ghost, a hostage.What was happiness?Something people could take away from you.Happiness too often involved other people.It meant giving them power over you, giving them a hold on you that they could exercise whenever they wanted, taking away whatever it was that had made you happy.Luseferous had known happiness and hed had it taken away.His father, the only man hed ever admired  even while hating the old bastard  had got rid of Luseferouss mother when she became old and less attractive, replacing her, when Luseferous was barely into his teens, with a succession of young, erotically desirable but soulless, uncaring, selfish young women, women hed wanted for himself but despised at the same time.His mother was sent away.He never saw her again.His father had been an Omnocrat for the Mercatoria, in the industrial complexes of the Leseum Systems.Hed started out at the bottom, as a Peculan (cynically, the very name implied that the office bearer would need to be corrupt to make any sort of decent living, so incurring a history of criminality that could always be dredged up against them if they ever stepped out of line later).Hed become an Ovate, worked his way through the many gradations of that estate, then ascended to the office of Diegesian, in charge of a district of a city, then a small industrial city, then a medium sized city, then a large city, then a continental capital.He became an Apparitor when his immediate superior died in the arms of a shared lover.That lover did very well for a while  his consort, in effect  then grew demanding and met an untimely end too.His father had never told him if hed had her killed.Equally, hed never told his father that the woman had lately become his lover, too.From Apparitor his father rose to Peregal, in charge of first an orbiting fab\hab cluster, then a continent, then a sizeable moon, with all the trappings of power and wealth and glamour such a post presented in a thriving, connected set of systems such as Leseum.At this point, for the first time in his life, his father had appeared finally to appreciate the position hed reached.Hed seemed to relax and start enjoying life.It ended there.Finally setting himself up for the next jump, to Hierchon, his father, who had amassed a great fortune dispensing charters and contracts to the merchants and manufacturers of the many systems, took pity on a favoured Apparitor who was somewhat down on his luck, cut him in on a deal and a kickback he didnt really need to and found himself denounced, tried and beheaded for gross corruption within a month.The same young Apparitor then took his position.Luseferous, convinced from early on that he could never compete with his father in his own sphere, and anyway always intrigued by the nature of religion and faith, had joined the Cessoria a few years earlier.Hed been a Piteer, a junior priest, at the time of his fathers trial.They had made him one of his fathers confessors, and hed accompanied him to the execution ring.His father had been brave at first, then hed broken.Hed started crying, begging, promising anything (but only all the things hed already lost).He clutched at Luseferouss robes, howling and beseeching, burying his face.Luseferous knew they were watching him, that this moment was important for his future.He pushed his father away.His rise through the Cessoria was swift.He would never be as powerful as his father, but he was clever and capable and respected and on an upward course within an important but not too dangerous part of one of the greatest meta civilisations the galaxy had seen.He might have been content with that, and never put himself in a position of weakness the way his father had.Then the Disconnect happened.A swathe of portal destruc  tion had swung across the million star volume all around Leseum back in the time of the Arteria Collapse, leaving only the bunched Leseum systems themselves connected inside a vast volume of backwardness.The system of Leseum9 had been important, seemed vital and felt unthreatened until their own disconnect came millennia later, courtesy of some vast bicker within the ongoing chaos of the Scatter Wars, an essentially meaningless difference of opinion between three pretending sides which until then practically nobody had heard of.By the time it was all over, nobody would hear of those sides again, save as history.The damage was done, though; the portal near Leseum9 had been destroyed and an enormous volume around it had been cut off from the rest of the civilised galaxy.Everything changed then, including what you had to do to retain power, and who might contest for absolute power.His father, nevertheless, had taught Luseferous everything, one way or another, and one of the most important things was this: there was no plateau.In life, you were either on your way up or on your way down, and it was always better to be on your way up, especially as the only reliable way to keep going up was to use other people as stepping stones, as platforms, as scaffolding.The old saying about being nice to people on the way up so that theyd be nice to you when you were on your way back down was perfectly true, but it was a defeatists saying, a losers truism.Better to keep going up for ever, never to rest, never to relax, never to have to descend.The thought of what might happen to you at the hands of those youd already offended, exploited and wronged on the way up  those that still lived  was just another incentive for the serious player never even to think about easing off the pace, let alone starting to fall back.The dedicated competitor would keep presenting himself with new challenges to take on and conquer, he would seek out new levels to ascend to, he would always look for new horizons to head towards.Treat life like the game it was.This might be the truth behind the Truth, the religion Luseferous had been raised within as an obedient member of the Mercatoria: that nothing you did or seemed to do really mattered, because it was all  or might be all  a game, a simulation.It was all, in the end, just pretend.Even this Starveling cult he was titular head of was just something hed made up because it sounded good.A variation of the Truth with added self denial every now and again, the better to contemplate the gullibility of people.People would swallow anything, just anything at all.Apparently some people found this dismaying.He thought it was a gift, the most wonderful opportunity to take advantage of the weak minded.So you seemed cruel.So people died and suffered and grew up hating you.So what?There was at least a chance that none of it was real.And if it was all real, well, then life was struggle.It always had been and it always would be.You recognised this and lived, or fell for the lie that progress and society had made struggle unnecessary, and just existed, were exploited, became prey, mere fodder.He wondered to what extent even the supposedly feral and lawless Beyonders understood this basic truth.They let women rise to the pinnacle of their military command structure; that didnt bode particularly well.And the marshal didnt seem to have realised that when hed said hed heard her request and would pay it all due heed, it meant nothing.Well, thank you, Archimandrite, she said.Still, he smiled.You will stay?We shall have a banquet in your honour.We have had so little to celebrate out here, between the stars.An honour indeed, Archimandrite.The marshal gave that little head nod again.And we shall try to pick each others brains over dinner, he thought.My, what highbrow fun.Give me a planet to plunder any day.* * *   Do you have any idea where we are?the colonel signalled, using a spot laser.They reckoned this was their most secure form of comms.Zone Zero, the equatorial, Fassin sent.Somewhere ahead of the latest big storm, about ten or twenty kilo klicks behind the Ear Festoon.Im checking the latest update they loaded before the drop.They were floating in a slow eddy around a gentle ammonia upwell the diameter of a small planet, about two hundred klicks down from the cloud tops.The temperature outside was rela tively balmy by human standards.There were levels, places in almost all gas giants where a human could, in theory, exist exposed to the elements without any protective clothing at all.Of course they would probably need to be prone and lying in a tub of shock gel or something similar because weighing six times what their skeleton was used to coping with would make standing up or moving around problematic, their lungs would have to be full of gillfluid or the like, to let them breathe within a mix of gases which included oxygen only as a trace element, and also to let their ribs and chest muscles work under the pressure of that gravitational vice, plus they wouldnt want to be exposed to a charged particle shower, but all the same: by gas giant great outdoors standards, this was about as good as it humanly got.Colonel Hatherence found it a bit hot, but then as an oerileithe she would be more at home closer to the cloud tops.She had already loudly pronounced her esuit undamaged and capable of protecting her anywhere from space vacuum down to Nasquerons ten kilo klick level, where the pressure would be a million times what it was here and the temperature somewhat more than half what it was on the surface of Ulubis star.Fassin chose not to join in a mines better than yours competition; his own gascraft was also space capable in an emergency but untested at those depths.Hed tried contacting Apsile in the drop ship but had come up with static.The passive positioning grid cast by the equatorial satellites was functioning but both scale degraded and patchy, indicating there were some satellites gone or not working.Knowing where you were in Nasqueron or any gas giant was important, but still less than half the story.There was a solid rocky core to the planet, a spherical mass of about ten Earth sized planets buried under seventy thousand vertical kilometres of hydrogen, helium and ice, and there were purists who would call the transition region between that stony kernel and the high temperature, high pressure water ice above it the planets surface.But you had to be a real nit picker even to pretend to take that definition seriously.Beyond the water ice  technically ice because it was effectively clamped solid by the colossal pressure, but at over twenty thousand degrees, confusingly hot for the human image of what ice was supposed to be like  came over forty thousand vertical kilometres of metallic hydrogen, then a deep transition layer to the ten kilo klick layer of molecular hydrogen which, if you were of an especially imaginative turn of mind, you might term a sea.Above that, in the relatively thin  at a mere few thousand kilometres  but still vastly complicated layers reaching up towards space, were the regions where the Dwellers lived, in the contra rotating belts and zones of rapidly spinning gases which  dotted with storms great and small, spattered with eddies, embellished with festoons, bars, rods, streaks, veils, columns, clumps, hollows, whirls, vortices, plume heads, shear fronts and subduction flurries  girdled the planet.Where the Dwellers lived, where everything happened, there was no solid surface, and no features at all which lasted more than a few thousand years save for the bands of gas forever charging past each other, great spinning wheels of atmosphere whirling like the barely meshed cogs in some demented gearbox a hundred and fifty thousand kilometres across.The convention was that the equatorial satellites followed the averaged out progress of the broad equatorial zone, establishing a sort of stationary parameter set from which everything else could be worked out relatively.But it was still confusing.Nothing was fixed.The zones and belts were relatively stable, but they shot past each other at combined speeds of what humans were used to thinking of as the speed of sound, and the margins between them changed all the time, torn by furiously curling eddies writhing this way and that, or thrown out, compressed and disturbed by giant storms like the Great Red Spot of the Solar Systems Jupiter, riding between a zone travelling one way and a belt going the other like a vast squashed whirlpool caught in some mad clash of violently opposed currents, developing, raging and slowly dissipating over the centuries that humanity had been able to watch it.In a gas giant, everything either evolved, revolved or just plain came and went, and the whole human mindset of surfaces, territory, land, sea and air was thrown into confusion.Add the effects of a vastly powerful magnetic field, swathes of intense radiation and the sheer scale of the environment  you could drop the whole of a planet the size of Earth or Sepekte into a decent sized gas giant storm  and the human brain was left with a lot to cope with.And all this before one took into account the  to be generous  playful attitude which the Dwellers themselves so often exhibited to general planetary orientation and the help, or otherwise, conventionally seen as being fit and proper to be extended to directionally challenged alien visitors.I thought wed be in the midst of them, the colonel sent.Dwellers?Fassin asked, studying the complex schematic of who and what might be where at the moment.Yes, I imagined we would find ourselves in one of their cities.They both looked around at the vast haze of slowly swirling gas, extending  depending on which frequency or sense one chose to experience it in  a few metres or a few hundred kilometres away on every side.It felt very still, even though they were part of the equatorial zone and so being spun around the planet at over a hundred metres a second, while swirling slowly around the upwelling and rising gradually with it too.Fassin felt himself smiling in his wrapping of shock gel.Well, theres a lot of Dwellers, but its a big planet.It seemed odd to be explaining this to a creature whose kind had evolved in planets like this and who surely ought to be familiar with the scale of a gas giant, but then oerileithe, in Fassins admittedly limited experience of them, often did display a kind of half resentful awe towards Dwellers, entirely consistent with a belief that the instant you dropped beneath the cloud tops youd find yourself surrounded by massed ranks of magisterial Dwellers and their astoundingly awesome structures (a misapprehension it was hard to imagine any Dweller even considering correcting).The oerileithe were an ancient people by human standards and by those of the vast majority of species in the developed galaxy, but  with a civilisation going back about eight hundred thousand years  they were mere mayflies by Dweller standards.A thought occurred to Fassin.You ever been in a Dweller planet before, colonel?Indeed not.A privilege denied until now.Hatherence made a show of looking about.Not unlike home, really.Another thought occurred.You did receive clearance?Didnt you, colonel?Clearance, Seer Taak?To come down.To enter Nasq.Ah, the colonel sent.Not as such, I do confess.It was thought that I would be remote delving with you and your colleagues, from the Shared Facility on the Third Fury moon.Braam Ganscerel himself took the time to assure me of this personally.No objection was raised regarding such a presence.I believe that permission was in the process of being sought for me to accompany you physically into the atmosphere if that became necessary  as indeed it now has  however, the last that I heard in that regard indicated that the relevant clearances had yet to materialise.Why?Do you envisage there being a problem?Oh, shit.The Dwellers, Fassin told her,  can be pernickety about that sort of thing.Pernickety, he thought.They were liable to declare the colonel an honorary child, give her a half hour start and set off to hunt her.They take their privacy quite seri ously.Unauthorised entries are severely discouraged.Well, Im aware of that.You are?Good.I shall throw myself upon their mercy.Right.I see.You are either quite brave and possessed of a decent sense of humour, Fassin thought, or you really should have done more homework.So, Seer Fassin Taak, in which direction ought we to proceed?Should be a CloudTunnel about four hundred klicks that way, Fassin sent, turning the gascraft to point more or less south and slightly down.Unless its moved, obviously.Shall we?the colonel said, drifting in that direction.Going to ping one of our sats, let them know were alive,  Fassin told her.This is wise?Was it wise?Fassin wondered.There had been some sort of attack on the Seer infrastructure around Nasqueron, but that didnt mean the whole near planet environment had been taken over.On the other hand   How fast can that esuit go?he asked the colonel.At this density, about four hundred metres per second.About half that, on sustained cruise.Fassins arrowcraft could just about keep pace with that.Disappointing.He was still hoping to give the colonel the slip at some point.It looked like he wasnt going to be able to just outrun her.Ping sent, he told Hatherence.Lets go.They went, quickly.Theyd got about a hundred metres away when a flash of violet light ripped the cloud apart behind them and a stark, short lived beam cluster splayed through the volume of gas theyd been floating within a few seconds earlier.Further beams radiated out from the initial target point, pulsing through the atmosphere in slowly spreading semi random stabs.One flicked into existence about fifty metres from them, booming and crackling.All the rest were much further away and after a minute or so they ceased altogether.Somebody would seem to be ill disposed towards you, Seer Taak, the colonel sent as they flew through the gas.So it would appear.The flash and EMP came a couple of minutes after that.A low, rumbling concussion caught up with them some time later.Was that a nuke?Fassin sent.His instruments seemed to leave no other interpretation, but he still found it hard to believe.I am unaware of any phenomenon able to mimic one so convincingly.Fucking hell.I float corrected.Somebody would seem to be extremely ill disposed towards you, Seer Taak.The Dwellers are not going to be happy, he told Hatherence.Only theyre allowed to let off nukes in the atmosphere, he explained.And it isnt even fireworks season.They found the CloudTunnel about where Fassin had thought it ought to be, only a hundred kilometres out laterally and two kilometres further down: bang on by Nasqueron standards.The CloudTunnel was a bundle of a dozen or so carbon carbon tubes like some vast, barely braided cable cluster floating in the midst of an unending cloudscape of gently billowing yellow, orange and ochre.The CloudTunnels two main tubes were about sixty metres in diameter, the smallest  basically comms and telemetry wave guides  less than half a metre.The whole cluster had looked thread thin when theyd first caught sight of it, tens of kilometres away, but up close it looked like a hawser fit to tether a moon.A great, deep rushing sound rumbled from inside the two main pipes.What now?the colonel sent.We see if my vicarious kudos credit is still good.Fassin used one of the arrowcrafts manipulators to prod one of the wave guides, working the filaments through the tubes protective sheath without breaking it.A hair thin wire extended into the matrix of light filling the narrow tube.Information streamed from the far end of the wire, into the gascrafts biomind, its transitional systems and then into Fassins head, forming a coded chaos of babbling sound, wildly scintillating visuals and other confused sensory experiences.The interruption in the light streams had already been noticed and allowed for.A pulse of information aimed right at the filament sent an identity request and inquired whether assistance was required, otherwise stop interfering with a public information highway.A human, Fassin Taak, privileged to be Slow Seer at the court of the Nasqueron Dwellers, he sent.Id like some assis tance in the shape of transport at the given location, bound for Hauskip City.He was told to wait.Fassin Taak, Out Bander, Stranger, Alien, Seer, Human!And whats this?This is Colonel Hatherence of the Mercatorial Military Religious Order the Shrievalty Ocula, an oerileithe.Good day, Dweller Ysul, Hatherence said.They had switched to using ordinary sound speech.A little dweller!How fascinating!Not a child, then?Ysul, a sizeable mid adult a good nine metres or so in diameter, rolled through the gas and, extending one long spindle arm, clunked a fist bunch (bink bink bink!)on the esuit of the Colonel.Hellooo in there!Ysul said.Hatherences discus of esuit leaned to one side under the rain of not so gentle blows.Pleased to meet you, she replied tersely.Not a child, Fassin confirmed.They were in a giant bowl like room, roofed with slate diamond micrometres thin, in a Thickeneers Club in Hauskip City.Hauskip lay within the equatorial zone of Nasqueron, one of the hundred thousand or so major conurbations in that particular atmospheric band.Seen from the right angle in a sympa thetic light, it looked a lot like the internal workings of an ancient mechanical clock, multiplied and magnified several thousand times.From far enough away, or just seen in a schematic, it resembled millions of toothed looking wheels caught up in amongst each other, with larger sets of wheels interconnecting with them through hubs and spines and spindles, themselves linking up with still greater sets of wheels.The whole mighty, slowly gyrating and spinning assemblage, easily a couple of hundred kilometres in diameter, floated within a thick soup of gas a hundred kilometres beneath the cloud tops.The city was the hub for several CloudTunnel lines.Once an empty car had made its way to the access hatch nearest to where Fassin and Hatherence pitched up alongside the CloudTunnel, it had taken two changes of line, riding in the same car, for Fassin and the colonel to get there through the network of partially evacuated, high speed transit tubes.The whole journey had taken one of Nasquerons short day night cycles.They had each slept for most of the time, though just before Fassin had dozed off, the colonel had said, We go on.You agree, major?We continue our mission.Until we are ordered to cease.Iagree, he said.We go on.The TunnelCar had docked, sphinctered its way through a TunnelBud wall in Hauskips Central Station and sped through the gelatinous atmosphere straight to the equatorial Eighth Progression Thickeneers Club, where Ysul, Fassins long time guide mentor guard had been attending a party to celebrate the Completion and Expulsion Ceremony of one of the clubs members.Dwellers started out looking like anorexic manta rays  this was in their brief, occasionally hunted childhood phase  then grew, fattened, split most of the way down the middle (adolescence, kind of), shifted from a horizontal to a vertical axis and ended up, as adults, basically, resembling something like a pair of large, webbed, fringed cartwheels connected by a short, thick axle with particularly bulbous outer hubs onto each of which had been fastened a giant spider crab.Part of the transition from recent  to mid adulthood involved a period called Thickening, when the slim and flimsy discs of youth became the stout and sturdy wheels of later life, and it was customary for Dwellers to join a club of their approximate contemporaries while this was taking place.There was no specific reason for Dwellers to band together at this point in their lives, they just in general enjoyed joining clubs, sodalities, orders, leagues, parties, societies, associations, fellowships, fraternities, groups, guilds, unions, fractionals, dispensationals and recreationalities, while always, of course, leaving open the possibility of taking part in ad hoc non ceremonial serendipitous one time gatherings as well.The social calendar was crowded.Ysul had invited them to this private book crystal lined library room in his Thickeneers Club rather than to his home so that, as he explained, if they were too boring or in too great a hurry, he could get back without an over great delay to his chums taking part in the ceremonial dinner and spree in the banqueting hall below.So, Fassin, good to see you!Ysul said.Why have you brought this little dweller with you?Is she food?No, of course not.She is a colleague.Of course!Though there are no oerileithe Seers.She is not a Seer.Then not a colleague?She has been sent to escort me, by the Mercatorial Military Religious Order the Shrievalty Ocula.I see.Ysul, dressed in his best smart but casual finery, all brightly coloured fringes and lacily ornate ruffs, rocked back, rotating slightly, then came forward again.No, I dont!What am I saying?What is this Ocula?Well  It took a while to tell.After about a quarter of an hour  this all, thankfully, in real time, with no slow down factor  Fassin thought hed pretty much briefed Ysul as well and as completely as he could without giving too much away.The colonel had contributed now and again, not that Ysul seemed to have taken any notice of her.Ysul was about fifteen thousand years old, a full adult who was perhaps another one or two millennia away from becoming a traav, the first stage of Prime hood.At nine metres vertical diameter (not including his semi formal dinner clothes, whose impressive body ruff added another metre), he was about as large as a Dweller ever got.His double disc was nearly five metres across, the modestly clothed central axle barely visible as a separate entity, more of an unexpected thinning between the two great wheels.Dwellers shrank very slightly as they aged after mid adulthood and slowly lost both hub and fringe limbs until, by the time they were in their billions, they were often nearly limb disabled.Even then they could still get about, as a rule.Their motive force came from a system of vanes extending from the inner and outer surfaces of their two main discs.These extended to beat  sometimes twisting to add extra impetus or to steer  and lay flat on the backstroke, so that a moving Dweller seemed to roll through the atmosphere.This was called roting.Very old Dwellers often lost the use of  or just lost  the vanes on the outside of their discs, but usually retained those on the inside so that no matter how decrepit they might get, they could still wheel themselves around.It boils down, Ysul said at the end, to the fact that you are looking for the choal Valseir, to resume subject specific studies in a library within his control.Pretty much, Fassin agreed.I see.Ysul, you have always been a great help to me.Can you help me in this?Problem, Ysul said.Problem?Fassin asked.Valseir is dead and his library has been consigned to the depths, or split up, possibly at random, amongst his peers, allies, families, co specialists, enemies or passers by.Probably all of the above.Dead?Fassin said.He let horror show on the signalling carapace of the gascraft; a quite specific whorl pattern which indicated being intellectually and emotionally appalled at the demise of a Dweller friend\acquaintance not least because they had died in the course of pursuing a line of inquiry that one was oneself deeply fascinated by.But he was only a choal!He was billions of years from dying!Valseir had been about a million and a half years old and on the brink of passing from the Cuspian level to that of Sage.Choal was the last phase of being a Cuspian.The average age of progressing from Cuspian choal to Sage child was over two million years but Valseir had been judged by his elders and allegedly betters as being ready even at such a modest count of time.He was, or had been, a one and a half million year old prodigy.He had also, last time Fassin had seen him, seemed strong, vigorous and full of life.Agreed, he spent most of his life with his rotary snout stuck in a library and didnt get out much, but still Fassin could not believe he was dead.The Dwellers didnt even have any diseases he could have died of.How could he be dead?Yachting accident, if I recall, Ysul said.Do I?Fassin sensed the Dweller radioing an inforequest to the patch walls of the library room.Yes, I do!Yes, a yachting accident.His StormJammer got caught in a particularly vicious eddy and it came apart on him.Skewered with a main beam or a yard arm or something.On a brighter note, they salvaged most of the yacht before it descended to the Depths.He was a very keen sailor.Terribly competitive..When?Fassin asked.I heard nothing.Not long ago, Ysul said.Couple of centuries at the most.There was nothing on the news nets.Really?Ah!Wait.(Another radioed inforequest. )Yes.I understand he left instructions that in the event of his death it was to be regarded as a private matter.Ysul flexed his hub mounted spindle arms on either side.All of them.Right out.Quite understand!Done the same myself.Is there any record of what happened to his library?Fassin asked.Ysul rocked back again, a pair of giant conical wheels rotating slowly away, then pitching forward once more.He hung in mid gas and said, Dyou know what?What?No, there isnt!Is that not strange?We I would really like to look into this matter further, Ysul.Can you help us in this?I most certainly ah, talking about news nets, there is something about an unauthorised fusion explosion not far from the point you accessed the CloudTunnel from.Anything to do with you?Oh, shit, Fassin thought, again.Yes.It would appear that somebody is trying to kill me.Or possibly the colonel here.He waved at Hatherences esuit, still floating next to him.She had been silent for some time.Fassin was not certain this was a good sign.I see, Ysul said.And talking about the good colonel, I am struggling to discover her authorisation.For being here at all, I mean.Well, Fassin said, we were forced to take refuge in Nasqueron, some time before we imagined it would be necessary, due to unprovoked hostile action.The colonels permissions were being sought some time before we left but had not yet come through when we had to make our emergency entry.The colonel is, technically, here without explicit permission, and therefore throws herself upon your mercy as a shipwreckee, a wartime asylumee and a fellow gas giant dweller in need of shelter.Fassin turned and looked at the colonel, who shifted about her vertical axis to return his gascraft directed gaze.She claims sanctuary, he finished.Provisionally given, of course, Ysul said.Though the precise meaning of unprovoked might be challenged in a wider context, and the exact definition of shipwreckee, equally, could well be open to dispute if one wished to be picky.That aside, though, do I understand there is some sort of dispute in progress, out amongst you people?You understand correctly, Fassin told the Dweller.Oh, not another one of your wars, please!Ysul protested, with a rolling back of his whole body which was actually relatively easy for a human to interpret, correctly, as an equivalent of rolling ones eyes.(Though, to be fair, there was quite a lot of Dweller gestures with this translation. )Well, pretty much, yes, Fassin told him.Your passion for doing each other harm never ceases to amaze, delight and horrify!Im told there is to be a Formal War between Zone 2 and Belt C, Fassin said.I too am told that!Ysul said brightly.Do you really think it will happen?Im not optimistic, frankly.Some appallingly good negotiators have been drafted in, I understand Ah.Your hull carapace, doing the job of standing in, feebly, for the body you so sadly lack, bears marks upon it which I take to mean you were being sarcastic earlier.Never mind, Ysul.Right then, shant.Now then: Valseir.There is a point of congruency  There is?Yes!With what?Between what and what?His demise and this war weve been promised!Really?Yes!His old study  it is in the current zone of disputation, I believe.But if its already been broken up Fassin began.Oh, there are bound to be back ups, and Im not even sure the old fellow has been finally put to rest.After two hundred years?Come now, Fassin, there were matters of probate.And its in the war zone?Very likely, yes!Isnt it exciting?I think we ought to go there immediately!Ysul waved all his limbs at once.Lets form an expedition!We shall go together.He looked at Hatherence.You can even bring your little friend.I have been considering whether to attempt to communicate with your Shared Facility, via your satellites or directly, the colonel told him.I wouldnt, Fassin sent.But if you decide you must, tell me before you try.I want to be well out of the volume.You think the same sort of attack directed against us following your ping might be directed against us here?Probably not here, in a Dweller city.But then, why risk it?We dont know that whoevers been shooting at us quite understands what theyd be letting themselves in for, so they might just waste us and have to deal with the consequences later.We wont be around to jeer.We need to find out what is going on, Major Taak, Hatherence informed him.I know, and Im going to send a request for information up to a sat from a remote site as soon as Ive checked out whats been going on via the local nets.The colonel floated over to look at the enormous though ancient and highly directional flat screen which Fassin was using in his attempt to find out what had been happening.They were in Ysuls home, a ramshackle wheel house in a whole vast district of equally shabby looking wheel houses hanging on skinny spindles underneath the citys median level like a frozen image of an entire junkyards worth of exploded gearboxes.Ysul had escorted them back from his club in a state of some excitement.Then hed left them alone, taken his servant Sholish and gone off in search of a decent tailor  his usual tailor had most inconveniently taken it into his mind to change trades and become a Dreadnought rating; probably trying to get in on the ground floor of this upcoming war.What have you found?the colonel asked, watching the flat screen fill with an image of the Third Fury moon.Hmm.The moon appears almost undamaged.This is an old recording, Fassin explained.Im trying to find an updated one.Any mention of the hostilities?Not very much, Fassin told her, using a manipulator to work the massive, stiff controls of the old screen.Theres been a mention on a minority radio news service, but thats it.It is regarded as news, though?This is encouraging, I think?Well, dont get too excited, Fassin sent.We are talking about a station some amateurs run for the few people like themselves who are actually interested in things happening in the rest of the system; maybe a few thousand Dwellers out of a planetary population of five or ten billion.The number of Dwellers in Nasqueron is really that uncer tain?Oh, Ive seen estimates as low as two billion, as high as two hundred, even three.I encountered this degree of uncertainty in my research, Hatherence said as Fassin switched manually between channels, data sets and image trails.I recall thinking it must be a mistake.How can one be two base ten orders of magnitude out?Cant one just ask the Dwellers?Dont they know themselves how many they are?You can certainly ask, Fassin agreed.He put some humour into his signal.An old tutor of mine used to say of questions like this that the answers will prove far more illuminating regarding Dweller psychology than they will concerning their actual subject.They lie to you or they dont know themselves?That is a good question too.They must have an idea, the Colonel protested.A society has to know how many people it contains, otherwise how would it plan infrastructure and so on?Fassin felt himself smiling.Thats how it would work in pretty much any other society, he agreed.There are those who would assert that Dwellers are not in fact civilised, the colonel said thoughtfully,  that they could scarcely be said to possess a society in any single planet, and on a galactic scale cannot be said to constitute a civilisation at all.They exist rather in a state of highly developed barbarism.Im familiar with the arguments, Fassin told her.Would you agree?No.This is a society.We are in a city.And even just in the one planet, this is a civilisation.I know the definitions will have changed over the years and you might take a different view from me, but in the history of my planet wed refer to a civilisation based around a single river system or on a small island.I forget how small scale one has to think when dealing with planets with solid surface living environments, the colonel said, apparently without meaning to insult.But even so, the defi nition of a civilisation has to move on when one ascends to the galactic stage, and the Dwellers, taken as a whole, might seem deficient.I think it comes down to ones own definition of the terms, Fassin said.Hold on; this looks promising.He swung back from a mosaic of sub screens to a single moving image.Third Fury again, though this time looking hazier, less defined, and shot from some distance away.The shallow domes of the Shared Facility were obvious if not clear, down near one tipped edge of the little moonlet.A flash on the surface away to one side, and a semi spherical cloud of debris, spreading.A glowing crater left where the flash had come from.This looks like yesterday, Hatherence said.Does, doesnt it?Fassin agreed.Looks like it was taken from high up on Belt A or the south of Zone 2.Just some amateur pointing a camera.Fassin found how to spin the stored recording back and then forward, then discovered how to zoom in.And thats us.They watched a cerise spot appear on a glittering blister near the edge of the Shared Facility, and could just make out the grainily defined debris of the hangar dome blowing outward in front of a sudden haze of quickly dissipating mist.A tiny dark grey dot rose from the shattered dome and crawled away: the drop ship, making its desperate dive for the planet.Fassin spun the recording forward.The moons position altered quickly, flying away across the dark sky as Third Fury continued on its orbit and whoever was recording the images was whirled away in the opposite direction by the twenty thousand kilometre wide jet stream beneath them.Definitely Band A, Fassin said.A brilliant white flash washed out the whole screen.It faded, and a crater kilometres across was left.Debris spread everywhere like a flowers seed head, just ready to shed, caught in a sudden hurricane.The interior of the crater was white, yellow, orange, red.The debris continued to spread.It looked like most of it would stay in more or less the same orbit as Third Fury itself.They both watched in silence.The moon had changed shape.It wobbled, seemed to partially collapse in on itself, slowly, plastically resuming a spherical form after losing so much of its earlier mass.Yellow cloud tops came up in a near flat line to meet it and the small glowing globe spun under the horizon.Fassin let the recording play out and start to loop.He stopped it.The screen froze on the recordings first image of Third Fury, almost overhead, just after the first impact.That did not look like a survivable event, the colonel sent.Her sent voice sounded quiet.I think youre right.I am very sorry.How many people would have been in the Shared Facility base?A couple of hundred.I saw no sign of your Master Technicians craft, or of the attacks on us once we quit the drop ship.Fassin compared the recordings time code with the gascrafts own event list.Those happened after what we saw here, he told the colonel.Over the horizon from where this recording was taken, anyway.So much for back up or reinforcements.The colonel turned towards him.We still go on, though, yes?Yes.So, now what, Fassin Taak?We need to talk to some people.So you want to communicate with your own kind?Ysul asked.Via a relay at a remote site, Fassin said.Why havent you done so already?I wanted to get your permission.You dont need my permission.You just find a remote dish and send away.I suspect any vicarious effect on my kudos level will be too small to measure.They were in an antechamber of the citys Administrator.The antechamber was a sizeable room furnished with wall hangings made from ancient CloudHugger hides, all yellow red and whorled.A few sported the holes where the creatures had been punctured.One curved section of wall was a giant window, looking out over the vast floating scape of wheels that was Hauskip.Evening was starting to descend and lights were coming on throughout the city.Ysul floated over to the window and caused it to hinge down by the unsubtle tactic of bumping into it reasonably hard.He then floated out over the impromptu bow of balcony so produced, muttering something about liking the view and maybe moving his own house up here.A breeze blew in, ruffling the old CloudHugger hides as though their long dead occupants were still somehow fleeing from their hunters.Colonel Hatherence leaned over towards Fassin.This kudos thing, then, she sent.It is really how they calculate their worth?Im afraid so.So its the truth!I thought it was a joke.Distinguishing between the two is not a Dweller strong point.Ysul wandered back, failing to shut the window.His vanes made a quiet burring noise as he roted through the gas towards them.Give me the message, he said.Ill forward it.Via an out of the way transceiver?Fassin asked.Of course!Well, just send to Sept Bantrabal, letting them know Im all right and asking whether theyre okay at their end.I imagine they already know what happened to the Third Fury moon.You might ask them whether anything has been heard of Master Technician Apsile and the drop ship which escaped the moons assault, and what happened to the ships supposed to be protecting Third Fury.Ahem, the colonel said.They both looked at her.Is this wise?she asked.You mean should I pretend to be dead?Fassin said.Yes.That did occur to me.But there are people Id like to know Im alive.He thought of that glimpse of a flash which might have been something hitting glantine while Third Fury was being bombarded.And Id like to know my friends and family are all right.Of course, the colonel said.However, I wonder if it might be more sensible for me to communicate with my superiors first.We might ask Dweller Ysul here to let me use this remote relay.Once a more secure link had been established, perhaps via one of the warships, which I assume are still somewhere around the planet, a message might be sent to your Sept to let them know you are well.None of which need take long.While Hatherence had been speaking, Ysul had floated right up to her, seemingly intent on peering through the front plate of her esuit, which was in fact completely opaque, and indeed armoured.Eventually he was within a centimetre of her, towering above the oerileithe.The colonel did not retreat.One of Ysuls rim limbs tapped  more delicately this time  on the colonels esuit casing.Would you mind not doing that, sir?she said frostily.Why are you still inside that thing, little dweller?Ysul asked.Because I am evolved for higher, colder levels with a different gas mix and pressure gradient, Dweller Ysul.I see.Ysul drew back.And you have a very strange accent and way with grammar.I swear this human speaks better than you do.What were you saying again?I was asking you kindly to refrain from making physical contact with my esuit.No, before that..I was suggesting I make contact with my superiors.Military superiors?Yes.Ysul turned to Fassin.That sounds more interesting than your plan, Fassin.Ysul, two hundred of my people died yesterday.If not more.Id like  Yes yes yes, but  I might have to signal glantine direct, if no satellites are left, Hatherence was saying, as a tall door swung up in one wall and a Dweller in ceremonial clothes poked its rim out.Ill see you now, said the City Administrator.The Administrators office was huge, the size of a small stadium.It was ringed with holo screen carrels.Fassin counted a hundred or so of the study stations, though only a few were occupied by Dwellers, mostly fairly young.There were no windows but the ceiling was diamond leaf, with most of the sections slid round to leave the place open to the rapidly darkening sky.Floatlamps bobbed, casting a soft yellow light over them as they followed the Administrator to her sunken audience area in the centre of the giant room.You are pregnant!Ysul exclaimed.How delightful!So people keep telling me, the Administrator said sourly.Dwellers were, for want of a better term, male for over ninety nine per cent of their lives, only changing to the female form to become pregnant and give birth.Becoming female and giving birth was regarded as a social duty; the fact that the obligation was more honoured than not made it unique in Dweller mores.It contributed mightily to ones kudos tally and anyway had a sort of sentimental attraction for all but the most determinedly misanthropic members of the species (statistically, about forty three per cent).Still, it was undeniably a burden, and very few Dwellers went through the experience without complaining mightily about it.I myself have thought of becoming female, oh, several times!Ysul said.Well, its overrated, the City Administrator told him.And particularly burdensome when one had an invitation to the forthcoming war that one is now apparently morally obliged to turn down.Please; take a dent.They floated to a series of hollows in the audience area and rested gently within them.Why, I too hope to be going to the war!Ysul said brightly.Well, somewhere very near it, at least.I have only just now returned from my tailors after being measured for the most lately fashionable conflict attire.Oh, really?the Administrator said.Whos your tailor?Mine just left for the war.Not Fuerliote?Ysul exclaimed.The same!He was mine also!Just the best.Absolutely.No, I had to go to Deystelmin.Is he any good?Weeeelll.Ysul waggled his whole double discus.One lives in hope.Good mirror side manner, as it were, but will it translate into a flattering cut?Thats the question one has to ask oneself.I know, agreed the Administrator.And off to become a junior officer on a Dreadnought!Not even that!A rating!No!Yes!Very lowly, for someone so distinguished!I know, but a smart move.Getting in as a rating before the recruitment window even properly opens makes sense.The smoking uniform effect.Ah!Of course!Fassin tried making a throat clearing noise in the midst of all this, but to no effect.The smoking uniform effect?The colonel light whispered to him.Dead mens shoes, Fassin explained.They only promote from within once hostilities have begun.If hes lucky this tailors Dreadnought will suffer heavy damage and lose a few officers and hell end up an officer after all.If hes really lucky he could rise to admiral.Hatherence thought about this.Would a tailor, however distinguished, necessarily make a good admiral?Probably no worse than the one hed be replacing.The problem was that to the Dwellers all professions were in effect hobbies, all posts and positions sinecures.This tailor that Ysul and the City Administrator were babbling on about would have had no real need to be a tailor, he was just somebody whod found he possessed an aptitude for the pastime (or, more likely, for the gossiping and fussing generally associated with it).He would take on clients to increase his kudos, the level of which would increase proportionally the more powerful were the people he tailored for, so that somebody in a position of civil power would constitute a favoured client, even if that position of power had come about through a lottery, some arcanely complicated rota system or plain old coercive voting  jobs like that of City Administrator were subject to all those regimes and more, depending on the band or zone concerned, or just which city was involved.The City Administrator, in return, would be able to drop casually into just the right conversations the fact she had such a well known, high kudos tailor.Obviously Ysul had had sufficient kudos of his own to be able to engage the services of this alpha outfitter too.People further down the pecking order would have employed less well connected tailors, or just got their clothes from Common, which was Dweller for, in this particular case, off the peg, and in general just meant mass produced, kudos free, available as a matter of right just because youre a Dweller well, pretty much anything, up to and including spaceships.Though having seen round a few Dweller spaceships, Fassin thought the stack em high and give them away free approach had its limitations.Indeed, Ysul was saying.My own bid for JO status has been languishing for centuries and wasnt even mentioned this time round.Entering as a rating seems demeaning, but it could pay off big if there are casualties.Of course, of course, the Administrator said, then fastened her gaze on the colonel.Whats this?An oerileithe, a little dweller, Ysul said, with what sounded like pride.Gracious!Not a child?Or food.I asked.Pleased to meet you, the colonel said with as much dignity as she could muster.An oerileithe, it appeared, attracted even less respect amongst Dwellers than Fassin  and, he suspected, the colonel herself  had expected.The oerileithe had evolved relatively recently, quite independently of the vast, unutterably ancient mainstream of galactic Dwellerdom and as such were seen by their more venerable co gas giant inhabitants as something between an annoying collective loose end and a bunch of impudent, planet usurping interlopers.And this must be the Slow Seer.The Administrator looked briefly at Fassins gascraft before returning her gaze to Ysul.Do we need to talk slowly for it?No, Administrator, Fassin said before Ysul could reply.Iam running on your timescale at the moment.How fortunate!She flicked to one side and stabbed at a screen remote, her frontal radius edge lit up by the holos glow.Hmm.I see.So all the mayhem of the last day or two is your fault, then?Has there been much mayhem, maam?Well, the partial destruction of a close orbit moon would fit most peoples definition of mayhem, the Administrator said pleasantly.An attractive feature in the sky whenever one ventured towards the cloud tops.Been there millions of years, slagged within a few per cent of breaking up completely, a ring of debris scattered round its orbit, that orbit itself changed significantly, causing everything else up there to have to shuffle round to accommodate the alteration, a small bombardment of debris across three bands, some chunks narrowly missing several items of infrastructure with more than sentimental value and others setting off automatic planetary defence laser batteries, a cascade of satellite destruction that has yet to be put entirely right.Oh, and an unauthorised fusion explosion.Middle of nowhere, granted, but still.None of this, happily, within my jurisdiction, but trouble does appear to be rather following you around, human Taak, and here you are in my city.The Administrator rolled fractionally towards Fassins gascraft.Thinking of staying long?Well Fassin began.The human is under my protection, Administrator!Ysul interrupted.I vouch for it entirely and will continue to accept all kudos consequences regarding its actions.I shall take all steps necessary to safeguard it from whatever hostile forces may wish it ill.May I count on your support for the expedition the human insists on making into the war zone?Given, the Administrator said.How splendid!We can be ready to leave within a couple of days.Especially if the tailor Deystelmin is persuaded to prioritise my combat clothing order.Ill have a word.Too kind!I swear I shall never nominate you for a coercive vote again!My gratitude knows no bounds.If Dwellers could grit their teeth, Fassin thought, the Administrators words would have been spoken through them.Excuse me, maam, he said.Yes, human Taak?Have you any word on events elsewhere in the system?As I say, the various rings and moons are shifting fractionally in their orbits to accommodate  I think he means the stellar system, not that of Nasqueron, Colonel Hatherence said.The two Dwellers turned to look at her.Dwellers had sensing bands all the way round their outer rims, plus eye bubbles low on their outer hubs.They were not known as the best glarers in the galaxy but they were always willing to give it their best shot.To a Dweller, their own planet was pretty much everything.Most gas giants had many more moons than the average stellar system possessed planets, and most radiated a lot more energy than they received from the star they orbited, their heat transfer systems, weather and ecology arising largely from processes internal to the planet itself, not dependent on sunlight.Their inhabitants had to pay close attention to the skies, basically to watch out for incoming, but even that consideration led to an obviously gas giant centred way of thinking.The local star and the rest of its planetary system was of relatively little interest to the average Dweller.That is not quite what I meant, Fassin told them quickly.The moon glantine, for example; has it been harmed?Not to my knowledge, the Administrator said, with another stern look at Hatherence.And the military ships that were in orbit around Third Fury?the colonel asked.(  Shh!Fassin signalled Hatherence.No!she sent back. )What ships?the Administrator said, apparently mystified.How about the planet Sepekte?Fassin said.I have no idea, the Administrator told him.She fixed her gaze on Fassin.Is this why you wished to see me?To ask after the welfare of moons and distant planets?No, maam.The reason that I wanted to see you is that I am worried that there may be a threat to Nasqueron.You are?blurted Ysul.Really?the Administrator said with a sigh.Even Hatherence was turned to look at him.There is a war beginning amongst the Quick, maam, Fassin told the Administrator.It is going to come to Ulubis and it is not impossible that some of the forces taking part may wish to involve Nasqueron and its Dwellers in that war in some way.The Administrator rolled fractionally back and sucked her outer trim frill in, the Dweller equivalent of a frown.(  Major?the colonel sent.You said nothing of this.What do you base this on?Is there something youre not telling me?A hunch.Just trying to get their attention.And I should point out that its considered impolite to signal whisper like this. )The Administrator continued to look at Fassin for a moment, then turned to Ysul.Ts this human normally mad?Ysul made a sucking sound.Down to definitions.Nasqueron might be vulnerable to a further bombardment, Fassin persisted.Even to some sort of raid.Ha!Ysul laughed.We are not defenceless, human Taak!the Administrator said loudly.No, but your spaceships are leaky antiques and your planetary defences are set up for dumb rocks, Fassin thought wearily.You talk a good defence, but if the Epiphany 5 invaders decide to attack, or the Mercatoria decides Im dead and they plump for a more obvious way to get hold of whatever might be in Valseirs library, you wont be able to do much to stop them.Going on what Ive seen, a single Navarchy Military destroyer could lay waste to your whole planet, over time.Of course not, he agreed.But I would ask you to pass this information on to the relevant authorities.You will be still better defended if you are prepared.Ill bear that in mind, the Administrator told him levelly.Oh shit, Fassin thought.Youre going to do fuck all.You arent going to bother telling anybody.Ysul was looking up.Whats that?he asked.Fassin experienced a moment of horror.He looked up too.A stubby vaned cylinder a couple of metres high was hovering vertically above them in the darkness outside the ceilings still open diamond petals.
