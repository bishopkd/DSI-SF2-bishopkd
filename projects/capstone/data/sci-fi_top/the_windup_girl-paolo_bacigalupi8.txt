Something like that. "Kanya glances at the mastiffs."Would windups carry it?"He reaches down and pats one of the guard dogs, goading her."If it's avian or mammalian, it could.A bath facility is where I would look first.If this were Japan, a windup crche would be my first guess, but anyone involved in biological products could be the index source. ""What kind of windups?"Gibbons blows out an exasperated breath."It's not a kind.It's a matter of exposure.If they were cultured in tainted baths, they may be carriers.Then again, if you leave that garbage to mutate, it will be in people soon enough.And the question of its index will be moot. ""How long do we have?"Gibbons shrugs."This isn't the decay of uranium or the velocity of a clipper ship.This is not predictable.Feed the beasts well, and they will learn to gorge.Culture them in a humid city of dense packed people and they will thrive.Decide for yourself how worried you should be. "Kanya turns, disgusted, and heads out the door.Gibbons calls after her, "Good luck!I'll be interested to see which of your many enemies kills you first. "Kanya ignores the taunt and bolts into clean open air.Kip approaches her, towelling her hair."Was the doctor helpful?""He gave me enough. "Kip laughs, a soft twittering."I used to think so.But I've learned that he never tells everything the first time.He leaves things out.Vital things.He likes company. "She touches Kanya's arm and Kanya has to force herself not to recoil.Kip sees the movement but only smiles gently."He likes you.He'll want you to return. "Kanya shivers."He'll be disappointed then. "Kip watches her with wide liquid eyes."I hope you don't die too soon.I also like you. "As Kanya leaves the compound, she catches sight of Jaidee, standing at the edge of the ocean, watching the surf.As if sensing her gaze, he turns and smiles, before shimmering into nothingness.Another spirit with no place to go.She wonders if Jaidee will ever manage to reincarnate, or if he will continue to haunt her.If the doctor is right, perhaps he is waiting to come back as something that will not fear the plagues, some creature that has not yet been conceived.Maybe Jaidee's only hope for reincarnation is to find new life in the husk of a windup body.Kanya squashes the thought.It's an evil idea.She hopes instead that Jaidee will reincarnate into some heaven where windups and blister rust can never be, that even if he never achieves nibbana, never finishes his time as a monk, never makes his way into buddha hood, that at least he will be saved from the anguish of watching the world he so dutifully defended stripped of its flesh by the slavering mass of nature's new successes, these windup creatures that seethe all around.Jaidee died.But perhaps that is the best that anyone can hope for.Perhaps if she put a spring gun in her mouth and pulled the trigger, she would be happier.Perhaps if she had no large house and no kamma of betrayal  Kanya shakes her head.If anything is certain, she must do her duty here.Her own soul will certainly be sent back to this world again, at best as a human being, at worst as something else, some dog or cockroach.Whatever mess she leaves behind, she will undoubtedly face it again and again and again.Her betrayals guarantee it.She must fight this battle until her kamma is finally cleansed.To flee it now in suicide would be to face it in an uglier form in the future.There is no escape for such as she.29  Despite the curfews and the white shirts, Anderson sama seems almost reckless with his attentions.It's almost as if he is making up for something.But when Emiko repeats her concerns about Raleigh, Anderson sama only smiles a secret smile and tells her she needn't worry.All things are in flux."My people are coming," he says."Very soon, everything will be different.No more white shirts. ""It sounds very beautiful. ""It will be," he says."I'll be gone for a few days, making arrangements.When I get back, everything will be different. "And then he disappears, leaving her with the admonishment that she should not change her patterns, and should not tell Raleigh anything.He gives her a key to his flat.And so it is that Emiko wakes on clean sheets in a cool room in the evening, with a crank fan beating slowly overhead.She can barely remember the last time she slept without pain or fear, and she is groggy with it.The rooms are dim, lit only by the glow of the street's gaslights flickering alive like fireflies.She is hungry.Ravenous.She finds Anderson sama's kitchen and roots through sealed bins for snacks, for crackers, for snaps, for cakes, anything.Anderson sama has no fresh vegetables, but he has rice and there is soy and fish sauce and she heats water on a burner, marvelling at the methane jug that he keeps unsecured.It is difficult for her to remember that she ever took such things for granted.That Gendo sama kept her in accommodations twice as luxurious, on the top floor of a Kyoto apartment with a view of Toji Temple and the slow movement of old men tending the shrine in their black robes.That long ago time is like a dream to her.The autumn sky with its clear breathless blue.She remembers the pleasure of watching New People children from their crche feeding the ducks or learning a tea ceremony with attention both total and without redemption.She remembers her own training  With a chill, she sees that she was trained to excellence, to the eternal service of a master.She remembers how Gendo sama took her and showered her with affection and then discarded her like a tamarind hull.It was always her destiny.It was no accident.Her eyes narrow as she stares at the pan and its boiling water, at the rice she has so perfectly measured by sight alone, without a measure cup but simply scooped with a bowl, knowing precisely how much she needed, and then unconsciously settling that rice into a perfect layer as if it were a gravel garden, as if she were preparing to perform zazen meditation on its grains, as if she would rake and rake and rake for her life with a little bowl of rice.She lashes out.The rice bowl shatters, shards spinning in different directions, the pot of water flying, scalding jewels gleaming.Emiko stands amidst the whirlwind, watching droplets fly, rice grains suspended, all of it stopped in motion, as if grain and water are windups, stuttering in flight as she herself is forced to stumble herky jerky through the world, strange and surreal in the eyes of the naturals.In the eyes of the people she so desperately desires to serve.Look what service has brought you.The pot hits the wall.Rice grains skitter across marble.Water soaks everything.Tonight she will learn the location of this New People village.The place where her own kind live and have no masters.Where New People serve only themselves.Anderson sama may say that his people are coming, but in the end, he will always be natural, and she will always be New People, and she will always serve.She stifles the urge to clean up the rice, to make things neat for Anderson sama when he returns.Instead, she makes herself stare at the mess and recognize that she is no longer a slave.If he wishes rice cleaned off the floor there are others to do his dirty work.She is something else.Something different.Optimal in her own way.And if she was once a falcon tethered, Gendo sama has done one thing she can be grateful for.He has cut her jesses.She can fly free.* * *   It is almost too easy to slip through the darkness.Emiko bobs amid the crowds, new color bright on her lips, her eyes darkened, glinting silver hoops at her lobes.She is New People, and she moves through the crowds so smoothly that they do not know she is there.She laughs at them.Laughs and slips between them.There is something suicidal ticking in her windup nature.She hides in the open.She does not scuttle.Fate has cupped her in its protective hands.She slips through the crowds, people jerking away startled from the windup in their midst, from the bit of transgressive manufactuary that has the effrontery to stain their sidewalks, as if their land were half as pristine as the islands that have ejected her.She wrinkles her nose.Even Nippon's effluent is too good for this raucous stinking place.They simply do not recognize how she graces them.She laughs to herself, and realizes when others look at her that she has laughed out loud.White shirts ahead.Flashes of them between the trundle of megodonts and handcarts.Emiko stops at the rail of a khlong bridge, looking down into the waters, waiting for the threat to pass.She sees herself in the canal's reflection with the green glow of the lamps all around, backlighting her.She feels perhaps she could become one with the water, if she simply stares at the glow long enough.Become a water lady.Already is she not part of the floating world?Does she not deserve to float and slowly sink?She stifles the thought.That is the old Emiko.The one who could never teach her to fly.A man approaches and leans against the rail.She doesn't look up, watches his reflection in the water."I like to watch when the children race their boats through the canals," he says.She nods slightly, not trusting herself to speak."Is there something you see in the water?That you look so long?"She shakes her head.His white uniform is tinged green.He is so close he can reach out and touch her.She wonders what his kind eyes would look like if his hands touched the furnace of her skin."You don't have to be afraid of me," he says."It's just a uniform.You haven't done anything wrong. ""No. "she whispers."I am not afraid. ""That's good.A pretty girl like you shouldn't be. "He pauses."Your accent is odd.When I first saw you, I thought you might be Chaozhou"  She shakes her head, slightly.A jerk."So sorry.Japanese. ""With the factories?"She shrugs.His eyes bore into her.She makes her head turn slowly, slowly, smoothly, smoothly, not a single stutter, not a single jerk and meet his eyes, return his steady gaze.Older than she first thought.Middle aged, she thinks.Or not.Perhaps he is young and only worn down by the evils of his job.She stifles the urge to extend pity to him, fights her genetic need to serve him even if he would sooner see her dismembered.Slowly, slowly, she turns her eyes back to the water."What is your name?"She hesitates."Emiko. ""A nice name.Does it mean something?"She shakes her head."Nothing important. ""So modest, for a woman so beautiful. "She shakes her head, "No.Not so.I am ugly " she breaks off, sees him staring, realizes that she has forgotten herself.Her movements have betrayed her.His eyes are wide, surprised.She backs away from him, all pretense of humanity forgotten.His eyes harden."Heechy keechy," he breathes.She smiles tightly."It was an honest mistake. ""Show me your import permits. "She smiles."Of course.I'm sure they are here.Of course. "She backs away, flashbulb movements broadcasting every kink in her DNA.He reaches for her, but she pulls her arm from his grasp, a quick twist, and then she is turning away, breaking into flight, blurring into traffic as he shouts after her."Stop her!Stop!Ministry business!Stop that windup!"Her whole essence cries to stop and give herself up, to bend to his command.It is all she can do to keep running, to push herself against the lashings of Mizumi sensei when she dared disobey, the disapproving sting of Mizumi's tongue when she dared to object to another's desires.Emiko burns with shame as his commands echo behind her, but then the crowds have swallowed her and the surge of megodont traffic is all around, and he is far too slow to discover which alley hides her as she recovers.* * *   It takes extra time to avoid the white shirts, but at the same time, it is a game.Emiko can play this game now.If she is quick and careful, and allows time between her sudden surges she evades them easily.At speed, she marvels at the movements of her body, how startlingly fluid she becomes, as if she is finally being true to her nature.As if all the training and lashes from Mizumi sensei were designed to keep this knowledge buried.Eventually she makes Ploenchit and climbs the tower.Raleigh is waiting by the bar, as he always is, impatient.He glances up."You're late.I'm fining you for that. "Emiko forces herself not to feel guilt, even as she apologizes."So sorry, Raleigh san. ""Hurry up and get changed.You have VIP guests tonight.They're important, and they'll be here soon. ""I want to ask you about the village. ""What village?"She keeps her face pleasant.Did he lie about it?Was it always a lie?"The place for New People. ""Still worrying about that?"He shakes his head.  "I told you.Earn up and I'll make sure you get there, if that's what you want. "He waves her toward the dressing rooms."Now go get changed. "Emiko starts to press again, then simply nods.Afterward.When he is drunk.When he is pliable, she will pry the information from him.In the dressing room, Kannika is already pulling on her performance clothes.She makes a face at Emiko but doesn't say anything as Emiko changes and then goes out to get her first glass of ice for the evening.She drinks carefully, savoring the coolness and sense of well being that overcomes her even in the swelter of the tower.Out beyond the roped off windows, the city glows.From a height it is beautiful.Without natural people in it, she thinks that she could even enjoy it here.She drinks more water.A rustle of warning and surprise.Women drop to their knees and press their foreheads to the ground in a khrab.Emiko joins them.The man is back, again.The hard man.The one who came with Anderson sama before.She searches for signs of Anderson sama, hoping that he will be there too, but there is no sign of him.The Somdet Chaopraya and his friends are already flushed and drunk as they come through the doors.Raleigh rushes to them and ushers them into his VIP room.Kannika slips up behind her."Finish your water, heechy keechy.You've got work to do. "Emiko stifles the urge to snap at the girl.It would be insane to do so.But she looks at Kannika and prays that when she knows the village's location that she will have an opportunity to pay the woman back for all the abuse she has delivered.The VIP room is crowded with men.There are windows to the outside, but with the door closed, there is little circulation.And the act is worse than when Emiko is on the stage.Normally there are patterns to Kannika's abuse.Here though, Kannika leads her around, introducing her to the men, encouraging them to touch her and feel the heat of her skin, saying things like, "You like her?You think she's a nasty dog?Watch.You'll see a nasty one tonight. "The powerful one and his bodyguards and his friends are all laughing and making jokes at the sight of her, at the feel of her as they pinch her ass and tug at her breasts, run their fingers up between her thighs, all of them a little nervous at this novelty of entertainment.Kannika points to the table."Up. "Emiko climbs awkwardly onto the gleaming black surface.Kannika snaps at her, making her walk, making her bow.Makes her totter back and forth in her strange windup way while liquor flows and more girls come in and sit with the men and laugh and make jokes and all the while Emiko is shown off, and then, as it must be, Kannika takes her.She forces Emiko down on the table.The men gather round as Kannika begins her abuse.Slowly, it builds, first playing at her nipples, then sliding the jadeite cock between her legs, encouraging the reactions that have been designed into her and which she cannot control, no matter how much her soul fights against it.The men cheer at Emiko's degradation, encouraging escalation, and Kannika, flushed with excitement, begins to devise new tortures.She squats over Emiko.Parts the cheeks of her ass and encourages Emiko to plumb her depths.The men laugh as Emiko obeys and Kannika narrates:  "Ah yes, I feel her tongue now. "Then: "Do you like it with your tongue there, dirty windup?"To the men: "She likes it.All these dirty windups like it. "More laughter."More, nasty girl.More. "And then she is pressing down, smothering her, encouraging Emiko to redouble her efforts as her humiliation mounts, encouraging her to work harder to please.Kannika's hand joins Emiko's tongue, playing, taking pleasure from Emiko's subservience.Emiko hears Kannika speaking again."You want to see her?Go ahead. "Hands on Emiko's thighs, pushing them apart so that she is completely exposed.Fingers play at her folds, penetrate her.Kannika laughs."You want to fuck her?Fuck the windup girl?Here.Give me her legs. "Her hands close on Emiko's ankles, pull them up, exposing her completely."No. "Emiko whispers, but Kannika is implacable.She pries Emiko's legs wide."Be a good little heechy keechy. "Kannika settles herself again over Emiko, narrating her degradation to the assembled men."She'll eat anything you put in her mouth," she says, and the men are laughing.And then Kannika is pressing down hard on Emiko's face and Emiko can't see anymore, can only hear as Kannika calls her a slut and a dog and a nasty windup toy.Calls her no better than a dildo  And then there is silence.Emiko tries to move, but Kannika keeps her pinned, muffled from the world."Stay there," Kannika says.Then: "No.Use this. "Emiko feels men taking her arms, pinning her down.Fingers prod her, invade her, slide in."Oil it," Kannika whispers, excitement in her voice.Her hands tighten on Emiko's ankles.Wetness at her anus, slick, and then a pressure, cold pressure.Emiko moans a protest.The pressure lets up for a moment, but then Kannika says, "You call yourselves men?Fuck her!Look how she jerks.Look at her arms and legs when you push!Make her do her heechy keechy dance. "And then the pressure comes back and the men are holding her down more tightly, and she can't get up and the cold thing presses again against her ass, penetrates her, spreads her wide, splits her open, fills her and she is crying out.Kannika laughs."That's right windup; earn your keep.You can get up when you make me come. "And then Emiko is licking again, slobbering and lapping like a dog, desperate, as the champagne bottle penetrates her again, as it withdraws and shoves deep into her, burning.The men all laugh."Look at how she moves!"Tears jewel in her eyes.Kannika encourages her to greater effort and the falcon if there is any falcon in Emiko at all, if it ever existed, is a dead thing, dangling.Not meant to live or fly or escape.Meant to do nothing but submit.Emiko learns her place once again.All night long, Kannika teaches the merits of obedience and Emiko begs to obey and stop the pain and violation, begs to serve, to do anything at all, anything at all to let the windup live just a little longer and Kannika laughs and laughs.* * *   By the time Kannika is done with her, it is late.Emiko sits against a wall, exhausted and broken.Her mascara has run.Inside, she is dead.Better to be dead than a windup, she thinks.She watches dully as a man starts to mop the club.At the other end of the bar, Raleigh drinks his whiskey and laughs.The man with the mop slowly approaches.Emiko wonders if he will try to mop her away with the rest of the filth.If he will take her out and throw her into one of the trash piles, leave her for the Dung Lord's collection.She can simply lie there, and let them mulch her thrown away as Gendo sama should have discarded her.She is trash.Emiko understands this now.The man pushes his rag mop around her."Why don't you throw me away?"she croaks.The man looks at her uncertainly, then turns his eyes to his work.Keeps mopping.She says it again."Answer me!"she shouts."Why don't you throw me away?"Her words echo in the open room.Raleigh glances up and frowns.She realizes that she has been speaking in Japanese.She says it again in Thai."Throw me away, why not?I'm trash, too.Throw me away!"The mopping man flinches and draws back, smiling uncertainly.Raleigh approaches.Kneels down beside her."Emiko.Get up.You're frightening my cleaning guy. "Emiko makes a face."I don't care. ""Sure you do. "He nods toward the door, to the private room where the men are still reclining, drinking and talking after their abuse of her."I've got a bonus for you.Those guys tip well. "Emiko looks up at him."They tip Kannika, too?"Raleigh studies her."It's not your business. ""They tip her triple?Give me 50 baht?"His eyes narrow."Don't. ""Or what?Or you throw Emiko into a methane composter?Dump me with the white shirts?""Don't push me.You don't want to piss me off. "He stands up."Come get your money when you're done feeling sorry for yourself. "Emiko watches dully as he stalks back to his barstool, gets himself a drink.He glances back at her, makes a comment to Daeng, who smiles dutifully and pours water with ice.Raleigh waves the water at her.Sets it on top of a purple sheaf of baht.He goes back to his drinking, seeming to ignore her staring.What happens to windup girls who are broken?She never knew a windup girl who died.Sometimes an old patron did.But the windup girl lived.Her girlfriends lived.They lasted longer.Something she never asked Mizumi sensei.Emiko hobbles to the bar, stumbles.Leans against it.Drinks the ice.Raleigh shoves the money over.She finishes the ice water.Swallows the cubes.Feels their cold seeping into her core."Have you asked, yet?""About what?"He's playing solitaire on the bar."Going north. "He glances up at her, then flips another set of cards.He's quiet for a second."That's tough work.Not something you set up in a day. ""Have you asked?"He glances at her."Yeah.I asked.And no one's going anywhere while the white shirts are pissed off about the Jaidee massacre.I'll let you know when the situation changes. ""I want to go north. ""You already told me.Earn up, and it will happen. ""I earn plenty.I want to go now. "Raleigh's slap comes fast, but she sees it coming.It is fast for him, but not for her.She watches his hand proceed toward her face with the sort of servile gratitude that she used to feel when Gendo sama took her to dinner at a fancy restaurant.Her cheek stings and then floods with puffy numbness.She touches it with her fingers, savoring the wound.Raleigh looks at her coldly."You'll go when it's damn well convenient. "Emiko bows her head slightly, allowing the well deserved lesson to filter into her core."You aren't going to help me, are you?"Raleigh shrugs, goes back to his cards."Does it even exist?"she asks.Raleigh glances over at her."Sure.If it makes you happy.It's there.If you keep hassling me about it, it doesn't.Now get out of my face. "The falcon dangles dead.She is dead.Mulch for composters.Meat for the city, rot for gaslights.Emiko stares at Raleigh.The falcon lies dead.And then she thinks that some things are worse than dying.Some things can never be borne.Her fist is very fast.Raleigh san's throat is soft.The old man topples, hands flying to his throat, eyes wide with shock.It is all slow motion: Daeng turning at the sound of the stool clattering to the floor; Raleigh sprawling, his mouth working, trying to suck air; the cleaning man dropping his mop; Noi and Saeng at the other side of the bar with their men waiting to escort them home, all of them turning toward the sound, and every one of them is slow.By the time Raleigh hits the floor, Emiko is already bolting across the room, toward the VIP door and the man who hurt her most.The man who sits and laughs with his friends and thinks nothing of the pain he inflicts.She slams into the door.Men look up with surprise.Heads turn, mouths open to cry out.The bodyguards are reaching for their spring guns, but all of them are moving too too slow.None of them are New People.30  Pai crawls up beside Kanya, stares down at the shadow village below."That's it?"Kanya nods and glances back at the rest of her squad, who have spread out to cover the other approaches to the shrimp farms where they breed bitter water resistant prawns for the Krung Thep fish markets.The houses are all on bamboo rafts currently grounded, but when the floods come, the houses will float, rising, as water and silt rushes across their paddy and ponds.Her own family on the Mekong used something similar long years ago, before General Pracha came."It was a good lead," she murmurs.Ratana had been almost ecstatic.A link, a clue: fish mites between the third body's toes.And if fish mites, then shrimp farms, and if shrimp farms then the only ones that would have sent a worker into Bangkok.And that meant shrimp farms that had experienced a die off.Which led her to this Thonburi half floating settlement with all of her men at the edge of the embankment, ready to raid in the darkness.Down below, a few candles flicker inside the bamboo houses.A dog barks.They're all wearing their containment suits.Ratana insisted that the likelihood of a jump was slender, and yet still a worry.A mosquito whines in Kanya's ear.She slaps it away and draws her containment suit's hood tight.Starts to sweat in earnest.The sound of laughter carries across the fish ponds.A family, all together in the warmth of their hut.Even now, with all their hardship, people still can laugh.Not Kanya, though.Something in her is broken, it seems.Jaidee always insisted that the Kingdom was a happy country, that old story about the Land of Smiles.But Kanya cannot think of a time when she has seen smiles as wide as those in museum photos from before the Contraction.She sometimes wonders if those people in the photos were acting, if perhaps the National Gallery is intended to depress her, or if it is really true that at one point people smiled so totally, so fearlessly.Kanya pulls her mask over her face."Send them in. "Pai signals the men, and then her troops are all up and over the edges, coming down on the village, surrounding it as they always do before the burning begins.When they came to her own village, the white shirts appeared between two huts in the space of a minute, flares hissing and sparking in their hands.This is different.No blaring megaphones.No officers splashing through ankle deep waters, dragging screaming people away from their houses as bamboo and WeatherAll burst orange and alive with flame.General Pracha wants it quiet.As he signed the quarantine waivers he said, "Jaidee would have turned this into an emergency, but we don't have the resources to stir the cobra nest with Trade and also handle this.It could even be used against us.Deal with this quietly. ""Of course.Quietly. "The dog starts barking madly.It's joined by others as they approach.A few villagers come out on their porches, peer out into the darkness.Catch the gleam of white in the night.They shout warnings to their families as Kanya's white shirts break into a run.Jaidee kneels beside her, watching the action."Pracha talks about me as if I were some sort of a megodont, trampling rice shoots," he says.Kanya ignores him but Jaidee doesn't shut up."You should have seen him when we were both cadets," he says."He would piss his pants when we went out into the field. "Kanya glances over at Jaidee."Stop.Just because you are dead doesn't mean that you should heap disrespect upon him. "Her men's shakelight LEDs blaze alive, illuminating the village in a bitter glare.Families are dashing about like chickens, trying to hide food and animals.Someone tries to dash past the cordon, splashing through the water, diving into a pond and flailing for the other side where more of Kanya's net appears.The man treads water in the center of the muddy shrimp hole, trapped.Jaidee asks, "How can you call him your leader when we both know where your true loyalties lie?""Shut up. ""Is it hard being a horse ridden by two men at once?Both of them riding you like "  "Shut up!"Pai startles."What is it?""Sorry. "Kanya shakes her head."My fault.I was thinking. "Pai nods down at the villagers."It looks like they're ready for you. "Kanya gets to her feet and she and Pai and Jaidee uninvited but smiling and pleased with himself all descend.She has a photo of the dead man, a black and white thing developed in the lab with fumbling dark fingers.She shows it to the farmers under the beam of her shakelight's LEDs, shining it from the photo to their eyes, trying to catch them in a flinch of recognition.With some people, a white uniform opens doors, but with fish farmers it is always a problem.She knows them well, reads the calluses on their hands, smells the stink of their successes and failures in the reek of the ponds.She sees herself through their eyes, and knows she might as well be an enforcer from a calorie company, hunting for signs of a genehack.Still the charade continues, all of them shaking their heads, Kanya shining her light into each one's eyes.One by one, they look away.Finally she finds a man and waves the picture in front of him."Do you know him?Won't his relatives be looking for him?"The man looks at the picture and then at Kanya's uniform."He doesn't have any relatives. "Kanya jerks with surprise."You know him?Who was he?""He's dead then?""Doesn't he look dead?"They both study the bloodless photo, the ravaged face."I told him there were better things than factory jobs.He didn't listen. ""You say he worked in the city. ""That's right. ""Do you know where?"He shakes his head."Where did he live?"The man points toward a black shadow stilt house.Kanya waves at her men."Quarantine that hut. "She tightens her mask and enters, sweeping her light around the space.It's gloomy.Broken and strange and empty.Dust gleams in her beam.Knowing that the owner is already dead gives her a sense of foreboding.The man's spirit might be here.His hungry ghost lurking and angry that he is still in this world, that he has been sickened.That he may have been murdered.She fingers the man's few effects and wanders around the place.Nothing.She steps back outside.Off in the distance, the city rises, haloed in green, the place the dead man ran to when fish farming proved untenable.She goes back to the man."You're sure you don't know anything about where he worked?"The man shakes his head."Nothing?Not a name?Anything. "She tries not to let her desperation show.He shakes his head again.She turns in frustration and surveys the village blackness.Crickets chirp.Ivory beetles creak steadily.They're in the right place.She's so close.Where is this factory?Gi Bu Sen was right.She should just burn the entire factory district.In the old days, when the white shirts were strong, it would have been easy."You want to burn now?"Jaidee snickers beside her."Now you see my side?"She ignores his jab.Not far away, a young girl is watching her intently.When Kanya catches her staring, she looks away.Kanya touches Pai on the shoulder."That one. ""The girl?"He's surprised.Kanya is already walking, closing on her.The girl looks as if she will bolt.Kanya kneels, still a good distance away.Beckons her over."You.What's your name?"The girl is obviously torn.She wants to flee, but Kanya has an authority that cannot be denied."Come over here.Tell me your name. "She beckons again and this time the girl allows herself to be reeled close."Mai," the girl whispers.Kanya holds up the photo."You know where this man worked, don't you?"Mai shakes her head, but Kanya knows the girl is lying.Children are terrible liars.Kanya had been a terrible liar.When the white shirts questioned where her family was hiding their carp breeding stock, she had told them south and they had gone north, with knowing adult smiles.She offers the photo to the girl."You understand how dangerous this is, yes?"The girl hesitates."Will you burn the village?"Kanya tries to keep the flood of reaction off her face."Of course not. "She smiles again, speaks soothingly."Don't worry, Mai.I know what it is to fear.I grew up in a village like this.I know how hard it is.But you must help me find the source of this sickness, or more will die. ""I was told not to tell. ""And it is good for us to respect our patrons," Kanya pauses."But we all owe loyalty to Her Royal Majesty the Queen, and she wishes that we all be safe.The Queen would want you to help us. "Mai hesitates, then says, "Three others worked at the factory. "Kanya leans forward, trying to hide her eagerness."Which one?"Mai hesitates.Kanya leans close."How many phii will blame you if you allow them to die before their kamma allots their passing?"Still Mai hesitates.Pai says, "If we break her fingers, she will tell us. "The girl looks frightened.But Kanya holds out a soothing hand."Don't worry.He won't do anything.He is a tiger, but I have his leash.Please.Just help us save the city.You can help us save Krung Thep. "The girl looks away, toward the crumbling glow of Bangkok across the waters."The factory is closed now.Closed by you. ""That's very good then.But we must make sure the disease doesn't go any further.What is the name of the factory?"The answer comes unwillingly."SpringLife. "Kanya frowns, trying to remember the name."A kink spring company?One of the Chaozhou?"Mai shakes her head."Farang.Very rich farang. "Kanya settles beside her."Tell me more. "31  Anderson finds Emiko huddled outside his door, and all at once a good night becomes an uncertain one.For the last several days he has worked frantically to prepare the invasion, all of it crippled by the fact that he never expected to be cut off from his own factory.His own piss poor planning forced him to waste extra days scouting a safe route back into the SpringLife facility without being caught by the plethora of white shirt patrols that cordoned the manufacturing district.If it hadn't been for the discovery of Hock Seng's escape route, he might still have been lurking around the back alleys, wishing for an access method.As it was, Anderson slipped in through the shutters of the SpringLife offices with a blackened face and grapple slung over his shoulder while giving thanks to a crazy old man who just days before had robbed the company's entire payroll.The factory had reeked.The algae baths had all gone to rot but not a thing moved in the gloom, and for that he was grateful.If the white shirts had posted guards within Anderson held a hand over his mouth as he slipped down to the main hall and then down along the manufacturing lines.The stink of rot and megodont dung thickened.Under the shadow of algae racks and the loom of the cutting presses, he examined the floor.This close to the algae tanks, the stink was horrific, as if a cow had died and rotted.The end stage reek of Yates' optimistic plan for a new energy future.Anderson knelt and pushed away desiccated algae strands from around one of the drains.He felt along the edges, seeking purchase.Lifted.The iron grate came up with a squeal.As quietly as he could, Anderson rolled the heavy grate away and set it with a clank on concrete.He lay down on the floor, prayed he wouldn't surprise a snake or scorpion, and plunged his arm down the hole.His fingers scrabbled in the darkness, questing.Straining deeper into moist blackness.For a moment he feared it had slipped loose, had floated down the drain and on through the sewers to King Rama's groundwater pumps, but then his fingers touched oilskin.He peeled it from the drain wall, drew it out, smiling.A code book.For contingencies that he never seriously believed would come to pass.In the blackness of the offices, he dialed numbers and brought operators alert in Burma and India.Sent secretaries scurrying for code strings unused since Finland.Two days later, he stood on the floating island of Koh Angrit, arranging the last details with strike team leaders in the AgriGen compound.The weaponry would arrive within days, the invasion teams were assembling.And the money had already been shipped across, the gold and jade that would help generals change their loyalties and turn on their old friend General Pracha.But now, with all the preparations completed, he returns to the city to find Emiko huddled at his door, miserable, and covered with blood.As soon as she sees him, she lunges into his arms, sobbing."What are you doing here?"he whispers.Cradling her against him he unlocks the door and urges her inside.Her skin burns.The blood is everywhere.Slashes mark her face and scar her arms.He shuts the door quickly."What happened to you?"He pries her off him, tries to inspect her.She's a furnace of blood, but the wounds on her face and arms don't account for the sticky spattering that coats her."Whose blood is this?"She shakes her head.Begins sobbing again."Let's get you cleaned up. "He leads her into the bath, turns on cool water spray, puts her under it.She's shivering now, her eyes fever bright and panicked as she looks around.She looks half mad.He tries to peel off her half jacket, to get rid of the bloody clothing, but her face twists, enraged."No!"She slashes at him with her hand and he jerks back, touching his cheek."What the hell?!"He stares at her, shocked.Christ she was fast.He's hurting.His hand comes away bloody."What the hell's wrong with you?"The panicked animal flicker leaves her eyes.She stares at him blankly, and then seems to recover herself, becomes human."I am sorry," she whispers."So sorry. "She collapses, curls into a ball under the water."So sorry.So sorry. "She lapses into Japanese.Anderson squats down beside her, his own clothing becoming soaked in the spray."Don't worry about it. "He speaks gently."Why don't you get out of those clothes?We'll get you something else.Okay?Can you do that?"She nods dully.Peels off her jacket.Unwraps her pha sin.Huddles nude in the cool water.He leaves her in the spray.Takes her bloody clothes and bundles them into a sheet and carries them down the stair, out into the darkness.People are all around.He ignores them, walking quickly into the shadows, carrying the clothes until he reaches a khlong.Tosses the bloody garments into the water, where snakehead fish and boddhi carp will consume them with an obsessive determination.The water roils, splashing as they tear at the blood food scent.By the time he's back in his apartment, Emiko is out of the shower, her black hair clinging to her face, a small frightened creature.He goes to his medicine supplies.Pours alcohol on the cuts, rubs antivirals in after.She doesn't cry out.Her nails are broken and ravaged.Bruises are blooming all across her body.But for all the blood she arrived with, she seems miraculously little damaged."What happened?"he asks gently.She huddles against him."I'm alone," she whispers."There is no place for New People. "Her shaking increases.He pulls her to him, feeling the burning heat through her skin."It's all right.Everything will change soon.It will be different. "She shakes her head."No.I do not think so. "A moment later, she is asleep, breathing steadily, her body finally releasing its tension into unconsciousness.* * *   Anderson wakes with a start.The crank fan has stopped, run out of joules.He's covered with sweat.Beside him Emiko moans and thrashes, a furnace.He rolls away and sits up.A slight breeze from the sea runs through the apartment, a relief.He stares out through mosquito nets to the blackness of the city.All the methane has been shut off for the night.Off in the distance, he can see a few glimmers in the floating sea communities of Thonburi where they farm fish and float from one genehack to the next in a perpetual seeking of survival.Someone pounds on his door.Hammering insistently.Emiko's eyes snap open.She sits up."What is it?""Someone's at the door. "He starts to climb out of bed but she grabs him, ragged nails digging into his arm."Don't open it!"she whispers.Her skin is pale in the moonlight, her eyes wide and frightened."Please. "The banging on his door increases.Thudding, insistent."Why not?""I " she pauses."It will be white shirts. ""What?"Anderson's heart skips over."They followed you here?Why?What happened to you?"She shakes her head miserably.He stares at her, wondering what sort of animal has invaded his life."What happened tonight, really?"She doesn't answer.Her eyes remain locked on the door as the thumping continues.Anderson climbs out of bed and hurries to the door.Shouts, "Just a second!I'm getting dressed!""Anderson!"The voice from the far side of door is Carlyle's."Open up!It's important!"Anderson turns and looks pointedly at Emiko."It's not white shirts.Now hide. ""No?"For a moment relief floods Emiko's features.But it disappears almost as quickly.She shakes her head."You are mistaken. "Anderson glares at her."Was it white shirts that you tangled with?Is that where you got those cuts?"She shakes her head miserably, but says nothing, just huddles in a small defensive ball."Jesus and Noah. "Anderson goes and pulls clothes out of his closet, tosses them at her, gifts that he bought her as tokens of his intoxication."You might be ready to go public, but I'm not ready to be ruined.Get dressed.Hide in my closet. "She shakes her head again.Anderson tries to control his voice, to speak reasonably.It's as though he's talking to a block of wood.He kneels and takes her chin in his hands, turns her face to him."It's one of my business associates.It's not about you.But I still need you to hide until he goes away.Do you understand?You just need to hide for a little while.I want you to hide until he's gone.I don't want him to see us together.It might give him leverage. "Slowly, her eyes focus.The look of hypnotized fatalism fades.Carlyle bangs on the door again.Her eyes flick to the door, then back to Anderson."It is white shirts," she whispers."There are many of them out there.I can hear them. "She suddenly seems to collect herself."It will be white shirts.Hiding will do no good. "Anderson fights the urge to scream at her."It's not white shirts. "The banging continues on his door."Open the fuck up, Anderson!"He calls back, "Just a second!"He pulls on a pair of pants, glaring at her."It's not the damn white shirts.Carlyle would slit his throat before he'd get into bed with white shirts. "Carlyle's voice again echoes through the door."Hurry up, goddamnit!""Coming!"He turns to her, orders her."Hide.Now. "Not a request anymore, but an order, driving at her genetic heritage and her training.Her body goes still, then suddenly she becomes animated.Nodding."Yes.I will do as you say. "Already she is dressing.Her stutter motion is fast, almost a blur.Her skin gleams as she pulls on a blouse and a pair of loose trousers.Suddenly she's shockingly fast.Fluid in her movements, strangely and suddenly graceful."Hiding will do no good," she says.She turns and runs for the balcony."What are you doing?"She turns back and smiles at him, seems about to say something, but instead she plunges over the balcony's edge and disappears into the blackness."Emiko!"Anderson runs to the balcony.Below, there is nothing.No person, no scream, no thud, no complaints from the street as she spatters across the ground.Nothing.Only emptiness.As though the night has swallowed her completely.The banging on the door comes again.Anderson's heart thuds in his chest.Where is she?How did she do that?It is unnatural.She was so fast, so determined at the end.One minute on the balcony, the next gone, over the edge.Anderson peers into the blackness.It's impossible that she jumped to another balcony, and yet Did she fall?Is she dead?The door crashes open.Anderson whirls.Carlyle spills into the apartment room, stumbling."What the ?"Black Panthers pour in after Carlyle, slamming him aside.Combat armor gleams in the dimness, military shadows.One of the soldiers grabs Anderson, whirls him about and slams him into the wall.Hands search his body.When he struggles they jam his face against the wall.More men pour in.Doors are being kicked open, splintering.Boots thud around him.An avalanche of men.Glass breaks.Dishes in his kitchen shatter.Anderson cranes his neck to see what is happening.A hand grabs him by the hair and slams his face back against the wall.Blood and pain flood his mouth.He's bitten his tongue."What the hell are you doing?Do you know who I am?"He chokes off as Carlyle is dumped on the floor beside him.He can see now that the man is tied.Bruises pepper his face.One eye is swollen shut, black blood scabs on the orbital bone.His brown hair is clotted with blood."Christ. "The soldiers wrench Anderson's hands behind his back and bind them.They grab his hair and jerk him around.A solider shouts at him, speaking so fast he can't understand.Wide eyes and spittle in his face as the man rages.Finally Anderson catches words: Heechy keechy."Where is the windup?Where is it?Where?Where?"The Panthers tear through his apartment.Rifle butts to smash open locks and doors.Huge black windup mastiffs scramble inside, barking and slavering, snuffling everywhere, howling as they catch their target's scent.A man shouts at him again, some kind of captain."What's going on?"Anderson demands again."I have friends "  "Not many. "Akkarat strides through the door."Akkarat!"Anderson tries to turn but the Panthers slam him back against the wall."What's going on?""We have the same question for you. "Akkarat shouts orders in Thai to the men tossing Anderson's apartment.Anderson closes his eyes, desperately thankful that the windup girl didn't hide in the closet as he suggested.To be found with her, caught out  One of the Panthers returns, carrying Anderson's spring gun.Akkarat makes a face of distaste."Do you have a permit to be armed?""We're starting a revolution and you're asking about permits?"Akkarat nods to his men.Anderson slams back against the wall.Pain explodes in his skull.The room dims and his knees buckle.He staggers, barely keeps his feet."What the hell's going on?"Akkarat motions for the pistol.Takes it.Pumps it idly, the heavy dull thing massive in his fist."Where is the windup girl?"Anderson spits blood."Why do you care?You're not a white shirt or a Grahamite. "The Panthers slam Anderson against the wall again.Colored dots swim in Anderson's vision."Where did the windup come from?"Akkarat asks."She's Japanese!From Kyoto I think!"Akkarat puts the pistol to Anderson's head."How did you get her into the country?""What?"Akkarat strikes him with the butt of the pistol.The world darkens.water gushes into his face.Anderson gasps and splutters.He's sitting on the floor.Akkarat presses the spring gun to Anderson's throat, pushing him to climb up to his feet again, then to teeter onto his toes.Anderson gags at the pressure."How did you get the windup into the country?"Akkarat repeats.Sweat and blood sting Anderson's eyes.He blinks and shakes his head."I didn't get her in. "He spits blood again."She was a Japanese discard.How would I get my hands on a windup?"Akkarat smiles, says something to his men."A military windup is a Japanese discard?"He shakes his head."I think not. "He slams the pistol butt into Anderson's ribs.Once.Twice.Each side, cracking.Anderson yowls and doubles over, coughing and cringing away.Akkarat drags him upright."Why would a military windup be in our City of Divine Beings?""She's not military," Anderson protests."She's just a secretary was just a "  Akkarat's expression doesn't change.He spins Anderson around and forces his face against the wall, grinding bones.Anderson thinks his jaw is broken.He feels Akkarat's hands, prying his fingers apart.Anderson tries to make a fist, whimpering, knowing what is coming, but Akkarat's hands are strong, prying them open.Anderson experiences a moment of tingling helplessness.His finger twists in Akkarat's grip.Snaps.Anderson howls into the wall as Akkarat supports him.When he's done whimpering and shaking, Akkarat grabs him by the hair and pulls his head back so that they can look into one another's eyes.Akkarat's voice is steady."She is military, she is a killer, and you are the one who introduced her to the Somdet Chaopraya.Where is she now?""A killer?"Anderson shakes his head, trying to think straight."But she's nothing!A Mishimoto discard.Japanese trash "  "The Environment Ministry is right about one thing.You AgriGen animals can't be trusted.You call the windup a simple pleasure toy, and so conveniently introduce your assassin to the Queen's protector. "He leans close, eyes full of rage."You might as well have killed royalty. ""But that's impossible!"Anderson doesn't even try to keep the hysteria from his voice.His broken finger throbs, blood fills his mouth again."She's just a piece of trash.She couldn't do something like that.You have to believe me. ""She killed three men and their bodyguards.Eight trained men.The proof is unassailable. "Unbidden, he remembers Emiko huddled on his doorstep, soaked in blood.Eight men?Remembers her disappearing over the balcony, plunging into darkness like some kind of spirit creature.What if they're right?"There's got to be another explanation.She's just a goddamn windup.All they do is obey. "Emiko in bed, huddled.Sobbing.Her body torn and scratched.Anderson takes a breath, tries to control his voice."Please.You have to believe me.We would never jeopardize so much.AgriGen doesn't benefit from the Somdet Chaopraya's death.Nobody does.This plays right into the Environment Ministry's hands.We have too much to gain from a good relationship. ""And yet you introduced the killer to him. ""But it's insane.How would anyone get a military windup here and keep it under wraps?That windup has been around for years and years.Ask around.You'll see.She bribed her way with the white shirts, her papa san had that show running for ages"  He's babbling, but he can see Akkarat listening now.The cold rage is gone from the man's eyes.Now there is consideration.Anderson spits blood and looks Akkarat in the eye."Yes.I introduced that creature.But it was only because she was a novelty.Everyone knows his reputation. "He flinches as a new surge of anger twists Akkarat's face."Please listen to me.Investigate this.If you investigate, you'll find out it wasn't us.There has to be another explanation.We had no idea" He breaks off, tiredly."Just investigate.  ""We cannot.The Environment Ministry has the case. ""What?"Anderson can't hide his surprise."By what authority?""The windup makes it a case for their Ministry.She is an invasive. ""And you think I'm the one behind it?When those bastards are controlling the investigation?"Anderson works through the implications, hunting for reasons, excuses, anything to buy time."You can't trust them.Pracha and his people" He pauses."Pracha would set us up.He'd do it in a second.Maybe he's caught wind of our plans, he could be moving against us right now.Using this as cover.If he knew the Somdet Chaopraya was against him "  "Our plans were secret," Akkarat says."Nothing's secret.Not on the scale we're working.One of the generals could have leaked to their old friend.And now he's just assassinated three of ours, and we're pointing fingers at each other. "Akkarat considers.Anderson waits, breath held.Finally Akkarat shakes his head."No.Pracha would never attack royalty.He is garbage, but still, he is Thai. ""But it wasn't me, either!"He looks down at Carlyle."It wasn't us!There has to be another explanation. "He starts to cough with panic, a cough that becomes an uncontrolled spasm.At last it stops.His ribs ache.He spits blood, and wonders if his lung is punctured from the beating.He looks up at Akkarat, trying to control his words.To make them count.To sound reasonable."There must be some way to find out what really happened to the Somdet Chaopraya.Some connection.Something. "A Panther leans forward and whispers in Akkarat's ear.Anderson thinks he recognizes him from the party on the barge.One of the Somdet Chaopraya's men.The hard one with the feral face and the still eyes.He whispers more words.Akkarat nods sharply."Khap. "Motions his men to push Anderson and Carlyle into the next room."All right, Khun Anderson.We will see what we can learn. "They shove him down on the floor beside Carlyle."Make yourself comfortable," Akkarat says."I've given my man twelve hours to investigate.You had better pray to whatever Grahamite god you worship that your story is confirmed. "Anderson feels a surge of hope."Find out everything you can.You'll see it wasn't us.You'll see. "He sucks on his split lip."That windup isn't anything other than a Japanese toy.Someone else is responsible for this.The white shirts are just trying to get us to go after each other.Ten to one says it's the white shirts, moving on us all. ""We will see. "Anderson lets his head loll back against the wall, adrenaline and nervous energy firing under his skin.His hand throbs.The broken finger dangles useless.Time.He's bought time.Now it's just a matter of waiting.Of trying to find the next fingerhold to survival.He coughs again, wincing at the pain in his ribs.Beside him, Carlyle groans, but doesn't wake up.Anderson coughs again and stares at the wall, collecting himself for the next round of conflict with Akkarat.But even as he considers the many angles, trying to understand what has caused this rapid change in circumstance, another image keeps intruding.The sight of the windup girl running for the balcony and plunging into darkness, faster than anything he has ever seen, a wraith of movement and feral grace.Fast and smooth.And at speed, terrifyingly beautiful.32  Smoke billows around Kanya.Four more bodies discovered, in addition to the ones they'd already found in the hospitals.The plague is mutating more quickly than she expected.Gi Bu Sen hinted that it might, but the counting of bodies fills her with foreboding.Pai moves along the edges of a fish pond.They've thrown lye and chlorine into the pond, huge sacks.Clouds of acrid scent waft across everyone, making them cough.The stench of fear.She remembers other ponds filled, other people huddled while the white shirts ranged through the village, burning burning burning.She closes her eyes.How she had hated the white shirts then.And so when the local jao por found her intelligent and driven, he sent her to the capital with instructions: to volunteer with the white shirts, to work for them, to ingratiate herself.A country godfather, working in concert with the enemies of the white shirts.Seeking revenge for the usurpation of his power.Dozens of other children went south to beg on the Ministry's doors, and all of them with the same instructions.Of the ones she arrived with, she is the only one who rose so high, but there are others, she knows, others like her, seeded throughout.Other embittered loyal children."I forgive you," Jaidee murmurs.Kanya shakes her head and ignores him.Waves to Pai that the ponds are ready to be buried.If they are lucky, the village will cease to exist entirely.Her men work quickly, eager to be gone.They all have masks and suits, but in the relentless heat these shields are more torture than protection.More clouds of acrid smoke.The villagers are crying.The girl Mai stares at Kanya, her expression flat.A formative moment for the child.This memory will lodge like a fish bone in the throat; she will never be free of it.Kanya's heart goes out to her.If only you could understand.But it is impossible for one so small to comprehend the gray brutalities of life.If only I could have understood."Captain Kanya!"She turns.A man is coming across the dikes, stumbling in the mud of the paddies, stumbling through jewel green rice shoots.Pai looks up with interest, but Kanya waves him away.The messenger arrives breathless."Buddha smiles on you, and the Ministry. "He waits expectantly."Now?"Kanya stares at him.Looks back at the burning village."You want me now?"The young boy looks around nervously, surprised at her response.Kanya waves impatiently."Tell me again.Now?""Buddha smiles on you.And the Ministry.All roads start at the heart of Krung Thep.All roads. "Kanya grimaces and calls to her lieutenant."Pai!I must go. ""Now?"He masters his surprise as he comes over to her.Kanya nods."It's unavoidable. "She waves at the flaming bamboo houses."Finish up here. ""What about the villagers?""Keep them roped here.Send food.If no one else sickens this week, we are likely finished. ""You think we could be so lucky?"Kanya makes herself smile, thinking how unnatural it is to reassure someone with Pai's experience."We can hope. "She waves at the boy."Take me, then. "She glances at Pai."Meet me at the Ministry when you have finished here.We have one more place left to burn. ""The farang factory?"Kanya almost smiles at his eagerness."We cannot let the source go uncleansed.Is that not our job?""You are a new Tiger!"Pai exclaims.He claps her on the back before he remembers his station and wais apology for his forwardness and then hurries back to the destruction of the village."A new Tiger," Jaidee mutters beside her."Very nice for you. ""It's your own fault.You trained them to need a radical. ""And so they choose you?"Kanya sighs."If you carry a burning torch, apparently it is enough. "Jaidee laughs at that.* * *   A kink spring scooter is waiting for her on the far side of the dikes.The boy climbs on and waits for her to perch behind and then they are off through the city streets, weaving around megodonts and bicycles.Their little air horn blares.The city blurs past.Fish sellers, cloth merchants, amulet men with their Phra Seubs which Jaidee used to make so much fun of and which Kanya secretly keeps herself, close to her heart on a small chain."Currying favor with too many gods," Jaidee observed when she touched it before leaving the village.But she ignored his mockery and still whispered prayers to Phra Seub, hoping for protection that she knew she didn't deserve.The scooter slews to a stop and she hops down.The gold filigree of the City Pillar Shrine gleams in the dawn.All around, women sell marigolds for offerings.The chanting of monks carries over the whitewashed walls along with the music of khon dances.The boy is gone before she has a chance to thank him.Just another of the many who owe favors to Akkarat.Likely the scooter is a gift from the man, and loyalty the price of it."And what do you get, dear Kanya?"Jaidee asks."You know," Kanya mutters."I get what I swore I would get. ""And do you still desire it?"She doesn't answer him, steps over the barrier door to the shrine's interior.Even at dawn, the shrine is crowded with worshippers, people crouched before the Buddha statues and the shrine of Phra Seub, second only to the one at the Ministry.The grounds bustle with people making offerings of flowers and fruit, shaking out their fortunes with divining sticks and over it all, the monks chant, guarding the city with their prayers and amulets and the saisin that stretches from the shrine to the dikes and pumps.The sacred thread wavers in the gray light, held aloft on poles where it crosses thoroughfares, stretching miles from this blessed hub to the pumps and then circling the seawalls.The monks' chanting is a steady drone, keeping the City of Divine Beings safe from the swallowing waves.Kanya buys her own incense and food offering, takes it into the cool confines of the pillar shrine, down the marble steps.She kneels before the old city pillar of sacked Ayutthaya, and the larger one of Bangkok.The place where all miles are marked from.The heart of Krung Thep, and the home of the spirits that protect it.If she stands in the shrine's doorway and looks out toward the dikes, she can see the rise of the levees.It is obvious that they are in the depths of a bathtub.They are exposed on all sides.This shrine she lights her incense and pays her respects."Don't you feel like a hypocrite, coming here, of all places, at Trade's whim?""Shut up, Jaidee. "Jaidee kneels beside her."Well, at least you're giving some good fruit. ""Shut up. "She wants to pray, but with Jaidee bothering her, it's useless.After another minute, she gives up and goes back outside to the increasing morning light and heat.Narong is there, leaning against a post, watching the khon dances.The drums beat and the dancers go through their stylized turns, their voices raised high and stark, competing with the drone of the ranked monks across the courtyard.Kanya joins him.Narong holds up a hand."Wait until they're done. "She masters her irritation and finds a seat, watches as the story of Rama is played out.Finally Narong nods, satisfied."It's good, isn't it?"He tilts his head toward the pillar shrine."Have you made your offerings?""You care?"Other white shirts cluster in the compound, making their own offerings.Asking for promotions to better paying assignments.Asking for success in their investigations.Asking for protection from the diseases that they run up against every day.By its nature, this is a shrine for the Environment Ministry, almost as important as the temple of Phra Seub, the biodiversity martyr.It makes her nervous to speak with Narong in front of them all, but he appears entirely unconcerned."We all love the city," he says."Not even Akkarat will fail to defend it. "Kanya makes a face."What do you want from me?""So impatient.Let's walk. "She scowls.Narong seems unhurried, and yet he has summoned her as if it is an emergency.She tamps her fury and mutters, "Do you know what you've interrupted?""Tell me as we walk. ""I have a village with five dead and we still haven't isolated the cause. "He glances over, interested."A new cibiscosis?"He guides her out of the compound, past the marigold sellers.Walking onward."We don't know. "She masters her frustration."But you're delaying me from my work, and though it may please you to make me run like a dog when you call "  "We have a problem," Narong interrupts."And though you think your village is important, it is nothing in comparison to this.There has been a death.A very prominent one.We need your help in the investigation. "She laughs, "I'm not the police "  "It's not a police matter.There was a windup involved. "She stops short."A what?""The killer.We believe it is an invasive.A military windup.Heechy keechy. ""How is that possible?""It is something we also are trying to understand. "Narong looks at her seriously."And we cannot ask the question, because General Pracha has taken control of the investigation, claiming jurisdiction because the windup is an interdicted creature.As if it were a cheshire or a yellow card. "He laughs bitterly."We are blocked entirely.You will investigate on our behalf. ""That's difficult.It is not my investigation.Pracha will not "  "He trusts you. ""Trusting me to do my job and allowing me to meddle are two different things. "She shrugs and turns away."It's impossible. ""No!"Narong grabs her and yanks her back."This is vital!We must know the details!"Kanya whirls, throws Narong's hand off her shoulder."Why?What is so important about this?People die all over Bangkok, every day.We find bodies faster than we can shovel them into methane composters.What's so important about this one, that you'd have me cross the general?"Narong pulls her close."It's the Somdet Chaopraya.We have lost Her Royal Majesty's protector. "Kanya's knees buckle.Narong drags her upright, keeps talking, fiercely insistent."Politics has become uglier since I started in this game. "He has a smile on his face, but now Kanya sees the rage banked below."You're a good girl, Kanya.We have always held our part of the bargain.But this is why you are here.I know this is difficult.You have loyalty to your superiors in the Environment Ministry as well.You pray to Phra Seub.This is good.It is right for you.But we require your help.Even if you have no taste for Akkarat anymore, the palace requires it. ""What do you want?""We need to know if this was Pracha's doing.He has been quick to take over the investigation.We must know if it was he who drove the knife.Your patron and the safety of the palace depends on this.It is possible that Pracha wishes to hide something.It could be some of his December 12 elements striking against us. ""It's not possible "  "It is too convenient.We have been locked out entirely because it is a windup who did the killing. "Narong's voice cracks with a sudden intensity."We must know if the windup was planted by your ministry. "He passes her a bundle of cash.Kanya stares at the amount, shocked."Bribe anyone who gets in your way," he says.She shakes off her paralysis, takes the money and stuffs it into her pockets.He touches her gently."I am very sorry, Kanya.You're all I have.I depend on you to find our enemies and root them out. "* * *   The heat of a Ploenchit tower in the middle of the day is stifling.Investigators clog the dingy rooms of the club, adding to the swelter.It is a sick place to die.A place of hunger and desperation and appetites unfilled.Palace staffers crowd in the halls.Watching, conferring, preparing to collect the Somdet Chaopraya's body for placement in his funeral urn, waiting as Pracha's people investigate.Anxiety and anger hang in the air, politeness filed to an exquisite edge in this most humiliating and frightening moment.The rooms have the feeling of the monsoon just about to break, electric with energy, fraught with the unknown darkness of roiling clouds.The first body lies on the floor outside, an old farang, surreal and alien.There is little physical damage to him, except the bruising where his throat was crushed, the livid torture that was done to his windpipe.He sprawls beside the bar with the mottled look of a corpse raised from the river.Some gangster bit of fish bait.The old man stares at her with wide blue eyes, two dead seas.Kanya studies the damage without speaking, then allows General Pracha's secretary to lead her to the interior rooms.She gasps.Blood stains everything, great swirls of it spatter the walls and drool across the floors.Bodies lie in tangled heaps.And among them lies the Somdet Chaopraya, his throat not smashed as was the old farang, but literally torn out, as though a tiger has fed upon him.His bodyguards lie dead, one with a spring gun blade buried in his eye socket, the other still clutching his own spring gun but peppered with blades."Kot rai," Kanya murmurs.She hesitates, uncertain of what to do in the presence of this sordid death.Ivory beetles tangle in the bloody froth.They skitter and scatter through it all, making tracks in the coagulant.Pracha is in the room, conferring with his subordinates.He looks up at her gasp of dismay.The others have their own looks of shock, anxiety and embarrassment flickering on their faces.The thought that Pracha could arrange such a killing fills Kanya with sickness.The Somdet Chaopraya was no friend of the Environment Ministry, but the enormity of the act makes her ill.It is one thing to plot coups and counter coups, another to reach inside the palace.She feels like a bamboo leaf drowning in floodwater currents.So we all go, she tells herself.Even the richest and the most powerful are only meat for cheshires in the end.We are all nothing but walking corpses and to forget it is folly.Meditate on the nature of corpses and you will see this.And yet still she is unnerved, almost panicked by the sight of a near god's mortality before her.What have you done, General?It is too horrifying to consider.The flood currents threaten to suck her under."Kanya?"Pracha waves her over.She searches her general's face for signs that he carries the guilt for this act, but Pracha seems only puzzled."What are you doing here?""I " she has words prepared.Excuses.But they fail her with the Crown Protector and his retinue strewn about the room.Pracha's eyes follow her gaze to the Protector's body.His voice softens.He touches her gently on the arm."Come.This is too much. "Guides her out."I "  Pracha shakes his head."You've heard already. "He sighs."By the end of the day, it will be all over the city. "Kanya finds her voice, spills her lie, pretending to the role that Narong has given her."I didn't think it could be true. ""Worse than that. "Pracha shakes his head grimly."It was a windup that did it. "Kanya forces herself to show surprise.She glances back at the bloodshed."A windup?Just one?"Her eyes trace along a peppering of spring blades embedded in the walls.She recognizes one of the other bodies as a Trade Ministry official, the son of a secondary patriarch.Another from a Chaozhou manufacturing clan, a man making his way in the business press.All of them faces from the whisper sheets.All of them great tigers."It's awful. ""It doesn't seem possible, does it?Six bodyguards.Three men additionally.And only a single windup, if we believe the witnesses. "Pracha shakes his head."Even cibiscosis kills more cleanly. "His eminence the Somdet Chaopraya's neck has been ripped entirely away, breaking it, snapping and tearing so that though the spine seems attached still, it acts as a hinge rather than a support."It looks like a demon tore him open. ""A wild animal, anyway.It's the sort of thing a military genehack would do.We've seen this sort of activity in the north, where the Vietnamese operate.They use Japanese windups as scouts and shock troops.We're lucky they don't have many. "He looks seriously at Kanya."It will go hard on us.Trade will say that we failed in this.That we allowed this animal into the country.They'll try to take advantage.Make a pretext out of it to seize more power. "His expression turns bleak."We have to find out why this windup was here.If Akkarat has set us up, has used the Protector as a pawn, to seize power. ""He would never "  Pracha makes a face of dismissal."Politics is ugly.Never doubt what small men will do for great power.We think Akkarat was here before.Some of the staff seem to recognize his image, seem to recall " he shrugs."But of course, everyone is afraid.No one wants to admit too much.But it looks as if Akkarat and some of his farang trader friends brought the Somdet Chaopraya to the heechy keechy. "Is he playing me?Does he know that I work for Akkarat?Kanya stifles her fears.If he knew, he would never have promoted me to Jaidee's position.Jaidee whispers in her ear."You never know.A snake in its nest is better than a snake slithering through the jungle.This way, he always knows exactly where you are. ""I need you to go to the records department," Pracha says."We don't want information to conveniently disappear, you understand?Trade has its own agents amongst us.Pull everything you find and bring it to me.Find out how she lived here, and survived.As soon as word gets out, there will be a cover up.Men will lie.Permit records will disappear.Someone was allowing the windup to exist against all our laws.The Ministry is vulnerable on this.Someone took the bribes.Someone allowed the windup to live here.I want to know who, and I want to know if they are on Akkarat's payroll. ""Why me?"Pracha smiles sadly."Jaidee is the only one I would trust more. ""He's setting you up," Jaidee comments."If he wants to blame this on Trade, you're the perfect tool.The mole in the ministry. "There is no guile in Pracha's face, but he is a clever man.How much does he know?"Find the information for me," Pracha says."Bring it to me.And speak to no one of this. ""I will do it," she says.Inside though, she wonders if the records even exist anymore.So many ways to profit.A cover up would have already been effected.If it is truly a murder plot against the Protector, the payoffs would go to all levels.She shivers, wonders who would do such a thing.Political killings are one thing.To touch the palace in this way Rage and frustration threaten to overwhelm her.She forces it down."What do we know of the windup, so far?""She claimed to be a Japanese discard.The girls here say she has been in place for years. "Kanya makes a face of distaste."It's difficult to believe that anyone would soil ," she breaks off, finding herself on the verge of scorning the Somdet Chaopraya.Sick feelings of confusion and sadness overwhelm her.She masks her discomfort by asking another question."How did the Protector come to be here?""All we know is that he was accompanied by Akkarat's ilk. ""Will you question Akkarat?""If we could find him. ""He's missing?""You're surprised?Akkarat was always good at protecting himself.It's why he's managed to survive so many times. "Pracha grimaces."He might as well be a cheshire.Nothing ever touches him. "Pracha looks at her seriously."We must find who allowed this windup creature to live here so long.How it got into the city.How the assassination was arranged.We are blind in this, and when we are blind, we are vulnerable.This news will make everything unstable. "Kanya wais."I will do everything I can. "Even if Jaidee peers over her shoulder and laughs at her."I may need more information than this.To track down those responsible. ""You have enough to start.Find where this windup came from.Who took the bribes.This is what I must know. ""And Akkarat and these farang who introduced the windup to the Protector?"Pracha smiles slightly."I will attend to it. ""But "  "Kanya, it is understandable that you wish to do more.We all care for the well being of the palace and the Kingdom.But we must secure and protect the information we have about this windup creature. "Kanya controls her response."Yes.Of course.I will locate the information on the bribes. "She pauses delicately."Will someone be required to demonstrate their regrets as well?"Pracha makes a face."A little harmless bribe income is one thing.It is not a rich year for the Ministry.But this?"He shakes his head."I remember when we were respected," Kanya murmurs.Pracha glances at her."Do you?I thought that had ended by the time you came to us. "He sighs."Don't worry.This will not be a cover up.Atonements will be made.I will ensure it personally.Do not doubt my commitment to the Kingdom or Her Royal Majesty the Queen.The guilty will be punished. "Kanya studies the Protector's body and the dingy room where he met his end.A windup.A whore and a windup.She tries to contain her sickness at the thought.A windup.That someone would try to she shakes his head.An ugly affair.A destabilizing move.And now some young men will have to pay for it.Whoever took the bribes in Ploenchit, perhaps others.On the street, Kanya flags down a cycle rickshaw.
