She couldn't figure how to pass on the rest diplomatically: as long as you don't blast my daughter again .   "I understand, Miri.I'll be good. ""Well.Okay. "Miri looked around."I, um, I guess that's all I had to say.I'll let you get on with whatever you're doing.Good luck with finals. "She swung back on her bike and pedaled industriously away.That old bike had only three speeds.Robert shook his head, but he couldn't help smiling.20    The Officer of the Watch  Robert's finals were over.He had earned a 2.6 average, and a B in Search and Analysis.He had worked harder than he ever had in his life.If it weren't for the imminent irrelevance of it all, he would have been proud of himself.Now it was Monday afternoon and Robert was counting the hours, almost down to counting the minutes.The Mysterious Stranger had been very scarce lately.The cabal had met a couple of times, with Tommie doling out information on a need to know basis.Tommie had read too many spy novels.For now, all Robert knew was that they were meeting at the library at 5:30 tonight.Meantime, somewhere under Camp Pendleton  In theory, being officer of the watch for Continental U. S.  Southwest was no different than running a snoop and swoop operation anywhere in the world.In theory, there could be world wrecking conspirators at work here.In fact, this was home, in some of the best connected real estate in the world.The chances they'd have to swoop were near zero.Nevertheless, for the next four hours Lieutenant Colonel Robert Gu, Jr., would be responsible for protecting about one hundred million of his neighbors from mass destruction.Gu arrived twenty minutes early, checked in with the current officer of the watch, and then looked for DHS screwups.Those were usually the worst thing about CONUS watches.Through the miracle of virtual bureaucracy, Gu's Marine Expeditionary Group was tonight a part of the Department of Homeland Security.This was how DHS kept its budget so, ahem, small."Like a modern corporation, DHS seamlessly meshes with whatever organizations are needed at the moment. "That was the hype.And tonight  well glory be  there was not a single authorization glitch in sight.Bob walked around the bunker, transformed the green plastic walls into windows on the Southern California night.The air filled with abstractions, the status of his people and his equipment, the reorganization of his share of the analyst pool.He grabbed some coffee from the machine by the door and settled down at a very ordinary desk just a few feet from the launch area."Patrick?"His second in command appeared across the table."Sir?""Who all have we got tonight?"An unnecessary question, but Patrick Westin produced the official list.The Marine Expeditionary Group consisted of four twelve marine maneuver teams.Call them squads; everyone else did.Back in the twentieth century, Bob's "command" would have rated a second lieutenant.On the other hand, the MEG controlled thousands of vehicles (though most were the size of model airplanes) and enough firepower to finish almost any war in history.Most important to Bob Gu: Everyone in his group had been through combat training as tough as any in the past.They were marines.Patrick called them all in for a short meeting.The room stretched back from around Bob's desk and for a few moments pretended to be an auditorium.Everyone looked cool; it had been a long time since anything had gone Really Wrong within CONUS.And were a big part of the reason why ."We'll be here four hours," said Bob."Hopefully, the time will be a very boring snoop.As long as that's the case, you're free to stay in staff areas adjacent to your vehicles.But most of you have been on my watch before.You know I want you to keep your eyes open.Keep up with the analysts. "He waved at the analyst pool.For a CONUS Southwest watch, this amounted to about fifteen hundred dedicated specialists, but with connections leading down to hundreds of thousands of services and millions of embedded processors.Tonight, Alice was in charge of the pool, and already the changes were evident, the three dimensional rat's nest transformed with a clarity rarely seen outside of managers' dreams.Aside from her marvelous reorganization, the display was completely conventional.Between the humans who had clearance and could communicate directly there were hundreds of color coded associational threads.The mass of the lower levels was constantly aflicker, weights and assessments and connections shifting from second to second.Bob pointed at the reddish threat wackos that were always part of the mix."What have we got to worry about for the next four hours?"The analysts behind the red nodes spewed out their consensus list and supporting pointers.But even the paranoids didn't have much to say tonight:   Action issues  Possible Anti Librareome protest at UCSD  Belief circle riot a near certainty  Possible organized participants  Jerzy Hacek belief circle  CIA assessment of Indo European connection  Scooch a mout belief circle  CIA assessment of Central African connection  CIA assessment of Sub Saharan connection  CIA assessment of Paraguay connection  RIAA report to Congress  Commercial entities  Possible threats to infrastructure  Proximity to Critical National Security Sites  General Genomics  Huertas International  Increased illegal computation imports  Orange County  Los Angeles County  Off scale low probability estimate linking preceding items  Law enforcement issues  FBI vice raid at Las Vegas Splendor Farm, a near certain event  Possible request for intelligence support  DEA enhancement drug raids in Kern County  Possible request for intelligence support  Possible out of area activity  Pacific Islander settlements in Alberta  Persons of Interest  Arizona  California  San Diego County  Increased short term South Asian visitors  Others   Nevada  Recusal advisements   Bob let the list hang for a moment."Ha," said one of the gunnies."At least the policias won't be a problem. "Denying the law enforcement requests should be easy tonight, not like for kidnapping or murder prevention.A tech sergeant flickered highlights across the UCSD event cluster."This is what will keep us busy. "Her light paused, expanding on definitions."What?This is a fight between belief circles?I never heard of such a thing. "One of the youngest marines laughed."You're just getting old, Nancy.Cross belief strife is tragic new. "Bob didn't try to parse the slang, but he'd heard enough from Dad and Miri to get the point.He expanded the description of the expected riot."It looks like a combination of twentieth century protest and modern gaming.It should be as safe as most public events.The problem is the location. "There was so much bio lab work near UCSD that any instability was a concern."This is worth a lot of your attention.Note the stats on foreign interest. "He moved on to the links in Persons of Interest.As usual, those expanded into the tens of thousands.At one point or another almost everyone  unless they were dead, in which case they might still count for bioterror paranoia  came under scrutiny."I'm not going to ask you to dredge through the Pol or this watch will last all year.But follow what the spooks throw up at you  and watch for real time changes. "That last was classic wisdom, proven in dozens of disasters and disasters avoided so far this century.The analysts always had a million suspicions, but when they hit the hard cold world of real time, success depended on whether the operational folks had been paying attention.And then there was the item that stood a little down from all the others: Recusal Advisements, that is, team members who might somehow compromise this watch.Normally, that was the most paranoid list of all  but his crew would see no cloud of detail here, not even links.Such advice was Eyes Only for himself and his backups.In practice, if there had been any serious problems there, they would have been taken care of well before this briefing."Questions?"He looked around.There was a moment of silence, marines drinking in the details of the moment, answering a lot of questions for themselves.Then the young slang slinger spoke up."Sir, the equipment, is it the same as for a technical threat overseas mission?"Bob looked back into the young eyes."The boost gear is lighter than usual That's the only difference, Corporal.We're here to protect, but ultimately that means to protect the whole country. "The whole world, some would say ."So, yes, we're carrying a full strategic load. "He leaned back and gave a look that included all his marines."I don't expect any problems.If we pay attention and do our jobs, this will be just another peaceful evening for the people of California. "He dismissed the crew, and the room shrank to its true dimensions.Patrick Westin had a few follow up questions about squad deployment, and then his image departed, too.Bob Gu turned down his augmentation and for a brief moment there was just his table and chair, sitting by the coffee machine.On his right was the doorway that led to real hardware.With luck, he wouldn't see any of that tonight.Bob  > Alice: <sm>Are you cool?</sm>  Alice  > Bob: <sm>Cool and clear.The UCSD thing will be good practice for my lab audit.Talk to you after.</sm> That is, after the watch was complete.Tonight Alice was top analyst; if she weren't currently Trained for the audit, she might have been the operational commander.She was one of only a handful of people qualified for both jobs.In either role, she was a joy to work with  as long as he didn't have to think about the sacrifices that made her performance possible.He finished his coffee and brought back his visuals, now fully customized.He checked again with Cheryl Grant.She was ready to go.Okay, for the record:  Gu  > Grant: <sm>I take the watch, ma'am.</sm> He and Grant exchanged salutes.The clock was started.His squads settled into total alertness.They would have to stay that way for four hours  not a long time, but about the longest you could remain watch alert without drugs.Bob's job was different.He was like a sheepdog running around the outside of the flock, skittering from topic to topic.He watched where marines and analysts were spending their time.This was partly to stay ahead of hot spots, partly to detect attentional holes.For a moment, he looked down from a popular press viewpoint over UCSD.This event was going to involve a lot of demonstrators, many of them physically present.And network stats showed that a flash crowd situation was possible on top of that.He wondered if Miri was surfing this.The thought brought him back to the moment.He looked again at the Recusal Advisements.Half of his marines had relatives enrolled at UCSD.That was the big problem with a local snoop.Three of his people were actually part time students at UCSD.The slang slinger had a hobby of Scoochi decoration that involved a number of Bangalore fans.If this hadn't been the kid's duty night, he'd be down there on campus right now.But the analysts had done a minute by minute on the young fellow, going back fourteen months.There were some illegalities, some enhancement drug abuse, but nothing that would affect the mission.Bob had searched the entire recusal tree.Now he ran off its pointers, boring deep.Dad didn't show up.And I was sure he'd be mixed up in the Librareome thing .Not that that would be serious grounds for recusal.He was skittering too far afield, a common problem for commanders with latitude   Xiu Xiang ?The name was vaguely familiar, but it wouldn't have popped out at him if his own name hadn't been in the item.Xiang was one of about three hundred thousand people in CONUS Southwest who were currently of interest for tinkering with hardware.Much of that was illegal, of course; such people could be thrown to the FBI.But it was more productive simply to track them.Most of these people were benign hobbyists or intellectual property cheats.Some were the hands for terrorist cults.And some were the analyst smarts behind those cults.Xiang had the intelligence and training to be in this last category, but so far the most interesting thing about her was the range of toys she had built, a regular museum of oddball electronics.And she was in one of Dad's classes.That connection was marked "tenuous. "But there was also a reference to Rainbows End Rest Home This woman was Mom's roomie!And all this time he'd worried about how dull life must be for Mom nowadays.What a team: the mad scientist and his mother the shrink and  Whafs this ?Weeks of do it yourself snooping that Miri and Mom and this Xiang had run on Dad.A dozen surmises rose to mind, and  Mission, mission, keep your eyes on the mission .He resolutely pushed all the personal issues aside.The main thing this proved was the stupidity of running watches with local personnel.Bob grabbed another coffee and settled back to watch the views of UCSD and the night's other hot spots.In the modern military, losing concentration was much the same sin as falling asleep on duty.It was time to get in the groove.And still, a tiny internal voice did its best to distract: What in heaven's name have Miri and Mom been up to ?Monday, 5:00 p. m.  Finally .Twilight was still colorful in the sky over La Jolla Shores when Robert drove into the traffic loop north of Warschawski Hall.He headed east on foot, toward the Geisel Library."Ready for the big night, my man?"That was the Stranger Sharif, walking beside him.Passersby didn't seem to see his green faced companion.Robert gave the Stranger a sour look."I'm ready to see you deliver. ""Don't worry.If we succeed tonight, you'll have your peculiar genius fully back, my word on it. "Robert grunted.Not for the first time he speculated on the lunacy of the terminally desperate."And don't look so discouraged, Professor.You've already done your hardest part.Tonight it's mainly Tommie Parker who has to get things straight. ""Tommie?I wonder. ""You wonder?"The Stranger's smile broadened."So you've identified Tommie's 'miracle design bureau'?Poor Tommie.He's the only one of you who thinks he's running free.In fact, he thinks I'm just one of his best collaborators.See, I can be nice when that's absolutely necessary. "There were as many people here as Robert had ever seen on a campus evening in his grad school days.Up ahead, in the direction of the library, light hung in the sky, brighter than the twilight behind them.Looking down from the tops of the eucalyptus trees, Robert could see crowds along the esplanades south and east of the library.There seemed to be several groups, not mixing."What's going on?"That must be the distraction Tommie had promised; it was far larger than Winnie's Librareome demonstration."Heh.I've planned extraordinary festivities around the library tonight; almost everybody's invited, especially staff from General Genomics labs.But not you.I suggest we detour around the library. ""But that was the rendezvous point  "  "It's already too busy.We'll head for Pilchner Hall direct.This way, please. "The Stranger pointed to the right, into dark eucalyptus trees.Meantime, in the GenGen labs  Sheila Hanson popped up half an hour into the night shift."You ready, Tim?"Tim Huynh sat back from his desk, and gestured up his little helpers."We're ready, boss. "He stepped into the corridor and followed Hanson's come hither arrows up the stairs.She and the rest of her lab techs were already gathered round the surface entrance.Four or five were recent graduates.The rest  like Timothy Huynh himself  were work study students."You're sure this isn't going to lose us our jobs?"Belief circle gaming was all very well outside of work, but Huynh would never have considered this adventure if his own supervisor hadn't suggested it.Hanson laughed."I told you.GenGen regards this battle as a form of public service.Besides, it will embarrass Huertas International. "Her glance took in all of them, GenGen's entire night crew except for regulomics.Sheila's explanation was enough for Tim.Once upon a time, he had really looked forward to working at GenGen.How many people got to see  in person  the lab equipment that their college majors were built upon?But more often than not, his job came down to unwedging overenthusiastic cleaning robots, and hauling non prepped cargo.Yes, sometimes there were real problems, problems where you got to consult with users and help customize their experiment setup.But then you spent days devising automation so that wouldn't happen again.Not one of the crew members, even the ones who weren't Scooch a moutis, looked unhappy about tonight's little diversion."Okay, everybody," said Sheila, "let's see you look properly formed. "They slipped into their Scoochi characters.There were pofu longs and dwelbs, and a great big shima ping.The shima ping was Sheila.She glanced at Huynh."You can't be the Scooch a mout, Tim.That's reserved. ""But I'm commanding the critters. "He waved at the helper bots that had followed him up the stairs."You're guiding them, Tim.You can be a Lesser Scooch a mout. ""Okay. "He shifted form.These were all world class designs, not seen before tonight.He doubted very much that any of them would remain reserved for long, but if Sheila wanted to play the beliefs strictly, he wasn't going to be the one to break the circle.They trooped out the doors, into the evening twilight.There was still color in the tops of the eucalyptus.South, across the ravines, their goal was a vast double pyramid, glassy faceted on top, dark and be vined below.And that was the real, naked eye view!The Geisel Library.As they moved along, Sheila and others were fitting their vision over the world.This hadn't been rehearsed.It was designed as a surprise for the Hacekeans, but even more as a surprise for the world that would soon be coming down to watch.One by one, the eucs made little popping noises and suddenly were transformed into moonflower trees, their leaves fluorescent in the twilight."We have been noticed," someone said."Of course.We're all over.There are s'nice and got a runs coming from the Lit Building. ""There's fweks and liba loos flying from our basement at the library!"And every appearance sent a tiny fraction of a penny winging back up the Scoochi tree of creation.For once, Tim didn't mind the rip off.The Scooch a mout affiliance was as broad as any.Even hardware illegals at the edge of the world would benefit from the royalties.Hanson  > Night Crew; <sm>Keep our gear out of sight, long as you can.</sm> The real view from local cams would show that some of the Scoochi images wrapped real critters.So for the moment, Sheila wanted all the privacy she could get on that.What the Hacekeans learned would have to come from public viewpoints and their own naked eyes.Huynh let Rick Smale and the others handle that.He concentrated on running the critters: all the lab bots with enough range and flexibility to walk to the library.These gadgets did routine cleaning and module swapouts.They weren't designed for running around in the wild out of doors.But GenGen had cleared them to go, and Timothy Huynh was having a ball.First, he laid down a consensus for the robots' appearance.There were queeps and chirps, spitting and shooting in all directions.In reality, these were his four hundred mobile manipulators  known as "tweezer bots" in the business.They were barely fast enough to keep up with the humans.But he also had mapped megamunches and xoroshows and salsipueds  these onto his cleaner bots and sample carriers.Behind them lurked the two largest mechs in Huynh's lab, combination forklifts and heavy equipment installers; for now, they were tricked out as gray masted blue ionipods.He had supplied the physical specs two weeks ago, when the prospect of this adventure had first floated around the labs.The resulting visual designs were spectacular, and meshed with the reality of the underlying robots and the touchy feely gear that Huynh had attached to the bots' hulls.If you patted the xoroshow on its haunches, you'd feel muscle sliding lithely under silky fur, just what your eyes were telling you.As long as they were confronted by only a few pairs of human hands, the haptics were fast enough to maintain the illusion.They were better than anything he'd ever touched on Pyramid Hill.Of course, the remote audience would benefit very little from that, but it would boost the morale of the Scoochis here in person, and undermine their opposite numbers among the Hacekeans.And that enemy was already forming up.Five Knights Guardian stood on the library's east terrace, and a Librarian lurked by the Snake Path."That's all they have?""So far," said Sheila the shima ping."I'm just hoping we aren't too fragmented. ""Yeah. "That was the virtue and the weakness of the Scoochi worldview.Scooch a mout was distributed in bits and pieces.It was customized to the wishes of children, not just in the Great Powers, but also in the failed states at the edge of the world.The Scoochis had so many different creations.The Hacekeans had the notion of knowledge conquering outward, a vision that claimed consistency over everything.And just now that fit their near total control of the library.The shima ping bounced up and down on its three feet.Sheila was shouting at the enemy with what must have been an external speaker, since Huynh could feel the loudness all over."Get out of our way!""We want our floor space!""We want our Library!""And most of all, we want our REAL books!"That last demand made for a good chant, even if it didn't quite fit with Scoochi's edge of the world background.Sheila's gang raced forward with the battle cries.But now dozens of Hacekeans joined the five Knights Guardian.Surely most were virtual, but the blending was perfection.No surprise; both sides knew this was coming.This was a collision of belief circles.The point was to convince the wider world by belief and images that Scooch a mout's was the greater vision.Both sides thought they knew what was coming.In fact, Tim's had something special planned:  The Hacekeans roared their threats at the Scoochi army, at the chirps and queeps, and the larger, vaguely seen things that lumbered along behind them.They thought it was all clever imagery and human players.Then the first of the gray masted blue ionipods crunched onto asphalt, and the Hacek people realized that the sound it made was real .At the same time one of the salsipueds  a sample carrier  raced out and bit a Knight on the ankle.It was just a small electric shock really, but the Hacekeans recoiled, wailing, "Cheaters!Cheaters!"And it was cheating, really, but Huynh saw from the network stats that support for his side had doubled.Besides, we're doing it for a good cause .Timothy Huynh never used the physical library that much, but what had happened there rankled.The terrace was clear for the moment, but Sheila hesitated.Hanson  > Night Crew: <sm>I don't like the straight run in.I think they have something planned.</sm>  "Yes!See!"Smale shouted aloud, and pointed them to views from above the library's entrance.Those cams showed spiderlike somethings guarding the final approach to the library doors.The creatures were so thick they almost hid the stone mosaic.Then the views went offline."Jeez, were those critters real?"" I think some of them were," said Sheila."Can't be.Even Electrical Engineering doesn't have that many robots.In this contest, we are the ones with mechanical superiority!"But what if the enemy had bought a mob of hobby bots?If even half of those mechs were real   Sheila paused, listening to advice that might be coming from anywhere on earth.Then she roared, "Into the trees!"They gave a ragged shout.What came out of the synthetics was an answering roar, loud and baroque and totally Scoochi.They pounded off into the bushes southeast of the library.Virtual imagery faded into an artful blur that disguised the patchy network coverage.The smaller mechs, the cleaners and sample carriers and tweezer bots, had little trouble with the mulchy ground cover.It was the forklifts that were the problem.They sank into the softness.Huynh ran around them, giving a push here and moving a stone there.The monsters slowly shuffled forward.It was not so different from some of the work he had to do down in the lab.But now was the time for some out of band complaining:  Huynh  > Hanson: <sm>This doesn't help, Sheila.The spider bots will just follow us here.</sm>  Hanson  > Huynh: <sm>Bear with me.This detour will work.Watch what I</sm>  A little yip of surprise came from Sheila's lips, and her sentence hung uncompleted.The virtual Scoochis blundered on for a pace or two, depending on their various latencies, but the GenGen night crew stumbled to an abrupt stop.Everybody milled around for a moment, images coalescing as they threaded routes out of the thicket.But that was not the reason for the sudden stop.They were all staring at  a man and a rabbit.The first real, the second virtual.The two weren't exactly hiding; they were standing in a clearing.But there was brush all around, and until the Scoochis came stumbling in, there had been no camera viewpoint on this spot.The rabbit was nothing special, a toonish chimera.It had a nicely impudent leer, you had to give it that.Sheila the shima ping hesitated a second, then took a couple of threatening steps toward the rabbit."You're out of place. "The critter took a chomp out of its carrot and waggled an ear."What's it to ya, Doc?""I'm not a doctor  yet," said the shima ping.The rabbit laughed."In your dreams, then.I'm here to remind you that it's not just you and Hacek in collision tonight.There are other, greater powers at work. "It wailed the last words and swept a carrot clutching white furred paw at the sky.Huynh  > Night Crew: <sm>C'mon, Sheila, there are always bystanders.</sm>  Smale  > Night Crew: <sm>Stopping here just dilutes our reputation.</sm>  But Sheila ignored the objections.She sidled around the impudent rabbit and stepped close to the physically present human.That guy looked aggressively normal: in his fifties, maybe Hispanic, dressed in dark work clothes.He was the perfect picture of UCSD faculty, though a bit overdressed.He was wearing, but very low key, not even showing courtesy info.His eyes followed the shima ping with a sure calmness that  now that Huynh noticed  was a little unnerving.Then Huynh saw what Sheila was seeing.The stranger was projecting imagery.It was a subtle thing, the sort of far lavender shades that you almost can't see.They were a mist that drifted up from the stranger's shoes and seemed even brighter as they flowed into the trees.Hanson  > Night Crew: <sm>Switch to utility view.</sm>  GenGen's utility diagnostics were tricky to use outside of a lab, but they were much more sophisticated than what came with Epiphany outfits.In the utility view you could see that this guy was heavily equipped.The lavender hinted at that, but now Huynh could see the scintillation of the high rate laser links coming from the guy's clothes.Without the lavender clue, they might never have noticed.Sometimes the highest form of showmanship is to pretend at unsuccessfully pretending to be innocuous.Smale > Night Crew: <sm>Hey!This guy  he's hooked into the Bollywood people here on campus.</sm>  They stared at each other with joyous surmise.This must be a genuine Bollywood mogul.Belief circles were the fuel that sustained the movie industry.Hanson  > Night Crew: <sm>I told you, battling the Hacekeans would mean big recognition.</sm>  Booting Hacekean ass out of the library was more important than ever."Onward!"shouted Hanson, now out loud and across all the world."Down with Hacek!Down with the Librareome Menace!"The virtuals and almost all the night crew continued on through the forest.Huynh stayed behind a few seconds, making sure that no queep or chirp was stuck in the leaves, making sure that the forklifts had enough space between the trees.And then they were all pounding along again."We want our floor space!""We want our library!""And most of all, we want our REAL books!"Huynh did not expect that the spider bots would be caught by surprise.What did Sheila have up her shima ping sleeve?21    When Belief Circles Collide  Alfred Vaz watched the departing crazies.Beside him, Rabbit swayed in time to their battle cries.For once, the critter seemed impressed by someone other than itself.Or maybe not."Heh," it said, giving a little carroty salute."I can't wait to see their faces when they discover who's fighting for the other side. "Vaz looked down at the furry ears."Turn off your public presence. "The goal was to not attract attention."You worry too much. "But the rabbit took a last chomp and tossed the carrot green aside.This one vanished before it hit the ground."Okay, Doc.I'm for your eyes only.What next?"Vaz grunted and started off toward the south.In fact, he was more irritated than worried by Rabbit's impudence.If things went properly tonight, the Americans would not connect the operation with Rabbit, much less with the Indo European Alliance.If the Americans started seriously looking, they would quickly pick out Alfred's role here  whether or not he and Rabbit were actually seen together.Keiko's people had worked out an elaborate decision program  a "contingency tree"  that described just what could still be denied and what could still be achieved in the face of various glitches.Twenty years ago, Alfred would have laughed at such automated planning, but no more.His secret analyst teams had developed his own contingency tree.It grew out from Keiko's, reaching all the way to ultimate worst cases  such as the unmasking of his YGBM project.Alfred emerged from the densest part of the eucalyptus grove.All around him, his tiny bots unobtrusively kept pace.Every one was in violation of local law, containing not a single chip in thrall to the U. S.  Department of Homeland Security.While Vaz continued to play Bollywood exec through the public net, these devices provided him with his own network and countermeasures.There were places in the contingency tree where they could be very useful.Meantime, a tiny stealthed aerobot followed along above, accepting his local network's traffic and flickering it at a thousand points in the westward sky.The energy in any pulse would be undetectable except to someone very alert and very close by, but the ensemble  correlated with the right time synch  should be visible to Keiko's antenna array out over the Pacific.It was their very own military net.That was the theory.In fact, Alfred had been out of touch for nearly three minutes.He knew Alice Gong was on watch tonight, probably as an analyst.He had launched his attack on her just before he lost milnet access.Very soon her surveillance duties would bring her to a lab file containing an innocuous moire pattern  only the pattern would not be innocuous for her.Has that happened yet ?Maybe he should snoop it out via the public net."Come on, Doc, come ona come on. "Rabbit danced a little jig.Its voice had a mocking lilt that Alfred had first heard some eighty years earlier."Is there some kinda problem?""No problem," said Vaz."Are your agents in place?""Never fear.All but Rivera and Gu are at the start point.I'm guiding them around the riot even as we speak.But if you want to snoop the fiber, you better hurry up. "The ground was firm and level.There was a surfaced path.Now their speed was limited by how fast his mechs could make their stealthy way.There were crowds here, but almost everyone was walking toward the library.He caught a glimpse of Rivera and Gu.And, once, he saw two children on bicycles.Where did that fit with Hacekeans and Scoochis?He would have put the question to his analyst pool  if only he had his milnet link.The Mysterious Stranger hustled Robert off the surface path, down past where administration bungalows used to be.Robert kept a virtual light on the rough ground.The view was up to the second and clearer than a flashlight might have given him, but keeping up with the Stranger didn't leave time to ghost around the library."Those are real lights back there," he said."Even more than before.What  ?""The Hacek people got a little too enthusiastic.They've destroyed some camera infrastructure.They need real light. "He was chuckling."Don't worry.No one will be hurt, and it's a diversion that will be useful. "The Stranger slowed.Robert looked away from the ground for a moment.Over the hill, he got a look  from a point high in the trees  at the people on the ground.In true view, they were students shouting at each other, a few involved in real scuffles.But shift a little away from strict reality, and the imagery became what one group or another wanted you to see.There were Hacek Knights and Librarians tussling with fluffy, colorful critters that might have been big eyed mammals or  "Ah!So it's the Scooch a mout fans going after the Hacekeans?""Mostly. "The Stranger seemed to be listening for something.Somebody was coming down the hill on an intercept course.A Librarian Militant.Carlos Rivera.The chubby librarian nodded at Stranger Sharif and Robert."What a mess. ""But a useful mess," said the Stranger."Yeah. "Carlos dropped his costume: the Librarian's hat reverted to an everyday baseball cap worn backwards, and now his plate armor was just Bermuda shorts and the Rivera standard T shirt."I just hope this fighting doesn't become a tradition. "The Mysterious Stranger waved them on through the brush."A tradition?"he said."But that would be a plus.Like panty raids and putting automobiles on top of administration buildings.The sort of thing that made American universities great. "Rivera puffed along."Maybe.We've had a lot more business since the library went virtual, but  "  Robert was still watching the mobs beyond the hill."I thought the whole point of belief circles was that they can coexist in the same space. ""In principle," said Rivera.They took a big detour around a space that was dark even in the virtual.Sharif's image seemed to flicker and jerk.So few people walked through this area that the random network was sparse and your wearable had to make way too many guesses."But," Rivera continued, "the library is a tight fit.In principle we can morph to support the multiple beliefs, like on Pyramid Hill.In fact, our environment is often too close for conflicting haptics.So the administration tried to satisfy the Scoochis by giving them some space underground. "Rivera paused, and Robert almost ran him over."You knew that wouldn't work, didn't you?"Carlos was looking at Stranger Sharif, or what Robert saw as Stranger Sharif.The Stranger turned and smiled."I gave you the best advice I had, dear boy. ""Yeah. "Rivera sounded close to surly.He looked over his shoulder at Robert."What does he have on you, Professor?""I   "  "Ah, ah, ah!"interrupted the Stranger."I think we'd all be more comfortable without such revelations. ""Okay," said both victims."In any case," said the Stranger, "I'm rather proud of how I've morphed the Librareome controversy into this conflict between belief circles.This riot will distract people who would otherwise be paying attention to other things  such as what we're doing. "They were well south of the library now, out of the trees and coming down a steep slope.Just ahead was Gilman Drive.Carlos walked heedlessly into the street.The cars slowed or speeded up or changed lanes so there was always a wide bubble of empty space around him.Robert hesitated, looking for a crosswalk.Damn .Finally he scooted after Carlos, out into traffic.Miri stopped ON the north side of Gilman Drive."So where are they going?"said Juan."They're coming down to Gilman Drive. "Viewpoints in the eucalyptus showed Robert and the librarian, Carlos Rivera, walking through deep brush.The pictures were fragmentary, since there weren't many cameras there, but Miri was sure no one was pulling a swap on her.The two would reach the roadway in a couple of minutes."But that's true of anyone coming south. "Miri stopped her bike, put a foot on the ground."Look!You want me to say I don't know where they're going, is that it?"The Orozco kid stopped his wikiBay bike beside her."Honest, I'm just wondering. "Xiu Xiang popped into existence, and a moment later, so did a young version of Lena Gu.Their images were Barbie doll stiff, but every day they got better.For instance, Lena had mastered facial expressions  and right now her look was stern."Juan isn't the only one with this question, young lady.If you don't know , you should say so. "Xiu just sounded anxious."Lena and I are driving around the north side of campus.Maybe my research was all wrong.How can we help if the action is on the south?"Miri struggled to make her own voice serene."I think you got it right, Dr.Xiang.Juan and I have been following Robert closely, but now I guess I don't know where he's going.That makes it even more important that we stay spread out.Please Dr.Xiang, if you and Lena can stay on the north side, that would be best. "Over the last few days, Xiu had done some good detective work; she could be really smart when she wasn't doubting herself.They knew that Huertas kept the Librareome shredda in his labs on the north side.If Robert's friends planned a "direct protest," that would be the sensible place for them to break in.So why aren't Robert and the others heading that way ?Big boogers of uncertainty were beginning to form.But Dr.Xiang nodded, and not even Juan Orozco asked the obvious embarrassing questions.This was still the Miri Gang.For better or worse.The treetop cams had lost sight of Robert and Mr.Rivera.Miri dropped those viewpoints and glanced up the hillside, almost with a naked eye perspective.The other two were still out of sight.They could come out on Gilman Drive almost anywhere.Miri licked her lips."The main thing is to keep these  "  "  crazy fools  " said Lena.   "from doing anything too destructive. ""Yeah," said Juan, nodding."Who do you think that remote guy is, the one who's walking with them?""What?"Juan was a mostly clueless kid, but sometimes he was accidentally very sharp.Miri played back her last images of Robert and Mr.Rivera.Those pics were fragmentary, but Juan was right.The two were looking at a consistent location that drifted along with them  and granting it a certain amount of open space.So.A private presence.Juan said, "I'll bet they're seeing Zulfi Sharif. ""I'll bet you're right. "Not for the first time tonight, she tried to bring up her Sharif control.Still no response.So do something !"C'mon, Juan. "She walked her bike out onto Gilman Drive, crossing the lanes slowly enough not to get a ticket.Xiu and Lena drifted along."Traffic is heavy," said Lena."It's the belief circles clash.People are attending in person. "The gaming buzz had come out of the blue, but Miri could not imagine that it was coincidence.Setting this up must have involved deep coordination.Even though the clash was still just rumor, there was a huge turnout.The cars around them were dropping off passengers.People were laughing and shouting and talking, and walking toward the library.The sidewalks on the other side of Gilman Drive were all but empty.She reached the far curb and looked back."Come on , Juan!"Now the sky above the library was twisting violet, a very nice fractal effect from some art co op in northern China.She glanced at network status It wasn't just automobile traffic that was heavy.She could see network trunks lighting up all over California.There were millions of viewpoints being exported from UCSD's campus.There were hundreds of thousands of virtual participants.As Juan caught up with her, she said, "It's a whirlwind.Like a big game first day. "The boy nodded, but he wasn't paying attention."Look what I found in the street. "The gadget was half crushed.Metal fibers hung from one side.She waved for him to drop it."Roadkill.So?"If a node lost connectivity and then got into the street  well, something that small would get run over."I think it's still online, but I can't get a catalog match. "Miri looked closer.There was spiky flickering, but no response."It's pingless wreckage, Juan. "Juan shrugged, then dropped the gadget into his bike bag.He had a blank look.He was still searching."It looks like a Cisco 33, but  "  Fortunately, Orozco had not distracted everyone.Lena said, "Miri.I've found Robert and the Rivera fellow. "There was a pause while Lena got the camera ID.There!Robert and Rivera were crossing the roadway a quarter mile west of them."We're on it, Lena!"In Robert's time, this side of Gilman Drive had been Quonset huts.In later years, classic University of California concrete had housed the medical school.Now there was Pilchner Hall, which like almost everything else on campus looked as temporary as the old Quonsets.The Mysterious Stranger led Robert and Carlos into the building.Real light followed them in concentrated pools, while farther down the hall the view was virtual.There might have been other people in the building, but the Stranger avoided them.He headed down a stairway, into a warren of tiny rooms.In places the floor was dusty.Elsewhere it was polished clean, or covered with streaky scrape marks."Heh," said the Stranger, pointing at the scrapes."Tommie has been at work.This whole floor has been rearranged for tonight.And there are parts that just won't show on the university's security plan. "Their path was now a trek through the maze.Finally, the Mysterious Stranger stopped at a closed door.He paused and spoke soberly."As you may know, Professor Parker is not fully on board.For the sake of your various goals, I suggest you be careful not to enlighten him. "Robert and Carlos nodded.The Mysterious Stranger turned and mimed knocking on the plastic door.His hand sounded like a hammer pounding heavy wood.After a moment, the door opened and Winston Blount peered out."Hello, Carlos. "His gaze passed less favorably over Robert and the Stranger.He waved them in.The room was a triangular wedge trapped between slanting walls.A concrete caisson took up most of the floor space.Tommie Parker sat on the floor beside a handcart that was filled with plastic bags and backpacks."Hiya, guys.You're right on time. "He glanced at his laptop."You'll be pleased to know that press and police did not notice your arrival.At the moment we're standing in a room that doesn't even exist.This  " he slapped the caisson "  is still visible to the university, but it will happily lie about what we're doing. "Robert edged round the blocky structure."I remember this. "In the 1970s, the caisson had been out of doors, covered with a wooden lid.He looked over the edge.Yes, just as before: iron ladder rungs marched downward into darkness.Tommie stood up.He had his laptop in a sling that left the keyboard and display accessible, but also freed him to move about.In his own way, Tommie Parker had arrived at wearable computing.Tommie reached into the handcart and lifted out two plastic bags."Time to leave your Epiphanies behind, guys.I've got new clothes for you. ""You really meant it," said Rivera."Yup.Your old clothes will help me fake your location.Meantime the real you will be with me, and using far better equipment. ""Not laptops, I hope," said Winnie, giving Parker's laptop sling a doubtful look.But he and the others shed shirts and pants and shoes.They still had their contact lenses, but now there was nothing to drive them.The real lighting was bright enough, but without external sound and vision, the room felt like a coffin.Tommie seemed genuinely embarrassed by all the naked flab.But not for long.He pulled open one of the plastic bags and passed around pants and shirts.They looked like plain gray fabric, working clothes.Carlos held his new shirt up to the light and peered at the weave.He folded it between his hands and rubbed the sides together."These clothes are dumb. ""Yup.No infrared microlasers, no processor nodes.Just the good cotton as God meant us to wear it. ""But  "  "Don't worry, I have processors. ""I was joking about laptops, Tommie. "Tommie shook his head."No, not laptops, either.I have Hurd boxes. "Huh ?Without his wearable, Robert was stumped.Carlos looked just as blank, but then some errant natural memory must have popped up: "Oh!Hurd OS!But isn't that obsolete?"Tommie was rummaging in the second plastic bag.He did not look up."Not obsolete.Just illegal Ah, here they are.Genuine Hecho en Paraguay" He handed each of his co conspirators a black plastic box about the size and shape of a paperback book.There was a real keypad on one side and a metallic clip on the other."Just snap it on your waistband.Make sure the metal tab is actually touching your skin. "Robert's new pants were too short, and the shirt fit like a tent.He slipped the criminal computer on his waistband and felt the cold touch of metal on his skin.He could see a faint overlay now.It was a picture of a keypad, and when his hand rested on the box at his waist, he saw markers corresponding to his fingertips.What a pitiful interface."Don't cover the box with your shirt, Carlos.All the comm ports are on it. "Winnie: "You mean we have to turn in just the right direction to make a connection?""Yup.While we're below, our only external routing will be through my laptop.And my laptop's only uplink will be through this. "Tommie held up something that looked like a prayer wheel.He gave it a little spin.There was a glint in the air, sliding along a thread too fine to see, to a connector Tommie held in his other hand.He turned and plugged that into a box on the handcart."Check it out. "Robert pulled his shirt back from his waistband, and turned so the box had a clear view of Tommie's laptop.Nothing.He entered a simple command, and now he could see through the walls again!North of Gilman Drive, there were even more people heading toward the library.Indoors he drifted back up the hallway.Still deserted.No !There was a fellow walking purposefully down toward their "secret" room.Then he lost the viewpoint."Hey, Tommie  "  "What?"The Stranger's voice sounded in Robert's ear.The audio was as bad as his old view page, but he clearly heard: "You didn't see a thing, my man. ""I  " Robert swallowed."Your fiber link is working fine, Tommie. ""Good, good. "Parker walked among them, making sure that everyone could receive and transmit."Okay.You're all equipped.That was the fun part.Now here's the pack mule part. "He pointed at the backpacks in the handcart.Robert's pack weighed something like forty pounds.Carlos's looked about the same.Tommie and Winnie had smaller packs.Even so, Blount struggled with his load.Winnie's like an old man .Yeah, Reed Weber's heavenly minefield.Robert looked away before Winnie could take offense.He shrugged his own pack into a more comfortable position and complained, "I thought this was the future, Tommie.Where's the miniaturization?Or at least the automatic freight handlers?""Where we're going, the infrastructure ain't friendly, Robert. "Tommie glanced at his laptop's display."Hello, Mr.Sharif.Okay, it looks like we're all ready to go. "He bowed them toward the dark hole in the middle of the room."After you, gentlemen. "22    The Bicycle Attack  Alfred waited a decent time before entering the room.No sense in making noise that Rabbit's stooges might hear."What did I tell you, Doc!We're in.We're in!"Rabbit danced a merry jig around the caisson.The optical fiber that was giving Rabbit such joy was invisibly thin except when the light caught it just right.Vaz nodded.He had a different communications success to celebrate; he had reestablished his milnet link across the Pacific.Braun  > Mitsuri, Vaz: <sm>U.S.  Homeland Security looks calm, Alfred.</sm> Alfred watched the stats streaming by.They were from the Alliance's listening posts.The national security scene was indeed calm, even though the library disturbance had brought crowds to the UCSD campus.Rabbit had created the perfect paradoxical distraction.Almost perfect; the affair was growing too large.Vaz knelt beside the box that marked the termination point of Thomas Parker's fiber link.The box was a scamful bridge.On one side, it accepted the uncertified data streams from Parker's criminal computers.On the other, it was a "good citizen," running under the government required Secure Hardware Environment.It hid Parker's data in innocent packages wrapped in all the licenses and permissions needed to survive on the SHE of the Internet.Altogether it was not as secure as Vaz's milnet, but it would suffice for most regions of the contingency tree.Alfred tweaked the box, and now he was getting Parker's video direct.At last, he was truly a Local Honcho.The video from Parker's laptop bounced around without a bit of program control.But Vaz recognized the equipment in the walls, and some of the physical signage.Rabbit's stooges had breached bio lab security.Even more impressive, the delicate game of fooling the lab's automatic security was a continuing success."How far are they from Goal A?"Alfred asked Rabbit.In fact, that was the site of his private research program.He would pretend to inspect it along with the others."Almost there. "Rabbit waved airily."They'll start dropping off equipment in less than ten minutes.Don't worry about a thing. "Alfred looked out through his surface viewpoints."Most of my mobiles are trapped on the north side of Gilman Drive. "In conventional combat, his bots would have simply seized the local infrastructure and come storming across.Instead, they were balked by the human and automobile traffic along the roadway.At least one had been struck by an auto.Rabbit spread its paws in mock sympathy.At least it didn't bring out another carrot."You can't have everything.Hacek and Scoochi fans have done everything we could pray for: The human staff is out of the labs.The riot is sucking in the local comm resources.It'll be a regular black hole by the time it peaks.And it all looks totally innocent .Don't tell me you could mask this operation any better. "Vaz let that brag go unanswered.He'd come to realize that irritation was the kindliest emotion he could feel for Rabbit.He sat with his back to the concrete caisson and tracked ongoing developments.He could see that the Department of Homeland Security people were watching closely, but they were watching the wrong places.Analyst consensus was that Rabbit had tuned things to match DHS paranoia perfectly.Maybe Alice Gong had been taken down, but undetected by Alliance monitors?Underground, Rabbit's stooges had almost reached Goal A.  In ten minutes the "investigation" of that site would begin.In another half hour, he could begin to report his doctored results and after that it was simply a matter of getting out and letting the stooges be captured.Things were going so smoothly, he could have stayed back in Mumbai.Not that he was complaining!Analyst red flag .Someone reviewing stale video had noticed something.Alfred brought up the flag report.It was a ten second snippet from one of his mobiles on the north side of Gilman Drive: Two children with bicycles.They were standing by the roadway and looking at something that might have been a crushed mech.Those are the two I saw earlier .Queries spread outward: Who were the children?Was the mobile one of Alfred's?Ugly answers came back.Rabbit didn't have access to the Indo European analysts, but suddenly the creature sat up and gave an admiring whistle."Well, I'll be dipped!We've got company, Doc. "Miri left her bike in the rack outside Pilchner Hall.Juan insisted on bringing his fancy foldup into the building.When Miri pointed out the absurdity of this, the boy just shrugged."My bike is special. "Lena and Xiu were no longer visible, but Lena's voice followed them through the wide open doors."There should be better security, Miri.I don't like this. ""It's the emergency overload behavior, Lena.Unoccupied rooms stay locked.The others are open. "Lena said, "And we can't see you anymore. "The sudden drop in data was very strange, but Miri wasn't going to say that.Instead: "I bet high rate forwarding isn't supported except for around the library. "Xiu said, "Yes, we still have spectacular views from there. "The main corridors in Pilchner Hall had searchable viewpoints.There were glimpses of Robert's recent passage.That was enough to guide them downstairs.But now there were places where Juan and Miri could talk only to each other."It's like a haunted house. "Juan's voice was hushed.His hand reached out and grasped hers; she didn't shake him loose.She needed him to keep cool.Certainly losing connectivity in the middle of an office building was an eerie thing.They came around a corner, and there was a glimmer of connectivity, enough for sming:  Miri  > Miri Gang: <sm>I think we're getting close.</sm>  Lena  > Miri Gang: <sm>First we lost video.Now we can barely talk.Get out of there.</sm>  Miri  > Miri Gang: <sm>It's just temporary.I'm sure wikiBell is shifting extra coverage into place.</sm> How bad could an entertainment riot get?Miri imagined Lena was having a similar discussion with Dr.Xiang in a certain car driving around the north side of campus.Grandmother seemed truly anxious.Xiu  > Miri Gang: <sm>I agree with Miri.But give Lena and me regular reports.</sm>  Lena  > Miri Gang: <sm>Yes!Even if that means you have to backtrack.Where is Robert now?</sm>  Miri > Miri Gang: <sm>Real close.I can ping him direct.</sm>  The twisty hallway was brightly lit, just what you'd expect during a network brownout.Juan's bike coasted along almost silently, all folded up into portability mode.He only had to give it a push every so often.Their footsteps and the faint snicking of its tires were the only sounds.They took another corner.The hall was narrower, with intersections every few feet.This was one of those temporary makeovers that crazy architects for a day liked to do.For a few dozen feet they had high rate connectivity.Ads and announcements appeared on the walls; someone's medical research project loomed like a monster on the left.She gave Lena and Xiu a continuous video as they turned another corner  and lost all outside connectivity.Juan slowed, drew Miri to a stop."This place is really dead. ""Yeah," said Miri.They walked forward a few more paces.Except for her point to point link with Juan, she might as well have been on the far side of the moon.And there was another corner ahead.She pulled Juan forward.Around the corner, the corridor ended at a closed door."I can't ping your grandpa anymore, Miri. "Miri looked at the map she had cached."This has to be where they are, Juan.If we can't get through, we'll just pound on the door. "Suddenly she didn't care too much about embarrassing Robert and his friends.This was too strange.But then the door opened and a man in dark clothes stepped out.He might have been a janitor, or a professor.Either way, he didn't look friendly."May I help you?"he said."How did they find us?"Rabbit a made warning gesture."Not out loud, Doc," it hissed."They might actually hear you. "It seemed to look over Alfred's shoulder."I'd say they're following the girl's grandfather. "Vaz glanced at the heap of clothes that lay by the caisson.He sminged back, voice format: "Those clothes are still transmitting?""Well, of course.To the outside, it looks like the old guys are just sitting around, maybe playing cards.I'm faking everything, even their medicals. "Alfred realized he was grinding his teeth."That Gu kid is such an pain," Rabbit continued."Sometimes I think she  "  Alfred waved his hand and the creature disappeared  along with all public network communication.There was now a deep local silence, a hard deadzone.But his milnet link was still in place, a fragile chain that led through his mobiles to his stealthed areobot and thence across the Pacific.Alfred's analyst pool in Mumbai was estimating sixty seconds till the deadzone got serious attention from the campus police and fire departments.Braun  > Mitsuri, Vaz: <sm>This can't be sustained, Alfred.</sm>  Vaz  > Braun, Mitsuri: <sm>I'll clear the deadzone in a few seconds.</sm> This was why successful missions had a Local Honcho.He probed the mobiles that had made it into the building: the children were about thirty feet away, well inside the deadzone, and still coming.He could hear them, right through the plastic wall.He glanced at the door; it was locked.Maybe he could pretend to be empty air while they pounded on the door.No they'd just back off and call the police.Okay, time for direct action.Alfred set the twe nearest mobiles into motion.These were network superiority bots with essentially no antipersonnel capacity, but they would be a distraction.Then he opened the door and stepped out into the hall, confronting two children and a folded up bicycle."May I help you?"Miri tried to glare at the old fellow.Self rightcous indignation came hard when you were trespassing and trying to think of a good lie.And her link to the outside world was still fully dead.Juan stepped forward and just blathered out the truth."We're looking for Miri's grandfather.We ping him somewhere behind you. "The janitor/professor/whatever shrugged."There's no one here but myself.As you know, network connections are very unreliable this evening.The building shouldn't have allowed you down here.I'll have to ask you to go back to the public area. "There was a sign by the door now, one of the standard biohazard symbols that covered a lot of the classrooms and labs in Pilchner Hall.You might think the public net was coming back up  except that Miri still couldn't probe behind her line of sight.Juan nodded as if the old man made perfect sense.He walked forward a couple more steps, at the same time relaying what he saw back to Miri.The room beyond was brightly lit.There was some kind of hole in the floor, and she could see the top of a metal ladder."Okay," said Juan agreeably.He was fiddling with something on his bike.But point to point, his words were on fire:  Juan > Mid: <sm>See the clothes!</sm> piled on the floor beside the pit.Miri  > Juan: <sm>Time to go.</sm> Get outside, get where they could call the cops.She shrugged, as casually as she could, and said, "We'll be on our way then. "The stranger sighed."No, it's too late for that. "He started toward them.Behind her there was the snick of something hard on the floor and she saw dark things scuttling toward her.There was no way back and no way forward.And then Juan made a way forward.He bounced his bike toward the stranger.There was a screech of rubber.The wheels spun up with all the power from the regen brakes, and the bike exploded across the room, smashing into the stranger and the equipment behind him.Miri ran forward, toward the pit."C'mon, Juan!"She knew where Robert must be, and how she could put out the alarm.She scrambled over the edge, saw metal rungs."Juan!"Mr.Janitor/Professor was back on his feet and staggering forward.He had something pointy in his hand.Miri was frozen for an instant, watching the pointy thing swing toward her.Orozco was such a runt.He couldn't stop someone like that.But he tried.The bad guy staggered back and the thing in his hand made a bright purple flash.Miri felt a numbing tingle all across her side.She tipped over the edge of the pit, managed to grab a ladder rung with the hand that still had feeling.But her feet swung through emptiness.She pawed with her numb hand, missed, and fell onto very hard concrete.All her imagery was gone; maybe her Epiphany was fried.But she could see the circle of light above, and she could hear."Run Miri!Run  " Juan's shout was cut off by a meaty crunching sound.Miri ran.23    In the Cathedral  The UCSD library riot was the news of the evening.No doubt it would be echoing back and forth across the world for the next few weeks, a new twist in the trajectory of public entertainment.It was also a bright spot on Bob Gu's situation board.Too bright.Bob watched the analysts  even people with specialties as remote as forensic virology  cluster around that single locus in Southern California.There are other things going on tonight, guys .The DEA raid in Kern County had triggered real violence in the Canadian North.That was outside of Bob's watch area  but it might indicate that something more than simple enhancement drugs was involved.If not for the library riot, he'd be seeing dozens of theories floating up: Maybe the Kern County business was a cover for immigrant bashing.Maybe something more lethal than enhancements was involved.Analysts were great at such wild conjectures, and equally great at feeding on them, reducing them to rubble  or finding solid evidence and drawing in the firepower that Bob Gu commanded.But tonight  well, the UCSD riot did have the taint of a classic diversion, covering something big and bad and elsewhere in CONUS Southwest.Alice had doubled the size of the analyst pool.Now there were specialists from the Centers for Disease Control, even folks from other watches.Normally, she would have groomed her unruly mob of specialists; she had the breadth and the depth and the charisma to bring even academic civilians into line.But tonight, Alice was part of the problem.Every time he redirected the group into a wider view, she drew it back.She was the one who had diverted the virologists.There was a tight little cluster of bioscience types that grew brighter and closer, bandwidths rising.Alice was not studying the riot per se, but its connections to the bioscience labs that surrounded the school.Except for the diversion of their night staff, the labs showed all green.And the harder she pounded on the lab network security, the cleaner it looked.It's the damn JITT .Alice had just completed her Training for the bio lab audit.That had been the most extensive JITT she had ever undertaken.At this moment, he'd guess there wasn't anyone in the world with more knowledge of lab automation and associated research.I should talk to her direct, no more polite redirections .Hell, if she won't back off, I should relieve her !And those thoughts were much too like their recent fights at home.So it was Bob who drew back.He sat and watched the correlations, the statistical outliers.He moved his group members away from San Diego issues.They would be the tripwires if UCSD was a diversion.The bioscience pool just got brighter.Alice had preempted CDC's genomics division.He would hear about that in the after action meetings.He had a cold intuition.Tonight could be the night.The thing he personally feared as much as anything in the world, the possibility Alice always denied.Is she slipping away ?What would a full sized JITT collapse be like for someone who had Trained a dozen times more than the worst JITT head in a VA hospital?"Did you hear something?""Like what, Tommie?""You know, like a distant thump. "They stopped and looked back.Winnie made an indignant noise.This was like the old days, when Tommie was always working to increase the suspense of their illicit expeditions.Tommie hesitated.He was leading from behind so that the fine fiber he was paying out wouldn't get trampled by the others.He listened for a moment more, and then turned to catch up."Maybe it was nothing but the fiber went dead for moment, too. "He glanced down at his laptop."It looks okay now. "He waved them up the tunnel, into the dark beyond their little pool of light."Keep going. "The first part of the tunnel had been very familiar, an eerie walk down memory lane.There was a time, now more than fifty years past, when all of them but Carlos had explored the tunnels.Tommie Parker had been a smartass freshman showing off to a couple of grad students who often wondered how they had been inveigled into such harebrained expeditions.As they walked farther on, things became less familiar.Glassy tubes ran along the walls.Robert saw signs printed on the walls, cryptic physical backup for nodes that wouldn't respond to his computer box.Thunk .Something white and the size of a volleyball whizzed by in one tube.Thunk, thunk .Similar traffic in the opposite direction.Pneumatic tubes had once been a sign of the brave new world.When Robert was a child, he'd seen such things in dying department stores."Why the pneumo tubes, Tommie?""Well, this is where theory meets reality.Proteomics, genomics, regulomics  you name the 'omic,' and it's here.These labs are huge .The local data traffic is a million times what you have on a public trunk, with the latencies of a home network.But they still need to look at real biologicals.Sometimes they gotta move samples  transport trays for short moves, pneumos for longer ones.GenGen even has its own UP/Express launcher, for shipping parcels to other labs around the world. "Now Robert heard sounds from the darkness ahead of them, voices that never quite made recognizable words, clicking that might have been old time typewriters.This is science ?Carlos said, "When I try to probe the local net, all I see are the bare walls. ""I told you.Talking to the labnet would make this scam way too complicated. ""The tunnel must know we're here. "They walked in a small pool of light.Behind and ahead of them, the tunnel was dark."Yup.It knows we're here.But you might say that's only at a subconscious level. "Robert was in the lead.He pointed at the wall just at the front edge of the light."What about these signs?"The letters were physically painted on the wall:  PBps:Prot< >Geno.1 OPBps:Multi  That brought Tommie forward."Maybe it's the General Genomics crossbar!"He held his prayer wheel high, waving the fiber out and away from the others.The Stranger was visible beside Tommie, but down here the monster couldn't quite locate itself.Its feet floated above the floor, and its gaze was wrong by ninety degrees.Tommie pointed his laptop so its camera could see the lettering."I have to admit, this fiber link is handy.I can send video out to my consultancy. "Invisible to Tommie, the Mysterious Stranger jerked a thumb at itself and grinned.Tommie studied his laptop's display for a moment."Yes!We have reached the GenGen optical crossbar. "He pointed down the side tunnel."This is where things get tricky. "Within fifty feet, the side tunnel had opened into something wider something cavernous.In the shadows, something slanted into the heights."See that tower?"said Tommie."That's GenGen's private launcher.These guys don't bother with the launchers in East County. "The clickety sound was all around them now.It came from the tops of equipment cabinets; it had a pattern, like poetry scanned purely for stress.At the end of a stanza, things actually moved .Light glittered from deep within matted crystals.Some of the cabinets had a physical label:  Mus MCog.The Stranger danced among them, a fantasy from Tommie's laptop and the fiber behind them.But the fantasy was watching through the laptop's camera, and talking  at least to Robert.The Stranger pointed in the general direction of the crystals."The wonders of nano fluidics.A decade of old time bioscience done in every shifting of the lights.How do you represent a trillion samples, and a billion trillion analyses?How can art deal with that?"It hesitated as if truly anxious for an answer, and then it was gone again.But it left behind its own labels and explanations.Robert looked at the ranks of machines, the tower almost lost in the distant dark.The place was a machine cathedral.But how to represent it, when it would take him years to have even shallow understanding?The massed crystal was not spectacularly colored; most of the fluid paths were microscopic and hidden within appliances that might have been oversized refrigerators.The Stranger's labels floated randomly about, ghostly subtitles to some transcendent process.And yet, it almost made him remember what he had lost; words burbled up within his imagination, words striving to capture the awe he felt.They walked down the narrow aisles, turning only when Tommie told them to turn.Every minute or so, he would stop their progress and grab a few more gadgets from the backpacks."We gotta install these just right, guys.Staying invisible here is a lot harder than in the tunnel. "Tommie wanted the gadgets set near comm nodes, which turned out to be way back within the fluidics crystals.Robert did most of the "installing. "Carlos would boost him up over the top of the cabinet.Robert would wiggle back, so near the glassworks that he could hear tiny, tiny clicks and the fluid hissing so faintly it might have been seepage.In their millions, those sounds added up to the larger atmosphere of the room.In one case, Robert lingered, and noticed that the gadget itself took care of final installation, sliding away from him, deeper into the glassworks  as if its underside were a miniature transport tray ."What are you laughing at, Gu?"Blount's voice came from below."Nothing!"Robert crawled off the cabinet and dropped to the floor."I just figured out a little mystery. "They continued on.Most of the cabinets were labeled Dros MCog now.They were making faster progress, mainly because Carlos and Robert had figured out the gymnastics of the operation."That's the last of them, guys!"Tommie's gaze shifted from his laptop to the fluidics crystals."You know, it's really weird that all the node locations were so deep in the lab equipment," he said.The Mysterious Stranger slipped in front of Tommie and waggled greenish fingers at Robert and Carlos and Winnie Blount."That's not a mystery to follow up on.Why doesn't someone suggest that we get on with Tommie's great plan, eh?"No one said anything for a moment, but Robert guessed two things about what they had just done: It was what they had really come here for.It was how the Stranger might make good on his promises.Maybe Carlos and Winnie realized something similar, because suddenly all of them were talking.Blount waved the others silent and turned to Parker."Who knows, Tommie?You said this was subtle.It might take weeks to figure out just how everything fits together. ""Yup, yup," Tommie nodded, oblivious of the Stranger's satisfied look."Time for analysis later!"He glanced down at his laptop."In any case this was the hard part.Now we have a clear run to where Huertas stores the shredda. "They didn't set down any more gadgets.Tommie's laptop advised speed, and therefore so did Tommie.Whatever the Mysterious Stranger planned for GenGen no longer needed them.Robert glanced back.Winnie was out of breath, almost trotting.The Stranger must have given him some special encouragement.And behind Carlos, Tommie spun his prayer wheel, drifting the spider thread out behind them.Suddenly the concrete floor gave way to something that bounced back against their feet.And the sound of their steps was like tapping on a vast and tightly fitted drum."When does a tunnel fly?"said Tommie."When it's really a tunnel in the sky!"And suddenly, Robert realized where they were.This was one of the enclosed walkways that came off the side of Rose Canyon, just north of campus.Right now they were standing in a tube seventy feet above the brush and manzanita covered hillside.Then they were back on concrete.Ahead was another cavern, and this one was almost empty.Huertas country.Miri ran, but a spotlight followed.No, that was just normal tunnel lighting.She slowed, stopped, slid up against the wall and looked back.No human followed.The entrance hole was the only other light, and now it was some distance behind her.Juan !She watched it and listened.If no one was coming after her, that might mean that UCSD security was still working down here.She tried to probe the walls.She called 911.Again.Nothing.Maybe the Badguy had permanently zapped her Epiphany.She shrugged up some test routines.No, it wasn't dead.She could see her files, but every local node was ignoring her.Then she noticed the pink flicker at the edge of the diagnostic, a wireless response that her Epiphany would normally have discarded as too distant, too erratic.A second passed, heaven knew how many retries, and she got an ID.It was Juan, his wearable.Miri  > Juan: <sm>Please answer!</sm>  No reply came back, and she couldn't check his medicals without more access rights.Abruptly Juan's light flared, died.Miri sucked in a breath.Mr.Janitor/Professor was still up there.He had whacked poor Juan again.No, be precise: He had whacked Juan's gear again, maybe just to prevent Miri from forwarding out through it.For a moment, Miri drew in on herself.It was not a good thing that all her planning and leadership could come to this.Alice never seemed to have these problems.She always knew what to do next.Bob sometimes Bob made mistakes.He was the one who always seemed uneasy about certainty.I wonder what Bob would think of all this ?I wonder what Juan would do ?Miri looked down the tunnel, away from the entrance.It was dark, but it wasn't perfectly quiet.There might be voices, chatting conversationally, never quite making words.Robert and his library friends were down here, surely being run as cat's paws by Mr.Janitor/Professor.How can I wreck his plan ?Miri got to her feet and ran quietly up the tunnel, still trapped in her own private pool of light.No sign of Robert, and none of the mumbled voices sounded quite right.She passed occasional cross tunnels.Small things whizzed down transparent tubes.Some minutes later, and still no sign of Robert.Miri read as she ran along; she had cached plenty about UCSD and the biotechs.There was proprietary and security stuff she couldn't know, but the cross tunnels led off to particular labs.Three hundred acres in seventeen separate chambers!Miri's run slowed to a walk, then came to a miserable stop.Robert could be anywhere.How much control did the Badguys have down here?Maybe I should just start shouting .Faintly, behind her, there came a new kind of sound.Soft hammers pounding on a metal drum.But the cadence was like footsteps.And suddenly she had a very good idea of where the others were.Now if only she could match that to where she was.Miri turned and headed back.24    The Library Chooses  Sheila Hanson's night crew came out of the forest on the path of the great snake of knowledge, just east of the library.The Hacek spiders were already there, and they had the high ground.Tim Huynh rolled and walked his bottish army right to the edge of the enemy force.Huynh  > Night Crew: <sm>Jeez.They're all real!</sm> The spiders, that is.Most of the humans were real, too.Hacekean Knights and Libarians were thick behind their robots.Round the north side of the library came more Scoochi reinforcements, supporters from the Oceanography Library at Scripps Institute.But the Hacekeans had their own reinforcements.From cameras flying above the library, Huynh could see those latest arrivals chasing the Scripps people.So far there had been little property damage.The mechs looked sinister enough, and the humans were mostly milling and shouting.Sheila was still doing pretty well with her "We want our REAL books!"chant.Something big and virtual came rushing out of the Hacekean side and onto the bottish no man's land.It was twelve feet tall, the best Dangerous Knowledge that Timothy Huynh had ever seen.Half Librarian, half Knight Guardian, the creature was Hacek's central paradox.Now it capered almost to the edge of the Scoochi lines and made a grotesque face, tongue long and pointy like a Maori daemon.And when it shouted, every Scoochi heard, but the message was customized to the listener:  "Hoy, Timothy Huynh, you think you's a Lesser Scooch a mout.Lesser indeed!All you Scoochi moppets be trashy children's things, shallow and unworthy before our Depth!"Dangerous Knowledge waved at the Hacek critters around and behind it.That was the usual slur against the Scooch a mout mythos, and it always made the Scoochis mad, since naive outsiders might be deceived by the claim.There were counterchants from the Scoochi ranks:  "Hacek is just counterfeit Pratchett!"And that set the Hacek people into a rage, since of course it was only the simple truth.Huynh pushed past Sheila and Smale and the rest of the night crew, till he stood at the forward edge of his army.Up close, this Dangerous Knowledge was even more spectacularly detailed.Its taloned boots were artfully sunk in the muck beside the serpent's path.Spider bots hummed and hopped around their patron.The spider bots were real.Where had the Hacekeans gotten such clever things, and on such short notice?He pinged them; not surprisingly, nothing came back.There was an almost living suppleness about the way they scrambled over one another, surging and retreating.The gadgets looked like custom melds of the latest Intel and Legend models.GenGen regu lomics was upgrading to something like this.He pinged them again, this time with his GenGen technician's authority.Holy shit!"Hey!"Huynh shouted."The Hacek bums have stolen GenGen equipment!"And now that he looked closely at the other side, he recognized fellow employees!There was Katie Rosenbaum.She waved her battle axe and leered at him.Rosenbaum  > Huynh: <sm>We just borrowed them, dearie!</sm>  He'd had lunch with Katie and her friends only yesterday.He knew there were Hacek sympathizers in regulomics, so of course his crew had kept their plans under wraps.And all the while the treacherous Hacekeans had been doing the same!Dangerous Knowledge continued its merry dance through the spider troops, mocking the Scoochis' surprise.It shouted, "Indignant, be ye now, wee Huynhling?Could it be ye just cheated with too little imagination?What ye brought is old and slow, well matched to the petty concept of your imagery!"The art behind Dangerous Knowledge was astoundingly good, without precursors.But whoever was pulling the strings was even more impressive, certainly a world class professional actor.For a moment the Scoochi ranks wavered and their mob of virtual supporters began to melt away.In the view from above, Huynh saw still more Hacekeans piling up around the other sides of the library.If the balance shifted too far, the Scoochis would end in humiliation and defeat.Then Sheila Hanson's voice came loud on the public venue, audible across the entire participating world."Look!
