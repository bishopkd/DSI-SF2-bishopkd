Ill report back in a bit.I made it slowly through the crowd into the Ambassadors orbit.There in the middle of laughter and buffeted a little by those dancing, I raised my glass and made EdGar face me.Ambassador, I said.They smiled.So, I said.Are we ready?Christ Pharos no, said Ed or Gar.You ask as if I should know whats going on, Avice, said the other.I inclined my head.EdGar and I had always enjoyed an exaggerated flirtation.They liked me; they were garrulous, gossips, always giving up as much as and a little more than they should.The dapper older men glanced side to side, raised eyebrows in theatrical alarm as if someone might swoop in and stop them speaking.That conspiratorialism was their shtick.They had probably been warned off me in the last few months, but they still treated me with a chatty courtesy I appreciated.I smiled but hesitated when I realised that despite their party faces, they seemed genuinely unhappy.I wouldnt have thought it were......possible, EdGar said.Theres things going on here......that we dont understand.What about the rest of the Ambassadors?I said.We looked around the room.Many of their colleagues had arrived now.I saw EsM in iridescent dresses; ArnOld fingering the tight collars wedged uncomfortably below their links; JasMin and HelEn debating complexly, each Ambassador interrupting the other, each half of each Ambassador finishing their doppels words.So many Ambassadors in one place made for a dreamish feel.Socketed into their necks and variously ornamental, according to taste, diodes in their circuited links staccattoed through colours in simultaneous pairs.Honestly?said EdGar.Theyre all worried.To various degrees.Some of them think were......exaggerating.RanDolph thinks itll all be good for us.To have a newcomer, to shake us up.But no ones sanguine.Wheres JoaQuin?And wheres Wyatt?Theyre bringing the new boy along.Together.Neithers been letting the other out of their sight.Staff were making space in front of the entrance to the hall, preparing for JoaQuin, the Chair of the Ambassadors, for Wyatt the Bremen attach, and for the new Ambassador.There were people I didnt recognise.Id lost sight of the pilot, so couldnt ask if they were crew, immigrants or temporaries.At most of these balls the newly arrivedpermanent or single tourwould be surrounded by locals.They wouldnt lack company, sexual or conversational.Their clothes and accoutrements, their augmens, would be like grails.What ware they had would be pirated, and for weeks the localnet would be twittering with exotic new algorithms.This time, no one cared about anything but the new Ambassador.What else arrived?Anything useful?Ambassador JasMin was in earshot, and I made a point of asking them, rather than EdGar.JasMin didnt like me so I spoke to them when I could to let them know they didnt intimidate me.They didnt answer and I walked, greeted Simmon, a security officer.We hadnt been close for years, but we liked each other sincerely enough that there was little awkwardness, though I was present as a guest, and an out of favour one at that, while he was working.He shook my hand with his biorigged right limb, which hed worn since a gun had burst on a target range and taken off his own flesh version.I went through the crowd, talked to friends, watching the glimmer of augmens interact, hearing snatches of immer slang and turning to the immersers who spoke them with a word or two in the same dialect, or a hand held in the fingerlock that told them what ship Id last served on, to their delight.I might touch their glasses, and Id go on.Mostly, like everyone else, I was watching for the new Ambassador.AND THEN they came, in a moment that could only have been an anticlimax.It was Wyatt who opened the doors, more careful and hesitant than usual.JoaQuin smiled beside him, and I admired how well they hid the anxiety they must have felt.Conversation hushed.I was holding my breath.There was some little commotion behind them, a moment of dispute between the figures who followed.The new Ambassador stepped forward past their guides, into Diplomacy Hall.That was a palpable moment.One of the two men was tall and thin, with hair receding a blinking, shyly smiling, sallow man.The other was stocky, muscular and more than a hand shorter.He grinned.He was looking around.He ran his hand through his hair.He wore augmens in his blood: I could see the shine of them around him.His companion seemed to have none.The shorter man had a Roman nose, the other a snub.Their skins were different colours, their eyes.They didnt look like or at each other.They stood, the new Ambassador, smiling in their very different ways.They stood there mooncalf and quite impossible.Formerly, 1  KILOHOURS BEFORE, as we prepared for our travel, Scile came to some arrangement with his employers cum supervisors.I never made much effort to understand his academic world.So far as I could gather, he had arranged a very extended sabbatical, and technically his residence in Embassytown was part of a project minutely funded by his university.They were paying him a peppercorn retainer and keeping his access accounts live, with a view to ultimately publishing Forked Tongues: The SocioPsychoLinguistics of the Ariekei.Researchers had come to Embassytown before, particularly Bremen scientists fascinated by the Hosts biological contrivings: there were one or two still there, waiting for relief.But there hadnt been outsider linguists on Arieka in living memory, not since the pioneers who had striven to crack Language, nearly three and a half megahours before.I can stand on their shoulders, Scile told me.They had to work out how it worked from scratch.Why we could understand the Ariekei but they couldnt understand us.Now we know that.While we prepared to arrive in Embassytown on what he called our honeymoon, Scile searched the libraries in Charo City.With my help he tried to tap into immerser lore about the place and its inhabitants, and finally when we arrived he hunted in our own archives in Embassytown, but he found nothing systematic on his topic.That made him happy.Whys no one written on it before?I asked him.No one comes here, he said.Its too far.Itsno offencestuck out in the middle of nowhere.Lord, none taken.And dangerous nowhere, as well.Plus Bremen red tape.And to be honest, none of it makes much sense, anyway.The language?Yes.Language.Embassytown had its own linguists, but most, carta denied if they even bothered to apply, were scholars in the abstract.They learnt and taught Old and New French, Mandarin, Panarabic, spoke them to each other as exercises like others played chess.Some learnt exot languages, to the extent that physiology allowed.The local Pannegetch forgot their native languages when they learnt our Anglo Ubiq, but five Kedis languages and three Shurasi dialects were spoken in Embassytown, four and all of which respectively we could approximate.Local linguists didnt work on the language of the Hosts.Scile, though, was unaffected by our taboos.HE WASNT FROM Bremen, nor from any of its outposts, nor from another nation on Dagostin.Scile was from an urban moon, Sebastapolis, which Id vaguely heard of.He grew up very polyglot.I was never quite sure which language, if any, he considered his first.While we travelled I was envious of the blitheness, the sheer uninterest with which he ignored his birth home.Our route to Embassytown was roundabout.The ships we took were crewed by immersers from more places than Id ever see.I knew the charts of Bremens crowded immer cognita, could once have told you the names of nations on many of its core worlds, and some of those I served with on my way home were from none of them.There were Terre from regions so far off that they teased, telling me the name of their world was Fata Morgana, or Fiddlers Green.Had I ship hopped in other directions, I could have gone to regions of immer and everyday where Bremen was the fable.People get lost in the overlapping sets of knownspace.Those who serve on exot vessels, who learn to withstand the strange strains of their propulsionof swallowdrives, overlight foldings, bansheetechgo even farther with less predictable trajectories, and become even more lost.Its been this way for megahours, since women and men found the immer and we becameHomo diaspora.Sciles fascination with the Hosts language was always a bit of a titillation to me.I dont know if, as an outsider not only to Embassytown but to Bremen space itself, he could appreciate the frisson he produced in me every time he said Ariekei instead of the respectful Hosts, every time he parsed their sentences and told me what they meant.Im sure its some kind of irony or something that it was through my foreign husbands researches that I learnt most of what I know about the language of the city in a ghetto of which I was born.ACLACCELERATED CONTACT LINGUISTICSwas, Scile told me, a speciality crossbred from pedagogics, receptivity, programming and cryptography.It was used by the scholarexplorers of Bremens pioneer ships to effect very fast communication with indigenes they encountered or which encountered them.In the logs of those early journeys, the excitement of the ACLers is moving.On continents, on worlds vivid and drab, they record first moments of understanding with menageries of exots.Tactile languages, bioluminescent words, all varieties of sounds that organisms can make.Dialects comprehensible only as palimpsests of references to everything already said, or in which adjectives are rude and verbs unholy.Ive seen the trid diary of an ACLer barricaded in his cabin, whose vessel has been boarded by what we didnt then know as Corscansit was first contact.Hes afraid, as he should be, of the huge things battering at his door, but hes recording his excitement at having just understood the tonal structures of their speech.When the ACLers and the crews came to Arieka, there started more than 250 kilohours of bewilderment.It wasnt that the Host language is particularly difficult to understand, or changeable, or excessively various.There were startlingly few Hosts on Arieka, scattered around the one city, and all spoke the same language.With the linguists earware and drives it wasnt hard to amass a database of sound words (the newcomers thought of them as words, though where they divided one from the next of the Ariekei, might not recognise fissures).The scholars made pretty quick sense of syntax.Like all exot languages it had its share of astonishments.But there was nothing so alien that it trumped the ACLers or their machines.The Hosts were patient, seemed intrigued by and, insofar as anyone could tell through their polite opacity, welcoming to their guests.They had no access to immer, nor exotic drives or even sublux engines; they never left their atmosphere, but they were otherwise advanced.They manipulated life with astonishing finesse, and they seemed unsurprised that there was sentience elsewhere.The Hosts did not learn our Anglo Ubiq.Did not seem to try.But within a few thousand hours, Terre linguists could understand much of what the Hosts said, and synthesised responses and questions in the one Ariekene language.The phonetic structure of the sentences they had their machines speakthe tonal shifts, the vowels and the rhythm of consonants were precise, accurate to the very limits of testing.The Hosts listened, and did not understand a single sound.HOW MANY OF YOU get away?Scile asked me.You make it sound like a prison break, I said.Well, come on.As I recall, youve said to me more than once that you made it out.As I recall you may have told me that, ahem, youd never go back.He looked a sly look.Touch, I said.We were about to start on the last leg to Embassytown.So how many of you?Not a whole lot.You mean immersers?I mean anyone.I shrugged.A couple of non immersers must get cartas every so often.Not that many people bother applying, even if you do pass the tests.You in touch with any of your classmates?Classmates?You mean the immersers in my batch, who left with me?Hardly.I made finger motions to indicate our dispersal.Anyway.There were only three others.We werent close.Even had the practicalities of miab hauled letters not made it near impossible, I wouldnt have tried and nor would they.A classic unspoken agreement among escapees from a small town: dont look back, dont be each others anchors, no nostalgia.I wasnt expecting any of them to return.On that journey to Embassytown, Scile had had his sopor amended, spiked with gerons so he would age while under.Its an affecting gesture, to ensure that the sleep of travel doesnt keep you young while your working partner grows older.In fact he didnt spend all his time under.With the help of medicines and augmens, he spent a little of the journey awake and studying, where immer allowed, breaking off to retch or fend off panic with chemical prophylactics as necessary.Listen to this, he read to me.We were at the table, passing through very calm immer shallows.In deference to his always sickness I was eating dried up fruit, a nearly odourless food.You are of course aware that every Man has two mouths or voices.In thishe prodded what he was readingthey have sex by singing to each other.It was some antique book about a flat land.Whats the point of that nonsense?I said.Im looking for epigraphs, he said.He tried other old stories.Looking for invented cousins to the Hosts, he showed me descriptions of Chorians and Tucans, Ithorians, Wesshar, invented double tongued beasts.I couldnt share his enthusiasms for these grotesques.I could have Proverbs 5:4, he said, staring at his screen.I didnt ask for an explanation: we used to joust like that sometimes.Instead I uploaded a Bible when I was alone, to find: But in the end shes bitter as wormwood, sharp as a sword with two mouths.The Hosts arent the only polyvocal exots.Apparently there are races who emit two, three or countless sounds simultaneously, to talk.The Hosts, the Ariekei, are comparatively simple.Their speech is an intertwining of two voices only, too complexly various to be pegged as bass or treble.Two soundsthey cant speak either voice singlyinextricable by the chance co evolution of a vocalising ingestion mouth and what was once probably a specialised organ of alarm.The first ACLers listened and recorded and understood them.Today we heard them talk about a new building, the bewildered figures on the old trid told Scile and me.Today they were discussing their bio work.Today they were listing the names of stars.We saw Urich and Becker and their colleagues, neither of them yet famous at the time we spied on, mimicking the noises of the locals, repeating their sentences to them.We know thats a greeting.We know it is.We watched a long dead linguist play sounds to a waiting Ariekes.We know they can hear, she said.We know they understand by hearing each other; we know that if one of its friends said exactly what I just played, theyd understand each other.Her recording shook its head at us and Scile shook his.Of the epiphany itself, theres only Urich and Beckers written testimony.In the way of these things, others from their party later denounced the record as misrepresentative, but it was the Urich Becker manuscript that became the story.Id seen the childrens version long ago.I remembered the picture of the moment; Urichs features a delight to the caricaturist, him and subtler faced Sura Becker both rendered with pop eyed exaggeration, staring at a Host.Id never read the unbowdlerised manuscript till Scile pulled it up for me.We knew a great number of words and phrases [I read].We knew the most important greeting: .We heard it every day and we repeated it every daythe latter without effect.We programmed our voxware and had it speak the word repeatedly.And repeatedly the Ariekei ignored it again.At last in frustration we looked at each other and screamed half the word each like a curse.By chance they were simultaneous.Urich yelled suhaill, Becker jarr, at once.The Ariekes turned to us.It spoke.We didnt need our ware to make sense of what it said.It asked us who we were.It asked what we were, and what we had said.It had not understood us, but it had known that there was something to understand.Before, it had always heard the synthesised voices just as noise: but this time, even though our shouts were much less accurate than any ware renditions, it knew that we had tried to speak.Ive heard versions of that unlikely story many times.From that moment, or from whatever really happened, via misjudgements and wrong directions, within seventy five kilohours, our predecessors understood the languages strange nature.Is it unique?I asked Scile once, and when he nodded I, for the first time, really felt astonishment at it, as if I were an outsider, too.Theres nothing like this anywhere, he said.Eh, nee, where.It isnt about the sounds, you know.The sounds arent where the meaning lives.There are exots who speak without speaking.There are no telepaths in this universe, I think, but there are empathics, with languages so silent that they may as well be sharing thoughts.The Hosts are not like that.Theyre empaths of another kind.For humans, say red and its the reh and the eh and the duh combined, those phonemes in context, that communicate the colour.Thats the case whether I say it, or Scile does, or a Shurasi, or a mindless program that has no sense that its speaking at all.That is not how it is for the Ariekei.Their language is organised noise, like all of ours are, but for them each word is a funnel.Where to us each word means something, to the Hosts, each is an opening.A door, through which the thought of that referent, the thought itself that reached for that word, can be seen.If I program ware with an Anglo Ubiq word and play it, you understand it, Scile said.If I do the same with a word in Language, and play it to an Ariekes, I understand it, but to them it means nothing, because its only sound, and thats not where the meaning lives.It needs a mind behind it.Hosts minds were inextricable from their doubled tongue.They couldnt learn other languages, couldnt conceive of their existence, or that the noises we made to each other were words at all.A Host could understand nothing not spoken in Language, by a speaker, with intent, with a mind behind the words.That was why those early ACL pioneers were confused.When their machines spoke, the Hosts heard only empty barks.Theres no other language that works like this, Scile said.The human voice can apprehend itself as the sounding of the soul itself.Who was that?I said.I could tell he was quoting.I cant remember.Some philosopher.Its not true anyway and he knew it.Or she.Or she.Its not true, not for the human voice.But the Ariekei...when they speak they do hear the soul in each voice.Thats how the meaning lives there.The words have got...He shook his head, hesitating, then just using that religiose term.Got the soul in them.And it has to be there, the meaning.Has to be true to be Language.Thats why they make similes.Like me, I said.Like you but not just like you.They made similes long before you lot ever touched down.With anything they could get their hands on.Animals.Their wings.And thats what that split rocks for.Split and fixed.Thats the point.Well quite.They had to make it so they could say Its like  the rock which was split and fixed.About whatever it is they say that about.But they didnt make as many similes, I thought.Before us.No, Scile said.That is...No.I can think things which arent there, I said.And so can they.Obviously.They must, to plan the similes in the first place.Not...quite.Theyve no what ifs, he said.At best, it must be like a pre ghost in their heads.Everything in Language is a truth claim.So they need the similes to compare things to, to make true things that arent there yet, that they need to say.It might not be that they can think of it: maybe Language just demands it.That soul, that soul I was talking abouts what they hear in Ambassadors, too.Linguists invented notation like musical score for the interwoven streams of Hostspeak, named the two parts according to some lost reference: the Cut and the Turn voices.Their, our, human version of Language was more flexible than the original of which it was a crude phonetic copy.It could be sounded out by ware, it could be written, neither of which forms the Hosts, for which Language was speech spoken by a thinker thinking thoughts, could understand.We cant learn it, Scile said.All we can dos teach ourselves something with the same noises, which works quite differently.We jury rigged a methodology, as we had to.Our minds arent like theirs.We had to misunderstand Language to learn it.When Urich and Becker spoke together with shared, intense feeling, one the Cut and the other the Turn, a flicker of meaning was transmitted, where zettabytes of ware had failed.Of course they tried again, they and their colleagues practising duets, words that meant hello or we would like to speak.We watched their recorded ghosts.We listened to them learn their lines.Sounds flawless to me, said Scile, and even I recognised phrases, but the Ariekei did not.U and B had no shared mind, Scile said.No coherent thoughts behind each word.The Hosts didnt react with quite the same blankness with which they had heard synthesised voices.They were uninterested in most, but listened hard to a few of these stuttering couples.They didnt understand it, but they seemed to know that something was being said.Linguists, singers, psychospecialists had investigated those pairs who had the most obvious impact.Scientists had striven to work out what they shared.That was how the Stadt Dyadic Empathy Test was created.Attain a certain threshold together on its steep curve of mutual understandingness, fire up machines to connect various brainwaves, synching and linking them, and a particular pair of humans might just be able to persuade the Ariekei that there was meaning to their noises.Still communication remained impossible, for megahours after contact.It was a long time after those early revelations that researches into empathy got us anywhere.Very few pairs of people scored well on the Stadt scale, scored highly enough to mum a unified mind behind the Language they ventriloquised.That was the minimum it would take to speak across the species.What the colony needed, someone had joked, were single people split in two.And to put it like that was to suggest a solution.The first interlocutors with the Hosts were exhaustively trained monozygote twins.Few such siblings could make Language work any better than the rest of us, but those that could were a slightly larger minority than in any control group.They spoke it horribly, we now know, and there were innumerable misunderstandings between them and the Ariekei, but this meant trade, too, at last, and a struggling to learn.In my life, Id met one other pair of idents, non Embassytowners I mean, in a port on Treony, a cold moon.They were dancers, they did an act.They were blood born, of course, not made, but still.I was absolutely stunned by them.By how they looked like each other, but only so far.That their hair and clothes were not precisely the same, that they spoke in distinguishable voices, went to different parts of the room, talked to different people.On Arieka, for lifetimes, the last two megahours, our representatives hadnt been twins but doppels, cloned.It was the only viable way.They were bred in twos in the Ambassador farm, tweaked to accentuate certain psychological qualities.Blood twins had long been outlawed.A limited empathy might be taught and drugged and tech linked in between two people, but that wouldnt have been enough.The Ambassadors were created and bought up to be one, with unified minds.They had the same genes but much more: it was the minds those carefully nurtured genes made that the Hosts could hear.If you raised them right, taught them to think of themselves right, wired them with links, then they could speak Language, with close enough to one sentience that the Ariekei could understand it.The Stadt test was still taken in the out, by students of the psyche and of languages.It had no practical use, now, thoughwe grew our own Ambassadors in Embassytown, and didnt have to find each precious potential one among very young twins.As a way to source speakers of Language, the test was obsolete, I had thought.Latterday, 2  PLEASE JOIN MEI couldnt see who it was who spoke loudly, announcing the arrivals to Diplomacy Hall in welcoming Ambassador EzRa.They were immediately surrounded.In that moment I saw no close friends, had no one with whom to share my tension or conspiratorial look.I waited for EzRa to do the rounds.When they did, how they did so was another indicator of their strangeness.They must have known how it would seem to us.As JoaQuin and Wyatt introduced them to people, Ez and Ra separated, moved somewhat apart.They glanced at each other from time to time, like a couple, but there were soon metres between them: nothing like doppels, nothing like an Ambassador.Their links must work differently, I thought.I glanced at their little mechanisms.They each wore a distinct design.I shouldnt have been surprised.Disguising their unease with functionaries aplomb, JoaQuin led Ez and Wyatt Ra.Each half of the new Ambassador was at the centre of a curious crowd.This was the first chance most of us had had to meet them.But there were Staff and Ambassadors whose fascination for the newcomers had clearly outlasted their own initial meetings.LeNa, RanDolph and HenRy were laughing with Ez, the shorter man, while Ra looked bashful as AnDrew asked him questions, and MagDa, I realised, stayed close enough to touch his hands.The party bustled about me.I caught sight of Ehrsuls rendered eyes at last and winked as Ra approached me.Wyatt made an aaah noise, held out his hands, kissed my cheeks.Avice!Ra, this is Avice Benner Cho, one of Embassytowns...Well, Avice is any number of things.He bowed as if granting me something.Shes one of our immersers.Shes spent a good deal of time in the out, and now she offers cosmopolitan expertise and an invaluable travellers eye.I liked Wyatt, and his little power plays.You might say we tended to twinkle at each other.Ra, I said.A hesitation too short for him to notice, I think, and I held out my hand.I shouldnt call him Mr.or Squire: legally he was not a man, but half of something.Had he been with Ez Id have addressed them as Ambassador.I nodded at AnDrew, at Mag, at Da, who watched.Helmser Cho, Ra said quietly.He after his own hesitation took my hand.I laughed.Youve promoted me.And its Avice.Avice is fine.Avice.We stood silent for a moment.He was tall and slim, pale, his hair dark and plaited.He seemed slightly anxious but he pulled himself together somewhat as we spoke.I admire you being able to immerse, he said.I never get used to it.Not that Ive travelled a lot, but thats partly why.I forget what I replied, but whatever it was, there was a silence after it.After a minute I said to him, Youll have to get better at it, you know.Small talk.Thats what your job is, from here on in.He smiled.Im not sure thats quite fair, he said.No, I said.Theres wine to drink and papers to sign, too.He seemed delighted by that.And for that you came all the way to Arieka, I said.For ever and ever.Not for ever, he said.Well be here seventy, eighty kilohours.Until the next relief but one, I think.Then back to Bremen.I was astounded.My blather stopped.Of course I should not have been taken aback.An Ambassador leaving Embassytown.Nothing about this situation made sense.An Ambassador with somewhere else to return to was a contradiction in my terms.Wyatt was muttering to Ra.MagDa smiled at me from behind them.I liked MagDa: they were one of the Ambassadors who hadnt treated me differently since my falling out with CalVin.Im from Bremen, Ra told me.Id like to travel like you have.Are you Cut or Turn?I asked.It was obvious he didnt like the question.Turn, he said.He was older than me but not by very much.How did all this happen?I said.You and Ez?It takes years...How long have you been training?Avice, really, Wyatt said from behind Ra.Youll hear all about that He raised his eyebrows in a rebuke, but I raised mine back.There was a moment between him and Ra, before Ra spoke.Wed been friends a long time, he said.We got tested years ago.Kilohours, I mean.It was a random thing, part of an exhibition about the Stadt method.He stopped as the noise in the room grew louder.Mag or Da said something, laughing, moved between me and Ra demanding the attention he politely turned on them.Hes tense, I said to Wyatt quietly.I dont think this is his favourite thing, he said.But then, would it be yours?Poor mans in a zoo.Poor man,  I said.Very, very strange to hear you speak of him like that.Strange times.We laughed over a swell of music.There was a strong smell of perfume and wine.We watched EzRa, who were not EzRa, not really, who were Ez and Ra, separated by metres.Ez was bantering with facility and pleasure.He caught my eye, excused himself to his interlocutors and approached.Hi, he said.I see you met my colleague.He held out his hand.Your colleague?Yes, I met him.I shook my head.JoaQuin were at Ezs elbows, one on each side like elderly parents, and I nodded at them.Your colleague.You really are just determined to scandalise us, Ez, I said.Oh, please.No.Not at all, not at all.He grinned an apology at the doppels escorting him.Its...well, I suppose its just a slightly different way of doing things.And itll be invaluable, said Joa, or Quin, heartily.The two spoke in turn.Youre always telling us were too......stuck in our ways, Avice.This will be......good for us, and good for Embassytown.One of them slapped Ez on the back.Ambassador EzRas an outstanding linguist and bureaucrat.Youre going to say theyre a new broom, arent you, Ambassador?I said.JoaQuin laughed.Why not?Why not indeed?Thats exactly what they are.WE WERE RUDE, Ehrsul and I.  Wed stick together, whispering and showing off, at all these sorts of events.So when she waved a trid hand to attract my attention I joined her expecting to play.But when I reached her she said to me urgently, Sciles here.I didnt look round.Are you sure?I never thought hed come, she said.I said, I dont know what...It was some time since Id seen my husband.I didnt want a scene.I bit a knuckle for a moment, stood up straighter.Hes with CalVin, isnt he?Am I going to have to separate you two girls?It was Ez again.He made me start.Hed extricated himself from JoaQuins anxious stewarding.He offered me a drink.He flexed something inside himself, and his augmens glimmered, changing the colour of his vague halo.I realised that with the help of his innard tech he might have been listening to us.I focused on him and tried not to look for Scile.Ez was shorter than me, and muscular.His hair was cut close.Ez, this is Ehrsul, I said.To my astonishment he looked at her, said nothing and looked back at me.The rudeness made me gasp.Having a good time?he said to me.I watched tiny lights move across his corneas.Ehrsul was moving away.I was going to go with her and blank him haughtily, but behind his back she flashed a quick display: Stay, learn.Youre going to have to do a lot better than that, I said to him quietly.What?He was startled.What?Your  Shes not mine, I said.He stared at me.The autom?I apologise.Im sorry.It isnt me you owe that to.He inclined his head.What are you monitoring?I said to him after a silence.I can see your displays.Its just habit.Temperature, air impurities, ambient noise.Mostly pointless.A few other things: I worked for years in situations that...well, I got used to checking for trid, cameras, ears, that sort of thing.I raised an eyebrow.And I tend to run translationware as a default.No!I said.How exciting.Now, tell me the truth.Got ware in your ears?Are you running a soundtrack?He laughed.No, he said.I grew out of that.I havent done that for...a good week or two.Why are you running translation programs?You...I put my arm on his and looked suddenly exaggeratedly stricken.You do speak Language, dont you?Oh dear, theres been a terrible misunderstanding.He laughed again.Oh, I can get by in Language, thats not it.More seriously: But I dont speak any of the Shurasi or Kedis dialects, or...Oh, you wont find exots here tonight.Apart from Mine Host, obviously.I was surprised he didnt know this.Embassytown was a Bremen colony, under Bremen laws that restricted our few exots to guestworker status.What about you?he said.I dont see augmens.So you speak Language?For a moment I really didnt understand what he meant.No.I let my sockets close up.I had a few bits and pieces once.They can be useful for immersion.And also, I said, yes, you know, I can see how a bit to help make sense of what the Hosts say is...useful.But Ive seen them, theyre too...Its intrusive.Thats sort of the point, he said.Right, and I can put up with that if its any use, but Language is beyond it, I said.Get them, when you hear a Host speak you get a whole eyeful or earful of nonsense.Hello slash query is all well?parenthesis enquiry after suitability of timing slash insinuations of warmness sixty percent insinuations of belief that interlocutor has topic to be discussed forty percent blah blah.I raised an eyebrow.It was pointless.Ez watched me.He knew I was lying.He must have known that the notion of using translationware for Language would be, to an Embassytowner, profoundly inappropriate.Not illegal, but an appalling impertinence.I didnt even know quite why I had said all that.Ive heard of you, he said.I waited.If EzRa were even slightly good at their job theyd have prepared something personal to say to most of the people they might meet, tonight.What Ez said next, though, astonished me.Ra reminded me where wed heard your name.Youre in a simile, arent you?And I gather youve been to the city?Outside Embassytown.Someone brushed past him.He didnt stop looking at me.Yes, I said.Ive been there.Im sorry, I think Ive...Sorry if Ive...Its not my business.No, its just, Im surprised.Of course Ive heard of you.We do our research, you know.Theres not many Embassytowners whove done what youve done.I didnt say anything.I felt I dont know what, to hear that I featured in the Bremen reports on Embassytown.I inclined a glass at Ez, said some goodbye, and went to find Ehrsul manoeuvring her chassis through the crowd.SO WHAT'S THEIR STORY?I said.Ehrsul gave her display shoulders a shrug.Ez is a charmer, isnt he?she said.Ra seems better but hes shy.Anything online?Shed probably been trying to hack into data floating around.Not much, she said.Its some kind of coup for Wyatt that theyre here.Hes crowing so hard hens everywhere are getting randy.Thats why the Staff are so tense.I decrypted the tail end of something...Im pretty sure Staff made EzRa sit a test.I suppose, you know, its the first time in Christ knows how long theres been an Ambassador from the out, and they queried whether anyone who didnt grow up speaking Language could possibly get the nuances.They must resent this appointment.Theyre all technically appointees too, dont forget, I said.It was something that rankled with Staff: on his arrival, Wyatt, like every attach, had had to formally license all the Ambassadors to speak for Bremen.Anyway, they can speak Language?EzRa?She shrugged again.Wouldnt be here if theyd failed, she said.Something happened in the room.A feeling, a moment when, conviviality notwithstanding, it was suddenly imperative to focus.It was like that every time the Hosts came into a room, as they had just come into Diplomacy Hall.THE PARTYGOERS tried not to be rudeas if it were possible for us to be rude to them, as if the Hosts considered politesse on axes that would make any sense to us.Nonetheless, most of us kept up our chitchat and did not ogle.An exception was the crew, who stared frankly at the Ariekei they had never seen before.Across the room I saw my helmsman and I saw the expression on his face.Once I had heard a theory.It was an attempt to make sense of the fact that no matter how travelled people are, no matter how cosmopolitan, how biotically miscegenated their homes, they cant be insouciant at the first sight of any exot race.The theory is that were hardwired with the Terre biome, that every glimpse of anything not descended from that original backwater home, our bodies know we should not ever see.Formerly, 2  I WASN'T SURE how Embassytown would be for Scile.He cant have been the first settler from the out to be brought back by a returnee, but Id never known others.Id spent a long time on ships in the immer, or in ports on planets with diurnal durations inimical to humanitys.My return was the first time for thousands of hours that Id been able to dispense with circadian implants and settle into actual solar rhythms.Scile and I acclimatised to the nineteen hour Ariekene days by traditional means, spending most of our time outside.I warned you, I told him.Its a tiny place.Now I remember those days with real pleasure.Still.I kept telling Scile about my sacrifice in returning to that little placeto come back from the out!to funnel back down!but I was happier than Id imagined I would be when I emerged from the sealed train in the aeolian zone, and breathed Embassytown smells.It felt like being a child again, though it was not.Being a child is like nothing.Its only being.Later, when we think about it, we make it into youth.My early days back in Embassytown, with savings and an outsider, immerser chic.I swaggered.I was welcomed back in delight by those whod known me, who had never thought to see me again, whod doubted the news of my return in the preceding miab.I wasnt rich by any real standard, but my savings were in Bremen Eumarks.This was the foundation currency of Embassytown, of course, but one rarely seen: with thirty or more kilohours between visits from the metropolemore than an Embassytown yearour little economy was self standing.In deference to the Eumark, like all Bremens colonies, our currency was called the Ersatz.All those Ersatzes were incommensurable, each its own and worthless beyond its politys bounds.That portion of my account Id downloaded and had with me, a few months life in Bremen, was enough for me to live in Embassytown until the next relief, perhaps even the one after that.I dont even think people much resented itId earned my money in the out.I told people that what I was doing with it now was floaking.That was inaccuratethere being no commands for me to get away with minimally obeying, I was simply not workingbut they were delighted with the immer slang.They seemed to consider my idleness my right.Those of my shiftparents still working had a party for me, and I was a bit startled by how happy it made me to go back, to be in the nursery, to kiss and hug and shout and re greet these kind men and women, some now disconcertingly old, some seeming unchanged.I told you youd come back!Dad Shemmi kept saying as I danced with him.I told you!They unwrapped the Bremen gewgaws Id brought them.This is too much, my love!Mum Quiller said of some bracelet with aesthetic augmens.The dads and mums were shyly welcoming to my husband.He stood with a game smile all evening in the streamer decorated hall while I got drunk, and he answered the same questions about himself repeatedly.A few of those Id grown up with crossed paths with me again, like Simmon.Though I slightly expected to, I never saw Yohn.I made other friends, from unfamiliar strata.I was invited to Staff parties.Though these had not been my circles before I left, there hadnt been room enough in little Embassytown for me, an immerser in training, not at least to get near them.People, Staff, Ambassadors Id known by sight and reputation in those days were abruptly acquaintances, and more.Some that I had expected to meet, however, were gone.Wheres Oaten?I asked about a man who had mouthpieced often for Staff on our Embassytown trid.Wheres Dad Renshaw?Where are GaeNor?about that elderly Ambassador, one of whom, when recruiting me to Language, had said Avice Benner Cho, is it?with a cadence so splendidly stilted it had become part of my internal idiolect, so whenever I introduced myself by my full name, a little is it?trailed the words in my head, in her voice.Wherere DalTon?I said, of the notorious Ambassador, men with reputations for cleverness and intrigue, who had been less concerned to hide disputes with colleagues than was customary, and whom I had been looking forward to meeting since I learnt it was they who had shown public anger when that miab had broken, back in my childhood.Oaten had retired on his modest local riches.Renshaw had died.Young.I was sad at that.GaeNor had died, one then almost immediately the other, of linkshock and loss.DalTon, I gatheredafter continuing dissidence and some hinted at final impatience with their colleagues, some ostentatiously opaque Staff internecine strifehad disappeared or been disappeared.Intrigued, I prodded at that, but got nothing more.I had enough licence as a returnee to ask such questions about Ambassadors directly, rather improperly, but I could gauge how far to push it and when not to.I have no doubt that this was fallacious, but it felt to me as if I was quicker, better at sarcasm, wittier, because of my time in the out.People were kind to Scile and fascinated by him.He was fascinated back.Hed been on several worlds but emerged into Embassytown as if through a door in a wall.He explored.Our status wasnt a secret.Nonex marriages like ours were known of but rare in Embassytown, which made us a titillation.We were spending most of our time together, still, but gradually less, as he expanded his own circles.Careful, I told Scile, after one party where a man called Ramir had flirted with him, using augmens to make his face provocative, according to local aesthetics.Id never known Scile show interest in men, but still.Homosex was a little bit illegal, I told him.Except for Ambassadors.What about that woman, Damier?he said.Shes Staff, I said.Anyway its only a little bit illegal.How quaint, he said.Oh yes, its just darling.So do they know you were once married to a woman?Ive been to the out, my love, I said.I can do anything I bloody want.I showed him where Id played.We went to galleries and exhibitions of trid.Scile was fascinated by the tramp automa of Embassytown, melancholy seeming mendicant machines.Do they ever go into the city?he said.They did, but even could he corner them their artminds were too feeble to describe it to him.It was Language that he was there for, of course, but he wasnt blinkered to other strangenesses.Ariekene biorigging astonished him.At the houses of friends, he would stare like an appraiser at their quasi living artefacts, architectural filigrees, their occasional medical tweak, prostheses and similar.With me, he would stand at the edge of the aeolian breath, on balconies and viewbridges in Embassytown, watching the herds of power plants and factories graze.Yes, he was staring into the city at where Language was, but he was looking at the city itself as well.Once, he waved like a boy, and though the far off things cant have seen us, it seemed as if one station twitched its antennae in response.Near the heart of Embassytown was the site of the first archive.The field of rubble could have been cleared but it had been left as it was for lifetimes, since it fell: over one and a half megahours, more than half a local century.Our early town planners must have thought that humans need ruins.Children still came, as we had, sometimes, and the overgrown dereliction was busy with Terre animals and those local lives that could tolerate the air we breathed.They, too, Scile spent a long time watching.Whats that?A red simian thing with a dogs head, shinning up a pipe.A fox, its called, I said.Is it an altered?I dont know.Way back, if so.Whats that?A jackdaw.A stickleback cat.A dog.Some indigene, I dont know its name.Thats not what we call a dog where I come from, hed say, or Jack, daw, carefully repeating names.It was unfamiliar indigenous Ariekene things that interested him most.Once we spent hours in a very hot sun.We sat talking about things, then not talking, holding hands long enough and still enough that the animals and abflora forgot we were alive and treated us as landscape.Two creatures each the size of my forearm wrestled in the grass.Look, I said, quietly.Shh.Some way from the animals a clumsy little biped was edging away, its rear a fringe of blood.Its injured, Scile said.Not exactly.Like every Embassytowner child, I knew what this was.Look, I said.Thats the hunter.A ferocious little altbrock, its black and white fur spattered.What its fightings called a trunc.As is that thing running away.I know they look like different animals.You see how the tail end of that one over theres all ragged?And the head of the one getting into it with the altbrocks torn, too?Thats the brainhalf and thats the meathalf of the same animal.They tear apart when the truncs attacked: the meathalf holds off any predators while the brain end runs off looking for a last chance to mate.It doesnt look anything like other local stuff, Scile said.But...I dont think its Terre?The meathalf of the trunc was winning, grinding the altbrock down.Before it tore apart it would have had eight legs.There werent any octopodes on Terre, were there?Maybe underwater, but...Its not Terre or Ariekene, I said.It was brought in by accident kilohours ago, on a Kedis ship.Theyre little gypsies.They must smell good or something: loads of things attack them.Even though if they then win, eating trunc flesh makes them puke, or kills them.Poor little refugees.The brainhalf of the autotruncator was in the shadow of long fallen stone and circuitry, watching the triumph of its erstwhile hind limbs.It teetered like a meerkat or a little dinosaur.The brainhalf had taken the truncs only eyes, and the meathalf circled in blind pugnacity, sniffing for more enemies from which to protect its escaped mind.In an act of obscure sentimentality, Scile, with some effort, evaded the trunc meathalfs clawsno small achievement, given that all it was driven to do by its remaining scrag end thoughts was to fightand brought it home.He kept it alive for several days.In the cage he rigged he put down food, and the trunc circled it and snatched mouthfuls as it continued its unending vigilant rounds, though it had no brain to protect.It tried to fight any brushes or cloths that we dangled near it.It died, and broke down very fast like a salted slug, leaving only mess for us to dispose of.At the coin wall, I told Scile about that first encounter with Bren.Id found myself hesitating to take him there or tell him the story, and that piqued me, so I made myself.Scile looked lengthily at the house.Is he still there?I asked a local stallholder.Dont see much of him but hes still there.The man made a finger sign against bad luck.All this beckoning Scile through my childhood.Out at breakfast late one morning, at the end of the square in which we sat, I saw, and pointed out to Scile, a little group of young trainee Ambassadors, on one of their controlled, corralled, protected expeditions into the town for which they would one day intercede.There were five or six of them, it looked like, all from the same batch, ten or twelve children, a few kilohours off puberty, escorted by teachers, security, two adult Ambassadors, a men and a women, whom I could not identify at this distance.The apprentices links winked frenetically.What are they doing?he said.Treasure hunt.Lessons.Dont know, I said.Showing them round their demesne.To my mild embarrassment and the amusement of other diners, Scile stood to watch them go, still chewing the dense Embassytown toast he claimed to love (too ascetic now for me).Do you see that often?Not really, I said.Most of the few times Id seen such groups was as a child myself.If it happened when I was with my friends, we might try to catch the eyes of one or other of the not yet Ambassadors, giggle and run off if we succeeded, chased or not by their escorts.Wed play mocking and somewhat nervous games in their wake, for a few ostentatious minutes.I paid attention to my breakfast and waited for Scile to sit.When he did he said, What do you think about kids?I glanced in the direction the young doppels had taken.Interesting chain of thought, I said.Here, it wouldnt be like...In the country hed been born in, on the world hed been born on, children were mostly raised by between two and six adults, connected to them and each other by direct genetics.Scile had mentioned his father, his mother, his auntfathers or whatever he called them, more than once and with affection.It was a long time since he had seen them: such ties mostly attenuate in the out.I know, he said.I just...He waved at the town.Its nice here.Nice?Theres something here.Something.I can tell words are your business.Anyway were going to pretend that I didnt hear you.Why would I inflict this little place...Oh stop it, really.He smiled with only a little prickle in his voice.You got out, yes, I know.You dont mind it here half as much as you pretend to, Avice.You dont like me that much, to come here if it was purgatory for you.He smiled again.Why would you mind it, anyway?Youre forgetting something.This isnt the out.In Bremen they consider most of what we do herebiorigging aside, and that we get out of the good graces of you know whothuggish field medicine.And that includes sex tech.You do remember how kids get made?You and I dont exactly...He laughed.Point, he said.He took my hand.Compatible everywhere but between sheets.Who said I wanted to do it between sheets?I said.It was a joke, not a seduction.It all feels like prelude, now I reflect on it.The first time I saw exots of species Id not grown up with was in a rowdy town on a tiny world we called Sebzi.I was introduced to a group of hive things.Ive no idea what they were, or from where their race originated.Ive seen none of their kind since.One came forward on a pseudopod, leaned its hourglass body toward me and from a tiny snag toothed ventricle said, in perfect Anglo Ubiq, Ms.Cho.Its a pleasure.Scile reacted to Kedis and Shurasi and Pannegetch, I dont doubt, with more aplomb than I had that time.He gave talks in Embassytowns east, about his work and travels (I was impressed by how he was able to tell the truth but make his life sound coherent, precisely arced).A Kedis troika approached afterwards, colourcells winking in their frills, and the shemale speaker thanked him in her curious diction, shaking his hand with her prehensile genitalia.He introduced himself to the Shurasi shopkeeper we knew as GustyScile ostentatiously and with pleasure told me its actual namestringand cultivated a brief friendship.People were charmed to see them about town, Scile with a companionable arm around Gustys main trunk, the Shurasis cilia scuttling it at Sciles pace.Theyd swap stories.You go on about the immer, Gusty would say.Try travelling by whorl drive.Blimey, that was a journey.I was never able to decide if his mind really was as like ours as the shape of his anecdotes suggested.Certainly he performed our small talk well, even once mimicking the poor Anglo Ubiq of a Kedis neighbour, in a complicated joke.Of course Scile wanted to meet the Ariekei.It was the Ariekei he studied nightly, when he stopped being social.It was they who eluded him.I still cant find out almost anything about them, he said.What theyre like, what they think, what they do, how they work.Even stuff written by Ambassadors describing their work, their, you know, their interactions with the Ariekei, its all...incredibly empty.He looked at me as if he wanted something.They know what to do, he said, but not what it is theyre doing.It took me moments to make sense of his complaint.Its not the Ambassadors job to understand the Hosts, I said.So whose is it?Its no ones job to understand them.I think that was when I first really saw the gap between us.By now we knew Gharda and Kayliegh and others, Staff and those close to them.I had become friends with Ehrsul.She teased me about my lack of profession (she, unlike most Embassytowners, had been au fait with the term floaker before I introduced it), and I teased her right back about the same thing.As autom, Ehrsul had neither rights nor tasks, but so far as it was understood an owner, a settler of some previous generation, had died intestate, and shed never become anyone elses property.There were variants of salvage laws by which someone might theoretically have tried to claim her, but by now it would have seemed abominable.Its just Turingware, Scile said when she wasnt there, though he allowed that it was better such than hed seen before.He was amused by how we related to her.I didnt like his attitude, but he was as polite to her as if he did think her a person, so I didnt pick a fight with him about it.The only real interest he ever showed in Ehrsul was when it occurred to him that, because she did not breathe, she would be able to go into the city.I told him the truth: that she said to me when I asked her about it that she never did or would, that I could not say why, and, given how shed said it, I wasnt minded to ask.She was sometimes asked to tinker with Embassytowns artminds and automa, which would bring her into close contact with Staff: we were often at the same official soires.I was there because I had uses, too.Id been out more recently than any of my superiors: only a few Staff had ever left for official business to Bremen and returned.I was a source, could tell them about the recent politics and culture in Charo City.When Id first left Embassytown, Dad Renshaw had taken me to one sideliterally, hed steered me to the edge of the room in which I was having a farewell party.Id waited for fatherly homilies, spurious rumours about life in the out, but what he had told me was that if I ever came back, Embassytown would be very interested in information on the state of things in Bremen.It was so polite and matter of fact it took me a while to assure myself Id been asked to spy.I was only amused, was all, at the unlikeliness.Then I was ruefully amused again when, thousands of hours later, back in Embassytown, I realised I was making myself useful just as Id been asked to.Scile and I would have been objects of interest whatever we didhe, an intense and fascinated outsider, was a curio; I, part of Language, and a returned immerser, a minor celebrity.But purveying facts about Bremen as I did, I, a commoner, and my commoner husband were welcomed into Staff circles even more smoothly than we would otherwise have been.Our invitations continued after Embassytowns little media stopped running interviews with and stories about the prodigal immerser.They approached me very soon after I returned.Not Ambassadors, of course, but some viziers and high level muck a mucks, requesting my presence at a meeting where they said things so vague I didnt parse their purpose for a minute, until abruptly I remembered Dad Renshaws intercession, and understood that the muted questions about some of the trends in Bremen and associated powers and possible attitudes to dependencies and their aspirations were requests for political intelligence.And that they were offering payment.That last seemed silly.I took no money for telling them what little I could.I waved into silence someones diplomatic explanations of their political concerns: it didnt matter.I showed them newspipes, downloads, gave them perhaps a tiny sense of the balance of power in Bremens ruling Cosmopolitan Democratic party.Bremens wars, interventions and exigencies had never fascinated me, but perhaps to those more focused on them, what I told them might give insights into recent vicissitudes.Honestly I doubt any of it was stuff their artminds and analysts wouldnt have predicted or guessed.It was hardly high espionage drama.A few days later I was introduced to Wyatt, then Bremens new man in Embassytown, whom my Staff interlocutors had mentioned to me in obliquely warning fashion.He immediately teased me about that earlier meeting.He asked if I had a camera in his bedroom, or something like that.I laughed.I liked it when we crossed paths.He gave me a personal number.It was in circles such as this, Embassytown society, that I met Ambassador CalVin and became their lover.One of the things they did for me was give Scile an opportunity to meet the Hosts.CalVin were tall, grey skinned men, a little older than me, with a certain playfulness, and the charming arrogance of the best Ambassadors.They invited me, and, at my request, Scile, to functions, and would come in turn into the town with us, where an Ambassador walking the streets without a Staff retinue was uncommon enough to attract attention.Ambassador, Scile worked up courage to ask them, at first cautiously, I have a question about your...exchanges with the Hosts.And then into some minutely specific, arcane enquiry.CalVin, earning at that time my gratitude, were patient, though their answers were doubtless disappointing.In CalVins company I saw, heard and intuited details about aspects of Embassytown life I never otherwise would have.I picked up on my lovers momentary references, hints and asides.They wouldnt always answer me when I pressed themthey might say something about colleagues gone astray, or Ariekene factions, and then refuse to elaboratebut I learnt even just from overhearing.I asked them about Bren.I dont see him often, I said.He doesnt seem to come to gatherings.Id forgotten youve a connection with him, CalVin said, both eyeing me, though in slightly different ways.No, Brens rather self exiled.Not that hed ever leave, you understand.That wouldnt fit with what he thinks he is, to the rest of us.And he had the chance.He could have left.After he was cleaved.Instead...They laughed.Hes sort of our licensed misery.He knows most of what goes on.And further afield, toohe knows things he really shouldnt.You couldnt call him loyal.But hes useful.But you really couldnt call him loyal, anymore, if he ever was.Scile listened avidly to them.Whats it like?Scile asked me.I mean, Ive been with two people before and Im sure you have too, but I dont think thats  No, Pharoi, no.Lord, youre terrible.Its not the same at all.I was adamant at the time: now I have doubts.Do they both concentrate on you?he said.We giggled, he at the silly prurience, me at what felt almost like blasphemy.No, its all very egalitarian.Cal, me and Vin, all in it together.Honestly, Scile, its not like Im the only person an Ambassadors ever  Youre the only one Ive got access to, though.By then I wasnt sure that was true.I thought homosex isnt approved of, he said.Now youre just showing off, I said.Thats not what they do together.Them or any of the Ambassadors.You know that.Its...masturbation.That was the common if scandalous description, and it made me feel like a kid to say it.Imagine what its like when two Ambassadors get together.Scile spent hours, many hours, listening to recordings of Ariekei speaking, watching trids and flats of encounters between them and the Ambassadors.I watched him mouth things to himself and write illegible notes, one handedly input into his datspace.He learnt fast.That was no surprise to me.When at last CalVin invited us to an event at which the Hosts would be present, Scile understood Language pretty much perfectly.It was to be one of the discussions Ambassadors held with Hosts every few weeks.Interworld trade might come only every few thousand hours, but it was backed by and built on exhaustive, careful negotiation.With the arrival of each immership, terms agreed between Staff and Hosts (with the imprimatur of Bremens representative) were communicated, the vessel would leave with those details and Ariekene goods and tech, returning on its next round with whatever we had promised the Ariekei in return.They were patient.Theres a reception, one of CalVin told us.Would you like to come?We were not allowed into the actual negotiations, of course.Scile regretted this.Why do you care?I said.Itll be dull as hell.Trade talks?Really?How much of this, what do you want of that...I want to know, thats exactly it.What is it they want?Do you even know what we exchange with them?Expertise, mostly.For AI and artminds and things.That they cant make...I know, because of Language.But Id love to hear how they relate to that tech, when they get hold of it.An Ariekes couldnt type into an artmind, of course: writing was incomprehensible to them.Oral input was no better: as far as any exopsych specialists could discern, the Hosts couldnt ken interacting with a machine.The computer would speak back to them in what we heard as flawless vernacular, but to the Ariekei, with no sentience behind them, those words were just noises.So our designers had created computers that were eavesdroppers.We built them from the simple loudhailer  and telephone animals the Ariekei biorigged.They couldthough no one made sense of howunderstand each others voices (and those of our Ambassadors) through speakers or even recorded: so long as what was or had been said had that sentience, a genuine mind speaking it, neither distance nor time degraded its compre hensibility, its meaningness, what Scile had provocatively called the soul.We took those little mediators and upgraded, altered and sometimes ultimately replaced them with communication tech the Hosts could not have created.We routed their voices through artminds.The programs were designed to work between interlocutors, to create their own instructions by insinuation.The Ariekei spoke to each other as they always had, and if their conversations took certain theoretical turns, the ware would listen in, make calculations, alter production, perform automated tasks.Just what the Ariekei understood to be occurring was of course beyond me, but they knew, I was told, that we had given them somethingthey paid for it, after all.And what do we get?
