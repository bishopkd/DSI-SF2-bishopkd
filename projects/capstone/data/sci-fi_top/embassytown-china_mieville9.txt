It was joint patrols that didnt work.Youll see what we do now.This is different.Anyway, what would you rather?We cant just leave them to come in...And havent you seen?He gesticulated again after Ez.I can make them do anything I want.Well...Well, anyway thats not really the point.I do, we do want protections around the city, we need it, but thats not the real point.The real point is the squads that go out.Ive been thinking a lot.He waved a hand at his throat, his voice.About this.Ive been thinking how to use it.I know why the first patrols went wrong: we just ordered them to patrol.That was much too vague.Tasks, though, thats different.Specifics.With beginnings and endings.What tasks are you going to set them, EzCal?I said.The slip, calling Cal that, wasnt deliberate.Youll see.And youll be impressed, I think.Im not operating like you think I am.I know what you think I am, Avice.I walked away.It was just unbearable.I DIDN'T CAL, with Ez, inspect his Ariekene troopswhat a pantomime.I heard he made MagDa his assistant, had them talk for him.EzCal couldnt do it: it would have created a comedy of overwhelmed squaddies mindlessly attempting to obey every word, whether it was an order or not.There were, in fact, some thousands.An unprecedented gathering.Through MagDa, Cal organised them into ranks, and squadrons, and units, each with its own commander.There wasnt as much of the chaos as Id expected when our new defenders went to their outposts.They werent enough.The Absurd army outnumbered them by several times.I didnt yet understandhad ignored him telling methat this warcraft and panicked pomp was a minor part of Cals intentions.I didnt even notice that MagDa were gone for two days, alongside others, part of a squad I imagine EzCal gave some carefully chosen name.While they were, without knowing they were, I went again with YlSib to Spanish Dancer, as the army of Absurd approached.Id had enough of inevitability.In the city, outside Embassytown, it felt, even illusorily, as if more than one outcome was possible.EZCAL SUMMONED US to a lecture hall.I went to that meeting, as I did to all of them, feeling like a spy.Not wholly misleading.The committee was depleted.In steeply banking rows of chairs we looked down at EzCal in the centre.I sat by Southel and Simmon.MagDa was with EzCal, their faces scuffed with injuries.By them was , and there were other Hosts in corners.Wed like to start with a silence, Cal said, for officers Bayley and Kotus, who gave their lives on this mission, for the sake of Embassytown.We waited.Lets make sure it wasnt in vain.Bring them in.There was a commotion.We gasped and swore and drew back.What the guards entered and brought before us were enemies.Two deafened Absurd.They were held in cuffs.They eyed us, their eyes in polyp motion.Their legs and giftwings shook in constraints.They tested their tethers with cunning.We watched them.Cal circled the captives, pointing out the injuries of the wilderness, the flanges of the ripped out fanwing.He pointed at each thing he described with a long thin stick.He was like a picture of an ancient lecturer, in some pre diaspora centre of learning.The attackers made noises as he rounded them.Calls that sounded like halloos, like calls to gods.and the other Ariekei in the room watched them and kept up their own constant movement, twitches in a disgust echo of the prisoners strainings.Our people had tracked a group of Absurd broken off from the main oncoming army to raid an isolated settlement.Thered been a fight.Thered been deaths on both sides.At last, Cal said, after unprecedented cooperation between the Terre and our Ariekene allies wed subdued and taken these Absurd alive.We need to understand them, Cal said.So we can defeat them.We were here to take notes, to learn Languageless behaviour.By experiments before cams in sealed rooms; by interactions gbetween the Absurd and our allies, that would not be interactions but actions from and its coterie, and ignored by the Absurd; or if responded to in such ways that they were not discernible to us as reactions at all.The solipsism of those that had torn out their own fanwings seemed impenetrable.Perhaps some on the committee believed Cals assertion that we were preparing to defeat them, but seeing him cajole speaking through MagDa again to avoid the tedium of repeatedly enthralling the Ariekes allyto speak to the Absurd, which they pointlessly attempted, making MagDa try it too, I think there must have been many who knew, as I did then, that his hope was to negotiate.But they were thousands whod closed all windows in and out of themselves, cut off Language, become monads full of murder.No knowledge we had could make much difference.With the scrags of Wyatts arsenal and Cals Ariekene force we might kill some, but the city was still shrinking, inhabitants dying, self mutilating, running to nearby settlements where speakers would broadcast the god drug voice.There were more Absurd than Ariekei that would fight by us.MagDa spoke in Language; then one or other would say, They cant even fucking hear us, while the Absurd snarled.So show them, Cal said.Make them understand.And this exchange would continue and mutate, upsetting and pointless.The whole Ariekes would repeat its words: MagDa and the other Ambassadors would make gestures with their hands.Our enemies came closer.The Languageless pulled against their bonds.They watched their interlocutors, ignoring overtures and focusing on actions.I saw sudden shared moments of attention, responding to idiosyncrasies of s motion invisible to me.The Absurd glared at each other.They made noises without knowing it.They got each others attention with spread out eye tines, made motions to indicate things to notice.To the extent that they could, they moved, taking up positions while Cal and Ez flashed up images on screens, played vibrations to them through the floor.They walked, triangulated, parted.I didnt say anything fast enough, but when they suddenly tried to attack an Ariekes guard I realised Id known it was about to happen.They were subdued before they could use their own strapped bodies as ungainly bludgeons, but the synchronicity of their movements astounded me.It sent me back to my husbands books.HOW DO YOU SAY that in Language?I asked Bren.Like that one.I pointed.Which glass do you want?That one.It would depend.He looked at the glass by his counter.Talking about that one, I might say...No I dont mean any specific one, but in general, that one.Pointing.Or that one.Moving my hand.Thatness.Theres nothing.No?Of course not.Thought so.So how would I distinguish that glass and that one and that one?I tallied them with my finger.Youd say the glass in front of the apple and the glass with a flaw in its base and the glass with a residue of wine left in it.You know this.What are you asking?They taught you these basics, didnt they?They did, I said.I was quiet a while.Years ago.I spoke in years again, not kilohours.But if you were translating an Ariekes saying, The glass with the apple and the one with the wine, to me, youd probably just say, That glass and that one.Sometimes translation stops you understanding.Im not fluent.Maybe thats helping me right now.Translation always stops you understanding, he said.What is it youre thinking?How many days before they get here?I said.Can you get hold of YlSib?And others?Any you can?He narrowed his eyes but nodded.We need to go.Get YlSib or whoever to contact Spanish Dancer and the others.Ill I stopped.I dont know, I said.I dont know whether...Maybe I can tell Cal.Tell me, Bren said.I thought youd despaired.I did too.What, then?Tell me.I told him.Revelation was spoiled for him, but I can retain it here, for you.Bren nodded, and listened to what I cant call a planit was hunch and hopeand when I was done he said, No, we cant tell Cal.He touched me under the chin, and put his arms around me, and for a moment I let him take my weight and it was lovely.Of course we cant.But were trying to fix things, I said.You know EzCal arent stupid...Its not about whether theyre stupid, he said.Its about who they are, and what they represent.Maybe Cal would see reason.Maybe.But I dont think so, do you?Want to risk it, really?If we go, hell find out.Yes.And see you as an enemy.And hell be right.Dont think hetheywont find time to try to stop us.Alright then, I said.Ill be an enemy.He smiled at me.What else are we going to do, Avice?We turned arm in arm to look at the screen on which the captive Languageless tried to shuffle, alone in their room, watched by cams.It was a quiet moment for our banishing, as we got ready to exile ourselves.We saw the two Ariekei our rulers held moving not quite like two things unconnected, but according to something else; not a plan but a knowledge of each other; a community.24  I WAS STILL OF some cultural interest.So was Bren, the free cleaved, troublemaker, licensed dissident.If we disappeared together people would notice.And we might already be watched.That was why the next time, the last time, I went into the city alone.While the committee fretted and Cal took what power wed had, Embassytown streets got on with things.Walking through my shrunken town with my aeoli and supplies, I was surprised to pass more than one outdoor party.Some shiftparents of the playing children saw me watching and caught my eye, and even the poignancy of that, of knowing together that this was a last game to keep those children occupied, didnt detract from a moments pleasure.There were constables on the streets but not much for them to do except wait for the war: they didnt police with fervour.They didnt clear out the proselytisers, the, I dont know, Shakers, Quakers, Makers, Takers, each with their own theology damning or rescuing us.They werent treated, even the most brimstone of them, as threats or pests, but as performers.People teased them, while they remained doggedly devout.I wanted to stop, to ask someone to join me at a cafe where they were giving away free drinks or accepting the little IOUs we proffered in polite charade.The usual lament: I may be some time.The wistfulness of we who are about to leave.I got out of Embassytown close to where Yohn and Simmon and the others and I had held our breath and where Id touched a tether.I exited through the corridors of a border house, alone.On my chart were marked various colonies of city Ariekei, each annotated, the latest information Bren could gather.1: Heartland..Loyal.To my left.2: Status uncertain.3: Contributed to troop but dispute with .4: Communalistic?5, and on.I knew the displayed boundaries were all porous.As the Absurd approached, those little polities got more insular, their between fix politics and cultures more divergent, the streets that separated them much worse.I wasnt at all safe.The first few hundred metres altbrocks had ambled, Id heard bird wings and been with insects.Now I was in the territories of local fauna, with at least two names: our vernacular; their markers in Language.I stood still for a dog sized thing we called a browngun, which the Ariekei termed or depending on a taxonomic distinction we never understood.It crossed my path with an urchin frog tongue gait.Overhead passed the scraps and biorigged machines, wild, or carrying Ariekei.I could navigate immer but this geography nearly defeated me.It was dangerous in no persons lands, and it would be more so at the settlements, where Id be threatened not by the random rages of the mindless but by the guarding of borders.With this new tribalism inhabitants of different areas sometimes fought.More than once I had had to hunker beyond a house bone or a trash pile, watching such violence.My breath was short with fear.Around a convolute, half hearing the diaphragmatic burr of this neighbourhood, I stopped abruptly.There were two men in front of me.They saw me and raised rifles.I couldnt see their faces through the visors of their aeoli.The incongruity of Terre figures right there stopped me for a dangerous moment but I moved, just before they fired, and bullets thumped into the ventricle or alley where Id been.I ran.I heard them behind me.I shoved beneath underhangs, lost myself.I grit my teeth, my heart slamming.I wasnt panicked.My thoughts were precise.I turned fast at another noise.Someone human was reaching for me from a doorway like gills.I staggered back but he put his finger to his mask, in a shhh face, and beckoned.I went to him and he pulled me into a chamber.We sat, listening.I stared at him, but he wasnt memorable in any way.I scanned him like I might decode him.Are you alright?he whispered.Yes.I started to say Who are you?or Who were they?but he shook his head.He listened again.Come with me, he said at last.I tried to ask again who he was, but he still didnt answer.He didnt owe me any explanation, I supposed, after all.I let him lead me, creeping.At the end of a long detour, Yl and Sib were waiting.They greeted him tersely.The three of them confabulated too quietly for me to hear.The man turned and raised his hand to me briefly as he left.His names Shonas, Sib said.He was a vizier once.Hes been in the city for about eight years.We headed cautiously back toward my original intended route.Whys he here?I said.And who shot at me?A lintel arced to let us in.He came here after a breakdown between him and an Ambassador, YlSib said.It was a bit of a scandal.He disappeared.You were in immer probably.In the out.You wouldnt remember.As if.The other two were DalTon.I dont remember being surprised.Those dashing dissidents Id assumed dead, cleaved, or incarcerated in that terrible infirmary.They went away.They went weird.Shonas came into the city to stop them, and......Well.Hes on our side.Against Ambassador DalTon.We hadnt heard from those bastards for a long time until all this started, dont know what theyve been working on.Theyre pigs in shit, now.They must love all this.They got wind of your plan.A parallel economy of narratives, counterfights and revenge.How do they know what Ive got planned?I said.Word gets out.What the fuck does that mean?Come on.Stories get out.They might not know anything except youre coming to the city.Which would mean you have a plan.Which whatever it is theyre against.Are they working with Cal?With EzCal?What?Because they tried to stop you?YlSib glanced at me.Just because Cal would try to stop you too?Its hardly the same thing.DalTon have their own reasons for everything.Which are?I said.Oh there are so many reasons out there, YlSib said, exhaustedly.Who can keep track of them all?Pick one.They arent your friend.Wont that do?No.Theyre tired of all of it.And youre not.And youre trying.Hows that?Dal and Ton, nihilist since the crisis and before.It was a vindication that they thought me worth attacking.Ask Cal if hed rather Embassytown be destroyed or survive without him, hed claim the latter and mean it: but hed go to his grave, and all our graves, to stop me, when he knew my plan, because it would undermine him.DalTon wanted to stop me because I wanted to save the world.Im sure it made much more and coherent sense to them, with their long, furious self exile.There were kilohours of story there Id never know.DalTon were against me, Cal was against me, DalTon were against Cal, Shonas was against DalTon, Shonas was for me but not against Cal, and so on.I never, in Embassytown, the immer or the out, had the constitution for intrigue.Floaking, Id hoped, was a way around it.But politics finds you.How many are there?I said.Outcasts.In the city.Yl and Sib said nothing.My plans to save Embassytown were briefly part of what happened to DalTon and Shonas, and the drama of the revenge of the ex Ambassador and their onetime vizier had happened to me.I was grateful to Shonas for my life.Its on its way, YlSib told me.What do you call it?Spanish Dancer.I know, its rude of me, I said.Ill stop using that name.Why?It doesnt care and neither do we.The room was small.Windowless of course, illuminated by fronds that glowed.Theres power, I said.No.The lights emitted by a necrophage in the walls.Come on, I said.The building was dying and we were lit by that.I could only laugh.I asked again, but YlSib wouldnt tell me what had sent them hundreds of thousands of hours ago out of Embassytown, to live behind aeoli masks in that exile microculture.We waited.More city Hosts are leaving, YlSib said.And plenty of them are going to join the Absurd.There wont be many left to guard, even if theyre prepared to.They wont have any choice.EzCalll order them to.Whats your plan?What is it you want to do?You know what, I said.Bren told you.The truth was I didnt know to explain it.When Spanish Dancer arrived, I said, Look.Ill show you.I remembered the way the captive Languageless had moved.The Absurd were closing in and there was no point waiting for Bren.With YlSibs help, their careful translation, very slowly at first, we started.I, against every inclination Id had for many years, had no choice but to take control.I DONT THINK urgency is a bacillus that can cross exotypes, but it was as if the Ariekei understood that something in me had changed.They and I fervently engaged.I remembered them in The Cravat, fascinated in me and all the other similes.You want to lie, I said to Spanish Dancer.I spoke quickly: Show me what you can do.How close are you?Lets start again.I spent hours listening to it and its group perform their little untruths, through YlSibs translations.I made notes and strained to remember how  had done what it had done.That seemed to me the key.Id talked about it with Bren.Often  had wordplayed, eroding qualifying clauses until what was left was a sudden surprising lie.But that method, however well done, was a sideshow.s theoretical focus had been on me.It had seen usus similes made of Terre, not merely us similesas key to some more fundamental and enabling not truth.Its signature mendacity, spoken with dandy lan though only a word trick, hinted at that shift born of contact.Before the humans came we didnt speak so much of certain things.Before the humans came we didnt speak so much.Before the humans came we didnt speak.Through a dissembling made of omitted clauses it laid out its manifesto.Before the humans came we didnt speak: so we will, can, must speak through them.It made that falsity a true aspiration., insisting on a certain might be, changed what was.It had learnt to lie to insist on a truth.So, I said to Spanish Dancer, and the companions that had joined it.Lets follow Surl Tesh echer.YlSib translated.The Ariekei reacted.It pointed where to go.You know me.Im the girl hurt in darkness who ate what was given to her.Tell me what Im like, and well get to what I am.I gave them their nicknames.Spanish Dancer, Toweller, Baptist, Duck.Id say their names and point and even smileyou never know, you dont know what they have or havent clocked.Their battery beasts skipped about as we worked.All these Ariekei could lie, a bit.They were followers of the greatest liar in their history.I helped them leave things out, whisper clauses, with wilful misdescriptions.Before the humans came.I had YlSib repeat s claim.The Ariekei failed: the lie code jammed their minds.What colour?Id say, holding up rags or plastic.They would bud and unbud their eyes.After hours their attention went.Duck was shuddering, Toweller was humming and emitting piping sounds.I understood.We had no datchips.The Ariekei had to go to the street to wait for the loudspeakers.Inside, we couldnt hear the broadcast but we felt the house quiver.Yl and Sib and I looked at each other, and I think we were all imagining our students stampeding to the nearest voice point, perhaps fighting off the mindless, perhaps beating each other in their need, as EzCal spoke.How come youre behind this?I said to YlSib.I mean, if it works, it changes things for you...What do we lose?An expertise?And whats gained?By everyone?Whats our expertise done for us?They looked down again.Bren had told me hed hated his doppel, with a quiet hate.The sight of YlSibs exhaustion, how they didnt look at each other, made me wonder if that was the condition of all Ambassadors.When the Ariekei returned they were calm again.Continue, one said.I nodded exaggeratedly and said Yes.I said it again, slowly.What I was trying for was a break, a rupture, a move from before to after.A tipping point that, like all such, could only be a mystery.WHAT AM I LIKE?Whats like me?YlSib rendered my question and the answers.Youre the girl who was hurt in the dark and ate what was given to her.The scavengers that come to our houses latrines to feed are like the girl eating what was given to her.Charming.I willed them to strive for poetry.Closed my eyes.They asserted similarities.I didnt let them stop.After quite a time their suggestions grew more interesting.They overreached: the conversation was full with stillborn similes.The rocks are like the girl who was hurt in the dark because...The dead are like the girl who...Young are like the girl who was hurt in the dark and ate...Finally and suddenly, Spanish Dancer spoke.Were trying to change things and its been a long time and through our patience knowing itll end were like the girl who ate what was given to her, YlSib translated.Those who arent trying to change anything are like the girl, eating not what she wanted but what was given to her.I opened my mouth.The tall Ariekes leaned over me, multiple unblinking.Oh, my God, it knows, I said.What Im trying to do.Did you hear?Yes.Yes.It made me two different, contradictory things.Compared them to me.Yes.They were more cautious than me, but I smiled till they couldnt not smile back.WE BROKE OFF LATE, when the Ariekei grew so needy for the god drug voice they couldnt work anymore, withdrew into shaking confusion.I slept uncovered on the slightly giving floor, until Yl or Sib shook me awake and gave me some inadequate breakfast.I could tell by the translucence of the tower skin that it was day again.My pupils were there, better: EzCal had given their morning broadcast.YlSib told me EzCal had discovered I was gone.They were searching for me.Squads were in the city.You arent just out alone anymore, they said.Youre on the run.Youre hiding.They didnt have to say One of us.All day we worked at the inadequate similes of the Ariekei.It got me exhausted and impatient.As it grew dark I heard the moist opening of the room, and Bren came in.I took hold of him passionately, and he kissed me but held me back.I broke off when I saw what followed him.He had with him one of the Absurd.Its been a bastard journey.He laughed very shortly.The thing was weak.Bren had it at the end of a rigid prod and shackles that coursed constantly with current.Otherwise it would easily have overcome him.The Languageless thing was wounded from that constant burning.Its giftwing was strapped to it, its legs were hobbled.Id known this was the plan, but I couldnt believe Bren had succeeded.Christ, I said.How did you do it?Oh, Jesus, look at it.This is horrible.You look like a torturer.Yes it really is, he said.Spanish Dancer and the other Ariekei surrounded it.It strained and failed to reach for them.They tottered back, came forward, morbidly curious, it looked like.How is it in Embassytown?I said.Theyre afraid, he said.They probably think you and I are working for the enemy.Or theyre saying they do.The Absurd?I said.Thats...Absurd, yes.Its crazy.You know how they are, he said.People would say it even as they knew it made little sense.They were right to be afraid.The Absurd were coming.How did you get it?In all the ways you can imagine, Bren said.False papers, bribery, misdirection, intimidation.Creeping at midnight.Violence.All that.Now we can actually test things, I said.Bren took datchips from his bag.Here, he said.This lot can have a bit of control over themselves.So youre not totally beholden to the broadcasts.We can get them out of here.Why exactly do you want them to lie?Yl or Sib said.I stared at them.They hadnt understood at all.Theyd thrown their lot in with a plan just because it was a plan.Its what the lying means, Bren said to them.Why do you think were leaving the city?They shrugged.Its about how symbols work for them, I said.I never thought we could shift that.But you know what made me change my mind?That there are already Ariekei whove done it.I pointed at the captive.Theyve managed to do what Surl Tesh echer and Spanish Dancer and this lot have wanted to do for years.Theyve got new minds.And theyre using them to kill us.IT WAS THE freakish precision with which the Absurd coordinated attacks that had started me thinking.They were communicating: there was no other explanation for such efficient murder.Languageless, they still needed and made community, though they might not have known thats what they were doing: each probably believed itself trapped in vengeful solitude even as the violence they committed together disproved it.Id seen them gesticulate.Their commandos or commanders indicating with their giftwings.The Absurd had invented pointing.With the point theyd conceived a that.Theyd given the jag of the body, the out thrust limb, power to refer.That that was the key.From it had followed other soundless words.That.That?No, not that: that.Each word of Language meant just what it meant.Polysemy or ambiguity were impossible and with them most tropes that made other languages languages at all.But thatness faces every way: its flexible because its empty, a universal equivalent.That always means and not that other, too.In their lonely silent way, the Absurd had made a semiotic revolution, and a new language.It was base and present tense.But its initial single word was actually two: that and not that.And from that tiny and primal vocabulary, the motor of that antithesis spun out other concepts: me, you, others.The code theyd created was quite unlike the precise mapping theyd grown up knowing.But it was Language that was the anomaly: this new crude thing of flailing fingers and murderous stamping was closer by far to what we spoke, was at last cousin tongue to those of sentients across the immer.We could never learn to speak Language, I said.We only ever pretended.Instead the Absurd have learnt to speak like us.The Ariekei in this room want to lie.That means thinking the world differently.Not referring: signifying.I thought that was impossible.But look.I pointed at the thing that wanted to kill me.Thats what theyve done.Every time they point, they signify.So far the price is way too high.But now we know Ariekei can do it.And teaching this lot that without taking their wings means teaching them to lie.Similes start...transgressions.Because we can refer to anything.Even though in Language, everythings literal.Everything is what it is, but still, I can be like the dead and the living and the stars and a desk and fish and anything.Surl Tesh echer knew that was Language straining to...bust out of itself.To signify.Thats why it had, with so strange a strategy, come at lying through us.I hadnt brought Sciles books with me but Id gone over them many times, learnt from and argued with them, and I knew what I needed to.I had to be hurt and fed to be speakable, because it had to be true.But what they say with me...Thats true because they make it.Similes are a way out.A route from reference to signifying.Just a route, though.But we can push them down it, even that last step, all the way.It became clearer to me as I spoke.To where the literal becomes...I stopped.Something else.If similes do their job well enough, they turn into something else.We tell the truth best by becoming lies.Not paradoxes, I wanted to say; these werent paradoxes, they werent nonsense.I dont want to be a simile anymore, I said.I want to be a metaphor.Part Eight  THE PARLEY    25  WE HEARD STRANGE SOUNDS, and saw vessels rising, heading out of Embassytown and the city.Most were corvids crossbred of biorigging and bloodless tech.There were spiny church sized hulks among them, older than Embassytown.I cant believe they got those things up, I said.Theyre not as fierce as they look, Bren said.They were survey ships once.Its all theatre.Even with the, whisper it, Bremen arsenal, we dont have a hope.Bren had once, with his doppel, been party to hidden arrangements.Theyd debriefed spies and double  and triple agents.Wyatt was clever, he said.He did exactly the right amount and kind of not talking about what he had access to to make it scary.But it was nothing.The fleet lumbered away on their doomed sorties.Taking off my aeoli in the sealed air breathing room, seeing the Ariekei wait for me, I was exhausted, and had to close my eyes.OUR OWN FLIGHT from the city was complicated: between four Terre and the Ariekei we were able to push and pull our Absurd prisoner with us, but not easily.It had berserker strength.We had to administer charges to it often, and tug it hurting from the punishment.Lets leave it, said Yl.Cant, said Bren.He was the most assiduous of us in trying to communicate with it, whenever we stopped.He got nowhere.It hardly looked at him, focused its enraged attention on the addicted Ariekei.Theyre going into battle, Bren said, indicating the sky.Its pointless but I respect them for it a bit.EzCal are going to fight.Efforts at negotiation were stillborn and the Absurd came closer.Refugee Terre from arable outposts were trekking to Embassytown.The journey overwhelmed many of them, and left their bodies to degrade from within in suits and biorigging, into mulch that wouldnt fertilise this soil.EzCal are wondering if they can just fight their way out of all this.As if pugnacity could outweigh the simplicity of numbers.Ill give them this, Bren said.EzCal will be on the field.It was Ez who insisted.The bloody convivials are over.Back home its...bad.Id left only a few tens of hours ago, but now it was the day after the parties.Poor Embassytown.WE TOOK EVASIVE ways but there were too many of us to be really secretive.We relied on the chaos that Embassytown and the city were accelerating in each other.We crawled through tunnels between bones, and waited and shocked our captive into stupor when we saw patrols of Ariekei, humans, or both, clearing the streets, shooting the mindless.It was difficult, peering across skin plateaus to where constables of our race and Ariekei enforced a brutal order.YlSib had repeatedly to whisper You must be quiet to Spanish Dancer and its companions.I made frantic arm movements to hush them, which of course they didnt understand.More flyers went over our heads.We hid from regiments on the way to the front.I kept up efforts to teach.We tried to shield our Ariekene companions from the sounds of the speakers when EzCals (now prerecorded) utterings beganwe holed up and they listened instead to the datchips wed brought, dosing themselves in small triumph, defeating the tyranny of god drugs rhythms while their fellow citizens stampeded for the voice.I dont know how they kept track of which chip each of them had heard and was therefore spent to them.Our prisoner could see what they were doing, as they hunched, fanwings spread.I imagine that it looked with disgust.Certainly it strained in its shackles.We quickly had our catechism.I drew it from what Spanish Dancer had said.I whispered it in Anglo Ubiq; YlSib spoke it in Language.Bren, I saw, mouthed the simile of me that hed first spoken a long time ago.Youre trying to change things, I said.YlSib repeated in Language.You want change like the girl who ate what was anything are like the girl who didnt eat what she wanted but what was given to her: theyre like me.Youre like that girl who ate.You are the girl who ate.Youre like the girl.You are the girl.And so are the others, who arent like you.The first time YlSib moved from you are like to you are the Ariekei started very visibly.That succulently strange lie you are, born out of the truth, you are like, that theyd already asserted.And its contradiction, too, their enemies as like me as they were.We showed them how their own arguments came close to making liars of them.ADDICTED VEHICLES galloped by us into the wilderness.In the morning YlSib took us to a transporter.It was blunt and ugly but full of breathable air.We rode an unseen pillow of vented particles following the tracks of the Embassytown and city troops.In empty suburbs were scattered gangs of zelles, their Ariekei dead, looking forlornly for things to power.Bren drove our mongrel conveyance.It was nowhere near as fast as the military craft that had gone out, but it exceeded our walking pace, punted on its way by swinging side limbs like gondoliers poles.Through hollowed out window eyes I watched the city recede.At first there were outskirt dwellings and warehouses descending into muck, but they ended and the sky came down to meet us.We raised dust.Spined bushes shuffled out of our way, so paths opened for us in the fields, stretching for many metres ahead then began to fracture, to branch off in the possible directions we might take.The Ariekene battery beasts moved around my legs.Behind us the shrubs crawled back to their previous positions.The city was a line of towers, rotund halls like unplanted bulbs.It receded.I looked at it a long time.I shielded my eyes as if that made for magic binoculars, but I couldnt see through it to the smoke or Terre towerblocks of Embassytown.I wondered if there were travellers among the Ariekei, and where if anywhere were other cities from which and to where they might go.I couldnt believe I didnt know.The zelles grew restive before their owners: they were less able to fight their addiction.Over the hours, the Ariekei huddled as low as their intricate bulks allowed against the pipes and lights in the vehicle.One by one they enfolded their fanwings over datchips.YOU ARE LIKE the girl, you are the girl.They are like the girl, they are the girl., YlSib said to them: Repeat it.We are like the girl, the Ariekei said.You are the girl, YlSib said, and the Ariekei scuttled, an excitement that pleased me.They couldnt do it but understood, in some alien abstract, what they were trying to do.The girl...some said, and some...we...or...us...or...its like...Poor YlSib, poor Spanish.I was relentless.Whats that?Id seen something scatter a trail kilometres behind us.There was another motion mark, to the west, and soon overhead was another tiny gusting machine.A very few other transports followed us, got closer and visible.A many wheeled cart on liquid suspension; a truck all Terretech but for biorigged weapons; one person centaurs, headless equine frames at the front of each of which sat an aeolied woman or man.A glider climbed thermals.Bren stopped us.YlSib got out as the exodus approached.Other vehicles slowed too.Other drivers and pilots peered out of their windows.Behind me, hidden in our machine, the Absurd hissed, unhearing its own self.The escapees were like YlSib: city exiles.Runaway Staff, I imagined, as well as those not fleeing such grandiose pasts.The glider landed and Shonas leaned out.I wondered where DalTon were.The city dwellers were wary, but they mostly knew each other, greeted each other and swapped brief information about the Absurd, and the Embassytown and city forces.When we drove on again, we did so together in a little entourage.The glider overhead signalled to us with its wings and wing lights.Tell Spanish to come here, I said to YlSib.Tell it what I say.I pointed out of the chariots eyes.Spanish and upward at the machine above us, I, then YlSib, said.Sometimes when I spoke for the Ariekei, I unthinkingly mimicked the precision of Language as translated into Anglo Ubiq.The vessel overhead, the colours on its wings, the way they moveits telling us things.Its talking to us.Spanish Dancer looked with some of its eyes at the plane, with some of them at YlSib, and with one at me.I stared at that eye.YlSibve told you, but do you know its me speaking?I thought.It doesnt understand, Yl or Sib said.It can tell Im not lying, I think, but it can tell that the planes not talking to us either.But it is, I said.WHEN DAWN CAME we veered, to avoid EzCals force, to bypass the camp.Come on, come on, Bren said to himself.We were desperate to reach the Absurd before the combined troops did.Theyre in no hurry, said Bren.Well overtake them.They dont want to fight anywaytheyre going to try to negotiate.The problem is, I said, they cant.I could still see the glider.The other craft were behind, close enough for us to wave at their drivers.By midmorning gas trees filled the plateau ahead, a canopy of thousands of house size fleshbags bobbing in breezes, straining at the ground.One by one the other craft peeled away from behind us.Hey, I said.They cant come through here, Bren said.Only the three centaurs were with us now.YlSib looked nervously at each other.Bren, said one.Theyre little, were not.We cant go through here either.Not secretly.Well leave tracks...Have you not been listening?he said.He yanked at the controls and if anything accelerated.We dont have any time.We have to get there fast.So please get to work.You should be teaching.Because it isnt enough for us to get there: we have a job to do when we do.But it was impossible to concentrate as we approached the forest.Some of the trees moved weakly out of our way, hauled by roots, but most were too slow.I braced.The carriages jutting legs scythed through rope trunks.In our passing trees soared straight up, dangling their broken tethers.We left a line of them accelerating skyward as we cut into the woodland.Through the rear windows I saw the centaurs carrying their riders over the coiled stumps we left behind.There wasnt much debris: it had flown away.Beyond this forest and then a few kilometres, Bren said, voice shaking with our motion.Thats where the armies are.Bloated treetops buffeted each other above.There were darks and shadows of layered variety around us, in which, I abruptly thought, there might be anything: Ariekene ruins, such impossible things.In our wake was a wedge of sky into which the dislodged trees rose in strict formation until they reached wind and scattered.It was because of that gap in the forest that I saw the plane twisting in dogfight turns.Somethings happening, I said.We craned to see it curve up and the weapons below its nose flare, against another, attacking flyer.Fucking Pharotekton damn, Bren said.We couldnt hide.Wherever we veered wed announce our route in soaring trees, so we did nothing but try to increase our speed, the centaur riders jabbing rifles behind us.Detonations sounded and from the tops of explosion clouds bobbed trees and their ragged remains tugging tails of smoke matter and vegetation.Shonas, in his glider, fired.For a moment I thought we were being chased down by his enemy DalTon, that I was collateral in someone elses drama, but the attacker flew jack knifes no human could have piloted.EzCal had ordered an Ariekene vessel to take us, to stop us reaching the army they must realise was our destination.The centaurs scattered into bladdery undergrowth.I heard YlSib jabbering Language.They were telling Spanish Dancer what was happening.Maybe I can...Bren said, and I wondered what plan he had.The glider caromed across our field of vision into the ground, burst in a splash of rising trees.Yl and Sib howled to see Shonass death.I hadnt believed, not really, that EzCal would spare a craft for this, for us, now.I screamed and the ground under us burst.I WOKE TO NOISE.I coughed and cried out and looked into the many eyes of an Ariekes.Above it I saw our ripped up chassis letting the sky and swaying vegetation through.Beside me was the motionless face of another Ariekes, dead.I thought for moments I was dying.I pulled my aeoli mask up, as the living Ariekes tugged me with its giftwing and pulled me from the overturned vehicle, through a big rip.It wasnt many seconds since wed been wrecked, I realised.I stumbled and leaned on Spanish Dancer.We were in a crater, edged by vegetation stretching up on frayed stems.There was more than one Ariekene dead.The living were hauling out of the hollow, dragging Bren and Yl and Sib with them.The Absurd stumbled disoriented, and one of the wounded Ariekei shoved it, sent it towards us, jabbed its giftwing in our direction.We heard a gasp, and up from the forest at the edges of our brutal clearing went another tree, this one dangling a tangled man, one of the centaur outriders, whose mount had thrown him.He clung, but he was tiny high very fast, and whatever had snared him gave and he abruptly fell, without a cry I could hear as the plant kept rising.We didnt see him land but he couldnt have lived.I stumbled over wrecked biorigging.By the time the murderous flyer was back above the bombsite it would have seen no life.We watched it from our hide a few metres of forest in.It circled several times and headed out, toward the Languageless army.26  WE HAVE TO WALK, Bren said.A couple of days, maybe.We have to get through the forest.The Embassytown army were ahead, but we knew they would delay engaging, and we still hoped to reach the attackers before them.Everything, though, depended on whether we could teach the Ariekei what we had to.Every couple of hours we stopped on our limping, blistered way, and repeated a lesson or tried a new one.Neither the Ariekei nor their batteries seemed to tire.I dont know if or how they mourned their companions.Even our captive tramped before us stolidly, subdued by the environs or the attack or something.Bren guided us with some handheld tech.I was conscious of the forests darkness, coloured by the bruisey flora.The wood was full of noises.Things of radial and spiral form moved around us.We bewildered the animalswe didnt read as predators to the prey nor vice versa, and they were neither afraid of nor threatening to us.They watched us quizzically, those with eyes.Once one of the Ariekei said something dangerous was near us.A , big as a room, opening and closing its teeth.It would surely have attacked the Ariekei had they been alone, but its confusion at the sight of us aliens, uncoded in its instinct, stilled it, so we saved them.Theyd rescued a clutch of the datchips, but not all.They would have to husband them.One by one, as they had to, the Ariekei took themselves into the privacy of the wood and listened hard to EzCals voice, catching us up, a little high but clearer headed.We kept on into the evening, and the forest got sparse, until it was tree flecked grassland under the glimmer of Wreck.We granted ourselves a little sleep: mostly, though, my priority was to teach.YOU ARE LIKE the girl, you are the girl.Sweet Jesus, I said.Just fucking say it.Their urgency, in fact, Im as certain as I can be, was at least as great as mine.YlSib, I said.Ask them this.Do they know who I am?Language.The Ariekei murmured.Shes the girl who was...I interrupted.Really know, I mean.Do they know what a girl is?They know Im a simile, but do they know that the girl is me?What do they think you are, YlSib?How many?You know what shes asking, Bren said.Tallying Mystery.Did the Ariekei think an Ambassador one person or two?Staff had always told us it was a pointless, untranslatable, impolite question.Im sorry but I need them to understand that youre two people because I need them to understand that Im one.That these bloody squawks I make are language.That Im talking to them.The Ariekei watched one meat presence emitting noises more quickly and loudly than usual to the others.After a silence Bren said, Its never been something Ambassadors have been exactly keen to make clear.Make it clear, I said.Ambassadors dont get to be the only real people anymore.I dont believe we could have overturned generations of Ariekene thinking, even with so avant garde a group as this, had they not known somewhere, to some degree, that each of us was a thinking thing.Spanish and its comrades responded at first as if of course, so what; then slowly as YlSib pressed the point many times, with growing fascination, confusion, or what might be anger or fear.At last I saw what I hoped was a fitting sense of revelation.She is speaking, YlSib said to them.The girl who ate what was given to her.Like I speak to you.Yes, I said, as the Ariekei stared.Yes.Language was the unit of Ariekene thought and truth: asserting my sentience in it YlSib made a powerful claim.They told them that I was speaking, and Language insisted then that there must be other kinds of language than Language.Make them say it, I said.That what Im doing is speaking.Spanish Dancer said it.The human in blue is speaking.The others listened.They struggled, but one by one managed to repeat it.They believe it, I said.This was where it began to change.Translate, I said to YlSib.You know me, I said to the Ariekei.Im the girl who ate, etcetera.Im like you, and youre like me, and Im like you.I am you.One of them shouted.Something was happening.It spread among them.Spanish Dancer stared at me.Avice, said Bren in warning.Tell them what I say, I said.I looked at Spanish.I met its almost eyes as urgently as if I were talking to a human.Tell it.I waited for things to be better, Spanish, so Im like you.I am you.I took what was given to me, so Im like the others.I am them.I shone a torch on myself.I glow in the night, Im like the moon.I am the moon.I lay down.They know how we sleep, yeah?Im so tired I lie as still as the dead, Im like the dead.Im so tired I am dead.See?The Ariekei were staggering.Their fanwings flared, folded and opened.They reached for me with their giftwings, making Bren gasp, but they didnt touch me.They said words and noises.Whats happening?Yl or Sib said.Dont stop translating, I said.Dont you dare.The Ariekei sounded together, a moments horrible choir.They retracted their eyes.Dont stop.Im the girl who ate blah blah.What have you said with me all this time?Everything you saids like me is me.Youve already done it.Its all just things in terms of other things.I stood before Spanish Dancer.Tell it its name.Say: There were humans a long time ago who wore clothes that were black and red like your markings.Spanish dancers.I heard YlSib neologise  .I cant speak your name in Language, so I gave you a new one.Spanish Dancer.Youre like, you are a Spanish dancer.One by quick one the Ariekei shouted then went silent.Their eyes stayed in.They swayed.No one spoke for a long time.Whatve you done?whispered Sib.Youve driven them mad.Good, I said.Were insane, to them: we tell the truth with lies.Like sped up film of plants in the sun, Spanishs eye coral at last budded.It started to speak and said two trickles of gibberish.It stopped and waited and started again.Yl and Sib and Bren translated but I didnt need them.Spanish Dancer spoke slowly, as if it was listening hard to everything it said.You are the girl who ate.Im .Im like you and I am you.Someone human gasped.Spanish craned its eye coral and stared at its own fanwing.Two eyes came back to look at me.I have markings.Im a Spanish dancer.I didnt take my eyes off it.Im like you, waiting for change.The Spanish dancer is the girl who was hurt in darkness.Yes, I whispered, and YlSib said , Yes.Other Ariekei were speaking.We are the girl who was hurt.We were like the girl...We are the girl...Tell them their names, I said.You move like a Terre bird: youre Duck.You drip liquid from your Cut mouth, so youre Baptist.Explain that, YlSib, can you?Tell them, tell them the citys a heart...Im like the liquid dripping man, I am him...With the boisterous astonishment of revelation they pressed the similes by which Id named them on until they were lies, telling a truth theyd never been able to before.They spoke metaphors.God, Yl said.Jesus Christ Pharotekton, said Bren.God, said Sib.The Ariekei spoke to each other.Youre the Spanish dancer.I could have wept.Jesus Christ, Avice, you did it.Bren hugged me for a long time.YlSib hugged me.I held onto them all.You did it.We listened to the Ariekene new speakers call each other things in unprecedented formulations.There were two poor bewildered remnants that could not, no matter what I said, that stared at their companions uncomprehending.But the others spoke in new ways.Im not as Ive ever been, Spanish Dancer told us.MUCH LATER, when wed been hours in our camp, I took a datchip, slowly, mindful of how long it had been since a fix, and played it.It was EzCal saying something about the shape of their clothes.Those two still unchanged, Dub and Rooftop Id called them, which hadnt shifted with the others, responded with the usual addict fervour to the sounds.None of the others did.I looked at the Ariekei and they at us.They took slow steps, at last, in all directions.I dont feel...one said.I am, I am not...Play another, Bren said.EzCal spoke thinly to us about some other nonsense.The Ariekei looked at each other.I am not...another said.I picked up another and made EzCal mutter the importance of maintaining medical supplies, and still only those two reacted.The others listened with nothing more than curiosity.I tried more, and while Dub and Rooftop stiffened the altered Ariekei made querying noises at EzCals ridiculous expositions.What happened?YlSib stuttered.Somethings happened to them.Yes.Something in the new language.New thinking.They were signifying nowthere, elision, slippage between word and referent, with which they could play.They had room to think new conceptions.I threw the chips to them, laughing, and they began to go through them.Our clearing was filled with overlapping voices of Ez and Cal.We changed Language, I said.A sudden changeit couldnt undo.Theres nothing to...intoxicate them.There only ever had been because it was impossible, a single split thinkingness of the world: embedded contradiction.If language, thought and world were separated, as they just had been, there was no succulence, no titillating impossible.No mystery.Where Language had been there was only language: signifying sound, to do things with and to.The Ariekei sifted the datchips, listening with disbelief at how they heard what they heard.Thats what I think.Spanish Dancer remained bent, but its eyes looked up at me.Perhaps it knew now, in ways it could not have done before, that what it heard from me were words.It listened.Yes, I said, yes, and Spanish Dancer cooed and, harmonising with itself, said: "    27  ONE BY ONE as the night went on the Ariekei withdrew, and one by one they began to make terrible sounds.I fretted about the noise, but what could we do?
