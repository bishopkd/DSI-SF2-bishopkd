He felt numb.Completely.Throughout his entire body.But this trip were taking, Rachael said, wont be wasted, because youre going to meet a wonderful, spiritual man.Roy Baty, he said.Do you know all of them?I knew all of them, when they still existed.I know three, now.We tried to stop you this morning, before you started out with Dave Holdens list.I tried again, just before Polokov reached you.But then after that I had to wait.Until I broke down, he said.And had to call you.Luba Luft and I had been close, very close friends for almost two years.What did you think of her?Did you like her?I liked her.But you killed her.Phil Resch killed her.Oh, so Phil accompanied you back to the opera house.We didnt know that; our communications broke down about then.We knew just that she had been killed; we naturally assumed by you.From Daves notes, he said, I think I can still go ahead and retire Roy Baty.But maybe not Irmgard Baty.And not Pris Stratton, he thought.Even now; even knowing this.So all that took place at the hotel he said, consisted of a   The association, Rachael said, wanted to reach the bounty hunters here and in the Soviet Union.This seemed to work  for reasons which we do not fully understand.Our limitation again, I guess.I doubt if it works as often or as well as you say, he said thickly.But it has with you.Well see.I already know, Rachael said.When I saw that expression on your face, that grief.I look for that.How many times have you done this?I dont remember.Seven, eight.No, I believe its nine.Sheor rather itnodded.Yes, nine times.The idea is old fashioned, Rick said.Startled, Rachael said, W what?Pushing the steering wheel away from him he put the car into a gliding decline.Or anyhow thats how it strikes me.Im going to kill you, he said.And go on to Roy and Irmgard Baty and Pris Stratton alone.Thats why youre landing?Apprehensively, she said, Theres a fine; Im the property, the legal property, of the association.Im not an escaped android who fled here from Mars; Im not in the same class as the others.But, he said, if I can kill you then I can kill them.Her hands dived for her bulging, overstuffed, kipple filled purse; she searched frantically, then gave up.Goddamn this purse, she said with ferocity.I never can lay my hands on anything in it.Will you kill me in a way that wont hurt?I mean, do it carefully.If I dont fight; okay?I promise not to fight.Do you agree?Rick said, I understand now why Phil Resch said what he said.He wasnt being cynical; he had just learned too much.Going through thisI cant blame him.It warped him.But the wrong way.She seemed more externally composed, now.But still fundamentally frantic and tense.Yet, the dark fire waned; the life force oozed out of her, as he had so often witnessed before with other androids.The classic resignation.Mechanical, intellectual acceptance of that which a genuine organismwith two billion years of the pressure to live and evolve hagriding itcould never have reconciled itself to.I cant stand the way you androids give up, he said savagely.The car now swooped almost to the ground; he had to jerk the wheel toward him to avoid a crash.Braking, he managed to bring the car to a staggering, careening halt; he slammed off the motor and got out his laser tube.At the occipital bone, the posterior base of my skull, Rachael said.Please.She twisted about so that she did not have to look at the laser tube; the beam would enter unperceived.Putting his laser tube away Rick said, I cant do what Phil Resch said.He snapped the motor back on, and a moment later they had taken off again.If youre ever going to do it, Rachael said, do it now.Dont make me wait.Im not going to kill you.He steered the car in the direction of downtown San Francisco once again.Your cars at the St.Francis, isnt it?Ill let you off there and you can head for Seattle.That ended what he had to say; he drove in silence.Thanks for not killing me, Rachael said presently.Hell, as you said youve only got two years of life left, anyhow.And Ive got fifty.Ill live twenty five times as long as you.But you really look down on me, Rachael said.For what I did.Assurance had returned to her; the litany of her voice picked up pace.Youve gone the way of the others.The bounty hunters before you.Each time they get furious and talk wildly about killing me, but when the time comes they cant do it.Just like you, just now.She lit a cigarette, inhaled with relish.You realize what this means, dont you?It means I was right; you wont be able to retire any more androids; it wont be just me, itll be the Batys and Stratton, too.So go on home to your goat.And get some rest.Suddenly she brushed at her coat, violently.Yife!I got a burning ash from my cigarettethere, its gone.She sank back against the seat, relaxing.He said nothing.That goat, Rachel said.You love the goat more than you love your wife, probably.First the goat, then your wife, then last of all She laughed merrily.What can you do but laugh?He did not answer.They continued in silence for a while and then Rachael poked about, found the cars radio, and switched it on.Turn it off, Rick said.Turn off Buster Friendly and his Friendly Friends?Tum off Amanda Werner and Oscar Scruggs?Its time to hear Busters big sensational expos, which is finally almost arrived.She stooped to read the dial of her watch by the radios light.Very soon now.Did you already know about it?Hes been talking about it, building up to it, for  The radio said, ah jes wan ta tell ya, folks, that ahm sitten hih with my pal Bustuh, an were tawkin en haven a real mighty fine time, waitin expectantly as we ah with each tick uh the clock foh what ah understan is the mos important announcement of  Rick shut the radio off.Oscar Scruggs, he said.The voice of intelligent man.Instantly reaching, Rachael clicked the radio back on.I want to listen.I intend to listen.This is important, what Buster Friendly has to say on his show tonight.The idiotic voice babbled once more from the speaker, and Rachael Rosen settled back and made herself comfortable.Beside him in the darkness the coal of her cigarette glowed like the rump of a complacent lightning bug: a steady, unwavering index of Rachael Rosens achievement.Her victory over him.18  Bring the rest of my property up here, Pris ordered J.  R.  Isidore.In particular I want the TV set.So we can hear Busters announcement.Yes, Irmgard Baty agreed, bright eyed, like a darting, plumed swift.We need the TV; weve been waiting a long time for tonight and now itll be starting soon.Isidore said, My own set gets the government channel.Off in a corner of the living room, seated in a deep chair as if he intended to remain permanently, as if he had taken up lodgings in the chair, Roy Baty belched and said patiently, Its Buster Friendly and his Friendly Friends that we want to watch, Iz.Or do you want me to call you J. R. ?Anyhow, do you understand?So will you go get the set?Alone, Isidore made his way down the echoing, empty hall to the stairs.The potent, strong fragrance of happiness still bloomed in him, the sense of beingfor the first time in his dull lifeuseful.Others depend on me now, he exulted as he trudged down the dust impacted steps to the level beneath.And, he thought, itll be nice to see Buster Friendly on TV again, instead of just listening on the radio in the store truck.And thats right, he realized; Buster Friendly is going to reveal his carefully documented sensational expos tonight.So because of Pris and Roy and Irmgard I get to watch what will probably be the most important piece of news to be released in many years.How about that, he said to himself.Life, for J.  R.  Isidore, had definitely taken an upswing.He entered Priss former apartment, unplugged the TV set, and detached the antenna.The silence, all at once, penetrated; he felt his arms grow vague.In the absence of the Batys and Pris he found himself fading out, becoming strangely like the inert television set which he had just unplugged.You have to be with other people, he thought.In order to live at all.I mean, before they came here I could stand it, being alone in the building.But now its changed.You cant go back, he thought.You cant go from people to nonpeople.In panic he thought, Im dependent on them.Thank god they stayed.It would require two trips to transfer Priss possessions to the apartment above.Hoisting the TV set he decided to take it first, then the suitcases and remaining clothes.A few minutes later he had gotten the TV set upstairs; his fingers groaning he placed it on a coffee table in his living room.The Batys and Pris watched impassively.We get a good signal in this building, he panted as he plugged in the cord and attached the antenna.When I used to get Buster Friendly and his  Just turn the set on, Roy Baty said.And stop talking.He did so, then hurried to the door.One more trip, he said, will do it.He lingered, warming himself at the hearth of their presence.Fine, Pris said remotely.Isidore started off once more.I think, he thought, theyre exploiting me sort of.But he did not care.Theyre still good friends to have, he said to himself.Downstairs again, he gathered the girls clothing together, stuffed every piece into the suitcases, then labored back down the hall once again and up the stairs.On a step ahead of him something small moved in the dust.Instantly he dropped the suitcases; he whipped out a plastic medicine bottle, which, like everyone else, he carried for just this.A spider, undistinguished but alive.Shakily he eased it into the bottle and snapped the capperforated by means of a needleshut tight.Upstairs, at the door of his apartment, he paused to get his breath.yes sir, folks; the time is now.This is Buster Friendly, who hopes and trusts youre as eager as I am to share the discovery which Ive made and by the way had verified by top trained research workers working extra hours over the past weeks.Ho ho, folks; this is it!John Isidore said, I found a spider.The three androids glanced up, momentarily moving their attention from the TV screen to him.Lets see it, Pris said.She held out her hand.Roy Baty said, Dont talk while Buster is on.Ive never seen a spider, Pris said.She cupped the medicine bottle in her palms, surveying the creature within.All those legs.Whys it need so many legs, J. R. ?Thats the way spiders are, Isidore said, his heart pounding; he had difficulty breathing.Eight legs.Rising to her feet, Pris said, You know what I think, J. R. ?I think it doesnt need all those legs.Eight?Irmgard Baty said.Why couldnt it get by on four!Cut four off and see.Impulsively opening her purse she produced a pair of clean, sharp cuticle scissors, which she passed to Pris.A weird terror struck at J.  R.  Isidore.Carrying the medicine bottle into the kitchen Pris seated herself at J.  R.  Isidores breakfast table.She removed the lid from the bottle and dumped the spider out.It probably wont be able to run as fast, she said, but theres nothing for it to catch around here anyhow.Itll die anyway.She reached for the scissors.Please, Isidore said.Pris glanced up inquiringly.Is it worth something ?Dont mutilate it, he said wheezingly.Imploringly.With the scissors Pris snipped off one of the spiders legs.In the living room Buster Friendly on the TV screen said, Take a look at this enlargement of a section of background.This is the sky you usually see.Wait, Ill have Earl Parameter, head of my research staff, explain their virtually world shaking discovery to you.Pris clipped off another leg, restraining the spider with the edge of her hand.She was smiling.Blowups of the video pictures, a new voice from the TV said, when subjected to rigorous laboratory scrutiny, reveal that the gray backdrop of sky and daytime moon against which Mercer moves is not only not Terranit is artificial.Youre missing it!Irmgard called anxiously to Pris; she rushed to the kitchen door, saw what Pris had begun doing.Oh, do that afterward, she said coaxingly.This is so important, what theyre saying; it proves that everything we believed  Be quiet, Roy Baty said.is true, Irmgard finished.The TV set continued, The moon is painted; in the enlargements, one of which you see now on your screen, brushstrokes show.And there is even some evidence that the scraggly weeds and dismal, sterile soilperhaps even the stones hurled at Mercer by unseen alleged partiesare equally faked.It is quite possible in fact that the stones are made of soft plastic, causing no authentic wounds.In other words, Buster Friendly broke in, Wilbur Mercer is not suffering at all.The research chief said, Weve at last managed, Mr.Friendly, to track down a former Hollywood special effects man, a Mr.Wade Cortot, who flatly states, from his years of ex perience, that the figure of Mercer could well be merely some bit player marching across a sound stage.Cortot has gone so far as to declare that he recognizes the stage as one used by a now out of business minor moviemaker with whom Cortot had various dealings several decades ago.So according to Cortot, Buster Friendly said, there can be virtually no doubt.Pris had now cut three legs from the spider, which crept about miserably on the kitchen table, seeking a way out, a path to freedom.It found none.Quite frankly we believed Cortot, the research chief said in his dry, pedantic voice, and we spent a good deal of time examining publicity pictures of bit players once employed by the now defunct Hollywood movie industry.And you found  Listen to this, Roy Baty said.Irmgard gazed fixedly at the TV screen and Pris had ceased her mutilation of the spider.We located, by means of thousands upon thousands of photographs, a very old man now, named Al Jarry, who played a number of bit parts in pre war films.From our lab we sent a team to Jarrys home in East Harmony, Indiana.Ill let one of the members of that team describe what he found.Silence, then a new voice, equally pedestrian.The house on Lark Avenue in East Harmony is tottering and shabby and at the edge of town, where no one, except Al Jarry, still lives.Invited amiably in, and seated in the stale smelling, moldering, kipple filled living room, I scanned by telepathic means the blurred, debris cluttered, and hazy mind of Al Jarry seated across from me.Listen, Roy Baty said, on the edge of his seat, poised as if to pounce.I found, the technician continued, that the old man did in actuality make a series of short fifteen minute video films, for an employer whom he never met.And, as we had theorized, the rocks did consist of rubber like plastic.The blood shed was catsup, and the technician chuckledthe only suffering Mr.Jarry underwent was having to go an entire day without a shot of whisky.Al Jarry, Buster Friendly said, his face returning to the screen.Well, well.An old man who even in his prime never amounted to anything which either he or ourselves could respect.Al Jarry made a repetitious and dull film, a series of them in fact, for whom he knew notand does not to this day.It has often been said by adherents of the experience of Mercerism that Wilbur Mercer is not a human being, that he is in fact an archetypal superior entity perhaps from another star.Well, in a sense this contention has proven correct.Wilbur Mercer is not human, does not in fact exist.The world in which he climbs is a cheap, Hollywood, commonplace sound stage which vanished into kipple years ago.And who, then, has spawned this hoax on the Sol System?Think about that for a time, folks.We may never know, Irmgard murmured.Buster Friendly said, We may never know.Nor can we fathom the peculiar purpose behind this swindle.Yes, folks, swindle.Mercerism is a swindle!I think we know, Roy Baty said.Its obvious.Mercerism came into existence  But ponder this, Buster Friendly continued.Ask yourselves what is it that Mercerism does.Well, if were to be1ieve its many practitioners, the experience fuses  Its that empathy that humans have, Irmgard said men and women throughout the Sol System into a single entity.But an entity which is manageable by the so called telepathic voice of Mercer.Mark that.An ambitious politically minded would be Hitler could  No, its that empathy, Irmgard said vigorously.Fists clenched, she roved into the kitchen, up to Isidore.Isnt it a way of proving that humans can do something we cant do?Because without the Mercer experience we just have your word that you feel this empathy business, this shared, group thing.Hows the spider?She bent over Priss shoulder.With the scissors Pris snipped off another of the spiders legs.Four now, she said.She nudged the spider.He wont go.But he can.Roy Baty appeared at the doorway, inhaling deeply an expression of accomplishment on his face.Its done.Buster said it out loud, and nearly every human in the system heard him say it.Mercerism is a swindle.The whole experience of empathy is a swindle.He came over to look curiously at the spider.It wont try to walk, Irmgard said.I can make it walk.Roy Baty got out a book of matches, lit a match; he held it near the spider, closer and closer, until at last it crept feebly away.I was right, Irmgard said.Didnt I say it could walk with only four legs?She peered up expectantly at Isidore.Whats the matter?Touching his arm she said, You didnt lose anything; well pay you what thatwhats it called?that Sidneys catalogue says.Dont look so grim.Isnt that something about Mercer, what they discovered?All that research?Hey, answer.She prodded him anxiously.Hes upset, Pris said.Because he has an empathy box.In the other room.Do you use it, J. R. ?she asked Isidore.Roy Baty said, Of course he uses it.Theyall door did.Maybe now theyll start wondering.I dont think this will end the cult of Mercer, Pris said.But right this minute therere a lot of unhappy human beings.To Isidore she said, Weve waited for months; we all knew it was coming, this pitch of Busters.She hesitated and then said, Well, why not.Buster is one of us.An android, Irmgard explained.And nobody knows.No humans, I mean.Pris, with the scissors, cut yet another leg from the spider.All at once John Isidore pushed her away and lifted up the mutilated creature.He carried it to the sink and there he drowned it.In him his mind, his hopes, drowned, too.As swiftly as the spider.Hes really upset, Irmgard said nervously.Dont look like that, J. R.  And why dont you say anything?To Pris and to her husband she said, It makes me terribly upset, him Just standing there by the sink and not speaking; he hasnt said anything since we turned on the TV.Its not the TV, Pris said.Its the spider.Isnt it, John R.  Isidore: Hell get over it, she said to Irmgard, who had gone into the other room to shut off the TV.Regarding Isidore with easy amusement, Roy Baty said, Its all over now, Iz.For Mercerism, I mean.With his nails he managed to lift the corpse of the spider from the sink.Maybe this was the last spider, he said.The last living spider on Earth.He reflected.In that case its all over for spiders, too.Idont feel well, Isidore said.From the kitchen cupboard he got a cup; he stood holding it for an intervalhe did not know exactly how long.And then he said to Roy Baty, Is the sky behindMercer just painted?Not real?You saw the enlargements on the TV screen, Roy Baty said.The brushstrokes.Mercerism isnt finished, Isidore said.Something ailed the three androids, something terrible.The spider, he thought.Maybe it had been the last spider on Earth, as Roy Baty said.And the spider is gone; Mercer is gone; he saw the dust and the ruin of the apartment as it lay spreading out everywherehe heard the kipple coming, the final disorder of all forms, the absence which would win out.It grew around him as he stood holding the empty ceramic cup; the cupboards of the kitchen creaked and split and he felt the floor beneath his feet give.Reaching out, he touched the wall.His hand broke the surface; gray particles trickled and hurried down, fragments of plaster resembling the radioactive dust outside.He seated himself at the table and, like rotten, hollow tubes the legs of the chair bent; standing quickly, he set down the cup and tried to reform the chair, tried to press it back into its right shape.The chair came apart in his hands, the screws which had previously connected its several sections ripping out and hanging loose.He saw, on the table, the ceramic cup crack; webs of fine lines grew like the shadows of a vine, and then a chip dropped from the edge of the cup, exposing the rough, unglazed interior.Whats he doing?Irmgard Batys voice came to him distantly.Hes breaking everything!Isidore, stop  Im not doing it, he said.He walked unsteadily into the living room, to be by himself; he stood by the tattered couch and gazed at the yellow, stained wall with all the spots which dead bugs, that had once crawled, had left, and again he thought of the corpse of the spider with its four remaining legs.Everything in here is old, he realized.It long ago began to decay and it wont stop.The corpse of the spider has taken over.In the depression caused by the sagging of the floor, pieces of animals manifested themselves, the head of a crow, mummified hands which might have once been parts of monkeys.A donkey stood a little way off, not stirring and yet apparently alive; at least it had not begun to deteriorate.He started toward it, feeling stick like bones, dry as weeds, splinter under his shoes.But before he could reach the donkeyone of the creatures which he loved the mosta shiny blue crow fell from above to perch on the donkeys unprotesting muzzle.Dont, he said aloud, but the crow, rapidly, picked out the donkeys eyes.Again, he thought.Its happening to me again.I will be down here a long time, he realized.As before.Its always long, because nothing here ever changes; a point comes when it does not even decay.A dry wind rustled, and around him the heaps of bones broke.Even the wind destroys them, he perceived.At this stage.just before time ceases.I wish I could remember how to climb up from here, he thought.Looking up he saw nothing to grasp.Mercer, he said aloud.Where are you now?This is the tomb world and I am in it again, but this time youre not here too.Something crept across his foot.He knelt down and searched for itand found it because it moved so slowly.The mutilated spider, advancing itself haltingly on its surviving legs; he picked it up and held it in the palm of his hand.The bones, he realized, have reversed themselves; the spider is again alive.Mercer must be near.The wind blew, cracking and splintering the remaining bones, but he sensed the presence of Mercer.Come here, he said to Mercer.Crawl across my foot or find some other way of reaching me.Okay?Mercer, he thought.Aloud he said, Mercer!Across the landscape weeds advanced; weeds corkscrewed their way into the walls around him and worked the walls until they the weeds became their own spore.The spore expanded, split, and burst within the corrupted steel and shards of concrete that had formerly been walls.But the desolation remained after the walls had gone; the desolation followed after everything else.Except the frail, dim figure of Mercer; the old man faced him, a placid expression on his face.Is the sky painted?Isidore asked.Are there really brushstrokes that show up under magnification?Yes, Mercer said.I cant see them.Youre too close, Mercer said.You have to be a long way off, the way the androids are.They have better perspective.Is that why they claim youre a fraud?I am a fraud, Mercer said.Theyre sincere; their research is sincere.From their standpoint I am an elderly retired bit player named Al Jarry.All of it, their disclosure, is true.They interviewed me at my home, as they claim; I told them whatever they wanted to know, which was everything.Including about the whisky?Mercer smiled.It was true.They did a good job and from their standpoint Buster Friendlys disclosure was convincing.They will have trouble understanding why nothing has changed.Because youre still here and Im still here.Mercer indicated with a sweep of his hand the barren, rising hillside, the familiar place.I lifted you from the tomb world just now and I will continue to lift you until you lose interest and want to quit.But you will have to stop searching for me because I will never stop searching for you.I didnt like that about the whisky, Isidore said.Thats lowering.Thats because youre a highly moral person.Im not.I dont judge, not even myself.Mercer held out a closed hand, palm up.Before I forget it, I have something of yours here.He opened his fingers.On his hand rested the mutilated spider, but with its snipped off legs restored.Thanks.Isidore accepted the spider.He started to say something further  An alarm bell clanged.Roy Baty snarled, Theres a bounty hunter in the building!Get all the lights off.Get him away from that empathy box; he has to be ready at the door.Go onmove him!19  Looking down, John Isidore saw his own hands; they gripped the twin handles of the empathy box.As he stood gaping at them, the lights in the living room of his apartment plunged out.He could see, in the kitchen, Pris hurrying to catch the table lamp there.Listen, J. R. , Irmgard whispered harshly in his ear; she had grabbed him by the shoulder, her nails digging into him with frantic intensity.She seemed unaware of what she did, now; in the dim nocturnal light from outdoors Irmgards face had become distorted, astigmatic.It had turned intoa craven dish, with cowering, tiny, lidless eyes.You have to go, she whispered, to the door, when he knocks, if he does knock; you have to show him your identification and tell him this is your apartment and no one else is here.And you ask to see a warrant.Pris, standing on the other side of him, her body arched, whispered, Dont let him in, J. R.  Say anything; do anything that will stop him.Do you know what a bounty hunter would do let loose in here?Do you understand what he would do to us?Moving away from the two android females Isidore groped his way to the door; with his fingers he located the knob, halted there, listening.He could sense the hall outside, is he always had sensed it: vacant and reverberating and lifeless.Hear anything?Roy Baty said, bending close.Isidore smelled the rank, cringing body; he inhaled fear from it, fear pouring out, forming a mist.Step out and take a look.Opening the door, Isidore looked up and down the indistinct hall.The air out here had a clear quality, despite the weight of dust.He still held the spider which Mercer had given him.Was it actually the spider which Pris had snipped apart with Irmgard Batys cuticle scissors?Probably not.He would never know.But anyhow it was alive; it crept about within his closed hand, not biting him: as with most small spiders its mandibles could not puncture human skin.He reached the end of the hall, descended the stairs, and stepped outside, onto what had once been a terraced path, garden enclosed.The garden had perished during the war and the path had ruptured in a thousand places.But he knew its surface; under his feet the familiar path felt good, and he followed it, passed along the greater side of the building, coming at last to the only verdant spot in the vicinitya yard square patch of dust saturated, drooping weeds.There he deposited the spider.He experienced its wavering progress as it departed his hand.Well, that was that; he straightened up.A flashlight beam focused on the weeds; in its glare their half dead stalks appeared stark, menacing.Now he could see the spider; it rested on a serrated leaf.So it had gotten away all right.What did you do?the man holding the flashlight asked.I put down a spider, he said, wondering why the man didnt see; in the beam of yellow light the spider bloated up larger than life.So it could get away.Why dont you take it up to your apartment?You ought to keep it in a jar.According to the January Sidneys most spiders are up ten percent in retail price.You could have gotten a hundred and some odd dollars for it.Isidore said, If I took it back up there shed cut it apart again.Bit by bit, to see what it did.Androids do that, the man said.Reaching into his overcoat he brought out something which he flapped open and extended toward Isidore.In the irregular light the bounty hunter seemed a medium man, not impressive.Round face and hairless, smooth features; like a clerk in a bureaucratic office.Methodical but informal.Not demi god in shape; not at all as Isidore had anticipated him.Im an investigator for the San Francisco Police Department.Deckard, Rick Deckard.The man flapped his ID shut again, stuck it back in his overcoat pocket.Theyre up there now?The three?Well, the thing is, Isidore said, Im looking after them.Two are women.Theyre the last ones of the group; the rest are dead.I brought Priss TV set up from her apartment and put it in mine, so they could watch Buster Friendly.Buster proved beyond a doubt that Mercer doesnt exist.Isidore felt excitement, knowing something of this importancenews that the bounty hunter evidently hadnt heard.Lets go up there, Deckard said.Suddenly he held a laser tube pointed at Isidore; then, indecisively, he put it away.Youre a special, arent you, he said.A chickenhead.But I have a job.I drive a truck for Horrified, he discovered he had forgotten the name.a pet hospital, he said.The Van Ness Pet Hospital, he said.Owned b b by Hannibal Sloat.Deckard said, Will you take me up there and show me which apartment theyre in?Therere over a thousand separate apartments; you can save me a lot of time.His voice dipped with fatigue.If you kill them you wont be able to fuse with Mercer again, Isidore said.You wont take me up there?Show me which floor?Just tell me the floor.Ill figure out which apartment on the floor it is.No, Isidore said.Under state and federal law, Deckard began.He ceased, then.Giving up the interrogation.Good night, he said, and walked away, up the path and into the building, his flashlight bleeding a yellowed, diffuse path before him.Inside the conapt building, Rick Deckard shut off his flashlight; guided by the ineffectual, recessed bulbs spaced ahead of him he made his way along the hall, thinking, The chickenhead knows theyre androids; he knew it already, before I told him.But he doesnt understand.On the other hand, who does?Do I?Did I?And one of them will be a duplicate of Rachael, he reflected.Maybe the special has been living with her.I wonder how he liked it, he asked himself.Maybe that was the one who he believed would cut up his spider.I could go back and get that spider, he reflected.Ive never found a live, wild animal.It must be a fantastic experience to look down and see something living scuttling along.Maybe itll happen someday to me like it did him.He had brought listening gear from his car; he set it up, now, a revolving detek snout with blip screen.In the silence of the hall the screen indicated nothing.Not on this floor, he said to himself.He clicked over to vertical.On that axis the snout absorbed a faint signal.Upstairs.He gathered up the gear and his briefcase and climbed the stairs to the next floor.A figure in the shadows waited.If you move Ill retire you, Rick said.The male one, waiting for him.In his clenched fingers the laser tube felt hard but he could not lift it and aim it.He had been caught first, caught too soon.Im not an android, the figure said.My name is Mercer.It stepped into a zone of light.I inhabit this building because of Mr.Isidore.The special who had the spider; you talked briefly to him outside.Am I outside Mercerism, now?Rick said.As the chickenhead said?Because of what Im going to do in the next few minutes?Mercer said, Mr.Isidore spoke for himself, not for me.What you are doing has to be done.I said that already.Raising his arm he pointed at the stairs behind Rick.I came to tell you that one of them is behind you and below, not in the apartment.It will be the hard one of the three and you must retire it first.The rustling, ancient voice gained abrupt fervor.Quick, Mr.Deckard.On the steps.His laser tube thrust out, Rick spun and sank onto his haunches facing the flight of stairs.Up it glided a woman, toward him, and he knew her; he recognized her and lowered his laser tube.Rachael he said, perplexed.Had she followed him in her own hovercar, tracked him here?And why?Go back to Seattle, he said.Leave me alone; Mercer told me Ive got to do it.And then he saw that it was not quite Rachael.For what weve meant to each other, the android said as it approached him, its arms reaching as if to clutch at him.The clothes, he thought, are wrong.But the eyes, the same eyes.And there are more like this; there can be a legion of her, each with its own name, but all Rachael RosenRachael, the prototype, used by the manufacturer to protect the others.He fired at her as, imploringly, she dashed toward him.
