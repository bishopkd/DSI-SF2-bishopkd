But as soon as he'd made out one pattern, it would change into something else, because unlike the totem poles the tattoo was dynamic and played with images in time the same way that the totem poles did in space."Hello, John," she said."It's too bad I loved you because you had to leave. "Hackworth tried to find her face, which should have been easy, it being the thing in the front of her head; but his eyes kept snagging on all the other little faces that came and went and flowed into one another, time sharing her eyes, her mouth, even her nostrils.And he was starting to recognize patterns in her hair too, which was more than he could handle.He was pretty sure he had just caught a glimpse of Fiona in there.She turned her back on him, her hair spinning out momentarily like a twirling skirt, and for that instant he could see through it and begin to make sense of the image.He was positive that somewhere in there he'd seen Gwen and Fiona walking along a beach.He dismounted from Kidnapper and followed her on foot.Kidnapper followed him silently.They walked across the park for half a mile or so, and Hackworth kept his distance because when he got too close to her, the images in her hair bewildered his eyes.She took him to a wild stretch of beach where immense Douglas fir logs lay scattered around.As Hackworth clambered over the logs trying to keep up with the woman, he occasionally caught a handhold that appeared to have been carved by someone long ago.The logs were palimpsests.Two of them rose from the water's edge, not quite vertical, stuck like darts into the impermanent sand.Hackworth walked between them, the surf crashing around his knees.He saw weathered intimations of faces and wild beasts living in the wood, ravens, eagles, and wolves tangled into organic skeins.The water was bitterly cold on his legs, and he whooped in a couple of breaths, but the woman kept walking; the water was up past her waist now, and her hair was floating around her so that the translucent images once again became readable.Then she vanished beneath a collapsing wave two meters high.The wave knocked Hackworth on his backside and washed him along for a short distance, flailing his arms and legs.When he got his balance back, he sat there for a few moments, letting smaller waves embrace his waist and chest, waiting for the woman to come up for a breath.But she didn't.There was something down there.He rolled up onto his feet and tramped straight into the ocean.Just as the waves were coming up into his face, his feet contacted something hard and smooth that gave way beneath him.He was sucked downward as the water plunged into a subterranean void.A hatch slammed shut above his head, and suddenly he was breathing air again.The light was silver.He was sitting in water up to his chest, but it rapidly drained away, drawn off by some kind of a pumping system, and then he found himself looking down a long silvery tunnel.The woman was descending it, a stone's throw ahead of him.Hackworth had been in a few of these, normally in more industrial settings.The .entrance was dug into the beach, but the rest of it was a floating tunnel, a tube full of air, moored to the bottom.It was a cheap way to make space; the Nipponese used these things as sleeping quarters for foreign guest workers.The walls were made of membranes that drew oxygen from the surrounding seawater and ejected carbon dioxide, so that seen from a fish's point of view, the tunnels steamed like hot pasta on a cold steel plate as they excreted countless microbubbles of polluted CO2.These things extruded themselves into the water like the roots that grew out of improperly stored potatoes, forking from time to time, carrying their own Feeds forward so that they could be extended on command.They were empty and collapsed to begin with, and when they knew they were finished, they inflated themselves with scavenged oxygen and grew rigid.Now that the cold water had drained out of Hackworth's ears, he could hear a deep drumming that he'd mistaken at first for the crash of the surf overhead; but this had a steadier beat that invited him forward.Down the tunnel Hackworth walked, following the woman, and as he went the light grew dimmer and the tunnel narrower.He suspected that the walls of the tunnel had mediatronic properties because he kept seeing things from the corners of his eyes that were no longer there when he snapped his head around.He'd assumed that he would soon reach a chamber, a swelling in the tunnel where this woman's friends would sit pounding on enormous kettledrums, but before reaching any such thing, he came to a place where the tunnel had gone completely dark, and he had to crouch to his knees and feel his way along.When he touched the taut but yielding wall of the tunnel with his knees and his hands, he felt the drumming in his bones and realized that audio was built into the stuff; the drumming could be anywhere, or it could be recorded.Or maybe it was a lot simpler than that, maybe the tubes happened to transmit sound well, and somewhere else in the tunnel system, people were just pounding on the walls.His head contacted the tunnel.He dropped to his belly and began to crawl along.Swarms of tiny sparkling lights kept lunging past his face, and he realized that they were his hands; light emitting nanosites had become embedded in his flesh.They must have been put there by Dr.X's physician; but they had not come alight until he entered these tunnels.If the woman hadn't already come through here, he would have given up at this point, thinking it a dead end, a busted tunnel that had failed to expand.The drumming was now coming into his ears and bones from all sides.He could not see a thing, though from time to time he thought he caught a glimmer of flickering yellow light.The tunnel undulated slightly in the deep currents, rivers of bitterly cold water swirling along the floor of the straits.Whenever he allowed his mind to wander, reminding himself that he was deep below the surface of the ocean here, he had to stop and force himself not to panic.Concentrate on the nice airfilled tunnel, not what surrounds it.There was definitely light ahead.He found himself in a swelling in the tube, just wide enough to sit up in, and rolled over on his back for a moment to rest.A lamp was burning in here, a bowl filled with some kind of melting hydrocarbon that left no ash or smoke.The mediatronic walls had animated scenes on them, barely visible in the flickering light: animals dancing in the forest.He followed the tubes for some period of time that was quite long but difficult to estimate.From time to time he would come to a chamber with a lamp and more paintings.As he crawled through the long perfectly black tunnels, he began to experience visual and auditory hallucinations, vague at first, just random noise knocking around in his neural net, but increasingly well resolved and realistic.The hallucinations had a dreamlike quality in which things he'd actually seen recently, such as Gwen and Fiona, Dr.X, the airship, the boys playing fieldball, were mingled with images so alien he scarcely recognized them.It troubled him that his mind was taking something as dear to him as Fiona and blending her into a farrago of alien sights and ideas.He could see the nanosites in his skin.But for all he knew, he might have a million more living in his brain now, piggybacking on axons and dendrites, sending data to one another in flashes of light.A second brain intermingled with his own.There was no reason that information could not be relayed from one such nanosite to another, through his body and outward to the nanosites in his skin, and from there across the darkness to others.What would happen when he came close to other people with similar infestations?When he finally reached the grand chamber, he could not really tell whether it was reality or another machine made hallucination.It was shaped like a flattened ice cream cone, a domed ceiling above a gently sloping conical floor.The ceiling was a vast mediatron, and the floor served as an amphitheatre.Hackworth spilled into the room abruptly as the drumming reached a crescendo.The floor was slick, and he slid down helplessly until he reached the central pit.He rolled onto his back and saw a fiery scene sprawling across the dome above, and in his peripheral vision, covering the floor of the theatre, a thousand living constellations pounding on the floor with their hands.Bred and born in the Foreign regions beyond, there is much in the administration of the Celestial Dynasty that is not perfectly comprehensible to the Barbarians, and they are continually putting forced constructions on things of which it is difficult to explain to them the real nature.Qiying     PART THE SECOND    Hackworth has a singular experience;  the rite of the Drummers.In a cavernous dark space lit by many small fires, a young woman, probably not much more than a girl, stands on a pedestal naked except for an elaborate paint job, or maybe it is a total body mediatronic tattoo.A crown of leafy branches is twined around her head, and she has thick voluminous hair spreading to her knees.She is clutching a bouquet of roses to her breast, the thorns indenting her flesh.Many people, perhaps thousands, surround her, drumming madly, sometimes chanting and singing.Into the space between the girl and the watchers, a couple of dozen men are introduced.Some come running out of their own accord, some look as if they've been pushed, some wander in as if they've been walking down the street (stark naked) and gone in the wrong door.Some are Asian, some European, some African.Some have to be prodded by frenzied celebrants who charge out of the crowd and shove them here and there.Eventually they form a circle around the girl, and then the drumming builds to a deafening crescendo, speeds up until it devolves into a rhythmless hailstorm, and then suddenly, instantly, stops.Someone wails something in a high, purposeful, ululating voice.Hackworth can't understand what this person is saying.Then there is a single massive drumbeat.More wailing.Another drumbeat.Again.The third drumbeat establishes a ponderous rhythm.This goes on for a while, the beat slowly speeding up.After a certain point the wailer no longer stops between beats, he begins to weave his rap through the bars in a sort of counterpoint.The ring of men standing around the girl begin to dance in a very simple shuffling motion, one way and then the other way around the girl.Hackworth notes that all of them have erections, sheathed in brightly colored mediatronic condoms rubbers that actually make their own light so that the bobbing boners look like so many cyalume wands dancing through the air.The drumbeats and the dancing speed up very slowly.The erections tell Hackworth why this is taking so long: He's watching foreplay here.After half an hour or so, the excitement, phallic and otherwise, is unbearable.The beat is now a notch faster than your basic pulse rate, lots of other beats and counterrhythms woven through it, and the chanting of the individual singer has become a wild semi organized choral phenomenon.At some point, after seemingly nothing has happened for half an hour, everything happens at once: The drumming and chanting explode to a new, impossible level of intensity.The dancers reach down, grip the flaccid reservoir tips of their radioactive condoms, stretch them out.Someone runs out with a knife and cuts off the tips of the condoms in a freakish parody of circumcision, exposing the glans of each man's penis.The girl moves for the first time, tossing her bouquet up in the air like a bride making her move toward the limo; the roses fountain, spinning end over end, and come down individually among the dancers, who snatch them out of the air, scrabble for them on the floor, whatever.The girl faints, or something, falling backward, arms out, and is caught by several of the dancers, who hoist her body up over their heads and parade her around the circle for a while, like a crucified body just crowbarred off the tree.She ends up flat on her back on the ground, and one of the dancers is between her legs, and in a very few thrusts he has finished.A couple of others grab his arms and yank him out of there before he's even had a chance to tell her he'll still love her in the morning, and another one is in there, and he doesn't take very long either all this foreplay has got these guys in hair trigger mode.The dancers manage to rotate through in a few minutes.Hackworth can't see the girl, who's completely hidden, but she's not struggling, as far as he can tell, and they don't seem to be holding her down.Toward the end, smoke or steam or something begins to spiral up from the middle of the orgy.The last participant grimaces even more than the average person who's having an orgasm, and yanks himself back from the woman, grabbing his dick and hopping up and down and hollering in what looks like pain.That's the signal for all of the dancers to jump back away from the woman, who is now kind of hard to make out, just a fuzzy motionless package wrapped in steam.Flames erupt from several locations, all over her body, at once, seams of lava splitting open along her veins and the heart itself erupting from her chest like ball lightning.Her body becomes a burning cross spread out on the floor, the bright apex of an inverted cone of turbulent steam and smoke.Hackworth notices that the drumming and chanting have completely stopped.The crowd observes a long moment of silence while the body burns.Then, when the last of the flames have died out, an honor guard of sorts descends from the crowd: four men in black body paint with white skeletons painted on top of that.He notes that the woman was lying on a square sheet of some kind when she burned.Each of the guys grabs a corner of the sheet.Her remains tumble into the center, powdery ash flies, flecks of red hot coals spark.The skeleton men carry the remains over to a fifty five gallon steel drum and dump it in.There is a burst of steam and lots of sizzling noises as the hot coals contact some kind of liquid that was in the drum.One of the skeleton men picks up a long spoon and gives the mix a stir, then dips a cracked and spalled University of Michigan coffee mug into it and takes a long drink.The other three skeleton men each drink in their turn.By now, the spectators have formed a long queue.One by one they step forward.The leader of the skeleton men holds the mug for them, gives each one a sip.Then they all wander off, individually or in small, conversing groups.Show's over.Nell's life at Dovetail;  developments in the Primer;  a trip to the New Atlantis Clave;  she is presented to Miss Matheson;  new lodgings with an "old" acquaintance.Nell lived in the Millhouse for several days.They gave her a little bed under the eaves on the top floor, in a cozy place only she was tiny enough to reach.She had her meals with Rita or Brad or one of the other nice people she knew there.During the days she would wander in the meadow or dangle her feet in the river or explore the woods, sometimes going as far as the dog pod grid.She always took the Primer with her.Lately, it had been filled with the doings of Princess Nell and her friends in the city of King Magpie.It kept getting more like a ractive and less like a story, and by the end of each chapter she was exhausted from all the cleverness she had expended just to get herself and her friends through another day without falling into the clutches of pirates or of King Magpie himself.In time, she and Peter came up with a very tricky plan to sneak into the castle, create a diversion, and seize the magic books that were the source of King Magpie's power.This plan failed the first time, but the next day, Nell turned the page back and tried it again, this time with a few changes.It failed again, but not before Princess Nell and her friends had gotten a little farther into the castle.The sixth or seventh time, the plan worked perfectly while King Magpie was locked in a battle of riddles with Peter Rabbit (which Peter won), Purple used a magic spell to smash open the door to his secret library, which was filled with books even more magical than the Young Lady's Illustrated Primer.Hidden inside one of those books was a jeweled key.Princess Nell took the key, and Purple made off with several of King Magpie's magic books while she was at it.They made a breathtaking escape across a river into the next country, where King Magpie could not chase them, and camped in a nice meadow for a few days, resting.During the daytime, when the others were just stuffed animals, Princess Nell would peruse some of the new magic books that Purple had stolen.When she did, its image in the illustration would zoom toward her until it filled the page, and then the Primer itself would become that magical book until she decided to put it away.Nell's favorite book was a magical Atlas which she could use to explore any land, real or imaginary.During the nighttime, Purple spent most of her time reading a very large, crusty, worn, stained, burnt tome entitled PANTECHNICON.This book had a built in hasp with a padlock.Whenever Purple wasn't using it, she locked it shut.Nell asked to see it a few times, but Purple told her she was too young to know such things as were written in this Book.During this time, Duck as usual made herself busy around the camp, tidying up and fixing their meals, doing laundry on the rocks by the river, and mending their clothes that had become ragged during their wanderings.Peter became restless.He was quick with words, but he had not learned the trick of reading, and so the books from King Magpie's library were of no use to him save as nest lining material.He got into the habit of exploring the surrounding forests, particularly the ones to the north.At first he would be gone for a few hours at a time, but once he stayed away all night and did not come back until the following noon.Then he began to go on trips for several days at a time.Peter vanished into the north woods one day, staggering under a heavy pack, and didn't come back at all....Nell was in the meadow one day, gathering flowers, when a fine lady a Vicky came riding toward her on a horse.When she drew closer, Nell was surprised to see that the horse was Eggshell and the lady was Rita, all dressed up in a long dress like the Vicky ladies wore, with a riding hat on her head, and riding sidesaddle of all things."You look pretty," Nell said."Thank you, Nell," Rita said."Would you like to look like this too, for a little while?I have a surprise for you. "One of the ladies who lived in the Millhouse was a milliner, and she had made Nell a dress, sewing it all together by hand.Rita had brought this dress with her, and she helped Nell change into it, right there in the middle of the meadow.Then she braided Nell's hair and even tucked some tiny wildflowers into it.Finally she helped Nell climb up on top of Eggshell with her and began riding back toward the Millhouse."You will have to leave your book here today," Rita said."Why?""I'm taking you through the grid, into New Atlantis Clave," Rita said."Constable Moore told me that I should not on any account allow you to carry your book through the grid.He said it would only stir things up.I know you're about to ask me why, Nell, but I don't have an answer. "Nell ran upstairs, tripping over her long skirts a couple of times, and left the Primer in her little nook.Then she climbed back on Eggshell with Rita.They rode over a little stone bridge above the water wheel and through the woods, until Nell could hear the faint afflatus of the security aerostats.Eggshell slowed to a walk and pushed gingerly through the field of shiny hovering teardrops.Nell even reached out and touched one, then snapped her hand back, even though it hadn't done anything except push back.The reflection of her face slithered backward across the surface of this pod as they went by.They rode across the territory of New Atlantis for some time without seeing anything other than trees, wildflowers, brooks, the occasional squirrel, or deer."Why do the Vickys have such a big clave?"Nell asked."Don't ever call them Vickys," Rita said."Why?""It's a word that people who don't like them use to describe them in kind of a bad, unfriendly way," Rita said."Like a pejorative term?"Nell said.Rita laughed, more nervous than amused."Exactly. ""Why do the Atlantans have such a big clave?""Well, each phyle has a different way, and some ways are better suited to making money than others, so some have a lot of territory and others don't. ""What do you mean, a different way?""To make money you have to work hard to live your life in a certain way.The Atlantans all live that way, it's part of their culture.The Nipponese too.So the Nipponese and the Atlantans have as much money as all the other phyles put together. ""Why aren't you an Atlantan?""Because I don't want to live that way.All the people in Dovetail like to make beautiful things.To us, the things that the Atlantans do dressing up in these kinds of clothes, spending years and years in school are irrelevant.Those pursuits wouldn't help us make beautiful things, you see.I'd rather just wear my blue jeans and make paper. ""But the M. C.  can make paper," Nell said."Not the kind that the Atlantans like. ""But you make money from your paper only because the Atlantans make money from working hard," Nell said.Rita's face turned red and she said nothing for a little while.Then, in a tight voice, she said, "Nell, you should ask your book the meaning of the word discretion. "They came across a riding trail dotted with great mounds of horse manure, and began following it uphill.Soon the trail was hemmed in between dry stone walls, which Rita said that one of her friends in Dovetail had made.Forest gave way to pastures, then lawns like jade glaciers, and great houses on hilltops, surrounded by geometric hedges and ramparts of flowers.The trail became a cobblestone road that adopted new lanes from time to time as they rode into town.The mountain kept rising up above them for some distance, and on its green summit, half veiled behind a thin cloud layer, Nell could see Source Victoria.From down in the Leased Territories, the New Atlantis Clave had always looked clean and beautiful, and it was certainly those things.But Nell was surprised at how cool the weather was here compared to the L. T.  Rita explained that the Atlantans came from northern countries and didn't care for hot weather, so they put their city high up in the air to make it cooler.Rita turned down a boulevard with a great flowery park running down the middle.It was lined with red stone row houses with turrets and gargoyles and beveled glass everywhere.Men in top hats and women in long dresses strolled, pushed perambulators, rode horses or chevalines.Shiny dark green robots, like refrigerators tipped over on their sides, hummed down the streets at a toddler's walking pace, squatting over piles of manure and inhaling them.From place to place there was a messenger on a bicycle or an especially fancy personage in a black, full lane car.Rita stopped Eggshell in front of a house and paid a little boy to hold the reins.From the saddlebags she took a sheaf of new paper, all wrapped up in special wrapping paper that she'd also made.She carried it up the steps and rang the bell.The house had a round tower on the front, lined with bow windows with stained glass inserts above them, and through the windows and the lace curtains Nell could see, on different stories, crystal chandeliers and fine plates and dark brown wooden bookcases lined with thousands and thousands of books.A parlormaid let Rita in the door.Through the window, Nell could see Rita putting a calling card on a silver tray held out by the maid a salver, they called it.The maid carried it back, then emerged a couple of minutes later and directed Rita into the back of the house.Rita didn't come back for half an hour.Nell wished she had the Primer to keep her company.She talked to the little boy for a bit; his name was Sam, he lived in the Leased Territories, and he put on a suit and took the bus here every morning so that he could hang around on the street holding people's horses and doing other small errands.Nell wondered whether Tequila worked in any of these houses, and whether they might run into her by accident.Her chest always got a tight feeling when she thought of her mother.Rita came out of the house."Sorry," she said, "I got out as fast as I could, but I had to stay and socialize.Protocol, you know. ""Explain protocol," Nell said.This was how she always talked to the Primer."At the place we're going, you need to watch your manners.Don't say 'explain this' or 'explain that. '"Would it impose on your time unduly to provide me with a concise explanation of the term protocol?"Nell said.Again Rita made that nervous laugh and looked at Nell with an expression that looked like poorly concealed alarm.As they rode down the street, Rita talked about protocol for a little bit, but Nell wasn't really listening because she was trying to figure out why it was that, all of a sudden, she was capable of scaring grownups like Rita.They rode through the most built up part of town, where the buildings and gardens and statues were all magnificent, and none of the streets were the same: Some were crescents, some were courts, or circles or ovals, or squares surrounding patches of greenery, and even the long streets turned this way and that.They passed from there into a less built up area with many parks and playing fields and finally pulled up in front of a fancy building with ornate towers, surrounded by a wrought iron fence and a hedge.Over the door it said MISS MATHESON'S ACADEMY OF THE THREE GRACES.Miss Matheson received them in a cozy little room.She was between eight hundred and nine hundred years of age, Nell estimated, and drank tea from fancy thimble size cups with pictures painted on them.Nell tried to sit up straight and be attentive, emulating certain proper young girls she had read about in the Primer, but her eye kept wandering to the contents of the bookshelves, the pictures painted on the tea service and the painting on the wall above Miss Matheson's head, which depicted three ladies prancing about in a grove in diaphanous attire."Our rolls are filled, the term has already begun, and you have none of the prerequisites.But you come with compelling recommendations," Miss Matheson said after she had peered lengthily at her small visitor."Pardon me, madam, but I do not understand," Nell said.Miss Matheson smiled, her face blooming into a sunburst of radiating wrinkles."It is not important.Let us only say that we have made room for you.This institution makes it a practice to accept a small number of students who are not New Atlantan subjects.The propagation of Atlantan memes is central to our mission, as a school and as a society.Unlike some phyles, which propagate through conversion or through indiscriminate exploitation of the natural biological capacity that is shared, for better or worse, by all persons, we appeal to the rational faculties.All children are born with rational faculties, which want only development.Our academy has recently welcomed several young ladies of extra Atlantan extraction, and it is our expectation that all will go on to take the Oath in due time. ""Pardon me, madam, but which one is Aglaia?"Nell said, looking over Miss Matheson's shoulder at the painting."I beg your pardon?"Miss Matheson said, and initiated the procedure of turning her head around to look, which at her age was a civil engineering challenge of daunting complexity and duration."As the name of your school is the Three Graces, I have ventured to assume that yonder painting depicts the same subject," Nell said, "since they look more like Graces than Furies or Fates.I wonder if you would be so kind as to inform me which of the ladies represents Aglaia, or brilliance. ""And the other two are?"Miss Matheson said, speaking out of the side of her mouth as she had almost got herself turned around by this point."Euphrosyne, or joy, and Thalia, or bloom," Nell said."Would you care to venture an opinion?"Miss Matheson said."The one on the right is carrying flowers, so perhaps she is Thalia. ""I would call that a sound assumption. ""The one in the middle looks so happy that she must be Euphrosyne, and the one on the left is lit up with rays of sunlight, so perhaps she is Aglaia. ""Well, as you can see, none of them is wearing a nametag, and so we must satisfy ourselves with conjecture," Miss Matheson said."But I fail to see any gaps in your reasoning.And no, I don't suppose they are Fates or Furies. "..."It's a boarding school, which means many of the pupils live there.But you won't live there," Rita said, "because it isn't proper. "They were riding Eggshell home through the woods."Why isn't it proper?""Because you ran away from home, which raises legal problems. ""Was it illegal for me to run away?""In some tribes, children are regarded as an economic asset of their parents.So if one phyle shelters runaways from another phyle, it has a possible economic impact which is covered under the CEP. "Rita looked back at Nell, appraising her coolly."You have a sponsor of sorts in New Atlantis.I don't know who.I don't know why.But it seems that this person cannot take the risk of being the target of CEP legal action.Hence arrangements have been made for you to stay in Dovetail for now."Now, we know that some of your mother's boyfriends treated you badly, and so there is sentiment in Dovetail to take you in.But we can't keep you at the Millstone community, because if we got into a fracas with Protocol, it could sour our relations with our New Atlantis clients.So it's been decided that you will stay with the one person in Dovetail who doesn't have any clients here. ""Who's that?""You've met him," Rita said.Constable Moore's house was dimly lit and so full of old stuff that even Nell had to walk sideways in some places.Long strips of yellowed rice paper, splashed with large Chinese characters and pimpled with red chop marks, hung from a molding that ran around the living room a foot or two beneath the ceiling.Nell followed Rita around a corner into an even smaller, darker, and more crowded room, whose main decoration was a large painting of a furious chap with a Fu Manchu mustache, goatee, and tufts of whiskers sprouting in front of his ears and trailing down below his armpits, wearing elaborate armor and chain mail decorated with lion's faces.Nell stepped away from this fierce picture despite herself, tripped over the drone of a large bagpipe splayed across the floor, and crashed into a large beaten copper bucket of sorts, which made tremendous smashing noises.Blood welled quietly from a smooth cut on the ball of her thumb, and she realized that the bucket was being used as a repository for a collection of old rusty swords of various descriptions."You all right?"Rita said.She was backlit with blue light coming in through a pair of glass doors.Nell put her thumb in her mouth and picked herself up.The glass doors looked out on Constable Moore's garden, a riot of geraniums, foxtails, wisteria, and corgi droppings.On the other side of a small khaki colored pool rose a small garden house.Like this one, it was built from blocks of reddish brown stone and roofed with rough edged slabs of green gray slate.Constable Moore himself could be descried behind a screen of somewhat leggy rhododendrons, hard at work with a shovel, continually harassed by the ankle biting corgis.He was not wearing a shirt, but he was wearing a skirt: a red plaid number.Nell hardly noticed this incongruity because the corgis heard Rita turning the latch on the glass doors and rushed toward them yapping, and this drew out the Constable himself, who approached them squinting through the dark glass, and once he was out from behind the rhodies, Nell could see that there was something amiss with the flesh of his body.Overall he was well proportioned, muscular, rather thick around the middle, and evidently in decent health.But his skin came in two colors, which gave him something of a marbled look.It was as though worms had eaten through his torso, carving out a network of internal passageways that had later been backfilled with something that didn't quite match.Before she could get a better look, he plucked a shirt from the back of a lawn chair and shrugged it on.Then he subjected the corgis to a minute or so of close order drill, using a patch of moss covered flagstones as parade ground, and stringently criticizing their performance in tones loud enough to penetrate through the glass doors.The corgis pretended to listen attentively.At the end of the performance, Constable Moore burst in through the glass doors."I shall be with you momentarily," he said, and disappeared into a back room for a quarter of an hour.When he returned, he was dressed in a tweed suit and a rough hewn sweater over a very fine looking white shirt.The last article looked too thin to prevent the others from being intolerably scratchy, but Constable Moore had reached the age when men can subject their bodies to the worst irritations whiskey, cigars, woolen clothes, bagpipes without feeling a thing or, at least, without letting on."Sorry to have burst in on you," Rita said, "but there was no answer when we rang the bell. ""I don't care," said Constable Moore, not entirely convincingly."There's a reason why I don't live up there. "He pointed upward, vaguely in the direction of the New Atlantis Clave."Just trying to trace the root system of some infernal vine back to its source.I'm afraid it might be kudzu. "The Constable narrowed his eyes as he spoke this word, and Nell, not knowing what kudzu was, supposed that if kudzu were something that could be attacked with a sword, burned, throttled, bludgeoned, or blown up, it would not stand a chance for long in Constable Moore's garden once, that is, he got round to it."Can I interest you in tea?Or" this was directed to Nell "some hot chocolate?""Sounds lovely, but I can't stay," Rita said."Then let me see you to the door," Constable Moore said, standing up.Rita looked a little startled by this abruptness, but in another moment she was gone, riding Eggshell back toward the Millhouse."Nice lady," Constable Moore muttered out in the kitchen."Fine of her to do what she did for you.Really a very decent lady.Perhaps not the sort who deals very well with children.Especially peculiar children. ""Am I to live here now, sir?"Nell said."Out in the garden house," he said, coming into the room with a steaming tray and nodding through the glass windows and across the garden."Vacant for some time.Cramped for an adult, perfect for a child.The decor of this house," he said, glancing around the room, "is not really suitable for a young one. ""Who is the scary man?"Nell said, pointing to the big painting."Guan Di.Emperor Guan.Formerly a soldier named Guan Yu.He was never really an emperor, but later on he became the Chinese god of war, and they gave him the title just to be respectful.Terribly respectful, the Chinese it's their best and worst feature. ""How could a man become a god?"Nell asked."By living in an extremely pragmatic society," said Constable Moore after some thought, and provided no further explanation."Do you have the book, by the way?""Yes, sir. ""You didn't take it through the border?""No, sir, as per your instructions. ""That's good.The ability to follow orders is a useful thing, especially if you're living with a chap who's used to giving them. "Seeing that Nell had gotten a terribly serious look on her face, the Constable huffed and looked exasperated."It doesn't really matter, mind you!You have friends in high places.It's just that we are trying to be discreet. "Constable Moore brought Nell her cup of cocoa.She needed one hand for the saucer and another for the cup, so she took her hand out of her mouth."What did you do to your hand?""Cut it, sir. ""Let me see that. "The Constable took her hand in his and peeled the thumb away from the palm."Quite a nice little slash.Looks recent. ""I got it from your swords. ""Ah, yes.Swords are that way," the Constable said absently, then screwed up his brow and turned back to Nell."You did not cry," he said, "and you did not complain. ""Did you take all of those swords away from burglars?"Nell said."No that would have been relatively easy," Constable Moore said.He looked at her for a while, pondering."Nell, you and I will do just fine together," he said."Let me get my first aid kit. "Carl Hollywood's activities at the Parnasse;  conversation over a milk shake;  explanation of the media system;  Miranda perceives the futility of her quest.Miranda found Carl Hollywood sitting fifth row center in the Parnasse, holding a big sheet of smart foolscap on which he had scrawled blocking diagrams for their next live production.He apparently had it crosslinked to a copy of the script, because as she sidestepped her way down the narrow aisle, she could hear voices rather mechanically reading lines, and as she came closer she could see the little X's and 0's representing the actors moving around on the diagram of the stage that Carl had sketched out.The diagram also included some little arrows along the periphery, all aimed inward.Miranda realized that the arrows must be the little spotlights mounted to the fronts of the balconies, and that Carl Hollywood was programming them.She rolled her head back and forth, trying to loosen up her neck, and looked up at the ceiling.The angels or Muses or whatever they were, were all parading around up there, accompanied by a few cherubs.Miranda thought of Nell.She always thought of Nell.The script came to the end of its scene, and Carl paused it."You had a question?"he asked, a bit absently."I've been watching you work from my box. ""Naughty girl.Should be making money for us. ""Where'd you learn to do that stuff?""What directing plays?""No.The technical stuff programming the lights and so on. "Carl turned around to look at her."This may be at odds with your notion of how people learn things," he said, "but I had to teach myself everything.Hardly anyone does live theatre anymore, so we have to develop our own technology.I invented all of the software I was just using. ""Did you invent the little spotlights?""No.I'm not as good at the nanostuff.A friend of mine in London came up with those.We swap stuff all the time my mediaware for his matterware. ""Well, I want to buy you dinner somewhere," Miranda said, "and I want you to explain to me how it all works. ""That's a rather tall order," Carl said calmly, "but I accept the invitation...."Okay, do you want a complete grounding in the whole thing, starting with Turing machines, or what?"Carl said pleasantly humoring her.Miranda decided not to become indignant.They were in a red vinyl booth at a restaurant near the Bund that supposedly simulated an American diner on the eve of the Kennedy assassination.Chinese hipsters classic Coastal Republic types in their expensive haircuts and sharp suits were lined up on the rotating stools along the lunch counter, sucking on their root beer floats and flashing wicked grins at any young women who came in."I guess so," Miranda said.Carl Hollywood laughed and shook his head."I was being facetious.You need to tell me exactly what you want to know.Why are you suddenly taking up an interest in this stuff?Aren't you happy just making a good living from it?"Miranda sat very still for a moment, hypnotized by the colorful flashing lights on a vintage jukebox."This is related to Princess Nell, isn't it?"Carl said."Is it that obvious?""Yeah.Now, what do you want?""I want to know who she is," Miranda said.This was the most guarded way she could put it.She didn't suppose that it would help matters to drag Carl down through the full depth of her emotions."You want to backtrace a payer," Carl said.It sounded terrible when he translated it into that kind of language.Carl sucked powerfully on his milk shake for a bit, his eyes looking over Miranda's shoulder to the traffic on the Bund."Princess Nell's a little kid, right?""Yes.I would estimate five to seven years old. "His eyes swiveled to lock on hers."You can tell that?""Yes," she said, in tones that warned him not to question it."So she's probably not paying the bill anyway.The payer is someone else.You need to backtrace the payer and then, from there, track down Nell. "Carl broke eye contact again, shook his head, and tried unsuccessfully to whistle through frozen lips."Even the first step is impossible. "Miranda was startled."That seems pretty unequivocal.I expected to hear 'difficult' or 'expensive. 'But "  "Nope.It's impossible.Or maybe" Carl thought about it for a while "maybe 'astronomically improbable' is a better way of putting it. "Then he looked mildly alarmed as he watched Miranda's expression change."You can't just trace the connection backward.That's not how media works. ""How does media work, then?""Look out the window.Not toward the Bund check out Yan'an Road. "Miranda swiveled her head around to look out the big window, which was partly painted over with colorful Coke ads and descriptions of blue plate specials.Yan'an Road, like all of the major thoroughfares in Shanghai, was filled, from the shop windows on one side to the shop windows on the other, with people on bicycles and powerskates.In many places the traffic was so dense that greater speed could be attained on foot.A few half lane vehicles sat motionless, polished boulders in a sluggish brown stream.It was so familiar that Miranda didn't really see anything."What am I looking for?""Notice how no one's empty handed?They're all carrying something. "Carl was right.At a minimum, everyone had a small plastic bag with something in it.Many people, such as the bicyclists, carried heavier loads."Now just hold that image in your head for a moment, and think about how to set up a global telecommunications network. "Miranda laughed."I don't have any basis for thinking about something like that. ""Sure you do.Until now, you've been thinking in terms of the telephone system in the old passives.In that system, each transaction had two participants the two people having the conversation.And they were connected by a wire that ran through a central switchboard.So what are the key features of this system?""I don't know I'm asking you," said Miranda."Number one, only two people, or entities, can interact.Number two, it uses a dedicated connection that is made and then broken for the purposes of that one conversation.Number three, it is inherently centralized it can't work unless there is a central switchboard. ""Okay, I think I'm following you so far. ""Our media system today the one that you and I make our livings from is a descendant of the phone system only insofar as we use it for essentially the same purposes, plus many, many more.But the key point to remember is that it is totally different from theold phone system.The old phone system and its technological cousin, the cable TV system tanked.It crashed and burned decades ago, and we started virtually from scratch. ""Why?It worked, didn't it?""First of all, we needed to enable interactions between more than one entity.What do I mean by entity?Well, think about the ractives.Think about First Class to Geneva.You're on this train so are a couple of dozen other people.Some of those people are being racted, so in that case the entities happen to be human beings.But others like the waiters and porters are just software robots.Furthermore, the train is full of props: jewelry, money, guns, bottles of wine.Each one of those is also a separate piece of software a separate entity.In the lingo, we call them objects.The train itself is another object, and so is the countryside through which it travels."The countryside is a good example.It happens to be a digital map of France.Where did this map come from?Did the makers of First Class to Geneva send out their own team of surveyors to make a new map of France?No, of course they didn't.They used existing data a digital map of the world that is available to any maker of ractives who needs it, for a price of course.That digital map is a separate object.It resides in the memory of a computer somewhere.Where exactly?I don't know.Neither does the ractive itself.Itdoesn't matter.The data might be in California, it might be in Paris, it might be down at the corner or it might be distributed among all of those places and many more.It doesn't matter.Because our media system no longer works like the old system dedicated wires passing through a central switchboard.It works like that. "Carl pointed to the traffic on the street again."So each person on the street is like an object?""Possibly.But a better analogy is that the objects are people like us, sitting in various buildings that front on the street.Suppose that we want to send a message to someone over in Pudong.We write the message down on a piece of paper, and we go to the door and hand it to the first person who goes by and say, 'Take this to Mr.Gu in Pudong. 'And he skates down the street for a while and runs into someone on a bicycle who looks like he might be headed for Pudong, and says, 'Take this to Mr.Gu. 'A minute later, that person gets stuck in traffic and hands it off to a pedestrian who can negotiate the snarl a little better, and so on and so on, until eventually it reaches Mr.Gu.When Mr.Gu wants to respond, he sends us a message in the same way. ""So there's no way to trace the path taken by a message. ""Right.And the real situation is even more complicated.The media net was designed from the ground up to provide privacy and security, so that people could use it to transfer money.That's one reason the nationstates collapsed as soon as the media grid was up and running, financial transactions could no longer be monitored by governments, and the tax collection systems got fubared.So if the old IRS, for example, wasn't able to trace these messages, then there's no way that you'll be able to track down Princess Nell. ""Okay, I guess that answers my question," Miranda said."Good!"Carl said brightly.He was obviously pleased that he'd been able to help Miranda, and so she didn't tell him how his words had really made her feel.She treated it as an acting challenge: Could she fool Carl Hollywood, who was sharper about acting than just about anyone, into thinking that she was fine?Apparently she did.He escorted her back to her flat, in a hundred story high rise just across the river in Pudong, and she held it together long enough to bid him good bye, get out of her clothes, and run a bath.Then she climbed into the hot water and dissolved in awful, wretched, blubbery, self pitying tears.Eventually she got it under control.She had to keep this in perspective.She could still interact with Nell and still did, every day.And if she paid attention, sooner or later she would find some way to penetrate the curtain.Barring that, she was beginning to understand that Nell, whoever she was, had been marked out in some way, and that in time she would become a very important person.Within a few years, Miranda expected to be reading about her in the newspaper.Feeling better, she got out of the bath and climbed into bed, getting a good night's sleep so she'd be ready for her next day of taking care of Nell.General description of life with the Constable;  his avocations and other peculiarities;  a disturbing sight;  Nell learns about his past;  a conversation over dinner.The garden house had two rooms, one for sleeping and one for playing.The playing room had a set of double doors, made of many small windows, that opened onto Constable Moore's garden.Nell had been told to be careful with the little windows, because they were made of real glass.The glass was bubbly and uneven, like the surface of a pot of water just before it breaks into a boil, and Nell liked to look at things through it because, even though she knew it was not as strong as a common window, it made her feel safer, as though she were hiding behind something.The garden itself was forever trying to draw the little house into it; many vast growing vines of ivy, wisteria, and briar rose were deeply engaged in the important project of climbing the walls, using the turtleshell colored copper drainpipes, and the rough surfaces of the brick and mortar, as fingerholds.The slate roof of the cottage was phosphorescent with moss.From time to time, Constable Moore would charge into the breach with a pair of trimmers and cut away some of the vines that so prettily framed the view through Nell's glass doors, lest they imprison her.During Nell's second year living in the cottage, she asked the Constable if she might have a bit of garden space of her own, and after an early phase of profound shock and misgivings, the Constable eventually pulled up a few flagstones, exposing a small plot, and caused one of the Dovetail artisans to manufacture some copper window boxes and attach them to the cottage walls.In the plot, Nell planted some carrots, thinking about her friend Peter who had vanished so long ago, and in the window boxes she planted some geraniums.The Primer taught her how to do it and also reminded her to dig up a carrot sprout every few days and examine it so that she could learn how they grew.Nell learned that if she held the Primer above the carrot and stared at a certain page, it would turn into a magic illustration that would grow larger and larger until she could see the tiny little fibers that grew out of the roots, and the one celled organisms clinging to the fibers, and the mitochondria inside them.The same trick worked on anything, and she spent many days examining flies' eyes, bread mold, and blood cells that she got out of her own body by pricking her finger.She could also go up on hilltops during cold clear nights and use the Primer to see the rings of Saturn and the moons of Jupiter.Constable Moore continued to work his daily shift at the gatehouse.When he came home in the evening, he and Nell would often dine together inside his house.At first they got food straight from the M. C. , or else the Constable would fry up something simple, like sausage and eggs.During this period, Princess Nell and the other characters in the Primer found themselves eating a lot of sausage and eggs too, until Duck lodged a protest and taught the Princess how to cook healthier food.Nell then got in the habit of cooking a healthy meal with salad and vegetables, several afternoons a week after she got home from school.There was some grumbling from the Constable, but he always cleaned up his plate and sometimes washed the dishes.The Constable spent a lot of time reading books.Nell was welcome to be in his house when he was doing this, as long as she was quiet.Frequently he would shoo her out, and then he would get in touch with some old friend of his over the big mediatron on the wall of his library.Usually Nell would just go back to her little cottage during these times, but sometimes, especially if the moon was full, she would wander around in the garden.This seemed larger than it really was by virtue of being divided into many small compartments.On late full moon nights, her favorite place was a grove of tall green bamboo with some pretty rocks strewn around.She would sit with her back against a rock, read her Primer, and occasionally hear sound emanating from the inside of Constable Moore's house as he talked on the mediatron: mostly deep bellowing laughter and explosions of good natured profanity.For quite some time she assumed that it was not the Constable who was making these sounds, but rather whomever he was talking to; because in her presence the Constable was always very polite and reserved, albeit somewhat eccentric.But one night she heard loud moaning noises coming from his house, and crept down out of the bamboo grove to see what was happening.From her vantage point through the glass doors, she couldn't see the mediatron, which was facing away from her.Its light illuminated the whole room, painting the normally warm and cozy space with lurid flashing colors, and throwing long jagged shadows.Constable Moore had shoved all the furniture and other obstructions to the walls and rolled up the Chinese carpet to expose the floor, which Nell had always assumed was made of oak, like the floor in her cottage; but the floor was, in fact, a large mediatron itself, glowing rather dimly compared to the one on the wall, and displaying a lot of rather high resolution material: text documents and detailed graphics with the occasional dine feed.The Constable was down on his hands and knees amidst this, bawling like a child, the tears collecting in the shallow saucers of his half glasses and spattering onto the mediatron, which illuminated them weirdly from below.Nell wanted badly to go in and comfort him, but she was too scared.She stood and watched, frozen in indecision, and realized as she did so that the flashes of light coming from the mediatrons reminded her of explosions or rather pictures of explosions.She backed away and went back into her little house.Half an hour later, she heard the unearthly noise of Constable Moore's bagpipes emanating from the bamboo grove.In the past he had occasionally picked them up and made a few squealing noises, but this was the first time she'd heard a formal recital.She was not an expert on the pipes, but she thought he sounded not bad.He was playing a slow number, a coronach, and it was so sad that it almost tore Nell's heart asunder; the sight of the Constable weeping helplessly on his hands and knees was not half so sad as the music he was playing now.In time he moved on to a faster and happier pibroch.Nell emerged from her cottage into the garden.The Constable was just a silhouette slashed into a hundred ribbons by the vertical shafts of the bamboo, but when she moved back and forth, some trick of her eye reassembled the image.He was standing in a pool of moonlight.He had changed clothes: now he was wearing his kilt, and a shirt and beret that seemed to belong to some sort of a uniform.When his lungs were empty, he would draw in a great breath, his chest would heave, and an array of silvery pins and insignia would glimmer in the moonlight.He had left the doors open.She walked into the house, not bothering to be stealthy because she knew that she could not possibly be heard over the sound of the bagpipe.The wall and the floor were both giant mediatrons, and both had been covered with a profusion of media windows, hundreds and hundreds of separate panes, like a wall on a busy city street where posters and bills have been pasted up in such abundance that they have completely covered the substrate.Some of the panes were only as big as the palm of Nell's hand, and some of them were the size of wall posters.Most of the ones on the floor were windows into written documents, grids of numbers, schematic diagrams (lots of organizational trees), or wonderful maps, drawn with breathtaking precision and clarity, with rivers, mountains, and villages labeled in Chinese characters.As Nell surveyed this panorama, she flinched once or twice from the impression that something small was creeping along the floor; but there were no bugs in the room, it was just an illusion created by small fluctuations in the maps and in the rows and columns of numbers.These things were ractive, just like the words in the Primer; but unlike the Primer, they were responding not to what Nell did but, she supposed, to events far away.When she finally raised her gaze from the floor to view the mediatrons lining the walls, she saw that most of the panes there were much larger, and most of them carried dine feeds, and most of these had been frozen.The images were very sharp and clear.Some of them were landscapes: a stretch of rural road, a bridge across a dried up river, a dusty village with flames bubbling from some of the houses.Some of them were pictures of people: talking head shots of Chinese men wearing dirty uniforms with dark mountains, clouds of dust, or drab green vehicles as backdrops.In one of the dine feeds, a man was lying on the ground, his dusty uniform almost the same color as the dirt.Suddenly this image moved; the feed had not been frozen like the others.Someone was walking past the camera: a Chinese man in indigo pajamas, decorated with scarlet ribbons tied round his head and his waist, though these had gone brown with grime.When he had passed out of the frame, Nell focused on the other man, the one who was lying in the dust, and she realized for the first time that he did not have a head.Constable Moore must have heard Nell's screaming over the sound of his bagpipes, for he was in the room within a few moments, shouting commands to the mediatrons, which all went black and became mere walls and a floor.The only image remaining in the room now was the big painting of Guan Di, the god of war, who glowered down upon them as always.Constable Moore was extremely ill at ease whenever Nell showed any kind of emotion, but he seemed more comfortable with hysteria than he was with, say, an invitation to play house or an attack of the giggles.He picked Nell up, carried her across the room at arm's length, and set her down in a deep leather chair.He left the room for a moment and came back with a large glass of water, then carefully molded her hands around it."You must breathe deeply and drink water," he was saying, almost sotto voce; he seemed to have been saying it for a long time.She was a little surprised to find that she did not cry forever, though a few aftershocks came along and had to be managed in the same way.She kept trying to say, "I can't stop crying," stabbing the syllables one at a time.The tenth or eleventh time she said this, Constable Moore said,  "You can't stop drying because you're all fucked up psychologically. "He said it in a kind of bored professional tone that might have sounded cruel; but to Nell it was, for some reason, most reassuring."What do you mean?"she said finally, when she could speak without her throat going all funny."I mean you're a veteran, girl, just like me, and you've got scars" he suddenly ripped his shirt open, buttons flying and bouncing all over the room, to reveal his particolored torso "like I do.The difference is, I know I'm a veteran.You persist in thinking you're just a little girl, like those bloody Vickys you go to school with. "...From time to time, perhaps once a year, he would turn down the offer of dinner, put that uniform on, climb onto a horse, and ride off in the direction of the New Atlantis Clave.The horse would bring him back in the wee hours of the morning, so drunk he could barely remain in the saddle.Sometimes Nell would help get him into bed, and after he had lapsed into unconsciousness, she could examine his pins and medals and ribbons by candlelight.The ribbons in particular used a fairly elaborate color coding system.But the Primer had some pages in the back that were called the Encyclopdia, and by consulting these, Nell was able to establish that Constable Moore was, or at least had used to be, a brigadier general in the Second Brigade of the Third Division of the First Protocol Enforcement Expeditionary Force.One ribbon implied that he had spent some time as an exchange officer in a Nipponese division, but his home division was apparently the Third.According to the Encyclopdia, the Third was often known as the Junkyard Dogs or, simply, the Mongrels, because it tended to draw its members from the White Diaspora: Uitlanders, Ulster Loyalists, whites from Hong Kong, and rootless sorts from all of the Anglo American parts of the world.One of the pins on the Constable's uniform said that he had graduate level training in nanotechnological engineering.This was consistent with his belonging to the Second Brigade, which specialized in nanotech warfare.The Encyclopdia said that it had been formed some thirty years ago to tackle some nasty fighting in Eastern Europe where primitive nanotech weapons were being employed.A couple of years later, the division had been sent off to South China in a panic.Trouble had been brewing there since Zhang Han Hua had gone on his Long Ride and forced the merchants to kowtow.Zhang had personally liberated several lao gai damps, where slave laborers were hard at work making trinkets for export to the West, smashing computer display screens with the massive dragon's head grip of his cane, beating the overseers into bloody heaps on the ground.Zhang's "investigations" of various thriving businesses, mostly in the south, had thrown millions of people out of work.They had gone into the streets and raised hell and been joined by sympathetic units of the People's Liberation Army.The rebellion was eventually put down by PLA units from the north, but the leaders had vanished into the "concrete countryside" of the Pearl Delta, and so Zhang had been forced to set up a permanent garrison state in the south.The northern troops had kept order crudely but effectively for a few years, until, one night, an entire division of them, some 15,000 men, was wiped out by an infestation of nanosites.The leaders of the rebellion emerged from their hiding places, proclaimed the Coastal Republic, and called for Protocol Enforcement troops to come in and protect them.Colonel Arthur Hornsby Moore, a veteran of the fighting in Eastern Europe, was brought in to command.He had been born in Hong Kong, left as a small child when the Chinese took it over, spent much of his youth wandering around Asia with his parents, and eventually settled in the British Isles.He was picked for the job because he was fluent in Cantonese and not half bad in Mandarin.Looking at the old cine clips in the Encyclopdia, Nell could see a younger Constable Moore, the same man with more hair and fewer doubts.The Chinese Civil War began in earnest three years later, when the Northerns, who didn't have access to nanotech, started lobbing nukes.Not long afterward, the Muslim nations had finally gotten their act together and overrun much of Xinjiang Province, killing some of the Han Chinese population and driving the rest eastward into the maw of the civil war.Colonel Moore suffered an extremely dire infestation of primitive nanosites and was removed from the action and put on extended convalescent leave.By that time, the truce line between the Celestial Kingdom and the Coastal Republic had been established.Since then, as Nell knew from her studies at the Academy, Lau Ge had succeeded Zhang as the northern leader the leader of the Celestial Kingdom.After a decent interval had passed, he had thoroughly purged all remaining traces of Communist ideology, denouncing it as a Western imperialist plot, and proclaimed himself Chamberlain to the Throneless King.The Throneless King was Confucius, and Lau Ge was now the highest ranking of all the mandarins.The Encyclopdia did not say much more about Colonel Arthur Hornsby Moore, except that he'd resurfaced as an adviser a few years later during some outbreaks of nanotech terrorism in Germany, and later retired and became a security consultant.In this latter capacity he had helped to promulgate the concept of defense in depth, around which all modern cities, including Atlantis/Shanghai, were built....Nell cooked the Constable an especially nice dinner one Saturday, and when they were finished with dessert, she began to tell him about Harv and Tequila, and Harv's tales of the incomparable Bud, their dear departed father.Suddenly it was about three hours later, and Nell was still telling the Constable stories about Mom's boyfriends, and the Constable was continuing to listen, reaching up occasionally to fiddle with his white beard but otherwise displaying an extremely grave and thoughtful countenance.Finally she got to the part about Burt, and how Nell had tried to kill him with the screwdriver, and how he had chased them down the stairs and apparently met his demise at the hands of the mysterious round headed Chinese gentleman.The Constable found this extremely interesting and asked many questions, first about the detailed tactical development of the screwdriver assault and then about the style of dancing used by the Chinese gentleman, and what he was wearing."I have been angry at my Primer ever since that night," Nell said."Why?"said the Constable, looking surprised, though he was hardly more surprised than Nell herself.Nell had said a remarkable number of things this evening without having ever, to her memory, thought them first; or at least she didn't believe she had ever thought them before."I cannot help but feel that it misled me.It made me suppose that killing Burt would be a simple matter, and that it would improve my life; but when I tried to put these ideas into practice ... "She could not think of what to say next."...the rest of your life happened," the Constable said."Girl, you must admit that your life with Burt dead has been an improvement on your life with Burt alive. ""Yes. ""So the Primer was correct on that point.Now, as to the fact that killing people is a more complicated business in practice than in theory, I will certainly concede your point.But I think it is not likely to be the only instance in which real life turns out to be more complicated than what you have seen in the book.This is the Lesson of the Screwdriver, and you would do well to remember it.All it amounts to is that you must be ready to learn from sources other than your magic book. ""But of what use is the book then?""I suspect it is very useful.You want only the knack of translating its lessons into the real world.For example," the Constable said, plucking his napkin from his lap and crushing it into the tabletop, "let us take something very concrete, such as beating the bejesus out of people. "He stood up and tromped out into the garden.Nell ran after him."I have seen you doing your martial arts exercises," he said, switching to a peremptory outdoor voice, an addressing the troops voice."Martial arts means beating the bejesus out of people.Now, let us see you try your luck with me. "Negotiations ensued as Nell endeavored to establish whether the Constable was serious.This being accomplished, she sat down on the flagstones and began getting her shoes off.The Constable watched her with raised eyebrows."Oh, that's very formidable," he said."All evildoers had best be on the lookout for little Nell unless she happens to be wearing her bloody shoes. "Nell did a couple of stretching exercises, ignoring more derisive commentary from the Constable.She bowed to him, and he waved his hand at her dismissively.She got set into the stance that Dojo had taught her.In response, the Constable moved his feet about an inch farther apart than they had been, and pooched his belly out, which was apparently the chosen stance of some mysterious Scottish fighting technique.Nothing happened for a long time except for a lot of dancing around.Nell danced, that is, and the Constable blundered around desultorily."What's this?"he said."All you know is defense?""Mostly, sir," Nell said."I do not suppose it was the Primer's intention to teach me how to assault people. ""Oh, what good is that?"the Constable sneered, and suddenly he reached out and grabbed Nell by the hair not hard enough to hurt.He held her for a few moments, and then let her go."Thus endeth the first lesson," he said."You think that I should cut my hair off?"The Constable looked terribly disappointed."Oh, no," he said,  "never, ever, ever cut your hair off.If I grabbed you by your wrist" and he did "would you cut your arm off?""No, sir. ""Did the Primer teach you that people would pull your hair?""No, sir. ""Did it teach you that your mother's boyfriends would beat you up, and your mother not protect you?""No, sir, except insofar as it told me stories about people who did evil. ""People doing evil is a good lesson.What you saw in there a few weeks ago" and by this Nell knew he was referring to the headless soldier on the mediatron "is one application of that lesson, but it's too obvious to be of any good.Ah, but your mother not protecting you from boyfriends that has some subtlety, doesn't it?"Nell," the Constable continued, indicating through his tone of voice that the lesson was concluding, "the difference between ignorant and educated people is that the latter know more facts.But that has nothing to do with whether they are stupid or intelligent.The difference between stupid and intelligent people and this is true whether or not they are well educated is that intelligent people can handle subtlety.They are not baffled by ambiguous or even contradictory situations in fact, they expect them and are apt to become suspicious when things seem overly straightforward."In your Primer you have a resource that will make you highly educated, but it will never make you intelligent.That comes from life.Your life up to this point has given you all of the experience you need to be intelligent, but you have to think about those experiences.If you don't think about them, you'll be psychologically unwell.If you do think about them, you will become not merely educated but intelligent, and then, a few years down the road, you will probably give me cause to wish I were several decades younger. "The Constable turned and walked back into his house, leaving Nell alone in the garden, pondering the meaning of that last statement.She supposed it was the sort of thing she might understand later, when she had become intelligent.Carl Hollywood returns from abroad;  he and Miranda discuss the status and future of her racting career.Carl Hollywood came back from a month long trip to London, where he'd been visiting old friends, catching some live theatre, and making face to face contacts with some of the big ractive developers, hoping to swing some contracts in their direction.When he got back, the whole company threw a party for him in the theatre's little bar.Miranda thought she handled it pretty well.But the next day he cornered her backstage."What's up?"he said."And I don't mean that in the usual offhanded way.I want to know what's going on with you.Why have you switched to the evening shift during my absence?And why were you acting so weird at the party?""Well, Nell and I have had an interesting few months. "Carl looked startled, stepped back half a pace, then sighed and rolled his eyes."Of course, her altercation with Burt was traumatic, but she seems to have dealt with it well. ""Who's Burt?""I have no idea.Someone who was physically abusing her.Apparently she managed to find some kind of new living situation in short order, probably with the assistance of her brother Harv, who has, however, not stayed with her he's stuck in the same old bad situation, while Nell has moved on to something better. ""She has?That's good news," said Carl, only half sarcastically.Miranda smiled at him."See?That's exactly the kind of feedback I need.I don't talk about this stuff to anyone because I'm afraid they'll think I'm mad.Thank you.Keep it up. ""What is Nell's new situation?"Carl Hollywood asked contritely."I think she's in school somewhere.She appears to be learning new material that isn't explicitly covered in the Primer, and she's developing more sophisticated forms of social interaction, suggesting that she's spending more time around a higher class of people. ""Excellent. ""She's not as concerned with immediate issues of physical self defense, so I gather that she's in a safe living situation.However, her new guardian must be an emotionally distant sort, because she frequently seeks solace under the wings of Duck. "Carl looked funny."Duck?""One of four personages who accompanies and advises Princess Nell.Duck embodies domestic, maternal virtues.Actually, Peter and Dinosaur are now gone both male figures who embodied survival skills. ""Who's the fourth one?""Purple.I think she'll become a lot more relevant to Nell's life around puberty. ""Puberty?You said Nell was between five and seven. ""So?""You think you'll still be doing this " Carl's voice wound down to a stop as he worked out the implications.   "for at least six or eight years.Oh yes, I should certainly think so.It's a very serious commitment, raising a child. ""Oh, god!"Carl Hollywood said, and collapsed into a big, tatty, overstuffed chair they kept backstage for such purposes."That's why I've switched to the evening shift.Ever since Nell started going to school, she's started using the Primer exclusively in the evening.Apparently she's in a time zone within one or two hours of this one. ""Good," Carl muttered, "that narrows it down to about half of the world's population. ""What's the problem here?"Miranda said."It's not like I'm not getting paid for this. "Carl gave her a good, dispassionate, searching look."Yes.It brings in adequate revenue. "Three girls go exploring;  a conversation between Lord Finkle McGraw and Mrs.Hackworth;  afternoon at the estate.Three girls moved across the billiard table lawn of a great manor house, circling and swarming about a common center of gravity like gamboling sparrows.Sometimes they would stop, turn inward to face one another, and engage in animated discussion.Then they would suddenly take off running, seemingly free from the constraints of inertia, like petals struck by a gust of spring wind.They wore long heavy wool coats over their dresses to protect them from the cool damp air of New Chusan's high central plateau.They seemed to be making their way toward an expanse of broken ground some half mile distant, separated from the great house's formal gardens by a gray stone wall splashed with bits of lime green and lavender where moss and lichen had taken hold.The terrain beyond the wall was a muted hazel color, like a bolt of Harris tweed that has tumbled from the back of a wagon and come undone, though the incipient blooming of the heather had flung a pale violet mist across it, nearly transparent but startlingly vivid in those places where the observer's line of sight grazed the natural slope of the terrain if the word natural could properly be applied to any feature of this island.Otherwise as light and free as birds, the girls were each weighed down by a small burden that seemed incongruous in the present setting, for the efforts of the adults to persuade them to leave their books behind had, as ever, been unavailing.One of the observers had eyes only for the little girl with long flamecolored hair.Her connexion to that child was suggested by her auburn hair and eyebrows.She was dressed in a hand sewn frock of woven cotton, whose crispness betrayed its recent provenance in a milliner's atelier in Dovetail.If the gathering had included more veterans of that elongated state of low intensity warfare known as Society, this observation would have been keenly made by those soi disant sentries who stood upon the battlements, keeping vigil against bounders who would struggle their way up the vast glacis separating wage slaves from Equity Participants.It would have been duly noted and set forth in the oral tradition that Gwendolyn Hackworth, though attractive, hard waisted, and poised, lacked the confidence to visit Lord Finkle McGraw's house in anything other than a new dress made for the occasion.The gray light suffusing the drawing room through its high windows was as gentle as mist.As Mrs.Hackworth stood enveloped in that light, sipping beige tea from a cup of translucent bone china, her face let down its guard and betrayed some evidence of her true state of mind.Her host, Lord Finkle McGraw, thought that she looked drawn and troubled, though her vivacious comportment during the first hour of their interview had led him to suppose otherwise.Sensing that his gaze had lingered on her face for longer than was strictly proper, he looked to the three little girls ambling across the garden.One of the girls had raven hair that betrayed her partly Korean heritage; but having established her whereabouts as a sort of reference point, he shifted his attention to the third girl, whose hair was about halfway through a natural and gradual transition from blond to brown.This girl was the tallest of the three, though all were of about the same age; and though she participated freely in all of their lighthearted games, she rarely initiated them and, when left to her own devices, tended toward a grave mien that made her seem years older than her playmates.As the Equity Lord watched the trio's progress, he sensed that even the style of her movement was different from the others'; she was lithe and carefully balanced, while they bounded unpredictably like rubber balls on rough hewn stone.The difference was (as he realized, watching them more keenly) that Nell always knew where she was going.Elizabeth and Fiona never did.This was a question not of native intelligence (Miss Matheson's tests and observations proved that much) but of emotional stance.Something in the girl's past had taught her, most forcefully, the importance of thinking things through."I ask you for a prediction, Mrs.Hackworth.Which one shall reach the moor first?"At the sound of his voice, Mrs.Hackworth recomposed her face."This sounds like a letter to the etiquette columnist of the Times.If I try to flatter you by guessing that it will be your granddaughter, am I implicitly accusing her of impulsiveness?"The Equity Lord smiled tolerantly."Let us set aside etiquette a social convention not relevant to this enquiry and be scientific. ""Ah.If only my John were here. "He is here, Lord Finkle McGraw thought, in each one of thosebooks.But he didn't say it."Very well, I will expose myself to the risk of humiliation by predicting that Elizabeth reaches the wall first; that Nell finds the secret way through; but that your daughter is the first one to venture through it. ""I'm sure you could never be humiliated in my presence, Your Grace," Mrs.Hackworth said.It was something she had to say, and he did not really hear it.They turned back to the windows.When the girls had reached to within a stone's throw of the wall, they began to move toward it more purposefully.Elizabeth broke free from the group, ran forward, and was the first to touch the cool stones, followed a few paces later by Fiona.Nell was far behind, not having altered her steady stride."Elizabeth is a Duke's granddaughter, accustomed to having her way, and has no natural reticence; she surges to the fore and claims the goal as her birthright," Finkle McGraw explained."But she has not really thought about what she is doing. "Elizabeth and Fiona both had their hands on the wall now, as if it were Home in a game of tag.But Nell had stopped and was turning her head from side to side, surveying the length of the wall as it clambered and tumbled over the increasingly rough shape of the land.After some time she held out one hand, pointing at a section of the wall a short distance away, and began to move toward it."Nell stands above the fray and thinks," Finkle McGraw said."To the other girls, the wall is a decorative feature, no?A pretty thing to run to and explore.But not to Nell.Nell knows what a wall is.It is a knowledge that went into her early, knowledge she doesn't have to think about.Nell is more interested in gates than in walls.Secret hidden gates are particularly interesting. "Fiona and Elizabeth moved uncertainly, trailing their tiny pink hands across the damp stone, unable to see where Nell was leading them.Nell strode across the grass until she had reached a small declivity.She almost disappeared into it as she clambered down toward the foundation of the wall."An opening for drainage," Finkle McGraw explained."Please do not be concerned.I happened to ride that way this morning.The current is only ankle deep, and the diameter of the culvert just right for eight yearold girls.The passage is several meters long more promising than threatening, I should hope. "Fiona and Elizabeth moved cautiously, startled by Nell's discovery.All three of the girls disappeared into the cleft.A few moments later, a blaze of fiery red could be descried bouncing rapidly across the moor beyond the wall.Fiona clambered up a small outcropping of rocks that marked the beginning of the moor, and beckoned excitedly to her companions."The secret passage is found by Nell, but she is cautious and patient.Elizabeth is taken aback by her early impulsiveness she feels foolish and perhaps even a bit sullen.Fiona "  "Fiona sees a magical gateway to an enchanted kingdom, no doubt," Mrs.Hackworth said, "and even now is crestfallen to find that you have not stocked the premises with unicorns and dragons.She would not hesitate for a moment to fly down that tunnel.This world is not where my Fiona wants to live, Your Grace.She wants another world, where magic is everywhere, and stories come to life, and ... "Her voice trailed away, and she cleared her throat uncomfortably.Lord Finkle McGraw glanced at her and saw pain in her face, quickly masked.He understood the rest of her sentence without hearing it: ...and my husband is here with us.A pair of riders, a man and a woman, trotted up a gravel path that ran along the edge of the gardens, through a pair of wrought iron gates in the stone wall, which opened for them.The man was Lord Finkle McGraw's son Colin, the woman was his wife, and they had ridden out onto the moor to keep an eye on their daughter and her two little friends.Seeing that their supervision was no longer required, Lord Finkle McGraw and Mrs.Hackworth turned away from the window and drew instinctively closer to a fire burning in a stone fireplace the size of a garage.Mrs.Hackworth sat down in a small rocker, and the Equity Lord chose an old and incongruously battered leather wing chair.A servant poured more tea.Mrs.Hackworth set the saucer and cup in her lap, guarding it with her hands, and collected herself."I have been desirous of making certain enquiries regarding my husband's whereabouts and activities, which have been a mystery to me almost since the moment he departed," she said, "and yet I was led to believe, from the very general and guarded statements he made to me, that the nature of those activities is secret, and that, if Your Grace has any knowledge of them and that you do, is of course merely a convenient supposition on my part you must treat that knowledge with flawless discretion.It goes without saying, I trust, that I would not use even my feeble powers of persuasion to induce you to violate the trust reposed in you by a higher power. ""Let us take it as a given that both of us will do what is honourable," Finkle McGraw said with a reassuringly casual smile."Thank you.My husband continues to write me letters, every week or so, but they are extremely general, nonspecific, and perfunctory.But in recent months, these letters have become full of strange images and emotions.They are bizarre.I have begun to fear for my husband's mental stability, and for the prospects of any undertaking that relies upon his good judgment.And while I would not hesitate to tolerate his absence for as long as is necessary for him to carry out his duties, the uncertainty has become most trying for me. ""I am not wholly ignorant of the matter, and I do not think I am violating any trust when I say that you are not the only person who has been surprised by the duration of his absence," Lord Finkle McGraw said."Unless I am very much mistaken, those who conceived of his mission never imagined that it would last for so long.It may ease your suffering in some small degree to know that he is not thought to be in danger. "Mrs.Hackworth smiled dutifully, and not for very long."Little Fiona seems to handle her father's absence well. ""Oh, but to Fiona, he has never been gone," Mrs.Hackworth said."It is the book, you see, that ractive book.When John gave it to her, just before he departed, he said that it was magic, and that he would talk to her through it.I know it's nonsense, of course, but she really believes that whenever she opens that book, her father reads her a story and even plays with her in an imaginary world, so that she hasn't really missed him at all.I haven't the heart to tell her that it's nothing more than a computerized media programme. ""I am inclined to believe that, in this case, keeping her in ignorance is a very wise policy," Finkle McGraw said."It has served her well thus far.But as time goes on, she is more and more flighty and less disposed to concentrate on her schoolwork.She lives in a fantasy and is happy there.But when she learns that the fantasy is just that, I fear it will not go well for her. ""She is hardly the first young lady to display signs of a vivid imagination," the Equity Lord said."Sooner or later they seem to turn out all right. "The three little explorers, and their two adult outriders, returned to the great house shortly.Lord Finkle McGraw's desolate private moor was as alienated from the tastes of little girls as single malt whiskey, Gothic architecture, muted colors, and Bruckner symphonies.Once they had reached it and found that it was not equipped with pink unicorns, cotton candy vendors, teen idol bands, or fluorescent green water slides, they lost interest and began to gravitate toward the house which in and of itself was far from Disneyland, but in which a practiced and assertive user like Elizabeth could find a few consolatory nuggets, such as a full time kitchen staff, trained in (among many other, completely useless skills) the preparation of hot chocolate.Having come as close to the subject of John Percival Hackworth's disappearance as they dared, and careened past it with no damage except some hot faces and watery eyes, Lord Finkle McGraw and Mrs.Hackworth had withdrawn, by mutual consent, to cooler subjects.The girls would come inside to drink some hot chocolate, and then it would be time for the guests to repair to the quarters assigned them for the day, where they could freshen up and dress for the main event: dinner."I should be pleased to look after the other little girl Nell  until the dinner hour," Mrs.Hackworth said."I noticed that the gentleman who brought her round this morning has not returned from the hunt. "The Equity Lord chuckled as he imagined General Moore trying to help a little girl dress for dinner.He was graceful enough to know his limits, and so he was spending the day shooting on the remoter stretches of the estate."Little Nell has a talent for looking after herself and may not need or wish to accept your most generous offer.But she might enjoy spending the interim with Fiona. ""Forgive me, Your Grace, but I am startled that you would consider leaving a child of her age unattended for most of the afternoon. ""She would not view it in that way, I assure you, for the same reason that little Fiona does not think of her father as ever having left your house. "The expression that passed over Mrs.Hackworth's face as she heard this statement suggested less than perfect comprehension.But before she could explain to her host the error of his ways, they were interrupted by the sound of a shrill and bitter conflict making its way down the hall toward them.The door swung open halfway, and Colin Finkle McGraw appeared.His face was still ruddy from the wind on the moor, and it bore a forced grin that was not terribly distant from a smirk; though his brow knit up periodically as Elizabeth emitted an especially piercing shriek of anger.In one hand he held a copy of the Young Lady's Illustrated Primer.Behind him, Mrs.Finkle McGraw could be seen holding Elizabeth by the wrist in a grip that recalled the blacksmith's tongs holding a dangerously hot ingot ready for smiting; and the radiant glow of the little girl's face perfected that analogy.She had bent down so that her face was level with Elizabeth's and was hissing something to her in a low and reproaching tone."Sorry, Father," the younger Finkle McGraw said in a voice slathered with not very convincing synthetic good humor."Nap time, obviously. "He nodded to the other."Mrs.Hackworth. "Then his eyes returned to his father's face and followed the Equity Lord's gaze downward to the book."She was rude to the servants, Father, and so we have confiscated the book for the rest of the afternoon.It's the only punishment that seems to sink in we employ it with some frequency. ""Then perhaps it is not sinking in as well as you suppose," Lord Finkle McGraw said, looking sad and sounding bemused.Colin Finkle McGraw chose to interpret this remark as a witticism targeted primarily at Elizabeth but then, parents of small children must perforce have an entirely different sense of irony than unimpaired humankind."We can't let her spend her life between the covers of your magical book, Father, It is like a little interactive empire, with Elizabeth the empress, issuing all sorts of perfectly bloodcurdling decrees to her obedient subjects.It's important to bring her back to reality from time to time, so that she can get some perspective. ""Perspective.Very well, I shall look forward to seeing you and Elizabeth, with her new perspective, at dinner. ""Good afternoon, Father.Mrs.Hackworth," the younger man said, and closed the door, a heavy masterpiece of the woodcarver's art and a fairly effective decibel absorbant.Gwendolyn Hackworth now saw something in Lord Finkle McGraw's face that made her want to leave the room.After speeding through the obligatory pleasantries, she did.She collected Fiona from the chimneycorner where she was cherishing the dregs of her hot chocolate.Nell was there too, reading her copy of the Primer, and Gwendolyn was startled to see that she had not touched her drink at all."What is this?"she exclaimed in what she took to be an appropriately sugary voice."A little girl who doesn't like hot chocolate?"Nell was deeply absorbed in her book, and for a moment Gwendolyn thought that her words had gone unheard.But a few beats later it became evident that the child was merely postponing her response until she reached the end of a chapter.Then she raised her eyes slowly from the page of the book.Nell was a reasonably attractive girl in the way that almost all girls are before immoderate tides of hormones start to make different parts of their faces grow out of proportion to others; she had light brown eyes, glowing orange in the light of the fire, with a kind of feral slant to them.Gwendolyn found it difficult to break her gaze; she felt like a captured butterfly staring up through a magnifying lens into the calm, keen eye of the naturalist."Chocolate is fine," Nell said."The question is, do I need it. "There was a rather long pause in the conversation as Gwendolyn groped for something to say.Nell did not seem to be awaiting a response; she had delivered her opinion and was done with it."Well," Gwendolyn finally said, "if you should decide that there is anything you do need, please know that I would be happy to assist you. ""Your offer is most kind.I am in your debt, Mrs.Hackworth," Nell said.She said it perfectly, like a princess in a book."Very well.Good afternoon," Gwendolyn said.She took Fiona's hand and led her upstairs.Fiona dawdled in a way that was almost perfectly calculated to annoy, and responded to her mother's questions only with nods and shakes of the head, because, as always, her mind was elsewhere.Once they had reached their temporary quarters in the guest wing, Gwendolyn got Fiona settled into bed for a nap, then sat down at an escritoire to work her way through some pending correspondence.But now Mrs.Hackworth found that her own mind was elsewhere, as she pondered these three very strange girls the three smartest little girls in Miss Matheson's Academy each with her very strange relationship with her Primer.Her gaze drifted away from the sheets of mediatronic paper scattered about the escritoire, out the window, and across the moor, where a gentle shower had begun to fall.She devoted the better part of an hour to worrying about girls and Primers.Then she remembered an assertion that her host had made that afternoon, which she had not fully appreciated at the time: These girls weren't any stranger than any other girls, and to blame their behavior on the Primers was to miss the point entirely.Greatly reassured, she took out her silver pen and began to write a letter to her missing husband, who had never seemed so far away.Miranda receives an unusual ractive message;  a drive through the streets of Shanghai;  the Cathay Hotel;  a sophisticated soire;  Carl Hollywood introduces her to two unusual characters.It was a few minutes before midnight, and Miranda was about to sign off from the evening shift and clear out of her body stage.This was a Friday night.Nell had apparently decided not to pull an all nighter this time.On school nights, Nell reliably went to bed between ten thirty and eleven, but Friday was her night to immerse herself in the Primer the way she had as a small child, six or seven years ago, when all of this had started.Right now, Nell was stuck in a part of the story that must have been frustrating for her, namely, trying to puzzle out the social rituals of a rather bizarre cult of faeries that had thrown her into an underground labyrinth.She'd figure it out eventually she always did but not tonight.Miranda stayed onstage for an extra hour and a half, playing a role in a samurai ractive fairly popular in Japan, in which she was a platinum blond missionary's daughter abducted from Nagasaki by ronin.All she had to do was squeal a lot and eventually be rescued by a good samurai.It was a pity she didn't speak Nipponese and (beyond that) wasn't familiar with the theatrical style of that nation, because supposedly they were doing some radical and interesting things with karamaku"empty screen" or "empty act. "Eight years ago, she would have taken the onehour airship ride to Nippon and learned the language.Four years ago, she at least would have been disgusted with herself for playing this stupid role.But tonight she spoke her lines on cue, squealed and wriggled at the right times, and took her money, along with a hefty tip and the inevitable mash note from the payer a middle management type in Osaka who wanted to get to know her better.Of course, the same technology that made it impossible for Miranda to find Nell, made it impossible for this creep to find Miranda.An urgent job offer flashed over her screen just as she was putting her stuff together.She checked the ENQUIRY screen; the job didn't pay that much, but it was of very short duration.So she accepted it.She wondered who was sending her urgent job offers; six years ago it had happened frequently, but since she'd gone into her habit of working the evening shift she had, in general, become just another interchangeable Western bimbo with an unpronounceable name.It looked like some kind of weird bohemian art piece, some ractors' workshop project from her distant past: a surreal landscape of abstract colored geometric forms with faces occasionally rising out of flat surfaces to speak lines.The faces were texture mapped, as if wearing elaborately painted makeup, or were sculpted to the texture of orange peels, alligator hide, or durian fruit."We miss her," said one of the faces, the voice a little familiar, but disped into a weird ghostly echoing moan."Where is she?"said another face, rather familiar in its shape."Why has she abandoned us?"said a third face, and even through the texture mapping and the voice disping, Miranda recognized Carl Hollywood."If only she would come to our party!"cried another one, whom Miranda recognized as a member of the Parnasse Company named Christine something or other.The prompter gave her a line: Sorry, guys, but I'm working lateagain tonight."Okay, okay," Miranda said, "I'm going to ad lib.
