Guns, said Denz Ay, so quietly Lieutenant Awn almost didnt hear.A dozen, from before.From before the annexation, she meant.All the Shisurnan militaries had been relieved of their weapons, no one on the planet should have had any guns we didnt already know about.The answer was so surprising that for a blinking two seconds Lieutenant Awn didnt react at all.Then came puzzlement, alarm, and confusion.Why is she telling me this?Lieutenant Awn asked me silently.Theres been some talk, Lieutenant, said Denz Ay.Perhaps youve heard it.Theres always talk, acknowledged Lieutenant Awn, the answer so formulaic I didnt need to translate it for her, she could say it in the local dialect.How else are people to pass the time?Denz Ay conceded this conventional point with a gesture.Lieutenant Awns patience frayed, and she attacked directly.They might have been put there before the annexation.Denz Ay made a negative motion with her left hand.They werent there a month ago.Did someone find a pre annexation cache, and hide them there?Lieutenant Awn asked me, silently.Aloud she asked, When people talk, do they say things that might account for the appearance of a dozen guns underwater in a prohibited zone?Such guns are no good against you.Because of our armor, Denz Ay meant.Radchaai armor is an essentially impenetrable force shield.I could extend mine at a thought, the moment I desired to do so.The mechanism that generated it was implanted in each of my segments, and Lieutenant Awn had it as wellthough hers was an externally worn unit.It didnt make us completely invulnerable, and in combat we sometimes wore actual pieces of armor under it, lightweight and articulated, covering head and limbs and torso, but even without that a handful of guns wouldnt do much damage to either of us.So who would those guns be meant for?asked Lieutenant Awn.Denz Ay considered, frowning, biting her lip, and then said, The Tanmind are more like the Radchaai than we are.Citizen, said Lieutenant Awn, laying noticeable, deliberate stress on that word, which was only what Radchaai meant in the first place, if we were going to shoot anyone here, wed already have done it.Had already done it, in fact.We wouldnt need secret stashes of weapons.This is why I came to you, said Denz Ay, emphatic, as though explaining something in very simple terms, for a child.When you shoot a person, you say why and do it, without excuse.This is how the Radchaai are.But in the upper city, before you came, when they would shoot Orsians, they would always be careful to have an excuse.They wanted someone dead, she explained, to Lieutenant Awns uncomprehending, appalled expression, they did not say, You are trouble we want you gone and then shoot.They said, We are only defending ourselves and when the person was dead they would search the body or a house and discover weapons, or incriminating messages.Not, the implication was clear, genuine ones.Then how are we alike?Your gods are the same.They werent, not explicitly so, but the fiction was encouraged, in the upper city and elsewhere.You live in space, you go all wrapped up in clothes.You are rich, the Tanmind are rich.If someone in the upper cityand by this I suspected she meant a specific someonecries out that some Orsian threatens them, most Radchaai will believe her, and not some Orsian who is surely lying to protect her own.And that was why she had come to Lieutenant Awnso that, whatever happened, it would be plain and clear to Radchaai authorities that sheand by extension anyone else in the lower cityhad in fact had nothing to do with that cache of weapons, if the accusation should materialize.These things, said Lieutenant Awn.Orsian, Tanmind, Moha, they mean nothing now.Thats done.Everyone here is Radchaai.As you say, Lieutenant, answered Denz Ay, voice quiet and nearly expressionless.Lieutenant Awn had been in Ors long enough to recognize the unstated refusal to agree.She tried another angle.No one is going to shoot anybody.Of course not, Lieutenant, said Denz Ay, but in that same quiet voice.She was old enough to know firsthand that we had, indeed, shot people in the past.She could hardly be blamed for fearing we might do so in the future.After Denz Ay left, Lieutenant Awn sat thinking.No one interrupted; the day was quiet.In the green lit temple interior, the head priest turned to me and said, Once there would have been two choirs, a hundred voices each.You would have liked it.I had seen recordings.Sometimes the children would bring me songs that were distant echoes of that music, five hundred years gone and more.Were not what we used to be, said the head priest.Everything passes, eventually.I agreed that it was so.Take a boat tonight, said Lieutenant Awn, stirring at last.See if theres anything to indicate where the weapons came from.Ill decide what to do once I have a better idea of whats going on.Yes, Lieutenant, I said.Jen Shinnan lived in the upper city, across the Fore Temple lake.Few Orsians lived there who werent servants.The houses there were built to a slightly different plan from those in the lower; hip roofed, the central part of each floor walled in, though windows and doors were left open on mild nights.All of the upper city had been built over older ruins, and thus much more recently than the lower, within the last fifty or so years, and made much larger use of climate control.Many residents wore trousers and shirts, and even jackets.Radchaai immigrants who lived here tended to wear much more conventional clothes, and Lieutenant Awn, when she visited, wore her uniform without too much discomfort.But Lieutenant Awn was never comfortable, visiting Jen Shinnan.She didnt like Jen Shinnan, and though of course it was never even hinted at, very likely Jen Shinnan didnt like Lieutenant Awn much either.This sort of invitation was only extended out of social necessity, Lieutenant Awn being a local representative of Radchaai authority.The table this evening was unusually small, just Jen Shinnan, a cousin of hers, and Lieutenant Awn and Lieutenant Skaaiat.Lieutenant Skaaiat commanded Justice of Ente Seven Issa, and administered the territory between Ors and Kould Vesfarmland, mostly, where Jen Shinnan and her cousin had their holdings.Lieutenant Skaaiat and her troops assisted us during pilgrimage season, so she was nearly as well known in Ors as Lieutenant Awn was.They confiscated my entire harvest.This was the cousin of Jen Shinnans, the owner of several tamarind orchards not far from the upper city.She tapped her plate emphatically with her utensil.The entire harvest.The center of the table was laden with trays and bowls filled with eggs, fish (not from the marshy lake, but from the sea beyond), spiced chicken, bread, braised vegetables, and half a dozen relishes of various types.Didnt they pay you, citizen?asked Lieutenant Awn, speaking slowly and carefully, as she always did when she was anxious her accent might slip.Jen Shinnan and her cousin both spoke Radchaai, so there was no need to translate, nor any anxiety over gender or status or anything else that would have been essential in Tanmind or Orsian.Well, but I would certainly have gotten more if I could have taken it to Kould Ves and sold it myself!There had been a time when a property owner like her would have been shot early on, so someones client could take over her plantation.Indeed, not a few Shisurnans had died in the initial stages of the annexation simply because they were in the way, and in the way could mean any number of things.As Im sure you understand, citizen, said Lieutenant Awn, food distribution is a problem were still solving, and we all need to endure some hardship while thats accomplished.Her sentences, when she was uncomfortable, became uncharacteristically formal, and sometimes dangerously convoluted.Jen Shinnan gestured to a laden plate of fragile pale pink glass.Another stuffed egg, Lieutenant Awn?Lieutenant Awn held up one gloved hand.Theyre delicious, but no thank you, citizen.But the cousin had landed in a track she found it hard to deviate from, despite Jen Shinnans diplomatic attempt to derail her.Its not like fruit is a necessity.Tamarind, of all things!And its not like anyone is starving.Indeed it isnt!agreed Lieutenant Skaaiat, heartily.She smiled brightly at Lieutenant Awn.Lieutenant Skaaiatdark skinned, amber eyed, aristocratic as Lieutenant Awn was not.One of her Seven Issas stood near me, by the door of the dining room, as straight and still as I was.Though Lieutenant Awn liked Lieutenant Skaaiat a good deal, and appreciated her sarcasm on this occasion, she could not bring herself to smile in response.Not this year.Your business is doing better than mine, Cousin, said Jen Shinnan, voice placating.She too owned farmland not far from the upper city.But she had also owned those dredgers that sat, silent and still, in the marsh water.Though I suppose I cant be too regretful, it was a great deal of trouble for very little return.Lieutenant Awn opened her mouth to speak, and then closed it again.Lieutenant Skaaiat saw it, and said, vowels effortlessly broad and refined, What is it, another three years for the fishing prohibitions, Lieutenant?Yes, said Lieutenant Awn.Foolishness, said Jen Shinnan.Well intentioned, but foolishness.You saw what it was like when you arrived.As soon as you open them, theyll be fished out again.The Orsians may have been a great people once, but theyre no longer what their ancestors were.They have no ambition, no sense of anything beyond their short term advantage.If you show them whos boss, then they can be quite obedient, as Im sure youve discovered, Lieutenant Awn, but in their natural state they are, with few exceptions, shiftless and superstitious.Though I suppose thats what comes of living in the Underworld.She smiled at her own joke.Her cousin laughed outright.The space dwelling nations of Shisurna divided the universe into three parts.In the middle lay the natural environment of humansspace stations, ships, constructed habitats.Outside those was the Blackheaven, the home of God and everything holy.And within the gravity well of the planet Shisurna itselfor for that matter any planetlay the Underworld, the land of the dead from which humanity had had to escape in order to become fully free of its demonic influence.You can see, perhaps, how the Radchaai conception of the universe as being God itself might seem the same as the Tanmind idea of the Black.You might also see why it seemed a bit odd, to Radchaai ears, to hear someone who believed gravity wells were the land of the dead call people superstitious for worshiping a lizard.Lieutenant Awn managed a polite smile, and Lieutenant Skaaiat said, And yet you live here too.I dont confuse abstract philosophical concepts with reality, said Jen Shinnan.Though that too sounded odd, to a Radchaai who knew what it meant for a Tanmind stationer to descend to the Underworld and return.Seriously.I have a theory.Lieutenant Awn, who had been exposed to several Tanmind theories about the Orsians, managed a neutral, even almost curious expression and said, blandly, Oh?Do share!encouraged Lieutenant Skaaiat.The cousin, having scooped a quantity of spiced chicken into her mouth moments before, made a gesture of support with her utensil.Its the way they live, all out in the open like that, with nothing but a roof, Jen Shinnan said.They cant have any privacy, no sense of themselves as real individuals, you understand, no sense of any sort of separate identity.Let alone private property, said Jen Taa, having swallowed her chicken.They think they can just walk in and take whatever they want.Actually, there were rulesif unstated onesabout entering a house uninvited, and theft was rarely a problem in the lower city.Occasionally during pilgrimage season, almost never otherwise.Jen Shinnan gestured acknowledgment.And no one here is ever really starving, Lieutenant.No one has to work, they just fish in the swamp.Or fleece visitors during pilgrimage season.They have no chance to develop any ambition, or any desire to improve themselves.And they dontcant, reallydevelop any sort of sophistication, any kind of She trailed off, searching for the right word.Interiority?suggested Lieutenant Skaaiat, who enjoyed this game much more than Lieutenant Awn did.Thats it exactly!agreed Jen Shinnan.Interiority, yes.So your theory is, said Lieutenant Awn, her tone dangerously even, that the Orsians arent really people.Well, not individuals.Jen Shinnan seemed to sense, remotely, that shed said something to make Lieutenant Awn angry, but didnt seem entirely certain of it.Not as such.And of course, interjected Jen Taa, oblivious, they see what we have, and dont understand that you have to work for that sort of life, and theyre envious and resentful and blame us for not letting them have it, when if theyd only work  They send what money they have to support that half broken down temple, and then complain theyre poor, said Jen Shinnan.And they fish out the marsh and then blame us.Theyll do the same to you, Lieutenant, when you open the prohibited zones again.Your dredging up the mud by the ton to sell as fertilizer didnt have anything to do with the fish disappearing?asked Lieutenant Awn, her voice edged.Actually, the fertilizer had been a by product of the main business of selling the mud to space dwelling Tanmind for religious purposes.That was due to irresponsible fishing on the part of the Orsians?Well of course it had some effect, said Jen Taa, but if theyd only managed their resources properly  Quite right, agreed Jen Shinnan.You blame me for ruining the fishing.But I gave those people jobs.Opportunities to improve their lives.Lieutenant Skaaiat must have sensed that Lieutenant Awn was at a dangerous point.Security on a planet is very different from on a station, she said, her voice cheerful.On a planet theres always going to be some some slippage.Some things you dont see.Ah, said Jen Shinnan, but youve got everyone tagged so you always know where we are.Yes, agreed Lieutenant Skaaiat.But were not always watching.I suppose you could grow an AI big enough to watch a whole planet, but I dont think anyone has ever tried it.A station, though  I watched Lieutenant Awn see Lieutenant Skaaiat spring the trap Jen Shinnan had walked into moments ago.On a station, Lieutenant Awn said, the AI sees everything.So much easier to manage, agreed Lieutenant Skaaiat happily.Almost no need for security at all.That wasnt quite true, but this was no time to point that out.Jen Taa set down her utensil.Surely the AI doesnt see everything.Neither lieutenant said anything.Even when you?Everything, answered Lieutenant Awn.I assure you, citizen.Silence, for nearly two seconds.Beside me, Lieutenant Skaaiats Seven Issa guards mouth twitched, something that might have been an itch or some unavoidable muscle spasm, but was, I suspected, the only outward manifestation of her amusement.Military ships possessed AIs just as stations did, and Radchaai soldiers lived utterly without privacy.Lieutenant Skaaiat broke the silence.Your niece, citizen, is taking the aptitudes this year?The cousin gestured yes.So long as her own farming provided income, she wouldnt need an assignment, and neither would her heirhowever many heirs the land might support.The niece, however, had lost her parents during the annexation.These aptitudes, said Jen Shinnan.You took them, Lieutenants?Both indicated affirmatively.The aptitudes were the only way into the military, or any government postthough that didnt encompass all assignments available.No doubt, said Jen Shinnan, the test works well for you, but I wonder if its suited to us Shisurnans.Why is that?asked Lieutenant Skaaiat, with slightly frowning amusement.Has there been a problem?asked Lieutenant Awn, still stiff, still annoyed with Jen Shinnan.Well.Jen Shinnan picked up a napkin, soft and bleached a snowy white, and wiped her mouth.Word is, last month in Kould Ves all the candidates for civil service were ethnic Orsians.Lieutenant Awn blinked in confusion.Lieutenant Skaaiat smiled.You mean to say, she said, looking at Jen Shinnan but also directing her words to Lieutenant Awn, that you think the testing is biased.Jen Shinnan folded her napkin and set it down on the table beside her bowl.Come now, Lieutenant.Let us be honest.Theres a reason so few Orsians occupied such posts before you arrived.Every now and then you find an exceptionthe Divine is a very respectable person, I grant you.But shes an exception.So when I see twenty Orsians destined for civil service posts, and not a single Tanmind, I cant help but think either the test is flawed, or well.I cant help but remember that it was the Orsians who first surrendered, when you arrived.I cant blame you for appreciating that, for wanting to acknowledge that.But its a mistake.Lieutenant Awn said nothing.Lieutenant Skaaiat asked, Assuming youre correct, why would that be a mistake?Its as I said before.They just arent suited to positions of authority.Some exceptions, yes, but She waved a gloved hand.And with the bias of the assignments being so obvious, people wont have confidence in it.Lieutenant Skaaiats smile grew broader in proportion to Lieutenant Awns silent, indignant anger.Your niece is nervous?A bit!admitted the cousin.Understandably, drawled Lieutenant Skaaiat.Its a momentous event in any citizens life.But she neednt fear.Jen Shinnan laughed, sardonic.Neednt fear?The lower city resents us, always has, and now we cant make any legal contracts without either taking transport to Kould Ves or going through the lower city to your house, Lieutenant.Any legally binding contract had to be made in the temple of Amaat.Or, a recent (and extremely controversial) concession, on its steps, if one of the parties was an exclusive monotheist.During that pilgrimage thing its nearly impossible.We either lose an entire day traveling to Kould Ves, or endanger ourselves.Jen Shinnan visited Kould Ves quite frequently, often merely to visit friends, or shop.All the Tanmind in the upper city did, and had done so before the annexation.Has there been some unreported difficulty?asked Lieutenant Awn, stiff, angry.Utterly polite.Well, said Jen Taa.In fact, Lieutenant, Ive been wanting to mention.Weve been here a few days, and my niece seems to have had a bit of trouble in the lower city.I told her it was better not to go, but you know how teenagers are when you tell them not to do something.What sort of trouble?asked Lieutenant Awn.Oh, said Jen Shinnan, you know the sort of thing.Rude words, threatsempty, no doubt, and of course nothing next to what things will be like in a week or two, but the child was quite shaken.The child in question had spent the past two afternoons staring at the Fore Temple water and sighing.I had spoken to her once and she had turned her head away without answering.After that I had left her alone.No one had troubled her.No problems that I saw, I messaged Lieutenant Awn.Ill keep an eye on her, said Lieutenant Awn, silently acknowledging my information with a twitch of her fingers.Thank you, Lieutenant, said Jen Shinnan.I know we can count on you.You think its funny.Lieutenant Awn tried to relax her too tight jaw.I could tell from the increasing tension of her facial muscles that without intervention she would soon have a headache.Lieutenant Skaaiat, walking beside her, laughed outright.Its pure comedy.Forgive me, my dear, but the angrier you get the more painstakingly correct your speech becomes, and the more Jen Shinnan mistakes you.Surely not.Surely shes asked about me.Youre still angry.Worse, said Lieutenant Skaaiat, hooking her arm around Lieutenant Awns, youre angry with me.Im sorry.And she has asked.Very obliquely, just interested in you, only natural, of course.And you answered, suggested Lieutenant Awn, equally obliquely.I walked behind them, alongside the Seven Issa who had stood with me in Jen Shinnans dining room.Directly ahead, along the street and across the Fore Temple water, I could see myself where I stood in the plaza.Lieutenant Skaaiat said, I said nothing untrue.I told her that lieutenants on ships with ancillaries tended to be from old, high ranking families with lots of money and clients.Her connections in Kould Ves might have said a bit more, but not much.On the one hand, since you arent such a person, they have cause to resent you.On the other hand, you do command ancillaries and not vulgar human troops, which the old fashioned deplore just as much as they deplore the scions of obscure, nobody houses getting assigned as officers.They approve of your ancillaries and disapprove of your antecedents.Jen Shinnan gets a very ambivalent picture of you.Her voice was quiet, pitched so that only someone standing very near could hear it, though the houses we passed were closed up, and dark on the lower levels.It was very unlike the lower city, where even late into the night people sat nearly in the street, even small children.Besides, Lieutenant Skaaiat said, shes right.Oh, not that foolishness about Orsians, no, but shes right to be suspicious about the aptitudes.You know yourself the tests are susceptible to manipulation.Lieutenant Awn felt a sick, betrayed indignation at Lieutenant Skaaiats words, but said nothing, and Lieutenant Skaaiat continued.For centuries only the wealthy and well connected tested as suitable for certain jobs.Like, say, officers in the military.In the last, what, fifty, seventy five years, that hasnt been true.Have the lesser houses suddenly begun to produce officer candidates where they didnt before?I dont like where youre headed with this, snapped Lieutenant Awn, tugging slightly at their linked arms, trying to pull away.I didnt expect it from you.No, no, protested Lieutenant Skaaiat, and didnt let go, drew her closer.The question is the right one, and the answer the same.The answer is no, of course.But does that mean the tests were rigged before, or rigged now?And your opinion?Both.Before and now.And our friend Jen Shinnan doesnt fully understand that the question can even be askedshe just knows that if youre going to succeed youve got to have the right connections, and she knows the aptitudes are part of that.And shes utterly shamelessyou heard her imply the Orsians were being rewarded for collaboration, and in nearly the same breath imply her people would be even better collaborators!And you notice neither she nor her cousin are sending their own children for testing, just this orphaned niece.Still, theyre invested in her doing well.If wed asked for a bribe to ensure it, shed have handed it over, no question.Im surprised she didnt offer one, actually.You wouldnt, protested Lieutenant Awn.You wont.You cant deliver anyway.I wont need to.The child will test well, likely get herself sent to the territorial capital for training to take a nice civil service post.If you ask me, the Orsians are being rewarded for collaboratingbut theyre a minority in this system.And now the unavoidable unpleasantness of the annexation is over, we want people to start realizing that being Radchaai will benefit them.Punishing local houses for not being quick enough to surrender wont help.They walked in silence for a bit, and stopped at the edge of the water, arms still linked.Walk you home?asked Lieutenant Skaaiat.Lieutenant Awn didnt answer, but looked away over the water, still angry.The green skylights in the temples slanted roof shone, and light poured out the open doors onto the plaza and reflected on the waterthis was a season of nightly vigils.Lieutenant Skaaiat said, with an apologetic half smile, Ive upset you, let me make it up to you.Sure, said Lieutenant Awn, with a small sigh.She never could resist Lieutenant Skaaiat, and indeed there was no real reason to do so.They turned and walked along the waters edge.Whats the difference, Lieutenant Awn said, so quietly it didnt seem like a break in the silence, between citizens and noncitizens?One is civilized, said Lieutenant Skaaiat with a laugh, and the other isnt.The joke only made sense in Radchaaicitizen and civilized are the same word.To be Radchaai is to be civilized.So in the moment the Lord of Mianaai bestowed citizenship on the Shisurnans, in that very instant they became civilized.The sentence was a circular onethe question Lieutenant Awn was asking is a difficult one in that language.I mean, one day your Issas are shooting people for failing to speak respectfully enoughdont tell me it didnt happen, because I know it did, and worseand it doesnt matter because theyre not Radchaai, not civilized.Lieutenant Awn had switched momentarily into the bit of the local Orsian language she knew, because the Radchaai words refused to let her mean what she wished to say.And any measures are justified in the name of civilization.Well, said Lieutenant Skaaiat, it was effective, you have to admit.Everyone speaks very respectfully to us these days.Lieutenant Awn was silent.Unamused.What brought this on?Lieutenant Awn told her about her conversation with the head priest the day before.Ah.Well.You didnt protest at the time.What good would it have done?Absolutely none, answered Lieutenant Skaaiat.But thats not why you didnt.Besides, even if ancillaries dont beat people, or take bribes, or rape, or shoot people out of piquethose people human troops shot a hundred years ago theyd have been stored in suspension for future use as ancillary segments.Do you know how many we still have stockpiled?Justice of Torens holds will be full of ancillaries for the next million years.If not longer.Those people are effectively dead.So whats the difference?And you dont like my saying that, but heres the truth: luxury always comes at someone elses expense.One of the many advantages of civilization is that one doesnt generally have to see that, if one doesnt wish.Youre free to enjoy its benefits without troubling your conscience.It doesnt trouble yours?Lieutenant Skaaiat laughed, gaily, as though they were discussing something completely different, a game of counters or a good tea shop.When you grow up knowing that you deserve to be on top, that the lesser houses exist to serve your houses glorious destiny, you take such things for granted.Youre born assuming that someone else is paying the cost of your life.Its just the way things are.What happens during annexationits a difference of degree, not a difference of kind.It doesnt seem that way to me, answered Lieutenant Awn, short and bitter.No, of course it doesnt, answered Lieutenant Skaaiat, her voice kinder.Im quite sure she genuinely liked Lieutenant Awn.I know that Lieutenant Awn liked her, even if Lieutenant Skaaiat sometimes said things that upset her, like this evening.Your family has been paying some of that cost, however small.Maybe that makes it easier to sympathize with whoever might be paying for you.And Im sure its hard not to think of what your own ancestors went through when they were annexed.Your ancestors were never annexed.Lieutenant Awns voice was biting.Well, some of them probably were, admitted Lieutenant Skaaiat.But theyre not in the official genealogy.She stopped, pulling Lieutenant Awn to a halt beside her.Awn, my good friend.Dont trouble yourself over things you cant help.Things are as they are.You have nothing to reproach yourself with.Youve just said we all do.That wasnt what I said.Lieutenant Skaaiats voice was gentle.But youll take it that way all the same, wont you?Listenlife will be better here, because were here.It already is, not just for the people here but for those who were transported.And even for Jen Shinnan, even though just now shes preoccupied with her own resentment at no longer being the highest authority in Ors.Shell come around in time.They all will.And the dead?Are dead.No use fretting over them.5   When Seivarden woke, she was fidgety and irritable.She asked me twice who I was, and complained three times that my answerwhich was a lie in any eventconveyed no meaningful information to her.I dont know anyone named Breq.Ive never seen you before in my life.Where am I?Nowhere with a name.Youre on Nilt.She drew a blanket around her bare shoulders, and then, sulkily, shoved it off again and folded her arms across her chest.Ive never even heard of Nilt.How did I end up here?I have no idea.I set the food I was holding down on the floor in front of her.She reached for the blanket again.I dont want that.I gestured my indifference.I had eaten and rested while she slept.Does this happen to you often?What?Waking up and finding you dont know where you are, who youre with, or how you got there?She fidgeted the blanket on and off again, and rubbed her arms and wrists together.A couple of times.Im Breq, from the Gerentate.I had already told her, but I knew she would ask me again.I found you two days ago in front of a tavern.I dont know how you got there.You would have died if Id left you.Im sorry if thats what you wanted.For some reason that angered her.How very charming you are, Breq from the Gerentate.She sneered slightly as she said it.It was mildly, irrationally surprising to hear that tone from her, naked and disheveled as she was, and not in uniform.That tone made me angry.I knew very precisely why I was angry, and knew as well that if I dared to explain my anger to Seivarden she would respond with nothing but contempt, and that made me even angrier.I held my face in the neutral, slightly interested expression I had used with her from the moment shed awakened, and made the same indifferent gesture I had made moments before.I had been the first ship Seivarden ever served on.Shed arrived fresh out of training, seventeen years old, plunged straight into the tail end of an annexation.In a tunnel carved through red brown stone under the surface of a small moon she had been ordered to guard a line of prisoners, nineteen of them, crouched naked and shivering along the chill passageway, waiting to be evaluated.Actually I was doing the guarding, seven of me ranged along the corridor, weapons ready.Seivardenso young then, still slight, dark hair, brown skin, and brown eyes unremarkable, unlike the aristocratic lines of her face, including a nose she hadnt quite grown into yet.Nervous, yes, left in charge here just days after arriving, but also proud of herself and her sudden, small authority.Proud of that dark brown uniform jacket, trousers, and gloves, that lieutenants insignia.And, I thought, a tiny bit too excited at holding an actual gun in what certainly wasnt a training exercise.One of the people along the wallbroad shouldered, muscled, cradling a broken arm against her torsowept noisily, moaning each exhale, gasping every inhale.She knew, everyone in this line knew, that they would either be stored for future use as ancillarieslike the ancillaries of mine that stood before them even now, identities gone, bodies appendages to a Radchaai warshipor else they would be disposed of.Seivarden, pacing importantly up and down the line, grew more irritated with this piteous captives every convulsive breath, until finally she halted in front of her.Aatrs tits!Stop that noise!Small movements of Seivardens arm muscles told me she was about to raise her weapon.No one would have cared if shed taken the butt of her gun and beaten the prisoner senseless.No one would have cared if shed shot the prisoner in the head, so long as no vital equipment was damaged in the process.Human bodies to make into ancillaries werent exactly a scarce resource.I stepped in front of her.Lieutenant, I said, flat and toneless.The tea you asked for is ready.Actually it had been ready five minutes before but Id said nothing, held it in reserve.In the readings coming from that terribly young Lieutenant Seivarden I saw startlement, frustration, anger.Irritation.That was fifteen minutes ago, she snapped.I didnt answer.Behind me the prisoner still sobbed and moaned.Cant you shut her up?Ill do my best, Lieutenant, I said, though I knew there was only one way to really do that, only one thing that would silence that captives grief.The newly minted Lieutenant Seivarden seemed unaware of that.Twenty one years after arriving on Justice of Torenjust over a thousand years before I found her in the snowSeivarden was senior Esk lieutenant.Thirty eight, still quite young by Radchaai standards.A citizen could live some two hundred years.Her last day, she sat drinking tea on her bunk in her quarters, three meters by two meters by two, white walled, severely neat.She was grown into that aristocratic nose by now, grown into herself.No longer awkward or unsure.Beside her on the tightly made up bunk sat the Esk decades most junior lieutenant, arrived just weeks ago, a sort of cousin of Seivardens, though from another house.Taller than Seivarden had been at that age, broader, a bit more graceful.Mostly.Nervous at being asked to confer in private here with the senior lieutenant, cousin or no, but concealing it.Seivarden said to her, You want to be careful, Lieutenant, who you favor with your attentions.The very young lieutenant frowned, embarrassed, realizing suddenly what this was about.You know who I mean, continued Seivarden, and I knew too.One of the other Esk lieutenants had definitely noticed when the very young lieutenant had come on board, had been slowly, discreetly sounding out the possibility of the very young lieutenant perhaps noticing her back.But not so discreetly that Seivarden hadnt seen it.In fact, the entire decade room had seen it, and seen, as well, the very young lieutenants intrigued response.I know who you mean, said the very young lieutenant.Indignant.But I dont see why  Ah!said Seivarden, sharp and peremptory.You think its harmless fun.Well, it would probably be fun.Seivarden had slept with the lieutenant in question herself at one point and knew whereof she spoke.But it wouldnt be harmless.Shes a good enough officer, but her house is very provincial.If she werent senior to you, there would be no problem.The very young lieutenants house was definitely not very provincial.Naive as she was, she knew immediately what Seivarden meant.And was angry enough at it to address Seivarden in a way that was less formal than propriety demanded.Aatrs tits, Cousin, no ones said anything about clientage.No one could, none of us can make contracts until we retire.Among the wealthy, clientage was a very hierarchical relationshipa patron promised certain sorts of assistance to her client, both financial and social, and a client provided support and services to her patron.These were promises that could last generations.In the oldest, most prestigious houses the servants were nearly all the descendants of clients, for instance, and many businesses owned by wealthy houses were staffed by client branches of lower ones.These provincial houses are ambitious, Seivarden explained, voice the slightest bit condescending.And clever as well or they wouldnt have gotten as far as they have.Shes senior to you, and youve both got years to serve yet.Grant her intimacy on those terms, let it continue, and depend on it, one of these days shell be offering you clientage when it ought to be the other way around.I dont think your mother would thank you for exposing your house to that sort of insult.The very young lieutenants face heated with anger and chagrin, the shine of her first adult romance suddenly gone, the whole thing turned sordid and calculating.Seivarden leaned forward, reached out for the tea flask and stopped, with a surge of irritation.Said silently to me, the fingers of her free hand twitching, This cuff has been torn for three days.I said, directly into her ear, Im sorry, Lieutenant.I ought to have offered to make the repair immediately, dispatched a segment of One Esk to take the offending shirt away.I ought, in fact, to have mended it three days before.Ought not to have dressed her in that shirt that day.Silence in the cramped compartment, the very young lieutenant still preoccupied with her discomfiture.Then I said, directly into Seivardens ear, Lieutenant, the decade commander will see you at your earliest convenience.I had known the promotion was coming.Had taken a petty satisfaction in the fact that even if she ordered me that moment to mend her sleeve, I would have no time to do it.As soon as she left her quarters I started packing her things, and three hours later she was on her way to her new command, freshly made captain of Sword of Nathtas.I hadnt been particularly sorry to see her go.Such small things.It wasnt Seivardens fault if she had reacted badly in a situation that few (if any) seventeen year olds could have handled with aplomb.It was hardly surprising that she was precisely as snobby as she had been brought up to be.Not her fault that over my (at the time) thousand years of existence I had come to have a higher opinion of ability than of breeding, and had seen more than one very provincial house rise far enough to lose that label, and turn out its own versions of Seivarden.All the years between young Lieutenant Seivarden and Captain Seivarden, they were made up of tiny moments.Minor things.I never hated Seivarden.I had just never particularly liked her.But I couldnt see her, now, without thinking of someone else.The next week at Strigans house was unpleasant.Seivarden needed constant looking after, and frequent cleaning up.She ate very little (which in some respects was fortunate), and I had to work to make sure she didnt get dehydrated.But by the end of the week she was keeping her food down, and sleeping at least intermittently.Even so she slept lightly, twitching and turning, often trembling, breathing hard, and waking suddenly.When she was awake, and not weeping, she complained that everything was too harsh, too rough, too loud, too bright.Another few days after that, when she thought I was asleep, she went to the outer door and stared out over the snow, and then put on her clothes and a coat and trudged to the outbuilding, and then the flier.She tried to start it, but I had removed an essential part and kept it close.When she returned to the house she had at least the presence of mind to close both doors before she tracked snow into the main room, where I sat on a bench holding Strigans stringed instrument.She stared, unable to conceal her surprise, still shrugging slightly, uncomfortable in the heavy coat, itchy.I want to leave, she said, in a voice oddly half cowed and half arrogant, commanding Radchaai.Well leave when Im ready, I said, and fingered a few notes on the instrument.Her feelings were too raw for her to be able to conceal them just now, and her anger and despair showed plainly on her face.You are where you are, I said, in an even tone, as a result of decisions you made yourself.Her spine straightened, her shoulders went back.You dont know anything about me, or what decisions I have or havent made.It was enough to make me angry again.I knew something about making decisions, and not making them.Ah, I forget.Everything happens as Amaat wills, nothing is your fault.Her eyes went wide.She opened her mouth to speak, drew breath, but then blew it out, sharp and shaky.She turned her back, ostensibly to remove her outer coat and drop it on a nearby bench.You dont understand, she said, contemptuous, but her voice trembled with suppressed tears.Youre not Radchaai.Not civilized.Did you start taking kef before or after you left the Radch?It shouldnt have been available in Radchaai territory, but there was always some minor smuggling station authorities might turn a blind eye toward.She slumped down onto the bench beside where shed sloppily left her coat.I want tea.Theres no tea here.I set the instrument aside.Theres milk.More specifically, there was fermented bov milk, which the people here thinned with water and drank warm.The smelland tastewas reminiscent of sweaty boots.And too much of it would likely make Seivarden slightly sick.What sort of place doesnt have tea?she demanded, but leaned forward, elbows on her knees, and put her forehead on her wrists, her bare hands palm up, fingers outstretched.This sort of place, I answered.Why were you taking kef?You wouldnt understand.Tears dropped into her lap.Try me.I picked up the instrument again, picked out a tune.After six seconds of silent weeping, Seivarden said, She said it would make everything clearer.The kef would?No answer.What would be clearer?I know that song, she said, her face still resting on her wrists.I realized it was very likely the only way she would recognize me, and changed to a different tune.In one region of Valskaay, singing was a refined pastime, local choral associations the center of social activity.That annexation had brought me a great deal of the sort of music I had liked best, when I had had more than one voice.I chose one of those.Seivarden wouldnt know it.Valskaay had been both before and after her time.She said, Seivarden said finally, lifting her face from her hands, that emotions clouded perception.That the clearest sight was pure reason, undistorted by feeling.Thats not true.Id had a week with this instrument and very little else to do.I managed two lines at once.It seemed true at first.It was wonderful at first.It all went away.But then it would wear off, and things would be the same.Only worse.And then after a while it was like not feeling felt bad.I dont know.I cant describe it.But if I took more that went away.And coming down got less and less endurable.Id heard the story a few times, in the past twenty years.Oh, Amaats grace, she moaned.I want to die.Why dont you?I changed to another song.My heart is a fish, hiding in the water grass.In the green, in the green  She looked at me as though I were a rock that had just spoken.You lost your ship, I said.You were frozen for a thousand years.You wake up to find the Radch has changedno more invasions, a humiliating treaty with the Presger, your house has lost financial and social status.No one knows you or remembers you, or cares whether you live or die.Its not what you were used to, not what you were expecting out of your life, is it?It took three puzzled seconds for the fact to dawn.You know who I am.Of course I know who you are.You told me, I lied.She blinked, tearily, trying, I supposed, to remember if she had or not.But her memories were, of course, incomplete.Go to sleep, I said, and laid my fingers across the strings, silencing them.I want to leave, she protested, not moving, still slumped on the bench, elbows on her knees.Why cant I leave?I have business here, I told her.She curled her lip and scoffed.She was right, of course, waiting here was foolish.After so many years, so much planning and effort, I had failed.Still.Go back to bed.Bed was the pallet of cushions and blankets beside the bench, where she sat.She looked at me, half sneering still, and contemptuous, and slid down to the floor and lay, pulled a blanket over herself.She wouldnt sleep at first, I was sure.She would be trying to think of some way to leave, to overpower me or convince me to do what she wanted.Any such planning would be useless until she knew what she wanted, of course, but I didnt say that.Within the hour her muscles slackened and her breathing slowed.Had she still been my lieutenant I would have known for certain she slept, known what stage of sleep she was in, known whether or not she dreamed.Now I could only see externals.Still wary, I sat on the floor, leaning against another bench, and pulled a blanket up over my legs.As I had done every time Id slept here, I opened my inner coat and put my hand on my gun, leaned back, and closed my eyes.Two hours later a faint sound woke me.I lay unmoving, my hand still on my gun.The faint sound repeated itself, slightly louderthe second door closing.I opened my eyes, just the slightest bit.Seivarden lay too quiet on her palletsurely she had heard the sound as well.Through my eyelashes I saw a person in outdoor clothes.Just under two meters tall, thin under the bulk of the double coat, skin iron gray.When she pushed back her hood I saw her hair was the same.She was certainly not a Nilter.She stood, watching me and Seivarden, for seven seconds, and then quietly stepped to where I lay, and bent to pull my pack toward her with one hand.In the other she held a gun, pointed steadily at me, though she seemed not to know I was awake.The lock baffled her for a few moments, and then she pulled a tool out of her pocket, which she used to bypass the lock quite a bit more quickly than I had anticipated.Her gun still trained on me, and glancing occasionally at still motionless Seivarden, she emptied the pack.Spare clothes.Ammunition, but no gun, so she would know or suspect that I was armed.Three foil wrapped packets of concentrated rations.Eating utensils, and a bottle for water.A gold disk five centimeters in diameter, one and a half centimeters thick that she puzzled over, frowning, and then set aside.A box, which she opened to find moneyshe let out an astonished breath when she realized how much, and looked over at me.I didnt move.I dont know what she had thought she would find, but she seemed not to have found it, whatever it was.She picked up the disk that had puzzled her, and sat on a bench from which she had a clear view of both me and Seivarden.Turning the disk over, she found the trigger.The sides fell away, opening like a flower, and the mechanism disgorged the icon, a person nearly naked except for short trousers and tiny jewel and enamel flowers.The image smiled, serene.She had four arms.One hand held a ball, the other arm was encased in a cylindrical armguard.Her other hands held a knife and a severed head, which dripped jeweled blood at her bare feet.The head smiled the same smile of saintly utter calm as she did.Striganit had to be Striganfrowned.The icon had been unexpected.It had piqued her curiosity yet further.I opened my eyes.She tightened her grip on her gunthe gun I was now looking at as closely as I could, now my eyes were fully open, now I could turn my head toward it.Strigan held the icon out, raised a steel gray eyebrow.Relative?she asked, in Radchaai.I kept my face pleasantly neutral.Not exactly, I said, in her own language.I thought I knew what you were when you came, she said, after a long silence, thankfully following my language switch.I thought I knew what you were doing here.Now Im not so sure.She glanced at Seivarden, to all appearances completely undisturbed by our talking.I think I know who he is.But who are you?What are you?Dont tell me Breq from the Gerentate.Youre as Radchaai as that one.She gestured slightly toward Seivarden with her elbow.I came here to buy something, I said, determined to keep from staring at the gun she held.Hes incidental.Since we werent speaking Radchaai I had to take gender into accountStrigans language required it.The society she lived in professed at the same time to believe gender was insignificant.Males and females dressed, spoke, acted indistinguishably.And yet no one Id met had ever hesitated, or guessed wrong.And they had invariably been offended when I did hesitate or guess wrong.I hadnt learned the trick of it.Id been in Strigans own apartment, seen her belongings, and still wasnt sure what forms to use with her now.Incidental?asked Strigan, disbelieving.I couldnt blame her.I wouldnt have believed it myself, except I knew it to be true.Strigan said nothing else, likely realizing that to say much more would be extremely foolish, if I was what she feared I was.Coincidence, I said.Glad on at least one count that we werent speaking Radchaai, where the word implied significance.I found him unconscious.If Id left him where he was hed have died.Strigan didnt believe that either, from the look she gave me.Why are you here?She laughed, short and bitterwhether because Id chosen the wrong gender for the pronoun, or something else, I wasnt certain.I think thats my question to ask.She hadnt corrected my grammar, at least.I came to talk to you.To buy something.Seivarden was ill.You werent here.Ill pay you for what weve eaten, of course.She seemed to find that amusing, for some reason.Why are you here?she asked.Im alone, I said, answering her unspoken question.Except for him.I nodded at Seivarden.My hand was still on my gun, and Strigan likely knew why I kept that hand so still, under my coat.Seivarden still feigned sleep.Strigan shook her head slightly, disbelieving.Id have sworn you were a corpse soldier.An ancillary, she meant.When you arrived I was certain of it.Shed been hiding nearby, then, waiting for us to leave, and the entire place had been under her surveillance.She must have trusted her hiding place quite extravagantlyif I had been what she feared, staying anywhere near would have been extremely foolish.I would certainly have found her.But when you saw there was no one here you wept.And him She shrugged toward Seivarden, slack and motionless on the pallet.Sit up, citizen, I said to Seivarden, in Radchaai.Youre not fooling anyone.Fuck off, she answered, and pulled a blanket over her head.Then shoved it off again and rose, slightly shaky, and went into the sanitary facility and closed the door.I turned back to Strigan.That business with the flier rental.Was that you?She shrugged ruefully.He told me a couple of Radchaai were coming out this way.Either he badly underestimated you, or youre even more dangerous than I thought.Which would be considerably dangerous.Im used to being underestimated.And you didnt tell her him why you thought I was coming.Her gun hadnt wavered.Why are you here?You know why Im here.A quick change in her expression, instantly suppressed.I continued.Not to kill you.Killing you would defeat the purpose.She raised an eyebrow, tilted her head slightly.Would it.The fencing, the feinting, frustrated me.I want the gun.What gun?Strigan would never be so foolish as to admit the thing existed, that she knew what gun I was talking about.But her pretended ignorance didnt convince.She knew.If she had what I thought she had, what I had gambled my life she had, further specificity would be unnecessary.She knew.Whether she would give it to me was another question.Ill pay you for it.I dont know what youre talking about.The Garseddai did everything in fives.Five right actions, five principal sins, five zones times five regions.Twenty five representatives to surrender to the Lord of the Radch.For three seconds Strigan was utterly still.Even her breathing seemed to have stopped.Then she spoke.Garsedd, is it?What does that have to do with me?Id never have guessed if youd stayed where you were.Garsedd was a thousand years ago, and very, very far away from here.Twenty five representatives to surrender to the Lord of the Radch, I repeated.And twenty four guns recovered or otherwise accounted for.She blinked, drew in a breath.Who are you?Someone ran.Someone fled the system before the Radchaai arrived.Maybe she was afraid the guns wouldnt work as advertised.Maybe she knew that even if they did it wouldnt help.On the contrary, no?Wasnt that the point?No one defies Anaander Mianaai.She spoke bitterly.Not if they want to live.I said nothing.Strigans hold on the gun didnt waver.Even so, she was in danger from me, if I decided to harm her, and I thought she suspected that.I dont know why you think I have this gun youre talking about.Why would I have it?You collected antiques, curiosities.You already had a small collection of Garseddai artifacts.Theyd made their way to Dras Annia Station, somehow.Others might do so as well.And then one day you disappeared.You took care you wouldnt be followed.Thats a very slight basis for such a large assumption.So why this?I gestured carefully with my free hand, the other still under my coat, holding my gun.You had a comfortable post on Dras Annia, patients, plenty of money, associations and reputation.Now youre in the icy middle of nowhere, giving first aid to bov herders.Personal crisis, she said, the words carefully, deliberately pronounced.Certainly, I agreed.You couldnt bring yourself to destroy it, or pass it on to someone who might not be wise enough to realize what a danger it presented.You knew, as soon as you realized what you had, that if Radch authorities ever even dreamed of half imagining it existed, they would track you down and kill you, and anyone else who might have seen it.While the Radch wanted everyone to remember what had happened to the Garseddai, they wanted no one to know just how the Garseddai had managed to do what theyd done, what no one had managed to do for a thousand years before or another thousand years afterdestroy a Radchaai ship.Almost no one alive remembered.I knew, and any still extant ships that had been there.Anaander Mianaai certainly did.And Seivarden, who had seen for herself what the Lord of the Radch wanted no one to think was possiblethat invisible armor and gun, those bullets that defeated Radchaai armorand her ships heat shieldso effortlessly.I want it, I told Strigan.Ill pay you for it.If I had such a thing if!Its entirely possible no amount of money in the world would be sufficient.Anything is possible, I agreed.Youre Radchaai.And youre military.Was, I corrected.And when she scoffed, I added, If I still were, I wouldnt be here.Or if I were, you would already have given me whatever information I wanted, and youd be dead.Get out of here.Strigans voice was quiet, but vehement.Take your stray with you.Im not leaving until I have what I came for.There would be little point in doing so.Youll have to give it to me, or shoot me with it.As much as admitting I still had armor.Implying I was precisely what she feared, a Radchaai agent come to kill her and take the gun.Frightened of me as she must be, she could not avoid her own curiosity.Why do you want it so badly?I want, I told her, to kill Anaander Mianaai.What?The gun in her hand trembled, moved slightly aside, then steadied again.She leaned forward three millimeters, and cocked her head as though she was certain she hadnt heard me correctly.I want to kill Anaander Mianaai, I repeated.Anaander Mianaai, she said, bitterly, has thousands of bodies in hundreds of locations.You cant possibly kill him.Certainly not with one gun.I still want to try.Youre insane.Or is that even possible?Arent all Radchaai brainwashed?It was a common misconception.Only criminals, or people who arent functioning well, are reeducated.Nobody really cares what you think, as long as you do what youre supposed to.She stared, dubious.How do you define not functioning well?I made an indefinite, not my problem gesture with my free hand.Though perhaps it was my problem.Perhaps that question did concern me now, insofar as it might very well concern Seivarden.Im going to take my hand out of my coat, I said.And then Im going to go to sleep.Strigan said nothing, only twitched one gray eyebrow.If I found you, Anaander Mianaai certainly can, I said.We were speaking Strigans language.What gender had she assigned to the Lord of the Radch?He hasnt, yet, possibly because he is currently preoccupied with other matters, and for reasons that ought to be clear to you, he is likely hesitant to delegate in this affair.Im safe, then.She sounded more convinced of that than she could possibly be.Seivarden came noisily out of the bathroom and sank back onto her pallet, hands trembling, breathing quick and shallow.Im taking my hand out of my coat now, I said, and then did that.Slowly.Empty.Strigan sighed and lowered her gun.I probably couldnt shoot you anyway.Because she was sure I was Radchaai military, and hence armored.Of course, if she could take me unawares, or fire before I could extend my armor, she could indeed shoot me.And of course, she had that gun.Though she might not have it near to hand.Can I have my icon back?She frowned, and then remembered she was still holding it.Your icon.It belongs to me, I clarified.Thats quite a resemblance, she said, looking at it again.Wheres it from?Very far away.I held out my hand.She returned it, and one handed I brushed the trigger and the image folded into itself, and the base closed into its gold disk.Strigan looked over at Seivarden intently, and frowned.Your stray is having some anxiety.Yes.Strigan shook her head, frustrated or exasperated, and went into her infirmary.She returned, went to where Seivarden sat, leaned over, and reached for her.Seivarden started, shoving herself up and back, grabbing Strigans wrist in a move I knew was meant to break it.But Seivarden wasnt what she had once been.Dissipation and what I suspected was malnutrition had taken a toll.Strigan left her arm in Seivardens grasp, and with her other hand plucked a small white tab out of her own fingers and stuck it to Seivardens forehead.I dont feel sorry for you, she said, in Radchaai.Its just that Im a doctor.Seivarden looked at her with an unaccountable expression of horror.Let go of me.Let go, Seivarden, and lie down.I said, sharply.She stared two seconds more at Strigan, but then did as she was told.Im not taking him as my patient, Strigan said to me, as Seivardens breathing slowed and her muscles slackened.It isnt more than first aid.And I dont want him panicking and breaking my things.Im going to sleep now, I answered.We can talk more in the morning.It is morning.But she didnt argue further.She wouldnt be foolish enough to search my person while I slept.She would know how dangerous that would be.She wouldnt shoot me in my sleep either, though it would be a simple and effective way to be rid of me.Asleep, I would be an easy target for a bullet, unless I extended my armor now and left it up.But there was no need.Strigan wouldnt shoot me, at least not until she had the answers to her many questions.Even then she might not.I was too good a puzzle.Strigan wasnt in the main room when I woke, but the door into the bedroom was closed, and I assumed she was either asleep or wanted privacy.Seivarden was awake, staring at me, fidgeting, rubbing her arms and shoulders.A week earlier Id had to prevent her from scraping her skin raw.Shed improved a great deal.The box of money lay where Strigan had left it.
