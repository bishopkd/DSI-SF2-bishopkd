It was a worldview with no room for someone like Juanita.There is a certain kind of small town that grows like a boil on the ass of every Army base in the world.In a long series of such places, Hiro Protagonist was speed raised like a mutant hothouse orchid flourishing under the glow of a thousand Buy 'n' Fly security spotlights.Hiro's father had joined the army in 1944, at the age of sixteen, and spent a year in the Pacific, most of it as a prisoner of war.Hiro was born when his father was in his late middle age.By that time, Dad could long since have quit and taken his pension, but he wouldn't have known what to do with himself outside of the service, and so he stayed in until they finally kicked him out in the late eighties.By the time Hiro made it out to Berkeley, he had lived in Wrightstown, New Jersey; Tacoma, Washington; Fayetteville, North Carolina; Hinesville, Georgia; Killeen, Texas; Grafenwehr, Germany; Seoul, Korea; Ogden, Kansas; and Watertown, New York.All of these places were basically the same, with the same franchise ghettos, the same strip joints, and even the same peoplehe kept running into school chums he'd known years before, other Army brats who happened to wind up at the same base at the same time.Their skins were different colors but they all belonged to the same ethnic group: Military.Black kids didn't talk like black kids.Asian kids didn't bust their asses to excel in school.White kids, by and large, didn't have any problem getting along with the black and Asian kids.And girls knew their place.They all had the same moms with the same generous buttocks in stretchy slacks and the same frosted and curling ironed hairdos, and they were all basically sweet and endearing and conforming and, if they happened to be smart, they went out of their way to hide it.So the first time Hiro saw Juanita, or any other girl like her, his perspectives were bent all out of shape.She had long, glossy black hair that had never been subjected to any chemical process other than regular shampooing.She didn't wear blue stuff on her eyelids.Her clothing was dark, tailored, restrained.And she didn't take shit from anyone, not even her professors, which seemed shrewish and threatening to him at the time.When he saw her again after an absence of several yearsa period spent mostly in Japan, working among real grown ups from a higher social class than he was used to, people of substance who wore real clothes and did real things with their liveshe was startled to realize that Juanita was an elegant, stylish knockout.He thought at first that she had undergone some kind of radical changes since their first year in college.But then he went back to visit his father in one of those Army towns and ran into the high school prom queen.She had grown up shockingly fast into an overweight dame with loud hair and loud clothes who speed read the tabloids at the check out line in the commissary because she didn't have the spare money to buy them, who popped her gum and had two kids that she didn't have the energy or the foresight to discipline.Seeing this woman at the commissary, he finally went through a belated, dim witted epiphany, not a brilliant light shining down from heaven, more like the brown glimmer of a half dead flashlight from the top of a stepladder: Juanita hadn't really changed much at all since those days, just grown into herself.It was he who had changed.Radically.He came into her office once, strictly on a business matter.Until this point, they had seen each other around the office a lot but acted like they had never met before.But when he came into her office that day, she told him to close the door behind him, and she blacked out the screen on her computer and started twiddling a pencil between her hands and eyed him like a plate of day old sushi.Behind her on the wall was an amateurish painting of an old lady, set in an ornate antique frame.It was the only decoration in Juanita's office.All the other hackers had color photographs of the space shuttle lifting off, or posters of the starship Enterprise.It's my late grandmother, may God have mercy on her soul, she said, watching him look at the painting.My role model.Why?Was she a programmer?She just looked at him over the rotating pencil like, how slow can a mammal be and still have respiratory functions?But instead of lowering the boom on him, she just gave a simple answer: No.Then she gave a more complicated answer.When I was fifteen years old, I missed a period.My boyfriend and I were using a diaphragm, but I knew it was fallible.I was good at math, I had the failure rate memorized, burnt into my subconscious.Or maybe it was my conscious, I can never keep them straight.Anyway, I was terrified.Our family dog started treating me differentlysupposedly, they can smell a pregnant woman.Or a pregnant bitch, for that matter.By this point, Hiro's face was frozen in a wary, astonished position that Juanita later made extensive use of in her work.Because, as she was talking to him, she was watching his face, analyzing the way the little muscles in his forehead pulled his brows up and made his eyes change shape.My mother was clueless.My boyfriend was worse than cluelessin fact, I ditched him on the spot, because it made me realize what an alien the guy waslike many members of your species.By this, she was referring to males.Anyway, my grandmother came to visit, she continued, glancing back over her shoulder at the painting.I avoided her until we all sat down for dinner.And then she figured out the whole situation in, maybe, ten minutes, just by watching my face across the dinner table.I didn't say more than ten wordsPass the tortillas. 'I don't know how my face conveyed that information, or what kind of internal wiring in my grandmother's mind enabled her to accomplish this incredible feat.To condense fact from the vapor of nuance.Condense fact from the vapor of nuance.Hiro has never forgotten the sound of her speaking those words, the feeling that came over him as he realized for the first time how smart Juanita was.She continued.I didn't even really appreciate all of this until about ten years later, as a grad student, trying to build a user interface that would convey a lot of data very quickly, for one of these baby killer grants.This was her term for anything related to the Defense Department.I was coming up with all kinds of elaborate technical fixes like trying to implant electrodes directly into the brain.Then I remembered my grandmother and realized, my God, the human mind can absorb and process an incredible amount of informationif it comes in the right format.The right interface.If you put the right face on it.Want some coffee?Then he had an alarming thought: What had he been like back in college?How much of an asshole had he been?Had he left Juanita with a bad impression?Another young man would have worried about it in silence, but Hiro has never been restrained by thinking about things too hard, and so he asked her out for dinner and, after having a couple of drinks (she drank club sodas), just popped the question: Do you think I'm an asshole?She laughed.He smiled, believing that he had come up with a good, endearing, flirtatious bit of patter.He did not realize until a couple of years later that this question was, in effect, the cornerstone of their relationship.Did Juanita think that Hiro was an asshole?He always had some reason to think that the answer was yes, but nine times out of ten she insisted the answer was no.It made for some great arguments and some great sex, some dramatic fallings out and some passionate reconciliations, but in the end the wildness was just too much for themthey were exhausted by workand they backed away from each other.He was emotionally worn out from wondering what she really thought of him, and confused by the fact that he cared so deeply about her opinion.And she, maybe, was beginning to think that if Hiro was so convinced in his own mind that he was unworthy of her, maybe he knew something she didn't.Hiro would have chalked it all up to class differences, except that her parents lived in a house in Mexicali with a dirt floor, and his father made more money than many college professors.But the class idea still held sway in his mind, because class is more than incomeit has to do with knowing where you stand in a web of social relationships.Juanita and her folks knew where they stood with a certitude that bordered on dementia.Hiro never knew.His father was a sergeant major, his mother was a Korean woman whose people had been mine slaves in Nippon, and Hiro didn't know whether he was black or Asian or just plain Army, whether he was rich or poor, educated or ignorant, talented or lucky.He didn't even have a part of the country to call home until he moved to California, which is about as specific as saying that you live in the Northern Hemisphere.In the end, it was probably his general disorientation that did them in.After the breakup, Hiro went out with a long succession of essentially bimbos who (unlike Juanita) were impressed that he worked for a high tech Silicon Valley firm.More recently, he has had to go searching for women who are even easier to impress.Juanita went celibate for a while and then started going out with Da5id and eventually got married to him.Da5id had no doubts whatsoever about his standing in the world.His folks were Russian Jews from Brooklyn and had lived in the same brownstone for seventy years after coming from a village in Latvia where they had lived for five hundred years; with a Torah on his lap, he could trace his bloodlines all the way back to Adam and Eve.He was an only child who had always been first in his class in everything, and when he got his master's in computer science from Stanford, he went out and started his own company with about as much fuss as Hiro's dad used to exhibit in renting out a new P. O.  box when they moved.Then he got rich, and now he runs The Black Sun.Da5id has always been certain of everything.Even when he's totally wrong.Which is why Hiro quit his job at Black Sun Systems, despite the promise of future riches, and why Juanita divorced Da5id two years after she married him.Hiro did not attend Juanita and Da5id's wedding; he was languishing in jail, into which he had been thrown a few hours before the rehearsal.He had been found in Golden Gate Park, lovesick, wearing nothing but a thong, taking long pulls from a jumbo bottle of Courvoisier and practicing kendo attacks with a genuine samurai sword, floating across the grass on powerfully muscled thighs to slice other picnickers' hurtling Frisbees and baseballs in twain.Catching a long fly ball with the edge of your blade, neatly halving it like a grapefruit, is not an insignificant feat.The only drawback is that the owners of the baseball may misinterpret your intentions and summon the police.He got out of it by paying for all the baseballs and Frisbees, but since that episode, he has never even bothered to ask Juanita whether or not she thinks he's an asshole.Even Hiro knows the answer now.Since then, they've gone very different ways.In the early years of The Black Sun project, the only way the hackers ever got paid was by issuing stock to themselves.Hiro tended to sell his off almost as quickly as he got it.Juanita didn't.Now she's rich, and he isn't.It would be easy to say that Hiro is a stupid investor and Juanita a smart one, but the facts are a little more complicated than that: Juanita put her eggs in one basket, keeping all her money in Black Sun stock; as it turns out, she made a lot of money that way, but she could have gone broke, too.And Hiro didn't have a lot of choice in some ways.When his father got sick, the Army and the V. A.  took care of most of his medical bills, but they ran into a lot of expenses anyway, and Hiro's motherwho could barely speak Englishwasn't equipped to make or handle money on her own.When Hiro's father died, he cashed in all of his Black Sun stock to put Mom in a nice community in Korea.She loves it there.Goes golfing every day.He could have kept his money in The Black Sun and made ten million dollars about a year later when it went public, but his mother would have been a street person.So when his mother visits him in the Metaverse, looking tan and happy in her golfing duds, Hiro views that as his personal fortune.It won't pay the rent, but that's okaywhen you live in a shithole, there's always the Metaverse, and in the Metaverse, Hiro Protagonist is a warrior prince.8  His tongue is stinging; he realizes that, back in Reality, he has forgotten to swallow his beer.It's ironic that Juanita has come into this place in a low tech, black and white avatar.She was the one who figured out a way to make avatars show something close to real emotion.That is a fact Hiro has never forgotten, because she did most of her work when they were together, and whenever an avatar looks surprised or angry or passionate in the Metaverse, he sees an echo of himself or Juanitathe Adam and Eve of the Metaverse.Makes it hard to forget.Shortly after Juanita and Da5id got divorced, The Black Sun really took off.And once they got done counting their money, marketing the spinoffs, soaking up the adulation of others in the hacker community, they all came to the realization that what made this place a success was not the collision avoidance algorithms or the bouncer daemons or any of that other stuff.It was Juanita's faces.Just ask the businessmen in the Nipponese Quadrant.They come here to talk turkey with suits from around the world, and they consider it just as good as a face to face.They more or less ignore what is being saida lot gets lost in translation, after all.They pay attention to the facial expressions and body language of the people they are talking to.And that's how they know what's going on inside a person's headby condensing fact from the vapor of nuance.Juanita refused to analyze this process, insisted that it was something ineffable, something you couldn't explain with words.A radical, rosary toting Catholic, she has no problem with that kind of thing.But the bitheads didn't like it.Said it was irrational mysticism.So she quit and took a job with some Nipponese company.They don't have any problem with irrational mysticism as long as it makes money.But Juanita never comes to The Black Sun anymore.Partly, she's pissed at Da5id and the other hackers who never appreciated her work.But she has also decided that the whole thing is bogus.That no matter how good it is, the Metaverse is distorting the way people talk to each other, and she wants no such distortion in her relationships.Da5id notices Hiro, indicates with a flick of his eyes that this is not a good time.Normally, such subtle gestures are lost in the system's noise, but Da5id has a very good personal computer, and Juanita helped design his avatarso the message comes through like a shot fired into the ceiling.Hiro turns away, saunters around the big circular bar in a slow orbit.Most of the sixty four bar stools are filled with lower level Industry people, getting together in twos and threes, doing what they do best: gossip and intrigue.So I get together with the director for a story conference.He's got this beach house  Incredible?Don't get me started.I heard.Debi was there for a party when Frank and Mitzi owned it.Anyway, there's this scene, early, where the main character wakes up in a dumpster.The idea is to show how, you know, despondent he is  That crazy energy  Exactly.Fabulous.I like it.Well, he wants to replace it with a scene where the guy is out in the desert with a bazooka, blowing up old cars in an abandoned junkyard.You're kidding!So we're sitting there on his fucking patio over the beach and he's going, like, whoom!whoom!imitating this goddamn bazooka.He's thrilled by the idea.I mean, this is a man who wants to put a bazooka in a movie.So I think I talked him out of it.Nice scene.But you're right.A bazooka doesn't do the same thing as a dumpster.Hiro pauses long enough to get this down, then keeps walking.He mumbles Bigboard again, recalls the magic map, pinpoints his own location, and then reads off the name of this nearby screenwriter.Later on, he can do a search of industry publications to find out what script this guy is working on, hence the name of this mystery director with a fetish for bazookas.Since this whole conversation has come to him via his computer, he's just taken an audio tape of the whole thing.Later, he can process it to disguise the voices, then upload it to the Library, cross referenced under the director's name.A hundred struggling screenwriters will call this conversation up, listen to it over and over until they've got it memorized, paying Hiro for the privilege, and within a few weeks, bazooka scripts will flood the director's office.Whoom!The Rock Star Quadrant is almost too bright to look at.Rock star avatars have the hairdos that rock stars can only wear in their dreams.Hiro scans it briefly to see if any of his friends are in there, but it's mostly parasites and has beens.Most of the people Hiro knows are willbes or wannabes.The Movie Star Quadrant is easier to look at.Actors love to come here because in The Black Sun, they always look as good as they do in the movies.And unlike a bar or club in Reality, they can get into this place without physically having to leave their mansion, hotel suite, ski lodge, private airline cabin, or whatever.They can strut their stuff and visit with their friends without any exposure to kidnappers, paparazzi, script flingers, assassins, exspouses, autograph brokers, process servers, psycho fans, marriage proposals, or gossip columnists.He gets up off the bar stool and resumes his slow orbit, scanning the Nipponese Quadrant.It's a lot of guys in suits, as usual.Some of them are talking to gringos from the Industry.And a large part of the quadrant, in the back corner, has been screened off by a temporary partition.Bigboard again.Hiro figures out which tables are behind the partition, starts reading off the names.The only one he recognizes immediately is an American: L.  Bob Rife, the cable television monopolist.A very big name to the Industry, though he's rarely seen.He seems to be meeting with a whole raft of big Nipponese honchos.Hiro has his computer memorize their names so that, later, he can check them against the CIC database and find out who they are.It has the look of a big and important meeting.Secret Agent Hiro!How are you doing?Hiro turns around.Juanita is right behind him, standing out in her black and white avatar, looking good anyway.How are you?she asks.Fine.How are you?Great.I hope you don't mind talking to me in this ugly fax of life avatar.Juanita, I would rather look at a fax of you than most other women in the flesh.Thanks, you sly bastard.It's been a long time since we've talked!she observes, as though there's something remarkable about this.Something's going on.I hope you're not going to mess around with Snow Crash, she says.Da5id won't listen to me.What am I, a model of self restraint?I'm exactly the kind of guy who would mess around with it.I know you better than that.You're impulsive.But you're very clever.You have those sword fighting reflexes.What does that have to do with drug abuse?It means you can see bad things coming and deflect them.It's an instinct, not a learned thing.As soon as you turned around and saw me, that look came over your face, like, what's going on?What the hell is Juanita up to?I didn't think you talked to people in the Metaverse.I do if I want to get through to someone in a hurry, she says.And I'll always talk to you.Why me?You know.Because of us.Remember?Because of our relationshipwhen I was writing this thingyou and I are the only two people who can ever have an honest conversation in the Metaverse.You're just the same mystical crank you always were, he says, smiling so as to make this a charming statement.You can't imagine how mystical and cranky I am now, Hiro.How mystical and cranky are you?She eyes him warily.Exactly the same way she did when he came into her office years ago.It comes into his mind to wonder why she is always so alert in his presence.In college, he used to think that she was afraid of his intellect, but he's known for years that this is the last of her worries.At Black Sun Systems, he figured that it was just typical female guardednessJuanita was afraid he was trying to get her into the sack.But this, too, is pretty much out of the question.At this late date in his romantic career, he is just canny enough to come up with a new theory: She's being careful because she likes him.She likes him in spite of herself.He is exactly the kind of tempting but utterly wrong romantic choice that a smart girl like Juanita must learn to avoid.That's definitely it.There's something to be said for getting older.By way of answering his question, she says, I have an associate I'd like you to meet.A gentleman and a scholar named Lagos.He's a fascinating guy to talk to.Is he your boyfriend?She thinks this one over rather than lashing out instantaneously.My behavior at The Black Sun to the contrary, I don't fuck every male I work with.And even if I did, Lagos is out of the question.Not your type?Not by a long shot.What is your type, anyway?Old, rich, unimaginative blonds with steady careers.This one almost slips by him.Then he catches it.Well, I could dye my hair.And I'll get old eventually.She actually laughs.It's a tension releasing kind of outburst.Believe me, Hiro, I'm the last person you want to be involved with at this point.Is this part of your church thing?he asks.Juanita has been using her excess money to start her own branch of the Catholic churchshe considers herself a missionary to the intelligent atheists of the world.Don't be condescending, she says.That's exactly the attitude I'm fighting.Religion is not for simpletons.Sorry.This is unfair, you knowyou can read every expression on my face, and I'm looking at you through a fucking blizzard.It's definitely related to religion, she says.But this is so complex, and your background in that area is so deficient, I don't know where to begin.Hey, I went to church every week in high school.I sang in the choir.I know.That's exactly the problem.Ninety nine percent of everything that goes on in most Christian churches has nothing whatsoever to do with the actual religion.Intelligent people all notice this sooner or later, and they conclude that the entire one hundred percent is bullshit, which is why atheism is connected with being intelligent in people's minds.So none of that stuff I learned in church has anything to do with what you're talking about?Juanita thinks for a while, eyeing him.Then she pulls a hypercard out of her pocket.Here.Take this.As Hiro pulls it from her hand, the hypercard changes from a jittery two dimensional figment into a realistic, cream colored, finely textured piece of stationery.Printed across its face in glossy black ink is a pair of words      9  The world freezes and grows dim for a second.The Black Sun loses its smooth animation and begins to move in fuzzy stop action.Clearly, his computer has just taken a major hit; all of its circuits are busy processing a huge bolus of datathe contents of the hypercardand don't have time to redraw the image of The Black Sun in its full, breathtaking fidelity.Holy shit!he says, when The Black Sun pops back into full animation again.What the hell is in this card?You must have half of the Library in here!And a librarian to boot, Juanita says, to help you sort through it.And lots of videotapes of L.  Bob Rifewhich accounts for most of the bytes.Well, I'll try to have a look at it, he says dubiously.Do.Unlike Da5id, you're just smart enough to benefit from this.And in the meantime, stay away from Raven.And stay away from Snow Crash.Okay?Who's Raven?he asks.But Juanita is already on her way out the door.The fancy avatars all turn around to watch her as she goes past them, the movie stars give her drop dead looks, and the hackers purse their lips and stare reverently.Hiro orbits back around to the Hacker Quadrant.Da5id's shuffling hypercards around on his tablebusiness stats on The Black Sun, film and video clips, hunks of software, scrawled telephone numbers.There's a little blip in the operating system that hits me right in the gut every time you come in the door, Da5id says.I always have this premonition that The Black Sun is headed for a crash.Must be Bigboard, Hiro says.It has one routine that patches some of the traps in low memory, for a moment.Ah, that's it.Please, please throw that thing away, Da5id says.What, Bigboard?Yeah.It was totally rad at one point, but now it's like trying to work on a fusion reactor with a stone ax.Thanks.I'll give you all the headers you need if you want to update it to something a little less dangerous, Da5id says.I wasn't impugning your abilities.I'm just saying you need to keep up with the times.It's fucking hard, Hiro says.There's no place for a freelance hacker anymore.You have to have a big corporation behind you.I'm aware of that.And I'm aware that you can't stand to work for a big corporation.That's why I'm saying, I'll give you the stuff you need.You're always a part of The Black Sun to me, Hiro, even since we parted ways.It is classic Da5id.He's talking with his heart again, bypassing his head.If Da5id weren't a hacker, Hiro would despair of his ever having enough brains to do anything.Let's talk about something else, Hiro says.Was I just hallucinating, or are you and Juanita on speaking terms again?Da5id gives him an indulgent smile.He has been very kind to Hiro ever since The Conversation, several years back.It was a conversation that started out as a friendly chat over beer and oysters between a couple of longtime comrades in arms.It was not until three quarters of the way through The Conversation that it dawned on Hiro that he was, in fact, being fired, at this very moment.Since The Conversation, Da5id has been known to feed Hiro useful bits of intel and gossip from time to time.Fishing for something useful?Da5id asks knowingly.Like many bitheads, Da5id is utterly guileless, but at times like this, he thinks he's the reincarnation of Machiavelli.I got news for you, man, Hiro says.Most of the stuff you give me, I never put into the Library.Why not?Hell, I give you all my best gossip.I thought you were making money off that stuff.I just can't stand it, Hiro says, taking parts of my private conversations and whoring them out.Why do you think I'm broke?There's another thing he doesn't mention, which is that he's always considered himself to be Da5id's equal, and he can't stand the idea of feeding off Da5id's little crumbs and tidbits, like a dog curled up under his table.I was glad to see Juanita come in hereeven as a black and white, Da5id says.For her not to use The Black Sunit's like Alexander Graham Bell refusing to use the telephone.Why did she come in tonight?Something's bugging her, Da5id says.She wanted to know if I'd seen certain people on the Street.Anyone in particular?She's worried about a really large guy with long black hair, Da5id says.Peddling something calledget thisSnow Crash.Has she tried the Library?Yeah.I assume so, anyway.Have you seen this guy?Oh, yeah.It's not hard to find him, Da5id says.He's right outside the door.I got this from him.Da5id scans the table, picks up one of the hypercards, and shows it to Hiro.Da5id, Hiro says, I can't believe you took a hypercard from a black and white person.Da5id laughs.This is not the old days, my friend.I've got so much antiviral medicine in my system that nothing could get through.I get so much contaminated shit from all the hackers who come through here, it's like working in a plague ward.So I'm not afraid of whatever's in this hypercard.Well, in that case, I'm curious, Hiro says.Yeah.Me, too.Da5id laughs.It's probably something very disappointing.Probably an animercial, Da5id agrees.Think I should do it?Yeah.Go for it.It's not every day you get to try out a new drug, Hiro says.Well, you can try one every day if you want to, Da5id says, but it's not every day you find one that can't hurt you.He picks up the hypercard and tears it in half.For a second, nothing happens.I'm waiting, Da5id says.An avatar materializes on the table in front of Da5id, starting out ghostly and transparent, gradually becoming solid and three dimensional.It's a really trite effect; Hiro and Da5id are already laughing.The avatar is a stark naked Brandy.It doesn't even look like the standard Brandy; this looks like one of the cheap Taiwanese Brandy knockoffs.Clearly, it's just a daemon.She is holding a pair of tubes in her hands, about the size of paper towel rolls.Da5id is leaning back in his chair, enjoying this.There is something hilariously tawdry about the entire scene.The Brandy leans forward, beckoning Da5id toward her.Da5id leans into her face, grinning broadly.She puts her crude, ruby red lips up by his ear and mumbles something that Hiro can't hear.When she leans back away from Da5id, his face has changed.He looks dazed and expressionless.Maybe Da5id really looks that way; maybe Snow Crash has messed up his avatar somehow so that it's no longer tracking Da5id's true facial expressions.But he's staring straight ahead, eyes frozen in their sockets.The Brandy holds the pair of tubes up in front of Da5id's immobilized face and spreads them apart.It's actually a scroll.She's unrolling it right in front of Da5id's face, spreading it apart like a flat two dimensional screen in front of his eyes.Da5id's paralyzed face has taken on a bluish tinge as it reflects light coming out of the scroll.Hiro walks around the table to look.He gets a brief glimpse of the scroll before the Brandy snaps it shut again.It is a living wall of light, like a flexible, flat screened television set, and it's not showing anything at all.Just static.White noise.Snow.Then she's gone, leaving no trace behind.Desultory, sarcastic applause sounds from a few tables in the Hacker Quadrant.Da5id's back to normal, wearing a grin that's part snide and part embarrassed.What was it?Hiro says.I just glimpsed some snow at the very end.You saw the whole thing, Da5id says.A fixed pattern of black and white pixels, fairly high resolution.Just a few hundred thousand ones and zeroes for me to look at.So in other words, someone just exposed your optic nerve to, what, maybe a hundred thousand bytes of information, Hiro says.Noise, is more like it.Well, all information looks like noise until you break the code, Hiro says.Why would anyone show me information in binary code?I'm not a computer.I can't read a bitmap.Relax, Da5id, I'm just shitting you, Hiro says.You know what it was?You know how hackers are always trying to show me samples of their work?Yeah.Some hacker came up with this scheme to show me his stuff.And everything worked fine until the moment the Brandy opened the scrollbut his code was buggy, and it snow crashed at the wrong moment, so instead of seeing his output, all I saw was snow.Then why did he call the thing Snow Crash?Gallows humor.He knew it was buggy.What did the Brandy whisper in your ear?Some language I didn't recognize, Da5id says.Just a bunch of babble.Babble.Babel.Afterward, you looked sort of stunned.Da5id looks resentful.I wasn't stunned.I just found the whole experience so weird, I guess I just was taken aback for a second.Hiro is giving him an extremely dubious look.Da5id notices it and stands up.Want to go see what your competitors in Nippon are up to?What competitors?You used to design avatars for rock stars, right?Still do.Well, Sushi K is here tonight.Oh, yeah.The hairdo the size of a galaxy.You can see the rays from here, Da5id says, waving toward the next quadrant, but I want to see the whole getup.It does look as though the sun is rising somewhere in the middle of the Rock Star Quadrant.Above the heads of the milling avatars, Hiro can see a fan of orange beams radiating outward from some point in the middle of the crowd.It keeps moving, turning around, shaking from side to side, and the whole universe seems to move with it.On the Street, the full radiance of Sushi K's Rising Sun hairdo is suppressed by the height and width regulations.But Da5id allows free expression inside The Black Sun, so the orange rays extend all the way to the property lines.I wonder if anyone's told him yet that Americans won't buy rap music from a Japanese person, Hiro says as they stroll over there.Maybe you should tell him, Da5id suggests, charge him for the service.He's in L. A.  right now, you know.Probably staying in a hotel full of bootlickers telling him what a big star he's going to be.He needs to be exposed to some actual biomass.They inject themselves into a stream of traffic, winding a narrow channel through a rift in the crowd.Biomass?Da5id says.A body of living stuff.It's an ecology term.If you take an acre of rain forest or a cubic mile of ocean or a square block of Compton and strain out all the on living stuffdirt and wateryou get the biomass.Da5id, ever the bithead, says, I do not understand.His voice sounds funny; there's a lot of white noise creeping into his audio.Industry expression, Hiro says.The Industry feeds off the human biomass of America.Like a whale straining krill from the sea.Hiro wedges himself between a couple of Nipponese businessmen.One is wearing a uniform blue, but the other is a neo traditional, wearing a dark kimono.And, like Hiro, he's wearing two swordsthe long katana on his left hip and the one handed wakizashi stuck diagonally in his waistband.He and Hiro glance cursorily at each other's armaments.Then Hiro looks away and pretends not to notice, while the neo traditional is freezing solid, except for the corners of his mouth, which are curling downward.Hiro has seen this kind of thing before.He knows he's about to get into a fight.People are moving out of the way; something big and inexorable is plunging through the crowd, shoving avatars this way and that.Only one thing has the ability to shove people around like that inside The Black Sun, and that's a bouncer daemon.As they get closer, Hiro sees that it's a whole flying wedge of them, gorillas in tuxedos.Real gorillas.And they seem to be headed toward Hiro.He tries to back away, but he quickly runs into something.Looks like Bigboard finally got him in trouble; he's on his way out of the bar.Da5id, Hiro says.Call them off, man, I'll stop using it.All of the people in his vicinity are staring over Hiro's shoulder, their faces illuminated by a stew of brilliant colored lights.Hiro turns around to look at Da5id.But Da5id's not there anymore.Instead of Da5id, there is just a jittering cloud of bad digital karma.It's so bright and fast and meaningless that it hurts to look at.It flashes back and forth from color to black and white, and when it's in color, it rolls wildly around the color wheel as though being strafed with high powered disco lights.And it's not staying within it's own body space; hair thin pixel lines keep shooting off to one side, passing all the way across The Black Sun and out through the wall.It is not so much an organized body as it is a centrifugal cloud of lines and polygons whose center cannot hold, throwing bright bits of body shrapnel all over the room, interfering with people's avatars, flickering and disappearing.The gorillas don't mind.They shove their long furry fingers into the midst of the disintegrating cloud and latch onto it somehow and carry it past Hiro, toward the exit.Hiro looks down as it goes past him and sees what looks very much like Da5id's face as viewed through a pile of shattered glass.It's just a momentary glimpse.Then the avatar is gone, expertly drop kicked out the front door, soaring out over the Street in a long flat arc that takes it over the horizon.Hiro looks up the aisle to see Da5id's table, empty, surrounded by stunned hackers.Some of them are shocked, some are trying to stifle grins.Da5id Meier, supreme hacker overload, founding father of the Metaverse protocol, creator and proprietor of the world famous Black Sun, has just suffered a system crash.He's been thrown out of his own bar by his own daemons.10  About the second or third thing they learned how to do when studying to become Kouriers was how to shiv open a pair of handcuffs.Handcuffs are not intended as long term restraint devices, millions of Clink franchisees to the contrary.And the longtime status of skateboarders as an oppressed ethnic group means that by now all of them are escape artists of some degree.First things first.Y. T.  has many a thing hanging off her uniform.The uniform has a hundred pockets, big flat pockets for deliveries and eensy narrow pockets for gear, pockets sewn into sleeves, thighs, shins.The equipment stuck into these multifarious pockets tends to be small, tricky, lightweight: pens, markers, penlights, penknives, lock picks, bar code scanners, flares, screwdrivers, Liquid Knuckles, bundy stunners, and lightsticks.A calculator is stuck upside down to her right thigh, doubling as a taxi meter and a stopwatch.On the other thigh is a personal phone.As the manager is locking the door upstairs, it begins to ring.Y. T.  offhooks it with her free hand.It is her mother.Hi, Mom.Fine, how are you?I'm at Tracy's house.Yeah, we went to the Metaverse.We were just fooling around at this arcade on the Street.Pretty bumpin'.Yes, I used a nice avatar.Nah, Tracy's mom said she'd give me a ride home later.But we might stop off at the Joyride on Victory for a while, okay?Okay, well, sleep tight, Mom.I will.I love you, too.See you later.She punches the flash button, killing the chat with Mom and giving her a fresh dial tone in the space of about half a second.Roadkill, she says.The telephone remembers and dials Roadkill's number.Roaring sounds.This is the sound of air peeling over the microphone of Roadkill's personal phone at some terrifying velocity.Also the competing whooshes of many vehicles' tires on pavement, broken by chuckhole percussion; sounds like the crumbling Ventura.Yo, Y. T. , Roadkill says, 'sup?'Sup with you?Surfing the Tura.'Sup with you?Maxing The Clink.Whoa!Who popped you?MetaCops.Affixed me to the gate of White Columns with a loogie gun.Whoa, how very!When you leaving?Soon.Can you swing by and give me a hand?What do you mean?Men.You know, give me a hand.You're my boyfriend, she says, speaking very simply and plainly.If I get popped, you're supposed to come around and help bust me out.Isn't everyone supposed to know this stuff?Don't parents teach their kids anything anymore?Well, uh, where are you?Buy 'n' Fly number 501,762.I'm on my way to Bernie with a super ultra.As in San Bernardino.As in super ultra high priority delivery.As in, you're out of luck.Okay, thanks for nothing.Sorry.Surfing safety, Y. T.  says, in the traditional sarcastic sign off.Keep breathing, Roadkill says.The roaring noise snaps off.What a jerk.Next date, he's really going to have to grovel.But in the meantime, there's one other person who owes her one.The only problem is that he might be a spaz.But it's worth a try.Hello?he says into his personal phone.He's breathing hard and a couple of sirens are dueling in the background.Hiro Protagonist?Yeah, who's this?Y. T.  Where are you?In the parking lot of a Safeway on Oahu, he says.And he's telling the truth; in the background she can hear the shopping carts performing their clashy, anal copulations.I'm kind of busy now, Whiteybut what can I do for you?It's Y. T. , she says, and you can help bust me out of The Clink.She gives him the details.How long ago did he put you there?Ten minutes.Okay, the three ring binder for Clink franchises states that the manager is supposed to check on the detainee half an hour after admission.How do you know this stuff?she says accusingly.Use your imagination.As soon as the manager pulls his half hour check, wait for another five minutes, and then make your move.I'll try to give you a hand.Okay?Got it.At half an hour on the dot, she hears the back door being unlocked.The lights come on.Her Knight Visions save her from wracking eyeball pains.The manager thunks down a couple of steps, glares at her, glares at her for rather a long time.The manager, clearly, is tempted.That momentary glimpse of flesh has been ricocheting around in his brain for half an hour.He is wracking his mind with vast cosmological dilemmas.Y. T.  hopes that he does not try anything, because the dentata's effects can be unpredictable.Make up your fucking mind, she says.It works.This fresh burst of culture shock rattles the jeek out of his ethical conundrum.He gives Y. T.  a disapproving glowershe, after all, forced him to be attracted to her, forced him to get horny, made his head swimshe didn't have to get arrested, did she?and so on top of everything else he's angry with her.As if he has a right to be.This is the gender that invented the polio vaccine?He turns, goes back up the steps, kills the light, locks the door.She notes the time, sets her alarm watch for five minutes from nowthe only North American who actually knows how to set the alarm on her digital wrist watchpulls her shiv kit from one of the narrow pockets on her sleeve.She also hauls out a lightstick and snaps it so she can see 'sup.She finds one piece of narrow, flat spring steel, slides it up into the manacle's innards, depresses the spring loaded pawl.The cuff, formerly a one way ratchet that could only get tighter, springs loose from the cold water pipe.She could take it off her wrist, but she has decided she likes the look of it.She cuffs the loose manacle onto her wrist, right next to the other one, forming a double bracelet.The kind of thing her mom used to do, back when she was a punk.The steel door is locked, but Buy 'n' Fly safety regs mandate an emergency exit from the basement in case of fire.Here, it's a basement window with mondo bars and a big red multilingual fire alarm bolted onto it.The red looks black in the green glow of the lightstick.She reads the instructions that are in English, runs through it once or twice in her mind, then waits for the alarm to go off.She whiles away the time by reading the instructions in all the other languages, wondering which is which.It all looks like Taxilinga to Y. T.   The window is almost too grungy to see through, but she sees something black walking past it.Hiro.About ten seconds later, her wristwatch goes off.She punches the emergency exit.The bell rings.The bars are trickier than she thoughtgood thing it's not a real firebut eventually she gets them open.She throws her plank outside onto the parking lot, drags her body through just as she hears the rear door being unlocked.By the time the three ringer has found that all important light switch, she is banking a sharp turn into the front lotwhich has turned into a jeek festival!Every jeek in Southern Cal is here, it seems, driving their giant, wrecked taxicabs with alien livestock in the back seat, reeking of incense and sloshing neon hued Air wicks!They have set up a giant eight tubed hookah on the trunk of one of the cabs and are slurping up great mountain man lungfuls of choking smoke.And they're all staring at Hiro Protagonist, who is just staring back at them.Everyone in the parking lot looks completely astounded.He must have made his approach from the reardidn't realize that the front lot was full of jeeks.Whatever he was planning isn't going to work.The plan is screwed.The manager comes running around from the back of the Buy 'n' Fly, sounding a bloodcurdling Taxilinga tocsin.He's got missile lock on Y. T.'s ass.But the jeeks around the hookah don't care about Y. T.  They've got missile lock on Hiro.They carefully hang the ornate silver nozzles on a rack built into the neck of the mega bong.Then they start moving toward him, reaching into the folds of their robes, the inner pockets of their windbreakers.Y. T.  is distracted by a sharp hissing noise.Her eyes glance back at Hiro, and she sees that he has withdrawn a three foot, curved sword from a scabbard, which she did not notice before.He has dropped into a squat.The blade of the sword glitters painfully under the killer security lights of the Buy 'n' Fly.How sweet!It would be an understatement to say that the hookah boys are taken aback.But they are not scared so much as they are confused.Almost undoubtedly, most of them have guns.So why is this guy trying to bother them with a sword?She remembers that one of the multiple professions on Hiro's business card is Greatest sword fighter in the world.Can he really take out a whole clan of armed jeeks?The manager's hand clenches her upper armlike this is really going to stop her.She reaches across her body with the other hand and lets him have it with a brief squirt of Liquid Knuckles.He makes a muffled, distant grunt, his head snaps back, he lets go of her arm and staggers back wildly until he sprawls against another taxi, jamming the heels of both hands into his eye sockets.Wait a sec.There's nobody in that particular taxi.But she can see a two foot long macram keychain dangling from the ignition.She tosses her plank through the window of the taxi, dives in after it (she's small, opening the door is optional), climbs in behind the driver's seat, sinking into a deep nest of wooden beads and air fresheners, grinds the motor, and takes off.Backward.Headed for the rear parking lot.The car was pointed outward, in taxicab style, ready for a quick getaway, which would be fine if she were by herselfbut there is Hiro to think of.The radio is screaming, alive with hollered bursts of Taxilinga.She backs all the way around behind the Buy 'n' Fly.The back lot is strangely quiet and empty.She shifts into drive and blasts back the way she came.The jeeks haven't quite had time to react, were expecting her to come out the other way.She screams it to a halt right next to Hiro, who has already had the presence of mind to put his sword back in its scabbard.He dives in the passenger side window.Then she stops paying attention to him.She's got other stuff to look at, such as whether she's going to get broadsided as she pulls out onto the road.She doesn't get broadsided, though a car has to squeal around her.She guns it out onto the highway.It responds as only an ancient taxicab will.The only problem being that half a dozen other ancient taxicabs are now following them.Something is pressing against Y. T.'s left thigh.She looks down.It is a remarkably huge revolver in a net bag hanging on the door panel.She has to find someplace to pull into.If she could find a Nova Sicilia franchulate, that would do itthe Mafia owes her one.Or a New South Africa, which she hates.But the New South Africans hate jeeks even more.Scratch that; Hiro is black, or at least part black.Can't take him into New South Africa.And because Y. T.  is a Cauc, they can't go to Metazania.Mr.Lee's Greater Hong Kong, Hiro says.Half mile ahead on the right.Nice thinkingbut they won't let you in with your swords, will they?Yes, he says, because I'm a citizen.Then she sees it.The sign stands out because it is a rare one.Don't see many of these.It is a green and blue sign, soothing and calm in a glare torn franchise ghetto.It says:    MR.LEE'S GREATER HONG KONG    Explosive noise from in back.Her head smacks into the whiplash arrestor.Another taxi rear ended them.And she screams into the parking lot of Mr.Lee's doing seventy five.The security system doesn't even have time to rez her visa and drop the STD, so it's Severe Tire Damage all the way, those bald radials are left behind on the spikes.Sparking along on four naked rims, she shrieks to a stop on the lawngrid, which doubles as carbon dioxide eating turf and impervious parking lot.She and Hiro climb out of the car.Hiro is grinning wildly, pinioned in the crossfire of a dozen red laser beams scanning him from every direction at once.The Hong Kong robot security system is checking him out.Her, too; she looks down to see the lasers scribbling across her chest.Welcome to Mr.Lee's Greater Hong Kong, Mr.Protagonist, the security system says through a P. A.  speaker.And welcome to your guest, Ms.Y. T.   The other taxis have stopped in formation along the curb.Several of them overshot the Hong Kong franchise and had to back up a block or so.A barrage of doors thunking shut.Some of them don't bother, just leave the engines running and the doors wide open.Three jeeks linger on the sidewalk, eyeing the tire shreds impaled on spikes: long streaks of neoprene sprouting steel and fiberglass hairs, like ruined toupees.One of them has a revolver in his hand, pointed straight down at the sidewalk.Four more jeeks run up to join them.Y. T.  counts two more revolvers and a pump shotgun.Any more of these guys and they'll be able to form a government.They step carefully over the spikes and onto the lush Hong Kong lawngrid.As they do, the lasers appear once more.The jeeks turn all red and grainy for a second.Then something different happens.Lights come on.The security system wants better illumination on these people.Hong Kong franchulates are famous for their lawngridswhoever heard of a lawn you could park on?and for their antennas.They all look like NASA research facilities with their antennas.Some of them are satellite uplinks, pointed at the sky.But some of them, tiny little antennas, are pointed at the ground, at the lawngrid.Y. T.  does not really get this, but these small antennas are millimeter wave radar transceivers.Like any other radar, they are good at picking up metallic objects.Unlike the radar in an air traffic control center, they can rez fine details.The rez of a system is only as fine as its wavelength; since the wavelength of this radar is about a millimeter, it can see the fillings in your teeth, the grommets in your Converse high tops, the rivets in your Levi's.It can calculate the value of your pocket change.Seeing guns is not a problem.This thing can even tell if the guns are loaded, and with what sort of ammunition.That is an important function, because guns are illegal in Mr.Lee's Greater Hong Kong.11  It doesn't seem polite to hang around and gawk over the fact that Da5id's computer crashed.A lot of the younger hackers are doing just that, as a way of showing all the other hackers how knowledgeable they are.Hiro shrugs it off and turns back in the direction of the Rock Star Quadrant.He still wants to see Sushi K's hairdo.But his path is being blocked by the Nipponese manthe neo traditional.The guy with the swords.He's facing off against Hiro, about two sword lengths apart, and it doesn't look like he intends to move.Hiro does the polite thing.He bows at the waist, straightens up.The businessman does the much less polite thing.He looks Hiro rather carefully up and down, then returns the bow.Sort of.These the businessman says.Very nice.Thank you, sir.Please feel free to converse in Nipponese if you prefer.This is what your avatar wears.You do not carry such weapons in Reality, the businessman says.In English.I'm sorry to be difficult, but in fact, I do carry such weapons in Reality, Hiro says.Exactly like these?Exactly.These are ancient weapons, then, the businessman says.Yes, I believe they are.How did you come to be in possession of such important family heirlooms from Nippon?the businessman says.Hiro knows the subtext here: What do you use those swords for, boy, slicing watermelon?They are now my family heirlooms, Hiro says.My father won them.Won them?Gambling?Single combat.It was a struggle between my father and a Nipponese officer.The story is quite complicated.Please excuse me if I have misinterpreted your story, the businessman says, but I was under the impression that men of your race were not allowed to fight during that war.Your impression is correct, Hiro says.My father was a truck driver.Then how did he come to be in hand to hand combat with a Nipponese officer?The incident took place outside a prisoner of war camp, Hiro says.My father and another prisoner tried to escape.They were pursued by a number of Nipponese soldiers and the officer who owned these swords.Your story is very difficult to believe, the businessman says, because your father could not have survived such an escape long enough to pass the swords on to his son.Nippon is an island nation.There is nowhere he could have escaped to.This happened very late in the war, Hiro says, and this camp was just outside of Nagasaki.The businessman chokes, reddens, nearly loses it.His left hand reaches up to grip the scabbard of his sword.Hiro looks around; suddenly they are in the center of an open circle of people some ten yards across.Do you think that the manner in which you came to possess these swords was honorable?the businessman says.If I did not, I would long since have returned them, Hiro says.Then you will not object to losing them in the same fashion, the businessman says.Nor will you object to losing yours, Hiro says.The businessman reaches across his body with his right hand, grips the handle of his sword just below the guard, draws it out, snaps it forward so it's pointing at Hiro, then places his left hand on the grip just below the right.Hiro does the same.Both of them bend their knees, dropping into a low squat while keeping the torso bolt upright, then stand up again and shuffle their feet into the proper stancefeet parallel, both pointed straight ahead, right foot in front of the left foot.The businessman turns out to have a lot of zanshin.Translating this concept into English is like translating fuckface into Nipponese, but it might translate into emotional intensity in football lingo.He charges directly at Hiro, hollering at the top of his lungs.The movement actually consists of a very rapid shuffling motion of the feet, so that he stays balanced at all times.At the last moment, he draws the sword up over his head and snaps it down toward Hiro.Hiro brings his own sword up, rotating it around sideways so that the handle is up high, above and to the left of his face, and the blade slopes down and to the right, providing a roof above him.The businessman's blow bounces off this roof like rain, and then Hiro sidesteps to let him go by and snaps the sword down toward his unprotected shoulder.But the businessman is moving too fast, and Hiro's timing is off.The blade cuts behind and to the side of the businessman.Both men wheel to face each other, back up, get back into the stance.Emotional intensity doesn't convey the half of it, of course.It is the kind of coarse and disappointing translation that makes the dismembered bodies of samurai warriors spin in their graves.The word zanshin is larded down with a lot of other folderol that you have to be Nipponese to understand.And Hiro thinks, frankly, that most of it is pseudomystical crap, on the same level as his old high school football coach exhorting his men to play at 110 percent.The businessman makes another attack.This one is pretty straightforward: a quick shuffling approach and then a snapping cut in the direction of Hiro's ribcage.Hiro parries it.Now Hiro knows something about this businessman, namely, that like most Nipponese sword fighters, all he knows is kendo.Kendo is to real samurai sword fighting what fencing is to real swashbuckling: an attempt to take a highly disorganized, chaotic, violent, and brutal conflict and turn it into a cute game.As in fencing, you're only supposed to attack certain parts of the bodythe parts that are protected by armor.As in fencing, you're not allowed to kick your opponent in the kneecaps or break a chair over his head.And the judging is totally subjective.In kendo, you can get a good solid hit on your opponent and still not get credit for it, because the judges feel you didn't possess the right amount of zanshin.Hiro doesn't have any zanshin at all.He just wants this over with.The next time the businessman sets up his ear splitting screech and shuffles toward Hiro, cutting and snapping his blade, Hiro parries the attack, turns around, and cuts both of his legs off just above the knees.The businessman collapses to the floor.It takes a lot of practice to make your avatar move through the Metaverse like a real person.When your avatar has just lost its legs, all that skill goes out the window.Well, land sakes!Hiro says.Lookee here!He whips his blade sideways, cutting off both of the businessman's forearms, causing the sword to clatter onto the floor.Better fire up the ol' barbecue, Jemima!Hiro continues, whipping the sword around sideways, cutting the businessman's body in half just above the navel.Then he leans down so he's looking right into the businessman's face.Didn't anyone tell you, he says, losing the dialect, that I was a hacker?Then he hacks the guy's head off.It falls to the floor, does a half roll, and comes to rest staring straight up at the ceiling.So Hiro steps back a couple of paces and mumbles, Safe.A largish safe, about a meter on a side, materializes just below the ceiling, plummets, and lands directly on the businessman's head.The impact drives both the safe and the head straight down through the floor of The Black Sun, leaving a square hole in the floor, exposing the tunnel system underneath.The rest of the dismembered body is still strewn around the floor.At this moment, a Nipponese businessman somewhere, in a nice hotel in London or an office in Tokyo or even in the first class lounge of the LATH, the Los Angeles/Tokyo Hypersonic, is sitting in front of his computer, red faced and sweating, looking at The Black Sun Hall of Fame.He has been cut off from contact with The Black Sun itself, disconnected as it were from the Metaverse, and is just seeing a two dimensional display.The top ten swordsmen of all time are shown along with their photographs.Beneath is a scrolling list of numbers and names, starting with #11.He can scroll down the list if he wants to find his own ranking.The screen helpfully informs him that he is currently ranked number 863 out of 890 people who have ever participated in a sword fight in The Black Sun.Number One, the name and the photograph on the top of the list, belongs to Hiroaki Protagonist.12  Ng Security Industries Semi Autonomous Guard Unit #A 367 lives in a pleasant black and white Metaverse where porterhouse steaks grow on trees, dangling at head level from low branches, and blood drenched Frisbees fly through the crisp, cool air for no reason at all, until you catch them.He has a little yard all to himself.It has a fence around it.He knows he can't jump over the fence.He's never actually tried to jump it, because he knows he can't.He doesn't go into the yard unless he has to.It's hot out there.He has an important job: Protect the yard.Sometimes people come in and out of the yard.Most of the time, they are good people, and he doesn't bother them.He doesn't know why they are good people.He just knows it.Sometimes they are bad people, and he has to do bad things to them to make them go away.This is fitting and proper.Out in the world beyond his yard, there are other yards with other doggies just like him.These aren't nasty dogs.They are all his friends.The closest neighbor doggie is far away, farther than he can see.But he can hear this doggie bark sometimes, when a bad person approaches his yard.He can hear other neighbor doggies, too, a whole pack of them stretching off into the distance, in all directions.He belongs to a big pack of nice doggies.He and the other nice doggies bark whenever a stranger comes into their yard, or even near it.The stranger doesn't hear him, but all the other doggies in the pack do.If they live nearby, they get excited.They wake up and get ready to do bad things to that stranger if he should try to come into their yard.When a neighbor doggie barks at a stranger, pictures and sounds and smells come into his mind along with the bark.He suddenly knows what that stranger looks like.What he smells like.How he sounds.Then, if that stranger should come anywhere near his yard, he will recognize him.He will help spread the bark along to other nice doggies so that the entire pack can all be prepared to fight the stranger.Tonight, Semi Autonomous Guard Unit #A 367 is barking.He is not just passing some other doggie's bark to the pack.He is barking because he feels very excited about things that are happening in his yard.First, two people come in.This made him excited because they came in very fast.Their hearts are beating quickly and they are sweating and they smell scared.He looked at these two people to see if they were carrying bad things.The little one is carrying things that are a little naughty, but not really bad.The big one is carrying some pretty bad things.But he knows, somehow, that the big one is okay.He belongs in this yard.He is not a stranger; he lives here.And the little one is his guest.Still, he senses there is something exciting happening.He starts to bark.The people in the yard don't hear him barking.But all the other nice doggies in the pack, far away, hear him, and when they do, they see these two scared, nice people, smell them, and hear them.Then more people come into his yard.They are also excited; he can hear their hearts beating.Saliva floods his mouth as he smells the hot salty blood pumping through their arteries.These people are excited and angry and just a little bit scared.They don't live here; they are strangers.He doesn't like strangers very much.He looks at them and sees that they are carrying three revolvers, a .38 and two .357 magnums; that the .38 is loaded with hollow points, one of the .357s is loaded with Teflon bullets and has also been cocked; and that the pump shotgun is loaded with buckshot and already has a shell chambered, plus four more shells in its magazine.The things that the strangers are carrying are bad.Scary things.He gets excited.He gets angry.He gets a little bit scared, but he likes being scared, to him it is the same thing as being excited.Really, he has only two emotions: sleeping and adrenaline overdrive.The bad stranger with the shotgun is raising his weapon!It is an utterly terrible thing.A lot of bad, excited strangers are invading his yard with evil things, come to hurt the nice visitors.He barely has time to bark out a warning to the other nice doggies before he launches himself from his doghouse, propelled on a white hot jet of pure, feral emotion.In Y. T.'s peripheral vision she sees a brief flash, hears a clunking noise.She looks over in that direction to see that the source of the light is a sort of doggie door built into the side of the Hong Kong franchise.The doggie door has in the very recent past been slammed open by something coming from the inside, headed for the lawngrid with the speed and determination of a howitzer shell.As all of this registers on Y. T.'s mind, she begins to hear the shouting of the jeeks.This shouting is not angry and not scared either.No one has had time to get scared yet.It is the shouting of someone who has just had a bucket of ice water dumped over his head.This shouting is still getting underway, she is still turning her head to look at the jeeks, when the doggie door emits another burst of light.Her eyes flick that a way; she thinks that she saw something, a long round shadow cross sectioned in the light for a blurry instant as the door was being slammed inward.But when her eyes focus on it, she sees nothing except the oscillating door, same as before.These are the only impressions left on her mind, except for one more detail: a train of sparks that danced across the lawngrid from the doggie door to the jeeks and back again during this one second event, like a skyrocket glancing across the lot.People say that the Rat Thing runs on four legs.Perhaps the claws on its robot legs made those sparks as they were digging into the lawngrid for traction.The jeeks are all in motion.Some of them have just been body slammed into the lawngrid and are still bouncing and rolling.Others are still in mid collapse.They are unarmed.They are reaching to grip their gun hands with the opposite hands, still hollering, though now their voices are tinged with a certain amount of fear.One of them has had his trousers torn from the waistband all the way down to the ankle, and a strip of fabric is trailing out across the lot, as though he had his pocket picked by something that was in too much of a hurry to let go of the actual pocket before it left.Maybe this guy had a knife in his pocket.There is no blood anywhere.The Rat Thing is precise.Still they hold their hands and holler.Maybe it's true what they say, that the Rat Thing gives you an electrical shock when it wants you to let go of something.Look out, she hears herself saying, they got guns.Hiro turns and grins at her.His teeth are very white and straight; he has a sharp grin, a carnivore's grin.No, they don't.Guns are illegal in Hong Kong, remember?They had guns just a second ago, Y. T.  says, bulging her eyes and shaking her head.The Rat Thing has them now, Hiro says.The jeeks all decide they better leave.They run out and get into their taxis and take off, tires asqueal.Y. T.  backs the taxi on its rims out over the STD and into the street, where she grindingly parallel parks it.She goes back into the Hong Kong franchise, a nebula of aromatic freshness trailing behind her like the tail of a comet.She is thinking, oddly enough, about what it would be like to climb into the back of the car with Hiro Protagonist for a while.Pretty nice, probably.But she'd have to take out the dentata, and this isn't the place.Besides, anyone decent enough to come help her escape from The Clink probably has some kind of scruples about boffing fifteen year old girls.That was nice of you, he says, nodding at the parked taxi.Are you going to pay for his tires, too?No.Are you?I'm having some cash flow problems.She stands there in the middle of the Hong Kong lawngrid.They look each other up and down, carefully.I called my boyfriend.But he flaked out on me, she says.Another thrasher?The same.You made the same mistake I made once, he says.What's that?Mixing business with pleasure.Going out with a colleague.It gets very confusing.Yeah.I see what you mean.She's not exactly sure what a colleague is.I was thinking that we should be partners, she says.She's expecting him to laugh at her.But instead he grins and nods his head slightly.The same thing occurred to me.But I'd have to think about how it would work.She is astounded that he would actually be thinking this.Then she gets the sap factor under control and realizes: He's waffling.Which means he's probably lying.This is probably going to end with him trying to get her into bed.I gotta go, she says.Gotta get home.Now we'll see how fast he loses interest in the partnership concept.She turns her back on him.Suddenly, they are impaled on Hong Kong robot spotlights one more time.Y. T.  feels a sharp bruising pain in her ribs, as though someone punched her.But it wasn't Hiro.He is an unpredictable freak who carries swords, but she can smell chick punchers a mile off.Ow!she says, twisting away from the impact.She looks down to see a small heavy object bouncing on the ground at their feet.Out in the street, an ancient taxi squeals its tires, getting the hell out of there.A jeek is hanging out the rear window, shaking his fist at them.He must have thrown a rock at her.Except it's not a rock.The heavy thing at her feet, the thing that just bounced off of Y. T.'s ribcage, is a hand grenade.She stares for a second, recognizing it, a well known cartoon icon made real.Then her feet get knocked out from under her, too fast really to hurt.And just when she's getting reoriented to that, there is a painfully loud bang from another part of the parking lot.And then everything finally stops long enough to be seen and understood.The Rat Thing has stopped.Which they never do.It's part of their mystery that you never get to see them, they move so fast.No one knows what they look like.No one except for Y. T.  and Hiro, now.It's bigger than she imagined.The body is Rottweiler sized, segmented into overlapping hard plates like those of a rhinoceros.The legs are long, curled way up to deliver power, like a cheetah's.It must be the tail that makes people refer to it as a Rat Thing, because that's the only ratlike partincredibly long and flexible.But it looks like a rat's tail with the flesh eaten away by acid, because it just consists of segments, hundreds of them neatly plugged together, like vertebrae.Jesus H.  Christ!Hiro says.And she knows, from that, that he's never seen one either.Right now, the tail is coiled and piled around on top of the Rat Thing's body like a rope that has fallen out of a tree.Parts of it are trying to move, other parts of it look dead and inert.The legs are moving one by one, spasmodically, not acting in concert.The whole thing just looks terribly wrong, like footage of an airplane that has had its tail blown off, trying to maneuver for a landing.Even someone who is not an engineer can see that it has gone all perverse and twisted.The tail writhes and lashes like a snake, uncoils itself, rises up off the Rat Thing's body, gets out of the way of its legs.But still the legs have problems; it can't get itself up.Y. T. , Hiro is saying, don't.She does.One footstep at a time, she approaches the Rat Thing.It's dangerous, in case you hadn't noticed, Hiro says, following her a few paces behind.They say it has biological components.Biological components?Animal parts.So it might be unpredictable.She likes animals.She keeps walking.She's seeing it better now.It's not all armor and muscle.A lot of it actually looks kind of flimsy.It has short stubby winglike things projecting from its body: A big one from each shoulder and a row of smaller ones down the length of its spine, like on a stegosaurus.Her Knight Visions tell her that these things are hot enough to bake pizzas on.As she approaches, they seem to unfold and grow.They are blooming like flowers in an educational film, spreading and unfolding to reveal a fine complicated internal structure that has been all collapsed together inside.Each stubby wing splits off into little miniature copies of itself, and each of those in turn splits off into more smaller copies and so on forever.The smallest ones are just tiny bits of foil, so small that, from a distance, the edges look fuzzy.It is continuing to get hotter.The little wings are almost red hot now.Y. T.  slides her goggles up onto her forehead and cups her hands around her face to block out the surrounding lights, and sure enough she can see them beginning to make a dull brownish glow, like an electric stove element that has just been turned on.The grass underneath the Rat Thing is beginning to smoke.Careful.Supposedly they have really nasty isotopes inside, Hiro says behind her.He has come up a little closer now, but he's still hanging way back.What's an isotope?A radioactive substance that makes heat.That's its energy source.How do you turn it off?You don't.It keeps making heat until it melts.Y. T.  is only a few feet away from the Rat Thing now, and she can feel the heat on her cheeks.The wings have unfolded as far as they can go.At their roots they are a bright yellow orange, fading out through red and brown to their delicate edges, which are still dark.The acrid smoke of the burning grass obscures some of the details.She thinks: The edges of the wings look like something I've seen before.They look like the thin metal vanes that run up the outside of a window air conditioner, the ones that you can write your name in by mashing them down with your finger.Or like the radiator on a car.The fan blows air over the radiator to cool off the engine.It's got radiators, she says.The Rat Thing has got radiators to cool off.She's gathering intel right at this very moment.But it's not cooling off.It's just getting hotter.Y. T.  surfs through traffic jams for a living.That's her economic niche: beating the traffic.And she knows that a car doesn't boil over when it is speeding down an open freeway.It boils over when it is stopped in traffic.Because when it sits still, not enough air is being blown over the radiator.That's what's happening to the Rat Thing right now.It has to keep moving, keep forcing air over its radiators, or else it overheats and melts down.Cool, she says.I wonder if it's going to blow up or what.The body converges to a sharp nose.In the front it bends down sharply, and there is a black glass canopy, raked sharply like the windshield of a fighter plane.If the Rat Thing has eyes, this is where it looks out.Under that, where the jaw should be are the remains of some kind of mechanical stuff that has been mostly blown off by the explosion of the grenade.The black glass windshieldor facemask, or whatever you call ithas a hole blown through it.Big enough that Y. T.  could put her hand through.On the other side of that hole, it's dark and she can't see much, especially so close to the bright orange glare coming from the radiators.But she can see that red stuff is coming out from inside.And it ain't no Dexron II.The Rat Thing is hurt and it's bleeding.This thing is real, she says.It's got blood in its veins.She's thinking: This is intel.This is intel.I can make money off this with my pardnermy podHiro.Then she thinks: The poor thing is burning itself alive.Don't do it.Don't touch it, Y. T. , Hiro says.She steps right up to it, flips her goggles down to protect her face from the heat.The Rat Thing's legs stop their spasmodic movements, as though waiting for her.She bends down and grabs its front legs.They react, tightening their pushrod muscles against the pull of her hands.It's exactly like grabbing a dog by the front legs and asking it to dance.This thing is alive.It reacts to her.She knows.She looks up at Hiro, just to make sure he's taking this all in.He is.Jerk!she says.I stick my neck out and say I want to be your partner, and you say you want to think about it?What's your problem, I'm not good enough to work with you?She leans back and begins dragging the Rat Thing backward across the lawngrid.It's incredibly light.No wonder it can run so fast.She could pick it up, if she felt like burning herself alive.As she drags it backward toward the doggie door, it brands a blackened, smoking trail into the lawngrid.She can see steam rising up out of her coverall, old sweat and stuff boiling out of the fabric.She's small enough to fit through the doggie dooranother thing she can do and Hiro can't.Usually these things are locked, she's tried to mess with them.But this one is opened.Inside, the franchise is bright, white, robot polished floors.A few feet from the doggie door is what looks like a black washing machine.This is the Rat Thing's hutch, where it lurks in darkness and privacy, waiting for a job to do.It is wired into the franchise by a thick cable coming out of the wall.Right now, the hutch's door is hanging open, which is another thing she's never seen before.And steam is rolling out from inside of it.Not steam.Cold stuff.Like when you open your freezer door on a humid day.She pushes the Rat Thing into its hutch.Some kind of cold liquid sprays out of all the walls and bursts into steam before it even reaches the Rat Thing's body, and the steam comes blasting out the front of the hutch so powerfully that it knocks her on her ass.The long tail is strung out the front of the hutch, across the floor, and out through the doggie door.She picks up part of it, the sharp machine tooled edges of its vertebrae pinching her gloves.Suddenly it tenses, comes alive, vibrates for a second.She jerks her hands back.The tail shoots back inside the hutch like a rubber band snapping.She can't even see it move.Then the hutch door slams shut.A janitor robot, a Hoover with a brain, hums out of another doorway to clean the long streaks of blood off the floor.Above her, hanging on the foyer wall facing the main entrance, is a framed poster with a garland of well browned jasmine blossoms hung around it.It consists of a photo of the wildly grinning Mr.Lee, with the usual statement underneath:    WELCOME!It is my pleasure to

Autonomous Guard Unit #A 367 is howling.Outside in the yard, it was very hot and he felt bad.Whenever he is out in the yard, he gets hot unless he keeps running.When he got hurt and had to lie down for a long time, he felt hotter than he had ever been before.Now he doesn't feel hot anymore.But he is still hurt.He is howling his injured howl.He is telling all the neighbor doggies that he needs help.They feel sad and upset and repeat his howl and pass it along to all the rest of the doggies.Soon he hears the vet's car approaching.The nice vet will come and make him feel better.He starts barking again.He is telling all the other doggies about how the bad strangers came and hurt him.And how hot it was out in the yard when he had to lie down.And how the nice girl helped him and took him back to his cool house.Right in front of the Hong Kong franchise, Y. T.  notices a black Town Car that has been sitting there for a while.She doesn't have to see the plates to know it's Mafia.Only the Mafia drives cars like that.The windows are blackened, but she knows someone's in there keeping an eye on her.How do they do it?You see these Town Cars everywhere, but you never see them move, never see them get anyplace.She's not even sure they have engines in them.Okay.Sorry, Hiro says.I keep my own thing going, but we have a partnership for any intel you can dig up.Fifty fifty split.Deal, she says, climbing onto her plank.Call me anytime.You have my card.Hey, that reminds me.Your card said you're into the three Ms of software.Yeah.Music, movies, and microcode.You heard of Vitaly Chernobyl and the Meltdowns?No.Is that a band?Yeah.It's the greatest band.You should check it out, homeboy, it's going to be the next big thing.She coasts out onto the road and poons an Audi with Blooming Greens license plates.It ought to take her home.Mom's probably in bed, pretending to sleep, being worried.Half a block from the entrance to Blooming Greens, she unpoons the Audi and coasts into a McDonald's.She goes into the ladies'.It has a hung ceiling.She stands on the seat of the third toilet, pushes up one of the ceiling tiles, moves it aside.A cotton sleeve tumbles out, bearing a delicate floral print.She pulls on it and hauls down the whole ensemble, the blouse, the pleated skirt, underwear from Vicky's, the leather shoes, the necklace and earrings, even a fucking purse.She takes off her RadiKS coverall, wads it up, sticks it into the ceiling, replaces the loose tile.Then she puts on the ensemble.Now she looks just like she did when she had breakfast with Mom this morning.She carries her plank down the street to Blooming Greens, where it's legal to carry them but not to put them on the 'crete.She flashes her passport at the border post, walks a quarter of a mile down crisp new sidewalks, and up to the house where the porch light is on.Mom's sitting in the den, in front of her computer, as usual.
