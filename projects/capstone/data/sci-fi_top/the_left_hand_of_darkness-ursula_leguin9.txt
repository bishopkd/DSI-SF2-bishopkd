As he did so he murmured a short and charming grace of invocation, the only ritual words I had ever learned of the Handdara: "Praise then darkness and Creation unfinished," he said, and there was darkness.We slept.In the morning it was all to do over.We did it over for fifty days.Estraven kept up his journal, though during the weeks on the Ice he seldom wrote more than a note of the weather and the distance we had come that day.Among these notes there is occasional mention of his own thoughts or of some of our conversation, but not a word concerning the profounder conversation between us which occupied our rest between dinner and sleep on many nights of the first month on the Ice, while we still had enough energy to talk, and on certain days that we spent storm bound in the tent.I told him that I was not forbidden, but not expected, to use paraverbal speech on a non Ally planet, and asked him to keep what he learned from his own people, at least until I could discuss what I had done with my colleagues on the ship.He assented, and kept his word.He never said or wrote anything concerning our silent conversations.Mindspeech was the only thing I had to give Estraven, out of all my civilization, my alien reality in which he was so profoundly interested.I could talk and describe endlessly; but that was all I had to give.Indeed it may be the only important thing we have to give to Winter.But I can't say that gratitude was my motive for infringing on the Law of Cultural Embargo.I was not paying my debt to him.Such debts remain owing.Estraven and I had simply arrived at the point where we shared whatever we had that was worth sharing.I expect it will turn out that sexual intercourse is possible between Gethenian double sexed and Hainish norm one sexed human beings, though such intercourse will inevitably be sterile.It remains to be proved; Estraven and I proved nothing except perhaps a rather subtler point.The nearest to crisis that our sexual desires brought us was on a night early in the journey, our second night up on the Ice.We had spent all day struggling and back tracking in the cut up, crevassed area east of the Fire Hills.We were tired that evening but elated, sure that a clear course would soon open out ahead.But after dinner Estraven grew taciturn, and cut my talk off short.I said at last after a direct rebuff, "Harth, I've said something wrong again, please tell me what it is. "He was silent."I've made some mistake in shifgrethor.I'm sorry; I can't learn.I've never even really understood the meaning of the word. ""Shifgrethor?It comes from an old word forshadow . "We were both silent for a little, and then he looked at me with a direct, gentle gaze.His face in the reddish light was as soft, as vulnerable, as remote as the face of a woman who looks at you out of her thoughts and does not speak.And I saw then again, and for good, what I had always been afraid to see, and had pretended not to see in him: that he was a woman as well as a man.Any need to explain the sources of that fear vanished with the fear; what I was left with was, at last, acceptance of him as he was.Until then I had rejected him, refused him his own reality.He had been quite right to say that he, the only person on Gethen who trusted me, was the only Gethenian I distrusted.For he was the only one who had entirely accepted me as a human being: who had liked me personally and given me entire personal loyalty: and who therefore had demanded of me an equal degree of recognition, of acceptance.I had not been willing to give it.I had been afraid to give it.I had not wanted to give my trust, my friendship to a man who was a woman, a woman who was a man.He explained, stiffly and simply, that he was in kemmer and had been trying to avoid me, insofar as one of us could avoid the other."I must not touch you," he said, with extreme constraint; saying that he looked away.I said, "I understand.I agree completely. "For it seemed to me, and I think to him, that it was from that sexual tension between us, admitted now and understood, but not assuaged, that the great and sudden assurance of friendship between us rose: a friendship so much needed by us both in our exile, and already so well proved in the days and nights of our bitter journey, that it might as well be called, now as later, love.But it was from the difference between us, not from the affinities and likenesses, but from the difference, that that love came: and it was itself the bridge, the only bridge, across what divided us.For us to meet sexually would be for us to meet once more as aliens.We had touched, in the only way we could touch.We left it at that.I do not know if we were right.We talked some more that night, and I recall being very hard put to it to answer coherently when he asked me what women were like.We were both rather stiff and cautious with each other for the next couple of days.A profound love between two people involves, after all, the power and chance of doing profound hurt.It would never have occurred to me before that night that I could hurt Estraven.Now that the barriers were down, the limitation, in my terms, of our converse and understanding seemed intolerable to me.Quite soon, two or three nights later, I said to my companion as we finished our dinner a special treat, sugared kadik porridge, to celebrate a twenty mile run "Last spring, that night in the Corner Red Dwelling, you said you wished I'd tell you more about paraverbal speech. ""Yes, I did. ""Do you want to see if I can teach you how to speak it?"He laughed."You want to catch me lying. ""If you ever lied to me, it was long ago, and in another country. "He was an honest person, but rarely a direct one.That tickled him, and he said, "In another country I may tell you other lies.But I thought you were forbidden to teach your mind science to...the natives, until we join the Ekumen. ""Not forbidden.It's not done.I'll do it, though, if you like.And if I can.I'm no Educer. ""There are special teachers of the skill?""Yes.Not on Alterra, where there's a high occurrence of natural sensitivity, and they say mothers mindspeak to their unborn babies.I don't know what the babies answer.But most of us have to be taught, as if it were a foreign language.Or rather as if it were our native language, but learned very late. "I think he understood my motive in offering to teach him the skill, and he wanted very much to learn it.We had a go at it.I recalled what I could of how I had been educed, at age twelve.I told him to clear his mind, let it be dark.This he did, no doubt, more promptly and thoroughly than I ever had done: he was an adept of the Handdara, after all.Then I mindspoke to him as clearly as I could.No result.We tried it again.Since one cannot bespeak until one has been bespoken, until the telepathic potentiality has been sensitized by one clear reception, I had to get through to him first.I tried for half an hour, till I felt hoarse of brain.He looked crestfallen."I thought it would be easy for me," he confessed.We were both tired out, and called the attempt off for the night.Our next efforts were no more successful.I tried sending to Estraven while he slept, recalling what my Educer had told me about the occurrence of "dream messages" among pre telepathic peoples, but it did not work."Perhaps my species lacks the capacity," he said."We have enough rumors and hints to have made up a word for the power, but I don't know of any proven instances of telepathy among us. ""So it was with my people for thousands of years.A few natural Sensitives, not comprehending their gift, and lacking anyone to receive from or send to.All the rest latent, if that.You know I told you that except in the case of the born Sensitive, the capacity, though it has a physiological basis, is a psychological one, a product of culture, a side effect of the use of the mind.Young children, and defectives, and members of un evolved or regressed societies, can't mindspeak.The mind must exist on a certain plane of complexity first.You can't build up amino acids out of hydrogen atoms; a good deal of complexifying has to take place first: the same situation.Abstract thought, varied social interaction, intricate cultural adjustments, esthetic and ethical perception, all of it has to reach a certain level before the connections can be made before the potentiality can be touched at all. ""Perhaps we Gethenians haven't attained that level. ""You're far beyond it.But luck is involved.As in the creation of amino acids...Or to take analogies on the cultural plane only analogies, but they illuminate the scientific method, for instance, the use of concrete, experimental techniques in science.There are peoples of the Ekumen who possess a high culture, a complex society, philosophies, arts, ethics, a high style and a great achievement in all those fields; and yet they have never learned to weigh a stone accurately.They can learn how, of course.Only for half a million years they never did...There are peoples who have no higher mathematics at all, nothing beyond the simplest applied arithmetic.Every one of them is capable of understanding the calculus, but not one of them does or ever has.As a matter of fact, my own people, the Terrans, were ignorant until about three thousand years ago of the uses of zero. "That made Estraven blink."As for Gethen, what I'm curious about is whether the rest of us may find ourselves to have the capacity for Foretelling whether this too is a part of the evolution of the mind if you'll teach us the techniques. ""You think it a useful accomplishment?""Accurate prophecy?Well, of course! ""You might have to come to believe that it's a useless one, in order to practice it. ""Your Handdara fascinates me, Harth, but now and then I wonder if it isn't simply paradox developed into a way of life...  "We tried mindspeech again.I had never before sent repeatedly to a total non receiver.The experience was disagreeable.I began to feel like an atheist praying.Presently Estraven yawned and said, "I am deaf, deaf as a rock.We'd better sleep. "I assented.He turned out the light, murmuring his brief praise of darkness; we burrowed down into our bags, and within a minute or two he was sliding into sleep as a swimmer slides into dark water.I felt his sleep as if it were my own: the empathic bond was there, and once more I bespoke him, sleepily, by his name "Therem!"He sat bolt upright, for his voice rang out above me in the blackness, loud."Arek!is that you?""No: Genly Ai: I am bespeaking you. "His breath caught.Silence.He fumbled with the Chabe stove, turned up the light, stared at me with his dark eyes full of fear."I dreamed," he said, "I thought I was at home "  "You heard me mindspeak. ""You called me  It was my brother.It was his voice I heard.He's dead.You called me you called me Therem?I. ..This is more terrible than I had thought. "He shook his head, as a man will do to shake off nightmare, and then put his face in his hands."Harth, I'm very sorry "  "No, call me by my name.If you can speak inside my skull with a dead man's voice then you can call me by my name!Wouldhe have called me 'Harth'?Oh, I see why there's no lying in this mindspeech.It is a terrible thing...All right.All right, speak to me again. ""Wait. ""No.Go on. "With his fierce, frightened gaze on me I bespoke him: "Therem, my friend, there's nothing to fear between us. "He kept on staring at me, so that I thought he had not understood; but he had."Ah, but there is," he said.After a while, controlling himself, he said calmly, "You spoke in my language. ""Well, you don't know mine. ""You said there would be words, I know...Yet I imagined it as an understanding "  "Empathy's another game, though not unconnected.It gave us the connection tonight.But in mindspeech proper, the speech centers of the brain are activated, as well as "  "No, no, no.Tell me that later.Why do you speak in my brother's voice?"His voice was strained."That I can't answer.I don't know.Tell me about him. ""Nusuth...My full brother, Arek Harth rem ir Es traven.He was a year older than I.  He would have been Lord of Estre.We...I left home, you know, for his sake.He has been dead fourteen years. "We were both silent for some time.I could not know, or ask, what lay behind his words: it had cost him too much to say the little he had said.I said at last, "Bespeak me, Therem.Call me by my name. "I knew he could: the rapport was there, or as the experts have it, the phases were consonant, and of course he had as yet no idea of how to raise the barrier voluntarily.Had I been a Listener, I could have heard him think."No," he said."Never.Not yet... "But no amount of shock, awe, terror could restrain that insatiable, outreaching mind for long.After he had cut out the light again I suddenly heard his stammer in my inward hearing "Genry " Even mindspeaking he never could say "l" properly.I replied at once.In the dark he made an inarticulate sound of fear that had in it a slight edge of satisfaction."No more, no more," he said aloud.After a while we got to sleep at last.It never came easy to him.Not that he lacked the gift or could not develop the skill, but it disturbed him profoundly, and he could not take it for granted.He quickly learned to set up the barriers, but I'm not sure he felt he could count on them.Perhaps all of us were so, when the first Educers came back centuries ago from Rokanon's World teaching the "Last Art" to us.Perhaps a Gethenian, being singularly complete, feels telepathic speech as a violation of completeness, a breach of integrity hard for him to tolerate.Perhaps it was Estraven's own character, in which candor and reserve were both strong: every word he said rose out of a deeper silence.He heard my voice bespeaking him as a dead man's, his brother's voice.I did not know what, besides love and death, lay between him and that brother, but I knew that whenever I bespoke him something in him winced away as if I touched a wound.So that intimacy of mind established between us was a bond, indeed, but an obscure and austere one, not so much admitting further light (as I had expected it to) as showing the extent of the darkness.And day after day we crept on eastward over the plain of ice.The midpoint in time of our journey as planned, the thirty fifth day, Odorny Anner, found us far short of our halfway point in space.By the sledge meter we had indeed traveled about four hundred miles, but probably only three quarters of that was real forward gain, and we could estimate only very roughly how far still remained to go.We had spent days, miles, rations in our long struggle to get up onto the Ice.Estraven was not so worried as I by the hundreds of miles that still lay ahead of us."The sledge is lighter," he said."Towards the end it will be still lighter; and we can cut rations, if necessary.We have been eating very well, you know. "I thought he was being ironic, but I should have known better.On the fortieth day and the two succeeding we were snowed in by a blizzard.During these long hours of lying blotto in the tent Estraven slept almost continuously, and ate nothing, though he drank orsh or sugar water at mealtimes.He insisted that I eat, though only half rations."You have no experience in starvation," he said.I was humiliated."How much have you Lord of a Domain, and Prime Minister ?""Genry, we practice privation until we're experts at it.I was taught how to starve as a child at home in Estre, and by the Handdarata in Rotherer Fastness.I got out of practice in Erhenrang, true enough, but I began making up for it in Mishnory...Please do as I say, my friend; I know what I'm doing. "He did, and I did.We went on for four more days of very bitter cold, never above 25, and then came another blizzard whooping up in our faces from the east on a gale wind.Within two minutes of the first strong gusts the snow blew so thick that I could not see Estraven six feet away.I had turned my back on him and the sledge and the plastering, blinding, suffocating snow in order to get my breath, and when a minute later I turned around he was gone.The sledge was gone.Nothing was there.I took a few steps to where they had been and felt about.I shouted, and could not hear my own voice.I was deaf and alone in a universe filled solid with small stinging gray streaks.I panicked and began to blunder forward, mindcalling frantically, "Therem!"Right under my hand, kneeling, he said, "Come on, give me a hand with the tent. "I did so, and never mentioned my minute of panic.No need to.This blizzard lasted two days; there were five days lost, and there would be more.Nimmer and Anner are the months of the great storms."We're beginning to cut it rather fine, aren't we," I said one night as I measured out our gichy michy ration and put it to soak in hot water.He looked at me.His firm, broad face showed weight loss in deep shadows under the cheekbones, his eyes were sunken and his mouth sorely chapped and cracked.God knows what I looked like, when he looked like that.He smiled."With luck we shall make it, and without luck we shall not. "It was what he had said from the start.With all my anxieties, my sense of taking a last desperate gamble, and so on, I had not been realistic enough to believe him.Even now I thought, Surely when we've worked so hard   But the Ice did not know how hard we worked.Why should it?Proportion is kept."How is your luck running, Therem?"I said at last.He did not smile at that.Nor did he answer.Only after a while he said, "I've been thinking about them all, down there."Down there, for us, had come to mean the south, the world below the plateau of ice, the region of earth, men, roads, cities, all of which had become hard to imagine as really existing."You know that I sent word to the king concerning you, the day I left Mishnory.I told him what Shusgis told me, that you were going to be sent to Pulefen Farm.At the time I wasn't clear as to my intent, but merely followed my impulse.I have thought the impulse through, since.Something like this may happen: The king will see a chance to play shifgrethor.Tibe will advise against it, but Argaven should be growing a little tired of Tibe by now, and may ignore his counsel.He will inquire.Where is the Envoy, the guest of Karhide?Mishnory will lie.He died of horm fever this autumn, most lamentable.Then how does it happen that we are informed by our own Embassy that he's in Pulefen Farm?He's not there, look for yourselves.No, no, of course not, we accept the word of the Commensals of Orgoreyn...But a few weeks after these exchanges, the Envoy appears in North Karhide, having escaped from Pulefen Farm.Consternation in Mishnory, indignation in Erhenrang.Loss of face for the Commensals, caught lying.You will be a treasure, a long lost hearth brother, to King Argaven, Genry.For a while.You must send for your Star Ship at once, at the first chance you get.Bring your people to Karhide and accomplish your mission, at once, before Argaven has had time to see the possible enemy in you, before Tibe or some other councillor frightens him once more, playing on his madness.If he makes the bargain with you, he will keep it.To break it would be to break his own shifgrethor.The Harge kings keep their promises.But you must act fast, and bring the Ship down soon. ""I will, if I receive the slightest sign of welcome. ""No: forgive my advising you, but you must not wait for welcome.You will be welcomed, I think.So will the Ship.Karhide has been sorely humbled this past half year.You will give Argaven the chance to turn the tables.I think he will take the chance. ""Very well.But you, meanwhile "  "I am Estraven the Traitor.I have nothing whatever to do with you. ""At first. ""At first," he agreed."You'll be able to hide out, if there is danger at first?""Oh yes, certainly. "Our food was ready, and we fell to.Eating was so important and engrossing a business that we never talked any more while we ate; the taboo was now in its complete, perhaps its original form, not a word said till the last crumb was gone.When it was, he said, "Well, I hope I've guessed  well.You will...you do forgive... ""Your giving me direct advice?"I said, for there were certain things I had finally come to understand."Of course I do, Therem.Really, how can you doubt it?You know I have no shifgrethor to waive. "That amused him, but he was still brooding."Why," he said at last, "why did you come alone why were you sent alone?Everything, still, will depend upon that ship coming.Why was it made so difficult for you, and for us?""It's the Ekumen's custom, and there are reasons for it.Though in fact I begin to wonder if I've ever understood the reasons.I thought it was for your sake that I came alone, so obviously alone, so vulnerable, that I could in myself pose no threat, change no balance: not an invasion, but a mere messenger boy.But there's more to it than that.Alone, I cannot change your world.But I can be changed by it.Alone, I must listen, as well as speak.Alone, the relationship I finally make, if I make one, is not impersonal and not only political: it is individual, it is personal, it is both more and less than political.Not We and They; not I and It; but I and Thou.Not political, not pragmatic, but mystical.In a certain sense the Ekumen is not a body politic, but a body mystic.It considers beginnings to be extremely important.Beginnings, and means.Its doctrine is just the reverse of the doctrine that the end justifies the means.It proceeds, therefore, by subtle ways, and slow ones, and queer, risky ones; rather as evolution does, which is in certain senses its model...So I was sent alone, for your sake?Or for my own?I don't know.Yes, it has made things difficult.But I might ask you as profitably why you've never seen fit to invent airborne vehicles?One small stolen airplane would have spared you and me a great deal of difficulty!""How would it ever occur to a sane man that he could fly?"Estraven said sternly.It was a fair response, on a world where no living thing is winged, and the very angels of the Yomesh Hierarchy of the Holy do not fly but only drift, wingless, down to earth like a soft snow falling, like the windborne seeds of that flowerless world.Towards the middle of Nimmer, after much wind and bitter cold, we came into a quiet weather for many days.If there was storm it was far south of us,down there, and we inside the blizzard had only an all but windless overcast.At first the overcast was thin, so that the air was vaguely radiant with an even, sourceless sunlight reflected from both clouds and snow, from above and below.Overnight the weather thickened somewhat.All brightness was gone, leaving nothing.We stepped out of the tent onto nothing.Sledge and tent were there, Estraven stood beside me, but neither he nor I cast any shadow.There was dull light all around, everywhere.When we walked on the crisp snow no shadow showed the footprint.We left no track.Sledge, tent, himself, myself: nothing else at all.No sun, no sky, no horizon, no world.A whitish gray void, in which we appeared to hang.The illusion was so complete that I had trouble keeping my balance.My inner ears were used to confirmation from my eyes as to how I stood; they got none; I might as well be blind.It was all right while we loaded up, but hauling, with nothing ahead, nothing to look at, nothing for the eye to touch, as it were, it was at first disagreeable and then exhausting.We were on skis, on a good surface of firn, without sastrugi, and solid that was certain for five or six thousand feet down.We should have been making good time.But we kept slowing down, groping our way across the totally unobstructed plain, and it took a strong effort of will to speed up to a normal pace.Every slight variation in the surface came as a jolt as in climbing stairs, the unexpected stair or the expected but absent stair for we could not see it ahead: there was no shadow to show it.We skied blind with our eyes open.Day after day was like this, and we began to shorten our hauls, for by mid afternoon both of us would be sweating and shaking with strain and fatigue.I came to long for snow, for blizzard, for anything; but morning after morning we came out of the tent into the void, the white weather, what Estraven called the Un shadow.One day about noon, Odorny Nimmer, the sixty first day of the journey, that bland blind nothingness about us began to flow and writhe.I thought my eyes were fooling me, as they had been doing often, and paid scant attention to the dim meaningless commotion of the air until, suddenly, I caught a glimpse of a small, wan, dead sun overhead.And looking down from the sun, straight ahead, I saw a huge black shape come hulking out of the void towards us.Black tentacles writhed upwards, groping out.I stopped dead in my tracks, slewing Estraven around on his skis, for we were both in harness hauling."What is it?"He stared at the dark monstrous forms hidden in the fog, and said at last, "The crags...It must be Esherhoth Crags. "And pulled on.We were miles from the things, which I had taken to be almost within arm's reach.As the white weather turned to a thick low mist and then cleared off, we saw them plainly before sunset: nunataks, great scored and ravaged pinnacles of rock jutting up out of the ice, no more of them showing than shows of an iceberg above the sea: cold drowned mountains, dead for eons.They showed us to be somewhat north of our shortest course, if we could trust the ill drawn map that was all we had.The next day we turned for the first time a little south of east.19.Homecoming  IN A DARKwindy weather we slogged along, trying to find encouragement in the sighting of Esherhoth Crags, the first thing not ice or snow or sky that we had seen for seven weeks.On the map they were marked as not far from the Shenshey Bogs to the south, and from Guthen Bay to the east.But it was not a trustworthy map of the Gobrin area.And we were getting very tired.We were nearer the southern edge of the Gobrin Glacier than the map indicated, for we began to meet pressure ice and crevasses on the second day of our turn southward.The Ice was not so upheaved and tormented as in the Fire Hills region, but it was rotten.There were sunken pits acres across, probably lakes in summer; false floors of snow that might subside with a huge gasp all around you into the air pocket a foot deep beneath; areas all slit and pocked with little holes and crevasses; and, more and more often, there were big crevasses, old canyons in the Ice, some wide as mountain gorges and others only two or three feet across, but deep.On Odyrny Nimmer (by Estraven's journal, for I kept none) the sun shone clear with a strong north wind.As we ran the sledge across the snow bridges over narrow crevasses we could look down to left or right into blue shafts and abysses in which bits of ice dislodged by the runners fell with a vast, faint, delicate music, as if silver wires touched thin crystal planes, falling.I remember the racy, dreamy, light headed pleasure of that morning's haul in the sunlight over the abysses.But the sky began to whiten, the air to grow thick; shadows faded, blue drained out of the sky and snow.We were not alert to the danger of white weather on such a surface.As the ice was heavily corrugated, I was pushing while Estraven pulled; I had my eyes on the sledge and was shoving away, mind on nothing but how best to shove, when all at once the bar was nearly wrenched out of my grip as the sledge shot forward in a sudden lunge.I held on by instinct and shouted "Hey!"to Estraven to slow him down, thinking he had speeded up on a smooth patch.But the sledge stopped dead, tilted nose down, and Estraven was not there.I almost let go the sledge bar to go look for him.It was pure luck that I did not.I held on, while I stared stupidly about for him, and so I saw the lip of the crevasse, made visible by the shifting and dropping of another section of the broken snow bridge.He had gone right down feet first, and nothing kept the sledge from following him but my weight, which held the rear third of the runners still on solid ice.It kept tipping a little farther nose downward, pulled by his weight as he hung in harness in the pit.I brought my weight down on the rear bar and pulled and rocked and levered the sledge back away from the edge of the crevasse.It did not come easy.But I threw my weight hard on the bar and tugged until it began grudgingly to move, and then slid abruptly right away from the crevasse.Estraven had got his hands onto the edge, and his weight now aided me.Scrambling, dragged by the harness, he came up over the edge and collapsed face down on the ice.I knelt by him trying to unbuckle his harness, alarmed by the way he sprawled there, passive except for the great gasping rise and fall of his chest.His lips were cyanotic, one side of his face was bruised and scraped.He sat up unsteadily and said in a whistling whisper, "Blue all blue  Towers in the depths " "What?""In the crevasse.All blue full of light. ""Are you all right?"He started rebuckling his harness."You go ahead on the rope with the stick," he gasped."Pick the route. "For hours one of us hauled while the other guided, mincing along like a cat on eggshells, sounding every step in advance with the stick.In the white weather one could not see a crevasse until one could look down into it a little late, for the edges overhung, and were not always solid.Every footfall was a surprise, a drop or a jolt.No shadows.An even, white, soundless sphere: we moved along inside a huge frosted glass ball.There was nothing inside the ball, and nothing was outside it.But there were cracks in the glass.Probe and step, probe and step.Probe for the invisible cracks through which one might fall out of the white glass ball, and fall, and fall, and fall...An unrelaxable tension little by little took hold of all my muscles.It became exceedingly difficult to take even one more step."What's up, Genry?"I stood there in the middle of nothing.Tears came out and froze my eyelids together.I said, "I'm afraid of falling. ""But you're on the rope," he said.Then, coming up and seeing that there was no crevasse anywhere visible, he saw what was up and said, "Pitch camp. ""It's not time yet, we ought to go on. "He was already unlashing the tent.Later on, after we had eaten, he said, "It was time to stop.I don't think we can go this way.The Ice seems to drop off slowly, and will be rotten and crevassed all the way.If we could see, we could make it: but not in unshadow. ""But then how do we get down onto the Shenshey Bogs?""Well, if we keep east again instead of trending south, we might be on sound ice clear to Guthen Bay.I saw the Ice once from a boat on the Bay in summer.It comes up against the Red Hills, and feeds down in ice rivers to the Bay.If we came down one of those glaciers we could run due south on the sea ice to Karhide, and so enter at the coast rather than the border, which might be better.It will add some miles to our way, though  something between twenty and fifty, I should think.What's your opinion, Genry?""My opinion is that I can't go twenty more feet so long as the white weather lasts. ""But if we get out of the crevassed area... ""Oh, if we get out of the crevasses I'll be fine.And if the sun ever comes out again, you get on the sledge and I'll give you a free ride to Karhide. "That was typical of our attempts at humor, at this stage of the journey; they were always very stupid, but sometimes they made the other fellow smile."There's nothing wrong with me," I went on, "except acute chronic fear. ""Fear's very useful.Like darkness; like shadows. "Estraven's smile was an ugly split in a peeling, cracked brown mask, thatched with black fur and set with two flecks of black rock."It's queer that daylight's not enough.We need the shadows, in order to walk. ""Give me your notebook a moment. "He had just noted down our day's journey and done some calculation of mileage and rations.He pushed the little tablet and carbon pencil around the Chabe stove to me.On the blank leaf glued to the inner back cover I drew the double curve within the circle, and blacked the yin half of the symbol, then pushed it back to my companion."Do you know that sign?"He looked at it a long time with a strange look, but he said, "No. ""It's found on Earth, and on Hain Davenant, and on Chiffewar.It is yin and yang.Light is the left hand of darkness...how did it go?Light, dark.Fear, courage.Cold, warmth.Female, male.It is yourself, Therem.Both and one.A shadow on snow. "The next day we trudged northeast through the white absence of everything until there were no longer any cracks in the floor of nothing: a day's haul.We were on 2/3 ration, hoping to keep the longer route from running us right out of food.It seemed to me that it would not matter much if it did, as the difference between little and nothing seemed a rather fine one.Estraven, however, was on the track of his luck, following what appeared to be hunch or intuition, but may have been applied experience and reasoning.We went east for four days, four of the longest hauls we had made, eighteen to twenty miles a day, and then the quiet zero weather broke and went to pieces, turning into a whirl, whirl, whirl of tiny snow particles ahead, behind, to the side, in the eyes, a storm beginning as the light died.We lay in the tent for three days while the blizzard yelled at us, a three day long, wordless, hateful yell from the unbreathing lungs."It'll drive me to screaming back," I said to Estraven in mindspeech, and he, with the hesitant formality that marked his rapport: "No use.It will not listen. "We slept hour after hour, ate a little, tended our frostbites, inflammations, and bruises, mindspoke, slept again.The three day shriek died down into a gabbling, then a sobbing, then a silence.Day broke.Through the opened door valve the sky's brightness shone.It lightened the heart, though we were too rundown to be able to show our relief in alacrity or zest of movement.We broke camp it took nearly two hours, for we crept about like two old men and set off.The way was downhill, an unmistakable slight grade; the crust was perfect for skis.The sun shone.The thermometer at midmorning showed 10.We seemed to get strength from going, and we went fast and easy.We went that day till the stars came out.For dinner Estraven served out full rations.At that rate, we had enough for only seven days more."The wheel turns," he said with serenity."To make a good run, we've got to eat. ""Eat, drink, and be merry," said I.  The food had got me high.I laughed inordinately at my own words."All one eating drinking merrymaking.Can't have merry without eats, can you?"This seemed to me a mystery quite on a par with that of the yin yang circle, but it did not last.Something in Estraven's expression dispelled it.Then I felt like crying, but refrained.Estraven was not as strong as I was, and it would not be fair, it might make him cry too.He was already asleep: he had fallen asleep sitting up, his bowl on his lap.It was not like him to be so unmethodical.But it was not a bad idea, sleep.We woke rather late next morning, had a double breakfast, and then got in harness and pulled our light sledge right off the edge of the world.Below the world's edge, which was a steep rubbly slope of white and red in a pallid noon light, lay the frozen sea: the Bay of Guthen, frozen from shore to shore and from Karhide clear to the  North Pole.To get down onto the sea ice through the broken edges and shelves and trenches of the Ice jammed up amongst the Red Hills took that afternoon and the next day.On that second day we abandoned our sledge.We made up backpacks; with the tent as the main bulk of one and the bags of the other, and our food equally distributed, we had less than twenty five pounds apiece to carry; I added the Chabe stove to my pack and still had under thirty.It was good to be released from forever pulling and pushing and hauling and prying that sledge, and I said so to Estraven as we went on.He glanced back at the sledge, a bit of refuse in the vast torment of ice and reddish rock."It did well," he said.His loyalty extended without disproportion to things, the patient, obstinate, reliable things that we use and get used to, the things we live by.He missed the sledge.That evening, the seventy fifth of our journey, our fifty first day on the plateau, Harhahad Anner, we came down off the Gobrin Ice onto the sea ice of Guthen Bay.Again we traveled long and late, till dark.The air was very cold, but clear and still, and the clean ice surface, with no sledge to pull, invited our skis.When we camped that night it was strange to think, lying down, that under us there was no longer a mile of ice, but a few feet of it, and then salt water.But we did not spend much time thinking.We ate, and slept.At dawn, again a clear day though terribly cold, below 40 at daybreak, we could look southward and see the coastline, bulged out here and there with protruding tongues of glacier, fall away southward almost in a straight line.We followed it close inshore at first.A north wind helped us along till we skied up abreast a valley mouth between two high orange hills; out of that gorge howled a gale that knocked us both off our feet.We scuttled farther east, out on the level sea plain, where we could at least stand up and keep going."The Gobrin Ice has spewed us out of its mouth," I said.The next day, the eastward curve of the coastline was plain, straight ahead of us.To our right was Orgoreyn, but that blue curve ahead was Karhide.On that day we used up the last grains of orsh, and the last few ounces of kadik germ; we had left now two pounds apiece of gichy michy, and six ounces of sugar.I cannot describe these last days of our journey very well, I find, because I cannot really remember them.Hunger can heighten perception, but not when combined with extreme fatigue; I suppose all my senses were very much deadened.I remember having hunger cramps, but I don't remember suffering from them.I had, if anything, a vague feeling all the time of liberation, of having got beyond something, of joy; also of being terribly sleepy.We reached land on the twelfth, Posthe Anner, and clambered over a frozen beach and into the rocky, snowy desolation of the Guthen Coast.We were in Karhide.We had achieved our goal.It came near being an empty achievement, for our packs were empty.We had a feast of hot water to celebrate our arrival.The next morning we got up and set off to find a road, a settlement.It is a desolate region, and we had no map of it.What roads there might be were under five or ten feet of snow, and we may have crossed several without knowing it.There was no sign of cultivation.We strayed south and west that day, and the next, and on the evening of the next, seeing a light shine on a distant hillside through the dusk and thin falling snow, neither of us said anything for some time.We stood and stared.Finally my companion croaked, "Is that a light?"It was long after dark when we came shambling into a Karhidish village, one street between high roofed dark houses, the snow packed and banked up to their winter doors.We stopped at the hot shop, through the narrow shutters of which flowed, in cracks and rays and arrows, the yellow light we had seen across the hills of winter.We opened the door and went in.It was Odsordny Anner, the eighty first day of our journey; we were eleven days over Estraven's proposed schedule.He had estimated our food supply exactly: seventy eight days' worth at the outside.We had come 840 miles, by the sledge meter plus a guess for the last few days.Many of those miles had been wasted in backtracking, and if we had really had eight hundred miles to cover we should never have made it; when we got a good map we figured that the distance between Pulefen Farm and this village was less than 730 miles.All those miles and days had been across a houseless, speechless desolation: rock, ice, sky, and silence: nothing else, for eighty one days, except each other.We entered into a big steaming hot bright lit room full of food and the smells of food, and people and the voices of people.
