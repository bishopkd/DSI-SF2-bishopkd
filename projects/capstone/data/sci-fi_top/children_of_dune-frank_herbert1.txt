   Children of Dune     Frank Herbert   Muad'Dib's teachings have become the playground of scholastics, of the superstitious and the corrupt.He taught a balanced way of life, a philosophy with which a human can meet problems arising from an ever changing universe.He said humankind is still evolving, in a process which will never end.He said this evolution moves on changing principles which are known only to eternity.How can corrupted reasoning play with such an essence?Words of the Mentat Duncan Idaho   A spot of light appeared on the deep red rug which covered the raw rock of the cave floor.The light glowed without apparent source, having its existence only on the red fabric surface woven of spice fiber.A questing circle about two centimeters in diameter, it moved erratically   now elongated, now an oval.Encountering the deep green side of a bed, it leaped upward, folded itself across the bed's surface.Beneath the green covering lay a child with rusty hair, face still round with baby fat, a generous mouth   a figure lacking the lean sparseness of Fremen tradition, but not as water fat as an off worlder.As the light passed across closed eyelids, the small figure stirred.The light winked out.Now there was only the sound of even breathing and, faint behind it, a reassuring drip drip drip of water collecting in a catch basin from the windstill far above the cave.Again the light appeared in the chamber   slightly larger, a few lumens brighter.This time there was a suggestion of source and movement to it: a hooded figure filled the arched doorway at the chamber's edge and the light originated there.Once more the light flowed around the chamber, testing, questing.There was a sense of menace in it, a restless dissatisfaction.It avoided the sleeping child, paused on the gridded air inlet at an upper corner, probed a bulge in the green and gold wall hangings which softened the enclosing rock.Presently the light winked out.The hooded figure moved with a betraying swish of fabric, took up a station at one side of the arched doorway.Anyone aware of the routine here in Sietch Tabr would have suspected at once that this must be Stilgar, Naib of the Sietch, guardian of the orphaned twins who would one day take up the mantle of their father, Paul Muad'Dib.Stilgar often made night inspections of the twins' quarters, always going first to the chamber where Ghanima slept and ending here in the adjoining room, where he could reassure himself that Leto was not threatened.I'm an old fool, Stilgar thought.He fingered the cold surface of the light projector before restoring it to the loop in his belt sash.The projector irritated him even while he depended upon it.The thing was a subtle instrument of the Imperium, a device to detect the presence of large living bodies.It had shown only the sleeping children in the royal bedchambers.Stilgar knew his thoughts and emotions were like the light.He could not still a restless inner projection.Some greater power controlled that movement.It projected him into this moment where he sensed the accumulated peril.Here lay the magnet for dreams of grandeur throughout the known universe.Here lay temporal riches, secular authority and that most powerful of all mystic talismans: the divine authenticity of Muad'Dib's religious bequest.In these twins   Leto and his sister Ghanima   an awesome power focused.While they lived, Muad'Dib, though dead, lived in them.These were not merely nine year old children; they were a natural force, objects of veneration and fear.They were the children of Paul Atreides, who had become Muad'Dib, the Mahdi of all the Fremen.Muad'Dib had ignited an explosion of humanity; Fremen had spread from this planet in a jihad, carrying their fervor across the human universe in a wave of religious government whose scope and ubiquitous authority had left its mark on every planet.Yet these children of Muad'Dib are flesh and blood, Stilgar thought.Two simple thrusts of my knife would still their hearts.Their water would return to the tribe.His wayward mind fell into turmoil at such a thought.To kill Muad'Dib's children!But the years had made him wise in introspection.Stilgar knew the origin of such a terrible thought.It came from the left hand of the damned, not from the right hand of the blessed.The ayat and burhan of Life held few mysteries for him.Once he'd been proud to think of himself as Fremen, to think of the desert as a friend, to name his planet Dune in his thoughts and not Arrakis, as it was marked on all of the Imperial star charts.How simple things were when our Messiah was only a dream, he thought.By finding our Mahdi we loosed upon the universe countless messianic dreams.Every people subjugated by the jihad now dreams of a leader to come.Stilgar glanced into the darkened bedchamber.If my knife liberated all of those people, would they make a messiah of me?Leto could be heard stirring restlessly in his bed.Stilgar sighed.He had never known the Atreides grandfather whose name this child had taken.But many said the moral strength of Muad'Dib had come from that source.Would that terrifying quality of rightness skip a generation now?Stilgar found himself unable to answer this question.He thought: Sietch Tabr is mine.I rule here.I am a Naib of the Fremen.Without me there would have been no Muad'Dib.These twins, now...through Chani, their mother and my kinswoman, my blood flows in their veins, I am there with Muad'Dib and Chani and all the others.What have we done to our universe?Stilgar could not explain why such thoughts came to him in the night and why they made him feel so guilty.He crouched within his hooded robe.Reality was not at all like the dream.The Friendly Desert, which once had spread from pole to pole, was reduced to half its former size.The mythic paradise of spreading greenery filled him with dismay.It was not like the dream.And as his planet changed, he knew he had changed.He had become a far more subtle person than the one time sietch chieftain.He was aware now of many things   of statecraft and profound consequences in the smallest decisions.Yet he felt this knowledge and subtlety as a thin veneer covering an iron core of simpler, more deterministic awareness.And that older core called out to him, pleaded with him for a return to cleaner values.The morning sounds of the sietch began intruding upon his thoughts.People were beginning to move about in the cavern.He felt a breeze against his cheeks: people were going out through the doorseals into the predawn darkness.The breeze spoke of carelessness as it spoke of the time.Warren dwellers no longer maintained the tight water discipline of the old days.Why should they, when rain had been recorded on this planet, when clouds were seen, when eight Fremen had been inundated and killed by a flash flood in a wadi?Until that event, the word drowned had not existed in the language of Dune.But this was no longer Dune; this was Arrakis...and it was the morning of an eventful day.He thought: Jessica, mother of Muad'Dib and grandmother of these royal twins, returns to our planet today.Why does she end her self imposed exile at this time?Why does she leave the softness and security of Caladan for the dangers of Arrakis?And there were other worries: Would she sense Stilgar's doubts?She was a Bene Gesserit witch, graduate of the Sisterhood's deepest training, and a Reverend Mother in her own right.Such females were acute and they were dangerous.Would she order him to fall upon his own knife as the Umma Protector of Liet Kynes had been ordered?Would I obey her?he wondered.He could not answer that question, but now he thought about Liet Kynes, the planetologist who had first dreamed of transforming the planetwide desert of Dune into the human supportive green planet which it was becoming.Liet Kynes had been Chani's father.Without him there would have been no dream, no Chani, no royal twins.The workings of this fragile chain dismayed Stilgar.How have we met in this place?he asked himself.How have we combined?For what purpose?Is it my duty to end it all, to shatter that great combination?Stilgar admitted the terrible urging within him now.He could make that choice, denying love and family to do what a Naib must do on occasion: make a deadly decision for the good of the tribe.By one view, such a murder represented ultimate betrayal and atrocity.To kill mere children!Yet they were not mere children.They had eaten melange, had shared in the sietch orgy, had probed the desert for sandtrout and played the other games of Fremen children...And they sat in the Royal Council.Children of such tender years, yet wise enough to sit in the Council.They might be children in flesh, but they were ancient in experience, born with a totality of genetic memory, a terrifying awareness which set their Aunt Alia and themselves apart from all other living humans.Many times in many nights had Stilgar found his mind circling this difference shared by the twins and their aunt; many times had he been awakened from sleep by these torments, coming here to the twins' bedchambers with his dreams unfinished.Now his doubts came to focus.Failure to make a decision was in itself a decision   he knew this.These twins and their aunt had awakened in the womb, knowing there all of the memories passed onto them by their ancestors.Spice addiction had done this, spice addiction of the mothers   the Lady Jessica and Chani.The Lady Jessica had borne a son, Muad'Dib before her Addiction.Alia had come after the addiction.That was clear in retrospect.The countless generations of selective breeding directed by the Bene Gesserits had achieved Muad'Dib, but nowhere in the Sisterhood's plans had they allowed for melange.Oh, they knew about this possibility, but they feared it and called it Abomination.That was the most dismaying fact.Abomination.They must possess reasons for such a judgment.And if they said Alia was an Abomination, then that must apply equally to the twins, because Chani, too, had been addicted, her body saturated with spice, and her genes had somehow complemented those of Muad'Dib.Stilgar's thoughts moved in ferment.There could be no doubt these twins went beyond their father.But in which direction?The boy spoke of an ability to be his father   and had proved it.Even as an infant, Leto had revealed memories which only Muad'Dib should have known.Were there other ancestors waiting in that vast spectrum of memories   ancestors whose beliefs and habits created unspeakable dangers for living humans?Abominations, the holy witches of the Bene Gesserit said.Yet the Sisterhood coveted the genophase of these children.The witches wanted sperm and ovum without the disturbing flesh which carried them.Was that why the Lady Jessica returned at this time?She had broken with the Sisterhood to support her Ducal mate, but rumor said she had returned to the Bene Gesserit ways.I could end all of these dreams, Stilgar thought.How simple it would be.And yet again he wondered at himself that he could contemplate such a choice.Were Muad'Dib's twins responsible for the reality which obliterated the dreams of others?No.They were merely the lens through which light poured to reveal new shapes in the universe.In torment, his mind reverted to primary Fremen beliefs, and he thought: God's command comes; so seek not to hasten it.God's it is to show the way; and some do swerve from it.It was the religion of Muad'Dib which upset Stilgar most.Why did they make a god of Muad'Dib?Why deify a man known to be flesh?Muad'Dib's Golden Elixir of Life had created a bureaucratic monster which sat astride human affairs.Government and religion united, and breaking a law became sin.A smell of blasphemy arose like smoke around any questioning of governmental edicts.The guilt of rebellion invoked hellfire and self righteous judgments.Yet it was men who created these governmental edicts.Stilgar shook his head sadly, not seeing the attendants who had moved into the Royal Antechamber for their morning duties.He fingered the crysknife at his waist, thinking of the past it symbolized, thinking that more than once he had sympathized with rebels whose abortive uprisings had been crushed by his own orders.Confusion washed through his mind and he wished he knew how to obliterate it, returning to the simplicities represented by the knife.But the universe would not turn backward.It was a great engine projected upon the grey void of nonexistence.His knife, if it brought the deaths of the twins, would only reverberate against that void, weaving new complexities to echo through human history, creating new surges of chaos, inviting humankind to attempt other forms of order and disorder.Stilgar sighed, growing aware of the movements around him.Yes, these attendants represented a kind of order which was bound around Muad'Dib's twins.They moved from one moment to the next, meeting whatever necessities occurred there.Best to emulate them, Stilgar told himself.Best meet what comes when it comes.I am an attendant yet, he told himself.And my master is God the Merciful, the Compassionate.And he quoted to himself: "Surely, We have put on their necks fetters up to the chin, so their heads are raised; and We have put before them a barrier and behind them a barrier; and We have covered them, so they do not see. "Thus was it written in the old Fremen religion.Stilgar nodded to himself.To see, to anticipate the next moment as Muad'Dib had done with his awesome visions of the future, added a counterforce to human affairs.It created new places for decisions.To be unfettered, yes, that might well indicate a whim of God.Another complexity beyond ordinary human reach.Stilgar removed his hand from the knife.His fingers tingled with remembrance of it.But the blade which once had glistened in a sandworm's gaping mouth remained in its sheath.Stilgar knew he would not draw this blade now to kill the twins.He had reached a decision.Better to retain that one old virtue which he still cherished: loyalty.Better the complexities one thought he knew than the complexities which defied understanding.Better the now than the future of a dream.The bitter taste in his mouth told Stilgar how empty and revolting some dreams could be.No!No more dreams!= = = = = =   CHALLENGE: "Have you seen The Preacher?"RESPONSE: "I have seen a sandworm.

"Riddles of Arrakis by Harq al Ada   As was the Fremen custom, the Atreides twins arose an hour before dawn.They yawned and stretched in secret unison in their adjoining chambers, feeling the activity of the cave warren around them.They could hear attendants in the antechamber preparing breakfast, a simple gruel with dates and nuts blended in liquid skimmed from partially fermented spice.There were glowglobes in the antechamber and a soft yellow light entered through the open archways of the bedchambers.The twins dressed swiftly in the soft light, each hearing the other nearby.As they had agreed, they donned stillsuits against the desert's parching winds.Presently the royal pair met in the antechamber, noting the sudden stillness of the attendants.Leto, it was observed, wore a black edged tan cape over his stillsuit's grey slickness.His sister wore a green cape.The neck of each cape was held by a clasp in the form of an Atreides hawk   gold with red jewels for eyes.Seeing this finery, Harah, who was one of Stilgar's wives, said: "I see you have dressed to honor your grandmother. "Leto picked up his breakfast bowl before looking at Harah's dark and wind creased face.He shook his head.Then: "How do you know it's not ourselves we honor?"Harah met his taunting stare without flinching, said: "My eyes are just as blue as yours!"Ghanima laughed aloud.Harah was always an adept at the Fremen challenge game.In one sentence, she had said: "Don't taunt me, boy.You may be royalty, but we both bear the stigma of melange addiction   eyes without whites.What Fremen needs more finery or more honor than that?"Leto smiled, shook his head ruefully."Harah, my love, if you were but younger and not already Stilgar's, I'd make you my own. "Harah accepted the small victory easily, signaling the other attendants to continue preparing the chambers for this day's important activities."Eat your breakfasts," she said."You'll need the energy today. ""Then you agree that we're not too fine for our grandmother?"Ghanima asked, speaking around a mouthful of gruel."Don't fear her, Ghani," Harah said.Leto gulped a mouthful of gruel, sent a probing stare at Harah.The woman was infernally folk wise, seeing through the game of finery so quickly."Will she believe we fear her?"Leto asked."Like as not," Harah said."She was our Reverend Mother, remember.I know her ways. ""How was Alia dressed?"Ghanima asked."I've not seen her. "Harah spoke shortly, turning away.Leto and Ghanima exchanged a look, of shared secrets, bent quickly to their breakfast.Presently they went out into the great central passage.Ghanima spoke in one of the ancient languages they shared in genetic memory: "So today we have a grandmother. ""It bothers Alia greatly," Leto said."Who likes to give up such authority?"Ghanima asked.Leto laughed softly, an oddly adult sound from flesh so young."It's more than that. ""Will her mother's eyes observe what we have observed?""And why not?"Leto asked."Yes...That could be what Alia fears. ""Who knows Abomination better than Abomination?"Leto asked."We could be wrong, you know," Ghanima said."But we're not. "And he quoted from the Bene Gesserit Azhar Book: "It is with reason and terrible experience that we call the pre born Abomination.For who knows what lost and damned persona out of our evil past may take over the living flesh?""I know the history of it," Ghanima said."But if that's true, why don't we suffer from this inner assault?""Perhaps our parents stand guard within us," Leto said."Then why not guardians for Alia as well?""I don't know.It could be because one of her parents remains among the living.It could be simply that we are still young and strong.Perhaps when we're older and more cynical... ""We must take great care with this grandmother," Ghanima said."And not discuss this Preacher who wanders our planet speaking heresy?""You don't really think he's our father!""I make no judgment on it, but Alia fears him. "Ghanima shook her head sharply."I don't believe this Abomination nonsense!""You've just as many memories as I have," Leto said."You can believe what you want to believe. ""You think it's because we haven't dared the spice trance and Alia has," Ghanima said."That's exactly what I think. "They fell silent, moving out into the flow of people in the central passage.It was cool in Sietch Tabr, but the stillsuits were warm and the twins kept their condenser hoods thrown back from their red hair.Their faces betrayed the stamp of shared genes: generous mouths, widely set eyes of spice addict blue on blue.Leto was first to note the approach of their Aunt Alia."Here she comes now," he said, shifting to Atreides battle language as a warning.Ghanima nodded to her aunt as Alia stopped in front of them, said: "A spoil of war greets her illustrious relative. "Using the same Chakobsa language, Ghanima emphasized the meaning of her own name   Spoil of War."You see, Beloved Aunt," Leto said, "we prepare ourselves for today's encounter with your mother. "Alia, the one person in the teeming royal household who harbored not the faintest surprise at adult behavior from these children, glared from one to the other.Then: "Hold your tongues, both of you!"Alia's bronze hair was pulled back into two golden water rings.Her oval face held a frown, the wide mouth with its downturned hint of self indulgence was held in a tight line.Worry wrinkles fanned the corners of her blue on blue eyes."I've warned both of you how to behave today," Alia said."You know the reasons as well as I. ""We know your reasons, but you may not know ours," Ghanima said."Ghani!"Alia growled.Leto glared at his aunt, said: "Today of all days, we will not pretend to be simpering infants!""No one wants you to simper," Alia said."But we think it unwise for you to provoke dangerous thoughts in my mother.Irulan agrees with me.Who knows what role the Lady Jessica will choose?She is, after all, Bene Gesserit. "Leto shook his head, wondering: Why does Alia not see what we suspect?Is she too far gone?And he made special note of the subtle gene markers on Alia's face which betrayed the presence of her maternal grandfather.The Baron Vladimir Harkonnen had not been a pleasant person.At this observation, Leto felt the vague stirrings of his own disquiet, thinking: My own ancestor, too.He said: "The Lady Jessica was trained to rule. "Ghanima nodded."Why does she choose this time to come back?"Alia scowled.Then: "Is it possible she merely wants to see her grandchildren?"Ghanima thought: That's what you hope, my dear aunt.But it's damned well not likely."She cannot rule here," Alia said."She has Caladan.That should be enough. "Ghanima spoke placatingly: "When our father went into the desert to die, he left you as Regent.He... ""Have you any complaint?"Alia demanded."It was a reasonable choice," Leto said, following his sister's lead."You were the one person who knew what it was like to be born as we were born. ""It's rumored that my mother has returned to the Sisterhood," Alia said, "and you both knew what the Bene Gesserit think about... ""Abomination," Leto said."Yes!"Alia bit the word off."Once a witch, always a witch   so it's said," Ghanima said.Sister, you play a dangerous game, Leto thought, but he followed her lead, saying: "Our grandmother was a woman of greater simplicity than others of her kind.You share her memories, Alia; surely you must know what to expect. ""Simplicity!"Alia said, shaking her head, looking around her at the thronged passage, then back to the twins."If my mother were less complex, neither of you would be here   nor I.  I would have been her firstborn and none of this... "A shrug, half shudder, moved her shoulders."I warn you two, be very careful what you do today. "Alia looked up."Here comes my guard. ""And you still don't think it safe for us to accompany you to the spaceport?"Leto asked."Wait here," Alia said."I'll bring her back. "Leto exchanged a look with his sister, said: "You've told us many times that the memories we hold from those who've passed before us lack a certain usefulness until we've experienced enough with our own flesh to make them reality.My sister and I believe this.We anticipate dangerous changes with the arrival of our grandmother. ""Don't stop believing that," Alia said.She turned away to be enclosed by her guards and they moved swiftly down the passage toward the State Entrance where ornithopters awaited them.Ghanima wiped a tear from her right eye."Water for the dead?"Leto whispered, taking his sister's arm.Ghanima drew in a deep, sighing breath, thinking of how she had observed her aunt, using the way she knew best from her own accumulation of ancestral experiences."Spice trance did it?"she asked, knowing what Leto would say."Do you have a better suggestion?""For the sake of argument, why didn't our father...or even our grandmother succumb?"He studied her a moment.Then: "You know the answer as well as I do.They had secure personalities by the time they came to Arrakis.The spice trance   well... "He shrugged."They weren't born into this world already possessed of their ancestors.Alia, though... ""Why didn't she believe the Bene Gesserit warnings?"Ghanima chewed her lower lip."Alia had the same information to draw upon that we do. ""They already were calling her Abomination," Leto said."Don't you find it tempting to find out if you're stronger than all of those... ""No, I don't!"Ghanima looked away from her brother's probing stare, shuddered.She had only to consult her genetic memories and the Sisterhood's warnings took on vivid shape.The pre born observably tended to become adults of nasty habits.And the likely cause...Again she shuddered."Pity we don't have a few pre born in our ancestry," Leto said."Perhaps we do. ""But we'd...Ahh, yes, the old unanswered question: Do we really have open access to every ancestor's total file of experiences?"From his own inner turmoil, Leto knew how this conversation must be disturbing his sister.They'd considered this question many times, always without conclusion.He said: "We must delay and delay and delay every time she urges the trance upon us.Extreme caution with a spice overdose; that's our best course. ""An overdose would have to be pretty large," Ghanima said."Our tolerance is probably high," he agreed."Look how much Alia requires. ""I pity her," Ghanima said."The lure of it must've been subtle and insidious, creeping up on her until... ""She's a victim, yes," Leto said."Abomination. ""We could be wrong. ""True. ""I always wonder," Ghanima mused, "if the next ancestral memory I seek will be the one which... ""The past is no farther away than your pillow," Leto said."We must make the opportunity to discuss this with our grandmother. ""So her memory within me urges," Leto said.Ghanima met his gaze.Then: "Too much knowledge never makes for simple decisions. "= = = = = =   The sietch at the desert's rim Was Liet's, was Kynes's, Was Stilgar's, was Muad'Dib's And, once more, was Stilgar's.The Naibs one by one sleep in the sand, But the sietch endures.from a Fremen song   Alia felt her heart pounding as she walked away from the twins.For a few pulsing seconds, she had felt herself near compulsion to stay with them and beg their help.What a foolish weakness!Memory of it sent a warning stillness through Alia.Would these twins dare practice prescience?The path which had engulfed their father must lure them   spice trance with its visions of the future wavering like gauze blown on a fickle wind.Why cannot I see the future?Alia wondered.Much as I try, why does it elude me?The twins must be made to try, she told herself.They could be lured into it.They had the curiosity of children and it was linked to memories which traversed millennia.Just as I have, Alia thought.Her guards opened the moisture seals at the State Entrance of the sietch, stood aside as she emerged onto the landing lip where the ornithopters waited.There was a wind from the desert blowing dust across the sky, but the day was bright.Emerging from the glowglobes of the sietch into the daylight sent her thoughts outward.Why was the Lady Jessica returning at this moment?Had stories been carried to Caladan, stories of how the Regency was..."We must hurry, My Lady," one of her guards said, raising his voice above the wind sounds.Alia allowed herself to be helped into her ornithopter and secured the safety harness, but her thoughts went leaping ahead.Why now?As the ornithopter's wings dipped and the craft went skidding into the air, she felt the pomp and power of her position as physical things   but they were fragile, oh, how fragile!Why now, when her plans were not completed?The dust mists drifted, lifting, and she could see the bright sunlight upon the changing landscape of the planet: broad reaches of green vegetation where parched earth had once dominated.Without a vision of the future, I could fail.Oh, what magic I could perform if only I could see as Paul saw!Not for me the bitterness which prescient visions brought.A tormenting hunger shuddered through her and she wished she could put aside the power.Oh, to be as others were   blind in that safest of all blindnesses, living only the hypnoidal half life into which birth shock precipitated most humans.But no!She had been born an Atreides, victim of that eons deep awareness inflicted by her mother's spice addiction.Why does my mother return today?Gurney Halleck would be with her   ever the devoted servant, the hired killer of ugly mien, loyal and straightforward, a musician who played murder with a sliptip, or entertained with equal ease upon his nine string baliset.Some said he'd become her mother's lover.That would be a thing to ferret out; it might prove a most valuable leverage.The wish to be as others were left her.Leto must be lured into the spice trance.She recalled asking the boy how he would deal with Gurney Halleck.And Leto, sensing undercurrents in her question, had said Halleck was loyal "to a fault," adding: "He adored...my father. "She'd noted the small hesitation.Leto had almost said "me" instead of "my father. "Yes, it was hard at times to separate the genetic memory from the chord of living flesh.Gurney Halleck would not make that separation easier for Leto.A harsh smile touched Alia's lips.Gurney had chosen to return to Caladan with the Lady Jessica after Paul's death.His return would tangle many things.Coming back to Arrakis, he would add his own complexities to the existing lines.He had served Paul's father   and thus the succession went: Leto I to Paul to Leto II.And out of the Bene Gesserit breeding program: Jessica to Alia to Ghanima   a branching line.Gurney, adding to the confusion of identities, might prove valuable.What would he do if he discovered we carry the blood of Harkonnens, the Harkonnens he hates so bitterly?The smile on Alia's lips became introspective.The twins were, after all, children.They were like children with countless parents, whose memories belonged both to others and to self.They would stand at the lip of Sietch Tabr and watch the track of their grandmother's ship landing in the Arrakeen Basin.That burning mark of a ship's passage visible on the sky   would it make Jessica's arrival more real for her grandchildren?My mother will ask me about their training, Alia thought.Do I mix prana bindu disciplines with a judicious hand?And I will tell her that they train themselves   just as I did.I will quote her grandson to her: "Among the responsibilities of command is the necessity to punish...but only when the victim demands it. "It came to Alia then that if she could only focus the Lady Jessica's attention sharply enough onto the twins, others might escape a closer inspection.Such a thing could be done.Leto was very much like Paul.And why not?He could be Paul whenever he chose.Even Ghanima possessed this shattering ability.Just as I can be my mother or any of the others who've shared their lives with us.She veered away from this thought, staring out at the passing landscape of the Shield Wall.Then: How was it to leave the warm safety of water rich Caladan and return to Arrakis, to this desert planet where her Duke was murdered and her son died a martyr?Why did the Lady Jessica come back at this time?Alia found no answer   nothing certain.She could share another's ego awareness, but when experiences went their separate ways, then motives diverged as well.The stuff of decisions lay in the private actions taken by individuals.For the pre born, the many born Atreides, this remained the paramount reality, in itself another kind of birth: it was the absolute separation of living, breathing flesh when that flesh left the womb which had afflicted it with multiple awareness.Alia saw nothing strange in loving and hating her mother simultaneously.It was a necessity, a required balance without room for guilt or blame.Where could loving or hating stop?Was one to blame the Bene Gesserit because they set the Lady Jessica upon a certain course?Guilt and blame grew diffuse when memory covered millennia.The Sisterhood had only been seeking to breed a Kwisatz Haderach: the male counterpart of a fully developed Reverend Mother...and more   a human of superior sensitivity and awareness, the Kwisatz Haderach who could be many places simultaneously.And the Lady Jessica, merely a pawn in that breeding program, had the bad taste to fall in love with the breeding partner to whom she had been assigned.Responsive to her beloved Duke's wishes, she produced a son instead of the daughter which the Sisterhood had commanded as the firstborn.Leaving me to be born after she became addicted to the spice!And now they don't want me.Now they fear me!With good reason...They'd achieved Paul, their Kwisatz Haderach, one lifetime too early   a minor miscalculation in a plan that extended.And now they had another problem: the Abomination, who carried the precious genes they'd sought for so many generations.Alia felt a shadow pass across her, glanced upward.Her escort was assuming the high guard position preparatory to landing.She shook her head in wonderment at her wandering thoughts.What good was served by calling up old lifetimes and rubbing their mistakes together?This was a new lifetime.Duncan Idaho had put his mentat awareness to the question of why Jessica returned at this time, evaluating the problem in the human computer fashion which was his gift.He said she returned to take over the twins for the Sisterhood.The twins, too, carried those precious genes.Duncan could well be right.That might be enough to take the Lady Jessica out of her self imposed seclusion on Caladan.If the Sisterhood commanded...Well, why else would she come back to the scenes of so much that must be shatteringly painful to her?"We shall see," Alia muttered.She felt the ornithopter touch down on the roof of her Keep, a positive and jarring punctuation which filled her with grim anticipation.= = = = = =   melange (me' lange also ma,lanj) n s, origin uncertain (thought to derive from ancient Terran Franzh): a.  mixture of spices;

also employed by Spacing Guild Navigators and the Bene Gesserit.Dictionary Royal fifth edition   The two big cats came over the rocky ridge in the dawn light, loping easily.They were not really into the passionate hunt as yet, merely looking over their territory.They were called Laza tigers, a special breed brought here to the planet Salusa Secundus almost eight thousand years past.Genetic manipulation of the ancient Terran stock had erased some of the original tiger features and refined other elements.The fangs remained long.Their faces were wide, eyes alert and intelligent.The paws were enlarged to give them support on uneven terrain and their sheathed claws could extend some ten centimeters, sharpened at the ends into razor tips by abrasive compression of the sheath.Their coats were a flat and even tan which made them almost invisible against sand.They differed in another way from their ancestors: servo stimulators had been implanted in their brains while they were cubs.The stimulators made them pawns of whoever possessed the transmitter.It was cold and as the cats paused to scan the terrain, their breath made fog on the air.Around them lay a region of Salusa Secundus left sere and barren, a place which harbored a scant few sandtrout smuggled from Arrakis and kept precariously alive in the dream that the melange monopoly might be broken.Where the cats stood, the landscape was marked by tan rocks and a scattering of sparse bushes, silvery green in the long shadows of the morning sun.Without the slightest movement the cats grew suddenly alert.Their eyes turned slowly left, then their heads turned.Far down in the scarred land two children struggled up a dry wash, hand in hand.The children appeared to be of an age, perhaps nine or ten standard years.They were red haired and wore stillsuits partly covered by rich white bourkas which bore all around the hem and at the forehead the hawk crest of the House Atreides worked in flame jewel threads.As they walked, the children chattered happily and their voices carried clearly to the hunting cats.The Laza tigers knew this game; they had played it before, but they remained quiescent, awaiting the triggering of the chase signal in their servo stimulators.Now a man appeared on the ridgetop behind the cats.He stopped and surveyed the scene: cats, children.The man wore a Sardaukar working uniform in grey and black with insignia of a Levenbrech, aide to a Bashar.A harness passed behind his neck and under his arms to carry the servo transmitter in a thin package against his chest where the keys could be reached easily by either hand.The cats did not turn at his approach.They knew this man by sound and smell.He scrambled down to stop two paces from the cats, mopped his forehead.The air was cold, but this was hot work.Again his pale eyes surveyed the scene: cats, children.He pushed a damp strand of blond hair back under his black working helmet, touched the implanted microphone in his throat."The cats have them in sight. "The answering voice came to him through receivers implanted behind each ear."We see them. ""This time?"the Levenbrech asked."Will they do it without a chase command?"the voice countered."They're ready," the Levenbrech said."Very well.Let us see if four conditioning sessions will be enough. ""Tell me when you're ready. ""Any time. ""Now, then," the Levenbrech said.He touched a red key on the right hand side of his servo transmitter, first releasing a bar which shielded the key.Now the cats stood without any transmitted restraints.He held his hand over a black key below the red one, ready to stop the animals should they turn on him.But they took no notice of him, crouched, and began working their way down the ridge toward the children.Their great paws slid out in smooth gliding motions.The Levenbrech squatted to observe, knowing that somewhere around him a hidden transeye carried this entire scene to a secret monitor within the Keep where his Prince lived.Presently the cats began to lope, then to run.The children, intent on climbing through the rocky terrain, still had not seen their peril.One of them laughed, a high and piping sound in the clear air.The other child stumbled and, recovering balance, turned and saw the cats.The child pointed."Look!"Both children stopped and stared at the interesting intrusion into their lives.They were still standing when the Laza tigers hit them, one cat to each child.The children died with a casual abruptness, necks broken swiftly.The cats began to feed."Shall I recall them?"the Levenbrech asked."Let them finish.They did well.I knew they would; this pair is superb. ""Best I've ever seen," the Levenbrech agreed."Very good, then.Transport is being sent for you.We will sign off now. "The Levenbrech stood and stretched.He refrained from looking directly off to the high ground on his left where a telltale glitter had revealed the location of the transeye, which had relayed his fine performance to his Bashar far away in the green lands of the Capitol.The Levenbrech smiled.There would be a promotion for this day's work.Already he could feel a Bator's insignia at his neck   and someday, Burseg...Even, one day, Bashar.People who served well in the corps of Farad'n, grandson of the late Shaddam IV, earned rich promotions.One day, when the Prince was seated on his rightful throne, there would be even greater promotions.A Bashar's rank might not be the end of it.There were Baronies and Earldoms to be had on the many worlds of this realm...once the twin Atreides were removed.= = = = = =   The Fremen must return to his original faith, to his genius in forming human communities; he must return to the past, where that lesson of survival was learned in the struggle with Arrakis.The only business of the Fremen should be that of opening his soul to the inner teachings.The worlds of the Imperium, the Landsraad and the CHOAM Confederacy have no message to give him.They will only rob him of his soul.The Preacher at Arrakeen   All around the Lady Jessica, reaching far out into the dun flatness of the landing plain upon which her transport rested, crackling and sighing after its dive from space, stood an ocean of humanity.She estimated half a million people were there and perhaps only a third of them pilgrims.They stood in awesome silence, attention fixed on the transport's exit platform, whose shadowy hatchway concealed her and her party.It lacked two hours until noon, but already the air above that throng reflected a dusty shimmering in promise of the day's heat.Jessica touched her silver flecked copper hair where it framed her oval face beneath the aba hood of a Reverend Mother.She knew she did not look her best after the long trip, and the black of the aba was not her best color.But she had worn this garment here before.The significance of the aba robe would not be lost upon the Fremen.She sighed.Space travel did not agree with her, and there'd been that added burden of memories   the other trip from Caladan to Arrakis when her Duke had been forced into this fief against his better judgment.Slowly, probing with her Bene Gesserit trained ability to detect significant minutiae, she scanned the sea of people.There were stillsuit hoods of dull grey, garments of Fremen from the deep desert; there were white robed pilgrims with penitence marks on their shoulders; there were scattered pockets of rich merchants, hoodless in light clothing to flaunt their disdain for water loss in Arrakeen's parching air...and there was the delegation from the Society of the Faithful, green robed and heavily hooded, standing aloof within the sanctity of their own group.Only when she lifted her gaze from the crowd did the scene take on any similarity to that which had greeted her upon her arrival with her beloved Duke.How long ago had that been?More than twenty years.She did not like to think of those intervening heartbeats.Time lay within her like a dead weight, and it was as though her years away from this planet had never been.Once more into the dragon's mouth, she thought.Here, upon this plain, her son had wrested the Imperium from the late Shaddam IV.A convulsion of history had imprinted this place into men's minds and beliefs.She heard the restless stirring of the entourage behind her and again she sighed.They must wait for Alia, who had been delayed.Alia's party could be seen now approaching from the far edge of the throng, creating a human wave as a wedge of Royal Guards opened a passage.Jessica scanned the landscape once more.Many differences submitted to her searching stare.A prayer balcony had been added to the landing field's control tower.And visible far off to the left across the plain stood the awesome pile of plasteel which Paul had built as his fortress   his "sietch above the sand. "It was the largest integrated single construction ever to rise from the hand of man.Entire cities could have been housed within its walls and room to spare.Now it housed the most powerful governing force in the Imperium, Alia's "Society of the Faithful," which she had built upon her brother's body.That place must go, Jessica thought.Alia's delegation had reached the foot of the exit ramp and stood there expectantly.Jessica recognized Stilgar's craggy features.And God forfend!There stood the Princess Irulan hiding her savagery in that seductive body with its cap of golden hair exposed by a vagrant breeze.Irulan seemed not to have aged a day; it was an affront.And there, at the point of the wedge, was Alia, her features impudently youthful, her eyes staring upward into the hatchway's shadows.Jessica's mouth drew into a straight line and she scanned her daughter's face.A leaden sensation pulsed through Jessica's body and she heard the surf of her own life within her ears.The rumors were true!Horrible!Horrible!Alia had fallen into the forbidden way.The evidence was there for the initiate to read.Abomination!In the few moments it took her to recover, Jessica realized how much she had hoped to find the rumors false.What of the twins?she asked herself.Are they lost, too?Slowly, as befitted the mother of a god, Jessica moved out of the shadows and onto the lip of the ramp.Her entourage remained behind as instructed.These next few moments were the crucial ones.Jessica stood alone in full view of the throng.She heard Gurney Halleck cough nervously behind her.Gurney had objected: "Not even a shield on you?Gods below, woman!You're insane!"But among Gurney's most valuable features was a core of obedience.He would say his piece and then he would obey.Now he obeyed.The human sea emitted a sound like the hiss of a giant sandworm as Jessica emerged.She raised her arms in the benedictory to which the priesthood had conditioned the Imperium.With significant pockets of tardiness, but still like one giant organism, the people sank to their knees.Even the official party complied.Jessica had marked out the places of delay, and she knew that other eyes behind her and among her agents in the throng had memorized a temporary map with which to seek out the tardy.As Jessica remained with her arms upraised, Gurney and his men emerged.They moved swiftly past her down the ramp, ignoring the official party's startled looks, joining the agents who identified themselves by handsign.Quickly they fanned out through the human sea, leaping knots of kneeling figures, dashing through narrow lanes.A few of their targets saw the danger and tried to flee.They were the easiest: a thrown knife, a garrote loop and the runners went down.Others were herded out of the press, hands bound, feet hobbled.Through it all, Jessica stood with arms outstretched, blessing by her presence, keeping the throng subservient.She read the signs of spreading rumors though, and knew the dominant one because it had been planted: "The Reverend Mother returns to weed out the slackers.Bless the mother of our Lord!"When it was over   a few dead bodies sprawled on the sand, captives removed to holding pens beneath the landing tower   Jessica lowered her arms.Perhaps three minutes had elapsed.She knew there was little likelihood Gurney and his men had taken any of the ringleaders, the ones who posed the most potent threat.They would be the alert and sensitive ones.But the captives would contain some interesting fish as well as the usual culls and dullards.Jessica lowered her arms and, cheering, the people surged to their feet.As though nothing untoward had happened, Jessica walked alone down the ramp, avoiding her daughter, singling out Stilgar for concentrated attention.The black beard which fanned out across the neck of his stillsuit hood like a wild delta contained flecks of grey, but his eyes carried that same whiteless intensity they'd presented to her on their first encounter in the desert.Stilgar knew what had just occurred, and approved.Here stood a true Fremen Naib, a leader of men and capable of bloody decisions.His first words were completely in character."Welcome home, My Lady.It's always a pleasure to see direct and effective action. "Jessica allowed herself a tiny smile."Close the port, Stil.No one leaves until we've questioned those we took. ""It's already done, My Lady," Stilgar said."Gurney's man and I planned this together. ""Those were your men, then, the ones who helped. ""Some of them, My Lady. "She read the hidden reservations, nodded."You studied me pretty well in those old days, Stil. ""As you once were at pains to tell me, My Lady, one observes the survivors and learns from them. "Alia stepped forward then and Stilgar stood aside while Jessica confronted her daughter.Knowing there was no way to hide what she had learned, Jessica did not even try concealment.Alia could read the minutiae when she needed, could read as well as any adept of the Sisterhood.She would already know by Jessica's behavior what had been seen and interpreted.They were enemies for whom the word mortal touched only the surface.Alia chose anger as the easiest and most proper reaction."How dare you plan an action such as this without consulting me?"she demanded, pushing her face close to Jessica's.Jessica spoke mildly: "As you've just heard, Gurney didn't even let me in on the whole plan.It was thought... ""And you, Stilgar!"Alia said, rounding on him."To whom are you loyal?""My oath is to Muad'Dib's children," Stilgar said, speaking stiffly."We have removed a threat to them. ""And why doesn't that fill you with joy...daughter?"Jessica asked.Alia blinked, glanced once at her mother, suppressed the inner tempest, and even managed a straight toothed smile."I am filled with joy...mother," she said.And to her own surprise, Alia found that she was happy, experiencing a terrible delight that it was all out in the open at last between herself and her mother.The moment she had dreaded was past and the power balance had not really been changed."We will discuss this in more detail at a more convenient time," Alia said, speaking both to her mother and Stilgar."But of course," Jessica said, turning with a movement of dismissal to face the Princess Irulan.For a few brief heartbeats, Jessica and the Princess stood silently studying each other   two Bene Gesserits who had broken with the Sisterhood for the same reason: love...both of them for love of men who now were dead.This Princess had loved Paul in vain, becoming his wife but not his mate.And now she lived only for the children given to Paul by his Fremen concubine, Chani.Jessica spoke first: "Where are my grandchildren?""At Sietch Tabr. ""Too dangerous for them here; I understand. "Irulan permitted herself a faint nod.She had observed the interchange between Jessica and Alia, but put upon it an interpretation for which Alia had prepared her."Jessica has returned to the Sisterhood and we both know they have plans for Paul's children. "Irulan had never been the most accomplished adept in the Bene Gesserit   valuable more for the fact that she was a daughter of Shaddam IV than for any other reason; often too proud to exert herself in extending her capabilities.Now she chose sides with an abruptness which did no credit to her training."Really, Jessica," Irulan said, "the Royal Council should have been consulted.It was wrong of you to work only through  "  "Am I to believe none of you trust Stilgar?"Jessica asked.Irulan possessed the wit to realize there could be no answer to such a question.She was glad that the priestly delegates, unable to contain their impatience any longer, pressed forward.She exchanged a glance with Alia, thinking: Jessica's as haughty and certain of herself as ever!A Bene Gesserit axiom arose unbidden in her mind, though: "The haughty do but build castle walls behind which they try to hide their doubts and fears. "Could that be true of Jessica?Surely not.Then it must be a pose.But for what purpose?The question disturbed Irulan.The priests were noisy in their possession of Muad'Dib's mother.Some only touched her arms, but most bowed low and spoke greetings.At last the leaders of the delegation took their turn with the Most Holy Reverend Mother, accepting the ordained role   "The first shall be last"   with practiced smiles, telling her that the official Lustration ceremony awaited her at the Keep, Paul's old fortress stronghold.Jessica studied the pair, finding them repellent.One was called Javid, a young man of surly features and round cheeks, shadowed eyes which could not hide the suspicions lurking in their depths.The other was Zebataleph, second son of a Naib she'd known in her Fremen days, as he was quick to remind her.He was easily classified: jollity linked with ruthlessness, a thin face with blond beard, an air about him of secret excitements and powerful knowledge.Javid she judged far more dangerous of the two, a man of private counsel, simultaneously magnetic and   she could find no other word   repellent.She found his accents strange, full of old Fremen pronunciations, as though he'd come from some isolated pocket of his people."Tell me, Javid," she said, "whence come you?""I am but a simple Fremen of the desert," he said, every syllable giving the lie to the statement.Zebataleph intruded with an offensive deference, almost mocking: "We have much to discuss of the old days, My Lady.I was one of the first, you know, to recognize the holy nature of your son's mission. ""But you weren't one of his Fedaykin," she said."No, My Lady.I possessed a more philosophic bent; I studied for the priesthood. "And insured the preservation of your skin, she thought.Javid said: "They await us at the Keep, My Lady. "Again she found the strangeness of his accent an open question demanding an answer."Who awaits us?"she asked."The Convocation of the Faith, all those who keep bright the name and the deeds of your holy son," Javid said.Jessica glanced around her, saw Alia smiling at Javid, asked: "Is this man one of your appointees, daughter?"Alia nodded."A man destined for great deeds. "But Jessica saw that Javid had no pleasure in this attention, marked him for Gurney's special study.And there came Gurney with five trusted men, signaling that they had the suspicious laggards under interrogation.He walked with the rolling stride of a powerful man, glance flicking left, right, all around, every muscle flowing through the relaxed alertness she had taught him out of the Bene Gesserit prana bindu manual.He was an ugly lump of trained reflexes, a killer, and altogether terrifying to some, but Jessica loved him and prized him above all other living men.The scar of an inkvine whip rippled along his jaw, giving him a sinister appearance, but a smile softened his face as he saw Stilgar."Well done, Stil," he said.And they gripped arms in the Fremen fashion."The Lustration," Javid said, touching Jessica's arm.Jessica drew back, chose her words carefully in the controlled power of Voice, her tone and delivery calculated for a precise emotional effect upon Javid and Zebataleph: "I returned to Dune to see my grandchildren.Must we take time for this priestly nonsense?"Zebataleph reacted with shock, his mouth dropping open, eyes alarmed, glancing about at those who had heard.The eyes marked each listener.Priestly nonsense!What effect would such words have, coming from the mother of their messiah?Javid, however, confirmed Jessica's assessment.His mouth hardened, then smiled.The eyes did not smile, nor did they waver to mark the listeners.Javid already knew each member of this party.He had an earshot map of those who would be watched with special care from this point onward.Only seconds later, Javid stopped smiling with an abruptness which said he knew how he had betrayed himself.Javid had not failed to do his homework: he knew the observational powers possessed by the Lady Jessica.A short, jerking nod of his head acknowledged those powers.In a lightning flash of mentation, Jessica weighed the necessities.A subtle hand signal to Gurney would bring Javid's death.It could be done here for effect, or in quiet later, and be made to appear an accident.She thought: When we try to conceal our innermost drives, the entire being screams betrayal.Bene Gesserit training turned upon this revelation   raising the adepts above it and teaching them to read the open flesh of others.She saw Javid's intelligence as valuable, a temporary weight in the balance.If he could be won over, he could be the link she needed, the line into the Arrakeen priesthood.And he was Alia's man.Jessica said: "My official party must remain small.We have room for one addition, however.Javid, you will join us.Zebataleph, I am sorry.And, Javid...I will attend this   this ceremony   if you insist. "Javid allowed himself a deep breath and a low voiced "As Muad'Dib's mother commands. "He glanced to Alia, to Zebataleph, back to Jessica."It pains me to delay the reunion with your grandchildren, but there are, ahhh, reasons of state... "Jessica thought: Good.He's a businessman above all else.Once we've determined the proper coinage, we'll buy him.And she found herself enjoying the fact that he insisted on his precious ceremony.This little victory would give him power with his fellows, and they both knew it.Accepting his Lustration could be a down payment on later services."I presume you've arranged transportation," she said.= = = = = =   I give you the desert chameleon, whose ability to blend itself into the background tells you all you need to know about the roots of ecology and the foundations of a personal identity.Book of Diatribes from the Hayt Chronicle   Leto sat playing a small baliset which had been sent to him on his fifth birthday by that consummate artist of the instrument, Gurney Halleck.In four years of practice, Leto had achieved a certain fluency, although the two bass side strings still gave him trouble.He had found the baliset soothing, however, for particular feelings of upset   a fact which had not escaped Ghanima.He sat now in twilight on a rock shelf at the southernmost extremity of the craggy outcropping which sheltered Sietch Tabr.Softly he strummed the baliset.Ghanima stood behind him, her small figure radiating protest.She had not wanted to come here into the open after learning from Stilgar that their grandmother was delayed in Arrakeen.She particularly objected to coming here with nightfall near.Attempting to hurry her brother, she asked: "Well, what is it?"For an answer, he began another tune.For the first time since accepting the gift, Leto felt intensely aware that this baliset had originated with a master craftsman on Caladan.He possessed inherited memories which could inflict him with profound nostalgia for that beautiful planet where House Atreides had ruled.Leto had but to relax his inner barriers in the presence of this music and he would hear memories from those times when Gurney had employed the baliset to beguile his friend and charge, Paul Atreides.With the baliset sounding in his own hands, Leto felt himself more and more dominated by his father's psychical presence.Still he played, relating more strongly to the instrument with every second that passed.He sensed the absolute idealized summation within himself which knew how to play this baliset, though nine year old muscles had not yet been conditioned to that inner awareness.Ghanima tapped her foot impatiently, unaware that she matched the rhythm of her brother's playing.Setting his mouth in a grimace of concentration, Leto broke from the familiar music and tried a song more ancient than any even Gurney had played.It had been old when Fremen migrated to their fifth planet.The words echoed a Zensunni theme, and he heard them in his memory while his fingers elicited a faltering version of the tune."Nature's beauteous form 		Contains a lovely essence 		Called by some   decay.By this lovely presence 		New life finds its way.Tears shed silently 		Are but water of the soul: 		They bring new life 		To the pain of being   		A separation from that seeing 		Which death makes whole. "Ghanima spoke behind him as he strummed the final note."There's a mucky old song.Why that one?""Because it fits. ""Will you play it for Gurney?""Perhaps. ""He'll call it moody nonsense. ""I know. "Leto peered back over his shoulder at Ghanima.There was no surprise in him that she knew the song and its lyrics, but he felt a sudden onset of awe at the singleness of their twinned lives.One of them could die and yet remain alive in the other's consciousness, every shared memory intact; they were that close.He found himself frightened by the timeless web of that closeness, broke his gaze away from her.The web contained gaps, he knew.His fear arose from the newest of those gaps.He felt their lives beginning to separate and wondered: How can I tell her of this thing which has happened only to me?He peered out over the desert, seeing the deep shadows behind the barachans   those high, crescent shaped migratory dunes which moved like waves around Arrakis.This was Kedem, the inner desert, and its dunes were rarely marked these days by the irregularities of a giant worm's progress.Sunset drew bloody streaks over the dunes, imparting a fiery light to the shadow edges.A hawk falling from the crimson sky captured his awareness as it captured a rock partridge in flight.Directly beneath him on the desert floor plants grew in a profusion of greens, watered by a qanat which flowed partly in the open, partly in covered tunnels.The water came from giant windtrap collectors behind him on the highest point of rock.The green flag of the Atreides flew openly there.Water and green.The new symbols of Arrakis: water and green.A diamond shaped oasis of planted dunes spread beneath his high perch, focusing his attention into sharp Fremen awareness.The bell call of a nightbird came from the cliff below him, and it amplified the sensation that he lived this moment out of a wild past.Nous avons change tout cela, he thought, falling easily into one of the ancient tongues which he and Ghanima employed in private."We have altered all of that. "He sighed.Oublier je ne puis."I cannot forget. "Beyond the oasis, he could see in this failing light the land Fremen called "The Emptiness"   the land where nothing grows, the land never fertile.Water and the great ecological plan were changing that.There were places now on Arrakis where one could see the plush green velvet of forested hills.Forests on Arrakis!Some in the new generation found it difficult to imagine dunes beneath those undulant green hills.To such young eyes there was no shock value in seeing the flat foliage of rain trees.But Leto found himself thinking now in the Old Fremen manner, wary of change, fearful in the presence of the new.He said: "The children tell me they seldom find sandtrout here near the surface anymore. ""What's that supposed to indicate?"Ghanima asked.There was petulance in her tone."Things are beginning to change very swiftly," he said.Again the bird chimed in the cliff, and night fell upon the desert as the hawk had fallen upon the partridge.Night often subjected him to an assault of memories   all of those inner lives clamoring for their moment.Ghanima didn't object to this phenomenon in quite the way he did.She knew his disquiet, though, and he felt her hand touch his shoulder in sympathy.He struck an angry chord from the baliset.How could he tell her what was happening to him?Within his head were wars, uncounted lives parceling out their ancient memories: violent accidents, love's languor, the colors of many places and many faces...the buried sorrows and leaping joys of multitudes.He heard elegies to springs on planets which no longer existed, green dances and firelight, wails and halloos, a harvest of conversations without number.Their assault was hardest to bear at nightfall in the open."Shouldn't we be going in?"she asked.He shook his head, and she felt the movement, realizing at last that his troubles went deeper than she had suspected.Why do I so often greet the night out here?he asked himself.He did not feel Ghanima withdraw her hand."You know why you torment yourself this way," she said.He heard the gentle chiding in her voice.Yes, he knew.The answer lay there in his awareness, obvious: Because that great known unknown within moves me like a wave.He felt the cresting of his past as though he rode a surfboard.He had his father's time spread memories of prescience superimposed upon everything else, yet he wanted all of those pasts.He wanted them.And they were so very dangerous.He knew that completely now with this new thing which he would have to tell Ghanima.The desert was beginning to glow under the rising light of First Moon.He stared out at the false immobility of sand furls reaching into infinity.To his left, in the near distance, lay The Attendant, a rock outcropping which sandblast winds had reduced to a low, sinuous shape like a dark worm striking through the dunes.Someday the rock beneath him would be cut down to such a shape and Sietch Tabr would be no more, except in the memories of someone like himself.He did not doubt that there would be someone like himself."Why're you staring at The Attendant?"Ghanima asked.He shrugged.In defiance of their guardians' orders, he and Ghanima often went to The Attendant.They had discovered a secret hiding place there, and Leto knew now why that place lured them.Beneath him, its distance foreshortened by darkness, an open stretch of qanat gleamed in moonlight; its surface rippled with movements of predator fish which Fremen always planted in their stored water to keep out the sandtrout."I stand between fish and worm," he murmured."What?"He repeated it louder.She put a hand to her mouth, beginning to suspect the thing which moved him.Her father had acted thus; she had but to peer inward and compare.Leto shuddered.Memories which fastened him to places his flesh had never known presented him with answers to questions he had not asked.He saw relationships and unfolding events against a gigantic inner screen.The sandworm of Dune would not cross water; water poisoned it.Yet water had been known here in prehistoric times.White gypsum pans attested to bygone lakes and seas.Wells, deep drilled, found water which sandtrout sealed off.As clearly as if he'd witnessed the events, he saw what had happened on this planet and it filled him with foreboding for the cataclysmic changes which human intervention was bringing.His voice barely above a whisper, he said: "I know what happened, Ghanima. "She bent close to him."Yes?""The sandtrout... "He fell silent and she wondered why he kept referring to the haploid phase of the planet's giant sandworm, but she dared not prod him."The sandtrout," he repeated, "was introduced here from some other place.This was a wet planet then.They proliferated beyond the capability of existing ecosystems to deal with them.Sandtrout encysted the available free water, made this a desert planet...and they did it to survive.In a planet sufficiently dry, they could move to their sandworm phase. ""The sandtrout?"She shook her head, not doubting him, but unwilling to search those depths where he gathered such information.And she thought: Sandtrout?Many times in this flesh and other had she played the childhood game, poling for sandtrout, teasing them into a thin glove membrane before taking them to the deathstill for their water.It was difficult to think of this mindless little creature as a shaper of enormous events.Leto nodded to himself.Fremen had always known to plant predator fish in their water cisterns.The haploid sandtrout actively resisted great accumulations of water near the planet's surface; predators swam in that qanat below him.Their sandworm vector could handle small amounts of water   the amounts held in cellular bondage by human flesh, for example.But confronted by large bodies of water, their chemical factories went wild, exploded in the death transformation which produced the dangerous melange concentrate, the ultimate awareness drug employed in a diluted fraction for the sietch orgy.That pure concentrate had taken Paul Muad'Dib through the walls of Time, deep into the well of dissolution which no other male had ever dared.Ghanima sensed her brother trembling where he sat in front of her."What have you done?"she demanded.But he would not leave his own train of revelation."Fewer sandtrout   the ecological transformation of the planet... ""They resist it, of course," she said, and now she began to understand the fear in his voice, drawn into this thing against her will."When the sandtrout go, so do all the worms," he said."The tribes must be warned. ""No more spice," she said.Words merely touched high points of the system danger which they both saw hanging over human intrusion into Dune's ancient relationships."It's the thing Alia knows," he said."It's why she gloats. ""How can you be sure of that?""I'm sure. "Now she knew for certain what disturbed him, and she felt the knowledge chill her."The tribes won't believe us if she denies it," he said.His statement went to the primary problem of their existence: What Fremen expected wisdom from a nine year old?Alia, growing farther and farther from her own inner sharing each day, played upon this."We must convince Stilgar," Ghanima said.As one, their heads turned and they stared out over the moonlit desert.It was a different place now, changed by just a few moments of awareness.Human interplay with that environment had never been more apparent to them.They felt themselves as integral parts of a dynamic system held in delicately balanced order.The new outlook involved a real change of consciousness which flooded them with observations.As Liet Kynes had said, the universe was a place of constant conversation between animal populations.The haploid sandtrout had spoken to them as human animals."The tribes would understand a threat to water," Leto said."But it's a threat to more than water.It's a  " She fell silent, understanding the deeper meaning of his words.Water was the ultimate power symbol on Arrakis.At their roots Fremen remained special application animals, desert survivors, governance experts under conditions of stress.And as water became plentiful, a strange symbol transfer came over them even while they understood the old necessities."You mean a threat to power," she corrected him."Of course. ""But will they believe us?""If they see it happening, if they see the imbalance. ""Balance," she said, and repeated her father's words from long ago: "It's what distinguishes a people from a mob. "Her words called up their father in him and he said: "Economics versus beauty   a story older than Sheba. "He sighed, looked over his shoulder at her."I'm beginning to have prescient dreams, Ghani. "A sharp gasp escaped her.He said: "When Stilgar told us our grandmother was delayed   I already knew that moment.Now my other dreams are suspect. ""Leto... "She shook her head, eyes damp."It came later for our father.Don't you think it might be  "  "I've dreamed myself enclosed in armor and racing across the dunes," he said."And I've been to Jacurutu. ""Jacu... "She cleared her throat."That old myth!""A real place.Ghani!I must find this man they call The Preacher.I must find him and question him. ""You think he's...our father?""Ask yourself that question. ""It'd be just like him," she agreed, "but... ""I don't like the things I know I'll do," he said."For the first time in my life I understand my father. "She felt excluded from his thoughts, said: "The Preacher's probably just an old mystic. ""I pray for that," he whispered."Oh, how I pray for that!"He rocked forward, got to his feet.The baliset hummed in his hand as he moved."Would that he were only Gabriel without a horn. "He stared silently at the moonlit desert.She turned to look where he looked, saw the foxfire glow of rotting vegetation at the edge of the sietch plantings, then the clean blending into lines of dunes.That was a living place out there.Even when the desert slept, something remained awake in it.She sensed that wakefulness, hearing animals below her drinking at the qanat.Leto's revelation had transformed the night: this was a living moment, a time to discover regularities within perpetual change, an instant in which to feel that long movement from their Terranic past, all of it encapsulated in her memories."Why Jacurutu?"she asked, and the flatness of her tone shattered the mood."Why...I don't know.When Stilgar first told us how they killed the people there and made the place tabu, I thought...what you thought.But danger comes from there now...and The Preacher. "She didn't respond, didn't demand that he share more of his prescient dreams with her, and she knew how much this told him of her terror.That way led to Abomination and they both knew it.The word hung unspoken between them as he turned and led the way back over the rocks to the sietch entrance.Abomination.= = = = = =   The Universe is God's.It is one thing, a wholeness against which all separations may be identified.Transient life, even that self aware and reasoning life which we call sentient, holds only fragile trusteeship on any portion of the wholeness.Commentaries from the C. E. T.(Commission of Ecumenical Translators)   Halleck used hand signals to convey the actual message while speaking aloud of other matters.He didn't like the small anteroom the priests had assigned for this report, knowing it would be crawling with spy devices.Let them try to break the tiny hand signals, though.The Atreides had used this means of communication for centuries without anyone the wiser.Night had fallen outside, but the room had no windows, depending upon glowglobes at the upper corners."Many of those we took were Alia's people," Halleck signaled, watching Jessica's face as he spoke aloud, telling her the interrogation still continued."It was as you anticipated then," Jessica replied, her fingers winking.She nodded and spoke an open reply: "I'll expect a full report when you're satisfied, Gurney. ""Of course, My Lady," he said, and his fingers continued: "There is another thing, quite disturbing.Under the deep drugs, some of our captives talked of Jacurutu and, as they spoke the name, they died. ""A conditioned heart stopper?"Jessica's fingers asked.And she said: "Have you released any of the captives?""A few, My Lady   the more obvious culls. "And his fingers darted: "We suspect a heart compulsion but are not yet certain.The autopsies aren't completed.I thought you should know about this thing of Jacurutu, however, and came immediately. ""My Duke and I always thought Jacurutu an interesting legend probably based on fact," Jessica's fingers said, and she ignored the usual tug of sorrow as she spoke of her long dead love."Do you have orders?"Halleck asked, speaking aloud.Jessica answered in kind, telling him to return to the landing field and report when he had positive information, but her fingers conveyed another message: "Resume contact with your friends among the smugglers.If Jacurutu exists, they'll support themselves by selling spice.There'd be no other market for them except the smugglers. "Halleck bowed his head briefly while his fingers said: "I've already set this course in motion, My Lady. "And because he could not ignore the training of a lifetime, added: "Be very careful in this place.Alia is your enemy and most of the priesthood belongs to her. ""Not Javid," Jessica's fingers responded."He hates the Atreides.I doubt anyone but an adept could detect it, but I'm positive of it.He conspires and Alia doesn't know of it. ""I'm assigning additional guards to your person," Halleck said, speaking aloud, avoiding the light spark of displeasure which Jessica's eyes betrayed."There are dangers, I'm certain.Will you spend the night here?""We'll go later to Sietch Tabr," she said and hesitated, on the point of telling him not to send more guards, but she held her silence.Gurney's instincts were to be trusted.More than one Atreides had learned this, both to his pleasure and his sorrow."I have one more meeting   with the Master of Novitiates this time," she said."That's the last one and I'll be happily shut of this place. "= = = = = =   And I beheld another beast coming up out of the sand; and he had two horns like a lamb, but his mouth was fanged and fiery as the dragon and his body shimmered and burned with great heat while it did hiss like the serpent.Revised Orange Catholic Bible   He called himself The Preacher, and there had come to be an awesome fear among many on Arrakis that he might be Muad'Dib returned from the desert, not dead at all.Muad'Dib could be alive; for who had seen his body?For that matter, who saw any body that the desert took?But still   Muad'Dib?Points of comparison could be made, although no one from the old days came forward and said: "Yes, I see that this is Muad'Dib.I know him. "Still...Like Muad'Dib, The Preacher was blind, his eye sockets black and scarred in a way that could have been done by a stone burner.And his voice conveyed that crackling penetration, that same compelling force which demanded a response from deep within you.Many remarked this.He was lean, this Preacher, his leathery face seamed, his hair grizzled.But the deep desert did that to many people.You had only to look about you and see this proven.And there was another fact for contention: The Preacher was led by a young Fremen, a lad without known sietch who said, when questioned, that he worked for hire.It was argued that Muad'Dib, knowing the future, had not needed such a guide except at the very end, when his grief overcame him.But he'd needed a guide then; everyone knew it.The Preacher had appeared one winter morning in the streets of Arrakeen, a brown and ridge veined hand on the shoulder of his young guide.The lad, who gave his name as Assan Tariq, moved through the flint smelling dust of the early swarming, leading his charge with the practiced agility of the warren born, never once losing contact.It was observed that the blind man wore a traditional bourka over a stillsuit which bore the mark about it of those once made only in the sietch caves of the deepest desert.It wasn't like the shabby suits being turned out these days.The nose tube, which captured moisture from his breath for the recycling layers beneath the bourka, was wrapped in braid, and it was the black vine braid so seldom seen anymore.The suit's mask across the lower half of his face carried green patches etched by the blown sand.All in all, this Preacher was a figure from Dune's past.Many among the early crowds of that winter day had noted his passage.After all, a blind Fremen remained a rarity.Fremen Law still consigned the blind to Shai Hulud.The wording of the Law, although it was less honored in these modem, water soft times, remained unchanged from the earliest days.The blind were a gift to Shai Hulud.They were to be exposed in the open bled for the great worms to devour.When it was done   and there were stories which got back to the cities   it was always done out where the largest worms still ruled, those called Old Men of the Desert.A blind Fremen, then, was a curiosity, and people paused to watch the passing of this odd pair.The lad appeared about fourteen standard, one of the new breed who wore modified stillsuits; it left the face open to the moisture robbing air.He had slender features, the all blue spice tinted eyes, a nubbin nose, and that innocuous look of innocence which so often masks cynical knowledge in the young.In contrast, the blind man was a reminder of times almost forgotten   long in stride and with a wiriness that spoke of many years on the sand with only his feet or a captive worm to carry him.He held his head in that stiff necked rigidity which some of the blind cannot put off.The hooded head moved only when he cocked an ear at an interesting sound.Through the day's gathering crowds the strange pair came, arriving at last on the steps which led up like terraced hectares to the escarpment which was Alia's Temple, a fitting companion to Paul's Keep.Up the steps The Preacher went until he and his young guide came to the third landing, where pilgrims of the Hajj awaited the morning opening of those gigantic doors above them.They were doors large enough to have admitted an entire cathedral from one of the ancient religions.Passing through them was said to reduce a pilgrim's soul to motedom, sufficiently small that it could pass through the eye of a needle and enter heaven.At the edge of the third landing The Preacher turned, and it was as though he looked about him, seeing with his empty eye sockets the foppish city dwellers, some of them Fremen, with garments which simulated stillsuits but were only decorative fabrics, seeing the eager pilgrims fresh off the Guild space transports and awaiting that first step on the devotion which would ensure them a place in paradise.The landing was a noisy place: there were Mahdi Spirit Cultists in green robes and carrying live hawks trained to screech a "call to heaven. "Food was being sold by shouting vendors.Many things were being offered for sale, the voices shouting in competitive stridence: there was the Dune Tarot with its booklets of commentaries imprinted on shigawire.One vendor had exotic bits of cloth "guaranteed to have been touched by Muad'Dib himself!"Another had vials of water "certified to have come from Sietch Tabr, where Muad'Dib lived. "Through it all there were conversations in a hundred or more dialects of Galach interspersed with harsh gutturals and squeaks of outrine languages which were gathered under the Holy Imperium.Face dancers and little people from the suspected artisan planets of the Tleilaxu bounced and gyrated through the throng in bright clothing.There were lean faces and fat, water rich faces.The susurration of nervous feet came from the gritty plasteel which formed the wide steps.And occasionally a keening voice would rise out of the cacophony in prayer   "Mua a a ad'Dib!Mua a a ad'Dib!Greet my soul's entreaty!You, who are God's anointed, greet my soul!Mua a a ad'Dib!"Nearby among the pilgrims, two mummers played for a few coins, reciting the lines of the currently popular "Disputation of Armistead and Leandgrah. "The Preacher cocked his head to listen.The Mummers were middle aged city men with bored voices.At a word of command, the young guide described them for The Preacher.They were garbed in loose robes, not even deigning to simulate stillsuits on their water rich bodies.Assan Tariq thought this amusing, but The Preacher reprimanded him.The mummer who played the part of Leandgrah was just concluding his oration: "Bah!The universe can be grasped only by the sentient hand.That hand is what drives your precious brain, and it drives everything else that derives from the brain.You see what you have created, you become sentient, only after the hand has done its work!"A scattering of applause greeted his performance.The Preacher sniffed and his nostrils recorded the rich odors of this place: uncapped esters of poorly adjusted stillsuits, masking musks of diverse origin, the common flinty dust, exhalations of uncounted exotic diets, and the aromas of rare incense which already had been ignited within Alia's Temple and now drifted down over the steps in cleverly directed currents.The Preacher's thoughts were mirrored on his face as he absorbed his surroundings: We have come to this, we Fremen!A sudden diversion rippled through the crowd on the landing.Sand Dancers had come into the plaza at the foot of the steps, half a hundred of them tethered to each other by elacca ropes.They obviously had been dancing thus for days, seeking a state of ecstasy.Foam dribbled from their mouths as they jerked and stamped to their secret music.A full third of them dangled unconscious from the ropes, tugged back and forth by the others like dolls on strings.One of these dolls had come awake, though, and the crowd apparently knew what to expect."I have see ee een!"the newly awakened dancer shrieked."I have see ee een!"He resisted the pull of the other dancers, darted his wild gaze right and left."Where this city is, there will be only sand!I have see ee een!"A great swelling laugh went up from the onlookers.Even the new pilgrims joined it.This was too much for The Preacher.He raised both arms and roared in a voice which surely had commanded worm riders: "Silence!"The entire throng in the plaza went still at that battle cry.The Preacher pointed a thin hand toward the dancers, and the illusion that he actually saw them was uncanny."Did you not hear that man?Blasphemers and idolaters!All of you!The religion of Muad'Dib is not Muad'Dib.He spurns it as he spurns you!Sand will cover this place.Sand will cover you. "Saying this, he dropped his arms, put a hand on his young guide's shoulder, and commanded: "Take me from this place. "Perhaps it was The Preacher's choice of words: He spurns it as he spurns you!Perhaps it was his tone, certainly something more than human, a vocality trained surely in the arts of the Bene Gesserit Voice which commanded by mere nuances of subtle inflection.Perhaps it was only the inherent mysticism of this place where Muad'Dib had lived and walked and ruled.Someone called out from the landing, shouting at The Preacher's receding back in a voice which trembled with religious awe: "Is that Muad'Dib come back to us?"The Preacher stopped, reached into the purse beneath his bourka, and removed an object which only those nearby recognized.It was a desert mummified human hand, one of the planet's jokes on mortality which occasionally turned up in the sand and were universally regarded as communications from Shai Hulud The hand had been desiccated into a tight fist which ended in white bone scarred by sandblast winds."I bring the Hand of God, and that is all I bring!"The Preacher shouted."I speak for the Hand of God.I am The Preacher. "Some took him to mean that the hand was Muad'Dib's, but others fastened on that commanding presence and the terrible voice   and that was how Arrakis came to know his name.But it was not the last time his voice was heard.= = = = = =   It is commonly reported, my dear Georad, that there exists great natural virtue in the melange experience.Perhaps this is true.There remain within me, however, profound doubts that every use of melange always brings virtue.Me seems that certain persons have corrupted the use of melange in defiance of God.In the words of the Ecumenon, they have disfigured the soul.They skim the surface of melange and believe thereby to attain grace.They deride their fellows, do great harm to godliness, and they distort the meaning of this abundant gift maliciously, surely a mutilation beyond the power of man to restore.To be truly at one with the virtue of the spice, uncorrupted in all ways, full of goodly honor, a man must permit his deeds and his words to agree.When your actions describe a system of evil consequences, you should be judged by those consequences and not by your explanations.It is thus that we should judge Muad'Dib.The Pedant Heresy   It was a small room tinged with the odor of ozone and reduced to a shadowy greyness by dimmed glowglobes and the metallic blue light of a single transeye monitoring screen.The screen was about a meter wide and only two thirds of a meter in height.It revealed in remote detail a barren, rocky valley with two Laza tigers feeding on the bloody remnants of a recent kill.On the hillside above the tigers could be seen a slender man in Sardaukar working uniform, Levenbrech insignia at his collar.He wore a servo control keyboard against his chest.One veriform suspensor chair faced the screen, occupied by a fair haired woman of indeterminate age.She had a heart shaped face and slender hands which gripped the chair arms as she watched.The fullness of a white robe trimmed in gold concealed her figure.A pace to her right stood a blocky man dressed in the bronze and gold uniform of a Bashar Aide in the old Imperial Sardaukar.His greying hair had been closely cropped over square, emotionless features.The woman coughed, said: "It went as you predicted, Tyekanik. ""Assuredly, Princess," the Bashar Aide said, his voice hoarse.She smiled at the tension in his voice, asked: "Tell me, Tyekanik, how will my son like the sound of Emperor Farad'n I?""The title suits him, Princess. ""That was not my question. ""He might not approve some of the things done to gain him that, ahh, title. ""Then again... "She turned, peered up through the gloom at him."You served my father well.It was not your fault that he lost the throne to the Atreides.But surely the sting of that loss must be felt as keenly by you as by any  "  "Does the Princess Wensicia have some special task for me?"Tyekanik asked.His voice remained hoarse, but there was a sharp edge to it now."You have a bad habit of interrupting me," she said.Now he smiled, displaying thick teeth which glistened in the light from the screen."At times you remind me of your father," he said."Always these circumlocutions before a request for a delicate...ahh, assignment. "She jerked her gaze away from him to conceal anger, asked: "Do you really think those Lazas will put my son on the throne?""It's distinctly possible, Princess.You must admit that the bastard get of Paul Atreides would be no more than juicy morsels for those two.And with those twins gone... "He shrugged."The grandson of Shaddam IV becomes the logical successor," she said."That is if we can remove the objections of the Fremen, the Landsraad and CHOAM, not to mention any surviving Atreides who might  "  "Javid assures me that his people can take care of Alia quite easily.I do not count the Lady Jessica as an Atreides.Who else remains?""Landsraad and CHOAM will go where the profit goes," she said, "but what of the Fremen?""We'll drown them in their Muad'Dib's religion!""Easier said than done, my dear Tyekanik. ""I see," he said."We're back to that old argument. ""House Corrino has done worse things to gain power," she said."But to embrace this...this Mahdi's religion!""My son respects you," she said."Princess, I long for the day when House Corrino returns to its rightful seat of power.So does every remaining Sardaukar here on Salusa.But if you  "  "Tyekanik!This is the planet Salusa Secundus.Do not fall into the lazy ways which spread through our Imperium.Full name, complete title   attention to every detail.Those attributes will send the Atreides lifeblood into the sands of Arrakis.Every detail, Tyekanik!"He knew what she was doing with this attack.It was part of the shifty trickiness she'd learned from her sister, Irulan.But he felt himself losing ground."Do you hear me, Tyekanik?""I hear, Princess. ""I want you to embrace this Muad'Dib religion," she said."Princess, I would walk into fire for you, but this... ""That is an order, Tyekanik!"He swallowed, stared into the screen.The Laza tigers had finished feeding and now lay on the sand completing their toilet, long tongues moving across their forepaws."An order, Tyekanik   do you understand me?""I hear and obey, Princess. "His voice did not change tone.She sighed."Ohh, if my father were only alive... ""Yes, Princess. ""Don't mock me, Tyekanik.I know how distasteful this is to you.But if you set the example... ""He may not follow, Princess. ""He'll follow. "She pointed at the screen."It occurs to me that the Levenbrech out there could be a problem. ""A problem?How is that?""How many people know this thing of the tigers?""That Levenbrech who is their trainer...one transport pilot, you, and of course... "He tapped his own chest."What about the buyers?""They know nothing.What is it you fear, Princess?""My son is, well, sensitive. ""Sardaukar do not reveal secrets," he said."Neither do dead men. "She reached forward and depressed a red key beneath the lighted screen.Immediately the Laza tigers raised their heads.They got to their feet and looked up the hill at the Levenbrech.Moving as one, they turned and began a scrambling run up the hillside.Appearing calm at first, the Levenbrech depressed a key on his console.His movements were assured but, as the cats continued their dash toward him, he became more frenzied, pressing the key harder and harder.A look of startled awareness came over his features and his hand jerked toward the working knife at his waist.The movement came too late.A raking claw hit his chest and sent him sprawling.As he fell, the other tiger took his neck in one great fanged bite and shook him.His spine snapped."Attention to detail," the Princess said.She turned, stiffened as Tyekanik drew his knife.But he presented the blade to her, handle foremost."Perhaps you'd like to use my knife to attend to another detail," he said."Put that back in its sheath and don't act the fool!"she raged."Sometimes, Tyekanik, you try me to the  "  "That was a good man out there, Princess.One of my best. ""One of my best," she corrected him.He drew a deep, trembling breath, sheathed his knife."And what of my transport pilot?""This will be ascribed to an accident," she said."You will advise him to employ the utmost caution when he brings those tigers back to us.And of course, when he has delivered our pets to Javid's people on the transport... "She looked at his knife."Is that an order, Princess?""It is. ""Shall I, then, fall on my knife, or will you take care of that, ahhh, detail?"She spoke with a false calm, her voice heavy: "Tyekanik, were I not absolutely convinced that you would fall on your knife at my command, you would not be standing here beside me   armed. "He swallowed, stared at the screen.The tigers once more were feeding.She refused to look at the scene, continued to stare at Tyekanik as she said: "You will, as well, tell our buyers not to bring us any more matched pairs of children who fit the necessary description. ""As you command, Princess. ""Don't use that tone with me, Tyekanik. ""Yes, Princess. "Her lips drew into a straight line.Then: "How many more of those paired costumes do we have?""Six sets of the robes, complete with stillsuits and the sand shoes, all with the Atreides insignia worked into them. ""Fabrics as rich as the ones on that pair?"she nodded toward the screen."Fit for royalty, Princess. ""Attention to detail," she said."The garments will be dispatched to Arrakis as gifts for our royal cousins.They will be gifts from my son, do you understand me, Tyekanik?""Completely, Princess. ""Have him inscribe a suitable note.It should say that he sends these few paltry garments as tokens of his devotion to House Atreides.Something on that order. ""And the occasion?""There must be a birthday or holy day or something, Tyekanik.I leave that to you.I trust you, my friend. "He stared at her silently.Her face hardened."Surely you must know that?Who else can I trust since the death of my husband?"He shrugged, thinking how closely she emulated the spider.It would not do to get on intimate terms with her, as he now suspected his Levenbrech had done."And Tyekanik," she said, "one more detail. ""Yes, Princess. ""My son is being trained to rule.There will come a time when he must grasp the sword in his own hands.You will know when that moment arrives.I'll wish to be informed immediately. ""As you command, Princess. "She leaned back, peered knowingly at Tyekanik."You do not approve of me, I know that.It is unimportant to me as long as you remember the lesson of the Levenbrech. ""He was very good with animals, but disposable; yes, Princess. ""That is not what I mean!""It isn't?Then...I don't understand. ""An army," she said, "is composed of disposable, completely replaceable parts.That is the lesson of the Levenbrech. ""Replaceable parts," he said.
