No matter the brevity of a trip, the dullness of the terrarium or the people in it, it was important to invent a pattern and a project and pursue it with all his will and imagination.It came to this: shipboard life was still life.All days had to be seized.So the next morning he left the Saturn House after breakfast and walked back to the park, and at the kiosk joined a group going out to track a little elephant herd.After a while Swan too joined them, coming from farther in the park and looking a little flushed, as if she had been running.Their group had with them a device that shifted the elephants subsonic vocalizations up to human hearing levels, and Swan now frowned as she listened to them talking, or singing, as if she understood their language.When the elephants went silent, she asked the zoologist leading their group to explain why the sunlines twilight had gone on so long the previous evening.Quickly Wahram gathered that this biome, being equatorial, should have had a very short twilight, as on Earth the equatorial sun dropped almost perpendicularly to the horizon, no matter the season.The zoologist, surprised that Swan had noticed, explained rather defensively that they were running an experiment that placed their terrarium at a twenty three degree latitude equivalent, because there were great swaths of Earths northern hemisphere along that latitude that were now as hot as the equator had been before Earths warming.Forests were turning into grassland, there was widespread desertification, so the assisted migration movement was investigating the possibility of relocating tropical semiarid populations like this one up to those latitudes.In the hope of giving them some preliminary data, the sunline regime in Wegener had been adjusted accordingly.Swan did not look too satisfied with this explanation, and soon afterward she took off again on her own, ignoring the disappointment of the zoologist and the disapproval of some of the other guests.Wahram saw her later that evening at his restaurant; probably she too practiced some form of the pseudoiterative, as she too traveled a lot; and it was a natural human impulse.Wahram ate at the table next to hers and then went to wash dishes, and though he nodded politely to her, she did not speak.When he was done in the kitchen and went back out for a drink, she had gone.Down the street the bonfire was again burning, the dancers dancing.So that second day had some elements of new habit; but the next afternoon the Wegener was making a close passby of Venus, using it as a gravity handle to help sling it faster out to Jupiter.Wahram took a tram forward to the bulkhead, then with the help of handholds pulled through the nearly weightless passageway to the observation room that bubbled out from the forward end of the asteroid.This chamber had a steady view of the hemisphere of stars arched over themand there, swelling visibly ahead of them, was Venus.Wahram, who at home spent a fair bit of time in micro g like this, balanced happily with one hand holding a strap, eager to watch the second planet pass under them.Swan came in just as they made their final closing, hurrying as usual to avoid being late.Venuss atmosphere was now so reduced in density from its native state that it was transparent, and even though the whole planet was in the shadow of its sunshield and therefore in perpetual night, one could make out the dim white dry ice seas, and the black rock of the two continents partially blown and scraped free.Cloud patterns familiar from Earth and Mars swirled over snowy plains and the dry ice oceans, making a salt and pepper effect that could not be comprehended even with the most intense effort.The observation chamber rang with the sounds of excited and puzzled viewers.Black as high and white as low didnt work very well for the human eye, and it was not that simple anyway.Even at their closest approach it was still a mess of stippling.They angled in at it and then Wegener shot by just above the atmosphere, maximizing the gravity sling.Below passed a cluster of lights that someone said was Port Elizabeth.Nearby there was a town called Billie Holliday, where Wahram had once worked in a giant waldo, covering the dry ice in the lowlands with foamed rock.Now they were doing similar things on Titan.Venus and Titan were really the best remaining candidates to join Mars as fully terraformed worldsshirtsleeve worlds, as some called them, with free atmospheres humans could breathe.The example of Mars showed what could happen: an independent new world, free from all the troubles of the old one.Swan was dancing by herself.I want to go back, she was chanting to no one in particular, or perhaps to her qube.I want to feel the poison wind slap the poison sea.The Venusians had debarked before the swingby, so now Wegener was not as humanly interesting.No bonfires, no all night dances.Wahram spent most of his days in the park; it became the heart of this particular pseudoiterative.They were trying to do a census of its birds and mammals.Often they spotted Swan out there, running by herself.She definitely slept out there, and one night in the kitchen remarked that she never slept indoors if she could avoid it, although of course the entire terrarium was indoors in a certain sense.Out in the park he saw signs that she was also trying to catch some of her food.They once found a rabbit caught in a little snare set by the creek side that spiraled through the park.This kind of thing was illegal, and, more importantly, not done.A few times they also saw the ashes of little fires, with little bones in them not fully burned.Rabbit or fawn, cooked over a little fire One would have to keep an eye out for hyenas if one did that.Surely the excellent south Indian food in his restaurant was preferable.Then one morning they came on Swan still crouched by her little fire, her face greasy and streaks of blood still on her hands, with a small mass of fur there between her feet.She looked up at them with a feral glare, very like the look one would have gotten from a hyena caught in the same moment, and for a long time no one knew quite what to say.Poaching was no more popular with the authorities than it had ever been, Wahram saw with a quick glance at the zoologist, although Swan would not get hung for it; and indeed, because of her founder status here, the locals, all half her age at most, were shuffling around, trying to find a way out of the situation.I guess this is what they meant by the phrase getting caught red handed, Wahram said in his most jovial voice.But please, I want to see those elephants while I can, and they are moving away from us.Im sure the situation here will soon revert to normal.And he walked off in a way that shepherded his guides with him.Better to explore the park in the other direction.Or he could track the little cheetah family.Once he saw Swan doing that too, but did not approach her.It was clear by now that she felt like being alone.In the town, if she came by his restaurant, she ate by herself.Wahram found that a little disappointing.In the pseudoiterative, one performs the ritual of the day attentive to both the joy of the familiar and the shiver of the accidental.To be out at dawn was important.The sunny point in the sunline cast shadows up the cylinder, and overhead flocks of birds flew from one lake to another.The migratory birds pretended to migrate, he was told; they took off at dawn and flew around for most of the day, then came back to where they had begun.Perhaps all his movement was a similar thing.He went forward to the observation bubble when Wegener passed the famous asteroid Programming Error.Here one of the excavators had missed one of its commandsthe AI error perhaps caused by the unlucky hit of a cosmic ray, some postulatedso that after coring its large iron nickel asteroid and leaving the interior space floored by steel, the machinery had looped back on itself and begun to eat the remaining rock of the asteroid across the tube of the first cavity; then every time it broke through to the surface of the asteroid, it turned and dived back in, building and leaving behind more tubing as it went.After a few years it had become clear that this process was never going to stop on its own, as the entire asteroid, considerably reduced, had ended up looking like braided steel rope tied in a knot.Some advocated letting the process go on to see what would happen, but there must have been someone who hadnt agreed with this, because an explosion with an intense electromagnetic pulse had shattered the AI and frozen the thing in the middle of a turn, leaving the excavator snout sticking out of the side like the head of a snake.Indeed at that point the asteroid was a kind of Medusas head, a pretzel sculpture that some considered beautiful and others horrifying, the very image of AI foolishness, or the futility of human effort.Now Wegener flashed by it so fast that the people in the observation bubble could not blink without missing it; it grew from a dot to a basketball to a dot in the course of a single indrawn breath.There were gasps, then cheers.It was in fact a very striking accidental artwork, Wahram judged, so bulging with curves that it seemed to be still squiggling, as if the head of Ouroboros were chasing a reluctant tail, or, as it occurred to him when describing it back in the kitchen, like a tangle of Klein bottles.The next day they flashed by another famous error, and more went forward to see this one than had seen Programming Error, which Wahram found depressing.This terrarium, Yggdrasil, had suffered a catastrophic break; an unnoticed ice filled crack had blown open, in more of an explosion than a leak.Only a few of the inhabitants had survived, something like fifty out of three thousand.It could happen to anyone who did not live on Earth or Mars.Wahram did not care to

and depressed by the horrid ideas of her youth, in this case the savanna pampas Ascensionnot to mention her own poaching in same, caught red handed indeed, the smart ass.But then it got even worse when their taxi unloaded them into a terrarium headed Jupiterward, and it turned out to be the Pleistocene, another of her youthful indiscretions, an ice age north with any number of spavined megafauna resurrected and clomping around in pathetic mutant versions of themselves.Giant short faced bears, looking around in openmouthed confusionalso dire wolves, saber toothed tigers, American cheetahs, mastodons, and woolly mammoths, most of them only semi genuine revivals from ancient DNA, really synthetics, birthed from elephants or lions or Kodiak bears, and thus uneducated in the ways of their kind.It was sad.Swan cursed herself and went feral to get through the remaining week to Jupiter, and almost paid for it with her life; for one thing, it was painfully cold, and then one morning she woke up in a stupidly uncomfortable perch in a tree to find it shaking under the weight of a cat climbing it, a big cat, a who knew whatpossibly just a mountain lion, maybe a snow leopard, it had such long furintent to get to her, and as it was no heavier than she was, it seemed like it could climb the tree high enough to make it happen.Maybe twelve meters to the ground, terrarium spinning at one gfor a second she cursed the long ago shift away from Martian g in terraria, which at first had been the normthen fear drove all thought from her head.Get out of the nest.Get higher than a cat your own weight can get: obviously a problem.She pulled herself up onto the branch over her, which pronged up much more vertically than her sleeping branch.The cat eyed her calmly, not moving yet.Topaz eyes in brindled long white fur; upper lip drawn back, teeth white and hungry.No malice in it.Up the vertical branch, feet deep in forks, painful twists to free herself, up and up.Swaying now in the canopy, all the branches around her equally thin and flexible.Some kind of oak.If she kicked it on the snout when it attacked, possibly it would miss and fall.Foreclaws would latch on to her; her kick would have to twist awaymaybe up.She tried to get higher, couldnt.She was on the Pleistocene.She carried a stun gun.But she had left it in the nest.Shit.The cat began to shift onto Swans branch.Quite a weight to sway it that much.Pauline, any suggestions here?Scare it, Pauline said.Adrenalate fully, then do something bizarre.Swan twisted and let go, fell feetfirst into the face of the cat, screaming as loud as she could.When her feet hit something else, she clasped branches to her and felt something smash into her ribs.Air knocked out of her, no more scream.She scrabbled with her feet for some purchase, found none, looked down.The cat was on the ground, looking up at her.Swan screamed again, felt the stab of a cracked rib.She changed to a raging shout, cursing the cat foully.Kill it like Archilochus.Grating, painful snarl of a voice, bitter shrieking that hurt her throat and screeched unbearably in her own ears, the sound making her aware she had lost it.The cat heaved a heavy sigh and padded away.She climbed back to her nest and retrieved the stun gun.Getting down out of the tree hurt like hell.She avoided Wahram completely after that, and by the time they were dropped off on Callisto, she had become a little fond of that stab in her side.It made her feel better; it was an expression of her grief, her anger.The moment of dread involved was not forgotten, but digested into something else, some kind of triumph.She had almost been eaten for breakfast!She had been a fool and survived yet againhow often it had happened.Surely it was a fate.Surely it would keep on happening.This is the most basic of false syllogisms, Pauline assured her when she spoke the thoughts aloud.The Jovian moons were huge, with Jupiter itself a gargantuan oil painting of overelaborate genius, viscous blobs swirling around from one gorgeous paisley orangerie to the next; every border between the bands was a fantasia beyond compare.Swan loved the sight of it, and the city from which she viewed it wasnt bad either: the Fourth Ring of Valhalla, built on the eponymous rim of the great multi ringed crater.Valhalla had six rings, splashed into the side of Callisto like concentric waves on a pond after a rock is thrown in.The city was located on the top of the fourth ring, extending all the way around; now cities were beginning on the tops of the third and fifth rings as well.It was said that they would eventually tent the entirety of Valhalla and, after that, maybe all the rest of Callisto; and it was a big world.There were even those arguing it could be properly terraformed, despite the lack of a starter atmosphere.It was one big world of four, in fact, because all the Galilean moons were gigantic.But there was some kind of a curse on them, it seemed to Swan; one of them was almost useless, another contested.Io orbited so far within Jupiters ferocious radiation belts that it was never going to be occupied at all except by a few small hardened scientific stations.Europa, a big beautiful ice moon, had a great depth of ice for people to delve into to escape the Jovian radiation, strong even there: wondrous ice palaces, with giant Jupiter always gnarling overheador everyone had thought at first.But it hadnt happened, because there had proved to be aliens living in the ocean below, a complete ecology of algae, chemotrophs, lithotrophs, methanogens, scrapers, suckers, fans, scavengers, and detrivores, all swimming or crawling or holding on or burrowing in; and they created a problem.Some thought they had already contaminated this ocean by their exploratory intrusion into it, because examining it with a drill had been the Lake Vostok problem writ large.But they had done their best to sterilize the probes, and then, having discovered and sampled the full ecology, they had sealed off the hole, and now sat on the surface in scientific stations, culturing and studying their sample populations and pondering whether they should stay or go, and if they stayed, what kind of presence they should have.Possibly the proposed ice palaces would be perfectly fine, with the life below completely sequestered by the ten kilometers of glaciosphere that lay between the moons surface and its ocean.On the other hand, life being life, spermatozoically wriggling into every place it could reach, contamination might almost certainly be assumed to follow any occupation of the moon.And yet, given that these creatures appeared to be cousins of theirs anyway, long separated by meteor voyageand now already recontaminated by a visitwould living above them and continuing to be a minor contaminant clearly be such a bad thing?When there were already people out there swallowing the alien microscopic life, and shooting it into their veins?And when life had been bouncing around the solar system and interacting with its cousins all along?These were open questions, interesting and vivid to the Europans and the other Jovians, less so to the rest of the system.Swan remained somewhat interested from her design days, and she approved their recent decision to go ahead and settle Europa, only perching unobtrusively on top of the internal indigenous aquaria.Now she spent her time walking the High Road that ran all the way round the Fourth Circle of Valhalla, waiting for their flight to Io.She was still avoiding Wahram, who watched her these days with a look of alarmed concern that she could not stand.Jupiter overhead was its usual lurid magnificence.Possibly the Jovians were right to be so self absorbed; they had a whole little solar system here, full of different things.Between the rings of the crater, the surface of Callisto was a vast knobbly white plain, and Jupiter and the three other moons were up there performing their dance.It was a gorgeous space.But they were here to see Wang, so soon she grew impatient for the Io shuttle, and tired of the view overhead.Jove squiggling its buffooneries over and overit was not art but chemistry, mere fractal repetition.The saving grace was that they had recently lit great gas lamps in the upper Jovian atmosphere, to better illuminate the towns located on the Galileans Jovian sides.One could see how these painfully brilliant diamond points were distorting Jupiters cloud tops, adding new swirls and eddies; that made it art, the whole thing a kind of mad goldsworthy.Finally the time came for the shuttle to Io.Swan said, Pauline, are you going to be all right down there?I will be if you are.You definitely need to stay inside the Faraday cage there to stay safe.The Jovians will no doubt tell you that.And during the trip they did, at great length.In a box inside a box, like Russian dolls: they were so proud.Down then to Io, shedding a furious aurora behind their spacecraft, a blaze of transparent blue and green electric banners and flares arcing away as they flew.IO  Io, the innermost moon of Jupiter, as big as Luna.The yellow slag world, awesome upchucking of a moons guts, regurgitation over and over until everything more volatile than sulfur has long since burned off.Sulfur, sulfur everywhere, and nary a place to stand.Four hundred live volcanoes bursting through the slag like angry boils, geysering sulfur dioxide hundreds of kilometers into the air.A moon with an interior hotter than Earthsand try putting your hand in front of the steam coming out of the volcanic vent on Na Kamni, in the caldera of Santorini, to feel just how hot Earth is; it looks like the steam on your stove top, but you will quickly find it is three times hotter.Even though you snatch your hand away instantly, your skin will blister.And Ios interior is thirty times hotter than that.It looks it.A hellworld, flexed hugely in the immense tidal pull between Jupiter and Europa, almost torn apart.Thats gravity at work.Then also Jupiters radiation field is so vast and so strong that Io sizzles inside it; even Deinococcus radiodurans perishes in it.Nothing lives on Io.Except humans, and the little suite of biota they carry everywhere they go.For it is possible to find islands of hard rock in the highlands of the enormous volcanoes, and bore into that rock, and hide a little station.A cube to hold Wangs qube.Everything there must be triply protected, first by physical walls, then by a magnetic field strong enough to counteract Jupiters radiation; but this field itself would be enough to kill, so inside that field a Faraday cage is necessary, to protect you from your protection.Descend in a blue magnetic aurora, a fire of electrons.Below, the moon spreads from a ball to a plain to a tumultuous mountainscape of overlapping volcanoes, the bulky cones hard to spot in all the overlapping swaths of yellow on tan on white on black on brick on bronze, swaths of every burnt color, but most of all, yellow.Here and there scattered rings of black or red or white reveal active vents, pouring out the guts of the interior in irregular circles around the vents; but most of the patches are much less regular, and taken altogether, the surface is a jumble that cannot be resolved by the eye into a topography.It is what it looks like, a molten world, a world on fire.The names humans have applied are redundant.Fire gods, thunder gods, lightning and volcano gods, every combustible deity, from Agni the Hindu god of fire to Volund the German blacksmith of the gods: all these names attempt to humanize the moon, but fail.Io is not a human place.The hard crust on its surface, cooled only by contact with the chill vacuum of space, is so thin that in many places it would not support a standing person.Some early explorers found this out the hard way: walking too far away from their lander, they plunged through the sulfurous ground into red hot lava and disappeared.We think that because we live on cooler planets and moons, we live on safer ground than that.But it is not so.SWAN AND WANG  The station on Io holding Wangs qube and its support team was located high on the flank of Ra Patera, one of the biggest mountains in the solar system.As the ferry descended, the tilt of Ras broad apron came to seem barely off the horizontal.The ferry dropped into a gap in a concrete pad, and a roof then closed over them; from then on they were mostly underground.Everything they could see of the moon on the stations various viewscreens, and through the little windows in the stations little conning tower, was part of the apron of Ra.There were several people in the stations bridge, up in the conning tower.None of them looked up at Swan and Wahram, nor at Wang when he came in.Wang Wei turned out to be a round person with an innocuous manner.A real principal investigator, as Mqaret would have said: one of the systems foremost experts on qubes.Sometimes such individuals were sovereign to quite remarkable little Ruritanias.Swan wondered if Alex had been right in her notion that the solar systems balkanization was a deliberate but unconscious human reaction to qubes, some kind of resistance to their incipient power.Wang greeted Swan and Wahram, and with a quick Ah, thank you, took the envelope from Alex that Swan offered to him.It appeared he had already known about it.He read the letter in it, then plugged the tab that fell from it into the nearest desk.He stared at the desk console for a long time, reading carefully, using a forefinger to keep his place.So sorry to lose Alex, he said to Swan finally.Condolences from the heart.She was the hub of our little wheel, and now we spin off like broken spokes.Surprised at this, Swan said, She told me in her note to me that I should come to you.The messages were left for me in her study.A kind of contingency plan, I guess.And part of it was this envelope for you.Yes.She told me she might do this.And you also loaded a tab into your internal qube, Alex suggests in her note here.Thats right.But my qube wont tell me about it.That was no doubt Alexs instruction.The data are specialized.What you have is a kind of backup, Wang explained apologetically.Swan glared at Wang, and then Wahram, and saw that they were in cahoots, like Wahram and Genette back on Mercury.Tell me whats going on, she demanded.You two were working with Alex on something.The two of them hesitated, and then Wang said, Yes.For many years.Alex was the hub, as I said.We were working with her.But she didnt like being in the cloud, Swan said, gesturing around her at the station.She kept things in her head, right?But you work with qubes, isnt that right?Wangs qube, Wangs algorithm?Yes, Wang said.Wahram said, To stay off the record, Alex had to stay clear of qubes.And for that she needed a qubes help.Thats just the way it is now, and she knew that.Wang nodded.So she chose me.I cant say why.Possibly she thought I have more contact than I really do with what she used to call the league of unaffiliated worlds.I do have a network of contacts like that, but its not comprehensive.No one has an accurate description of the system as it exists now.Is that what Alex wanted?Swan asked.Wahram shook his head.She knew the system as well as anyone could.Wang knows the unaffiliateds, but more importantly, to my mind, his qube is sequestered here.Its contact with the rest of the system is controlled by Wang.Alex liked that, because she was trying to shift all her dealings over to direct human communication.But she left these messages, Swan said.For if she couldnt talk.So she wanted us to talk.For you two to talk to me.Evidently.So tell me what youre up to!The two men glanced at each other.For a long time they stared at the floor.Then Wang looked her in the eye, which caught Swan by surprise.His gaze was intense.No one knows exactly how to deal with this situation, because it has to do with qubes, and you have a qube embedded in you.So Alex would not tell you about this part of things, and I dont want to either.Now that Alexs list of contacts is safely here, we who were working with her can try to proceed with her plans.Swan said, So you have information from Alex, and my qube has information from Alex, but I cant have any information from Alex.Wang looked at Wahram.Wahrams broad face looked as if pins were being stuck into him somewhere.His pop eyed stare, Wangs basilisk intensity: they stood there looking at her.They didnt know what to say to her.They werent going to tell her anything.With a sudden snort Swan waved them away and left the room.There wasnt anywhere to go in this little station to get away, something that occurred to Swan only after she had made her exit.She badly needed to run off her anger in some hills, and here she was trapped in a qube cube, a box of rooms, only a few of which even had windows.Claustrophobia lay always just under her surface, and now, with her anger at the two men and her grief for Alex (and anger at Alex for keeping things from her just because of Pauline), the trapped feeling jumped her and she banged around cursing until she went up in the conning tower to a small room with a view window and was able to slam the door and pound her fists on a table for a while.Her rib hurt quite a bit as she did so, but that was just part of the mix now, the stab of all these other feelings combined.She hurt!Then a movement outside caught her eye.She interrupted her fit and went to the window to look: through her tears she saw the blurry blinking image of a human figure, out on the yellow slag, walking toward the station.It moved oddly, wavering, staggering, blinking from one position to another.Pauline, can someone walk on the surface here?Outside the station?Their suit would have to be as protective as the station is, Pauline said.Pleaseinform station security of your sighting immediately.Surely theyll have seen it?That suit out there may be shielded in many ways.Your visual sighting may be the only indication they have.Please hurry.Arguing with me now is untimely.Swan growled and left the room.After some hurrying around, getting lost, she came to the room Wahram and she had entered first.Theres someone approaching your station on foot, she said to the startled people inside.A few of them began scanning screens very closely.Swan couldnt tell them which direction her window had been facing, and had to take them back to it (just barely recalling the way) to show them.By that time nothing was visible on the slaggy landscape extending downhill from the station.Apparently the people back in the control room werent seeing anything either.Pauline, tell them, Swan said.Pauline said, There was something about three hundred meters downslope.Footprints should still be visible.The figure was moving irregularly  Wang hurried into the room, summoned, no doubt.Lock it down, he said curtly to his people.Ringing alarms went off in every room, painfully high and loud.Quickly the halls filled with people.Swan and Wahram were hustled along a hallway to the lockdown shelter.By the time they got there it was already crowded, and after they pushed their way in, the door was closed; apparently everyone was accounted for.Now they were inside the smallest Russian doll of all.There were screens on one wall, and Pauline helped the station AI direct the stations surveillance cameras.Soon enough one screen zoomed in on a view downslope: there, far down the rumpled and tilted plain of slag, a tiny figure was hopping downhill.Not a good idea, Wang said.The crust thins down there.And then the distant figure sank into a brief flare and disappeared.Keep looking around the station, Wang said after a shocked silence.See if there is anyone else out there.And put up a drone to have a look around for a hopper.The people in the room watched the screens in a grave silence.If the Faraday cage were to lose power, they would be cooked very quickly, every cell in them burst by Jupiters radiation.But nothing seemed to have happened.The stations power seemed secure, and there was no one else to be seen in the surrounding area.Then there was a stir across the room.Call from a ship requesting to land!someone said.Who are they?Its an Interplan ship, Swift Justice.Make sure its really them.The image of an incoming ship was shifted to a larger screen, and everyone watched as a small spaceship flared down into the hole in the stations landing pad.Shortly thereafter a helmeted face appeared right in front of a surveillance camera lens in the landing bay, filling the screen to provide a retinal scan, then waving and giving them a brief thumbs up.Friends, apparently.They were let in, and there in the doorway stood three people, helmets off, one of them a small.Swan was startled to recognize the inspector who had visited them at Mqarets laboratory: Jean Genette.Youre late, Wang said.Sorry, Genette replied.We were detained.Tell me what happened.Wang made his account brief, ending, It appears to have been a single intruder.It approached and then went downslope and fell through the crust.We havent found any hoppers yet.Genettes head was tilted to the side.It just ran downslope to its death?Apparently so.The inspector looked up at his companions.We need to pull whatever remains of it out of the lava.Then, to Wang and the others: Back shortly.Maybe you should stay in lockdown a little longer.And the three of them disappeared back toward the station lock.All right, Swan said heavily, staring hard at Wahram in particular.Tell me whats going on.Im not sure, Wahram said.We were just attacked!I guess so.You guess so?Wang spoke while still reading their screens.A very ineffective attack, I must say.So who would want to attack you?Swan asked.And how did this Inspector Genette get here so fast?And does this have anything to do with what you were doing with Alex?Wahram said, Its hard to tell at this point, and Swan interrupted by punching him in the arm.Quit it, she said viciously.Tell me whats going on!She looked around the packed room: twelve or fifteen people all crowded in there, but now ostentatiously focused on their own affairs, leaving Wang and his visitors alone at a small table in a corner.Tell me or Ill start screaming.She let out a little shriek to show them what could happen, and people all over the room jumped and looked their way, or tried not to.Wahram glanced at Wang.Let me try, he said.All yours, Wang said.Wahram tapped on the table screen and called up a schematic of the solar system, a three dimensional image that seemed to float inside the table.Spheres of bright holographic colors made something like the familiar solar system orrery, though this one had many more colored spheres in it, Swan saw, and a great number of colored lines connecting these spheres.Also, the spheres were not sized in proportion to the real sizes of the planets and moons.This image was generated from Alexs analysis, Wahram told Swan.Its an attempt to show power, and the potential for power.A kind of Menard graphic.The size of the spheres is determined by a compound function of the factors Alex considered important.Swan spotted Mercury, down by the sun, small and red.The Mondragon members were all red, making a constellation of red dots scattered through the systemall small, but there were a lot of them.Earth was huge and multicolored, a bundling of spheres, like a bunch of helium balloons tugging at a fist.Mars was a single green sphere, almost as big as Earth.Colored lines connecting spheres made webs that were dense through the system out to Saturn, sparser beyond that.What factors?Swan asked, trying to calm herself.She was still rattled, more by the appearance of Genette than by the attack.Wahram said, Accumulated capital, population, bioinfrastructure health, terraforming status and stability, mineral and volatile resources, treaty relations, military equipment.We can give you the details of the heuristic later.What you can see immediately is that Mars, and Earth, considered as a collective, are tremendously larger than any other powers at this point.And China, the big pink ball, is a very big fraction of Earths power.Venus, meanwhile, has such great potential that its hard to represent, because at present it has nothing like the power its going to have.Venus and China are colored pink because they both have good relations with the Mondragon.You can see that there is potential in the China Venus Mondragon nexus for the largest power of all.Alex often said that Chinese dominance is the default norm throughout history, except for the brief period of subjugation to Europe.That may be putting it too strongly, but the image speaks for itself concerning the current situation.Also, notice the smallness of almost all the other space settlements.Even taken together, they are still small.However, if you amp up their terraforming potential in the calculation, as I will do nowthen look: Venus, Luna, the Jovian Galileans not counting Io, Titan, and Triton get much bigger.They represent the largest opportunities for more power in space.The asteroids are for the most part filled.So in near term potential, Venus and the big moons are the new powers.And Venus will soon be fully habitable and experiencing a growth spurt, so things are already getting strange there and destabilizing things on Earth.So what was Alexs concern?Swan asked.And what was she proposing to do about it?Wahram took a deep breath, let it out.She saw an unstable system, headed for a crash unless some corrections were made.She wanted to stabilize things.And she thought the fundamental source of trouble was Earth.He stared at the image for a while, which made the point very effectively; there, in the middle of all the clear primary colors, the party balloon jumble that represented Earth was so garish it almost vibrated.So she wanted to do what?Swan asked, feeling a stab of worry.Are you saying she wanted to change things on Earth?Yes, Wahram said firmly.She did.She knew, of course, that this desire is a famous mistake for spacers to make.An impossible project, sure to go wrong.But she thought we might have enough leverage by now to make a difference.She had a plan.A lot of us felt like it was a bit of the tail wagging the dog, you know.But Alex was persuasive that we would never be safe until Earth was in better shape.So we were going along with her.What does that mean?Weve been stockpiling food and animals in the terraria, and setting up Terran offices in friendly countries there.There were agreements.But now thats been complicated by Alexs death, because she did so much of it in person.They were verbal agreements.She didnt trust qubes, I know that.Right.Why not?Well, I Perhaps I shouldnt really say now.After an uncomfortable pause, Swan said, Tell me.When he raised his eyes and met her gaze, she gave him the look Alex would have given himshe could feel it coursing through her.Alex had been able to make people talk with a look.But it was Wang who answered her.It has to do with some funny stories about qubes, he said carefully.On Venus and in the asteroid belt.Those incidents are being looked into by Inspector Genette and his team.Sohe gestured at the doorwaythis may be another part of that.So until they learn more, let us leave that matter alone for now.Also assuming your internal qube is recording all this?If you could get it to keep the recording locked, that would be best.Wahram said to Wang, Show Swan the image of the system with qube power included.Wang nodded and tapped at the tables image.This one tries to include both qubes and classical AIs.It hopes to give an image of how much of our civilization is run by artificial intelligence.Qubes dont run anything, Swan objected.They dont make any decisions.Wang frowned.Some things they do decide, actually.When to launch a ferry, for instance, or how to allot the goods and services in the Mondragonthings like that.Most of the work of the systems infrastructure, as it turns out.But they dont decide to run it, Swan said.I know what you mean, but look at the image.In this version, he explained, red designated human power, blue the power of computers, with light blue marking classical computers, and dark blue quantum computers.A big dark blue ball appeared near Jupiter, and there were other blue dots scattered everywhere, most netted in a single web.Humans appeared as clumps of red, fewer and smaller than the blue dots, with far fewer red lines between them.Whats the blue ball around Jupiter?Swan asked.Is that you?Yes, Wang said.And so now someone has attacked this rather immense blue ball.Yes.Wang was frowning heavily as he stared into the table.But we dont know who, or why.After a silence, Wahram said, Images like this one were part of what concerned Alex.She initiated some efforts to come to grips with the situation.Lets leave it at that for now, please.I hope you understand.His froggy eyes popped more than ever with the force of his entreaty.He was sweating.Swan glared at him for a while, then shrugged.She wanted to argue and realized again that it felt good to find something besides Alexs death to be angry at.Pretty much anything would do.But in the end it wouldnt help.Wahram tried to return the subject to Earth: Alex said we should think of Earth as our sun.We all revolve around it, and it exerts a huge drag on us.And because of the individual need spacers have for their sabbaticals, we cant just ignore it.For any number of reasons we cant do that, Wang pointed out.True, Wahram said.So.We are determined to keep her projects going.You can help with that.Your qube now has her contact list.Itll take a big effort to keep that whole group on board.We could use your help.Swan, unsatisfied with this kind of generality, inspected the new image again.Finally she said, Who did she work with most on Earth?Wahram shrugged.Many people.But her main contact there was Zasha.Really?Swan said, startled.My Zasha?Yours in what sense?Well, we were partners once.I didnt know that.Well, Alex certainly relied on Zasha for a sense of the situation on Earth.Swan had been vaguely aware that Zasha did things with the Mercury House in Manhattan, but she had never heard Alex or Zasha speak of each other.It was another new thing to learn about Alex, and it suddenly occurred to Swan that this was the way it would happen from now on; she would not learn things from Alex, but about her.That was the way Alex would live on, and small though it was, it was better than nothing.Better than the void.And if Zasha had been working with her  All right, Swan said.When your inspector lets us out of here, Im going to Earth.Wahram nodded uncertainly.Swan said, What will you do?He shrugged.I have to go to Saturn and report.Will I see you again?Yes, thank you.Although he looked a little alarmed at the idea.Ill soon be returning to Terminator.The Saturn League council has been contacted by the Vulcanoids, who it turns out also had some verbal agreements with Alex.There are Vulcanoid light transfers out to Saturn in the works, and I am currently the leagues inner planet ambassador.So Ill see you when you return to Mercury.Extracts (2)  to simplify history would be to distort reality.By the early twenty fourth century there was too much going on to be either seen or understood.Assiduous attempts by contemporary historians to achieve an agreed upon paradigm foundered, and we are no different now, looking back at them.Its hard even to assemble enough data to make a guess.There were thousands of city states out there pinballing around, each with its presence in the data cloud or absence from same, and all of them adding up towhat?To the same mishmash history has been all along, but now elaborated, mathematicized, efflorescedin the word of the time, balkanized.No description can be  instability nodes, when many pressured stresses rupture at oncein this case the withdrawal of Mars from the Mondragon, its counterimperial campaign on Earth, and the return of the Jovian moons to the larger interplanetary scene.As the first settlements beyond Mars, the Jovians were hampered by path dependency on earlier, less powerful settlement technology, also the discovery of life inside Ganymede and Europa, as well as Jupiters intense radiation.Later more powerful settlement strategies, and terraforming efforts on Venus and Titan, caused the Jovians to reevaluate their stations, domes, and tented Luxembourgs as inadequate.Even with Io permanently off limits, the three other Galilean moons constituted together an enormous potential surface area, and it was the resolution of their inner conflicts and their common commitment to full terraformation that threw the volatiles markets into disarray and triggered the nonlinear breaks of the following two decades  they were now their own unavoidable experiment,

free to leave Io Station, Swan headed to Earth.It turned out that the first transport heading downsystem was a blackliner.Feeling the blackness of Alexs absence inside her, Swan decided to take it.Wahram saw her off with his now characteristic expression of alarm.Inside the blackliner, darkness reigned.It was as black as could be, the black one would find inside a cave deep inside the earth.The terrarium was just barely rotating, so there was very low g throughout.People therefore floated in the dark, naked or dressed in clothes or spacesuits.Around buildings and floating pods a blind society bounced carefully, living in a world of sound.Bat people.Sometimes there were interactions, conversations, embraces; sometimes one heard cries for help, and there were sheriffs on patrol to provide aid, using infrared goggles to see what was going on.But for most passengers the point was to be blind for a while.It could be a penance, it could be a bit of mental voyaging; it could be a new kind of sex.Swan didnt know what she wanted out of it.It had sounded right for the way she felt.Now she floated in pure and complete blackness.Her eyes were open and yet she didnt see a thing: not her hand before her face, not a glint of light anywhere.The space she was in seemed as infinite as the cosmos itself, or else just a bag around her head.There were voices here and there, coming from various distances.They all sounded hushed, as if in the dark people naturally whisperedalthough forward along the centerline, it seemed by the faint pull of the g, there was some kind of game or sport being played, with whistles and beeps and shouts of laughter.From another direction came the sounds of guitar and oboe, playing a baroque duet.She jetted toward it cautiously, hoping to hear it better.Halve the distance, double the sound.On the way she passed the paired breath of a couple having sex, or so it seemed.This was a noise that could draw a crowd as much as music or sport.There had been assaults in blackliners; people had done unspeakable things, or so one heard.In fact it was hard to believe anyone would care enough to impinge so drastically on anyone else.Why care that much?What would it do?The continuous pure dark soon began to be marked in her vision by blotches of color, then by memories of sights that seemed to be there in her eye.She closed her eyes, and colored bars redoubled.Color everywhere; it reminded her of that time years before when she had ingested the Enceladan suite of aliens, a crazy act which she usually managed not to remember.The votaries sitting around lit candles; Pauline, newly inside her, warning her not to do it; the little chalice full of Enceladusea irwinii and other Enceladan microscopic life forms; the votary giving it to her and saying, Do you understand?and Swan replying that she did, the biggest lie of her life; the taste of the infusion, like blood; the heave in her stomach; the way after a moment of blackout the candlelight returned and grew too bright to look at; the waves on the beach roar all through her, everything becoming brilliantly stuffed with color, Saturn looking like a confection of mint and cantaloupe.Yes, a period of synesthesia, with all her senses on fire; and at one point she had had the sudden realization that she would never be the same.Infecting herself with an alien, was it wise?No, it was not!Crying out then as if poisoned, trapped in a kaleidoscope, a roaring in her ears, exclaiming over and over, But I wasI was SwanI wasI was Swan  Now she did her best to throw the vivid memory into darkness away from her.She spun weightlessly with the effort, which had caused her to wrench her body into a knot.As she spun, it began to seem that the guitar and oboe she heard were actually at quite a distance from each other.Was it really a duet at all?How would that work if the two of them were half a kilometer apart?There would be a distinct time lag, each for the other.She tried to focus on them, hear if they were in concert or not.In the pure black she would never know.Miserably she realized that this was going to go on for as long as she was in here.No face to cling to with ones gaze, nothing at all to seeher memory and imagination would run riot, her starved senses left to spin hungrily, making things upnothing but her unhappiness for company.Pure being, unadulterated thought, revealing what the phenomenal world could hide but not change: the blank at the heart of things.Her stomach grumbled and she ate part of her belt.She relieved herself in a bag inside her suit and cast the sealed bag toward the ground; janitorbots would sniff it out and take it away.She kept seeing images of Alexs face, and she clung to them as precious memories she would need to hold to forever, but they made her groan too.She mewed like a hurt beast, she couldnt help it.You are perhaps experiencing an episode of hypotyposis, Pauline said aloud.The visionary imagination of things not present before the eyes.Shut up, Pauline.Then, after a while, she said, No, Im sorry.Go on, please.An aporia in some rhetorics is a pretended dubitation before coming back to the attack, as in Gilbert on Joyce.But Aristotle has it as an insoluble problem in an inquiry, arising from equally plausible but inconsistent premises.He writes that Socrates liked to reduce people to aporia to show them they didnt really know what they thought they knew.The plural that Aristotle uses in his book on metaphysics is aporiai.We should first review the things about which we need from the outset to be puzzled, he writes.The word aporia was later adapted by Derrida to mean something like the blank spots in our understanding that we dont even know are there, with the idea we should try to see these.It is not quite the same idea, but joins a constellation of meanings for the word.The Oxford English Dictionary references a quote from J.  Smiths Mystical Rhetoric of 1657, which says aporia refers to the problem of what to do or say in some strange or ambiguous thing.Like now.Yes.Listen further.The Greek comes from a, not, and poros, passage.But in the Platonic myth, Penia, the child of poverty, chooses to become impregnated by Poros, the personification of plenty.Their child is Eros, who combines the attributes of its parents.Pointed out as strange here is the vision of Penia as resourceful, and prosperity as drunk and passive  Thats not strange.So that although Penia is not Poros, she is also not a poria.She has been called neither masculine nor feminine, rich or poor, resourceful or without resources.And so aporia becomes even more an untranslatable term.I am an aporia.And I am in an aporia.This blackliner.Yes.All very well, to talk and thinkThank you, Paulinebut at the end of it, there was still a week more to live through, and Alexs death never gone away.She was floating in the bardo, trying to think like someone unborn would think.Full of dubitation, child of a poverty.Would be reborn some other Swan.But then laterit seemed much later, there in the suspended space of no time, banging around in her thoughts as they looped over and overlater she came to understand that when the chime in her suit rang and signaled that this trip was over, they would decant the same Swan that went in.There was no escape.Paulinetell me more.Talk to me.Please talk to me.Pauline said, Max Brod once had a very interesting conversation with Franz Kafka, which he later recounted to Walter Benjamin.Extracts (3)  Homo sapiens evolved in Terran gravity and it is still an open question what effects time spent in less than one g will have on the individual  decrease in bone strength from

were young at the time  most older spacers go home to Earth as advised, one year every seven, because these are the ones living the longest and the effect is self reinforcing  the hunt continues for a fuller explanation      SWAN AND ZASHA  Earths thirty seven space elevators all had their cars full all the time, both up and down.There were still many spacecraft landings and ascents, of course, and landings of gliders that then reascended on the elevators; but all in all, the elevators handled by far the bulk of the Earth space traffic.Going down in the cars were food (a crucial percentage of the total needed), metals, manufactured goods, gases, and people.Going up were people, manufactured goods, the substances common on Earth but rare in spacethese were many, including things animal, vegetable, and mineral, but chiefly (by bulk) rare earths, wood, oil, and soil.The totals came to quite a flow of physical mass up and down, all powered by the counterbalanced forces of gravity and the rotation of the Earth, with a bit of solar power to make up the difference.The anchor rocks at the upper ends of the elevator cables were like giant spaceliners, as very little of their original asteroidal surfaces were left visible; their exteriors were covered with buildings, power units, elevator loading zones and the like.They were in effect giant harbors and hotels and, as such, extremely busy places.Swan passed through the one called Bolivar and settled into one of the hotel cars without even noticing it; to her it had just been a complicated set of doors and locks and corridors, getting her into yet another set of rooms.She was resigned to the long ride down to Quito.It was an irony of their time that the trip down the elevator cable was going to take longer than many interplanetary voyages, but thats the way it was.Five days stuck in a hotel.She spent the days attending performances of Glasss Satyagraha and Akhnaten, also dancing hard in a grueling class designed to get people toughened up for one g, which sometimes hit her pretty hard.Looking down through the clear floor, she got familiar again with the great bulge of South America, gaining definition below them: blue oceans to each side; the Andes like a brown spine; the little brown cones of the big volcanoes, bereft of all their snow.It was almost an ice free planet now, with only Antarctica and Greenland holding on to much, and Greenland going fast.Sea level was therefore eleven meters higher than it had been before the changes.This inundation of the coastline was one of the main drivers of the human disaster on Earth.They had immensely powerful terraforming techniques off planet, but here they usually couldnt be applied.No slamming comets into it, for instance.So they bubbled their ship wakes with surfactants to create a higher albedo, and had tried various levels of sulfur dioxide injected into the stratosphere, imitating volcanoes; but that had once led to disaster, and now they couldnt agree on how much sunlight to block.Much that people advocated, and many of the smaller projects that were in action already, cut against other proposed or ongoing projects.And there were still powerful nation states that were also corporate conglomerates, the two overlapping in Keynesian disarray, with the residual but powerful capitalist system ruling much of the planet and containing within it its own residual feudalism, there to fight forever against the serfs, meaning also against the horizontalized economy emerging within the Mondragon.No, Earth was a mess, a sad place.And yet still the center of the story.It had to be dealt with, as Alex had always said, or nothing done in space was real.In Quito Swan took the train to the airport and got on an airplane flight to New York.The Caribbeans cobalt and turquoise and jade were brilliantly vivid; even the brown underwater outline of drowned Florida had a jasper sheen.The stunning gloss of Earth itself.A much steelier ocean crashed whitely into Long Island as they descended over it, bumping and slipping in the air.Then they were landing on a runway somewhere on the mainland north of Manhattan, and at last she was out of the various travel containers, the rooms and vehicles and corridors and hallways, and under the open sky.Simply to be outdoors in the open air, under the sky, in the windthis was what she loved most about Earth.Today puffy clouds were massed overhead at about the thousand foot level.Looked like a marine layer rolling in.She ran out into some kind of paved lot filled with trucks and buses and trolley cars, and jumped around screaming at the sky, then kneeled and kissed the ground, made wolf howls, and, after she had hyperventilated a bit, lay on her back on the pavement.No handstandsshe had learned long before that handstands on Earth were really hard.And her rib still hurt.Through gaps in the cloud layer she could see the light but dark blue of the Terran sky, subtle and full.It looked like a blue dome flattened at the center, perhaps a few kilometers above the cloudsshe reached up for italthough knowing too that it was just a kind of rainbow made it glorious.A rainbow that was blue everywhere and covered everything.The blue itself was complex, narrow in range but infinite within that range.It was an intoxicating sight, and you could breathe itone was always breathing it, you had to.The wind shoved it into you!Breathe and get drunk, oh my, to be free of all restraint, minimally clothed, lying on the bare surface of a planet, sucking in its atmosphere as if it were an aqua vitae, feeling in your chest how it kept you alive!No Terran she had ever met properly appreciated their air, or saw their sky for what it was.In fact they very seldom looked at it.She collected herself and walked over to the dock.A big grumbling water ferry took on her and many others, and after negotiating a crowded canal, they were out in the Hudson River and going down to Manhattan.The ferry moved into a dock on Washington Heights, but Swan stayed on it as it plied its way down the Hudson side to midtown.A few parts of Manhattans ground still stood above the water, but most of it was drowned, the old streets now canals, the city an elongated Venice, a skyscraper Venice, a super Venicewhich was a very beautiful thing to be.Indeed it was an oft expressed clich that the city had been improved by the flood.The long stretch of skyscrapers looked like the spine of a dragon.The foreshortening effect as they got closer made the buildings look shorter than they really were, but their verticality was unmistakable and striking.A forest of dolmens!Swan got off the ferry at the Thirtieth Street Pier and walked on the broad catwalk between buildings to the High Line extension, where people filled the long plazas stretching north and south.Manhattan on foot: workers pushing narrow handcarts on crowded skyways, connecting island neighborhoods suspended between skyscrapers at differing heights.The rooftops were garnished with greenery, but the city was mostly a thing of steel and concrete and glassand water.Boats burbled about on the water below the catwalks, in the streets that were now crowded canals.All the aerial plazas and catwalks were jammed with people.As crowded as ever, people said.Swan dodged between the bodies of the crowd, working the border between the two directions of traffic, glorying in all the faces.They were just as heterogeneous as any spacer crowd, but the people were very much closer to an average sizerather short at thatwith many fewer smalls and talls.Asian faces, African, Europeaneveryone but Native Americans, as she always thought in Manhattan.Talk about invasive biology!A building she passed had pumped out its old floor and now operated down there in a kind of big bathtub of air.She had heard that submarine and intertidal real estate was booming.Some spoke of pumping out the subway system, which still worked wherever it had run aboveground.Below her the slop of water threw up a big ambient sound.Human voices, and water splashing, and the cries of gulls back on the docks, and the rush of wind through the canyons of buildings; these were the sounds of the city.The water below was completely chopped up with intersecting wakes.Behind her, down the avenue to the west, mirrorflakes of broken sunlight bounced on the big river.This was the thing she lovedshe was outdoors, truly in the open.Standing on the side of a planet.In the greatest city of all.She hopped down some stairs and got on a vaparetto going down Eighth Avenue.The ferry was a long low slung thing, with seats for about fifty people and room for another hundred to stand.It stopped every few blocks.She hung over the rail and gazed up and down the canal: a river canyon, with buildings for canyon walls.Very Futurismo in appearance.She got off at Twenty Sixth Street where it was bridged by a long esplanade, extending east all the way to the East River.Lots of the east west streets had overhead platforms like this, and the crowded canals under them were shaded almost all day long.When the sunlight slanted through slots, it laid a bronze glaze on things, and the blue water turned pewter.The New Yorkers did not seem to notice this effect, but on the other hand, there were twenty million people living here despite the flood, and Swan thought that beauty was not completely irrelevant to the phenomenon, even if people chose to keep mum about it.Tough guys, it made her laugh.Swan was not a tough guy, and not a New Yorker, and this place was astonishing and she knew the locals knew it.Talk about landscape art!The geography of the world is unified only by human logic and optics,  she chanted,  by the light and color of artifice, by decorative arrangement, by ideas of the good, the true, and the beautiful!You could sing Lowenthals entire oratio on the catwalks of Manhattan, and no one would care.She moved into the sun whenever she could.That was the direct radiation of Sol, slamming into her naked skin.It was amazing to stand in the light of the sun without dying of it.This was the only place in the solar system where that could happen; the bioshell surrounding a star was as thin as a soap bubble.Thickening the life bubblemaybe that was the human project.That they had pulled the bubble out around Mars was a remarkable thing.If they pulled it inward to Venus, even more so.This, however, would always be the sweet spot.No wonder the mystics of this old world, stunned by all lifes changes.Metamorphosis suited Earth, and never stopped.The great flood had become a fortunate fall, had brought on an exfoliation into a higher state.The world had been watered.Flowers popping out of the leafy branch.She was back.The Mercury House was down by the Museum of Modern Art.Many of the museums paintings were now on Mercury, only copies left behind, and in an unusual gesture, a room here was devoted to Mercurial art.The Group of Nine was prominently displayed, of course.It was a little too much sun and rock for Swan.And she always found it odd to see canvas used as the medium, a bit like looking at scrimshaw or other antique exotica.When you had the world and your body as canvases, why deal in squares of wallpaper?It was peculiar, but as a result perhaps interesting as well.Alex and Mqaret had held a reception for the Nine once, and Swan had met many of them and enjoyed talking to them.Up on the roof patio of the Mercury House building, maybe thirty stories above the water, she found a number of Mercurials gathered at the bar.Most of them wore exoskeletons or body bras, which, whether hidden by clothing or not, were evident to Swan by the way the people wearing them stood, resting comfortably slightly off true, as if in water.The ones without were more or less heroically erect, holding off the weight of the Earth with a strained look.Swan felt a little that way herself.No matter what you did, one g imposed itself on your attention for a while.Their New York office was headed by an ancient Terran named Milan, who had a sweet smile for everyone.Swan, darling, so good of you to come.Oh my pleasure, I love New York.Well, bless your ignorance, child.Im glad you like it.And Im glad youre here.Come meet some of my new people.So Swan met some of the local team and endured their condolences about Alex, and gave them a brief inaccurate account of her trip to Jupiter.They had ideas about the Mondragon above and beyonds that they shared with her.When they were done, Swan said to Milan, Is Zasha still around?Zasha will never leave this town, Milan said.You must know that.Havent you been to Zs latest scheme?Its on one of the Hudson piers.So Swan took the ferry back up Eighth Avenue, got off, and climbed stairs until she reached a catwalk she could take west.With all the old piers eleven meters underwater, a new set had had to be built.Some were old ones salvaged and stilted; others had been built anew, sometimes using the drowned ones as foundations.Smaller floating docks filled gaps and were attached to piers or nearby buildings at what used to be their fourth floors.Some of these docks were mobile and became like barges as they moved around.It was a tricky shoreline.Some of the submerged docks now held aquaculture pens, and Swans old partner Zasha apparently now ran a pharm on one of these piers, growing various piscean drugs and bioceramics while also doing things for the Mercury Houseand for Alex.Swan had called ahead, and Zasha appeared at the fence that cut a floating dock off from the big plaza complex west of Gansevoort Street, at the south end of the High Line.After a brief hug, Z led her to the end of the dock and then out on the Hudson River in a boat, a smooth little hummer that soon had them midriver.Everything on the water moved at a watery pace, including the water itself.The Hudson River here was wide; the entire city of Terminator would have fit in New York Harbor.Bridges were visible all over the place, including one on the distant southern horizon.There was so much water Swan could hardly believe it; even the open sea did not seem to have so much; and yet it was not even a very big river, compared to the really big ones.Earth!Zasha was observing the scene with a contented expression.Banks of windows at the tops of the highest skyscrapers blazed with reflected sunlight, and all the buildings glowed.Skyscraper island: it was the classic Manhattan look, unlikely and superb.How are things with you?Swan asked.I like this river, Zasha said, as if it were a reply.I motor up to the top of the island, or even to the Palisades, and then just float on down.Throw a line over.Hook the most amazing stuff sometimes.And at Mercury House?Zasha frowned.Spacers are getting blamed for a lot these days.The people down here are resentful.The more we help, the more resentful they get.However, their capital funds keep on investing in us.As always, Swan said.Yes, well, perpetual growth.But nothing lasts forever.The solar system is just as finite as Earth.Do you think its filling up?Hitting carrying capacity?More like investment return peak.But people may be feeling pinched by it.Anyway, theyre acting like theyre pinched.Zashas boat drifted in the ebb tide until it passed the Battery, and the view to the Brooklyn shore opened up.The skyscrapers at the foot of Manhattan looked like a cluster of giant swimmers, gathered knee deep to charge into cold water.Between buildings the water sheeted like glass, and the canals were filled with little boats; the harbor bay too, although not as densely.At any given moment hundreds of watercraft were visible.They could see up both rivers, the Hudson and the East, and between those ran the smaller, straighter rivers of the streets, all under a cloudy sky.A Canaletto vision.Cloud reflections whitened the bays watery sheen.It was so beautiful that Swan felt like she had been cast into a dream, and she reeled a little with the boats rocking.Feeling the g?Zasha asked.I am kind of.Want to spend the night at my place?Im getting kind of hungry.Sure.Thanks.Zasha piloted the boat west across the river to a channel on the Jersey side that led west.It was hard to tell if it was a canal or a creek.Inland the waterway opened up to the north, and Zasha turned up that way and docked at a wooden pier sticking into what looked like a shallow lake.Whole neighborhoods sloped right down into water.The east side of North America had always been a drowned coastline, but now more than ever.A walk up a rise under a violent sunset sky, which was tastelessly mashing orange and pink together.At times like these it was the eastern sky that really put on a show, subtler but more glorious.But no one looked that way.Zashas place was a tiny squat next to a line of trees, as handmade and run down as any favela or shantytown Swan had ever seen.What is this place?Part of the Meadowlands.And youre free to make your own home here?As if!Actually my rent is stupendous, but Mercury House gives me a little supplement to keep me out here away from them.Hard to believe.Anyway, its fine.I like my commute.Swan sat gratefully in a beat up armchair and watched her old partner putter about in the gloom.It had been a long time since they had banged around the solar system, building terraria and raising Zephyr; it had even been a long time since Zephyr had died.And they had never gotten along very well, separating soon after Zephyr went off.Still, Swan recognized the way Zasha hovered over the stove, waiting for the teapot to boil, harboring a secretive knowing look she also recognized.She said, So did you work with Alex?Well, sure, Zasha replied, glancing at her briefly.She was my boss.So you know how that goes.What do you mean?I mean she loved you and took care of you, and you did exactly what she wanted you to.Swan had to laugh.Well, yes.She thought it over, ignoring the pain.Somehow she conformed herself to what you needed.Helped you to get what you needed.Uh huh.I know what you mean.But listennow shes gone, and she left me a message.Basically she used me as a courier to Wang, on Io, and also dumped something into Pauline.It was all in case something happened to her, she said.What do you mean?Swan described the visitation from Alexs ghostthe envelopesher trip out to Jupiter, and the interloper on Io.Zasha said, I heard about that.I didnt know you were there, frowning at the teapot, face blue in the stove top glow.What were you and Alex working on?Swan asked.And why didnt she tell me about it in this message she left?Sheits like I was just a courier for her, and Pauline some kind of safe deposit box.Zasha didnt reply.Come on, tell me, Swan said.You can tell me.I can take it from you.Im used to you telling me how bad I am.Zasha expelled a breath, poured two cups of tea.Steam in gloom, catching light from somewhere.Z handed her one, then sat down on a kitchen chair across from her.Swan warmed her hands on her cup.Theres stuff I cant talk about  Oh come on!and stuff I can.She got me involved in a group that is hunting down some odd qubes.Thats been interesting.But it was something she wanted kept confidential, along with some other things she had going.So, maybe she thought that you arent very good at keeping things confidential.Why would she think that?But even Zasha knew of three or four examples of Swans being indiscreet, and Swan herself knew of several more.Those were accidents, Swan finally added.And not very big accidents either.Zasha sipped the tea cautiously.Well, but maybe they seemed to be becoming more frequent.You are not the same person you used to be, you have to admit.Youve stuffed your brain with augmentations  I have not!Well, four or five.I didnt like it right from the beginning.When you grow the religious part of the temporal lobe, you can turn into a very different person, not to mention risking epilepsy.And that was only the start.Now youve got the animal stuff in there, youve got Pauline in there, recording everything you seeit is not insignificant.It can do damage.You end up being some kind of post human thing.Or at least a different person.Oh come on, Z.  Im the same as I always was.And everything you do can damage you!You cant let that stop you.Every thing Ive done to myself I consider part of being a human being.I mean, who wouldnt do it if they could?I would be ashamed not to!It isnt being post human, its being fully human.It would be stupid not to do the good things when you can, it would be antihuman.Well, Zasha said, you did those things and you immediately stopped designing terraria.I was done!We were past the design phase anyway; they were just going to build more of the same.And a lot of what we did was stupid anyway.We shouldnt have been making Ascensions at that point, we needed to get the traditional biomes past the extinction.We still need that!I dont know what we were thinking, frankly.Zasha was surprised at this.I like the Ascensions.They help genetic dispersion.Too much so.Anyway thats not the point.The point is I wanted to try different things, and I did.You became an artist.I was always an artist.I just changed media.And hardly even that.Just a focusing in.It was what I wanted.Come on, Zasha.Im just living a human life.You refuse these opportunities, that doesnt make you more human, it just makes you regressive.I dont go anywhere near as far as some people.I dont have a third eye and I dont break my ribs when I have an orgasm.I just  Just what?I dont know.Try things that sound good.And have they all worked out for you?Swan sat there in the gloom, somewhere in New Jersey.Outside was the open air of Earth.No.Long pause.In fact Ive done worse things than what you know about, if you want to know the truth.Zasha stared at her.Im not sure I do.Ha ha.And Alex knew about it too, now that I think of it, because I told Mqaret about it.He wouldnt automatically tell her.I didnt ask him not to.Well, Zasha said.So maybe she knew.Something worse than animal brains?Something worse than a qube in your skull?Never mind, I dont want to know.But maybe Alex did, and maybe she had stuff that she  That she didnt trust me with.That she needed to keep to herself.And here you are, kind of a mess.I am not a mess!Though her rib did hurt, squeezed by her indignation.And she was full of grief for Alexand now a little angry at her too.Seems like youre saying you are messed up, Z observed.Youve had five or six or seven brain tweaks over the years, a qube in your headin fact, whatever was fashionable at the time.Yeah yeah.Well think about it!Swan put her teacup on the table.I think Ill go out for a walk.Good.Dont get lost.Ill cook up something while youre out, say about forty five minutes.Swan left the hut.Outside the door she took her slippers off and stuffed them into her pocket, dug her toes into the dirt and wriggled them around.Leaned over from the waist like a dancer and dug her fingers in, put hands to face and breathed.Dirt, the ultimate ambrosia.Tasted like muddy mushrooms.It was after sunset.There was an asphalt road running next to a marsh, green and yellow, the wind bouncing the reeds out there.She walked on the dirt by the side of the road and looked at the marsh and the sky.On the other side of the road some old buildings were nestled under a stand of trees.Rows of old apartment blocks beyond.Croak of frog.She sat on the edge of the marsh and saw the black dots half in and half out of the water under her.A chorus of frogs, croaking.She listened for a while, watching the marsh in the wind, and heard suddenly that they were performing a call and response.If one frog said ribbit, then all the others would repeat it for a while, up and down the road for as far as she could hear, until in a momentary pause one croaked robot, and they would all repeat that for a while.Then it changed to limit, and off the others went, as if speaking to her like some Greek chorus, transmogrified to frogs.So many limits!So many robots.The lump nearest her contributed only once in a while, puffing under his chin briefly, then croaking.Otherwise it was perfectly still, except for a little shift of the eyeballs she could see in the dusk, a liquid blink, always alert.Romper!it croaked in a pause, and Swan exclaimed, Good for you!and said it with them for a while.October on the northern hemisphere of Earth, so glossy and full.All her body planet interfaces humming.Suddenly life in space seemed a stark nightmare, an exile to the vacuum, everyone locked in sensory deprivation tanks, separate, virtual, augmented.Here the real was real.Robber!Robber robber robber robber  The moment itself, robbed from them as it happened.Here she was, passing through a space.Flit of the now.Dusk in a marsh in a transient universe, so strange, so mysterious.Why should anything be like this?The wind was cool, the clouds had a little twilight left in them.Looked like rain.The leaves of the thorny vine on the ground were as red as maple leaves.The marsh was like a person out there breathing.Crows flew over cawing, headed into the town and its heat islands.Swan knew a little of the crow language; they would say to each other, Caw, caw, caw, as now, just chatting, and then one would shout a word out so clearly that it had become an English wordHawk!and they would scatter.Of course the word crow also came from their language.In Sanskrit they had it as kaaga.Imported words from another language.There were some people, standing by the buildings next to the trees.They were small somehow.Weighted down.Could this be so close to the great city?Was it indeed part of the city, part of what made it work, not just the wetlands but the legions of poor marginal people, living in the half drowned ruins?The weight of the planet began to drag her down.Those people over there were like figures out of Brueghel, people from the sixteenth century, bowed down with time.Maybe these were the people living a real life, and what she did in space nothing more than the dilettantism of a gaga aristos.Maybe what she really needed to do was to live here and build things, maybe houses, little but functional, a different kind of goldsworthy.Under the sky, in the full light of the sunthe utter luxury of the real.The only real world.Earth, heaven and hell bothnatural heaven, human hell.How could they have done such a thing, how could they have not tried harder?Maybe they had.Maybe the trying included the flight to space, as some kind of desperate hope.Cast from Earth as if in a seed pod, out to where one was sure to freeze and rot and turn back into soil.This dirt by the side of the road.She lay on it, avoiding the thorny vine; squirmed around as if to burrow into it.A spacer fucking the dirtthey must see that all the time, not be impressed anymore.Those poor lost people, they must think.Because there was nothing like this in space, not reallynot the wind and the big sky over her, almost night now, with moisture that was not yet cloudOh how could they have left!Space was a vacuum, a nothingness.They had inhabited it only by deploying little rooms, little bubbles; the city and the stars, sure, but it wasnt enough!There needed to be a world in between!This was what city people forgot.And indeed off in space they had better forget, or they would go mad.Here one could remember and yet not go madnot exactly.But how sad it was.Grubby, tawdry, beaten down.Pitiful.Sad to distraction, to a stabbing despair.That they had let it come to this.That she had done what she had done to herself.Even Zasha thought she had gone too far, and Z was a very tolerant person.Would have stayed with her, maybe, if she hadnt gone off.And now she was no longer the person Zasha had parented a child with, she could feel that, even though she didnt know exactly what had changed.Unless it was the Enceladan bugs in her In any case a strange person.A person for whom the only place that made her truly happy also made her deeply sad.How was she to reconcile this, what did it mean?She sat up.Sat there on the dirt, feeling it lumpy under her.She saw a motion from the corner of her eye and tried to leap to her feet, misjudged the g and crashed back down.She peered into the gloom:  A face.Two faces: mother and daughter.Here it was such a clear thing; it looked like parthenogenesis.Moonlight just now breaking over the skyglow of the city.The younger stepped toward Swan.Said something in a language Swan didnt recognize.What is it?Swan said.Dont you speak English?The woman shook her head, said something more.She looked around her, called quietly behind her.Two more figures appeared next to her, taller than her and broader.Two young men.They leaned over and muttered to the daughter.You have antibiotics?one of them said.My coz is sick.No, Swan said, I dont carry those on me.Although possibly her belt had something, she wasnt even sure.They took a step closer.Who are you?one said.What are you?Im visiting friends, Swan said.I can call them.The young men approached her, shaking their heads.Youre a spacer, the first speaker said, and the other added, What you doing here?I have to go, Swan said, and started for the roadbut the two of them grabbed her by the arms.Their grips were so strong that she didnt even try to jerk free.Hey!she said sharply.The first speaker called out toward the dark behind the two women: Kiran!Kiran!Soon another figure appeared out of the darkanother young man, the tallest yet, but willowy.The two holding Swan had grips that felt to her like something they had done before.The new young man was startled at the sight of Swan and said something sharp to the two holding her, in a language she didnt recognize.A quick urgent conversation passed between them; this Kiran was not pleased.Finally he looked at Swan.They want to keep you for money.Give me a second here.More urgent talk in their tongue.Kiran appeared to be making them nervous or defensive; then he approached and took Swan by the upper arm, squeezing once as if to send a message, and gestured the others away with a flick of his head.He was telling them what to do.The other two finally nodded, and the one who had spoken first said to her, Back soon.Then the first two slipped away into the night.Swan looked Kiran in the eye, and he grimaced and let go of her arm.Those are my cousins, he said.They had a bad idea.A stupid idea, Swan said.They could have just asked me for help.So what did you tell them?That I would keep you here while they got their mothers car.So now I think you should get out of here.Come walk me back, Swan said.I want you along, in case they come back.His eyebrows shot up his forehead, and he regarded her closely.After a while he said, All right.They walked quickly on the road.Will you get in trouble for this?Swan asked at one point.Yes, he said gloomily.What will they do?Theyll try to beat on me.And tell the old guys.Her arms were still burning where they had been gripped, and her cheeks were hot.She regarded the gloomy youth walking next to her.He looked good.And he had without a moments hesitation removed her from a bad situation.She recalled how sharp his voice had been when hed spoken to his cousins.Do you want to leave?What do you mean?Do you want to go into space?After a pause he said, Can you do that?Yes, she said.They stopped outside Zashas, and Swan looked him over.She liked the look of him.He looked at her with an expression curious, wonderingeager.She felt a shiver run down her.My friend who lives here is a diplomat for Mercury.So come in if you want.We can get you up there if you want, she said, looking skyward briefly.He hesitated.You wont get me in trouble?I will get you in trouble.Trouble in space.She started toward Zashas, and after a moment, he followed her.She opened the door.Zasha?she said.Just a sec, Zasha called out of the kitchen.The boy was staring at her, clearly wondering if she was on the level.Swan said, They called you Kiran?Yes, Kiran.What language were you speaking?Telugu.South India.What are you doing here?We live here now.So he was already an exile.And there were all kinds of immigrant residency requirements on Earth; possibly he was not in compliance.Zasha appeared in the doorway to the kitchen, washcloth in hand.Uh oh.Whos this?This is Kiran.His friends were kidnapping me, and he helped me to escape.In return I told him I would get him off Earth.But no!But yes.So here we are.And I need to keep my word.Zasha looked at Swan skeptically.What is this, Stockholm syndrome already?Z glanced at the youth, whose gaze was fixed on Swan.Or Lima syndrome?What are those?Kiran said without shifting his gaze.Zasha made a little grimace.Stockholm syndrome is where hostages become sympathetic to their captors and advocate for them.Lima syndrome is where the kidnappers become fond of their victims and let them go.Isnt there a Ransom of Red Chief syndrome?Swan said sharply.Come on, Z.  I told you, he rescued me.What syndrome is that?I want to repay a favor, and I need your help.Quit trying to take over the situation like you always do.Zasha turned away with an annoyed look; thought it over; shrugged.We can get him off if you really want it.Ill have to do it through a friend who helps me with this kind of thing.Hes at the Trinidad Tobago elevator, its a hawala.We have a kind of pass through agreement, although after this Ill owe him.Meaning youll owe me.I always owe you.How will we get to Trinidad?Diplomatic pouch.What?
