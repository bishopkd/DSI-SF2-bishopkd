We preferred the light of a moon, or the stars.Light was too much order and that can be fatal.You see what you Eos Atreides have done?Man is a creature of only that light which protects him.The sun was our enemy on Dune. "Namri brought his gaze down to Leto's level."What light do you prefer, Atreides?"By Namri's poised attitude, Leto sensed that this question carried deep weight.Would the man kill him if he failed to answer correctly?He might.Leto saw Namri's hand resting quietly next to the polished hilt of a crysknife.A ring in the form of a magic tortoise glittered on the Fremen's knife hand.Leto eased himself up onto his elbows, sent his mind questing into Fremen beliefs.They trusted the Law and loved to hear its lessons expounded in analogy, these old Fremen.The light of the moon?"I prefer...the light of Lisanu L'haqq," Leto said, watching Namri for subtle revelations.The man seemed disappointed, but his hand moved away from his knife."It is the light of truth, the light of the perfect man in which the influence of al Mutakallim can clearly be seen," Leto continued."What other light would a human prefer?""You speak as one who recites, not one who believes," Namri said.And Leto thought: I did recite.But he began to sense the drift of Namri's thoughts, how his words were filtered through early training in the ancient riddle game.Thousands of these riddles went into Fremen training, and Leto had but to bend his attention upon this custom to find examples flooding his mind."Challenge: Silence?Answer: The friend of the hunted.  "Namri nodded to himself as though he shared this thought, said: "There is a cave which is the cave of life for Fremen.It is an actual cave which the desert has hidden.Shai Hulud, the great grandfather of all Fremen, sealed up that cave.My Uncle Ziamad told me about it and he never lied to me.There is such a cave. "Leto heard the challenging silence when Namri finished speaking.Cave of life?"My Uncle Stilgar also told me of that cave," Leto said."It was sealed to keep cowards from hiding there. "The reflection of a glowglobe glittered in Namri's shadowed eyes.He asked: "Would you Atreides open that cave?You seek to control life through a ministry: your Central Ministry for Information, Auqaf and Hajj.The Maulana in charge is called Kausar.He has come a long way from his family's beginnings at the salt mines of Niazi.Tell me, Atreides, what is wrong with your ministry?"Leto sat up, aware now that he was fully into the riddle game with Namri and that the forfeit was death.The man gave every indication that he'd use that crysknife at the first wrong answer.Namri, recognizing this awareness in Leto, said: "Believe me, Atreides.I am the clod crusher.I am the Iron Hammer. "Now Leto understood.Namri saw himself as Mirzabah, the Iron Hammer with which the dead are beaten who cannot reply satisfactorily to the questions they must answer before entry into paradise.What was wrong with the central ministry which Alia and her priests had created?Leto thought of why he'd come into the desert, and a small hope returned to him that the Golden Path might yet appear in his universe.What this Namri implied by his question was no more than the motive which had driven Muad'Dib's own son into the desert."God's it is to show the way," Leto said.Namri's chin jerked down and he stared sharply at Leto."Can it be true that you believe this?"he demanded."It's why I am here," Leto said."To find the way?""To find it for myself. "Leto put his feet over the edge of the cot.The rock floor was uncarpeted, cold."The Priests created their ministry to hide the way. ""You speak like a true rebel," Namri said, and he rubbed the tortoise ring on his finger."We shall see.Listen carefully once more.You know the high Shield Wall at Jalalud Din?That Wall bears my family's marks carved there in the first days.Javid, my son, has seen those marks.Abedi Jalal, my nephew, has seen them.Mujahid Shafqat of the Other Ones, he too has seen our marks.In the season of the storms near Sukkar, I came down with my friend Yakup Abad near that place.The winds were blistering hot like the whirlwinds from which we learned our dances.We did not take time to see the marks because a storm blocked the way.But when the storm passed we saw the vision of Thatta upon the blown sand.The face of Shakir Ali was there for a moment, looking down upon his city of tombs.The vision was gone in the instant, but we all saw it.Tell me, Atreides, where can I find that city of tombs?"The whirlwinds from which we learned our dances, Leto thought.The vision of Thatta and Shakir Ali.These were the words of a Zensunni Wanderer, those who considered themselves to be the only true men of the desert.And Fremen were forbidden to have tombs."The city of tombs is at the end of the path which all men follow," Leto said.And he dredged up the Zensunni beatifies."It is in a garden one thousand paces square.There is a fine entry corridor two hundred and thirty three paces long and one hundred paces wide all paved with marble from ancient Jaipur.Therein dwells ar Razzaq, he who provides food for all who ask.And on the Day of Reckoning, all who stand up and seek the city of tombs shall not find it.For it is written: That which you know in one world, you shall not find in another. ""Again you recite without belief," Namri sneered."But I'll accept it for now because I think you know why you're here. "A cold smile touched his lips."I give you a provisional future, Atreides. "Leto studied the man warily.Was this another question in disguise?"Good!"Namri said."Your awareness has been prepared.I've sunk home the barbs.One more thing, then.Have you heard that they use imitation stillsuits in the cities of far Kadrish?"As Namri waited, Leto quested in his mind for a hidden meaning.Imitation stillsuits?They were worn on many planets.He said: "The foppish habits of Kadrish are an old story often repeated.The wise animal blends into its surroundings. "Namri nodded slowly.Then: "The one who trapped you and brought you here will see you presently.Do not try to leave this place.It would be your death. "Arising as he spoke, Namri went out into the dark passage.For a long time after he had gone, Leto stared into the passage.He could hear sounds out there, the quiet voices of men on guard duty.Namri's story of the mirage vision stayed with Leto.It brought up the long desert crossing to this place.It no longer mattered whether this were Jacurutu/Fondak.Namri was not a smuggler.He was something much more potent.And the game Namri played smelled of the Lady Jessica; it stank of the Bene Gesserit.Leto sensed an enclosing peril in this realization.But that dark passage where Namri had gone was the only exit from this room.And outside lay a strange sietch   beyond that, the desert.The harsh severity of that desert, its ordered chaos with mirages and endless dunes, came over Leto as part of the trap in which he was caught.He could recross that sand, but where would flight take him?The thought was like stagnant water.It would not quench his thirst.= = = = = =   Because of the one pointed Time awareness in which the conventional mind remains immersed, humans tend to think of everything in a sequential, word oriented framework.This mental trap produces very short term concepts of effectiveness and consequences, a condition of constant, unplanned response to crises.Liet Kynes, The Arrakis Workbook   Words and movements simultaneous, Jessica reminded herself and she bent her thoughts to those necessary mental preparations for the coming encounter.The hour was shortly after breakfast, the golden sun of Salusa Secundus just beginning to touch the far wall of the enclosed garden which she could see from her window.She had dressed herself carefully: the black hooded cloak of a Reverend Mother, but it carried the Atreides crest in gold worked into an embroidered ring around the hem and again at the cuff of each sleeve.Jessica arranged the drape of her garment carefully as she turned her back on the window, holding her left arm across her waist to present the Hawk motif of the crest.Farad'n noted the Atreides symbols, commenting on them as he entered, but he betrayed no anger or surprise.She detected subtle humor in his voice and wondered at it.She saw that he had clad himself in the grey leotard which she had suggested.He sat on the low green divan to which she directed him, relaxing with his right arm along the back.Why do I trust her?he wondered.This is a Bene Gesserit witch!Jessica, reading the thought in the contrast between his relaxed body and the expression on his face, smiled and said: "You trust me because you know our bargain is a good one, and you want what I can teach you. "She saw the pinch of a scowl touch his brow, waved her left hand to calm him."No, I don't read minds.I read the face, the body, the mannerisms, tone of voice, set of arms.Anyone can do this once they learn the Bene Gesserit Way. ""And you will teach me?""I'm sure you've studied the reports about us," she said."Is there anywhere a report that we fail to deliver on a direct promise?""No reports, but... ""We survive in part by the complete confidence which people can have in our truthfulness.That has not changed. ""I find this reasonable," he said."I'm anxious to begin. ""I'm surprised you've never asked the Bene Gesserit for a teacher," she said."They would've leaped at the opportunity to put you in their debt. ""My mother would never listen to me when I urged her to do this," he said."But now... "He shrugged, an eloquent comment on Wensicia's banishment."Shall we start?""It would've been better to begin this when you were much younger," Jessica said."It'll be harder for you now, and it'll take much longer.You'll have to begin by learning patience, extreme patience.I pray you'll not find it too high a price. ""Not for the reward you offer. "She heard the sincerity, the pressure of expectations, and the touch of awe in his voice.These formed a place to begin.She said: "The art of patience, then   starting with some elementary prana bindu exercises for the legs and arms, for your breathing.We'll leave the hands and fingers for later.Are you ready?"She seated herself on a stool facing him.Farad'n nodded, holding an expectant expression on his face to conceal the sudden onset of fear.Tyekanik had warned him that there must be a trick in the Lady Jessica's offer, something brewed by the Sisterhood."You cannot believe that she has abandoned them again or that they have abandoned her. "Farad'n had stopped the argument with an angry outburst for which he'd been immediately sorry.His emotional reaction had made him agree more quickly with Tyekanik's precautions.Farad'n glanced at the corners of the room, the subtle gleam of jems in the coving.All that glittered was not jems: everything in this room would be recorded and good minds would review every nuance, every word, every movement.Jessica smiled, noting the direction of his gaze, but not revealing that she knew where his attention had wandered.She said: "To learn patience in the Bene Gesserit Way, you must begin by recognizing the essential, raw instability of our universe.We call nature   meaning this totality in all of its manifestations   the Ultimate Non Absolute.To free your vision and permit you to recognize this conditional nature's changing ways, you will hold your two hands at arm's length in front of you.Stare at your extended hands, first the palms and then the backs.Examine the fingers, front and back.Do it. "Farad'n complied, but he felt foolish.These were his own hands.He knew them."Imagine your hands aging," Jessica said."They must grow very old in your eyes.Very, very old.Notice how dry the skin... ""My hands don't change," he said.He already could feel the muscles of his upper arms trembling."Continue to stare at your hands.Make them old, as old as you can imagine.It may take time.But when you see them age, reverse the process.Make your hands young again   as young as you can make them.Strive to take them from infancy to great age at will, back and forth, back and forth. ""They don't change!"he protested.His shoulders ached."If you demand it of your senses, your hands will change," she said."Concentrate upon visualizing the flow of time which you desire: infancy to age, age to infancy.It may take you hours, days, months.But it can be achieved.Reversing that change flow will teach you to see every system as something spinning in relative stability...only relative. ""I thought I was learning patience. "She heard anger in his voice, an edge of frustration."And relative stability," she said."This is the perspective which you create with your own belief, and beliefs can be manipulated by imagination.You've learned only a limited way of looking at the universe.Now you must make the universe your own creation.This will permit you to harness any relative stability to your own uses, to whatever uses you are capable of imagining. ""How long did you say it takes?""Patience," she reminded him.A spontaneous grin touched his lips.His eyes wavered toward her."Look at your hands!"she snapped.The grin vanished.His gaze jerked back to a fixated concentration upon his extended hands."What do I do when my arms get tired?"he asked."Stop talking and concentrate," she said."If you become too tired, stop.Return to it after a few minutes of relaxation and exercise.You must persist in this until you succeed.At your present stage, this is more important than you could possibly realize.Learn this lesson or the others will not come. "Farad'n inhaled a deep breath, chewed his lips, stared at his hands.He turned them slowly: front, back, front, back...His shoulders trembled with fatigue.Front, back...Nothing changed.Jessica arose, crossed to the only door.He spoke without removing his attention from his hands."Where are you going?""You'll work better on this if you're alone.I'll return in about an hour.Patience. ""I know!"She studied him a moment.How intent he looked.He reminded her with a heart tugging abruptness of her own lost son.She permitted herself a sigh, said: "When I return I'll give you the exercise lessons to relieve your muscles.Give it time.You'll be astonished at what you can make your body and your senses do. "She let herself out.The omnipresent guards took up station three paces behind her as she strode down the hall.Their awe and fear were obvious.They were Sardaukar, thrice warned of her prowess, raised on the stories of their defeat by the Fremen of Arrakis.This witch was a Fremen Reverend Mother, a Bene Gesserit and an Atreides.Jessica, glancing back, saw their stern faces as a milepost in her design.She turned away as she came to the stairs, went down them and through a short passage into the garden below her windows.Now if only Duncan and Gurney can do their parts, she thought as she felt the gravel of a pathway beneath her feet, saw the golden light filtered by greenery.= = = = = =   You will learn the integrated communication methods as you complete the next step in your mentat education.This is a gestalten function which will overlay data paths in your awareness, resolving complexities and masses of input from the mentat index catalogue techniques which you already have mastered.Your initial problem will be the breaking tensions arising from the divergent assembly of minutiae/data on specialized subjects.Be warned.Without mentat overlay integration, you can be immersed in the Babel Problem, which is the label we give to the omnipresent dangers of achieving wrong combinations from accurate information.The Mentat Handbook   The sound of fabrics rubbing together sent sparks of awareness through Leto.He was surprised that he had turned his sensitivity to the point where he automatically identified the fabrics from their sound: the combination came from a Fremen robe rubbing against the coarse hangings of a door curtain.He turned toward the sound.It came from the passage where Namri had gone minutes before.As Leto turned, he saw his captor enter.It was the same man who had taken him prisoner: the same dark strip of skin above the stillsuit mask, the identical searing eyes.The man lifted a hand to his mask, slipped the catchtube from his nostrils, lowered the mask and, in the same motion, flipped his hood back.Even before he focused on the scar of the inkvine whip along the man's jaw, Leto recognized him.The recognition was a totality in his awareness with the search for confirming details coming afterward.No mistake about it, this rolling lump of humanity, this warrior troubadour, was Gurney Halleck!Leto clenched his hands into fists, overcome momentarily by the shock of recognition.No Atreides retainer had ever been more loyal.None better at shield fighting.He'd been Paul's trusted confidant and teacher.He was the Lady Jessica's servant.These recognitions and more surged through Leto's mind.Gurney was his captor.Gurney and Namri were in this conspiracy together.And Jessica's hand was in it with them."I understand you've met our Namri," Halleck said."Pray believe him, young sir.He has one function and one function only.He's the one capable of killing you should the need arise. "Leto responded automatically with his father's tones: "So you've joined my enemies, Gurney!I never thought the  "  "Try none of your devil tricks on me, lad," Halleck said."I'm proof against them all.I follow your grandmother's orders.Your education has been planned to the last detail.It was she who approved my selection of Namri.What comes next, painful as it may seem, is at her command. ""And what does she command?"Halleck lifted a hand from the folds of his robe, exposed a Fremen injector, primitive but efficient.Its transparent tube was charged with blue fluid.Leto squirmed backward on the cot, was stopped by the rock wall.As he moved, Namri entered, stood beside Halleck with hand on crysknife.Together they blocked the only exit."I see you've recognized the spice essence," Halleck said."You're to take the worm trip, lad.You must go through it.Otherwise, what your father dared and you dare not would hang over you for the rest of your days. "Leto shook his head wordlessly.This was the thing he and Ghanima knew could overwhelm them.Gurney was an ignorant fool!How could Jessica...Leto felt the father presence in his memories.It surged into his mind, trying to strip away his defenses.Leto wanted to shriek outrage, could not move his lips.But this was the wordless thing which his pre born awareness most feared.This was prescient trance, the reading of immutable future with all of its fixity and its terrors.Surely Jessica could not have ordered such an ordeal for her own grandson.But her presence loomed in his mind, filling him with acceptance arguments.Even the litany of fear was pressed upon him with a repetitive droning: "I must not fear.Fear is the mind killer.Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration.I will face my fear.I will permit it to pass over me and through me.And when it has gone past... "With an oath already ancient when Chaldea was young, Leto tried to move, tried to leap at the two men standing over him, but his muscles refused to obey.As though he already existed in the trance, Leto saw Halleck's hand move, the injector approach.The light of a glowglobe sparkled within the blue fluid.The injector touched Leto's left arm.Pain lanced through him, shot upward to the muscles of his head.Abruptly Leto saw a young woman sitting outside a crude hut in dawnlight.She sat right there in front of him roasting coffee beans to a rose brown, adding cardamom and melange.The voice of a rebeck echoed from somewhere behind him.The music echoed and echoed until it entered his head, still echoing.It suffused his body and he felt himself to be large, very large, not a child at all.And his skin was not his own.He knew that sensation!His skin was not his own.Warmth spread through his body.As abruptly as his first vision, he found himself standing in darkness.It was night.Stars like a rain of embers fell in gusts from a brilliant cosmos.Part of him knew there was no escaping, but still he tried to fight it until the father presence intruded."I will protect you in the trance.The others within will not take you. "Wind tumbled Leto, rolled him, hissing, pouring dust and sand over him, cutting his arms, his face, abrading his clothes, whipping the loose torn ends of now useless fabric.But he felt no pain and he saw the cuts heal as rapidly as they appeared.Still he rolled with the wind.And his skin was not his own.It will happen!he thought.But the thought was distant and came as though it were not his own, not really his own; no more than his skin.The vision absorbed him.It evolved into a stereologic memory which separated past and present, future and present, future and past.Each separation mingled into a trinocular focus which he sensed as the multidimensional relief map of his own future existence.He thought: Time is a measure of space, just as a range finder is a measure of space, but measuring locks us into the place we measure.He sensed the trance deepening.It came as an amplification of internal consciousness which his self identity soaked up and through which he felt himself changing.It was living Time and he could not arrest an instant of it.Memory fragments, future and past, deluged him.But they existed as montage in motion.Their relationships underwent a constant dance.His memory was a lens, an illuminating searchlight which picked out fragments, isolating them, but forever failing to stop the ceaseless motion and modification which surged into his view.That which he and Ghanima had planned came through the searchlight, dominating everything, but now it terrified him.Vision reality ached in him.The uncritical inevitability made his ego cringe.And his skin was not his own!Past and present tumbled through him, surging across the barriers of his terror.He could not separate them.One moment he felt himself setting forth on the Butlerian Jihad, eager to destroy any machine which simulated human awareness.That had to be the past   over and done with.Yet his senses hurtled through the experience, absorbing the most minute details.He heard a minister companion speaking from a pulpit: "We must negate the machines that think.Humans must set their own guidelines.This is not something machines can do.Reasoning depends upon programming, not on hardware, and we are the ultimate program!"He heard the voice clearly, knew his surroundings   a vast wooden hall with dark windows.Light came from sputtering flames.And his minister companion said: "Our Jihad is a 'dump program. 'We dump the things which destroy us as humans!"And it was in Leto's mind that the speaker had been a servant of computers, one who knew them and serviced them.But the scene vanished and Ghanima stood in front of him, saying: "Gurney knows.He told me.They're Duncan's words and Duncan was speaking as a mentat.'In doing good, avoid notoriety; in doing evil, avoid self awareness. 'That had to be future   far future.But he felt the reality.It was as intense as any past from his multitude of lives.And he whispered: "Isn't that true, father?"But the father presence within spoke warningly: "Don't invite disaster!You're learning stroboscopic awareness now.Without it you could overrun yourself, lose your place mark in Time. "And the bas relief imagery persisted.Intrusions hammered at him.Past present now.There was no true separation.He knew he had to flow with this thing, but the flowing terrified him.How could he return to any recognizable place?Yet he felt himself being forced to cease every effort of resistance.He could not grasp his new universe in motionless, labeled bits.No bit would stand still.Things could not be forever ordered and formulated.He had to find the rhythm of change and see between the changes to the changing itself.Without knowing where it began he found himself moving within a gigantic moment bienheureux, able to see the past in the future, present in past, the now in both past and future.It was the accumulation of centuries experienced between one heartbeat and the next.Leto's awareness floated free, no objective psyche to compensate for consciousness, no barriers.Namri's "provisional future" remained lightly in his memory, but it shared awareness with many futures.And in this shattering awareness, all of his past, every inner life became his own.With the help of the greatest within him, he dominated.They were his.He thought: When you study an object from a distance, only its principle may be seen.He had achieved the distance and he could see his own life now: the multi past and its memories were his burden, his joy, and his necessity.But the worm trip had added another dimension and his father no longer stood guard within him because the need no longer existed.Leto saw through the distances clearly   past and present.And the past presented him with an ultimate ancestor   one who was called Harum and without whom the distant future would not be.These clear distances provided new principles, new dimensions of sharing.Whichever life he now chose, he'd live it out in an autonomous sphere of mass experience, a trail of lives so convoluted that no single lifetime could count the generations of it.Aroused, this mass experience held the power to subdue his selfdom.It could make itself felt upon an individual, a nation, a society or an entire civilization.That, of course, was why Gurney had been taught to fear him; why Namri's knife waited.They could not be allowed to see this power within him.No one could ever see it in its fullness   not even Ghanima.Presently Leto sat up, saw that only Namri remained, watching.In an old voice, Leto said: "There's no single set of limits for all men.Universal prescience is an empty myth.Only the most powerful local currents of Time may be foretold.But in an infinite universe, local can be so gigantic that your mind shrinks from it. "Namri shook his head, not understanding."Where's Gurney?"Leto asked."He left lest he have to watch me slay you. ""Will you slay me, Namri?"It was almost a plea to have the man do it.Namri took his hand from his knife."Since you ask me to do it, I will not.If you were indifferent, though... ""The malady of indifference is what destroys many things," Leto said.He nodded to himself."Yes...even civilizations die of it.It's as though that were the price demanded for achieving new levels of complexity or consciousness. "He looked up at Namri."So they told you to look for indifference in me?"And he saw Namri was more than a killer   Namri was devious."As a sign of unbridled power," Namri said, but it was a lie."Indifferent power, yes. "Leto sat up, sighed deeply."There was no moral grandeur to my father's life, Namri; only a local trap which he built for himself. "= = = = = =   O Paul, thou Muad'Dib, Mahdi of all men, Thy breath exhaled Sent forth the hurricane.Songs of Muad'Dib   "Never!"Ghanima said."I'd kill him on our wedding night. "She spoke with a barbed stubbornness which thus far had resisted all blandishments.Alia and her advisors had been at it half the night, keeping the royal quarters in a state of unrest, sending out for new advisors, for food and drink.The entire Temple and its adjoining Keep seethed with the frustrations of unmade decisions.Ghanima sat composedly on a green floater chair in her own quarters, a large room with rough tan walls to simulate sietch rock.The ceiling, however, was imbar crystal which flickered with blue light, and the floor was black tile.The furnishings were sparse: a small writing table, five floater chairs and a narrow cot set into an alcove, Fremen fashion.Ghanima wore a robe of yellow mourning."You are not a free person who can settle every aspect of her own life," Alia said for perhaps the hundredth time.The little fool must come to realize this sooner or later!She must approve the betrothal to Farad'n.She must!Let her kill him later, but the betrothal requires open acknowledgment by the Fremen affianced."He killed my brother," Ghanima said, holding to the single note which sustained her."Everyone knows this.Fremen would spit at the mention of my name were I to consent to this betrothal. "And that is one of the reasons why you must consent, Alia thought.She said: "His mother did it.He has banished her for it.What more do you want of him?""His blood," Ghanima said."He's a Corrino. ""He has denounced his own mother," Alia protested."And why should you worry about the Fremen rabble?They'll accept whatever we tell them to accept.Ghani, the peace of the Empire demands that  "  "I will not consent," Ghanima said."You cannot announce the betrothal without me. "Irulan, entering the room as Ghanima spoke, glanced inquiringly at Alia and the two female advisors who stood dejectedly beside her.Irulan saw Alia throw up her arms in disgust and drop into a chair facing Ghanima."You speak to her, Irulan," Alia said.Irulan pulled a floater into place, sat down beside Alia."You're a Corrino, Irulan," Ghanima said."Don't press your luck with me. "Ghanima got up, crossed to her cot and sat on it cross legged, glaring back at the women.Irulan, she saw, had dressed in a black aba to match Alia's, the hood thrown back to reveal her golden hair.It was mourning hair under the yellow glow of the floating globes which illuminated the room.Irulan glanced at Alia, stood up and crossed to stand facing Ghanima."Ghani, I'd kill him myself if that were the way to solve matters.And Farad'n's my own blood, as you so kindly emphasized.But you have duties far higher than your commitment to Fremen... ""That doesn't sound any better coming from you than it does from my precious aunt," Ghanima said."The blood of a brother cannot be washed off.That's more than some little Fremen aphorism. "Irulan pressed her lips together.Then: "Farad'n holds your grandmother captive.He holds Duncan and if we don't  "  "I'm not satisfied with your stories of how all this happened," Ghanima said, peering past Irulan at Alia."Once Duncan died rather than let enemies take my father.Perhaps this new ghola flesh is no longer the same as  "  "Duncan was charged with protecting your grandmother's life!"Alia said, whirling in her chair."I'm confident he chose the only way to do that. "And she thought: Duncan!Duncan!You weren't supposed to do it this way.Ghanima, reading the overtones of contrivance in Alia's voice, stared across at her aunt."You're lying, O Womb of Heaven.I've heard about your fight with my grandmother.What is it you fear to tell us about her and your precious Duncan?""You've heard it all," Alia said, but she felt a stab of fear at this bald accusation and what it implied.Fatigue had made her careless, she realized.She arose, said: "Everything I know, you know. "Turning to Irulan: "You work on her.She must be made to  "  Ghanima interrupted with a coarse Fremen expletive which came shockingly from the immature lips.Into the quick silence she said: "You think me just a mere child, that you have years in which to work on me, that eventually I'll accept.Think again, O Heavenly Regent.You know better than anyone the years I have within me.I'll listen to them, not to you. "Alia barely suppressed an angry retort, stared hard at Ghanima.Abomination?Who was this child?A new fear of Ghanima began to rise in Alia.Had she accepted her own compromise with the lives which came to her pre born?Alia said: "There's time yet for you to see reason. ""There may be time yet for me to see Farad'n's blood spurt around my knife," Ghanima said."Depend on it.If I'm ever left alone with him, one of us will surely die. ""You think you loved your brother more than I?"Irulan demanded."You play a fool's game!I was mother to him as I was to you.I was  "  "You never knew him, "Ghanima said."All of you, except at times my beloved aunt, persist in thinking us children.You're the fools!Alia knows!Look at her run away from... ""I run from nothing," Alia said, but she turned her back on Irulan and Ghanima, and stared at the two amazons who were pretending not to hear this argument.They'd obviously given up on Ghanima.Perhaps they sympathized with her.Angrily, Alia sent them from the room.Relief was obvious on their faces as they obeyed."You run," Ghanima persisted."I've chosen a way of life which suits me," Alia said, turning back to stare at Ghanima sitting cross legged on the cot.Was it possible she'd made that terrible inner compromise?Alia tried to see the signs of it in Ghanima, but was unable to read a single betrayal.Alia wondered then: Has she seen it in me?But how could she?"You feared to be the window for a multitude," Ghanima accused."But we're the preborn and we know.You'll be their window, conscious or unconscious.You cannot deny them. "And she thought: Yes, I know you   Abomination.And perhaps I'll go as you have gone, but for now I can only pity you and despise you.Silence hung between Ghanima and Alia, an almost palpable thing which alerted the Bene Gesserit training in Irulan.She glanced from one to the other, then: "Why're you so quiet suddenly?""I've just had a thought which requires considerable reflection," Alia said."Reflect at your leisure, dear aunt," Ghanima sneered.Alia, putting down fatigue inflamed anger, said: "Enough for now!Leave her to think.Perhaps she'll come to her senses. "Irulan arose, said: "It's almost dawn anyway.Ghani, before we go, would you care to hear the latest message from Farad'n?He... ""I would not," Ghanima said."And hereafter, cease calling me by that ridiculous diminutive.Ghani!It merely supports the mistaken assumption that I'm a child you can... ""Why'd you and Alia grow so suddenly quiet?"Irulan asked, reverting to her previous question, but casting it now in a delicate mode of Voice.Ghanima threw her head back in laughter."Irulan!You'd try Voice on me?""What?"Irulan was taken aback."You'd teach your grandmother to suck eggs," Ghanima said."I'd what?""The fact that I remember the expression and you've never even heard it before should give you pause," Ghanima said."It was an old expression of scorn when you Bene Gesserit were young.But if that doesn't chasten you, ask yourself what your royal parents could've been thinking of when they named you Irulan?Or is it Ruinal?"In spite of her training, Irulan flushed."You're trying to goad me, Ghanima. ""And you tried to use Voice on me.On me!I remember the first human efforts in that direction.I remember then, Ruinous Irulan.Now, get out of here, all of you. "But Alia was intrigued now, caught by an inner suggestion which sluffed her fatigue aside.She said: "Perhaps I've a suggestion which could change your mind, Ghani. ""Still Ghani!"A brittle laugh escaped Ghanima, then: "Reflect but a moment: If I desire to kill Farad'n, I need but fall in with your plans.I presume you've thought of that.Beware of Ghani in a tractable mood.You see, I'm being utterly candid with you. ""That's what I hoped," Alia said."If you... ""The blood of a brother cannot be washed away," Ghanima said."I'll not go before my Fremen loved ones a traitor to that.Never to forgive, never to forget.Isn't that our catechism?I warn you here, and I'll say it publicly: you cannot betroth me to Farad'n.Who, knowing me would believe it?Farad'n himself could not believe it.Fremen, hearing of such a betrothal, would laugh into their sleeves and say; 'See!She lures him into a trap. 'If you... ""I understand that," Alia said, moving to Irulan's side.Irulan, she noted, was standing in shocked silence, aware already of where this conversation was headed."And so I would be luring him into a trap," Ghanima said."If that's what you want, I'll agree, but he may not fall.If you wish this false betrothal as the empty coin with which to buy back my grandmother and your precious Duncan, so be it.But it's on your head.Buy them back.Farad'n, though, is mine.Him I'll kill. "Irulan whirled to face Alia before she could speak."Alia!If we go back on our word... "She let it hang there a moment while Alia smilingly reflected on the potential wrath among the Great Houses in Faufreluches Assembled, the destructive consequences to believe in Atreides honor, the loss of religious trust, all of the great and small building blocs which would tumble."It'd rule against us," Irulan protested."All belief in Paul's prophethood would be destroyed.It...the Empire... ""Who could dare question our right to decide what is wrong and what is right?"Alia asked, voice mild."We mediate between good and evil.I need but proclaim... ""You can't do this!"Irulan protested."Paul's memory... ""Is just another tool of Church and State," Ghanima said."Don't speak foolishness, Irulan. "Ghanima touched the crysknife at her waist, looked up at Alia."I've misjudged my clever aunt, Regent of all that's Holy in Muad'Dib's Empire.I have, indeed, misjudged you.Lure Farad'n into our parlor if you will. ""This is recklessness," Irulan pleaded."You agree to this betrothal, Ghanima?"Alia asked, ignoring Irulan."On my terms," Ghanima said, hand still on her crysknife."I wash my hands of this," Irulan said, actually wringing her hands."I was willing to argue for a true betrothal to heal  "  "We'll give you a wound much more difficult to heal, Alia and I," Ghanima said."Bring him quickly, if he'll come.And perhaps he will.Would he suspect a child of my tender years?Let us plan the formal ceremony of betrothal to require his presence.Let there be an opportunity for me to be alone with him...just a minute or two... "Irulan shuddered at this evidence that Ghanima was, after all, Fremen entire, child no different from adult in this terrible bloodiness.After all, Fremen children were accustomed to slay the wounded on the battlefield, releasing women from this chore that they might collect the bodies and haul them away to the deathstills.And Ghanima, speaking with the voice of a Fremen child, piled horror upon horror by the studied maturity of her words, by the ancient sense of vendetta which hung like an aura around her."Done," Alia said, and she fought to keep voice and face from betraying her glee."We'll prepare the formal charter of betrothal.We'll have the signatures witnessed by the proper assemblage from the Great Houses.Farad'n cannot possibly doubt  "  "He'll doubt, but he'll come," Ghanima said."And he'll have guards.But will they think to guard him from me?""For the love of all that Paul tried to do," Irulan protested, "let us at least make Farad'n's death appear an accident, or the result of malice by outside  "  "I'll take joy in displaying my bloody knife to my brethren," Ghanima said."Alia, I beg you," Irulan said."Abandon this rash insanity.Declare kanly against Farad'n, anything to  "  "We don't require formal declaration of vendetta against him," Ghanima said."The whole Empire knows how we must feel. "She pointed to the sleeve of her robe."We wear the yellow of mourning.When I exchange it for the black of a Fremen betrothed, will that fool anyone?""Pray that it fools Farad'n," Alia said, "and the delegates of the Great Houses we invite to witness the  "  "Every one of those delegates will turn against you," Irulan said."You know that!""Excellent point," Ghanima said."Choose those delegates with care, Alia.They must be ones we won't mind eliminating later. "Irulan threw up her arms in despair, turned and fled."Have her put under close surveillance lest she try to warn her nephew," Ghanima said."Don't try to teach me how to conduct a plot," Alia said.She turned and followed Irulan, but at a slower pace.The guards outside and the waiting aides were sucked up in her wake like sand particles drawn into the vortex of a rising worm.Ghanima shook her head sadly from side to side as the door closed, thought: It's as poor Leto and I thought.Gods below!I wish it'd been me the tiger killed instead of him.= = = = = =   Many forces sought control of the Atreides twins and, when the death of Leto was announced, this movement of plot and counterplot was amplified.Note the relative motivations: the Sisterhood feared Alia, an adult Abomination, but still wanted those genetic characteristics carried by the Atreides.The Church hierarchy of Auqaf and Hajj saw only the power implicit in control of Muad'Dib's heir.CHOAM wanted a doorway to the wealth of Dune.Farad'n and his Sardaukar sought a return to glory for House Corrino.The Spacing Guild feared the equation Arrakis = melange; without the spice they could not navigate.Jessica wished to repair what her disobedience to the Bene Gesserit had created.Few thought to ask the twins what their plans might be, until it was too late.The Book of Kreos   Shortly after the evening meal, Leto saw a man walking past the arched doorway to his chamber, and his mind went with the man.The passage had been left open and Leto had seen some activity out there   spice hampers being wheeled past, three women with the obvious off world sophistication of dress which marked them as smugglers.This man who took Leto's mind walking might have been no different except that he moved like Stilgar, a much younger Stilgar.It was a peculiar walk his mind took.Time filled Leto's awareness like a stellar globe.He could see infinite timespaces, but he had to press into his own future before knowing in which moment his flesh lay.His multifaceted memory lives surged and receded, but they were his now.They were like waves on a beach, but if they rose too high, he could command them and they would retreat, leaving the royal Harum behind.Now and again he would listen to those memory lives.One would rise like a prompter, poking its head up out of the stage and calling cues for his behavior.His father came during the mind walk and said: "You are a child seeking to be a man.When you are a man, you will seek in vain for the child you were. "All the while, he felt his body being plagued by the fleas and lice of an old sietch poorly maintained.None of the attendants who brought his heavily spice laced food appeared bothered by the creatures.Did these people have immunity from such things, or was it only that they had lived with them so long they could ignore discomfort?Who were these people assembled around Gurney?How had they come to this place?Was this Jacurutu?His multi memories produced answers he did not like.They were ugly people and Gurney was the ugliest.Perfection floated here, though, dormant and waiting beneath an ugly surface.Part of him knew he remained spice bound, held in bondage by the heavy dosages of melange in every meal.His child's body wanted to rebel while her persona raved with the immediate presence of memories carried over from thousands of eons.His mind returned from its walk, and he wondered if his body had really stayed behind.Spice confused the senses.He felt the pressures of self limitations piling up against him like the long barachan dunes of the bled slowly building themselves a ramp against a desert cliff.One day a few trickles of sand would flow over the cliff, then more and more and more...and only the sand would remain exposed to the sky.But the cliff would still be there underneath.I'm still within the trance, he thought.He knew he would come soon to a branching of life and death.His captors kept sending him back into the spice thralldom, unsatisfied with his responses at every return.Always, treacherous Namri waited there with his knife.Leto knew countless pasts and futures, but he had yet to learn what would satisfy Namri...or Gurney Halleck.They wanted something outside of the visions.The life and death branching lured Leto.His life, he knew, would have to possess some inner meaning which carried it above the vision circumstances.Thinking of this demand, he felt that his inner awareness was his true being and his outer existence was the trance.This terrified him.He did not want to go back to the sietch with its fleas, its Namri, its Gurney Halleck.I'm a coward, he thought.But a coward, even a coward, might die bravely with nothing but a gesture.Where was that gesture which could make him whole once more?How could he awaken from trance and vision into the universe which Gurney demanded?Without that turning, without an awakening from aimless visions, he knew he could die in a prison of his own choosing.In this he had at last come to cooperate with his captors.Somewhere he had to find wisdom, an inner balance which would reflect upon the universe and return to him an image of calm strength.Only then might he seek his Golden Path and survive the skin which was not his own.Someone was playing the baliset out there in the sietch.Leto felt that his body probably heard the music in the present.He sensed the cot beneath his back.He could hear music.It was Gurney at the baliset.No other fingers could quite compare with his mastery of that most difficult instrument.He played an old Fremen song, one called a hadith because of its internal narrative and the voice which invoked those patterns required for survival on Arrakis.The song told the story of human occupations within a sietch.Leto felt the music move him through a marvelous ancient cavern.He saw women trampling spice residue for fuel, curding the spice for fermentation, forming spice fabrics.Melange was everywhere in the sietch.Those moments came when Leto could not distinguish between the music and the people of the cavern vision.The whine and slap of a power loom was the whine and slap of the baliset.But his inner eyes beheld fabrics of human hair, the long fur of mutated rats, threads of desert cotton, and strips curled from the skin of birds.He saw a sietch school.The eco language of Dune raged through his mind on its wings of music.He saw the sun powered kitchen, the long chamber where stillsuits were made and maintained.He saw weather forecasters reading the sticks they'd brought in from the sand.Somewhere during this journey, someone brought him food and spooned it into his mouth, holding his head up with a strong arm.He knew this as a real time sensation, but the marvelous play of motion continued within him.As though it came in the next instant after the spice laden food, he saw the hurtling of a sandstorm.Moving images within the sand breath became the golden reflections of a moth's eyes, and his own life was reduced to the viscous trail of a crawling insect.Words from the Panoplia Prophetica raved through him: "It is said that there is nothing firm, nothing balanced, nothing durable in all the universe   that nothing remains in its state, that each day, some time each hour, brings change. "The old Missionaria Protectiva knew what they were doing, he thought.They knew about Terrible Purposes.They knew how to manipulate people and religions.Even my father didn't escape them, not in the end.There lay the clue he'd been seeking.Leto studied it.He felt strength flowing back into his flesh.His entire multifaceted being turned over and looked out upon the universe.He sat up and found himself alone in the gloomy cell with only the light from the outer passage where the man had walked past and taken his mind an eon ago."Good fortune to us all!"he called in the traditional Fremen way.Gurney Halleck appeared in the arched doorway, his head a black silhouette against the light from the outer passage."Bring light," Leto said."You wish to be tested further?"Leto laughed."No.It's my turn to test you. ""We shall see. "Halleck turned away, returning in a moment with a bright blue glowglobe in the crook of his left elbow.He released it in the cell, allowing it to drift above their heads."Where's Namri?"Leto asked."Just outside where I can call him. ""Ahh, Old Father Eternity always waits patiently," Leto said.He felt curiously released, poised on the edge of discovery."You call Namri by the name reserved for Shai Hulud?"Halleck asked."His knife's a worm's tooth," Leto said."Thus, he's Old Father Eternity. "Halleck smiled grimly, but remained silent."You still wait to pass judgment on me," Leto said."And there's no way to exchange information, I'll admit, without making judgments.You can't ask the universe to be exact, though. "A rustling sound behind Halleck alerted Leto to Namri's approach.He stopped half a pace to Halleck's left."Ahhh, the left hand of the damned," Leto said."It's not wise to joke about the Infinite and the Absolute," Namri growled.He glanced sideways at Halleck."Are you God, Namri, that you invoke absolutes?"Leto asked.But he kept his attention on Halleck.Judgment would come from there.Both men merely stared at him without answering."Every judgment teeters on the brink of error," Leto explained."To claim absolute knowledge is to become monstrous.Knowledge is an unending adventure at the edge of uncertainty. ""What word game is this you play?"Halleck demanded."Let him speak," Namri said."It's the game Namri initiated with me," Leto said, and saw the old Fremen's head nod agreement.He'd certainly recognized the riddle game."Our senses always have at least two levels," Leto said."Trivia and message," Namri said."Excellent!"Leto said."You gave me trivia; I give you message.I see, I hear, I detect odors, I touch; I feel changes in temperature, taste.I sense the passage of time.I may take emotive samples.Ahhhhh!I am happy.You see, Gurney?Namri?There's no mystery about a human life.It's not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced. ""You try our patience, lad," Namri said."Is this the place where you wish to die?"But Halleck put out a restraining hand."First, I am not a lad," Leto said.He made the first sign at his right ear."You'll not slay me; I've placed a water burden upon you. "Namri drew his crysknife half out of its sheath."I owe you nothing!""But God created Arrakis to train the faithful," Leto said."I've not only showed you my faith, I've made you conscious of your own existence.Life requires dispute.You've been made to know   by me!that your reality differs from all others; thus, you know you're alive. ""Irreverence is a dangerous game to play with me," Namri said.He held his crysknife half drawn."Irreverence is a most necessary ingredient of religion," Leto said."Not to speak of its importance in philosophy.Irreverence is the only way left to us for testing our universe. ""So you think you understand the universe?"Halleck asked, and he opened a space between himself and Namri  "Ye esss," Namri said, and there was death in his voice."The universe can be understood only by the wind," Leto said."There's no mighty seat of reason which dwells within the brain.Creation is discovery.God discovered us in the Void because we moved against a background which He already knew.The wall was blank.Then there was movement. ""You play hide and seek with death," Halleck warned."But you are both my friends," Leto said.He faced Namri."When you offer a candidate as Friend of your Sietch, do you not slay a hawk and an eagle as the offering?And is this not the response: 'God send each man at his end, such hawks, such eagles, and such friends'?"Namri's hand slid from his knife.The blade slipped back into its sheath.He stared wide eyed at Leto.Each sietch kept its friendship ritual secret, yet here was a selected part of the rite.Halleck, though, asked: "Is this place your end?""I know what you need to hear from me, Gurney," Leto said, watching the play of hope and suspicion across the ugly face.Leto touched his own breast."This child was never a child.My father lives within me, but he is not me.You loved him, and he was a gallant human whose affairs beat upon high shores.His intent was to close down the cycle of wars, but he reckoned without the movement of infinity as expressed by life.That's Rhajia!Namri knows.Its movement can be seen by any mortal.Beware paths which narrow future possibilities.Such paths divert you from infinity into lethal traps. ""What is it I need to hear from you?"Halleck asked."He's just word playing," Namri said, but his voice carried deep hesitation, doubts."I ally myself with Namri against my father," Leto said."And my father within allies himself with us against what was made of him. ""Why?"Halleck demanded."Because it's the amor fati which I bring to humankind, the act of ultimate self examination.In this universe, I choose to ally myself against any force which brings humiliation upon humankind.Gurney!Gurney!You were not born and raised in the desert.Your flesh doesn't know the truth of which I speak.But Namri knows.In the open land, one direction is as good as another. ""I still have not heard what I must hear," Halleck snarled."He speaks for war and against peace," Namri said."No," Leto said."Nor did my father speak against war.But look what was made of him.Peace has only one meaning in this Imperium.It's the maintenance of a single way of life.You are commanded to be contented.Life must be uniform on all planets as it is in the Imperial Government.The major object of priestly study is to find the correct forms of human behavior.For this they go to the words of Muad'Dib!Tell me, Namri, are you content?""No. "The words came out flat, spontaneous rejection."Then do you blaspheme?""Of course not!""But you aren't contented.You see, Gurney?Namri proves it to us.Every question, every problem doesn't have a single correct answer.One must permit diversity.A monolith is unstable.Then why do you demand a single correct statement from me?Is that to be the measure of your monstrous judgment?""Will you force me to have you slain?"Halleck asked, and there was agony in his voice."No, I'll have pity upon you," Leto said."Send word to my grandmother that I'll cooperate.The Sisterhood may come to regret my cooperation, but an Atreides gives his word. ""A Truthsayer should test that," Namri said."These Atreides... ""He'll have his chance to say before his grandmother what must be said," Halleck said.He nodded with his head toward the passage.Namri paused before leaving, glanced at Leto."I pray we do the right thing in leaving him alive. ""Go, friends," Leto said."Go and reflect. "As the two men departed, Leto threw himself onto his back, feeling the cold cot against his spine.Movement sent his head spinning over the edge of his spice burdened consciousness.In that instant he saw the entire planet   every village, every town, every city, the desert places and the planted places.All of the shapes which smashed against his vision bore intimate relationships to a mixture of elements within themselves and without.He saw the structures of Imperial society reflected in physical structures of its planets and their communities.Like a gigantic unfolding within him, he saw this revelation for what it must be: a window into the society's invisible parts.Seeing this, Leto realized that every system had such a window.Even the system of himself and his universe.He began peering into windows, a cosmic voyeur.This was what his grandmother and the Sisterhood sought!He knew it.His awareness flowed on a new, higher level.He felt the past carried in his cells, in his memories, in the archetypes which haunted his assumptions, in the myths which hemmed him, in his languages and their prehistoric detritus.It was all of the shapes out of his human and nonhuman past, all of the lives which he now commanded, all integrated in him at last.And he felt himself as a thing caught up in the ebb and flow of nucleotides.Against the backdrop of infinity he was a protozoan creature in which birth and death were virtually simultaneous, but he was both infinite and protozoan, a creature of molecular memories.We humans are a form of colony organism!he thought.They wanted his cooperation.Promising cooperation had won him another reprieve from Namri's knife.By summoning to cooperation, they sought to recognize a healer.And he thought: But I'll not bring them social order in the way they expect it!A grimace contorted Leto's mouth.He knew he'd not be as unconsciously malevolent as was his father   despotism at one terminal and slavery at the other   but this universe might pray for those "good old days. "His father within spoke to him then, cautiously probing, unable to demand attention but pleading for audience.And Leto answered: "No.We will give them complexities to occupy their minds.There are many modes of flight from danger.How will they know I'm dangerous unless they experience me for thousands of years?Yes, father within, we'll give them question marks. "= = = = = =   There is no guilt or innocence in you.All of that is past.Guilt belabors the dead and I am not the Iron Hammer.You multitude of the dead are merely people who have done certain things, and the memory of those things illuminates my path.Leto II to His Memory Lives, After Harq al Ada   "It moves of itself!"Farad'n said, and his voice was barely a whisper.He stood above the Lady Jessica's bed, a brace of guards close behind him.The Lady Jessica had propped herself up in the bed.She was clad in a parasilk gown of shimmering white with a matching band around her copper hair.Farad'n had come bursting in upon her moments before.He wore the grey leotard and his face was sweaty with excitement and the exertions of his dash through the palace corridors."What time is it?"Jessica asked."Time?"Farad'n appeared puzzled.One of the guards spoke up: "It is the third hour past midnight, My Lady. "The guard glanced fearfully at Farad'n.The young prince had come dashing through the night lighted corridors, picking up startled guards in his wake."But it moves," Farad'n said.He held out his left hand, then his right."I saw my own hands shrink into chubby fists, and I remembered!They were my hands when I was an infant.I remembered being an infant, but it was...a clearer memory.I was reorganizing my old memories!""Very good," Jessica said.His excitement was infectious."And what happened when your hands became old?""My...mind was...sluggish," he said."I felt an ache in my back.Right here. "He touched a place over his left kidney."You've learned a most important lesson," Jessica said."Do you know what that lesson is?"He dropped his hands to his sides, stared at her.Then: "My mind controls my reality. "His eyes glittered, and he repeated it, louder this time: "My mind controls my reality!""That is the beginning of prana bindu balance," Jessica said."It is only the beginning, though. ""What do I do next?"he asked."My Lady," the guard who had answered her question ventured now to interrupt."The hour," he said.Aren't their spy posts manned at this hour?Jessica wondered.She said: "Begone.We have work to do. ""But My Lady," the guard said, and he looked fearfully from Farad'n to Jessica and back."You think I'm going to seduce him?"Jessica asked.The man stiffened.Farad'n laughed, a joyous outburst.He waved a hand in dismissal."You heard her.Begone. "The guards looked at each other, but they obeyed.Farad'n sat on the edge of her bed."What next?"He shook his head."I wanted to believe you, yet I did not believe.Then...it was as though my mind melted.I was tired.My mind gave up its fighting against you.It happened.Just like that!"He snapped his fingers."It was not me that your mind fought against," Jessica said."Of course not," he admitted."I was fighting against myself, all the nonsense I've learned.What next now?"Jessica smiled."I confess I didn't expect you to succeed this rapidly.It's been only eight days and... ""I was patient," he said, grinning."And you've begun to learn patience, too," she said."Begun?""You've just crept over the lip of this learning," she said."Now you're truly an infant.Before...you were only a potential, not even born. "The corners of his mouth drew down."Don't be so gloomy," she said."You've done it.That's important.How many can say they were born anew?""What comes next?"he insisted."You will practice this thing you've learned," she said."I want you able to do this at will, easily.Later you'll fill a new place in your awareness which this has opened.It will be filled by the ability to test any reality against your own demands. ""Is that all I do now...practice the  "  "No.Now you can begin the muscle training.Tell me, can you move the little toe on your left foot without moving any other muscle of your body?""My... "She saw a distant expression come over his face as he tried to move the toe.He looked down at his foot presently, staring at it.Sweat broke out on his forehead.A deep breath escaped him."I can't do it. ""Yes you can," she said."You will learn to do it.You will learn every muscle in your body.You will know these muscles the way you know your hands. "He swallowed hard at the magnitude of this prospect.Then: "What are you doing to me?What is your plan for me?""I intend to turn you loose upon the universe," she said."You will become whatever it is you most deeply desire. "He mulled this for a moment."Whatever I desire?""Yes. ""That's impossible!""Unless you learn to control your desires the way you control your reality," she said.And she thought: There!Let his analysis examine that.They'll advise cautious approval, but Farad'n will move a step closer to realization of what I'm really doing.He proved his surmise by saying: "It's one thing to tell a person he'll realize his heart's desire.It's another thing to actually deliver that realization. ""You've come farther than I thought," Jessica said."Very good.I promise you: if you complete this program of learning, you'll be your own man.Whatever you do, it'll be because that's what you want to do. "And let a Truthsayer try to pry that apart, she thought.He stood up, but the expression he bent upon her was warm, a sense of camaraderie in it."You know, I believe you.Damned if I know why, but I do.And I won't say a word about the other things I'm thinking. "Jessica watched his retreating back as he let himself out of her bedchamber.She turned off the glowglobes, lay back.This Farad'n was a deep one.He'd as much as told her that he was beginning to see her design, but he was joining her conspiracy of his own volition.Wait until he begins to learn his own emotions, she thought.With that, she composed herself for the return to sleep.The morrow, she knew, would be plagued by casual encounters with palace personnel asking seemingly innocuous questions.= = = = = =   Humankind periodically goes through a speedup of its affairs, thereby experiencing the race between the renewable vitality of the living and the beckoning vitiation of decadence.In this periodic race, any pause becomes luxury.Only then can one reflect that all is permitted; all is possible.The Apocrypha of Muad'Dib   The touch of sand is important, Leto told himself.He could feel the grit beneath him where he sat beneath a brilliant sky.They had force fed him another heavy dosage of melange, and Leto's mind turned upon itself like a whirlpool.An unanswered question lay deep within the funnel of the whirlpool: Why do they insist that I say it?Gurney was stubborn; no doubt of that.And he'd had his orders from his Lady Jessica.They'd brought him out of the sietch into the daylight for this "lesson. "He had the strange sensation that he'd let his body take the short trip from the sietch while his inner being mediated a battle between the Duke Leto I and the old Baron Harkonnen.They'd fought within him, through him, because he would not let them communicate directly.The fight had taught him what had happened to Alia.Poor Alia.I was right to fear the spice trip, he thought.A welling bitterness toward the Lady Jessica filled him.Her damned gom jabbar!Fight it and win, or die in the attempt.She couldn't put a poisoned needle against his neck, but she could send him into the valley of peril which had claimed her own daughter.Snuffling sounds intruded upon his awareness.They wavered, growing louder, then softer, louder...softer.There was no way for him to determine whether they had current reality or came from the spice.Leto's body sagged over his folded arms.He felt hot sand through his buttocks.There was a rug directly in front of him, but he sat on open sand.A shadow lay across the rug: Namri.Leto stared into the muddy pattern of the rug, feeling bubbles ripple there.His awareness drifted on its own current through a landscape which stretched out to a horizon of shock headed greenery.His skull thrummed with drums.He felt heat, fever.The fever was a pressure of burning which filled his senses, crowding out awareness of flesh until he could only feel the moving shadows of his peril.Namri and the knife.Pressure...pressure...Leto lay at last suspended between sky and sand, his mind lost to all but the fever.Now he waited for something to happen, sensing that any occurrence would be a first and only thing.Hot hot pounding sunshine crashed brilliantly around him, without tranquillity, without remedy.Where is my Golden Path?Everywhere bugs crawled.Everywhere.My skin is not my own.He sent messages along his nerves, waited out the dragging other person responses.Up head, he told his nerves.A head which might have been his own crept upward, looked out at patches of blankness in the bright light.Someone whispered: "He's deep into it now. "No answer.Burn fire sun building heat on heat.Slowly, outbending, the current of his awareness took him drifting through a last screen of green blankness and there, across low folding dunes, distant no more than a kilometer beyond the stretched out chalk line of a cliff, there lay the green burgeoning future, upflung, flowing into endless green, greenswelling, green green moving outward endlessly.In all of that green there was not one great worm.Riches of wild growth, but nowhere Shai Hulud.Leto sensed that he had ventured across old boundaries into a new land which only the imagination had witnessed, and that he looked now directly through the very next veil which a yawning humankind called Unknown.It was bloodthirsty reality.He felt the red fruit of his life swaying on a limb, fluid slipping away from him, and the fluid was the spice essence flowing through his veins.Without Shai Hulud, no more spice.He had seen a future without the great grey worm serpent of Dune.He knew this, yet could not tear himself from the trance to rail against such a passage.Abruptly his awareness plunged back   back, back, away from such a deadly future.His thoughts went into his bowels, becoming primitive, moved only by intense emotions.He found himself unable to focus on any particular aspect of his vision or his surroundings, but there was a voice within him.It spoke an ancient language and he understood it perfectly.The voice was musical and lilting, but its words bludgeoned him."It is not the present which influences the future, thou fool, but the future which forms the present.You have it all backward.Since the future is set, an unfolding of events which will assure that future is fixed and inevitable. "The words transfixed him.He felt terror rooted in the heavy matter of his body.By this he knew his body still existed, but the reckless nature and enormous power of his vision left him feeling contaminated, defenseless, unable to signal a muscle and gain its obedience.He knew he was submitting more and more to the onslaught of those collective lives whose memories once had made him believe he was real.Fear filled him.He thought that he might be losing the inner command, falling at last into Abomination.Leto felt his body twisting in terror.He had come to depend upon his victory and the newly won benevolent cooperation of those memories.They had turned against him, all of them   even royal Harum whom he'd trusted.He lay shimmering on a surface which had no roots, unable to give any expression to his own life.He tried to concentrate upon a mental picture of himself, was confronted by overlapping frames, each a different age: infant into doddering ancient.He recalled his father's early training: Let the hands grow young, then old.But his whole body was immersed now in this lost reality and the entire image progression melted into other faces, the features of those who had given him their memories.A diamond thunderbolt shattered him.Leto felt pieces of his awareness drifting apart, yet he retained a sense of himself somewhere between being and nonbeing.Hope quickening, he felt his body breathing.In...Out.He took in a deep breath: yin.He let it out: yang.Somewhere just beyond his grasp lay a place of supreme independence, a victory over all of the confusions inherent in his multitude of lives   no false sense of command, but a true victory.He knew his previous mistake now: he had sought power in the reality of his trance, choosing that rather than face the fears which he and Ghanima had fed in each other.Fear defeated Alia!But the seeking after power spread another trap, diverting him into fantasy.He saw the illusion.The entire illusion process rotated half a turn and now he knew a center from which he could watch without purpose the flight of his visions, of his inner lives.Elation flooded him.It made him want to laugh, but he denied himself this luxury, knowing it would bar the doors of memory.Ahhhh, my memories, he thought.I have seen your illusion.You no longer invent the next moment for me.You merely show me how to create new moments.I'll not lock myself on the old tracks.This thought passed through his awareness as though wiping a surface clean and in its wake he felt his entire body, an einfalle which reported in most minute detail on every cell, every nerve.He entered a state of intense quiet.In this quiet, he heard voices, knowing they came from a great distance, but he heard them clearly as though they echoed in a chasm.One of the voices was Halleck's."Perhaps we gave him too much of it. "Namri answered."We gave him exactly what she told us to give him. ""Perhaps we should go back out there and have another look at him. "Halleck."Sabiha is good at such things; she'll call us if anything starts to go wrong. "Namri."I don't like this business of Sabiha. "Halleck."She's a necessary ingredient. "Namri.Leto felt bright light outside himself and darkness within, but the darkness was secretive, protective, and warm.The light began to blaze up and he felt that it came from the darkness within, swirling outward like a brilliant cloud.His body became transparent, drawing him upward, yet he retained that einfalle contact with every cell and nerve.The multitude of inner lives fell into alignment, nothing tangled or mixed.They became very quiet in duplication of his own inner silence, each memory life discrete, an entity incorporeal and undivided.Leto spoke to them then: "I am your spirit.I am the only life you can realize.I am the house of your spirit in the land which is nowhere, the land which is your only remaining home.Without me, the intelligible universe reverts to chaos.Creative and abysmal are inextricably linked in me; only I can mediate between them.Without me, mankind will sink into the mire and vanity of knowing.Through me, you and they will find the only way out of chaos: understanding by living. "With this he let go of himself and became himself, his own person compassing the entirety of his past.It was not victory, not defeat, but a new thing to be shared with any inner life he chose.Leto savored this newness, letting it possess every cell, every nerve, giving up what the einfalle had presented to him and recovering the totality in the same instant.After a time, he awoke in white darkness.With a flash of awareness he knew where his flesh was: seated on sand about a kilometer from the cliff wall which marked the northern boundary of the sietch.He knew that sietch now: Jacurutu for certain...and Fondak.But it was far different from the myths and legends and the rumors which the smugglers allowed.A young woman sat on a rug directly in front of him, a bright glowglobe anchored to her left sleeve and drifting just above her head.When Leto looked away from the glowglobe, there were stars.He knew this young woman; she was the one from his vision earlier, the roaster of coffee.She was Namri's niece, as ready with a knife as Namri was.There was the knife in her lap.She wore a simple green robe over a grey stillsuit.Sabiha, that was her name.And Namri had his own plans for her.Sabiha saw the awakening in his eyes, said: "It's almost dawn.You've spent the whole night here. ""And most of a day," he said."You make good coffee. "This statement puzzled her, but she ignored it with a single mindedness which spoke of harsh training and explicit instructions for her present behavior."It's the hour of assassins," Leto said."But your knife is no longer needed. "He glanced at the crysknife in her lap."Namri will be the judge of that," she said.Not Halleck, then.She only confirmed his inner knowledge."Shai Hulud is a great garbage collector and eraser of unwanted evidence," Leto said."I've used him thus myself. "She rested her hand lightly on the knife handle."How much is revealed by where we sit and how we sit," he said."You sit upon the rug and I upon the sand. "Her hand closed over the knife handle.Leto yawned, a gaping and stretching which made his jaws ache."I've had a vision which included you," he said.Her shoulders relaxed slightly."We've been very one sided about Arrakis," he said."Barbaric of us.There's a certain momentum in what we've been doing, but now we must undo some of our work.The scales must be brought into better balance. "A puzzled frown touched Sabiha's face."My vision," he said."Unless we restore the dance of life here on Dune, the dragon on the floor of the desert will be no more. "Because he'd used the Old Fremen name for the great worm, she was a moment understanding him.Then: "The worms?""We're in a dark passage," he said."Without spice, the Empire falls apart.The Guild will not move.Planets will slowly lose their clear memories of each other.They'll turn inward upon themselves.Space will become a boundary when the Guild navigators lose their mastery.We'll cling to our dunetops and be ignorant of that which is above us and below us. ""You speak very strangely," she said."How have you seen me in your vision?"Trust Fremen superstition!he thought.He said: "I've become pasigraphic.I'm a living glyph to write out the changes which must come to pass.If I do not write them, you'll encounter such heartache as no human should experience. ""What words are these?"she asked, but her hand remained lightly on the knife.Leto turned his head toward the cliffs of Jacurutu, seeing the beginning glow which would be Second Moon making its predawn passage behind the rocks.The death scream of a desert hare shocked its way through him.He saw Sabiha shudder.There came the beating of wings   a predator bird, night creature here.He saw the ember glow of many eyes as they swept past above him, headed for crannies in the cliff."I must follow the dictates of my new heart," Leto said."You look upon me as a mere child, Sabiha, but if  "  "They warned me about you," Sabiha said, and now her shoulders were stiff with readiness.He heard the fear in her voice, said: "Don't fear me, Sabiha.You've lived eight more years than this flesh of mine.For that, I honor you.But I have untold thousands more years of other lives, far more than you have known.Don't look upon me as a child.I have bridged the many futures and, in one, saw us entwined in love.You and I, Sabiha. ""What are...This can't...  "She broke off in confusion."The idea could grow on you," he said."Now help me back to the sietch, for I've been in far places and am weak with the weariness of my travels.Namri must hear where I have been. "He saw the indecision in her, said: "Am I not the Guest of the Cavern?Namri must learn what I have learned.We have many things to do lest our universe degenerate. ""I don't believe that...about the worms," she said."Nor about us entwined in love?"She shook her head.But he could see the thoughts drifting through her mind like windblown feathers.His words both attracted and repelled her.To be consort of power, that certainly carried high allure.Yet there were her uncle's orders.But one day this son of Muad'Dib might rule here on Dune and in the farthest reaches of their universe.She encountered then an extremely Fremen, cavern hiding aversion to such a future.The consort of Leto would be seen by everyone, would be an object of gossip and speculations.She could have wealth, though, and..."I am the son of Muad'Dib, able to see the future," he said.Slowly she replaced her knife in its sheath, lifted herself easily from the rug, crossed to his side and helped him to his feet.Leto found himself amused by her actions then: she folded the rug neatly and draped it across her right shoulder.He saw her measuring the difference in their sizes, reflecting upon his words: Entwined in love?Size is another thing that changes, he thought.She put a hand on his arm then to help him and control him.He stumbled and she spoke sharply: "We're too far from the sietch for that!"Meaning the unwanted sound which might attract a worm.Leto felt that his body had become a dry shell like that abandoned by an insect.He knew this shell: it was one with the society which had been built upon the melange trade and its Religion of the Golden Elixir.It was emptied by its excesses.Muad'Dib's high aims had fallen into wizardry which was enforced by the military arm of Auqaf.Muad'Dib's religion had another name now; it was Shien san Shao, an Ixian label which designated the intensity and insanity of those who thought they could bring the universe to paradise at the point of a crysknife.But that too would change as lx had changed.For they were merely the ninth planet of their sun, and had even forgotten the language which had given them their name."The Jihad was a kind of mass insanity," he muttered."What?"Sabiha had been concentrating on the problem of making him walk without rhythm, hiding their presence out here on open sand.She was a moment focusing on his words, then interpreted them as another product of his obvious fatigue.She felt the weakness of him, the way he'd been drained by the trance.It seemed pointless and cruel to her.If he were to be killed as Namri said, then it should be done quickly without all of this by play.Leto had spoken of a marvelous revelation, though.Perhaps that was what Namri sought.Certainly that must be the motive behind the behavior of this child's own grandmother.Why else would Our Lady of Dune give her sanction to these perilous acts against a child?Child?Again she reflected upon his words.They were at the cliff base now and she stopped her charge, letting him relax a moment here where it was safer.Looking down at him in the dim starlight, she asked: "How could there be no more worms?""Only I can change that," he said."Have no fear.I can change anything. ""But it's "  "Some questions have no answers," he said."I've seen that future, but the contradictions would only confuse you.This is a changing universe and we are the strangest change of all.We resonate to many influences.Our futures need constant updating.Now, there's a barrier which we must remove.This requires that we do brutal things, that we go against our most basic, our dearest wishes...But it must be done. ""What must be done?""Have you ever killed a friend?"he asked and, turning, led the way into the gap which sloped upward to the sietch's hidden entrance.He moved as quickly as his trance fatigue would permit, but she was right behind him, clutching his robe and pulling him to a stop."What's this of killing a friend?""He'll die anyway," Leto said."I don't have to do it, but I could prevent it.If I don't prevent it, is that not killing him?""Who is this...who will die?""The alternative keeps me silent," he said."I might have to give my sister to a monster. "Again he turned away from her, and this time when she pulled at his robe he resisted, refusing to answer her questions.Best she not know until the time comes, he thought.
