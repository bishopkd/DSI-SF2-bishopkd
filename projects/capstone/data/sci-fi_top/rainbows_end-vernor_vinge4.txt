They say the halo is to bless the guardians of the past. "The three watched silently for a moment.The sound of the choir came through the high glass windows, but also from protesters around the world.The combined effect was more symbolic than beautiful, since the voices were so far out of synch.After a moment, Carlos Rivera spoke again."Almost a third of the physical visitors are from out of town!"Blount grinned back at him.Carlos Rivera was a strange young fellow, a disabled veteran.He hardly met the cabal's informal age requirements, but in some ways he was almost as old fashioned as Tommie Parker.He wore small thick glasses, the kind that had been popular in the early teens.He had typer rings on all his fingers and both thumbs.His shirt was one of the old displayables.Right now it showed white letters on black: "Librarians: Guardians of the Past, Handmaidens of the Future. "But the most important thing about Carlos Rivera was that he was on the Library staff.Parker was studying the numbers on his laptop."Well, we've got the world's attention.We spiked at two million viewers a few moments back.And lots more will be watching this asynchronously. ""What does UCSD Public Relations say?"Parker typed briefly on his laptop."They're lying low.The PR people would just as soon that this be a non event.Ha.But they're getting pounded by the popular press" Parker leaned back and shifted into reminiscence."There was a time, I would have hidden my own cameras down on the lower floors.And if they deadzoned me, I'd've broken into the PR site and pasted pictures of burning books all across their press releases!""Du ," said Rivera, nodding his head."But that would be difficult nowadays. ""Yup.Worse, it would take courage. "Tommie patted his laptop."And that's the trouble with people nowadays.They've traded freedom for security.When I was a young man, the cops didn't live in every widget, and there wasn't some clown collecting royalties on every keystroke.Back then there was no 'Secure Hardware Environment' and it didn't take ten thousand transistors to make a flipflop.I remember in '91, when I took down the"  and he was off on one his stories.Poor Tommie.Modern medicine had not cured him of his need to tell about old adventures again and again.But Carlos Rivera seemed to love these stories.He nodded every few seconds, his expression rapt.Blount sometimes wondered whether Rivera's enthusiasm should be held for or against the young fellow.   "so anyway, by the time they thought to check for crimps in the fiber, we had dumped all the files and  "  Now, for a wonder, Rivera was no longer listening.He had turned toward the stacks, and his expression was full of surprise.He rattled off something in Chinese, then thankfully slipped back into English: "I mean, please wait a moment. ""What?"Parker glanced at his laptop."Have they started the shredders?"Damn , thought Blount.He had been hoping that terrible moment could be marked by the protesters."Yes," said Rivera, "but that was several minutes ago, while you were talking.This is something different.Someone has gotten into the loading area. "Winston bounced to his feet  bounced as much as semirejuvenated joints could be made to bounce."I thought you said there was security down there?""I thought there was!"Rivera came to his feet, too."I can show you. "Images popped into Blount's eyes, views from cameras on the north and east sides of the building, more views than he could make sense of.Blount waved the images away."I want to see this for myself. "He plunged into the library stacks, Rivera close behind."If we had known about this, we could have put some of our people down there. "That was the problem nowadays.Security was so good that when it broke down, no one was around to take advantage!In the back of Blount's mind, something marveled at his new priorities.There had been a time when Dean Winston C.  Blount had been the fellow on the establishment side, doing his best to make sure that the know nothings didn't bust things up.Now well, now, a certain amount of hell raising might be the only way to set the establishment right."Has the choir seen this?""Dunno.The best views were quarantined. "Rivera sounded out of breath.They detoured around the elevators and staff rooms that occupied the middle of the floor.Now they were moving at right angles to the stacks.Far down the book lined shelves he glimpsed the sky beyond the windows."You said there was chance that Max Huertas might show up today. ""Du .Yes.There's some chance he might come.Several libraries begin the project this week, but UCSD is the star. "Huertas was more than just the money behind the Librareome.He was also a major investor in the biotech labs near campus.He had turned the university scene upside down with his Librareome insanity, ultimately greasing it past an administration that should have fought him to the death.Blount's jog slowed as they approached the windows.The UCSD campus had suffered a revolution in the last decades.The vibrant building campaign of his time as dean had been swept away by the Rose Canyon quake and the facile logic of the modern university administrations.The campus had reverted to a woodsy, low density style, with buildings that might just as well have been prefab Quonsets.In a sad, sad way it reminded him of the campus's earliest years, of his grad school years.We built such a beautiful place here, and then we let opportunism and remote learning and the damn labs dissipate it all .What shall it profit a university, if it shall enroll five hundred thousand, and lose its own soul?He reached the northeast windows and looked down.The sixth floor was at the building's maximum overhang.You could see almost straight down  to a stretch of cracked concrete, the library loading dock.And there was a guy down there, furtively looking around.Carlos Rivera caught up with Blount and for a moment they were both staring downward.Then Blount noticed that the younger man was actually staring through the floor; he'd found some camera on the lower levels."That's not Max Huertas," said Carlos."He'd come with a gang of lackeys. ""Yeah. "But it was someone who could persuade the Library rent a cops to let him go down there.Blount tapped the glass."Look up here, you jerk!"It was amazing what little he could see from straight up.The stranger carried himself with a twitchy awkwardness, like an old timer coping with a regrown nervous system Blount was beginning to get a very bad feeling.And then the stranger turned his gaze upward.It was like finding a large rat at your feet."Oh, Christ. "A strange combination of disgust and curiosity forced him to say: "Just get him up here. "After the sunny loading dock, the hallway seemed very dark.Robert hesitated, adjusting to the light.The walls were streaked with scuff and scrape marks.The floor was naked concrete.This was not a public area.It reminded him of years ago when he and certain undergrads would sneak around in the utility cores of these buildings.Epiphany hung tiny labels on the doors and ceiling, and even the cracks in the walls.They weren't terribly informative, ID numbers and maintenance instructions, the sort of thing that might have been paint stenciled in the old days.But  if he wanted to take the time  he could search through the signs and get background information.And there were mysteries.A large, silver puttied crack in the wall was marked "cantilever LimitCycle < 1.2mm:25s. "Robert was about to search on that when he noticed a door decorated with a larger banner, one that ticked out the seconds:  00:07:03 Librareome Equipment in Operation: KEEP OUT!What the hell, this door was open too.On the other side, the power saw racket was louder.He walked fifty feet, past plastic crates  "Rescued Data," the labels said.At the end, behind some kind of legged forklift, there was another unlocked door.And now he was on familiar ground: he was at the bottom of the library's central stairwell.He looked up and up, into the foreshortened spiral of steps.Tiny flecks of white floated and swirled in the column of light.Snowflakes?But one landed on his hand: a fleck of paper.And now the ripping buzz of the saw was still louder, and there was also the sound of a giant vacuum cleaner.But it was the irregular ripping buzz that echoed down the stairwell and beat him about the head.There was something familiar about that, but it wasn't an indoors kind of sound.He started up the stairs, pausing at each landing.The dust and the noise were worst at the fourth floor, labeled "Catalog Section PZ. "The door opened smoothly.Beyond would be the library stacks.All the books you could ever want, miles of them.The beauty of ideas waiting in ambush.But this was like no stacks he had ever seen.The floor was draped in white tarpaulin.The air was hazy with drifting debris.He took a breath, smelled pine pitch and burnt wood  and for a moment he couldn't stop coughing.Brap , painfully loud now, coming from four aisles to his right.There were empty shelves here, a littering of paper scraps and deep dust.Brrap .Against logic, sometimes recognition comes hard.But finally, Robert remembered the exact sound which that abrupt roar must be.He had heard it occasionally throughout his life, but always the machine had been outdoors.Brrrapl A tree shredder!Ahead of him, everything was empty bookcases, skeletons.Robert went to the end of the aisle and walked toward the noise.The air was a fog of floating paper dust.In the fourth aisle, the space between the bookcases was filled with a pulsing fabric tube.The monster worm was brightly lit from within.At the other end, almost twenty feet away, was the worm's maw  the source of the noise.Indistinct in the swirling haze, Robert could see two white suited figures, their jackets labeled "Huertas Data Rescue. "The two wore filter masks and head protectors.They might have been construction workers.In fact, this business was the ultimate in deconstruction: first one and then the other would pull books off the racks and toss them into the shredder's maw.The maintenance labels made calm phrases of the horror: The raging maw was a "NaviCloud custom debinder. "The fabric tunnel that stretched out behind it was a "camera tunnel. "Robert flinched from the sight  and Epiphany randomly rewarded his gesture with imagery from within the monster: The shredded fragments of books and magazines flew down the tunnel like leaves in tornado, twisting and tumbling.The inside of the fabric was stitched with thousands of tiny cameras.The shreds were being photographed again and again, from every angle and orientation, till finally the torn leaves dropped into a bin just in front of Robert.Rescued data.BRRRRRAP !The monster advanced another foot into the stacks, leaving another foot of empty shelves behind it.Almost empty.Robert stepped into the aisle and his hand caught on something lying on a shelf.It wasn't dust.It was half a page, a remnant of all the thousands of books that had already been sucked into the "data rescue" equipment.He waved it at the white suited workers and screamed words that were lost in the noise of their shredder and the worm tunnel fans.But the two looked up and shouted something back.If the body of the glowing worm hadn't been between him and them, Robert might have rushed the pair.As it was, they just waved impotently at each other.Then a third guy appeared, behind Robert.This one was an overweight thirty something wearing Bermuda shorts and a huge black T shirt.The young man was shouting at him in  what, Mandarin?He waved pleadingly for Robert to follow him back toward the stairwell, away from the nightmare.The sixth floor of the library was not part of the nightmare.In fact, it looked pretty much as Robert remembered from the early 1970s.The guy with the big T shirt led him through the stacks to a study area on the south side of the building.There was a short fellow with an ancient laptop computer, sitting right by the windows.The little guy stood and stared.Then suddenly he laughed, and stuck out his hand."I'll be damned.You really are Robert Gu!"Robert took the proffered hand, and stood uncertainly for awoment.Book shredders below, mystery man up here.And the crazy choir.He could finally see the singers in the plaza."Ha.You don't recognize me, do you, Robert?"No .The guy had lots of blond hair, but his face was as old as the hills.Only his laughter was familiar.After a second, he shrugged and waved for Robert to sit down."I don't blame you," he chattered on."But recognition the other way is easy.You lucked out, Robert, didn't you?I'd guess the Venn Kurasawa treatment worked a hundred percent for you; your skin looks better than when you were twenty five years old. "The old man slid an age spotted hand across his own features and smiled ruefully."But how's the rest of you?You look a little twitchy. ""I  I lost my marbles.Alzheimer's.But  "  "Hey, right.I can tell. "It was the heedless frankness that Robert suddenly recognized.Behind the stranger's face, Robert recognized the freshman who had made his  UCSD years significantly more exciting."Tommie Parker!"The young squirt who could never be put down, who had been a computer science jock at UCSD before he had even graduated from high school, before there had even been such a major.The little guy who couldn't wait for the future.Tommie nodded, chuckling."Yup.Yup.But it's been 'Professor Thomas Parker' for a long time.You know I got my doctorate from MIT?Then I came back here and I taught for almost forty years.You're looking at a Member of the Establishment. "And seeing what time had done for a moment Robert was silent.I should be immune by now .He looked out the window at the crowds, away from Parker."So what's going on, Tommie?You're camped up here like some grand commander. "Parker laughed and typed at his keyboard.From what Robert could see of the display, it was some ancient system, worse than his view page  and nothing like what he could get from Epiphany.But there was enthusiasm in Tom Parker's voice."It's this protest demonstration we set up.Against the Librareome Menace.We didn't stop the shredding, but  jeez, look at that.I got your break in on video. "Tommie's display showed what looked like a telephoto image shot from north of campus.A tiny figure that might have been Robert Gu was entering the library's freight area."I don't know how you got past security, Robert. ""Management wonders that too," said the young man who rescued Robert.He had sat down behind the front desk and brushed flakes of paper dandruff off of his hair and T shirt.Suddenly the "Chad is Bad" slogan on his shirt made a lot of sense.He noticed Robert's regard and gave him a little wave."Hi, Professor Gu.I'm Carlos Rivera, library staff. "His T shirt morphed to white, which at least made the little bits of paper less obvious."You're part of this destruction?"He suddenly noticed the half page he had saved from the shredder.He laid it gently on the table There were words there; maybe he could figure out what they had been part of."No, no," said Parker."Carlos is helping us.In fact, all the librarians oppose the shredding  excepting the administrators.And seeing that you got past library security, I think we have allies even there.You're a famous guy, Robert.And we can use the video you got. ""But I  " Robert started to say he didn't have a camera.Then he thought of the clothes he was wearing."Okay, but you'll have to show me how to give it to you. ""No problem  " began Rivera."You're using that Epiphany junk, aren't you, Robert?Yeah, you'll have to get some wearer to help you.Wearables are supposed to be such a convenience, but mainly they're an excuse for other people to run your life.Me, I'll stick with the proven solutions. "He patted his laptop.Through some fluke of memory, Robert recognized the model.Twenty some years ago, this gadget had been at the cutting edge of power and miniaturization, barely eight inches by ten, with a brilliant, millimeters thin screen and a fancy camera.Now even to Robert it was a ponderous behemoth.How can it even talk to the modern magic ?Parker's glance slid across to the librarian."How did he make it into the building, Carlos?"Rivera said, "W b zhido . "Tommie groaned."You're talking Chinese, Carlos. ""Oops, sorry. "He glanced at Robert."I was an army translator during the war," he said, as if that explained everything."I don't know how he got in, Professor Parker.I saw him walking down from Warschawski Hall.I was using the same viewpoints as our security does.But you notice that even after he got to the shredders, there was still no one to stop him. "He turned, looked expectantly into the stacks."Maybe the dean has other people working on this. "After a moment, an old man stepped out from behind the books."You know I don't, Carlos. "He walked to the window without looking at Robert.Aha , thought Robert, so this is where Winnie's disappeared to the last couple of weeks .Blount stared down at the plaza for several seconds.Finally he said, "The singing has stopped.They know about Gu's arrival, don't they?""Yes, sir.Even though we haven't published our own video, there's plenty of journalists floating around.At least three popular sources have IDed him. "Outside, the crowd was cheering.Robert tried the little shrug that Juan said would bring up local news.All he got was advertising.And Sharif was still silent.After a moment, Blount walked back to the head of the table and sat down with a wheeze.He hadn't looked directly at Robert; Winnie didn't seem nearly as confident as in Chumlig's class.How long has it been since we last played our little political games ?Robert gave Blount a steady look.That should cause Epiphany to search on him.Also, in the old days, that look had always unnerved the guy."Okay," Blount nodded at Tom Parker, "tell our protestors to start the windup.You know, the interviews and opinion pieces. ""What about Mr.New Development here?"Tommie jerked a thumb in Robert's direction.Blount finally looked at Robert.And Epiphany began streaming information across his view: Google BioSource: Winston C.  Blount, MA English from UCSD 1971, PhD English Literature from UCLA 1973, Associate Professor of English at Stanford 1973 1980, Professor of Literature and later Dean of Arts and Letters at UCSD 1980 2012.[Biblio, Speeches, Favorite things]   "So, Winnie," he said, "you still wheeling and dealing?"The other's face paled, but his reply was evenly worded."Call me Winston, or Dean Blount.If you please. "There was a time when he had gone by "Win. "It was Robert who had cured him of that.They stared at each other silently for another second.Finally, Blount said, "Do you have an explanation for how you got in the service entrance?"Robert gave a little laugh."I just walked in.I'm the most ignorant of all, Winston. "What had become of Zulfi Sharif?Tommie Parker looked up from his laptop."There is recent public information on Robert Gu.Robert's been in deep Alzheimer's for almost four years.He's one of the late cures. "He glanced up at Robert."Jeez, man, you almost died of old age before you got well.On the other hand, it looks like you've had great medical luck otherwise.So what brought you to UCSD on this of all days?"Robert shrugged.It was surprising how much he did not want to go into his problems with Bob and Miri."The timing is just coincidence.I came down to UCSD because because I wanted to see the books. "A not so friendly smile came to Blount's face."How very like you, that you come the day we start burning them. "Rivera protested, "It's shredding, Dean.I mean, technically speaking.Except for the chad, all the shredda is preserved. "Robert looked at the torn paper he had brought from downstairs: shredda that had escaped its final resting place?He held up the forlorn slip of paper."Honestly, I don't know what's going on.What was this?What madness explains destroying the book this was part of?"Winnie didn't answer immediately; he waved at Rivera to pass him the fragment.He set it on the table and stared for a second.His bitter smile grew a little wider."What pleasant irony.They're starting in the PZ's, aren't they, Carlos?""Du ," the young man replied, hesitantly."This," Winnie waved the paper in the air, "is from a science fiction book!"A grim chuckle."Those sci fi bastards are just getting what they deserve.For thirty years they had literature education hijacked  and this is what all their reductionism has gotten them.Good riddance. "He crumpled the paper and tossed it back at Robert.Tommie grabbed the little ball of paper and tried to resuscitate it."It's just an accident that science fiction came first, Dean. ""Actually," said Rivera, "there are rumors the shredders started with science fiction because there would be fewer complainers among the geeks. ""It doesn't matter," said Tommie."They were scheduled to be well into other stuff by the end of today. "Winnie leaned forward."What do you mean 'were scheduled'?""You didn't know?"Parker patted his laptop again; was he in love with the ancient device or what?"The shredding ran into a minor technical problem.They've shut down for the day. "He grinned."The popular press says the 'minor technical problem' is the sudden appearance of Robert in the middle of their operation. "Rivera hesitated, and light glinted in the depths of his thick eyeglasses."Yes," he said.So the crowd outside had something to celebrate after all.Winnie got up, looked out the window again, and sat down."Very good, we've earned our first victory!Relay our congratulations to the troops, Tommie. "Robert raised his hands, "Will somebody please explain this madness to me?There may be nothing burning, but this does seem like Fahrenheit 451 .That's another science fiction story, Winston. "Rivera waved vaguely."Search on keyword Librareome, Professor Gu. "Robert gestured and tapped.How does Juan manage to do this without looking like an idiot ?"Here, use my laptop.You'll never figure out how to drag news out of Epiphany. "Winston Blount slapped the table."He can do that on his own time, Tommie.We have serious work to do. ""Okay, Dean.But Robert has changed things.We can use his reputation. "Rivera nodded."Yes.He's won practically every literary prize there is. ""Stuff it," said Blount."We already have five Nobelists on board.Compared to them, Gu is nothing special. "Blount's glance flickered across Robert's face.The putdown he directed at Robert was accompanied by a minute hesitation, probably too short for the others to notice.The most important things about Winston Blount were not in his Google bio.Once upon a time, Winnie had thought himself a poet.But he wasn't; he was merely articulate and the owner of a large ego.By the time they both arrived as junior faculty at Stanford, Robert had lost patience with the poseur.Besides, committee meetings would have been deadly dull if not for his hobby of needling Winnie Blount.The guy had been an unending source of amusement because he seemed to think he could outwit Robert.Semester after semester, their verbal duels became more pointed, Winnie's failure more obvious.It hadn't helped the other's cause that Blount had no talent for what he wanted most, to create significant literature.Robert's lighthearted campaign had been devastating.By the late 1970s, Poor Winnie was the laughingstock  quietly the laughingstock  of the department.All that was left of his claims to significance was his pomposity.He had departed Stanford, and Robert remembered feeling the satisfaction of having done the world a good deed when Blount found his proper place in the scheme of things, becoming an administrator  But he was probably just as good a poet as the new Robert Gu.I wonder if Winnie really knows that ?Of course, Tommie Parker was oblivious of such undercurrents.He responded to Blount's comment as though it were a neutral statement of fact."Someone thinks he's important, Dean.Someone who had the power to slip him past some fairly good commercial security. "He turned to Gu."Think back, Robert.I know you're new to the information scene  and Epiphany obscures an awful lot  but did you notice anything strange today?I mean, before you got to the library?""Well  " He looked into the air above them.His web search was just beginning to show results, text and pics about the "Librareome Project: rescuing prehistory for the students of today. "That was certainly strange stuff.Otherwise there were the floating lights that meant various things.He tried to remember Juan's explanations.Ah .Sharif was back, a ruby icon that hovered just around the corner of the stacks."I've had some help, a grad student named Zulfikar Sharif. ""Were you in contact with him as you came down toward the library?""Yes.Sharif thought I could get in easier if I didn't try to walk through the crowd at the main entrance. "Rivera and Parker exchanged glances."You didn't see the security ribbons?They should have guided you to the south side of building. ""Professor, I think you were hijacked. "Parker nodded."Don't feel bad about it, Robert.That sort of thing happens a lot with wearables.We should track down this 'Zulfikar Sharif character. "Robert pointed to the ruby light."I think he's still here. "The gesture must have been taken as a cue by his Epiphany  somehow making the light a public thing: Rivera looked in the direction he was pointing."Yes!See that, Professor Parker?"Tommie looked down at his laptop and massaged the touchpad."Of course I see him.I'll bet he's been listening via Robert.What say we invite him out for a chat?"Blount was squinting around, hopelessly.Evidently, he couldn't see the ruby glow.Nevertheless he took the question as directed at him."Yes.Do it. "Robert tapped a release.A second passed.The ruby tinkerbell floated down to the edge of the table  and abruptly became a full sized human being, dark skinned, with earnest eyes.Sharif smiled apologetically, and shuffled through the edge of the table to "sit" on a chair on the other side."Thank you so much for invoking me, Professor Gu.And yes," nodding to the others, "I have been listening.Apologies for my various communication problems. ""I call that taking advantage of a beginner's ignorance," said Parker.Blount nodded emphatically."I would say so!I  " He hesitated, seemed to think it over."Ah, hell.What does it matter, Tommie?Everything we're doing today is perfectly open. "Tommie grinned."True!But one thing I've learned is you always look a gift horse in the mouth.Sometimes they turn out to be the Trojan variety. "He looked at the image in his laptop."So, Mr.Sharif, I don't care if you've been eavesdropping or not.Just tell us what you've been doing with Robert Gu.Someone led him down to the service entrance and through all sorts of security. "Sharif smiled hesitantly."In all honesty, I was as surprised as you about that.Professor Gu and I were talking freely when he arrived on campus.He got rather quiet as we came down the slope from your Warschawski Hall.And then for no apparent reason, he turned left and we went around the north side of the library.The next thing I knew he was walking into the freight entrance  and I lost contact.I don't know what more I can say.My own wearable security is of the highest order, of course.um. "He hestitated a moment and then changed topic."Aren't you taking this whole thing in the wrong way?I mean, the Librareome Project will open up all past literature to everyone  and faster than any other project could do it.What is wrong with that?"This last was met with total silence.Winston Blount smiled thinly."I don't suppose you've seen our website?""Ah, not as yet. "He paused and his eyes seemed to be looking far away."Okay, I see what you're saying. "He smiled."I suppose I should be on your side  what you want will keep my 411 job safe!See here, I love the old poets, but old time literature is so hard to get at.If your interest is in post 2000 topics, critical sources are everywhere and research gets results .But for the rest, you have to search through that . "Sharif waved at the orderly ranks of books, the stacks that filled the library's sixth floor."It can take days to gain even trivial insights. "Lazy bum , thought Robert, and wondered at Sharif's earlier enthusiasm for "real books. "But he had noticed the trend even in his own teaching days.It wasn't just the students who refused to get their hands dirty.Even so called researchers ignored the universe of things that weren't online.Winnie glowered at the young man."Mr.Sharif, you don't understand the purpose of the stacks.You don't go into the stacks expecting the precise answer to your burning question of the moment.It doesn't work that way.In all the thousands of times that I've gone hunting in the stacks, I've seldom found exactly what I was looking for.You know what I did find?I found the books on close by topics.I found answers to questions that I had never thought to ask.Those answers took me in new directions and were almost always more valuable than whatever I originally had in mind. "He glanced at Rivera."Isn't that so, Carlos?"Rivera nodded, a little weakly, Robert thought.But Winnie was absolutely right, so right that Robert had to say something on the same side."This is insanity, Sharif.Apparently, the Librareome Project is someone's idea for photographing and then digitizing the Library.But  " suddenly he was remembering things from his last years at Stanford "  didn't Google already do that?""That's true," said Rivera."In fact, that was our first argument, and perhaps still the best one.But Huertas is a great salesman, and he does have arguments in his favor.What he has in mind is fast and very, very cheap.Past digitizations have not been as global or as unified as this will be.And Huertas has lawyers and software that will allow him to render microroyalty payments across all the old copyright regimes  without any new permissions. "Winnie vented a sour laugh."The real reason the administration people bought into this is that they like Huertas's money, and maybe even the publicity.But let me tell you, Mr.Sharif, shredding destroys the books.That is the bottom line.We will be left with a useless jumble. ""Oh, no, Professor Blount.Read the overview.The pictures coming from the camera tunnel are analyzed and reformatted.It's a simple matter of software to reorient the images, match the tear marks and reconstruct the original texts in proper order.In fact  besides the mechanical simplicity of it all  that's the reason for the apparent violence.The tear marks come close to being unique.Really, it's not a new thing.Shotgun reconstructions are classic in genomics. ""Oh, yeah?"Robert picked up the much abused page that he had rescued from the PZ stacks.He held it out like some limp murder victim."So what perfection of software is going to recover something that was torn from its binding and never photographed?"Sharif started to shrug and then saw the expression on Robert's face."Sir, it's really not a problem.There will be some loss, true.Even where everything is properly photoed, the programs will make some mismatches.Potentially, the error rate can be less than a few words per million volumes, far better than even hardcopy republishing with manual copyediting.That's why other major libraries are participating in the project, to get accurate cross checking. "Other major libraries ?Robert realized that his mouth was hanging open.He shut up; he couldn't think of anything to say.Tommie stared into his laptop."You seem suddenly well informed, Mr.Sharif. ""But well, I am wearing," the young man said."Hmpf.And all you really want is to pursue your love of literature. "" Yes!My thesis advisor has based her entire career on Gu's Secrets of the Ages .And now I find out that the great poet is back from Alzheimer's!It's the opportunity of a lifetime Look.If you don't believe the Google bio, check in the 411 directories.I have lots of satisfied customers, many of them literature students at UCSD  not that I give them an unethical degree of help!Not at all. "Aha.Maybe ghostwritten homework was still a no no, even in this brave new world."I don't know what happened with Professor Gu today, but didn't it slow down the Librareome Project?Isn't that what you want?"Blount and Rivera were both nodding agreement."Yup," said Tommie."You're a horse of some kind. ""I am simply a Lit in English student!"Tommie shook his head."You could be almost anything.You could be a committee.When you want to sound like a lit lover, we get chat from a member who knows about poetry. "Tommie tilted back his chair."There's an old saying: The beginning of trust has to be an in person contact.I don't see any usable chain of trust in your biography. "Sharif stood and walked partway through the table.He looked upward, waving his arms at the sky."You want in person?That I can supply.Look down here, at the bench by the footpath. "Tommie tilted his chair still farther back and glanced over his shoulder.Robert walked to the window and looked down.Much of the crowd had dispersed, leaving just a few knots of die hard demonstrators.The footpath was a tiled serpent that wound its way up the hillside, its head reaching just to the edge of the library terrace.It was a very real mosaic, new artwork since Robert's years at UCSD."I came all the way from Corvallis just to see Professor Gu.Please don't turn me away now. "And there by the path was a second Zulfi Sharif, this one not virtual at all.He was looking up at them and waving.13    The Miri Gang Is Born  For as long as Miri could remember, she'd had this problem with grandparents.Alice's parents  and Alice's grandparents, too  had all been living in Chicago; not one of them had survived.On Bob's side of the family, Robert had been almost dead, but then he came back!Now Miri was afraid she was losing him all over again.And then there was Lena  Lena Gu was only dead on the record.Lena had persuaded Bob to set up that lie with the Friends of Privacy.Lena even ordered him to keep the details from Miri.But Bob had told Miri what he was doing.That was smart, because Miri would have figured it all out anyway.This way, Miri was imprisoned by her promises to Bob.She hadn't breathed a whisper of the truth to Robert, even when they were still talking and he had been so desperate.But now Miri was getting desperate.She hadn't seen Lena in five months.Almost, she had called Lena after the Ezra Pound Incident.But that would have only confirmed Lena's opinions of Robert.Bob just wanted to ignore Robert's problems; coward.Alice was no coward, but she was deep in training these days and it wasn't going well.Okay, I can handle this on my own , Miri had told herself.She conceived a clever rehabilitation plan, working with Zulfi Sharif.At first, that had been great.Sharif's wearable had been easy to subvert; she had direct access to Robert.But after Robert's trip to UCSD, she realized that someone else was using Sharif, too.It was definitely time to visit Lena.Miri waited till the weekend and took a car down to Pyramid Hill.The place was really busy on Saturdays.Bob said it reminded him of the arcades of his childhood.You had to travel physically to the park, but once you got there you could do touchy feely with all the best games.It was run by Baja Casinos, but for kids not old enough to legally gamble.The important thing for Miri was that the park had pretty good security.Even if Robert got curious about where she was going, it was unlikely he could follow her through to Lena.She unhooked her bicycle from the rack on the back of the car, and imaged it as a small jackass.Her own persona was classic anime: big eyes, spiky hair, and tiny mouth.That should turn off anyone who might otherwise try to play with her.Miri walked her jackass along a path that circled the hill.She overruled the anime imagery to view what was most popular today.Ugh.It was mostly Scooch a mouti nonsense.Salsipueds and baba llagas were everywhere.A year ago, no one had heard of the Scoochis, and now they were bigger than some of the corporate names.They had even dented the mega release of the latest Cretaceous Returns .There were hundreds of different types of Scoochi characters.Some were slyly stolen intellectual property.The rest were from folklores at the edge of the world.The imagery was very, very cheap, without any creative center.Maybe that's why little kids were the biggest fans.Near the top of the hill, a Lesser Scooch a mout roared into the sky.That sound was not watts from some synthesizer.The departing Scooch a mout was how her view imaged the park's high ride.The ride capsule blasted from deep in the hill, hit four gees before it coasted into the sky, giving its passengers almost a minute of zero gee before touching down in the park annex.It was the most spectacular ride in Southern California.Nowadays Miri's friends sniffed at it: "Might as well be a UP/Ex package. "But when Miri was little, she had spent more than one afternoon bouncing back and forth across the sky.Today, she got halfway to the east exit without choosing a particular game.She was careful not to touch, much less ride, the mechs.She especially avoided the furry cuddly critters.Except at the exits, "You touch, you pay" was the rule at Pyramid Hill.Maybe she should buy into a game just to shed some of the marketing pressure.She paused, looked across the hillside.There was lots of noise and action, but if you listened carefully, you could tell that the kids in the bushes were actually playing in other universes, all choreographed so neither players nor equipment would get in each other's way.She had picked the right cover; classical anime was just too highbrow for these dorks."How about Twin Spirits?You only need two physicals for that. ""Eep !"Miri almost tripped over her jackass.She twisted around, putting the bike between her and the voice.There was a real person, also tricked out in anime costume.Miri dropped down into the true view: Juan Orozco .Talk about bad luck.She had never imagined he would be into classic anime.She found her voice, a trilly high pitched English thing that Annette Russell had given her."Not today, I'm afraid.I'm looking for something grander. "Orozco  and the spiky haired critter he presented  cocked his head questioningly."You're Miri Gu, aren't you?"This was majorly bad etiquette, but what do you expect from an fourteen year old loser?"So?I still don't want to play. "She turned away and pushed her bike along the path.Orozco followed right along.He had a fold up bike that didn't get in his way at all."You know I've teamed with your grandpa in Ms.Chumlig's composition class?""I knew that. "Boogers !If Juan learned what Miri was up to, then Robert might too."Have you been tracking me?""That's not against the law!""It's not polite. "She didn't look at him, just stomped along very quickly."I haven't been watching second by second.I just was hoping to run into you, and then I saw you coming in the west gate" So maybe he had just set up proximity alerts."You know, your grandpa is trying to help me.Like with my writing.I think I'm getting better at it.And I'm teaching him to wear.But I feel sorry for him.He seems to be angry all the time. "Miri kept walking."Anyway, I was thinking if he could get some of his old friends maybe he would feel better. "Miri whirled on him."Are you recruiting?""No!I mean, I have an affiliance that could benefit seniors, but that's not what this is about.Your grandpa is helping me at school, and I want to help him. "They were coming down the Hill, approaching the east gate.This was the last chance for Pyramid Hill to make money.The closer you got to the gate, the harder the sell, across all park supported realities.Furries danced playfully around them, begging to be picked up.The critters were real mechanicals; if you reached out to touch them, you'd find plush, deep fur under your hands, and real heft to their bodies.Near the gate, management wanted to sell these little robots, and a free feel goodbye had swayed thousands of otherwise resistant children.When Miri was younger, she'd bought about one doll a month.Her favorites still played in her bedroom.She rolled her poor jackass through the crowd, avoiding the talking bears and the miniature Scooch a mouts, and the real children.Then they were out the gate.For a moment, Miri fumbled and lost her imagery.Now she was a plain fat girl, and her bike was a dumb machine.Orozco just looked skinny and nervous.He had a shiny new bike, but he couldn't seem to get it unfolded.I don't want him to find out about Lena .She jabbed a finger at the boy's chest."My grandfather is fine.He doesn't need to be recruited into some payoff scheme.Outside of school, you stay away from him. "She flashed imagery that Annette had created for their Avengers clique.The boy flinched."But I just want to help!""And furthermore, if I catch you tracking me" She switched to a deniable mode, a delayed delivery he wouldn't see for several hours.Anonymous  > Juan Orozco: <sm>If you really anger me, your school transcripts will look like you tried to scam them.</sm>  Juan's eyes widened slightly at the sudden silence.He would have some time to stew over what was coming.It was all empty threat of course; Miri believed in obeying the law, even if she might pretend otherwise.She ran her bike a couple of steps and hopped on, and almost fell off.Then she recovered and coasted down the hill, away from Orozco.The Rainbows End retirement community was in a valley northeast of Pyramid Hill.The place was very old and famous.It had been founded sixty years ago, ages before the suburbs ever got out this far.It hit its peak in the early twenty first century, when a wave of newly rich old people had arrived here.Miri pedaled along the bike path, doing her best to stay out of everybody's way.Her guest pass was still valid, but kids were mostly second class citizens at Rainbows End.When she was young, visiting Lena here, she had thought the village was magical.The real lawns were as beautiful as the fake ones in West Fallbrook.There were real bronze statues.The colonnades and brickwork were real too, finer than all but the most expensive of the shopping malls.Since then, she had studied senior issues in school  and there was no way to avoid certain cynical conclusions: There was still some real money in Rainbows End, but it was money spent by people who couldn't do any better.Most of those who remained were living on vapor and biotech promises, unlucky in investment and/or medicine.Orozco had not tried to follow or cover his tracks; she had traced him eastward.He'd finally gotten his bike unfolded and was pedaling toward the Mesitas subdivision.She watched with narrowed eyes.Could Juan Orozco be the punk who'd briefly hijacked Sharif at UCSD?No way.That had been a loud smart aleck who insisted on bragging.More important, Mr.Smart Aleck really was competent, maybe as sharp as Miri herself.Okay.There were more important things to think about.Lena's house was at the far end of the second street up.It was time to image and imagine.She had thought a lot about this meeting, thinking all the things she might say, all the sad things she might see.Miri had constructed a special vision.It was based on things she had been working on in some form since the second grade, when she learned the personal significance of "variant 12 intractable osteoporosis. "First, she made the trees along her path taller and wider, nothing like palms.As she climbed the hill, their high leafiness was replaced by overarching boughs of long needled evergreens.Of course, Miri didn't have any physical support for this.She didn't have game stripes in her shirt; she didn't have micro cooling.The sun still beat on her, even if she made the sky overcast and the trees bend low.Maybe she should think of the heat as some sort of spell.She had thought of doing that before, but there were always other improvements that seemed more important.After all the months of daydreaming, this vision was not beholden to any commercial art.It borrowed from a hundred fantasies, but the effect was Miri's very own, for her concept of Lena.She had not put any of it public.Most visions were much more fun when they were shared, but not this one.Finally, she lurched to a stop and got off the bike.The last couple hundred feet had to be on foot.There were a few other people around, but in her vision they were unremarkable peasants.She saw the sidewalks and wheelchair ramps as forest paths and mossy, timeworn steps.She stumbled more than once on the inconsistencies, but that seemed only fair for a humble petitioner such as herself.And then she was in the inner grove.There were occasional side paths, evidence of cabins hidden deeper in the forest.Her trees were very old here, their huge branches high above her head.Miri walked the bike along the ancient path.The people of the inner grove were higher rank  not in the category of Lena, but still powers to be respected.Miri kept her eyes on the ground and hoped that none of them would talk to her.She made the final turn, walked another fifty feet, to a wide, timbered cabin.When she looked up, she could see breaks in the tree cover, but they didn't reveal sky.Instead she was looking up into sun touched green.The highest crown of the forest canopy stood right above this place.The witchery of witches.The source of elder wisdom.She leaned her bike against the timbers and reached up to hit the massive brass knocker.The sound boomed loud in her ears.She ignored the junky twentieth century melody that actually played; that was the old doorbell that Lena had brought from Palo Alto.A moment passed.Miri heard footsteps from within.Footsteps?The huge door creaked inwards, and Miri's envisioning was confronted with a significant challenge: a woman, not much older looking than the teachers at school.What are you doing here !Miri stared for a moment, speechless.She rarely hit surprises this big.After a moment she recovered herself and nodded respectfully."Xiu Xiang?""Yes.You're Miri, aren't you?Lena's granddaughter?"She stepped aside and gestured Miri in."um, I didn't know you'd recognize me. "Miri stepped indoors, imagining madly.Xiu Xiang looked too young to be a real witch.Okay, I'll make her be Lena's apprentice, a watchamagoogle  a newbie witch !Newbie Xiang smiled."Lena has shown me pictures of you.We even saw you at school once.Lena told me you would come around, um, sooner or later. ""So she'll see me?""I'll ask her. "Miri gave a little bow."Thank you, ma'am. "Newbie Xiang led Miri to an upholstered chair next to a book laden desk."I'll be right back. "Miri settled in the chair.Oops.It was hard plastic.As for the desk well those were real books, the kind some people used for just in time reading.The pages were whatever you wanted, but they were real pages.Of course these were not the thick and hoary things of Miri's imaging, but they were piled deep.There was a view page on top, very much out of place, and a confession of ineptitude.Miri quickly morphed it into a glowing grimoire.She edged forward in her chair and looked at the books.Mechanics and electrical engineering.These would be Newbie Xiang's; Miri had studied the background of all the students in Robert's classes.The box of toys under the desk must be things she had built in shop class.Miri recognized the warped transport tray from the news.What an incredible coincidence that Xiu Xiang was rooming with Lena  There were sounds behind her.The inner door was opening.It was Newbie Xiang, with the senior witch right behind her.Miri was ready with imagery for this.Lena's real chair had six small wheels on articulated axles, very practical and dull.But Mistress Gu's chair had tall wooden wheels, sheathed in silver, and canted outward.Little blue sparks chased each other around the rims as it moved.And Miri imaged Lena dressed in heavy black, a black that absorbed the room's light in the classical magical way.A black that obscured the details of what it clothed.Lena's pointy, brimmed hat was hung jauntily from the chair's high backpost.And that was where Miri's special effects ended.The rest she always kept the way that Lena really was.In fact, all her vision was to give her grandmother the proper frame, one that would reveal how wonderful she truly was.The senior witch looked Miri up and down and then said, "Didn't Bob tell you to let me be?"But she didn't sound as angry as Miri had feared."Yes.But I miss you so much. ""Oh. "She leaned forward slightly."How is your mom, Miri?Is she okay?""Alice is fine. "Lena knew way too much about Alice, but she had no need to know.Besides, she couldn't help Alice."I wanted to talk to you about some other things. "Mistress Gu sighed, and closed her deep set eyes.When she opened them, she might have been smiling."Well, I'm glad to see you, kiddo.It's just that I don't want to argue with you or Bob.And most of all, I don't want You Know Who to know that I'm still around. ""I'll only argue a little bit, Lena. "As much as will make positive headway and still leave me welcome to come visit again ."You don't have to worry about You Know Who. "Mistress Gu's own wording was straight out of fantasy tradition, though it was sad that Robert should be cast as ultimate evil."I promise I won't reveal you to him. "At least, not without your permission ."I took precautions coming here.Besides, You Know Who is no good at snooping. "Lena shook her head."That's what you think. "Newbie Xiang sat down beside the wheelchair and watched them silently.Maybe she could help."You see You Know Who every day, don't you, ma'am?"Miri said."Yes," said Xiang, "in shop class and Louise Chumlig's Search and Analysis. ""Ms.Chumlig's not so bad"  at least for the bonehead classes .Miri was fast enough to squelch the additional comment, but she felt herself blush even so.Newbie Xiang didn't seem to notice."In fact, she's quite good.I've been telling Lena. "She glanced at the senior witch."Louise knows things about asking questions that took me a lifetime to understand.And more than anyone, she's shown me the importance of analysis packages. "She pointed at the old grimoire.Miri was a little taken aback.Yes, Ms.Chumlig was a nice person, but she was full of cliches, and she droned .But even a junior witch is not someone you contradict, and Miri was very anxious to be congenial.She dipped her head, "Yes, ma'am.Anyway, you see a lot of You Know Who.Is he really such a terrible person?"Xiu Xiang shook her head."He is strange.He looks so young .Robert  I mean 'You Know Who'  can be very gracious, and then suddenly cut you dead.I've seen him do that to several children.The old people steer clear of him.I think Winston Blount hates him. "Yes.Miri had watched Winston Blount in the UCSD library last Saturday.Most of her attention had been absorbed in the battle for the persona of Zulfikar Sharif, but she had not missed Blount's hostility.Newbie Xiang glanced at the frail lady in the wheelchair."I'm afraid Lena is right about him.He uses people.He admired my shop project and then walked off with it. "Lena cackled.That was something an elderly person could do well.In Miri's opinion it was the only positive thing about old age."Xiu, Xiu.You told me you were thrilled to see him chop that car. "Newbie Xiang looked embarrassed."Well, yes.I got into science with model rockets and homemade RF controllers.I'd have been nothing without hands on experience.Nowadays, our access to real things is muffled by layers of automated bureaucracy  and I guess my own SHE is partly to blame.So both Robert and I wanted to break something, and I cheered him for acting .But what I wanted was of no concern to him.I was just a convenient tool. "Lena laughed again."You're so lucky.You learned in days what took me years. "She raised a clawed hand to wipe at her hair.Modern medicine had not completely failed Lena Gu.Five years ago she'd had Parkinson's.Miri remembered the tremors.Modern medicine had reversed her Parkinson's, kept her mind sharp, stopped various ills large and small.But her abnormal osteoporosis was still beyond cure.As far back as the second grade, Miri had been able to understand the technical "why" of that.The moral "why" was something even Alice couldn't explain.Miri looked into the wizened face of the senior witch."I I'm glad it took you years to see through You Know Who.Otherwise you two would never have had Bob and raised him to marry Alice and I would never be. "Lena looked away."Yes," she grumped."Bobby was the only reason I stayed with your grandfather.We gave Bobby a good home.And he was halfway human with the boy, at least till it was clear he couldn't run Bob's adult life.By that time, Bob had escaped to the Marine Corps. "Her gaze flickered back to Miri."I congratulate myself on that.I made a terrible mistake marrying your grandfather, but it brought two lovely lives into existence  and it only cost me twenty years. ""Don't you ever miss him?"Mistress Gu's eyes narrowed."That's coming perilously close to arguing with me, young lady. ""Sorry. "Miri came over to kneel on the floor beside Lena's wheelchair.She reached out to hold Lena's hand.The old woman smiled.She knew what was coming, but she didn't have completely effective defenses."You had all those years apart from him.I remember you visiting, back when You Know Who was well and never visited. "Even then, Lena had been a little old lady, a busy doctor who smiled the most when she was talking to Miri."Were you happy then?""Of course!After all those years, I was free of the monster!""But when You Know Who began to lose his mind, then you helped him. "Lena rolled her eyes and looked at Newbie Xiang."When I say the word, you kick this brat back on the street. "Xiang looked uncertain."Um, okay. ""But that's not just yet. "Lena looked back at Miri."We've been over this ground before, Miri.Bob came here to Rainbows End and begged me to help.Remember?He brought you along with him.Bob has never under stood how things were between Robert and me.God bless him, he doesn't realize that all the affection he saw was just for him.But between his pleading and your cute little face, I agreed to help out with the monster's final years.And you know, sometimes dementia softens a person up.There was a year or so, when Robert was nearly helpless, but he could still recognize people and remember our years together  there was a time when he was tractable.We actually got along for a while!"Miri nodded."And then they figured how to cure Robert's brand of dementia.By then your grandfather had declined from tractability into a kind of veggie state.Miri, I would have stuck with him through the end if there hadn't been the miracle cure.But I could see what was coming.The monster would be back. "Lena punched a crooked finger in her granddaughter's direction."Burn me once, shame on him.Burn me twice, shame on me.So I stay out of the picture.Understand?"But her other hand remained in Miri's; the girl gave it a squeeze."But couldn't this be different?By the time they cured Grandfather, part of him had already died. "That had been Jin Li's theory, not Miri's."I know he's often angry now, but that's because he's lost a lot.Maybe the bad things you remember are gone too. "Lena waved her free hand in the direction of Newbie Xiang."Did you hear what Xiu just said about his new nobleness of character?"Miri thought fast: It never worked with Alice, but sometimes a quick change of subject could distract Bob.She glanced at Newbie Xiang."Lena, you've been living here since Grandfather's been sick.You could have moved anywhere since you don't visit us anymore, but you're still just ten miles away. "Lena's chin came up."I've lived in San Diego for years.I'm not going to give up seeing my friends, shopping the old stores, hiking  well I have given up the hiking.The point is that, even resurrected, You Know Who is not going to run my life!""But  " very thin ice here !"did you know Dr.Xiang before?"The senior witch's lips thinned."No.And now you're going to point out, or let plaintive silence imply, that since there are twenty five hundred oldfolks here at Rainbows End, this matchup couldn't be coincidence. "Miri was silent.Finally Newbie Xiang spoke up."It was my choice.I moved down here this summer, about the time I got my get up and go back.I'm one of the older people living at Rainbows End, but I'm so bright and bubbly  " a strange sad smile "  they don't know what to do with me.So I volunteered to be a roommate.It's worked out well.Your grandma is ten years younger than I am, but that doesn't mean so much at our age. "She gave Lena's shoulder a pat.Miri remembered that Lena Llewelyn Gu had done years of psychiatric consulting here at Rainbows End.If anyone could arrange a matchup with Xiu Xiang, it was her.She opened her mouth to remark on this  and noticed the warning glare in Lena's eyes, as clear as any silent messaging could ever be.After a moment, Lena shifted in her chair."See, my girl?Pure coincidence.But I do admit it's been useful.Xiu keeps me advised of You Know Who's adventures in modern education. "She gave a nasty witchy smile that needed no help from Miri's special effects."Yes," said Xiang."We, we have our collective eyes on him. ""The monster is not going catch up with me this time around. "Miri rocked back."You're running a joint entity!"She hadn't dreamed the two witches could be so truly, modernly magical."A what?"said Newbie Xiang."A joint entity.Partners with complementary strengths and weaknesses.In public you are one, represented by the mobile partner.But what you can do and understand is the best of each of you. "Xiang stared at her without comprehension.Oh .Miri pinged both women.Except for Lena's medicals, they were fully offline.Miri had been too distracted by her own imagining."You aren't wearing, are you?"Xiu gestured at her desk."I have my view page and these books.I'm trying to learn so many serious things, Miri.I don't have time to bother with wearing. "Miri almost forgot her mission."Dr.Xiang, you're so wrong about wearables.I mean, hasn't Ms.Chumlig talked about that?Some analysis packages don't have traction if you run them with static video. "Newbie Xiang gave a reluctant nod."She showed me BLAST9.But that just seems to be molecular design dressed up in game toy nonsense. ""But you've only run them on your view page!"The younger witch hunched down."I have so much to learn, Miri.I'm working through the simpler things, what I can run on the view page. "Lena watched the other woman for a second and then she seemed to wilt back into her wheelchair.She looked down at her granddaughter."Poor Miri.You don't understand.You live in a time that thinks it can ignore the human condition. "She cocked her head."You never read Secrets of the Ages , did you?""Of course I've read it!""I'm sorry, Miri, I'm sure you have.After all, it's my beloathed ex husband's most famous achievement.And I'll give him this; those poems are a work of genius.Their 'implacable weight' is all his hurtfulness turned to support great truths.But you can't see that, can you, Miri?You are surrounded by medical promises and halfway cures.It distracts you from the bedrock of reality. "She paused and her head bobbed.It was almost like her old palsy, but maybe this was simply indecision, wondering whether to say more."Miri, the truth is, if we are careful and lucky we live to be old, and weak, and very very tired.There comes an end to striving. ""No!You'll get better, Lena.You've just had bad luck.It's just a matter of time. "There was a whisper of a witchly cackle, and Miri remembered that "It's just a matter of time" was the mantra of Robert's poem cycle.For a moment, grandmother and granddaughter glared certainty at each other.Then Lena said, "And this is about where I figured our chat would come.I'm sorry, Miri. "Miri bowed her head.But I just want to help !Strange.That had been the Orozco kid's whine.To Miri.Okay, maybe he wasn't a complete jerk.And maybe he could help.But there was something else he'd said, and right now it was much more important Yes!Suddenly Miri saw how she could turn defeat into victory.She looked up into her grandmother's face and smiled innocently."Did you know, Lena that You Know Who is learning to wear?"14    The Mysterious Stranger  Even after three weeks, Robert and Juan still did most of their studying in person, right after classes let out.They would walk out to the bleachers and one ignoramus would endeavor to teach the other.Occasionally Fred and Jerry Radner would tag along, unofficial third and fourth ignoramuses.The twins had teamed with each other in Chumlig's composition class, but they seemed to take innocent pleasure in following Robert's progress, offering advice that was more colorful than Juan's, but rarely as useful.Then there was the fifth ignoramus.Xiu Xiang had chickened out of Creative Composition, but she was still taking her other courses at Fairmont.And like Robert, she was learning to wear; nowadays she wore a frilly, beaded blouse  another kind of Epiphany beginner's outfit.She was there the afternoon when Robert and Juan ran into the Chileans.This was out on the track that circled the athletics field.No one else seemed to be around; the varsity teams wouldn't be here for a while yet.Miri  > Juan: <sm>Hey!Wake up, Orozco.Flag down <enum/>.</sm>  Juan  > Miri: <sm>Sorry, I didn't see them.</sm>  Miri  > Juan: <sm>You missed them yesterday, too.Flag them before they shift to the Radners.I told you these guys would make good practice.</sm>  Juan  > Miri: <sm>Okay, okay!</sm>  "Hey," Juan said abruptly, "Dr.Gu, Xiu.Look!"He shipped an enum capability to Robert's Epiphany.It was just like the targets they'd been working with the last few days.The kid claimed that if you practiced, this kind of interaction was as natural as looking at where another person was pointing.It wasn't that easy for Robert Gu.He stopped and squinted at the icon.By default that should force access.Nothing.He tapped on his phantom keypad.He noticed Xiang, a few feet away, doing the same.And then suddenly there were a half dozen students in evidence, all jabbering in Spanish.Miri  > Juan, Lena, Xiu: <sm>Okay, I think Robert sees them.</sm>  Lena  > Juan, Miri, Xiu: <sm>I see them!Can you, Xiu?</sm>  Xiu  > Juan, Lena, Miri: <sm>no yet i must  </sm>  Miri  > Juan, Lena, Xiu: <sm>Don't try to message back, Dr.Xiang.You're not fast enough yet; Robert will get suspicious.Just talk out loud, as if to him and Juan.</sm>  Xiang was silent for a moment, her fingers still tapping.She was even worse at wearing than he was.But then she said, "Yes, I do see them!"She glanced at Juan Orozco."Who are they?""Friends of Fred and Jerry, from way south.Chile. "Miri  > Juan: <sm>Tell them to play synch monster.</sm>  Juan  > Miri: <sm>Okay.</sm>  Juan rattled Spanish at the visitors, almost too fast for Robert to understand.Something about helping beginners with a monster.The others' Spanish was even less intelligible.But maybe that didn't matter.The visitors stepped back, and the space was filled with a shambling purple something .Xiang laughed."I see that too.But the creature it's not even pretending to be real. "Robert leaned close to the lopsided vision."It's pretending to be a stuffed animal," with crudely stitched seams and tufts of stuffing peeking from between the joints.But the vision was almost seven feet tall, and when Robert approached, it shambled back from him.Robert laughed, "I've read about these things. "Lena  > Juan, Miri, Xiu: <sm>I looked it up, Xiu.You move, it moves.But each of you can only control a part of it.</sm>  "Oh. "Xiu Xiang stepped forward, blocking the creature's retreat.Its rear legs stopped but the front kept pushing, and it almost tipped over.Miri  > Juan: <sm>Say the goal is to make it do a graceful dance.</sm>  Juan said, "The goal is we all cooperate to make it move.Dance around it, Xiu. "She did.Music followed her motion.The creature's rear legs reengaged, and its butt end seemed to track her march.The children from Chile thought that was hilarious.When Robert cocked his wrist and wiggled a beat, the music came up.Juan began clapping, and the beast's shoulders twitched to the music.The children from the Far South watched silently for a moment.They looked as solid as the real Juan and Xiu Xiang, but they were no more expert than most San Diego users.Their shadows went the wrong way, and their feet had only a casual acquaintance with the surface of the lawn.But after an instant, the Chileans seemed to hear the music and began clapping too.And now the critter's tail  their domain in this game?began pumping up and down.Robert expanded on his gestures, grabbing control of the creature's floppy claws.For a moment, the monster danced in synch with the music, each gesture consistent.But the network delay was about half a second, and worse, it varied randomly from a tiny fraction of a second to well over a second.The dance got wilder as errors were corrected and overcorrected, until the tail was whacking at the heel claws.The creature rotated onto its back and its legs flailed in random directions.Lena  > Juan, Miri, Xiu: <sm>That was fun!</sm>  "Damn!"said Robert.But everybody was laughing, and not at any particular victim.One by one, the faraway children disappeared, till only the real people were left, Robert and Juan and Xiu Xiang."We could have done better, Juan!"Lena  > Xiu: <sm>See?He's always complaining.Give him another minute and he'll be making sly claims that you are to blame for everything that went wrong.</sm>  Juan was still laughing."I know, I know.But the network link was basura ms odiosa .There are game companies who give you cheapnet for free, because it makes everyone so mad they upgrade to paying status. ""Well then why did we try?""Hey, to practice.For fun. "Robert remembered the inept international choir down at UCSD."We should have used a metronome.Can you bring these kids back?""Nah, we were just like waving to each other.You know, in passing. "In passing."I didn't see them at all until you showed them to me.How busy is the aether?"Robert slashed the air with his hand.How many realities burbled immanent?"Out here in public, it's lots too busy to view all at once.There's probably three or four hundred nodes in line of sight of your Epiphany.Each of those could manage dozens of overlays.In a crowd there'd be hundreds of active realities, and bazillions potentially  "  Miri  > Juan: <sm>Don't go there.My grandfather is smart enough to add up teeny clues and guess at us invisibles.</sm>  Juan  > Miri: <sm>Yeah?Well you're making one clue yourself.Showing Mrs.Gu visible to Xiu just confuses her.Look how she avoids where you have Lena standing.</sm>  The boy seemed to lose his train of thought."Of course, when there are just two or three people around, the laser traffic is mostly just a potential. "They walked farther along the track, the boy demonstrating how to surf through the public views.Robert and Xiu Xiang practiced at his direction, sometimes achieving a consensus view.Xiang seemed more relaxed than at the beginning of the walk; at least she was walking a bit closer to Juan and Robert.But Xiu didn't respond when Robert joked, "I'd say we're getting to be truly awful. "Lena  > Xiu: <sm>See!</sm>  Robert wondered at what a weird duck this Xiang woman was.Xiu Xiang was weird in other ways.Though she had dropped the composition class because she was too shy to perform in front of others, she loved the shop class.Every day she seemed to be playing with something new from the class inventory.That was the only time she was clearly happy, smiling and humming to herself.Some of her projects were obvious to the new Robert, some he could make good guesses about.She was happy to explain them."Maybe there aren't any 'user serviceable parts' inside," she said, "but what I've built, I understand!"She was doing the equivalent of a student semester project every day, and enjoying every minute of it.Xiu wasn't entirely crazy; normally she didn't show up when Robert Gu was teaching Juan.Robert had never taught children, and he didn't like incompetents.For all Juan's good intentions, he was both.And now Robert was pretending to teach him to write."It's easy, Juan," Robert heard himself say.Lies on top of pretense !Well, maybe not: writing crap was easy.Twenty years of teaching graduate poetry seminars had shown him that.Writing well was a different thing.Writing beauty that sings was something that no amount of schooling could teach.The geniuses must take care of themselves.Juan Orozco was distinctly less able than the students of Robert's experience.By twentieth century standards he was subliterate except where he needed words to access data or understand results.Okay, perhaps he was not subliterate.Maybe there was some other word for these crippled children.Paraliterate?And I bet I can teach him to write crap, too .So they sat high in the bleachers, pounding words across the sky, Juan Orozco oblivious of the runners below and the games far away.There came a time when he didn't play with his fonts anymore.There came a day when he wrote something that had affect and image.It was not utter crap.It was almost up to the standards of muddled cliche.The boy stared into the sky for half a minute, his jaw slack."That is so bitchin'.The words, they make me see things. "His gaze flickered sideways, to Robert.A smile spread across his face."You with wearing, me with writing.We're getting really good!""Perhaps equally so. "But Robert couldn't help smiling back.A week passed.Most evenings, Robert had interviews with Zulfi Sharif.After school and sometimes on weekends, he and Juan worked together.Much of that was remote now.They were still flailing around for a semester project.More and more, Robert was intrigued with the problem of far coordination.Games, music, sports, it all got jittery beyond a few thousand miles and a couple dozen routers.The boy had bizarre plans for how they might put everything together."We could do something with music, manual music.That's lots easier than game synchronization. "Robert went for hours at a time without thinking about his demented, maimed condition.These school projects were more interesting to the new Robert Gu than Sharif's admiring interviews  and far more interesting than his occasional visits to UCSD.The library shredding had been temporarily suspended, apparently due to the demonstration and his own unintendedly dramatic appearance there.But without the demonstrators, the library was a dead place.Modern students didn't have much use for it.There was just Winnie's "Elder Cabal" up on the sixth floor, rebels whose cause was suddenly on hold.Robert and Xiu Xiang had mastered most of the Epiphany defaults.Now when he looked at a real object in "just that way," explanations would pop up.With the proper squint or stare at attendant icons, he got the added detail he wanted.Look at the object a different way, and he often could see through and beyond it!Xiu wasn't as good as Robert with the visuals.On the other hand, if she didn't get flustered, she was better at audio searches: when you heard a word you didn't know, if you could tag it, then search results would appear automatically.That explained the marvelous vocabulary  and equally marvelous screwups  he noticed in the children's language.Miri  > Juan: <sm>You should tell him that the nondefaults are a lot harder.</sm>  Juan  > Miri: <sm>Okay.</sm>  "You know, Dr.Gu, you and Xiu are, um, really good with the defaults.But we should work on the nondefaults, too. "Xiang nodded.She was remote today, too, though not as realistically as Juan Orozco.Her image was perfectly solid, but her feet were melted into the bleacher bench in front of her, and occasionally he got glimpses of  background?Her apartment?He kidded her about that, but as usual when he made a joke, it just made her even more quiet.Lena > Juan, Miri, Xiu: <sm>What!What did he see?</sm>  Miri  > Juan, Lena, Xiu: <sm>Not to worry.Xiu has a good background filter.Besides, you're in the kitchen and she's sitting in the living room.</sm>  Robert turned back to Juan."So what are the most useful nondefaults?""Well, there's silent messaging.The bit rate is so low, it works when nothing else does. ""Yes!I've read about sming.It's like the old instant messaging, except no one can see you're communicating. "Juan nodded."That's how most people format it. "Lena  > Juan, Miri, Xiu: <sm>No!Let the SOB learn sming on his own!</sm>  Miri  > Juan, Lena, Xiu: <sm>Please, Lena!</sm>  Juan > Lena, Miri, Xiu: <sm>It's something everyone uses, ma'am.
