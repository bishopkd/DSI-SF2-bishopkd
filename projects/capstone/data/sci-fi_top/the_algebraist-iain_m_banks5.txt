It was pointing something long and dark at them.The Administrator groaned.Oh no, she said.That is the press.Sholish!My good cuirass, you witless rind nibbling waste of gas!Ysul threw a piece of armour across the room at his servant.The camo painted carbon plate spun through the gas, changing colours rapidly as it tried to adapt, narrowly missed several other Dwellers  the large room was crowded and people had to duck, bob or dodge  just avoided Sholish and embedded itself in a FloatTree panel, producing a distinct thunk.Before it had much of a chance to blend in, Sholish tugged it out of the wall and disappeared into a side chamber, muttering.Excuse me, Colonel Hatherence said sharply to a Dweller whod just bumped into her in the general shuffling that had spread through the room to give the thrown piece of armour a clear trajectory.Excused!the Dweller said, then continued his conversation with another of Ysuls relations.Ysul was getting ready to quit Hauskip and leave for the war along with his charges, Fassin and the oerileithe.His new combat clothing had arrived just that morning (kudos enhancingly quickly!)along with various gifts from friends and family, most of whom, it seemed, had thought it best to show up in person to present their mostly useless or positively dangerous gifts and offer vast amounts of generally contradictory but extremely loudly proffered advice.Ysul, flattered and excited to be the centre of so much attention, had invited them all into his dressing room for snacks and whatever while he tried on all his new clothing, checked that his antique, inherited familial armour still more or less fitted and played with all the new bits and pieces hed been given.Fassin counted over thirty Dwellers in the chamber, which was one of the larger spaces in the wheel shaped house.There was a saying to the effect that one Dweller constituted an argument in waiting, two a conspiracy and three a riot.Quite what a gathering of thirty plus was supposed to represent he wasnt sure, but it would assuredly have nothing to do with silence or subtlety.The noise rang off the curved walls.The clothing competed for loudness.Expressive patterns spread across exposed carapace skin like flip books of geometric artwork.Magnetic chatter swirled, infrasound bounced confusion from one wall to another and a heady mix of pheromones bathed the place in frantic currents of Dweller hilarity.Are there other guides cum guards we might employ beside this one?Hatherence asked, pressing up to the wall beneath where Fassin floated as another Dweller bearing gifts arrived and pushed his way through the throng towards Ysul.Not really, Fassin told her.Ysul suffered a significant kudos loss within the Guard mentors Guild taking on an alien outworlder, back when he agreed to be Uncle Sloviuss mentor.He got that back eventually but it was a brave thing to do.Few of them will accept that kind of loss.Starting from scratch to find somebody new would take years, even if Ysul did agree.Something small, round, pink and gooey bumped into the top of the colonels esuit, and stuck.She batted it away.What are all these things?she said, exasperated.Just hospitality, Fassin sent, with a resigned expression.Floating, drifting round the room were bobfruits, flossballs, chandelier gumbushes and wobbling breezetrays loaded with sweetmeats, mood balloons, narcopastes and party suppositories.The guests helped themselves, eating, ingesting, snorting, rubbing and inserting away as appropriate.The noise seemed to be swelling by the minute, as was the collision rate  always a sure indicator that Dwellers were getting out of it (lots of loud bumps, hasty cries of Excuse me!, sudden, alarming tiltings, and bursts of the sort of especially raucous laughter which invariably accompanied the realisation by a Dweller that one of its companions had lost control of their buoyancy).Oh dear, Fassin said.I do believe this is turning into a party.Are these people intoxicated?Hatherence asked, sounding genuinely shocked.Fassin looked at her, letting his incredulity show.Colonel, he told her,  they are rarely anything else.There was a bang and a yelp from somewhere near where Ysul floated.A bobfruit exploded in mid gas and fell limply to the floor.People nearby wiped foamy pieces of fruit off their clothes.Oops!Ysul said, amidst widespread laughter.He cant be the only guide!the colonel protested.What about other Seers?They must have guides too.They do, but its a one to one thing, an exclusive relationship.Abandoning your Guard mentor would be a terrible insult.Theyd lose all kudos.Major Taak, we cannot afford to be sentimental here!If there is even a possibility that we might find a better, less idiotic guide, we ought at least to start looking.The Guard mentors are a Guild, colonel.They run a closed shop.If you dumped one of them, none of the rest would touch you.Youd certainly then find some clown whod offer to act as a guide, mentor, guard, whatever  in fact theyd probably have to form a queue  but theyd be very young and stupid, or very old and, ah, eccentric, and theyd assuredly get you into far more trouble than they were ever likely to get you out of.The Guard mentors Guild would harass them from the start, for one thing, and the vast majority of other Dwellers wouldnt talk to you at all.Librarians, archive keepers, antiquarians, exo specialists  all the people we most need to talk to, in other words  in particular would not even give you the time of day.They made room for Ysuls servant, Sholish, returning from the side chamber with a two piece, highly polished, mirror finished cuirass.Sholish was an adolescent, only a few hundred years old, barely three quarters grown and skinny.Personal servants, always at least two generational stages younger than their masters, were fairly common in Dweller society, especially where the senior Dweller was bothering to pursue a hobby cum profession which actually involved a degree of study and\or training, when the servant had a fighting chance of picking up the basics of the given trade.The better masters regarded their servants more as apprentices than servants and the occasional especially aberrant ones treated their underlings almost as equals.Ysul had yet to fall prey to such sentimentality.And about time, you custard brained phlegm wart!Ysul yelled, snatching the cuirass from Sholishs grasp.Did you have to forge and weave the armour yourself?Or did you start gazing at your own reflection and lose all track?Sholish mumbled, retreated.I refuse to accept that we are as powerless as you imply, major, the colonel told Fassin.He turned to look at the oerileithe.We are here very much on sufferance, colonel.The Dwellers can go off entire species of Seers, for no accountable reason.Nobodys ever worked out a pattern to this.You just suddenly find that you and your kind arent welcome any more.It doesnt usually happen while theyre still getting to know a new to civilisation species, but even thats no guarantee.They certainly get fed up with individuals  Ive seen it happen  and thats equally random.Every time I come down here I have to accept that no matter how friendly and helpful everybody might have been during my last visit  (the colonel gave a sceptical laugh)  they might have nothing more to do with me this time or ever again.In fact, they might tell me Ive got a day to get out or become the object of a hunt.And a Seer faces that prospect every single time they delve, either remotely or directly.We just have to get used to it.They dont even need to have met you; there are records of Seers to be whove spent decades getting trained up, whove been part of respected Seer Septs going back millennia whove been about to go on their very first delve and been told not to bother and to stay away for ever.Its a minor miracle theyve accepted you the way they have.And dont forget the only reason youre not constantly being challenged as an interloper is because Ysul is on record as vouching for you.You are saying we are stuck with this buffoon.We are.I know its hard to believe, but hes one of the better ones.Core help us.Why waste time?I shall apply for my posthu mous decoration immediately.The Volunteer Guild of Guard mentors existed to look after Dwellers visiting from other bands of the same planet, or, very rarely, from another gas giant, usually one within the same stellar system.Dwellers  almost always alone  did make journeys from one stellar system to another, but it didnt happen often and it usually meant that the individual concerned had been thrown out of their own home gas giant for some particularly heinous crime or unforgivable character defect.The Dwellers had pretty much stopped making deep space trips en masse after the Second Diasporian Age, when the galaxy had been half the age it was now.It was generally held that seven billion years lack of practice probably accounted for the sheer awfulness of Dweller spaceship design and building standards, though Fassin wasnt convinced that cause and effect hadnt been confused here.They were due to leave for the war zone the following day.The interval since the frustrating audience with the City Administrator had been spent fending off Dweller journalists and their news remotes and trying to find out what they could about events in the wider system.Eventually theyd had to compromise and trade.One journalist got a very guarded but exclusive interview from Fassin (very guarded indeed  Colonel Hatherence kept coughing loudly whenever they approached any subject remotely to do with their mission) in return for news of the outside.The Third Fury moon had been devastated and all on or in it had perished.There was no news of a drop ship surviving, though equally there was no news of any wreckage from such a ship being found.However, of course, if it had just dropped into the Depths Many satellites had been destroyed or damaged.Those belonging to the Quick (this meant the Mercatoria) appeared to be either missing or out of action.Some warships belonging to the current local Quick species had spent an amount of time investigating the rubble of the moon Third Fury.The moon glantine appeared much as it always had.Stellar system ship traffic appeared light, as it had for some days now, but not anomalous.A signal had been sent on the behalf of Oculan Colonel Hatherence, on the authority of Guard mentor Ysul of Hauskip, to the moon glantine.No reply had yet been received.Nothing untoward had happened to the transmitting station responsible following the transmission.According to the journalist, this was all stuff they could have found out themselves, eventually.The trick was knowing where to look.The journalist seemed to feel miffed that theyd got the better end of the deal, too, because everything hed told them was at least ninety per cent true, specifically to avoid upsetting them.He knew aliens could be funny that way.What, exactly, did your friend say?He said they wanted him to to gas line a whole bunch of stuff for Im pretty certain those were his exact words.Then he seemed to realise he was saying too much, giving too much away, and he changed the subject.The hesitation, that sudden change of subject made the earlier form of words all the more important.He realised he was speaking to somebody who spent a lot of his life in Nasqueron, who might not feel the same way he would about the implications of what he was talking about.This was spoken in?Humanised G Clear, very close to this.Meanings are pretty much identical, just altered pronunciation for the human voice.No Anglish words involved?None.So, he said gas lined not streamlined or air lined?One wouldnt say air lined as far as I know.The normal form of words would be streamlined.He chose gas lined without thinking because it was more technically correct, because it has a narrower meaning.In this context it means altering a vacuum capable craft so that it can also operate in an atmosphere like Nasquerons.Which you take to mean that an invasion or large scale destructive raid upon us is imminent?I think some sort of raid is a distinct possibility.This seems a thin thread to hang such a weighty fear upon.I know.But please understand, the guys company builds and refits three quarters of the systems war craft.The phrase gas lined is quite specific and that sudden change of tack when he realised he was talking to somebody who might be sentimentally or emotionally attached to Nasqueron and sympathetic towards Dwellers is significant.I know this man, Ive known him since I was a child.I know how his mind works.Attempting to invade a gas giant would, nevertheless, be a momentous action.In seven thousand years, the Mercatoria has done no such thing.The situation is desperate for them locally.They are under threat of invasion within the year.A standard year, not one of yours.Help is at least one more standard year away beyond that.In fact, the invasion may already be beginning.The attacks on Third Fury and the Mercatorias other assets around Nasq.could be part of it.And attempting to invade us helps them how?They think there may be something here which will make a difference.Some information.Thats why Im here, to look for it.But if they thought I was dead or not likely to succeed, the Mercatoria might intervene directly.Plus the invaders the Mercatoria is worried about might well think the same way with even less cause to hesitate.I get the impression the future continuance of Dweller Studies is kind of low on their set of priorities.Fassin, what sort of information could possibly make such a course of action seem sensible?Important information.More specifically?Very important information.You are not willing to tell me.Willing or able.Best you dont know.So you tell me.If I thought the specifics would help convince you, Id let you know, Fassin lied.He was talking to a Dweller called Setstyin.Setstyin liked to call himself an influence pedlar, which was a humble term for somebody with contacts extending as high as his went.Dweller society was remarkably flat in terms of social hierarchy  flat as the surface of a neutron star compared to the sheer verti cality of the Mercatorias baroque monstrosity  but to the extent that there was a top and bottom of society, the suhrl Setstyin was in touch with both.He was a society host and a part time social worker, a hospital visitor and a friend to the great and good as far as either could be said to exist in Dweller terms; a sociable, clubbable creature intensely and genuinely interested in other people, more so even than in kudos (this made him very unusual, even strange, almost threatening).He was, in human terms, somewhere between a total geek and very cool.His geekiness was that bizarre failure to care about the one thing that everybody agreed really mattered: kudos, while his coolness came from the same source, because not caring about kudos  not obsessing about it, not chasing it down wherever it might be found, not constantly measuring ones own coolness against that of ones peers  was in itself kind of cool.As long as there was not the faintest shadow of a suspicion he was playing some weird back game, deliberately pursuing kudos by pretending not to, so long as his lack of interest in it was seen as being the unaffected carelessness of a kind of wise naif, he was kudos rich, though in a curiously unenviable way.(It had been Slovius who had first explained to Fassin how kudos worked.Fassin had thought it was a bit like money.Slovius had explained that even money wasnt like money used to be, but anyway kudos was sometimes almost an opposite.The harder youd worked for your kudos, the less it was worth. )Setstyin was also one of the most sensible, level minded Dwellers Fassin had ever encountered.And he treated a request by a mere human to wake up, speed up and converse over the phone with a degree of respect and seriousness that few other Dwellers would have.Fassin had told Hatherence he needed time to let his human brain and body sleep, and his arrowcraft self repair and recharge itself.Hed retreated to the long spoke room hed been allocated in Ysuls house.This was a dark and dusty gallery littered with piles of discarded clothes, lined with ancient wardrobes and floored with out of favour paintings and crumpled wall hangings.There was a double dent Dweller bed in there too and a treefoam lined cubby by one wall, so it kind of constituted a bedroom, not that Fassin or his gascraft really needed such a thing.Fassin had secured the door, used the little arrowcrafts sonic senses to locate a removable ceiling panel and exited through the double skin roof into a breezy and relatively dark night.Like all Dweller cities, Hauskip was situated in a historically calm patch within its atmospheric volume, but cities still had weather.They experienced pressure differentials, squalls, fog, rain, snow, crosswinds, upwellings, down draughts, lateral force and spin, all depending on the state of the gas stream around them.Moderately buffeted, half hidden by the shreds of thicker gas scudding across the lamplit night, Fassin had made his way up and out across the sheen of rooftops.Sky traffic had been relatively light  most travel would be within the spindles and spokes linking the citys main components  but there had been a few Dwellers roting about in the distance, and enough small craft  packet delivery machines, mostly  for Fassin to hope he was going unremarked.Distant lightning had flickered deep below.Fassin had come to a dangling wave guide cable a few centimetres thick, followed it up to a deserted public plaza like a vast, empty bowl circled with dim, attenuated lights, and found a public screen booth.Setstyin was also in the equatorial band, though on the other side of the planet.Fassin might therefore have hoped to find him awake at such a time, but Setstyin had been sleeping off the effects of an especially good party hed hosted the night before.Dwellers could go for tens of their days without sleep but when they did sleep they tended to do so on a prodigious scale.Fassin had begged and pleaded with Setstyins servant to have him woken and even then it had taken a while.Setstyin looked and sounded groggy, but it appeared that his mind was fully awake inside there somewhere.And you would like me to do what?Setstyin asked.He scratched at his gill fringe with one spindle arm.He was wearing a light sleep collar round his mid hub, which was regarded as a polite minimum when addressing someone other than a close friend or family member over the phone.Dwellers were hardly self conscious about showing their inner hub mouth parts and pleasure organs, but there was a degree of decorum in such matters, especially when confronted with an alien.What shall I say, Fassin, and to whom?A gust of wind made the arrowcrafts vanes purr to hold it in place as Fassin looked into the camerascreen.Convince whoever you can, preferably as high as you can reach, preferably discreetly, that there really is a threat.Give them time to decide what theyre going to do if there is a raid.It may be best just to let it happen.What you dont want to do is have an unthinking hostile reaction that leads to some maniac Quick nuking a city or two to try to teach you a lesson.Setstyin looked confused.How would that benefit anybody?Please, just trust me  its the sort of thing Quick species do.You want me to talk to politicians and military people, then, yes?Yes.Politicians and military people in Dweller society were as much amateurs and dilettantes as gifted tailors or devout party throwers like Setstyin  possibly a little less dedicated  but you had, Fassin reflected, to work with what you were presented with.Setstyin looked thoughtful.Theyre not going to go with an invasion.This was true, Fassin supposed.In the full sense of the word an invasion was impossible.The Ulubis forces were hopelessly inadequate for the task of occupying a volume as great as Nasqueron or any other gas giant, even if it had been inhabited by a congenitally peaceful, naturally subservient and easily cowed species rather than, well, Dwellers.Attempting to control the place with Dwellers around would be like peeing into a star.The danger was that, in carrying out a raid to secure a given volume for long enough to hunt down the information they were looking for, the Mercatoria would cause the Dwellers to react as though they were undergoing a full scale invasion.It seemed to be part of Dweller psychology that if something was worth reacting to, it was even more worth overreacting to, and Fassin dreaded to think what that might imply for all sides.Stress an extended raid and temporary site occupation with aggressive patrols that might be mistaken for an invasion.Whereabouts?Setstyin asked.Or are you really going to tell me you have no idea?I understand were going to be looking in or very near the new Formal War zone.Setstyin let his hub arms droop down at his side.This was something like a human rolling their eyes.Well, of course, where else?I dont suppose theres the slightest possibility that the war might be cancelled or postponed?There is always a chance, but it certainly wont have anything to do with a mere party animal like myself having a word in even the highest placed ear.Think: there might be the possibility of genuine hostile action against us, an act of alien aggression within the winds of Nasqueron itself and the suggestion is we call off a Formal War?More likely well start a few more to show how jolly fierce we are and get some practice in.Just thought Id ask.When do you set off for the war zone?Tomorrow morning, Hauskip local time.There you are.In plenty of time for the wars opening ceremony  I may have other things on my mind.Hmm.You realise that me having a word on high may well result in you being tracked, watched by interested parties?Whereas that would never happen normally?But yes, I realise that.Well, I wish you well, Fassin Taak.Thanks.Setstyin peered at the camerascreen, looking at Fassins surroundings.Ysul out of kudos with the phone operators?I have an additional Guard mentor in the shape of an oerileithe Mercatoria military colonel.She might not understand my concern.I sneaked out to make the call.Very cloak, very dagger.Good luck with your quest, Fassin.Do keep in touch.* * *  If youre watching this, Sal, then Im dead.Obviously I dont know what the circumstances of that death may have been.Like to think I died bravely and honourably in combat.Kind of dont think youll be watching this because my clogs were popped peacefully in my sleep because I dont mean for that to happen, at least not until somethings happened that involves you.Dying peacefully actually, hopefully, that would mean youre already dead.The thing that involves you sort of involves Fass, too, though not in the same way.Involves you and me and Fass and Ilen.Poor dead Ilen.Ilen Deste, Sal.You remember her?Maybe you dont.Its been so long, for all of us, for all these strange different reasons that end up being just the same.You with your treatments, Fass with his slowtime, me all Einsteined out with too much time near light speed.Time hasnt ever caught up with any of us, has it, Sal?But Im thinking you probably do remember Ilen and what happened to her, because it was all so traumatic for us, wasnt it?You dont forget anything about something that dramatic and horrible, not really.How can you?You have nightmares about it, it sneaks up on you even in the day sometimes, too.Do you find that?I get that.Sometimes its something really obvious, like seeing something on screen of somebody hanging by their fingertips over a drop, especially if its a woman.Of course in the screen they usually get rescued.Not always, but usually.But then other times what happened just ambushed me.Ill be doing something completely normal, with no cues, no stimulus that you can see any logical reason would trigger the memories, and suddenly Im there, Im back again, back in that big old motherfucker of a ship, with you and Fass and Ilen.Do you get that?I get it still, even after all these years.Youd have thought it would have stopped happening by now, wouldnt you?Hell, even without all those stolen years near c, youd have thought it should have, you know, withered, fallen away?Look at me; sixty one years old, body time, they tell me.Fitter than ever, still bedding guys a third my age, and  do I look sixty?Hope not.But I should have got over the whole thing by now, dont you think?Time a great healer and all that.Just hasnt happened.So, do you get anything similar?Is this ringing any bells at all?Really, Id like to know.Maybe well find out, one day.Maybe Ill have got to ask this and youll never get to see this but well have found out together.Maybe somebody else will get to see this.It isnt really meant for anybody else, but, well, this is a high risk occupation, and who knows whatll happen after this is made?Anyway, point is: I know what happened, and I intend to kill you, Sal.Or, I did.As I say, if it is you whos watching this, Im dead and youre still alive.But I want you to know it isnt going to end there.Got serious intentions of pursuing you from beyond the grave, Sal, old son.Wont be easy, realise that, but Ive spent my entire career getting myself into a position of power.Making myself so powerful within the Navy that I can click my fingers and battleships power up, set course and ship out.Building networks, making friends, finding allies, taking lovers, taking exams, running risks, all so that Ill have the power one day to challenge a man who, oh, must nearly own the system by now.The portal collapse nearly threw me  put my plans back a long way  but I reckon youll still be alive and loving life when I finally do get home, or when whats planned to happen in the event of my death starts happening.Cant tell you too much, obviously.No reason to give you any sort of warning at all.And all the advantages are on your side already, arent they?Well, maybe apart from surprise.You surprised now?If youre listening to this, watching this?Wondering whats going to happen??Well, wonder away.Wonder away, Sal, and dont stop wondering, dont stop being frightened, because being frightened might keep you alive a bit longer.Not too long.Definitely not too long, but long enough.I suppose thats enough now, dont you think?Definitely the longest speech either of us ever delivered even while we were together, way back when, wouldnt you say?Maybe almost more than we ever said to each other put together.Well, almost.Let me explain, in case you still havent got it: I saw the marks, Sal.I saw the three red lines on your neck, before you put your jacket collar up.Remember that?Remember pretending to shiver and saying, C collar, or whatever it was?Remember?Just one of those little false notes that you dont notice at the time because of all the fear and adrenalin, that doesnt start to nag at you until long afterwards.Kept that collar up afterwards, too, didnt you?Kept the jacket on like some sort of comfort blanket until you could get to a bathroom and a first aid kit, didnt you?I remember.And when I was reaching down to Ilen, I saw her fingernails.With the blood under them.Saw them very distinctly.Fass didnt; still has no idea, even yet.But I saw them.I wasnt entirely sure about the marks on your neck, but then I checked.Remember that last farewell fuck, a couple of weeks later?Just checking.They were very faint by then, of course, but they were there all right.You always wanted her, didnt you, Sal?Always so desired the beautiful Ilen.Did you think because she went into the ship with you she was saying yes?Did you?Did she, then changed her mind?Doesnt really matter, I suppose.I saw what I saw.You know whats funny, too?I was there, even if you werent.Ilen and I.  Just the once, but thats something else Ill never forget, either.Oh, youd have loved to have been there for that, wouldnt you?Bet you would.I slept with Fass, too, afterwards, just to complete the set.Much better than you, by the way.The uniformed figure sat forward, right up to the camera, staring into it, voice going quiet and low.Iwas coming to get you, Sal.If youre watching this then I didnt make it, not personally, but even from beyond the grave, Im still fucking coming to get you.The image froze, then faded.A hand, shaking only slightly, reached out and turned the viewer off.FOUR:  EVENTS DURING WARTIME   It was a truism that there was not just one galaxy, there were many.Every variety of widely spread sentient life  plus a few creat categories which were arguably non sentient though still capable of interstellar travel  and sometimes even every individual species type tended to have one galaxy to itself.The Faring  a trans category that covered all such beings able and willing to venture beyond their own immediate first habitats  were like the citizens of a vast, fully three dimensional but mostly empty city with multitudinous and varied travel systems.The majority of people were content to walk, and made their slow progress by way of an infinitude of quiet, effectively separate deserted streets, quiet parks, vacant lots, remains of wasteland and an entire unmapped network of paths, pavements, alleys, steps, ladders, wynds and snickets.They almost never encountered anybody en route, and when they got to where they were going, it would be somewhere very similar to the place they had departed from, whether that place had been a stars photosphere, a brown dwarfs surface, a gas giants atmosphere, a comet cloud or a region of interstellar space.Such species were generally called the Slow.The Quick were different.Mostly originating from rocky planets of one sort or another, they lived at a higher speed and could never be content forever plodding from place to place.That they had been forced to do so until a viable wormhole network had been established was regarded as quite bad enough.Wormhole access portals were the pinch points of the worm hole system  the citys underground stations  where people of varying species types were forced to meet and to some extent mingle, though given the tiny amount of time one spent near a portal or within a wormhole, even this seemingly profound tying together made very little difference to the ultimate unconnectedness of the many different life strands, and both before they gathered and after they dispersed, the users of the system still tended to congregate at places specific to their own comfort criteria, usually quite different from those of all the others.Many people regarded the Cincturia as the equivalent of animals: birds, dogs, cats, rats and bacteria.They too lived in the city, but were not responsible for it or entirely answerable to it, and were often to a greater or lesser degree inimical to its smooth running.Accounting for the Rest  the non baryonic Penumbrae, the 13 D Dimensionates and the flux dwelling Quantarchs  was a little like discovering that the ground, the fabric of the citys buildings and their foundations plus the air itself were each home to another sort of life altogether.The Mercatoria  largely but not entirely made up the galaxys current crop of oxygen breathers  inhabited its own galaxy, then, as did all the other categories of life, and all these different galaxies existed alongside every other one, each interpenetrating the rest, surrounded by and surrounding the others, yet hardly affecting or being affected by them, except, sometimes, through the inestimably precious and all too easily destroyed wormhole network.Us?Oh, we were like ghosts in the cabling.* * *   Slave children were crawling along the giant blades of one of the Dreadnoughts main propellers, packing welding gear, back sacks of carbon weave and heavy glue throwers.The pulsing drone of the vessels engines and main propulsion thrummed through the wrap cloak of brown, billowing mist, filling the slipstreamed gas and the structure of the huge ship with buzzing, building, rising and fading harmonics like a vast unending symphony of industrial sound.Fassin and the colonel watched from an open gantry overlooking the ring of giant engines as the two teams of Dweller infants crawled along the massive blades to the warped and flapping blade ends.The starboard most propeller had been hit by a section of DewCloud root.The root had fallen out of the clouds above, probably from a dying DewCloud floating and decomposing tens of kilometres above.DewClouds were enormous, foamy plants anything up to ten kilometres across and five or six times that in height.Like all gas giant flora, they were mostly gas  a Dweller in a hurry could probably rip right through the canopy of one, hardly noticing they were in the midst of a plant, not an ordinary cloud.To a human they looked like some monstrous cross between an elongated mushroom and a jellyfish the size of a thunder cloud.Part of an Ubiquitous clade, found wherever Dwellers were, they harvested water condensation out of Dwellerine gas giant atmospheres, using their dangling, thick and relatively solid roots to exploit the temperature difference between the various atmospheric layers.When they approached the ends of their lives they floated up to the cold cloud tops and the higher haze layers, and bits broke off.The Dreadnought had prop guards to stop floating\falling\ rising stuff interfering with its main propulsion units, but the section of root had slipped in between the guard and the propeller itself, wreaking brief havoc with the thirty metre long vanes before being chewed up and thrown out.Now the child slaves had to climb out along the blades, from the hubs to the tips, to make repairs.Shaped like slim deltas with thin, delicate looking tentacles which had to both clamp them on to the still revolving blades and hold the various repair materials, the infants were making heavy weather of it.Dweller officers in motor skiffs rode nearby, bellowing orders, threats and imprecations at the young.They could just stop the fucking propeller, the colonel shouted to Fassin.The open gantry they were holding on to was four fifths, of the way back from the bulbous nose of the giant ship, an ellipsoid a little over two kilometres in length and four hundred across the beam.The Dreadnoughts twenty four giant engine sets protruded from near its rear in a monumental collar of pylons, wires, tubular prop guards and near spherical engine pods.The wind howled round Hatherences esuit and Fassins little arrowcraft.Slow them down too much, apparently!Fassin yelled back.The Dreadnoughts captain had cut the starboard most engine set to quarter power to give the slave children a better chance of completing their repairs without too many casualties.The ships giant rudders, mounted on the octiform tailplane assembly just aft of the engines, were appropriately deployed to compensate for the resulting skewed distribution of thrust.Fassin glimpsed an escort cruiser through a short lived break in the clouds a few kilometres away.Other Dreadnoughts and their escorting screens of minor craft were spread out around them in a front a hundred kilometres across and thirty deep.A slave child near one of the vane tips lost its grip and whirled off the end with a distant shriek, crashing into the inner edge of the outer prop guard.Its scream cut off and the limp body was caught in the combined prop wash and sent whirling back, narrowly avoiding a further collision with the tail assembly.It disappeared behind a giant vertical fin.When it came back into sight it was already starting to spiral slowly down into the enveloping cloud haze.None of the skiff riding Dwellers spared it a second glance.The dozens of remaining slave children continued to inch their way along the giant blades.Fassin looked at the colonel.Woops, he said.They were hitching a ride to the war zone.A TunnelCar had taken them from Ysuls house  well, two TunnelCars, a second proving necessary to carry all Ysuls baggage and extra clothing, plus Sholish  to the Central Station.From there they joined a long distance train of ninety or so cars making its way towards the border of Zone Zero  the equatorial zone  and Band A, twenty thousand kilometres away.Ysul spent a large part of the journey complaining about his hangover.You claim to have been around in your present form for ten billion years and you still havent developed a decent hangover cure?Hatherence had asked, incredulous.Theyd been floating in a restaurant car, waiting for the galley to figure out the exact chemical composition of oerileithe food.Ysul, his voice muffled, issuing from within a translucent coverall that was the Dweller equivalent of dark glasses, had replied, Suffering is regarded as part of the process, as is the mentioning of it.As is, one might add, the sympathy one receives from ones companions.The colonel had looked sceptical.I thought you felt no pain?Mere physical pain, no.Ours is the psychic pain of realising that the world is not really as splendid as it seemed the evening before, and that one may have made something of a fool of oneself.And so on.I wouldnt expect a little dweller to understand.Theyd detrained at Nuersotse, a sphere city riding mid altitude in the boiling ragged fringes of the equatorial Belts northern limits.Nuersotse was barely thirty kilometres in diameter, relatively dense by Dweller city standards and built for strength and manoeuvrability.High speed transport craft left in convoys every hour or so, as one of the Band Border Wheels swung near.Theyd crossed on the Nuersotsian Guephuthen Band Border Wheel One, a colossal, articulated structure two thousand kilometres across held rotating on the border of two atmospheric gas giant bands, protruding a kilo klick into each, its whole enormous mass spun by the contra rotating gas streams on either side.Band Border Wheels were the largest moving structures most gas giant planets possessed, if one discounted the globe girdling CloudTunnel networks.These only moved in the trivial sense of being whisked round the globe at a few hundred klicks an hour like everything else within a planetary band.To a Dweller that was stationary.Band Border Wheels really spun, transferring transport and materials from one band to another with minimal turbulence and in relative safety, with the added bonus that they produced prodigious amounts of electricity from their spindle drive shafts.These protruded from the upper and lower hubs, vast hemispheres whose lower rims were pocked with microwave dishes hundreds of metres across, geared up to tear round at blurring, mind numbing speeds and beaming their power to an outer collecting ring of equally enormous stationary dishes which then pumped the energy into docked bulk accumulator carriers.The Wheel and the city had been caught in the outer edges of a small boundary riding storm when theyd arrived, though both were being moved out of the way as quickly as they could be.Everything, from the planet itself to Fassins teeth, had seemed to vibrate around them as the turbulence hardened transfer ship hurried them empodded from the CloudTunnel station to the Wheel, engines labouring, wind screaming, ammonia hail pelting, lightning flashing and magnetic fields making various parts of Ysuls baggage and accoutrements buzz and fizz and spark.Hurled round in the giant centrifuge of the Wheel, stuck against its inner perimeter, the time that theyd spent inside had seemed almost calm by comparison, even allowing for the wild, wavelike bucking as theyd crossed the zone\belt border shear face itself.The storm had been affecting Guephuthe more severely than Nuersotse.The outer equatorial ring of the city was spinning hard, parts of its peripheral suburbs and less well maintained districts coming apart and peeling away in a welter of thrown out shrapnel.Their transfer had to buck and weave to dodge the wreckage, then take them straight to a TunnelCar marshalling yard beyond the city proper, a splay of cable filaments waving slowly in the gale like a vast anemone.Another multi kiloklick CloudTunnel journey through the vastness of Belt A, the Northern Tropical, another Wheel transfer  calmer this time  into Zone 2, and finally, crossing the mid line of the Zone, theyd started to encounter more military traffic than civilian, the cars and trains packed with people, supplies and materiel all heading for the war.At Tolimundarni, on the fringe of the war zone itself, theyd been thrown off the train by military police who werent falling for Ysuls pre emptively outrage fuelled arguments regarding the summit like priority and blatant extreme officiality of an expedition  nay, a quest!he was undertaking with these  yes, these, two  famous, well connected, honoured alien guests of immeasurably high intrinsic pan systemic cross species reputation, concerning a matter of the utmost import the exact details of which he was sadly not at liberty to divulge even to such patently important and obviously discreet members of the armed forces as themselves, but who would, nevertheless, he was sure, entirely understand the significance of their mission and thus their clear right to be accorded unhindered passage due to simple good taste and a fine appreciation of natural justice and would in no way be swayed by the fact that their cooperation would be repaid in levels of subsequent kudos almost beyond crediting  Theyd floated in the TunnelBud, watching the train of cars pulling out.Sholish had darted around the echoing space trying to round up all the floating and fallen pieces of just ejected luggage.Fassin and Hatherence had looked, glowering, at Ysul.Hed finished dusting himself down and straightening his clothing, then done a double take at their aggregated gaze and announced, defensively, I have a cousin!The cousin was an engineering officer on the Dreadnought Stormshear, a thirty turreter with the BeltRotationeers 487th Rolling Thunder Fleet.Bindiche, the cousin, bore a longstanding familial grudge against Ysul and so naturally had been only too happy to accept a great deal of kudos from an inwardly mortified, outwardly brave facing, hail cuz bygones now Ysul by doing him the enormous, surely never to be forgotten favour of vouching for him and his alien companions to his captain and so securing passage into the war zone, though even that only happened after a quick suborb flight in a nominally freight only moonshell pulsed from High Tolimundarni to Lopscotte (again covered by cousin Bindiche and his endlessly handy military connections, said vile spawn of a hated uncle amassing anguished Ysul donated kudos like the Stormshears mighty capacitors accumulated charge), scudding over the cloud tops, briefly in space (but no windows, not even any screen to see it), listening to Ysul complain about the uncannily hangover resembling after effects of the fierce acceleration in the magnetic pulse tube and the fact that hed had to leave behind most of his baggage, including all the war zone presents his friends had given him and the bulk of the new combat attire hed ordered.The slipstream howled and screamed around the Seer and the colonel.They watched the slave children attempt their repairs.Clustered around the ends of the giant propeller blades, Fassin thought the Dweller young looked like a group of especially dogged flies clinging to a ceiling mounted cooling fan.Dweller children had a generally feral and entirely unloved existence.It was very hard for humans not to feel that adult Dwellers were little better than serial, congenital abusers,  and that Dweller children ought to be rescued from the relative brutality of their existence.Even as Fassin watched, another infant was thrown from one of the giant blades, voice a high and anguished shriek.This latest unfortunate missed the prop guards but hit a high tension stay cable and was almost cut in half.A Dweller in a skiff dipped back into the slipstream, wrestling with his craft, to draw level with the tiny, broken body.He stripped it of its welding kit and let the body go.It disappeared into the mist, falling like a torn leaf.Dwellers cheerfully admitted that they didnt care for their children.They didnt particularly care for becoming female and getting pregnant, frankly, doing this only because it was expected, drew kudos and meant one had in some sense fulfilled a duty.The idea of having to do even more, of having to look after the brats afterwards as well was just laughable.They, after all, had had to endure being thrown out of the house and left to wander wild when they were young, theyd taken their chances with the organised hunts, the gangs of adolescents and lone hunter specialists, so why shouldnt the next generation?The little fuckers might live for billions of years.What was a mere century of weeding out?The slave children being used to carry out the repairs to the Stormshears damaged propeller would be regarded by most Dwellers as extremely lucky.They might be imprisoned and forced to carry out unpleasant and\or dangerous jobs but at least they were relatively safe, unhunted and properly fed.Fassin looked out at them, wondering how many would survive to become adults.Would any of these skinny, trembling delta shapes end up, billions of years from now, as utterly ancient, immensely respected Sages?The odd thing was, of course, that if you somehow knew for certain that they would, they wouldnt believe you.Dweller children absolutely, to an infant, refused to believe even for a moment, even as a working assumption, even just for the sake of argument, that they would ever, ever, ever grow up to become one of these huge, fierce, horrible double disc creatures who hunted them and killed them and captured them to do all the awful jobs on their big ships.Seer Taak?Yes, colonel?So they were back to close communicating, using polarised light to keep their conversation as private as possible.The colonel had suggested coming up here.Fassin had wondered if it was for some private chat.He supposed ordinary talk might have been problematic, given the screech of the slipstream around the gantry and the thunderous clamour sounding from the choir of engines just behind.I have meant to ask for some time.What?This thing we are supposed to be looking for.Without mentioning the specifics, even like this, using whisper signalling   Get on with it, colonel.Maam, he added.Do you believe what you told us, at that briefing on Third Fury?Hatherence asked.The one with just yourself, Ganscerel, Yurnvic and myself present: could all that you told us there possibly be true?The Long Crossing, the fabled hole between galaxies, the List itself.Does it matter?he asked.What we believe always matters.Fassin smiled.Let me ask you something.May I?On the condition that we return to my question, very well.Do you believe in the Truth?So capitalised?So in quotation marks.Well, of course!The Truth was the presumptuous name of the religion, the faith that lay behind the Shrievalty, the Cessoria, in a sense behind the Mercatoria itself.It arose from the belief that what appeared to be real life must in fact  according to some piously invoked statistical certitudes  be a simulation being run within some prodigious computational substrate in a greater and more encompassing reality beyond.This was a thought that had, in some form, crossed the minds of most people and all civilisations.(With the interesting exception of the Dwellers, or so they claimed.Which some parties held was another argument against them being a civilisation in the first place. )However, everybody  well, virtually everybody, obviously  quickly or eventually came round to the idea that a difference that made no difference wasnt a difference to be much bothered about, and one might as well get on with (what appeared to be) life.The Truth went a stage further, holding that this was a difference that could be made to make a difference.What was necessary was for people truly to believe in their hearts, in their souls, in their minds, that they really were in a vast simulation.They had to reflect upon this, to keep it at the forefront of their thoughts at all times and they had to gather together on occasion, with all due ceremony and solemnity, to express this belief.And they must evangelise, they must convert everybody they possibly could to this view, because  and this was the whole point  once a sufficient proportion of the people within the simulation came to acknowledge that it was a simulation, the value of the simulation to those who had set it up would disappear and the whole thing would collapse.If they were all part of some vast experiment, then the fact that those on whom the experiment was being conducted had guessed the truth would mean that its value would be lost.If they were some plaything, then again, that they had guessed this meant they ought to be acknowledged, even  perhaps  rewarded.If they were being tested in some way, then this was the test being passed, this was a positive result, again possibly deserving a reward.If they had been undergoing punishment for some transgression in the greater world, then this ought to constitute cause for rehabilitation.It was not possible to know what proportion of the simulated population would be required to bring things to a halt (it might be fifty per cent, it might be rather smaller or much greater), but as long as the numbers of the enlightened kept increasing, the universe would be constantly coming closer to this epiphany, and the revelation could come at any point.The Truth claimed with some degree of justification to be the ultimate religion, the final faith, the last of all churches.It was the one which encompassed all others, contextualised all others, could account for and embrace all others.They could all ultimately be dismissed as mere emergent phenomena of the simulation itself.The Truth could too, in a sense, but unlike them it still had more to say once this common denominator had been taken out of the equation.It could also claim a degree of universality that the others could not.All other major religions were either specific to their originating species, could be traced back to a single species  often a single subset of that species  or were consciously developed amalgams, syntheses, of a group of sufficiently similar religions of disparate origin.The Truth, claiming no miracles (or at least no miracles of proof) and being the work of no individual, all important prophet (it had arisen, naturally, many times within a multiplicity of different civilisations) was the first real post scientific, pan civil isational religion  or at least it was the first that had not been simply imposed on reluctant subjects by a conquering hegemony.The Truth could even claim to be not a religion at all, where such a claim might endear it to those not naturally religious by nature.It could be seen more as a philosophy, even as a scientific postulate backed up by unshakeably firm statistical likelihood.The Mercatoria had simply adopted this belief system, properly codified it and made it effectively the state religion of the latest Age.You do not believe, Fassin?The colonel put sadness into her signal.I appreciate the intellectual force of the argument.But it is not held in your mind at all times?No.Sorry.Be not sorry.We all find it difficult on occasion.We shall,  perhaps, talk further on the matter.I was afraid we might.To return to my question, then.Do I believe all that stuff?Correct.Fassin looked around at the ship beneath them and the great assemblage of roaring engines, whirling blades and supporting structures.The Long Crossing: thirty million years between galaxies.The idea that anything built by Dwellers could make a journey of that length does place the credulity under a degree of tension, he admitted.The assertion that the outward journey was made so much more rapidly seems no less to belong to the realm of fantasy.Ah yes, the great and almost certainly mythical intergalactic hole.I would not argue with you, colonel.Though I would say its perfectly possible that these are all nonsense, but the specific object were looking for still exists.It keeps unlikely company.Again, I wouldnt choose to dispute the matter.We are left with the fact that you are a colonel, I am some sort of honorary major and orders are orders.How assiduously one attempts to follow ones orders might be affected by the extent to which one believes they are capable of being carried out successfully.There I would completely agree with you.What are you getting at?Just calibrating, major.Seeing how committed I am?Would I sacrifice my life for our object of desire?Something like that.I suspect were both sceptics, colonel.Me more than you, I suppose.We also believe in doing our duty.You more than me, perhaps.Satisfied?Content.Me too.I received a communication from the Ocula this morning.Really?And were you always going to tell me, or could I have been even more mission sceptical during that last exchange, and been told nothing?Or has your calibration meant Im not going to get told everything now?Yes.Our orders remain as they were.There were several more attacks on the system in general at the time of the assault on the Third Fury moon.Further, less intense attacks have continued.The communications satellite system around Nasqueron is being repaired as a matter of urgency.In the meantime a Navarchy fleet is being stationed above the planet, to take the place of the satellites, to provide security and main force back up for you and me, and to pick us up at the end of our mission, or in an emergency.Fassin took a moment to think.Any word from my Sept, Sept Bantrabal?None.There was confirmation that all those on or in Third Fury were killed.I am sorry to report that Master Technician Hervil Apsile is also believed to be dead.There has been no sign of or communication with the drop ship.I have been asked by the Ocula to pass on their commiserations to you regarding all those deceased Seers and supporting staff, to which of course I add my own.Thank you.The colonel might have executed a sort of rolling bow, or it might just have been the effects of the swirling, buffeting slipstream tearing around them.The slave children had suffered no further casualties.Their repairs appeared to be working.Even where they had not completed their renovations, the damaged blades were vibrating less, making the rest of the job easier.How many ships were they sending to Nasqueron, to do all these things?That one small ship and two puck sized satel lites could do?This was not mentioned.Fassin said nothing.There were some potentially unfortunate consequences implicit in a profound belief in the Truth.One was that there was a possibility that when the simulation ended, all the people being simulated would cease to exist entirely.The sim might be turned off and everybody within the substrate running it would die.There might be no promotion, no release, no return to a bigger and better and finer outside: there might just be the ultimate mass extinction.Also, back in the (apparently) real world, there was an argument that the Truth implied approval of its own extinctions, that it tacitly encouraged mass murder and genocide.Logically, if one way of upping the proportion of those who truly believed was to evangelise, convince and convert, another was to decrease the numbers of those who steadfastly refused to accept the Truth at all  if necessary by killing them.The tipping point into revelation and deliverance for all might come not at the moment when a sceptic became a believer but at the point that an un reformable heathen breathed their last.The Stormshear plunged into a great dark wall of thicker cloud, dimming the view.Lights started to come on, shining from the supporting structure and the Dweller skiffs.Soon they could see little, and the mad, overwhelming cacophony of the slipstream and the droning engines made sonosense near impossible.A methane hail rattled around them in the gathering gloom.Time to go in, perhaps, the colonel said.Amen.* * *  The next day brought target practice, as the Stormshears weapons and crew were brought up to some form of war readiness.Ysul, Hatherence and Fassin were allowed to watch from inside an observation dome right at the front of the ship, a temporary structure protruding from the Dreadnoughts armoured nose like a little bubble of diamond.They shared the place with a few dozen interested civilians, mostly administrators of the various cities where the Stormshear had been paying courtesy calls during the last long period of peace.Uniformed pet children floated amongst the VIPs, carrying trays of food and drugs.Ahead, through a ten kilometre gap in the clouds, they could see an object like a small bright blue ship, a target being towed by another Dreadnought a hundred or more klicks still further ahead.The Stormshear shuddered mightily and an instant later there came a great blast of noise.Tracks like dozens of vapour trails appeared in the sky beneath and above them, great combs of thin, plaited gas racing in front of them headed by the barely glimpsed dark dots of the shells converging on the target.Screens set into each dent seat  where working  showed a magnified view of the blue target; it shook as its hollow structure was punctured by the shells, holes appearing briefly on its hull before sealing up again.A desultory cheer went up from a few of the generally bored looking Dwellers present.It was drowned out by the clicking of maniple fingers demanding service from the pet children waiters.I never asked, Hatherence said, leaning close to Ysul as he snorted up the coils of purple from a fuming stoke pipe.What is the war actually about?Ysul turned jerkily and gave the impression of trying to get his outer sensory regions to focus on the colonel.About?he said, looking confused.The exhausted stoke stick attached to the pipe went out with a loud pop.Well, its about when two, ah, opposing groups of, ah people, ah, that is to say, Dwellers, in this case, obviously, decide to, umm, fight.Fight!Yes, usually over some issue, and and they use weapons of war to do so, until one side or other  did I say there are usually just two sides?Thats kind of the conventional number, I believe.Sort of a quorum, you might say.Though  I wasnt looking for the definition of a war, Ysul.No?Good.I thought you probably had such things of your own.Most people seem to.I meant, what is the point at issue?What is the cause of the war?The cause?Ysul asked, looking surprised.He roted as far back in his dent seat as he could while the ship shuddered again and another salvo, from each side of the vessel this time, lanced forwards to the distant target.Well, he said, distracted by the dancing dots of the shells dragging their gas trails after them.Well, Im sure there is one He started mumbling.Hatherence seemed to realise shed already got as much sense out of Ysul as she was going to while he was sucking on the stoke pipe, and settled back in her seat with a sigh.Dweller Formal Wars are like duels fought on a huge scale, Fassin told her.The colonel turned fractionally towards him.Normally about some aesthetic dispute.Theyre often the final stage of a planet planning dispute.Planet planning?A common one is where theres some dispute concerning the number of belts and zones a planet ought to have.Then, the Odds and the Evens are the two sides, usually.Planet planning?the colonel repeated, as though she hadnt picked up right the first time.I did not think gas giants were, well, planned.The Dwellers claim they can alter the number of bands a planet has, over a sufficiently great amount of time.Theyve never been reliably observed doing this but that doesnt stop them claiming to be able to do it.Anyway, its not the doing of the thing that matters, its the principle.What sort of world do we want to live in?Thats the question.Even or Odd?Exactly.A Formal War is just the working out.Another salvo.The ship really shook this time, and a number of the slave children yelped at the ragged boom resulting.Combs of gas trails leapt from all sides, a cone defining a tunnel of braided sky in front of them.Wars are also fought over disagreements such as which GasClipper ought to be allowed to fly a certain pennant colour during a race.A war for this?Hatherence sounded genuinely horrified.Have these people never heard of committees?Oh, they have committees and meetings and dispute proce dures.They have lots of those.But getting Dwellers to stick with a decision thats gone against them, even after theyve sworn on their life beforehand that theyll abide by it, is not the easiest thing to do, in this or any other world.So disagree ments tend to rumble on.Formal Wars are just the Dweller equivalent of a Supreme Court, a tribunal of last resort.Also, you have to understand that they dont really have standing armed forces as such.Between wars, the Dreadnoughts and other military bits and pieces are cared for by enthusiasts, by clubs.Even when a Formal War is declared, all that happens is that the clubs get bigger as ordinary people sign up.The clubs sound and feel like what you or I might understand as proper military authorities but theyve no legal standing.The colonel shook as though just confronted with something of ultimate grisliness.How perverse.For them, it seems to work.The verb work, Hatherence sent,  like so many other common terms, seems to be required to take on additional mean ings when one talks of Dwellers.How do they decide whos won one of these bizarre conflicts?Occasionally a straight dead count, or the number of Dreadnoughts destroyed or crippled.More usually therell be an elegance threshold pre agreed.An elegance threshold?Hatherence, Fassin said, turning to her,  did you do any research into Dweller life?All that time in     I believe I encountered a mention of this concept but dismissed it at the time as fanciful.It genuinely counts in such matters?It genuinely counts.And they cant agree a workable disputes procedure for what ship flies which colourings without resorting to war, but they can happily agree on that resulting war being decided on a concept as fuzzy as elegance?Oh, thats never disputed.They have an algorithm for it.Another terrific judder rang the Stormshear like a dull bell.The thin, uncoiling tracks combed the sky ahead of them.An algorithm?the colonel said.Elegance is an algorithm.The screens showed the blue target quaking under the impact of a handful of shells.Hatherence glanced at Ysul, who was trying to blow purple smoke rings and pierce them with a rim arm.And its all run by clubs, she said.Of enthusiasts.Yes.Clubs?Big clubs, Hatherence.So is all this why their war technology is so awful?She asked.Is it?Fassin, Hatherence said, sounding amused now.These people claim to have been around since the week after reionisation and building these Dreadnought things for most of that time, yet that target is less than a dozen klicks ahead, each salvo is thirty six shells   Thirty three.One of the turrets is out of action.Regardless.They are only hitting that effectively unmoving target with every second or third round.That is simply pathetic.There are rules, formulae.Insisting on ludicrously inefficient gunnery?In a sense.No guided shells, all guns and aiming systems to be based on ancient patterns, no jet engines for the Dreadnoughts, no rocket engines for the missiles, no particle or beam weapons at all.Like duels fought with ancient pistols.Youre getting the idea.And this is meant to keep them all in martial trim in case they are invaded by outside hostiles?Well, yes, Fassin agreed.That does begin to look like a slightly hollow claim when you actually see the technology, doesnt it?Of course, they claim theyve got star busting hyper weapons hidden about the place somewhere, just in case, and the skills are somehow transferable, but   Nobodys ever seen them.Something like that.The Stormshear unleashed its mighty anti ship missiles, loosing what was probably meant to be a twelve strong broadside.The eleven tiny, slim projectiles came screaming from all sides of the great vessel  the slave children yelped again and some dropped their trays  and hurtled out towards the distant blue target drone on smoky, twisting plumes of jet exhaust like deranged darts.Two of the missiles drifted too close to one another; each appeared to identify the other as its intended target and so both swung wildly at their opposite number, missed, twisted round in a sweeping double braid, flew straight at each other and this time met and exploded in a modest double fireball.Some Dwellers in the observation lounge  distracted, perhaps sarcastic  cheered.A third missile seemed to take the nearby explosion as a sign that it ought to perform an upward loop and head straight back at the Stormshear.Oh oh, Ysul said.The oncoming missile settled into a flat, steady course, becoming a small but rapidly enlarging dot, aimed straight at the nose of the Dreadnought.They do have destructs, dont they?Hatherence said, glancing at Fassin.Some Dwellers started looking at each other, then made a dash for the access tube to the Stormshears armoured nose, creating a jam around the door.Slave children, also trying to escape, either got through ahead of the rush or were thrown roughly out of the way, yelping.The dot in the sky was getting bigger.They can just order it to blow up, cant they?the colonel said, roting backwards.A high, whining noise seemed to be coming from somewhere inside the colonels esuit.The yelling, cursing knot of Dwellers round the exit didnt seem to be shifting.The Stormshear was starting to turn, hopelessly slowly.In theory they can destruct it, Fassin said uneasily, watching the still unshifting melee around the exit.And they do have close range intercept guns.Another frantic slave child was ejected upwards from the scrum by the door, screaming until it slapped into the ceiling and dropped lifeless to the slowly tilting deck.The missile had real shape now, no longer a large dot.Stubby wings and a tailplane were visible.The Stormshear continued to turn with excruciating slowness.The missile plunged in towards them on a trail of sooty exhaust.Hatherence rose from her dent seat but moved closer to the diamond sheath nose of the observation blister, not further away.Stay back, major, she sent.Then a terrific tearing, ripping noise sounded from above and behind them, a net of finger fine trails filled the gas ahead of the ships nose and the missile first started to disintegrate and then blew up.The interceptor machine gun somewhere behind continued firing, scoring multiple hits on the larger pieces of smoking, glowing missile wreckage as they tumbled on towards the Stormshear, so that when the resulting shrapnel hit and punctured the observation blister it caused relatively little damage, and only minor wounds.The Dreadnought took them as far as Munueyn, a Ruined City fallen amongst the dark, thick gases of the lower atmosphere where slow coils of turbulence roiled past like the heavy, lascivious licks of an almighty planetary tongue, a place all spires and spindles, near deserted, long unfashionable, a one time Storm Centre now too far from anything to be of much interest to anybody, a place that might have garnered kudos for itself had it been near a war zone, but could hope for almost none at all because it was within one.A wing frigate took them from the Dreadnought and deposited them in the gigantic echoing hall of what had once been the citys bustling StationPort, where they were greeted like returning heroes, like gods, by the local hirers and fliers.They found a guest house for negative kudos.They were, in effect, being paid to stay there.Sir!Sholish said, rising from the mass of petitioners in the small courtyard below.A hostelier of impeccable repute with excellent familial connections in the matter of wartime travel warrants beseeches you to consider his proposal to put at your disposal a veritable fleet of a half half dozen finely arrayed craft, all in the very best of condition and working order and ready to depart within less than an hour of their arrival.Which will be when, precisely, banelet of my already too long life?A day, sire.Two, at the most.He assures.Unacceptable!Utterly and profoundly so!Ysul proclaimed, frilling the very idea away with a shudder.He was nestled within a dent on a flower decked terrace outside and above the Taverna Bucolica, close enough to the citys central plaza to smell the mayors desperation.He dragged deep of a proffered pharma cylinder and with the exhalation breathed, Next!Fassin and the colonel, floating nearby, exchanged looks.Hatherence floated closer.We could just take off, you and I.    All by ourselves?We are both self sufficient, we are both capable of making good time.You reckon?The colonel made it obvious that she was looking his arrow craft over.I think so.I think you called up the specs on this thing before we left Third Fury and know damn well so, he thought.He sent,  So we go haring off into the clouds together, just we two.Yes.There is a problem.Indeed.In fact, there are two problems.The first one is that theres a war on, and well look like a pair of warheads.Warheads?But we shant even be transonic!There are rules in Formal War regarding the speed that warheads can travel at.Well look like warheads.Hmm.If we went a little slower?Slow warheads.Slower still?Cruise mines.And before you ask, any slower than that and well look like ordinary monolayer float mines.Hatherence bobbed up and down, a sigh.You mentioned a second problem.Without Ysul its unlikely that anybody will talk to us.With him it is unlikely that anybody else will get a word in.Nevertheless.They needed their own transport.More to the point, they needed transport that would be allowed to pass unchallenged in the war zone.Whatever remained of Valseirs old dwelling lay far enough off the CloudTunnel network to make roting or floating their way there too long winded.Ysul had agreed to fix things  with his equatorial, big city connections, escorting exotic aliens, he was bound to positively exude kudos towards all those who might help him  but then had got caught up in the whole process just due to the numbers of people who wanted to be the ones who helped him, and so became unable, seemingly, to make up his mind.Just as it seemed likely he was about to settle on one outrageously generous offer, another would appear over the horizon, even more enticing, necessitating a further reappraisal.Finally, after two days, Hatherence could take no more and hired her own ship, on terms slightly better than the ones just rejected by Ysul.In their suite at the Taverna, Ysul protested.Iam doing the negotiating!he bellowed.Yes, the colonel agreed.Rather too much of it.A compromise was arrived at.The colonel confessed to their hirer that she was legally unable to commit to a firm contract and Ysul then remade it on the exact same terms while the appalled shipmaster was still drawing breath to protest.That day, the day the war officially got under way, ceremonially beginning with an opening gala and Formal Duel in Pihirumime, half the world away.A day later they sailed  taking the next downward eddy that also swirled in the right horizontal direction  aboard the Poaflias, a hundred metre twin hull screw burster of unknown but probably enormous age.It boasted a crew of just five apart from its captain and was rotund and slow, but was  for some reason lost in the mists of Dweller military logic  still registered as an uncommitted privateer scout ship and so cleared to make her way within the war zone and, one might hope, liable to pass any consequent challenge save one conducted by opening fire prior to negotiations.Their captain was Slyne, an enthusiastic youngster barely arrived at Adulthood, still very much a Recent and behaving more like a Youth.Hed inherited the Poaflias on the death of his father.The Dwellers clove to the idea of Collective Inheritance, so that, when one of them died, any private property they could fairly claim to have accumulated went fifty per cent to whoever they wanted it to go to and fifty per cent to whatever jurisdiction they lived within.This was why only one hull of the twin hulled Poaflias was fully owned by Slyne.The city of Munueyn owned the other half and was renting it to him, accumulating kudos.The less Slyne could actually do with the ship, the more control he would lose, until ultimately the city could reasonably claim it was all theirs; then, if he wanted to stay aboard, hed more or less have to do whatever the city asked him to do with the ship.This expedition, however, conducted under his own auspices, ought to go a long way towards securing his ownership rights over the whole vessel.This is why we are confined to the single hull?Hatherence asked the captain.They were on the foredeck, a slightly ramshackle sprouting of fibres and sheet protruding over the crafts battered looking nose.Ysul had spotted a harpoon gun on the foredeck and challenged his companions to a coarse shoot the next time they traversed a promising volume.Apparently where they were now, just two days out of Munueyn, constituted just such a happy hunting ground  however, nobody had seen anything worth harpooning so far.Thats right!Slyne bobbed eagerly over the deck.Less I use the other hull, less I owe the city!Captain Slyne was hanging on to some rigging, floating above everybody else to get a good view and act as lookout and target spotter.They were making a decent speed through the dim crimson gases.The slipstream would have blown Slyne aft if he hadnt been holding on.A decent speed in this case meant less than a quarter of the velocity of the Dreadnought Stormshear on cruise, but the gas down here was thicker and the slipstreams force was all the greater.Theres something!Slyne yelled, pointing up and to starboard.They all looked.No!Wrong, Slyne said cheerfully.Beg pardon.Slyne was taking his captains role seriously, accoutred with lots of mostly useless ancient naval paraphernalia like spyglasses, an altimeter, a museum piece radio, a scratched looking hail visor, a shining antique holster cannon and a radiation compass.His clothing and half armour looked very new but based on designs that were very old.He had a couple of pet foetuses tethered to each of his Hub girdles.The foetuses were Dweller young who hadnt even been allowed to progress to the stage of being children.The usual reason they existed was because a Dweller turned female of particular impatience had decided she couldnt be bothered going to full term, and had aborted.The results made good pets.Dwellers could survive on their own almost from conception, they just didnt progress intellectually and had nobody to protect them while they were completely helpless.Slynes quadruplets  it would have been impolite to inquire whether they were actually his own  looked like little bloated manta rays, pale and trailing almost useless tentacles, forever bumping into their master or each other and getting themselves tangled in their tethers.The effect, for a human, was inevitably slightly grisly, though Fassin had the added, depressing feeling that the foetuses were the equivalent of a parrot in ancient Earth terms.Theres something this time!Slyne shouted, pointing down to starboard.A small, black object was rising from the deep red depths of gas a couple of hundred metres away.Ihave it!Ysul yelled, bump kicking the gun platform on its counterweights.It swung up above the deck to an elevation that let him depress the harpoon gun sufficiently.A tchoufer seed!Sholish exclaimed.Its a tchoufer tree seed, sir!Wait a moment, Ysul, Fassin said, rising from the deck.Just let me go and check.He gunned the little gascraft away from the Poaflias, curving out and down towards the still slowly rising black sphere.Keep out of the way!Ysul bellowed to the human.Fassin had taken a curved course deliberately, having witnessed Ysuls marksmanship before.Just hold, will you?he shouted back.Ysul gave a shake and sighted the gun on the black sphere, maniples grasping the trigger.Slyne craned forward in the rigging.Two of the foetuses wrapped themselves round a stay, entangling him.He looked up, tutted, and brought his spyglass up to a receptor dense portion of his sensory frill, scanning the rising black orb.Ah, actually he began.Hatherence bobbed up suddenly.Ysul!Stop!Ha ha!Ysul said, twisting the trigger and firing the harpoon.The mounting shook, the gun leapt and banged, the harpoons own twin rocket motors sprang out and erupted as soon as it was a safe distance away and the thin black line attached to the main body came whipping and whistling out of a locker just beneath the gun mounting.The harpoon rasped through the gas towards where the black object would be in a few seconds time.Hmm, Ysul said, sounding slightly surprised.One of my better  Its a mine!Slyne screamed.Sholish just screamed.Fassin, get away from that thing!Hatherence sent.The little gascraft instantly started to turn and speed up, rotors blurring in the air.Eh?What?Ysul said.Slyne drew his holster cannon and aimed at the harpoon.He got one shot off before the gun jammed.Could that be nuclear?the colonel shouted.A high, keening noise sounded from the colonels esuit.Definitely!Slyne spluttered.He shook his gun and cursed, then slapped at his radio.Engines!Full astern!He shook the gun again, desperately.Fucking scrits!Hatherence moved quickly to one side.Ysul looked out at the harpoon, dropping smoothly right on course for the black ball, then at the gun mounting.Sholish!he barked.Grab that line!Sholish leapt for the thrumming dark curtain of cord being jerked from the locker under the gun, caught hold of it and was instantly whipped towards the gunwales, smashing through stanchions and snapping to a stop, tangled in the hawser, before the slipstream brought him thudding back into the deck behind them.Free of the encumbering line, the harpoon just picked up speed, still heading for the mine.Hatherence got clear of the Poaflias.Fassins arrowcraft was still turning, still picking up speed, still even closer to the mine than the ship was.Oh, fu Ysul said.A crimson flash seemed to wash out the gas all around them.Dead, Fassin had time to think.For an instant, a tight fan of searing pink white lines joined Colonel Hatherences esuit and the full length of the harpoon, which vanished in a blast of heat and light.A visible shock sphere pulsed out from the detonation, rocking the mine   Which seemed to stop and think for a moment, before continuing to ascend smoothly on its way.The shock wave shook them and the ship.Fassin felt it too.He slowed and turned back.The Poaflias was scrubbing off speed following Slynes last order.The slipstream was lessening but still sufficiently strong to clunk Sholishs battered carapace off the deck as he floated tangled in the dark mass of wire.Ysul looked.Sholish?he said in a small voice.The species of the Faring are more divided by their sense of time than anything else.We Dwellers, being who and what we are, naturally encompass as much of the spectrum of chronosense as we are able, covering most of it.I exclude the machine Quick.A hesitation.You still abhor those, I take it?Yes, we most certainly do!the colonel exclaimed.Positively persecuted, Fassin said.Hmm.They are different again, of course.But even within the limits of the naturally evolved, the manifold rates at which time is appreciated are, some would argue, collectively the single most telling distinction that might be made between species and species types.The speaker was an ancient Sage called Jundriance.Dweller seniority nomenclature stretched to twenty nine separate categories, starting with child and ending, no less than two billion years later (usually much more) at Child.In between came the short lived Adolescent and Youth stages, the rather longer Adult stage with its three sub divisions, then Prime, with four subdivisions, Cuspian with three and then, if the Dweller had survived to that age (one and a quarter million years, minimum) and was judged fit by his peers, Sagehood, which then repeated all the subdivisions of the Adulthood, Prime and Cuspian stages.So, technically, Jundriance was a Sage prime chice.He was forty three million years old, had shrunk to only six metres in diameter  while his carapace had darkened and taken on the hazy patina of Dweller middle age  had already lost most of his limbs and he was in charge of what was left of the house and associated libraries of the presumed deceased Cuspian choal Valseir.The view from the house was motionless and unchanging at normal time, a hazy vista of deep brown and purple veils of gas within a great placid vertical cylinder of darkness that was the final echo of the great storm that the house had once swung about like a tiny planet around a great, cold sun.In appearance the house library complex itself was a collection of thirty two spheres, each seventy metres or so in diameter, many girdled by equatorial balconies, so that the construction looked like some improbably bunched gathering of ringed planets.The bubble house hung, very slowly sinking, in that great calm of thick gas, deep down in the dark, hot depths only a few tens of kilometres above the region where the atmosphere began to behave more like a liquid than a gas.This is his house, then, yes?the colonel had asked when theyd first seen it from the foredeck of the Poaflias.Fassin had looked around, using sonosense and magnetic to search for the section of the derelict CloudTunnel that the house had once been anchored to, but couldnt find it anywhere nearby.Hed already checked the Poafliass charts.The stretch of CloudTunnel no longer showed up on the local holo maps, implying that it had either drifted much further away  which was unlikely  or had fallen into the depths.Yes, he said.Yes, looks like it.Theyd had to turn the Poaflias around and return to Munueyn.Sholish, badly injured, had been taken to hospital.The surgeons had given him an even chance of surviving.Hed heal best left in a drug coma for the next few hundred days.There was nothing more they could do.Ysul could have taken on any number of Youths and Adolescents eager to take his crippled servants place, but hed turned them all down  a decision hed regretted just a day or so later once theyd set out again, when hed realised he had nobody to shout at.Theyd avoided challenges, other ships and mines of all sorts, finally making the journey in ten days.The Sage Jundriance was attended by a couple of burly Prime servants, Nuern and Livilido, each dressed in fussily ornate and ill fitting academic robes.They were sufficiently senior to have servants of their own; a half dozen highly reticent Adults who looked like identical sextuplets.They were big on scurrying but almost autistically shy.The senior of the two elder servants, Nuern  a mouean to Livilidos one rank more junior suhrl  had welcomed them, allocated rooms and informed them that his master was engaged in the task of cataloguing the remaining works in the libraries  as Ysul had warned, a significant proportion of the contents had been given away since Valseirs accident.Probably only the remoteness of the house had prevented more scholars showing up to pick over the remains.Jundriance was, however, in slow time, so if they wanted to speak to him they would have to slow to his thought pace.Fassin and the colonel had agreed.Ysul had announced he was having none of this and took the Poaflias on a cruise to explore the local volume and see what there might be to hunt.Your duty should be to wait for us, the colonel had informed him.Duty?Ysul had said, as though hearing the word for the first time.They had a half day or so, at least, while Jundriance was informed by a message on his read screen that he had visitors.If he would see them immediately, they could go in before dark.Otherwise it could be some long time  Colonel, Fassin had said, we will have to go into slowdown for some time.Ysul might be as well amusing himself nearby   Fassin had turned to look at Ysul to emphasise the word   as mooching about this place for who knows how long.Hell get into trouble.Probably.So, better trouble close to home, or trouble further away?Hatherence had made a rumbling noise and had told Ysul, There is a war on.Ive checked the nets!Ysul had protested.Its kilo klicks away!Really?Nuern had said, perking.Has it started?The master doesnt allow connections in the house.We hear nothing.Began a dozen days ago, Ysul had told the servant.Weve been in the thick of it already.Barely avoided a smart mine on the way here.My servant got himself injured, may die.A smart mine?Near here?You are right to be concerned, my friend, Ysul had said solemnly.The presence of such ordnance hereabouts is another  the real  reason why Ill take my ship on patrol around you.And your servant, injured.How terrible.I know.War is.Other than that, elsewhere in the hostilities, barely a spineful of deaths so far.Couple of Dreadnoughts crippled on each side.Far too early to tell whos winning.Ill keep a fringe cocked, let you know whats happening.Thank you.Not at all.Youre right, Hatherence had signal whispered to Fassin as this exchange was taking place.Lets just let him go.You can signal the ship from your esuit while still in slowdown?Yes.Okay.You will stay nearby?Fassin had asked Ysul.You wont let the Poaflias venture too far out?Of course!I swear!And I shall ask our two fine fellows here to extend you every courtesy on my behalf!They were to be seen at once.Nuern had shown them into one of the outer library pods.The library had a roof of diamond leaf looking directly upwards into the vermilion dark sky.Jundriance was settled into a dent desk near the centre of the near spherical room, facing a read screen.Around him, the walls were lined with shelves, some so widely spaced that they might have doubled as bunk space for humans, others so small that a childs finger might have struggled to fit.Mostly these held books, of some sort.Spindle secured carousels tensioned between the walls and between the floor and a network of struts above held hundreds of other types of storage devices and systems: swave crystals, holoshard, picospool and a dozen more obscure.Theyd joined Jundriance at his desk, floating through the thick atmosphere to his side.Nuern had swung dent seats into place and theyd both clamped onto one, Hatherence positioning herself with Fassin between her and the Sage.Jundriance, of course, gave no sign of having noticed them.Theyd slowed.It had been much easier for Fassin than for Hatherence.Hed been doing this for centuries; shed been trained in the technique but had never attempted it for real.The experience would be a jerky, shaky journey for her, at least until they smoothed out at the Sages pace.The day darkened quickly, then the night seemed to last less than an hour.Fassin concentrated on his own smooth slowdown, but was aware of the colonel seeming to wriggle and shift in her dent seat.The Sage Jundriance appeared to stir.By the next quick morning, something actually changed on his reading screen; another page.That day passed quickly, then the next night went quicker still.The process continued until they were down to a factor of about one in sixty four, which was what they had been told Jundriance had come up to meet them at  hed been even slower until their arrival.They were about halfway there when a signal whisper had pinged into the little gascraft.You receiving this all right, major?Yes.Why?I just interrogated the screen reader.It was working in realtime until the Poaflias arrived.You sure?Perfectly.Interesting.Finally they were there, synchronised to the same life pace as the Sage.The short days became a slow, slow flicker above them, the orange purple sky beyond the diamond leaf alternately lightening and dimming.Even at this pace, the great tall veils of gas seemed to hang above them in the sky, unmoving.Fassin had experienced the feeling he always got when he first went into slowdown during a delve, the disquieting sensation that he was a lost soul, the feeling of being in a strange sort of prison, trapped in time inside while life went on at a quicker pace outside, above, beyond.Jundriance had turned off his read screen and greeted them.Fassin had asked about Valseir but somehow theyd got onto the subject of life pace itself.One feels sorry for the Quick, I suppose, the Sage said.They seem ill suited to the universe, in a way.The distances between the stars, the time it takes to travel from one to another Even more so, of course, if one is thinking of travelling between galaxies.A hole in the conversation.Of course.Fassin said, to fill it.Are you fishing for something, old one?he thought.The machines.They were much worse, of course.How unbearable, to live so quickly.Well, they mostly dont live at all now, Sage, Fassin told him.That is as well, perhaps.Sage, can you tell us any more about Valseirs death?I was not there.I know no more than you.You were quite close to him?Fassin asked.Close?No.No, I would not say so.We had corresponded on matters of textual verification and provenance, and debated at a remove on various questions of scholarship and interpretation, though not regularly.We never met.I would not say that that constituted closeness, would you?I suppose not.I just wondered what drew you here, thats all.Oh, the chance to look through his library.To take what I might for myself.That is what drew me.His servants took some material before they left, others  mostly scholars or those who chose to call themselves such  came and took what they wanted, but there is still much here, and while the most obvious treasures are gone, much of value may remain.It would be derelict to ignore.I see.And what of Valseirs libraries?I understand you are continuing to catalogue them?A pause.Continuing.Yes.The old, dark carapaced Sage seemed to stare at the dark read screen.Hmm, he said.He turned fractionally to look at Fassin.Let me see.Your use of the word continuing there.I understood that Valseir had been cataloguing his libraries Wasnt he?He was always so secretive.Was he not?Im getting light comms leakage here, Hatherence sent.Tell me if theres a burst after this:  And dilatory.Hapuerele always said that Valseir was more likely to win the All Storms Yachting Cup than ever finish cataloguing his libraries.Another pause.Quite so, quite so.Hapuerele, yes.Leakage.Hapuerele does not exist?Exists, but he had to ask elsewhere just there.Shouldnt have.I would like to take a look round some of the libraries myself.I hope you dont mind.I shant disturb you.Ah.I see.Well, if you think you can be discreet.Are you seeking anything in particular, Mr Taak?Yes.And you?Only enlightenment.And what would it be that you are looking for, if I may ask?Exactly the same.The old dweller was silent for a while.In real time, most of an hour passed.I may have something for you, he said eventually.Would you care to slow down a little more?No doubt this, our present pace, seems surpassing slow to you; however, I find it something of a strain.Of course, Fassin told Jundriance.Ill have to leave you here, major.Lucky you.Ill try to keep this short.Good luck, Hatherence sent.However, I shall leave you at this point, sir, the colonel said to the Sage.Pleasant to have met you, Reverend Colonel, Jundriance told her.Now then, he said to Fassin.Let me see.Half this pace, I think, Seer Taak, would suit me better.A quarter would suit me better still.Shall we try half, then, initially?He was back in just three days.Hatherence was inspecting the contents of another library when he found her.The room was almost perfectly spherical, with no windows, just a circle of dim light shining from the ceilings centre and further luminescence provided by bio strips inlaid on each shelf, glowing ghostly green.Further stacks of shelves like enormous inward pointing vanes made the place feel oddly organic, as though these were ribs, and they were inside some vast creature.The colonel was floating near one set of close stacked shelves near the librarys centre, strips of green light ribbing her esuit.So soon, major?Hatherence said, replacing a slim holocrystal on a shelf half full of them.At the same time as she spoke, she sent:  Our friend had nothing of interest?Sage Jundriance gave me so much to think about that I decided Id better come back to normal speed to think it over, Fassin replied, then signalled,  The old bastard gave me fuck all; basically hes trying to stall us.Well, I have been studying while you were conversing.Anything of interest?he asked, floating over towards her.There are signs that many more Dwellers were staying here until not long ago.Perhaps only a few days long ago.The house system seems to think there ought to be a catalogue of cata logues somewhere.In fact that there ought to be multiple copies of it lying around.A catalogue of catalogues?Fassin said.Other Dwellers?The first catalogue that Valseir compiled, listing the catalogues of individual works he would then draw up.Perhaps as many as ten or twelve.Also, I get the impression Livilido and Nuern are more, or at least other, than they appear.One catalogue for everything would be too simple?Fassin asked, then sent,  I didnt think they seemed like ordinary servants either.So where are all these multiple copies?I suspect they have been removed.They would be the key to beginning a methodical search, the colonel replied, then said, I gather it seemed to him the logical way to proceed.Certainly there is no shortage of material, even yet, when much of it has been removed.One catalogue would, I suppose, be cumbersome.The Colonel paused.Of course, a single giant database with freely dimensioned subdivisions, partially overlapping categories and subcategories, a hierarchically scalable cross reference hyperstructure and inbuilt, semi smart user learning routines would be even more to the point and far more useful.Fassin looked at her.Hed probably have got round to one of those after hed done what he considered the proper cataloguing  getting everything down in some non volatile form that can be read without intervening machinery.Our Dweller friends do seem to be remarkably purist about such things.When you live as long as they do, future proofing becomes an obsession.Perhaps that is their curse.The Quick must endure the frustration of living in a universe with what seems like an annoyingly slow speed limit and the Slow must suffer the frenetic pace of change around them, resulting in a sort of exaggerated entropy.Fassin had been floating slowly closer to Hatherence.He tipped to make it clear that he was looking at her as he came to a stop a couple of metres from her.The glowing biostrips on the shelves painted soft lime stripes across the little gascraft.You all right in there, colonel?he asked.I realise its very hot and pressured down here.Colonel, do you think we are wasting our time here?I am fine.Yourself?Very hard to say.There is so much still here, so much to be looked at.Also fine.Feeling very rested.Thats my point.We could be made to waste a lot of time here, looking for something that has already been removed.I understand slow time will have that effect.That is a thought.I had the odd impression, from dust marks and so on, understand, that many of the shelves have recently been filled, or refilled.And many of the works seem to make no sense given what Ive understood of Valseirs subjects of study.Seemed most strange.Though, if all this is a sort of slow trap for you and me, then that begins to make sense.But what else can we do?Where else is there to go?Ill have to talk to the Sage again, Fassin said.There are many things Id like to ask him.Whereas in fact Ill do everything I can to avoid talking to the old bore again.We have to get word out to any legitimate scholars who did take works from here, see if any of them have the catalogues, or anything else.There are two dozen separate libraries here; even if theyre only half full we could be searching them for decades.He is a most interesting and wise character.Many tens of millions of works, and if most are unsorted, all are.Ill signal to the Poaflias, have them put out word to the relevant scholars.Who might be trying to put obstacles in our way so?Indeed he is.I dont know.Well, I think I shall continue to search the shelves for a while.Will you join me?Will you?Why not?They drifted to different but nearby stacks, snicked holocrystal books out of their motion proof shelves, and read.His study?Nuern asked.A fringe flick indicated a glance at Livilido.They were afloat at table.The two Primes had invited Fassin and Hatherence to a semi formal dinner in the houses ovaloid dining room, a great, dim, echoing space strung vertically with enormous sets of carbon ropes, all splayed, separated into smaller and smaller cords and fibres and threads and filaments and then each thin strand minutely and multiply knotted.It was like being inside some colossal, frayed net.Jundriance was still deep in slow time and would not be joining them.Special food had been prepared that was suitable for the colonel.She ingested it via a sort of gaslock on the side of her esuit.Fassin, contained and sustained within the arrow craft, was really only here to watch.Yes, he said.Where do you think it might be?I thought that Library One was his study, Nuern said, selecting a helping of something glowing dull blue from the central carousel, and then spinning the serving dish slowly towards his dining companions.Me too, Livilido said.He looked at Fassin.Why, was there another one?Has a bit dropped off the place?Fassin had taken a look round all the library spheres.Library One had always been Valseirs formal study, where he received fellow scholars and other people, but it hadnt been his real study, his den, his private space.Very few people were allowed in there.Fassin had felt flattered in the extreme to be invited to enter the nestlike nook that Valseir had made for himself inside the stretch of disused CloudTunnel tube which the rest of the house had been anchored to the last time Fassin had been here, centuries earlier.Library One still looked as it always had, minus a few thousand book crystals and a big cylindrical low temperature storage device in which Valseir had kept paper and plastic books.It certainly didnt look as though the room had become Valseirs proper study in the interim.And now it appeared as though these people didnt even know hed had a more private den in the first place.I thought he had another study, Fassin said.Didnt he keep a house in what city was it?Guldrenk?Ah!Of course, Nuern said.That would be it.Colonel, these guys know nothing.I had been coming to the same conclusion.Library Twenty One (Cincturia\Clouders\Miscellania) had a conceit, a Dweller equivalent of a door made from a bookcase.Valseir had shown it to Fassin after the human had stayed with him for an extended period after their first meeting.It led, inward at first, towards the centre of the cluster of library spheres, through a short passage to a gap between two more of the outer spheres, then into the open gas.The joke  a hidden door, a secret passage  was that the various Cincturia were the outsiders of the galactic community, and the particular bookcase hiding the secret passage was categorised Escapees.After their meal, Fassin gave the impression of shutting himself away in the library for some late night shelf scanning.Instead he screened up the houses system statements and looked back to just after the time of Valseirs yachting accident and alleged death.He did something unusual, something barely legal by Mercatorial standards and usually pointless on Nasqueron; he speeded up, letting the gascrafts legal max computers and his own subtly altered nervous system rev to their combined data processing limit.It still took nearly half an hour, but he found what he was looking for: the point, a dozen days after Valseirs accident, when the house recorded a rerouting of power and ventilation plumbing.Its altimeter had registered a wobble, too  a brief blip upwards, then the start of the long, slow descent that was continuing even now.Then Fassin had to work out where the CloudTunnel segment might be now.It would be beyond the start of the shear zone, past where the whole atmospheric band moved as a single vast mass, down into the semi liquid Depths.These moved much more slowly than the gas above, the transition levels great turbidly elastic seas being dragged along as though reluctantly after the jet stream whirl of atmosphere above.It was all dead reckoning.By the Dweller way of judging such things, the atmosphere was static and the Depths  not to mention the remainder of Ulubis system, the stars and indeed the rest of the universe  moved.With only notionally fixed reference points, finding anything in the Depths was notoriously difficult.After two hundred years the section of CloudTunnel could be anywhere; it might have sunk beyond feasible reach, been broken up or even drifted to the Zone edge and been pulled into another Belt entirely, either north or south.The only thing working in Fassins favour was that the length of tube he was looking for was relatively large.Completely losing something forty plus metres in diameter and eighty klicks long wasnt that easy, even in Nasqueron.Still, he was relying on the CloudTunnel retaining the usual profile of buoyancy decay.The likely volume  though identified with a worrying degree of fuzziness  was about five thousand kilcks away, though coming closer all the time, having been all the way round the planet many times.In a dozen hours it would be almost right underneath the house again.He calculated.It was doable.He pinged a note to the screen on the librarys door saying that he didnt want to be disturbed.Fassin let himself out through the hidden door about an hour after hed entered the library.He let the little gascraft grow, pushing trim spaces out to create internal vacuums and a larger, near spherical outer shape so that he fell gently at first, causing as little turbulence as possible beneath the house.Then gradually he heavied, slowly shrinking the arrowhead to its dart slim minimum, diving unpowered into the dark depths and through the rough boundary of the near static cylinder of depleted gas that was all that remained of the ancient storm.He powered up twenty klicks deeper and levelled out, then rose quickly when he was thirty lateral kilometres clear, zooming up through the gradually cooling, slowly thinning gas above until he was through the haze layers and out amongst the cloud tops.Fassin increased to maximum speed, configuring the arrowhead for as stealthy a profile as it could support.The gascraft had never been designed for such shenanigans, but it had been gradually altered over the years by him and Hervil Apsile until  while no match for a genuine military machine  it made less of a fuss moving across the face of the planet than almost anything within the gas giants atmosphere (always discounting the usual preposterous Dweller claims of invisible ships, inertialess drives and zero point subspacials).The little craft moved beneath the thin yellow sky, and the stars above seemed to slow down then go into reverse as Fassin flew faster than the combined speed of the planet revolving and the band beneath him jet streaming in the same direction.After less than an hour of flight, seeing nothing in the heavens above or in the skies beneath that would have led anyone to think there was life anywhere else in all the universe, he slowed and dropped, a shaftless arrowhead heading straight for the heart of the planet.He let the increasing density slow him further, feeling the resulting friction heat leak through the gascrafts hull and into his flesh.Through the upper shear boundary  only hazily defined, kilometres thick, prone to vast slow waves and unpredictable swells and sudden troughs  he entered the shear zone itself, starting to circle through the crushing fluidity of jelly thick atmosphere.If the section of CloudTunnel was still in the volume, this was where it ought to be, fallen amongst the depths, making its slow way down to an equilibrium of weight and buoyancy within the gradually thickening press of hydrogen gas turning to liquid.There was always a chance that it had gone the other way, lifting towards the cloud tops, but that would be unusual.Disused CloudTunnel, ribbed with vacuum tubes, tended to gain gas and therefore additional weight through osmosis over the millennia.When Fassin had been here two hundred years earlier, Valseir was already having to add buoyancy to the Tunnel to keep it from sinking too fast and dragging the whole house and library complex with it.Anyway, if the derelict section had risen it ought to have stayed within the same atmospheric band and so shown up somewhere on the charts of the Poaflias, and it hadnt.He went on spiralling, keeping slow, sonosensing only gently so that there would be less chance of anybody who might be listening nearby overhearing him.(Could the colonel have followed him without him being aware of her?Probably.But why would she?Still, he had the feeling he ought to be as discreet as he could. )Light wasnt much use.CloudTunnel wall would appear almost transparent down here.Probes for magnetic and radiation vestiges were of even less utility, and there would be no scent trace either.After two hours, near the limit of the time that he thought he could reasonably spend away from the house, and some time after hed decided the hell with discretion and ramped his active sensors up to maximum, Fassin found one end of the CloudTunnel, looming out of the gel thick mist like a vast dark mouth.He took the little gascraft into the forty metre wide maw, turning up his sonosense now that the signals would be shielded by the walls of the CloudTunnel section itself.He increased his speed, too, barrelling along the great slowly curving tube like the ghost of some Dweller long gone.The study shell was still there, a hollow sphere almost filling the CloudTunnel tube near the mid point of its eighty kilometre length, but it had been ransacked, stripped bare.Whatever secrets it might have held had long since been taken or trashed.Fassin turned some lights on to check round the place, finding nothing intact, nothing beyond empty shelves and ragged lengths of carbon board, diamond dust like frosted ice and frayed fibres, waving in the turbulence of his passing.He formed a tiny cavity with his sonosense and watched it collapse instantly, snapped to nothing by the grinding weight of the column of gas above it.A fine place to feel crushed, he thought, then went back the way hed come and ascended slowly to the house and Library Twenty One again.The colonel was there.She looked startled when he appeared from behind the hidden door, even though hed told her earlier what he intended to do.Major.Seer Taak.Fassin, she said.She sounded odd.Fassin looked around.Nobody else here; good, he thought.Yes?he said, letting the bookcase door close behind him.Hatherence floated right up to him, stopping just a metre away.Her esuit showed a uniform dull grey he hadnt seen her display before.Colonel, he asked her.Are you all right?Is everything  There is you must prepare I I am sorry to  There is bad news, Fassin, she said finally, in a rushed, broken voice.Very bad news.I am so sorry.* * *  The Archimandrite Luseferous did not

terminology), for appearing to believe one thing while, at best, actually not caring one way or the other.He had never really cared whether the Truth was true.The idea of faith interested him, even fascinated him, not as an intellectual idea, not as a concept or some abstract theoretical framework, but as a way of controlling people, as a way of understanding and so manipulating them.As a flaw, in the end, as something which was wrong with others that was not wrong with him.Sometimes he could not believe all the advantages other people seemed prepared to hand him.They had faith and so would do things that were plainly not in their own immediate (or, often, long term) best interests, because they just believed what they had been told; they experienced altruism and so did things that, again, were not necessarily to their advantage; they had sentimental or emotional attachments to others and so could be coerced, once more, into doing things they would not have done otherwise.And  best of all, he sometimes thought  people were self deceiving.They thought they were brave when they were really cowards, or imagined they could think for themselves when they most blatantly could not, or believed they were clever when they were just good at passing exams, or thought they were compassionate when they were just sentimental.The real strength came from a perfectly simple maxim: Be completely honest with yourself; only ever deceive others.So many edges!So many ways that people made his progress easier.If everybody hed ever met and competed with and struggled against had been just like him in these respects hed have had a much harder rise to power.He might not even have prevailed at all, because without all these advantages it largely came down to luck, and he might not have had sufficient.In the old days he had once wondered how many of the Cessorian high command, his old bosses, really believed in the Truth.He strongly suspected that the higher you went, the greater grew the proportion of those who didnt really believe at all.They were in it for the power, the glory, the control and the glamour.Now he rarely thought about any of that.Now he would just assume that anybody in such a position would be completely and cynically self interested and be mildly surprised and even slightly disgusted to find that any of them really did have genuine faith.The disgust would come from the feeling that the person concerned was letting down the side, and the suspicion that they would feel they were somehow  perversely  superior to their less deluded peers.And so you really believe in all that?You really do?Sir, of course, sir!It is the rational faith.Simple logic dictates.It is inescapable.You know this better than I, sir.Sir, I think you tease me.The girl looked away, smiling down, coquettish, shy, perhaps a little alarmed, just possibly even daring to feel slightly insulted.He reached out and took her hair, swinging her face round to his, a gold dark silhouette against the sparse sprinkle of distant stars.Child, I am not sure that in all my life I have ever teased.Not once.The girl did not seem to know what to say.She looked around, perhaps at the pale stars through the screen glass, perhaps at the snow white tumble of low gee puff bedding, perhaps at the shell of screens forming the walls of their little nest, surfaces on which startlingly detailed and inventive acts of sexuality were being enacted.Perhaps she looked at her two companions, both now curled and asleep.Well, then, sir, she said at last, not teased.I would not say you teased me.Perhaps rather that you make fun of me because you are so much more educated and clever than me.That, the Archimandrite thought, was perhaps more like it.But he still was not sure.Did this young thing still carry the Truth inside her, even after all the normal span generations that had come and gone since hed formally swept away all this nonsense?In a way it didnt matter in the slightest; as long as nobody ever began to use their religion to organise against him he could not care less what people really thought.Obey me, fear me.Hate me if you want.Dont ever pretend to love me.That was all he asked of people.Faith was just another lever, like sentiment, like empathy, like love (or what people thought was love, what they claimed was love, the fanciful, maybe even dishonest bit that wasnt lust, which was honest.And, of course, another lever).But he wanted to know.A less civilised fellow in his situation would have considered having the girl tortured to find out the truth, but people being tortured over something like this soon ended up just telling you what they thought you wanted to hear  anything to get the pain to stop.Hed learned that quickly enough.There was a better way.He reached for the pods remote control and adjusted the spin, creating the illusion of gravity once more.Go on all fours in front of the window, he told the girl.Its time again.Sir, of course, sir.The girl quickly assumed the position he wanted, crouched against the oncoming star field, seemingly fixed even though the pod was revolving.The brightest sun, screen dead centre, was Ulubis.Luseferous had had his genitals enhanced in all sorts of ways.One improvement was that he carried glands inside his body which allowed him to produce many different secretions which his ejaculate could then carry into the bodies of others (but whose effects he was proof against, obviously), including irritants, hallucinogens, cannabinoids, capsainoids, sleeping draughts and truth serums.He went briefly into the little death little trance, the petit mal which allowed him to select one of these, and chose the last mentioned, the truth drug.He took the girl anally; it was faster acting that way.And discovered that she really did believe in the Truth.Though it also emerged that she thought he was horribly ancient and weird looking and a frightening, sick minded old sadist and she absolutely hated being fucked by him.He thought about inseminating her with thanaticin, or employing one of the physical options his remade penis made possible: the shaved horsetail, perhaps.Or just ejecting her into the vacuum and watching her die.In the end Luseferous decided that letting her live with such constant degradation was punishment enough.Hed always said he preferred being despised, after all.He would make her his favourite.Probably wise to put her on suicide watch, too.* * *  The Dwellers held that the ability to suffer was what ultimately marked out sentient life from any other sort.They didnt mean just the ability to feel physical pain, they meant real suffering, they meant the sort of suffering that was all the worse because the creature undergoing the experience could appreciate it fully, could think back to when it had not suffered so, look forward to when it might stop (or despair of it ever stopping  despair was a large component of this) and know that if things had been different it might not be suffering now.Brains required, see?Imagination.Any brainless thing with a rudimentary nervous system could feel pain.Suffering took intelligence.Of course, Dwellers didnt feel pain, and claimed never to suffer, except in the trivial sense of suffering fools because they were part of the family, or experiencing the deleterious physical and mental effects of a serious hangover.So, by their own reckoning, they werent really sentient.At which point the average Dweller, assuming without question that they were absolutely self evidently the most sentient and intelligent things around in anybodys neck of the woods, would just throw their spine limbs out, shake their mantle ruff and start talking loudly about paradoxes.He faced to spin, carried in the jet stream at five hundred kilometres per hour.Motionless.He side slipped, found a small eddy, just a curl, a tiny yellow white wisp a couple of klicks across in the great empty skies of orange and red and brown.He moved through the gas.
