Jessica sighed.She knew she was trying to keep her thoughts off her son and the dangers he faced  the pit traps with their poisoned barbs, the Harkonnen raids (although these were growing fewer as the Fremen took their toll of aircraft and raiders with the new weapons Paul had given them), and the natural dangers of the desert  makers and thirst and dust chasms.She thought of calling for coffee and with the thought came that ever present awareness of paradox in the Fremen way of life: how well they lived in these sietch caverns compared to the graben pyons; yet, how much more they endured in the open hajr of the desert than anything the Harkonnen bondsmen endured.A dark hand inserted itself through the hangings beside her, deposited a cup upon the table and withdrew.From the cup arose the aroma of spiced coffee.An offering from the birth celebration, Jessica thought.She took the coffee and sipped it, smiling at herself.In what other society of our universe, she asked herself, could a person of my station accept an anonymous drink and quaff that drink without fear?I could alter any poison now before it did me harm, of course, but the donor doesnt realize this.She drained the cup, feeling the energy and lift of its contents  hot and delicious.And she wondered what other society would have such a natural regard for her privacy and comfort that the giver would intrude only enough to deposit the gift and not inflict her with the donor?Respect and love had sent the gift  with only a slight tinge of fear.Another element of the incident forced itself into her awareness: she had thought of coffee and it had appeared.There was nothing of telepathy here, she knew.It was the tau, the oneness of the sietch community, a compensation from the subtle poison of the spice diet they shared.The great mass of the people could never hope to attain the enlightenment the spice seed brought to her; they had not been trained and prepared for it.Their minds rejected what they could not understand or encompass.Still they felt and reacted sometimes like a single organism.And the thought of coincidence never entered their minds.Has Paul passed his test on the sand?Jessica asked herself.Hes capable, but accident can strike down even the most capable.The waiting.Its the dreariness, she thought.You can wait just so long.Then the dreariness of the waiting overcomes you.There was all manner of waiting in their lives.More than two years weve been here, she thought, and twice that number at least to go before we can even hope to think of trying to wrest Arrakis from the Harkonnen governor, the Mudir Nahya, the Beast Rabban.Reverend Mother?The voice from outside the hangings at her door was that of Harah, the other woman in Pauls menage.Yes, Harah.The hangings parted and Harah seemed to glide through them.She wore sietch sandals, a red yellow wraparound that exposed her arms almost to the shoulders.Her black hair was parted in the middle and swept back like the wings of an insect, flat and oily against her head.The jutting, predatory features were drawn into an intense frown.Behind Harah came Alia, a girl child of about two years.Seeing her daughter, Jessica was caught as she frequently was by Alias resemblance to Paul at that age  the same wide eyed solemnity to her questing look, the dark hair and firmness of mouth.But there were subtle differences, too, and it was in these that most adults found Alia disquieting.The child  little more than a toddler  carried herself with a calmness and awareness beyond her years.Adults were shocked to find her laughing at a subtle play of words between the sexes.Or theyd catch themselves listening to her half lisping voice, still blurred as it was by an unformed soft palate, and discover in her words sly remarks that could only be based on experiences no two year old had ever encountered.Harah sank to a cushion with an exasperated sigh, frowned at the child.Alia.Jessica motioned to her daughter.The child crossed to a cushion beside her mother, sank to it and clasped her mothers hand.The contact of flesh restored that mutual awareness they had shared since before Alias birth.It wasnt a matter of shared thoughts  although there were bursts of that if they touched while Jessica was changing the spice poison for a ceremony.It was something larger, an immediate awareness of another living spark, a sharp and poignant thing, a nerve simpatico that made them emotionally one.In the formal manner that befitted a member of her sons household, Jessica said: Subakh ul kuhar, Harah.This night finds you well?With the same traditional formality, she said: Subakh un nar.I am well.The words were almost toneless.Again, she sighed.Jessica sensed amusement from Alia.My brothers ghanima is annoyed with me, Alia said in her half lisp.Jessica marked the term Alia used to refer to Harah  ghanima.In the subtleties of the Fremen tongue, the word meant something acquired in battle and with the added overtone that the something no longer was used for its original purpose.An ornament, a spearhead used as a curtain weight.Harah scowled at the child.Dont try to insult me, child.I know my place.What have you done this time, Alia?Jessica asked.Harah answered: Not only has she refused to play with the other children today, but she intruded where   I hid behind the hangings and watched Subiays child being born, Alia said.Its a boy.He cried and cried.What a set of lungs!When hed cried long enough  She came out and touched him, Harah said, and he stopped crying.Everyone knows a Fremen baby must get his crying done at birth if hes in sietch because he can never cry again lest he betray us on hajr.Hed cried enough, Alia said.I just wanted to feel his spark, his life.Thats all.And when he felt me he didnt want to cry anymore.Its just made more talk among the people, Harah said.Subiays boy is healthy?Jessica asked.She saw that something was troubling Harah deeply and wondered at it.Healthy as any mother could ask, Harah said.They know Alia didnt hurt him.They didnt so much mind her touching him.He settled down right away and was happy.It was  Harah shrugged.Its the strangeness of my daughter, is that it?Jessica asked.Its the way she speaks of things beyond her years and of things no child her age could know  things of the past.How could she know what a child looked like on Bela Tegeuse?Harah demanded.But he does!Alia said.Subiays boy looks just like the son of Mitha born before the parting.Alia!Jessica said.I warned you.But, Mother, I saw it and it was true and   Jessica shook her head, seeing the signs of disturbance in Harahs face.What have I borne?Jessica asked herself.A daughter who knew at birth everything that I knew  and more: everything revealed to her out of the corridors of the past by the Reverend Mothers within me.Its not just the things she says, Harah said.Its the exercises, too: the way she sits and stares at a rock, moving only one muscle beside her nose, or a muscle on the back of a finger, or  Those are the Bene Gesserit training, Jessica said.You know that, Harah.Would you deny my daughter her inheritance?Reverend Mother, you know these things dont matter to me, Harah said.Its the people and the way they mutter.I feel danger in it.They say your daughters a demon, that other children refuse to play with her, that shes  She has so little in common with the other children, Jessica said.Shes no demon.Its just the  Of course shes not!Jessica found herself surprised at the vehemence in Harahs tone, glanced down at Alia.The child appeared lost in thought, radiating a sense of  waiting.Jessica returned her attention to Harah.I respect the fact that youre a member of my sons household, Jessica said.(Alia stirred against her hand. )You may speak openly with me of whatevers troubling you.I will not be a member of your sons household much longer, Harah said.Ive waited this long for the sake of my sons, the special training they receive as the children of Usul.Its little enough I could give them since its known I dont share your sons bed.Again Alia stirred beside her, half sleeping, warm.Youd have made a good companion for my son, though, Jessica said.And she added to herself because such thoughts were ever with her: Companion  not a wife, Jessicas thoughts went then straight to the center, to the pang that came from the common talk in the sietch that her sons companionship with Chani had become the permanent thing, the marriage.I love Chani, Jessica thought, but she reminded herself that love might have to step aside for royal necessity.Royal marriages had other reasons than love.You think I dont know what you plan for your son?Harah asked.What do you mean?Jessica demanded.You plan to unite the tribes under Him, Harah said.Is that bad?I see danger for him  and Alia is part of that danger.Alia nestled closer to her mother, eyes opened now and studying Harah.Ive watched you two together, Harah said, the way you touch.And Alia is like my own flesh because shes sister to one who is like my brother.Ive watched over her and guarded her from the time she was a mere baby, from the time of the razzia when we fled here.Ive seen many things about her.Jessica nodded, feeling disquiet begin to grow in Alia beside her.You know what I mean, Harah said.The way she knew from the first what we were saying to her.When has there been another baby who knew the water discipline so young?What other babys first words to her nurse were: I love you, Harah?Harah stared at Alia.Why do you think I accept her insults?I know theres no malice in them.Alia looked up at her mother.Yes, I have reasoning powers, Reverend Mother, Harah said.I could have been of the sayyadina.I have seen what I have seen.Harah Jessica shrugged.I dont know what to say.And she felt surprised at herself, because this literally was true.Alia straightened, squared her shoulders.Jessica felt the sense of waiting ended, an emotion compounded of decision and sadness.We made a mistake, Alia said.Now we need Harah.It was the ceremony of the seed, Harah said, when you changed the Water of Life, Reverend Mother, when Alia was yet unborn within you.Need Harah?Jessica asked herself.Who else can talk among the people and make them begin to understand me?Alia asked.What would you have her do?Jessica asked.She already knows what to do, Alia said.I will tell them the truth, Harah said.Her face seemed suddenly old and sad with its olive skin drawn into frown wrinkles, a witchery in the sharp features.I will tell them that Alia only pretends to be a little girl, that she has never been a little girl.Alia shook her head.Tears ran down her cheeks, and Jessica felt the wave of sadness from her daughter as though the emotion were her own.I know Im a freak, Alia whispered.The adult summation coming from the child mouth was like a bitter confirmation.Youre not a freak!Harah snapped.Who dared say youre a freak?Again, Jessica marveled at the fierce note of protectiveness in Harahs voice.Jessica saw then that Alia had judged correctly  they did need Harah.The tribe would understand Harah  both her words and her emotions  for it was obvious she loved Alia as though this were her own child.Who said it?Harah repeated.Nobody.Alia used a corner of Jessicas aba to wipe the tears from her face.She smoothed the robe where she had dampened and crumpled it.Then dont you say it, Harah ordered.Yes, Harah.Now, Harah said, you may tell me what it was like so that I may tell the others.Tell me what it is that happened to you.Alia swallowed, looked up at her mother.Jessica nodded.One day I woke up, Alia said.It was like waking from sleep except that I could not remember going to sleep.I was in a warm, dark place.And I was frightened.Listening to the half lisping voice of her daughter, Jessica remembered that day in the big cavern.When I was frightened, Alia said, I tried to escape, but there was no way to escape.Then I saw a spark  but it wasnt exactly like seeing it.The spark was just there with me and I felt the sparks emotions  soothing me, comforting me, telling me that way that everything would be all right.That was my mother.Harah rubbed at her eyes, smiled reassuringly at Alia.Yet there was a look of wildness in the eyes of the Fremen woman, an intensity as though they, too, were trying to hear Alias words.And Jessica thought: What do we really know of how such a one thinks  out of her unique experiences and training and ancestry?Just when I felt safe and reassured, Alia said, there was another spark with us  and everything was happening at once.The other spark was the old Reverend Mother.She was  trading lives with my mother  everything  and I was there with them, seeing it all  everything.And it was over, and I was them and all the others and myself only it took me a long time to find myself again.There were so many others.It was a cruel thing,Jessica said.No being should wake into consciousness thus.The wonder of it is you could accept all that happened to you.I couldnt do anything else!Alia said.I didnt know how to reject or hide my consciousness  or shut it off  everything just happened  everything   We didnt know, Harah murmured.When we gave your mother the Water to change, we didnt know you existed within her.Dont be sad about it, Harah, Alia said.I shouldnt feel sorry for myself.After all, theres cause for happiness here: Im a Reverend Mother.The tribe has two Rev   She broke off, tipping her head to listen.Harah rocked back on her heels against the sitting cushion, stared at Alia, bringing her attention then up to Jessicas face.Didnt you suspect?Jessica asked.Sh h h h, Alia said.A distant rhythmic chanting came to them then through the hangings that separated them from the sietch corridors.It grew louder, carrying distinct sounds now: Ya!Ya!Yawm!Ya!Ya!Yawm!Mu zein, Wallah!Ya!Ya!Yawm!Mu zein, Wallah!The chanters passed the outer entrance, and their voices boomed through to the inner apartments.Slowly the sound receded.When the sound had dimmed sufficiently, Jessica began the ritual, the sadness in her voice: It was Ramadhan and April on Bela Tegeuse.My family sat in their pool courtyard, Harah said, in air breathed by the moisture that arose from the spray of a fountain.There was a tree of portyguls, round and deep in color, near at hand.There was a basket with mish mish and baklawa and mugs of liban  all manner of good things to eat.In our gardens and in our flocks, there was peace  peace in all the land.Life was full with happiness until the raiders came, Alia said.Blood ran cold at the screams of friends,Jessica said.And she felt the memories rushing through her out of all those other pasts she shared.La, la, la, the women cried, said Harah.The raiders came through the mushtamal, rushing at us with their knives dripping red from the lives of our men,Jessica said.Silence came over the three of them as it was in all the apartments of the sietch, the silence while they remembered and kept their grief thus fresh.Presently, Harah uttered the ritual ending to the ceremony, giving the words a harshness that Jessica had never before heard in them.We will never forgive and we will never forget, Harah said.In the thoughtful quiet that followed her words, they heard a muttering of people, the swish of many robes.Jessica sensed someone standing beyond the hangings that shielded her chamber.Reverend Mother?A womans voice, and Jessica recognized it: the voice of Tharthar, one of Stilgars wives.What is it, Tharthar?There is trouble, Reverend Mother.Jessica felt a constriction at her heart, an abrupt fear for Paul.Paul  she gasped.Tharthar spread the hangings, stepped into the chamber.Jessica glimpsed a press of people in the outer room before the hangings fell.She looked up at Tharthar  a small, dark woman in a red figured robe of black, the total blue of her eyes trained fixedly on Jessica, the nostrils of her tiny nose dilated to reveal the plug scars.What is it?Jessica demanded.There is word from the sand, Tharthar said.Usul meets the maker for his test  it is today.The young men say he cannot fail, he will be a sandrider by nightfall.The young men are banding for a razzia.They will raid in the north and meet Usul there.They say they will raise the cry then.They say they will force him to call out Stilgar and assume command of the tribes.Gathering water, planting the dunes, changing their world slowly but surely  these are no longer enough, Jessica thought.The little raids, the certain raids  these are no longer enough now that Paul and I have trained them.They feel their power.They want to fight.Tharthar shifted from one foot to the other, cleared her throat.We know the need for cautious waiting, Jessica thought, but theres the core of our frustration.We know also the harm that waiting extended too long can do to us.We lose our sense of purpose if the waitings prolonged.The young men say if Usul does not call out Stilgar, then he must be afraid, Tharthar said.She lowered her gaze.So thats the way of it,Jessica muttered.And she thought: Well, I saw it coming.As did Stilgar.Again, Tharthar cleared her throat.Even my brother, Shoab, says it, she said.They will leave Usul no choice.Then it has come, Jessica thought.And Paul will have to handle it himself.The Reverend Mother dare not become involved in the succession.Alia freed her hand from her mothers, said: I will go with Tharthar and listen to the young men.Perhaps there is a way.Jessica met Tharthars gaze, but spoke to Alia: Go, then.And report to me as soon as you can.We do not want this thing to happen, Reverend Mother, Tharthar said.We do not want it, Jessica agreed.The tribe needs all its strength.She glanced at Harah.Will you go with them?Harah answered the unspoken part of the question: Tharthar will allow no harm to befall Alia.She knows we will soon be wives together, she and I, to share the same man.We have talked, Tharthar and I.  Harah looked up at Tharthar, back to Jessica.We have an understanding.Tharthar held out a hand for Alia, said: We must hurry.The young men are leaving.They pressed through the hangings, the childs hand in the small womans hand, but the child seemed to be leading.If Paul MuadDib slays Stilgar, this will not serve the tribe, Harah said.Always before, it has been the way of succession, but times have changed.Times have changed for you, as well,Jessica said.You cannot think I doubt the outcome of such a battle, Harah said.Usul could not but win.That was my meaning,Jessica said.And you think my personal feelings enter into my judgment, Harah said.She shook her head, her water rings tinkling at her neck.How wrong you are.Perhaps you think, as well, that I regret not being the chosen of Usul, that I am jealous of Chani?You make your own choice as you are able,Jessica said.I pity Chani, Harah said.Jessica stiffened.What do you mean?I know what you think of Chani, Harah said.You think she is not the wife for your son.Jessica settled back, relaxed on her cushions.She shrugged.Perhaps.You could be right, Harah said.If you are, you may find a surprising ally  Chani herself.She wants whatever is best for Him.Jessica swallowed past a sudden tightening in her throat.Chanis very dear to me, she said.She could be no  Your rugs are very dirty in here, Harah said.She swept her gaze around the floor, avoiding Jessicas eyes.So many people tramping through here all the time.You really should have them cleaned more often.You cannot avoid the interplay of politics within an orthodox religion.This power struggle permeates the training, educating and disciplining of the orthodox community.Because of this pressure, the leaders of such a community inevitably must face that ultimate internal question: to succumb to complete opportunism as the price of maintaining their rule, or risk sacrificing themselves for the sake of the orthodox ethic.from MuadDib: The Religious Issues by the Princess Irulan     Paul waited on the sand outside the gigantic makers line of approach.I must not wait like a smuggler  impatient and jittering, he reminded himself.I must be part of the desert.The thing was only minutes away now, filling the morning with the friction hissing of its passage.Its great teeth within the cavern circle of its mouth spread like some enormous flower.The spice odor from it dominated the air.Pauls stillsuit rode easily on his body and he was only distantly aware of his nose plugs, the breathing mask.Stilgars teaching, the painstaking hours on the sand, overshadowed all else.How far outside the makers radius must you stand in pea sand?Stilgar had asked him.And he had answered correctly: Half a meter for every meter of the makers diameter.Why?To avoid the vortex of its passage and still have time to run in and mount it.Youve ridden the little ones bred for the seed and the Water of Life, Stilgar had said.But what youll summon for your test is a wild maker, an old man of the desert.You must have proper respect for such a one.Now the thumpers deep drumming blended with the hiss of the approaching worm.Paul breathed deeply, smelling mineral bitterness even through his filters.The wild maker, the old man of the desert, loomed almost on him.Its cresting front segments threw a sandwave that would sweep across his knees.Come up, you lovely monster, he thought.Up.You hear me calling.Come up.Come up.The wave lifted his feet.Surface dust swept across him.He steadied himself, his world dominated by the passage of that sand clouded curving wall, that segmented cliff, the ring lines sharply defined in it.Paul lifted his hooks, sighted along them, leaned in.He felt them bite and pull.He leaped upward, planting his feet against that wall, leaning out against the clinging barbs.This was the true instant of the testing: if he had planted the hooks correctly at the leading edge of a ring segment, opening the segment, the worm would not roll down and crush him.The worm slowed.It glided across the thumper, silencing it.Slowly, it began to roll  up, up  bringing those irritant barbs as high as possible, away from the sand that threatened the soft inner lapping of its ring segment.Paul found himself riding upright atop the worm.He felt exultant, like an emperor surveying his world.He suppressed a sudden urge to cavort there, to turn the worm, to show off his mastery of this creature.Suddenly he understood why Stilgar had warned him once about brash young men who danced and played with these monsters, doing handstands on their backs, removing both hooks and replanting them before the worm could spill them.Leaving one hook in place, Paul released the other and planted it lower down the side.When the second hook was firm and tested, he brought down the first one, thus worked his way down the side.The maker rolled, and as it rolled, it turned, coming around the sweep of flour sand where the others waited.Paul saw them come up, using their hooks to climb, but avoiding the sensitive ring edges until they were on top.They rode at last in a triple line behind him, steadied against their hooks.Stilgar moved up through the ranks, checked the positioning of Pauls hooks, glanced up at Pauls smiling face.You did it, eh?Stilgar asked, raising his voice above the hiss of their passage.Thats what you think?You did it?He straightened.Now I tell you that was a very sloppy job.We have twelve year olds who do better.There was drumsand to your left where you waited.You could not retreat there if the worm turned that way.The smile slipped from Pauls face.I saw the drumsand.Then why did you not signal for one of us to take up position secondary to you?It was a thing you could do even in the test.Paul swallowed, faced into the wind of their passage.You think it bad of me to say this now, Stilgar said.It is my duty.I think of your worth to the troop.If you had stumbled into that drumsand, the maker wouldve turned toward you.In spite of a surge of anger, Paul knew that Stilgar spoke the truth.It took a long minute and the full effort of the training he had received from his mother for Paul to recapture a feeling of calm.I apologize, he said.It will not happen again.In a tight position, always leave yourself a secondary, someone to take the maker if you cannot, Stilgar said.Remember that we work together.That way, were certain.We work together, eh?He slapped Pauls shoulder.We work together, Paul agreed.Now, Stilgar said, and his voice was harsh, show me you know how to handle a maker.Which side are we on?Paul glanced down at the scaled ring surface on which they stood, noted the character and size of the scales, the way they grew larger off to his right, smaller to his left.Every worm, he knew, moved characteristically with one side up more frequently.As it grew older, the characteristic up side became an almost constant thing.Bottom scales grew larger, heavier, smoother.Top scales could be told by size alone on a big worm.Shifting his hooks, Paul moved to the left.He motioned flankers down to open segments along the side and keep the worm on a straight course as it rolled.When he had it turned, he motioned two steersmen out of the line and into positions ahead.Ach, haiiiii yoh!he shouted in the traditional call.The leftside steersman opened a ring segment there.In a majestic circle, the maker turned to protect its opened segment.Full around it came and when it was headed back to the south, Paul shouted: Geyrat!The steersman released his hook.The maker lined out in a straight course.Stilgar said: Very good, Paul MuadDib.With plenty of practice, you may yet become a sandrider.Paul frowned, thinking: Was I not first up?From behind him there came sudden laughter.The troops began chanting, flinging his name against the sky.MuadDib!MuadDib!MuadDib!MuadDib!And far to the rear along the worms surface, Paul heard the beat of the goaders pounding the tail segments.The worm began picking up speed.Their robes flapped in the wind.The abrasive sound of their passage increased.Paul looked back through the troop, found Chanis face among them.He looked at her as he spoke to Stilgar.Then I am a sandrider, Stil?Hal yawm!You are a sandrider this day.Then I may choose our destination?Thats the way of it.And I am a Fremen born this day here in the Habbanya erg.I have had no life before this day.I was as a child until this day.Not quite a child, Stilgar said.He fastened a corner of his hood where the wind was whipping it.But there was a cork sealing off my world, and that cork has been pulled.There is no cork.I would go south, Stilgar  twenty thumpers.I would see this land we make, this land that Ive only seen through the eyes of others.And I would see my son and my family, he thought.I need time now to consider the future that is a past within my mind.The turmoil comes and if Im not where I can unravel it, the thing will run wild.Stilgar looked at him with a steady, measuring gaze.Paul kept his attention on Chani, seeing the interest quicken in her face, noting also the excitement his words had kindled in the troop.The men are eager to raid with you in the Harkonnen sinks, Stilgar said.The sinks are only a thumper away.The Fedaykin have raided with me, Paul said.Theyll raid with me again until no Harkonnen breathes Arrakeen air.Stilgar studied him as they rode, and Paul realized the man was seeing this moment through the memory of how he had risen to command of the Tabr sietch and to leadership of the Council of Leaders now that Liet Kynes was dead.He has heard the reports of unrest among the young Fremen, Paul thought.Do you wish a gathering of the leaders?Stilgar asked.Eyes blazed among the young men of the troop.They swayed as they rode, and they watched.And Paul saw the look of unrest in Chanis glance, the way she looked from Stilgar, who was her uncle, to Paul MuadDib, who was her mate.You cannot guess what I want, Paul said.And he thought: I cannot back down.I must hold control over these people.You are mudir of the sandride this day, Stilgar said.Cold formality rang in his voice.How do you use this power?We need time to relax, time for cool reflection, Paul thought.We shall go south, Paul said.Even if I say we shall return back to the north when this day is over?We shall go south, Paul repeated.A sense of inevitable dignity enfolded Stilgar as he pulled his robe tightly around him.There will be a Gathering, he said.I will send the messages.He thinks I will call him out, Paul thought.And he knows he cannot stand against me.Paul faced south, feeling the wind against his exposed cheeks, thinking of the necessities that went into his decisions.They do not know how it is, he thought.But he knew he could not let any consideration deflect him.He had to remain on the central line of the time storm he could see in the future.There would come an instant when it could be unraveled, but only if he were where he could cut the central knot of it.I will not call him out if it can be helped, he thought.If theres another way to prevent the jihad   Well camp for the evening meal and prayer at Cave of Birds beneath Habbanya Ridge, Stilgar said.He steadied himself with one hook against the swaying of the maker, gestured ahead at a low rock barrier rising out of the desert.Paul studied the cliff, the great streaks of rock crossing it like waves.No green, no blossom softened that rigid horizon.Beyond it stretched the way to the southern desert  a course of at least ten days and nights, as fast as they could goad the makers.Twenty thumpers.The way led far beyond the Harkonnen patrols.He knew how it would be.The dreams had shown him.One day, as they went, thered be a faint change of color on the far horizon  such a slight change that he might feel he was imagining it out of his hopes  and there would be the new sietch.Does my decision suit MuadDib?Stilgar asked.Only the faintest touch of sarcasm tinged his voice, but Fremen ears around them, alert to every tone in a birds cry or a cielagos piping message, heard the sarcasm and watched Paul to see what he would do.Stilgar heard me swear my loyalty to him when we consecrated the Fedaykin, Paul said.My death commandos know I spoke with honor.Does Stilgar doubt it?Real pain exposed itself in Pauls voice.Stilgar heard it and lowered his gaze.Usul, the companion of my sietch, him I would never doubt, Stilgar said.But you are Paul MuadDib, the Atreides Duke, and you are the Lisan al Gaib, the Voice from the Outer World.These men I dont even know.Paul turned away to watch the Habbanya Ridge climb out of the desert.The maker beneath them still felt strong and willing.It could carry them almost twice the distance of any other in Fremen experience.He knew it.There was nothing outside the stories told to children that could match this old man of the desert.It was the stuff of a new legend, Paul realized.A hand gripped his shoulder.Paul looked at it, followed the arm to the face beyond it  the dark eyes of Stilgar exposed between filter mask and stillsuit hood.The one who led Tabr sietch before me, Stilgar said, he was my friend.We shared dangers.He owed me his life many a time  and I owed him mine.I am your friend, Stilgar, Paul said.No man doubts it, Stilgar said.He removed his hand, shrugged.Its the way.Paul saw that Stilgar was too immersed in the Fremen way to consider the possibility of any other.Here a leader took the reins from the dead hands of his predecessor, or slew among the strongest of his tribe if a leader died in the desert.Stilgar had risen to be a naib in that way.We should leave this maker in deep sand, Paul said.Yes, Stilgar agreed.We could walk to the cave from here.Weve ridden him far enough that hell bury himself and sulk for a day or so, Paul said.Youre the mudir of the sandride, Stilgar said.Say when we  He broke off, stared at the eastern sky.Paul whirled.The spice blue overcast on his eyes made the sky appear dark, a richly filtered azure against which a distant rhythmic flashing stood out in sharp contrast.Ornithopter!One small thopter, Stilgar said.Could be a scout, Paul said.Do you think theyve seen us.At this distance were just a worm on the surface, Stilgar said.He motioned with his left hand.Off.Scatter on the sand.The troop began working down the worms sides, dropping off, blending with the sand beneath their cloaks.Paul marked where Chani dropped.Presently, only he and Stilgar remained.First up, last off, Paul said.Stilgar nodded, dropped down the side on his hooks, leaped onto the sand.Paul waited until the maker was safely clear of the scatter area, then released his hooks.This was the tricky moment with a worm not completely exhausted.Freed of its goads and hooks, the big worm began burrowing into the sand.Paul ran lightly back along its broad surface, judged his moment carefully and leaped off.He landed running, lunged against the slipface of a dune the way he had been taught, and hid himself beneath the cascade of sand over his robe.Now, the waiting   Paul turned gently, exposed a crack of sky beneath a crease in his robe.He imagined the others back along their path doing the same.He heard the beat of the thopters wings before he saw it.There was a whisper of jetpods and it came over his patch of desert, turned in a broad arc toward the ridge.An unmarked thopter, Paul noted.It flew out of sight beyond Habbanya Ridge.A bird cry sounded over the desert.Another.Paul shook himself free of sand, climbed to the dune top.Other figures stood out in a line trailing away from the ridge.He recognized Chani and Stilgar among them.Stilgar signaled toward the ridge.They gathered and began the sandwalk, gliding over the surface in a broken rhythm that would disturb no maker.Stilgar paced himself beside Paul along the windpacked crest of a dune.It was a smuggler craft, Stilgar said.So it seemed, Paul said.But this is deep into the desert for smugglers.Theyve their difficulties with patrols, too, Stilgar said.If they come this deep, they may go deeper, Paul said.True.It wouldnt be well for them to see what they could see if they ventured too deep into the south.Smugglers sell information, too.They were hunting spice, dont you think?Stilgar asked.There will be a wing and a crawler waiting somewhere for that one, Paul said.Weve spice.Lets bait a patch of sand and catch us some smugglers.They should be taught that this is our land and our men need practice with the new weapons.Now, Usul speaks, Stilgar said.Usul thinks Fremen.But Usul must give way to decisions that match a terrible purpose, Paul thought.And the storm was gathering.When law and duty are one, united by religion, you never become fully conscious, fully aware of yourself.You are always a little less than an individual.from MuadDib: The Ninety nine Wonders of The Universe by the Princess Irulan     The smugglers spice factory with its parent carrier and ring of drone ornithopters came over a lifting of dunes like a swarm of insects following its queen.Ahead of the swarm lay one of the low rock ridges that lifted from the desert floor like small imitations of the Shield Wall.The dry beaches of the ridge were swept clean by a recent storm.In the con bubble of the factory, Gurney Halleck leaned forward, adjusted the oil lenses of his binoculars and examined the landscape.Beyond the ridge, he could see a dark patch that might be a spiceblow, and he gave the signal to a hovering ornithopter that sent it to investigate.The thopter waggled its wings to indicate it had the signal.It broke away from the swarm, sped down toward the darkened sand, circled the area with its detectors dangling close to the surface.Almost immediately, it went through the wing tucked dip and circle that told the waiting factory that spice had been found.Gurney sheathed his binoculars, knowing the others had seen the signal.He liked this spot.The ridge offered some shielding and protection.This was deep in the desert, an unlikely place for an ambush  still  Gurney signaled for a crew to hover over the ridge, to scan it, sent reserves to take up station in pattern around the area  not too high because then they could be seen from afar by Harkonnen detectors.He doubted, though, that Harkonnen patrols would be this far south.This was still Fremen country.Gurney checked his weapons, damning the fate that made shields useless out here.Anything that summoned a worm had to be avoided at all costs.He rubbed the inkvine scar along his jaw, studying the scene, decided it would be safest to lead a ground party through the ridge.Inspection on foot was still the most certain.You couldnt be too careful when Fremen and Harkonnen were at each others throats.It was Fremen that worried him here.They didnt mind trading for all the spice you could afford, but they were devils on the warpath if you stepped foot where they forbade you to go.And they were so devilishly cunning of late.It annoyed Gurney, the cunning and adroitness in battle of these natives.They displayed a sophistication in warfare as good as anything he had ever encountered, and he had been trained by the best fighters in the universe then seasoned in battles where only the superior few survived.Again Gurney scanned the landscape, wondering why he felt uneasy.Perhaps it was the worm they had seen  but that was on the other side of the ridge.A head popped up into the con bubble beside Gurney  the factory commander, a one eyed old pirate with full beard, the blue eyes and milky teeth of a space diet.Looks like a rich patch, sir, the factory commander said.Shall I take er in?Come down at the edge of that ridge, Gurney ordered.Let me disembark with my men.You can tractor out to the spice from there.Well have a look at that rock.Aye.In case of trouble, Gurney said, save the factory.Well lift in the thopters.The factory commander saluted.Aye, sir.He popped back down through the hatch.Again Gurney scanned the horizon.He had to respect the possibility that there were Fremen here and he was trespassing.Fremen worried him, their toughness and unpredictability.Many things about this business worried him, but the rewards were great.The fact that he couldnt send spotters high overhead worried him, too.The necessity of radio silence added to his uneasiness.The factory crawler turned, began to descend.Gently it glided down to the dry beach at the foot of the ridge.Treads touched sand.Gurney opened the bubble dome, released his safety straps.The instant the factory stopped, he was out, slamming the bubble closed behind him, scrambling out over the tread guards to swing down to the sand beyond the emergency netting.The five men of his personal guard were out with him, emerging from the nose hatch.Others released the factorys carrier wing.It detached, lifted away to fly in a parking circle low overhead.Immediately the big factory crawler lurched off, swinging away from the ridge toward the dark patch of spice out on the sand.A thopter swooped down near by, skidded to a stop.Another followed and another.They disgorged Gurneys platoon and lifted to hoverflight.Gurney tested his muscles in his stillsuit, stretching.He left the filter mask off his face, losing moisture for the sake of a greater need  the carrying power of his voice if he had to shout commands.He began climbing up into the rocks, checking the terrain  pebbles and pea sand underfoot, the smell of spice.Good site for an emergency base, he thought.Might be sensible to bury a few supplies here.He glanced back, watching his men spread out as they followed him.Good men, even the new ones he hadnt had time to test.Good men.Didnt have to be told every time what to do.Not a shield glimmer showed on any of them.No cowards in this bunch, carrying shields into the desert where a worm could sense the field and come to rob them of the spice they found.From this slight elevation in the rocks, Gurney could see the spice patch about half a kilometer away and the crawler just reaching the near edge.He glanced up at the coverflight, noting the altitude  not too high.He nodded to himself, turned to resume his climb up the ridge.In that instant, the ridge erupted.Twelve roaring paths of flame streaked upward to the hovering thopters and carrier wing.There came a blasting of metal from the factory crawler, and the rocks around Gurney were full of hooded fighting men.Gurney had time to think: By the horns of the Great Mother!Rockets!They dare to use rockets!Then he was face to face with a hooded figure who crouched low, crysknife at the ready.Two more men stood waiting on the rocks above to left and right.Only the eyes of the fighting man ahead of him were visible to Gurney between hood and veil of sand colored burnoose, but the crouch and readiness warned him that here was a trained fighting man.The eyes were the blue in blue of the deep desert Fremen.Gurney moved one hand toward his own knife, kept his eyes fixed on the others knife.If they dared use rockets, theyd have other projectile weapons.This moment argued extreme caution.He could tell by sound alone that at least part of his skycover had been knocked out.There were gruntings, too, the noise of several struggles behind him.The eyes of the fighting man ahead of Gurney followed the motion of hand toward knife, came back to glare into Gurneys eyes.Leave the knife in its sheath, Gurney Halleck, the man said.Gurney hesitated.That voice sounded oddly familiar even through a stillsuit filter.You know my name?he said.Youve no need of a knife with me, Gurney, the man said.He straightened, slipped his crysknife into its sheath back beneath his robe.Tell your men to stop their useless resistance.The man threw his hood back, swung the filter aside.The shock of what he saw froze Gurneys muscles.He thought at first he was looking at a ghost image of Duke Leto Atreides.Full recognition came slowly.Paul, he whispered.Then louder: Is it truly Paul?Dont you trust your own eyes?Paul asked.They said you were dead, Gurney rasped.He took a half step forward.Tell your men to submit, Paul commanded.He waved toward the lower reaches of the ridge.Gurney turned, reluctant to take his eyes off Paul.He saw only a few knots of struggle.Hooded desert men seemed to be everywhere around.The factory crawler lay silent with Fremen standing atop it.There were no aircraft overhead.Stop the fighting, Gurney bellowed.He took a deep breath, cupped his hands for a megaphone.This is Gurney Halleck!Stop the fight!Slowly, warily, the struggling figures separated.Eyes turned toward him, questioning.These are friends, Gurney called.Fine friends!someone shouted back.Half our people murdered.Its a mistake, Gurney said.Dont add to it.He turned back to Paul, stared into the youths blue blue Fremen eyes.A smile touched Pauls mouth, but there was a hardness in the expression that reminded Gurney of the Old Duke, Pauls grandfather.Gurney saw then the sinewy harshness in Paul that had never before been seen in an Atreides  a leathery look to the skin, a squint to the eyes and calculation in the glance that seemed to weigh everything in sight.They said you were dead, Gurney repeated.And it seemed the best protection to let them think so, Paul said.Gurney realized that was all the apology hed ever get for having been abandoned to his own resources, left to believe his young Duke  his friend, was dead.He wondered then if there were anything left here of the boy he had known and trained in the ways of fighting men.Paul took a step closer to Gurney, found that his eyes were smarting.Gurney   It seemed to happen of itself, and they were embracing, pounding each other on the back, feeling the reassurance of solid flesh.You young pup!You young pup!Gurney kept saying.And Paul: Gurney, man!Gurney, man!Presently, they stepped apart, looked at each other.Gurney took a deep breath.So youre why the Fremen have grown so wise in battle tactics.I mightve known.They keep doing things I couldve planned myself.If Id only known  He shook his head.If youd only got word to me, lad.Nothing wouldve stopped me.Id have come arunning and   A look in Pauls eyes stopped him  the hard, weighing stare.Gurney sighed.Sure, and thered have been those who wondered why Gurney Halleck went arunning, and some wouldve done more than question.Theyd have gone hunting for answers.Paul nodded, glanced to the waiting Fremen around them  the looks of curious appraisal on the faces of the Fedaykin.He turned from the death commandos back to Gurney.Finding his former swordmaster filled him with elation.He saw it as a good omen, a sign that he was on the course of the future where all was well.With Gurney at my side   Paul glanced down the ridge past the Fedaykin, studied the smuggler crew who had come with Halleck.How do your men stand, Gurney?he asked.Theyre smugglers all, Gurney said.They stand where the profit is.Little enough profit in our venture, Paul said, and he noted the subtle finger signal flashed to him by Gurneys right hand  the old hand code out of their past.There were men to fear and distrust in the smuggler crew.Paul pulled at his lip to indicate he understood, looked up at the men standing guard above them on the rocks.He saw Stilgar there.Memory of the unsolved problem with Stilgar cooled some of Pauls elation.Stilgar, he said, this is Gurney Halleck of whom youve heard me speak.My fathers master of arms, one of the sword masters who instructed me, an old friend.He can be trusted in any venture.I hear, Stilgar said.You are his Duke.Paul stared at the dark visage above him, wondering at the reasons which had impelled Stilgar to say just that.His Duke.There had been a strange, subtle intonation in Stilgars voice, as though he would rather have said something else.And that wasnt like Stilgar, who was a leader of Fremen, a man who spoke his mind.My Duke!Gurney thought.He looked anew at Paul.Yes, with Leto dead, the title fell on Pauls shoulders.The pattern of the Fremen war on Arrakis began to take on new shape in Gurneys mind.My Duke!A place that had been dead within him began coming alive.Only part of his awareness focused on Pauls ordering the smuggler crew disarmed until they could be questioned.Gurneys mind returned to the command when he heard some of his men protesting.He shook his head, whirled.Are you men deaf?he barked.This is the rightful Duke of Arrakis.Do as he commands.Grumbling, the smugglers submitted.Paul moved up beside Gurney, spoke in a low voice.Id not have expected you to walk into this trap, Gurney.Im properly chastened, Gurney said.Ill wager yon patch of spice is little more than a sand grains thickness, a bait to lure us.Thats a wager youd win, Paul said.He looked down at the men being disarmed.Are there any more of my fathers men among your crew?None.Were spread thin.Therere a few among the free traders.Most have spent their profits to leave this place.But you stayed.I stayed.Because Rabban is here, Paul said.I thought I had nothing left but revenge, Gurney said.An oddly chopped cry sounded from the ridgetop.Gurney looked up to see a Fremen waving his kerchief.A maker comes, Paul said.He moved out to a point of rock with Gurney following, looked off to the southwest.The burrow mound of a worm could be seen in the middle distance, a dust crowned track that cut directly through the dunes on a course toward the ridge.Hes big enough, Paul said.A clattering sound lifted from the factory crawler below them.It turned on its treads like a giant insect, lumbered toward the rocks.Too bad we couldnt have saved the carryall, Paul said.Gurney glanced at him, looked back to the patches of smoke and debris out on the desert where carryall and ornithopters had been brought down by Fremen rockets.He felt a sudden pang for the men lost there  his men, and he said: Your father wouldve been more concerned for the men he couldnt save.Paul shot a hard stare at him, lowered his gaze.Presently, he said: They were your friends, Gurney.I understand.To us, though, they were trespassers who might see things they shouldnt see.You must understand that.I understand it well enough, Gurney said.Now, Im curious to see what I shouldnt.Paul looked up to see the old and well remembered wolfish grin on Hallecks face, the ripple of the inkvine scar along the mans jaw.Gurney nodded toward the desert below them.Fremen were going about their business all over the landscape.It struck him that none of them appeared worried by the approach of the worm.A thumping sounded from the open dunes beyond the baited patch of spice  a deep drumming that seemed to be heard through their feet.Gurney saw Fremen spread out across the sand there in the path of the worm.The worm came on like some great sandfish, cresting the surface, its rings rippling and twisting.In a moment, from his vantage point above the desert, Gurney saw the taking of a worm  the daring leap of the first hookman, the turning of the creature, the way an entire band of men went up the scaly, glistening curve of the worms side.Theres one of the things you shouldnt have seen, Paul said.Thereve been stories and rumors, Gurney said.But its not a thing easy to believe without seeing it.He shook his head.The creature all men on Arrakis fear, you treat it like a riding animal.You heard my father speak of desert power, Paul said.There it is.The surface of this planet is ours.No storm nor creature nor condition can stop us.Us, Gurney thought.He means the Fremen.He speaks of himself as one of them.Again, Gurney looked at the spice blue in Pauls eyes.His own eyes, he knew, had a touch of the color, but smugglers could get offworld foods and there was a subtle caste implication in the tone of the eyes among them.They spoke of the touch of the spicebrush to mean a man had gone too native.And there was always a hint of distrust in the idea.There was a time when we did not ride the maker in the light of day in these latitudes, Paul said.But Rabban has little enough air cover left that he can waste it looking for a few specks in the sand.He looked at Gurney.Your aircraft were a shock to us here.To us  to us   Gurney shook his head to drive out such thoughts.We werent the shock to you that you were to us, he said.Whats the talk of Rabban in the sinks and villages?Paul asked.They say theyve fortified the graben villages to the point where you cannot harm them.They say they need only sit inside their defenses while you wear yourselves out in futile attack.In a word, Paul said, theyre immobilized.While you can go where you will, Gurney said.Its a tactic I learned from you, Paul said.Theyve lost the initiative, which means theyve lost the war.Gurney smiled, a slow, knowing expression.Our enemy is exactly where I want him to be, Paul said.He glanced at Gurney.Well, Gurney, do you enlist with me for the finish of this campaign?Enlist?Gurney stared at him.My Lord, Ive never left your service.Youre the one left me  to think you dead.And I, being cast adrift, made what shrift I could, waiting for the moment I might sell my life for what its worth  the death of Rabban.An embarrassed silence settled over Paul.A woman came climbing up the rocks toward them, her eyes between stillsuit hood and face mask flicking between Paul and his companion.She stopped in front of Paul.Gurney noted the possessive air about her, the way she stood close to Paul.Chani, Paul said, this is Gurney Halleck.Youve heard me speak of him.She looked at Halleck, back to Paul.I have heard.Where did the men go on the maker?Paul asked.They but diverted it to give us time to save the equipment.Well then  Paul broke off, sniffed the air.Theres wind coming, Chani said.A voice called out from the ridgetop above them: Ho, there  the wind!Gurney saw a quickening of motion among the Fremen now  a rushing about and sense of hurry.A thing the worm had not ignited was brought about by fear of the wind.The factory crawler lumbered up onto the dry beach below them and a way was opened for it among the rocks  and the rocks closed behind it so neatly that the passage escaped his eyes.Have you many such hiding places?Gurney asked.Many times many, Paul said.He looked at Chani.Find Korba.Tell him that Gurney has warned me there are men among this smuggler crew whore not to be trusted.She looked once at Gurney, back to Paul, nodded, and was off down the rocks, leaping with a gazelle like agility.She is your woman, Gurney said.The mother of my firstborn, Paul said.Theres another Leto among the Atreides.Gurney accepted this with only a widening of the eyes.Paul watched the action around them with a critical eye.A curry color dominated the southern sky now and there came fitful bursts and gusts of wind that whipped dust around their heads.Seal your suit, Paul said.And he fastened the mask and hood about his face.Gurney obeyed, thankful for the filters.Paul spoke, his voice muffled by the filter: Which of your crew dont you trust, Gurney?Therere some new recruits, Gurney said.Offworlders  He hesitated, wondering at himself suddenly.Offworlders, The word had come so easily to his tongue.Yes?Paul said.Theyre not like the usual fortune hunting lot we get, Gurney said.Theyre tougher.Harkonnen spies?Paul asked.I think, mLord, that they report to no Harkonnen.I suspect theyre men of the Imperial service.They have a hint of Salusa Secundus about them.Paul shot a sharp glance at him.Sardaukar?Gurney shrugged.They could be, but its well masked.Paul nodded, thinking how easily Gurney had fallen back into the pattern of Atreides retainer  but with subtle reservations  differences.Arrakis had changed him, too.Two hooded Fremen emerged from the broken rock below them, began climbing upward.One of them carried a large black bundle over one shoulder.Where are my crew now?Gurney asked.Secure in the rocks below us, Paul said.Weve a cave here  Cave of Birds.Well decide what to do with them after the storm.A voice called from above them: MuadDib!Paul turned at the call, saw a Fremen guard motioning them down to the cave.Paul signaled he had heard.Gurney was studying him with a new expression.Youre MuadDib?he asked.Youre the will o the sand?Its my Fremen name, Paul said.Gurney turned away, feeling an oppressive sense of foreboding.Half his own crew dead on the sand, the others captive.He did not care about the new recruits, the suspicious ones, but among the others were good men, friends, people for whom he felt responsible.Well decide what to do with them after the storm.?Thats what Paul had said, MuadDib had said.And Gurney recalled the stories told of MuadDib, the Lisan al Gaib  how he had taken the skin of a Harkonnen officer to make his drumheads, how he was surrounded by death commandos, Fedaykin who leaped into battle with their death chants on their lips.Him.The two Fremen climbing up the rocks leaped lightly to a shelf in front of Paul.The dark faced one said: All secure, MuadDib.We best get below now.Right.Gurney noted the tone of the mans voice  half command and half request.This was the man called Stilgar, another figure of the new Fremen legends.Paul looked at the bundle the other man carried, said: Korba, whats in the bundle?Stilgar answered: Twas in the crawler.It had the initial of your friend here and it contains a baliset.Many times have I heard you speak of the prowess of Gurney Halleck on the baliset.Gurney studied the speaker, seeing the edge of black beard above the stillsuit mask, the hawk stare, the chiseled nose.Youve a companion who thinks, mLord, Gurney said.Thank you, Stilgar.Stilgar signaled for his companion to pass the bundle to Gurney, said: Thank your Lord Duke.His countenance earns your admittance here.Gurney accepted the bundle, puzzled by the hard undertones in this conversation.There was an air of challenge about the man, and Gurney wondered if it could be a feeling of jealousy in the Fremen.Here was someone called Gurney Halleck whod known Paul even in the times before Arrakis, a man who shared a camaraderie that Stilgar could never invade.You are two Id have be friends, Paul said.Stilgar, the Fremen, is a name of renown, Gurney said.Any killer of Harkonnens Id feel honored to count among my friends.Will you touch hands with my friend Gurney Halleck, Stilgar?Paul asked.Slowly, Stilgar extended his hand, gripped the heavy calluses of Gurneys swordhand.Therere few who havent heard the name of Gurney Halleck, he said, and released his grip.He turned to Paul.The storm comes rushing.At once, Paul said.Stilgar turned away, led them down through the rocks, a twisting and turning path into a shadowed cleft that admitted them to the low entrance of a cave.Men hurried to fasten a doorseal behind them.Glowglobes showed a broad, domeceilinged space with a raised ledge on one side and a passage leading off from it.Paul leaped to the ledge with Gurney right behind him, led the way into the passage.The others headed for another passage opposite the entrance.Paul led the way through an anteroom and into a chamber with dark, wine colored hangings on its walls.We can have some privacy here for a while, Paul said.The others will respect my  An alarm cymbal clanged from the outer chamber, was followed by shouting and clashing of weapons.Paul whirled, ran back through the anteroom and out onto the atrium lip above the outer chamber.Gurney was right behind him, weapon drawn.Beneath them on the floor of the cave swirled a melee of struggling figures.Paul stood an instant assessing the scene, separating the Fremen robes and bourkas from the costumes of those they opposed.Senses that his mother had trained to detect the most subtle clues picked out a significant fact  the Fremen fought against men wearing smuggler robes, but the smugglers were crouched in trios, backed into triangles where pressed.That habit of close fighting was a trademark of the Imperial Sardaukar.A Fedaykin in the crowd saw Paul, and his battlecry was lifted to echo in the chamber: MuadDib!MuadDib!MuadDib!Another eye had also picked Paul out.A black knife came hurtling toward him.Paul dodged, heard the knife clatter against stone behind him, glanced to see Gurney retrieve it.The triangular knots were being pressed back now.Gurney held the knife up in front of Pauls eyes, pointed to the hairline yellow coil of Imperial color, the golden lion crest, multifaceted eyes at the pommel.Sardaukar for certain.Paul stepped out to the lip of the ledge.Only three of the Sardaukar remained.Bloody rag mounds of Sardaukar and Fremen lay in a twisted pattern across the chamber.Hold!Paul shouted.The Duke Paul Atreides commands you to hold!The fighting wavered, hesitated.You Sardaukar!Paul called to the remaining group.By whose orders do you threaten a ruling Duke?And, quickly, as his men started to press in around the Sardaukar: Hold, I say!One of the cornered trio straightened.Who says were Sardaukar?he demanded.Paul took the knife from Gurney, held it aloft.This says youre Sardaukar.Then who says youre a ruling Duke?the man demanded.Paul gestured to the Fedaykin.These men say Im a ruling Duke.Your own emperor bestowed Arrakis on House Atreides.I am House Atreides.The Sardaukar stood silent, fidgeting.Paul studied the man  tall, flat featured, with a pale scar across half his left cheek.Anger and confusion were betrayed in his manner, but still there was that pride about him without which a Sardaukar appeared undressed  and with which he could appear fully clothed though naked.Paul glanced to one of his Fedaykin lieutenants, said: Korba, how came they to have weapons?They held back knives concealed in cunning pockets within their stillsuits, the lieutenant said.Paul surveyed the dead and wounded across the chamber, brought his attention back to the lieutenant.There was no need for words.The lieutenant lowered his eyes.Where is Chani?Paul asked and waited, breath held, for the answer.Stilgar spirited her aside.He nodded toward the other passage, glanced at the dead and wounded.I hold myself responsible for this mistake, MuadDib.How many of these Sardaukar were there, Gurney?Paul asked.Ten.Paul leaped lightly to the floor of the chamber, strode across to stand within striking distance of the Sardaukar spokesman.A tense air came over the Fedaykin.They did not like him thus exposed to danger.This was the thing they were pledged to prevent because the Fremen wished to preserve the wisdom of MuadDib.Without turning, Paul spoke to his lieutenant: How many are our casualties?Four wounded, two dead, MuadDib.Paul saw motion beyond the Sardaukar, Chani and Stilgar were standing in the other passage.He returned his attention to the Sardaukar, staring into the offworld whites of the spokesmans eyes.You, what is your name?Paul demanded.The man stiffened, glanced left and right.Dont try it, Paul said.Its obvious to me that you were ordered to seek out and destroy MuadDib.Ill warrant you were the ones suggested seeking spice in the deep desert.A gasp from Gurney behind him brought a thin smile to Pauls lips.Blood suffused the Sardaukars face.What you see before you is more than MuadDib, Paul said.Seven of you are dead for two of us.Three for one.Pretty good against Sardaukar, eh?The man came up on his toes, sank back as the Fedaykin pressed forward.I asked your name, Paul said, and he called up the subtleties of Voice: Tell me your name!Captain Aramsham, Imperial Sardaukar!the man snapped.His jaw dropped.He stared at Paul in confusion.The manner about him that had dismissed this cavern as a barbarian warren melted away.Well, Captain Aramsham, Paul said, The Harkonnens would pay dearly to learn what you now know.And the Emperor  what he wouldnt give to learn an Atreides still lives despite his treachery.The captain glanced left and right at the two men remaining to him.Paul could almost see the thoughts turning over in the mans head.Sardaukar did not submit, but the Emperor had to learn of this threat.Still using the Voice, Paul said: Submit, Captain.The man at the captains left leaped without warning toward Paul, met the flashing impact of his own captains knife in his chest.The attacker hit the floor in a sodden heap with the knife still in him.The captain faced his sole remaining companion.I decide what best serves His Majesty, he said.Understood?The other Sardaukars shoulders slumped.Drop your weapon, the captain said.The Sardaukar obeyed.The captain returned his attention to Paul.I have killed a friend for you, he said.Let us always remember that.Youre my prisoners, Paul said.You submitted to me.Whether you live or die is of no importance.He motioned to his guard to take the two Sardaukar, signaled the lieutenant who had searched the prisoners.The guard moved in, hustled the Sardaukar away.Paul bent toward his lieutenant.MuadDib, the man said, I failed you in   The failure was mine, Korba, Paul said.I shouldve warned you what to seek.In the future, when searching Sardaukar, remember this.Remember, too, that each has a false toenail or two that can be combined with other items secreted about their bodies to make an effective transmitter.Theyll have more than one false tooth.They carry coils of shigawire in their hair  so fine you can barely detect it, yet strong enough to garrotte a man and cut off his head in the process.With Sardaukar, you must scan them, scope them  both reflex and hard ray  cut off every scrap of body hair.And when youre through, be certain you havent discovered everything.He looked up at Gurney, who had moved close to listen.Then we best kill them, the lieutenant said.Paul shook his head, still looking at Gurney.No.I want them to escape.Gurney stared at him.Sire he breathed.Yes?Your man here is right.Kill those prisoners at once.Destroy all evidence of them.Youve shamed Imperial Sardaukar!When the Emperor learns that hell not rest until he has you over a slow fire.The Emperors not likely to have that power over me, Paul said.He spoke slowly, coldly.Something had happened inside him while he faced the Sardaukar.A sum of decisions had accumulated in his awareness.Gurney, he said, are there many Guildsmen around Rabban?Gurney straightened, eyes narrowed.Your question makes no   Are there?Paul barked.Arrakis is crawling with Guild agents.Theyre buying spice as though it were the most precious thing in the universe.Why else do you think we ventured this far into   It is the most precious thing in the universe, Paul said.To them.He looked toward Stilgar and Chani who now were crossing the chamber toward him.And we control it, Gurney.The Harkonnens control it!Gurney protested.The people who can destroy a thing, they control it, Paul said.He waved a hand to silence further remarks from Gurney, nodded to Stilgar who stopped in front of Paul, Chani beside him.Paul took the Sardaukar knife in his left hand, presented it to Stilgar.You live for the good of the tribe, Paul said.Could you draw my lifes blood with that knife?For the good of the tribe, Stilgar growled.Then use that knife, Paul said.Are you calling me out?Stilgar demanded.If I do, Paul said, I shall stand there without weapon and let you slay me.Stilgar drew in a quick, sharp breath.Chani said, Usul!then glanced at Gurney, back to Paul.While Stilgar was still weighing his words, Paul said: You are Stilgar, a fighting man.When the Sardaukar began fighting here, you were not in the front of battle.Your first thought was to protect Chani.Shes my niece, Stilgar said.If thered been any doubt of your Fedaykin handling those scum   Why was your first thought of Chani?Paul demanded.It wasnt!Oh?It was of you, Stilgar admitted.Do you think you could lift your hand against me?Paul asked.Stilgar began to tremble.Its the way, he muttered.Its the way to kill offworld strangers found in the desert and take their water as a gift from Shai hulud, Paul said.Yet you permitted two such to live one night, my mother and myself.As Stilgar remained silent, trembling, staring at him, Paul said: Ways change, Stil.You have changed them yourself.Stilgar looked down at the yellow emblem on the knife he held.When I am Duke on Arrakeen with Chani by my side, do you think Ill have time to concern myself with every detail of governing Sietch Tabr?Paul asked.Do you concern yourself with the internal problems of every family?Stilgar continued staring at the knife.Do you think I wish to cut off my right arm?Paul demanded.Slowly, Stilgar looked up at him.You!Paul said.Do you think I wish to deprive myself or the tribe of your wisdom and strength?In a low voice, Stilgar said: The young man of my tribe whose name is known to me, this young man I could kill on the challenge floor, Shai hulud willing.The Lisan al Gaib, him I could not harm.You knew this when you handed me this knife.I knew it, Paul agreed.Stilgar opened his hand.The knife clattered against the stone of the floor.Ways change, he said.Chani, Paul said, go to my mother, send her here that her counsel will be available in  But you said we would go to the south!she protested.I was wrong, he said.The Harkonnens are not there.The war is not there.She took a deep breath, accepting this as a desert woman accepted all necessities in the midst of a life involved with death.You will give my mother a message for her ears alone, Paul said.Tell her that Stilgar acknowledges me Duke of Arrakis, but a way must be found to make the young men accept this without combat.Chani glanced at Stilgar.Do as he says, Stilgar growled.We both know he could overcome me  and I could not raise my hand against him  for the good of the tribe.I shall return with your mother, Chani said.Send her, Paul said.Stilgars instinct was right.I am stronger when you are safe.You will remain in the sietch.She started to protest, swallowed it.Sihaya, Paul said, using his intimate name for her.He whirled away to the right, met Gurneys glaring eyes.The interchange between Paul and the older Fremen had passed as though in a cloud around Gurney since Pauls reference to his mother.Your mother, Gurney said.Idaho saved us the night of the raid, Paul said, distracted by the parting with Chani.Right now weve  What of Duncan Idaho, mLord?Gurney asked.Hes dead  buying us a bit of time to escape.The she witch alive!Gurney thought.The one I swore vengeance against, alive!And its obvious Duke Paul doesnt know what manner of creature gave him birth.The evil one!Betrayed his own father to the Harkonnens!Paul pressed past him, jumped up to the ledge.He glanced back, noted that the wounded and dead had been removed, and he thought bitterly that here was another chapter in the legend of Paul MuadDib.I didnt even draw my knife, but itll be said of this day I slew twenty Sardaukar by my own hand.Gurney followed with Stilgar, stepping on ground that he did not even feel.The cavern with its yellow light of glowglobes was forced out of his thoughts by rage.The she witch alive while those she betrayed are bones in lonesome graves.I must contrive it that Paul learns the truth about her before I slay her.How often it is that the angry man rages denial of what his inner self is telling him.The Collected Sayings of MuadDib by the Princess Irulan     The crowd in the cavern assembly chamber radiated that pack feeling Jessica had sensed the day Paul killed Jamis.There was murmuring nervousness in the voices.Little cliques gathered like knots among the robes.Jessica tucked a message cylinder beneath her robe as she emerged to the ledge from Pauls private quarters.She felt rested after the long journey up from the south, but it still rankled that Paul would not yet permit them to use the captured ornithopters.We do not have full control of the air, he had said.And we must not become dependent upon offworld fuel.Both fuel and aircraft must be gathered and saved for the day of maximum effort.Paul stood with a group of the younger men near the ledge.The pale light of glowglobes gave the scene a tinge of unreality.It was like a tableau, but with the added dimension of warren smells, the whispers, the sounds of shuffling feet.She studied her son, wondering why he had not yet trotted out his surprise  Gurney Halleck.Thought of Gurney disturbed her with its memories of an easier past  days of love and beauty with Pauls father.Stilgar waited with a small group of his own at the other end of the ledge.There was a feeling of inevitable dignity about him, the way he stood without talking.We must not lose that man, Jessica thought.Pauls plan must work.Anything else would be highest tragedy.She strode down the ledge, passing Stilgar without a glance, stepped down into the crowd.A way was made for her as she headed toward Paul.And silence followed her.She knew the meaning of the silence  the unspoken questions of the people, awe of the Reverend Mother.The young men drew back from Paul as she came up to him, and she found herself momentarily dismayed by the new deference they paid him.All men beneath your position covet your station, went the Bene Gesserit axiom.But she found no covetousness in these faces.They were held at a distance by the religious ferment around Pauls leadership.And she recalled another Bene Gesserit saying: Prophets have a way of dying by violence.Paul looked at her.Its time, she said, and passed the message cylinder to him.One of Pauls companions, bolder than the others, glanced across at Stilgar, said: Are you going to call him out, MuadDib?Nows the time for sure.Theyll think you a coward if you  Who dares call me coward?Paul demanded.His hand flashed to his crysknife hilt.Bated silence came over the group, spreading out into the crowd.Theres work to do, Paul said as the man drew back from him.Paul turned away, shouldered through the crowd to the ledge, leaped lightly up to it and faced the people.Do it!someone shrieked.Murmurs and whispers arose behind the shriek.Paul waited for silence.It came slowly amidst scattered shufflings and coughs.When it was quiet in the cavern, Paul lifted his chin, spoke in a voice that carried to the farthest corners.You are tired of waiting, Paul said.Again, he waited while the cries of response died out.Indeed, they are tired of waiting, Paul thought.He hefted the message cylinder, thinking of what it contained.His mother had showed it to him, explaining how it had been taken from a Harkonnen courier.The message was explicit: Rabban was being abandoned to his own resources here on Arrakis!He could not call for help or reinforcements!Again, Paul raised his voice: You think its time I called out Stilgar and changed the leadership of the troops!Before they could respond, Paul hurled his voice at them in anger: Do you think the Lisan al Gaib that stupid?There was stunned silence.Hes accepting the religious mantle, Jessica thought.He must not do it!Its the way!someone shouted.Paul spoke dryly, probing the emotional undercurrents.Ways change.An angry voice lifted from a corner of the cavern: Well say whats to change!There were scattered shouts of agreement through the throng.As you wish, Paul said.And Jessica heard the subtle intonations as he used the powers of Voice she had taught him.You will say, he agreed.But first you will hear my say.Stilgar moved along the ledge, his bearded face impassive.That is the way, too, he said.The voice of any Fremen may be heard in Council.Paul MuadDib is a Fremen.The good of the tribe, that is the most important thing, eh?Paul asked.Still with that flat voiced dignity, Stilgar said: Thus our steps are guided.All right, Paul said.Then, who rules this troop of our tribe  and who rules all the tribes and troops through the fighting instructors weve trained in the weirding way?Paul waited, looking over the heads of the throng.No answer came.Presently, he said: Does Stilgar rule all this?He says himself that he does not.Do I rule?Even Stilgar does my bidding on occasion, and the sages, the wisest of the wise, listen to me and honor me in Council.There was shuffling silence among the crowd.So, Paul said.Does my mother rule?He pointed down to Jessica in her black robes of office among them.Stilgar and all the other troop leaders ask her advice in almost every major decision.You know this.But does a Reverend Mother walk the sand or lead a razzia against the Harkonnens?Frowns creased the foreheads of those Paul could see, but still there were angry murmurs.This is a dangerous way to do it, Jessica thought, but she remembered the message cylinder and what it implied.And she saw Pauls intent: Go right to the depth of their uncertainty, dispose of that, and all the rest must follow.No man recognizes leadership without the challenge and the combat, eh?Paul asked.Thats the way!someone shouted.Whats our goal?Paul asked.To unseat Rabban, the Harkonnen beast, and remake our world into a place where we may raise our families in happiness amidst an abundance of water  is this our goal?Hard tasks need hard ways, someone shouted.Do you smash your knife before a battle?Paul demanded.I say this as fact, not meaning it as boast or challenge: there isnt a man here, Stilgar included, who could stand against me in single combat.This is Stilgars own admission.He knows it, so do you all.Again, the angry mutters lifted from the crowd.Many of you have been with me on the practice floor, Paul said.You know this isnt idle boast.I say it because its fact known to us all, and Id be foolish not to see it for myself.I began training in these ways earlier than you did and my teachers were tougher than any youve ever seen.How else do you think I bested Jamis at an age when your boys are still fighting only mock battles?Hes using the Voice well, Jessica thought, but thats not enough with these people.Theyve good insulation against vocal control.He must catch them also with logic.So, Paul said, we come to this.He lifted the message cylinder, removed its scrap of tape.This was taken from a Harkonnen courier.Its authenticity is beyond question.It is addressed to Rabban.It tells him that his request for new troops is denied, that his spice harvest is far below quota, that he must wring more spice from Arrakis with the people he has.Stilgar moved up beside Paul.How many of you see what this means?Paul asked.Stilgar saw it immediately.Theyre cut off!someone shouted.Paul pushed message and cylinder into his sash.From his neck he took a braided shigawire cord and removed a ring from the cord, holding the ring aloft.This was my fathers ducal signet, he said.I swore never to wear it again until I was ready to lead my troops over all of Arrakis and claim it as my rightful fief.He put the ring on his finger, clenched his fist.Utter stillness gripped the cavern.Who rules here?Paul asked.He raised his fist.I rule here!I rule on every square inch of Arrakis!This is my ducal fief whether the Emperor says yea or nay!He gave it to my father and it comes to me through my father!Paul lifted himself onto his toes, settled back to his heels.He studied the crowd, feeling their temper.Almost, he thought.There are men here who will hold positions of importance on Arrakis when I claim those Imperial rights which are mine, Paul said.Stilgar is one of those men.Not because I wish to bribe him!Not out of gratitude, though Im one of many here who owe him life for life.No!But because hes wise and strong.Because he governs this troop by his own intelligence and not just by rules.Do you think me stupid?Do you think Ill cut off my right arm and leave it bloody on the floor of this cavern just to provide you with a circus?Paul swept a hard gaze across the throng.Who is there here to say Im not the rightful ruler on Arrakis?Must I prove it by leaving every Fremen tribe in the erg without a leader?Beside Paul, Stilgar stirred, looked at him questioningly.Will I subtract from our strength when we need it most?Paul asked.I am your ruler, and I say to you that it is time we stopped killing off our best men and started killing our real enemies  the Harkonnens!In one blurred motion, Stilgar had his crysknife out and pointed over the heads of the throng.Long live Duke Paul MuadDib!he shouted.A deafening roar filled the cavern, echoed and re echoed.They were cheering and chanting: Ya hya chouhada!MuadDib!MuadDib!MuadDib!Ya hya chouhada!Jessica translated it to herself: Long live the fighters of MuadDib!The scene she and Paul and Stilgar had cooked up between them had worked as theyd planned.The tumult died slowly.When silence was restored, Paul faced Stilgar, said: Kneel, Stilgar.Stilgar dropped to his knees on the ledge.Hand me your crysknife, Paul said.Stilgar obeyed.This was not as we planned it, Jessica thought.Repeat after me, Stilgar, Paul said, and he called up the words of investiture as he had heard his own father use them.I, Stilgar, take this knife from the hands of my Duke.I, Stilgar, take this knife from the hands of my Duke, Stilgar said, and accepted the milky blade from Paul.Where my Duke commands, there shall I place this blade, Paul said.Stilgar repeated the words, speaking slowly and solemnly.Remembering the source of the rite, Jessica blinked back tears, shook her head.I know the reasons for this, she thought.I shouldnt let it stir me.I dedicate this blade to the cause of my Duke and the death of his enemies for as long as our blood shall flow, Paul said.Stilgar repeated it after him.Kiss the blade, Paul ordered.Stilgar obeyed, then, in the Fremen manner, kissed Pauls knife arm.At a nod from Paul, he sheathed the blade, got to his feet.A sighing whisper of awe passed through the crowd, and Jessica heard the words: The prophecy  A Bene Gesserit shall show the way and a Reverend Mother shall see it.And, from farther away: She shows us through her son!Stilgar leads this tribe, Paul said.Let no man mistake that.He commands with my voice.What he tells you, it is as though I told you.Wise, Jessica thought.The tribal commander must lose no face among those who should obey him.Paul lowered his voice, said: Stilgar, I want sandwalkers out this night and cielagos sent to summon a Council Gathering.When youve sent them, bring Chatt, Korba and Otheym and two other lieutenants of your own choosing.Bring them to my quarters for battle planning.We must have a victory to show the Council of Leaders when they arrive.Paul nodded for his mother to accompany him, led the way down off the ledge and through the throng toward the central passage and the living chambers that had been prepared there.As Paul pressed through the crowd, hands reached out to touch him.Voices called out to him.My knife goes where Stilgar commands it, Paul MuadDib!Let us fight soon, Paul MuadDib!Let us wet our world with the blood of Harkonnens!Feeling the emotions of the throng, Jessica sensed the fighting edge of these people.They could not be more ready.We are taking them at the crest, she thought.In the inner chamber, Paul motioned his mother to be seated, said: Wait here.And he ducked through the hangings to the side passage.It was quiet in the chamber after Paul had gone, so quiet behind the hangings that not even the faint soughing of the wind pumps that circulated air in the sietch penetrated to where she sat.He is going to bring Gurney Halleck here, she thought.And she wondered at the strange mingling of emotions that filled her.Gurney and his music had been a part of so many pleasant times on Caladan before the move to Arrakis.She felt that Caladan had happened to some other person.In the nearly three years since then, she had become another person.Having to confront Gurney forced a reassessment of the changes.Pauls coffee service, the fluted alloy of silver and jasmium that he had inherited from Jamis, rested on a low table to her right.She stared at it, thinking of how many hands had touched that metal.Chani had served Paul from it within the month.What can his desert woman do for a Duke except serve him coffee?she asked herself.She brings him no power, no family.Paul has only one major chance  to ally himself with a powerful Great House, perhaps even with the Imperial family.There are marriagable princesses, after all, and every one of them Bene Gesserit trained.Jessica imagined herself leaving the rigors of Arrakis for the life of power and security she could know as mother of a royal consort.She glanced at the thick hangings that obscured the rock of this cavern cell, thinking of how she had come here  riding amidst a host of worms, the palanquins and pack platforms piled high with necessities for the coming campaign.As long as Chani lives, Paul will not see his duty, Jessica thought.She has given him a son and that is enough.A sudden longing to see her grandson, the child whose likeness carried so much of the grandfathers features  so like Leto, swept through her.Jessica placed her palms against her cheeks, began the ritual breathing that stilled emotion and clarified the mind, then bent forward from the waist in the devotional exercise that prepared the body for the minds demands.Pauls choice of this Cave of Birds as his command post could not be questioned, she knew.It was ideal.And to the north lay Wind Pass opening onto a protected village in a cliff walled sink.It was a key village, home of artisans and technicians, maintenance center for an entire Harkonnen defensive sector.A cough sounded outside the chamber hangings.Jessica straightened, took a deep breath, exhaled slowly.Enter, she said.Draperies were flung aside and Gurney Halleck bounded into the room.She had only time for a glimpse of his face with its odd grimace, then he was behind her, lifting her to her feet with one brawny arm beneath her chin.Gurney, you fool, what are you doing?she demanded.Then she felt the touch of the knife tip against her back.Chill awareness spread out from that knife tip.She knew in that instant that Gurney meant to kill her.Why?She could think of no reason, for he wasnt the kind to turn traitor.But she felt certain of his intention.Knowing it, her mind churned.Here was no man to be overcome easily.Here was a killer wary of the Voice, wary of every combat stratagem, wary of every trick of death and violence.Here was an instrument she herself had helped train with subtle hints and suggestions.You thought you had escaped, eh, witch?Gurney snarled.Before she could turn the question over in her mind or try to answer, the curtains parted and Paul entered.Here he is, Moth Paul broke off, taking in the tensions of the scene.You will stand where you are, mLord, Gurney said.What  Paul shook his head.Jessica started to speak, felt the arm tighten against her throat.You will speak only when I permit it, witch, Gurney said.I want only one thing from you for your son to hear it, and I am prepared to send this knife into your heart by reflex at the first sign of a counter against me.Your voice will remain in a monotone.Certain muscles you will not tense or move.You will act with the most extreme caution to gain yourself a few more seconds of life.And I assure you, these are all you have.Paul took a step forward, Gurney, man, what is  Stop right where you are!Gurney snapped.One more step and shes dead.Pauls hand slipped to his knife hilt.He spoke in deadly quiet: You had best explain yourself, Gurney.I swore an oath to slay the betrayer of your father, Gurney said.Do you think I can forget the man who rescued me from a Harkonnen slave pit, gave me freedom, life, and honor  and gave friendship, a thing I prized above all else.I have his betrayer under my knife.No one can stop me from  You couldnt be more wrong, Gurney, Paul said.And Jessica thought: So thats it!What irony!Wrong, am I?Gurney demanded.Let us hear it from the woman herself.And let her remember that I have bribed and spied and cheated to confirm this charge.Ive even pushed semuta on a Harkonnen guard captain to get part of the story.Jessica felt the arm at her throat ease slightly, but before she could speak, Paul said: The betrayer was Yueh.I tell you this once, Gurney.The evidence is complete, cannot be controverted.It was Yueh.I do not care how you came by your suspicion  for it can be nothing else  but if you harm my mother  Paul lifted his crysknife from its scabbard, held the blade in front of him.Ill have your blood.Yueh was a conditioned medic, fit for a royal house, Gurney snarled.He could not turn traitor!I know a way to remove that conditioning, Paul said.Evidence, Gurney insisted.The evidence is not here, Paul said.Its in Tabr sietch, far to the south, but if  This is a trick, Gurney snarled, and his arm tightened on Jessicas throat.No trick, Gurney, Paul said, and his voice carried such a note of terrible sadness that the sound tore at Jessicas heart.I saw the message captured from the Harkonnen agent, Gurney said.The note pointed directly at  I saw it, too, Paul said.My father showed it to me the night he explained why it had to be a Harkonnen trick aimed at making him suspect the woman he loved.Ayah!Gurney said.Youve not  Be quiet, Paul said, and the monotone stillness of his words carried more command than Jessica had ever heard in another voice.He has the Great Control, she thought.Gurneys arm trembled against her neck.The point of the knife at her back moved with uncertainty.What you have not done, Paul said, is heard my mother sobbing in the night over her lost Duke.You have not seen her eyes stab flame when she speaks of killing Harkonnens.So he has listened, she thought.Tears blinded her eyes.What you have not done, Paul went on, is remembered the lessons you learned in a Harkonnen slave pit.You speak of pride in my fathers friendship!Didnt you learn the difference between Harkonnen and Atreides so that you could smell a Harkonnen trick by the stink they left on it?Didnt you learn that Atreides loyalty is bought with love while the Harkonnen coin is hate?Couldnt you see through to the very nature of this betrayal?But Yueh?Gurney muttered.The evidence we have is Yuehs own message to us admitting his treachery, Paul said.I swear this to you by the love I hold for you, a love I will still hold even after I leave you dead on this floor.Hearing her son, Jessica marveled at the awareness in him, the penetrating insight of his intelligence.My father had an instinct for his friends, Paul said.He gave his love sparingly, but with never an error.His weakness lay in misunderstanding hatred.He thought anyone who hated Harkonnens could not betray him.He glanced at his mother.She knows this.Ive given her my fathers message that he never distrusted her.Jessica felt herself losing control, bit at her lower lip.Seeing the stiff formality in Paul, she realized what these words were costing him.She wanted to run to him, cradle his head against her breast as she never had done.But the arm against her throat had ceased its trembling; the knife point at her back pressed still and sharp.One of the most terrible moments in a boys life, Paul said,  is when he discovers his father and mother are human beings who share a love that he can never quite taste.Its a loss, an awakening to the fact that the world is there and here and we are in it alone.The moment carries its own truth; you cant evade it.I heard my father when he spoke of my mother.Shes not the betrayer, Gurney.Jessica found her voice, said: Gurney, release me.There was no special command in the words, no trick to play on his weaknesses, but Gurneys hand fell away.She crossed to Paul, stood in front of him, not touching him.Paul, she said, there are other awakenings in this universe.I suddenly see how Ive used you and twisted you and manipulated you to set you on a course of my choosing  a course I had to choose  if thats any excuse  because of my own training.She swallowed past a lump in her throat, looked up into her sons eyes.Paul  I want you to do something for me: choose the course of happiness.Your desert woman, marry her if thats your wish.Defy everyone and everything to do this.But choose your own course.I   She broke off, stopped by the low sound of muttering behind her.Gurney!She saw Pauls eyes directed beyond her, turned.Gurney stood in the same spot, but had sheathed his knife, pulled the robe away from his breast to expose the slick grayness of an issue stillsuit, the type the smugglers traded for among the sietch warrens.Put your knife right here in my breast, Gurney muttered.I say kill me and have done with it.Ive besmirched my name.Ive betrayed my own Duke!The finest  Be still!Paul said.Gurney stared at him.Close that robe and stop acting like a fool, Paul said.Ive had enough foolishness for one day.Kill me, I say!Gurney raged.You know me better than that, Paul said.How many kinds of an idiot do you think I am?Must I go through this with every man I need?Gurney looked at Jessica, spoke in a forlorn, pleading note so unlike him: Then you, my Lady, please  you kill me.Jessica crossed to him, put her hands on his shoulders.Gurney, why do you insist the Atreides must kill those they love?Gently, she pulled the spread robe out of his fingers, closed and fastened the fabric over his chest.Gurney spoke brokenly: But  I   You thought you were doing a thing for Leto, she said, and for this I honor you.My Lady, Gurney said.He dropped his chin to his chest, squeezed his eyelids closed against the tears.Let us think of this as a misunderstanding among old friends, she said, and Paul heard the soothers, the adjusting tones in her voice.Its over and we can be thankful well never again have that sort of misunderstanding between us.Gurney opened eyes bright with moisture, looked down at her.The Gurney Halleck I knew was a man adept with both blade and baliset, Jessica said.It was the man of the baliset I most admired.Doesnt that Gurney Halleck remember how I used to enjoy listening by the hour while he played for me?Do you still have a baliset, Gurney?Ive a new one, Gurney said.Brought from Chusuk, a sweet instrument.Plays like a genuine Varota, though theres no signature on it.I think myself it was made by a student of Varotas who  He broke off.What can I say to you, my Lady?Here we prattle about  Not prattle, Gurney, Paul said.He crossed to stand beside his mother, eye to eye with Gurney.Not prattle, but a thing that brings happiness between friends.Id take it a kindness if youd play for her now.Battle planning can wait a little while.Well not be going into the fight till tomorrow at any rate.I  Ill get my baliset, Gurney said.Its in the passage.He stepped around them and through the hangings.Paul put a hand on his mothers arm, found that she was trembling.Its over, Mother, he said.Without turning her head, she looked up at him from the corners of her eyes.Over?Of course.Gurneys   Gurney?Oh  yes.She lowered her gaze.The hangings rustled as Gurney returned with his baliset.He began tuning it, avoiding their eyes.The hangings on the walls dulled the echoes, making the instrument sound small and intimate.Paul led his mother to a cushion, seated her there with her back to the thick draperies of the wall.He was suddenly struck by how old she seemed to him with the beginnings of desert dried lines in her face, the stretching at the corners of her blue veiled eyes.Shes tired, he thought.We must find some way to ease her burdens.Gurney strummed a chord.Paul glanced at him, said: Ive  things that need my attention.Wait here for me.Gurney nodded.His mind seemed far away, as though he dwelled for this moment beneath the open skies of Caladan with cloud fleece on the horizon promising rain.Paul forced himself to turn away, let himself out through the heavy hangings over the side passage.He heard Gurney take up a tune behind him, and paused a moment outside the room to listen to the muted music.Orchards and vineyards,  And full breasted houris,  And a cup overflowing before me.Why do I babble of battles,  And mountains reduced to dust?Why do I feel these tears?Heavens stand open  And scatter their riches;  My hands need but gather their wealth.Why do I think of an ambush,  And poison in molten cup?Why do I feel my years?Loves arms beckon  With their naked delights,  And Edens promise of ecstasies.Why do I remember the scars,  Dream of old transgressions   And why do I sleep with fears?A robed Fedaykin courier appeared from a corner of the passage ahead of Paul.The man had hood thrown back and fastenings of his stillsuit hanging loose about his neck, proof that he had come just now from the open desert.Paul motioned for him to stop, left the hangings of the door and moved down the passage to the courier.The man bowed, hands clasped in front of him the way he might greet a Reverend Mother or sayyadina of the rites.He said: MuadDib, leaders are beginning to arrive for the Council.So soon?These are the ones Stilgar sent for earlier when it was thought  He shrugged.I see.Paul glanced back toward the faint sound of the baliset, thinking of the old song that his mother favored  an odd stretching of happy tune and sad words.Stilgar will come here soon with others.Show them where my mother waits.I will wait here, MuadDib, the courier said.Yes  yes, do that.Paul pressed past the man toward the depths of the cavern, headed for the place that each such cavern had  a place near its water holding basin.There would be a small shai hulud in this place, a creature no more than nine meters long, kept stunted and trapped by surrounding water ditches.The maker, after emerging from its little maker vector, avoided water for the poison it was.And the drowning of a maker was the greatest Fremen secret because it produced the substance of their union  the Water of Life, the poison that could only be changed by a Reverend Mother.The decision had come to Paul while he faced the tension of danger to his mother.No line of the future he had ever seen carried that moment of peril from Gurney Halleck.The future  the gray cloud future  with its feeling that the entire universe rolled toward a boiling nexus hung around him like a phantom world.I must see it, he thought.His body had slowly acquired a certain spice tolerance that made prescient visions fewer and fewer  dimmer and dimmer.The solution appeared obvious to him.I will drown the maker.We will see now whether Im the Kwisatz Haderach who can survive the test that the Reverend Mothers have survived.And it came to pass in the third year of the Desert War that Paul MuadDib lay alone in the Cave of Birds beneath the kiswa hangings of an inner cell.And he lay as one dead, caught up in the revelation of the Water of Life, his being translated beyond the boundaries of time by the poison that gives life.Thus was the prophecy made true that the Lisan al Gaib might be both dead and alive.Collected Legends of Arrakis by the Princess Irulan    Chani came up out of the Habbanya basin in the predawn darkness, hearing the thopter that had brought her from the south go whir whirring off to a hiding place in the vastness.Around her, the escort kept its distance, fanning out into the rocks of the ridge to probe for dangers  and giving the mate of MuadDib, the mother of his firstborn, the thing she had requested: a moment to walk alone.Why did he summon me?she asked herself.He told me before that I must remain in the south with little Leto and Alia.She gathered her robe and leaped lightly up across a barrier rock and onto the climbing path that only the desert trained could recognize in the darkness.Pebbles slithered underfoot and she danced across them without considering the nimbleness required.The climb was exhilarating, easing the fears that had fermented in her because of her escorts silent withdrawal and the fact that a precious thopter had been sent for her.She felt the inner leaping at the nearness of reunion with Paul MuadDib, her Usul.His name might be a battle cry over all the land: MuadDib!MuadDib!MuadDib!But she knew a different man by a different name  the father of her son, the tender lover.A great figure loomed out of the rocks above her, beckoning for speed.She quickened her pace.Dawn birds already were calling and lifting into the sky.A dim spread of light grew across the eastern horizon.The figure above was not one of her own escort.Otheym?she wondered, marking a familiarity of movement and manner.She came up to him, recognized in the growing light the broad, flat features of the Fedaykin lieutenant, his hood open and mouth filter loosely fastened the way one did sometimes when venturing out onto the desert for only a moment.Hurry, he hissed, and led her down the secret crevasse into the hidden cave.It will be light soon, he whispered as he held a doorseal open for her.The Harkonnens have been making desperation patrols over some of this region.We dare not chance discovery now.They emerged into the narrow side passage entrance to the Cave of Birds.Glowglobes came alight.Otheym pressed past her, said: Follow me.Quickly, now.They sped down the passage, through another valve door, another passage and through hangings into what had been the Sayyadinas alcove in the days when this was an overday rest cave.Rugs and cushions now covered the floor.Woven hangings with the red figure of a hawk hid the rock walls.A low field desk at one side was strewn with papers from which lifted the aroma of their spice origin.The Reverend Mother sat alone directly opposite the entrance.She looked up with the inward stare that made the uninitiated tremble.Otheym pressed palms together, said: I have brought Chani.He bowed, retreated through the hangings.And Jessica thought: How do I tell Chani?How is my grandson?Jessica asked.So its to be the ritual greeting, Chani thought, and her fears returned.Where is MuadDib?Why isnt he here to greet me?He is healthy and happy, my mother, Chani said.I left him with Alia in the care of Harah.My mother, Jessica thought.Yes, she has the right to call me that in the formal greeting.She has given me a grandson.I hear a gift of cloth has been sent from Coanua sietch, Jessica said.It is lovely cloth, Chani said.Does Alia send a message?No message.But the sietch moves more smoothly now that the people are beginning to accept the miracle of her status.Why does she drag this out so?Chani wondered.Something was so urgent that they sent a thopter for me.Now, we drag through the formalities!We must have some of the new cloth cut into garments for little Leto,Jessica said.Whatever you wish, my mother, Chani said.She lowered her gaze.Is there news of battles?She held her face expressionless that Jessica might not see the betrayal  that this was a question about Paul MuadDib.New victories,Jessica said.Rabban has sent cautious overtures about a truce.His messengers have been returned without their water.Rabban has even lightened the burdens of the people in some of the sink villages.But he is too late.The people know he does it out of fear of us.Thus it goes as MuadDib said, Chani said.She stared at Jessica, trying to keep her fears to herself.I have spoken his name, but she has not responded.One cannot see emotion in that glazed stone she calls a face  but she is too frozen.Why is she so still?What has happened to my Usul?I wish we were in the south,Jessica said.The oases were so beautiful when we left.Do you not long for the day when the whole land may blossom thus?The land is beautiful, true, Chani said.But there is much grief in it.Grief is the price of victory,Jessica said.Is she preparing me for grief?Chani asked herself.She said: There are so many women without men.There was jealousy when it was learned that Id been summoned north.I summoned you,Jessica said.Chani felt her heart hammering.She wanted to clap her hands to her ears, fearful of what they might hear.Still, she kept her voice even: The message was signed MuadDib.I signed it thus in the presence of his lieutenants,Jessica said.It was a subterfuge of necessity.And Jessica thought: This is a brave woman, my Pauls.She holds to the niceties even when fear is almost overwhelming her.Yes.She may be the one we need now.Only the slightest tone of resignation crept into Chanis voice as she said: Now you may say the thing that must be said.You were needed here to help me revive Paul, Jessica said.And she thought: There!I said it in the precisely correct way.Revive.Thus she knows Paul is alive and knows there is peril, all in the same word.Chani took only a moment to calm herself, then: What is it I may do?She wanted to leap at Jessica, shake her and scream: Take me to him!But she waited silently for the answer.I suspect,Jessica said, that the Harkonnens have managed to send an agent among us to poison Paul.Its the only explanation that seems to fit.A most unusual poison.Ive examined his blood in the most subtle ways without detecting it.Chani thrust herself forward onto her knees.Poison?Is he in pain?Could I   He is unconscious,Jessica said.The processes of his life are so low that they can be detected only with the most refined techniques.I shudder to think what could have happened had I not been the one to discover him.He appears dead to the untrained eye.You have reasons other than courtesy for summoning me, Chani said.I know you, Reverend Mother.What is it you think I may do that you cannot do?
