Sematimba said.All trace of jocularity had vanished from his expression.He was all cop now.Anyone but Miller would have found the mans empty, almost angry face intimidating.The war, Miller said.Sematimba folded his arms.Bad joke, he said.Not joking.I consider us friends, old man, Sematimba said.But I dont want any trouble around here.Things are unsettled as it stands.Ill try to stay low profile.Sematimba nodded.Down the tunnel, an alarm blared.Only security, not the earsplitting ditone of an environmental alert.Sematimba looked down the tunnel as if squinting would let him see through the press of people, bicycles, and food carts.Id better go look, he said with an air of resignation.Probably some of my fellow officers of the peace breaking windows for the fun of it.Great to be part of a team like that, Miller said.How would you know?Sematimba said with a smile.If you need something   Likewise, Miller said, and watched the cop wade into the sea of chaos and humanity.He was a large man, but something about the passing crowds universal deafness to the alarms blare made him seem smaller.A stone in the ocean, the phrase went.One star among millions.Miller checked the time, then pulled up the public docking records.The Rocinante showed as on schedule.The docking berth was listed.Miller sucked down the last of his noodles, tossed the foam cone with the thin smear of black sauce into a public recycler, found the nearest mens room, and when he was done there, trotted toward the casino level.The architecture of Eros had changed since its birth.Where once it had been like Ceres webworked tunnels leading along the path of widest connection Eros had learned from the flow of money: All paths led to the casino level.If you wanted to go anywhere, you passed through the wide whale belly of lights and displays.Poker, blackjack, roulette, tall fish tanks filled with prize trout to be caught and gutted, mechanical slots, electronic slots, cricket races, craps, rigged tests of skill.Flashing lights, dancing neon clowns, and video screen advertisements blasted the eyes.Loud artificial laughter and merry whistles and bells assured you that you were having the time of your life.All while the smell of thousands of people packed into too small a space competed with the scent of heavily spiced vat grown meat being hawked from carts rolling down the corridor.Greed and casino design had turned Eros into an architectural cattle run.Which was exactly what Miller needed.The tube station that arrived from the port had six wide doors, which emptied to the casino floor.Miller accepted a drink from a tired looking woman in a G string and bared breasts and found a screen to stand at that afforded him a view of all six doors.The crew of the Rocinante had no choice but to come through one of those.He checked his hand terminal.The docking logs showed the ship had arrived ten minutes earlier.Miller pretended to sip his drink and settled in to wait.The casino level of Eros was an all out assault on the senses.Holden hated it.I love this place, Amos said, grinning.Holden pushed his way through a knot of drunk middle aged gamblers, who were laughing and yelling, to a small open space near a row of pay by the minute wall terminals.Amos, he said, well be going to a less touristy level, so watch our backs.The flophouse were looking for is in a rough neighborhood.Amos nodded.Gotcha, Cap.While Naomi, Alex, and Amos blocked him from view, Holden reached behind his back to adjust the pistol that pulled uncomfortably on his waistband.The cops on Eros were pretty uptight about people walking around with guns, but there was no way he was going to Lionel Polanski unarmed.Amos and Alex were both carrying too, though Amos kept his in the right pocket of his jacket and his hand never left it.Only Naomi flatly refused to carry a gun.Holden led the group toward the nearest escalators, with Amos, casting the occasional glance behind, in the rear.The casinos of Eros stretched for three seemingly endless levels, and even though they moved as quickly as possible, it took half an hour to get away from the noise and crowds.The first level above was a residential neighborhood and disorientingly quiet and neat after the casinos chaos and noise.Holden sat down on the edge of a planter with a nice array of ferns in it and caught his breath.Im with you, Captain.Five minutes in that place gives me a headache, Naomi said, and sat down next to him.You kidding me?Amos said.I wish we had more time.Alex and I took almost a grand off those fish at the Tycho card tables.Wed probably walk out of here fucking millionaires.You know it, Alex said, and punched the big mechanic on the shoulder.Well, if this Polanski thing turns out to be nothing, you have my permission to go make us a million dollars at the card tables.Ill wait for you on the ship, Holden said.The tube system ended at the first casino level and didnt start again until the level they were on.You could choose not to spend your money at the tables, but they made sure you were punished for doing so.Once the crew had climbed into a car and started the ride to Lionels hotel, Amos sat down next to Holden.Somebodys following us, Cap, he said conversationally.Wasnt sure till he climbed on a couple cars down.Behind us all through the casinos too.Holden sighed and put his face in his hands.Okay, whats he look like?he said.Belter.Fifties, or maybe forties with a lot mileage.White shirt and dark pants.Goofy hat.Cop?Oh yeah.But no holster I can see, Amos said.All right.Keep an eye on him, but no need to get too worried.Nothing were doing here is illegal, Holden said.You mean, other than arriving in our stolen Martian warship, sir?Naomi asked.You mean our perfectly legitimate gas freighter that all the paperwork and registry data says is perfectly legitimate?Holden replied with a thin smile.Yeah, well, if theyd seen through that, they would have stopped us at the dock, not followed us around.An advertising screen on the wall displayed a stunning view of multicolored clouds rippling with flashes of lightning, and encouraged Holden to take a trip to the amazing dome resorts on Titan.Hed never been to Titan.Suddenly he wanted to go there very much.A few weeks of sleeping late, eating in fine restaurants, and lying on a hammock, watching Titans colorful atmosphere storm above him sounded like heaven.Hell, as long as he was fantasizing, he threw in Naomi walking over to his hammock with a couple of fruity looking drinks in her hands.She ruined it by talking.This is our stop, she said.Amos, watch our friend, see if he gets off the train with us, Holden said as he got up and headed to the door.After they got off and walked a dozen steps down the corridor, Amos whispered, Yep, at his back.Shit.Well, definitely a tail, but there wasnt really any reason not to go ahead and check up on Lionel.Fred hadnt asked them to do anything with whoever was pretending to be the Scopulis owner.They couldnt very well be arrested for knocking on a door.Holden whistled a loud and jaunty tune as he walked, to let his crew and whoever was following them know he wasnt worried about a thing.He stopped when he saw the flophouse.It was dark and dingy and exactly the sort of place where people got mugged or worse.Broken lights created dark corners, and there wasnt a tourist in sight.He turned to give Alex and Amos meaningful looks, and Amos shifted his hand in his pocket.Alex reached under his coat.The lobby was mostly empty space, with a pair of couches at one end next to a table covered with magazines.A sleepy looking older woman sat reading one.Elevators were recessed into the wall at the far end, next to a door marked STAIRS.In the middle was the check in desk, where, in lieu of a human clerk, a touch screen terminal let guests pay for their rooms.Holden stopped next to the desk and turned around to look at the woman sitting on the couch.Graying hair, but good features and an athletic build.In a flophouse like this, that probably meant a prostitute reaching the end of her shelf life.She pointedly ignored his stare.Is our tail still with us?Holden asked in a quiet voice.Stopped outside somewhere.Probably just watching the door now, Amos replied.Holden nodded and hit the inquiry button on the check in screen.A simple menu would let him send a message to Lionel Polanskis room, but Holden exited the system.They knew Lionel was still checked in, and Fred had given them the room number.If it was someone playing games, no reason to give him a heads up before Holden knocked on the door.Okay, hes still here, so lets  Holden said, and then stopped when he saw the woman from the couch standing right behind Alex.He hadnt heard or seen her approach.You need to come with me, she said in a hard voice.Walk to the stairwell slowly, stay at least three meters ahead of me the entire time.Do it now.Are you a cop?Holden asked, not moving.Im the person with the gun, she said, a small weapon appearing like magic in her right hand.She pointed it at Alexs head.So do what I say.Her weapon was small and plastic and had some kind of battery pack.Amos pulled his heavy slug thrower out and aimed it at her face.Mines bigger, he said.Amos, dont  was all Naomi had time to say before the stairwell door burst open and half a dozen men and women armed with compact automatic weapons came into the room, yelling at them to drop their guns.Holden started to put his hands up when one of them opened fire, the weapon coughing out rounds so fast it sounded like someone ripping construction paper; it was impossible to hear the separate shots.Amos threw himself to the floor.A line of bullet holes stitched across the chest of the woman with the taser, and she fell backward with a soft, final sound.Holden grabbed Naomi by one hand and dragged her behind the check in desk.Someone in the other group was yelling, Cease fire!Cease fire!but Amos was already shooting back from his position, prone on the floor.A yelp of pain and a curse told Holden hed probably hit someone.Amos rolled sideways to the desk, just in time to avoid a hail of slugs that tore up the floor and wall and made the desk shudder.Holden reached for his gun, but the front sight caught in his waistband.He yanked it out, tearing his underwear, then crawled on his knees to the edge of the desk and looked out.Alex was lying on the floor on the other side of one of the couches, gun drawn and face white.As Holden looked, a burst of gunfire hit the couch, blowing stuffing into the air and making a line of holes in the back of the couch not more than twenty centimeters above Alexs head.The pilot reached his pistol around the corner of the couch and blindly fired off half a dozen shots, yelling at the same time.Fucking assholes!Amos yelled, then rolled out and fired a couple more shots and rolled back before the return fire started.Where are they?Holden yelled at him.Two are down, the rest in the stairwell!Amos yelled back over the sound of return fire.Out of nowhere a burst of rounds bounced off the floor past Holdens knee.Shit, someones flanking us!Amos cried out, then moved farther behind the desk and away from the shots.Holden crawled to the other side of the desk and peeked out.Someone was moving low and fast toward the hotel entrance.Holden leaned out and took a couple shots at him, but three guns opened up from the stairwell doorway and forced him back behind the desk.Alex, someones moving to the entrance!Holden screamed at the top of his lungs, hoping the pilot might be able to get off a shot before they were all chopped to pieces by crossfire.A pistol barked three times by the entrance.Holden risked a look.Their tail with the goofy hat crouched by the door, a gun in his hand, the machine gun toting flanker lying still at his feet.Instead of looking at them, the tail was pointing his gun toward the stairwell.No one shoot the guy with the hat!Holden yelled, then moved back to the edge of the desk.Amos put his back to the desk and popped the magazine from his gun.As he fumbled around in his pocket for another, he said, Guy is probably a cop.Extra especially do not shoot any cops, Holden said, then fired a few shots at the stairwell door.Naomi, whod spent the entire gunfight so far on the floor with her arms over her head, said, They might all be cops.Holden squeezed off a few more shots and shook his head.Cops dont carry small, easily concealable machine guns and ambush people from stairwells.We call those death squads, he said, though most of his words were drowned out by a barrage of gunfire from the stairwell.Afterward came a few seconds of silence.Holden leaned back out in time to see the door swing shut.I think theyre bugging out, he said, keeping his gun trained on the door anyway.Must have another exit somewhere.Amos, keep your eye on that door.If it opens, start shooting.He patted Naomi on the shoulder.Stay down.Holden rose from behind the now ruined check in kiosk.The desk facade had splintered and the underlying stone showed through.Holden held his gun barrel up, his hands open.The man in the hat stood, considering the corpse at his feet, then looked up as Holden came near.Thanks.My name is Jim Holden.You are?The man didnt speak for a second.When he did, his voice was calm.Almost weary.Cops will be here soon.I need to make a call or were all going to jail.Arent you the cops?Holden asked.The other man laughed; it was a bitter, short sound, but with some real humor behind it.Apparently Holden had said something funny.Nope.Names Miller.Miller looked at the dead man the man hed just killed and tried to feel something.There was the trailing adrenaline rush still ramping up his heartbeat.There was a sense of surprise that came from walking into an unexpected firefight.Past that, though, his mind had already fallen into the long habit of analysis.One plant in the main room so Holden and his crew wouldnt see anything too threatening.A bunch of trigger happy yahoos in the stairwell to back her up.That had gone well.It was a slapdash effort.The ambush had been set by people who either didnt know what they were doing or didnt have the time or resources to do it right.If it hadnt been improvised, Holden and his three buddies would have been taken or killed.And him along with them.The four survivors of the Canterbury stood in the remains of the firefight like rookies at their first bust.Miller felt his mind shift back half a step as he watched everything without watching anything in particular.Holden was smaller than hed expected from the video feeds.It shouldnt have been surprising; he was an Earther.The man had the kind of face that was bad at hiding things.Thanks.My name is Jim Holden.You are?Miller thought of six different answers and turned them all aside.One of the others a big man, solid, with a bare scalp was pacing out the room, his eyes unfocused the same way Millers were.Of Holdens four, that was the only guy whod seen serious gunplay before.The cops will be here soon, Miller said.I need to make a call or were all going to jail.The other man thinner, taller, East Indian by the look of him had been hiding behind a couch.He was sitting on his haunches now, his eyes wide and panicky.Holden had some of the same look, but he was doing a better job of keeping control.The burdens, Miller thought, of leadership.Arent you the cops?Miller laughed.Nope, he said.Names Miller.Okay, the woman said.Those people just tried to kill us.Why did they do that?Holden took a half step toward her voice even before he turned to look at her.Her face was flushed, full lips pressed thin and pale.Her features showed a far flung racial mix that was unusual even in the melting pot of the Belt.Her hands werent shaking.The big one had the most experience, but Miller put the woman down as having the best instincts.Yeah, Miller said.I noticed.He pulled out his hand terminal and opened a link to Sematimba.The cop accepted a few seconds later.Semi, Miller said.Im really sorry about this, but you know how I was going stay low profile?Yes?the local cop said, drawing the word out to three syllables.Didnt work out.I was heading to a meeting with a friend   A meeting with a friend, Sematimba echoed.Miller could imagine the mans crossed arms even thought they didnt show in the frame.And I happened to see a bunch of tourists in the wrong place at the wrong time.It got out of hand.Where are you?Sematimba asked.Miller gave him the station level and address.There was a long pause while Sematimba consulted with some internal communication software that would have been part of Millers tool set once.The mans sigh was percussive.I dont see anything.Were there shots fired?Miller looked at the chaos and ruin around them.About a thousand different alerts should have gone out with the first weapon fired.Security should have been swarming toward them.A few, he said.Strange, Sematimba said.Stay put.Ill be there.Will do, Miller said, and dropped the connection.Okay, Holden said.Who was that?The real cops, Miller said.Theyll be here soon.Itll be fine.I think itll be fine.It occurred to him that he was treating the situation like he was still on the inside, a part of the machine.That wasnt true anymore, and pretending it was might have consequences.He was following us, the woman said to Holden.And then, to Miller, she said, You were following us.I was, Miller said.He didnt think he sounded rueful, but the big guy shook his head.It was the hat, the big one said.Stood out some.Miller swept off his porkpie and considered it.Of course the big one had been the one to make him.The other three were competent amateurs, and Miller knew that Holden had done some time in the UN Navy.But Miller gave it better than even money that the big ones background check would be interesting reading.Why were you following us?Holden asked.I mean, I appreciate the part where you shot the people who were shooting at us, but Id still like to know that first part.I wanted to talk to you, Miller said.Im looking for someone.There was a pause.Holden smiled.Anyone in particular?he asked.A crew member of the Scopuli, Miller said.The Scopuli?Holden said.He started to glance at the woman and stopped himself.There was something there.The Scopuli meant something to him beyond what Miller had seen on the news.There was nobody on her when we got there, the woman said.Holy shit, the shaky one behind the couch said.It was the first thing hed said since the firefight ended, and he repeated it five or six more times in quick succession.What about you?Miller asked.Donnager blew you to Tycho, and now here.Whats that about?How did you know that?Holden said.Its my job, Miller said.Well, it used to be.The answer didnt appear to satisfy the Earther.The big guy had fallen in behind Holden, his face a friendly cipher: No trouble, unless there was trouble, and then maybe a whole lot of trouble.Miller nodded, half to the big guy, half to himself.I had a contact in the OPA who told me you didnt die on the Donnager, Miller said.They just told you that?the woman asked, banked outrage in her voice.He was making a point at the time, Miller said.Anyway, he said it, and I took it from there.And in about ten minutes, Im going to make sure Eros security doesnt throw all of you in a hole, and me with you.So if theres anything at all you want to tell me like what youre doing here, for instance this would be the right time.The silence was broken only by the sound of recyclers laboring to clear the smoke and particulate dust of gunfire.The shaky one stood.Something about the way he held himself looked military.Ex something, Miller assumed, but not a ground pounder.Navy, maybe; Martian at a guess.He had the vocal twang some of them affected.Ah, fuck it, Capn, the big one said.He shot the flank guy for us.He may be an asshole, but hes okay by me.Thank you, Amos, Holden said.Miller filed that.The big one was Amos.Holden put his hands behind his back, returning his gun to his waistband.Were here to look for someone too, he said.Probably someone from the Scopuli.We were just double checking the room when everyone decided to start shooting at us.Here?Miller said.Something like emotion trickled into his veins.Not hope, but dread.Someone off the Scopuli is in this flop right now?We think so, Holden said.Miller looked out the flophouse lobbys front doors.A small, curious crowd had started to gather in the tunnel.Crossed arms, nervous glances.He knew how they felt.Sematimba and his police were on the way.The gunmen whod attacked Holden and his crew werent mounting another attack, but that didnt mean they were gone.There might be another wave.They could have fallen back to a better position to wait for Holden to advance.But what if Julie was here right now?How could he come this far and stop in the lobby?To his surprise, he still had his gun drawn.That was unprofessional.He should have holstered it.The only other one still drawn was the Martians.Miller shook his head.Sloppy.He needed to stop that.Still, he had more than half a magazine left in the pistol.What room?he asked.* * *   The flophouse corridors were thin and cramped.The walls had the impervious gloss of warehouse paint, and the carpet was carbon silicate weave that would wear out more slowly than bare stone.Miller and Holden went first, then the woman and the Martian Naomi and Alex, their names were then Amos, trailing and looking back over his shoulder.Miller wondered if anyone but he and Amos understood how they were keeping the others safe.Holden seemed to know and be irritated by it; he kept edging ahead.The doors of the rooms were identical fiberglass laminates, thin enough to be churned out by the thousand.Miller had kicked in a hundred like them in his career.A few here and there were decorated by longtime residents with a painting of improbably red flowers, a whiteboard with a string where a pen had once been attached, a cheap reproduction of an obscene cartoon acting out its punch line in a dimly glowing infinite loop.Tactically, it was a nightmare.If the ambushing forces stepped out of doors in front of and behind them, all five could be slaughtered in seconds.But no slugs flew, and the only door that opened disgorged an emaciated, long bearded man with imperfect eyes and a slack mouth.Miller nodded at the man as they passed, and he nodded back, possibly more surprised by someones acknowledging his presence than by the drawn pistols.Holden stopped.This is it, he murmured.This is the room.Miller nodded.The others came up in a clump, Amos casually hanging back, his eyes on the corridor retreating behind them.Miller considered the door.It would be easy to kick in.One strong blow just above the latch mechanism.Then he could go in low and to the left, Amos high and to the right.He wished Havelock were there.Tactics were simpler for people whod trained together.He motioned Amos to come up close.Holden knocked on the door.What are you?Miller whispered fiercely, but Holden ignored him.Hello?Holden called.Anyone there?Miller tensed.Nothing happened.No voice, no gunfire.Nothing.Holden seemed perfectly at ease with the risk hed just taken.From the expression on Naomis face, Miller took it this wasnt the first time hed done things this way.You want that open?Amos said.Kinda do, Miller said at the same moment Holden said, Yeah, kick it down.Amos looked from one to the other, not moving until Holden nodded at him.Then Amos shifted past them, kicked the door open in one blow, and staggered back, cussing.You okay?Miller asked.The big man nodded once through a pale grimace.Yeah, busted my leg a while back.Cast just came off.Keep forgetting about that, he said.Miller turned back to the room.Inside, it was as black as a cave.No lights came on, not even the dim glow of monitors and sensory devices.Miller stepped in, pistol drawn.Holden was close behind him.The floor made the crunching sound of gravel under their feet, and there was an odd astringent smell that Miller associated with broken screens.Behind it was another smell, much less pleasant.He chose not to think about that one.Hello?Miller said.Anyone here?Turn on the lights, Naomi said from behind them.Miller heard Holden patting the wall panel, but no light came up.Theyre not working, Holden said.The dim spill from the corridor gave almost nothing.Miller kept his gun steady in his right hand, ready to empty it toward muzzle flash if anyone opened fire from the darkness.With his left, he took out his hand terminal, thumbed on the backlight, and opened a blank white writing tablet.The room came into monochrome.Beside him, Holden did the same.A thin bed pressed against one wall, a narrow tray beside it.The bedding was knotted like the remnant of a bad nights sleep.A closet stood open, empty.The hulking form of an empty vacuum suit lay on the floor like a mannequin with a misplaced head.An old entertainment console hung on the wall across from the cot, its screen shattered by half a dozen blows.The wall was dimpled where blows intended to bread the LED sconces had missed.Another hand terminal added its glow, and another.Hints of color started to come into the room the cheap gold of the walls, the green of the blankets and sheet.Under the cot, something glimmered.An older model hand terminal.Miller crouched as the others stepped in.Shit, Amos said.Okay, Holden said.Nobody touches anything.Period.Nothing.It was the most sensible thing Miller had heard the man say.Someone put up a bitch of a fight, Amos muttered.No, Miller said.It had been vandalism, maybe.It hadnt been a struggle.He pulled a thin film evidence bag out of his pocket and turned it inside out over his hand like a glove before picking up the terminal, flipping the plastic over it, and setting off the sealing charge.Is that blood?Naomi asked, pointing to the cheap foam mattress.Wet streaks pooled on the sheet and pillow, not more than a fingers width, but dark.Too dark even for blood.No, Miller said, shoving the terminal into his pocket.The fluid marked a thin path toward the bathroom.Miller raised a hand, pushing the others back as he crept toward the half open door.Inside the bathroom, the nasty background smell was much stronger.Something deep, organic, and intimate.Manure in a hothouse, or the aftermath of sex, or a slaughterhouse.All of them.The toilet was brushed steel, the same model they used in prisons.The sink matched.The LED above it and the one in the ceiling had both been destroyed.In the light of his terminal, like the glow of a single candle, black tendrils reached from the shower stall toward the ruined lights, bent and branching like skeletal leaves.In the shower stall, Juliette Andromeda Mao lay dead.Her eyes were closed, and that was a mercy.Shed cut her hair differently since shed taken the pictures Miller had seen, and it changed the shape of her face, but she was unmistakable.She was nude, and barely human.Coils of complex growth spilled from her mouth, ears, and vulva.Her ribs and spine had grown spurs like knives that stretched pale skin, ready to cut themselves free of her.Tubes stretched from her back and throat, crawling up the walls behind her.A deep brown slush had leaked from her, filling the shower pan almost three centimeters high.He sat silently, willing the thing before him not to be true, trying to force himself awake.What did they do to you?he thought.Oh, kid.What did they do?Ohmygod, Naomi said behind him.Dont touch anything, he said.Get out of the room.Into the hall.Do it now.The light in the next room faded as the hand terminals retreated.The twisting shadows momentarily gave her body the illusion of movement.Miller waited, but no breath lifted the bent rib cage.No flicker touched her eyelids.There was nothing.He rose, carefully checking his cuffs and shoes, and walked out to the corridor.Theyd all seen it.He could tell from the expressions, theyd all seen.And they didnt know any better than he did what it was.Gently, he pulled the splintered door closed and waited for Sematimba.It wasnt long.Five men in police riot armor with shotguns made their way down the hall.Miller walked forward to meet them, his posture better than a badge.He could see them relax.Sematimba came up behind them.Miller?he said.The hell is this?I thought you said you were staying put.I didnt leave, he said.Those are the civilians back there.The dead guys downstairs jumped them in the lobby.Why?Sematimba demanded.Who knows?Miller said.Roll them for spare change.Thats not the problem.Sematimbas eyebrows rose.Ive got four corpses down there, and theyre not the problem.Miller nodded down the corridor.Fifth ones up here, he said.Its the girl I was looking for.Sematimbas expression softened.Im sorry, he said.Nah, Miller said.He couldnt accept sympathy.He couldnt accept comfort.A gentle touch would shatter him, so he stayed hard instead.But youre going to want the coroner on this one.Its bad, then?Youve got no idea, Miller said.Listen, Semi.Im in over my head here.Seriously.Those boys down there with the guns?If they werent hooked in with your security force, there would have been alarms as soon as the first shot was fired.You know this was a setup.They were waiting for these four.And the squat fella with the dark hair?Thats James Holden.Hes not even supposed to be alive.Holden that started the war?Sematimba said.Thats the one, Miller said.This is deep.Drowning deep.And you know what they say about going in after a drowning man, right?Sematimba looked down the corridor.He nodded.Let me help you, Sematimba said, but Miller shook his head.Im too far gone.Forget me.What happened was you got a call.You found the place.You dont know me, you dont know them, youve got no clue what happened.Or you come along and drown with me.Your pick.You dont leave the station without telling me?Okay, Miller said.I can live with that, Sematimba said.Then, a moment later: Thats really Holden?Call the coroner, Miller said.Trust me.Miller gestured at Holden and headed for the elevator without waiting to see if he was following.The presumption irritated him, but he went anyway.So, Holden said, we were just in a gunfight where we killed at least three people, and now were just leaving?No getting questioned or giving a statement?How exactly does that happen?Holden asked.Professional courtesy, Miller said, and Holden couldnt tell if he was joking.The elevator door opened with a muffled ding, and Holden and the others followed Miller inside.Naomi was closest to the panel, so she reached out to press the lobby button, but her hand was shaking so badly that she had to stop and clench it into a fist.After a deep breath, she reached out a now steady finger and pressed the button.This is bullshit.Being an ex cop doesnt give you a license to get in gunfights, Holden said to Millers back.Miller didnt move, but he seemed to shrink a little bit.His sigh was heavy and unforced.His skin seemed grayer than before.Sematimba knows the score.Half the job is knowing when to look the other way.Besides, I promised we wouldnt leave the station without letting him know.Fuck that, Amos said.You dont make promises for us, pal.The elevator came to a stop and opened onto the bloody scene of the gunfight.A dozen cops were in the room.Miller nodded at them and they nodded back.He led the crew out of the lobby to the corridor, then turned around.We can work that out later, Miller said.Right now, lets get someplace we can talk.Holden agreed with a shrug.Okay, but youre paying.Miller headed off down the corridor toward the tube station.As they followed, Naomi put a hand on Holdens arm and slowed him down a bit so that Miller could get ahead.When he was far enough away, she said, He knew her.Who knew who?He, Naomi said, nodding at Miller, knew her.She jerked her head back toward the crime scene behind them.How do you know?Holden said.He wasnt expecting to find her there, but he knew who she was.Seeing her like that was a shock.Huh, I didnt get that at all.Hes seemed like Mr.Cool all through this.No, they were friends or something.Hes having trouble dealing with it, so maybe dont push him too hard, she said.We might need him.* * *   The hotel room Miller got was only slightly better than the one theyd found the body in.Alex immediately headed for the bathroom and locked the door.The sound of water running in the sink wasnt quite loud enough to cover the pilots retching.Holden plopped down on the small beds dingy comforter, forcing Miller to take the rooms one uncomfortable looking chair.Naomi sat next to Holden on the bed, but Amos stayed on his feet, prowling around the room like a nervous animal.So, talk, Holden said to Miller.Lets wait for the rest of the gang to finish up, Miller replied with a nod toward the bathroom.Alex came out a few moments later, his face still white, but now freshly washed.Are you all right, Alex?Naomi asked in a soft voice.Five by five, XO, Alex said, then sat down on the floor and put his head in his hands.Holden stared at Miller and waited.The older man sat and played with his hat for a minute, then tossed it onto the cheap plastic desk that cantilevered out from the wall.You knew Julie was in that room.How?Miller said.We didnt even know her name was Julie, Holden replied.We just knew that it was someone from the Scopuli.You should tell me how you knew that, Miller said, a frightening intensity in his eyes.Holden paused a moment.Miller had killed someone who had been trying to kill them, and that certainly helped make the case that he was a friend, but Holden wasnt about to sell out Fred and his group on a hunch.He hesitated, then went halfway.The fictional owner of the Scopuli had checked into that flophouse, he said.It made sense that it was a member of the crew raising a flag.Miller nodded.Who told you?he said.Im not comfortable telling you that.We believed the information was accurate, Holden replied.The Scopuli was the bait that someone used to kill the Canterbury.We thought someone from the Scopuli might know why everyone keeps trying to kill us.Miller said, Shit, and then leaned back in his chair and stared at the ceiling.Youve been looking for Julie.Youd hoped we were looking for her too.That we knew something, Naomi said, not making it a question.Yeah, Miller said.It was Holdens turn to ask why.Parents sent a contract to Ceres looking for her to be sent home.It was my case, Miller said.So you work for Ceres security?Not anymore.So what are you doing here?Holden asked.Her family was connected to something, Miller replied.I just naturally hate a mystery.And how did you know it was bigger than just a missing girl?Talking to Miller felt like digging through granite with a rubber chisel.Miller grinned humorlessly.They fired me for looking too hard.Holden consciously decided not to be annoyed by Millers non answer.So lets talk about the death squad in the hotel.Yeah, seriously, what the fuck?Amos said, finally pausing in his pacing.Alex took his head out of his hands and looked up with interest for the first time.Even Naomi leaned forward on the edge of the bed.No idea, Miller replied.But someone knew you were coming.Yeah, thanks for the brilliant police work, Amos said with a snort.No way we woulda figured that out on our own.Holden ignored him.But they didnt know why, or they would have already gone up to Julies room and gotten whatever they wanted.Does that mean Freds been compromised?Naomi said.Fred?Miller asked.Or maybe someone figured out the Polanski thing too, but didnt have a room number, Holden said.But why come out guns blazing like that?Amos said.Doesnt make any sense to shoot us.That was a mistake, Miller said.I saw it happen.Amos here drew his gun.Somebody overreacted.They were yelling cease fire right up until you folks started shooting back.Holden began ticking off points on his fingers.So someone finds out were headed to Eros, and that it is related to the Scopuli.They even know the hotel, but not the room.They dont know its Lionel Polanski either, Naomi said.They could have looked it up at the desk, just like we did.Right.So they wait for us to show, and have a squad of gunmen ready to take us in.But that goes to shit and it turns into a gunfight in the lobby.They absolutely dont see you coming, Detective, so they arent omniscient.Right, Miller said.The whole thing screams last minute.Grab you guys and find out what youre looking for.If theyd had more time, they could have just searched the hotel.Might have taken two or three days, but it could have been done.They didnt, so that means grabbing you was easier.Holden nodded.Yes, he said.But that means that they already had teams here.Those didnt seem like locals to me.Miller paused, looking disconcerted.Now you say it, me either, he agreed.So whoever it is, they already have teams of gunmen on Eros, and they can redeploy them to come at a moments notice to pick us up, Holden said.And enough pull with security that they could have a firefight and nobody came, Miller said.Police didnt know anything was happening until I called them.Holden cocked his head to one side, then said, Shit, we really need to get out of here.Wait a minute, Alex said loudly.Just wait a goddamn minute here.How come no one is talkin about the mutant horror show in that room?Was I the only one that saw that?Yeah, Jesus, what was that all about?Amos said quietly.Miller reached into his coat pocket and took out the evidence bag with Julies hand terminal in it.Any of you guys a techie?he asked.Maybe we could find out.I could probably hack it, Naomi said.But theres no way Im touching that thing until we know what did that to her and that it isnt catching.Im not pushing my luck by handling anything shes touched.You dont have to touch it.Keep the bag sealed.Just use it right through the plastic.The touch screen should still work.Naomi paused for a second, then reached out and took the bag.Okay, give me a minute, she said, then set to work on it.Miller leaned back in his chair again, letting out another heavy sigh.So, Holden said.Did you know Julie before this?Naomi seems to think finding her dead like that really knocked you for a loop.Miller shook his head slowly.You get a case like that, you look into whoever it is.You know, personal stuff.Read their e mail.Talk to the people they know.You get a picture.Miller stopped talking and rubbed his eyes with his thumbs.Holden didnt push him, but he started talking again anyway.Julie was a good kid, Miller said as if he were confessing something.She flew a mean racing ship.I just I wanted to get her back alive.Its got a password, Naomi said, holding up the terminal.I could hack the hardware, but Id have to open the case.Miller reached out and said, Let me give it a try.Naomi handed the terminal to him, and he tapped a few characters on the screen and handed it back.Razorback, Naomi said.Whats that?Its a sled, Miller replied.Is he talking to us?Amos said, pointing his chin at Miller.Cause theres no one else here, but I swear half the time I dont know what the fuck hes on about.Sorry, Miller said.Ive been working more or less solo.Makes for bad habits.Naomi shrugged and went back to work with Holden and Miller now looking over her shoulders.Shes got a lot of stuff on here, Naomi said.Where to start?Miller pointed at a text file simply labeled notes sitting on the terminals desktop.Start there, he said.Shes a fanatic about putting things in the right folders.If she left that on the desktop, it means she wasnt sure where it went.Naomi tapped on the document to open it up.It expanded into a loosely organized collection of text that read like someones diary.First off, get your shit together.Panic doesnt help.It never helps.Deep breaths, figure this out, make the right moves.fear is the mind killer.Ha.Geek.Shuttle Pros:  No reactor, just batteries.V.  low radiation.Supplies for eight  Lots of reaction mass   Shuttle Cons:  No Epstein, no torch  Comm not just disabled, but physically removed (feeling a little paranoid about leaks, guys?)Closest transit is Eros.Is that where we were going?Maybe go someplace else?On just teakettle, this is gonna be a slow boat.Another transit adds seven more weeks.Eros, then.Ive got the Phoebe bug, no way around it.Not sure how, but that brown shit was everywhere.Its anaerobic, must have touched some.Doesnt matter how, just work the problem.I just slept for THREE WEEKS.Didnt even get up to pee.What does that?Im so fucked.Things you need to remember:   * BA834024112   * Radiation kills.No reactor on this shuttle, but keep the lights off.Keep the e suit on.Video asshat said this thing eats radiation.Dont feed it.* Send up a flag.Get some help.You work for the smartest people in the system.Theyll figure something out.* Stay away from people.Dont spread the bug.Not coughing up the brown goo yet.No idea when that starts.* Keep away from bad guys as if you know who they are.Fine.So keep away from everyone.Incognito is my name.Hmm.Polanski?Damn.I can feel it.Im hot all the time, and Im starving.Dont eat.Dont feed it.Feed a cold, starve a flu?Other way around?Eros is a day out, and then help is on the way.Keep fighting.Safe on Eros.Sent up the flag.Hope the home office is watching.Head hurts.Somethings happening on my back.Lump over my kidneys.Darren turned into goo.Am I going to be a suit full of jelly?Sick now.Things coming out of my back and leaking that brown stuff everywhere.Have to take the suit off.If you read this, dont let anyone touch the Brown stuff.Burn me.Im burning up.Naomi put the terminal down, but no one spoke for a moment.Finally, Holden said, Phoebe bug.Anyone have an idea?There was a science station on Phoebe, Miller said.Inner planets place, no Belters allowed.It got hit.Lots of dead people, but   She talks about being on a shuttle, Naomi said.The Scopuli didnt have a shuttle.There had to be another ship, Alex said.Maybe she got the shuttle off it.Right, Holden said.They got on another ship, they got infected with this Phoebe bug, and the rest of the crew I dont know.Dies?She gets out, not realizing shes infected till shes on the shuttle, Naomi continued.She comes here, she sends up the flag to Fred, and she dies in that hotel room of the infection.Not, however, turned to goo, Holden said.Just really badly I dont know.Those tubes and bone spurs.What kind of disease does that?The question hung in the air.Again no one spoke.Holden knew they were all thinking the same thing.They hadnt touched anything in the flophouse room.Did that mean they were safe from it?Or did they have the Phoebe bug, whatever the hell it was?But shed said anaerobic.Holden was pretty sure that meant you couldnt get it by breathing it in the air.Pretty sure  Where do we go from here, Jim?Naomi asked.How about Venus?Holden said, his voice higher and tighter than hed expected.Nothing interesting happening on Venus.Seriously, Naomi said.Okay.Seriously, I think Miller there lets his cop friend know the story, and then we get the hell off of this rock.Its got to be a bioweapon, right?Someone steals it off a Martian science lab, seeds this shit in a dome, a month later every human being in the city is dead.Amos interrupted with a grunt.Theres some holes in that, Capn, Amos said.Like what the fuck does that have to do with taking down the Cant and the Donnager?Holden looked Naomi in the eye and said, We have a place to look now, dont we?Yeah, we do, she said.BA834024112.Thats a rock designation.What do you think is out there?Alex asked.If I was a betting man, Id say its whatever ship she stole that shuttle from, Holden replied.Makes sense, Naomi said.Every rock in the Belt is mapped.You want to hide something, put it in a stable orbit next to one and you can always find it later.Miller turned toward Holden, his face even more drawn.If youre going there, I want in, he said.Why?Holden asked.No offense, but you found your girl.Your jobs over, right?Miller looked at him, his lips a thin line.Different case, Miller said.Now its about who killed her.Your police friend put a lockdown order on my ship, Holden said.He sounded outraged.Around them, the hotel restaurant was busy.Last shifts prostitutes mixed with the next shifts tourists and businessmen at the cheap pink lit buffet.The pilot and the big guy Alex and Amos were vying for the last bagel.Naomi sat at Holdens side, her arms crossed, a cup of bad coffee cooling before her.We did kill some people, Miller said gently.I thought you got us out of that with your secret police handshake, Holden said.So whys my ship in lockdown?You remember when Sematimba said we shouldnt leave the station without telling him?Miller said.I remember you making some kind of deal, Holden said.I dont remember agreeing to it.Look, hes going to keep us here until hes sure he wont get fired for letting us go.Once he knows his ass is covered, the lock goes down.So lets talk about the part where I rent a berth on your ship.Jim Holden and his XO exchanged a glance, one of those tiny human burst communications that said more than words could have.Miller didnt know either of them well enough to decode all of it, but he guessed they were skeptical.They had reason to be.Miller had checked his credit balance before hed called them.He had enough left for another night in the hotel or a good dinner, but not both.He was spending it on a cheap breakfast that Holden and his crew didnt need and probably wouldnt enjoy, buying good will.I need to make very, very sure I understand what youre saying, Holden said as the big one Amos returned and sat at his other side holding the bagel.Are you saying that unless I let you on my ship, your friend is going to keep us here?Because thats blackmail.Extortion, Amos said.What?Holden said.Its not blackmail, Naomi said.That would be if he threatened to expose information we didnt want known.If its just a threat, thats extortion.And its not what Im talking about, Miller said.Freedom of the station while the investigation rolls?Thats no trouble.Leaving jurisdictions another thing.I cant hold you here any more than I can cut you loose.Im just looking for a ride when you go.Why?Holden said.Because youre going to Julies asteroid, Miller said.Im willing to bet theres no port there, Holden said.Did you plan on going anyplace after that?Im kind of low on solid plans.Havent had one yet that actually happened.I hear that, Amos said.Weve been fucked eighteen different ways since we got into this.Holden folded his hands on the table, one finger tapping a complicated rhythm on the wood textured concrete top.It wasnt a good sign.You seem like a well, like an angry, bitter old man, actually.But Ive been working water haulers for the past five years.That just means youd fit in.But, Miller said, and let the word hang there.But Ive been shot at a lot recently, and the machine guns yesterday were the least lethal thing Ive had to deal with, Holden said.Im not letting anyone on my ship that I wouldnt trust with my life, and I dont actually know you.I can get the money, Miller said, his belly sinking.If its money, I can cover it.Its not about negotiating a price, Holden said.Get the money?Naomi said, her eyes narrowing.Get the money, as in you dont have it now?Im a little short, Miller said.Its temporary.You have an income?Naomi said.More like a strategy, Miller said.Theres some independent rackets down on the docks.There always are at any port.Side games.Fights.Things like that.Most of them, the fix is in.Its how you bribe cops without actually bribing cops.Thats your plan?Holden said, incredulity in his voice.Go collect some police bribes?Across the restaurant, a prostitute in a red nightgown yawned prodigiously; the john across the table from her frowned.No, Miller said reluctantly.I play the side bets.A cop goes in, I make a side bet that hes going to win.I know who the cops are mostly.The house, they know because theyre bribing them.The side bets are with fish looking to feel edgy because theyre playing unlicensed.Even as he said it, Miller knew how weak it sounded.Alex, the pilot, came and sat beside Miller.His coffee smelled bright and acidic.Whats the deal?Alex asked.There isnt one, Holden said.There wasnt one before and there still isnt.It works better than youd think, Miller said gamely, and four hand terminals chimed at once.Holden and Naomi exchanged another, less complicit glance and pulled up their terminals.Amos and Alex already had theirs up.Miller caught the red and green border that meant either a priority message or an early Christmas card.There was a moments silence as they all read something; then Amos whistled low.Stage three?Naomi said.Cant say as I like the sound of that, Alex said.You mind if I ask?Miller said.Holden slid his terminal across the table.The message was plaintext, encoded from Tycho.CAUGHT MOLE IN TYCHO COMM STATION.YOUR PRESENCE AND DESTINATION LEAKED TO UNKNOWN PERSONS ON EROS.BE CAREFUL.Little late on that, Miller said.Keep reading, Holden said.MOLES ENCRYPTION CODE ALLOWED INTERCEPT OF SUBSIGNAL BROADCAST FROM EROS FIVE HOURS AGO.INTERCEPTED MESSAGE FOLLOWS: HOLDEN ESCAPED BUT PAYLOAD SAMPLE RECOVERED.REPEAT: SAMPLE RECOVERED.PROCEEDING TO STAGE THREE.Any idea what that means?Holden asked.I dont, Miller said, pushing the terminal back.Except if the payload sample is Julies body.Which I think we can assume it is, Holden said.Miller tapped his fingertips on the tabletop, unconsciously copying Holdens rhythm, his mind working through the combinations.This thing, Miller said.The bioweapon or whatever.They were shipping it here.So now its here.Okay.Theres no reason to take out Eros.Its not particularly important to the war when you hold it up to Ceres or Ganymede or the shipyard at Callisto.And if you wanted it dead, therere easier ways.Blow a big fusion bomb on the surface, and crack it like an egg.Its not a military base, but it is a shipping hub, Naomi said.And, unlike Ceres, its not under OPA control.Theyre shipping her out, then, Holden said.Theyre taking their sample out to infect whatever their original target was, and once theyre off the station, theres no way were going to stop it.Miller shook his head.Something about the chain of logic felt wrong.He was missing something.His imaginary Julie appeared across the room, but her eyes were dark, black filaments pouring down her cheeks like tears.What am I looking at here, Julie?he thought.Im seeing something here, but I dont know what it is.The vibration was a slight, small thing, less than a transport tubes braking stutter.A few plates rattled; the coffee in Naomis cup danced in a series of concentric circles.Everyone in the hotel went silent with the sudden shared dread of thousands of people made aware of their fragility in the same moment.Oh kay, Amos said.The fuck was that?and the emergency Klaxons started blaring.Or possibly stage three is something else, Miller said over the noise.* * *   The public address system was muddy by its nature.The same voice spoke from consoles and speakers that might have been as close as a meter from each other or as far out as earshot would take them.It made every word reverberate, a false echo.Because of that, the voice of the emergency broadcast system enunciated very carefully, each word bitten off separately.Attention, please.Eros Station is in emergency lockdown.Proceed immediately to the casino level for radiological safety confinement.Cooperate with all emergency personnel.Attention, please.Eros station is in emergency lockdown   And on in a loop that would continue, if no one coded in the override, until every man, woman, child, animal, and insect on the station had been reduced to dust and humidity.It was the nightmare scenario, and Miller did what a lifetime on pressurized rocks had trained him to do.He was up from the table, in the corridor, and heading down toward the wider passages, already clogged with bodies.Holden and his crew were on his heels.That was an explosion, Alex said.Ship drive at the least.Maybe a nuke.They are going to kill the station, Holden said.There was a kind of awe in his voice.I never thought Id miss the part where they just blew up the ships I was on.But now its stations.They didnt crack it, Miller said.Youre sure of that?Naomi asked.I can hear you talking, Miller said.That tells me theres air.There are airlocks, Holden said.If the station got holed and the locks closed down   A woman pushed hard against Millers shoulder, forcing her way forward.If they werent damn careful, there was going to be a stampede.This was too much fear and not enough space.It hadnt happened yet, but the impatient movement of the crowd, vibrating like molecules in water just shy of boiling, made Miller very uncomfortable.This isnt a ship, Miller said.Its a station.This is rock were on.Anything big enough to get to the parts of the station with atmosphere would crack the place like an egg.A great big pressurized egg.The crowd was stopped, the tunnel full.They were going to need crowd control, and they were going to need it fast.For the first time since hed left Ceres, Miller wished he had a badge.Someone pushed into Amos side, then backed away through the press when the big guy growled.Besides, Miller said, its a rad hazard.You dont need air loss to kill everyone in the station.Just burn a few quadrillion spare neutrons through the place at C, and there wont be any trouble with the oxygen supply.Cheerful fucker, Amos said.They build stations inside of rocks for a reason, Naomi said.Not so easy to force radiation through this many meters of rock.I spent a month in a rad shelter once, Alex said as they pushed through the thickening crowd.Ship I was on had magnetic containment drop.Automatic cutoffs failed, and the reactor kept runnin for almost a second.Melted the engine room.Killed five of the crew on the next deck up before they knew we had a problem, and it took them three days to carve the bodies free of the melted decking for burial.The rest of us wound up eighteen to a shelter for thirty six days while a tug flew to get us.Sounds great, Holden said.End of it, six of em got married, and the rest of us never spoke to each other again, Alex said.Ahead of them, someone shouted.It wasnt in alarm or even anger, really.Frustration.Fear.Exactly the things Miller didnt want to hear.That may not be our big problem, Miller said, but before he could explain, a new voice cut in, drowning out the emergency response loop.Okay, everybody!Were Eros security, que no?We got an emergency, so you do what we tell you and nobody gets hurt.About time, Miller thought.So heres the rule, the new voice said.Next asshole who pushes anyone, Im going to shoot them.Move in an orderly fashion.First priority: orderly.Second priority is move!Go, go, go!At first nothing happened.The knot of human bodies was tied too tightly for even the most heavy handed crowd control to free quickly, but a minute later, Miller saw some heads far ahead of him in the tunnel start to shift, then move away.The air in the tunnel was thickening and the hot plastic smell of overloaded recyclers reached him just as the clot came free.Millers breath started coming easier.Do they have hard shelters?a woman behind them asked her companion, and then was swept away by the currents.Naomi plucked Millers sleeve.Do they?she asked.They should, yes, Miller said.Enough for maybe a quarter million, and essential personnel and medical crews would get first crack at them.And everyone else?Amos said.If they survive the event, Holden said, station personnel will save as many people as they can.Ah, Amos said.Then: Well, fuck that.Were going for the Roci, right?Oh, hell yes, Holden said.Ahead of them, the fast shuffling crowd in their tunnel was merging with another flow of people from a lower level.Five thick necked men in riot gear were waving people on.Two of them were pointing guns at the crowd.Miller was more than half tempted to go up and slap the little idiots.Pointing guns at people was a lousy way to avoid panic.One of the security men was also far too wide for his gear, the Velcro fasteners at his belly reaching out for each other like lovers at the moment of separation.Miller looked down at the floor and slowed his steps, the back of his mind suddenly and powerfully busy.One of the cops swung his gun out over the crowd.Another one the fat guy laughed and said something in Korean.What had Sematimba said about the new security force?All bluster, no balls.A new corporation out of Luna.Belters on the ground.Corrupt.The name.Theyd had a name.CPM.Carne Por la Machina.Meat for the machine.One of the gun wielding cops lowered his weapon, swept off his helmet, and scratched violently behind one ear.He had wild black hair, a tattooed neck, and a scar that went from one eyelid down almost to the joint of his jaw.Miller knew him.A year and a half ago, hed arrested him for assault and racketeering.And the equipment armor, batons, riot guns also looked hauntingly familiar.Dawes had been wrong.Miller had been able to find his own missing equipment after all.Whatever this was, it had been going on a long time before the Canterbury had picked up a distress call from the Scopuli.A long time before Julie had vanished.And putting a bunch of Ceres Station thugs in charge of Eros crowd control using stolen Ceres Station equipment had been part of the plan.The third phase.Ah, he thought.Well.That cant be good.Miller slid to the side, letting as many bodies as he plausibly could fill the space between him and the gunmen dressed as police.Get down to the casino level, one of the gunmen shouted over the crowd.Well get you into the radiation shelters from there, but youve got to get to the casino level!Holden and his crew hadnt noticed anything odd.They were talking among themselves, strategizing about how to get to their ship and what to do once they got there, speculating about who might have attacked the station and where Julie Maos twisted, infected corpse might be headed.Miller fought the impulse to interrupt them.He needed to stay calm, to think things through.They couldnt attract attention.He needed the right moment.The corridor turned and widened.The press of bodies lightened a little bit.Miller waited for a dead zone in the crowd control, a space where none of the fake security men could see them.He took Holden by the elbow.Dont go, he said.What do you mean, dont go?Holden asked, yanking his elbow out of Millers grasp.Somebody just nuked the station.This has escalated beyond our capacity to respond.If we cant get to the Roci, were doing whatever they tell us to until we can.Miller took a step back and put up his hands; he was clearly doing his best to look nonthreatening, which just pissed Holden off even more.Behind him, the riot cops were motioning the people milling in the corridors toward the casinos.The air echoed with the electronically amplified voices of the police directing the crowds and the buzz of anxious citizens.Over it all, the public address system told everyone to remain calm and cooperate with emergency personnel.See that bruiser over there in the police riot gear?Miller said.His name is Gabby Smalls.He supervises a chunk of the Golden Bough protection racket on Ceres.He also runs a little dust on the side, and I suspect hes tossed more than a few people out airlocks.Holden looked at the guy.Wide shoulders, thick gut.Now that Miller pointed him out, there was something about him that didnt seem right for a cop.I dont get it, Holden said.A couple months ago, when you started a bunch of riots by saying Mars blew up your water hauler, we found out   I never said    found out that most of the police riot gear on Ceres was missing.A few months before that, a bunch of our underworld muscle went missing.I just found out where both of them are.Miller pointed at the riot gear equipped Gabby Smalls.I wouldnt go wherever hes sending people, he said.I really wouldnt.A thin stream of people bumped past.Then where?Naomi asked.Yeah, I mean, if the choice is radiation or mobsters, I gotta go with the mobsters, Alex said, nodding emphatically at Naomi.Miller pulled out his hand terminal and held it up so everyone could see the screen.Ive got no radiation warnings, he said.Whatever happened outside isnt a danger on this level.Not right now.So lets just calm down and make the smart move.Holden turned his back on Miller and motioned to Naomi.He pulled her aside and said in a quiet voice, I still think we go back to the ship and get out of here.Take our chances getting past these mobsters.If theres no radiation danger, then I agree, she said with a nod.I disagree, Miller said, not even pretending he hadnt been eavesdropping.To do that we have to walk through three levels of casino filled with riot gear and thugs.Theyre going to tell us to get in one of those casinos for our own protection.When we dont, theyll beat us unconscious and throw us in anyway.For our own protection.Another crowd of people poured out of a branch corridor, heading for the reassuring presence of the police and the bright casino lights.Holden found it difficult not to be swept along with the crowd.A man with two enormous suitcases bumped into Naomi, almost knocking her down.Holden grabbed her hand.Whats the alternative?he asked Miller.Miller glanced up and down the corridor, seeming to measure the flow of people.He nodded at a yellow and black striped hatch down a small maintenance corridor.That one, he said.Its marked HIGH VOLTAGE, so the guys sweeping for stragglers wont bother with it.Its not the kind of place citizens hide.Can you get that door open quickly?Holden said, looking at Amos.Can I break it?If you need to.Then sure, Amos said, and began pushing his way through the crowd toward the maintenance hatch.At the door, he pulled out his multi tool and popped off the cheap plastic housing for the card reader.After he twisted a couple of wires together, the hatch slid open with a hydraulic hiss.Ta da, Amos said.The reader wont work anymore, so anyone who wants in comes in.Lets worry about that if it happens, Miller replied, then led them into the dimly lit passageway beyond.The service corridor was filled with electrical cable held together with plastic ties.It stretched through the dim red light for thirty or forty feet before falling into gloom.The light came from LEDs mounted on the metal bracing that sprouted from the wall every five feet or so to hold the cable up.Naomi had to duck to enter, her frame about four centimeters too tall for the ceiling.She put her back to the wall and slid down onto her haunches.Youd think theyd make the maintenance corridors tall enough for Belters to work in, she said irritably.Holden touched the wall almost reverently, tracing a corridor identification number carved right into the stone.The Belters who built this place werent tall, he said.These are some of the main power lines.This tunnel goes back to the first Belt colony.The people who carved it grew up in gravity.Miller, who also had to duck his head, sat on the floor with a grunt and popping knees.History lesson later, he said.Lets figure a way off this rock.Amos, studying the bundles of cable intently, said over his shoulder, If you see a frayed spot, dont touch it.This thick fucker right here is a couple million volts.Thatd melt your shit down real good.Alex sat down next to Naomi, grimacing when his butt hit the cold stone floor.You know, he said, if they decide to seal up the station, they might pump all the air outta these maintenance corridors.I get it, Holden said loudly.Its a shitty and uncomfortable hiding spot.You have my permission to now shut up about that.He squatted down across the corridor from Miller and said, Okay, Detective.Now what?Now, Miller said, we wait for the sweep to pass us by, and get behind it, try to get to the docks.The folks in the shelters are easy to avoid.Shelters are up deep.Tricks going to be getting through the casino levels.Cant we just use these maintenance passages to move around?Alex asked.Amos shook his head.Not without a map, we wont.You get lost in here, youre in trouble, he said.Ignoring them, Holden said, Okay, so we wait for everyone to move to the radiation shelters and then we leave.Miller nodded at him, and then the two men sat staring at each other for a moment.The air between them seemed to thicken, the silence taking on a meaning of its own.Miller shrugged like his jacket itched.Why do you think a bunch of Ceres mobsters are moving everyone to radiation shelters when theres no actual radiation danger?Holden finally said.And why are the Eros cops letting them?Good questions, Miller said.If they were using these yahoos, it helps explain why their attempted kidnapping at the hotel went so poorly.They dont seem like pros.Nope, Miller said.Thats not their usual area of expertise.Would you two be quiet?Naomi said.For almost a minute they were.Itd be really stupid, Holden said, to go take a look at whats going on, wouldnt it?Yes.Whatevers going on at those shelters, you know thats where all the guards and patrols will be, Miller said.Yeah, Holden said.Captain, Naomi said, a warning in her voice.Still, Holden said, talking to Miller, you hate a mystery.I do at that, Miller replied with a nod and a faint smile.And you, my friend, are a damn busybody.Its been said.Goddamn it, Naomi said quietly.What is it, Boss?Amos asked.These two just broke our getaway plan, Naomi replied.Then she said to Holden, You guys are going to be very bad for each other and, by extension, us.No, Holden replied.You arent coming along.You stay here with Amos and Alex.Give us he looked at his terminal three hours to go look and come back.If we arent here   We leave you to the gangsters and the three of us get jobs on Tycho and live happily ever after, Naomi said.Yeah, Holden said with a grin.Dont be a hero.Wouldnt even consider it, sir.* * *   Holden crouched in the shadows outside the maintenance hatch and watched as Ceres mobsters dressed in police riot gear led the citizens of Eros away in small groups.The PA system continued to declare the possibility of radiological danger and exhorted the citizens and guests of Eros to cooperate fully with emergency personnel.Holden had selected a group to follow and was getting ready to move when Miller placed a hand on his shoulder.Wait, Miller said.I want to make a call.He quickly dialed up a number on his hand terminal, and after a few moments, a flat gray Network Not Available message appeared.Phone is down?Holden asked.Thats the first thing Id do, too, Miller replied.I see, Holden said even though he really didnt.Well, I guess its just you and me, Miller said, then took the magazine out of his gun and began reloading it with cartridges he pulled out of his coat pocket.Even though hed had enough of gunfights to last him the rest of his life, Holden took out his gun and checked the magazine as well.Hed replaced it after the shoot out in the hotel, and it was full.He racked it and put it back in the waistband of his pants.Miller, he noticed, kept his out, holding it close to his thigh, where his coat mostly covered it.It wasnt difficult following the groups up through the station toward the inner sections where the radiation shelters were.As long as they kept moving in the same direction as the crowds, no one gave them a second look.Holden made a mental note of the many corridor intersections where men in riot gear stood guard.It would be much tougher coming back down.When the group they were following eventually stopped outside a large metal door marked with the ancient radiation symbol, Holden and Miller slipped off to the side and hid behind a large planter filled with ferns and a couple of stunted trees.Holden watched the fake riot cops order everyone into the shelter and then seal the door behind them with the swipe of a card.All but one of them left, the remaining one standing guard outside the door.Miller whispered, Lets ask him to let us in.Follow my lead, Holden replied, then stood up and began walking toward the guard.Hey, shithead, you supposed to be in a shelter or in the casino, so get the fuck back to your group, the guard said, his hand on the butt of his gun.Holden held up his hands placatingly, smiled, and kept walking.Hey, I lost my group.Got mixed up somehow.Im not from here, you know, he said.The guard pointed down the corridor with the stun baton in his left hand.Go that way till you hit the ramps down, he said.Miller seemed to appear out of nowhere in the dimly lit corridor, his gun already out and pointed at the guards head.He thumbed off the safety with an audible click.How about we just join the group already inside?he said.Open it up.The guard looked at Miller out of the corners of his eyes, not turning his head at all.His hands went up, and he dropped the baton.You dont want to do that, man, the fake cop said.I kind of think he does, Holden said.You should do what he says.Hes not a very nice person.Miller pushed the barrel of his gun against the guards head and said, You know what we used to call a no brainer back at the station house?Its when a shot to the head actually blows the entire brain out of someones skull.It usually happens when a gun is pressed to the victims head right about here.The gass got nowhere to go.Pops the brain right out through the exit wound.They said not to open these up once theyd been sealed, man, the guard said, speaking so fast he ran all the words together.They were pretty serious about that.This is the last time I ask, Miller said.Next time I just use the card I took off your body.Holden turned the guard around to face the door and pulled the handgun out of the mans belt holster.He hoped all Millers threats were just threats.He suspected they werent.Just open the door, and well let you go, I promise, Holden said to the guard.The guard nodded and moved up to the door, then slid his card through it and punched in a number on the keypad.The heavy blast door slid open.Beyond it, the room was even darker than the corridor outside.A few emergency LEDs glowed a sullen red.In the faint illumination, Holden could see dozens hundreds of bodies scattered across the floor, unmoving.Are they dead?Holden asked.I dont know nothing about  the guard said, but Miller cut him off.You go in first, Miller said, and pushed the guard forward.Hold on, Holden said.I dont think its a good idea to just charge in here.Three things happened at once.The guard took four steps forward and then collapsed on the floor.Miller sneezed once, loudly, and then started to sway drunkenly.And both Holdens and Millers hand terminals began an angry electric buzzing.Miller staggered back and said, The door   Holden hit the button and the door slid shut again.Gas, Miller said, then coughed.Theres gas in there.While the ex cop leaned against the corridor wall and coughed, Holden took out his terminal to shut off the buzzing.But the alarm flashing on its screen wasnt an air contamination alert.It was the venerable three wedge shapes pointing inward.Radiation.As he watched, the symbol, which should have been white, shifted through an angry orange color to dark red.Miller was looking at his too, his expression unreadable.Weve been dosed, Holden said.Ive never actually seen the detector activate, Miller said, his voice rough and faint after his coughing fit.What does it mean when the thing is red?It means well be bleeding from our rectums in about six hours, Holden said.We have to get to the ship.Itll have the meds we need.What, Miller said, the fuck is going on?Holden grabbed Miller by the arm and led him back down the corridor toward the ramps.Holdens skin felt warm and itchy.He didnt know if it was radiation burn or psychosomatic.With the amount of radiation hed just taken, it was a good thing he had sperm tucked away in Montana and on Europa.Thinking that made his balls itch.They nuke the station, Holden said.Hell, maybe they just pretend to nuke it.Then they drag everyone down here and toss them into radiation shelters that are only radioactive on the inside.Gas them to keep them quiet.There are easier ways to kill people, Miller said, his breathing coming in ragged gasps as they ran down the corridor.So it has to be more than that, Holden said.The bug, right?The one that killed that girl.It fed on radiation.Incubators, Miller said, nodding in agreement.They arrived at one of the ramps to the lower levels, but a group of citizens led by two fake riot cops were coming up.Holden grabbed Miller and pulled him to one side, where they could hide in the shadow of a closed noodle shop.So they infected them, right?Holden said in a whisper, waiting for the group to pass.Maybe fake radiation meds with the bug in it.Maybe that brown goo just spread around on the floor.Then whatever was in the girl, Julie   He stopped when Miller walked away from him straight at the group that had just come up the ramp.Officer, said Miller to one of the fake cops.They both stopped, and one of them said, You supposed to be   Miller shot him in the throat, right below his helmets faceplate.Then he swiveled smoothly and shot the other guard in the inside of the thigh, just below the groin.When the man fell backward, yelling in pain, Miller walked up and shot him again, this time in the neck.A couple of the citizens started screaming.Miller pointed his gun at them and they got quiet.Go down a level or two and find someplace to hide, he said.Do not cooperate with these men, even though theyre dressed like police.They do not have your best interests at heart.Go.The citizens hesitated, then ran.Miller took a few cartridges out of his pocket and began replacing the three hed fired.Holden started to speak, but Miller cut him off.Take the throat shot if you can.Most people, the faceplate and chest armor dont quite cover that gap.If the neck is covered, then shoot the inside of the thigh.Very thin armor there.Mobility issue.Takes most people down in one shot.Holden nodded, as though that all made sense.Okay, Holden said.Say, lets get back to the ship before we bleed to death, right?No more shooting people if we can help it.His voice sounded calmer than he felt.Miller slapped the magazine back into his gun and chambered a round.Im guessing theres a lot more people need to be shot before this is over, he said.But sure.First things first.The first time Miller killed anyone was in his third year working security.Hed been twenty two, just married, talking about having kids.As the new guy on the contract, hed gotten the shit jobs: patrolling levels so high the Coriolis made him seasick, taking domestic disturbance calls in holes no wider than a storage bin, standing guard on the drunk tank to keep predators from raping the unconscious.The normal hazing.Hed known to expect it.Hed thought he could take it.The call had been from an illegal restaurant almost at the mass center.At less than a tenth of a g, gravity had been little more than a suggestion, and his inner ear had been confused and angered by the change in spin.If he thought about it, he could still remember the sound of raised voices, too fast and slurred for words.The smell of bathtub cheese.The thin haze of smoke from the cheap electric griddle.It had happened fast.The perp had come out of the hole with a gun in one hand, dragging a woman by the hair with the other.Millers partner, a ten year veteran named Carson, had shouted out the warning.The perp had turned, swinging the gun out at arms length like a stuntman in a video.All through training, the instructors had said that you couldnt know what youd do until the moment came.Killing another human being was hard.Some people couldnt.The perps gun came around; the gunman dropped the woman and shouted.It turned out that, for Miller at least, it wasnt all that hard.Afterward, hed been through mandatory counseling.Hed cried.Hed suffered the nightmares and the shakes and all the things that cops suffered quietly and didnt talk about.But even then, it seemed to be happening at a distance, like hed gotten too drunk and was watching himself throw up.It was just a physical reaction.It would pass.The important thing was he knew the answer to the question.Yes, if he needed to, he could take a life.It wasnt until now, walking through the corridors of Eros, that hed taken joy in it.Even taking down the poor bastard in that first firefight had felt like the sad necessity of work.Pleasure in killing hadnt come until after Julie, and it wasnt really pleasure as much as a brief cessation of pain.He held the gun low.Holden started down the ramp, and Miller followed, letting the Earther take point.Holden walked faster than he did and with the uncommented athleticism of someone who lived in a wide variety of gravities.Miller had the feeling hed made Holden nervous, and he regretted that a little.He hadnt intended to, and he really needed to get aboard Holdens ship if he was going to find Julies secrets.Or, for that matter, not die of radiation sickness in the next few hours.That seemed a finer point than it probably was.Okay, Holden said at the bottom of the ramp.We need to get back down, and there are a lot of guards between us and Naomi that are going to be really confused by two guys walking the wrong direction.Thats a problem, Miller agreed.Any thoughts?Miller frowned and considered the flooring.The Eros floors were different than Ceres.Laminate with flecks of gold.Tubes arent going to be running, he said.If they are, itll be in lockdown mode, where it only stops at the holding pen down in the casino.So thats out.Maintenance corridor again?If we can find one that goes between levels, Miller said.Might be a little tricky, but it seems like a better bet than shooting our way past a couple dozen assholes in armor.How long have we got before your friend takes off?Holden looked at his hand terminal.The radiation alarm was still deep red.Miller wondered how long those took to reset.A little more than two hours, Holden said.Shouldnt be a problem.Lets see what we can find, Miller said.The corridors nearest the radiation shelters the death traps, the incubators had been emptied.Wide passages built to accommodate the ancient construction equipment that had carved Eros into a human habitation were eerie with only Holdens and Millers footsteps and the hum of the air recyclers.Miller hadnt noticed when the emergency announcements had stopped, but the absence of them now seemed ominous.If it had been Ceres, he would have known where to go, where everything led, how to move gracefully from one stage to another.On Eros, all he had was an educated guess.That wasnt so bad.But he could tell it was taking too long, and worse than that they werent talking about it; neither one spoke they were walking more slowly than normal.It wasnt up to the threshold of consciousness, but Miller knew that both of their bodies were starting to feel the radiation damage.It wasnt going to get better.Okay, Holden said.Somewhere around here there has to be a maintenance shaft.Could also try the tube station, Miller said.The cars run in vacuum, but there might be some service tunnels running parallel.Dont you think theyd have shut those down as part of the big roundup?Probably, Miller said.Hey!You two!What the fuck you think youre doing up here?Miller looked back over his shoulder.Two men in riot gear were waving at them menacingly.Holden said something sharp under his breath.Miller narrowed his eyes.The thing was these men were amateurs.The beginning of an idea moved in the back of Millers mind as he watched the two approach.Killing them and taking their gear wouldnt work.There was nothing like scorch marks and blood to make it clear something had happened.But  Miller, Holden said, a warning in his voice.Yeah, Miller said.I know.I said what the fuck are you two doing here?one of the security men said.The stations on lockdown.Everyone goes down to the casino level or up to the radiation shelters.We were just looking for a way to ah get down to the casino level, Holden said, smiling and being nonthreatening.Were not from around here, and   The closer of the two guards jabbed the butt of his rifle neatly into Holdens leg.The Earther staggered, and Miller shot the guard just below the faceplate, then turned to the one still standing, mouth agape.Youre Mikey Ko, right?Miller said.The mans face went even paler, but he nodded.Holden groaned and stood.Detective Miller, Miller said.Busted you on Ceres about four years ago.You got a little happy in a bar.Tappans, I think?Hit a girl with a pool cue?Oh, hey, the man said with a frightened smile.Yeah, I remember you.How you been doing?Good and bad, Miller said.You know how it is.Give the Earther your gun.Ko looked from Miller to Holden and back, licking his lips and judging his chances.Miller shook his head.Seriously, Miller said.Give him the gun.Sure, yeah.No problem.This was the kind of man whod killed Julie, Miller thought.Stupid.Shortsighted.A man born with a sense for raw opportunity where his soul should have been.Millers mental Julie shook her head in disgust and sorrow, and Miller found himself wondering if she meant the thug now handing his rifle to Holden or himself.Maybe both.Whats the deal here, Mikey?Miller asked.What do you mean?the guard said, playing stupid, like they were in an interrogation cell.Stalling for time.Walking through the old script of cop and criminal as if it still made sense.As if everything hadnt changed.Miller was surprised by a tightness in his throat.He didnt know what it was there for.The job, he said.Whats the job?I dont know   Hey, Miller said gently.I just killed your buddy.And thats his third today, Holden said.I saw him.Miller could see it in the mans eyes: the cunning, the shift, the move from one strategy to another.It was old and familiar and as predictable as water moving down.Hey, Ko said, its just a job.They told us about a year ago how we were making a big move, right?But no one knows what it is.So a few months back, they start moving guys over.Training us up like we were cops, you know?Who was training you?Miller said.The last guys.The ones who were working the contract before us, Ko said.Protogen?Something like that, yeah, he said.Then they took off, and we took over.Just muscle, you know.Some smuggling.Smuggling what?All kinds of shit, Ko said.He was starting to feel safe, and it showed in the way he held himself and the way he spoke.Surveillance equipment, communication arrays, serious as fuck servers with their own little gel software wonks already built in.Scientific equipment too.Stuff for checking the water and the air and shit.And these ancient remote access robots like youd use in a vacuum dig.All sorts of shit.Where was it going to?Holden asked.Here, Ko said, gesturing to the air, the stone, the station.Its all here.They were like months installing it all.And then for weeks, nothing.What do you mean, nothing?Miller asked.Nothing nothing.All this buildup and then we sat around with our thumbs up our butts.Something had gone wrong.The Phoebe bug hadnt made its rendezvous, but then Julie had come, Miller thought, and the game had turned back on.He saw her again as if he were in her apartment.The long, spreading tendrils of whatever the hell it was, the bone spurs pressing out against her skin, the black froth of filament pouring from her eyes.The pays good, though, Ko said philosophically.And it was kind of nice taking some time off.Miller nodded in agreement, leaned close, tucking the barrel of his gun through the interleaving of armor at Kos belly, and shot him.What the fuck!Holden said as Miller put his gun into his jacket pocket.What did you think was going to happen?Miller said, squatting down beside the gut shot man.Its not like he was going to let us go.Yeah, okay, Holden said.But   Help me get him up, Miller said, hooking an arm behind Kos shoulder.Ko shrieked when Miller lifted him.What?Get his other side, Miller said.Man needs medical attention, right?Um.Yes, Holden said.So get his other side.It wasnt as far back to the radiation shelters as Miller had expected, which had its good points and its bad ones.On the upside, Ko was still alive and screaming.The chances were better that hed be lucid, which wasnt what Miller had intended.But as they came near the first group of guards, Kos babbling seemed scattered enough to work.Hey!Miller shouted.Some help over here!At the head of the ramp, four of the guards looked at one another and then started moving toward them, curiosity winning out over basic operating procedures.Holden was breathing hard.Miller was too.Ko wasnt that heavy.It was a bad sign.What the hell is this?one of the guards said.Theres a bunch of people holed up back there, Miller said.Resistance.I thought you people swept this level.That wasnt our job, the guy said.Were just making sure the groups from the casino get to the shelters.Well, someone screwed up, Miller snapped.You have transport?The guards looked at each other again.We can call for one, a guy at the back said.Never mind, Miller said.You boys go find the shooters.Wait a minute, the first guy said.Exactly who the hell are you?The installers from Protogen, Holden said.Were replacing the sensors that failed.This guy was supposed to help us.I didnt hear about that, the leader said.Miller dug a finger under Kos armor and squeezed.Ko shrieked and tried to writhe away from him.Talk to your boss about it on your own time, Miller said.Come on.
