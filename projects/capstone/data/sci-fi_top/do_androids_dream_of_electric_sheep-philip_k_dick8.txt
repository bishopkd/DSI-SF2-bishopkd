Unlawful, Rick repeated.To save their lives.Iran says you bought a goat, Bryant said.Just today?After you left work?On my way home.Ill come and look at your goat after you retire the remaining androids.By the wayI talked to Dave just now.I told him the trouble they gave you; he says congratulations and be more careful.He says the Nexus 6 types are smarter than he thought.In fact he couldnt believe you got three in one day.Three is enough, Rick said.I cant do anything more.I have to rest.By tomorrow theyll be gone, Inspector Bryant said.Out of our jurisdiction.Not that soon.Theyll still be around.Bryant said, You get over there tonight.Before they get dug in.They wont expect you to move in so fast.Sure they will, Rick said.Theyll be waiting for me.Got the shakes?Because of what, Polokov  I havent got the shakes, Rick said.Then whats wrong?Okay, Rick said.Ill get over there.He started to hang up the phone.Let me know as soon as you get results.Ill be here in my office.Rick said, If I get them Im going to buy a sheep.You have a sheep.Youve had one as long as Ive known you.Its electric, Rick said.He hung up.A real sheep this time, he said to himself.I have to get one.In compensation.At the black empathy box his wife crouched, her face rapt.He stood beside her for a time, his hand resting on her breast; he felt it rise and fall, the life in her, the activity.Iran did not notice him; the experience with Mercer had, as always, become complete.On the screen the faint, old, robed figure of Mercer toiled upward, and all at once a rock sailed past him.Watching, Rick thought, My god; theres something worse about my situation than his.Mercer doesnt have to do anything alien to him.He suffers but at least he isnt required to violate his own identity.Bending, he gently removed his wifes fingers from the twin handles.He then himself took her place.For the first time in weeks.An impulse: he hadnt planned it; all at once it had happened.A landscape of weeds confronted him, a desolation.The air smelled of harsh blossoms; this was the desert, and there was no rain.A man stood before him, a sorrowful light in his weary, pain drenched eyes.Mercer, Rick said.I am your friend, the old man said.But you must go on as if I did not exist.Can you understand that?He spread empty hands.No, Rick said.I cant understand that.I need help.How can I save you, the old man said, if I cant save myself?He smiled.Dont you see?There is no salvation.Then whats this for?Rick demanded.What are you for?To show you, Wilbur Mercer said, that you arent alone.I am here with you and always will be.Go and do your task, even though you know its wrong.Why?Rick said.Why should I do it?Ill quit my job and emigrate.The old man said, You will be required to do wrong no matter where you go.It is the basic condition of life, to be required to violate your own identity.At some time, every creature which lives must do so.It is the ultimate shadow, the defeat of creation; this is the curse at work, the curse that feeds on all life.Everywhere in the universe.Thats all you can tell me?Rick said.A rock whizzed at him; he ducked and the rock struck him on the ear.At once he let go of the handles and again he stood in his own living room, beside his wife and the empathy box.His head ached wildly from the blow; reaching, he found fresh blood collecting, spilling in huge bright drops down the side of his face.Iran, with a handkerchief, patted his ear.I guess Im glad you pried me loose.I really cant stand it, being hit.Thanks for taking the rock in my place.Im going, Rick said.The job?Three jobs.He took the handkerchief from her and went to the hall door, still dizzy and, now, feeling nausea.Good luck, Iran said.I didnt get anything from holding onto those handles, Rick said.Mercer talked to me but it didnt help.He doesnt know any more than I do.Hes just an old man climbing a hill to his death.Isnt that the revelation?Rick said, I have that revelation already.He opened the hall door.Ill see you later.Stepping out into the hall he shut the door after him.Conapt 3967 C, he reflected, reading it off the back of the contract.Thats out in the suburbs; its mostly abandoned, there.A good place to hide.Except : or the lights at night.Thats what Ill be going by, he thought.The lights.Phototropic, like the deaths head moth.And then after this, he thought, there wont be any more.Ill do something else, earn my living another way.These three are the last.Mercer is right; I have to get this over with.But, he thought, I dont think I can.Two andys togetherthis isnt a moral question, its a practical question.I probably cant retire them, he realized.Even if I try; Im too tired and too much has happened today.Maybe Mercer knew this, he reflected.Maybe he foresaw everything that will happen.But I know where I can get help, offered to me before but declined.He reached the roof and a moment later sat in the darkness of his hovercar, dialing.Rosen Association, the answering service girl said.Rachael Rosen, he said.Pardon, sir?Rick grated, Get me Rachael Rosen.Is Miss Rosen expecting  Im sure she is, he said.He waited.Ten minutes later Rachael Rosens small dark face appeared on the vidscreen.Hello, Mr.Deckard.Are you busy right now or can I talk to you?he said.As you said earlier today.It did not seem like today; a generation had risen and declined since he had talked to her last.And all the weight, all the weariness of it, had recapitulated itself in his body; he felt the physical burden.Perhaps, he thought, because of the rock.With the handkerchief he dabbed at his still bleeding ear,  Your ear is cut, Rachael said.What a shame.Rick said, Did you really think I wouldnt call you?As you said?I told you, Rachael said, that without me one of the Nexus 6s would get you before you got it.You were wrong.But you are calling.Anyhow.Do you want me to come down there to San Francisco?Tonight, he said.Oh, its too late.Ill come tomorrow; its an hour trip.I have been told I have to get them tonight.He paused and then said, Out of the original eight, three are left.You sound like youve had a just awful time.If you dont fly down here tonight, he said, Ill go after them alone and I wont be able to retire them.I just bought a goat, he added.With the bounty money from the three I did get.You humans.Rachael laughed.Goats smell terrible.Only male goats.I read it in the book of instructions that came with it.You really are tired, Rachael said.You look dazed.Are you sure you know what youre doing, trying for three more Nexus 6s the same day?No one has ever retired six androids in one day.Franklin Powers, Rick said.About a year ago, in Chicago.He retired seven.The obsolete McMillan Y 4 variety, Rachael said.This is something else.She pondered.Rick, I cant do it.I havent even had dinner.I need you, he said.Otherwise Im going to die, he said to himself.I know it; Mercer knew it; I think you know it, too.And Im wasting my time appealing to you, he reflected.An android cant be appealed to; theres nothing in there to reach.Rachael said, Im sorry, Rick, but I cant do it tonight.Itll have to be tomorrow.Android vengeance, Rick said.What?Because I tripped you up on the Voigt Kampff scale.Do you think that?Wide eyed, she said, Really?Good by, he said, and started to hang up.Listen, Rachael said rapidly.Youre not using your head.It seems that way to you because you Nexus 6 types are cleverer than humans.No, I really dont understand, Rachael sighed.I can tell that you dont want to do this job tonightmaybe not at all.Are you sure you want me to make it possible for you to retire the three remaining androids?Or do you want me to persuade you not to try?Come down here, he said, and well rent a hotel room.Why?Something I heard today, he said hoarsely.About situations involving human men and android women.Come down here to San Francisco tonight and Ill give up on the remaining andys.Well do something else.She eyed him, then abruptly said, Okay, Ill fly down.Where should I meet you?At the St.Francis.Its the only halfway decent hotel still in operation in the Bay Area.And you wont do anything until I get there.Ill sit in the hotel room, he said, and watch Buster Friendly on TV.His guest for the last three days has been Amanda Werner.I like her; I could watch her the rest of my life.She has breasts that smile.He hung up, then, and sat for a time, his mind vacant.At last the cold of the car roused him; he switched on the ignition key and a moment later headed in the direction of downtown San Francisco.And the St.Francis Hotel.16  In the sumptuous and enormous hotel room Rick Deckard sat reading the typed carbon sheets on the two androids Roy and Irmgard Baty.In these two cases telescopic snapshots had been included, fuzzy 3 D color prints which he could barely make out.The woman, he decided, looks attractive.Roy Baty, however, is something different.Something worse.A pharmacist on Mars, he read.Or at least the android had made use of that cover.In actuality it had probably been a manual laborer, a field hand, with aspirations for something better.Do androids dream?Rick asked himself.Evidently; thats why they occasionally kill their employers and flee here.A better life, without servitude.Like Luba Luft; singing Don Giovanni and Le Nozze instead of toiling across the face of a barren rock strewn field.On a fundamentally uninhabitable colony world.Roy Baty (the poop sheet informed him) has an aggressive, assertive air of ersatz authority.Given to mystical preoccupations, this android proposed the group escape attempt, underwriting it ideologically with a pretentious fiction as to the sacredness of so called android life.In addition, this android stole, and experimented with, various mind fusing drugs, claiming when caught that it hoped to promote in androids a group experience similar to that of Mercerism, which it pointed out remains unavailable to androids.The account had a pathetic quality.A rough, cold android, hoping to undergo an experience from which, due to a deliberately built in defect, it remained excluded.But he could not work up much concern for Roy Baty; he caught, from Daves jottings, a repellent quality hanging about this particular android.Baty had tried to force the fusion experience into existence for itselfand then, when that fell through, it had engineered the killing of a variety of human beings  followed by the flight to Earth.And now, especially as of today, the chipping away of the original eight androids until only the three remained.And they, the outstanding members of the illegal group, were also doomed, since if he failed to get them someone else would.Time and tide, he thought.The cycle of life.Ending in this, the last twilight.Before the silence of death.He perceived in this a micro universe, complete.The door of the hotel room banged open.What a flight, Rachael Rosen said breathlessly, entering in a long fish scale coat with matching bra and shorts; she carried, besides her big, ornate, mail pouch purse, a paper bag.This is a nice room.She examined her wristwatch.Less than an hourI made good time.Here.She held out the paper bag.I bought a bottle.Bourbon.Rick said, The worst of the eight is still alive.The one who organized them.He held the poop sheet on Roy Baty toward her; Rachael set down the paper bag and accepted the carbon sheet.Youve located this one?she asked, after reading.I have a conapt number.Out in the suburbs where possibly a couple of deteriorated specials, antheads and chickenheads, hang out and go through their versions of living.Rachael held out her hand.Lets see about the others.Both females.He passed her the sheets, one dealing with Irmgard Baty, the other an android calling itself Pris Stratton.Glancing at the final sheet Rachael said, Oh She tossed the sheets down, moved over to the window of the room to look out at downtown San Francisco.I think youre going to get thrown by the last one.Maybe not; maybe you dont care.She had turned pale and her voice shook.All at once she had become exceptionally unsteady.Exactly what are you muttering about?He retrieved the sheets, studied them, wondering which part had upset Rachael.Lets open the bourbon.Rachael carried the paper bag into the bathroom, got two glasses, returned; she still seemed distracted and uncertainand preoccupied.He sensed the rapid flight of her hidden thoughts: the transitions showed on her frowning, tense face.Can you get this open?she asked.Its worth a fortune, you realize.Its not synthetic; its from before the war, made from genuine mash.Taking the bottle he opened it, poured bourbon in the two tumblers.Tell me whats the matter, he said.Rachael said, On the phone you told me if I flew down here tonight youd give up on the remaining three andys.Well do something else, you said.But here we are  Tell me what upset you, he said.Facing him defiantly, Rachael said, Tell me what were going to do instead of fussing and fretting around about those last three Nexus 6 andys.She unbuttoned her coat, carried it to the closet, and hung it up.This gave him his first chance to have a good long look at her..Rachaels proportions, he noticed once again, were odd; with her heavy mass of dark hair her head seemed large, and because of her diminutive breasts her body assumed a lank, almost childlike stance.But her great eyes, with their elaborate lashes, could only be those of a grown woman; there the resemblance to adolescence ended.Rachael rested very slightly on the fore part of her feet, and her arms, as they hung, bent at the joint.The stance, he reflected, of a wary hunter of perhaps the Cro Magnon persuasion.The race of tall hunters, he said to himself.No excess flesh, a flat belly, small behind and smaller bosomRachael had been modeled on the Celtic type of build, anachronistic and attractive, Below the brief shorts her legs, slender, had a neutral, nonsexual quality, not much rounded off in nubile curves.The total impression was good, however.Although definitely that of a girl, not a woman.Except for the restless, shrewd eyes.He sipped the bourbon; the power of it, the authoritative strong taste and scent, had become almost unfamiliar to him and he had trouble swallowing.Rachael, in contrast, had no difficulty with hers.Seating herself on the bed Rachael smoothed absently at the spread; her expression had now become one of moodiness.He set his glass down on the bedside table and arranged himself beside her.Under his gross weight the bed gave, and Rachael shifted her position.What is it?he said.Reaching, he took hold of her hand; it felt cold, bony, slightly moist.What upset you?That last goddamn Nexus 6 type, Rachael said, enunciating with effort, is the same type as I am.She stared down at the bedspread, found a thread, and began rolling it into a pellet.Didnt you notice the description?Its of me, too.She may wear her hair differently and dress differentlyshe may even have bought a wig.But when you see her youll know what I mean.She laughed sardonically.Its a good thing the association admitted Im an andy; otherwise youd probably have gone mad when you caught sight of Pris Stratton.Or thought she was me.Why does that bother you so much?Hell, Ill be along when you retire her.Maybe not.Maybe I wont find her.Rachael said, I know Nexus 6 psychology.Thats why Im here; thats why I can help you.Theyre all holed up together, the three of them.Clustered around the deranged one calling himself Roy Baty.Hell be masterminding their crucial, all out, final defense.Her lips twisted.Jesus, she said.Cheer up, he said; he cupped her sharp, small chin in the palm of his hand, lifted her head so that she had to face him.I wonder what its like to kiss an android, he said to himself.Leaning forward an inch he kissed her dry lips.No reaction followed; Rachael remained impassive.As if unaffected.And yet he sensed otherwise.Or perhaps it was wishful thinking.I wish, Rachael said, that I had known that before I came.I never would have flown down here.I think youre asking too much.You know what I have?Toward this Pris android?Empathy, he said.Something like that.Identification; there goes I.  My god; maybe thats whatll happen.In the confusion youll retire me, not her.And she can go back to Seattle and live my life.I never felt this way before.We are machines, stamped out like bottle caps.Its an illusion that IIpersonaryreally exist; Im just representative of a type.She shuddered.He could not help being amused; Rachael had become so mawkishly morose.Ants dont feel like that, he said, and theyre physically identical.Ants.They dont feel period.Identical human twins.They dont  But they identify with each other; I understand they have an empathic, special bond.Rising, she got to the bourbon bottle, a little unsteadily; she refilled her glass and again drank swiftly.For a time she slouched about the room, brows knitted darkly, and then, as if sliding his way by chance, she settled back onto the bed; she swung her legs up and stretched out, leaning against the fat pillows.And sighed.Forget the three andys.Her voice filled with weariness.Im so worn out, from the trip I guess.And from all I learned today.I just want to sleep.She shut her eyes.If I die, she murmured, maybe Ill be born again when the Rosen Association stamps out its next unit of my subtype.She opened her eyes and glared at him ferociously.Do you know, she said, why I really came here?Why Eldon and the other Rosensthe human oneswanted me to go along with you?To observe, he said.To detail exactly what the Nexus does that gives it away on the Voigt Kampff test.On the test or otherwise.Everything that gives it a different quality.And then I report back and the association makes modifications of its zygote bath DNS factors.And we then have the Nexus 7.And when that gets caught we modify it again and eventually the association has a type that cant be distinguished.Do you know of the Boneli Reflex Arc Test?he asked.Were working on the spinal ganglia, too.Someday the Boneli test will fade into yesterdays hoary shroud of spiritual oblivion.She smiled innocuouslyat variance with her words.At this point he could not discern her degree of seriousness.A topic of world shaking importance, yet dealt with facetiously; an android trait, possibly, he thought.No emotional awareness, no feeling sense of the actual meaning of what she said.Only the hollow, formal, intellectual definitions of the separate terms.And, more, Rachael had begun to tease him.Imperceptibly she had passed from lamenting her condition to taunting him about his.Damn you, he said.Rachael laughed.Im drunk.I cant go with you.If leave here She gestured in dismissal.Ill stay behind and steep and you can tell me later what happened.Except, he said, there wont be a later because Roy Baty will nail me.But I cant help you anyhow now because Im drunk.Anyhow, you know the truth, the brick hard, irregular, slithery surface of truth.Im just an observer and I wont intervene to save you; I dont care if Roy Baty nails you or not.I care whether I get nailed.She opened her eyes round and wide.Christ, Im empathic about myself.And, see, if I go to that suburban broken down conapt building She reached out, toyed with a button of his shirt; in slow, facile twists she began unbuttoning it.I dont dare go because androids have no loyalty to one another and I know that that goddamn Pris Stratton will destroy me and occupy my place.See?Take off your coat.Why?So we can go to bed, Rachael said.I bought a black Nubian goat, he said.I have to retire the three more andys.I have to finish up my job and go home to my wife.He got up, walked around the bed to the bottle of bourbon.Standing there he carefully poured himself a second drink; his hands, he observed, shook only very slightly.Probably from fatigue.Both of us, he realized, are tired.Too tired to hunt down three andys, with the worst of the eight calling the shots.Standing there he realized, all at once, that he had acquired an overt, incontestable fear directed toward the principal android.It all hung on Batyhad hung on it from the start.Up to now he had encountered and retired progressively more ominous manifestations of Baty.Now came Baty itself.Thinking that he felt the fear grow; it snared him completely, now that he had let it approach his conscious mind.I cant go without you now, he said to Rachael.I cant even leave here.Polokov came after me; Garland virtually came after me.You think Roy Baty will look you up?Setting down her empty glass she bent forward, reached back, and unfastened her bra.With agility she slid it from her, then stood, swaying, and grinning because she swayed.In my purse, she said, I have a mechanism which our autofac on Mars builds as an emer She grimaced.An emergency safety thingamajing,  jig, while theyre putting a newly made andy through its routine inspection checks.Get it out.It resembles an oyster.Youll see it.He began hunting through the purse.Like a human woman, Rachael had every class of object conceivable filched and hidden away in her purse; he found himself rooting interminably.Meanwhile, Rachael kicked off her boots and unzipped her shorts; balancing on one foot she caught the discarded fabric with her toe and tossed it across the room.She then dropped onto the bed, roiled over to fumble for her glass, accidently pushed the glass to the carpeted floor.Damn, she said, and once again got shakily to her feet; in her underpants she stood watching him at work on her purse, and then, with careful deliberation and attention she drew the bedcovers back, got in, drew the covers over her.Is this it?He held up a metallic sphere with a button stem projecting.That cancels an android into catalepsy, Rachael said, her eyes shut.For a few seconds.Suspends its respiration; yours, too, but humans can function without respiringperspiring?for a couple of minutes, but the vagus nerve of an andy  I know.He straightened up.The android autonomic nervous system isnt as flexible at cutting in and out as ours.But as you say, this wouldnt work for more than five or six seconds.Long enough, Rachael murmured, to save your life.So, see She roused herself, sat up in the bed.If Roy Baty shows up here you can be holding that in your hand and you can press the stem on that thing.And while Roy Baty is frozen stiff with no air supply to his blood and his brain cells deteriorating you can kill Roy Baty with your laser.You have a laser tube, he said.In your purse.A fake.Androidsshe yawned, eyes again shutarent permitted to carry lasers.He walked over to the bed.Squirming about, Rachael managed to roll over at last onto her stomach, face buried in the white lower sheet.This is a clean, noble, virgin type of bed, she stated.Only clean, noble girls who She pondered.Androids cant bear children, she said, then.Is that a loss?He finished undressing her.Exposed her pale, cold loins.Is it a loss?Rachael repeated.I dont really know; I have no way to tell.How does it feel to have a child?How does it feel to be born, for that matter?Were not born; we dont grow up; instead of dying from illness or old age we wear out like ants.Ants again; thats what we are.Not you; I mean me.Chitinous reflex machines who arent really alive.She twisted her head to one side, said loudly, Im not alive!Youre not going to bed with a woman.Dont be disappointed; okay?Have you ever made love to an android before?No, he said, taking off his shirt and tie.I understandthey tell meits convincing if you dont think too much about it.But if you think too much, if you reflect on what youre doingthen you cant go on.For ahem physiological reasons.Bending, he kissed her bare shoulder.Thanks, Rick, she said wanly.Remember, though: dont think about it, just do it.Dont pause and be philosophical, because from a philosophical standpoint its dreary.For us both.He said, Afterward I still intend to look for Roy Baty.I still need you to be there.I know that laser tube you have in your purse is  You think Ill retire one of your andys for you;  I think in spite of what you said youll help me all you can.Otherwise you wouldnt be lying there in that bed.I love you, Rachael said.If I entered a room and found a sofa covered with your hide Id score very high on the Voigt Kampff test.Tonight sometime, he thought as he clicked off the bedside light, I will retire a Nexus 6 which looks exactly like this naked girl.My good god, he thought; Ive wound up where Phil Resch said.Go to bed with her first, he remembered.Then kill her.I cant do it, he said, and backed away from the bed.I wish you could, Rachael said.Her voice wavered.Not because of you.Because of Pris Stratton; what I have to do to her.Were not the same.I dont can about Pris Stratton.Listen.Rachael thrashed about in the bed, sitting up; in the gloom he could dimly make out her almost breastless, trim shape.Go to bed with me and Ill retire Stratton.Okay?Because I cant stand getting this close and then  Thank you, he said; gratitudeundoubtedly because of the bourbonrose up inside him, constricting his throat.Two, he thought.I now have only two to retire; just the Batys.Would Rachael really do it?Evidently.Androids thought and functioned that way.Yet he had never come across anything quite like this.Goddamn it, get into bed, Rachael said.He got into bed.17  Afterward they enjoyed a great luxury: Rick had room service bring up coffee.He sat for a long time within the arms of a green, black, and gold leaf lounge chair, sipping coffee and meditating about the next few hours.Rachael, in the bathroom, squeaked and hummed and splashed in the midst of a hot shower.You made a good deal when you made that deal, she called when she had shut off the water; dripping, her hair tied up with a rubber band, she appeared bare and pink at the bathroom door.We androids cant control our physical, sensual passions.You probably knew that; in my opinion you took advantage of me.She did not, however, appear genuinely angry.If anything she had become cheerful and certainly as human as any girl he had known.Do we really have to go track down those three andys tonight?Yes, he said.Two for me to retire, he thought; one for you.As Rachael put it, the deal had been made.Gathering a giant white bath towel about her, Rachael said, Did you enjoy that?Yes.Would you ever go to bed with an android again?If it was a girl.If she resembled you.Rachael said, Do you know what the lifespan of a humanoid robot such as myself is?Ive been in existence two years.How long do you calculate I have?After a hesitation he said, About two more years.They never could solve that problem.I mean cell replacement.Perpetual or anyhow semi perpetual renewal.Well, so it goes.Vigorously she began drying herself.Her face had become expressionless.Im sorry, Rick said.Hell, Rachael said, Im sorry I mentioned it.Anyhow it keeps humans from running off and living with an android.And this is true with you Nexus 6 types too?Its the metabolism.Not the brain unit.She trotted out, swept up her underpants, and began to dress.He, too, dressed.Then together, saying little, the two of them journeyed to the roof field, where his hovercar had been parked by the pleasant white clad human attendant.As they headed toward the suburbs of San Francisco, Rachael said, Its a nice night.My goat is probably asleep by now, he said.Or maybe goats are nocturnal.Some animals never sleep.Sheep never do, not that I could detect; whenever you look at them theyre looking back.Expecting to be fed.What sort of wife do you have?He did not answer.Do you  If you werent an android, Rick interrupted, if I could legally marry you, I would.Rachael said, Or we could live in sin, except that Im not alive.Legally youre not.But really you are.Biologically.Youre not made out of transistorized circuits like a false animal; youre an organic entity.And in two years, he thought, youll wear out and die.Because we never solved the problem of cell replacement, as you pointed out.So I guess it doesnt matter anyhow.This is my end, he said to himself.As a bounty hunter.After the Batys there wont be any more.Not after this, tonight.You look so sad, Rachael said.Putting his hand out he touched her cheek.Youre not going to be able to hunt androids any longer, she said calmly.So dont look sad.Please.He stared at her.No bounty bunter ever has gone on, Rachael said.After being with me.Except one.A very cynical man.Phil Resch.And hes nutty; he works out in left field on his own.I see, Rick said.
