Spanish Dancer, Baptist, Duck, Toweller, all but Dub and Rooftop, which looked on without a scrap of comprehension, went through what sounded like agonies.They didnt all call out or scream, but all of them in different ways seemed as if they were dying.YlSib was alarmed, but seemed neither Bren nor I were surprised by what we heard: the noise of old ways coming off in scabs.Pangs of something finishing, and of birth.Everything changes now: I thought that very explicitly, each word.I thought: Now theyre seeing things.In the beginning was each word of Language, sound isomor phic with some Real: not a thought, not really, only self expressed worldness, speaking itself through the Ariekei.Language had always been redundant: it had only ever been the world.Now the Ariekei were learning to speak, and to think, and it hurt.Shouldnt we...?Yl said, and had nothing with which to finish it.The said was now not as it is.What they spoke now werent things or moments anymore but the thoughts of them, pointings at; meaning no longer a flat facet of essence; signs ripped from what they signed.It took the lie to do that.With that spiral of assertion abnegation came quiddities, and the Ariekei became themselves.They were worldsick, as meanings yawed.Anything was anything, now.Their minds were sudden merchants: metaphor, like money, equalised the incommensurable.They could be mythologers now: theyd never had monsters, but now the world was all chimeras, each metaphor a splicing.The citys a heart, I said, and in that a heart and a city were sutured into a third thing, a heartish city, and cities are heart stained, and hearts are city stained too.No wonder it made them sick.They were like new vampires, retaining memories while they sloughed off lives.Theyd never be cured.They went quiet one by one, and not because their crisis ended.They were in a new world.It was the world we live in.YOU HAVE TO show the others, I said to Spanish Dancer.Rudely interrupted its birth.It deserved a different passage but we had no time.It listened in its queasy awe and newness.The deaf ones.You can talk to them.They think theyre beyond language at all, but you, you can show them what theyve done.Language was never possible.We never spoke in one voice.In the sun, we saw figures kilometres off.Humans rattling slowly towards us.Small ships went overhead, heading back toward the city.Look, Bren said.That ones wounded.As we got closer we could see that there werent many Terre, maybe thirty or forty, hauling equipment or urging on slapdash looking biorigging, rocking in cars.We saw them see us, and for a moment they seemed to be preparing weapons.Then they calmed.They must have seen this lot first, Bren said of the Ariekei with us.Thought it was an attack.But with us here they think were an Embassytown squad.Theyre plantation staff.Wilderness dwellers who had only now cleared their homesteads and outland farmfactories.Theyd been in the path of the Language less army and lost their nerve as the Absurd came at their lands killing all the humans they met and tearing their houses to the ground, murdering or recruiting the country Ariekei alongside which the Terre had lived.More boats went overhead.They would probably not look long enough to see the Ariekei in our party, or that we were heading in the wrong direction.In fact they wouldnt notice us at all: they were busy returning to the city.Several of the vessels, I could see, were bleeding.Spanish Dancer whispered, called the humans things it couldnt have called them before.It was paying close attention, as it had for hours, to our captive.We avoided the refugees.Depending how fast the Absurd are going, Bren said, well reach them tomorrow or the next day.Probably the next daywhat is that, Muhamday, Ioday?None of us had any idea.What about the Embassytowners?Weve avoided them.I think we went past them.Theyll still be stationed.Especially He pointed at the sky.You saw the boats.The scoutsve been wounded.EzCal knows they cant win.Theyll have Ariekei and Terre at the front trying to negotiate.Yeah, theyre not going to succeed, though, Yl said.They wont, Bren said.How can they?They dont think the same at all.Spanish understands what we have to do, I said.Have you seen how its being with the captive?It knows they are thinking the same, now.That theyre both thinking.IT WAS A VERY new ecosystem to us, there with the sparse trees, where we watched Spanish and the other Ariekei work.Here the key predator was not the , with its big, nearly immobile body and limbs that could reach fast and far through trees, but fast that hunted by night.Vaguely related to the Ariekei themselves, the rear two limbs of the bipedal were ferocious weapons, as, of a more manipulable kind, was the arm that corresponded to the giftwing.fanwings were immobile.They peered through the dark with eyes attuned to motion.They were social hunters.They worked in concert to corral the dog sized prey animals of the plain.We were too large for them to come for us, but they still watched.Flying things skittered at our torches: burrowing eaters of phosphorescent rot, used to honing in on glowing ground, emerged and gnawed confused at the pooled light.We didnt take the leash off our prisonerwe didnt trust it or know how to decide if it became trustable.But wed been treating it with less fear for days, and did so with even less now.The new ex Host liars regarded it, and whispered to each other in words theyd used countless times, that now did very different things.By early morning something was changing.The Ariekei were circling the captive.It wasnt gasping or lunging at them, or at me, or Bren or YlSib: it was watching us, and watching the other Ariekei.28  SPANISH DANCER and our captive circled.The others ringed them.Every few seconds one of the two would shove out its giftwing like a knife fighter looking for an opening.It would sketch out some outline in the air: there would be a pause and the other would follow suit.Spanishs fanwing frilled open and shut.The Languagelesss stub trembled.The gesticulations were information, motion telegrams.Talking.They didnt understand each other but they knew there was something to understand.And that was liberation.When they did make communicationsomething ridiculous, Spanish throwing a pulpy bud then pointing into the muttering wildlife where it lay, and the Absurd picking it uptheir euphoria, even alien, was palpable.Signifying Spanish could speak through gesture now.For our captive that no longer had a name, perhaps the strangeness was greater.It had thought that without words, it had no language.Its comrades communicated with each other, never knowing they did, not across the chasm with untorn Ariekei; and mostly what they expressed to each other was the very hopelessness that made them believe they were incommunicado.But in the panic of the attack and our escape, it had understood shove and point instructions to flee.It had watched Bren, YlSib and me speak and listen to each other with gestures for stress and clarity.The rest of the Absurd army never had to reflect on these behaviours.Spanish had learnt it could speak without speaking: the Absurd had learnt that it could speak, and listen, at all.They were yanking it around, Bren said.It was impossible for it not to know what they meant: they were shoving it and pointing the same way.They madeit obey them.Maybe you need violence for language to take.Bren, I said.Thats crap.We were all running the same way.We were all trying to get out.We had the same intentions.Thats how it knew what we were doing.He shook his head.Formally, he said, Language is the continuation of coercion by other means.Bullshit.Its cooperation.Both theories explained what had happened plausibly.I resisted, because it felt trite, saying that they werent as contradictory as they sounded.Look, I said.Pointed above the horizon.There was smoke, stains in the sky.IT CANT BE, Bren said, as if to himself, as we moved as fast as we could.They were going to wait.He said it more than once.When specks appeared far off on the lichened downs, we pretended that there were many things they might be, until we came too close to deny that they were bodies.We looked down an incline to the aftermath of war.Thousands of metres of remains.I was breathing very hard, through my aeoli, in horror.At this distance the specificities of carnage were hard to gauge.I was trying to estimate Terre versus Absurd, but the death was too tangled.In any case, many of the Ariekene corpses I saw must be EzCals forces, like the humans with which they lay.We led our not quite captive.It was in its collar but we hadnt shocked it for kilometres.Spanish Dancer drummed its hoofs.It looked at me and opened its mouths.It pointed at the ruination.It opened and closed its mouths and said to me:   Yes..Yes.Too late.We had not taught it that..STRUNG OUT, artificially, druggedly alert, there was an unpleasant drag to my senses, as if things I saw or heard left residue when I turned from them.My aeoli mask in a rare reminder of its biorigged life shifted, uncomfortable at the smell of the dead.Everywhere were men and women burst open.There were Ariekei dead with fanwings and without, strewn together.Innards evolved on opposite ends of space alloyed in compound decay.There were corpse fires and rubbish.Wrecks.The aftermath was scored by lines of char culminated in craters, where fliers had come down.Bren sifted through junk, hands wrapped in rags.I copied him.It wasnt quite so hard as Id expected.This had all happened perhaps two days before.These scenes made me careful and cold.I didnt look too close at the faces of the scores of Embassytowner dead.I was too certain Id see one I knew.Picking through remnants between those smoke pillars I tried to learn the history of the fight.There were many more Embassytown and city dead than Absurd.Fighters lay mid action, in mouldering stasis, hands and giftwings and weapons still on each other.We read these corpse dioramas for the stories of their creation.They have corvids, I said.Strategising without speech, the Absurd were driving biorigged weapons.Jesus, I said.Jesus its an army, I mean its an army.Shockingly few combatants were left alive.A few mortally wounded Ariekei cycled their legs in the air, craning eyes.One cried out in Language, telling us that it was wounded.Spanish Dancer touched its giftwing.The Absurd moribund were dying with too much focus to notice us.On some I saw the bleed from fanwings newly excisedthere were new recruits to that force even among the dying.Pinioned under Ariekene dead was a woman still just alive, her broken aeoli wheezing oxygen into her.She looked at Bren and me as we tried to calm her and ask her, What happened here?But she only stared, terrified or air starved out of speech.At last we laid her back down and gave her water.We couldnt move her; her aeoli was dying.We found two others alive: one man couldnt be woken; the other was conscious only of his impending death.All we got from him was that the Absurd had come.Bren indicated ripped uniforms.These are specialists.He pointed at runnels out of the battlefield.This wasnt...These were outriders, this was a guard group, around something, that came in first.The negotiators, I said.He nodded slowly at me.Of course, yes.The negotiators.This was supposed to be a bloody parley.They gave it a try.My God.He looked at the remnants around us.The Languageless didnt even slow.And now theyre heading for the rest.For the main mass of the Terre Ariekei army.WE HAD TO double back.We took an abandoned vehicle, cleaned the mess of war out of it.We sped along the cut through the marks of thousands of hooves.I was pressed against the Ariekei.Spanish and Baptist were crowding around the Absurd.They were sketching marks in the air, and the captive, if I could still describe it so, was doing the same.It wasnt long before we saw a line of figures.Bren stiffened.I knew how weak our plan was, but we had no choice.Its alright, I said.Theyre Terre.A big, dirty derelict band, dressed like penitents, a trudging little town.There were children among them.They looked at us through their masks.They were as intense as monks, too.Some backed away, muttered among themselves.A few temporary leaders came closer, and a few soldiers, refugee from that ruination, in scorched uniforms.The Ariekei stayed back.They kept the self deafened close, disguised its injury.The humans told us theyd run from the depredations of the Absurd, from pioneer homesteads and bio rigging farms.This was everyone running: theyd found each other.Been joined by the AWOL and soldiers from defeated units.They were behind their attackers now, were following them to the city, like those prey fish that seek safety in their predators wake.They had no plans, only the vague sense that this might keep them alive a few days longer.Their passage in the tracks of the enemy was a despairing homage to their own defeat.A militia man told us, We were with Ariekei.Leaders.The most eloquent, I suppose.There to communicate.We were there to protect them, the negotiators, give them space, time, when they were trying to get through to...The soldiers had been instructed to do whatever was necessary while the Ariekene speakers struggled to make the Absurd understand them.They were trying to talk to them.How?I said.No how.I thought hed said know how and didnt understand.There was no how, he said.We wondered.We could see the Absurd coming; they had fliers and weapons and vehicles, and there were thousands of them.We wondered what it was the Ariekei were planning.What theyd cooked up.It was only, Jesus...They got ready by listening to EzCal on datchip.A couple of us in the unit understand Language...He paused at that inadvertent present tense....They told me what EzCal was saying, in the recordings.You must make them understand.Again and again.In all different ways.You must speak to them so they understand you.The man shook his head.Thats what they got high on.When the Absurd came, they shouted at them through loudspeakers.But theyre deaf, I said.He shrugged.The wind sent his greasy hair rippling from under his battered helmet.We sent some of them out to meet...the enemy...close.Their plan must have been...Well, the Absurd just came through them.To us.Thered been no plan at all.I looked at Bren.Thered been no secret strategy: only the knowledge of what had to happen, with no idea how.They tried to do it by fiat, Bren said.The god drug had hoped their ineluctable instructions would carry this.What despairing deity.Jesus, I said.Do you think they thought it would work?There were a lot of dead back there.Where are the rest of your army?I said.EzCals army?The man shook his head.Most of them...us...never wanted to fight, he said.They wanted to beg.But they cant even.Beg.Cant make them hear.Theyre retreating back to the city.Getting behind the blockades.He shook his head slowly.Those wont stop them, he said.There was nothing between the Absurd army and the city, and Embassytown.The refugees watched us go.Told us it was in the wrong direction and shrugged when we ignored them.They gestured goodbye and good luck with a kind of dead politeness, a strange courtesy.At the edges of the mass, those most monkish ones watched us with hostility Im certain most of them couldnt have explained.We travelled in their hoof churnings, and stalked the Absurd from just beyond their sight.From thickets, from behind rises.It rained.We sprayed muck.It didnt seem to get very dark that night; it was as if the stars and Wreck were shining unnaturally, so I could lean against Spanish Dancer and watch it sketch hand signs with the Ariekes that was no longer a prisoner, and I could see the grey landscape.When dawn came, there were a few cams around us, gadding spastically.Intel gatherers for the army, still transmitting.Our sound and motion attracted them, and they paced with us in a flitting corona.I looked straight into the lens of one, through the air to someone watching in Embassytown.We could hear the Absurd, now.They were just one segment of landscape over.The cams swarmed suddenly away, over flora and geography.A corvid flew close overhead on some frantic wartime job, and we had to hope it had not seen us, that we wouldnt be eradicated, so close.THERE WERE NO secret ways we could ensure a smaller group of Absurd would find us, no ways we could split one section of their expedition from the others.Each Languageless thought itself alone, though we knew that wasnt true.The closest this huge vengeful mass would have to generals would be its unspeaking vanguard.We passed their flank, hidden by landscape, and made our way to a place theyd find us.Finally, stinking in our suits, we left the vehicle.I was strongly conscious of what a scene we must have been.Four Terre.Me at the front.Behind me Bren, tense and ready.The marks of the journey had made YlSib easy to tell apart.They stood beside each other, each with a weapon poised.The Ariekei.Ranged in a curve around us, as if they made up our groups fanwing.Spanish Dancer was closest to me, and watched me with several of its eyes.At the centre of the group stood the untethered Languageless.The thing that was no longer our enemy looked from one to another of its Ariekene companions.It made a motion with its giftwing.One by one most of the other Ariekei responded in a similar way.It made me a bit breathless to see.There were two that didnt.Dub and Rooftop watched the motions of their companions.Nothing they could understand was occurring.Spanish Dancer said to me: .I stared a while, and at last nodded.You will, I said.We will.They will., it said.Two noises came out of it that meant nothing to me.It said something rapidly in Language, and its companions, and Yl and Sib and Bren looked up sharply.tried again., it said to me.I was silent.What could I say?THE FIRST OF the Absurd came.Fliers squalled over the country, must have seen us, but perhaps decided that we were too nothing to be blown away.A loose, fast moving posse of tireless Absurd became visible, moving toward us.We braced.Someone said something about the plan.Those at the front of the army, the groups a kilometre or so ahead of the main force, saw us.They stampeded up the scree and at us, pointing giftwings, directing segments of their own crowd, which peeled off into wedge shapes, flanked us, in the unsaid strategy they thought merely rage.I could hear their hoofbeats.Then I could see the shades of their skins, the craned forks of their eyes, the flanges of their fanwing stubs, as they raised weapons.Now, someone said, and I truly couldnt say if it was me.Spanish said something too quiet for me to quite hear, that I dont think was in Language.It walked forward with the other leaders of its revolutionary group and the Absurd came with them.It went farther, stepped out and raised its giftwing and the stalk of its fanwing, so its injury was plain.It waved them like standards.It announced its statusIm one of youand urged its comrades to stop, gestured to all the incomers, wait, wait, wait, wait.The Absurd army didnt slow at all.I felt sick.Courage, Bren said, in French.I did not smile.The inchoate motion language the fanwingless spoke was camouflaged by shared purpose.From their untidy ranks came a shot.Jesus, I said.Spanish Dancer, , spoke with its voice and hands as its once fellows approached to murder or brutalise it.I wondered what would happen to it if it were deafened now, now that language was different for it.Spanishs and the Absurds motions registered to the enemy as little as windblown plants.Theyre not ignoring, I thought.They dont know.They didnt know that these minds werent like the others theyd finished or changed, how could they?I dug among our packs.Show your fanwings!I shouted to Spanish.Show them you can hear!YlSib began to translate, but Spanish was already unfurling, and the others were copying it, except for Dub and Rooftop, who did so only when Spanish told them to in Language.Another missile came close.Tell Dub and Rooftop to get in front, I said.I made a datchip play, and the thin voice of EzCal exhorted us to something or other.But every one of the Ariekei had already heard that speech so did not react to it, and I cursed and threw it away.Oh, said Bren.He understood.I fumbled again while the Absurd came close enough that I could hear their murder croons.I spilled a handful of chips and finally got another to sound.EzCal said, We are going to tell you what it is that you must do...We Terre heard it as sound.Spanish Dancer and the others heard it too, now, as sound: they just cocked their fanwings quizzically.But Dub and Rooftop were still addicts.They snapped upright, shuddered so elementally it was as if gravity took them toward the source of the voice.They glazed.Yes, said Bren.I played another.Dub and Rooftop were swaying, recovering from EzCals first words; jerked giddily they were caught up again.Rooftop shouted at what was, I realised, EzCals descriptions of trees.Our self defeaned Ariekes kept waving at the others, and Spanish and the others mimicked it, their own fanwings opening and closing, and in the middle of them all Dub and Rooftop lost themselves.I kept the sound going., said Spanish, and I could think how horrible the sight of that powerless staggering must be to it, reminding it what it had been, making it watch its friends suffering in compulsion, but I wouldnt cease.As the first of the Absurd crested our rise and came towards us, weapons up, first one, then more, then many, hesitated.I pressed another chip and heard Bren say yes.Every army has one soldier at its very front.A big Ariekes, its Cut  and Turn mouths open as if it were howling, picking its feet high as it came for us.I was holding out a datchip as if it might stop it.Its eyes spread in all directions, one for each of us, watching Spanish, and the Ariekes that had been our captive jerking its arms as the Absurd did to each other, and Dub and Rooftop stumbling.If I was thinking anything I was praying.It was very close.Abruptly the soldier stopped.It lowered its sputtering mace.It involuted its eyes, opened them again and watched us.I was still playing EzCals voice.It wasnt the only motionless one, now.As if I were merciless, I made Dub and Rooftop dance their addiction.The Absurd gripped each other, gestured or stood still, watching.Dont stop, said Bren., said Spanish, and Bren said again, Dont.What...?said Sib.What is it?said Yl.The army of hopeless and enraged had been driven to murder by their memories of addiction, and the sight of their compatriots made craven to the words of an interloper species.That degradation was the horizon of their despair.Id made them see the motions of their ex selves hearing their god drug there was no mistaking that tarantellabut that other Ariekei had fanwings unfurled, could hear, but were unaffected.There wasnt supposed to be such a thing as uncertainty in the minds of the Absurd.Its sudden arrival arrested them.Our ex captive waved its giftwing and its stump.Stop, it was saying, and many in the army that faced us knew that it was saying so, and were stunned to know that they knew it.Poor Rooftop, I thought, poor Dub.Ariekene dust coiled around me and I blinked.Thank God they never learnt to lie.Wed needed real addicts, to prove that the others were free, and the rage of the Absurd therefore misdirected.I kept Dub and Rooftop moving.I made them sick on god drug.Spanish Dancer watched them, fanned its fanwing.I was shouting.INFORMATION MOVED desperately slowly among the Absurd even their quickest thinkers still had only a tenuous understanding that they could transmit information.What they said to each other at first with their waving and upheld limbs was simple: Dont attack.Following that: Something is happening.The information was discombobulated with distance, moving backwards through the rank.At the front, gestures got close to: They can hear but are not addicted.Farther back, ranks of the Absurd told those behind them simply: Stop., said Spanish.Our Deaf went to the front of the army, and Spanish went with it.With the Absurd generals watching, the two of themostentatiously, in wing signs and sigils scraped in the earth, ideograms that startled mestarted to talk.THERE WERE MANY many hours, two days and nights of frustration and silences, while the army waited.Hesitated.Individuals kept coming up from the ranks to see what was happening.Every one that did was astonished: unaddicted Ariekei; Terre waiting respectfully; the process of slow dawning between hearing and Absurd, as we still questionably called them; scrawls in dirt.Those with a little knowledge became agents of patience among the others.We could see their influence, by whatever gestural persuasions, when, toward the end of the second day, human refugees approached from the armys flank, easily killable, but the fanwingless didnt assault them.The Terre must have realised that the Absurd had stopped, wondered at the strange calm and come to find its source, and the Languageless had let them.The refugees set up camp a way away from us, and watched.It took a time before the boundary of comprehension between Absurd and s group, the New Hearing, was more fully breached, but nothing like so long as Id once have expected.We werent teaching the deafened to communicate: we were showing them they already could, and did.It wasnt incremental but revelatory; and revelations, though hard won, are viral.We need EzCal here, I said.They wont come if they know whats happened, Bren said.If they know that theyve lost.Even if it means the end of the war?But I knew he was right.Well then we cant tell them the truth.We see any vespcams we smash them.They cant know whats happened.TOWELLER AND BAPTIST understood the mission we gave them.They wouldnt have done a few days before.They returned to the city in a flyer with the Absurd.They know what they have to do?I said to Spanish Dancer..Theyd sneak back in the wounded ship, take on the roles of loyal addict soldiers, bringing news of a breakthrough.Theyd tell EzCal that the Absurd had stopped, were just waiting, and that the god drug and their entourage must come.It couldnt occur to EzCal that they were being lied to.That was what we were relying on.How could it?They would, after all, hear it from Ariekei, in what they would think was Language.Say it like a Host.They know what to do when EzCal speaks to them?.They knew to seem as if it swept them over.They know to ask for them to speak, if too long goes by without?.They knew to mimic the addiction.They knew what they had to do.The two different tribes of post Language Ariekei shared symbols.The human refugees made no attempt to come closer.Did we do it?I said.Surrounded by semiosis, Dub at last juddered and abruptly achieved change and withdrawal, apropos of nothing I saw, gasping and speaking newly.Its companions watched its unexpected transcendence or fall.Rooftop, though, couldnt reach it.It dosed itself with the last of the datchips.It was the only addict left among us.I dont know what the parameters of friendship were among the Ariekei, but I think that they must all have been sad.And Rooftop, as its name was, must have been lonely.It watched the scratch and gesture conversations around it, and I thought that being surrounded by the changed must be, for it, like a mild hell.You did save us, I thought at it.Without you wed have died.As if that could comfort it.EVERY DAY Spanish told me of the progress.When I consider what it was that actually happened, what the Absurd and the New Hearing achieved, it took no time at all.I dont know how many days of camping among these silent discussions it had been when I realised that there were cams watching us, eddying nervously in the wind.But I knew we were past ready.Jesus, I said, and pointed them out to Bren.Christ Pharotekton.I stood below the cams, gesturing at them like newly expressive Ariekei, beckoning them.They were scouts from a school around EzCals ship.It couldnt be far: theyd come, following the directions and promises of Toweller and Baptist.Some vespcams seemed to want to shy away; others focused on us.It was too late for the god drug to turn back now, block transmissions, pretend ignorance, even if they understood what they were seeing.The feeds from those little lenses were being watched not only in the oncoming ship, but by thousands of Embassytowners.Listen, I shouted, and was aware of many Ariekene eyes on me.The lenses scudded, anxious midges, came a little lower.Listen to me, I said and grit my teeth in the wind.Listen to me.They mustve been wondering what the delay was, Bren said.What was keeping the Absurd.How long have they been waiting?Hiding, waiting to die, wondering whats the hold up.Listen, I said.Get them here.Get EzCal here now.I pointed at Spanish Dancer, at the fanwingless to which it spoke, and first Spanish, then one by one all the hundreds of Absurd, pointed at me.The cams buzzed, changing positions, and I kept my eyes on one fixed point, as if the little swarm were one entity into whose eye I stared.Get them here now.EzCal...Can you see me, EzCal?I jabbed my hand.Cal, get here now and bring your fucking sidekick with you.You get to live, so spread the word.Embassytown, can you hear me?You get to live.But you better get here and find out what you have to do, EzCal.Because there are some conditions.29  ILL GIVE EZCAL THIS.When they didnt speak, when they stood to look out over the ridge down kilometres of country and the camp town of the Absurd, they looked epic.They didnt deserve it.Theyd come to affect baroque: perhaps it was a comfort to some Embassytowners.There were trims of glitter on Cals clothes, a crest on his aeoli mask.Even Ez wore purple.In silence their failings were transmuted, or camouflaged at least.Cals sneer passed for regal: Ezs sulking a thoughtful reserve.They had a small entourage: people who had recently been my colleagues.Some greeted me and Bren when their flier landed.Simmon shook my hand.Southel had come, and MagDa.I couldnt describe their expressions.Wyatt was with them, still guarded, it seemed, but consulted, great operator, prisoner vizier.He didnt meet my eye.Baptist and Toweller stepped down, back from Embassytown, greeted their companions.Greeted me.The Embassytowners watched them, in what must have been great shock.This journey hadnt turned out as expected.The officers whod come had weapons.I know that if the situation had been a little different, EzCal might have tried to have them kill us, as theyd tried to kill us when we travelled.Now, though, the remnants of the Staff in their pointless retinue and the officers and even JasMin, who were there, wouldnt let them.By now everyone in Embassytown had seen the incoming army, and my transmission, and everyone knew that we had stopped them.All Cal had for a last few hours was the pretence that he ruled.Those Terre refugees had come closer day on day: they were mingling with us now, though mostly all they did was watch our interactions with the Absurd.Ez looked into the sky, and back across the distance toward Embassytown.Much later Id hear stories of his actions during my travels: how hed contrived to test Cals patience; the plans for what could only be considered a coup, which Cal had crushed more in contempt than anger.Ez eyed us.I could see him calculating.Jesus do you never stop?I thought.I didnt give a shit about his story.To Embassytown and the Languageless, Ez and Cals squabbles were vastly less important than that they were EzCal.I stood with delegates from the Absurd army, twenty or thirty thrown up from the ranks.So its you Im talking to, is it, Avice Benner Cho?Cal said coolly.You speak for...He indicated the fanwingless closest to me, our erstwhile captive.Theuth, I said.It goes by Theuth.What do you mean it goes by Theuth, he said.It doesnt go by anything....We call it Theuth, I said.So thats what it goes by.Ill show you how to write that down.Or better, Theuth will.BAD ENOUGH to be defeated, isnt it?Even now youd try to take us out, Cal: me, Bren, the rest of us.Because the way we saved Embassytown means the end of your reign, as it has, look, ended; and even though your whole damn prefecture was a function of despair and collapse, youd rather lose it on your terms than be saved on ours.That was what I wanted to say.There were Absurd with Theuth and Spanish, those most adept at the generation of the ideogrammatic script they were inventing, the most intuitive at the reading and performing of gestures.It wasnt a stable group.Even a few brave Ariekene addicts had arrived, too, come all the way from the city subsisting on pilfered datchips, to see the historic agreement, the change.Rooftop was there, playing its own sound files to itself in sadness.Human runaways squatted on overlooking ledges coloured with Ariekene mottled moulds, and watched the negotiations.They came and went as they wanted.Cal, perhaps Ez too, tried to depict what was happening as protracted discussion.Really it was just a slow process of explaining facts, and receiving orders, in a nascent script.What took days was making sure the Absurd understood, and understanding what they wanted us to do about it.Youve no authority, I could have said to Cal.This is a surrender.Youd love a bit of pomp: that way in later years you might invoke end of empire ghosts.But youre just here because I told the Absurd you were the one theyd have to tell what to do.And the humans watching, the refugees scowling under their cowls, are going to remember how its obvious that you dont know whats happening.Youre doing a lot of hanging around during this particular change of epoch, because youre only a detail.CAMS WENT EVERYWHERE.There were a proliferation of independent home rigged kits, or those hijacked or gone rogue and uploading their feeds to whatever frequencies they could.Embassytown was watching on the other side of all the lenses.At night the Ariekei surrounded my party.We asked them to: I still wasnt certain EzCal wouldnt attempt revenge.Whats going to happen?MagDa said.They looked at me with wariness and respect.Itll be different, I said, but we will be here.Now they  know they can be cured it changes everything.How is it in the city?And in Embassytown?Panic and expectancy.Among the Ariekei it was still mostly confusion.There was fighting between factionstheyd seemed united under EzCals proxy , and obeyed EzCals orders, but now they fought for reasons difficult to make sense of.Welltheylldo everything they can to spread this, I said.No more fixes necessary.Were trying to work together.Theuth mostly speaks for the Languageless now.Spanish is talking to usto YlSib, obviously, but it can even...MagDa hadnt seen Spanish and me in the evenings: talking, haltingly.But I have to tell you something, I said to her quietly.Ive heard how people are describing what this is, and its wrong.There is no cure.Spanish and the others...they might not be addicted anymore but theyre not cured: theyre changed.Thats what this is.I know it might sound the same, but do you understand that they cant speak Language, anymore, MagDa?Anymore than you ever could.IT WAS A MORNING, very cloudless.In the lower lands around me, among the filamented undergrowth of the planet, I knew there were agents of script, disseminating the new skill, the concept of it, among the Absurd.Already there were deviant forms from those first suggested, dissident renditions of ideograms, specialist vocabulary created by the semiogenesis of scuff and point.It wouldnt be long before some Ariekene reader reproduced the ground scratch writing in stain, on something they could hand over, rather than trying to remember and replicate it.Maybe wed show them how.I imagined a pen held in a giftwing.The leading cadre of the Absurd stood still.The Embassy town entourage were as smart as they could manage in these circumstances.Various of the human refugees were watching.Theuth and Spanish stood close to me, looking at the cams.Spanish attracted my attention with its giftwing.It spoke to me softly.I hesitated and it spoke again.EzCal faced me.They looked like kings again.Ezs face was blank: Cals was swollen with anger.Listen.Do you understand?All the Embassytowners could hear me easily, but it was EzCal I was speaking to.Do you understand how its going to be?The Absurd are coming back to the city, and so are we.Well set things up together.Theyll have some ideas.I tell you, if I were Kora Saygiss, your little quisling, Id be careful.It was smart of you not to let it come.Well work out the details.Well be there, in Embassytown.Until the relief.Everythings different, forever, I thought.I glanced at my notes.They were going to kill us because we were the source of god drugs.They knew it was too late for them, they were lost, but they were going to make a totally new start for those after them if they got rid of the problem.Us.You understand how selfless they were?It wouldnt help them.It was for their kids.This generation would either be deafened, dead or dying in withdrawal.But now they know the addicted can be cured.I ignored MagDas stares and pointed at Spanish: it pointed back at me.And if they can be cured then were an irrelevance.That is why we get to live.See?But they have to be cured.Thats the condition.Otherwise were still a sickness.And it takes time to cure oratees.I gestured at Rooftop, still untouched by metaphor.Everyone looked at it.It looked back.And theres plenty of them.So your job is to keep them going in the meantime, EzCal, till they dont need you anymore.Without you to tide them, the addictedll start to die.Too quick to be cured, or even deafened.So you have to keep them alive., Spanish said.There were gasps from all the humans, whod never heard it speak its doubled Anglo Ubiq.Spanish was explaining again why the Absurd would have killed us all and mutilated their compatriots, and why they would now let us live.The Ariekei loved the Ariekei.That verb of ours was the only one that came close.It wasnt flawless, but thats in the way of translation.It was as much a truth as a lie.The New Hearing and the Absurd loved the addicted, and would cure them one of the two ways out, induct them into one group or the other.None of you have been ambassadors for a long time, I said.Whove you been speaking for but yourselves?And now youre not a god or a fix or a functionary, EzCalyoure a factory.The Ariekei have a need: you fulfil it.And believe me, the contentll be policed.Ezs face didnt move.Cals twisted.No chance to issue orders that could, literally, not be disobeyed.The cityll be full of Absurd.So if you try to stir things, put instructions in what you say, even restart the war, theyll stop you.If were too much trouble to bother with, were gone.They dont want to take the fanwings of all the addicted, deafen every single adult Ariekei in their cycle, now theres another way: but they will if they think they have to.Do you see?Theres nothing else for you to do, I thought.You have no choice.Those officers, the ones you brought with you, will hold weapons to your heads and demand you speak Language if necessary.And Ill be with them.Spanish and the Absurd would spread the two cures.Recourse to the knife wasnt the existential catastrophe it had been for all those here, whod thought it ended thought.It would never be relished, but for those who couldnt get clean, it might be considered.Every day, out of love for their afflicted fellows, the Ariekei would make EzCal speak.We were a temporary necessity.Cal looked so stricken I almost felt pity.It wont be so bad.There were many ways we might live, until the ship came.Do you understand?I said, to Cal, to EzCal, and to everyone listening, on the plateau and in Embassytown.I loved the sound of my voice that day.You see why were even alive?You have a job to do., Spanish Dancer said.Somewhere there was a series of human gasps, and I heard someone say, No.Spanish spread its eye coral.Ez looked up, Cal turned.A figure came at us from higher on the hill.A dark cloaked man.He was followed by a few frantic refugees, shouting.His cape gusted.Curious Absurd parted for him, watching what he was doing, and I shouted no but of course they didnt hear.I gesticulated for them to close ranks, but they were new to Terre gestures, and I didnt have time to make them understand.The man pulled out a weapon.Through his stained old aeoli I could see it was Scile.MY HUSBAND AIMED a fat pistol at me.We were all too slow to stop him.Even as he came I stared and as I tried to think how to stop what he was going to do, somewhere below that I was working out where hed gone, and how, and why, and what he was doing now.I stared at the nasty pouting mouth of the gun.He changed his aim as he came, pointing at Bren and Spanish Dancer.I tried to push the Ariekes away, but Scile wasnt aiming at it now but at Ez, and then at Cal, and Cal began to turn his eyes to me.Scile fired.Calls and screaming started in Terre and Ariekene voices, as in a plume of blood where energy took and opened him, Cal fell away, staring at me, and died.Part Nine  THE RELIEF    30  THIS IS WHAT  said.It was in a plaza in the city, a big square made bigger by cajoling the buildings.I remember it very well.Bren stood by me and whispered a translation but I could make almost perfect sense of it all.I remember the weather, the houses, the air and the crowd of Ariekei.Thousands, addicts jostling to the edges of the opening.Some must have expected EzCal, wanted their god drug fix.This is what Spanish Dancer said.Before the humans came we didnt speak so much of certain things.We were grown into Language.After history we made city and machines and gave them names.We didnt speak so much of certain things.Language spoke us.The words that wanted to be city and machines had us speak them so they could be.When the humans came they had no names, and we made new words so they would have places in the world.They didnt do as other things do.We spoke them into Language.Language took them in.We were like hunters.We were like plants eating light.The humans made their town in our town like a star in a circle.They made their place like a filament in a flower.We spoke the name of their place, but we know it had another name, sitting in the city like an organ in a body, like a tongue in a mouth.Before the humans came we didnt speak so much because we were like this one, who years ago was the girl who was hurt in darkness and ate what was given to her.We were like her.You decide why we were like her and why we were not like her.Why shes like herself or is not.Weve been like all things; we left the city during the drugtime and speak more now.Before the humans came we didnt speak.Weve been like countless things, weve been like all things, weve been like the animals over Embassytown in the direction of which I raise my giftwing, which is a speaking youll come to understand.We didnt speak, we were mute, we only dropped the stones we mentioned out of our mouths, opened our mouths and had the birds we described fly out, we were vectors, we were the birds eating in mindlessness, we were the girl in darkness, only knowing it when we werent anymore.We speak now or I do, and others do.Youve never spoken before.You will.Youll be able to say how the city is a pit and a hill and a standard and an animal that hunts and a vessel on the sea and the sea and how we are fish in it, not like the man who swims weekly with fish but the fish with which he swims, the water, the pool.I love you, you light me, warm me, you are suns.You have never spoken before.That was what Spanish Dancer said to its gathered people.It said more.It was much less clumsy with them than Id been when I changed it: it understood much better the psyches it wanted to alter, and its words were surgery.At first those in the square listened, not knowing what for.As its words grew more outlandish and impossible, there were brayings of consternation.They were raucous, as they would be at any virtuoso lies, then something much more.There was a hysteria of admiration and concern.As Spanish spoke, Ariekei shouted in more than astonishment.These were the sounds of crisis.I remembered them from when Id taught Spanish Dancer to lie.I was hearing minds reconfigured.Deaths: old thoughts dying.I saw the upthrown giftwings and fanwings of ecstasy, ecstasy in an old sense, not without pain and terror, of visions, and then the silence of the adult Ariekei new born.There were only a few that first time.Most who listened were left terrified perhaps, tremulous, having glimpsed something.When at last they calmed, some eventually clamoured for EzCal again, their need making them forgetful.But there were others who tipped over, became new things, learnt language, at what Spanish Dancer said.I understood almost every word it spoke.Sometimes when Spanish Dancer is talking to me in my own language, it doesnt say  but , or .I think it knows that pleases me.A present for me.31  POOR SCILE.How do I tell this?MOST MORNINGS I go to Lilypad Hill.The adjutants and I discuss plans.Anything yet?I say, and every morning so far theyve checked the readings and shaken their heads, Not yet, and Ive said, Well, soon.Be ready.Can I say Poor Scile, after everything?I can.His actions disgust methere are dead friends whod be alive if it werent for himbut could you not feel pity to see him?Hes in the jail we made from the infirmary.His neighbours are those failed Ambassadors still too broken to walk out of the doors when we opened them.Scile knows hes alive because, criminal as he is, he didnt do anything so very bad, so unforgivable as to warrant execution.Weve decided we dont have the death penalty just for murder.I go to see him sometimes.People understand.Its pity, concern, curiosity and the ghost of affection.He cant believe whats happened.He cant believe he so failed.It was pandemonium when he killed Cal.Im surprised he wasnt shot in turn, that we were able to take him alive.You will not do this, he said.Cal still twitched on the ground.Scile swung his gun at Spanish Dancer.They will not be like you.We stopped him before he fired again.Spanish smacked his pistol away.Grabbed Sciles shirt and said to him ?Scile put his hands over his ears and called Spanish Dancer a devil.It hadnt been a suicide walk but a pilgrimage.Hed gone to find the Absurd army, to walk behind them a witness and apostle while theywhat, cleaning fire, holy avengers whod rather cut themselves than be tainted by lies?purged the ruined Ariekei, got the world ready again, a nursery, for unborn pure Languaged young.It had been a brutal hope but it had been hope.Im sure Scile heard when EzCal was born, no matter where he was.I dont know how word could have reached him but word does.He must have known EzCal and their oratees couldnt withstand the Absurd.But he didnt reckon with me and Bren and Spanish Dancer.The horror he must have felt to see us and what we did, from the camps, beside the army.He was patient, waiting until the god drug arrived before doing his holy work.He sacrificed himself, he must have thought, for the Absurd.Perhaps he had in mind the child Ariekei that would one day walk through empty Embassytown, think of explanations for its ruins, and say them in Language.Scile was ready for us all to die.He wasnt quite wrong: there had been a fall.The Ariekei are different now.Its true that now they speak lies.Poor Scile, Ill say it again.He must think hes fallen among Lucifers.RECENTLY A MIAB incame to Lilypad Hill.We were no longer the people to whom it had been sent.I think thats why I felt what I can only call naughtiness, opening it.I felt what only I would recognise as the faintest immerdamp around it.Like bad children we pulled out treats.Wine; foods; medicine; luxuries: there were no surprises.We opened our orders, and Wyatts sealed instructions too.He didnt try to stop us.They were no surprise either.THE NEW ARIEKEI can speak to automa, and can understand them.I dont want to go in, I said.Its fine, its just...Bren nodded.He and Spanish Dancer took longer than I expected.I waited in the street, watched hoardings move.The products they advertise arent sold anymore.They rejoined me.Shes there, Bren said.And?.And...?I said.Did she speak to you?I said to Spanish.It and Bren looked at each other..I looked up at her building.There must be cams at points; there are cams everywhere, and my friend had always been part of her surroundings.I didnt wave.Ehrsul I know that you can understand the words Im saying, Spanish said, Bren said.In Anglo.And she doesnt even look back.She goes: No, you cant speak to me; Ariekei cant understand me.Avice would like to know how you are, it says.What youve been doing.She says, Avice!How is she?And you cant speak to me.You dont understand me, and you cant speak anything but Language.WE PASSED an avenue of outdated trids, a grassroots market, while I said nothing, and Bren did not insist.In the command economy of our reconstruction, our basics are provided, but extras, luxuries, throw up such barter.They make me think of markets in other cities, on other places.The blockades have been taken down.Some city dwellers say that as they can breathe our air but we cant breathe theirs, the Embassytown atmosphere should be extended over the whole city.Where there are new additions being grown, Ariekene buildings are subtly unclassic.Here a spire; an angled window; a familiar kind of buttress: our Terre topographys become fashionable.CANT BE FOUND; and DalTon cant be found: or no one who knows where they are, human or indigenous, will say.Of course their disappearances made me suspect club justice.But Im in informing networks as good as any, and if something like that has happened, its been very quiet.Which is no way to encourager les autres.I think probably either that they were some of the many killed and effaced by the war, or that one is or both are hidingits not as if you cant still do that in the citywaiting for whatever.I suppose well have to be vigilant.DalTons one thing, as far as Im concerned.As for , though, I dont think revenge of lynch or any other kind is what most New Ariekei want, if they even say they lived under .No Ariekei I know have been able to answer my questions, about what it was like, about whether they remember how they thought, before.About Language.Spanish Dancers first speech, about that change, was as much infection as exposition.I dont say they dont remember; I say that they cant tell me how it was if they do.No one knows why some Ariekei are immune to metaphor.No attention from Spanish or its growing number of deputies, its proselytisers, altering their listeners with careful, infectious, ostentatiously lie filled sermons, works on all of them.Each meeting there are successes: Ariekei staggering out of Language, into language and semes.Others come close, to go next time or the next.And there are those who refuse to; and those that, like Rooftop, sick with purity, just cant.They still cant speak to me, only to Ambassadors.They only understand a dying Language.Now we have the drugs, the voices, to keep them alive, and no more gods.EZSEY, I HEARD one oratee tell YlSib, was its favourite, because the tremor occasioned by their voice was...and there, vocabulary, mine and its, failed us.Others prefer EzLott, or EzBel, according to the high they give.Scile was usually a better thinker than his last murder would imply.He knew how wed created EzCal: he should have thought we could just do it again.We unhooked the mechanisms from inside Cals head, and they were safe, but even had they not been, we never faced another end.Ive got something, MagDa had said.Southels been putting together a few prototypes for weeks.Boosters.Weve had volunteers.Were ready to go.While wed pursued ours, that had been their secret plan.A stockpile, against Cal and EzCal, whose power lay in their uniqueness.MagDas and my and Brens treacheries dovetailed.Scile had brought no narrative to a conclusion.He killed Cal and very little changed.At first it was the cleaved Turn who volunteered, shaved their heads and had sockets implanted, tried out boosters like clawed tiaras, hooked into links and let gun prodded Ez, Rukowsi, read them, and speak with them.Lott was the first to take on the role while her doppel, Char, was still alive.Some are afraid to, but many Ambassadors have powered down their own links.They dont equalise.They dont speak Language much anymore.Theres not much call.I dont think they all dislike each other.Bren says he disagrees, but I tell him he cant think beyond his own history, which is understandable.We keep Joel Rukowsi safe because we need him and his freakish empathic head, but even that I think will change.Well find others like him.In the meantime we work him hard, and stockpile hours of drugtalk.We can afford to be generous to the exodusers.Its two cities nowone of the addicts, one of all the othersthat intersect politely.The Absurd and the New have much more in common than either do with the oratees.Hearings nothing: the Absurd and the New think the same.Spanish exchanges politenesses with Ariekei at every corner, with the Terre, with the fanwingless too, by the touchpads they carry, our Terretech contribution.Im learning to read and write their evolving scrawl, like a young Ariekes.As soon as they awake into their third instar, now, like some rough ritual theyre hard trained out of their instincts.They have only a few liminal days of pure Language, when word is referent and lies are uncanny, between animal instar and consciousness.Afterwards, the young New Ariekei know their city wasnt always this way but cant imagine it other.Of those that cant unlearn Language, some are deafening themselves, knowing itll cure them, that its not the cutting out of speech and mind they might once have thought.Others, like Rooftop, are preparing to leave.Well never visit their autarchic communities.They wont be linked by pipework to the city.Well hand over many many datchips, enough to last a long time.The exiles will live out their addiction and raise a new brood, never let them hear the chips, until their children speak Language too, but unafflicted and free.Humansvectors of addictionwill be banned and taboo: the city, where they speak differently now, theyll explain, will be taboo.For the next little future, its not humans but the New Ariekei thatll ambassador between the city and the settlements.I know how itll go, though.A New Ariekes will come to trade: theyll speak to it, Language to language, and theyll think they do, but they wont understand each other.Some of the youngll be intrigued by this odd stranger, and a few adventurous Language speaking young will make their way to the city gates.Thatll be the story.Doubtless therell still be addicts here outcasts, holy fools or whatever their status thenand the newcomers will hear the drugtalks broadcast for them, and instantly be addicted too.THE SHIPS CREW will have weapons, of course: Bremen weapons, more advanced than ours.But were very many and theyll be few.Besides, we mean them no harm.Well have an honour guard.Welcome, Captain, Ill say as the doors open onto Ariekene soil.Please come with us.Theyll be guests as much as prisoners.Thats tendentious.Theyll be prisoners, but well treat them well.According to Wyatts instructions, our next relief is due to deliver to Embassytown several new Ambassadors of EzRas kind.Theyve improved their empathic techniques.EzRa was the test: next was supposed to come Bremens coup.Too late.We got our coup in first.Instead, the new Ambassadors will have a job pushing product to addicts., Spanish Dancer will say.Itll gesture politely with its giftwing to the armed Embassytowners waiting..THE NEW ARIEKEI were astounded to learn that Terre have more than one language.I uploaded French.I, je.I am, je suis, I said.Spanish Dancer was delighted.It said to me, .Thats not its only innovation.They dont speak Anglo Ubiq here, but Anglo Ariekei.Im a student of this new language.It has its nuances.When I asked Spanish if it regretted learning to lie, it paused and said, .A performance perhaps, but I envy that precision.I wonder if Spanish Dancer ever mourns itself.If it lets me read what its writing, which Im almost certain is the story of the war, I might find out.It did tell me another story.When Baptist and Toweller returned to Embassytown, pretending to be oratees, to persuade EzCal into the wilderness where we were waiting, the god drug wouldnt see them.EzCal told them instead to relay their message through one of their regular Ariekene entourage, which saw and recognised them as followers of the controversial .It knew something was wrong: it could have given them up.Baptist and Toweller, in an instant and bravura moment of decision, admitted to their contact the true situation: that new, better times were coming, for all of them, if EzCal could be enticed out.Knowing that like their prophet they might be liars, it still decided to believe them.Given hope for the first time in a long time, that functionary went and told EzCal exactly what Baptist and Toweller had been about to.But they were New and it wasnt.It knew the truth, and it had never lied before.It had had to dissemble, in Language, managing with Herculean effort and luck to get out words that sounded like grunts to itself.That was the real hero of the war, Spanish Dancer told me, that nameless Ariekes, telling the only lie of its life.IT WOULDNT BE that hard for Bremen to destroy us.But I think we can make it worth their while not to.War across immer isnt cheap.We have to make sure were useful.We know what our use can be.Look at us here, on the dark edge of the immer!There will be the port they wanted.Within a local decade.Well be the last outpost.That was always our intended role, only now we know it, and while it wont be quite what our metropole had in mind, we can run ourselves.Welcome to Embassytown, the frontier.I know how fast the storiesll come.Im an immerser: Ive heard them.Just beyond our planets shores will be, people will say, El Dorado immer lands; deserted ships long lost; Earth; God.Alright then.I know what chancersll come, what pirates.I know the likelihood that Embassytown will become slum: but well moulder and die or be eradicated by Bremen shivabomb if we have no use.Scile in his visionary stupidity, trying to save the Ariekei, would have damned them: if they killed us, when the relief came it wouldnt forbear genociding them in return.I remember Sciles not from a colony when he fails to think of such things.So were to be ravaged by speculation and thrill seekers.Well be the wilds.Ive been to deadwood planets and pioneer towns: even those way stations have their good things.Well open up the sky.Well have knowledge to sell.Uniquely detailed maps.Immer byways only locals like us can find.We have to establish our credentials as an explorocracy; so to survive and rule ourselves, we have to explore.Well soon have one immership in our little navy, and at least one captain.When the next Bremen delegation comes to see what to make of us, well have something to offer.Immersions never safe.This far out, at this edge, were back to the dangerous glory days of homo diaspora.I dont have any hesitation.Ive gone out, Ive come back, and its time to go again, in directions and for distances no immerser has gone.In kilohours, I might be meeting an exot Im the first Terre ever to see, working tongueware, trying to make a greeting.I might find anything.Ive been studying navigation and immerology, techniques that I, the floaker, had always avoided.Youve never floaked in your life, Bren told me, brusquely, when I said that to him.Ive started to dream of how Embassytown will look, from the ship.Thats why Im at Lilypad Hill every day.Because I cant wait.Good morning, Captain.Youll come with us.And I and my crew will take the skiff to orbit, to the ship.Ready, Ill say, and set the helm beyond void cognita.Ill push the levers that set us out.Or perhaps the gracious thing will be to allow my first lieutenant to do it.We dont know how the passage will affect such crew: Ive warned them that.Theyre still insistent.So perhaps itll be Lieutenant Spanish Dancer wholl instigate that indescribable motion from everyday space through the always.Well immerse, into the immer, and into the out.IT WOULD BE foolish to pretend we know whatll happen.Well have to see how Embassytown gets shaped.By Embassytown I mean the city.Even the New Ariekei have started to call the city by that name.they say, or , or .
