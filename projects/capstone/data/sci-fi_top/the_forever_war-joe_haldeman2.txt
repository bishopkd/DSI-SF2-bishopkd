The bunker decided it was knocked out, and all we had to do was walk the rest of the way.Great.I scratched my face under the eyes, and some dry skin flaked off.She giggled.You should see yourself.You look like  All personnel, report to the assembly area.That was the captains voice.Bad news, usually.She handed me a tunic and sandals.Lets go.The assembly areachop hall was just down the corridor.There was a row of roll call buttons at the door; I pressed the one beside my name.Four of the names were covered with black tape.That was good, only four.We hadnt lost anybody during todays maneuvers.The captain was sitting on the raised dais, which at least meant we didnt have to go through the tench hut bullshit.The place filled up in less than a minute; a soft chime indicated the roll was complete.Captain Stott didnt stand up.You did fairly well today.Nobody killed, and I expected some to be.In that respect you exceeded my expectations but in every other respect you did a poor job.I am glad youre taking good care of yourselves, because each of you represents an investment of over a million dollars and one fourth of a human life.But in this simulated battle against a very stupid robot enemy, thirty seven of you managed to walk into laser fire and be killed in a simulated way, and since dead people require no food you will require no food, for the next three days.Each person who was a casualty in this battle will be allowed only two liters of water and a vitamin ration each day.We knew enough not to groan or anything, but there were some pretty disgusted looks, especially on the faces that had singed eyebrows and a pink rectangle of sunburn framing their eyes.Mandella.Sir?You are far and away the worst burned casualty.Was your image converter set on normal?Oh, shit.No, sir.Log two.I see.Who was your team leader for the exercises?Acting Corporal Potter, sir.Private Potter, did you order him to use image intensification?Sir, I  I dont remember.You dont.Well, as a memory exercise you may join the dead people.Is that satisfactory?Yes, sir.Good.Dead people get one last meal tonight and go on no rations starting tomorrow.Are there any questions?He must have been kidding.All right.Dismissed.I selected the meal that looked as if it had the most calories and took my tray over to sit by Potter.That was a quixotic damn thing to do.But thanks.Nothing.Ive been wanting to lose a few pounds anyway.I couldnt see where she was carrying any extra.I know a good exercise, I said.She smiled without looking up from her tray.Have anybody for tonight?Kind of thought Id ask Jeff  Better hurry, then.Hes lusting after Maejima.Well, that was mostly true.Everybody did.I dont know.Maybe we ought to save our strength.That third day  Come on.I scratched the back of her hand lightly with a fingernail.We havent sacked since Missouri.Maybe Ive learned something new.Maybe you have.She tilted her head up at me in a sly way.Okay.Actually, she was the one with the new trick.The French corkscrew, she called it.She wouldnt tell me who taught it to her though.Id like to shake his hand.Once I got my strength back.8  The two weeks training around Miami Base eventually cost us eleven lives.Twelve, if you count Dahlquist.I guess having to spend the rest of your life on Charon with a hand and both legs missing is close enough to dying.Foster was crushed in a landslide and Freeland had a suit malfunction that froze him solid before we could carry him inside.Most of the other deaders were people I didnt know all that well.But they all hurt.And they seemed to make us more scared rather than more cautious.Now darkside.A flyer brought us over in groups of twenty and set us down beside a pile of building materials thoughtfully immersed in a pool of helium II.We used grapples to haul the stuff out of the pool.Its not safe to go wading, since the stuff crawls all over you and its hard to tell whats underneath; you could walk out onto a slab of hydrogen and be out of luck.Id suggested that we try to boil away the pool with our lasers, but ten minutes of concentrated fire didnt drop the helium level appreciably.It didnt boil, either; helium II is a superfluid, so what evaporation there was had to take place evenly, all over the surface.No hot spots, so no bubbling.We werent supposed to use lights, to avoid detection.There was plenty of starlight with your image converter cranked up to log three or four, but each stage of amplification meant some loss of detail.By log four the landscape looked like a crude monochrome painting, and you couldnt read the names on peoples helmets unless they were right in front of you.The landscape wasnt all that interesting, anyhow.There were half a dozen medium sized meteor craters (all with exactly the same level of helium II in them) and the suggestion of some puny mountains just over the horizon.The uneven ground was the consistency of frozen spiderwebs; every time you put your foot down, youd sink half an inch with a squeaking crunch.It could get on your nerves.It took most of a day to pull all the stuff out of the pool.We took shifts napping, which you could do either standing up, sitting or lying on your stomach.I didnt do well in any of those positions, so I was anxious to get the bunker built and pressurized.We couldnt build the thing underground  itd just fill up with helium II  so the first thing to do was to build an insulating platform, a permaplast vacuum sandwich three layers thick.I was an acting corporal, with a crew of ten people.We were carrying the permaplast layers to the building site two people can carry one easily  when one of my men slipped and fell on his back.Damn it, Singer, watch your step.Wed had a couple of deaders that way.Sorry, Corporal.Im bushed.Just got my feet tangled up.Yeah, just watch it.He got back up all right, and he and his partner placed the sheet and went back to get another.I kept my eye on Singer.In a few minutes he was practically staggering, not easy to do in that suit of cybernetic armor.Singer!After you set the plank, I want to see you.OK.He labored through the task and mooched over.Let me check your readout.I opened the door on his chest to expose the medical monitor.His temperature was two degrees high; blood pressure and heart rate both elevated.Not up to the red line, though.You sick or something?Hell, Mandella, I feel OK, just tired.Since I fell I been a little dizzy.I chinned the medics combination.Doc, this is Mandella.You wanna come over here for a minute?Sure, where are you?I waved and he walked over from poolside.Whats the problem?I showed him Singers readout.He knew what all the other little dials and things meant, so it took him a while.As far as I can tell, Mandella  hes just hot.Hell, I coulda told you that, said Singer.Maybe you better have the armorer take a look at his suit.We had two people whod taken a crash course in suit maintenance; they were our armorers.I chinned Sanchez and asked him to come over with his tool kit.Be a couple of minutes, Corporal.Carryin, a plank.Well, put it down and get on over here.I was getting an uneasy feeling.Waiting for him, the medic and I looked over Singers suit.Uh oh, Doc Jones said.Look at this.I went around to the back and looked where he was pointing.Two of the fins on the heat exchanger were bent out of shape.Whats wrong?Singer asked.You fell on your heat exchanger, right?Sure, Corporal thats it.It must not be working right.I dont think its working at all, said Doc.Sanchez came over with his diagnostic kit and we told him what had happened.He looked at the heat exchanger, then plugged a couple of jacks into it and got a digital readout from a little monitor in his kit.I didnt know what it was measuring, but it came out zero to eight decimal places.Heard a soft click, Sanchez chinning my private frequency.Corporal, this guys a deader.What?Cant you fix the goddamn thing?Maybe  maybe I could, if I could take it apart.But theres no way  Hey!Sanchez?Singer was talking on the general freak.Find out whats wrong?He was panting.Click.Keep your pants on, man, were working on it.Click.He wont last long enough for us to get the bunker pressurized.And I cant work on the heat exchanger from outside of the suit.Youve got a spare suit, havent you?Two of em, the fit anybody kind.But theres no place  say  Right.Go get one of the suits warmed up.I chinned the general freak.Listen, Singer, weve gotta get you out of that thing.Sanchez has a spare suit, but to make the switch, were gonna have to build a house around you.Understand?Huh uh.Look, well make a box with you inside, and hook it up to the life support unit.That way you can breathe while you make the switch.Souns pretty compis  compil  cated tme.Look, just come along  Ill be all right, Man, jus, lemme res,  I grabbed his arm and led him to the building site.He was really weaving.Doc took his other arm, and between us, we kept him from falling over.Corporal Ho, this is Corporal Mandella.Ho was in charge of the life support unit.Go away, Mandella, Im busy.Youre going to be busier.I outlined the problem to her.While her group hurried to adapt the LSU  for this purpose, it need only be an air hose and heater  I got my crew to bring around six slabs of permaplast, so we could build a big box around Singer and the extra suit.It would look like a huge coffin, a meter square and six meters long.We set the suit down on the slab that would be the floor of the coffin.OK, Singer, lets go.No answer.Singer, lets go.No answer.Singer!He was just standing there.Doc Jones checked his readout.Hes out, man, unconscious.My mind raced.There might just be room for another person in the box.Give me a hand here.I took Singers shoulders and Doc took his feet, and we carefully laid him out at the feet of the empty suit.Then I lay down myself, above the suit.OK, closeer up.Look, Mandella, if anybody goes in there, it oughta be me.Fuck you, Doc.My job.My man.That sounded all wrong.William Mandella, boy hero.They stood a slab up on edge  it had two openings for the LSU input and exhaust  and proceeded to weld it to the bottom plank with a narrow laser beam.On Earth, wed just use glue, but here the only fluid was helium, which has lots of interesting properties, but is definitely not sticky.After about ten minutes we were completely walled up.I could feel the LSU humming.I switched on my suit light  the first time since we landed on darkside  and the glare made purple blotches dance in front of my eyes.Mandella, this is Ho.Stay in your suit at least two or three minutes.Were putting hot air in, but its coming back just this side of liquid.I watched the purple fade for a while.OK, its still cold, but you can make it.I popped my suit.It wouldnt open all the way, but I didnt have too much trouble getting out.The suit was still cold enough to take some skin off my fingers and butt as I wiggled out.I had to crawl feet first down the coffin to get to Singer.It got darker fast, moving away from my light.When I popped his suit a rush of hot stink hit me in the face.In the dim light his skin was dark red and splotchy.His breathing was very shallow and I could see his heart, palpitating.First I unhooked the relief tubes  an unpleasant business  then the biosensors; and then I had the problem of getting his arms out of their sleeves.Its pretty easy to do for yourself.You twist this way and turn that way and the arm pops out.Doing it from the outside is a different matter: I had to twist his arm and then reach under and move the suits arm to match  it takes muscle to move a suit around from the outside.Once I had one arm out it was pretty easy; I just crawled forward, putting my feet on the suits shoulders, and pulled on his free arm.He slid out of the suit like an oyster slipping out of its shell.I popped the spare suit and after a lot of pulling and pushing, managed to get his legs in.Hooked up the biosensors and the front relief tube.Hed have to do the other one himself  its too complicated.For the nth time I was glad not to have been born female; they have to have two of those damned plumbers friends, instead of just one and a simple hose.I left his arms out of the sleeves.The suit would be useless for any kind of work, anyhow; waldos have to be tailored to the individual.His eyelids fluttered.Man  della.Where  the fuck  I explained, slowly, and he seemed to get most of it.Now Im gonna close you up and go get into my suit.Ill have the crew cut the end off this thing and Ill haul you out.Got it?He nodded.Strange to see that  when you nod or shrug inside a suit, it doesnt communicate anything  I crawled into my suit, hooked up the attachments and chinned the general freak.Doc, I think hes gonna be OK.Get us out of here now.Will do.Hos voice.The LSU hum was replaced by a chatter, then a throb.Evacuating the box to prevent an explosion.One corner of the seam grew red, then white, and a bright crimson beam lanced through, not a foot away from my head.I scrunched back as far as I could.The beam slid up the seam and around three comers, back to where it started.The end of the box fell away slowly, trailing filaments of melted plast.Wait for the stuff to harden, Mandella.Sanchez, Im not that stupid.Here you go.Somebody tossed a line to me.That would be smarter than dragging him out by myself.I threaded a long bight under his arms and tied it behind his neck.Then I scrambled out to help them pull, which was silly  they had a dozen people already lined up to haul.Singer got out all right and was actually sitting up while Doc Jones checked his readout.People were asking me about it and congratulating me, when suddenly Ho said Look!and pointed toward the horizon.It was a black ship, coming in fast.I just had time to think it wasnt fair, they werent supposed to attack until the last few days, and then the ship was right on top of us.9  We all flopped to the ground instinctively, but the ship didnt attack.It blasted braking rockets and dropped to land on skids.Then it skied around to come to a rest beside the building site.Everybody had it figured out and was standing around sheepishly when the two suited figures stepped out of the ship.A familiar voice crackled over the general freak.Every one of you saw us coming in and not one of you responded with laser fire.It wouldnt have done any good but it would have indicated a certain amount of fighting spirit.You have a week or less before the real thing and since the sergeant and I will be here I will insist that you show a little more will to live.Acting Sergeant Potter.Here, sir.Get me a detail of twelve people to unload cargo.We brought a hundred small robot drones for target practice so that you might have at least a fighting chance when a live target comes over.Move now.We only have thirty minutes before the ship returns to Miami.I checked, and it was actually more like forty minutes.Having the captain and sergeant there didnt really make much difference.We were still on our own; they were just observing.Once we got the floor down, it only took one day to complete the bunker.It was a gray oblong, featureless except for the airlock blister and four windows.On top was a swivel mounted gigawatt laser.The operator  you couldnt call him a gunner  sat in a chair holding deadman switches in both hands.The laser wouldnt fire as long as he was holding one of those switches.If he let go, it would automatically aim for any moving aerial object and fire at will.Primary detection and aiming was by means of a kilometer high antenna mounted beside the bunker.It was the only arrangement that could really be expected to work, with the horizon so close and human reflexes so slow.You couldnt have the thing fully automatic, because in theory, friendly ships might also approach.The aiming computer could choose among up to twelve targets appearing simultaneously (firing at the largest ones first).And it would get all twelve in the space of half a second.The installation was partly protected from enemy fire by an efficient ablative layer that covered everything except the human operator.But then, they were dead man switches.One man above guarding eighty inside.The armys good at that kind of arithmetic.Once the bunker was finished, half of us stayed inside at all times, feeling very much like targets  taking turns operating the laser, while the other half went on maneuvers.About four klicks from the base was a large lake of frozen hydrogen; one of our most important maneuvers was to learn how to get around on the treacherous stuff.It wasnt too difficult.You couldnt stand up on it, so you had to belly down and sled.If you had somebody to push you from the edge, getting started was no problem.Otherwise, you had to scrabble with your hands and feet, pushing down as hard as was practical, until you started moving, in a series of little jumps.Once started, youd keep going until you ran out of ice.You could steer a little bit by digging in, hand and foot, on the appropriate side, but you couldnt slow to a stop that way.So it was a good idea not to go too fast and wind up positioned in such a way that your helmet didnt absorb the shock of stopping.We went through all the things wed done on the Miami side: weapons practice, demolition, attack patterns.We also launched drones at irregular intervals, toward the bunker.Thus, ten or fifteen times a day, the operators got to demonstrate their skill in letting go of the handles as soon as the proximity light went on.I had four hours of that, like everybody else.I was nervous until the first attack, when I saw how little there was to it.The light went on, I let go, the gun aimed, and when the drone peeped over the horizon zzt!Nice touch of color, the molten metal spraying through space.Otherwise not too exciting.So none of us were worried about the upcoming graduation exercise, thinking it would be just more of the same.Miami Base attacked on the thirteenth day with two simultaneous missiles streaking over opposite sides of the horizon at some forty kilometers per second.The laser vaporized the first one with no trouble, but the second got within eight klicks of the bunker before it was hit.We were coming back from maneuvers, about a klick away from the bunker.I wouldnt have seen it happen if I hadnt been looking directly at the bunker the moment of the attack.The second missile sent a shower of molten debris straight toward the bunker.Eleven pieces hit, and, as we later reconstructed it, this is what happened:  The first casualty was Maejima, so well loved Maejima, inside the bunker, who was hit in the back and the head and died instantly.With the drop in pressure, the LSU went into high gear.Friedman was standing in front of the main airco outlet and was blown into the opposite wall hard enough to knock him unconscious; he died of decompression before the others could get him to his suit.Everybody else managed to stagger through the gale and get into their suits, but Garcias suit had been holed and didnt do him any good.By the time we got there, they had turned off the LSU and were welding up the holes in the wall.One man was trying to scrape up the unrecognizable mess that had been Maejima.I could hear him sobbing and retching.They had already taken Garcia and Friedman outside for burial.The captain took over the repair detail from Potter.Sergeant Cortez led the sobbing man over to a corner and came back to work on cleaning up Maejimas remains, alone.He didnt order anybody to help and nobody volunteered.10  As a graduation exercise, we were unceremoniously stuffed into a ship  Earths Hope, the same one we rode to Charon  and bundled off to Stargate at a little more than one gee.The trip seemed endless, about six months subjective time, and boring, but not as hard on the carcass as going to Charon had been.Captain Stott made us review our training orally, day by day, and we did exercises every day until we were worn to a collective frazzle.Stargate 1 was like Charons darkside, only more so.The base on Stargate 1 was smaller than Miami Base  only a little bigger than the one we constructed on darkside  and we were due to lay over a week to help expand the facilities.The crew there was very glad to see us, especially the two females, who looked a little worn around the edges.We all crowded into the small dining hall where Submajor Williamson, the man in charge of Stargate 1, gave us some disconcerting news:  Everybody get comfortable.Get off the tables, though, theres plenty of floor.I have some idea of what you just went through training on Charon.I wont say its all been wasted.But where youre headed, things will be quite different.Warmer.He paused to let that soak in.Aleph Aurigae, the first collapsar ever detected, revolves around the normal star Epsilon Aurigae in a twenty seven year orbit.The enemy has a base of operations, not on a regular portal planet of Aleph, but on a planet in orbit around Epsilon.We dont know much about the planet, just that it goes around Epsilon once every 745 days, is about three fourths the size of Earth, and has an albedo of 0.8, meaning its probably covered with clouds.We cant say precisely how hot it will be, but judging from its distance from Epsilon, its probably rather hotter than Earth.Of course, we dont know whether youll be working  fighting on lightside or darkside, equator or poles.Its highly unlikely that the atmosphere will be breathable  at any rate, youll stay inside your suits.Now you know exactly as much about where youre going as I do.Questions?Sir, Stein drawled, now we know where were goin  anybody know what were goin to do when we get there?Williamson shrugged.Thats up to your captain and your sergeant, and the captain of Earths Hope, and Hopes logistic computer.We just dont have enough data yet to project a course of action for you.It may be a long and bloody battle; it may be just a case of walking in to pick up the pieces.Conceivably, the Taurans might want to make a peace offer,  Cortez snorted  in which case you would simply be part of our muscle, our bargaining power.He looked at Cortez mildly.No one can say for sure.The orgy that night was amusing, but it was like trying to sleep in the middle of a raucous beach party.The only area big enough to sleep all of us was the dining hall  they draped a few bedsheets here and there for privacy, then unleashed Stargates eighteen sex starved men on our women, compliant and promiscuous by military custom (and law), but desiring nothing so much as sleep on solid ground.The eighteen men acted as if they were compelled to try as many permutations as possible, and their performance was impressive (in a strictly quantitative sense, that is).Those of us who were keeping count led a cheering section for some of the more gifted members.I think thats the right word.The next morning  and every other morning we were on Stargate 1, we staggered out of bed and into our suits, to go outside and work on the new wing.Eventually, Stargate would be tactical and logistic headquarters for the war, with thousands of permanent personnel, guarded by half a dozen heavy cruisers in Hopes class.When we started, it was two shacks and twenty people; when we left, it was four shacks and twenty people.The work was hardly work at all, compared to darkside, since we had plenty of light and got sixteen hours inside for every eight hours, work.And no drone attack for a final exam.When we shuttled back up to the Hope, nobody was too happy about leaving (though some of the more popular females declared itd be good to get some rest).Stargate was the last easy safe assignment wed have before taking up arms against the Taurans.And as Williamson had pointed out the first day, there was no way of predicting what that would be like.Most of us didnt feel too enthusiastic about making a collapsar jump, either.Wed been assured that we wouldnt even feel it happen, just free fall all the way.I wasnt convinced.As a physics student, Id had the usual courses in general relativity and theories of gravitation.We only had a little direct data at that time  Stargate was discovered when I was in grade school  but the mathematical model seemed clear enough.The collapsar Stargate was a perfect sphere about three kilometers in radius.It was suspended forever in a state of gravitational collapse that should have meant its surface was dropping toward its center at nearly the speed of light.Relativity propped it up, at least gave it the illusion of being there  the way all reality becomes illusory and observer oriented when you study general relativity.Or Buddhism.Or get drafted.At any rate, there would be a theoretical point in spacetime when one end of our ship was just above the surface of the collapsar, and the other end was a kilometer away (in our frame of reference).In any sane universe, this would set up tidal stresses and tear the ship apart, and we would be just another million kilograms of degenerate matter on the theoretical surface, rushing headlong to nowhere for the rest of eternity or dropping to the center in the next trillionth of a second.You pays your money and you takes your frame of reference.But they were right.We blasted away from Stargate 1, made a few course corrections and then just dropped, for about an hour.Then a bell rang and we sank into our cushions under a steady two gravities of deceleration.We were in enemy territory    11  Wed been decelerating at two gravities for almost nine days when the battle began.Lying on our couches being miserable all we felt were two soft bumps, missiles being released.Some eight hours later, the squawkbox crackled: Attention, all crew.This is the captain.Quinsana, the pilot, was only a lieutenant, but was allowed to call himself captain aboard, the vessel, where he outranked all of us, even Captain Stott.You grunts in the cargo hold can listen, too.We just engaged the enemy with two fifty gigaton tachyon missiles and have destroyed both the enemy vessel and another object which it had launched approximately three microseconds before.The enemy has been trying to overtake us for the past 179 hours, ship time.At the time of the engagement, the enemy was moving at a little over half the speed of light, relative to Aleph, and was only about thirty AUs from Earths Hope.It was moving at .47c relative to us, and thus we would have been coincident in space time  rammed!in a little more than nine hours.The missiles were launched at 0719 ships time, and destroyed the enemy at 1540, both tachyon bombs detonating within a thousand klicks of the enemy objects.The two missiles were a type whose propulsion system was itself only a barely controlled tachyon bomb.They accelerated at a constant rate of 100 gees, and were traveling at a relativistic speed by the time the nearby mass of the enemy ship detonated them.We expect no further interference from enemy vessels.Our velocity with respect to Aleph will be zero in another five hours; we will then begin the journey back.The return will take twenty seven days.General moans and dejected cussing.Everybody knew all that already, of course; but we didnt care to be reminded of it.So after another month of logy calisthenics and drill, at a constant two gravities, we got our first look at the planet we were going to attack.Invaders from outer space, yes sir.It was a blinding white crescent waiting for us two AUs out from Epsilon.The captain had pinned down the location of the enemy base from fifty AUs out, and we had jockeyed in on a wide arc, keeping the bulk of the planet between them and us.That didnt mean we were sneaking up on them  quite the contrary; they launched three abortive attacks  but it put us in a stronger defensive position.Until we had to go to the surface, that is.Then only the ship and its Star Fleet crew would be reasonably safe.Since the planet rotated rather slowly  once every ten and one half days  a stationary orbit for the ship had to be 150,000 klicks out.This made the people in the ship feel quite secure, with 6,000 miles of rock and 90,000 miles of space between them and the enemy.But it meant a whole seconds time lag in communication between us on the ground and the ships battle computer.A person could get awful dead while that neutrino pulse crawled up and back.Our vague orders were to attack the base and gain control, while damaging a minimum of enemy equipment.We were to take at least one enemy alive.We were under no circumstances to allow ourselves to be taken alive, however.And the decision wasnt up to us; one special pulse from the battle computer, and that speck of plutonium in your power plant would fiss with all of .01% efficiency, and youd be nothing but a rapidly expanding, very hotplasma.They strapped us into six scoutships  one platoon of twelve people in each  and we blasted away from Earths Hope at eight gees.Each scoutship was supposed to follow its own carefully random path to our rendezvous point, 108 klicks from the base.Fourteen drone ships were launched at the same time, to confound the enemys antispacecraft system.The landing went off almost perfectly.One ship suffered minor damage, a near miss boiling away some of the ablative material on one side of the hull, but itd still be able to make it and return, keeping its speed down while in the atmosphere.We zigged and zagged and wound up first ship at the rendezvous point.There was only one trouble.It was under four kilometers of water.I could almost hear that machine, 90,000 miles away, grinding its mental gears, adding this new bit of data.We proceeded just as if we were landing on solid ground, braking rockets, falling, skids out, hit the water, skip, hit the water, skip, hit the water, sink.It would have made sense to go ahead and land on the bottom  we were streamlined, after all, and water just another fluid  but the hull wasnt strong enough to hold up a four kilometer column of water.Sergeant Cortez was in the scoutship with us.Sarge, tell that computer to do something!Were gonna get  Oh, shut up, Mandella.Trust in th lord.Lord was definitely lower case when Cortez said it.There was a loud bubbly sigh, then another, and a slight increase in pressure on my back that meant the ship was rising.Flotation bags?Cortez didnt deign to answer, or didnt know.That was it.We rose to within ten or fifteen meters of the surface and stopped, suspended there.Through the port I could see the surface above, shimmering like a mirror of hammered silver.I wondered what it would be like to be a fish and have a definite roof over your world.I watched another ship splash in.It made a great cloud of bubbles and turbulence, then fell slightly tail first for a short distance before large bags popped out under each delta wing.Then it bobbed up to about our level and stayed.This is Captain Stott.Now listen carefully.There is a beach some twenty eight klicks from your present position, in the direction of the enemy.You will be proceeding to this beach by scoutship and from there will mount your assault on the Tauran position.That was some improvement; wed only have to walk eighty klicks.We deflated the bags, blasted to the surface and flew in a slow, spread out formation to the beach.It took several minutes.As the ship scraped to a halt, I could hear pumps humming, making the cabin pressure equal to the air pressure outside.Before it had quite stopped moving, the escape slot beside my couch slid open.I rolled out onto the wing of the craft and jumped to the ground.Ten seconds to find cover  I sprinted across loose gravel to the treeline, a twisty bramble of tall sparse bluish green shrubs.I dove into the briar patch and turned to watch the ships leave.The drones that were left rose slowly to about a hundred meters, then took off in all directions with a bone jarring roar.The real scoutships slid slowly back into the water.Maybe that was a good idea.It wasnt a terribly attractive world but certainly would be easier to get around in than the cryogenic nightmare we were trained for.The sky was a uniform dull silver brightness that merged with the mist over the ocean so completely it was impossible to tell where water ended and air began.Small wavelets licked at the black gravel shore, much too slow and graceful in the three quarters Earth normal gravity.Even from fifty meters away, the rattle of billions of pebbles rolling with the tide was loud in my ears.The air temperature was 79 degrees Centigrade, not quite hot enough for the sea to boil, even though the air pressure was low compared to Earths Wisps of steam drifted quickly upward from the line where water met land.I wondered how a lone man would survive exposed here without a suit.Would the heat or the low oxygen (partial pressure one eighth Earth normal) kill him first?Or was there some deadly microorganism that would beat them both  ?This is Cortez.Everybody come over and assemble on me.He was standing on the beach a little to the left of me, waving his hand in a circle over his head.I walked toward him through the shrubs.They were brittle, unsubstantial, seemed paradoxically dried out in the steamy air.They wouldnt offer much in the way of cover.Well be advancing on a heading .05 radians east of north.I want Platoon One to take point.Two and Three follow about twenty meters behind, to the left and right.Seven, command platoon, is in the middle, twenty meters behind Two and Three.Five and Six, bring up the rear, in a semicircular closed flank.Everybody straight?Sure, we could do that arrowhead maneuver in our sleep.OK, lets move out.I was in Platoon Seven, the command group.Captain Stott put me there not because I was expected to give any commands, but because of my training in physics.The command group was supposedly the safest place, buffered by six platoons: people were assigned to it because there was some tactical reason for them to survive at least a little longer than the rest.Cortez was there to give orders.Chavez was there to correct suit malfunctions.The senior medic, Doc Wilson (the only medic who actually had an M. D.), was there, and so was Theodopolis, the radio engineer, our link with the captain, who had elected to stay in orbit.The rest of us were assigned to the command group by dint of special training or aptitude that wouldnt normally be considered of a tactical nature.Facing a totally unknown enemy, there was no way of telling what might prove important.Thus I was there because I was the closest the company had to a physicist.Rogers was biology.Tate was chemistry.Ho could crank out a perfect score on the Rhine extrasensory perception test, every time.Bohrs was a polyglot, able to speak twenty one languages fluently, idiomatically.Petrovs talent was that he had tested out to have not one molecule of xenophobia in his psyche.Keating was a skilled acrobat.Debby Hollister  Lucky Hollister  showed a remarkable aptitude for making money, and also had a consistently high Rhine potential.12  When we first set out, we were using the jungle camouflage combination on our suits.But what passed for jungle in these anemic tropics was too sparse; we looked like a band of conspicuous harlequins trooping through the woods.Cortez had us switch to black, but that was just as bad, as the light of Epsilon came evenly from all parts of the sky, and there were no shadows except ours.We finally settled on the dun colored desert camouflage.The nature of the countryside changed slowly as we walked north, away from the sea.The thorned stalks  I guess you could call them trees  came in fewer numbers but were bigger around and less brittle; at the base of each was a tangled mass of vine with the same bluegreen color, which spread out in a flattened cone some ten meters in diameter.There was a delicate green flower the size of a mans head near the top of each tree.Grass began to grow some five klicks from the sea.It seemed to respect the trees property rights, leaving a strip of bare earth around each cone of vine.At the edge of such a clearing, it would grow as timid bluegreen stubble, then, moving away from the tree, would get thicker and taller until it reached shoulder high in some places, where the separation between two trees was unusually large.The grass was a lighter, greener shade than the trees and vines.We changed the color of our suits to the bright green we had used for maximum visibility on Charon.Keeping to the thickest part of the grass, we were fairly inconspicuous.We covered over twenty klicks each day, buoyant after months under two gees.Until the second day, the only form of animal life we saw was a kind of black worm fingersized, with hundreds of cilium legs like the bristles of a brush.Rogers said that there obviously had to be some larger creature around, or there would be no reason for the trees to have thorns So we were doubly on guard, expecting trouble both from the Taurans and the unidentified large creature.Potters second platoon was on point; the general freak was reserved for her, since her platoon would likely be the first to spot any trouble.Sarge, this is Potter, we all heard.Movement ahead.Get down, then!We are.Dont think they see us.First platoon, go up to the right of point.Keep down.Fourth, get up to the left.Tell me when you get in position.Sixth platoon, stay back and guard the rear.Fifth and third, close with the command group.Two dozen people whispered out of the grass to join us.Cortez must have heard from the fourth platoon.Good.How about you, first?OK, fine.How many are there?Eight we can see.Potters voice.Good.When I give the word, open fire.Shoot to kill.Sarge  theyre just animals.Potter  if youve known all this time what a Tauran looks like, you shouldve told us.Shoot to kill.But we need  We need a prisoner, but we dont need to escort him forty klicks to his home base and keep an eye on him while we fight.Clear?Yes.Sergeant.OK.Seventh, all you brains and weirds, were going up and watch.Fifth and third, come along to guard.We crawled through the meter high grass to where the second platoon had stretched out in a firing line.I dont see anything, Cortez said.Ahead and just to the left.Dark green.They were only a shade darker than the grass.But after you saw the first one, you could see them all, moving slowly around some thirty meters ahead.Fire!Cortez fired first; then twelve streaks of crimson leaped out and the grass wilted black, disappeared, and the creatures convulsed and died trying to scatter.Hold fire, hold it!Cortez stood up.We want to have something left  second platoon, follow me.He strode out toward the smoldering corpses, laser finger pointed out, front, obscene divining rod pulling him toward the carnage  I felt my gorge rising and knew that all the lurid training tapes, all the horrible deaths in training accidents, hadnt prepared me for this sudden reality  that I had a magic wand that I could point at a life and make it a smoking piece of half raw meat; I wasnt a soldier nor ever wanted to be one nor ever would want.OK, seventh, come on up.While we were walking toward them, one of the creatures moved, a tiny shudder, and Cortez flicked the beam of his laser over it with an almost negligent gesture.It made a hand deep gash across the creatures middle.It died, like the others, without emitting a sound.They were not quite as tall as humans, but wider in girth.They were covered with dark green, almost black, fur, white curls where the laser had singed.They appeared to have three legs and an arm.The only ornament to their shaggy heads was a mouth, wet black orifice filled with flat black teeth.They were thoroughly repulsive, but their worst feature was not a difference from human beings, but a similarity  Whenever the laser had opened a body cavity, milk white glistening veined globes and coils of organs spilled out, and their blood was dark clotting red.Rogers, take a look.Taurans or not?Rogers knelt by one of the disemboweled creatures and opened a flat plastic box, filled with glittering dissecting tools.She selected a scalpel.One way we might be able to find out.Doc Wilson watched over her shoulder as she methodically slit the membrane covering several organs.Here.She held up a blackish fibrous mass between two fingers, a parody of daintiness through all that armor.So?Its grass, Sergeant.If the Taurans eat the grass and breathe the air, they certainly found a planet remarkably like their home.She tossed it away.Theyre animals, Sergeant, just fucken animals.I dont know, Doc Wilson said.Just because they walk around on all fours, threes maybe, and eat grass.Well, lets check out the brain.She found one that had been hit in the head and scraped the superficial black char from the wound.Look at that.It was almost solid bone.She tugged and ruffled the hair all over the head of another one.What the hell does it use for sensory organs?No eyes, or ears, or She stood up.Nothing in that fucken head but a mouth and ten centimeters of skull.To protect nothing, not a fucken thing.If I could shrug, Id shrug, the doctor said.It doesnt prove anything  a brain doesnt have to look like a mushy walnut and it doesnt have to be in the head.Maybe that skull isnt bone, maybe thats the brain, some crystal lattice  Yeah, but the fucken stomachs in the right place, and if those arent intestines Ill eat  Look, Cortez said, this is real interesting, but all we need to know is whether that things dangerous, then weve gotta move on; we dont have all  They arent dangerous, Rogers began.They dont  Medic!DOC!Somebody back at the firing line was waving his arms.Doc sprinted back to him, the rest of us following.Whats wrong?He had reached back and unclipped his medical kit on the run.Its Ho.Shes out.Doc swung open the door on Hos biomedical monitor.He didnt have to look far.Shes dead.Dead?Cortez said.What the hell  Just a minute.Doc plugged a jack into the monitor and fiddled with some dials on his kit.Everybodys biomed readout is stored for twelve hours.Im running it backwards, should be able to  there!What?Four and a half minutes ago  must have been when you opened fire, Jesus!Well?
