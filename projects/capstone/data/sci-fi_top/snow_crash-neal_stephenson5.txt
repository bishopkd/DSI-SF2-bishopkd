Behind the counter, a pudgy high school babe, dishwater blond hair that has been worked over pretty good with a curling iron, blue metal flake eyeshadow, an even coat of red makeup covering her broad, gelatinous cheeks, a flimsy sort of choir robe thrown over her T shirt.When Y. T.  comes in, she is right in the middle of a transaction.She sees Y. T.  right away, but no three ring binder anywhere in the world allows you to flag or fail in the middle of a transaction.Stymied, Y. T.  sighs and crosses her arms to convey impatience.In any other business establishment, she'd already be raising hell and marching around behind the counter as if she owned the place.But this is a church, damn it.There's a little rack along the front of the counter bearing religious tracts, free for the taking, donation requested.Several slots on the rack are occupied by the Reverend Wayne's famous bestseller.How America Was Saved from Communism: EL VIS SHOT JFK.She pulls out the envelope that the man with the glass eye stuck into her pocket.It is not thick and soft enough to contain a lot of cash, unfortunately.It contains half a dozen snapshots.All of them feature Uncle Enzo.He is on the broad, flat horseshoe driveway of a large house, larger than any house Y. T.  has ever seen with her own two eyes.He is standing on a skateboard.Or falling off of a skateboard.Or coasting, slowly, arms splayed wildly out to the sides, chased by nervous security personnel.A piece of paper is wrapped around the pictures.It says: Y. T. Thanks for your help.As you can see from these pictures, I tried to train for this assignment, but it's going to take some practice.Your friend, Uncle Enzo.Y. T.  wraps the pictures up just the way they were, puts them back in her pocket, stifles a smile, returns to business matters.The girl in the robe is still performing her transaction behind the counter.The transactee is a stocky Spanish speaking woman in an orange dress.The girl types some stuff into the computer.The customer snaps her Visa card down on the fake wood altar top; it sounds like a rifle shot.The girl pries the card up using her inch long fingernails, a dicey and complicated operation that makes Y. T.  think of insects climbing out of their egg sacs.Then she performs the sacrament, swiping the card through its electromagnetic slot with a carefully modulated sweep of the arm, as though tearing back a veil, handing over the slip, mumbling that she needs a signature and daytime phone number.She might as well have been speaking Latin, but that's okay, since this customer is familiar with the liturgy and signs and numbers it before the words are fully spoken.Then it just remains for the Word from On High.But computers and communications are awfully good these days, and it usually doesn't take longer than a couple of seconds to perform a charge card verification.The little machine beeps out its approval code, heavenly tunes sing out from tinny speakers, and a wide pair of pearlescent doors in the back of the room swing majestically open.Thank you for your donation, the girl says, slurring the words together into a single syllable.The customer stomps toward the double doors, drawn in by hypnotic organ strains.The interior of the chapel is weirdly colored, illuminated partly by fluorescent fixtures wedged into the ceiling and partly by large colored light boxes that simulate stained glass windows.The largest of these, shaped like a fattened Gothic arch, is bolted to the back wall, above the altar, and features a blazing trinity: Jesus, Elvis, and the Reverend Wayne.Jesus gets top billing.The worshipper is not half a dozen steps into the place before she thuds down on her knees in the middle of the aisle and begins to speak in tongues: ar ia ari ar isa ve na a mir ia i sa, ve na a mir ia a sar ia ...The doors swing shut again.Just a sec, the girl says, looking at Y. T.  a little nervously.She goes around the corner and stands in the middle of the toy area, inadvertently getting the hem of her robe caught up in a Ninja Raft Warriors battle module, and knocks on the door to the potty.Busy!says a man's voice from the other side of the door.The Kourier's here, the girl says.I'll be right out, the man says, more quietly.And he really is right out.Y. T.  does not perceive any waiting time, no zipping up of the fly or washing of the hands.He is wearing a black suit with a clerical collar, pulling a lightweight black robe on over that as he emerges into the toy area, crushing little action figures and fighter aircraft beneath his black shoes.His hair is black and well greased, with individual strands of gray, and he wears wire rimmed bifocals with a subtle brownish tint.He has very large pores.And by the time he gets close enough that Y. T.  can see all of these details, she can also smell him.She smells Old Spice, plus a strong whiff of vomit on his breath.But it's not boozy vomit.Gimme that, he says, and yanks the aluminum briefcase from her hand.Y. T.  never lets people do that.You have to sign for it, she says.But she knows it's too late.If you don't get them to sign first, you're screwed.You have no power, no leverage.You're just a brat on a skateboard.Which is why Y. T.  never lets people yank deliveries out of her hand.But this guy is a minister, for God's sake.She just didn't reckon on it.He yanked it out of her handand now he runs with it back to his office.I can sign for it, the girl says.She looks scared.More than that, she looks sick.It has to be him personally, Y. T.  says.Reverend Dale T.  Thorpe.Now she's done being shocked and starting to be pissed.So she just follows him right into his office.You can't go in there, the girl says, but she says it dreamily, sadly, like this whole thing is already half forgotten.Y. T.  opens the door.The Reverend Dale T.  Thorpe sits at his desk.The aluminum briefcase is open in front of him.It is filled with the same complicated bit of business that she saw the other night, after the Raven thing.The Reverend Dale T.  Thorpe seems to be leashed by the neck to this device.No, actually he is wearing something on a string around his neck.He was keeping it under his clothes, the way Y. T.  keeps Uncle Enzo's dog tags.He has pulled it out now and shoved it into a slot inside the aluminum case.It appears to be a laminated ID card with a bar code on it.Now he pulls the card out and lets it dangle down his front.Y. T.  cannot tell whether he has noticed her.He is typing on the keyboard, punching away with two fingers, missing letters, doing it again.Then motors and servos inside the aluminum case whir and shudder.The Reverend Dale T.  Thorpe has unsnapped one of the little vials from its place in the lid and inserted it into a socket next to the keyboard.It is slowly drawn down inside the machine.The vial pops back out again.The red plastic cap is emitting grainy red light.It has little LEDs built into it, and they are spelling out numbers, counting down seconds: 5,4,3,2,1 ...The Reverend Dale T.  Thorpe holds the vial up to his left nostril.When the LED counter gets down to zero, it hisses, like air coming out of a tire valve.At the same time, he inhales deeply, sucking it all into his lungs.Then he shoots the vial expertly into his wastebasket.Reverend?the girl says.Y. T.  spins around to see her drifting toward the office.Would you do mine now, please?The Reverend Dale T.  Thorpe does not answer.He has slumped back in his leather swivel chair and is staring at a neon framed blowup of Elvis, in his Army days, holding a rifle.26  When he wakes up, it's the middle of the day and he is all dried out from the sun, and birds are circling overhead, trying to decide whether he's dead or alive.Hiro climbs down from the roof of the turret and, throwing caution to the wind, drinks three glasses of L. A.  tap water.He gets some bacon out of Da5id's fridge and throws it in the microwave.Most of General Jim's people have left, and there is only a token guard of soldiers down on the road.Hiro locks all the doors that look out on the hillside, because he can't stop thinking about Raven.Then he sits at the kitchen table and goggles in.The Black Sun is mostly full of Asians, including a lot of people from the Bombay film industry, glaring at each other, stroking their black mustaches, trying to figure out what kind of hyperviolent action film will play in Persepolis next year.It is nighttime there.Hiro is one of the few Americans in the joint.Along the back wall of the bar is a row of private rooms, ranging from little tte  ttes to big conference rooms where a bunch of avatars can gather and have a meeting.Juanita is waiting for Hiro in one of the smaller ones.Her avatar just looks like Juanita.It is an honest representation, with no effort made to hide the early suggestions of crow's feet at the corners of her big black eyes.Her glossy hair is so well resolved that Hiro can see individual strands refracting the light into tiny rainbows.I'm at Da5id's house.Where are you?Hiro says.In an airplaneso I may break up, Juanita says.You on your way here?To Oregon, actually.Portland?Astoria.Why on earth would you go to Astoria, Oregon, at a time like this?Juanita takes a deep breath, lets it out shakily.If I told you, we'd get into an argument.What's the latest word on Da5id?Hiro says.The same.Any diagnosis?Juanita sighs, looks tired.There won't be any diagnosis, she says.It's a software, not a hardware, problem.Huh?They're rounding up the usual suspects.CAT scans, NMR scans, PET scans, EEGs.Everything's fine.There's nothing wrong with his brainhis hardware.It just happens to be running the wrong program?His software got poisoned.Da5id had a snow crash last night, inside his head.Are you trying to say it's a psychological problem?It kind of goes beyond those established categories, Juanita says, because it's a new phenomenon.A very old one, actually.Does this thing just happen spontaneously, or what?You tell me, she says.You were there last night.Did anything happen after I left?He had a Snow Crash hypercard that he got from Raven outside The Black Sun.Shit.That bastard.Who's the bastard?Raven or Da5id?Da5id.I tried to warn him.He used it.Hiro goes on to explain the Brandy with the magic scroll.Then later he had computer trouble and got bounced.I heard about that part, she says.That's why I called the paramedics.I don't see the connection between Da5id's computer having a crash, and you calling an ambulance.The Brandy's scroll wasn't just showing random static.It was flashing up a large amount of digital information, in binary form.That digital information was going straight into Da5id's optic nerve.Which is part of the brain, incidentallyif you stare into a person's pupil, you can see the terminal of the brain.Da5id's not a computer.He can't read binary code.He's a hacker.He messes with binary code for a living.That ability is firm wired into the deep structures of his brain.So he's susceptible to that form of information.And so are you, home boy.What kind of information are we talking about?Bad news.A metavirus, Juanita says.It's the atomic bomb of informational warfarea virus that causes any system to infect itself with new viruses.And that's what made Da5id sick?Yes.Why didn't I get sick?Too far away.Your eyes couldn't resolve the bitmap.It has to be right up in your face.I'll think about that one, Hiro says.But I have another question.Raven also distributes another drugin Realitycalled, among other things, Snow Crash.What is it?It's not a drug, Juanita says.They make it look like a drug and feel like a drug so that people will want to take it.It's laced with cocaine and some other stuff.If it's not a drug, what is it?It's chemically processed blood serum taken from people who are infected with the metavirus, Juanita says.That is, it's just another way of spreading the infection.Who's spreading it?L.  Bob Rife's private church.All of those people are infected.Hiro puts his head in his hands.He's not exactly thinking about this; he's letting it ricochet around in his skull, waiting for it to come to rest.Wait a minute, Juanita.Make up your mind.This Snow Crash thingis it a virus, a drug, or a religion?Juanita shrugs.What's the difference?That Juanita is talking this way does not make it any easier for Hiro to get back on his feet in this conversation.How can you say that?You're a religious person yourself.Don't lump all religion together.Sorry.All people have religions.It's like we have religion receptors built into our brain cells, or something, and we'll latch onto anything that'll fill that niche for us.Now, religion used to be essentially virala piece of information that replicated inside the human mind, jumping from one person to the next.That's the way it used to be, and unfortunately, that's the way it's headed right now.But there have been several efforts to deliver us from the hands of primitive, irrational religion.The first was made by someone named Enki about four thousand years ago.The second was made by Hebrew scholars in the eighth century B. C. , driven out of their homeland by the invasion of Sargon II, but eventually it just devolved into empty legalism.Another attempt was made by Jesusthat one was hijacked by viral influences within fifty days of his death.The virus was suppressed by the Catholic Church, but we're in the middle of a big epidemic that started in Kansas in 1900 and has been gathering momentum ever since.Do you believe in God or not?Hiro says.First things first.Definitely.Do you believe in Jesus?Yes.But not in the physical, bodily resurrection of Jesus.How can you be a Christian without believing in that?I would say, Juanita says, how can you be a Christian with it?Anyone who takes the trouble to study the gospels can see that the bodily resurrection is a myth that was tacked onto the real story several years after the real histories were written.It's so National Enquirer esque, don't you think?Beyond that, Juanita doesn't have much to say.She doesn't want to get into it now, she says.She doesn't want to prejudice Hiro's thinking at this point.Does that imply that there's going to be some other point?Is this a continuing relationship?Hiro says.Do you want to find the people who infected Da5id?Yes.Hell, Juanita, even if it weren't for the fact that he is my friend, I'd want to find them before they infect me.Look at the Babel stack, Hiro, and then visit me if I get back from Astoria.If you get back?What are you doing there?Research.She's been putting on a businesslike front through this whole talk, spitting out information, telling Hiro the way it is.But she's tired and anxious, and Hiro gets the idea that she's deeply afraid.Good luck, he says.He was all ready to do some flirting with her during this meeting, picking up where they left off last night.But something has changed in Juanita's mind between then and now.Flirting is the last thing on her mind.Juanita's going to do something dangerous in Oregon.She doesn't want Hiro to know about it so that he won't worry.There's some good stuff in the Babel stack about someone named Inanna, she says.Who's Inanna?A Sumerian goddess.I'm sort of in love with her.Anyway, you can't understand what I'm about to do until you understand Inanna.Well, good luck, Hiro says.Say hi to Inanna for me.Thanks.When you get back, I want to spend some time with you.The feeling is mutual, she says.But we have to get out of this first.Oh.I didn't realize I was in something.Don't be a sap.We're all in it.Hiro leaves, exiting into The Black Sun.There is one guy wandering around the Hacker Quadrant who really stands out.His avatar doesn't look so hot.And he's having trouble controlling it.He looks like a guy who's just goggled into the Metaverse for the first time and doesn't know how to move around.He keeps bumping into tables, and when he wants to turn around, he spins around several times, not knowing how to stop himself.Hiro walks toward him, because his face seems a little familiar.When the guy finally stops moving long enough for Hiro to resolve him clearly, he recognizes the avatar.It's a Clint.Most often seen in the company of a Brandy.The Clint recognizes Hiro, and his surprised face comes on for a second, is then replaced by his usual stern, stiff lipped, craggy appearance.He holds up his hands together in front of him, and Hiro sees that he is holding a scroll, just like Brandy's.Hiro reaches for his katana, but the scroll is already up in his face, spreading open to reveal the blue glare of the bitmap inside.He sidesteps, gets over to one side of the Clint, raising the katana overhead, snaps the katana straight down and cuts the Clint's arms off.As the scroll falls, it spreads open even wider.Hiro doesn't dare look at it now.The Clint has turned around and is awkwardly trying to escape from The Black Sun, bouncing from table to table like a pinball.If Hiro could kill the guycut his head offthen his avatar would stay in The Black Sun, be carried away by the Graveyard Daemons.Hiro could do some hacking and maybe figure out who he is, where he's coming in from.But a few dozen hackers are lounging around the bar, watching all of this, and if they come over and look at the scroll, they'll all end up like Da5id.Hiro squats down, looking away from the scroll, and pulls up one of the hidden trapdoors that lead down into the tunnel system.He's the one who coded those tunnels into The Black Sun to begin with; he's the only person in the whole bar who can use them.He sweeps the scroll into the tunnel with one hand, then closes the door.Hiro can see the Clint, way over near the exit, trying to get his avatar aimed out through the door.Hiro runs after him.If the guy reaches the Street, he's gonehe'll turn into a translucent ghost.With a fifty foot head start in a crowd of a million other translucent ghosts, there's just no way.As usual, there's a crowd of wannabes gathered on the Street out front.Hiro can see the usual assortment, including a few black and white people.One of those black and whites is Y. T.  She's loitering out there waiting for Hiro to come out.Y. T. !he shouts.Chase that guy with no arms!Hiro gets out the door just a few seconds after the Clint does.Both the Clint and Y. T.  are already gone.He turns back into The Black Sun, pulls up a trapdoor, and drops down into the tunnel system, the realm of the Graveyard Daemons.One of them has already picked up the scroll and is trudging in toward the center to throw it on the fire.Hey, bud, Hiro says, take a right turn at the next tunnel and leave that thing in my office, okay?But do me a favor and roll it up first.He follows the Graveyard Daemon down the tunnel, under the Street, until they're under the neighborhood where Hiro and the other hackers have their houses.Hiro has the Graveyard Daemon deposit the rolled up scroll in his workshop, down in the basementthe room where Hiro does his hacking.Then Hiro continues upstairs to his office.27  His voice phone is ringing.Hiro picks it up.Pod, Y. T.  says, I was beginning to think you'd never come out of there.Where are you?Hiro says.In Reality or the Metaverse?Both.In the Metaverse, I'm on a plusbound monorail train.Just passed by Port 35.Already?It must be an express.Good thinking.That Clint you cut the arms off of is two cars ahead of me.I don't think he knows I'm following him.Where are you in Reality?Public terminal across the street from a Reverend Wayne's, she says.Oh, yeah?How interesting.Just made a delivery there.What kind of delivery?An aluminum suitcase.He gets the whole story out of her, or what he thinks is the whole storythere's no real way to tell.You're sure that the babbling that the people did in the park was the same as the babbling that the woman did at the Reverend Wayne's?Sure, she says.I know a bunch of people who go there.Or their parents go there and drag them along, you know.To the Reverend Wayne's Pearly Gates?Yeah.And they all do that speaking in tongues.So I've heard it before.I'll talk to you later, pod, Hiro says.I've got some serious research to do.Later.The Babel/Infocalypse card is resting in the middle of his desk.Hiro picks it up.The Librarian comes in.Hiro is about to ask the Librarian whether he knows that Lagos is dead.But it's a pointless question.The Librarian knows it, but he doesn't.If he wanted to check the Library, he could find out in a few moments.But he wouldn't really retain the information.He doesn't have an independent memory.The Library is his memory, and he only uses small parts of it at once.What can you tell me about speaking in tongues?Hiro says.The technical term is glossolalia,' the Librarian says.Technical term?Why bother to have a technical term for a religious ritual?The Librarian raises his eyebrows.Oh, there's a great deal of technical literature on the subject.It is a neurological phenomenon that is merely exploited in religious rituals.It's a Christian thing, right?Pentecostal Christians think so, but they are deluding themselves.Pagan Greeks did itPlato called it theomania.The Oriental cults of the Roman Empire did it.Hudson Bay Eskimos, Chukchi shamans, Lapps, Yakuts, Semang pygmies, the North Borneo cults, the Trhi speaking priests of Ghana.The Zulu Amandiki cult and the Chinese religious sect of Shang ti hui.Spirit mediums of Tonga and the Brazilian Umbanda cult.The Tungus tribesmen of Siberia say that when the shaman goes into his trance and raves incoherent syllables, he learns the entire language of Nature.The language of Nature.Yes, sir.The Sukuma people of Africa say that the language is kinaturu, the tongue of the ancestors of all magicians, who are thought to have descended from one particular tribe.What causes it?If mystical explanations are ruled out, then it seems that glossolalia comes from structures buried deep within the brain, common to all people.What does it look like?How do these people act?C.  W.  Shumway observed the Los Angeles revival of 1906 and noted six basic symptoms: complete loss of rational control; dominance of emotion that leads to hysteria; absence of thought or will; automatic functioning of the speech organs; amnesia; and occasional sporadic physical manifestations such as jerking or twitching.Eusebius observed similar phenomena around the year 300, saying that the false prophet begins by a deliberate suppression of conscious thought, and ends in a delirium over which he has no control.What's the Christian justification for this?Is there anything in the Bible that backs this up?Pentecost.You mentioned that word earlierwhat is it?From the Greek pentekostos, meaning fiftieth.It refers to the fiftieth day after the Crucifixion.Juanita just told me that Christianity was hijacked by viral influences when it was only fifty days old.She must have been talking about this.What is it?And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men from every nation under heaven.And at this sound the multitude came together, and they were bewildered, because each one heard them speaking in his own language.And they were amazed and wondered, saying, Are not all these who are speaking Galileans?And how is it that we hear, each of us in his own native language?Parthians and Medes and Elamites and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabians, we hear them telling in our own tongues the mighty works of God.And all were amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, What does this mean? 'Acts 2:412.Damned if I know, Hiro says.Sounds like Babel in reverse.Yes, sir.Many Pentecostal Christians believe that the gift of tongues was given to them so that they could spread their religion to other peoples without having to actually learn their language.The word for that is xenoglossy. 'That's what Rife was claiming in that piece of videotape, on top of the Enterprise.He said he could understand what those Bangladeshis were saying.Yes, sir.Does that really work?In the sixteenth century, Saint Louis Bertrand allegedly used the gift of tongues to convert somewhere between thirty thousand and three hundred thousand South American Indians to Christianity, the Librarian says.Wow.Spread through that population even faster than smallpox.What did the Jews think of this Pentecost thing?Hiro says.They were still running the country, right?The Romans were running the country, the Librarian says, but there were a number of Jewish religious authorities.At this time, there were three groups of Jews: the Pharisees, the Sadducees, and the Essenes.I remember the Pharisees from Jesus Christ, Superstar.They were the ones with the deep voices who were always hassling Christ.They were hassling him, the Librarian says, because they were religiously very strict.They adhered to a strong legalistic version of the religion; to them, the Law was everything.Clearly, Jesus was a threat to them because he was proposing, in effect, to do away with the Law.He wanted a contract renegotiation with God.This sounds like an analogy, which I am not very good atbut even if it is taken literally, it is true.Who were the other two groups?The Sadducees were materialists.Meaning what?They drove BMWs?No.Materialists in the philosophical sense.All philosophies are either monist or dualist.Monists believe that the material world is the only worldhence, materialists.Dualists believe in a binary universe, that there is a spiritual world in addition to the material world.Well, as a computer geek, I have to believe in the binary universe.The Librarian raises his eyebrows.How does that follow?Sorry.It's a joke.A bad pun.See, computers use binary code to represent information.So I was joking that I have to believe in the binary universe, that I have to be a dualist.How droll, the Librarian says, not sounding very amused.Your joke may not be without genuine merit, however.How's that?I was just kidding, really.Computers rely on the one and the zero to represent all things.This distinction between something and nothingthis pivotal separation between being and nonbeingis quite fundamental and underlies many Creation myths.Hiro feels his face getting slightly warm, feels himself getting annoyed.He suspects that the Librarian may be pulling his leg, playing him for a fool.But he knows that the Librarian, however convincingly rendered he may be, is just a piece of software and cannot actually do such things.Even the word science' comes from an Indo European root meaning to cut' or to separate. 'The same root led to the word shit,' which of course means to separate living flesh from nonliving waste.The same root gave us scythe' and scissors' and schism,' which have obvious connections to the concept of separation.How about sword'?From a root with several meanings.One of those meanings is to cut or pierce. 'One of them is post' or rod. 'And the other is, simply, to speak. 'Let's stay on track, Hiro says.Fine.I can return to this potential conversation fork at a later time, if you desire.I don't want to get all forked up at this point.Tell me about the third groupthe Essenes.They lived communally and believed that physical and spiritual cleanliness were intimately connected.They were constantly bathing themselves, lying naked under the sun, purging themselves with enemas, and going to extreme lengths to make sure that their food was pure and uncontaminated.They even had their own version of the Gospels in which Jesus healed possessed people, not with miracles, but by driving parasites, such as tapeworm, out of their body.These parasites are considered to be synonymous with demons.They sound kind of like hippies.The connection has been made before, but it is faulty in many ways.The Essenes were strictly religious and would never have taken drugs.So to them there was no difference between infection with a parasite, like tapeworm, and demonic possession.Correct.Interesting.I wonder what they would have thought about computer viruses?Speculation is not in my ambit.Speaking of whichLagos was babbling to me about viruses and infection and something called a namshub.What does that mean?Nam shub is a word from Sumerian.Sumerian?Yes, sir.Used in Mesopotamia until roughly 2000 B. C.  The oldest of all written languages.Oh.So all the other languages are descended from it?For a moment, the Librarian's eyes glance upward, as if he's thinking about something.This is a visual cue to inform Hiro that he's making a momentary raid on the Library.Actually, no, the Librarian says.No languages whatsoever are descended from Sumerian.It is an agglutinative tongue, meaning that it is a collection of morphemes or syllables that are grouped into wordsvery unusual.You are saying, Hiro says, remembering Da5id in the hospital, that if I could hear someone speaking Sumerian, it would sound like a long stream of short syllables strung together.Yes, sir.Would it sound anything like glossolalia?Judgment call.Ask someone real, the Librarian says.Does it sound like any modern tongue?There is no provable genetic relationship between Sumerian and any tongue that came afterward.That's odd.My Mesopotamian history is rusty, Hiro says.What happened to the Sumerians?Genocide?No, sir.They were conquered, but there's no evidence of genocide per se.Everyone gets conquered sooner or later, Hiro says.But their languages don't die out.Why did Sumerian disappear?Since I am just a piece of code, I would be on very thin ice to speculate, the Librarian says.Okay.Does anyone understand Sumerian?Yes, at any given time, it appears that there are roughly ten people in the world who can read it.Where do they work?One in Israel.One at the British Museum.One in Iraq.One at the University of Chicago.One at the University of Pennsylvania.And five at Rife Bible College in Houston, Texas.Nice distribution.And have any of these people figured out what the word nam shub' means in Sumerian?Yes.A nam shub is a speech with magical force.The closest English equivalent would be incantation,' but this has a number of incorrect connotations.Did the Sumerians believe in magic?The Librarian shakes his head minutely.This is the kind of seemingly precise question that is in fact very profound, and that pieces of software, such as myself, are notoriously clumsy at.Allow me to quote from Kramer, Samuel Noah, and Maier, John R.  Myths of Enki, the Crafty God.New York, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1989: Religion, magic, and medicine are so completely intertwined in Mesopotamia that separating them is frustrating and perhaps futile work....[Sumerian incantations] demonstrate an intimate connection between the religious, the magical, and the esthetic so complete that any attempt to pull one away from the other will distort the whole. 'There is more material in here that might help explain the subject.In where?In the next room, the Librarian says, gesturing at the wall.He walks over and slides the rice paper partition out of the way.A speech with magical force.Nowadays, people don't believe in these kinds of things.Except in the Metaverse, that is, where magic is possible.The Metaverse is a fictional structure made out of code.And code is just a form of speechthe form that computers understand.The Metaverse in its entirety could be considered a single vast nam shub, enacting itself on L.  Bob Rife's fiber optic network.The voice phone rings.Just a second, Hiro says.Take your time, the Librarian says, not adding the obvious reminder that he can wait for a million years if need be.Me again, Y. T.  says.I'm still on the train.Stumps got off at Express Port 127.Hmm.That's the antipode of Downtown.I mean, it's as far away from Downtown as you can get.It is?Yeah.One two seven is two to the seventh power minus one  Spare me, I take your word for it.It's definitely out in the middle of fucking nowhere, she says.You didn't get off and follow him?Are you kidding?All the way out there?It's ten thousand miles from the nearest building, Hiro.She has a point.The Metaverse was built with plenty of room to expand.Almost all of the development is within two or three Express Portsfive hundred kilometers or soof Downtown.Port 127 is twenty thousand miles away.What is there?A black cube exactly twenty miles on a side.Totally black?Yeah.How can you measure a black cube that big?I'm riding along looking at the stars, okay?Suddenly, I can't see them anymore on the right side of the train.I start counting local ports.I count sixteen of them.We get to Express Port 127, and Stumpy climbs off and goes toward the black thing.I count sixteen more local ports and then the stars come out.Then I take thirty two kilometers and multiply it by point six and I get twenty milesyou asshole.That's good, Hiro says.That's good intel.Who do you think owns a black cube twenty miles across?Just going on pure, irrational bias, I'm guessing L.  Bob Rife.Supposedly, he has a big hunk of real estate out in the middle of nowhere where he keeps all the guts of the Metaverse.Some of us used to smash into it occasionally when we were out racing motorcycles.Well, gotta go, pod.28  Hiro hangs up and walks into the new room.The Librarian follows.It is about fifty feet on a side.The center of the space is occupied by three large artifacts, or rather three dimensional renderings of artifacts.In the center is a thick slab of baked clay, hanging in space, about the size of a coffee table, and about a foot thick.Hiro suspects that it is a magnified rendering of a smaller object.The broad surfaces of the slab are entirely covered with angular writing that Hiro recognizes as cuneiform.Around the edges are rounded, parallel depressions that appear to have been made by fingers as they shaped the slab.To the right of the slab is a wooden pole with branches on top, sort of a stylized tree.To the left of the slab is an eight foot high obelisk, also covered with cuneiform, with a bas relief figure chiseled into the top.The room is filled with a three dimensional constellation of hypercards, hanging weightlessly in the air.It looks like a high speed photograph of a blizzard in progress.In some places, the hypercards are placed in precise geometric patterns, like atoms in a crystal.In other places, whole stacks of them are clumped together.Drifts of them have accumulated in the corners, as though Lagos tossed them away when he was finished.Hiro finds that his avatar can walk right through the hypercards without disturbing the arrangement.It is, in fact, the three dimensional counterpart of a messy desktop, all the trash still remaining wherever Lagos left it.The cloud of hypercards extends to every corner of the 50 by 50 foot space, and from floor level all the way up to about eight feet, which is about as high as Lagos's avatar could reach.How many hypercards in here?Ten thousand, four hundred and sixty three, the Librarian says.I don't really have time to go through them, Hiro says.Can you give me some idea of what Lagos was working on here?Well, I can read back the names of all the cards if you'd like.Lagos grouped them into four broad categories: Biblical studies, Sumerian studies, neurolinguistic studies, and intel gathered on L.  Bob Rife.Without going into that kind of detailwhat did Lagos have on his mind?What was he getting at?What do I look like, a psychologist?the Librarian says.I can't answer those kinds of questions.Let me try it again.How does this stuff connect, if at all, to the subject of viruses?The connections are elaborate.Summarizing them would require both creativity and discretion.As a mechanical entity, I have neither.How old is this stuff?Hiro says, gesturing to the three artifacts.The clay envelope is Sumerian.It is from the third millennium B. C.  It was dug up from the city of Eridu in southern Iraq.The black stele or obelisk is the Code of Hammurabi, which dates from about 1750 B. C.  The tree like structure is a Yahwistic cult totem from Palestine.It's called an asherah.It's from about 900 B. C.   Did you call that slab an envelope?Yes.It has a smaller clay slab wrapped up inside of it.This was how the Sumerians made tamper proof documents.All these things are in a museum somewhere, I take it?The asherah and the Code of Hammurabi are in museums.The clay envelope is in the personal collection of L.  Bob Rife.L.  Bob Rife is obviously interested in this stuff.Rife Bible College, which he founded, has the richest archaeology department in the world.They have been conducting a dig in Eridu, which was the cult center of a Sumerian god named Enki.How are these things related to each other?The Librarian raises his eyebrows.I'm sorry?Well, let's try process of elimination.Do you know why Lagos found Sumerian writings interesting as opposed to, say, Greek or Egyptian?Egypt was a civilization of stone.They made their art and architecture of stone, so it lasts forever.But you can't write on stone.So they invented papyrus and wrote on that.But papyrus is perishable.So even though their art and architecture have survived, their written recordstheir datahave largely disappeared.What about all those hieroglyphic inscriptions?Bumper stickers, Lagos called them.Corrupt political speech.They had an unfortunate tendency to write inscriptions praising their own military victories before the battles had actually taken place.And Sumer is different?Sumer was a civilization of clay.They made their buildings of it and wrote on it, too.Their statues were of gypsum, which dissolves in water.So the buildings and statues have since fallen apart under the elements.But the clay tablets were either baked or else buried in jars.So all the data of the Sumerians have survived.Egypt left a legacy of art and architecture; Sumer's legacy is its megabytes.How many megabytes?As many as archaeologists bother to dig up.The Sumerians wrote on everything.When they built a building, they would write in cuneiform on every brick.When the buildings fell down, these bricks would remain, scattered across the desert.In the Koran, the angels who are sent to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah say, We are sent forth to a wicked nation, so that we may bring down on them a shower of clay stones marked by your Lord for the destruction of the sinful. 'Lagos found this interestingthis promiscuous dispersal of information, written on a medium that lasts forever.He spoke of pollen blowing in the windI gather that this was some kind of analogy.It was.Tell mehas the inscription on this clay envelope been translated?Yes.It is a warning.It says, This envelope contains the nam shub of Enki. 'I know what a nam shub is.What is the nam shub of Enki?The Librarian stares off into the distance and clears his throat dramatically.Once upon a time, there was no snake, there was no scorpion,  There was no hyena, there was no lion,  There was no wild dog, no wolf,  There was no fear, no terror,  Man had no rival.In those days, the land Shubur Hamazi,  Harmony tongued Sumer, the great land of the me of princeship,  Uri, the land having all that is appropriate,  The land Martu, resting in security,  The whole universe, the people well cared for,  To Enlil in one tongue gave speech.Then the lord defiant, the prince defiant, the king defiant,  Enki, the lord of abundance, whose commands are trustworthy,  The lord of wisdom, who scans the land,  The leader of the gods,  The lord of Eridu, endowed with wisdom,  Changed the speech in their mouths, put contention into it,  Into the speech of man that had been one.That is Kramer's translation.That's a story, Hiro says.I thought a nam shub was an incantation.The nam shub of Enki is both a story and an incantation, the Librarian says.A self fulfilling fiction.Lagos believed that in its original form, which this translation only hints at, it actually did what it describes.You mean, changed the speech in men's mouths.Yes, the Librarian says.This is a Babel story, isn't it?Hiro says.Everyone was speaking the same language, and then Enki changed their speech so that they could no longer understand each other.This must be the basis for the Tower of Babel stuff in the Bible.This room contains a number of cards tracing that connection, the Librarian says.You mentioned before that at one point, everyone spoke Sumerian.Then, nobody did.It just vanished, like the dinosaurs.And there's no genocide to explain how that happened.Which is consistent with the Tower of Babel story, and the nam shub of Enki.Did Lagos think that Babel really happened?He was sure of it.He was quite concerned about the vast number of human languages.He felt there were simply too many of them.How many?Tens of thousands.In many parts of the world, you will find people of the same ethnic group, living a few miles apart in similar valleys under similar conditions, speaking languages that have absolutely nothing in common with each other.This sort of thing is not an oddityit is ubiquitous.Many linguists have tried to understand Babel, the question of why human language tends to fragment, rather than converging on a common tongue.Has anyone come up with an answer yet?The question is difficult and profound, the Librarian says.Lagos had a theory.Yes?He believed that Babel was an actual historical event.That it happened in a particular time and place, coinciding with the disappearance of the Sumerian language.That prior to Babel/Infocalypse, languages tended to converge.And that afterward, languages have always had an innate tendency to diverge and become mutually incomprehensiblethat this tendency is, as he put it, coiled like a serpent around the human brainstem.The only thing that could explain that is  Hiro stops, not wanting to say it.Yes?the Librarian says.If there was some phenomenon that moved through the population, altering their minds in such a way that they couldn't process the Sumerian language anymore.Kind of in the same way that a virus moves from one computer to another, damaging each computer in the same way.Coiling around the brainstem.Lagos devoted much time and effort to this idea, the Librarian says.He felt that the nam shub of Enki was a neurolinguistic virus.And that this Enki character was a real personage?Possibly.And that Enki invented this virus and spread it throughout Sumer, using tablets like this one?Yes.A tablet has been discovered containing a letter to Enki, in which the writer complains about it.A letter to a god?Yes.It is from Sin samuh, the Scribe.He begins by praising Enki and emphasizing his devotion to him.Then he complains:    Like a young ...(line broken)  I am paralyzed at the wrist.Like a wagon on the road when its yoke has split,  I stand immobile on the road.I lay on a bed called O!and O No!I let out a wail.My graceful figure is stretched neck to ground,  I am paralyzed of foot.My ...has been carried off into the earth.My frame has changed.At night I cannot sleep,  my strength has been struck down,  my life is ebbing away.The bright day is made a dark day for me.I have slipped into my own grave.I, a writer who knows many things, am made a fool.My hand has stopped writing  There is no talk in my mouth. 'After more description of his woes, the scribe ends with,    My god, it is you I fear.I have written you a letter.Take pity on me.The heart of my god: have it given back to me. '29  Y. T.  is maxing at a Mom's Truck Stop on 405, waiting for her ride.Not that she would ever be caught dead at a Mom's Truck Stop.If, like, a semi ran her over with all eighteen of its wheels in front of a Mom's Truck Stop, she would drag herself down the shoulder of the highway using her eyelid muscles until she reached a Snooze 'n' Cruise full of horny derelicts rather than go into a Mom's Truck Stop.But sometimes when you're a professional, they give you a job that you don't like, and you just have to be very cool and put up with it.For purposes of this evening's job, the man with the glass eye has already supplied her with a driver and security person, as he put it.A totally unknown quantity.Y. T.  isn't sure she likes putting up with some mystery guy.She has this image in her mind that he's going to be like the wrestling coach at the high school.That would be so grotendous.Anyway, this is where she's supposed to meet him.Y. T.  orders a coffee and a slice of cherry pie  la mode.She carries them over to the public Street terminal back in the corner.It is sort of a wraparound stainless steel booth stuck between a phone booth, which has a homesick truck driver poured into it, and a pinball machine, which features a chick with big boobs that light up when you shoot the ball up the magic Fallopians.She's not that good at the Metaverse, but she knows her way around, and she's got an address.And finding an address in the Metaverse shouldn't be any more difficult than doing it in Reality, at least if you're not a totally retarded ped.As soon as she steps out into the Street, people start giving her these looks.The same kind of looks that people give her when she walks through the worsted wool desolation of the Westlake Corporate Park in her dynamic blue and orange Kourier gear.She knows that the people in the Street are giving her dirty looks because she's just coming in from a shitty public terminal.She's a trashy black and white person.The built up part of the Street, around Port Zero, forms a luminescent thunderhead off to her right.She puts her back to it and climbs onto the monorail.She'd like to go into town, but that's an expensive part of the Street to visit, and she'd be dumping money into the coin slot about every one tenth of a millisecond.The guy's name is Ng.In Reality, he is somewhere in Southern California.Y. T.  isn't sure exactly what he is driving; some kind of a van full of what the man with the glass eye described as stuff, really incredible stuff that you don't need to know about.In the Metaverse, he lives outside of town, around Port 2, where things really start to spread out.Ng's Metaverse home is a French colonial villa in the prewar village of My Tho in the Mekong Delta.Visiting him is like going to Vietnam in about 1955, except that you don't have to get all sweaty.In order to make room for this creation, he has laid claim to a patch of Metaverse space a couple of miles off the Street.There's no monorail service in this low rent development, so Y. T.'s avatar has to walk the entire way.He has a large office with French doors and a balcony looking out over endless rice paddies where little Vietnamese people work.Clearly, this guy is a fairly hardcore techie, because Y. T.  counts hundreds of people out in his rice paddies, plus dozens more running around the village, all of them fairly well rendered and all of them doing different things.She's not a bithead, but she knows that this guy is throwing a lot of computer time into the task of creating a realistic view out his office window.And the fact that it's Vietnam makes it twisted and spooky.Y. T.  can't wait to tell Roadkill about this place.She wonders if it has bombings and strafings and napalm drops.That would be the best.Ng himself, or at least, Ng's avatar, is a small, very dapper Vietnamese man in his fifties, hair plastered to his head, wearing military style khakis.At the time Y. T.  comes into his office, he is leaning forward in his chair, getting his shoulders rubbed by a geisha.A geisha in Vietnam?Y. T.'s grandpa, who was there for a while, told her that the Nipponese took over Vietnam during the war and treated it with the cruelty that was their trademark before we nuked them and they discovered that they were pacifists.The Vietnamese, like most other Asians, hate the Japanese.And apparently this Ng character gets a kick out of the idea of having a Japanese geisha around to rub his back.But it is a very strange thing to do, for one reason: The geisha is just a picture on Ng's goggles, and on Y. T.'s.And you can't get a massage from a picture.So why bother?When Y. T.  comes in, Ng stands up and bows.This is how hardcore Street wackos greet each other.They don't like to shake hands because you can't actually feel the contact and it reminds you that you're not even really there.Yeah, hi, Y. T.  says.Ng sits back down and the geisha goes right back to it.Ng's desk is a nice French antique with a row of small television monitors along the back edge, facing toward him.He spends most of his time watching the monitors, even when he is talking.They told me a little bit about you, Ng says.Shouldn't listen to nasty rumors, Y. T.  says.Ng picks up a glass from his desk and takes a drink from it.It looks like a mint julep.Globes of condensation form on its surface, break loose, and trickle down the side.The rendering is so perfect that Y. T.  can see a miniaturized reflection of the office windows in each drop of condensation.It's just totally ostentatious.What a bithead.He is looking at her with a totally emotionless face, but Y. T.  imagines that it is a face of hate and disgust.To spend all this money on the coolest house in the Metaverse and then have some skater come in done up in grainy black and white.It must be a real kick in the metaphorical nuts.Somewhere in this house a radio is going, playing a mix of Vietnamese loungy type stuff and Yank wheelchair rock.Are you a Nova Sicilia citizen?Ng says.No.I just chill sometimes with Uncle Enzo and the other Mafia dudes.Ah.Very unusual.Ng is not a man in a hurry.He has soaked up the languid pace of the Mekong Delta and is content to sit there and watch his TV sets and fire off a sentence every few minutes.Another thing: He apparently has Tourette's syndrome or some other brain woes because from time to time, for no apparent reason, he makes strange noises with his mouth.They have the twangy sound that you always hear from Vietnamese when they are in the back rooms of stores and restaurants carrying on family disputes in the mother tongue, but as far as Y. T.  can tell, they aren't real words, just sound effects.Do you work a lot for these guys?Y. T.  asks.Occasional small security jobs.Unlike most large corporations, the Mafia has a strong tradition of handling its own security arrangements.But when something especially technical is called for  He pauses in the middle of this sentence to make an incredible zooming sound in his nose.Is that your thing?Security?Ng scans all of his TV sets.He snaps his fingers and the geisha scurries out of the room.He folds his hands together on his desk and leans forward.He stares at Y. T.  Yes, he says.Y. T.  looks back at him for a bit, waiting for him to continue.After a few seconds his attention drifts back to the monitors.I do most of my work under a large contract with Mr.Lee, he blurts.Y. T.  is waiting for the continuation of this sentence: Not Mr.Lee, but Mr.Lee's Greater Hong Kong.Oh, well.If she can drop Uncle Enzo's name, he can drop Mr.Lee's.The social structure of any nation state is ultimately determined by its security arrangements, Ng says, and Mr.Lee understands this.Oh, wow, we're going to be profound now.Ng is suddenly talking just like the old white men on the TV pundit powwows, which Y. T.'s mother watches obsessively.Instead of hiring a large human security forcewhich impacts the social environmentyou know, lots of minimum wage earners standing around carrying machine gunsMr.Lee prefers to use nonhuman systems.Nonhuman systems.Y. T.  is about to ask him, what do you know about the Rat Thing.But it is pointless; he won't say.It would get their relationship off on the wrong foot, Y. T.  asking Ng for intel, intel that he would never give her, and that would make this whole scene even weirder than it is now, which Y. T.  can't even imagine.Ng bursts forth with a long string of twangy noises, pops, and glottal stops.Fucking bitch, he mumbles.Excuse me?Nothing, he says, a bimbo box cut me off.None of these people understand that with this vehicle, I could crush them like a potbellied pig under an armored personnel carrier.A bimbo boxyou're driving?Yes.I'm coming to pick you upremember?Do you mind?No, he sighs, as if he really does.Y. T.  gets up and walks around behind his desk to look.Each of the little TV monitors is showing a different view out his van: windshield, left window, right window, rearview.Another one has an electronic map showing his position: inbound on the San Bernardino, not far away.The van is under voice command, he explains.I removed the steering wheel and pedal interface because I found verbal commands more convenient.This is why I will sometimes make unfamiliar sounds with my voiceI am controlling the vehicle's systems.Y. T.  signs off from the Metaverse for a while, to clear her head and take a leak.When she takes off the goggles she discovers that she has built up quite an audience of truckers and mechanics, who are standing around the terminal booth in a semicircle listening to her jabber at Ng.When she stands up, attention shifts to her butt, naturally.Y. T.  hits the bathroom, finishes her pie, and wanders out into the ultraviolet glare of the setting sun to wait for Ng.Recognizing his van is easy enough.It is enormous.It is eight feet high and wider than it is high, which would have made it a wide load in the old days when they had laws.The construction is boxy and angular; it has been welded together out of the type of flat, dimpled steel plate usually used to make manhole lids and stair treads.The tires are huge, like tractor tires with a more subtle tread, and there are six of them: two axles in back and one in front.The engine is so big that, like an evil space ship in a movie, Y. T.  feels its rumbling in her ribs before she can see it; it is kicking out diesel exhaust through a pair of squat vertical red smokestacks that project from the roof, toward the rear.The windshield is a perfectly flat rectangle of glass about three by eight feet, smoked so black that Y. T.  can't make out an outline of anything inside.The snout of the van is festooned with every type of high powered light known to science, like this guy hit a New South Africa franchise on a Saturday night and stole every light off every roll bar, and a grille has been constructed across the front, welded together out of rails torn out of an abandoned railroad somewhere.The grille alone probably weighs more than a small car.The passenger door swings open.Y. T.  walks over and climbs into the front seat.Hi, she is saying.You need to take a whiz or anything?Ng isn't there.Or maybe he is.Where the driver's seat ought to be, there is a sort of neoprene pouch about the size of a garbage can suspended from the ceiling by a web of straps, shock cords, tubes, wires, fiber optic cables, and hydraulic lines.It is swathed in so much stuff that it is hard to make out its actual outlines.At the top of this pouch, Y. T.  can see a patch of skin with some black hair around itthe top of a balding man's head.Everything else, from the temples downward, is encased in an enormous goggle/mask/headphone/feeding tube unit, held onto his head by smart straps that are constantly tightening and loosening themselves to keep the device comfortable and properly positioned.Below this, on either side, where you'd sort of expect to see arms, huge bundles of wires, fiber optics, and tubes run up out of the floor and are seemingly plugged into Ng's shoulder sockets.There is a similar arrangement where his legs are supposed to be attached, and more stuff going into his groin and hooked up to various locations on his torso.The entire thing is swathed in a one piece coverall, a pouch, larger than his torso ought to be, that is constantly bulging and throbbing as though alive.Thank you, all my needs are taken care of, Ng says.The door slams shut behind her.Ng makes a yapping sound, and the van pulls out onto the frontage road, headed back toward 405.Please excuse my appearance, he says, after a couple of awkward minutes.My helicopter caught fire during the evacuation of Saigon in 1974a stray tracer from ground forces.Whoa.What a drag.I was able to reach an American aircraft carrier off the coast, but you know, the fuel was spraying around quite a bit during the fire.Yeah, I can imagine, uh huh.I tried prostheses for a whilesome of them are very good.But nothing is as good as a motorized wheelchair.And then I got to thinking, why do motorized wheelchairs always have to be tiny pathetic things that strain to go up a little teeny ramp?So I bought thisit is an airport firetruck from Germanyand converted it into my new motorized wheelchair.It's very nice.America is wonderful because you can get anything on a drive through basis.Oil change, liquor, banking, car wash, funerals, anything you wantdrive through!So this vehicle is much better than a tiny pathetic wheelchair.It is an extension of my body.When the geisha rubs your back?Ng mumbles something and his pouch begins to throb and undulate around his body.She is a daemon, of course.As for the massage, my body is suspended in an electrocontractive gel that massages me when I need it.I also have a Swedish girl and an African woman, but those daemons are not as well rendered.And the mint julep?Through a feeding tube.Nonalcoholic, ha ha.So, Y. T.  says at some point, when they are way past LAX, and she figures it's too late to chicken out, what's the plan?Do we have a plan?We go to Long Beach.To the Terminal Island Sacrifice Zone.And we buy some drugs, Ng says.Or you do, actually, since I am indisposed.That's my job?To buy some drugs?Buy them, and throw them up in the air.In a Sacrifice Zone?Yes.And we'll take care of the rest.Who's we, dude?There are several more, uh, entities that will help us.What, is the back of the van full of morepeople like you?Sort of, Ng says.You are close to the truth.Would these be, like, nonhuman systems?That is a sufficiently all inclusive term, I think.Y. T.  figures that for a big yes.You tired?Want me to drive or anything?Ng laughs sharply, like distant ack ack, and the van almost swerves off the road.Y. T.  doesn't get the sense that he is laughing at the joke; he is laughing at what a jerk Y. T.  is.30  Okay, last time we were talking about the clay envelope.But what about this thing?The thing that looks like a tree?Hiro says, gesturing to one of the artifacts.A totem of the goddess Asherah, the Librarian says crisply.Now we're getting somewhere, Hiro says.Lagos said that the Brandy in The Black Sun was a cult prostitute of Asherah.So who is Asherah?She was the consort of El, who is also known as Yahweh, the Librarian says.She also was known by other names: Elat, her most common epithet.The Greeks knew her as Dione or Rhea.The Canaanites knew her as Tannit or Hawwa, which is the same thing as Eve.Eve?The etymology of Tannit' proposed by Cross is: feminine of tannin,' which would mean the one of the serpent. 'Furthermore, Asherah carried a second epithet in the Bronze Age, dat batni,' also the one of the serpent. 'The Sumerians knew her as Nintu or Ninhursag.Her symbol is a serpent coiling about a tree or staff: the caduceus.Who worshipped Asherah?A lot of people, I gather.Everyone who lived between India and Spain, from the second millennium B. C.  up into the Christian era.With the exception of the Hebrews, who only worshipped her until the religious reforms of Hezekiah and, later, Josiah.I thought the Hebrews were monotheists.How could they worship Asherah?Monolatrists.They did not deny the existence of other gods.But they were only supposed to worship Yahweh.Asherah was venerated as the consort of Yahweh.I don't remember anything about God having a wife in the Bible.The Bible didn't exist at that point.Judaism was just a loose collection of Yahwistic cults, each with different shrines and practices.The stories about the Exodus hadn't been formalized into scripture yet.And the later parts of the Bible had not yet happened.Who decided to purge Asherah from Judaism?The deuteronomic schooldefined, by convention, as the people who wrote the book of Deuteronomy as well as Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings.And what kind of people were they?Nationalists.Monarchists.Centralists.The forerunners of the Pharisees.At this time, the Assyrian king Sargon II had recently conquered Samarianorthern Israelforcing a migration of Hebrews southward into Jerusalem.Jerusalem expanded greatly and the Hebrews began to conquer territory to the west, east, and south.It was a time of intense nationalism and patriotic fervor.The deuteronomic school embodied those attitudes in scripture by rewriting and reorganizing the old tales.Rewriting them how?Moses and others believed that the River Jordan was the border of Israel, but the deuteronomists believed that Israel included Transjordan, which justified aggression to the east.There are many other examples: the predeuteronomic law said nothing about a monarch.The Law as laid down by the deuteronomic school reflected a monarchist system.The predeuteronomic law was largely concerned with sacred matters, while the deuteronomic law's main concern is the education of the king and his peoplesecular matters in other words.The deuteronomists insisted on centralizing the religion in the Temple in Jerusalem, destroying the outlying cult centers.And there is another feature that Lagos found significant.And that is?Deuteronomy is the only book of the Pentateuch that refers to a written Torah as comprising the divine will: And when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, he shall write for himself in a book a copy of this law, from that which is in charge of the Levitical priests; and it shall be with him, and he shall read in it all the days of his life, that he may learn to fear the LORD his God, by keeping all the words of this law and these statutes, and doing them; that his heart may not be lifted up above his brethren, and that he may not turn aside from the commandment, either to the right hand or to the left; so that he may continue long in his kingdom, he and his children, in Israel. 'Deuteronomy 17:1820.So the deuteronomists codified the religion.Made it into an organized, self propagating entity, Hiro says.I don't want to say virus.But according to what you just quoted me, the Torah is like a virus.It uses the human brain as a host.The hostthe humanmakes copies of it.And more humans come to synagogue and read it.I cannot process an analogy.But what you say is correct insofar as this: After the deuteronomists had reformed Judaism, instead of making sacrifices, the Jews went to synagogue and read the Book.If not for the deuteronomists, the world's monotheists would still be sacrificing animals and propagating their beliefs through the oral tradition.Sharing needles, Hiro says.When you were going over this stuff with Lagos, did he ever say anything about the Bible being a virus?He said it had certain things in common with a virus, but that it was different.He considered it a benign virus.Like that used for vaccinations.He considered the Asherah virus to be more malignant, capable of being spread through exchange of bodily fluids.So the strict, book based religion of the deuteronomists inoculated the Hebrews against the Asherah virus.In combination with strict monogamy and other kosher practices, yes, the Librarian says.The previous religions, from Sumer up to Deuteronomy, are known as prerational.Judaism was the first of the rational religions.As such, in Lagos's view, it was much less susceptible to viral infection because it was based on fixed, written records.This was the reason for the veneration of the Torah and the exacting care used when making new copies of itinformational hygiene.What are we living in nowadays?The postrational era?Juanita made comments to that effect.I'll bet she did.She's starting to make more sense to me, Juanita is.Oh.She never really made much sense before.I see.I think that if I can just spend enough time with you to figure out what's on Juanita's mindwell, wonderful things could happen.I will try to be of assistance.Back to workthis is no time for a hard on.It seems that Asherah was a carrier of a viral infection.The deuteronomists somehow realized this and exterminated her by blocking all the vectors by which she infected new victims.With reference to viral infections, the Librarian says, if I may make a fairly blunt, spontaneous cross referencesomething I am coded to do at opportune momentsyou may wish to examine herpes simplex, a virus that takes up residence in the nervous system and never leaves.It is capable of carrying new genes into existing neurons and genetically reengineering them.Modern gene therapists use it for this purpose.Lagos thought that herpes simplex might be a modern, benign descendant of Asherah.Not always benign, Hiro says, remembering a friend of his who died of AIDS related complications; in the last days, he had herpes lesions from his lips all the way down his throat.It's only benign because we have immunities.Yes, sir.So did Lagos think that the Asherah virus actually altered the DNA of brain cells?Yes.This was the backbone of his hypothesis that the virus was able to transmute itself from a biologically transmitted string of DNA into a set of behaviors.What behaviors?What was Asherah worship like?Did they do sacrifices?No.But there is evidence of cult prostitutes, both male and female.Does that mean what I think it does?Religious figures who would hang around the temple and fuck people?More or less.Bingo.Great way to spread a virus.Now, I want to jump back to an earlier fork in the conversation.As you wish.I can handle nested forkings to a virtually infinite depth.You made a connection between Asherah and Eve.Evewhose Biblical name is Hawwais clearly the Hebrew interpretation of an older myth.Hawwa is an ophidian mother goddess.Ophidian?Associated with serpents.Asherah is also an ophidian mother goddess.And both are associated with trees as well.Eve, as I recall, is considered responsible for getting Adam to eat the forbidden fruit, from the tree of knowledge of good and evil.Which is to say, it's not just fruitit's data.If you say so, sir.I wonder if viruses have always been with us, or not.There's sort of an implicit assumption that they have been around forever.But maybe that's not true.Maybe there was a period of history when they were nonexistent or at least unusual.And at a certain point, when the metavirus showed up, the number of different viruses exploded, and people started getting sick a whole lot.That would explain the fact that all cultures seem to have a myth about Paradise, and the Fall from Paradise.Perhaps.You told me that the Essenes thought that tapeworms were demons.If they'd known what a virus was, they probably would have thought the same thing.And Lagos told me the other night that, according to the Sumerians, there was no concept of good and evil per se.Correct.According to Kramer and Maier, there are good demons and bad demons.Good ones bring physical and emotional health.Evil ones bring disorientation and a variety of physical and emotional ills....But these demons can hardly be distinguished from the diseases they personify ...and many of the diseases sound, to modern ears, as though they must be psychosomatic. 'That's what the doctors said about Da5id, that his disease must be psychosomatic.I don't know anything about Da5id, except for some rather banal statistics.It's as though good' and evil' were invented by the writer of the Adam and Eve legend to explain why people get sickwhy they have physical and mental viruses.So when Eveor Asherahgot Adam to eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, she was introducing the concept of good and evil into the worldintroducing the metavirus, which creates viruses.Could be.So my next question is: Who wrote the Adam and Eve legend?This is a source of much scholarly argument.What did Lagos think?More to the point, what did Juanita think?Nicolas Wyatt's radical interpretation of the Adam and Eve story supposes that it was, in fact, written as a political allegory by the deuteronomists.I thought they wrote the later books, not Genesis.True.But they were involved in compiling and editing the earlier books as well.For many years, it was assumed that Genesis was written sometime around 900 B. C.  or even earlierlong before the advent of the deuteronomists.But more recent analysis of the vocabulary and content suggests that a great deal of editorial workpossibly even authorial worktook place around the time of the Exile, when the deuteronomists held sway.So they may have rewritten an earlier Adam and Eve myth.They appear to have had ample opportunity.According to the interpretation of Hvidberg and, later, Wyatt, Adam in his garden is a parable for the king in his sanctuary, specifically King Hosea, who ruled the northern kingdom until it was conquered by Sargon II in 722 B. C.   That's the conquest you mentioned earlierthe one that drove the deuteronomists southward toward Jerusalem.Exactly.Now Eden,' which can be understood simply as the Hebrew word for delight,' stands for the happy state in which the king existed prior to the conquest.The expulsion from Eden to the bitter lands to the east is a parable for the massive deportation of Israelites to Assyria following Sargon II's victory.According to this interpretation, the king was enticed away from the path of righteousness by the cult of El, with its associated worship of Asherahwho is commonly associated with serpents, and whose symbol is a tree.And his association with Asherah somehow caused him to be conqueredso when the deuteronomists reached Jerusalem, they recast the Adam and Eve story as a warning to the leaders of the southern kingdom.Yes.And perhaps, because no one was listening to them, perhaps they invented the concept of good and evil in the process, as a hook.Hook?Industry term.Then what happened?Did Sargon II try to conquer the southern kingdom also?His successor, Sennacherib, did.King Hezekiah, who ruled the southern kingdom, prepared for the attack feverishly, making great improvements in the fortifications of Jerusalem, improving its supply of drinking water.He was also responsible for a far reaching series of religious reforms, which he undertook under the direction of the deuteronomists.How did it work out?The forces of Sennacherib surrounded Jerusalem.And that night the angel of the LORD went forth, and slew a hundred and eighty five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians; and when men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.Then Sennacherib king of Assyria departed ... '2 Kings 19:3536.I'll bet he did.So let me get this straight: the deuteronomists, through Hezekiah, impose a policy of informational hygiene on Jerusalem and do some civil engineering workyou said they worked on the water supply?They stopped all the springs and the brook that flowed through the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come and find much water? '2 Chronicles 32: 4.Then the Hebrews carved a tunnel seventeen hundred feet through solid rock to carry that water inside city walls.And then as soon as Sennacherib's soldiers came on the scene, they all dropped dead of what can only be understood as an extremely virulent disease, to which the people of Jerusalem were apparently immune.Hmm, interestingI wonder what got into their water?31  Y. T.  doesn't get down to Long Beach very much, but when she does, she will do just about anything to avoid the Sacrifice Zone.It's an abandoned shipyard the size of a small town.It sticks out into San Pedro Bay, where the older, nastier Burbclaves of the Basinunplanned Burbclaves of tiny asbestos shingled houses patrolled by beetle browed Kampuchean men with pump shotgunsfade off into the foam kissed beaches.Most of it's on the appropriately named Terminal Island, and since her plank doesn't run on the water, that means she can only get in or out by one access road.Like all Sacrifice Zones, this one has a fence around it, with yellow metal signs wired to it every few yards.SACRIFICE ZONE  WARNING.The National Parks Service has declared this area to be a National Sacrifice Zone.The Sacrifice Zone Program was developed to manage parcels of land whose clean up cost exceeds their total future economic value.And like all Sacrifice Zone fences, this one has holes in it and is partially torn down in places.Young men blasted out of their minds on natural and artificial male hormones must have some place to do their idiotic coming of age rituals.They come in from Burbclaves all over the area in their four wheel drive trucks and tear across the open ground, slicing long curling gashes into the clay cap that was placed on the really bad parts to prevent windblown asbestos from blizzarding down over Disneyland.Y. T.  is oddly satisfied to know that these boys have never even dreamed of an all terrain vehicle like Ng's motorized wheelchair.It veers off the paved road with no loss in speedride gets a little bumpyand hits the chain link fence as if it were a fog bank, plowing a hundred foot section into the ground.It is a clear night, and so the Sacrifice Zone glitters, an immense carpet of broken glass and shredded asbestos.A hundred feet away, some seagulls are tearing at the belly of a dead German shepherd lying on its back.There is a constant undulation of the ground that makes the shattered glass flash and twinkle; this is caused by vast, sparse migrations of rats.The deep, computer designed imprints of suburban boys' fat knobby tires paint giant runes on the clay, like the mystery figures in Peru that Y. T.'s mom learned about at the NeoAquarian Temple.Through the windows, Y. T.  can hear occasional bursts of either firecrackers or gunfire.She can also hear Ng making new, even stranger sounds with his mouth.There is a built in speaker system in this vana stereo, though far be it from Ng to actually listen to any tunes.Y. T.  can feel it turning on, can sense a nearly inaudible hiss coming from the speakers.The van begins to creep forward across the Zone.The inaudible hiss gathers itself up into a low electronic hum.It's not steady, it wavers up and down, staying pretty low, like Roadkill fooling around with his electric bass.Ng keeps changing the direction of the van, as though he's searching for something, and Y. T.  gets the sense that the pitch of the hum is rising.It's definitely rising, building up in the direction of a squeal.Ng snarls a command and the volume is reduced.He's driving very slowly now.It is possible that you might not have to buy any Snow Crash at all, he mumbles.We may have found an unprotected stash.What is this totally irritating noise?Bioelectronic sensor.Human cell membranes.Grown in vitro, which means in glassin a test tube.One side is exposed to outside air, the other side is clean.When a foreign substance penetrates the cell membrane to the clean side, it's detected.The more foreign molecules penetrate, the higher the pitch of the sound.Like a Geiger counter?Very much like a Geiger counter for cell penetrating compounds, Ng says.Like what?Y. T.  wants to ask.But she doesn't.Ng stops the van.He turns on some lightsvery dim lights.That's how anal this guy ishe has gone to the trouble to install special dim lights in addition to all the bright ones.They are looking into a sort of bowl, right at the foot of a major drum heap, that is strewn with litter.Most of the litter is empty beer cans.In the middle is a fire pit.Many tire tracks converge here.Ah, this is good, Ng says.A place where the young men gather to take drugs.Y. T.  rolls her eyes at this display of tubularity.This must be the guy who writes all those antidrug pamphlets they get at school.Like he's not getting a million gallons of drugs every second through all of those gross tubes.I don't see any signs of booby traps, Ng says.Why don't you go out and see what kind of drug paraphernalia is out there.She looks at him like, what did you say?There's a toxics mask hanging on the back of your seat, he says.What's out there, toxic wise?Discarded asbestos from the shipbuilding industry.Marine antifouling paints that are full of heavy metals.They used PCBs for a lot of things, too.Great.I sense your reluctance.But if we can get a sample of Snow Crash from this drug taking site, it will obviate the rest of our mission.Well, since you put it that way, Y. T.  says, and grabs the mask.It's a big rubber and canvas number that covers her whole head and neck.Feels heavy and awkward at first, but whoever designed it had the right idea, all the weight rests in the right places.There's also a pair of heavy gloves that she hauls on.They are way too big.Like the people at the glove factory never dreamed that an actual female could wear gloves.She trudges out onto the glass and asbestos soil of the Zone, hoping that Ng isn't going to slam the door shut and drive away and leave her there.Actually, she wishes he would.It would be a cool adventure.Anyway, she goes up to the middle of the drug taking site.Is not too surprised to see a little nest of discarded hypodermic needles.And some tiny little empty vials.She picks up a couple of the vials, reads their labels.What did you find?Ng says when she gets back into the van, peels off the mask.Needles.Mostly Hyponarxes.But there's also a couple of Ultra Laminars and some Mosquito twenty fives.What does all this mean?
