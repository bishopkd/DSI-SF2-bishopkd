They burn calories as quickly as they consume them and yet still the club bakes with the memory of the afternoon sun.Emiko stands beside a fan, letting it cool her as much as she can, pausing in her labors of ferrying drinks for customers and hoping that Kannika will not catch sight of her again.Whenever Kannika gets hold of her, she drags her out to where the men can all examine her.Makes her walk in the traditional Japanese windup way, emphasizing the stylized motions of her kind.Makes her turn this way and that, and the men joke about her aloud even as they silently consider buying her once their friends have gone away.In the center of the main room, men invite young girls in their pha sin and cropped jackets out onto the dance floor and make slow turns around the parquet as the band plays Contraction mixes, songs that Raleigh has dredged from his memory and translated for use on traditional Thai instruments, strange melancholy amalgamations of the past, as exotic as his children with their turmeric hair and their wide round eyes."Emiko!"She flinches.It's Raleigh, motioning her toward his office.Men's gazes follow her stutter stop movements as she passes the bar.Kannika looks up from her date where they twine hands and nuzzle close.She smiles slightly as Emiko goes by.When Emiko first came to the country, she was told that the Thais have thirteen kinds of smile.She suspects that Kannika's denotes no good will."Come on. "Raleigh says, impatient.He leads her through a curtain and down the hall past where the girls change into their work clothes, then through another door.The memorabilia of three lifetimes lines his office's walls, everything from yellowed photographs of a Bangkok lit entirely by electricity to an image of Raleigh wearing the traditional dress of some savage hilltribe in the North.Raleigh invites Emiko to recline on a cushion on the raised platform where he does his private business.Another man is already sprawled there, a pale tall creature with blue eyes and blond hair and an angry scar on his neck.The man startles when she comes into the room."Jesus and Noah, you didn't tell me she was a windup," he says.Raleigh grins and settles on his own cushion."Didn't know you were a Grahamite. "The man almost smiles at the taunt."Keeping something this risky You're playing with blister rust, Raleigh.The white shirts could be all over you. ""The Ministry doesn't give a damn as long I pay the bribes.The guys who patrol around here aren't the Tiger of Bangkok.They just want to make a buck and sleep through the night. "He laughs."Buying her ice is more expensive than paying the Environment Ministry to look the other way. ""Ice?""Wrong pore structure.She overheats. "He scowls."If I'd known beforehand, I wouldn't have bought her. "The room reeks of opium and Raleigh busies himself filling the pipe again.He claims that opium has kept him young, vital through the years, but Emiko suspects that he sails for Tokyo and the same aging treatments Gendo sama used.Raleigh holds the opium over its lamp.It heats and sizzles, and he turns the ball on its needles, working the tar until it turns viscous, then he quickly rolls it back into a ball and presses it into his pipe.He extends the pipe to the lamp and breathes deeply as the tar turns to smoke.He closes his eyes.Blindly offers it to the pale man."No, thank you. "Raleigh's eyes open.He laughs."You should try it.It's the one thing the plagues didn't get.Lucky for me.Can't imagine going through withdrawal at my age. "The man doesn't answer.Instead, his pale blue eyes study Emiko.She has the uncomfortable feeling of being taken apart, cell by cell.Not so much that he undresses her with his gaze this she experiences every day: the feel of men's eyes darting across her skin, clasping at her body, hungering and despising her instead his study is clinically detached.If there is hunger there, he hides it well."She's the one?"he asks.Raleigh nods."Emiko, tell the gentleman about our friend from the other night. "Emiko glances at Raleigh, discomfited.She is fairly certain that she has never seen this pale blond gaijin at the club before, at least, that he has never attended any special performance.She has never served him a whiskey ice.She wracks her memories.No, she would remember.He has a sunburn, obvious despite the dim flicker of the candles and opium lamp.And his eyes are too strangely pale, unpleasantly so.She would remember him."Go on. "Raleigh urges."Tell him what you told me.About the white shirt.The kid you went with. "Raleigh is normally fanatic about the privacy of guests.He has even talked about building a separate stairwell for patrons, simply so they will not be seen entering and leaving Ploenchit tower at all, an access passage that would allow them to enter from a block away, under the street.And yet now he wants her to reveal so much."The boy?"she asks, stalling for time, unnerved by Raleigh's eagerness to expose a guest, and a white shirt, at that.She glances at the stranger again, wondering who he is, and what sort of hold he has on her papa san."Go on," Raleigh motions impatiently, the opium pipe gripped in his teeth.He leans into the opium lamp to smoke again."He was a white shirt," Emiko begins."He came with a group of other officers"  A new one.Brought around by his friends.All of them laughing and egging him on.All of them drinking free because Raleigh knows better than to charge, their good will worth more than the liquor.The young man, drunk.Laughing and making jokes about her in the bar.And then stealthily returning later, in privacy, hidden from his colleagues' prying eyes.The pale man makes a face."They'll go with you?With your kind?""Hai. "Emiko nods, showing nothing of what she thinks of his contempt."White shirts and Grahamites. "Raleigh laughs softly."Sex and hypocrisy.They go together like coffee and cream. "The stranger glances sharply at Raleigh, and Emiko wonders if the old man can see the disgust in those pale blue eyes or if he is too stoned on opium to care.The pale man leans forward, cutting Raleigh out of the conversation."And what did this white shirt tell you?"Is there a flicker of fascination there?Does she intrigue him?Or is it simply her story that interests him?Despite herself, Emiko feels a stirring of her genetic urge to please, an emotion that she hasn't felt since her abandonment.Something about the man reminds her of Gendo sama.Even though his blue gaijin eyes are like pools of chemical bath acid and his face is kabuki pale, he has presence.The air of authority is palpable, and strangely comforting.Are you a Grahamite?she wonders.Would you use me and then mulch me?She wonders if she cares.He is not beautiful.He is not Japanese.He is nothing.And yet his horrifying eyes hold her with the same power that Gendo sama used to exercise."What do you wish to know?"she whispers."Your white shirt said something about generipping," the gaijin says."Do you remember?""Hai.Yes.I think perhaps he was very proud.He came with a bag of newly designed fruits.Gifts for all of the girls. "More interest from the gaijin.It warms her."And what did the fruit look like?"he asks."It was red, I think.With threads.Long threads. ""Green hairs?About so long?"He indicates a centimeter with his fingers."Thickish?"She nods."Yes.That's right.He called them ngaw.And his aunt had made them.She was going to be recognized by the Child Queen's Protector, the Somdet Chaopraya, for her contribution to the Kingdom.He was very proud of his aunt. ""And he went with you," the man prompts."Yes.But later.After his friends were gone. "The pale man shakes his head impatiently.He doesn't care about the details of the liaison: the boy's nervous eyes, the way he approached the mama san and how Emiko was sent up to wait for him to follow a safe time later, so that no one would make the connection."What else did he say about this aunt?"he asks."Just that she rips for the Ministry. ""Nothing else?Not where she rips?Where they have test fields?Nothing of that sort?""No. ""That's it?"The gaijin glances at Raleigh, irritated."This is what you dragged me here for?"Raleigh rouses himself."The farang," he prompts."Tell him about the farang. "Emiko can't help but show her confusion."Sorry?"She remembers the white shirt boy, bragging about his aunt.How his aunt would be given a prize and a promotion for her work with ngaw nothing of farang."I don't understand. "Raleigh puts down his pipe, scowling."You told me he talked about farang generippers. ""No. "She shakes her head."He said nothing about foreigners.I am sorry. "The scarred gaijin makes a face of irritation."Let me know when you've got something worth my time, Raleigh. "He reaches for his hat, makes to stand.Raleigh glares at her."You said there was a farang generipper!""No" Emiko shakes her head."Wait!"She puts out a hand to the gaijin."Wait.Khun, please wait.I know what Raleigh san is talking about. "Her fingers brush his arm.The gaijin jerks away from her touch.He steps out of reach with a look of disgust."Please," she begs."I did not understand.The boy said nothing about farang.But he used a name it could have been farang," She looks to Raleigh for confirmation."Is this what you mean?The strange name?It could have been foreign, yes?Not Thai.Not Chinese or Hokkien"  Raleigh interrupts, "Tell him what you told me, Emiko.That's all I want.Tell him everything.Every single detail.Just like you're talking to me after a date. "And so she does.As the gaijin sits again, listening suspiciously, she tells everything.About the boy's nervousness, how he couldn't look at her, and then how he couldn't look away.How he talked because his erection would not come.How he watched her undress.How he talked about his aunt.Trying to make himself seem important to a whore and a New People whore at that, and how strange and silly that had seemed to her, and how she hid her thoughts of him.And then finally the part that makes Raleigh smile in satisfaction and the pale scarred man's eyes widen."The boy said the man Gi Bu Sen gives them blueprints, but he betrays them more often than not.But his aunt discovered a trickery.And then they made the successful rip of the ngaw.Gi Bu Sen did hardly anything for them with the ngaw.It was all his aunt's work, in the end. "She nods."That is what he said.This Gi Bu Sentricks them.But his aunt is too brilliant to be tricked. "The scarred man studies her closely.Cold blue eyes.Pale skin like a corpse."Gi Bu Sen," the man murmurs."You're sure that was the name?""Gi Bu Sen.I am sure. "The man nods, thoughtful.The lamp that Raleigh uses for his opium crackles in the silence.Far below on the street, a late night water seller calls out, his voice floating up through the open shutters and mosquito screens.The noise seems to break the gaijin from his reverie.His pale eyes focus on her again."I would be very interested to know if your friend returned for another visit. ""He was ashamed, afterward. "Emiko touches her cheek, where she hides a fading bruise with makeup."I think he will not "  Raleigh interrupts."Sometimes they come back.Even if they feel guilty. "He shoots her a dark look.She makes herself nod in confirmation.The boy will not be coming back, but it will make the gaijin happy to think so.And it will make Raleigh happy.Raleigh is her patron.She should agree.Should agree with conviction."Sometimes. "It's all she can manage."Sometimes they come back, even if they are ashamed. "The gaijin eyes them both."Why don't you go get her some ice, Raleigh?""It's not time for her next round.And she's got a show coming up. ""I'll cover the loss. "Raleigh clearly wants to stay, but he's smart enough not to protest.He forces a smile."Of course.Why don't you two talk?"He looks at her significantly as he leaves.Emiko knows Raleigh wants her to seduce this gaijin.To entice him with herky jerky sex and the promise of transgression.And then to listen to him and report, as all the girls are asked to.She leans closer, letting the gaijin see her exposed skin.His eyes trace across her flesh, following the line of her thigh where it slips beneath her pha sin, the way her hip presses against fabric.He looks away.Emiko hides her irritation.Is he attracted?Nervous?Disgusted?She cannot tell.With most men, it is easy.Obvious.They fit such simple patterns.She wonders if he finds a New Person too disgusting, or if perhaps he prefers boys."How do you survive here?"the gaijin asks."The white shirts should have mulched you by now. ""The payments.As long as Raleigh san is willing to pay, they will ignore. ""And you live somewhere, too?Raleigh pays for that as well?"When she nods, he says, "Expensive, I suppose?"She shrugs."Raleigh san keeps a tally of my debts. "As if summoned, Raleigh returns with her ice.The gaijin pauses as Raleigh comes through the door, waits impatiently as Raleigh sets down the glass on the low table.Raleigh hesitates, and when the scarred man ignores him, he mumbles something about enjoying themselves and leaves again.She watches the old man's departure thoughtfully, wondering at the hold this man has over Raleigh.Before her, the glass of icy water sweats, seductive.At the man's nod she reaches for it and drinks.Convulsive.Before she knows it, it is gone.She presses the cold glass against her cheek.The scarred man watches."So you're not engineered for the tropics," he says.He leans forward, studying her, his eyes moving across her skin."It's interesting that your designers modified your pore structure. "She fights the urge to recoil from his interest.She steels herself.Leans closer."It is to make my skin more attractive.Smooth. "She draws her pha sin above her knees, lets it slide up her thighs."Would you like to touch?"He glances at her, questioning."Please. "She nods permission.He reaches out and his hand slips along her flesh."Lovely," he murmurs.She feels a flush of satisfaction as his voice catches.His eyes have gone wide, like a child unmoored.He clears his throat."Your skin is burning," he says."Hai.As you say, I was not designed for this climate.  "Now he's examining every bit of her.Eyes roaming across her, starving, as if he will feed upon her with his gaze.Raleigh will be pleased."It makes sense," he says."Your model must only sell to elites they'd have climate control. "He nods to himself, studying her."It would be worth the trade off, to them. "He looks up at her."Mishimoto?Were you one of Mishimoto's then?You can't be diplomatic.The government would never bring a windup into the country, not with the palace's religious stance " His eyes lock with hers."You were dumped by Mishimoto, weren't you?"Emiko fights the sudden flood of shame.It's as though he has sliced her open and gone rooting through her entrails, impersonal and insulting, like some cibiscosis medical technician making an autopsy.She sets her drink down carefully."Are you a generipper?"she asks."Is this how you know so much about me?"His expression shifts in an instant, from wide eyed fascination to smirking slyness."More like a hobbyist," he says."A genespotter, if you will. ""Really?"She lets him see some of the contempt she feels for him."Not, maybe, a man from the Midwest Compact, perhaps?Not a company man?"She leans forward."Not a calorie man, possibly?"She whispers the last words, but they have their effect.The man jerks back.His smile remains, frozen, but his eyes now evaluate her the way a mongoose evaluates a cobra."What an interesting thought," he says.She welcomes the guarded gaze after her own feelings of shame.If she's lucky, perhaps this gaijin will slaughter her and be done with it.At least then she can rest.She waits, expecting him to strike her.No one tolerates impudence from New People.Mizumi sensei made sure that Emiko never showed a trace of rebellion.She taught Emiko to obey, to kowtow, to bend before the desires of her superiors, and to be proud of her place.Even though Emiko is ashamed by the gaijin's prying into her history and by her own loss of control, Mizumi sensei would say this is no excuse to prod and bait the man.It hardly matters.It is done, and Emiko feels dead enough in her soul that she will happily pay whatever price he chooses to extract.Instead, the man says, "Tell me again about the night with the boy. "The anger has left his eyes, replaced by an expression as implacable as Gendo sama's once was."Tell me everything," he says."Now. "His voice whips her with command.She wills herself to resist, but the in built urge of a New Person to obey is too strong, the feeling of shame at her rebellion too overwhelming.He is not your patron, she reminds herself, but even so at the command in his voice she's nearly pissing herself with her need to please him."He came last week" She returns again to the details of her night with the white shirt.She spins out the story, telling it for this gaijin's pleasure much as she once played samisen for Gendo sama, a dog desperate to serve.She wishes she could tell him to eat blister rust and die, but that is not her nature and so instead she speaks and the gaijin listens.He makes her repeat things, asks more questions.Returns to threads she thought he had forgotten.He is relentless, pecking at her story, forcing explanations.He is very good with his questions.Gendo sama used to question underlings this way, when he wanted to know why a clipper ship was not completed on schedule.He bored through the excuses like a genehack weevil.Finally the gaijin nods, satisfied."Good," he says."Very good. "Emiko feels a wash of pleasure at his compliment, and despises herself for it.The gaijin finishes his whiskey.Reaches into his pocket and pulls out a wad of cash, peels off several bills as he stands."These are for you, only.Don't show them to Raleigh.I'll settle with him before I leave. "She supposes she should feel grateful, but she instead feels used.As used by this man with his questions and his words as those others, the hypocritical Grahamites and the Environment Ministry's white shirts, who wish to transgress with her biological oddity, who all slaver for the pleasure of intercourse with an unclean creature.She holds the bills between her fingers.Her training tells her to be polite, but his self satisfied largesse irritates her."What does the gentleman think I will do with his extra baht?"she asks."Buy a pretty piece of jewelry?Take myself out to dinner?I am property, yes?I am Raleigh's. "She tosses the money at his feet."It makes no difference if I am rich or poor.I am owned. "The man pauses, one hand on the sliding door."Why not run away, then?""To where?My import permits have expired. "She smiles bitterly."Without Raleigh san's patronage and connections, the white shirts would mulch me. ""You wouldn't run for the North?"the man asks."For the windups there?""What windups?"The man smiles slightly."Raleigh hasn't mentioned them to you?Windup enclaves in the high mountains?Escapees from the coal war?Released ones?"At her blank expression he goes on."There are whole villages up there, living off the jungles.It's poor country, genehacked half to death, out beyond Chiang Rai and across the Mekong, but the windups there don't have any patrons and they don't have any owners.The coal war's still running, but if you hate your niche so much, it's an alternative to Raleigh. ""Is it true?"She leans forward."This village, is it real?"The man smiles slightly."You can ask Raleigh, if you don't believe me.He's seen them with his own eyes. "He pauses."But then, I suppose he wouldn't see much benefit in telling you.Might encourage you to slip your leash. ""You're telling the truth?"The pale strange man tips his hat."At least as much truth as you've told me. "He slides the door aside and slips out, leaving Emiko alone with a pounding heart and a sudden urge to live.4  "500, 1000, 5000, 7500 "  Protecting the Kingdom from all the infections of the natural world is like trying to catch the ocean with a net.One can snare a certain number of fish, sure, but the ocean is always there, surging through."10,000, 12,500, 15,000 25,000 "  Captain Jaidee Rojjanasukchai is more than aware of this as he stands under the vast belly of a farang dirigible in the middle of the sweltering night.The dirigible's turbofans gust and whir overhead.Its payload lies scattered, crates and boxes splintered open, their contents spilled across the anchor pad as though a child has recklessly strewn his toys.Sundry valuables and interdicted items lie everywhere."30,000, 35,000 50,000 "  Around him, Bangkok's newly renovated airfield spreads in all directions, lit by high intensity methane lamps mounted on mirror towers: a vast green bathed expanse of anchor pads dotted with the massive balloons of the farang floating high overhead, and, at its edges, the thickly grown walls of HiGro Bamboo and spun barbed wire that are supposed to define the international boundaries of the field."60,000, 70,000, 80,000 "  The Thai Kingdom is being swallowed.Jaidee idly surveys the wreckage his men have wrought, and it seems obvious.They are being swallowed by the ocean.Nearly every crate holds something of suspicion.But really, the crates are symbolic.The problem is ubiquitous: gray market chemical baths are sold in Chatachuk Market and men pole their skiffs up the Chao Phraya in the dead of night with hulls full of next gen pineapples.Pollen wafts down the peninsula in steady surges, bearing AgriGen and PurCal's latest genetic rewrites, while cheshires molt through the garbage of the sois and jingjok2 lizards vandalize the eggs of nightjars and peafowl.Ivory beetles bore through the forests of Khao Yai even as cibiscosis sugars, blister rust, and fa' gan fringe bore through the vegetables and huddled humanity of Krung Thep.It is the ocean they all swim in.The very medium of life."90 100,000 110 125 "  Great minds like Premwadee Srisati and Apichat Kunikorn may argue over best practices for protection or debate the merits of UV sterilization barriers along the Kingdom's borders versus the wisdom of pre emptive genehack mutation, but in Jaidee's view they are idealists.The ocean always flows through."126 127 128 129 "  Jaidee leans over Lieutenant Kanya Chirathivat's shoulder and watches as she counts bribe money.A pair of Customs inspectors stand stiffly aside, waiting for their authority to be returned to them."130 140 150 " Kanya's voice is a steady chant.A paean to wealth, to greasing the skids, to new business in an ancient country.Her voice is clear and meticulous.With her, the count will always be correct.Jaidee smiles.Nothing wrong with a little gift of good will.At the next anchor pad, 200 meters away, megodonts scream as they drag cargo out of a dirigible's belly and pile the shipment for sorting and Customs approval.Turbofans gust and surge, stabilizing the vast airship anchored overhead.The balloon lists and spins.Gritty winds and megodont dung scour across Jaidee's arrayed white shirts.Kanya places a hand over the baht she is counting.The rest of Jaidee's men wait, impassive, their hands on machetes as the winds whip against them.The turbofan gusts subside.Kanya continues her chant."160 170 180 "  The Customs men are sweating.Even in the hot season, there's no reason to sweat so.Jaidee isn't sweating.But then, he's not the one who has been forced to pay twice for protection that was probably expensive the first time.Jaidee almost pities them.The poor men don't know what lines of authority may have changed: if payments have been rerouted; if Jaidee represents a new power, or a rival one; don't know where he ranks in the layers of bureaucracy and influence that run through the Environment Ministry.And so they pay.He's surprised that they managed to find the cash at all, on such short notice.Almost as surprised as they must have been when his white shirts smashed the doors of the Customs Office and secured the field."Two hundred thousand. "Kanya looks up at him."It's all here. "Jaidee grins."I told you they'd pay. "Kanya doesn't return the smile, but Jaidee doesn't let it damp his glee.It's a good hot night and they've made a lot of money and as a bonus they've watched the Customs Service sweat.Kanya always has difficulty accepting good fortune when it comes her way.Somewhere during her young life she lost track of how to take pleasure.Starvation in the Northeast.The loss of her parents and siblings.Hard travels to Krung Thep.Somewhere she lost her capacity for joy.She has no appreciation for sanuk, for fun, even such intense fun, such sanuk mak as successfully shaking down the Trade Ministry or the celebration of Songkran.And so when Kanya takes 200,000 baht from the Trade Ministry and doesn't bat an eye except to wipe away the scouring dust of the anchor pads, and certainly doesn't smile, Jaidee doesn't let it hurt his feelings.Kanya has no taste for fun, that is her kamma.Still, Jaidee pities her.Even the poorest people smile sometimes.Kanya, almost never.It's quite unnatural.She doesn't smile when she is embarrassed, when she is irritated, when she is angry or when she has joy.It makes others uncomfortable, her complete lack of social grace, and it is why she landed at last in Jaidee's unit.No one else can stand her.The two of them make a strange pair.Jaidee who always finds something to smile at, and Kanya, whose face is so cold it might as well be carved from jade.Jaidee grins again, sending goodwill to his lieutenant."Let's pack it up, then. ""You've overstepped your authority," one of the Customs men mutters.Jaidee shrugs complacently."The Environment Ministry's jurisdiction extends to every place where the Thai Kingdom is threatened.It is the will of Her Royal Majesty the Queen. "The man's eyes are cold, even though he forces himself to smile pleasantly."You know what I mean. "Jaidee grins, shrugging off the other's ill will."Don't look so forlorn.I could have taken twice this much, and you still would have paid. "Kanya begins packaging up the money as Jaidee sifts through the wreckage of a crate with the tip of his machete."Look at all this important cargo that must be protected!"He flips over a bundle of kimonos.Probably shipped to a Japanese manager's wife.He stirs through lingerie worth more than his month's salary."We wouldn't want some grubby official rifling through all of this, would we?"He grins and glances at Kanya."Do you want any of this?It's made of real silk.The Japanese still have silk worms, you know. "Kanya doesn't look up from her work with the money."It's not my size.Those Japanese manager wives are all fat on genehack calories from their deals with AgriGen. ""You would steal, too?"The Customs official's face is a mask of controlled rage behind a polite, gritted smile."Apparently not. "Jaidee shrugs."My lieutenant seems to have better taste than the Japanese.Anyway, your profits will return, I'm sure.This will be but a minor inconvenience. ""And what about the damage?How will that be explained?"The other Customs man waves at a folding screen in the Sony style that lies half torn.Jaidee studies the artifact.It shows what he supposes must be the equivalent of a samurai family for the late twenty second century: A Mishimoto Fluid Dynamics manager overseeing some kind of windup workers in a field and Are those ten hands on each worker that he sees?Jaidee shudders at the bizarre blasphemy.The small natural family pictured at the edge of the field doesn't seem perturbed, but then, they are Japanese: they even let their children be entertained by a windup monkey.Jaidee makes a face."I'm sure you'll find some excuse.Perhaps the freight megodonts stampeded. "He claps the Customs men on their backs."Don't look so glum!Use your imagination!You should think of this as building merit. "Kanya finishes packing up the money.She secures the woven satchel and slings it over her shoulder."We're done," she says.Down field, a new dirigible is slowly descending, its massive kink spring fans using up the last of their joules to maneuver the beast over its anchors.Cables snake down from its belly, dragged by lead weights.Anchor pad workers wait with upraised hands to secure the floating monster to their megodont teams, as though praying to some massive god.Jaidee watches with interest."In any case, the Benevolent Association of Retired Royal Environment Ministry Officers appreciates this.You've built merit with them, regardless. "He hefts his machete and turns to his men."Khun officers!"He shouts over the drone of the dirigible fans and the scream of freight megodonts."I have a challenge for you!"He points to the descending dirigible with his machete."I have two hundred thousand baht for the first man who searches a crate from that new vessel over there!Come on!That one!Now!"The Customs men stare, dumbstruck.They start to speak, but their voices are drowned out by the roar of dirigible fans.They mouth protestations: "Mai tum!Mai tum!Mai tawng tum!No no nonono!"as they wave their arms and object, but Jaidee is already dashing across the airfield, brandishing his machete and howling after this new prey.Behind him, his white shirts follow in a wave.They dodge crates and laborers, leap over anchor cables, duck under megodont bellies.His men.His loyal children.His sons.The foolish followers of ideals and the Queen, joining his call, the ones who cannot be bribed, the ones who hold all of the honor of the Environment Ministry in their hearts."That one!That one!"They speed like pale tigers across the landing field, leaving the carcasses of Japanese freight containers littered behind them like so much debris after a typhoon.The Customs men's voices fade.Jaidee is already far distant from them, feeling the joy of his legs pumping under him, the pleasure of clean and honorable pursuit, running faster ever faster, his men following, covering the distance with the adrenaline sprint of pure warrior purpose, raising their machetes and axes to the giant machine as it comes down from the sky, looming over them like the demon king Tosacan ten thousand feet tall, settling over them.The megodont of all megodonts, and on its side, in farang lettering, the words: CARLYLE & SONS.Jaidee is unaware that a shriek of joy has escaped his lips.Carlyle & Sons.The irritating farang who speaks so casually about changing pollution credit systems, of removing quarantine inspections, of streamlining everything that has kept the Kingdom alive as other countries have collapsed, the foreigner who curries so much favor with Trade Minister Akkarat and the Somdet Chaopraya, the Crown Protector.This is a true prize.Jaidee is all pursuit.He stretches for the landing cables as his men surge past, younger and faster and fanatically dedicated, all of them reaching out to secure their quarry.But this dirigible is smarter than the last.At the sight of the white shirts swarming under its landing position, the pilot reorients his turbofans.The wash gushes over Jaidee.The fans scream and rev as the pilot wastes gigajoules in an attempt to push away from the ground.The dirigible's landing cables whip inward, winding on spindle cranks like an octopus yanking in its limbs.The turbofans shove Jaidee to the ground as they spin to full power.The dirigible rises.Jaidee pushes himself up, squinting into the hot winds as the dirigible shrinks into night blackness.He wonders if the disappearing monster was warned by the control towers or the Customs Service or if the pilot was simply clever enough to realize that a white shirt inspection was of no benefit to his masters.Jaidee grimaces.Richard Carlyle.Too clever by half, that one.Always in meetings with Akkarat, always at public benefits for cibiscosis victims, tossing money about, always talking about the positives of free trade.He is just one of dozens of farang who have returned to the shores like jellyfish after a bitter water epidemic, but Carlyle is the loudest.The one whose smiling face annoys Jaidee most.Jaidee pushes himself fully upright and brushes off the white hemp weave of his uniform.It doesn't matter; the dirigible will return.Like the ocean rushing onto the beach, it is impossible to keep the farang away.Land and sea must intersect.These men with profits in their beating hearts have no choice, they must rush in no matter the consequence, and he must always meet them.Kamma.Jaidee slowly returns to the cracked contents of the inspected shipping crates, wiping his face of sweat, breathing from the exertion of his run.He waves at his men to continue their labor."There!Break those open over there!I don't want a single crate uninspected. "The Customs men are waiting for him.He pokes through a new crate's wreckage with the point of his machete as the two men approach.They're like dogs.Impossible to be rid of unless you feed them.One of them tries to prevent Jaidee from swinging his machete into another crate."We paid!We will be filing protests.There will be investigations.This is international soil!"Jaidee makes a face."Why are you still here?""We paid you a fair price for protection!""More than fair. "Jaidee shoulders past the men."But I am not here to debate these things.It is your damma to protest.It is mine to protect our borders, and if that means I must invade your 'international soil' to save our country, so be it. "He swings his machete and another crate crackles open.WeatherAll wood bursts wide."You've overstepped yourself!""Probably.But you will have to send someone from the Ministry of Trade to tell me himself.Someone more much powerful than you. "He spins his machete thoughtfully."Unless you wish to debate me now, with my men?"The two flinch.Jaidee thinks he catches a flicker of a smile on Kanya's lips.He glances over, surprised, but already his lieutenant is again the face of blank professionalism.It is pleasant to see her smile.Jaidee briefly wonders if there is something more he can do to encourage a second flash of teeth from his dour subordinate.Sadly, the Customs men seem to be reconsidering their position; they are backing away from his machete."Do not think that you can insult us in this way, without consequence. ""Of course not. "Jaidee chops at the shipping crate again, shattering it fully."But I appreciate your monetary donation, even so. "He looks up at them."When you complain, make sure you tell them it was me, Jaidee Rojjanasukchai who did this work. "He grins again."And make sure you tell them that you actually tried to bribe the Tiger of Bangkok. "Around him, his men all laugh at the joke.The Customs men step back, surprised at this new revelation, the dawning comprehension of their opponent.Jaidee surveys the destruction around him.Splinters of the balsa crate material lie everywhere.The crates are engineered for strength and weightlessness and their lattice works well enough to hold goods as long as no one applies a machete.The work goes quickly.Materials are pulled from crates and laid out in careful rows.The Customs men hover, taking the names of his white shirts until his men finally raise their machetes and give chase.The officers retreat, then stop and observe from a safer distance.The scene reminds Jaidee of animals fighting over a carcass.His men feeding on the offal of foreign lands while the scavengers probe and test, the ravens and cheshires and dogs all waiting their own chance to converge on the carrion.The thought depresses him a little.The Customs men hang back, watching.Jaidee inspects the line of sorted contents.Kanya follows close behind.Jaidee asks, "What do we have, Lieutenant?""Agar solutions.Nutrient cultures.Some kind of breeding tanks.PurCal cinnamon.A papaya seedstock we don't recognize.A new iteration of U Tex that probably sterilizes any rice varietal it meets. "She shrugs."About what we expected. "Jaidee flips open a shipping container's lid and peers inside.Checks the address.A company in the farang manufacturing district.He tries sounding out the foreign letters, then gives up.He tries to remember if he's seen the logo before, but doesn't think so.He fingers through the materials inside, sacks of some sort of protein powder."Nothing of wonderful interest, then.No new version of blister rust leaping out of a box from AgriGen or PurCal. ""No. ""It's a pity we couldn't catch that last dirigible.They ran quite quickly.I would have liked to search the cargo of Khun Carlyle. "Kanya shrugs."They will return. ""They always do. ""Like dogs to a carcass," she says.Jaidee follows Kanya's gaze to the Customs men, watching from their safe distance.He is saddened that they see the world so similarly.Does he influence Kanya?Or does she influence him?He used to have much more fun at this work.But then, work used to be so much more clear cut.He's not accustomed to stalking the gray landscapes that Kanya walks.But at least he has more fun.His reverie is broken by the arrival of one of his men.Somchai, sauntering over, his machete swinging casually.He's a fast one, as old as Jaidee but hard edged from losses when blister rust swept the North for the third time in a single growing season.A good man, and loyal.And clever."There's a man watching us," Somchai mumbles as he draws close to the two of them."Where?"Somchai jerks his head subtly.Jaidee lets his eyes roam the bustle of the landing fields.Beside him, Kanya stiffens.Somchai nods."You see him, then?""Kha. "She nods affirmative.Jaidee finally catches sight of the man, standing a good distance away, watching both the white shirts and the Customs men.He has on a simple orange sarong and purple linen shirt, as if he might be a laborer, and yet he carries nothing.He does nothing.And he seems well fed.Not showing ribs and hollow cheeks the way most laborers do.He watches, casually leaning against an anchor hook."Trade?"Jaidee asks."Army?"Kanya guesses."He's a confident one. "As though he senses Jaidee's eyes, the man turns.His eyes lock with Jaidee for moment."Shit. "Somchai frowns."He's seen us. "He and Kanya join Jaidee in an open study of the man.The man is unperturbed.He spits a stream of red betel and turns and saunters away, disappearing into the bustle of freight movements.Somchai asks, "Should I go after him?Question him?"Jaidee cranes his neck, trying to catch another glimpse of the man where he has been swallowed by the bustle."What do you think, Kanya?"She hesitates."Haven't we prodded enough cobras for one night?"Jaidee smiles slightly."The voice of wisdom and restraint speaks. "Somchai nods agreement."Trade will be furious as it is. ""One hopes so. "Jaidee motions to Somchai to return to his inspections.As they watch him go, Kanya says, "We may have overstepped this time. ""You mean I may have overstepped. "Jaidee grins."You're losing your nerve?""Not my nerve. "Her gaze travels back to where their observer disappeared."There are bigger fish than us, Khun Jaidee.The anchor pads" Kanya trails off.Finally, after visibly working to choose her words, she says, "It's an aggressive move. ""You're sure you're not afraid?"he teases her."No!"She stops short, swallows her outburst, masters her composure.Privately, Jaidee admires her ability to speak with a cool heart.He was never so careful with his words, or his actions.He was always the sort to charge in like a megodont and try to right the trampled rice shoots after.Jai rawn, rather than jai yen.A hot heart, rather than a cool one.Kanya, though  Finally she says, "This may not have been the best place to strike. ""Don't be a pessimist.The anchor pads are the best of all possible places.Those two weevils over there coughed up 200,000 baht, no trouble at all.Too much money to be involved in anything honest. "Jaidee grins."I should have come here a long time ago and taught these heeya a lesson.Better than wandering the river with a kink spring skiff, arresting children for generip smuggling.At least this is honest work. ""But it will get Trade involved for certain.By law, it's their turf.  ""By any sane law, none of this should be imported at all. "Jaidee waves a hand, dismissive."Laws are confusing documents.They get in the way of justice. ""Justice is always lost where Trade is concerned. ""We're both more than aware of that.In any case, it's my head.You won't be touched a bit.You couldn't have stopped me, even if you had known where we were going tonight. ""I wouldn't " Kanya starts."Don't worry about it.It's time that Trade and its pet farang felt a sting here.They were complacent, and needed a reminder that they still must perform the occasional khrab to the idea of our laws. "Jaidee pauses, surveying the wreckage again."There's truly nothing else on the black lists?"Kanya shrugs."Just the rice.Everything else is innocuous enough, on paper.No breeding specimens.No genetics in suspension. ""But?""Much of it will be misused.Nutrient cultures can't have any good purpose. "Kanya is back to her blank and depressed expression."Should we pack it all back up?"Jaidee grimaces, finally shakes his head."No.Burn it. ""I'm sorry?""Burn it.We both know what is happening here.Give the farang something to claim against their insurance companies.Let them know that their activity is not free. "Jaidee grins."Burn it all.Every last crate. "And for the second time that night, as shipping crates crackle with fire and WeatherAll oils rush and ignite and kick sparks into the air like prayers going up to heaven, Jaidee has the satisfaction of seeing Kanya smile again.* * *   It is nearly morning by the time Jaidee returns home.The ji ji ji of jingjok lizards punctuates the creak of cicadas and the high whine of mosquitoes.He slips off his shoes and climbs the steps, teak creaking under his feet as he steals into his stilt house, feeling the smooth wood under his soles, soft and polished against his skin.He opens the screened door and slips inside, closing the door quickly behind him.They're close to the khlong, only meters away, and the water is brackish and thick.The mosquitoes swarm close.Inside, a single candle burns, illuminating Chaya where she lies on a floor couch, asleep, waiting.He smiles tenderly and slips into the bathroom to quickly disrobe and pour water over his shoulders.He tries to be quick and quiet about his bath, but water spatters flatly on the wood.He dips water again and spills it over his back.Even in the dead of night the air is warm enough that he doesn't mind the water's slight chill.In the hot season, everything is a relief.When he comes out of his bath with a sarong wrapped around his waist, Chaya is awake, looking up at him with thoughtful brown eyes."You're very late," she says."I was worried. "Jaidee grins."You should know better than to worry.I'm a tiger. "He nuzzles close to her.Kisses her gently.Chaya grimaces and pushes him away."Don't believe everything the newspapers say.A tiger. "She makes a face."You smell like smoke. ""I just bathed. ""It's in your hair. "He rocks back on his heels."It was a very good night. "She smiles in the darkness, her white teeth flashing, mahogany skin a dull sheen in the black."Did you strike a blow for our Queen?""I struck a blow against Trade. "She flinches."Ah. "He touches her arm."You used to be happy when I made important people angry. "She pushes away from him and stands, starts straightening the cushions.Her movements are abrupt, irritated."That was before.Now I worry about you. ""You shouldn't. "Jaidee moves out of her way as she finishes with the couch."I'm surprised you bother to wait up.If I were you, I would go to sleep and dream beautiful dreams.Everyone has given up on controlling me.I'm just a line item expense for them, now.I'm too popular with the people to do anything about.They put spies on me to watch me, but they do nothing to stop me anymore. ""A hero to the people, and a thorn for the Ministry of Trade.I would rather have Trade Minister Akkarat as a friend and the people as your enemy.We'd all be safer. ""You didn't think so when you married me.You liked that I was a fighter.That I had so many victories in Lumphini Stadium.You remember?"She doesn't answer.Instead begins rearranging the cushions again, refusing to turn around.Jaidee sighs and puts a hand on her shoulder, pulls her up to face him, so that he can see her eyes."Anyway, why is it that you bring this up, now?Am I not here?And perfectly fine?""When they shot you, you weren't so fine. ""That's in the past. ""Only because they put you behind a desk, and General Pracha paid reparations. "She holds up her hand, showing her own missing fingers."Don't tell me you're safe.I was there.I know what they can do. "Jaidee makes a face."We aren't safe in any case.If it's not Trade, it's blister rust or cibiscosis or something else, something worse.We aren't living in a perfect world anymore.This isn't the Expansion. "She opens her mouth to respond, then closes it and turns away.Jaidee waits, letting her master herself.When she turns back, her emotions are under control again."No.You're right.None of us are safe.I wish, though. ""You might as well run to Ta Prachan market and get an amulet, for all the good wishing does. ""I did.The one with Phra Seub.But you don't wear it. ""Because it's just superstition.Whatever happens to me is my kamma.A magic amulet isn't going to change that. ""Still, it doesn't hurt. "She pauses."I would feel better if you wore it. "Jaidee smiles and starts to make a joke of it, but something in her expression makes him change his mind."Fine.If it makes you happy.I'll wear your Phra Seub. "From the sleeping rooms, a noise echoes, a wet coughing.Jaidee stiffens.Chaya shifts and looks over her shoulder to the noise."It's Surat. ""Did you take him to Ratana?""It's not her job to examine sick children.She has real work to do.Real genehacks to worry over. ""Did you take him or not?"Chaya sighs."She said it's not an upgrade.Nothing to worry about. "Jaidee tries not to let his relief show."Good. "The coughing comes again.It reminds him of Num, dead and gone.He fights off sadness.Chaya touches his chin, pulls his attention back to her.Smiles up at him."So what is it that left you smelling of smoke, noble warrior, defender of Krung Thep?Why so pleased with yourself?"Jaidee smiles slightly."You can read it in the whisper sheets tomorrow. "She purses her lips."I'm worried about you.Really. ""That's because you have a good heart.But you shouldn't worry.They're done with heavy handed measures against me.It went badly the last time.The papers and whisper sheets liked the story too much.And our most revered Queen has registered her own support for what I do.They'll keep their distance.Her Majesty the Queen, at least, they still respect. ""You were lucky that she was allowed to hear of you at all. ""Even that heeya the Crown Protector can't blind her. "Chaya stiffens at his words."Jaidee, please.Not so loud.The Somdet Chaopraya has too many ears. "Jaidee makes a face."You see?This is what we've come to.A Crown Protector who spends his time meditating on how to take the inner apartments of the Grand Palace.A Trade Minister who conspires with farang to destroy our trade and quarantine laws.And meanwhile, we all try not to speak too loudly. ""I'm glad I went to the anchor pads tonight.You should have seen how much money those Customs officers were raking in, just standing aside and letting anything at all pass through.The next mutation of cibiscosis could have been sitting in vials right in front of them, and they would have held out a hand for a bribe.Sometimes, I think we're living the last days of old Ayutthaya all over again. ""Don't be melodramatic. ""History repeats itself.No one fought to protect Ayutthaya, either. ""And so what does that make you?Some villager of Bang Rajan, reincarnated?Holding back the farang tide?Fighting to the last man?That sort of thing?""At least they fought!Which would you rather be?The farmers who held off the Burmese army for a month, or the ministers of the Kingdom who ran away and let their capital be sacked?"He grimaces."If I were smart, I'd go to the anchor pads every night and teach Akkarat and the farang a real lesson.Show them that someone's still willing to fight for Krung Thep. "He expects Chaya to try to shut him up again, to cool his hot hearted talk, but instead, she is silent.Finally she asks, "Do you think our lives are always reborn here, in this place?Do we have to come back and face all of this again, no matter what?""I don't know," Jaidee says."That's the sort of question Kanya would ask. ""She's a dour one.I should get her an amulet, too.Something that would make her smile for once. ""She is a bit strange. ""I thought Ratana was going to propose to her. "Jaidee pauses, considering Kanya and pretty Ratana, with her breathing mask and her underground life in the Ministry's biological containment labs."I don't pry into her private life. ""She'd smile more if she had a man. ""If someone as good as Ratana couldn't make her happy, then no man has a hope. "Jaidee grins."Anyway, if she had a man, he'd spend all his time being jealous of the men she commands in my unit.All the handsome men" He leans forward and tries to kiss Chaya but she pulls away too quickly."Ugh.You smell like whiskey, too. ""Whiskey and smoke.I smell like a real man. ""Go off to bed.You'll wake up Niwat and Surat.And mother. "Jaidee pulls her close, puts his lips to her ear."She wouldn't mind another grandchild. "Chaya pushes him away, laughing."She will if you wake her up. "His hands slip along her hips."I'll be very quiet. "She slaps his hands away, but doesn't try very hard.He catches her hand.Feels the stumps of her missing fingers, caresses their ridges.Suddenly they're both solemn again.She takes a ragged breath."We've all lost too many things.I can't bear to lose you, too. ""You won't.I'm a tiger.And I'm no fool. "She holds him close."I hope so.I truly do. "Her warm body presses against him.He can feel her breathing, steady, full of concern for him.She draws back and looks at him solemnly, her eyes dark and full of care."I'll be fine," he says again.She nods but doesn't seem to be listening.Instead she seems to be studying him, following the lines of his brow, of his smiles, of his scars and pocks.The moment seems to stretch forever, her dark eyes on him, memorizing, solemn.At last she nods, as though listening to something she tells herself, and her worried expression lifts.She smiles and pulls him close, pressing her lips to his ear."You are a tiger," she whispers, as if she is a fortune teller pronouncing, and her body relaxes into him, pressing to him fully.He feels a rush of relief as they come together, finally.He clasps her to him more tightly."I've missed you," he whispers."Come with me. "She slips free and takes him by the hand.Leads him toward their bed.She pulls aside the mosquito netting and slips under its tenting gossamer.Clothing rustles, falling away.A shadow woman teases him from within."You still smell like smoke," she says.Jaidee pulls aside the nets."And whiskey.Don't forget the whiskey. "5  The sun peers over the rim of the earth, casting its blaze across Bangkok.It rushes molten over the wrecked tower bones of the old Expansion and the gold sheathed chedi of the city's temples, engulfing them in light and heat.It ignites the sharp high roofs of the Grand Palace where the Child Queen lives cloistered with her attendants, and flames from the filigreed ornamentation of the City Pillar Shrine where monks chant 24 7 on behalf of the city's seawalls and dikes.The blood warm ocean flickers with blue mirror waves as the sun moves on, burning.The sun hits Anderson Lake's sixth floor balcony and pours into his flat.Jasmine vines at the edge of the veranda rustle in the hot breeze.Anderson looks up, blue eyes slitted against the glare.Sweat jewels pop and gleam on his pale skin.Beyond the rail, the city appears as a molten sea, glinting gold where spiresand glass catch the full blaze of the sun.He's naked in the heat, seated on the floor, surrounded by open books: flora and fauna catalogs, travel notes, an entire history of the Southeast Asian peninsula scattered across teak.Moldy, crumbling tomes.Scraps of paper.Half torn diaries.The excavated memories of a time when tens of thousands of plants lofted pollen and spores and seeds into the air.He has spent all night at work, and yet he barely remembers the many varietals he has examined.Instead, his mind returns to flesh exposed a pha sin sliding up a girl's legs, the memory of peacocks on a shimmering purple weave riding high, smooth thighs damply parted.In the far distance, the towers of Ploenchit stand tall, backlit.Three shadow fingers spiking skyward in a yellow haze of humidity.In the daylight they just look like more Expansion era slums, without a hint of the pulsing addictions contained within.A windup girl.His fingers on her skin.Her dark eyes solemn as she said, "You may touch. "Anderson takes a shuddering breath, forcing away the memories.She is the opposite of the invasive plagues he fights every day.A hothouse flower, dropped into a world too harsh for her delicate heritage.It seems unlikely that she will survive for long.Not in this climate.Not with these people.Perhaps it was that vulnerability that moved him, her pretended strength when she had nothing at all.Seeing her fight for a semblance of pride even as she hiked up her skirt at Raleigh's order.Is that why you told her about the villages?Because you pitied her?Not because her skin felt as smooth as mango?Not because you could hardly breathe when you touched her?He grimaces and turns his attention again to his open books, forcing himself to attend to his true problem, the question that has brought him across the world on clipper ship and dirigible: Gi Bu Sen.The windup girl said Gi Bu Sen.Anderson shuffles through his books and papers, comes up with a photograph.A fat man, sitting with other Midwest scientists at an AgriGen sponsored conference on blister rust mutation.He is looking away from the camera, bored, the wattles of his neck showing.Are you still fat?Anderson wonders.Do the Thais feed you as well as we did?There were only three possibilities: Bowman, Gibbons and Chaudhuri.Bowman, who disappeared just before the SoyPRO monopoly broke.Chaudhuri, who walked off a dirigible and disappeared into the Indian Estates, either kidnapped by PurCal or run off, or dead.And Gibbons.Gi Bu Sen.The smartest of them all, and the one deemed least likely.Dead, after all.His seared body recovered from the ashes of his home by his children and then entirely cremated before the company could perform an autopsy.But dead.And when the children were questioned with lie detectors and drugs, all they could say was that their father had always insisted that he not be autopsied.That he couldn't abide anyone cutting into his corpse and pumping it with preservatives.But the DNA matched.It was him.Everyone was sure it was him.Except that it's easy to doubt when all you have are a few genetic clippings from the supposed corpse of the finest generipper in the world.Anderson shuffles through more papers, hunting up the transcripts of the calorie man's final days, culled from bugging devices they kept in the labs.Nothing.Not a hint of his plans.And then he was dead.And they were forced to believe that it was true.In that way, the ngaw almost makes sense.The nightshades as well.Gibbons always enjoyed flaunting his expertise.An egotist.Every colleague said so.Gibbons would delight in playing with the full range of a complete seedbank.An entire genus resurrected and then a bit of local lore to top it off.Ngaw.At least, Anderson assumes the fruit is local.But who knows?Perhaps it is an entirely new creation.Something sprung complete from Gibbons' mind, like Adam's rib spawning Eve.Anderson idly thumbs through the books and notes before him.None of them mention the ngaw.All he has is the Thai word and its singular appearance.He doesn't even know if "ngaw" is the traditional moniker for the red and green fruit, or something newly named.He had hoped that Raleigh would have his own recollections, but the man is old, and addled on opium if he knew an Angrit word for the historical fruit, it is lost to him now.In any case, there's no obvious translation.It will be at least a month before Des Moines can examine the samples.And there's no telling if it will be in their catalogues even then.If it's sufficiently altered, there may be no shortcut to a DNA match.One thing is certain: the ngaw is new.A year ago, none of the inventory agents described anything of the sort in their ecosystem surveys.Between one year and the next, the ngaw appeared.As if the soil of the Kingdom had simply decided to birth up the past and deposit it in the markets of Bangkok.Anderson thumbs through another book, hunting.Since his arrival, he has been creating a library, a historical window into the City of Divine Beings, tomes drawn from before the calorie wars and plagues, before the Contraction.He has pillaged through everything from antiquities shops to the rubble of Expansion towers.Most of the paper of that time has already burned or rotted in the humid tropics, but he has found pockets of learning even so, families that valued their books more than as a quick way to start a fire.The accumulated knowledge now lines his walls, volume after volume of mold fringed information.It depresses him.Reminds him of Yates, that desperate urge to excavate the corpse of the past and reanimate it."Think of it!"Yates had crowed."A new Expansion!Dirigibles, next gen kink springs, fair trade winds"  Yates had books of his own.Dusty tomes he'd stolen from libraries and business schools across North America, the neglected knowledge of the past a careful pillaging of Alexandria that had gone entirely unnoticed because everyone knew global trade was dead.When Anderson arrived, the books had filled the SpringLife offices and ranged around Yates' desk in stacks: Global Management in Practice, Intercultural Business, The Asian Mind, The Little Tigers of Asia, Supply Chains and Logistics, Pop Thai, The New Global Economy, Exchange Rate Considerations in Supply Chains, Thais Mean Business, International Competition and Regulation.Anything and everything related to the history of the old Expansion.Yates had pointed to them in his final moments of desperation and said, "But we can have it again!All of it!"And then he had wept, and Anderson finally felt pity for the man.Yates had invested his life in something that would never be.Anderson flips through another book, examining ancient photographs in turn.Chiles.Piles of them, laid out before some long dead photographer.Chiles.Eggplants.Tomatoes.All those wonderful nightshades again.If it hadn't been for the nightshades, Anderson wouldn't have been dispatched to the Kingdom by the home office, and Yates might have had a chance.Anderson reaches for his package of Singha hand rolled cigarettes, lights one, and sprawls back, contemplative, examining the smoke of ancients.It amuses him that the Thais, even amid starvation, have found the time and energy to resurrect nicotine addiction.He wonders if human nature ever really changes.The sun glares in at him, bathing him with light.Through the humidity and haze of burning dung, he can just make out the manufacturing district in the distance, with its regularly spaced structures so different from the jumble tile and rust wash of the old city.And beyond the factories, the rim of the seawall looms with its massive lock system that allows the shipment of goods out to sea.Change is coming.The return to truly global trade.Supply lines that circle the world.It's all coming back, even if they're slow at relearning.Yates had loved kink springs, but he'd loved the idea of resurrected history even more."You aren't AgriGen here, you know.You're just another grubby farang entrepreneur trying to make a buck along with the jade prospectors and the clipper hands.This isn't India, where you can walk around flashing AgriGen's wheat crest and requisitioning whatever you want.The Thais don't roll over like that.They'll cut you to pieces and send you back as meat if they find out what you are. ""You're out on the next dirigible flight," Anderson said."Be glad the main office even approved that. "But then Yates had pulled the spring gun.Anderson draws again on his cigarette, irritated.He becomes aware of the heat.Overhead, his room's crank fan has come to a halt.The winding man, who is supposed to arrive every day at four in the afternoon, apparently didn't load enough joules.Anderson grimaces and rises to pull the shades, blocking out the blaze.The building is a new one, built on thermal principals that allow cool ground air to circulate easily through the building, but it is still difficult to withstand the direct blaze of equatorial sun.Now in shadow, Anderson returns to his books.Turns pages.Flips through yellowed tomes and cracked spines.Crumbling paper ill treated by humidity and age.He opens another book.He pinches his cigarette between his lips, squinting through the smoke, and stops.Ngaw.Piles of them.The little red fruits with their strange green hairs sit before him, mocking him from within a photo of a farang bargaining for food with some long ago Thai farmer.All around them, brightly colored, petroleum burning taxis blur past, but just to their side, a huge pyramidal pile of ngaw stares out of the photo, taunting.Anderson has spent enough time poring over ancient pictures that they seldom affect him.He can usually ignore the foolish confidence of the past the waste, the arrogance, the absurd wealth but this one irritates him: the fat flesh hanging off the farang, the astonishing abundance of calories that are so obviously secondary to the color and attractiveness of a market that has thirty varieties of fruit: mangosteens, pineapples, coconuts, certainly but there are no oranges, now.None of these these dragon fruits, none of these pomelos, none of these yellow things lemons.None of them.So many of these things are simply gone.But the people in the photo don't know it.These dead men and women have no idea that they stand in front of the treasure of the ages, that they inhabit the Eden of the Grahamite Bible where pure souls go to live at the right hand of God.Where all the flavors of the world reside under the careful attentions of Noah and Saint Francis, and where no one starves.Anderson scans the caption.The fat, self contented fools have no idea of the genetic gold mine they stand beside.The book doesn't even bother to identify the ngaw.It's just another example of nature's fecundity,taken entirely for granted because they enjoyed so damn much of it.Anderson briefly wishes that he could drag the fat farang and ancient Thai farmer out of the photograph and into his present, so that he could express his rage at them directly, before tossing them off his balcony the way they undoubtedly tossed aside fruit that was even the slightest bit bruised.He flips through the book but finds no other images, nor mentions of the kinds of fruits available.He straightens, agitated, and goes to the balcony again.Steps out into the sun's blaze and stares out across the city.From below, the calls of water sellers and the cry of megodonts echoes up.The chime of bicycle bells streaming across the city.By noon, the city will be largely stilled, waiting for the sun to begin its descent.Somewhere in this city a generipper is busily toying with the building blocks of life.Reengineering long extinct DNA to fit post Contraction circumstances, to survive despite the assaults of blister rust, Nippon genehack weevil and cibiscosis.Gi Bu Sen.The windup girl was certain of the name.It has to be Gibbons.Anderson leans on the balcony's rail squinting into the heat, surveying the tangled city.Gibbons is out there, hiding.Crafting his next triumph.And wherever he hides, a seedbank will be close.6  The problem with keeping money in a bank is that in the blink of a tiger's eye it will turn on you: what's yours becomes theirs, what was your sweat and labor and sold off portions of a lifetime become a stranger's.This problem this banking problem gnaws at the forefront of Hock Seng's mind, a genehack weevil that he cannot dig out and cannot pinch into pus and exoskeleton fragments.Imagined in terms of the time time spent earning wages that a bank then holds a bank can own more than half of a man.Well, at least a third, even if you are a lazy Thai.And a man without one third of his life, in truth, has no life at all.Which third can a man lose?The third from his chest to the top of his balding skull?From his waist to his yellowing toenails?Two legs and an arm?Two arms and a head?A quarter of a man, cut away, might still hope to survive, but a third is too much to tolerate.This is the problem with a bank.As soon as you place your money in its mouth, it turns out that the tiger has gotten its teeth locked around your head.One third, or one half, or just a liver spotted skull, it might as well be all.But if a bank cannot be trusted, what can?A flimsy lock on a door?The ticking of a mattress, carefully unstuffed?The ravaged tiles of a rooftop lifted up and wrapped in banana leaves?A cutaway in the bamboo beams of a slum shack, cleverly sliced open and hollowed to hold the fat rolls of bills that he shoves into them?Hock Seng digs into bamboo.The man who rented him the room called it a flat, and in a way, it is.It has four walls, not just a tenting of coconut polymer tarps.It has a tiny courtyard behind, where the outhouse lies and which he shares along with the walls with six other huts.For a yellow card refugee, this is not a flat but a mansion.And yet all around he hears the groaning complaining mass of humanity.The WeatherAll wooden walls are frankly an extravagance even if they don't quite touch the ground, even if the jute sandals of his neighbors peek underneath, and even if they reek with the embedded oils that keep them from rotting in the humidity of the tropics.But they are necessary, if only to provide places to store his money other than in the bottom of his rain barrel wrapped in three layers of dog hide that he prays may still be waterproof after six months of immersion.Hock Seng pauses in his labors, listening.Rustling comes from the next room but nothing indicates that anyone eavesdrops on his mouselike burrowing.He returns to the process of loosening a disguised bamboo panel at its joint, carefully saving the sawdust for later.Nothing is certain that is the first lesson.The yang guizi foreign devils learned this in the Contraction when their loss of oil sent them scuttling back to their home shores.He himself finally learned it in Malacca.Nothing is certain, nothing is secure.A rich man becomes a poor man.A noisy Chinese clan, fat and happy during Spring Festival, fed well on pork strips, nasi goreng and Hainan style chicken becomes a single emaciated yellow card.Nothing is eternal.The Buddhists understand this much, at least.Hock Seng grins mirthlessly and continues his quiet burrowing, following a line across the top of the panel, digging out more packed sawdust.He now lives in the height of luxury, with his patched mosquito net and his little burner that can ignite green methane twice a day, if he's willing to paythe local pi lien elder brotherfor an illegal tap into the city lamppost delivery pipes.He has his own set of clay rain urns sitting in the tiny courtyard, an astounding luxury in itself, protected by the honor and uprightness of his neighbors, the desperately poor, who know that there must be limits to anything, that every squalor and debauch has limits, and so he has rain barrels full of green slime mosquito eggs that he can assure himself will never be stolen from, even if he may be murdered outside his door, or the neighbor wife may be raped by any nak leng who takes a fancy to her.Hock Seng pries at the tiny panel in the bamboo strut, holding his breath, trying to make no scraping sound.He chose this place for its exposed joists and the tiles overhead in the low dark ceiling.For the nooks and crannies and opportunities.All around him the slum inhabitants wake and groan and complain and light their cigarettes as he sweats with the tension of opening this hiding place.It's foolish to keep so much money here.What if the slum burns?What if the WeatherAll catches fire from some fool's candle overturned?What if the mobs come and attempt to trap him inside?Hock Seng pauses, wipes the sweat off his brow.I am crazy.No one is coming for me.The Green Headbands are across the border in Malaya and the Kingdom's armies will keep them well away.And even if they do come, I have an archipelago's worth of distance to prepare for their arrival.Days of travel on a kink spring train, even if the rails aren't blown by the Queen's Army generals.Twenty four hours at least, even if they use coal for their attack.And otherwise?Weeks of marching.Plenty of time.I am safe.The panel comes open completely in his shaking hand, revealing the bamboo's hollow interior.The tube is watertight, perfected by nature.He sends his skinny arm questing into the hole, feeling blind.For a moment, he thinks someone has taken it, robbed him while he was gone but then his fingers touch paper, and he fishes up rolls of cash one by one.In the next room, Sunan and Mali are discussing her uncle, who wants them to smuggle cibi.11. s.8 pineapples, sneaking them in on a skiff from the farang quarantine island of Koh Angrit.Quick money, if they're willing to take the risk of bringing in banned foodstock from the calorie monopolies.Hock Seng listens to them mutter as he stuffs his own cash into an envelope, then tucks it inside his shirt.Diamonds, baht, and jade pit his walls all around, but still, it hurts to take this money now.It goes against his hoarding instinct.He presses the bamboo panel closed again.Takes spit and mixes it with the meager sawdust that remains, and presses the compound into the visible cracks.He rocks back on his heels and examines the bamboo pole.It is nearly invisible.If he didn't know to count upwards four joints, he wouldn't know where to look, or what to look for.The problem with banks is that they cannot be trusted.The problem with secret caches is that they are hard to protect.The problem with a room in a slum is that anyone can take the money when he is gone.He needs other caches, safe places to hide the opium and jewels and cash he procures.He needs a safe place for everything.For himself as well, and for that, any amount of money is worth spending.All things are transient.Buddha says it is so, and Hock Seng, who didn't believe in or care about karma or the truths of the dharma when he was young, has come in his old age to understand his grandmother's religion and its painful truths.Suffering is his lot.Attachment is the source of his suffering.And yet he cannot stop himself from saving and preparing and striving to preserve himself in this life which has turned out so poorly.How is it that I sinned to earn this bitter fate?Saw my clan whittled by red machetes?Saw my businesses burned and my clipper ships sunk?He closes his eyes, forcing memories away.Regret is suffering.He takes a deep breath and climbs stiffly to his feet, surveys the room to ascertain that nothing is out of place, then turns and shoves his door open, wood scraping on dirt, and slips out in the squeezeway that is the slum's thoroughfare.He secures the door with a bit of leather twine.A knot, and nothing else.The room has been broken into before.It will be broken into again.He plans on it.A big lock would attract the wrong attention, a poor man's bit of leather entices no one.The way out of the Yaowarat slum is full of shadows and squatting bodies.The heat of the dry season presses down on him, so intense that it seems no one can breathe, even with the looming presence of the Chao Phraya dikes.There is no escape from the heat.If the seawall gave way, the entire slum would drown in nearly cool water, but until then, Hock Seng sweats and stumbles through the maze of squeezeways, rubbing up against scavenged tin walls.He jumps across open gutters of shit.Balances on planks and slips past women sweating over steaming pots of U Tex glass noodles and reeking sun dried fish.A few kitchen carts, ones who have bribed either the white shirts or the slum's pi lien, burn small dung fires in public, choking the alleys with thick smoke and frying chile oil.He squeezes around triple locked bicycles, stepping carefully.Clothes and cook pots and garbage spill out from under tarp walls, encroaching on the public space.The walls rustle with the movement of people within: a man coughing through the last stages of lung water; a woman complaining about her son's lao lao rice wine habit; a little girl threatening to hit her baby brother.Privacy is not something for a tarp slum, but the walls provide polite illusion.And certainly it is better than the Expansion tower internments of the yellow cards.A tarp slum is luxury for him.And with native Thais all around, he has cover.Better protection than he ever enjoyed in Malaya.Here, if he doesn't open his mouth and betray his foreigner's accent, he can be mistaken for a local.Still, he misses that place where he and his family were alien and yet had forged a life.He misses the marble floored halls and red lacquer pillars of his ancestral home, ringing with the calls of his children and grandchildren and servants.He misses Hainan chicken and laksa asam and good sweet kopi and roti canai.He misses his clipper fleet and the crews (And isn't it true that he hired even the brown people for his crews?Even had them as captains?)who sailed his Mishimoto clippers to the far side of the world, sailing even as far as Europe, carrying tea strains resistant to genehack weevil and returning with expensive cognacs that had not been seen since the days of the Expansion.And in the evenings, he returned to his wives and ate well and worried only that a son was not diligent or that a daughter would find a good husband.How silly and ignorant he had been.He fancied himself a sea trader, and yet understood so little of the turning tides.A young girl emerges from under a tarp flap.She smiles at him, too young to know him for a stranger, and too innocent yet to care.She is alive, burning with the limber vitality that an old man can only envy with every aching bone.She smiles at him.She could be his daughter.* * *   Malaya's night was black and sticky, a jungle filled with the squawks of night birds and the pulse and whir of insect life.Dark harbor waters lapped before them.He and Fourth Daughter, that useless waif, the only one he could preserve, hid among piers and rocking boats, and when darkness fell completely, he guided her down to the water, to where waves rushed onto the beach in steady surges and the stars overhead were pinpricks of gold in blackness."Look, Ba.Gold," she whispered.There were times when he'd told her that every star was a bit of gold that was hers for the taking, because she was Chinese and with hard work and attendance to her ancestors and traditions, she would prosper.And now, here they were under a blanket of gold dust, the Milky Way spread over them like some great shifting blanket, the stars so thick that if he were tall enough he could reach up and squeeze them and have them run down his arms.Gold, all around, and all of it untouchable.Amid the lapping of fishing boats and little spring craft, he found a rowboat and pulled for deep water, aiming for the bay, following the currents, a black speck on the shifting reflections of the ocean.He would have preferred a cloudy night, but at least there was no moon, and so he pulled and pulled, while all around them sea carp surfaced and rolled, showing the fat pale bellies that people of his clan had engineered to feed a starving nation.He pulled on the oars and the carp surrounded them, showing bloated stomachs now thickened on the blood and gristle of their creators.And then his little boat was alongside the object of his search, a trimaran anchored in the deep.The place where Hafiz's boat people slept.He climbed aboard and slipped silent among them.Studying them all as they slept soundly, protected by their religion.Safe and alive while he had nothing.His arms and shoulders and back ached from the strain of rowing.An old man's aches.A soft man's pains.He slipped among them, searching, too old for the nonsense survival, and yet unable to give it up.He might still survive.The one daughter mouth might survive.Even if she was a girl child.Even if she would do nothing for her ancestors, at least she was of his clan.A clipping of DNA that still might be saved.Finally he found the body he wanted, leaned down and touched it gently, covered the man's mouth."Old friend," he whispered.The man's eyes went wide as he awoke."Encik Tan?"He nearly saluted, even half naked and lying on his back.And then, as if recognizing the change in their fortunes, his hand fell back, and he addressed Hock Seng as he had never dared in real life."Hock Seng?You're still alive?"Hock Seng pursed his lips."This useless daughter mouth and I need to go north.I need your help. "Hafiz sat up, rubbing his eyes.He glanced furtively at the rest of his sleeping clan.He whispered, "If I turned you in, I would make a fortune.The head of Three Prosperities.I would be rich. ""You were not poor when you worked with me. ""Your head is worth more than all the Chinese skulls stacked in the streets of Penang.And I would be safe. "Hock Seng started to respond angrily but Hafiz put his hand up, indicating silence.He ushered Hock Seng to the edge of the deck, against the rail.He leaned close, his lips nearly touching Hock Seng's ear."Do you not know the danger you bring on me?Some of my own family wear green headbands now.My own sons!It is not safe here. ""You think this is something I just learned now?"Hafiz had the grace to look away, embarrassed."I cannot help you. "Hock Seng grimaced."Is this what my kindness to you has earned?Did I not attend your wedding?Gift you and Rana well?Fete you for ten days?Did I not pay for Mohammed's admission to college in K. L.?""You did that and more.My debts are to you are great. "Hafiz bowed his head."But we are not the men we were before.The Green Headbands are everywhere among us, and those of us who loved the yellow plague can only suffer.Your head would buy my family security.I'm sorry.It is true.I don't know why I don't strike you now. ""I have diamonds, jade. "Hafiz sighed and turned away, showing his broad muscled back."If I took your jewels, I would just as quickly be tempted to take your life.If we speak of money, then your head must always be the most valuable prize.Best not to discuss the temptations of wealth. ""So this is how we end?"Hafiz turned back to Hock Seng, pleading."Tomorrow I will give your clipper ship Dawn Star to them and foreswear you utterly.If I were smart I would turn you in as well.All the ones who have aided the yellow plague are suspected now.We who fattened on Chinese industry and thrived under your generosity are the most hated in our new Malaya.The country is not the same as it was.People are hungry.They are angry.They call us all calorie pirates, profiteers, and yellow dogs.There is nothing to quell it.Your blood is already shed, but they have yet to decide what to do with us.I cannot risk my family for you. ""You could come north with us.Sail together. "Hafiz sighed."The Green Headbands already sail the coasts searching for refugees.Their net is wide and deep.And they slaughter those they catch. ""But we are clever.More clever than they.We could slip past. ""No, it is impossible. ""How do you know?"Hafiz looked away, embarrassed."My sons boast to me. "Hock Seng scowled bitterly, holding his granddaughter's hand.Hafiz said, "I'm sorry.My shame will go with me until I die. "He turned abruptly and hurried for the galley.He returned with unspoiled mangoes and papaya.A bag of U Tex.A PurCal cibi melon."Here, take these.I'm sorry I can do no more.I'm sorry.I have to think of my own survival as well. "And with that he ushered Hock Seng off the boat and out into the waves.A month later, Hock Seng crossed the border alone, crawling through leech infested jungle after being abandoned by the snakeheads who betrayed them.Hock Seng has heard that those who helped the yellow people later died in droves, plunging from cliffs into the sea to swim as best they could for the shore's smashing rocks, or shot where they floated.He wonders often if Hafiz was one of those to die, or if his gift of the last of Three Prosperities' unscuttled clippers was enough to save his family.If his Green Headband sons spoke for him, or if they watched coldly as their father suffered for his many, many sins.* * *   "Grandfather?Are you well?"The little girl touches Hock Seng gently on the wrist, watching him with wide black eyes."My mother can get you boiled water if you need to drink. "Hock Seng starts to speak, then simply nods and turns away.If he speaks to her, she will know him for a refugee.Best that he simply blend in.Best not to reveal that he lives amongst them at the whim of white shirts and the Dung Lord and a few faked stamps on his yellow card.Best to trust no one, even if they seem friendly.A smiling girl one day is a girl with a stone bashing in the brains of a baby the next.This is the only truth.One can think there are such things as loyalty and trust and kindness but they are devil cats.In the end they are only smoke and cannot be grasped.Another ten minutes of twisting passages carries him close to the city's seawalls where hovels attach themselves like barnacles to the ramparts of revered King Rama XII's blueprint for the survival of his city.Hock Seng finds Laughing Chan sitting beside a jok cart eating a steaming bowl of U Tex rice porridge with small bits of unidentifiable meat buried in the paste.In his last life, Laughing Chan was a plantation overseer, tapping the trunks of rubber trees to capture latex drippings, a crew of one hundred and fifty under him.In this life, his flair for organization has found a new niche: running laborers to unload megodonts and clipper ships down on the docks and out on the anchor pads when Thais are too lazy or thick, or slow, or he can bribe someone higher up to let his yellow card crew have the rice.And sometimes, he does other work as well.Moves opium and the amphetamine yaba from the river into the Dung Lord's very own towers.Slips AgriGen's SoyPRO in from Koh Angrit, despite the Environment Ministry's blockades.He's missing an ear and four teeth but that doesn't stop him from smiling.He sits and grins like a fool, and shows the gaps in his teeth, and all the while his eyes roam over the passing pedestrian traffic.Hock Seng sits and another bowl of steaming jok is set before him, and they eat the U Tex gruel with coffee that is almost as good as what they used to drink down south, and all the while both of them watch the people all around, their eyes following the woman who serves them from her pot, the men crouched at the other tables in the alley, the commuters squeezing past with their bicycles.The two of them are yellow cards, after all.It is as much in their nature as a cheshire's search for birds."You're ready?"Laughing Chan asks."A little longer, yet.I don't want your men to be seen. ""Don't worry.We almost walk like Thais, now. "He grins and his gaps show."We're going native. ""You know Dog Fucker?"Laughing Chan nods sharply and his smile disappears."And Sukrit knows me.I will be below the seawall, village side.Out of sight.I have Ah Ping and Peter Siew to watch close. ""Good then. "Hock Seng finishes his jok and pays for Laughing Chan's food as well.With Laughing Chan and his men nearby, Hock Seng feels a little better.But still, it is a risk.If this thing goes wrong Laughing Chan will be too far away to do much more than effect vengeance.And really, when Hock Seng thinks about it, he isn't sure he has paid enough for that.Laughing Chan saunters off, slipping between tarp structures.Hock Seng continues on through the stagnant heat to the steep, rough path that runs up the side of the seawall.He climbs up through the slums, his knee aching with every step.Eventually, he reaches the high broad embankment of the city's tidal defenses.After the sheltered stink of the slums, the sea breeze rushing over him and tugging at his clothes is a relief.The bright blue ocean reflects like a mirror.Others stand on the embankment's promenade, taking the fresh air.In the distance one of King Rama XII's coal pumps squats like a massive toad on the embankment's edge.The symbol for Korakot, the crab, is visible in its metal hide.Steam and smoke gout from its stacks in steady puffs.Somewhere, deep underground, organized by the genius of the King, the pumps send their tendrils and suck water from beneath so that the city will not drown.Even in the hot season, seven pumps run steadily, keeping Bangkok from being swallowed.In the rainy season, all twelve of the zodiac signs run as the rain drenches down and everyone poles the thoroughfares of the city in skiffs, skin soaked, grateful that the monsoon hasn't failed and that the seawalls haven't broken.He makes his way down the other side and out on a dock.A farmer with a skiff full of coconuts offers him one, slashing open the green top for Hock Seng to drink.Across the waters the drowned buildings of Thonburi poke up through the waves.Skiffs and fishing nets and clipper ships slip back and forth in the water.Hock Seng takes a deep breath, sucking the smell of salt and fish and seaweed deep into his lungs.The life of the ocean.A Japanese clipper slides past, palm oil polymer hull and high white sails like a gull's.The hydrofoil package below it is still hidden, but once it's out in the water, it will use its spring cannon to launch its high sails, and then the ship will leap up from the water like a fish.Hock Seng remembers standing on the deck of his own first clipper, its high sails flying, slashing across the ocean like a stone skipped by a child, laughing as they tore over the waves, as spray rushed and blasted him.He had turned to his number one wife and told her that all things were possible, that the future was theirs.He settles himself on the shoreline and drinks the rest of the green coconut water while a beggar boy watches.Hock Seng beckons.This one is smart enough, he supposes.He likes to reward the smart ones, the ones who are patient enough to linger and see what he will do with a coconut husk.He hands it to the boy.The boy takes it with a wai and goes to smash it on the mortared stones at the top of the seawall.Then he squats and uses a scrap of oyster shell to scrape the slimy tender meat from the interior, starving.Eventually, Dog Fucker arrives.His real name is Sukrit Kamsing, but Hock Seng seldom hears the man's true name on the lips of yellow cards.There is too much bile and history built up.Instead, it's always Dog Fucker, and the words drip with hate and fear.He's a squat man, full of calories and muscle.As perfect for his work as a megodont is for converting calories into joules.The scars on his hands and arms show pale.The slits where his nose once stood stare at Hock Seng, two dark vertical nostril slashes that give him a porcine appearance.There is some argument among yellow cards about whether Dog Fucker let fa' gan run too long, allowing its cauliflower growths to send enough tendrils deep into his flesh that doctors were forced to chop the whole thing off to save his life, or if the Dung Lord simply took his nose to teach him a lesson.Dog Fucker squats beside Hock Seng.Hard black eyes."Your Doctor Chan came to me.With a letter. "Hock Seng nods."I want to meet with your patron. "Dog Fucker laughs slightly."I broke her fingers and fucked her dead for interrupting my nap. "Hock Seng keeps his face impassive.Maybe Dog Fucker is lying.Maybe he is telling the truth.It is impossible to know.Regardless, it is a tease.To see if Hock Seng will flinch.To see if he will bargain.Perhaps Doctor Chan is gone.Another name to weigh him down when he finally reincarnates.Hock Seng says, "Your patron will look favorably on the offer, I think. "Dog Fucker scratches absently at the slit of a nostril."Why not meet me at my office, instead?""I like open places. ""You have people around here?More yellow cards?You think they'll make you safe?"Hock Seng shrugs.He looks out at the ships and their sails.At the wide world beckoning."I want to offer you and your patron a deal.A mountain of profit. ""Tell me what it is. "Hock Seng shakes his head."No.I must speak with him in person.Him only. ""He doesn't talk to yellow cards.Maybe I'll just feed you to the red fin plaa out there.Just like the Green Headbands did with your kind down south. ""You know who I am. ""I know who your letter says you were. "Dog Fucker rubs at the edges of his nose slits, studying Hock Seng."Here, you're just another yellow card. "Hock Seng doesn't say anything.He hands the hemp sack of money across to Dog Fucker.Dog Fucker eyes it suspiciously, doesn't take it."What is it?""A gift.Look and see. "Dog Fucker is curious.But also cautious.It's a good thing to know.He isn't the sort to put his hand in a bag and come up with a scorpion.Instead, he loosens the sack and dumps it.Bundles of cash spill out, roll in the shells and dirt of low tide.Dog Fucker's eyes widen.Hock Seng keeps himself from smiling."Tell the Dung Lord that Tan Hock Seng, head of the Three Prosperities Trading Company has a business proposal.Deliver my note to him and you will also profit greatly. "Dog Fucker smiles."I think perhaps that I'll simply take this money, and my men will beat you until you tell me where you hide all your paranoid yellow card cash. "
