Was he truly unmanned?Was his head truly mounted in front of the Environment Ministry as a warning to the white shirts?It makes Hock Seng want to gather his money and flee, but the blueprints in the safe keep him bound to his desk.He hasn't felt undercurrents like this since the Incident.He stands and goes to the office shutters.Peers out to the street.Goes back to his treadle computer.A minute later, he moves to the factory's observation window to study the Thais working on the lines.It's as if the air is charged with lightning.A storm is coming, full of water spouts and tidal waves.Hazards outside the factory, and hazards within.Halfway into the shift, Mai came again, shoulders slumped.Another sick worker, sent off to a third hospital, Sukhumvit this time.And down below, at the heart of the manufacturing system, something foul reaches for them all.Hock Seng's skin crawls at the thought of disease brewing in those vats.Three is too many for coincidence.If there are three, then there will be more, unless he reports the problem.But if he reports anything, the white shirts will burn the factory to the ground and Mr.Lake's kink spring plans will go back across the seas, and everything will be lost.A knock comes on the door."Lai. "Mai slips into the room, looking frightened and miserable.Her black hair is disarrayed.Her dark eyes scan the room, looking for signs of the farang."He's gone to his lunch. "Hock Seng supplies."Did you deliver Viyada?"Mai nods."No one saw me drop her. ""Good.That's something. "Mai gives him a miserable wai of acknowledgment."Yes?What is it?"She hesitates."There are white shirts about.Many of them.I saw them at the intersections, all the way to the hospital. ""Did they stop you?Question you?""No.But there are a lot of them.More than usual.And they seem angry. ""It is the Tiger, and Trade.That is all.It can't be us.They don't know about us. "She nods doubtfully, but does not leave."It is difficult for me to work here," she says."It's too dangerous now.The sickness. "She stumbles on her words, finally says, "I'm very sorry.If I'm dead" she trails off."I'm very sorry. "Hock Seng nods sympathetically."Yes.Of course.You do no good for yourself if you are sick. "Privately, though, he wonders what safety she can really find.Nightmares of the yellow card slum towers still wake him at night, shaking and grateful for what he has.The towers have their own diseases, poverty is its own killer.He grimaces, wondering how he himself would balance the terrors of some unknown sickness against the certainty of work.No, this work is not a certainty.This is the same thinking that caused him to leave Malaya too late.His unwillingness to accept that a clipper ship was sinking and to abandon it when his head was still above the waves.Mai is wise where he is dull.He nods sharply."Yes.Of course.You should go.You have youth.You are Thai.Something will come to you. "He forces a smile."Something good. "She hesitates."Yes?"he asks."I hoped I could have my last pay. ""Of course. "Hock Seng goes to the petty cash safe, swings it open, reaches in and pulls out a handful of red paper.In a fit of reckless generosity that he doesn't quite understand himself, he hands the entire wad over to her."Here.Take this. "She gasps at the amount."Khun.Thank you. "She wais."Thank you. ""It's nothing.Save it.Be careful with it "  A shout rises from the factory floor, then more shouts.Hock Seng feels a surge of panic.The manufacturing line stalls.The stop bell rings belatedly.Hock Seng rushes to the door, looks down at lines.Ploi is waving her hand toward the gates.Others are abandoning their posts, running to the doors.Hock Seng cranes his neck, seeking the cause."What is it?"Mai asks."I can't tell. "He turns and runs to the shutters, yanks them open.White shirts fill the avenue, marching in ordered ranks.He sucks in his breath."White shirts. ""Are they coming here?"Hock Seng doesn't answer.He looks over his shoulder at the safe.With a little time No.He's being a fool.He waited too long in Malaya; he won't make the same mistake twice.He goes to the petty cash safe and begins pulling out all the remaining cash.Stuffing it into a sack."Are they coming because of the sick?"Mai asks.Hock Seng shakes his head."It doesn't matter.Come here. "He goes to another window and opens the shutters, revealing the blaze of the factory rooftop.Mai peers out over hot tiles."What's this?""An escape route.Yellow cards always prepare for the worst. "He smiles as he hoists her up."We are paranoid, you know. "19  "You emphasized to Akkarat that this was a time sensitive offer?"Anderson asks."What are you complaining about?"Carlyle toasts Anderson over a warm glass of rice beer."He hasn't had you ripped apart by megodonts. ""I can put resources in his hands.And we aren't asking for much in return.Not by historical standards. ""Things are going his way.He might not think he needs you.Not with the white shirts bowing and scraping.He hasn't had this much influence since before the December 12 debacle. "Anderson makes a face of irritation.He reaches for his drink then sets it back.He doesn't want more warm booze.Between the swelter of the day and the Sato, his mind is already dumb and clouded.He's starting to suspect that Sir Francis is trying to drive farang away, slowly whittling them down with empty promises and warm whiskey no ice today, so sorry.Around the open bar, the few other patrons all look as heat stunned as he is."You should have joined up when I first offered," Carlyle observes."You wouldn't be stewing now. ""When you first offered, you were a blowhard who'd just lost an entire dirigible. "Carlyle laughs."Missed the big picture on that one, didn't you?"Anderson doesn't respond to the man's needling.It's annoying to have Akkarat dismiss the offer of support so easily, but the truth is, Anderson can barely focus on his job.Emiko fills his thoughts, and his time.Every night he seeks her out at Ploenchit, monopolizes her, rains baht on her.Even with Raleigh's greed, the windup's company is cheap.In a few more hours, the sun will sink, and she will once again totter up on stage.The first time he saw her perform, she caught him watching and her eyes had clutched at him, begging to be saved from what was about to occur."My body is not mine," she told him, her voice flat when he asked about the performances."The men who designed me, they make me do things I cannot control.As if their hands are inside me.Like a puppet, yes?"Her fists clenched, opening and closing unconsciously, but her voice remained subdued."They made me obedient, in all ways. "And then she had smiled prettily and flowed into his arms, as if she had made no complaint at all.She is an animal.Servile as a dog.And yet if he is careful to make no demands, to leave the air between them open, another version of the windup girl emerges.As precious and rare as a living bo tree.Her soul, emerging from within the strangling strands of her engineered DNA.He wonders if she were a real person if he would feel more incensed at the abuse she suffers.It's an odd thing, being with a manufactured creature, built and trained to serve.She herself admits that her soul wars with itself.That she does not rightly know which parts of her are hers alone and which have been inbuilt genetically.Does her eagerness to serve come from some portion of canine DNA that makes her always assume that natural people outrank her for pack loyalty?Or is it simply the training that she has spoken of?The sound of marching boots intrudes on Anderson's thoughts.Carlyle straightens from his slump, craning for a view of the commotion.Anderson turns, and nearly knocks over his beer.White uniforms fill the street.Pedestrians and bicycles and food carts are scattering aside, frantically piling against the walls of rubble and factories, making way for the Environment Ministry's troops.Anderson cranes his neck.Spring rifles and black batons and gleaming white uniforms as far as he can see.A streaming dragon of determination marching past.The resolute face of a nation that has never been conquered."Jesus and Noah," Carlyle mutters.Anderson watches carefully."That's a lot of white shirts. "At some unknown signal, two of the white shirts peel away from the main group and enter Sir Francis'.They survey the farang lying stupid in the heat with barely masked disgust.Sir Francis, normally so absent and unconcerned, bustles out and wais deeply to the men.Anderson jerks his head toward the door."Time to go, you think?"Carlyle gives a grim nod."Let's not be too obvious, though. ""A little late for that.You think they're looking for you?"Carlyle's face is tight."I was actually hoping it was you they were after. "Sir Francis finishes speaking with the white shirts.He turns and calls out to his patrons."So sorry.We are closed now.Everything is closed.You must leave immediately. "Anderson and Carlyle both sway to their feet."I shouldn't have drunk so much. "Carlyle mutters.They stumble outside with the other bar patrons.Everyone stands under the blazing sun, blinking stupidly as more white shirts stream by.The thud of bootfalls fills the air.Echoes from the walls.Thrums with the promise of violence.Anderson leans close to Carlyle's ear."This isn't another of Akkarat's manipulations, I don't suppose?Not like your lost dirigible or anything?"Carlyle doesn't answer but the grim expression on his face tells Anderson everything he needs to know.Hundreds of white shirts fill the street, and more keep coming.The uniformed river is unending."They have to be pulling troops in from the countryside.There's no way this many white shirts work in the city. ""They're the Ministry's front line, for the burnings," Carlyle says."For when cibiscosis or poultry flu gets out of hand. "He starts to point then drops his hand, not wanting to draw attention them.Nods instead."See the badge?The tiger and the torch?They're practically a suicide division.That's where the Tiger of Bangkok got his start. "Anderson nods grimly.It's one thing to complain about the white shirts, to joke about their stupidity and hunger for bribes.It's another to watch them march by in shining ranks.The ground shakes with tramping feet.Dust rises.The street reverberates with their increasing number.Anderson has an almost uncontrollable urge to flee.They are predators.He is prey.He wonders if Peters and Lei had even this much warning before Finland went wrong."You have a gun?"he asks Carlyle.Carlyle shakes his head."More trouble than they're worth. "Anderson scans the street for Lao Gu."My rickshaw man's gone missing. ""Goddamn yellow cards. "Carlyle laughs quietly."Always got their fingers to the wind.I'll bet there's not a yellow card in the city who's not in hiding right now. "Anderson grips Carlyle's elbow."Come on.Try not to draw attention to yourself. ""Where we going?""To put our own fingers to the wind.See what's happening. "Anderson leads him down a side street, aiming for the main freight khlong, the canal that leads to the sea.Almost immediately, they run into a cordon of white shirts.The guards lift their spring rifles and wave Anderson and Carlyle away."I think they're securing the whole district," Anderson says."The locks.The factories.  ""Quarantine?""They'd have masks if they were here to burn. ""A coup then?Another December 12?"Anderson glances at Carlyle."A bit ahead of schedule for that, aren't you?"Carlyle eyes the white shirts."Maybe General Pracha has gotten the jump on us. "Anderson tugs him in the opposite direction."Come on.We'll go to my factory.Maybe Hock Seng knows something. "All along the street, white shirts are busily rousting people from their shops, encouraging them to close their doors.The last of the shop keepers are shoving wooden panels into sockets and sealing their storefronts.Another company of white shirts marches by.Anderson and Carlyle arrive at the SpringLife factory in time to see megodonts streaming out of the main gates.Anderson snags one of the megodont men.The mahout switches his beast to halt and regards Anderson as the megodont snorts and shuffles its feet impatiently.Line workers stream around their obstruction."Where's Hock Seng?"Anderson asks."Yellow Card Boss.Where?"The man shakes his head.More workers are hurrying out."Did the white shirts come here?"he asks.The man says something too fast for Anderson to pick up.Carlyle translates."He says the white shirts are coming for revenge.Coming to get back their face. "The man motions emphatically and Anderson steps out of the way.Across the street, the Chaozhou factory is also evacuating its workers.None of the street's storefronts are open now.Food carts have all been dragged indoors or wheeled away in fright.Every door on the street is shut.A few Thais peer out from high windows but the street itself contains only disbursing workers and marching white shirts.The last of the SpringLife workers hurry past, none of them looking at Carlyle or Lake as they flee."Worse by the minute," Carlyle mutters.His face has gone pale under his tropical tan.A new wave of white shirts rounds the corner, six wide, a snake extending down the length of the street.Anderson's skin prickles at the sight of the closed shop fronts.It's as if everyone is preparing for a typhoon."Let's make like the natives and get inside. "He grabs one of the heavy iron gates and hauls against it."Help me. "It takes them both to drag the gates closed and set the crossbars.Anderson slaps locks into place and leans against hot iron, panting.Carlyle studies the bars."Does this mean we're safe?Or trapped?""We're not in Khlong Prem Prison yet.So let's assume we're winning. "But inwardly, Anderson wonders.There are too many variables in play, and it makes him nervous.He remembers a time in Missouri when the Grahamites rioted.There had been tension, some small speeches, and then it had simply erupted in field burning.No one had seen the violence coming.Not a single intelligence officer had anticipated the cauldron boiling beneath the surface.Anderson had ended up perched atop a grain silo, choking on the smoke of HiGro fields going up in sheets of flame, firing steadily at rioters on the ground with a spring rifle he'd salvaged from a slow moving security guard, and all the while he had wondered how everyone had missed the signs.They lost the facility because of that blindness.And now it is the same.A sudden eruption, and the surprise of realizing that the world he understands is not the one he actually inhabits.Is this Pracha, making a play for absolute power?Or Akkarat, causing more trouble?Or is it simply a new plague?It could be anything.As Anderson watches white shirts stream past, he can almost smell the smoke of burning silos and HiGro.He waves Carlyle into the factory."Let's find Hock Seng.If anyone knows anything, it will be him. "Upstairs, the administrative offices are empty.Hock Seng's incense burns steadily, sending up gray silk streamers.Papers lie abandoned on his desk, rustling under the gentle breeze of the crank fans.Carlyle laughs, low and cynical."Lost an assistant?""Looks that way. "The petty cash safe is unlocked.Anderson peers at the shelves.At least 30,000 baht gone missing."Goddamn.The bastard robbed me. "Carlyle pushes open a shutter, revealing roof tiles stretching down the length of the factory."Take a look at this. "Anderson frowns."He was always messing with the latches on that one.I thought he wanted to keep people out. ""I think he's ducked out of it, instead. "Carlyle laughs."You should have fired him when you had a chance. "The tramp of more boots on cobbles echoes up to them, the only sound now in the street."Well, give him points for foresight. ""You know what the Thais say: 'When a yellow card runs, watch out for the megodont behind him. '"Anderson surveys the offices one last time, then leans out the window."Come on.Let's see where my assistant went. ""You serious?""If he didn't want to meet the white shirts, then we don't either.And he obviously had a plan. "Anderson hoists himself up and climbs out into the sun.His hands burn on the tiles.He straightens, shaking them.It's like standing on a skillet.He studies the roof, breathing shallowly in the blast furnace heat.Down the length of the roof, the Chaozhou factory beckons.Anderson goes a few paces then turns and calls back."Yeah.I think he went this way. "Carlyle climbs out onto the roof.Sweat gleams on his face and soaks his shirt.They make their way over reddish tiles as the air boils around them.At the far end of the roof, their route terminates at an alley, shielded from Thanon Phosri by a winding of the lane.Across the gap, a ladder dangles to the ground."I'll be damned. "They both stare down into the alley three stories below."Your old Chinaman jumped that?"Carlyle asks."Looks like it.And then went down the ladder. "Anderson peers over the edge."Long way down. "He can't help smiling darkly at Hock Seng's resourcefulness."Sly bastard. ""It's a long jump. ""Not too bad.And if Hock Seng "  Anderson doesn't get a chance to finish his sentence.Carlyle flies past him, hurtling across the gap.The man lands hard and hits the roof rolling.A second later he's up, grinning and waving for Anderson to follow.Anderson scowls and makes his own run at the gap.The landing rattles his teeth.By the time he straightens, Carlyle is already disappearing over the edge, climbing down the ladder.Anderson follows, favoring a bruised knee.Carlyle is surveying the alley when Anderson drops down beside him."That way goes back to Thanon Phosri and our friends," Carlyle says."We don't want that. ""Hock Seng is paranoid," Anderson says."He'll have a path worked out.And it won't be on main streets. "He heads in the opposite direction.Almost immediately, a slot between two factory walls appears.Carlyle shakes his head in admiration."Not bad. "They squeeze into the narrow way, scraping along for more than a hundred meters until they reach a door of rusted tin.As they push aside the crude gate, a grandmother looks up from a bundle of washing.They're in a courtyard of sorts.Laundry hangs everywhere, sun pouring a rainbow through damp fabrics.The old woman waves at them to proceed past her.A moment later, they're out in a tiny soi, which in turn gives way to a series of maze like alleys that twist through a makeshift slum for the coolie laborers who work the levee locks, transporting goods from the factories to the sea.More micro alleys, laborers crouched over noodles and fried fish.WeatherAll shacks.Sweat and the dimness of overhanging roofs.Burning chile smoke that makes them cough and cover their mouths as they forge through the swelter."Where the hell are we?"Carlyle murmurs."I'm completely turned around. ""Does it matter?"They thread past dogs lying dazed in the heat and cheshires perched atop refuse piles.Sweat runs down Anderson's face.The buzz of afternoon alcohol is long gone.More shadowy alleys, more tight walking spaces, twists and turns, squeezing around bicycles and scavenged piles of metal and coconut plastics.A gap opens.They spill out into diamond sunlight.Anderson sucks at the relatively fresh air, grateful to be out of the claustrophobia of the alleys.It is not a large road, but still, there is traffic on it.Carlyle says, "I think I recognize this.There's a coffee guy somewhere around here that one of my clerks likes. ""No white shirts, at least. ""I need to find a way back to the Victory. "Carlyle says."I've got money in their safe. ""How much is your head worth?"Carlyle grimaces."Eh.Maybe you're right.I need to get in touch with Akkarat, at least.Find out what's going on.Decide on our next move. ""Hock Seng and Lao Gu both disappeared. "Anderson says."For now, let's make like the yellow cards and lie low.We can take a rickshaw to Sukhumvit khlong, and then take a boat to near my place.That will keep us far away from any of the factory and trade areas.And far away from all those damn white shirts. "He flags down a rickshaw man, not bothering to bargain as he and Carlyle climb aboard.Away from the white shirts, Anderson can feel himself relaxing.Almost feels foolish for his earlier fear.For all he knows, they could have just walked down the street and never been bothered.No need to go running across rooftops at all.Perhaps He shakes his head, frustrated.There's too little information.Hock Seng didn't wait.Just gathered up the money and ran.Anderson thinks back on the carefully planned escape route again.The jump He can't help laughing."What's so funny?""Just Hock Seng.He had it all worked out.Everything set.As soon as there was trouble Shooo!Out the window he goes. "Carlyle grins."I never knew you were keeping a geriatric ninja. ""I thought " Anderson breaks off.The traffic is slowing.Up ahead, he catches a glimpse of white and stands for a better view."Hell. "The starched whites of the Environment Ministry are in the road, blocking traffic.Carlyle pops up beside him."Checkpoint?""Looks like this isn't just the factories. "Anderson glances behind, hunting for a way out, but more people and cyclists are piling up, jamming the way."Should we make a run for it?"Carlyle asks.Anderson scans the crowd.Beside him, another rickshaw driver stands on his pedals, studying the scene, then settles back on his seat and jangles his passing bell irritably.Their own rickshaw man joins the bell ringing."No one seems worried. "Along the road, Thais barter over piled reeking durian, baskets of lemon grass and bubbling buckets of fish.They, too, seem unconcerned."You just want to bluff through?"Carlyle asks."Hell if I know.Is this some kind of power play of Pracha's?""I keep telling you, Pracha's had his teeth pulled. ""Doesn't look like it. "Anderson cranes his neck, trying to glimpse what's happening at the road block.From what he can make out, someone is arguing with the white shirts, gesturing as he speaks.A Thai man, deep mahogany skin and a flash of gold thumb rings on his hands.Anderson strains to hear, but the words are drowned out as more cyclists pile into the jam and join in the impatient ringing of their bells.The Thais seem to believe this is nothing but an irritating traffic jam.No one is frightened, just impatient.More bicycle bells tinkle and chime, surrounding him in music."Oh Shit," Carlyle murmurs.The white shirts yank the arguing man off his bicycle.His arms flail as he goes over.His thumb rings flash in the sunlight and then he disappears under a knot of white uniforms.Ebony clubs rise and fall.Blood whips from the clubs, glistening.A doglike yelping fills the street.The cyclists all stop ringing their bells.The street noise fades as everyone turns and cranes their necks to see.In the silence, the man's ragged pleading carries easily.Around them, hundreds of bodies shift and breathe.People glance left and right, suddenly nervous, like an ungulate herd that has suddenly found a predator in its midst.The dull slap of the clubs continues.Finally, the man's sobbing breaks off.The white shirts straighten.One of them turns and motions traffic forward.It is an impatient gesture, businesslike, as though the people have stopped to gawk at flowers or a carnival.Hesitantly, cyclists push forward.Traffic begins to roll.Anderson sits down in his seat."Christ. "Their rickshaw man stands on his own pedals and they start forward.Carlyle's expression has gone tight with anxiety.His eyes flick from left to right."Last chance to run for it. "Anderson can't take his gaze from the approaching white shirts."We'll be obvious if we bolt. ""We're fucking farang.We're already obvious. "Pedestrians and cyclists inch forward, merging through the chokepoint, shuffling past the carnage.A half dozen white shirts stand around the body.Blood pools from the man's head.Flies already buzz in the red rivulets, sticky winged, drowning in the surfeit of calories.A cheshire shadow crouches eagerly at the periphery, blocked from the congealing pool by a white picket barrier of uniformed trouser legs.All the officers' cuffs are spattered red, dew kisses of kinetic energy absorbed.Anderson stares at the carnage.Carlyle clears his throat nervously.A white shirt glances up at the noise and their eyes lock.Anderson isn't sure how long they stare at one another, but the hate in the officer's eyes is unmistakable.The white shirt raises an eyebrow, challenging.He slaps his club against his leg, leaving a bloody smear.Another slap of the club and the officer jerks his head sideways, indicating that Anderson should look away.20  Death is a stage.A transience.A passage to a later life.If Kanya meditates on this idea long enough, she imagines that she will be able to assimilate it, but the truth is that Jaidee is dead and they will never meet again and whatever Jaidee earned for his next life, whatever incense and prayers Kanya offers, Jaidee will never be Jaidee, his wife will never be returned, and his two fighting sons can only see that loss and suffering are everywhere.Suffering.Pain is the only truth.But it is better for young ones to laugh a while and feel the softness, and if this desire to coddle a child ties a parent to the wheel of existence so be it.A child should be indulged.This is what Kanya thinks as she rides her bicycle across the city toward the Ministry and the housing that Jaidee's descendants have been placed in: a child should be indulged.The streets are patrolled by white shirts.Thousands of her colleagues out on the street, locking down Trade's crown jewels, barely controlling the rage that all in the Ministry feel.The fall of the Tiger.The slaughter of their father.The living saint, fallen.It's as painful as if they had lost Seub Nakhasathien again.The Environment Ministry mourns and the city will mourn with them.And if all proceeds according to General Pracha's plan, Trade and Akkarat will mourn as well.Trade has finally overstepped itself.Even Bhirombhakdi says that someone must pay for the insult.At the Ministry gates, she shows her passes and makes her way into the compound.She cycles down bricked paths between teak and banana trees to the housing quarters.Jaidee's family always kept a modest house.Modest, as Jaidee was modest.But now the last whittlings of his family live in something infinitely smaller.A bitter end for a great man.He deserved better than these mildewed concrete barracks.Kanya's own home is much larger than Jaidee's ever was, and she lives alone.Kanya leans her bicycle against a wall and stares up at the barracks.It is one of several the Ministry has abandoned.In front of the place, there is a patch of weeds and a broken swing.Not far away is a weedy takraw court for the use of Ministry men.At this time of day, no one is playing, and the net hangs limp in the heat.Kanya stands outside the dilapidated building, watching children play.None of them are Jaidee's.Surat and Niwat are apparently within.Probably already preparing for his funeral urn, calling the monks to chant and help ensure his successful trip into his next incarnation.She takes a breath.An unpleasant task, truly.Why me?she wonders.Why me?Why was I forced to work for a bodhisattva?Why was I the one?She always suspected that Jaidee knew of the extra take she got for herself and the men.But there was always Jaidee: pure Jaidee, clear Jaidee.Jaidee did the work because he believed.Not like Kanya.Cynical Kanya.Angry Kanya.Not like the others who did the job because it had the potential to pay well and a pretty girl might pay attention to a man in dress whites, a man who also had the authority to shut down her pad thai cart.Jaidee fought like a tiger, and died like a thief.Dismembered, disemboweled, tossed to dogs and cheshires and crows so that there was little left of him.Jaidee, with his cock in his mouth and blood on his face, a package delivered to the Ministry grounds.An invitation to war if only the Ministry could be sure of its enemy.Everyone whispers Trade, but only Kanya knows for certain.She has kept Jaidee's last mission to herself.Kanya burns at the shame of it.She starts up the stairs.Her heart thuds in her chest as she climbs.Why couldn't that damn honorable Jaidee keep his nose out of Trade?Take the warning?And now she must visit herself on the sons.Must tell the warrior boys that their father was a good fighter, and had a pure heart.And now I must have his equipment.Thank you so much.It is, after all, the Ministry's.Kanya raps on the door.Goes back down the steps to give the family time to arrange itself.One of the boys, Surat she thinks, opens the door, wais deeply to her, calls back inside."It's Elder Sister Kanya. "Soon Jaidee's mother in law is at the door.Kanya wais and the old woman wais even more in return and lets her in."I'm sorry to bother you. ""No bother. "Her eyes are red.The two boys regard her solemnly.Everyone stands uncertainly together.The old woman finally says, "You'll want to collect his things. "Kanya is almost too embarrassed to answer, but she manages to nod.The mother in law guides her inside to a sleeping room.It is a sign of the old woman's grief that nothing is in order.The boys watch.The old woman points to a small desk jammed into a corner, a box of his belongings.Files that Jaidee was reading."That's everything?"Kanya asks.The old woman shrugs dully."It's what he kept with him after the house was burned.I haven't touched it.He brought it here before he went to the wat. "Kanya smiles her embarrassment."Kha.Yes.Sorry.Of course. ""Why did they do this to him?Hadn't they done enough?"Kanya shrugs helplessly."I don't know. ""Will you find them?Will you get revenge on them?"She hesitates.Niwat and Surat watch her solemnly.Their playfulness is entirely gone.They have nothing.Kanya ducks her head, wais."I will find them.I swear it.If it takes me all my life. ""Do you have to take his things?"Kanya smiles uncertainly."It's protocol.I should have come before.But" She trails off helplessly."We hoped that the tides would turn.That he would be back on the job.If there are private effects or mementos, I will return them.But I need his equipment. ""Of course.It's valuable. "Kanya nods.She kneels beside the WeatherAll box of files and gear.It is a careless mangle of files and papers and envelopes and Ministry gear.A spare clip of blades for a spring gun.A baton.His zip cuffs.Files.All piled together.Kanya imagines Jaidee filling this box, Chaya already lost to him, everything else soon to be lost.No wonder he didn't bother being careful with any of it.She sifts through the stuff.Finds a photograph of Jaidee during his cadet days, standing next to Pracha, both of them looking young and confident.She takes it out, thoughtful, and sets it on the desk.She looks up.The old woman has left the room but Niwat and Surat are still there, watching her like a pair of crows.She holds out the photo.Finally, Niwat reaches out and takes it, shows it to his brother.Kanya goes through the rest of the box quickly.Everything else seems to be the Ministry's.She's obscurely relieved; she won't have to return, then.A small teak box catches her attention.She opens it.Medals from Jaidee's muay thai championships gleam.Kanya hands them over to the silent boys.They cluster around the evidence of their father's triumphs as Kanya finishes going through the papers."There's something in here," Niwat says.He holds up an envelope."Is this for us, as well?""It was with the medals?"Kanya shrugs, continuing to go through the box."What's in it?""Pictures. "Kanya looks up, puzzled."Let me see. "Niwat passes them across.Kanya shuffles through them.They seem to be a record of suspicious people that Jaidee was interested in.Akkarat figures in many.Farang.Many photos of farang.Smiling photos of men and women around the Minister like ghosts, hungry to suck at his blood.Akkarat, unaware, smiling with them, happy to be standing with them.Kanya shuffles more photos.Men she doesn't recognize.Trader farang, presumably.Here a fat one, glutted on calories from abroad, some PurCal or AgriGen representative visiting from Koh Angrit perhaps, looking to curry favor in the newly opening kingdom where Trade is in ascendancy.There another, the Carlyle man who lost his dirigible.Kanya smiles slightly.How that one must have hurt.She flips past the photo and sucks in her breath, stunned."What is it?"Niwat asks."What's wrong?""Nothing," Kanya forces herself to say."It's nothing. "The photo is of herself, drinking with Akkarat on his pleasure barge.A long lens, a bad image, but herself, clearly.Jaidee knew.Kanya stares at the photo for a long time, forcing herself to breathe.Staring at the photo.Meditating on kamma and duty, while Jaidee's sons watch her, solemn.Meditating on her patron who never spoke of this photo.Meditating on what a man of Jaidee's stature knows, and what he does not reveal, and what secrets can cost a person.She studies the photo, debating.Finally she pulls it and puts it in her pocket.The rest she shoves back into the envelope."Was it a clue?"Kanya nods solemnly.The boys nod back.They do not ask for more.They are good boys.She goes over the rest of the room carefully, looking for other evidence that she might have missed, but finds nothing.Finally she bends down to pick up the box of equipment and files.It's heavy but none of it weighs as heavily as the photo that now sits in her breast pocket like a coiled cobra.Outside, in the open air, she forces herself to breathe deeply.The stink of shame is strong in her nostrils.She can't make herself look back at the boys in the doorway.The orphans who pay the price for their father's unbending bravery.They suffer because their father chose an opponent worthy of him.Instead of shaking down noodle carts and night markets, he chose a true enemy, an implacable and relentless one.Kanya closes her eyes.I tried to tell you.You shouldn't have gone.I tried.She straps the box of belongings to her cycle's cargo rack and pedals across the compound.By the time she arrives at the main administrative building, she has recovered.General Pracha stands under the shade of a banana tree, smoking a Gold Leaf cigarette.She is surprised that she can meet the man's eyes.She approaches and wais.The general nods, accepting Kanya's greeting."You have his belongings?"Kanya nods."And you've seen his sons?"She nods again.He scowls."They piss in our house.On our own doorstep they leave his body.It should not be possible, and yet here, within our own Ministry, they throw down their challenge. "He grinds out the cigarette."You're in charge now, Captain Kanya.Jaidee's men are yours.It's time that we fought as Jaidee always wished.Make the Trade Ministry bleed, Captain.Get our face back. "21  On the crumbling tower's precipice, Emiko stares north.She has done it every day since Raleigh confirmed the windup land.Ever since Anderson sama hinted that it was possible.She cannot help herself.Even when she lies in Anderson sama's arms, even when he sometimes invites her to stay with him, paying her bar fines for days at a time, she cannot help dreaming of that place without patrons.North.She breathes deep, taking in the scents of sea and burning dung and the bloom of orchid creepers.Down below, the wide delta of the Chao Phraya laps at Bangkok's levees and dikes.On the far side, Thonburi floats as best it can on bamboo rafts and stilt houses.The Temple of the Dawn's prang rise from the water, surrounded by the rubble of the drowned city.North.Shouts come from below, breaking her reverie.It takes a moment for her brain to translate the noise filtering up, but then her mind shifts from Japanese to Thai and the sounds become words.The words become screams."Be quiet!"Mai ao!No!No nonono!""Down!Map lohng dieow nee!On your face!""Please pleaseplease!""Get down!"She cocks her head, listening to the altercation.She has good hearing, another thing the scientists gave her along with her smooth skin and her doglike urge to obey.She listens.More screams.The thud of footsteps and something breaking.Her nape prickles.She wears nothing but slim pants and a string halter.Her other clothing lies below, awaiting her change into street clothes.More shouts filter up.The scream of someone in pain.Primal, animal pain.White shirts.A raid.Adrenaline surges through her.She has to get off the roof before they arrive.Emiko turns and runs for the stairs but stops short at the stairwell.The tramp of feet echoes up."Squad Three.Clear!""Wing Clear?""Secure!"She shoves the door closed and presses her back to it, trapped.Already they clog the stairwells.She casts about the rooftop, looking for another escape route."Check the roof!"Emiko sprints for the edge of the tower.Thirty feet below, the first of the tower's balconies extends.A penthouse balcony from a time when the tower must have been luxurious.She stares down at the tiny balcony, dizzy.Below it, there is nothing but the plunge to the street and the people who fill it like black spider mites.Wind gusts, tugging her toward the edge.Emiko sways and barely catches her balance.It's as if the spirits of the air are trying to kill her.She stares down at the balcony.No.It's impossible.She turns and runs back to the door, searching for something to wedge it shut.Chips of brick and tile litter the rooftop along with the clothing draped on drying lines, but nothing she spies a piece of an old broom.Scrambles for it and jams it against the door frame.The door's hinges are so rusted that it sags with the pressure she applies.She shoves the broom handle tighter against it, grimacing.The WeatherAll of the broom is stronger than the metal of the door.Emiko casts about for another solution.She's already boiling from running back and forth like a frantic rat.The sun is a thick red ball, sinking for the horizon.Long shadows stretch across the broken surface of the building's roof.She turns in a panicked circle.Her eyes fall on the clothing and the lines.Perhaps she can use the rope to climb down.She runs to the clotheslines and tries to yank one off but it's tough and well tied.It won't come free.She yanks again.Behind her, the door shudders.A voice on the other side curses."Open up!"The door jumps in its frame as someone slams against it, trying to force past her improvised brace.Inexplicably, she hears Gendo sama in her head, telling her she is perfect.Optimal.Delightful.She grimaces at the old bastard's voice as she yanks again on the line, hating him, hating the old snake who loved her and discarded her.The line cuts into her hands but refuses to give way.Gendo sama.Such a traitor.She will die because she is optimal, but not optimal enough for a return ticket.I'm burning up.Optimal.Another thud from behind her.The door cracks.She gives up on the line.Turns in another circle, searching desperately for a solution.There is nothing except rubble and the open air all around.She might as well be a thousand miles high.Optimally high.A hinge shatters, throwing bits of metal.The door sags.With a final glance at the door, Emiko sprints again for the edge of the building, still hoping for a solution.A way to climb down.She stops, windmilling at the edge.The precipice yawns.The wind gusts.There is nothing.No handholds.No way to climb.She looks back at the clotheslines.If only   The door breaks from its hinges.A pair of white shirts spill through, stumbling, waving spring guns.They catch sight of her and charge across the roof."You!Come here!"She peers over the edge.The people are dots far below; the balcony is as small as a postage envelope."Stop!Yoot dieow nee!Halt!"The white shirts are running for her running full bore and yet somehow, strangely, they suddenly seem slow.Slow as honey on a cold day.Emiko watches them, puzzled.They are halfway across the roof, but they are so very very slow.They seem to be running through rice porridge.Their every motion drags.So slow.As slow as the man who chased her in the alleys and tried to knife her.So slow  Emiko smiles.Optimal.She steps up onto the roof ledge.The white shirts' mouths open to shout again.Their spring guns rise, seeking her.Emiko watches their slit barrels zero in on her.Wonders absently if perhaps she is actually the slow one.If gravity itself will be too slow.The wind gusts around her, beckoning.The spirits of the air tug at her, blow the black net of her hair across her eyes.She pushes it aside.Smiles calmly at the white shirts still running, still pointing their spring guns and steps backward into open air.The white shirts' eyes widen.Their guns glint red.Disks spit toward her.One, two, three she counts them as they fly four, five   Gravity yanks her down.The men and their projectiles disappear.She smashes into the balcony.Her knees slam into her chin.Her ankle twists as metal shrieks.She rolls, crashing into the balcony's railing.It shatters and peels away and she plunges into open air.Emiko grabs for a broken copper balustrade as she goes over.Yanks to a stop, dangling above an abyss.Empty air yawns all around, beckoning free fall.Hot wind gusts.Tugs at her.Emiko pulls herself up to the listing balcony, gasping.Her whole body is shaking, feels bruised, and yet all her limbs still work.She has not broken a single bone in the fall.Optimal.She swings a leg up onto the balcony, and hauls herself to safety.Metal grinds.The balcony sags under her weight, its ancient bolts loosening.She's burning up.She wants to collapse.To let herself slide from her precarious ledge and pour into the open air  Shouts from above.Emiko looks up.White shirts peer over the edge, aiming their spring guns at her.Disks pour down like silver rain.They ricochet, slash her skin, spark on metal.Fear gives her strength.She lunges for the safety of the balcony's glass doors.Optimal.The doors shatter.Glass slices her palms.Sparkling shards envelope her and then she's through the glass and in the apartment and she's running fast, blurringly fast.People are staring at her, shocked, impossibly slow   Frozen.Emiko smashes through another door and out into the hall.White shirts surround her.She plunges through them.Their surprised shouts are leaden as she streaks past.Down the stairwells.Down, down, down the stairs, leaving the white shirts far behind.Shouts from high above.Her blood is on fire.The stairwells burn.She stumbles.Leans against a wall.Even the heat of the concrete is better than her skin.She's becoming dizzy, but still she stumbles on.Men shout from above, chasing after her.Their boots thump on the stairs.Around and around and down she goes.She shoves through obstructing knots of people, jams herself between dwellers rousted by the raid.She is delirious with the furnace inside her.Tiny beads of sweat speckle her skin, forcing their way out through her absurdly designed pores, but in the heat and humidity, it does nothing to cool her.She has never felt moisture on her skin before.Always she is dry   She brushes against a man.He recoils in surprise from her blazing skin.She's burning up.She cannot blend amongst these people.Her limbs move like the flash frame pages of a child's animation book, fast, fast, fast, but choppy.Everyone is staring.She turns from the stairwell and jams through a door, stumbles down a hall, leans against a wall, panting.She can hardly keep her eyes open with the fire that burns within.I jumped, she thinks.I jumped.Adrenaline and shock.Cocktail terror, giddy amphetamine high.She's shaking.A windup's jitters.She's boiling.Faint with heat.She presses herself against the wall, trying to absorb its cool.I need water.Ice.Emiko tries to control her breathing, to listen, to know where the exterminators come from, but her mind is dizzy and clouded.How far down is she?How many flights?Keep moving.Keep going.Instead, she collapses.The floor is cool.Her breath saws in and out of her lungs.Her halter is torn.There is blood on her arms and hands where she went through the glass.She stretches out, fingers wide, palms pressed to tile, trying to absorb the coolness of the floor.Her eyes close.Get up!But she can't.She tries to control her beating heart and listen for her pursuers, but she can barely breathe.She's so hot, and the floor is so cool.Hands seize her.Voices exclaim and drop her.Grab her again.Then the white shirts are all around, dragging her down the stairs, and she's grateful, thankful that they're at least dragging her down and out into the blessed evening air, even as they scream at her and slap her.Their words wash over her.She can't understand any of it.It's all just sounds, dark and dizzy heat.They do not speak Japanese, they are not even civilized.None of them are optimal   Water splashes over her.She gags and chokes.Another deluge, in her mouth, her nose, drowning her.People are shaking her.They yell into her face.Slap her.Ask questions.Demand answers.They grab her hair and jam her face down into a bucket of water, trying to drown her, to punish her, to kill her and all she can think is thank you thank you thank you thank you because some scientist made her optimal, and in another minute this slip of a windup girl that they shout at and slap will be cool.22  The white shirts are everywhere: inspecting passes, stalking through food markets, confiscating methane.It's taken hours for Hock Seng to cross the city.Rumors say that all the Malayan Chinese have been interned in the yellow card towers.That they're about to be shipped south, back across the border to the mercy of the Green Headbands.Hock Seng listens to every whisper as he scuttles through alleys on his way back to his cash and gems, sending native Mai ahead of him, using her local's accent to scout.By the time night falls, they are still far from his destination.SpringLife's stolen money weighs heavy on him.At times he fears that Mai will suddenly turn on him and report him to the white shirts in return for a share of the cash he carries.At other times, he mistakes her for a daughter mouth, and wishes he could protect her from everything that is coming.I'm going mad, he thinks.To mistake some silly Thai girl for my own.And yet still he trusts the slight girl, the child of fish farmers, who previously proved so obedient when he still had a scrap of managerial authority, and who he prays will not turn on him now that he is a target.Darkness falls completely."Why are you so frightened?"Mai asks.Hock Seng shrugs.She does not cannot understand the complexities swirling around them.For her it is a game.Frightening, to be sure, but still a game."When the brown people turned on the yellow people in Malaya, it was like this.All at once, everything was different.The religious fanatics came with their green headbands and their machetes" He shrugs."The more careful we are, the better. "He peers out into the street from their hiding place and ducks back.A white shirt is pasting up another image of the Tiger of Bangkok, edged in black.Jaidee Rojjanasukchai.How quickly he falls from grace, and then rises like a bird to sainthood.Hock Seng grimaces.A lesson of politics.The white shirt moves on.Hock Seng scans the street again.People are starting to come out, encouraged by the relative cool of the evening.They walk through the humid darkness, coming out to do their shopping, to find a meal, to locate a favorite som tam cart.White shirts glow green under approved burn methane.They move in teams, hunting like jackals for wounded meat.Small shrines to Jaidee have appeared before store fronts and homes.His image surrounded by flickering candles and draped with marigolds, displaying solidarity and begging for protection against white shirt rage.Accusations fill the airwaves on National Radio.General Pracha speaks of the need to protect the Kingdom from those carefully unnamed who would topple it.His voice crackles over the people, tinny from hand cranked radios.Vendors and housewives.Beggars and children.The green of the methane lamps turns skin shimmery, a carnival.But amongst the rustle of sarongs and pha sin and the clank of red and gold megodont handlers, there are always the white shirts, hard eyes looking for an excuse to vent their rage."Go on. "Hock Seng prods Mai forward."See if it is safe. "A minute later Mai is back, motioning for him, and they are off again, threading through the crowds.Knots of silence warn them when new white shirts are near, fear sending laughing lovers silent, and children running.Heads duck low as the white shirts pass.Hock Seng and Mai work their way past a night market.His eyes rove over candles, frying noodles, cheshire shimmers.A shout rises ahead of them.Mai darts forward, scouting.She's back a moment later, tugging at his hand."Khun.Come quickly.They're distracted. "And then they're slipping past a clot of white shirts and the object of their abuse.An old woman lies beside her cart, her daughter at her side, clutching a shattered knee.A crowd has gathered as the daughter struggles to drag her mother upright.All around, the glass cases that held their ingredients are shattered.Shards glitter in chile sauce, amongst bean sprouts, on lime, like diamonds under the green light of methane.The white shirts stir through the woman's ingredients with their batons."Come Auntie, there must be some more money here.You thought you could bribe white shirts, but you haven't done nearly enough to burn untaxed fuel. ""Why are you doing this?"the daughter cries."What have we done to you?"The white shirt studies her coldly."You took us for granted. "His baton crashes down on her mother's knee again.The woman shrieks and the daughter cowers.The white shirt calls to his men."Put their methane tank in with the rest.We have three more streets to go. "He turns to the watching silent crowd.Hock Seng freezes as the officer's eyes travel across him.Don't run.Don't panic.You can pass, as long as you don't speak.The white shirt smiles at the watching people."Tell your friends what you see here.We are not dogs you feed with scraps.We are tigers.Fear us. "And then he raises his baton and the crowd scatters, Hock Seng and Mai with them.A block later, Hock Seng leans against a wall, panting with the effort of their flight.The city has grown monstrous.Every street holds hazard now.Down the alley, a hand cranked radio crackles with more news.The docks and factories have been shut down.Access to the waterfront is restricted to those with permits.Hock Seng suppresses a shiver.It's happening again.The walls are going up and he is stuck inside the city, a rat in a trap.He fights down panic.He planned for this.There are contingencies.But first he has to make it home.Bangkok is not Malacca.This time you are prepared.Eventually the familiar shacks and smells of the Yaowarat slums surround them.They slip through tight squeezeways.Past the people who do not know him.He forces down another rush of fear.If the white shirts have influenced the slum's godfathers, he could be in danger.He forces the thought away, drags open the door to his hovel, guides Mai inside."You did well. "He digs in his bag and hands her a bundle of the stolen money."If you want more, come back to me tomorrow. "She stares at the wealth that he has so casually handed her.If he were smart, he would strangle her and reduce the chances that she will turn on him for the rest of his savings.He forces down the thought.She has been loyal.He must trust someone.And she is Thai, which is useful when yellow cards are suddenly as disposable as cheshires.She takes the money and stuffs it into a pocket."You can find your way from here?"he asks.She grins."I'm not a yellow card.I don't have anything to fear. "Hock Seng makes himself smile in return, thinking that she does not know how little anyone cares to separate wheat from chaff, when all anyone wants to do is burn a field.23  "Goddamn General Pracha and goddamn white shirts!"Carlyle pounds the railing of the apartment.He's unshaven and unbathed.He hasn't been back to the Victory in a week, thanks to the lockdown of the farang district.His clothing is beginning to show the wear of the tropics."They've got the anchor pads locked down, they've got the locks closed.Banned access to the piers. "He turns and comes back inside.Pours himself a drink."Fucking white shirts. "Anderson can't help smiling at Carlyle's irritation."I warned you about poking cobras. "Carlyle scowls."It wasn't me.Someone in Trade had a bright idea and went too far.Fucking Jaidee," he fumes."They should have known better. ""Was it Akkarat?""He's not that stupid. ""It doesn't matter, I suppose. "Anderson toasts him with warm scotch."A week of lockdown, and it looks like the white shirts are just getting started. "Carlyle glowers."Don't look so satisfied.I know you're hurting, too. "Anderson sips."Honestly, I can't say that I care.The factory was useful.Now it's not. "He leans forward."Now I want to know if Akkarat has really done as much groundwork as you claimed. "He nods toward the city."Because it's looking like he's overstretched. ""And you think that's funny?""I think that if he's isolated, he needs friends.I want you to reach out to him again.Offer him our sincere support in this crisis. ""You've got a better offer than the one that had him threatening to have you trampled?""The price is the same.The gift is the same. "Anderson sips again."But maybe Akkarat is willing to listen to reason now. "Carlyle stares out at the green glow of methane lamps.Grimaces."I'm losing money every day. ""I thought you had leverage with your pumps. ""Stop smirking. "Carlyle scowls."You can't even threaten these bastards.They won't take messengers. "Anderson smiles slightly."Well, I don't feel like waiting until the monsoons for the white shirts to come to their senses.Set up a meeting with Akkarat.We can offer him all the help he needs. ""You think you'll just swim out to Koh Angrit and lead a revolution back in?With what?A couple clerks and shipping captains?Maybe some junior trade rep who sits out there drinking all day and hoping the Kingdom will have a famine and drop its embargoes?Pretty threatening. "Anderson smiles."If we come, we'll come from Burma.And no one will notice until its too late. "He holds Carlyle's eyes until the man looks away."Same terms?"Carlyle asks."You're not changing anything?""Access to the Thai seedbank, and a man named Gibbons.That's all. ""And you'll give what?""What does Akkarat need?Money for bribes?Gold?Diamonds?Jade?"He pauses."Shock troops. ""Christ.You're serious about the Burma thing. "Anderson waves his glass toward the night beyond."My cover here is blown.I accept that and move forward or I pack up and head back to Des Moines with my tail between my legs.Let's be honest.AgriGen has always played for keeps.Ever since Vincent Hu and Chitra D'Allessa started the company.We're not afraid of a little mess. ""Like Finland. "Anderson smiles."I'm hoping for a better return on investment, this time. "Carlyle grimaces."Christ.All right.I'll set up the meeting.But you better remember me when this is over. ""AgriGen always remembers its friends. "He ushers Carlyle out the door and closes it behind him, thoughtful.It's interesting to see what crisis brings out in a man.Carlyle, always so cocky and confident, now harried by the realization that he stands out as if he were painted blue.That the white shirts could begin interning farang or executing them at any time, and no one would mourn.Suddenly Carlyle's confidence is stripped away like a used filter mask.Anderson goes to the balcony and stares out at the darkness, to the waters far beyond, to the island of Koh Angrit and the powers that wait so patiently at the Kingdom's edge.Almost time.24  Amid the wreckage of white shirt reprisals, Kanya sits, sipping coffee.In the far corner of the noodle shop, a few patrons squat sullenly, listening to a muay thai match on a hand cranked radio.Kanya, monopolizing the customer bench, ignores them.No one dares to sit beside her.Before, they might have hazarded the companionship, but now the white shirts have shown their teeth and she sits alone.Her men have already proceeded ahead of her, ravening like jackals, cleaning out old history and bad alliances, starting fresh.Sweat trickles off the owner's chin as he leans over steaming bowls of rice noodles.Water beads on his face, glinting blue with the flare of illegal methane.He doesn't look at Kanya, probably rues the day he decided to buy fuel on the black market.The radio's tinny crackle and the faint shout of the Lumphini crowds competes with the burn of the wok as he boils sen mi for soup.None of the listeners look at her.Kanya sips her coffee and smiles grimly.Violence, they understand.A soft Environment Ministry they ignored or scoffed at.But this Ministry one with its batons swinging and spring guns ready to cut a body down elicits a different response.How many illegal burn stands has she already trashed?Ones just like this one?Ones where some poor coffee or noodle man couldn't afford the Kingdom's taxed and sanctioned methane?Hundreds, she supposes.Methane is expensive.Bribes are cheaper.And if black market fuel lacked the additives that turned the methane a safe shade of green, well, that was a risk they all took willingly.We were so easy to bribe.Kanya pulls out a cigarette and lights it on the damning blue flame under the man's wok.He doesn't stop her, acts as though she doesn't exist a comfortable fiction for both of them.She is not a white shirt sitting at his illegal burn stand; he is not a yellow card that she could throw into the towers to sweat and die with his countrymen.She draws on her cigarette, thoughtful.Even if he doesn't show his fear, she knows his feelings.Remembers when the white shirts came to her own village.They filled her aunt's fish ponds with lye and salt and burned her poultry in slaughter piles.You're lucky, yellow card.When the white shirts came for us, they didn't care about preserving anything at all.They came with their torches and they burned and burned.You'll get better treatment than we did.The memory of those sooty pale men, demon eyed behind biohazard masks makes her want to cower even now.They came at night.There was no warning.Her neighbors and cousins fled naked and screaming ahead of the torches.Behind them, their stilt houses erupted in flames, bamboo and palm roaring orange and alive in the blackness.Ash swirled around them, scalding skin, sending everyone coughing and retching.She still carries scars from that burning, pale pocks where flakes of burning palm landed hot and permanent on her thin childish arms.How she hated the white shirts.She and her cousins had huddled together, watching in awe and terror as the Environment Ministry razed their village, and she had hated them with all her heart.And now she marshals her own troops to do the same.Jaidee would appreciate the irony.In the distance, shouts of fear rise up like smoke, as black and oily as farmers' hovels burning.Kanya sniffs.It's nostalgic, in a way.The smoke is the same.She draws again on her cigarette, exhales.Wonders if her men have gotten ahead of themselves.A fire in these WeatherAll slums would be problematic.The oils that keep the wood from rotting ignite easily in the heat.She takes another puff of her cigarette.Nothing she can do about it now.Perhaps it is only an officer torching illegally scavenged scrap.She reaches out to sip her coffee and eyes the bruise on the cheek of the man who serves her.If the Environment Ministry had anything to say about it, all these yellow card refugees would be on the other side of the border.A Malayan problem.The problem of another sovereign country.Not a problem for the Kingdom at all.But Her Royal Majesty the Child Queen is merciful, compassionate in a way Kanya is not.Kanya snuffs her cigarette.It's a good tobacco, Gold Leaf, local engineering, better than anything else in the Kingdom.She pulls another cigarette from its switchgrass cellophane box, lights it on the blue flame.The yellow card keeps his expression polite as Kanya motions for him to pour more sweet coffee.The radio crackles with the stadium's cheers and the men huddling around it all cheer as well, momentarily forgetting the white shirt nearby.The footsteps are almost silent, timed with the sound of pleasure, but the yellow card's expression gives the arrival away.Kanya doesn't look up.She motions for the man standing behind to join her."Either kill me or sit down," she says.A low chuckle.The man sits.Narong wears a loose black high collar shirt and gray trousers.Tidy clothes.He could work as a clerk perhaps.Except for his eyes: his eyes are too alert.And his body is too relaxed.There is an easy confidence to him.An arrogance that has difficulty fitting into his clothes.Some people are simply too powerful to pretend a lower status.It made him stand out at the anchor pads as well.She bottles her anger, waits without speaking."You like the silk?"He touches his shirt."It's Japanese.They still have silk worms. "She shrugs."I don't like anything about you, Narong. "He smiles at that."Come now, Kanya.Here you are, promoted to captain and not a single smile in you. "He motions to the yellow card for coffee.They watch the rich brown liquid splash into a glass.The yellow card sets a bowl of soup down before Kanya, fish balls and lemongrass and chicken stock.She starts fishing out U Tex noodles.Narong sits quietly, patiently."You asked for this meeting," he says finally."Did you kill Chaya?"Narong straightens."You always lacked social grace.Even after all these years in the city and all the money we've given to you, you might as well be a Mekong fish farmer. "Kanya looks at him coldly.If she's honest with herself, he frightens her, but she won't let that show.Behind her, another cheer from the radio."You're the same as Pracha.You're all disgusting," she says."You didn't think so when we came to you, a very small and vulnerable girl, and invited you to Bangkok.You didn't think so when we supported your aunt through the rest of her years.You didn't think so when we offered you an opportunity to strike at General Pracha and the white shirts. ""There are limits.Chaya did nothing. "Narong is as still as spider, regarding her.Finally he says, "Jaidee overstepped himself.You even warned him.Be careful that you don't dive down the cobra's throat yourself. "Kanya starts to speak, then closes her mouth.Starts again, keeping her voice under control."Will you do the same to me as you did to Jaidee?""Kanya, how long have I known you?"Narong smiles."How long have I cared for your family?You are our valued daughter. "He slides a thick envelope across to her."I would never hurt you," he says."We are not like Pracha. "Narong pauses."How is the loss of the Tiger affecting the department?""Look around you. "Kanya jerks her head toward the sounds of conflict."The general is enraged.Jaidee was almost a brother to him. ""I hear he wants to come after Trade directly.Maybe even burn the Ministry to the ground. ""Of course he wants to go after Trade.Without Trade, our problems would be halved. "Narong shrugs.The envelope sits between them.It might as well be Jaidee's heart laying the counter.The return on her long ago investment in revenge.I'm sorry, Jaidee.I tried to warn you.She takes the envelope, empties the money and stuffs it into a belt pouch as Narong looks on.Even the man's smiles are sharp with cutting edges.His hair is slicked back on his head, sleek.He is both entirely still and entirely terrifying.And this is the sort you consort with, mutters a voice inside her head.Kanya jerks at the voice.It sounds like Jaidee.It has the telltales of Jaidee, of his humor and his relentlessness.The hint of laughter along with judgment.Jaidee never lost his sense of sanuk.I'm not your kind, Kanya thinks.Again the grin and the chuckle.I knew that.Why didn't you simply kill me if you knew?The voice is silent.The sound of the muay thai match continues to crackle behind them.Charoen and Sakda.A good match.But either Charoen has radically improved, or Sakda has been paid to fail.Kanya's bet will be a losing one.The match reeks of interference.Perhaps the Dung Lord has taken an interest in the fight.Kanya makes a face of irritation."Bad match?"Narong asks."I always bet on the wrong man. "Narong laughs."That's why it's so helpful to have information ahead of time. "He hands her a scrap of paper.Kanya looks through the names on the list."These are Pracha's friends.Generals, some of them.They're protected by him as the cobra sheltered the Buddha. "Narong grins."That's why they will be so surprised when he suddenly turns on them.Hit them.Make them hurt.Let them know that the Environment Ministry is not to be trifled with.That the Ministry views all infractions equally.No more favoritism.No more friendships and easy deals.Show them that this new Environment Ministry is unbending. ""You're trying to drive a wedge between Pracha and his allies?Make them angry at him?"Narong shrugs.Doesn't say anything.Kanya finishes her noodles.When no other instructions seem to be forthcoming, she stands."I must go.I can't have my men see me with you. "Narong nods, dismissing her.Kanya stalks out of the coffee shop, followed by new groans of disappointment from the radio listeners as Sakda is cowed by Charoen's newfound ferocity.On the street corner, under the green glow of methane, Kanya straightens her uniform.There is a blotchy stain on her jacket, residue of the destruction she has wreaked tonight.She frowns with distaste.Brushes at it.Again opens the list that Narong gave her, memorizing the names.The men and women are General Pracha's closest friends.And they will now be enforced against as vigorously as the yellow cards in their towers.As vigorously as General Pracha once enforced against a small village in the northeast, leaving starving families and burning homes behind him.Difficult.But, for once, fair.Kanya crumples the list in her hand.This is the shape of our world, she thinks.Tit for tat until we're all dead and cheshires lap at our blood.She wonders if it was really better in the past, if there really was a golden age fueled by petroleum and technology.A time when every solution to a problem didn't engender another.She wants to curse those farang who came before.The calorie men with their active labs and their carefully cultured crop strains that would feed the world.Their modified animals that would work so much more efficiently on fewer calories.The AgriGens and PurCals who claimed that they were happy to feed the world, to export their patented grains, and then always found a way to delay.Ah, Jaidee, she thinks.I am sorry.So sorry.For everything I have done to you and yours.I did not set out to hurt you.If I had known how much it would cost to balance against Pracha's greed, I would have never come to Krung Thep.Instead of going after her men, she makes her way to a temple.It is small, a neighborhood shrine more than anything, with only a few monks in attendance.A young boy kneels before the glittering Buddha image with his grandmother, but otherwise, the place is empty.Kanya buys some incense from the vendor at the gate and goes inside.She lights the incense and kneels, holds the burning sticks to her forehead, raises them three times in the Triple Gem: buddha, damma, sanga.She prays.How many evils has she committed?How much bad kamma must she atone for?Was it more important to honor Akkarat and his promises of a balancing of the scales?Or was it more important to honor her adoptive father, Jaidee?A man comes to your village with a promise of food for your belly, a life in the city, and money for your aunt's cough and your uncle's whiskey.And he doesn't even want to buy your body.What else can one wish for?What else could buy loyalty?Everyone needs a patron.May you have much better friends in your next life, loyal fighter.Ah, Jaidee, I am sorry.May I wander as a ghost for a million years to make atonement.May you be reborn in a better place than this.She stands and makes a final wai to the Buddha and goes out of the temple.On the steps, she looks up at the stars.She wonders how it is that her kamma has so destroyed her.She closes her eyes, fighting back tears.In the distance, a building explodes in flame.She has over a hundred men working this district, letting everyone feel the pain of real enforcement.Laws are a fine thing on paper, but painful when no bribery can ease their bind.People have forgotten this.Suddenly she feels tired.She turns away from the carnage.She has enough blood and soot on her hands for one night.Her men know their work.Home is not far.* * *   "Captain Kanya?"Kanya opens her eyes to dawn light filtering into her home.For a moment, she is too groggy to remember anything about the days, about her position  "Captain?"The voice is calling in through her screened window.Kanya pulls herself out of bed and goes to her door."Yes?"she calls through."What is it?""You're wanted at the Ministry. "Kanya opens the door and takes an envelope from the man, unbinds the seal."This is from the Quarantine Department," she says, surprised.He nods."It was a volunteer duty that Captain Jaidee had" he trails off."With everyone working, General Pracha asked" he hesitates.Kanya nods."Yes.Of course. "Her skin crawls, remembering Jaidee's stories of the wars against early strains of cibiscosis.How he worked with his heart in his throat alongside his men, all of them wondering who would die before the week was done.All of them in a terror of sickness and a sweat of work as they burned whole villages: homes and wats and Buddha images all going up in smoke while monks chanted and called spirits to their aid and people all around them lay on the ground and died, gagging on fluids as their lungs ruptured.The Quarantine Department.She reads the message.Nods sharply to the boy."Yes.I see. ""Any return?""No. "She sets the envelope on a side table, a scorpion crouched."This is all I need. "The messenger salutes and runs down the steps to his bicycle.Kanya closes the door, thoughtful.The envelope hints at horrors.Perhaps this is her kamma.Retribution.In a short time she is on her way to the Ministry, cycling through leafy streets, crossing canals, coasting down city boulevards built for five lanes of petroleum burning cars that now carry herds of megodonts.At the Quarantine Department, she endures a second security check before she is allowed to enter the complex.Computer and climate fans hum relentlessly.The whole building seems to vibrate with the energy burning within.More than three quarters of the Ministry's carbon allocation goes to this single building, the brain of the Quarantine Department that evaluates and predicts the shifts in genetic architecture that necessitate a Ministry response.Behind glass walls, LEDs on servers wink red and green, burning energy, drowning Krung Thep even as they save it.She walks down the halls, past a series of rooms where scientists sit before giant computer screens and study genetic models on the brightly glowing displays.Kanya imagines that she can feel the air combusting with all the energy being burned, all the coal being consumed to keep this single building running.There are stories of the raids that were necessary to create the Quarantine Department.Of the strange marriages that gave them footholds in these technologies.Farang brought across at great expense, foreign experts used to transfer the viruses of their knowledge, the invasive concepts of their generip criminality to the Kingdom, the knowledge needed to preserve the Thai and keep them safe in the face of the plagues.Some of these people are famous now, as important in folklore as Ajahn Chanh and Chart Korbjitti and Seub Nakhasathien.Some of them have become boddhis in their own right, merciful spirits, dedicated to the salvation of an entire kingdom.She passes through a courtyard.In the corner, a small spirit house sits, housing miniature statues of Teacher Lalji, looking like a small wizened saddhu, and the AgriGen Saint Sarah.The twinned boddhis.Male and Female, the calorie bandit and the generipper.The thief and the builder.There are only a few incense sticks burning, the usual plate of breakfast and garlands of marigolds that are always strung.When the plagues are bad, the place seethes with prayers as scientists struggle to find a solution.Even our prayers are to farang, Kanya thinks.A farang antidote for a farang plague.Take any tool you can find.Make it your own, Jaidee said in times past, explaining why they consorted with the worst.Why they bribed and stole and encouraged monsters like Gi Bu Sen.A machete doesn't care who wields it, or who made it.Take the knife and it will cut.Take the farang if they will be a tool in your hand.And if it turns on you, melt it down.You will have at least the raw materials.Take any tool.He was always practical.But it hurts.They hunt and beg for scraps of knowledge from abroad, scavenge like cheshires for survival.So much knowledge sits inside the Midwest Compact.When a promising genetic thinker arises somewhere in the world, they are cowed and bullied and bribed to work with the other best and brightest in Des Moines or Changsha.It takes a strong researcher to resist a PurCal or AgriGen or RedStar.And even if they do stand up to the calorie companies, what does the Kingdom offer them?Even their best computers are generations behind those of the calorie companies.Kanya shakes off the thought.We are alive.We are alive when whole kingdoms and countries are gone.When Malaya is a morass of killing.When Kowloon is underwater.When China is split and the Vietnamese are broken and Burma is nothing but starvation.The Empire of America is no more.The Union of the Europeans splintered and factionalized.And yet we endure, even expand.The Kingdom survives.Thank the Buddha that he extends a compassionate hand and that our Queen has enough merit to attract these terrifying farang tools without which we would be completely defenseless.She reaches a final checkpoint.Endures another inspection of her papers.Doors slide aside and then she is invited into an electric elevator.She feels the air sucked in with her, negative pressure, and then the doors close.Kanya plunges into the earth, as though she is falling into hell.She thinks of the hungry ghosts that populate this awful facility.The spirits of the dead who sacrificed themselves to leash the demons of the world.Her skin prickles.Down.Down.The elevator's doors open.A white hall and an airlock.Out of her clothes.Into a shower heavy with chlorine.Out on the other side.A boy offers her lab clothes and reconfirms her identification from a list.He informs her she won't need secondary containment procedures and then leads Kanya down more halls.The scientists here carry the haunted looks of people who know they are under siege.They know that beyond a few doors, all manner of apocalyptic terrors wait to swallow them.If Kanya thinks about it, her bowels go watery.That was Jaidee's strength.He had faith in his past lives and future ones.Kanya, though?She will be reborn to die of cibiscosis a dozen times before she is allowed to progress once more.Kamma."You should have considered that before you gave me up to them," Jaidee says.Kanya stumbles at his voice.Jaidee is trailing a few paces behind her.Kanya gasps and presses her back against a wall.Jaidee cocks his head, studying her.
