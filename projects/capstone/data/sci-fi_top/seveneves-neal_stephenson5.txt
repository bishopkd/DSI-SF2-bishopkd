I cannot tell you, Markus, how helpless and guilty I felt when I realized that Dinah was trapped on the other side.Markuss eyes went to Ivy.He had been listening to Julia for a long time, and needed a break.Ivy threw her hands up.I was trying to fly this ungainly contraption.I didnt really understand what was happening even when Julia tried to explain it to me.Yes, Markus said, I cant believe you were able to fly that thing at all.People will be talking about it a hundred years from now.Assuming people still exist, Dinah thought.Ivy was just regarding Markus, blinking slowly, looking for signs that he was being sarcastic.He wasnt.The Markus bluntness worked both ways: he could blurt out astonishingly generous compliments as easily as he could cut and burn you with his words.It sure used up all of my brain, Ivy said.They were sitting around the conference table in the Tank.Markus had not used the term inquest to describe this meeting, but that was clearly what it was.Or as close as they would ever get, in any case, to a formal determination of what had happened yesterday.It had gotten off to a reasonably brisk start with a summary from Markus, then gone off the rails as Julia had insisted on telling her story from the beginningwhich turned out to mean from the moment she had woken up in the White House next to her late husband and gone down to breakfast with her late daughter, straight through to the end of the world, and her hastily arranged launch into orbit, some thirty six hours later.Along the way had been a sequence of mishaps and coincidences just shaggy enough to be somewhat plausible.No liar could fabricate such a story.The narration had lasted for the better part of an hour despite Markuss increasingly frequent and obvious glances at his Swiss watch, and left all the others in a strange combination of spellbound, bored, horrified, and bemused.She seemed to believe that they would actually care about all of her interactions with those dead people on that dead planet.It was a common enough mistake among new arrivals.In her case it was magnified considerably by the fact that she was used to being the president.Everyone was always happy to sit and listen to the most powerful person in the world.Thank God, Julia said, that we were able to Yes, Markus said, cutting her off.Plainly he did not wish to hear any more from Julia.But just as plainly he was a little reluctant to move on to the next part of the story.Everyone seemed to be pointedly not looking at Moira.Thank you, Julia, Markus said, in a tone that made it clear she was free to leave now.Julia looked a bit startled.But we havent heard from Dr.Crewe yet.But we have heard from you, Markus pointed out.The point sank in.Julia didnt like it.Very well, she said, standing up carefully.As I mentioned before, Markus, I am eager to make myself useful in any way that I can.It is so noted, Markus said.He looked across the table, deadpan, at Ivy.Dinah knew what they were both thinking: You are worse than useless herewhich is why you were never invited.Thank you, Julia.The ex president turned away from the table.She stopped before the door leading into the Farm and turned back toward Markus one last time with a sad puppy look on her face, perhaps expecting him to just slap his thigh and laugh at the joke and warmly invite her back to her seat.When this failed to happen, a transformation came over her face that Dinah found mildly frightening to watch.What would it be like, she wondered, to be nuking people one day, and, less than a week later, to be asked to leave a meeting?Evidently it did not put Julia in the best of moods.J. B. F.  turned her back on them, as much to hide her face as to find the way out, and opened the door.During the few moments it was open, Dinah caught sight of a young woman in an Islamic style face veil standing just outside of it, waiting.The bottom half of her face was covered, but her eyes brightened and her body language was warm as she saw Julia emerging.Julia reached out to her affectionately and laid a hand on the small of her back as she turned.The two of them walked away shoulder to shoulder as the door closed.Remaining in the Tank were Markus, Dinah, Ivy, Moira, Salvatore Guodian, and Zhong Hu, an applied mathematician who was their head theorist when it came to swarm dynamics.Others knew more about orbital mechanics and rocket enginesthe old school techniques for managing individual space vehicles trajectoriesbut Hu, a specialist in complex systems, was the main architect of Parambulator, and the only person who could quite understand and explain what went wrong, or right, in a swarm.Hed spent most of his life in Beijing, but with enough time in Western universities to get along fine in English.In response to a nod from Markus, he said, I have evaluated what happened.As we already know, there was a cornering event leading to a bump.This being the polite term for a mild collision between arklets.But still, Arklet 214 had enough control authority that it could have avoided the second event.Then why didnt it?Markus asked.The algorithm predicted a near miss and so it took no action beyond routine attitude corrections.The human operator was distracted and disoriented and so was reluctant to correct course manually.I cant fault the human, Markus said, since we have warned them so many times about the consequences of flying by hand.But what went wrong with the algorithm?Nothing went wrong with it, Hu said.It had bad data.I will show you.With a few taps on his tablet he brought up a three dimensional model of Izzy on the big screen above the conference table.To a first approximation, this seemed reasonably up to date; it depicted modules and space vehicles that had been added to the complex only within the last couple of days.This is the model that the system was using yesterday for collision avoidance.Dragging his finger around on his tablet, he rotated the model on the screen so that they were looking at the nadir side.He zoomed in on the distinctive handlebar shape of the Human Genetic Archive: the pair of cold storage units projecting to port and starboard below the Zvezda module.The view was much the same as what Dinah had seen from the Flivver the day before.Hang on, is this the exact model?Is this everything?Ivy asked.Yes, Hu said.This doesnt include the thermal protection, she pointed out.That adds at least a meter to the collision envelope.That is correct, Hu said.In that sense, this model is obsolete.We have replaced it now with an upgraded version.As all understood, this was no ones fault.The Arkitects had been struggling for almost two years to keep their three dimensional model of Izzy up to date and accurate: a nearly impossible task when it changed every day.Soft goods like thermal protection blankets tended to get a lower priority.Humans, looking at the model, would mentally add those.Computers werent that smart.Still, Markus said, we take the model with a grain of salt.No arklet should ever pass that close.Let me show you what happened, Hu said, and brought up a video, shot from an external camera apparently mounted on one of the trusses.The Human Genetic Archive and its surrounding blanket of thermal protection were not centered in the framethey were down in the lower right corner.So the camera angle wasnt ideal.But they could see what happened.The arklet approached, creeping in gradually from the port side with closing velocity no greater than a slow walk.Is this real time?Sal asked.Yes.Because it was an extremely low speed approach it was not viewed as terribly dangerous.It looks like its going to be a near miss, Sal said.It wasuntil this, Hu said, and freeze framed the video.It wasnt easy to make out, but they could see a tiny flash on the forward halo of Arklet 214.The thruster firesa small course correction under automatic control.He stepped it forward.The flash faded but expanded into a dim gray cloud.Exhaust gases.Expanding rapidly but moving quite fast.He stepped it forward several more frames until they could see the thermal protection blanket recoiling from the impact of the gas.A seam parted between two adjoining blankets and one of them flailed out like a rag caught in a wind gust.Hu let the video run now, and they saw the arklets rear halo snag on the loose blanket and rip it away, exposing the Human Genetic Archive to the orange radiance of Earths atmosphere.Ivy said, If that thruster hadnt fired at the wrong moment Hu nodded.Arklet 214 would have passed underneath with two meters to spare.Not a margin to be proud of.But it would have been enough.After a pause, Hu added, The HGAs thermal protection system could have been designed better.Another pause in which everyone else waited to see who would be the first to laugh.If it werent for dark humor, theyd have no humor at all.Hu seemed to sense it.What I mean is that it was engineered for normal thermal loads.Meaning sunshine, Dinah said.Yes.Not for radiant heat shining up from the atmosphere below it.The same thing is true of many parts of Izzy, of course, Markus said.We are having thermal overloads all over the place now.Moira, whats the damage?Dinah had to give Markus credit for a kind of finesse for the offhanded way he dropped the question in.Moira, who had been quiet through the whole meeting, took a moment to snap out of her reverie.Well, she finally said, as Hu said, the thermal protection system Was bad, Markus said.We know.There was no backup system.Markus said, Of course not.The cooling system for the HGA was the rest of the universe.We do not expect to have a backup system for the rest of the universe.We can rely upon it to be cold most of the time.Because of the accelerated schedule, caused by the Eight Ball Stop, Dinah said.Everyone looked at her.Lets get this over with, she said.Look.When I was fourteen, one of my dads mines collapsed and killed eleven employees.It was terrible.He never really got better.Of course, he wanted to know what had happened.It turned out to be a long story.One thing led to another, which led to another ...the individual steps all made sense, but no one could have seen the whole thing coming.Of course, he still felt responsible, but he wasnt, in any normal sense of that word.So heres what happened, Dinah went on.Sean Probst started an asteroid mining company that sent up a bunch of cubesats and gathered a lot of data about near Earth asteroids, which he kept secret.He took the database with him on his mission to Gregs Skeleton.His radio got hit by a rock and destroyed, so he couldnt communicate.At the last minute, when it was basically too late, he had the idea to look at the database.He learned about the Eight Ball.He alerted me, I alerted Doob, Doob alerted everyone else, and we pushed up the schedule for everything.Moira pulled the trigger on the project, which had been planned for over a year, to disperse the HGA samples to the arklets.Like every other project in the history of the universe, it went slowly at first because all kinds of snags came up.And not only that, but all of the Flivvers were spoken for and all of the space suits were busy, because of the Splurge.So not much got moved.It was obviously safer to keep the samples in cold storage in the HGA while all of these logistical problems got sorted out.The Splurge happened and a lot of random shit got launched in our general direction and made Parambulator light up like crazy.Arklets were getting cornered on a pretty regular basis.We almost lost a couple.Ivy and I took off in the Flivver to fetch Julia and probably added a lot of other noise and chaos to that problem.Then, the thing we just watched happened.Arklet 214 tore most of the badly designed thermal protection system off of the HGA and exposed it to the direct radiance of the Earths atmosphere.The samples all warmed up before replacement thermal protection could be jury rigged.All of those samples have been destroyed.Right, Moira?Moira, apparently not trusting her ability to speak, nodded.Okay, Dinah said.So I think that what Markus is really asking is how many of the samples in the HGA actually got moved to safe cold storage in other locations before this happened.In other words, how many survived?Moira cleared her throat and said, in a faint voice, About three percent of them.Okay.I only have one other question, Markus said.Have you talked to Doob?Im sure he suspects, Moira said, but I have not officially broken the news to him.I wanted to be absolutely sure first.Are you sure now?Yes.Markus nodded and spent a few moments thumbing something into his phone.I am inviting him to join me and Moira here immediately, he said.Everyone who was not Markus or Moira stood up to leave.Markus held up his hand to stay them.Before you go, let me say something about the Human Genetic Archive that was lost.He then paused for effect, until everyone was looking at him.It was always bullshit, he said.Everyone took a moment to consider it.Are you going to tell Doob that?Ivy asked.Of course not, Markus said, but the real purpose of the HGA was politics on Old Earth.Is that what were calling it now?Old Earth?Sal asked, fascinated.Thats what I am calling it, Markus said, in the increasingly rare moments when I actually think about it.Thank you, Markus, Moira said.HE HAD KNOWN, OF COURSE.IZZYS COMPLEXITY WAS SO GREAT AS to belie its tiny size: a few hundred people sorted into a volume the size of a few jetliners.News traveled fast.Everyone had known within a few hours that the Human Genetic Archive had been almost completely destroyed.He was in the Tank with Markus and Moira.They were gazing across the table at him, patiently awaiting some kind of reaction.Look, he finally said, Doc Dubois is no more.That was a persona, you understand?Just an act.Im a private person.I do not spontaneously emote.Especially when people are watching me and expecting it.A year from now, when Im alone, when I least expect it, Ill break down in sobs over this.But not now.Its not that I dont feel.But my feelings are my own.I am very sorry that it happened, Moira said.Thanks, Doob said, but let me say what all of us are thinking.Seven billion people died yesterday.Compared to that, the loss of some genetic samples is nothing.The embryo that Amelia and I created together, and that I brought up here with me ...well, that was a special favor that J. B. F.  granted me as an incentive to come up here.No one else got that kind of special treatment.It was unfair.I knew it.I accepted it anyway.So here we are.Yes, Markus said.Here we are.Going forward But Im not sure I agree with you, Doob said, that the HGA was so insignificant.Markus bridled his impatience and raised his eyebrows.Doob looked at Moira.What was the term you used?Heterozygosity?Yes, Moira said.The stated purpose of the HGA was to ensure a sufficiently diverse genetic basis for the human race.Sounds important to me, Doob said.What am I missing?We have tens of thousands of human genomes recorded in digital form.From all different parts of the world.So theres your heterozygosity.Thats what youre saying, Doob prompted her.Thats whyhe glanced at Markusthe HGA wasnt really needed.Yes, but theres a but, Moira said.Okay, whats the but?The digitized sequences, as Im sure youll understand, are only useful so long as we have the equipment needed to transcribe them into functional chromosomes in viable human cells.By contrast, to make use of a sperm sample, all we need is a turkey baster and some lube.But to make use of a DNA sequence stored on a thumb drive, we need All of the equipment in your lab, Doob said.Moira looked a bit impatient.What you are referring to as my lab bears the same relationship to a proper lab as some ones and zeroes on a thumb drive does to a living human.It is a collection of crated equipment that cannot even be unpacked and used in zero gravity.And even if we set it all up and turned it all on, it would be useless without a staff of Ph.D.  level molecular biologists.Really?Useless?Markus asked.Moira sighed.For small scale work, one sample at a time, well, that is easier.But to reconstruct a genetically diverse human population But, Moira, Markus said, we cannot do that anyway until so many other things are in place.A large population cannot live in arklets eating algae.We need to establish a viable and safe colony first.Then, we build your lab.Then, we create a more diverse ecosystem: better food, greater stability.Only then do we even begin to worry about the heterozygosity of the human population.Until that time, we have more than enough people to create healthy non inbred children just by the usual process of fucking each other.That is all true, Moira said.And that is the basis of my statement that the HGA was bullshit, Markus concluded.Youre saying, Doob said, that if we had all of the prerequisites in placethe colony, the ecosystem, the talentneeded to actually exploit the HGA we would no longer need it, yes, this is my point!Markus said.Can we please stop wasting time on it now?How would you prefer to be spending time, Markus?Moira asked, giving Markus an amused, owlish look through her glasses.Talking about how to get there.How to realize that situation we were just talking of.And how might I contribute to that, given that the HGA is ninety seven percent destroyed and none of my equipment will be usable for a long time?I want to talk of preserving that equipment, Markus said, preserving it against all hazards, and then getting it to a safe situation where we can one day construct this laboratory you speak of.Its about as safe as we can make it, isnt that so?Moira asked.It was given a sort of privileged position off of Node Xquite close to Amalthea.Its not living dangerously, the way we are at the moment.She was referring to the notion, frequently discussed by Arkitects, of the Cone of Protection that supposedly existed in the lee of Amalthea.To the extent that the paths of incoming bolides were predictable, Amalthea could be pointed into them and used as a sort of battering ram.The forward surface of the asteroid would take a beatingbut a solid slug of ancient nickel and iron could survive quite a lot.Anything situated up against its aft surface would be sheltered against virtually all hazards.But the protected zone did not, of course, stretch back infinitely far.The farther you lagged behind Amalthea, the more likely you were to get hit by a bolide coming in from an off angle.The Mining Colony was in the safest position, since, by its nature, it had to be right up against the asteroid.Almost as safe was the cluster of modules connected to Node X, immediately aft of the SCRUM, which was where all of Moiras gear had been stashed.Behind that, the protected zone narrowed, a long acute cone, finally disappearing altogether somewhere aft of the Caboose.When Moira joked about living dangerously she referred to the fact that T3, the third torus, in which they were sitting now, was rather wide and rather far aft, placing it close to the limits of that cone.Efforts had been made to beef up its shielding, but it was still at higher risk than many other parts of Izzy.Markus nodded.Your stuff is pretty safe.But it would be safer if we moved it inside of Amalthea.I have talked to Dinah about it.She says that they could mine out cavities and store things of great importance there.A silence while Doob and Moira pondered it.On one level, Markuss proposal was perfectly obvious.Of course anything would be safer inside of a huge metal asteroid.On another level, it had ramifications.As of a few days agopreWhite Sky, the last time anyone had been able to think straightthe fate of Amalthea and the Mining Colony had still been subject to debate.Was the asteroid the boulder in the wheelbarrow that had to be dumped?Or was it the aegis that would shelter the entire human race?The argument had come down to statistics.They just didnt have enough data to make a decision.By suggesting that Moiras equipment be moved into the interior of Amalthea, Markus seemed to be committing to a specific course of action.It was a course that Doob instinctively agreed with.But it was a bit strange for a man like Markus to just decide on a course of action before the numbers were in.Or did he know something Doob didnt?Moira, in any case, went first.What if we Dump and Run?She was referring to a gambit, frequently discussed and war gamed, in which Amalthea would be cut loose and abandoned, and Izzy, lightweight but unprotected, would boost herself to a higher orbit with fewer bolides flying around in it.Then we would simply have to move all of that stuff back to Node X first, Markus said.Or wherever we felt was safest.This elicited a searching look from Moira.Markus held up his hands.But I take your point.I am increasingly biased against Dump and Run.You know how I feel about the Swarmamentalists, Moira said.She was referring to another of the basic gambits, Pure Swarm, in which everythingpresumably including Moiras labwould be distributed among arklets, which would then collectively move to higher orbit.People and goods would move among them through a decentralized market based economy.Listen, Markus said, now that everyone below is dead, and we dont have to put up so much with bullshit, you will find that Hu and the others have a more nuanced view than they were letting on before.He referred to the fact that Zhong Hu, as the foremost swarm theorist and the brains behind Parambulator, was assumed to be a Swarmamentalist.Doob nodded.It still took some effort to remind himself that the millions of Internet commentators arguing for this or that strategy were all ghosts now.You know something, Doob blurted out.Then, as the thought was coming into his head, he added, From Dinah.The radio.Yes, Markus said.Ymir is coming in hot, high, and heavy.He surrounded those three words with air quotes.What does that mean?Moira asked.Shes made of ice, how can she be hot?She is approaching with a high closing velocity.Not unmanageable.But ...somewhat exciting.And high?Doob prompted him.Sean also transmitted his params, Markus said.It would seem that he did us a large favor.He executed the plane change while it was still easy to do so, way out around L1.So when he says hes coming in high, Doob said, he means that Ymir has a high orbital inclinationclose to ours?Very close to ours, Markus confirmed.He is dropping this big chunk of ice into our lap.So, Moira said, on top of everything else, Sean Probst is now preparing to dive bomb us with a comet?A piece of one.A big piece, Doob guessed, if he specified heavy.The number was impressive.As Markus said this, he shifted toward Doob and looked him in the eye.Oh wow, Doob said.Is it enough for the Big Ride?If we can get Ymir to rendezvous with Izzy, then yes, Markus said.It is more than enough.The Big Ride was the third of the basic options.It meant to boost Izzy in its entiretyAmalthea and allto a much higher orbit.It had been considered implausible because of the amount of propellant that would be needed.Not just implausible butabsent the timely return of Ymirphysically impossible.Despairing of Seans chances, its supporters had lately tended to suggest scaled down variants, such as reshaping a small percentage of Amalthea into bolide deflectors and ditching most of its mass.Including the plane change?Doob asked.A trace of a smile came onto Markuss face.He knew exactly what Doob was thinking.For, unable to get Cleft out of his head, Doob had shown pictures of his favorite piece of the moon to Markus, to Konrad, to Ulrika and Ivy and some of the others who seemed to make up the informal power structure of the Cloud Ark.Let me be clear, Markus said.When I speak of the Big Ride, I mean it for real.We take all of Amalthea with us.We raise the orbit to the moons.We change the plane.We circularize.And we end up safe and sound in Cleft.And Ymir carries enough water for that mission?Yes, Markus said, if we can control her and bring her in.Isnt that Sean Probsts job?Moira asked.Not anymore, Markus said.The information I just imparted to you was in Seans final transmission.Moira and Doob looked at him sharply.The health situation has been not so good, for a long time, Markus explained.Sean was the last member of the expedition to die.Are you saying that Ymir is a ghost ship?!Doob asked.Yes.And theres no way to remote control her, Moira guessed.Unfortunately Dinahs Morse code cannot help us in that regard, Markus agreed.So someone has to go and Someone has to go and land on that fucking big piece of ice, Markus said, and get inside of Ymir and restart the nuclear reactor and commit the final burns that will bring her into sync with Izzy.Who the hell Doob began, but Markus cut him off by pointing to himself.He did this in a somewhat awkward fashion that, deliberately or not, looked like a pantomime of suicide by handgun.He said, I am placing Ivy in command of Izzy and the Cloud Ark tomorrow.I am assembling a crew that will depart in a MIV and make a rendezvous with Ymir.We will board her and manually execute the procedures needed to bring her under control and get her payload to Izzy.We will then use what is left of the ice to raise Izzys orbitand we will bring Amalthea with us on the Big Ride.Thats ...major, Moira said.Who knows?When were you going to announce it?I just decided it now.Markus sighed.Listen, it is the only way.In my heart I always considered Dump and Run and Pure Swarm both to be too risky.What happened with the HGA just makes this more obvious.The only wise course is the Big Ride.It will take a long timetwo years or something.But during all that time the most important resources can be sheltered within Amalthea.And by that I mean you and your equipment, Moira.You can have whatever resources you need from the Mining Colony to create a safe location for the genetics lab.Okay, Moira said, Ill talk to Dinah.Talk to whomever she delegates, Markus said.Dinah is going to have to come with me on the expedition.I need her to deal with all of those verdammt robots.How can I help?Doob asked.He wondered if Markus might dragoon him as well, and was torn between being afraid of that and tremendously excited.Figure out how we are going to do it, Markus said, after considering it for a few moments.Lay in a course for Cleft.Yes, Doob said.Ill do that.The little boy in him was crestfallen that he wasnt going on the adventure.Then he reminded himself that he was already part of the biggest adventure ever, and that, so far, it had been altogether miserable.ALL CONVERSATIONS WORTH HAVING ABOUT SPACE VOYAGES WERE couched in terms of delta vee, meaning the increase or decrease in velocity that had to be imparted to a vehicle en route.For, in a common bit of mathematical shorthand, the Greek letter delta () was used to mean the amount of change in ...and V was the obvious abbreviation for velocity.The words delta vee, then, were what you heard when engineers read those symbols aloud.Since velocity was measured in meters per second, so was delta vee.The delta vees bandied about in spaceflight discussions tended to be large by the standards of what Markus was now calling Old Earth.The speed of sound, for examplea.k. a.  Mach 1was three hundred and some meters per second, and most earthbound people would consider it awfully damned fast.But it hardly rose to the notice of most people who talked about space missions.A common delta vee benchmark had been the amount needed to get something from an Old Earth launch pad to an orbit like Izzys.This was some 7,660 meters per second, or more than twenty two times the speed of sound: an impossible figure for any object that had to fight its way through an atmosphere.Once a vehicle had reached the vacuum of space, though, things became simpler: rocket engines worked more efficiently, drag and aerodynamic buffeting were absent, and the consequences of failure werent invariably catastrophic.Getting it from point A to point B was a matter of hitting it with the right delta vee at the right time.Sean Probsts delta vee history, from his departure from Earth until his departure from life, had gone something like this.The launch from terra firma to Izzy on Day 68 had required a delta vee of 7,660 m/s according to a naive calculation; but as any old space hand would know, losses due to atmospheric friction and the need to push back against gravity would have elevated the practical number to more like 8,500 or 9,000.Once he had collected Larz and most of Dinahs robots, Sean had needed to execute a plane change maneuver to get from the Izzy orbitwhich was angled at about fifty six degrees to the equatorto the equatorial orbit in which Ymir was being assembled.This was one of those circumstances in which human intuition got it all wrong.The Izzy orbit and the Ymir orbit did not seem all that different in most respects.Both of them were a few hundred kilometers above the atmosphere.Both were essentially circular (as opposed to elliptical).And both went in the same direction around the Earth.The only real difference between them was that they were at different angles.And yet the delta vee required to get from one to the other was large enough that it had been necessary to launch a separate rocket, carrying nothing but extra propellant, just to refuel Seans vehicle in preparation for the plane change burn.Once Ymir had been assembled, a delta vee of some 3,200 m/s had been needed to place her in a very elongated elliptical orbit that had taken her out to L1.En route, the plane change problem had once again reared its head.Essentially everything in the solar system, including Comet Grigg Skjellerup, was confined to a flat disk centered on the sun.The imaginary plane through that disk was called the ecliptic.Conveniently for people who liked seasons, but not so good for interplanetary travelers, Earths axis and equator were angled with respect to the ecliptic by 23.5 degrees, and so Ymirs initial orbit had been off kilter by that amount.Fortunately, plane change maneuvers were much less expensive (meaning they required a lot less delta vee) when they were performed far away; and Ymir was, of course, going very far away.So, they had done the plane change out at L1 range, as part of the same burn, totaling some 2,000 m/s, that took her out through the L1 gate into heliocentric orbit.That orbit, more than a year later, had intersected that of Comet Grigg Skjellerup.As Ymir had drawn near to the comet core, she had used another 2,000 m/s of delta vee to sync her orbit with its.All of these maneuvers, up to the arrival at Grigg Skjellerup, had been achieved by using Ymirs rocket engines, which were altogether conventional: they burned propellants (fuel and oxidizer) in a chamber, making hot gas, which was vented out of a nozzle to produce thrust.The final burn had emptied her propellant tanks, so this was a one way journey unless the nuclear propulsion system could then be turned on.No engine had ever been made that was capable of pushing a comet core around the solar system at any appreciable speed.For that, they had needed to embed the nuke on a stick into the heart of the ice payload, construct an ice nozzle behind it, and then pull out the control blades, causing the reactors sixteen hundred fuel rods to become very hot.Ice turned to water, then steam, which shot out the nozzle and produced an amount of thrust actually capable of making a difference.So a few months had then been consumed disassembling Ymir and integrating its parts into a chunk of ice carved off the three kilometer ball.The question might have been asked: Why just a piece of it?Why not bring the whole comet core back, if water was so desirable?What was the point of sending a large nuclear reactor into space if you werent going to use it?And the answer lay in the fact that even a large nuclear reactor did not even come close to having enough power to move such a big piece of ice.The mission would have lasted more than a century, assuming the existence of some kind of a miracle reactor that could operate at full power for that long.In order to get this done in any reasonable amount of time, they could only bring back the bare minimum of ice needed to rendezvous with Izzy and accomplish the Big Ride.In any case, Sean and his surviving band had used the nuclear engine to impart a delta vee of about 1,000 m/s to the shard they had carved off Gregs Skeleton, thereby placing it into a somewhat different orbit that had, a few months later, glided into L1.Sean had remained alive just long enough to yank out the control blades one last time and execute a delta vee that had basically reversed the maneuver theyd used to leave the L1 gate almost two years earlier.This had simultaneously brought Ymir into geocentric orbit while executing, as cheaply as possible, the plane change needed to enable a later rendezvous with Izzy.A couple of days later Sean had tapped out the coming in hot, high, and heavy message and dropped dead.Of what, they could only conjecture.The retrieval team that was now being organized by Markus was going to use a MIV, or Modular Improvised Vehicle, assembled from a kit of parts: a sort of Lego set for the construction of spaceships, neatly sorted on a stack of modules, collectively known as the Shipyard, connected to the Caboose.The Shipyard was a generally T shaped contraption.One arm of the Ts crossbar, projecting from the port side of the Caboose, was studded with MIV parts.The opposite arm was a cluster of spherical tanks surrounding a collection of splitters.These used electrical power to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen, and piped them to chillers, which refrigerated the gases until they became cryogenic liquids that could be stored in the bulging tanks.So much for the Ts crossbar.Its long vertical stroke was a truss terminated by a nuclear reactor: not a small RTG like the ones on the arklets, but a true reactor, originally designed to power a submarine, considerably souped up for this task.Markus dubbed the Shipyards first product New Caird, after a small boat that had been used in Shackletons expedition to Antarctica.She was assembled and made ready for use in ten days: about one third of the time they estimated it would take for Ymir to arc in from L1 and make her closest pass to Earth.To design, assemble, and test such a vehicle so quickly would have been unthinkable two years ago.During the interval between Zero and the White Sky, however, the engineering staffs of several earthbound space agencies and private space companies had foreseen the future need to jury rig space vehicles from standard parts such as arklet hulls and existing rocket engines, and had provided a kit of parts, lists of procedures, and some basic designs that could be adapted to serve particular needs.In effect, New Caird had been designed a year ago by a large team of engineers on the ground, all but three of whom were now dead.Those three had been sent up to join the General Population.Building on their predecessors work, they were able to produce a general designenough to begin pulling the bits together, anywaywithin a few hours of Markuss decision.Details emerged from their CAD systems as they were needed over the following week and a half, and the necessary parts and modules were shuttled about the Shipyard until the new vehicle was ready.New Caird would have to execute one burn to reach an orbit that would intersect Ymirs and another to match her velocity, so that the crew could board the ghost ship and take the helm.The total mission delta vee for that journey, from its departure from the docking port on Izzy to its arrival at a similar docking port on Ymir, was some 8,000 meters per second.The conversation turned now to mass ratio: a figure second only to delta vee in its importance to space mission planning.It simply meant how much propellant the vehicle needed at the start of the journey in order to effect all the required delta vees.Laypersons tended to substitute fuel or gas for propellant, making the obvious analogy to the stuff that had been burned by the engines of cars and airplanes.It wasnt a bad analogy, but it was incomplete.In addition to fuel, most rocket engines needed some kind of oxygen rich chemical (ideally, just pure oxygen) with which to burn it.Cars and planes had simply used air.Rockets stored the oxidizer in a separate tank from the fuel until the moment of use.The two chemicals were collectively referred to as propellant, and their combined weight and volume tended to dominate space vehicle design in a way that hadnt been true of, say, automobiles, whose gas tanks had been small compared to their overall size.A convenient figure for characterizing that was the mass ratio, which was how much the vehicle weighed at the beginning (including the propellant) divided by how much it weighed at the end, when all the tanks had been emptied.If you knew how good the engine was, and how much delta vee you needed, then the mass ratio could be calculated using a simple formula named after the Russian scientist Tsiolkovskii, who was credited with having worked it out.It was an exponential: a fact that explained almost everything about the economics and technology of spaceflight.For if you found yourself on the wrong side of that exponential equation, you were completely screwed.When the relevant numbers for the Ymir retrieval mission were jacked into the Tsiolkovskii equation, the result was a mass ratio of about seven, meaning that for every kilogram of stuffMarkus, Dinah, other personnel, miscellaneous robots, etc.that they wanted to arrive safely at the docking port of Ymir, they needed to allow for six kilograms of propellant at the moment of departure from Izzy.This wasnt all that difficult to achieve, especially for a vehicle that would never be exposed to the rigors of passage through the atmosphere.The payload in this case was a single arklet hull that had been augmented with a side door: an airlock that could accommodate one person in a space suit.Other than that, it had been stripped to the minimum complement of equipment needed to keep a crew of four alive for a few days.To its mass, of course, needed to be added that of the actual humans and their food and other essentials.The lightness of a bare arklet hull was startling; the newer hulls, made of overwrapped composites, weighed in at eighty kilograms.Stripped of everything that made it comfortable and inhabitable over the long term, and including the side door, the maneuvering thrusters, and a reasonable supply of thruster propellant, the mass of New Caird was about ten times that.The humans weighed three hundred kilograms.The rocket motor that would be doing all the important burns weighed another two thousand.So, in round numbers, the payload massthe stuff that actually had to get delivered to the docking port of Ymirwas some thirty five hundred kilograms.The mass ratio of seven meant that its propellant load, at the beginning, was going to be some twenty one thousand kilograms of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen.The Shipyard had been stocked with several cryogenic propellant tanks of various sizes, some designed to hold LH2 (liquid hydrogen) and others built to the somewhat different specifications needed in the case of LOX (liquid oxygen).The chosen tanks were bolted together in a stack with the rocket engine mounted below and thermal protection wrapped all about.New Caird properthe arklet with the humans in itprojected forward on a scrap of scaffolding just long enough that her maneuvering thrusters wouldnt damage any of the other parts when they came on.While the MIV was being constructed, twenty one thousand kilograms of water had to be split into hydrogen and oxygen, chilled to cryogenic temperatures, and stored.The Shipyards port side already had some LH2 and LOX premade.In general, though, they tended not to keep a lot of them on hand, because they were tiresome substances to work with.The demand was supplied by the naval reactor on the Shipyards long arm, which was brought up to full power for the first time since it had been launched, piece by heavy piece, from Cape Canaveral on a series of heavy lift rockets.Pumping juice down heavy cables to the splitters, it was able to turn twenty one tons of water into gases and chill the gases to cryogenic temperatures while the other preparations were being made.This was a lot of waterroughly fourteen liters of it for every surviving human.The Cloud Ark recycled water, of course, and was far from running out of the stuff.Nonetheless, the idea of taking that much of it and spewing it into outer space, never to be recovered, gave many people pause: especially the Dump and Run partisans.There was a strong counterargument, which was that New Cairds objective was to take possession and control over a piece of frozen water that weighed as much as Izzy herself, including the giant piece of iron to which Izzy was attached (and would continue to be, if the Big Ride advocates had their way).Once New Caird had reached her, Ymir could presumably be slowed down, and brought to a rendezvous with Izzy, by firing her engine.And that was a primitive beast, but it had a basically infinite supply of energy in the nuclear reactor, and a vast stock of propellant in the form of ice.The steampunk propulsion system had much lower efficiency, however, than a properly engineered rocket motor.Consequently, the mass ratio that would be needed to slow Ymir down from the high speed elliptical orbit with which it was falling into Earths gravity well, to match the much slower, circular orbit of Izzy, was about thirty four, which meant that 97 percent of the ice currently attached to Ymir was going to be melted, turned into steam, and jetted out its makeshift nozzle just to slow it down.The remaining 3 percent, however, would still weigh as much as Izzy and Amalthea put together.Split into hydrogen and oxygen, it would supply the rocket fuel needed to power the Big Ride, all the way up to Cleft.I DIDNT EXPECT IT TO BE BLACK, DINAH SAID.SHE WAS HEARING HER own voice as if down a mile long sewer pipe.She was pretty sure she had lost consciousness a minute ago.Maybe she wasnt all the way back yet.Markus was slow in responding.Maybe he had blacked out too.Maybe he was just distracted.Comet cores are covered in Stinky black stuff, yeah, I know that, Markus.Remember who I am?Sorry.Not enough blood in brain.But this is just a shard that Sean broke off of Grigg Skjellerup.Whys it all covered?I dont know, Markus said.They were looking at Ymir from a distance of ten kilometers and closing.They were viewing her on their tablets, through a zoomed in video camera.Vyacheslav Dubsky, floating closest to New Cairds forward end, put his face to the vessels tiny window and searched the black sky for the black ship, but the squint on his face suggested it was still too far away for naked eyes to be of much use.Maybe he was doing us a favor, Dinah said.The black stuff has all kinds of goodies on it.Carbon, obviously.But also nitrogen, potassium Micronutrients, Markus said, that the Cloud Ark will be needing.So maybe he used the robots to scrape some of it off Gregs Skeleton, and loaded up on the gunk, Dinah speculated.We will know soon, Vyacheslav said.Presumably he left a document.Which we will not be alive to read, unless we stick the landing, Markus pointed out, so no more chatter from now on, please.Slava and he broke into a string of bad Russian meaning something like I trade places with you now.Vyacheslav responded in equally bad German.Both men were perfectly fluent in English.But they made a private joke of butchering each others languages, ostensibly as part of a project to preserve Old Earths linguistic heritage.Markus then added, The rest of you, buckle up.With the deft movements of one who had been in space for two years, Vyacheslav glided aft.He was one of the veteran Russian spacewalkers who had come up to Izzy way back on A+0.17, in the first launch after the moon had blown up.He had been a mainstay of the Scout and Pioneer eras, racking up more time in a suit than anyone, wearing out three Orlans.He was a little worn out too, being sallow and gaunt compared to the strapping hero who had emerged two years ago from the same Soyuz that had carried Rhys and Bolor Erdene.Markus replaced him at the forward window and buckled himself into the pilots seat.Behind that was a row of three acceleration couches, mounted on a frame that spanned a diameter of the arklets hull.Dinah was loosely belted in on the port side.A few minutes ago she had been tightly belted in.She had not adjusted the straps.The entire couch, and its supporting truss, had been deformed by the same burst of gee forces that had left her so woozy.To starboard was Jiro Suzuki, a nuclear engineer who had been involved with the design of Ymirs nuclear reactor core.It wasnt clear whether he was conscious; but then it never was with Jiro.Vyacheslav, the fourth member of New Cairds complement, settled into the middle position and pulled the top straps of the five point harness over his shoulders.A staccato burst sounded from the gamma spectrometerthe modern equivalent of a Geiger counterfloating in front of Jiros face.Then the Eenspektor, as they called this device in butchered Russian, dropped back into the normal sporadic patter.Radiation was striking the Eenspektorand their bodiesall the time, at random moments and in no particular pattern.Sometimes there would be a little burst, and that part of the mind that liked to see meaning in everything would identify it as an event.But then it would die away and be forgotten.That was just the way of the universe, and of the human psyche.There was a lot more radiation in space than there had been down on the ground, but all the survivors had long since come to terms with that, and Jiro had dialed down the sensitivity on his Eenspektor so that it wasnt screaming at them all the time.If it started screaming in the next few minutes, it wouldnt be because of some faraway cosmic event.It would be because of a radiation leak from Ymir.Starting to see the exhaust trail, Markus commented.Can you see it on video?Its faint.The sunlight hits it perfectly a few hundred meters aft of the nozzle bell.He was referring to a thread of steam that emerged from Ymir all the time, even when her engine wasnt powered up.This was how Konrad and Doob and the other astronomers aboard Izzy had been able to track the ships course using their optical telescopes, and to verify that the params encoded in Seans last transmission had been accurate.Wispy as it was, the steam trail reflected more light than did the ship itself.It was created by the slow, steady boiling of ice caused by the latent radioactivity in the ships fuel rods.When the control blades were pulled out and the reactor operated full blastwhich was almost neverit produced four gigawatts of thermal power by splitting uranium and plutonium into smaller nuclei, many of which were themselves unstable isotopes.As these fission fragments decayed into daughters and granddaughters, heat continued to be generated even when the reactor had been shut down.There was nothing that could stop it, so some loss of ice, in the form of this tenuous trail of steam, was unavoidable.It was okay.Ymir had plenty more where that came from, and Sean would have allowed for it in his calculations.Sean, never the most emotionally sharing kind of guy, further throttled by his makeshift radio, had not supplied details as to what had killed him and his crew.Had it been some kind of disastrous problem with the reactor core, he probably would have given them a heads up.For that matter, Ymir wouldnt have made it this far if the system hadnt been basically working.So Jiro was not coming into this thing expecting a total nightmare.But there was no telling.No one spoke for several minutes as Markus monitored their approach and occasionally touched the controls, spanking New Caird into a slightly different course.They had gotten here by means of two large burns.The first, and smaller, had placed them into an ellipse that had shot beyond the orbit of the former moon.After several days of weightless coasting away from the Earth, they had succumbed to the force of gravity, looped lazily around, and begun to fall back again toward the burning planet.This had been timed in such a way that, about a day later, they would be overtaken by Ymir, coming in on a roughly parallel track.But Ymir was traveling much fastercoming in hot, as Sean had told thembasically because it had been falling in toward the Earth from an extremely high starting place, gathering speed relentlessly for weeks.Left unmolested, Ymir would come screaming in toward Earth with a relative velocity of some twelve thousand meters per second, make a hairpin turn just a few kilometers shy of a catastrophic encounter with the glowing atmosphere, then go hurtling back outward again, not to return for a couple of months.Eventually her orbit would decay to the point where she would get dragged down by the atmosphere and destroyed.At any rate she would have flashed by New Caird too quickly even to be seen, her relative velocity faster than that of a rifle bullet, had New Caird not just matched her velocity by making a long, precisely timed burn of her main engine.The four members of the crew were still recovering from this.The vehicles main engine was oversizedthe kit of MIV parts from which shed been built only had so many optionsand so the gee forces had been impressive at the beginning of the burn and brutal toward the end, as the lavish expenditure of propellant had made her lighter and lighter compared to the engines formidable thrust.If Dinah had blacked out for a few seconds, why, maybe that was just as well, given that they had aimed themselves almost squarely at the Earth and then launched themselves at it as if on a suicide run.This was necessary in order to go where Ymir was going, but added up to maybe a little more excitement than she really was in the mood for at this moment in her life.Earth was, of course, completely unrecognizable.From this distance it was about the size of a tangerine held at arms length, and about the same color.Formerly a cool blue and white lake in the cosmos, it now hung there like a blob of molten steel thrown out by a welders torch.In the belt between the tropics, where most of the Hard Rain was falling, it glowed orange.The color faded and reddened to a kind of sullen brown around the poles, and the whole planet continually sparkled with the bluish light of vaporizing and exploding bolides.In a few days it would blot out half of the sky for a hectic few minutes while they slingshotted around it.By that time, they needed to have Ymirs main propulsion up and running so that they could execute the huge braking burn that would slow her down to the same velocity as Izzy.It was crazy.It was a crazy plan.The crushingly high acceleration that they had survived at the end of the big burn a few minutes ago was a physical reminder that they had only taken enough propellant to sync New Caird with Ymir.If they failed in their basic missionif they couldnt dock with Ymir and get her engine workingthey had no way of getting back to Izzy, save perhaps by the utterly insane measure of diving into Earths atmosphere on their next pass and using the air to slow them down.Dinah had been a little slow to absorb the full meaning of the little ships name.The James Caird was a small boat that Shackleton had used to make a desperate run for help to save the remnant of his failed South Pole expedition.They had aimed it at South Georgia Island, a speck on the map, in the knowledge that if they didnt hit it spot on, the prevailing winds would never allow them to turn around and make another try.She wondered if that very craziness wasnt Markus attempting to make a point.The overall situation of the human race was, of course, ludicrously desperate.Doob had been the first to point this fact out in public, two years ago.Planning and preparation had consumed the time since.The work had been hasty, improvised, and politically inflected, but fundamentally it had been a well ordered and methodical engineering project.As it had to be.But its plodding bureaucratic nature had a kind of lulling effect.How many times in the last two years had Dinah leaned back from a screen full of code and forcibly reminded herself of what was going on, and how bad it was?Unable to keep that squarely in their minds, the fifteen hundred or so survivors tended to live from one day to the next and keep doing what they had done the day before.Of all people, Sean Probst had been the least susceptible to that; he had seen what needed to be done almost immediately, and he had made efforts to do it that had been fantastically strenuous and, in the end, fatal.With his final transmission he had passed that responsibility on to Markus.Dinah suspected that Markus had stepped away from his position at the top of the org chart, and set out on this mission, partly to set an example for everyone else.And if that was true, bringing Dinah along was to make a point as well.He would spare no one, play no favorites.Markus broke the silence once during the approach: Definitely a shard.As you said.Not snowball.Not candle.I agree, Dinah said.She could see its shape clearly enough, now, on the screen of her tablet.Unlike normal ships, which carried their propellant in tanks, Ymir was a big chunk of solid propellanticeinhabited by a sort of parasitical infestation of equipment whose purpose was to convert that propellant into thrust.Not knowing exactly what he would find on Comet Grigg Skjellerup, Sean had come equipped with more than one alternative architecture for putting Ymir together.If the comet core had turned out to be a loose ball of ice dust, then hed have had to scoop out what he needed and pack it into something like a snowball, giving Ymir a spherical shape with the reactor embedded in its center.Another option would have been to fashion a long cylinder of ice and plant the reactor in one end of it, then burn it forward, consuming the ice en route, like a candle.What they were seeing now looked more like the third architecture, which was the shard.It suggested that, upon his rendezvous with Grigg Skjellerup, Sean had found it made up of at least one fairly hard and solid crystal that could be relied on to hold itself together structurally during the maneuvers to come.He had split the shard off from the main body of the comet and planted the reactor system somewhere near its middle, then embedded the rest of his shipthe part where the humans livedin what would become its nose.If the equipment had worked as planned, then executing the burnsi.e. , pulling out the control blades to place the reactor into operation and make steamhad been a matter of sending signals to actuators embedded in the core: motors that would move the rods, valves that would control the flow of steam and water, and so forth.Implicit in all of this was a hell of a lot of robot activity, which was why Sean had taken the extraordinary step of traveling personally to Izzy to clean out Dinahs supply of them before proceeding to his rendezvous with Ymir.The reactor had to be fed with ice.Because ice was a solid, it couldnt flow through tubes.Robots had to mine ice from the shard and transfer it to a feed system: a set of augers that would move it into the reactor chamber to be melted and vaporized.A Siwi robot could move a lot of material in a hurry by embedding its tail in the ice and then using a whirring mill on its head to throw off a fountain of fine shavings that could be collected and carried off by Nats.The long intervals of time between burns could be used to store up a supply of shredded ice in hoppers that would feed the augers.Downstream of the engine, robots were also needed to maintain the shape of the rocket nozzle.This was a long duct with a wide mouth on the aft face of the shard, tapering to a narrow throat near the reactor.The throat had been constructed on Earth and launched up with the reactor.It was made of a corrosion resistant alloy called Inconel.Any other material would rapidly wear out from the hot steam blasting through it.Conditions in the long spreading bell of the nozzle, however, were more benign, and so it worked fine for that to be sculpted from ice.Nonetheless, it changed its shape as it was used.Deeper in, where the exhaust was hot, it grew wider as its walls were melted by the torrent of steam.Closer to the exit, where the exhaust had cooled to below freezing, it accumulated on the walls and narrowed the passage.So robots had to scuttle around reshaping the nozzle.This was a fine task for the Nats that Larz had experimented with in Seattle.Finally there was a third crew of robots living on the exterior surface of the shard, trying to keep it from falling apart by embedding fibrous reinforcement in the outer layer of ice and wrapping cables and nets around it, somewhat like a butcher tying up a roast to prevent it from collapsing in the oven.This was a good match for the capabilities of the Grimmed (steel armored) robots, which were mostly Grabbs.All of these robots needed power, of course.They could store a little of it in batteries, but those had to be recharged.Some of them collected energy from sunlight; others had to converge from time to time on one of Ymirs little nuclear generators to sip electricity.The general picture was that Ymir would not be anything like the traditional idea of a spaceship, in the sense of an orderly, symmetrical piece of architecture.It would be more like a flying robotic anthill, constructed out of a natural found object.The robots crawling around on and in it had general instructions as to what they were supposed to be doing, but could make their own judgments from moment to moment to avoid collision with other robots, or from hour to hour as to when they needed to recharge their batteries.Or that had been the general scheme, anyway.Since thered been no guessing what Sean would find, thered been no way of coming up with any plan worthy of that name.Instead they had sent him up with tools, resources, and ingenuity.Dinah, Markus, Vyacheslav, and Jiro were about to inherit the tools and the resources.Jiros Eenspektor made steadily more noise as they approached, but the growth was slow enough that their minds didnt quite register it.Jiro did not seem alarmed by the level of radioactivity, but Dinah didnt know how to interpret that.Earlier in the mission, she had probed him for some general background about what to expect.If its very bad, we all just lose consciousness and the mission fails, hed said.The flux of radiation just shuts down our nerves, our sphincters open, we never even know its happening.In that case, Markus had pointed out, somewhat testily, there is little point in discussing that scenario.If all four of us throw up, Jiro had continued, and, say, one or more of us gets diarrhea, then we have hours to live.In that case we should just transmit a warning to Izzy and encourage them to send a second mission.In the meantime, maybe we can transmit some useful information to them.Eenspektor data, pictures, et cetera.Noted, Markus had said.If, say, one of us throws up, then it means that half of us will probably die, and so we have some chance of accomplishing the mission.If no one is barfing, then none of us is likely to die, at least over a time span of weeks.Thanks for that, Dinah had said, and tried to put it out of her mind.Now that they were actually approaching Ymir, however, it was coming back to her, and she was trying to convince herself that she wasnt feeling any nausea.I am going to traverse the nozzle mouth in about thirty seconds, Markus announced.Roger, Jiro said, and then switched off his Eenspektor altogether.He pulled up a window on the screen of his tablet.Switching to the external gamma spec now.Suddenly Ymir was filling the window.It was dead ahead of them.The glowing Earth, a third of a million kilometers away, set below its black horizon as they sidled in behind it.Markus had placed them on a trajectory that would slowly cross that of Ymir, bringing them laterally across the ice ships aft end.Dinahs older relatives might have described Ymir as having a sugarloaf shape, meaning a cone with a blunted tip.If so, this sugarloaf had been splashed with boiling water and attacked with a screwdriver in several places, giving it a scarred, irregular form.But it clearly had a fat end and a narrow end.These were about half a kilometer apart.The fat end, which was beginning to swing across their field of view, was a couple of hundred meters wide.It had a big circular hole in it, which was the outlet of the ice nozzle.New Caird could have flown into that hole and followed it almost all the way up to the throat before running out of room.And perhaps they would do so later, if they could find no other way in.But for now they were just going to make a lazy swing across it.The edge of the hole was blurry because of the evanescent steam cloud leaking out of it.This looked not so much like rocket exhaust as like breath emerging from someones mouth on a cold day.It didnt so much block their view as soften it.But the visual landscape of space was one of intense contrasts, and so it was impossible to see down into the nozzle bell, even when they were squarely in the middle of the cavernous hole.It was just a black disklike staring into the muzzle of a rifle.Hair thin needles of frost grew on the window as the steam condensed.Jiro focused intensely on his tablet until they had drifted past the midway point, then seemed to draw back into himself.He switched his Eenspektor back on.It was making a lot more noise than it had a few minutes ago, but this gradually diminished as they traversed beyond the nozzle exit and across the wide base of the sugarloaf.With a tap on the thrusters Markus got them moving forward with respect to Ymir.Earth rose on her other side.New Caird moved up alongside the shard, headed for her forward end.Whats the verdict, Jiro?Markus asked, when he was satisfied with how things were going.Based on the gamma spec, Jiro said, I would say that at least one of the fuel rods ruptured.Not at the beginning, when the rods were new, and not recently, when they were full of fission fragments and daughters, but somewhere in between.Could be worse, could be better.A memory came back to Dinah.One of Seans last messages said he was thrusting at full power.Jiro shrugged.This reactor contains sixteen hundred fuel rods, grouped in assemblies of forty, so the failure of a single rod wouldnt measurably affect performance.Even the ruptured rod still makes power, remember.Its just that it would be spewing fuel fleas, fragments, and daughters into the rocket exhaust.We would expect to see a mixture of alpha, beta, and gammawhich is just what the Eenspektor is reporting.Dinah was no nuclear physicist, but shed had enough radiation facts drilled into her to get the gist.Gamma was high energy light.It would pass through just about anything.So, bad news, good news: It was hard to shield against the stuff.But most of it passed right through your body without interactingthat is, without doing damage.It made scary noises on the Eenspektor.Betas were free flying electrons.They were easy to shield against.Good news, bad news: You could stop them with a little bit of water or plastic.But by the same token, if they came into contact with your body they were certain to break something inside of you.Alphas were helium nuclei, four thousand times as massive as betas, moving at relativistic speed.They could not pass quietly through matter any more than cannonballs could, but they did a lot of damage to whatever they hit.In order to detect anything other than gamma, Jiro had been forced to switch over to equipment mounted on the outside of New Caird, since alpha and beta couldnt penetrate the hull.And by looking at the energies of the various particles striking that equipment he had been able to diagnose conditions inside the reactor.Since she could no longer see Ymir out the front window, Dinah focused on the slivers of frost that had grown on the glass.These were rapidly sublimating into space, and would be gone in a few more minutes.Shed found them beautiful until Jiro had made them aware that they were probably contaminated.Any residual beta now?she asked.We are well clear of the nozzle and the plume, Jiro said, a little taken aback.I mean, did we pick up any contamination on that flyby?It is back down to background levels, Jiro said.But the detector would only see sources on its side of the hull.We will have to do a more thorough survey later.Get a load of this, Markus said, and punched in a maneuver that swung New Caird around ninety degrees.They were now flying sideways, their nose aimed directly at Ymir, which was only about a hundred meters away from them.She more than filled the window.Her narrow endher bow, if you wanted to think of her as a shipwas a hill of dirty ice.A few fine structures suggested that humans had been at work there: some structural netting, some cables, a glinting wire that might have been the radio aerial.But it wasnt obvious, yet, where they were actually going to dock.It is really buried, Markus observed.He didnt have to explain that it was the command modulethe part of Ymir that had life support systems.It ought to be reachable through a docking port.But they werent seeing anything.They had knownbecause it was part of the planthat Sean and his crew would have buried it in the ice, to protect them from radiation and from rocks.They looked to have buried it deep.Dinahs tablet was running a terminal window, a simple programmers interface that just displayed lines of text.For the last little while, this had shown only a blinking cursor, but now it came alive and began to display cryptic, one line messages.Picking up some new bot sigs, she reported.These were the digital signatures of robots, pinging the universe to find out what, if anything, was listening.New Caird had shipped with a complement of robots of various types, but she knew all of their sigs and was filtering them out of this terminal window.Anything that showed up here was, by process of elimination, from Ymirs complement of robots.Like the clicks on Jiros Eenspektor, these came up sporadically and in bursts.At least twenty ...so I am going to filter out the Nats, she said, typing in a command.Being so numerous, Nats tended to overload the screen.Okay, in addition to a pretty well developed Nat swarm I have half a dozen Grabbs and at least that many Siwis.Any clues in their names?Markus asked.It was possible to give each robot a unique name, which would show up on its sig.By default these were just automatically generated serial numbers, but they could be manually changed.Well, Dinah said, here is a Grimmed Grabb whose name is HELLO I AM RIGHT ON TOP OF THE DOCKING PORT, which seems promising.Can you make it flash?Hang on.Dinah established a connection to HELLO I AM RIGHT ON TOP OF THE DOCKING PORT and, after quickly checking its status, told it to blink its LEDs until further notice.Before she even looked up from her screen she could tell, by subvocal exclamations from the others, that it had worked.I see it very clearly, Markus said.Some pops and bangs sounded from the thrusters as he adjusted New Cairds attitude.They were now flying in nearly perfect sync with Ymir, looking at the flashing Grabb from a distance of maybe five meters.It was anchored into the surface of the shard in an area that was relatively free of the black stuff.Aim the light down into the ice, please?And put it on continuously?Markus requested.The Grabbs LEDs were mounted on snaky stalks that could be aimed.Dinah made it happen.When next she looked up through the window, she could see the silhouette of the Grabb centered in a nimbus of white light, produced by its aiming its lights directly into the ice.A sharp white disk was visible in the center of that silvery cloud.It was blurred by the ice, but they all recognized it for what it was: a docking port, buried at least a meter deep.Did anyone bring an ice pick?Jiro asked.It was not like him to make a joke, but Dinah was happy to take humor from any quarter at this point.Slava, Markus said, youre up.Dinah, maybe you can help by bringing more of the robots to the area.By entering a fairly simple command, Dinah was able to summon every Grabb and Siwi in range, telling them, in effect, Figure out a way to get closer to HELLO I AM RIGHT ON TOP OF THE DOCKING PORT and dont bother me with the details.By the time Vyacheslav was suited up, enough of these had drawn near that she was able to clinch several of them together and form a temporary construct that reached up from the surface of the ice to grapple New Caird, first in one location and subsequently in two more.So, even though they had not been able to dock yet, they at least had a mechanical link to Ymir that would prevent them from drifting away.Other robots, including HELLO, meanwhile busied themselves carving a hole in the ice down toward the buried docking port.Vyacheslav exited through New Cairds airlock, clambered down a stack of robots to the surface, and then made his way toward the site.Since the gravity of Ymir was negligible, Vyacheslavs weight here was about half a gram, and the faintest contact with the surface would send him rebounding off into space.So instead of walking he had to rely on some sort of anchor fixed into the ice.Dinah was able to send two of New Cairds Grabbs scuttling along ahead of him.These had been engineered for movement on ice, and could rapidly anchor themselves by melting and refreezing it with their footpads.All Slava had to do was follow them and hold on to them.Once he had reached the mouth of the hole he was able to embed anchors and carabiner himself into place.Then he speeded up the work of the robots by scooping out more ice, more quickly, than they were capable of moving with their little claws.Not knowing what to expect, they had brought with them a small arsenal of improvised ice mining tools, including a Craftsman garden shovel that had mysteriously made its way up from a Sears, Roebuck in an Old Earth mall.Slava put it to work.Meanwhile Markus was sending a status report back to the Cloud Ark, and Jiro was doing more typing than seemed necessary just for taking notes.He was communicating with someone, or, more likely, something.Dinah was tempted to ask what, but there was only one plausible answer: he had established contact with the computer that controlled the reactor core.Markus seemed to have come to the same conclusion.Jiro?he asked.News from the belly of the beast?Its alive, Jiro said, in what might have been either awkward phrasing, or a second consecutive joke.I am trying to make sense of the logs.There is a lot of repetitive material.Error messages?Markus asked, making the obvious guess.Not so much.It is robot stuff.Status reports.Dinah moved over one seat and had a look.Though she couldnt tell exactly what was going on, her general read tallied with Jiros.Lots of robots had been working away, executing variations on the same small set of programmed behaviors, pumping out occasional status reportsand, yes, some error messagesthat had generated a log too vast for any human to read.They would have to sort it out later by writing a computer script that would crawl through it, accumulating statistics and looking for patterns.Could you scroll to the top, please?she asked.She wanted to know the date and time of the first log entry.I checked it, Jiro said.Right around the time of Seans last transmission.So Sean, probably knowing that he was at deaths door, had told the robots to do something, and to keep doing it, until they were ordered to stop.Since the outer surface of the shard was pretty quiet, this probably related to some internal work hidden beneath the surface.Mining fuel, probably, Dinah guessed.Then, before Jiro could object to the incorrect choice of words, Propellant, that is.Vyacheslav exposed the docking port.Using a combination of taps on New Cairds thrusters, some pushing and pulling by the robots, and Vyacheslav simply grabbing the spacecraft and nudging it this way and that, they inserted her front door docking port into the little crater that Vyacheslav and the robots had excavated, and mated it with that of Ymirs buried command module.Slava then had to reenter New Caird through its side airlock.By sounds conducted through the hull they could track his progress as he climbed into the chamber, closed the outer hatch, and activated the system that would fill the lock with air.In the meantime, Markus was able to make contact with the computers on the other side of the port, and verify that there was breathable air and other amenities.It was damned cold, though: about twenty degrees below freezing.That was Sean doing us a favor, Markus said.He turned the thermostat down before he died.His body will be frozen solid.For Ymir had no lack of power from its nuclear generators, and its electrical systems were still working.Markus entered a command that would turn the command modules environmental systems back on and bring the temperature back up.He pressurized the tiny space between Ymirs hatch and New Cairds.Then he opened the latter.They were all looking now at the slightly domed exterior surface of the hatch that would lead into Ymirs command module.Someone had written on it with a felt tipped marker.He had drawn the trefoil symbol used to warn of radiation hazards and beneath it had written the Greek letters alpha, beta, and gamma.Then, as a darkly humorous doodle, he had added a crude skull and crossbones.Markus was the first to recover.He spiraled out of the pilots chair and propelled himself aft to the inner hatch of the airlock.There he punched a virtual button on a screen, which had the effect of locking the inner hatch.He was not letting Vyacheslav come in.He reached up with one hand and adjusted his headset.Slava, he said, can you hear me?Good.Listen.We have contamination.You may have picked some of it up on your space suit.Before you come inside, I would like you to go over to Jiros external radiation detector and see if we pick anything up.Jiro was already scanning the hatch with his Eenspektor, fortunately without results.Outside they could hear Vyacheslav cycling the airlock again and clambering back out.Using external handholds on the hull he made his way to the place where the external gamma spec was mounted, and devoted a couple of minutes to turning this way and that, directly in front of them, paying particular attention to his gloves, his knees, his bootsanything that had come into contact with the ice.No bursts of radiation were noticed, and so he was given clearance to go back to the airlock and enter New Caird.They had brought warm clothes, which seemed advisable when going on a journey to a huge piece of ice.Jiro put his on.Dinah reached for the stuff sack in which she had stored hers, but Markus held up a restraining hand.She noticed he was making no effort to dress for the occasion.Jiro was going down there alone.I am going to overpressurize us a little bit, Markus said, working with an interface on his pad.Dinah felt pressure building against her eardrums.Markus didnt explain himself, and didnt have to: they wanted clean air from New Caird to waft into Ymir, as opposed to potentially contaminated air coming in here.Jiro then pulled a disposable one piece bunny suit over his cold weather gear.For they had come prepared to find the ship contaminated.He slung his Eenspektor over the outside of the bunny suit.Dinah handed him a respirator mask, so that he wouldnt breathe radioactive dust into his lungs, and he pulled it on over the bunny suits hood and checked it for a good seal against his face.He pivoted into the space between the ships, operated the external latch on Ymirs hatch, and jerked forward slightly as the overpressure in New Caird pushed it open.He let himself drift into the command module, then got himself turned around so that his feet were oriented toward the floor.Meanwhile Markus pulled the hatch closed behind him.Vyacheslav by now had emerged from the airlock.He, Dinah, and Markus were listening to Jiros breathing on their headsets.Sean bled to death, Jiro announced.YMIRS COMMAND MODULE WAS ARKLET SIZED.OF COURSE, THAT went for almost everything now in space, since an arklet was just the biggest object that could be launched into orbit on the top of a heavy lift booster.Some arklets were tunnel, meaning that they were laid out in a horizontal orientation, meant to lie flat, as it were, like railroad tank cars, with a single long floor running from end to end.This was good if you wanted a large open space, but tended to be a less efficient use of available volume.The command module of Ymir, like that of New Caird, was silo, meaning that it was oriented in a vertical way, diced into a number of round storiestypically four or fivejoined by a ladder.Each story was a fat disk of space about four meters in diameter, big enough for one room that would be considered large by space travel standards, but more often divided into smaller compartments.Ymir was a five story silo, meaning that it had low ceilings that must have made it a claustrophobic place in which to spend a two year journey.The first story Jiro had entered, being closest to the surface with its cosmic ray and bolide hazards, was a single room.On the plans, it was supposed to be used for storage of things like food, scrubber cartridges, robot parts, and tools.After a few minutes Jiro was able to set up a video link from a camera mounted to his head.They watched it on their tablets.The frozen body of Sean Probst was floating in a sleep sack that had been zip tied to the ceiling.The porous fabric was stained dark brown.Very little of it had not been soaked with blood.Bumping lightly against him was an old school Geiger counter, tethered by another zip tie.The word BUSTED had been written on it with the same felt tip pen used to make the sign.After sweeping Seans body and the rest of the level with his Eenspektor, Jiro floated down the gangway to the next level down.The noise of the Eenspektor built steadily.Oh, turn the fucking sound off, Markus said, and it went quiet.It would now display the counts per minute on its little screen, which only Jiro could see, but they wouldnt hear the clicks.The next story was a sort of general meeting, dining, and muster room, mostly open space lined with storage lockers.The third, or middle, story was divided into sleeping compartments, toilets, and showers.The fourth was a laboratory and workshop space.Those functions continued down into the fifth and bottom most story.Cold here, Jiro said, as he reached the bottom level.Suddenly a lot of beta.Okay, Markus muttered, so the contamination is there.On the fifth level down.It was cold, as they soon saw, because someone had left the door open: a manhole in the middle of the floor, big enough for a person in a space suit to climb through it and into a round shaft leading straight down into the ice.The entire length of the shaft was illuminated by white LEDs.That is remarkable, Markus said.Jiro descended into the tunnel headfirst and began to propel himself along it by the simple expedient of pulling on a knotted rope that had been fixed into its wall by ice anchors.He moved tentatively at first, then more rapidly.There is a hatch at the far enda hundred meters away, maybe, Jiro said.Radiation?Markus asked.Not so much, Jiro said.I do not think this was the route of the contamination.The hatch at the end was adorned with a more formal rendering of the radiation hazard symbol.They all knew what was on the other side of it: a small pressurized module that was physically connected to the guts of the reactor.Jiro elected not to go through, instead turning around for a return to the command module.Then he turned back suddenly, and swept the beam of his headlamp across the ice wall of the tunnel.Some long slender object was embedded in the ice.Two long slender objects.Two human bodies.Dinah gasped as she recognized Larzs strawberry blond hair.Without making any comment, Jiro made his way back up the tunnel to the lower level of the command module.He turned his attention to a locker near the hatch.Its door was open.Mining tools and space suit parts were floating around in it.Others had spilled out into the room and were drifting around aimlessly, pushed by currents of air.Jiro, Markus said, talk.Strong beta from here, Jiro said.This is where the contamination came from.He drifted back up to the common room and found a garbage bag in a cabinet, then returned to the bottom level and went to work sorting through the tools and the clothing, holding each of them in turn up to the Eenspektor as he focused on its screen.From time to time he would grimace at the results and push the item into the garbage bag.Dinah, Markus, and Vyacheslav waited in New Caird for an hour, pretending to pass the time with tasks on the screens of their tablets.Then they heard Jiros voice again: Prepare to put something out the airlock!he was shouting.It took them all a few moments to understand Jiros thinking.New Caird and the command module of Ymir now formed a closed system.Since the latter was completely embedded in ice, the only way to remove something from that systemto take out the radioactive garbagewas to put it out New Cairds airlock.There were some distant thuds.Dinah floated forward and opened the hatch to be greeted by a garbage bag, filled to the dimensions of a beach ball, and all wrapped up in duct tape.Propelled by a shove from Jiro, this entered New Caird.Dinah pushed it up to Markus, who intercepted it and tapped it sideways into the airlock.Vyacheslav slammed the hatch behind it.Then they heard a hiss, indicating that the lock had cycled.The bundle was now adrift in space.Jiros head, then the rest of him came through the port.He had stripped off the bunny suit and the respirator and presumably stuffed them into the garbage bag.He was sweaty and exhausted.Just like old times, my friend?Markus said, referring to Jiros earlier career running cleanup at Fukushima.I dont miss it, Jiro said.It was warm in the command module now, so they didnt need the parkas.But they all used bunny suits when they went into Ymir, and stripped them off before going back into New Caird.Contamination was sneaky, as Jiro put it.The beta emitted by a microscopic speck of fallout could be hidden from the Eenspektors view by just about any random obstacleand the command module was cluttered with those.So Jiros initial sweep was no guarantee that tiny beta emitting particles werent still hidden in there.If such particles found their way into a lung, or the digestive tract, fatal radiation damage was likely to result.He had, though, identified a space suit glove on the lower level as being heavily contaminated, and found lower levels of contamination on some other odds and ends that had gone into that garbage bag and out the airlock.With luck all serious sources of contamination had now been removed.BEFORE IT HAD TIME TO THAW, VYACHESLAV TOOK SEANS BODY down from the ceiling.Slava wasnt a life scientist, but he was a jack of all trades.Bundled up in parka and moon suit, he cut the sleep sack open as Jiro stood over him with the Eenspektor.He performed a cursory exam, then wrapped the body back into the sleep sack.He maneuvered it to the lower level, threaded it through the manhole in the middle of the floor, and then pushed it down the tunnel to the end, where Larz and the other crew member had been buried.There, he stashed Seans body against the ice wall.Somewhat ruining their appetite, he reported on the findings of this impromptu autopsy as they got ready to eat a meal in the common room.Sean bled to death out of his asshole, he reported.He had an internal rupture of the bowel.I picked up some beta through his belly, Jiro added.He was very emaciated at the end.Meaning?Markus asked.He swallowed a particle of fuel.Probably a fuel flea that got loose and somehow was tracked in here.Fuel flea?Jiro had used the term before.No one else knew what it meant.It had gone in one ear and out the other, just another bit of the tech jargon that was so ubiquitous on Izzy.Now that fuel fleas were killing people, it was time to learn about them.A tiny piece of uranium or plutonium that has gotten loose from a ruptured rod.As it throws off alpha particles, it zigs and zags around the roomconservation of momentum.So it hops around like a flea.The point is, it is small and it makes a lot of alpha.It lodged in a diverticulum in his bowel.It burned through his bowel wall and started a bleed that could not stop.Everyone pushed back their food.Okay, Markus said.We eat in New Caird.Once they had finished their meal, Markus told everyone that they needed to sleep, since they had a busy few days ahead of them.Jiro volunteered to take the first watch, and so the rest of them slept while Jiro stayed up going through logs and notebooks, assembling a picture of all that had happened on Ymirs journey.Suddenly they had a lot of space to spread out in.Dinah was tempted to retreat to the far end of the New Caird and get some privacy, but Markus insisted that everyone sleep down in the command module.New Caird might be free of radioactive contamination, but it was exposed to the direct hazards of space.A bolide strike would kill anyone in it.Whereas a beta emitting particle, inhaled into the lung, would take days or weeks to incapacitate the victimtime during which they could do useful work.So Vyacheslav ended up sleeping in one of the berths on Ymirs crew accommodation level, while Dinah and Markus shared another.Somewhat to her surprise, they actually managed to have sex, a thing that had occurred only once since the White Sky.It was a sly surprise, not the athletic banging around that they had enjoyed the first few times they had done it, back in the good old days when the Hard Rain had seemed far in the future and the Cloud Ark had still felt like an isolated research colony.Ymir, now separated from the rest of the human race by millions of kilometers distance and several thousand meters per second of delta vee, now had some of that old feel to it.And despite the ghoulish scene that had greeted them on arrival, Dinah liked it hereit was the space equivalent of one of Rufuss old mining campsand didnt really want to go back.But they were supposed to be saving the human race, not enjoying an exotic holiday, so she tried to get some sleep.When Markuss alarm went off five hours later she peeled out of the bag theyd been sleeping in and did her best to clean up and get into some fresh clothes.Ymir had long ago turned into a smelly bachelor pad, short on toiletries, and, as they discovered while rooting around in the common area, on food.Sean had definitely been killed by the fuel flea in his gut, but he had likely been weakened before then by malnutrition, and even by lack of oxygen.For the systems that the crew had been using to replenish Ymirs air supply were not in the best condition.The new arrivals were awakened twice during their sleep cycle by alarms from the life support system, which Jiro silenced and dealt with.When they were all awake, they ate food from the stores they had brought with them and listened to a briefing from Jiro.Let me tell you what happened to this expedition, he said.And then he told them the story as he had pieced it together from the logs left behind by the dead.The failure of the radio, shortly after the beginning of the mission, had been caused by a defective part for which there was no replacement: a simple, stupid oversight.The longest leg of the tripthe year and a half spent coasting from the L1 gate to Grigg Skjelleruphad consisted of lengthy stretches of boredom interrupted by occasional panics, most of which had to do with the life support system.This was based on using sunlight to grow algae, a process that worked well in the lab but had turned out to be difficult to sustain on Ymir.The newest arklets in the Cloud Ark had benefited, in this respect, from lessons learned operating such systems in the time since Zero, but Ymir had been built and launched very early, using systems that now seemed painfully out of date.Once they had reached Gregs Skeleton and thereby gotten access to vast amounts of water, theyd been able to make oxygen by splitting H2O, and life had improved.Until then, however, theyd been oxygen hungry and tense, trying to keep their consumption of air and food to a minimum by floating listlessly in their sacks watching the same DVDs over and over again.Health, and mental status, had suffered.They broke the shard from Grigg Skjellerup using small mining charges planted by hand, or by robots programmed by Larz.Into its nose they embedded the command module, making themselves comparatively safe from cosmic radiation and bolides for the first time since the beginning of the mission.Life began to improve.They started excavating the access tunnel into the core.Into the aft end of the shard they inserted the reactor system, letting it melt its way into the ice.Around it, in the heart of the shard, they began to excavate a cavity and sculpt out hoppers: containers designed to hold broken up ice produced by the mining robots.Twelve augerslong, spiraling ice movers, like the ones used to transport grain into elevatorswere set up to convey that loose ice from the hoppers into the space surrounding the warm reactor vessel, where it would melt and be pumped into the core itself.Meanwhile, a separate corps of robots worked on the outside of the shard, melting the ice a little bit at a time, mixing it with the fibrous material theyd brought with them, and letting it refreeze into the much tougher material known as pykrete.The steampunk propulsion system had basically worked as plannedthough not without a lot of tinkering and head scratchingon the first burn that had put it on the course back to L1.There had, however, been some problems with the augers that were used to feed ice into the reactor chamber.The augers received their inputs of ice from hoppers that had to be filled up by mining solid ice from the inside of the shard, a process for which robots were well suited, and so nothing worked at all without the assistance of a small army of robots conveying flakes of ice from mine head to hopper like ants dismantling a loaf of sugar.This part of it had actually worked.But some of the pieces of ice being mined by the robots had little rocks in them.These jammed the augers.Jams could often be repaired by operating the auger in reverse for a short time, but sometimes a robot, or even a person in a space suit, had to be sent to pry a rock out of the mechanism.An auger accident had led to the death of one member of the crew.During the months between that first burn and their arrival at L1, Larz did some programming work on the robots, trying to teach them not to collect rocky ice.They conducted a number of system tests intended to make sure that the problems theyd experienced the first time around wouldnt be repeated during the critical second burn.These ranged from small scale tests on individual robots all the way up to full dress rehearsals where the entire system would be energized and the reactor turned on to generate thrust for a few minutes.It had been during the first of those dress rehearsals when something had gone wrong in the core, resulting in damage to the jacket of a fuel rod.Jiro had an idea as to what had gone wrong.Ymirs reactor used waterthe melted ice of the comet coreas its moderator.In nuclear engineering, that meant a medium that slowed down the neutrons hurled out by fission reactions, making them more likely to stick around long enough to trigger more such reactions.In the absence of an effective moderator, the neutrons would mostly escape from the system without doing anything useful.Between being as dead as a doornail and running out of control was a narrow band of normal and healthy power output in which basically all commercial reactor operations happened.The essential problem with Ymirs reactor was that its moderatorbeing a naturally occurring substancewas impure and unpredictable.The water that flooded into the chamber for the first dress rehearsal had been melted from ice a few months earlier, around the time of the initial burn, and had been sitting in the plumbing system ever since then.There, it had been in contact with rocks and grit that had made it through the augers.It had leached various minerals out of that rock, and become something other than pure water.When the reactor was started and the pumps turned on, that impure water was drawn through screens and filters intended to exclude all the debris.But it was nonetheless impure water, and when introduced to the core, it failed to perform its function as a moderator.The reactor was sluggish to get going.With the advantage of hindsight, it could be seen that its neutron economy was suppressed, poisoned by the impurities in the water.Overreacting to the slow start, the operators had pulled the control blades out farther than they would have otherwise.But once the first rush of impure water had been flushed through the system and blown out the nozzle, it had been replaced by relatively pure water, only just now melted from the ice.The reactors power had surged, producing a sudden buildup of fission products inside the fuel rods.Some of those would have been gases such as krypton and argon.The gases would have created pressure.Fuel rods were engineered to withstand it, but one of them had failed and ruptured.Possibly it had left the factory in excellent condition but been damaged en route by a nanometeoroid that had left a microscopic flaw.In any case, for whatever reason, the rod burst open and began to spill out the highly radioactive daughters of nuclear fission, which had become mixed with the steam being blasted out the rockets nozzle.Most of the fallout had, therefore, dissipated into space.But the whole point of a rocket nozzle was to convert the thermal energy in the gasits heatinto velocity.The faster the steam went, the colder it got, until the steam near the nozzle exit was so cold that it actually began to condense into snow.Tiny particles of fallout made excellent nuclei around which a snowflake might begin to form.Some of that snow had stuck to the ice walls of the nozzle bell.The most likely explanation for what had happened next was that one of the robots crawling around in that area maintaining the shape of the nozzle had become contaminated with a mixture of alpha emitting fuel fleas and beta emitting daughters, and tracked the material to a location where it had been transferred to the glove of a space suitpossibly by a mechanism as simple as a spacewalker reaching down to brush some ice from the claw of a Grabb, or planting a foot in a location where a contaminated Grabb had stepped.The contamination had then been brought into the command module when the spacewalker came indoors.They might not even have known about the burst fuel rod, so they might not have been checking for contamination.Or, as suggested by Seans note, their Geiger counters might have broken down, one by one, rendering them blind to the presence of radioactivity in their environment.In any case, the particles had spread around the command module.Some men had inhaled them, some had swallowed them.They hadnt been healthy to begin with.IN ANY CASE, THE GOOD NEWS, IF IT COULD BE SO CALLED, WAS THAT the reactor and the engine basically worked.The improvements Larz had made to the robots mining programs had led to fewer rocks in the hoppers, and fewer jammed augers, during the L1 burn.Since then, Nats had been crawling around in the hoppers identifying rocks that had sneaked in anyway, and pushing them away from the augers.The damage to the fuel rod would have been a major catastrophe by Old Earth standardshad it happened on an earthbound reactor.Here, it was messy, and had already been fatal to a few.But everything still worked.Yes, the New Caird expedition would be bringing a radioactive disaster right into the middle of the Cloud Ark, but once they drew close enough they would jettison the reactor and let it fall into the atmosphere.Forty eight hours, give or take a few minutes, now remained before Earth would loom huge below them, and the nadir surface of the shard would sweat and steam as the radiant heat shining up from the incandescent air softened, melted, and vaporized the ice.It was then that they would have to pull out the control blades and execute Ymirs next big burn.First they would have to spin the whole ship around so that she was flying backward, her nozzle bell pointed in the direction of movement.For the delta vee they needed was a negative onea braking, as opposed to accelerating, burn.For spin moves, all spaceships were equipped with thrusters, not powerful enough to impart big delta vees but capable of rotating the ship as a whole into the desired attitude so that the main engine was pointing in the right direction.As a rule the thrusters were more effective when they were situated out toward the corners of the vehicle, where they could exert more leverage and crowbar the thing around with minimal thrust.Not knowing what they were going to find at Grigg Skjellerup, the mission planners for Ymir had packed aboard a collection of modular thruster assemblies that basically consisted of little rocket engines, propellant tanks, wireless control links, and hardware for anchoring them into ice.A cursory survey of Ymir and a look at the dead crews records made it clear that Sean and his crew had embedded those packages into the ice at suitable locations: one complex up at the nose with nozzles aiming in four perpendicular directions, and four more spaced around the fattest part of the shard.Now that New Caird was docked, her engine could also be put to use in getting Ymir spun around.But this one maneuvera 180 degree flip, which would have seemed comparatively simple in a small craft such as an arkletwas fraught with difficulties and complications in something as huge and asymmetrical as Ymir.Anticipating a need to use the thrusters, Dinah sent robots out to inspect them during that first morning, and Vyacheslav suited up and went out to do a bit of troubleshooting on a propellant line that had somehow become kinked.But so ponderous were the shards movements that the actual rotation, end over end, consumed eight hours, and tweaking it into precisely the right orientation then took another six.Whereupon Markus announced that all of their assumptions were probably wrong anyway.The atmosphere is too big, he said.He had been staring pensively, for a long time, at a string of emails from Izzy.Dinah felt a spear go through her heart.After all that had happened in the last couple of years, it was remarkable that she still had it in her to react in that way to bad news.It seemed to be some kind of built in psychological program, triggered by phrases like your mother has cancer, theres been an explosion in the mine, or what Markus had just said.They had known, from very early in the planning of the Cloud Ark, that the Hard Rain would heat up the airall of the air, all over the world.When air got hotter, it expanded.The atmosphere had only one direction in which it could expand: out into space.So, whatever drag Izzy felt from the traces of air at its accustomed altitude of some four hundred kilometers was bound to get worse as the atmosphere reached upward.How hot the air would get, how much it would expand, and how heavy the drag would get were questions of colossal import that, however, simply could not be answered until the Hard Rain actually started.As Doob always put it, the experiment of blowing up the moon had never been attempted before.The most they could do was wait and perform observations.Which was exactly what they had been doing ever since the Hard Rain had begun.But Markus had been distracted for most of that time, and was only now absorbing the latest results.For the Cloud Ark, of course, there were plans to cover various contingencies.In the easy case where the atmosphere didnt expand that much and the drag wasnt too bad, they didnt have to do much.In the more difficult casewhich was apparently the way the experiment was now shaping upthey had no choice other than to raise the orbit of every vessel they hadIzzy herself, and each arklet.The delta vees involved were not that large; three hundred meters per second sufficed to nearly double the orbital altitude and get them well clear of the danger zone.Each arklet had its own engine and enough of a propellant supply to accomplish that.For Izzy, matters were a little more complicated.If they were willing to ditch Amalthea they could get three hundred meters per second pretty easily.Bringing Amalthea along for the ride, however, increased the propellant requirements enormously.All of which had long ago been anticipated by mission planners.This was how the Dump and Run strategy had been dreamed up in the first place.So it would be easy for the arklets to get clear of the thickening atmosphere by abandoning Izzy, at least for the time being, and jumping to higher orbit.Their drag problems would be solved.But in so doing they would lose the ability to shelter behind Amalthea and begin to take damage from bolides.Exactly how much damage depended on how thick and fast the rocks were coming in, and what the distribution of sizes wasanother one of those questions of colossal import that couldnt be answered until the Hard Rain had actually started and data had been gathered.And, so far, the data were too thin to make any real determination.With a few spectacular exceptions, bolide impacts and casualties had been light.But this didnt mean it would remain thus.The White Sky was an ever changing phenomenon.The explosive uptick in the Bolide Fragmentation Rate that had signaled its onset was still ongoing.The distribution of rock sizes and orbital parameters would continue changing for thousands of years.Trends could be observed, and predictions could be made, but beyond a certain point it was guesswork.At any rate, Markus had rolled the dice on the gambit that they were now executing.If it worked, and they could slow Ymir down enough to mate her with Izzy, then the Big Ride strategy became possible, and the arklets could climb to higher and safer altitudes behind the shelter of Amaltheas metal and Ymirs ice.The one part of that plan that Markus apparently had not considered until now was that the atmosphere was too big.In truth, it wouldnt have made a difference if he had considered it.The crucial decision had been made and executed weeks ago by Sean Probst, when he had laid in a course at L1 and executed the burn that had placed Ymir on its current trajectory.This was an ellipse with a very low perigee.That was a sound idea from an orbital mechanics point of view in that the steam engine would have maximum leverage at that pointit was the natural place to make a burn and effect a transition to a low circular orbit matching Izzys.But, sick and exhausted from his two year odyssey, isolated from the latest scientific discourse by radio failure, Sean might have overlooked the expansion of the atmosphere when making his calculations.Are we going in?Vyacheslav asked.This being a polite euphemism for the scenario where Ymir got so deep, and slowed down so much, that it burned up and became just another streak of blue light against the lambent background of the pyrosphere.We are more likely to skip, I think, Markus said.Meaning that Ymir might bounce off the atmosphere like a flat rock skimming across a pond.With unpredictable results.But I cannot be sure.All I am saying is that this is not going to be the mission plan that Sean had in his mind.It is going to be something else.Something maybe a little more exciting.ANTICIPATING THAT CAMILA MIGHT BE ON HER TOESSHE HAD ALREADY survived one attemptthe gunman had crouched behind the rear of her school bus, sawed off shotgun at the ready, and waited for her to emerge.A narrow stretch of pavement separated the vehicles side door from the entrance of her school, so he didnt have much margin for error.He jumped the gun, as it were, springing out into the open while Camila was still negotiating the descent to the street; the long hem of her burqa was apt to get caught on her foot as it probed for the running board, so she had to take it slowly.The delay saved her life.Alerted by a schoolteacher standing in the buildings doorway, Camila turned back into the bus.Rather than hitting her full in the face, the shotgun blast raked the left side of her jaw, removing eleven teeth, tearing away much of her cheek, and causing massive structural damage to her jaw.Surgeons in Karachi and, later, London had saved most of the functions of her tongue, rebuilt her mandible from pieces of bone carved from her pelvis, and fitted her with a set of artificial teeth.After a world tour raising money for girls education in Afghanistan and the tribal regions of Pakistan, Camila had been granted permanent asylum in Holland.Dutch plastic surgeons, funded by charitable donations from all over the world, had gotten to work repairing the cosmetic damage.This was a long term project that had been interrupted by Camilas selection as one of the Dutch candidates for the Cloud Ark.No one believed that this was a random outcome of the Casting of Lots.Clearly the Dutch authorities had placed their thumb on the scale and seen to it that she was chosen, as a rebuke to some conservative Muslim countries who had refused to nominate female Arkers unless given assurance that arrangements would be made for them to live in orbital purdah.Camila was well suited to serve that symbolic purpose, since she had not adopted Western ways.She dressed conservatively and wore the head scarf and the face veil.She was coy, however, as to whether the purpose of the face veil was submission to the demands of religion or to hide her disfigurement.She had pulled it down several times to display the scars to television cameras, and when she had dined at the White House she had gone uncovered in the dining room, by prearrangement with her hostess, the president of the United States.Julias startling arrival in the Cloud Ark had therefore led to a reunion between the forty four year old ex president and the eighteen year old refugee.To call it joyous or even happy would have been wrong given the circumstances.It was a fact of human nature, though, that some people just got on well with each other.This had clearly been the case during that dinner at the White House and was no less true in Camilas abode, Arklet 174, which was where Julia ended up lodging after she had recovered from her eventful flight up and gone through a bit of basic training in how to live in space.Arklet 174 belonged to a heptad, or a cluster of seven arklets all connected to a hexagonal frame; it and five other arklets surrounded a seventh, which was positioned in the middle of the hexagon, where it served as a twenty four hour a day common room and working area for the people who lived in the others.Four to five people were assigned to each of those, and two more had been shoehorned into small private cabins at the boiler room end of the central arklet, so the total population of the heptad, including Julia, was twenty nine.This increased to thirty when Spencer Grindstaff managed to hitch a ride on a Flivver that was bringing a spare part and a technician from Izzy to fix a problem in one of the arklets thrusters.The technician returned to Izzy when he was finished, but Spencer stayed, and talked his way into a berth on Arklet 215.There was a tendency for arklets within a group to become segregated by sex over time, as the populations sorted themselves out; 215, which was predominantly male, ran on the same shift as 174, which was all female.They both ran on second shift, which, for reasons that were now purely historical, tended to be culturally American.They slept from dot 8 to dot 16.First shift was Asian and third shift was European.The cultural shadings were perpetuated by food: the warm odors that greeted ones nostrils upon entering the common space first thing in the morning, the tastes one could expect to savor in the evening.Since space food was lacking in variety, this was largely a matter of spices.The second shifters had their little bottles of Tabasco, the first shifters had plastic packets of curry powder, and so on.Ganging was the term used by the Arkitects to denote this clustering of arklets into formations of three or seven: triads and heptads.It helped simplify Parambulators job by reducing the total number of separate objects that needed to be tracked.It gave Arkies more living space to roam around in, and provided some redundancy in the case of a bolide strike.They didnt like to form anything larger than a heptad, though.Spencer, I am fully aware that I am out of my depth here, Julia said, but I dont understand the upper limit of seven.I was assured, during my early briefings, that any number of arklets could in principle be ganged.Limiting it to seven seems arbitrary.Which suggests that some deeper agenda might be behind it.One moment please, Madam President, Spencer said.He was doing rather a lot of typing.You really shouldnt call me that, Julia returned, though her tone of voice was indulgent.Spencer smacked his laptops Enter key, then leaned back slightly and adjusted his glasses.His eyes jumped around to various parts of the screen.Then he looked up, and, in a clearer tone of voice, announced, Its all shut down.The surveillance, you mean.Situational Awareness Network, he corrected her, and winked.Surveillance to you and me.Its like living in the Nixon White House.Old reference.You wouldnt understand.Now, where was I?Camila knew.She hadnt taken her eyes off Julia the whole time; she was on top of it.The agenda behind the seven arklet limit?Yes, thank you, Camila.I dont buy their arguments.To me it feels, rather, like a way of atomizing the population.Keeping the Arkies from cohering into their own politya polity that might serve as a wholesome and desirable counterweight to the central dominance of the power structure on Izzy.Speaking of which, Spencer, I want to say how much I appreciate the work you have done in ...managing things ...on the IT front.As just now.Giving us the freedom to talk among ourselves without the SAN recording our every word and gesture.Spencer nodded as if to say all in a days work.It was dot 18, the beginning of the workday for second shifters.They were in Arklet 215, home to Spencer, three other men, and a woman.The others had gone to breakfast in the common area, to exercise, or to work.Spencer, Julia, and Camila had been joined by a guest: Zeke Petersen, who had arrived by space suit and was still clad in his thermal coverall.He looked mildly agog.Sensing this, Julia turned toward him with a smile.Major Petersen, she said, it is so good you were able to join us.Though I am new to space, I have some understanding of how difficult it is to simply drop by and say hello, as it were.Well, technically I am no longer a major, since that would imply the existence of a military, Zeke said, but if we are going to use extinct titles as a courtesy, then Ill just thank you for your hospitality, Madam President.Madam President was a little while parsing that and wasnt sure if she liked it.Nervous at the silence, Zeke went on: Ill apologize in advance that I cant stay for very long.Im here with a specific job to do, and once its done, I need to move on.Inspecting Arklet 174 for possible damage from a microbolide strike, Julia said.Yes, maam.I called it in yesterday.I could have sworn I heard a loud banging noise.It scared me to death.But there doesnt seem to be any damage.And the more time goes by the more I wonder if I just imagined it.Space is a noisy environment.I hadnt expected that.The thrusters are so loud when they come on.Maybe it was nothing more than that.I would feel so embarrassed if I summoned you all the way out here to no purpose.Summoned me?Zeke asked, a little bewildered.The Incident Report System is an automatic queue; the assignments are handed out at random.Julia exchanged a mischievous look with Spencer.You and Spencer have been together on Izzy for more than two years, she said.Im sure youve come to appreciate his skillsas have I.  Zeke looked just a bit queasy.So you got in and manipulated the queue?Old habits die hard, Julia said.Im accustomed to working with people I know and trust.If an inspection of my arklet is required, and someone has to do it, then why not have that someone be a person I have met before?Since the assignments are handed out at random, as you say, it might as well be you.Well, Zeke said, since you put it that way, Im glad to be able to catch up with you for a few minutes, Madam President.Just saying that Ill have to complete the full inspection anyway, so we can close the loop on your report.Of course, and Ill bet it will go quickly, Julia answered with a wink.Zeke, you are a member of the General Population, are you not?Of course, Zeke said.As an original member of the ISS crew, thats naturally ...but then his eyes strayed toward Spencer and his voice trailed off.Julia smiled.An awkward topic has come up, and its best to face it with absolute transparency.Despite being a longtime, trusted member of the ISS crew, Spencer here has been removed from the General Population and demoted to the status of an Arkie.I wouldnt look at it as a demotion, Zeke began.Julia silenced him with a dismissive fluttering of the fingers.These were still manicured.Camila had been doing her nails for her.We all know it was a demotion.Markus sprang it on Spencer when he got news of the Eight Ball and saw what was coming.Oh yes, Ive been filled in on all of the carefully laid plans that Markus set into motion when his sweetheart so conveniently gave him the news.Had word of it reached us at the White House, I dont know how I would have reactedbut we were busy protecting Kourou, and supporting Markus as best we knew how.Spencer here, after all those years of patient service, was replaced by that hacker boy Steve Lake?Zeke asked.Julias eyes darted to Camila, who nodded.Yes, Julia said, Steve Lake.I guess hes quite clever, but obviously no competition for Spencer.Are they in competition?Zeke asked.In a sense yes, when we Arkies are exposed to the all seeing eye of SAN, and the GPop is permitted to have some semblance of privacy.It depends on where you are in the space station, Zeke began, but then trailed off.I wouldnt know, since Ive been permitted to spend very little time there.Oh, I know the official justification.Im not qualified to be a member of the GPop.By process of elimination, that makes me an Arkie.Fine.But that doesnt mean I cant maintain a degree of social connection with old friends who are so privileged.Julia reached out and clasped Zekes hand briefly.To be sure, Zeke said, and I think that as time goes on those two populations will cease to be thought of as separate groups.I know that is the official dogma, Julia said, amused.But most of that social interaction is not going to be through face to face visits.So Im told.Hard to envision how the populations will merge as long as that is the case.Most of it is going to be happening through Spacebook and Scape and whatnot, Zeke went on, referring to the Cloud Ark versions of popular Internet communication apps.At least until Until we all ascend into heaven and live happily ever after as one big friendly Ark, Julia said.Zeke, you know space operations better than anyone.What is your opinion of the strategy that Markus has been foisting on us?The Big Ride?Even the name seems a bit suggestive, doesnt it, of ...I dont know what.She exchanged a look with Camila, who giggled at the witticism.Zeke looked around.You dont need to worry about that, Julia reassured him.About what?Markuss surveillance network.SAN?I wasnt worried about it, Zeke protested.Just thinking.About what, pray tell?Major Petersen, all kidding aside, I really am quite keen to hear your opinions as an expert.To tell you the truth, Im thinking about how thin the walls of this pressure hull are, Zeke said.When you called in that bolide strike yesterday, you sounded pretty alarmedI heard the message.Well, you had every reason to be alarmed.I do this for a living nowI go out and inspect these craters, big and small, that are piling up on our equipment.I patch holes, repair stuff thats broken, and twice now Ive had to handle fatalities.Its no joke.If Markus sees an opportunity for us to ascend into heaven, as you put it, behind the shelter of Amalthea, well, I think its worth a try.Is Amalthea going to shelter us from the thickening atmosphere?Camila here has been reading the technical reports for me, which Spencer has been so good as to download from the server.She tells me its quite serious.The expansion of the atmosphere?Its damn serious, Zeke said.But Izzys ballistic coefficient, with Amalthea attached, is huge.She can plow through some pretty thick air, and the rock will absorb all the heat.And arklets can ride along in her wake, like bicyclists drafting behind a truck.All of the arklets?Zeke swallowed.No.She doesnt make a big enough bow wave to shield all of the arklets.Unless they fly so close together that Parambulator goes nuts.This is the part of Markuss plan that I cant understand, Julia said.What is to happen to all of the arklets that are not afforded the privilege of nestling into Amaltheas wake?I dont know all the details of the plan, Zeke said.It is fluid.Meaning, its not really a plan, Julia said.It depends on when Ymir gets back.What kind of condition shes in.How much ice she has.Then well make a plan.And is that to be a dictatorial process?Under the, whatever its calledthe martial law thing?PSAPS, Camila said.Zeke shrugged.I dont think Markus is going to put it up for a vote.Hell get together with his brain trust and theyll decide.Why bother consulting the brain trust?Julia asked, as if the idea were a fascinating novelty.To bring in different perspectives ...make sure theyre not missing anything.Are there any Arkies in this brain trust, or are we expected to meekly accept its verdict?Zeke was flummoxed.Had he been given the ability to rewind and replay the conversation, he would see that hed been outmaneuvered.Lacking that perspective, he was tongue tied for now.Julia wasnt.I ask only because Ive been getting to know a lot of Arkies.I have nothing else to do.No duties.No applicable skills.I find that many of them crave a bit of society.Its a natural human need, just as much as sleep and exercise.So I talk to themin person here on our little heptad, or through the channels you mentioned, the Spacebook and the Scape.These young people find it at least a novelty to have a conversation with a lonely and bored ex president.My point being, Major Petersen, that our system worked.The Casting of Lots and the training camps produced the brightest collection of young talent it has ever been my privilege to encounter.They are brimming over with energy and ideas.These are the scarcest resources in our universe right nowscarcer than water, scarcer than living space.And as such Id consider it a shame if their energy was wasted and their ideas were not taken into account by whatever smoke filled room Markus assembles to make his planassuming he even survives what sounds to me like a somewhat harebrained endeavor.THE CREW OF THE ORIGINAL JAMES CAIRD HAD USED CELESTIAL NAVIGATION to find their way across hundreds of leagues of stormy seas to the coast of South Georgia Island.The crew of the New Caird would have to do something similar.It was easier for them.The navigator on James Caird had had no choice but to await breaks in the ever present cloud cover and snatch observations when he could, comparing them against a mechanical chronometer that he hoped was still telling true time.New Caird had better timepieces and a better view of the sky.In place of a sextant, they had a device consisting of a wide angle lens and a high resolution image sensor that could tell what direction it was aimed in just by comparing what it saw to an astronomical database stored in its memory.So they knew precisely how they were oriented in space, and how that orientation was shifting as the giant shard of ice to which they were attached progressed through the inexorable mathematics of its long ellipse.That, combined with direct measurements of Earths position, enabled Markus to calculate the parameters of their orbit and to reckon, with precision that grew each time he rechecked the figures, exactly how low they were going to go.Whenever Izzy was on their side of the planet, which was about half the time, they were able to get the latest figures from Doob concerning the expansion of the atmosphere.It was in combining those two sets of figures that pure Newtonian mechanics began to break down.For, in a traditional calculation of a space vehicles trajectory, one assumed no atmosphere and no extraneous forces resulting from it.But there was now no denying that Ymir would be going low enough to scrape the air.At a minimum, this meant it would experience some drag that would throw it off the course that Sean Probst had laid in.As these things went, drag wasnt that difficult to calculate.Its effect on their course could be estimated.But because the ice shard wasnt a symmetrical body, coming in straight, it was also going to generate some lift.Not a lot of liftnothing like an airplane wingbut some.If that lift got aimed in the wrong direction it would make Ymir veer downward, like a stricken airplane going into its death spiral.But if they aimed it up, it would ease their passage by pushing them away from the Earth into an altitude where air was thinner.They would lose the benefit of lift then and drift back downward, but as the air got thicker, the lift would resume and push them back up.They might skip off the atmosphere several times during the hectic half hour when they were slingshotting around the world.The results would have been difficult to predict even if Ymir had been a traditional vehicle with a fixed and regular shape.But the shard was irregular.They didnt have time to measure it and to feed the data into an aerodynamics simulator, so they could only guess how much lift it was going to produce.And when its leading edge and its underside began to plow through the aireven though the air might be so thin as to be indistinguishable, for most purposes, from a vacuumit was going to heat up.Steam would rise from it, producing some amount of upward thrust, and its shape would change.So even if they had been able to simulate the shards aerodynamics, its lift and its drag, those numbers would quickly have become wrong during its first encounter with the upper air.Compared with all of those complexities, the fact that Ymir would be flying backward while operating a damaged, experimental nuclear propulsion system at maximum power seemed like a mere detail.Faced with so many imponderables, a well managed aerospace engineering project would have called a halt to all further work and devoted several years to analyzing the problem down to its minutest detail, exposing pieces of ice to the blast of hypersonic wind tunnels, building simulations, and war gaming possible alternative strategies.But by the time Markus understood the general shape of the problem, they had twenty four hours remaining to perigee.The tangerine Earth had grown to the size of an orange.No power wielded by humans could prevent Ymir from passing around it and scraping the atmosphere.They couldnt even ditch.New Caird, detached from Ymir, didnt have enough propellant in her tanks to materially change her course and would end up going on the same ride anyway.So Markus made a reasonable guess as to what would be a good angle of attackthe orientation that Ymir would adopt vis  vis the atmosphereand initiated a program of thruster firings that, over the course of half a day, swung the ponderous shard around into the position he deemed best.Ymirs stern was now aimed in the direction of movement, the huge mouth of the nozzle aimed forward so that it could make the all important braking burn.But she was now twisted about her long axis in such a way that New Caird, still docked up near the bow, and projecting from the side of the shard at approximately a right angle, was on the zenith.This meant that during the passage of the high atmosphere her view of the Earth below would be blocked by Ymir, the nozzle of her engine pointed up toward the stars.Firing that engine would therefore tend to rotate the bow downward and the stern up, an attitude likely to produce more lift and help get Ymir out of trouble.Were the shard to tumble the other direction, it could end up in a position that would yield much more drag and much less lift, pulling the whole contraption deep into the atmosphere.In effect New Caird had been reduced to the status of a small attitude control thruster.It was a thruster that could only push in one direction, and so Markus had picked out the direction most likely to be useful if things began to go sideways.Vyacheslav would ride it out in New Cairds pilots seat, from which he would enjoy an arms length, tunnel vision view of some dirty, five billion year old ice.He would wait for a verbal command from Markus, ensconced in Ymirs common room, to fire New Cairds main propulsion if needed.All of this was mere background noise to Dinah, who was entirely consumed with coordinating the efforts of robots.The number of Nats was in the tens of thousands.They could only be talked to collectively, as swarms.Trying to address and control them one by one, while theoretically possible, was a mugs game.Their general task was to morph the shard.One swarm would be working on the inner surface of the nozzle bell.At the moment, all of those were out on the back end of the shard, sunning themselves to build up their internal reserves of power.At a signal from Dinah they would all converge on the circular maw of the nozzle, climb down into the bell, and spread out to reshape it as needed during the burn.Theyd be running a program that Larz had developed and tweaked.So all Dinah really needed to do was to turn them on.Likewise, the smallest of the three swarms was down inside the ice hoppers, running Larzs program for keeping rocks away from the augers.Working in the dark, these had to sip power from electrical taps that Ymirs crew had installed for that purpose.The largest of the three swarms, though, was responsible for sculpting the interior of the big shard as it was hollowed out.By the time the journey to Izzy was finished, most of the ice would have been fed into the hoppers and blown out the nozzle, leaving a hollowed out shell with just enough internal structure to hold the reactor in place and maintain some semblance of a nozzle bell.This was not as crazy as it sounded, for two reasons.First, it was what miners had done since time immemorial.They didnt just hollow out mountains, since that would lead to collapse.They sculpted the mountains into structurally sound architectural systems, complete with pillars, arches, and vaults.This was just that, except that the material was ice, and the forces in general were not as large.Secondly, most of the shards interior was of little consequence from a structural engineering standpoint.There was a reason why airplanes and race cars had been hollow shellsall skin and no bones.Most structural forces were naturally transmitted through the outermost layer of the vehicle, so that was the best place to put the strength.Enough strength on the outside made it possible to leave the inside hollow.Ice, of course, wasnt the best material to work with.It was brittle.But the Ymir expedition had shipped out carrying a large supply of high strength plastic cord, net, fabric, and loose fiber.And during the months that it had been coasting in from Grigg Skjellerup, Larzs robots had been at work converting ice into pykrete.That outer layer of visually black ice was no longer ice per se, but a synthetic material with much better structural properties.Frozen, it could stop bullets.Melted and strained, it would separate into water, artificial fibers, and black crud from the dawn of the solar system.In any case the larger robotsthe Grabbs and the Siwisresponsible for doing most of the heavy material removal on the inside could scrape to within a few meters of that outer skin without compromising Ymirs structure.It was the responsibility of the third Nat swarm to clean up after them and maintain the internal pillars and webs that would keep the reactor and the hoppers suspended in the middle of the hollow shard.This swarm based ice sculpting algorithm had been Larzs invention, and hed had a couple of years in which to perfect it, but Dinah was in charge of it now, and had a lot of learning to do between now and when she became fully responsible for it.Outnumbered by the Nats, but responsible for moving a much larger tonnage of ice, were the hundred or so Grabbs and Siwis, now mostly stationed at the ready around the shards interior.Most of these were general purpose robots with some added on bits that made them good at moving on ice, but there were also half a dozen Leatherface machines: upsized Grabbs with shovel studded chain saws for limbs, made to move a lot of ice in a hurry.These were so good at their jobs that they tended to destroy their surroundings, so they had to move frequently.Each one had to be followed around by an entourage of smaller robots cleaning up its mess and getting it anchored to fresh locations.In theory it was all just a big computer program that, when executed, would smoothly convert the solid hill of ice into something like a walnut with the meat removed: a thick, pockmarked outer shell with an organic internal system of ribs, veins, and webs.As with any other computer program, it might run perfectly when Dinah started it.But it might just as well go sideways, perhaps in a manner that wasnt obvious at first.So situational awareness was going to be a big part of her task.Interesting as it might be to look out the window and watch the Earth screaming by at twenty four thousand miles per hour, she would need to keep her head down, searching through a roar of weak and ambiguous signals for signs that something was going awry.She liked to imagine that her days as a little girl in a mining camp, sitting in front of a radio console trying to pick out Morse code signals from far away, through static and crosstalk, might have prepared her for it in some way.A FEW MINUTES INTO HIS SCAPE CONVERSATION WITH J. B. F. , DOOB realized that, two years ago, he had done his job too well.Hed gone into that meeting at Camp David with the mission of getting the president to understand the exponential breakup of the moon that was going to wipe out life on the Earths surface.Putting on his Doc Dubois hat, he had coined the terms White Sky and Hard Rain as easy to grasp handles on phenomena that, truth be told, were much more complicated.Dr.Harris was now wishing that the late Doc Dubois had never opened his big fat mouth.He was in a corner of the Farm that, since the departure of New Caird, had developed into a sort of bullpen where he and Konrad and some of the other orbital mechanics geeks hung out.The Farm had always operated something like a high school cafeteria, with different cliques habitually sitting in certain areas, and now those choices were hardening, becoming a part of Izzys unwritten procedure manual.Anyway, they had printed out charts and plots representing, in more or less abstract form, everything that they knew about the ongoing development of the lunar debris cloud and what it might mean for the future of the Cloud Ark.The expenditure of paper and printer ink had been somewhat lavish.Two generations from now, if any humans survived, they would look on this heap of documents with some combination of disgust and amazement.Because paper was going to be scarce by then, and they would view its use for such purposes in roughly the same way as Americans of the twenty first century had viewed the use of sperm whale oil to fuel streetlamps.But then life would get better, forests of genetically engineered trees would grow in vast rotating space colonies, paper would become plentiful, and these sad yellowed scraps would be displayed in a museum as evidence of the privations suffered by the Arkers.Assuming they didnt screw it up.Which was really the topic of this Scape call with Julia.She was floating in her arklet.She seemed to have adjusted to zero gee; shed figured out how to pull her hair close to her head, the moon face had abated, she wasnt visibly nauseated.People were drifting to and fro in the background.The only one Doob recognized was Camila.A couple of other kids were doing what looked like work: prodding and massaging their tablets purposefully, looking up from time to time to engage in brief conversations.A South Asian lad, an African girl, another girl who was probably Chinese.Girl, kid, lad, girl.His politically correct superego, cultivated during long years of service in academia, was trying to light up his shame neurons.Doob felt no shamehe was way past thatbut he was struck by just how young the Arkies were, how different they were demographically from the General Population.It gave him a vaguely troubling sense of being out of touch.It had been decades since he had been young, but he had always been one of the cool kids anyway, with a big following on Facebook and Twitter.Now he was stuck on Izzy and Julia was stuck in an arklet.The two of them were hanging out with completely different populations.GPoppers saw each other all the time and talked face to face.Arkies were isolated in their arklets and had to use social media to reach out.Doob hadnt looked at his Spacebook page since the White Sky, and this call with Julia had been delayed for fifteen minutes while hed tried to figure out the user interface on Scapesomething with which Julia was obviously familiar and comfortable.She used it all the time, and if it didnt work, one of those kids in the background would help her with it.Another straw in the wind: while Doob had been fumbling with Scape, he had overheard a brief snatch of conversation from the other end in which the South Asian kid had addressed Julia as Madam President.This seemed so odd that he was tempted to bring it up in conversation.But he knew what the answer would be: It was just a courtesy.Former presidents were always addressed thus.It didnt mean anything.Why was he making a big deal about it?He would come off as some combination of uncouth and comically hypersensitive.Dr.Harris, as you know, Im something of a fifth wheel around here, and so I want you to know I appreciate your taking any time at all out of whatever it is you are busy with to touch base, Julia began.Not at all, Madam ...Julia, Doob said, and then, because this was a video connection, resisted the urge to slap himself.She found that interesting but decided to overlook it.I feel like a camp counselor here, she said.Of course, I was on top of every detail of the Arkitects work during the run up.But to sit in the White House looking at PowerPoints is one thing.Actually to be here is quite another.This was quite obviously bait.Fully aware of what a sucker he was being, Doob said, How so?Well, of course the range of cultural perspectives is vast, Julia said, but, modulo that, I find a lot of uncertainty.A sense that all of the Arkies talents and energies are bottled uplike so many genies just waiting for someone to rub the lantern.They all so keenly want to help.It is, of course, less than two weeks since the Hard Rain began, Doob pointed out.We have five thousand or so years left to go.The Arkie Community is well aware of those numbers, Julia remarked.The Arkie Community.Wow.He had to admire the way shed slipped that in.Julia, whats the purpose of this call?Am I to understand that whatever answers I give you will then be somehow disseminated to the Arkie Community?Because we have an email list for such purposes.An email list that includes every living human being.That list was most recently used two days ago.An eternity for bottled up Arkies.We have been just a tad busy with the New Caird expedition.There is a lot of curiosity about that in the Arkie Community.Theres a lot of curiosity about it here.I mean about its purpose, Julia said.How could its purpose be any clearer?Doob asked.Anyone who made it through the screening and the training required to become an Arkiewhich doesnt include you, Juliawill understand exactly what we are trying to do from an orbital mechanics standpoint.Obtain the stupendous amount of water that will have to be expended in order to attempt the Big Ride gambit, Julia said.Yes, Dr.Harris, even I understand that.Gambit?Really?Do representatives of the GPop ever make much of an effort to reach out and acquaint themselves with the thoughts and perceptions of the AC?Julia asked.The what?The Arkie Community, Julia explained, with the slightest roll of her eyes.At any given time, about ten percent of the Arkies are rotating through Izzy.You know this.It is the largest number we can accommodate.Ive talked to several who have experienced that rotation.They all report the same thing.As soon as one enters the privileged environment of Izzy, with safer conditions, more room to move about, better food, and greater exposure to senior staff, the GPop worldview seems so sensible.Which only accentuates the reentry shock upon being deposited back into ones arklet.Doob bit his tongue.Julia continued.What about reversing the roles a littlesending members of the GPop on temporary home stays in randomly selected arklets?What about it?Doob asked.What purpose would it really serve?From a purely technocratic standpoint, perhaps none whatsoever, Julia said.And left the rest of her thought unsaid.If I went on a home stay in a random arklet, what would I learn that I cant learn from Scape or Spacebook?A great deal, since you dont actually use those applications, said Julia, her voice deepening in amusement.Im a little busy trying to get New Caird home.Go ahead, tell me.What am I missing?Movement caught his eye across the table.He looked up to see Luisa shaking her head.Then Luisa clamped her face between her palms, closed her eyes for a moment, and opened them again.Doob felt his face warming, and once again resisted the temptation to slap himself.There is a lot of ferment in the AC around alternative strategies, Julia said, speaking briskly and authoritatively, as befit a woman who had just been anointed the spokesperson for said Arkie Community.A fascinating school of thought is developing around the idea of making a passage through clean space to Mars.Clean space?Oh, I forget you havent been following the relevant discussion groups.Clean space is just what Tav has been calling the translunar zone, relatively free of bolides.Tav?Tavistock Prowse?Yes, you should have a look at your old friends blog occasionally.Tav had been sent up to Izzy a month before the White Sky, when someone on the ground had decided that social media was going to be the glue that would hold the Cloud Ark together and that Tav was just the man for that sort of thing.Ive been busy, Doob said.But Tav ought to know that we have simulated and war gamed the Mars option to within an inch of its life, and its just not a good idea.He could see Julia formulating an objection that he didnt have the patience to listen to.Anyone who is seriously advocating we go to Mars is He didnt want to say what he was thinking, which was smoking crack, and so he settled for not taking some of the practical realities into account.One solar flare at the wrong time could kill everyone.Only if everyone goes.If youre talking about just sending a contingent to Mars, then you have to consider how much of our equipment and supplies theyll be allowed to take with them.I think many talented Arkies would volunteer to be part of a small, lean advance party.The lure of clean space is strong.Well, we are not in what I guess Tav considers clean space, Doob said.We are in dirty space, and we have to focus on that reality, rather than woolgathering about trips to the Red Planet.You neednt remind me, Julia began.Yes.You saw your friend and colleague Pete Starling get chowdered by a bolide.I did actually see your Spacebook post about that, Julia.It was most affecting.I sense a but coming, however.As the days go by without a serious incident, people begin to wonder how dirty space really is.Interest grows in the Dump and Run option.The White Sky now feels like ancient history.The Hard Rain is upon us.Every day brings a course correction or two, to avoid a major bolide, and a litany of minor events.But the death toll stands at Eighteen, as of ten minutes ago, Doob said.We just lost Arklet 52.See, I am keeping my ear to the ground.I am sorry to hear that, Julia said, and Ill bet the rest of the AC will feel the same way, once that news has been distributed to them.Its on a fucking spreadsheet, Julia.All you have to do is look at it.We dont distribute news.This is not the White House.But in many respects it behaves like the White House, Julia said.An orbiting White House unfettered by constitutional checks and balances.But at least the White House had a briefing room, a way of reaching out.I would be happy to ...Why are you even talking to me about this?Doob asked.Im a fucking astronomer.Then, a thought.How many conversations like this one have you been having with other members of the GPop?Hed been assuming that Julia had singled him out as special, but for all he knew she had a call list as long as her arm, organized by those assiduous youngsters in the background.Ivy is temporarily in charge.I am familiar with the chain of command that has been improvised, Julia returned.To answer your question, Dr.Harris, I am talking to you precisely because you are an astronomer, and well positioned to answer the questions and concerns among the AC about the exact nature of the dirty space threat.This news from Arklet 52 is going to raise questions about the effectiveness of Ivys current strategy.It is a statistical problem, Doob said.On about A+0.7 it stopped being a Newtonian mechanics problem and turned into statistics.It has been statistics ever since.And it all boils down to the distribution of bolide sizes, and of the orbits in which they are moving, and how those distributions are changing over timewhich we can only know from observation and extrapolation.And you know what, Julia?Even if we had perfect knowledge of every single one of those statistical parameters, we still wouldnt be able to predict the future.Because we have an n of 1.Only one Cloud Ark, only one Izzy to work with.We cant run this experiment a thousand times to see the range of different outcomes.We can only run it once.The human mind has trouble with situations like that.We see patterns where they dont exist, we find meaning in randomness.A minute ago you were casting doubt on whether dirty space was really that dirty at allobviously arguing in favor of Dump and Run.Then I told you about what just happened to Arklet 52 and now youre swinging around to the other point of view.You are not helping, Julia.You are not helping.Julia did not look to be accepting Doobs remarks in the spirit intended.Instead she squinted through the screen at him and shook her head slightly.I dont understand the intensity of your reaction, Dr.Harris.This conversation is over, Doob said, and hung up on her.He then fought off a temptation to slam the tablet down on the table.Instead he sat back in his chair and looked Luisa in the eye for the first time in a while.On one level hed wanted to watch her face the whole time.But Julia would have noticed that, would have figured out that someone else was in the room, silently listening.Just as someone had probably been doing at Julias end.Luisa just sat there in her listening shrink mode.It would be easier, Doob said, if I could figure out what the hell she wanted.Youre assuming, Luisa said, that she has a plan.I doubt that she does.She is driven to seek power.She finds some way to do that and then backfills a rationalization for it afterward.Doob pulled his tablet closer and started trying to find Tavs blog.To what extent do you imagine she really is reporting facts about the AC?As opposed to creating the reality she describes?Doob asked.Whats the difference?Luisa asked.DINAH LOOKED UP AND SAW THAT THE EARTH WAS THE SIZE OF A grapefruit.She took a nap, ate some food, and buckled down to work again, then looked up to see that it was the size of a basketball.Still not that big; and yet such was their speed that it was only an hour away.They had a final briefing session in Ymirs common room, which had become a makeshift bridge for this ungainly ship.Dinah had scrounged three flat panel monitors from various parts of the command module and zip tied them to the common room table.These were covered with overlapping windows of various sizes.Some were terminal windows showing log entries or editors showing code, but most were video feeds showing different robots points of view on the mining operation.Only one of them looked outward: shed positioned a redundant Siwi on the stern, toward the nadir, and aimed its camera at Earth.Other than that, her only situational awareness would come from a celestial navigation program that would display, in a small window, a three dimensional rendering of the Earth with Ymirs trajectory superimposed on it as a geometric curve.Along the bottom of that window was a series of graphs plotting velocity and altitude versus time.Their velocity at the moment was some six thousand meters per second, up from four thousand just a couple of hours ago; within the next hour it would double if they took no action, then begin to drop again as they left perigee behind and coasted away into space.That velocity would take them all the way back out to L1 again unless Jiro succeeded at his task, which was to slow them down.He had satisfied himself with but a single flat panel screen, which hed set up directly across the table from Dinahs triptych.From here he would be managing the reactor.He had already begun to pull some of the control blades, just to get a sense of how quickly it would come to full power when he did it for real.A miscalculation on that front had led to the fuel rod breach that had indirectly killed Sean, and Jiro didnt want any surprises this time around.Some minutes before perigee, if Markus felt that things were otherwise going to plan, Jiro would issue commands that would bring the reactor up to its full thermal power output of about four gigawatts.Ice would melt to superheated water, and steam would howl through the Inconel throat of the nozzle, expanding and cooling in the bell until it turned into a hypersonic blizzard, a white lance of cold fire pushing against the great ships movement, slowing her down.Not so much as to let her fall into the atmosphere and die, but enough to reduce her orbit to something more like Izzys.Ymir would experience acceleration, which would feel to its inhabitants like gravity.All the stuff that was now floating around loose aboard Ymir and New Caird would fall down.Dinah and Jiro would drop into the chairs that theyd positioned in front of their monitors.So would Markus, for he had built his own nest of tablets and monitors at the head of the table, mostly occupied with navigational data.Up in New Caird, Slava would find himself pressed into his acceleration couch at an awkward sideways angle.The gee forces would be modest enougheven a four gigawatt nuclear propulsion system could only exert so much force against the momentum of such a large chunk of ice.If their weight remained steady over time, it was a sign that things were going well.If it increased, it probably meant that they were going to die.For the only thing that could slow them down and increase their perceived weight beyond a certain level was contact with the atmosphere.The more they slowed down, the lower they dropped.The lower they dropped, the thicker the air got.The thicker the air got, the more force it exerted on the ship.They would read this as a sense of increased weight.It was an exponential spiral that, beyond a certain point, would lead to the inevitable destruction of Ymir, New Caird, and everyone on board.The only real question would be the manner of their death.In a smaller, lighter craft they might be burned alive.Here, being surrounded by ice, it was more likely that they would lose consciousness from the gee forces firsta relatively painless way to go.Dubois Harris and Konrad Barth, gazing down on them from a few hundred kilometers above, would see them go out as a blue streak over the southern hemisphere, and would give the news to Ivy so that she could issue a statement to the Cloud Ark that, if Dinah was any judge of her friend, she had already written, just in case she needed it.It was strange to be so close to them in distance, but so far away in the nonintuitive space of delta vees.Bandwidth between New Caird and Izzy was excellent now, and Dinah had to make a conscious effort not to get distracted by the availability of text messaging and even Spacebook.See you in a few xoxo, Ivy had texted her, and Dinah had sent back something in the same vein, then closed the window.Vyacheslav was donning one of the blue thermal garments worn beneath space suits.This, she knew, was just a precaution, in case he had to go outside on short notice for some reason.Slava had stationed his space suit in New Cairds airlock, so that he could exit to the outside of the shard if needed, and Dinah had pre positioned two Grabbs there, to help him get around.Markus could be pretty unceremonious about things, which was just his leadership stylehis way of implicitly telling people he expected them to do their bloody jobs without pep talks beforehand or congratulations afterward.It didnt work for everyone.Some people liked ceremony.But he hadnt invited any of those along on this expedition.So there was no particular moment when it all started.They just kept getting closer to the Earth.Slava darted up the companionway to the top of the command module, and a minute later announced that he was positioned before the controls of New Caird.Jiro called out milestones in the startup of the reactor, occasionally proffering hints as to how the figures should be understood: That is a little faster than I expected ...settling down now ...this is according to plan ...ready to proceed on your command ...and so on.Markuss participation consisted largely of chewing his thumbnail while staring fixedly at his screen.From time to time he would reach out and type something, or swipe and tap on his tablet.Dinahs work was almost entirely abstract, several layers removed from what obviously mattered.She tried to focus on it and to ignore the sounds of a thousand loose objects settling to the floor of Ymir as gravity came on due to a combination of Ymirs increasing thrust and the steady buildup of atmospheric pushback.Now, Markus said.Acknowledged, Jiro responded.Control blades are responding to program ...and ...we have criticality.Four gigawatts of thermal powerenough to supply Las Vegascame online in the next few seconds.Dinah felt it as a massive increase in weight and heard it as a cacophony of creaks, groans, and crashing noises as the command module, and the ice surrounding it, came under structural load.She saw it on her screens as sudden and frantic change in windows that had remained frustratingly static for the last hours.The ice hoppers, which had been brimful for weeks, began to empty at a shocking pace as the augers spun.A couple of her point of view robots fell or skidded from their points of anchorage, events that showed up as sudden and unhelpful shifts in camera angle.She hit go on a program that tasked every robot in the shard to deliver more ice into the hoppers as fast as possible, and tried to keep one eye on that while monitoring the structural integrity of the shard as a whole.In the traditional scheme of things, miners had done all their work under gravity, so structural mistakes had manifested themselves soon, and dramatically, as cave ins.Ymir was a mine that had been slowly delved under zero gee and only subjected to gravity for short periods when the engine came on, and so there was a certain nervous feeling of not knowing whether it might all collapse.So far, it looked fine.We are losing velocity nicely, Markus muttered through what was left of his thumbnail, and Dinah permitted herself a glance at the graphs to verify that this was so.Time had gone by faster than she had known; they were just minutes away from perigee.Nicely in Markuss phrasing meant enough to make a difference but not so much as to kill us.Then Markus said, Slava.A three second burn, please.Da, answered the Russian.Then, a few seconds later, he said, It is beginning.They wouldnt have known Slava was doing anything, save for an external camera that Dinah had positioned on the surface of the shard at some distance from New Caird, looking back at it.This showed a ghostly blue flare emerging from the small ships nozzle bell, shoving Ymirs nose down and swinging its stern up slightly.Ymir shuddered faintly.Dinah didnt know what to make of it.She feared it might be a cave in until she identified it as a sensation she had never expected to feel again: atmospheric buffeting.She had not been this close to the surface of the Earth since shed been launched into orbit almost a year before Zero.And if the next few minutes went well, shed never be this close again.The shuddering didnt last.The graphs on her screen had all picked up little wiggles that were steadily receding into the past.We skipped, Markus said.I think we will do it at least one more time.Augers four and eleven are down, Jiro announced.I will try reversing them to clear the jam.This brought Dinahs attention back.At a glance she checked all of the levels in the hoppers and saw them dropping quickly, as expected, despite the robots efforts to replenish them.The two that Jiro had identified were overfull, since there was no way to get the ice out of them.Dinah activated a subprogram that would put some Grabbs to work transferring surplus ice from hoppers 4 and 11 to nearby ones that could use it.The Caird burn worked, Markus said, but it gave us a little too much rotation.I am counteracting using thrustersand this will take a little while.He entered some commands that, presumably, turned on those of Ymirs attitude thrusters that pushed in the opposite direction from New Cairds big engine.By the way, we just passed through perigeeI hope.Dinah glanced at the plots and saw that they had indeed passed the midway point of the maneuver.Somewhat paradoxically, though, their altitude was droppingheaded for their second, and hopefully their last, skip off the atmosphere.Were on some weird new course now, she said.It is true, Markus said.If we survive the next few minutes, we can fix it later.Auger eleven works again, Jiro reported, but two and three are down.We may have a critical propellant shortage.Damned thrusters are not powerful enough.We have overcorrected, Markus said, and now we are coming in for another skip.We are flying not only backward but upside down.So the burn from New Cairds engine had done its job.It had depressed the ships nose, which was pointed backward, and prevented the stern, currently pointed forward, from digging in.Theyd grazed the atmosphere with the shards broad side and gotten a nice skip out of ita bounce that mightve saved their lives.But once the shard began to rotate, it was difficult to make it stop, and now it had gone too far.The nose was pointed too steeply downward, the nozzle bell was aimed up toward space.So were thrusting down toward the planet now?Dinah asked.Not enough to hurt us.Maintain thrust, Markus ordered.I am running out of ice, Jiro said, and glanced over his monitor at Dinah.Dinah had already warned them that supplying enough propellant to do all of this in one huge burn would be a close run thing, assuming everything went perfectly.Everything hadnt.She met Jiros eyes, shook her head, and went back to work.Get ready to shut it down, Jiro, Markus said.We are descending into thick air and I dont know what is going to happen.Their inner ears told them that something was happening.The powerful thrust was still driving them into their seats, but some force had taken Ymir by the nose and was torquing it around.We hit nose first, Markus said, and we are spinning back.Main engine shutdown in three.Two.One.Now.A nuclear steam engine didnt shut off quickly.The thrust faltered and tapered off in response to whatever commands Jiro had entered.It was the better part of a minute, though, before they were back in zero gravitymeaning in a free orbit with no thrust pushing them around.Ill give you our new orbital parameters in a minute, Markus said.It is complicated because we are tumbling.
