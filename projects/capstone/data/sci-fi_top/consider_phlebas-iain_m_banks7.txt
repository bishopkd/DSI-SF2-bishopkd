"You would have told us," Yalson said, "wouldn't you, Horza?I mean you would have let us know eventually. "Horza knew she meant, would he have told her?He put his gun down and looked her in the eyes."Once I was sure," he said, "sure about the people, sure about the ship. "It was the honest answer, but he wasn't certain it was the best one.He wanted Yalson, wanted not just her warmth in the ship's red night, but her trust, her care.But she was still distant.Balveda lived; perhaps she wouldn't still be alive if Horza hadn't wanted Yalson's regard.He knew that, and it was a bitter thought, making him feel cheap and cruel.Even knowing that it was a definite thing would have been better than being uncertain.He couldn't say for sure whether the cold logic of this game dictated that the Culture woman should die or be left alive, or even if, the former being comfortably obvious, he could have killed her in cold blood.He had thought it through and still he didn't know.He only hoped that neither woman had guessed that any of this had gone through his mind.Kierachell was another worry.It was absurd, he knew, to be concerned about his own affairs at such a time, but he couldn't stop thinking about the Changer woman; the closer they came to Schar's World, the more he remembered of her, the more real his memories became.He tried not to build it up too much, tried to recall the boredom of the Changers" lonely outpost on the planet and the restlessness he had felt there even with Kierachell's company, but he dreamt about her slow smile and recalled her low voice in all its fluid grace with some of the heartache of a youth's first love.Occasionally he thought Yalson might sense that, too, and something inside him seemed to shrink with shame.Yalson shrugged, hoisted her gun to her shoulder and fired at a four legged shadow on the practice screen.It stopped in its tracks and dropped, seeming to dissolve into the line of shady ground at the bottom of the screen.Horza gave talks.It made him feel like some visiting lecturer at a college, but that's what he did.He felt he had to explain to the others why he was doing what he was, why the Changers supported the Idirans, why he believed in what they were fighting for.He called them briefings, and ostensibly they were about Schar's World and the Command System, its history, geography and so on, but he always (quite intentionally) ended up talking about the war in general, or about totally different aspects of it unrelated to the planet they were approaching.The briefing cover gave him a good excuse to keep Balveda confined to her cabin while he paced up and down on the deck of the mess talking to the members of the Free Company; he didn't want his talks turning into a debate.Perosteck Balveda had been no trouble.Her suit and a few items of harmless looking jewellery and other bits and pieces had been jettisoned from a vactube.She had been scanned with every item the CAT's limited sick bay equipment could provide and had come up clean, and she seemed quite happy to be a well behaved prisoner, confined to the ship as they all were and, apart from at night, locked in her cabin only occasionally.Horza didn't let her near the bridge, just in case, but Balveda showed no signs of trying to get to know the ship especially well  the way he had done when he came on board.She didn't even try to argue any of the mercenaries round to her way of thinking about the war and the Culture.Horza wondered how secure she felt.Balveda was pleasant and seemed unworried; but he looked at her sometimes and thought he saw, briefly, a glimpse of inner tension, even despair.It relieved him in one way, but in another it gave him that same bad, cruel feeling he experienced when he thought about exactly why the Culture agent was still alive.Sometimes he was simply afraid of getting to Schar's World, but increasingly as the voyage dragged on he came to relish the prospect of some action and an end to thought.He called Balveda to his cabin one day, after they had all eaten in the mess.The woman came in and sat down on the same small seat he had sat in when Kraiklyn had summoned him just after he had joined the ship.Balveda's face was calm.She sat elegantly in the small seat, her long frame at once relaxed and poised.Her deep dark eyes gazed out at Horza from the thin, smoothly shaped head, and her red hair  now turning black  shone in the lights of the cabin."Captain Horza?"she smiled, crossing her long fingered hands on her lap.She wore a long blue gown, the plainest thing she had been able to find on the ship: something that had once belonged to the woman Gow."Hello, Balveda," Horza said.He sat back on the bed.He wore a loose gown.For the first couple of days he had stayed in his suit, but while it stayed commendably comfortable, it was bulky and awkward in the confines of the Clear Air Turbulence, so he had discarded it for the voyage.He was about to offer Balveda something to drink, but somehow, because that was what Kraiklyn had done with him, it didn't seem the right thing to do."What was it," Horza?"Balveda said."I just wanted to see how you were," he said.He had tried to rehearse what he would say; assure her she was in no danger, that he liked her and that he was sure that this time the worst that would happen to her really would be internment somewhere, and maybe a swap, but the words would not come."I'm fine," she said, smoothing her hand over her hair, her eyes glancing around the cabin briefly."I'm trying to be a model captive so you won't have an excuse for ditching me. "She smiled, but again he thought he sensed an edge to the gesture.Yet he was relieved."No," he laughed, letting his head rock back on his shoulders with the laugh."I've no intention of doing that.You're safe. ""Until we get to Schar's World?"she said calmly."After that, too," he said.Balveda blinked slowly, looking down."Hmm, good. "She looked into his eyes.He shrugged."I'm sure you'd do the same for me. ""I think I probably would," she said, and he couldn't tell whether she was lying or not."I just think it's a pity we're on different sides. ""It's a pity we're all on different sides, Balveda. ""Well," she said, clasping her hands on her lap again, "there is a theory that the side we each think we're on is the one that will triumph eventually anyway. ""What's that?"he grinned."Truth and justice?""Not either, really," she smiled, not looking at him."Just" She shrugged."Just life.The evolution you talked about.You said the Culture was in a backwater, a dead end.If we are maybe we'll lose after all. ""Damn, I'll get you on the good guys" side yet, Perosteck," he said, with just a little too much heartiness.She smiled thinly.She opened her mouth to say something, then thought the better of it and closed it again.She looked at her hands.Horza wondered what to say next.One night, six days out from their destination  the system's star was fairly bright in the sky ahead of the ship, even on normal sight  Yalson came to his cabin.He hadn't expected it, and the tap at the door brought him from a state between waking and sleep with a jarring coldness which left him disorientated for a few moments.He saw her on the door screen and let her in.She came in quickly, closing the door after her and hugging him, holding him tight, soundless.He stood there, trying to wake up and work out how this had happened.There seemed to be no reason for it, no build up of tension of any sort between them, no signs, no hints: nothing.Yalson had spent that day in the hangar, wired up with small sensors and exercising.He had seen her there, working away, sweating, exhausting herself, peering at readouts and screens with her critical eyes, as though her body was a machine like the ship and she was testing it almost to destruction.They slept together.But as though to confirm the exertions she had put herself through during the day, Yalson fell asleep almost as soon as they lay down; in his arms, while he was kissing and nuzzling her, breathing in the scent of her body again after what seemed like months.He lay awake and listened to her breathe, felt her move very slightly in his arms, and sensed her blood beat slower and slower as she fell into a deep sleep.In the morning they made love, and afterwards he asked her, while he held her and their sweat dried, "Why?"as their hearts slowed."What changed your mind?"The ship hummed distantly around them.She gripped him, hugging tighter still, and shook her head."Nothing," she said, "nothing in particular, nothing important. "He felt her shrug, and she turned her head away from his face, into his arm, towards the humming bulkhead.In a small voice she said, "Everything; Schar's World. "Three days out, in the hangar, he watched the members of the Free Company work out and practise firing their guns at the screen.Neisin couldn't practise because he still refused to use lasers after what had happened in the Temple of Light.He had stocked up on magazines of micro projectiles during his few sober moments in Evanauth.After firing practice, Horza had each of the mercenaries test their AG harnesses.Kraiklyn had purchased a cheap batch of them and insisted that the Free Company members who didn't already have an anti gravity unit in their suit buy a harness from him, at what he claimed was cost price.Horza had been dubious at first, but the AG units seemed serviceable enough, and certainly might be useful for searching the Command System's deeper shafts.Horza was satisfied that the mercenaries would follow him in if they had to, down into the Command System.The long delay since the excitement of Vavatch, and the boring routine of the life on the Clear Air Turbulence, had made them hanker after something more interesting.As Horza had  honestly  described it, Schar's World didn't sound too bad.At least it was unlikely they would find themselves in a fire fight, and nobody, including the Mind they might end up helping Horza search for, was going to start blowing things up, not with a Dra'Azon to reckon with.The sun of the Schar's World system shone brightly ahead of them now, the brightest thing in the sky.The Glittercliff was not a visible feature of the sky ahead, because they were still inside the spiral limb and looking out, but it was noticeable that all the stars ahead were either quite close or very far away, with none in the gap between.Horza had changed the CAT's course several times, but kept it on a general heading which, unless they turned, wouldn't take it closer than two light years from the planet.He would turn the craft and head in the following day.So far the journey had been uneventful.They had flown through the scattered stars without encountering anything out of the ordinary: no messages or signals, no distant flashes from battles, no warp wakes.The area around them seemed calm and undisturbed, as though all that was happening was what always happened: just the stars being born and dying, the galaxy revolving, the holes twisting, the gases swirling.The war, in that hurried silence, in their false rhythm of day and night, seemed like something they had all imagined, an inexplicable nightmare they had somehow shared, even escaped.Horza had the ship watching, though, ready to alarm at the first hint of trouble.They were unlikely to find out anything before they got to the Quiet Barrier, but if everything was as peaceful and serene as that name implied, he thought he might not go arrowing straight in.Ideally he would like to rendezvous with the Idiran fleet units which were supposed to be waiting near by.That would solve most of his problems.He would hand Balveda over, make sure Yalson and the rest of the mercenaries were safe  let them have the CAT  and pick up the specialised equipment Xoralundra had promised him.That scenario would also let him meet Kierachell alone, without the distraction of the others being there.He would be able to be his old self without making any concessions to the self the Free Company and Yalson knew.Two days out, the ship's alarm went off.Horza was dozing in his bed; he raced out of the cabin and forward to the bridge.In the volume of space before them, all hell seemed to have been let loose.Annihilation light washed over them; it was the radiation from weapon explosions, registering pure and mixed on the vessel's sensors, indicating where warheads had gone off totally by themselves or in contact with something else.The fabric of three dimensional space bucked and juddered with the blast from warp charges, forcing the CAT's automatics to disengage its engines every few seconds to prevent them being damaged on the shock waves.Horza strapped in and brought all the subsidiary systems up.Wubslin came through the door from the mess."What is it?""Battle of some sort," Horza said, watching the screens.The volume of affected space was more or less directly on the inward side of Schar's World; the direct route from Vavatch passed that way.The CAT was one and a half light years away from the disturbance, too far away to be spotted on anything except the narrow beam of a track scanner and therefore almost certainly safe; but Horza watched the distant blasts of radiation, and felt the CAT ride the ripples of disturbed space with a sensation of nausea, even defeat."Message shell," Wubslin said, nodding at a screen.There, sorting itself out from the noise of radiation, a signal gradually appeared, the words forming a few letters at a time like a field of plants growing and flowering.After a few repetitions of the signal  and it was being jammed, not simple interfered with by the battle's background noise  it was complete enough to read.VESSEL CLEAR AIR TURBULENCE.MEET UNITS  NINETY  THIRD FLEET  DESTINATION/S.591134.45 MID.ALL SAFE."Damn," breathed Horza."What's that mean?"Wubslin said.He punched the figures on the screen into the CAT's navigational computer."Oh," the engineer said, sitting back, "it's one of the stars near by.I guess they mean to rendezvous halfway between it and" He looked at the main screen."Yes," Horza said, looking unhappily at the signal.It had to be a fake.There was nothing to prove it was from the Idirans: no message number, code class, ship originator, signatory; nothing genuine at all."That from the guys with three legs?"Wubslin said.He brought a holo display onto another screen, showing stars surrounded by spherical grids of thin green lines."Hey, we're not all that far away from there. ""Is that right?"Horza said.He watched the continuing blasts of battle light.He entered some figures into the CAT's control systems.The vessel brought its nose round, angling it further over towards the Schar's World system.Wubslin looked at Horza."You don't think it is from them?""I don't," Horza said.The radiation was fading.The engagement appeared to be over, or the action broken off."I think we might turn up there and find a GCU waiting for us.Or a cloud of CAM. ""CAM?What  that stuff they dusted Vavatch with?"Wubslin said, and whistled."No thanks. "Horza switched the screen with the message off.Less than an hour later it all happened again: shells of radiation, warp disturbance, and this time two messages, one telling the CAT to ignore the first message, the other giving a new rendezvous point.Both seemed genuine; both were affixed with the word "Xoralundra'.Horza, still chewing the mouthful of food he'd been eating when the alarm went off for the second time, swore.A third message appeared, telling him personally to ignore those two signals and directing the CAT to yet another rendezvous area.Horza shouted with anger, sending bits of soggy food arcing out to hit the message screen.He turned the wide band communicator off completely, then went back to the mess."When do we reach the Quiet Barrier?""A few more hours.Half a day perhaps. ""Are you nervous?""I'm not nervous.I've been there before.How about you?""If you say it'll be all right, I believe you. ""It should be. ""Will you know any of the people there?""I don't know.It's been a few years.They don't rotate personnel often, but people do leave.I don't know.I'll just have to wait and see. ""You haven't seen any of your own people for a long time, have you?""No.Not since I left there. ""Aren't you looking forward to it?""Maybe. ""Horza look, I know I told you we didn't ask each other about about everything before we came aboard the CAT, but that was before a lot of things changed "  "But it's the way we've been, isn't it?""You mean you don't want to talk about it now?""Maybe.I don't know.You want to ask me about "  "No. "She put her hand to his lips.He felt them there in the darkness."No, it's OK.It's all right; never mind. "He sat in the centre seat.Wubslin was in the engineer's chair to Horza's right, Yalson to his left.The rest had crowded in behind them.He had let Balveda watch; there was little that could happen which she could affect now.The drone floated near the ceiling.The Quiet Barrier was coming up.It showed as a mirrorfield directly in front of them, about a light day in diameter.It had suddenly appeared on the screen when they were an hour out from the barrier.Wubslin had worried it was giving their position away, but Horza knew that the mirrorfield existed only in the CAT's sensors.There was nothing there for anybody else to see.Five minutes out, every screen went black.Horza had warned the rest about it, but even he felt anxious and blind when it happened."You're sure this is meant to happen?"Aviger said."I'd be worried if it didn't," Horza told him.The old man moved somewhere behind him."I think this is incredible," Dorolow said."This creature is virtually a god.I'm sure it can sense our moods and thoughts.I can feel it already. ""Actually, it's just a collection of self referencing "  "Balveda," Horza said, looking round at the Culture woman.She stopped talking and clapped a hand over her mouth, flashing her eyes.He turned back to the blank screen."When's this thing " Yalson began.APPROACHING CRAFT, the screen said, in a variety of languages."Here we go," Neisin said.He was shushed by Dorolow."I respond," Horza said, in Marain, into the tight beam communicator.The other languages disappeared from the screen.YOU ARE APPROACHING THE PLANET CALLED SCHAR'S WORLD, DRA'AZON PLANET OF THE DEAD.PROGRESS BEYOND THIS POINT IS RESTRICTED."I know.My name is Bora Horza Gobuchul.I wish to return to Schar's World for a short while.I ask this with all respect. ""Smooth talker," Balveda said.Horza glared briefly at her.The communicator would only transmit what he said, but he didn't want the woman to forget she was a prisoner.YOU HAVE BEEN HERE BEFORE.Horza couldn't tell if this was a question or not."I have been to.Schar's World before," he confirmed."I was one of the Changer sentinels. "There seemed little point in telling the creature when; the Dra'Azon called every time now even though their language used tenses.The screen went blank, then repeated:  YOU HAVE BEEN HERE BEFORE.Horza frowned and wondered what to say.Balveda muttered, "Obviously hopelessly senile. ""I have been here before," Horza said.Did the Dra'Azon mean that because he had already been there he could not return?"I can feel it, I can feel its presence," Dorolow whispered.THERE ARE OTHER HUMANS WITH YOU."Thanks a lot," said the drone, Unaha Closp, from somewhere near the ceiling."You see?"Dorolow said, her voice almost whimpering.Horza heard Balveda snort.Dorolow staggered slightly; Aviger and Neisin had to hold onto her to stop her from falling."I have not been able to set them down elsewhere," Horza said."I ask your indulgence.If need be, they will stay on board this vessel. "THEY ARE NOT SENTINELS.THEY ARE OTHER HUMANOID SPECIES."I alone need alight on Schar's World. "ENTRY IS RESTRICTED.Horza sighed."I alone request permission to land. "WHY HAVE YOU COME HERE?Horza hesitated.He heard Balveda snort quietly.He said, "I seek one who is here. "WHAT DO THE OTHERS SEEK?"They seek nothing.They are with me. "THEY ARE HERE."They" Horza licked his lips.All his rehearsing, all his thoughts about what to say at this moment, seemed to be useless."They are not all here by choice.But I had no alternative.I had to bring them.If you wish, they will stay on board this craft in orbit around Schar's World, or further away inside the Quiet Barrier.I have a suit, I can "  THEY ARE HERE AGAINST THEIR WILL.Horza hadn't known Dra'Azon to interrupt before.He couldn't imagine it was a good sign."The circumstances are complicated.Certain species in the galaxy are at war.Choices become limited.One does things one would not normally do. "THERE IS DEATH HERE.Horza looked at the words written on the screen.He felt transfixed by them.There was silence on the bridge for a moment.Then he heard a couple of people moving awkwardly."What does that mean?"the drone Unaha Closp said."There there is?"Horza said.The words stayed on the screen, written in Marain.Wubslin tapped at a few buttons on his side of the console, buttons which would normally control the display on the screens in front of him, all of which now repeated the words on the main screen.The engineer was sitting in his seat, looking cramped and tense.Horza cleared his throat, then said, "There was a battle, a conflict near by.Just before we got here.It might still be going on.There may be death. "THERE IS DEATH HERE."Oh" Dorolow said, and slumped into Neisin and Aviger's arms."We'd better get her to the mess," Aviger said, looking at Neisin."Let her lie down. ""Oh, all right," Neisin said, glancing quickly at the woman's face.Dorolow appeared to be unconscious."I may be able to" Horza began, then gave a deep breath."If there is death here I may be able to stop it.I may be able to prevent more death. "BORA HORZA GOBUCHUL."Yes?"Horza said, gulping.Aviger and Neisin manhandled Dorolow's limp body out through the doorway into the corridor leading into the mess.The screen changed:  YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THE REFUGEE MACHINE."Ho ho," said Balveda, turning away with a smile on her face and putting one hand to her mouth."Shit!"said Yalson."Looks like our god isn't so stupid," Unaha Closp observed."Yes," Horza said sharply.There seemed little point in trying to pretend now."Yes, I am.But I think "  YOU MAY ENTER."What?"the drone said."Well, ya hoo!"Yalson said, crossing her arms and leaning back against the bulkhead.Neisin came back through the door.He stopped when he saw the screen."That was quick," he said to Yalson."What did he say?"Yalson just shook her head.Horza felt a wave of relief sweep through him.He looked at each word on the screen in turn, as though frightened that the short message could somehow conceal a hidden negation.He smiled and said:  "Thank you.Shall I go down alone to the planet?"YOU MAY ENTER.THERE IS DEATH HERE.BE WARNED."What death?"Horza said.The relief waned; the Dra'Azon's words about death chilled him."Where is there death?Whose?"The screen changed again, the first two lines disappearing.Now it simply said:  BE WARNED."I do not," Unaha Closp said slowly, "like the sound of that at all. "Then the screens were clear.Wubslin sighed and relaxed.The sun of the Schar's World system shone brightly ahead of them, less than a standard light year away.Horza checked the figures on the navigation computer as its screen Bickered back to normality along with the rest, displaying numbers and graphs and holographics.Then the Changer sat back in his seat."We're through all right," he said."We're through the Quiet Barrier. ""So nothing can touch us now, huh?"Neisin said.Horza gazed at the screen, the single yellow dwarf star showing as a bright unwavering spot of light in the centre, planets still invisible.He nodded."Nothing.Nothing outside, anyway. ""Great.Think I'll have a drink to celebrate. "Neisin nodded at Yalson, then swung his thin body out through the doorway."Do you think it meant only you can go down, or all of us?"Yalson asked.Still staring at the screen, Horza shook his head."I don't know.We'll go into orbit, then broadcast to the Changer base shortly before we try taking the CAT in.If Mr Adequate doesn't like it, he'll let us know. ""You've decided it's male, then," said Balveda, just as Yalson said:  "Why not contact them now?""I didn't like that bit about there being death here. "Horza turned towards Yalson.Balveda was at her side; the drone had floated down a little to eye level.Horza looked at Yalson."Just as a precaution.I don't want to give anything away too soon. "He turned his gaze to the Culture woman."Last I heard, the regular transmission was due from the base on Schar's World a few days ago.I don't suppose you heard whether it had been received?"Horza grinned at Balveda in a way that was meant to show he didn't expect an answer, or at least not a truthful one.The tall Culture agent looked at the floor, seemed to shrug, then met Horza's eyes."I heard," she said."It was overdue. "Horza stayed looking at her.Balveda didn't take her eyes away.Yalson glanced from one to another.Eventually the drone Unaha Closp said, "Frankly, none of this inspires confidence.My advice would be to " It stopped as Horza glared at it."Hmm," it said, "well, never mind that for now. "It floated sideways to the door and went out."Seems to be OK," Wubslin said, not apparently addressing anybody in particular.He sat back from the console, nodding to himself."Yes, ship's back to normal now. "He turned round and smiled at the other three.They came for him.He was in a gamehall playing floatball.He thought he was safe there, surrounded by friends in every direction (they seemed to float like a cloud of flies in front of him for a second, but he laughed that off, caught the ball, threw it and scored a point).But they came for him there.He saw them coming, two of them, from a door set in a narrow chimney of the spherical, ribbed gamehall.They wore cloaks of no colour, and came straight towards him.He tried to float away, but his power harness was dead.He was stuck in mid air, unable to make progress in any direction.He was trying to swim through the air and struggle out of his harness so that he could throw it at them  perhaps to hit, certainly to send himself off in the other direction  when they caught him.None of the people around him seemed to notice, and he realised suddenly they were not his friends, that in fact he didn't know any of them.They took his arms and, in an instant, without travelling past or through anything yet somehow making him feel they had turned an invisible corner to a place that was always there but out of sight, they were in an area of darkness.Their no colour cloaks showed up in the darkness when he looked away.He was powerless, locked in stone, but he could see and breathe."Help me!""That is not what we are here for."Who are you?""You know."I don't."Then we can't tell you."What do you want?""We want you. ""Why?""Why not?""But why me?""You have no one."What?""You have no one."What do you mean?""No family.No friends "  " no religion.No belief."That's not true!""How would you know?""I believe in"  "What?""Me!""That is not enough."Anyway, you'll never find it."What?Find what?""Enough.Let's do it now."Do what?""Take your name."I   And they reached together into his skull and took his name.So he screamed."Horza!"Yalson shook his head, bouncing it off the bulkhead at the top of the small bed.He spluttered awake, the whimper dying on his lips, his body tense for an instant, then soft.He put his hands out and touched the woman's furred skin.She put her hands behind his head and hugged him to her breast.He said nothing, but his heart slowed to the pace of hers.She rocked his body gently with her own, then pushed his head away, bent and kissed his lips."I'm all right now," he told her."Just a nightmare. ""What was it?""Nothing," he said.He put his head back to her chest, nestling it between her breasts like a huge, delicate egg.Horza had his suit on.Wubslin was in his usual seat.Yalson occupied the co pilot's chair.They were all suited up.Schar's World filled the screen in front of them, the belly sensors of the CAT staring straight down at the sphere of white and grey beneath and magnifying it."One more time," Horza said.Wubslin transmitted the recorded message for the third time."Maybe they don't use that code any more," Yalson said.She watched the screen with her sharp browed eyes.She had cropped her hair back to about a centimetre over her skull, hardly thicker than the down which covered her body.The menacing effect jarred with the smallness of her head sticking out from the large neck of the suit."It's traditional; more of a ceremonial language than a code," Horza said."They'll know it if they hear it. ""You're sure we're beaming it at the right place?""Yes," Horza said, trying to remain calm.They had been in orbit for less than half an hour, stationary above the continent which held the buried tunnels of the Command System.Almost the whole of the planet was covered in snow.Ice locked the thousand kilometre peninsula where the tunnel system lay fast into the sea itself.Schar's World had entered another of its periodic ice ages seven thousand years previously, and only in a relatively thin band around the equator  between the slightly wobbling planet's tropics  was there open ocean.It showed as a steely grey belt around the world, occasionally visible through whorls of storm clouds.They were twenty five thousand kilometres out from the planet's snow crusted surface, their communicator beaming down onto a circular area a few tens of kilometres in diameter at a point midway between the two frozen arms of sea which gave the peninsula a slight waist.That was where the entrance to the tunnels lay; that was where the Changers lived.Horza knew he hadn't made a mistake, but there was no answer.There is death here, he kept thinking.A little of the planet's chill seemed to creep along his bones."Nothing," Wubslin said."Right," Horza said, taking the manual controls into his gloved hands."We're going in. "The Clear Air Turbulence teased its warp fields out along the slight curve of the planet's gravity well, carefully edging itself down the slope.Horza cut the motors and let them return to their emergency ready only mode.They shouldn't need them now, and would soon be unable to use them as the gravity gradient increased.The CAT fell with gradually increasing speed towards the planet, fusion motors at the ready.Horza watched displays on the screens until he was satisfied they were on course; then, with the planet seeming to turn a little beneath the craft, he unstrapped and went back to the mess.Aviger, Neisin and Dorolow sat in their suits, strapped into the mess room seats.Perosteck Balveda was also strapped in; she wore a thick jacket and matching trousers.Her head was exposed above the soft ruff of a white shirt.The bulky fabric jacket was fastened up to her throat.She had warm boots on, and a pair of hide gloves lay on the table in front of her.The jacket even had a little hood, which hung down her back.Horza wasn't sure whether Balveda had chosen this soft, useless image of a space suit to make a point to him, or unconsciously, out of fear and a need for security.Unaha Closp sat in a chair, strapped against its back, pointing straight up at the ceiling."I trust', it said, "we're not going to have the same sort of flying circus job we had to endure the last time you flew this heap of debris. "Horza ignored it."We haven't had any word from Mr Adequate, so it looks like we're all going down," he said."When we get there, I'll go in by myself to check things out.When I come back, we'll decide what we're going to do. ""That is, you'll decide " began the drone."What if you don't come back?"Aviger said.The drone made a hissing noise but went quiet.Horza looked at the toy like figure of the old man in his suit."I'll come back, Aviger," he said."I'm sure everybody at the base will be fine.I'll get them to heat up some food for us. "He smiled, but knew it wasn't especially convincing."Anyway," he went on, "in the unlikely event there is anything wrong, I'll come straight back. ""Well, this ship's our only way off the planet; remember that, Horza," Aviger said.His eyes looked frightened.Dorolow touched him on the arm of his suit."Trust in God," Dorolow said."We'll be all right. "She looked at Horza."Won't we, Horza?"Horza nodded."Yes.We'll be all right.We'll all be just fine. "He turned and went back to the bridge.They stood in the high mountain snows, watching the midsummer sun sink in its own red seas of air and cloud.A cold wind blew her hair across her face, auburn over white, and he raised a hand, without thinking, to sweep it away again.She turned to him, her head nestling into his cupped hand, a small smile on her face."So much for midsummer's day," she said.The day had been fair, still well below freezing, but mild enough for them to take their gloves off and push their hoods back.The nape of her neck was warm against his palm, and the lustrous, heavy hair brushed over the back of his hand as she looked up at him, skin white as snow, white as bone."That look, again," she said softly."What look?"he said, defensively, knowing."The far away one," she said, taking his hand and bringing it to her mouth, kissing it, stroking it as though it was a small, defenceless animal."Well, that's just what you call it. "She looked away from him, towards the livid red ball of the sun, lowering behind the distant range."That's what I see," she told him."I know your looks by now.I know them all, and what they mean. "He felt a twinge of anger at being thought so obvious, but knew that she was right, at least partly.What she did not know about him was only what he did not know about himself (but that, he told himself, was quite a lot still).Perhaps she even knew him better than he did himself."I'm not responsible for my looks," he said after a moment, to make a joke of it."They surprise me, too, sometimes. ""And what you do?"she said, the sunset's glow rubbing false colour into her pale, thin face."Will you surprise yourself when you leave here?""Why do you always assume I'm going to leave?"he said, annoyed, stuffing his hands into the thick jacket's pockets and staring at the hemisphere of disappearing star."I keep telling you, I'm happy here. ""Yes," she said."You keep telling me. ""Why should I want to leave?"She shrugged, slipped one arm through his, put her head to his shoulder."Bright lights, big crowds, interesting times; other people. ""I'm happy here with you," he told her, and put his arm round her shoulders.Even in the bulky quilting of the jacket, she seemed slim, almost fragile.She said nothing for a moment, then, in quite a different tone: " And so you should be. "She turned to face him, smiling."Now kiss me. "He kissed her, hugged her.Looking down over her shoulder, he saw something small and red move on the trampled snow near her feet."Look!"he said, breaking away, stooping.She squatted beside him, and together they watched the tiny, stick like insect crawl slowly, laboriously, over the surface of the snow: one more living, moving thing on the blank face of the world."That's the first one I've seen," he told her.She shook her head, smiling."You just don't look," she chided.He put out one hand and scooped the insect into his palm, before she could stop him."Oh, Horza" she said, her breath catching on a tiny hook of despair.He looked, uncomprehending, at her stricken expression, while the snow creature died from the warmth of his hand.The Clear Air Turbulence dropped towards the planet, circling its ice bright layers of atmosphere from day to night and back again, tipping over the equator and tropics as it spiralled in.Gradually it encountered that atmosphere  ions and gases, ozone and air.It swooped through the world's thin wrapping with a voice of fire, flashing like a large, steady meteorite across the night sky, then across the dawn terminator, over steel grey seas, tabular bergs, ice tables, floes and shelves, frozen coasts, glaciers, mountain ranges, permafrost tundra, more crushed pack ice and, finally, as it bellied down on its pillars of flame, land again: land on a thousand kilometre peninsula sticking out into a frozen sea like some monstrous fractured limb set in plaster."There it is," Wubslin said, watching the mass sensor screen.A bright, winking light tracked slowly across the display.Horza looked over."The Mind?"he asked.Wubslin nodded."Right density.Five kilometres deep" He punched some buttons and squinted at figures scrolling across the screen."On the far side of the system from the entrance and moving. "The pinpoint of light on the screen disappeared.Wubslin adjusted the controls, then sat back, shaking his head."Sensor needs an overhaul; its range is right down. "The engineer scratched his chest and sighed."Sorry about the engines, too, Horza. "The Changer shrugged.Had the motors been working properly, or had the mass sensor's range been adequate, somebody could have remained on the CAT, flying it if necessary, and relaying the Mind's position to the others in the tunnels.Wubslin seemed to feel guilty that none of the repairs he'd tried to effect had significantly improved the performance of either motors or sensor."Never mind," Horza said, watching the waste of ice and snow passing beneath them."At least now we know the thing's in there. "The ship guided them to the right area, though Horza recognised it anyway from the times he had flown the single small flyer the base was allowed.He looked for the flyer as they made their final approach, in case somebody happened to be using it.The snow covered plain was ringed by mountains; the Clear Air Turbulence swept over a pass between two peaks, shattering the silence, tearing dusty snow from the jagged ridges and crags of the barren rocks on either side.It slowed further, coming in nose up on its tripod of fusion fire.The snow on the plain beneath picked itself up and stirred as though uneasy at first.Then as the craft dropped lower and lower the snow was blown, then ripped, from the frozen ground beneath and thrown away in vast swirling rolls of heated air mixing snow and water, steam and plasma particles, in a howling blizzard which swept across the plain, gathering strength as the vessel dropped.Horza had the CAT on manual.He watched the screen ahead, saw the false, created wind of stormy snow and steam in front, and beyond it, the entrance to the Command System.It was a black hole set in a rugged promontory of rock which fluted down from the higher cliffs behind like a piece of solidified scree.The snowstorm broiled round the dark entrance like mist.The storm was turning brown as the fusion flame heated the frozen ground of the plain itself, melting it and plucking it out in an earthy spray.With hardly a bump, and only a little settling as the legs sank into the now soggy surface of the swept plain, the CAT touched the surface of Schar's World.Horza looked straight ahead at the tunnel entrance.It was like a deep dark eye, staring back.The motors died; the steam drifted.Disturbed snow fell back, and some new flakes formed as the suspended water in the air froze once more.The CAT clicked and creaked as it cooled from the heat produced by both the friction of re entry and its own plasma jets.Water gurgled, turning to slush, over the scoured surface of the plain.Horza switched the CAT's bow laser to standby.There was no movement or sign from the tunnel.The view was clear now, the snow and steam gone.It was a bright, sunny, windless day."Well, here we are," Horza said, and immediately felt foolish.Yalson nodded, still staring at the screen."Yup," Wubslin said, checking screens, nodding."Feet have sunk in half a metre or so.We'll have to remember to run the motors for a while before we try to lift off, when we leave.They'll freeze solid in half an hour. ""Hmm," Horza said.He watched the screen.Nothing moved.There were no clouds in the light blue sky, no wind to move the snows.The sun wasn't warm enough to melt the ice and snow so there was no running water, not even any avalanches in the distant mountains.With the exception of the seas  which still contained fish, but no longer any mammals  the only things which moved on Schar's World were a few hundred species of small insects, slow spreading lichen on rocks near the equator, and the glaciers.The humanoids" war, or the ice age, had wiped everything else out.Horza tried the coded message once more.There was no reply."Right," he said, getting up from his seat."I'll step out and take a look. "Wubslin nodded.Horza turned to Yalson."You're very quiet," he said.Yalson didn't look at him.She was staring at the screen and the unblinking eye of the tunnel entrance."Be careful," she said.She looked at him."Just be careful, all right?"Horza smiled at her, picked up Kraiklyn's laser rifle from the floor, then went through to the mess."We're down," he said as he went through."See?"Dorolow said to Aviger.Neisin drank from his hip flask.Balveda gave the Changer a thin smile as he went from one door to the other.Unaha Closp resisted the temptation to say anything, and wriggled out of the seat straps.Horza descended to the hangar.He felt light as he walked; they had switched to ambient gravity on their way over the mountains, and Schar's World produced less pull than the standard G used on the CAT.Horza rode the hangar's descending floor to the now refreezing marsh, where the breeze was fresh and sharp and clean."Hope everything's all right," Wubslin said as he and Yalson watched the small figure wade through the snow towards the rocky promontory ahead.Yalson said nothing but watched the screen with unblinking eyes.The figure stopped, touched its wrist, then rose in the air and floated slowly across the snows."Ha," Wubslin said, laughing a little."I'd forgotten we could use AG here.Too long on that damn O. ""Won't be much use in those fucking tunnels," Yalson muttered.Horza landed just to the side of the tunnel entrance.From the readings he had already taken while flying over the snow, he knew the tunnel door field was off.Normally it kept the tunnel within shielded from the snow and the cold air outside, but there was no field there, and he could see that a little snow had blown into the tunnel and now lay in a fan shape on its floor.The tunnel was cold inside, not warm as it should be, and its black, deep eye seemed more like a huge mouth, now that he was close to it.He looked back at the CAT, facing him from two hundred metres away, a shining metal interruption on the white expanse, squatting in a blast mark of brown."I'm going inside," he told the ship, aiming a tight beam at it rather than broadcasting the signal."OK," Wubslin said in his ear."You don't want somebody there to cover you?"Yalson said."No," Horza replied.He walked down the tunnel, keeping close to the wall.In the first equipment bay were some ice sleds and rescue gear, tracking apparatus and signalling beacons.It was all much as he recalled it.In the second bay, where the flyer should have been, there was nothing.He went on to the next one: more equipment.He was about forty metres inside the tunnel now, ten metres shy of the right angled turn which led into the larger, segmented gallery where the living accommodation of the base lay.The mouth of the tunnel was a white hole when he turned back to face it.He set the tight beam on wide aperture."Nothing yet.I'm about to look into the accommodation section.Bleep but don't reply otherwise. "The helmet speakers bleeped.Before going round the corner he detached the suit's remote sensor from the side of the helmet and edged its small lens round the corner of sculpted rock.On an internal screen he saw the short length of tunnel, the flyer lying on the ground, and a few metres beyond it the wall of plastic planking which filled the tunnel and showed where the human accommodation section of the Changer base began.By the side of the small flyer lay four bodies.There was no movement.Horza felt his throat closing up.He swallowed hard, then put the remote sensor back on the side of the helmet.He walked along the floor of fused rock to the bodies.Two were dressed in light, unarmoured suits.They were both men, and he didn't recognise them.One of them had been lasered, the suit flash burned open so that the melted metals and plastics had mingled with the guts and flesh inside; the hole was half a metre in diameter.The other suited man had no head.His arms were stuck out stiffly in front of him as though to embrace something.There was another man, dressed in light, loose clothes.His skull had been smashed in from behind, and at least one arm was broken.He lay on his side, as frozen and dead as the other two.Horza was aware that he knew the man's name but he couldn't think of it just then.Kierachell must have been asleep.Her slim body was lying straight, inside a blue nightgown; her eyes were closed, her face peaceful.Her neck had been broken.Horza looked down at her for a while, then took one of his gloves off and bent down.There was frost on her eyelashes.He was aware of the wrist seal inside the suit gripping his forearm tightly, and of the thin cold air his hand was exposed to.Her skin was hard.Her hair was still soft, and he let it run through his fingers.It was more red than he remembered, but that might just have been the effect of the helmet visor as it intensified the poor light of the darkened tunnel.Perhaps he should take his helmet off, too, to see her better, and use the helmet lights  He shook his head, turning away.He opened the door to the accommodation section  carefully, after listening for any noise coming through the wall.In the open, vaulted area where the Changers had kept their outdoor clothes and suits and some smaller pieces of equipment, there was little to show that the place had been taken over.Further through the accommodation unit, he found traces of a fight: dried blood; laser burns; in the control room, where the base's systems were monitored, there had been an explosion.It looked like a small grenade had gone off under the control panel.That accounted for the lack of heating, and the emergency light.It looked as though somebody had been trying to repair the damage, judging by some tools, spare pieces of equipment and wiring lying around.In a couple of the cabins he found traces of Idiran occupation.The rooms had been stripped bare; religious symbols were burned onto the walls.In another room the floor had been covered with some sort of soft, deep covering like dry gelatin.There were six long indentations in the material, and the room smelt of medjel.In Kierachell's room, only the bed was untidy.It had changed little otherwise.He left it and went to the far end of the accommodation unit, where another wall of plastic boards marked the beginning of the tunnels.He opened the door cautiously.A dead medjel lay just outside, its long body seemingly pointing the way down the tunnel to the waiting shafts.Horza looked at it for a while, monitored its body for a moment (dead still, frozen), then prodded it and finally shot it once through the head, just to be sure.It was in standard fleet ground force uniform, and it had been wounded some time ago, badly.It looked like it had suffered from frostbite earlier, too, before it had died of its wounds and frozen.It was a male, grizzled, its green brown skin leathery with age, its long muzzle face and small delicate looking hands deeply lined.He looked down the dark tunnel.Smooth fused floor, smooth arched walls, the tunnel went on into the mountain side.Blast doors made ribs along the tunnel sides, their tracks and slots carved across the floor and roof.He could see the elevator shaft doors, and the boarding point for the service tube capsules.He walked along, past the sets of ancient blast door6, until he came to the access shafts.The elevators were all at the bottom; the transit tube was locked shut.No power seemed to be running through any of the systems.He turned and walked back to the accommodation section, through it and past the bodies and the flyer without giving them a glance, and eventually out into the open air.He sat down at the side of the tunnel entrance, in the snow, his back to the rock.They saw him from the CAT, and Yalson said, "Horza!Are you all right?""No," he said, turning the laser rifle off."No, I'm not. ""What's wrong?"Yalson said quickly.Horza took the suit helmet off, putting it down on the snow beside him.The cold air sucked heat from his face, and he had to breathe hard in the thin atmosphere."There is death here," he said to the cloudless sky.10.The Command System: Batholith  "It's called a batholith: a granitic intrusion which rose up like a molten bubble into the sedimentary and metamorphic rocks already here a hundred million years ago."Eleven thousand years ago the locals built the Command System in it, hoping to use the rock cover as protection from fusion warheads."They built nine stations and eight trains.The idea was that the politicos and military chiefs sat in one train, their seconds in command and deputies in another, and during a war all eight trains would be shuffled around the tunnels, halting in a station to be linked via hardened communication channels to the transceiver sites on the immediate surface and throughout the state, so they could run the war.The enemy would have a hard time cracking the granite that deep anyway, but hitting something as relatively small as a station would be even more difficult, and they never could be sure there would be a train in it, or that it would be manned, and on top of that they had to knock out the back up train as well as the main one."Germ warfare killed them all off, and some time between then and ten thousand years ago the Dra'Azon moved in, pumping the air out of the tunnels and replacing it with inert gas.Seven thousand years ago a new ice age started, and about four thousand years after that the place got so cold Mr Adequate pumped the argon out and let the planet's own atmosphere back in; it's so desiccated, nothing's rusted in the tunnels for three millennia."About three and a half thousand years ago the Dra'Azon came to an agreement with most of the rival Galactic Federations which allowed ships in distress to cross the Quiet Barriers.Politically neutral, relatively powerless species were permitted to set up small bases on most of the Planets of the Dead to provide help for those in distress and  I suppose  to provide a sop to the people who had always wanted to know what the planets were like; certainly on Schar's World, Mr Adequate let us take a good look at the System every year, and turned a blind eye when we went down unofficially.However nobody's ever taken unscrambled recordings of any sort out of the tunnels."The entrance we're at is here: at the base of the peninsula, above station four, one of the three main stations  the others are one and seven  where repair and maintenance facilities exist.There are no trains parked in four, three or five.There are two trains in station one, two in seven, one train each in the rest.At least that's where they ought to be; the Idirans may have moved them, though I doubt it."The stations are twenty five to thirty five kilometres apart, linked by twin sets of tunnels which only join up at each of the stations.The whole System is buried about five kilometres down."We'll take lasers and a neural stunner, plus chaff grenades for protection  nothing heavier.Neisin can take his projectile rifle; the bullets he has are only light explosive But no plasma cannons or micronukes.They'd be dangerous enough in the tunnels anyway, God knows, but they might also bring down Mr Adequate's wrath, and we don't want that."Wubslin's rigged up our ship mass anomaly sensor into a portable set, so we can spot the Mind.In addition, I've got a mass sensor in my suit, so we shouldn't have any problem actually finding what we're after, even if it's hidden itself "  "Assuming the Idirans don't have their own communicators, they'll be using the Changers'.Our transceivers cover their frequencies and more, so we can listen in on them, but they can't hear us."So those are the tunnels.That Mind is in there somewhere, and so, presumably, are some Idirans and medjel. "Horza stood in the mess room at the head of the table, under the screen.On the screen a diagram of the tunnels was superimposed over a map of the peninsula.The others looked at him.The empty semi suit of the medjel he had found lay in the centre of the table."You want to take us all in?"the drone Unaha Closp said."Yes. ""What about the ship?"Neisin said."It can take care of itself.I'll programme its automatics so that it'll recognise us and defend itself against anybody else. ""And you're going to take her?"Yalson asked, nodding at Balveda, who was sitting opposite her.Horza looked at the Culture woman."I'd prefer to have Balveda where I can see her," he said."I wouldn't feel safe leaving her here with any of you. ""I still don't see why I have to go," Unaha Closp said."Because," Horza told it, "I don't trust you on board here, either.Besides, I want you to carry stuff. ""What?"The drone sounded angry."I don't know that you're being completely honest here, Horza," Aviger said, shaking his head ruefully."You say that the Idirans and medjel well, that you're on their side.But here they are, and they've killed four of your own people already, and you think that they're somewhere inside these tunnels, wandering about And they're supposed to be about the best ground troops in the galaxy.You want to send us up against them?""First of all," Horza sighed, "I am on their side.We're after the same thing.Secondly, it looks to me as though they don't have many weapons of their own, otherwise that medjel would certainly have been armed.All they probably have here are the Changers" weapons.Also it looks, from this medjel suit we've got"  he gestured at the webbed apparatus in the middle of the table, which he and Wubslin had been studying since they had brought it on board  "like a lot of their equipment is blown.Only the lights and the heaters on this thing were working.Everything else had fused.My guess is all that happened when they came through the Quiet Barrier.They were all zapped inside the chuy hirtsi, and their battle gear was fucked up.If the same thing happened to their weapons as happened to their suits, they're virtually unarmed, and with a lot of problems.With all these fancy new AG harnesses and lasers, we're much better equipped, even in the unlikely event that it does come to a fight. ""Which is very likely, considering they won't have any communicators left," Balveda said."You'll never get close enough to tell them.And even if you did, how are they supposed to know you're who you say you are?If they're the same lot you think they are, they came in here just after the Mind did; they won't even have heard of you.They certainly won't believe you. "The Culture agent looked round the others."Your surrogate captain is leading you to your deaths. ""Balveda," Horza said, "I'm doing you a courtesy letting you in on all this; don't annoy me. "Balveda arched her eyebrows, staying silent."How do we know these are the same lot who got here inside this weird animal anyway?"Neisin said.He looked suspiciously at Horza."They can't be anybody else," Horza said."They were damn lucky to survive what the Dra'Azon did to them, and even the Idirans wouldn't risk sending any other forces in after they saw what had happened to this lot. ""But that means they've been here for months," Dorolow said."How are we supposed to find something if they've been here all this time and haven't found anything?""Perhaps they have," Horza said, spreading his arms wide and smiling at the woman, a trace of sarcasm in his voice; "but if they haven't, it's very possibly because they won't have any working gear with them.They'd have to search the whole Command System."Besides, if that warp animal was as badly damaged as I heard it was, they won't have had much control over it.Very likely they crash landed hundreds of kilometres away and had to slog here through the snow.In that case they might have only been here for a few days. ""I can't believe the god would let this happen," Dorolow said, shaking her head and looking at the surface of the table in front of her."There must be something else to all this.I could feel its power and and goodness when we came through the Barrier.It wouldn't let those poor people just be shot down like that. "Horza rolled his eyes."Dorolow," he said to her, leaning forward and planting his knuckles on the table top, "the Dra'Azon are barely aware there's a war going on.They don't really give a damn about individuals.They recognise death and decay, but not hope and faith.As long as the Idirans, or we, don't wreck the Command System or blow the planet away, they won't give a damn who lives or dies. "Dorolow sat back, silent but unconvinced.Horza straightened.His words sounded fine; he had the impression the mercenaries would follow him, but inside, deeper than where the words were coming from, he felt no more caring, no more alive than the snow covered plain outside.He, Wubslin and Neisin had gone back into the tunnels.They had investigated the accommodation section, and found more evidence of Idiran habitation.It looked as though a very small force  one or two Idirans and maybe half a dozen medjel  had stayed for a while at the Changer base after they had taken it over.They had apparently taken a lot of freeze dried emergency food supplies with them, the two laser rifles and the few small pistols the Changer base was allowed, and the four portable communication sets from the store room.Horza had covered the dead Changers up with the reflector foil they had found in the base, and removed the semi suit from the dead medjel.They had looked at the flyer, to see if it was serviceable.It wasn't; its micropile had been partially removed and badly damaged in the process.Like almost everything else in the base, it was without power.Back on board the Clear Air Turbulence, Horza and Wubslin had dissected the medjel's suit and discovered the subtle but irreparable damage which had been inflicted on it.All the time, whenever Horza wasn't worrying about what their chances and their choices were, each moment he stopped concentrating on what he was looking at or supposed to be thinking about, he saw a hard and frozen face, at right angles to the body it was attached to, with frost on the eyelashes.He tried not to think about her.There was no point; nothing he could do.He had to go on, he had to see this through, even more so now.He had thought for a long time about what he could do with the rest of the people on the Clear Air Turbulence, and decided he had no real choice but to take them all into the Command System with him.Balveda was one problem; he wouldn't feel safe even leaving the whole crew to guard her, and he wanted the best fighters along with him, not stuck on the ship.He could have got round this problem just by killing the Culture agent, but the others had got too used to her, had come to like her just a little too much.If he killed her, he would lose them."Well, I think it's insanity to go down into those tunnels," Unaha Closp said."Why not just wait up here until the Idirans reappear, with or without this precious Mind?""First of all," Horza said, watching the expressions on the others" faces for any sign of agreement with the drone, "if they don't find it they probably won't reappear; these are Idirans, and a carefully chosen crack squad of them at that.They'll stay down there for ever. "He looked at the tunnel system drawn on the screen, then back at the people and the machine around the table."They could search for a thousand years in there, especially if the power's off and they don't know how to bring it back up, which I'm assuming they don't. ""And you do, of course," the machine said."Yes," Horza said, "I do.We can turn the power on at one of three stations: this one, number seven or number one. ""It still works?"Wubslin looked sceptical."Well, it was working when I left.Deep geothermal, producing electricity.The power shafts are sunk about a hundred kilometres through the crust."Anyway, as I say, there's too much space down there for those Idirans and medjel to have a hope of searching properly without some sort of detection device.A mass anomaly sensor is the only one that'll work, and they can't have one.We have two.That's why we have to go in. ""And fight," Dorolow said."Probably not.They've taken communicators; I'll get in touch with them and explain who I am.Naturally I can't tell you the details, but I know enough about the Idiran military system, about their ships, even some of their personnel, to be able to convince them I am who I say I am.They won't know me personally, but they were told a Changer would be sent later. ""Liar," Balveda said.Her voice was cold.Horza felt the atmosphere in the mess change, become tense.The Culture woman was looking at him, her features set, determined, even resigned."Balveda," he said softly, "I don't know what you were told, but I was briefed on The Hand of God, and Xoralundra told me the Idiran ground force in the chuy hirtsi knew I'd been sent for. "He said it calmly."OK?""That wasn't what I heard," Balveda said, but he sensed she was not totally sure of herself.She had risked a lot to say that, probably hoping that he would at least threaten her or do something which would turn the others against him.It hadn't worked.Horza shrugged."I can't help it if the Special Circumstances section can't brief you accurately, Perosteck," he said, smiling thinly.The Culture agent's eyes looked away from the Changer's face, at the table, then at each of the other people sitting around it, as though testing them to see who they each believed."Look," Horza said in his most honest sounding and reasonable voice, spreading his hands out, "I don't want to die for the Idirans, and God knows why, but I have come to like you lot.I wouldn't take you in there on a suicide mission.We'll be all right.If the worst comes to the worst we can always pull out.We'll take the CAT back through the Quiet Barrier and head for somewhere neutral.You can have the ship; I'll have a captured Culture agent. "He looked at Balveda, who was sitting in her seat with her legs crossed, her arms folded and her head down."But I don't think it'll come to that.I think we'll catch this glorified computer and be well rewarded for it. ""What if the Culture's won the battle outside the Barrier and they're waiting for us when we come out, with or without the Mind?"Yalson asked.She didn't sound hostile, just interested.She was the only one he felt he could rely on, though he thought Wubslin would follow, too.Horza nodded."That's unlikely.I can't see the Culture falling back all over this volume but holding out here; but even if they did they'd have to be very lucky indeed to catch us.They can only see into the Barrier in real space, don't forget, so they'd have no warning of where we'd be coming out.No problem there. "Yalson sat back, apparently convinced.Horza knew he looked calm, but inside he was tensed up, waiting for the mood of the rest to make itself clear.His last answer had been truthful, but the rest were either not the whole truth, or lies.He had to convince them.He had to have them on his side.There was no other way he could carry out his mission, and he had come too far, done too much, killed too many people, sunk too much of his own purpose and determination into the task, to back out now.He had to track the Mind down, he had to go down into the Command System, Idirans or no Idirans, and he had to have the rest of what had been Kraiklyn's Free Company with him.He looked at them: at Yalson, severe and impatient, wanting the talking to stop and the job just to be got on with, her shadow of hair making her look both very young, almost child like, and hard at the same time; Dorolow, her eyes uncertain, looking at the others, scratching one of her convoluted ears nervously; Wubslin, slumped comfortably in his seat, compressed, his stocky frame radiating relaxation.Wubslin's face had shown signs of interest when Horza described the Command System, and the Changer guessed the engineer found the whole idea of this gigantic train set fascinating.Aviger looked very dubious about the whole venture, but Horza thought that now he had made it clear nobody was going to be allowed to stay on the ship, the old man would accept this rather than go to the trouble of arguing about it.Neisin he wasn't sure about.He had been drinking as much as ever, been quieter than Horza remembered him, but while he didn't like being bossed around and told what he could and couldn't do, he was obviously fed up being stuck on the Clear Air Turbulence, and had already been out for a walk in the snow while Wubslin and Horza were looking at the medjel suit.Boredom would make him follow, if nothing else.Horza wasn't worried about the machine Unaha Closp; it would do as it was told, like machines always did.Only the Culture let them get so fancy they really did seem to have wills of their own.As for Perosteck Balveda, she was his prisoner; it was as simple as that."Easy in, easy out" Yalson said.She smiled, shrugged and, looking round at the others, said, "What the fuck; it's something to do, isn't it?"Nobody disagreed.Horza was reprogramming the CAT's fidelities once more, entering the computer's new instructions through a worn but still serviceable touchboard, when Yalson came onto the flight deck.She slipped into the co pilot's seat and watched the man as he worked; the touch board's illuminated display threw the shadows of Marain characters over his face.After a while she said, looking at the markings on the illuminated board, "Marain, eh?"Horza shrugged."It's the only accurate language I and this antique share. "He tapped some more instructions in."Hey. "He turned to her."You shouldn't be in here when I'm doing this. "He smiled, to show her he wasn't serious."Don't you trust me?"Yalson said, smiling back."You're the only one I do," Horza said, turning to the board again."It doesn't matter anyway, for these instructions. "Yalson watched him for a little longer."Did she mean a lot to you, Horza?"He didn't look up, but his hands paused over the touchboard.He stared at the illuminated characters."Who?""Horza" Yalson said, gently.He still didn't look at her."We were friends," he said, as though talking to the touchboard."Yeah, well," she said, after a pause, "I suppose it must be pretty hard anyway, when it's your own people"  Horza nodded, still not looking up.Yalson studied him for a little longer."Did you love her?"He didn't reply immediately; his eyes seemed to inspect each of the precise, compact shapes in front of him, as though one of them concealed the answer.He shrugged."Maybe," he said, "once. "He cleared his throat, looked briefly round at Yalson, then leant back to the touchboard."That was a long time ago. "Yalson got up then, as he went back to his task, and put her hands on his shoulders."I'm sorry, Horza. "He nodded again, and placed one hand over hers."We'll get them," she said."If that's what you want.You and "  He shook his head, looked round at her."No.We go for the Mind, that's all.If the Idirans do get in the way, I won't care, but no, there's no point in risking more than we have to.Thanks, though. "She nodded slowly."That's all right. "She bent, kissed him briefly, then went out.The man gazed at the closed door for a few moments, then turned back to the board full of alien symbols.He programmed the ship's computer to fire warning, then lethal laser shots at anybody or anything approaching it unless they could be identified by the distinctive electromagnetic emission signature of their suit as one of the Free Company.In addition, it required Horza's  Kraiklyn's  identity ring to make the CAT's elevator work and, once on board, to take control of the ship itself.Horza felt safe enough doing this; only the ring would let them take over the ship, and he was confident nobody could take that from him, not without a greater risk to themselves than even a squad of mean and hungry Idirans could provide.But it was possible that he might be killed, and the others might survive.Especially for Yalson, he wanted them to have some sort of escape route that didn't depend totally on him.They took down some of the plastic boarding in the Changer base so that if they did find the Mind they would be able to get it through.Dorolow wanted to bury the dead Changers, but Horza refused.He carried each of them to the tunnel entrance and left them there.He would take them with him when they left; return them to Heibohre.The natural freezer of Schar's World's atmosphere would preserve them until then.He looked down at Kierachell's face for a moment, in the waning light of late afternoon, while a bank of clouds coming in from the frozen sea built over the distant mountains, and the wind freshened.He would get the Mind.He was determined to, and he felt it in his bones.But if it came to a fire fight with the ones who had done this, he wouldn't shrink from it.He might even enjoy it.Perhaps Balveda wouldn't have understood, but there were Idirans and Idirans.Xoralundra was a friend, and a kind and humane officer  he supposed the old Querl would be considered a moderate  and Horza knew others in the military and diplomatic missions whom he liked.But there were Idirans who were real fanatics, who despised all other species.Xoralundra would not have murdered the Changers; it would have been unnecessary and inelegant but then you didn't send moderates on missions like this.You sent fanatics.Or a Changer.Horza returned to the others.He got as far as the crippled flyer, now surrounded with the plastic boarding they had removed and facing the hole in the accommodation section as though it was about to enter a garage, when he heard firing.He ran through the corridor leading to the rear of the section, readying his gun."What is it?"he said into his helmet mike."Laser.Down the tunnel, from the shafts," Yalson's voice said.He ran into the open store room area where the others were.The hole they had opened in the plastic boarding was four or five metres wide.As soon as Horza came through from the corridor, flame splashed from the wall alongside him, and he saw the brief airglows of lasertracks just to one side of his suit, leading back through the gap in the wall and down the tunnel.Obviously whoever was doing the shooting could see him.He rolled to one side and came up by Dorolow and Balveda, who were sheltering by a large portable winch.Holes burst through the wall of plastic boards, burning brightly, then going out.The whoop of laser fire echoed down the tunnels."What happened?"Horza said, looking at Dorolow.He looked around the storage area.The rest were all there, taking cover where they could, apart from Yalson."Yalson went " Dorolow began; then Yalson's voice cut in:  "I came through the hole in the wall and got shot at.I'm lying on the ground.I'm OK, but I'd like to know if it's all right to fire back.I won't damage anything, will I?""Fire!"Horza yelled, as another fan of glowing tracks spattered a line of burning craters over the inside wall of the store room."Fire back!""Thanks," Yalson said.Horza heard the woman's gun snap, then the dopplered echo of sound produced by superheated air.Explosions crashed from down the tunnel."Hmm," Yalson said."Think that's got " Neisin said from the far side of the storage area.His voice cut off as more fire slammed into the wall behind him.The wall was pockmarked with dark, bubbling holes."Bastard!"Yalson said.She fired back, in short, rapid bursts."Keep his head down," Horza told her."I'm coming forward to the wall.Dorolow, stay here with Balveda. "He got up and ran to the edge of the hole in the plastic boards.Smoking holes in the material showed how little protection it afforded, but he knelt there in its cover anyway.He could see Yalson's feet a few metres out into the tunnel, spread on the smooth fused floor.He listened to her gun firing, then said, "Right.Stop long enough to let me see where it's coming from, then hit it again. ""OK. "Yalson stopped firing.Horza stuck his head out, feeling incredibly vulnerable, saw a couple of tiny sparks far down the tunnel and off to one side.He brought the gun up and fired continually; Yalson's started again as well.His suit chirped; a screen lit up by his cheek, showing he'd been hit on the thigh.He couldn't feel anything.The side of the tunnel, far down at the elevator shafts, pulsated with a thousand sparks of light.Neisin appeared at the other side of the gap in the boards, kneeling like Horza and firing his projectile rifle.The side of the tunnel detonated with flashes and smoke; shock waves blew up the tunnel, shaking the plastic boarding and ringing in Horza's ears."Enough!"he shouted.He stopped firing.Yalson stopped.Neisin put in one final burst, then stopped, too.Horza ran out through the gap, across the dark rock floor of the tunnel outside and over to the side wall.He flattened himself there, getting some cover from the slight protrusion of a blast door's edge further down the tunnel.Where their target had been, there was a scatter of dull red shards lying on the tunnel floor, cooling from the yellow heat of the laser fire which had torn them from the wall.On the helmet nightsight, Horza could see a series of rippling waves of warm smoke and gas flowing silently under the roof of the tunnel from the damaged area."Yalson, get over here," he said.Yalson rolled over and over until she bumped into the wall just behind him.She got quickly to her feet and flattened out beside him."I think we got it," Horza broadcasted.Neisin, still kneeling at the gap in the boarding, looked out, the rapidfire micro projectile rifle waving to and fro as though its owner expected a further attack from out of the tunnel walls.Horza started forward, keeping his back to the wall.He got to the edge of the blast door.Most of its metre thick bulk was stowed in its recess in the wall, but about half a metre protruded.Horza looked down the tunnel again.The wreckage was still glowing, like hot coals scattered on the tunnel floor.The wave of hot black smoke passed overhead, wafting slowly up the tunnel.Horza looked to his other side.Yalson had followed him."Stay here," he said.He walked down the side of the wall to the first of the elevator shafts.They had been firing at the third and last one, judging by the grouping of the craters and scars all around its open, buckled doors.Horza saw a half melted laser carbine lying in the middle of the tunnel floor.He poked his head out from the wall, frowning.Right on the very lip of the elevator shaft, between the scarred and holed doors, surrounded by a sea of dull, red glowing wreckage, he was sure he could see a pair of hands  gloved, stubby fingered, injured (one finger was missing from the glove nearer him), but hands without a doubt.It looked like somebody was hanging inside the shaft by the tips of their fingers.He focused the tight beam of his communicator, aiming in the direction he was looking at."Hello?"he said in Idiran."Medjel?Medjel in the elevator shaft?Do you hear me?Report at once. "The hands didn't move.He edged closer."What was it?"Wubslin's voice came through the speakers."Just a moment," Horza said.He went closer, rifle ready.One of the hands moved slightly, as though trying to get a better grip on the lip of the tunnel floor.Horza's heart thudded.He went towards the tall open doors, his feet crunching on the warm debris.He saw semi suited arms as he went closer, then the top of a long, laser scarred helmet   With a rasping noise he had heard medjel make when they charged during a battle, another third hand  he knew it was a foot, but it looked like a hand and it was holding a small pistol  flashed up from the elevator shaft at the same time as the medjel's head looked up and out, straight at him.He started to duck.The pistol cracked, its plasma bolt missing him by only a few centimetres.Horza shot quickly, ducking and going to one side.Fire blew out all around the lip of the elevator, smashing into the gloves.With a scream the gloved hands vanished.Light flickered briefly in the circular shaft.Horza ran forward, stuck his head between the doors and looked down.The dim shape of the falling medjel was lit by the guttering fire still burning on its suit gloves.Somehow it still held the plasma pistol; as it fell, screaming, it fired the small weapon, the cracks of its shots and the flashes from the bolts drawing further away as the creature holding it, firing it, whirled, its six limbs flailing, down into the darkness."Horza!"Yalson shouted."Are you all right?What the fuck was that?""I'm fine," he said.The medjel was a tiny, wriggling shape, deep in the shaft's tunnel of vertical night.Its screams still echoed, the microscopic sparks of its burning hands and the firing plasma pistol still flaring.Horza looked away.A few small thuds recorded the hapless creature's contact with the sides of the shaft as it dropped."What's that noise?"Dorolow said."The medjel was still alive.It shot at me, but I got it," Horza told them, walking away from the open elevator doors."It fell  it's still falling  down the elevator shaft. ""Shit!"breathed Neisin, still listening to the faint, fading, echoing screams."How deep is that?""Ten kilometres, if none of the blast doors are shut," Horza said.He looked at the external controls for the other two lifts and the transit capsule entrance.They had escaped more or less undamaged.The doors leading to the transit tubes were open.They had been closed when Horza inspected the area earlier.Yalson shouldered her gun and walked down the tunnel towards Horza."Well," she said, "let's get this op on the road. ""Yeah," Neisin said."What the hell!These guys aren't so tough after all.That's one down already. ""Yeah, deep down," Yalson said.Horza inspected the damage to his suit while the others came down the tunnel.There was a burn on the right thigh, a millimetre deep and a couple of finger breadths wide.Save for the unlikely chance of another shot falling on the same place, it hadn't harmed the suit."A fine start, if you ask me," the drone muttered as it started down the tunnels with the others.Horza went back to the tall, buckled, pitted doors of the lift shaft and looked down.With the magnifier up full he could just make out a tiny sparkling, deep, deep below.The helmet's external mikes picked up a noise, but from so far away and so full of echoes, it sounded like nothing more than the wind starting to moan through a fence.They clustered in front of the opened doors of an elevator shaft, not the one the medjel had fallen down.The doors were twice the height of anyone of them, dwarfing them all, as though they were children.Horza had opened those doors, taken a good look, floated down on the suit's AG a little way, then come back up.It all looked safe."I'll go first," he told the assembled group."If we hit any trouble, let off a couple of chaff grenades and get back up here.We're going to the main system level, about five kilometres down.Once we get through the doors that's us more or less in station four.From there we'll be able to turn on the power, something the Idirans haven't been able to do.After that we'll have transport in the form of transit tube capsules. ""What about the trains?"Wubslin asked."The transit tubes are faster," Horza said."We might have to start a train up if we capture the Mind; depends exactly how big it is.Besides, unless they've moved them since I was here, the nearest trains will be at station two or station six, not here.But there is a spiral tunnel at station one we could bring a System train up. ""What about the transit tube up here?"Yalson said."If that's the way that medjel suddenly appeared, what's to stop another one hiking up the tunnel?"Horza shrugged."Nothing.I don't want to fuse the doors closed in case we want to come back that way once we have the Mind, but if one of them does come up that way, so what?It'll be one less down there for us to worry about.Anyway, somebody can stay up here until we're all safely down the lift shaft, then follow us.But I don't think there will be another one so close behind that one. ""Yes, that one you didn't manage to talk into believing you were both on the same side," the drone said testily.Horza squatted down on his haunches to look at the drone; it was invisible from above because of the pellet of equipment it was carrying."That one," he said, "didn't have a communicator, did it?Whereas any Idirans down there certainly will have the ones they took from the base, won't they?And medjel do as Idirans tell them to, right?"He waited for the machine to reply and when it didn't he repeated, "Right?"Horza had the impression that, had the drone been human, it would have spat."Whatever you say, sir," the drone said."And what do I do, Horza?"Balveda said, standing in her fabric jumpsuit, wearing a fur jacket on top."Do you intend to throw me down the shaft and say you forgot I didn't have any AG, or do I have to walk down the transit tunnel?""You'll come with me. ""And if we hit trouble, you'll what?"Balveda asked."I don't think we'll hit any trouble," Horza said."You're sure there were no AG harnesses in the base?"Aviger said.Horza nodded."If there had been, don't you think one of the medjel we've encountered so far would have had them on?""Maybe the Idirans are using them. ""They're too heavy. ""They could use two," Aviger insisted."There were no harnesses," Horza said through his teeth."We were never allowed any.We weren't supposed to go into the Command System apart from yearly inspections, when we could power everything up.We did go in; we walked down the spiral to station four, like that medjel must have slogged up, but we weren't supposed to, and we weren't allowed gravity harnesses.They'd have made getting down there too easy. ""Dammit, let's get down there," Yalson said impatiently, looking at the others.Aviger shrugged."If my AG fails with all this rubbish I'm carrying " the drone began, its voice muffled by the pallet over its top surface."You drop any of that stuff down that shaft and you'd be as well to follow it, machine," Horza said."Now just save your energy for floating, not talking.You'll follow me; keep five or six hundred metres up.Yalson, will you stay up here till we get the doors open?"Yalson nodded."The rest of you," he looked round them, "come after the drone.Don't bunch up too much but don't get separated.Wubslin, stay at the same level as the machine, and have chaff grenades ready. "Horza held his hand out to Balveda.
