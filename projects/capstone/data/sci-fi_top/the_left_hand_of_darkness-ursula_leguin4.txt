With the cessation of lactation the female re enters somer and becomes once more a perfect androgyne.No physiological habit is established, and the mother of several children may be the father of several more.Social observations:very superficial as yet; I have been moving about too much to make coherent social observations.Kemmer is not always played by pairs.Pairing seems to be the commonest custom, but in the kemmerhouses of towns and cities groups may form and intercourse take place promiscuously among the males and females of the group.The furthest extreme from this practice is the custom ofvowing kemmering (Karh.oskyommer ), which is to all intents and purposes monogamous marriage.It has no legal status, but socially and ethically is an ancient and vigorous institution.The whole structure of the Karhidish Clan Hearths and Domains is indubitably based upon the institution of monogamous marriage.I am not sure of divorce rules in general; here in Osnoriner there is divorce, but no remarriage after either divorce or the partner's death: one can only vow kemmering once.Descent of course is reckoned, all over Gethen, from the mother, the "parent in the flesh" (Karh.amha ) .Incest is permitted, with various restrictions, between siblings, even the full siblings of a vowed kemmering pair.Siblings are not however allowed to vow kemmering, nor keep kemmering after the birth of a child to one of the pair.Incest between generations is strictly forbidden (in Karhide/Orgoreyn; but is said to be permitted among the tribesmen of Perunter, the Antarctic Continent.This may be slander.).What else have I learned for certain?That seems to sum it up.There is one feature of this anomalous arrangement that might have adaptive value.Since coitus takes place only during the period of fertility, the chance of conception is high, as with all mammals that have an estrous cycle.In harsh conditions where infant mortality is great, a race survival value may be indicated.At present neither infant mortality nor the birthrate runs high in the civilized areas of Gethen.Tinibossol estimates a population of not over 100 million on the three continents, and considers it to have been stable for at least a millennium.Ritual and ethical abstention and the use of contraceptive drugs seem to have played the major part in maintaining this stability.There are aspects of ambisexuality which we have only glimpsed or guessed at, and which we may never grasp entirely.The kemmer phenomenon fascinates all of us Investigators, of course.It fascinates us, but it rules the Gethenians, dominates them.The structure of their societies, the management of their industry, agriculture, commerce, the size of their settlements, the subjects of their stories, everything is shaped to fit the somer kemmer cycle.Everybody has his holiday once a month; no one, whatever his position, is obliged or forced to work when in kemmer.No one is barred from the kemmerhouse, however poor or strange.Everything gives way before the recurring torment and festivity of passion.This is easy for us to understand.What is very hard for us to understand is that, four fifths of the time, these people are not sexually motivated at all.Room is made for sex, plenty of room; but a room, as it were, apart.The society of Gethen, in its daily functioning and in its continuity, is without sex.Consider: Anyone can turn his hand to anything.This sounds very simple, but its psychological effects are incalculable.The fact that everyone between seventeen and thirty five or so is liable to be (as Nim put it) "tied down to childbearing," implies that no one is quite so thoroughly "tied down" here as women, elsewhere, are likely to be psychologically or physically.Burden and privilege are shared out pretty equally; everybody has the same risk to run or choice to make.Therefore nobody here is quite so free as a free male anywhere else.Consider: A child has no psycho sexual relationship to his mother and father.There is no myth of Oedipus on Winter.Consider: There is no unconsenting sex, no rape.As with most mammals other than man, coitus can be performed only by mutual invitation and consent; otherwise it is not possible.Seduction certainly is possible, but it must have to be awfully well timed.Consider: There is no division of humanity into strong and weak halves, protective/protected, dominant/submissive, owner/chattel, active/passive.In fact the whole tendency to dualism that pervades human thinking may be found to be lessened, or changed, on Winter.The following must go into my finished Directives: When you meet a Gethenian you cannot and must not do what a bisexual naturally does, which is to cast him in the role of Man or Woman, while adopting towards him a corresponding role dependent on your expectations of the patterned or possible interactions between persons of the same or the opposite sex.Our entire pattern of socio sexual interaction is nonexistent here.They cannot play the game.They do not see one another as men or women.This is almost impossible for our imagination to accept.What is the first question we ask about a newborn baby?Yet you cannot think of a Gethenian as "it. "They are not neuters.They are potentials, or integrals.Lacking the Karhidish "human pronoun" used for persons in somer, I must say "he," for the same reasons as we used the masculine pronoun in referring to a transcendent god: it is less defined, less specific, than the neuter or the feminine.But the very use of the pronoun in my thoughts leads me continually to forget that the Karhider I am with is not a man, but a manwoman.The First Mobile, if one is sent, must be warned that unless he is very self assured, or senile, his pride will suffer.A man wants his virility regarded, a woman wants her femininity appreciated, however indirect and subtle the indications of regard and appreciation.On Winter they will not exist.One is respected and judged only as a human being.It is an appalling experience.Back to my theory.Contemplating the motives for such an experiment, if such it was, and trying perhaps to exculpate our Hainish ancestors from the guilt of barbarism, of treating lives as things, I have made some guesses as to what they might have been after.The somer kemmer cycle strikes us as degrading, a return to the estrous cycle of the lower mammals, a subjection of human beings to the mechanical imperative of rut.It is possible that the experimenters wished to see whether human beings lacking continuous sexual potentiality would remain intelligent and capable of culture.On the other hand, the limitation of the sexual drive to a discontinuous time segment, and the "equalizing" of it in androgyny, must prevent, to a large extent, both the exploitation and the frustration of the drive.There must be sexual frustration (though society provides as well as it can against it; so long as the social unit is large enough that more than one person will be in kemmer at one time, sexual fulfillment is fairly certain), but at least it cannot build up; it is over when kemmer is over.Fine; thus they are spared much waste and madness; but what is left, in somer?What is there to sublimate?What would a society of eunuchs achieve?But of course they are not eunuchs, in somer, but rather more comparable to pre adolescents: not castrate, but latent.Another guess concerning the hypothetical experiment's object: The elimination of war.Did the Ancient Hainish postulate that continuous sexual capacity and organized social aggression, neither of which are attributes of any mammal but man, are cause and effect?Or, like Tumass Song Angot, did they consider war to be a purely masculine displacement activity, a vast Rape, and therefore in their experiment eliminate the masculinity that rapes and the femininity that is raped?God knows.The fact is that Gethenians, though highly competitive (as proved by the elaborate social channels provided for competition for prestige, etc. )seem not to be very aggressive; at least they apparently have never yet had what one could call a war.They kill one another readily by ones and twos; seldom by tens or twenties; never by hundreds or thousands.Why?It may turn out to have nothing to do with their androgyne psychology.There are not very many of them, after all.And there is the climate.The weather of Winter is so relentless, so near the limit of tolerability even to them with all their cold adaptations, that perhaps they use up their fighting spirit fighting the cold.The marginal peoples, the races that just get by, are rarely the warriors.And in the end, the dominant factor in Gethenian life is not sex or any other human thing: it is their environment, their cold world.Here man has a crueler enemy even than himself.I am a woman of peaceful Chiffewar, and no expert on the attractions of violence or the nature of war.Someone else will have to think this out.But I really don't see how anyone could put much stock in victory or glory after he had spent a winter on Winter, and seen the face of the Ice.8.Another Way into Orgoreyn  I SPENT THE SUMMERmore as an Investigator than a Mobile, going about the land of Karhide from town to town, from Domain to Domain, watching and listening things a Mobile cannot do at first, while he is still a marvel and monstrosity, and must be forever on show and ready to perform.I would tell my hosts in those rural Hearths and villages who I was; most of them had heard a little about me over the radio and had a vague idea what I was.They were curious, some more, some less.Few were frightened of me personally, or showed the xenophobic revulsion.An enemy, in Karhide, is not a stranger, an invader.The stranger who comes unknown is a guest.Your enemy is your neighbor.During the month of Kus I lived on the Eastern coast in a Clan Hearth called Gorinhering, a house town fort farm built up on a hill above the eternal fogs of the Hodomin Ocean.Some five hundred people lived there.Four thousand years ago I should have found their ancestors living in the same place, in the same kind of house.Along in those four millennia the electric engine was developed, radios and power looms and power vehicles and farm machinery and all the rest began to be used, and a Machine Age got going, gradually, without any industrial revolution, without any revolution at all.Winter hasn't achieved in thirty centuries what Terra once achieved in thirty decades.Neither has Winter ever paid the price that Terra paid.Winter is an inimical world; its punishment for doing things wrong is sure and prompt: death from cold or death from hunger.No margin, no reprieve.A man can trust his luck, but a society can't; and cultural change, like random mutation, may make things chancier.So they have gone very slowly.At any one point in their history a hasty observer would say that all technological progress and diffusion had ceased.Yet it never has.Compare the torrent and the glacier.Both get where they are going.I talked a lot with the old people of Gorinhering, and also with the children.It was my first chance to see much of Gethenian children, for in Erhenrang they are all in the private or public Hearths and Schools.A quarter to a third of the adult urban population is engaged full time in the nurture and education of the children.Here the clan looked after its own; nobody and everybody was responsible for them.They were a wild lot, chasing about over those fog hidden hills and beaches.When I could round one up long enough to talk, I found them shy, proud, and immensely trustful.The parental instinct varies as widely on Gethen as anywhere.One can't generalize.I never saw a Karhider hit a child.I have seen one speak very angrily to a child.Their tenderness toward their children struck me as being profound, effective, and almost wholly unpossessive.Only in that unpossessiveness does it perhaps differ from what we call the "maternal" instinct.I suspect that the distinction between a maternal and a paternal instinct is scarcely worth making; the parental instinct, the wish to protect, to further, is not a sex linked characteristic...Early in Hakanna we heard in Gorinhering on the static fuzzed Palace Bulletin that King Argaven had announced his expectation of an heir.Not another kemmering son, of which he already had seven, but an heir of the body, king son.The king was pregnant.I found this funny, and so did the clansmen of Gorinhering, but for different reasons.They said he was too old to be bearing children, and they got hilarious and obscene on the subject.The old men went about cackling over it for days.They laughed at the king, but were not otherwise much interested in him."The Domains are Karhide," Estraven had said, and like so much Estraven had said it kept recurring to me as I learned more.The seeming nation, unified for centuries, was a stew of uncoordinated principalities, towns, villages, "pseudo feudal tribal economic units," a sprawl and splatter of vigorous, competent, quarrelsome individualities over which a grid of authority was insecurely and lightly laid.Nothing, I thought, could ever unite Karhide as a nation.Total diffusion of rapid communication devices, which is supposed to bring about nationalism almost inevitably, had not done so.The Ekumen could not appeal to these people as a social unit, a mobilizable entity: rather it must speak to their strong though undeveloped sense of humanity, of human unity.I got quite excited thinking about this.I was, of course, wrong; yet I had learned something about Gethenians which in the long run proved to be useful knowledge.Unless I was to spend all year in Old Karhide I must return to the West Fall before the passes of the Kargav closed.Even here on the coast there had been two light snowfalls in the last month of summer.Rather reluctantly I set off west again, and came to Erhenrang early in Gor, the first month of autumn.Argaven was now in seclusion in the summer palace at Warrever, and had named Pemmer Harge rem ir Tibe as Regent during his confinement.Tibe was already making the most of his  term of power.Within a couple of hours of my arrival I began to see the flaw in my analysis of Karhide it was already out of date and also began to feel uncomfortable, perhaps unsafe, in Erhenrang.Argaven was not sane; the sinister incoherence of his mind darkened the mood of his capital; he fed on fear.All the good of his reign had been done by his ministers and the kyorremy.But he had not done much harm.His wrestles with his own nightmares had not damaged the kingdom.His cousin Tibe was another kind of fish, for his insanity had logic.Tibe knew when to act, and how to act.Only he did not know when to stop.Tibe spoke on the radio a good deal.Estraven when in power had never done so, and it was not in the Karhidish vein: their government was not a public performance, normally; it was covert and indirect.Tibe, however, orated.Hearing his voice on the air I saw again the long toothed smile and the face masked with a net of fine wrinkles.His speeches were long and loud: praises of Karhide, disparagements of Orgoreyn, vilifications of "disloyal factions," discussions of the "integrity of the Kingdom's borders," lectures in history and ethics and economics, all in a ranting, canting, emotional tone that went shrill with vituperation or adulation.He talked much about pride of country and love of the parentland, but little about shifgrethor, personal pride or prestige.Had Karhide lost so much prestige in the Sinoth Valley business that the subject could not be brought up?No; for he often talked about the Sinoth Valley.I decided that he was deliberately avoiding talk of shifgrethor because he wished to rouse emotions of a more elemental, uncontrollable kind.He wanted to stir up something which the whole shifgrethor pattern was a refinement upon, a sublimation of.He wanted his hearers to be frightened and angry.His themes were not pride and love at all, though he used the words perpetually; as he used them they meant self praise and hate.He talked a great deal about Truth also, for he was, he said, "cutting down beneath the veneer of civilization. "It is a durable, ubiquitous, specious metaphor, that one about veneer (or paint, or pliofilm, or whatever) hiding the nobler reality beneath.It can conceal a dozen fallacies at once.One of the most dangerous is the implication that civilization, being artificial, is unnatural: that it is the opposite of primitiveness...Of course there is no veneer, the process is one of growth, and primitiveness and civilization are degrees of the same thing.If civilization has an opposite, it is war.Of those two things, you have either one, or the other.Not both.It seemed to me as I listened to Tibe's dull fierce speeches that what he sought to do by fear and by persuasion was to force his people to change a choice they had made before their history began, the choice between those opposites.The time was ripe, perhaps.Slow as their material and technological advance had been, little as they valued "progress" in itself, they had finally, in the last five or ten or fifteen centuries, got a little ahead of Nature.They weren't absolutely at the mercy of their merciless climate any longer; a bad harvest would not starve a whole province, or a bad winter isolate every city.On this basis of material stability Orgoreyn had gradually built up a unified and increasingly efficient centralized state.Now Karhide was to pull herself together and do the same; and the way to make her do it was not by sparking her pride, or building up her trade, or improving her roads, farms, colleges, and so on; none of that; that's all civilization, veneer, and Tibe dismissed it with scorn.He was after something surer, the sure, quick, and lasting way to make people into a nation: war.His ideas concerning it could not have been too precise, but they were quite sound.The only other means of mobilizing people rapidly and entirely is with a new religion; none was handy; he would make do with war.I sent the Regent a note in which I quoted to him the question I had put to the Foretellers of Otherhord and the answer I had got.Tibe made no response.I then went to the Orgota Embassy and requested permission to enter Orgoreyn.There are fewer people running the offices of the Stabiles of the Ekumen on Hain than there were running that embassy of one small country to another, and all of them were armed with yards of soundtapes and records.They were slow, they were thorough; none of the slapdash arrogance and sudden deviousness that marked Karhidish officialdom.I waited, while they filled out their forms.The waiting got rather uneasy.The number of Palace Guards and city police on the streets of Erhenrang seemed to multiply every day; they were armed, and they were even developing a sort of uniform.The mood of the city was bleak, although business was good, prosperity general, and the weather fair.Nobody wanted much to do with me.My "landlady" no longer showed people my room, but rather complained about being badgered by "people from the Palace," and treated me less as an honored sideshow than as a political suspect.Tibe made a speech about a foray in the Sinoth Valley: "brave Karhidish farmers, true patriots," had dashed across the border south of Sassinoth, had attacked an Orgota village, burned it, and killed nine villagers, and then dragging the bodies back had dumped them into the Ey River, "such a grave," said the Regent, "as all the enemies of  our nation will find!"I heard this broadcast in the eating hall of my island.Some people looked grim as they listened, others uninterested, others satisfied, but in these various expressions there was one common element, a little tic or facial cramp that had not used to be there, a look of anxiety.That evening a man came to my room, my first visitor since I had returned to Erhenrang.He was slight, smooth skinned, shy mannered, and wore the gold chain of a Foreteller, one of the Celibates."I'm a friend of one who befriended you," he said, with the brusqueness of the timid, "I've come to ask you a favor, for his sake. ""You mean Faxe ?""No.Estraven. "My helpful expression must have changed.There was a little pause, after which the stranger said, "Estraven, the traitor.You remember him, perhaps?"Anger had displaced timidity, and he was going to play shifgrethor with me.If I wanted to play, my move was to say something like, "I'm not sure; tell me something about him. "But I didn't want to play, and was used to volcanic Karhidish tempers by now.I faced his anger deprecatingly and said, "Of course I do. ""But not with friendship. "His dark, down slanted eyes were direct and keen."Well, rather with gratitude, and disappointment.Did he send you to me?""He did not. "I waited for him to explain himself.He said, "Excuse me.I presumed; I accept what presumption has earned me. "I stopped the stiff little fellow as he made for the door."Please: I don't know who you are, or what you want.I haven't refused, I simply haven't consented.You must allow me the right to a reasonable caution.Estraven was exiled for supporting my mission here "  "Do you consider yourself to be in his debt for that?""Well, in a sense.However, the mission I am on overrides all personal debts and loyalties. ""If so," said the stranger with fierce certainty, "it is an immoral mission. "That stopped me.He sounded like an Advocate of the Ekumen, and I had no answer."I don't think it is," I said finally; "the shortcomings are in the messenger, not the message.But please tell me what it is you want me to do. ""I have certain monies, rents and debts, which I was able to collect from the wreck of my friend's fortune.Hearing that you were about to go to Orgoreyn, I thought to ask you to take the money to him, if you find him.As you know, it would be a punishable offense to do so.It may also be useless.He may be in Mishnory, or on one of their damnable Farms, or dead.I have no way of finding out.I have no friends in Orgoreyn, and none here I dared ask this of.I thought of you as one above politics, free to come and go.I did not stop to think that you have, of course, your own politics.I apologize for my stupidity. ""Well, I'll take the money for him.But if he's dead or can't be found, to whom shall I return it?"He stared at me.His face worked and changed, and he caught his breath in a sob.Most Karhiders cry easily, being no more ashamed of tears than of laughter.He said, "Thank you.My name is Foreth.I'm an Indweller at Orgny Fastness. ""You're of Estraven's clan?""No.Foreth rem ir Osboth: I was his kemmering. "Estraven had had no kemmering when I knew him, but I could rouse no suspicion of this fellow in myself.He might be unwittingly serving someone else's purpose, but he was genuine.And he had just taught me a lesson: that shifgrethor can be played on the level of ethics, and that the expert player will win.He had cornered me in about two moves.He had the money with him and gave it to me, a solid sum in Royal Karhidish Merchants' notes of credit, nothing to incriminate me, and consequently nothing to prevent me from simply spending it."If you find him ... "He stuck."A message?""No.Only if I knew...  ""If I do find him, I'll try to send news of him to you. ""Thank you," he said, and he held out both his hands to me, a gesture of friendship which in Karhide is not lightly made."I wish success to your mission, Mr.Ai.He Estraven he believed you came here to do good, I know.He believed it very strongly. "There was nothing in the world for this man outside Estraven.He was one of those who are damned to love once.I said again, "Is there no word from you that I might take him?""Tell him the children are well," he said, then hesitated, and said quietly,"Nusuth, no matter," and left me.Two days later I took the road out of Erhenrang, the northwest road this time, afoot.My permission to enter Orgoreyn had arrived much sooner than the clerks and officials of the Orgota Embassy had led me to expect or had themselves expected; when I went to get the papers they treated me with a sort of poisonous respect, resentful that protocol and regulations had, on somebody's authority, been pushed aside for me.As Karhide had no regulations at all about leaving the country, I set straight off.Over the summer I had learned what a pleasant land Karhide was for walking in.Roads and inns are set for foot traffic as well as for powered vehicles, and where inns are wanting one may count infallibly on the code of hospitality.Townsfolk of Co Domains and the villagers, farmers, or lord of any Domain will give a traveler food and lodging, for three days by the code, and in practice for much longer than that; and what's best is that you are always received without fuss, welcomed, as if they had been expecting you to come.I meandered across the splendid slanting land between the Sess and the Ey, taking my time, working out my keep a couple of mornings in the fields of the great Domains, where they were getting the harvest in, every hand and tool and machine at work to get the golden fields cut before the weather turned.It was all golden, all benign, that week of walking; and at night before I slept I would step out of the dark farmhouse or firelit Hearth Hall where I was lodged and walk a way into the dry stubble to look up at the stars, flaring like far cities in the windy autumn dark.In fact I was reluctant to leave this land, which I had found, though so indifferent to the Envoy, so gentle to the stranger.I dreaded starting all over, trying to repeat my news in a new language to new hearers, failing again perhaps.I wandered more north than west, justifying my course by a curiosity to see the Sinoth Valley region, the locus of the rivalry between Karhide and Orgoreyn.Though the weather held clear it began to grow colder, and at last I turned west before I got to Sassinoth, remembering that there was a fence across that stretch of border, and I might not be so easily let out of Karhide there.Here the border was the Ey, a narrow river but fierce, glacier fed like all rivers of the Great Continent.I doubled back a few miles south to find a bridge, and came on one linking two little villages, Passerer on the Karhide side and Siuwensin in Orgoreyn, staring sleepily at each other across the noisy Ey.The Karhidish bridge keeper asked me only if I planned to return that night, and waved me on across.On the Orgota side an Inspector was called out to inspect my passport and papers, which he did for about an hour, a Karhidish hour at that.He kept the passport, telling me I must call for it next morning, and gave me in place of it a permiso for meals and lodging at the Commensal Transient House of Siuwensin.I spent another hour in the office of the superintendent of the Transient House, while the superintendent read my papers and checked on the authenticity of my permiso by telephoning the Inspector at the Commensal Border Station from which I had just come.I can't properly define that Orgota word here translated as "commensal," "commensality. "Its root is a word meaning "to eat together. "Its usage includes all national/ governmental institutions of Orgoreyn, from the State as a whole through its thirty three component substates or Districts to the sub substates, townships, communal farms, mines, factories, and so on, that compose these.As an adjective it is applied to all the above; in the form "the Commensals" it usually means the thirty three Heads of Districts, who form the governing body, executive and legislative, of the Great Commensality of Orgoreyn, but it may also mean the citizens, the people themselves.In this curious lack of distinction between the general and specific applications of the word, in the use of it for both the whole and the part, the state and the individual, in this imprecision is its precisest meaning.My papers and my presence were at last approved, and by Fourth Hour I got my first meal since early breakfast supper: kadik porridge and cold sliced bread apple.For all its array of officials, Siuwensin was a very small, plain place, sunk deep in rural torpor.The Commensal Transient House was shorter than its name.Its dining room had one table, five chairs, and no fire; food was brought in from the village hot shop.The other room was the dormitory: six beds, a lot of dust, a little mildew.I had it to myself.As everybody in Siuwensin appeared to have gone to bed directly after supper, I did the same.I fell asleep in that utter country silence that makes your ears ring.I slept an hour and woke in the grip of a nightmare about explosions, invasion, murder, and conflagration.It was a particularly bad dream, the kind in which you run down a strange street in the dark with a lot of people who have no faces, while houses go up in flames behind you, and children scream.I ended up in an open field, standing in dry stubble by a black hedge.The dull red halfmoon and some stars showed through clouds overhead.The wind was bitter cold.Near me a big barn or granary bulked up in the dark, and in the distance beyond it I saw little volleys of sparks going up on the wind.I was bare legged and barefoot, in my shirt, without breeches, hieb, or coat; but I had my pack.It held not only spare clothes but also my rubies, cash, documents, papers, and ansible, and I  slept with it as a pillow when I traveled.Evidently I hung onto it even during bad dreams.I got out shoes and breeches and my furlined winter hieb, and dressed, there in the cold, dark country silence, while Siuwensin smoldered half a mile behind me.Then I struck out looking for a road, and soon found one, and on it, other people.They were refugees like me, but they knew where they were going.I followed them, having no direction of my own, except away from Siuwensin; which, I gathered as we walked, had been raided by a foray from Passerer across the bridge.They had struck, set fire, withdrawn; there had been no fight.But all at once lights glared down the dark at us, and scuttling to the roadside we watched a land caravan, twenty trucks, come at top speed out of the west toward Siuwensin and pass us with a flash of light and a hiss of wheels twenty times repeated; then silence and the dark again."We soon came to a communal farm center, where we were halted and interrogated.I tried to attach myself to the group I had followed down the road, but no luck; no luck for them either, if they did not have their identification papers with them.They, and I as a foreigner without passport, were cut out of the herd and given separate quarters for the night in a storage barn, a vast stone semi cellar with one door locked on us from outside, and no window.Now and then the door was unlocked and a new refugee thrust in by a farm policeman armed with the Gethenian sonic "gun. "The door shut, it was perfectly dark: no light.One's eyes, cheated of sight, sent starbursts and fiery blots whirling through the black.The air was cold, and heavy with the dust and odor of grain.No one had a handlight; these were people who had been routed out of their beds, like me; a couple of them were literally naked, and had been given blankets by others on the way.They had nothing.If they had had anything, it would have been their papers.Better to be naked than to lack papers, in Orgoreyn.They sat dispersed in that hollow, huge, dusty blindness.Sometimes two conversed a while, lowvoiced.There was no fellowfeeling of being prisoners together.There was no complaint.I heard one whisper to my left: "I saw him in the street, outside my door.His head was blown off. ""They use those guns that fire pieces of metal.Foray guns. ""Tiena said they were't from Passerer, but from Ovord Domain, come down by truck. ""But there isn't any quarrel between Ovord and Siuwensin... "They did not understand; they did not complain.They did not protest being locked up in a cellar by their fellow citizens after having been shot and burned out of their homes.They sought no reasons for what had happened to them.The whispers in the dark, random and soft, in the sinuous Orgota language that made Karhidish sound like rocks rattled in a can, ceased little by little.People slept.A baby fretted a while, away off in the dark, crying at the echo of its own cries.The door squealed open and it was broad day, sunlight like a knife in the eyes, bright and frightening.I stumbled out behind the rest and was mechanically following them when I heard my name.I had not recognized it; for one thing the Orgota could sayL.Someone had been calling it at intervals ever since the door was unlocked."Please come this way, Mr.Ai," said a hurried person in red, and I was no longer a refugee.I was set apart from those nameless ones with whom I had fled down a dark road and whose lack of identity I had shared all night in a dark room.I was named, known, recognized; I existed.It was an intense relief.I followed my leader gladly.The office of the Local Commensal Farm Centrality was hectic and upset, but they made time to look after me, and apologized to me for the discomforts of the night past."If only you had not chosen to enter the Commensality at Siuwensin!"lamented one fat Inspector, "if only you had taken the customary roads!"They did not know who I was or why I was to be given particular treatment; their ignorance was evident, but made no difference.Genly Ai, the Envoy, was to be treated as a distinguished person.He was.By mid afternoon I was on my way to Mishnory in a car put at my disposal by the Commensal Farm Centrality of East Homsvashom, District Eight.I had a new passport, and a free pass to all Transient Houses on my road, and a telegraphed invitation to the Mishnory residence of the First Commensal District Commissioner of Entry Roads and Ports, Mr.Uth Shusgis.The radio of the little car came on with the engine and ran while the car did; so all afternoon as I drove through the great level grainlands of East Orgoreyn, fenceless (for there are no herd beasts) and full of streams, I listened to the radio.It told me about the weather, the crops, road conditions; it cautioned me to drive carefully; it gave me various kinds of news from all thirty three Districts, the output of various factories, the shipping information from various sea and river ports; it singsonged some Yomesh chants, and then told me about the weather again.It was all very mild, after the ranting I had heard on the radio in Erhenrang.No mention was made of the raid on Siuwensin; the Orgota government evidently meant to prevent, not rouse, excitement.A brief official bulletin repeated every so often said simply that order was being and would be maintained along the Eastern Border.I liked that; it was reassuring and unprovocative, and had the quiet toughness that I had always admired in Gethenians: Order will be maintained...I was glad, now, to be out of Karhide, an incoherent land driven towards violence by a paranoid, pregnant king and an egomaniac Regent.I was glad to be driving sedately at twenty five miles an hour through vast, straight furrowed grain lands, under an even gray sky, towards a capital whose government believed in Order.The road was posted frequently (unlike the signless Karhidish roads on which you had to ask or guess your way) with directions to prepare to stop at the Inspection Station of such and such Commensal Area or Region; at these internal customs houses one's identification must be shown and one's passage recorded.My papers were valid to all examination, and I was politely waved on after minimal delay, and politely advised how far it was to the next Transient House if I wanted to eat or sleep.At 25 mph it is a considerable journey from the North Fall to Mishnory, and I spent two nights on the way.Food at the Transient Houses was dull but plentiful, lodging decent, lacking only privacy.Even that was supplied in some measure by the reticence of my fellow travelers.I did not strike up an acquaintance or have a real conversation at any of these halts, though I tried several times.The Orgota seemed not an unfriendly people, but incurious; they were colorless, steady, subdued.I liked them.I had had two years of color, choler, and passion in Karhide.A change was welcome.Following the east bank of the great River Kunderer I came on my third morning in Orgoreyn to Mishnory, the largest city on that world.In the weak sunlight between autumn showers it was a queer looking city, all blank stone walls with a few narrow windows set too high, wide streets that dwarfed the crowds, street lamps perched on ridiculous tall posts, roofs pitched steep as praying hands, shed roofs sticking out of housewalls eighteen feet above ground like big aimless bookshelves an ill proportioned, grotesque city, in the sunlight.It was not built for sunlight.It was built for winter.In winter, with those streets filled ten feet up with packed, hard rolled snow, the steep roofs icicle fringed, sleds parked under the shed roofs, narrow window slits shining yellow through driving sleet, you would see the fitness of that city, its economy, its beauty.Mishnory was cleaner, larger, lighter than Erhenrang, more open and imposing.Great buildings of yellowish white stone dominated it, simple stately blocks all built to a pattern, housing the offices and services of the Commensal Government and also the major temples of the Yomesh cult, which is promulgated by the Commensality.There was no clutter and contortion, no sense of always being under the shadow of something high and gloomy, as in Erhenrang; everything was simple, grandly conceived, and orderly.I felt as if I had come out of a dark age, and wished I had not wasted two years in Karhide.This, now, looked like a country ready to enter the Ekumenical Age.I drove about the city a while, then returned the car to the proper Regional Bureau and went on foot to the residence of the First Commensal District Commissioner of Entry Roads and Ports.I had never made quite sure whether the invitation was a request or a polite command.Nusuth.I was in Orgoreyn to speak for the Ekumen, and might as well begin here as anywhere.My notions of Orgota phlegm and self control were spoiled by Commissioner Shusgis, who advanced on me smiling and shouting, grabbed both my hands in the gesture which Karhiders reserve for moments of intense personal emotion, pumped my arms up and down as if trying to start a spark in my engine, and bellowed a greeting to the Ambassador of the Ekumen of the Known Worlds to Gethen.That was a surprise, for not one of the twelve or fourteen Inspectors who had studied my papers had shown any sign of recognizing my name or the terms Envoy or Ekumen all of which had been at least vaguely familiar to all Karhiders I had met.I had decided that Karhide had never let any broadcasts concerning me be used on Orgota stations, but had tried to keep me a national secret."Not Ambassador, Mr.Shusgis.Only an envoy. ""Future Ambassador, then.Yes, by Meshe!"Shusgis, a solid, beaming man, looked me up and down and laughed again."You're not what I expected, Mr.Ai!Nowhere near it.Tall as a street lamp, they said, thin as a sledge runner, soot black and slant eyed an ice ogre I expected, a monster!Nothing of the kind.Only you're darker than most of us. ""Earth colored," I said."And you were in Siuwensin the night of the foray?By the breasts of Meshe!what a world we live in.You might have been killed crossing the bridge over the Ey, after crossing all space to get here.Well!Well!You're here.And a lot of people want to see you, and hear you, and make you welcome to Orgoreyn at last. "He installed me at once, no arguments, in an apartment of his house.A high official and wealthy man, he lived in a style that has no equivalent in Karhide, even among lords of great Domains.Shusgis' house was a whole island, housing over a hundred employees, domestic servants, clerks, technical advisers, and so on, but no relatives, no kinfolk.The system of extended family clans, of Hearths and Domains, though still vaguely discernible in the Commensal structure, was 'nationalized' several hundred years ago in Orgoreyn.No child over a year old lives with its parent or parents; all are brought up in the Commensal Hearths.There is no rank by descent.Private wills are not legal: a man dying leaves his fortune to the state.All start equal.But obviously they don't go on so.Shusgis was rich, and liberal with his riches.There were luxuries in my rooms that I had not known existed on Winter for instance, a shower.There was an electric heater as well as a well stocked fireplace.Shusgis laughed: "They told me, keep the Envoy warm, he's from a hot world, an oven of a world, and can't stand our cold.Treat him as if he were pregnant, put furs on his bed and heaters in his room, heat his wash water and keep his windows shut!Will it do?Will you be comfortable?Please tell me what else you'd like to have here. "Comfortable!Nobody in Karhide had ever asked me, under any circumstances, if I was comfortable."Mr.Shusgis," I said with emotion, "I feel perfectly at home. "He wasn't satisfied till he had got another pesthry fur blanket on the bed, and more logs into the fireplace."I know how it is," he said, "when I was pregnant I couldn't keep warm my feet were like ice, I sat over the fire all that winter.Long ago of course, but I remember!"Gethenians tend to have their children young; most of them, after the age of twenty four or so, use contraceptives, and they cease to be fertile in the female phase at about forty.Shusgis was in his fifties, therefore his "long ago of course,"!and it certainly was difficult to imagine him as a young mother.He was a hard shrewd jovial politician, whose acts of kindness served his interest and whose interest was himself.His type is panhuman.I had met him on Earth, and on Hain, and on Ollul.I expect to meet him in Hell."You're well informed as to my looks and tastes, Mr.Shusgis.I'm flattered; I thought my reputation hadn't preceded me. ""No," he said, understanding me perfectly, "they'd just as soon have kept you buried under a snowdrift, there in Erhenrang, eh?But they let you go, they let you go; and that's when we realized, here, that you weren't just another Karhidish lunatic but the real thing. ""I don't follow you, I think. ""Why, Argaven and his crew were afraid of you, Mr.Ai afraid of you and glad to see your back.Afraid if they mishandled you, or silenced you, there might be retribution.A foray from outer space, eh!So they didn't dare touch you.And they tried to hush you up.Because they're afraid of you and of what you bring to Gethen!"It was exaggerated; I certainly hadn't been censored out of the Karhidish news, at least so long as Estraven was in power.But I already had the impression that for some reason news hadn't got around about me much in Orgoreyn, and Shusgis confirmed my suspicions."Then you aren't afraid of what I bring to Gethen?""No, we're not, sir!""Sometimes I am. "He chose to laugh jovially at that.I did not qualify my words.I'm not a salesman, I'm not selling Progress to the Abos.We have to meet as equals, with some mutual understanding and candor, before my mission can even begin."Mr.Ai, there are a lot of people waiting to meet you, bigwigs and little ones, and some of them are the ones you'll be wanting to talk to here, the people who get things done.I asked for the honor of receiving you because I've got a big house and because I'm well known as a neutral sort of fellow, not a Dominator and not an Open Trader, just a plain Commissioner who does his job and won't lay you open to any talk about whose house you're staying in. "He laughed."But that means you'll be eating out a good deal, if you don't mind. ""I'm at your disposal, Mr.Shusgis. ""Then tonight it'll be a little supper with Vanake Slose. ""Commensal from Kuwera Third District, is it?"Of course I had done some homework before I came.He fussed over my condescension in deigning to learn anything about his country.Manners here were certainly different from manners in Karhide; there, the fuss he was making would either have degraded his own shifgrethor or insulted mine; I wasn't sure which, but it would have done one or the other practically everything did.I needed clothes fit for a dinner party, having lost my good Erhenrang suit in the raid on Siuwensin, so that afternoon I took a Government taxi downtown and brought myself an Orgota rig.Hieb and shirt were much as in Karhide, but instead of summer breeches they wore thigh high leggings the year round, baggy and cumbrous; the colors were loud blues or reds, and the cloth and cut and make were all a little shoddy.It was standardized work.The clothes showed me what it was that this impressive, massive city lacked: elegance.Elegance is a small price to pay for enlightenment, and I was glad to pay it.I went back to Shusgis' house and reveled in the hot showerbath, which came at one from all sides in a kind of prickly mist.I thought of the cold tin tubs of East Karhide that I had chattered and shuddered in last summer, the ice ringed basin in my Erhenrang room.Was that elegance?Long live comfort!I put on my gaudy red finery, and was driven with Shusgis to the supper party in his chauffeured private car.There are more servants, more services in Orgoreyn than in Karhide.This is because all Orgota are employees of the state; the state must find employment for all citizens, and does so.This, at least, is the accepted explanation, though like most economic explanations it seems, under certain lights, to omit the main point.Commensal Slose's fiercely lighted, high, white reception room held twenty or thirty guests, three of them Commensals and all of them evidently notables of one kind or another.This was more than a group of Orgota curious to see "the alien. "I was not a curiosity, as I had been for a whole year in Karhide; not a freak; not apuzzle.I was, it seemed, a key.What door was I to unlock?Some of them had a notion, these statesmen and officials who greeted me effusively, but I had none.I wouldn't find out during supper.All over Winter, even in frozen barbarian Perunter, it is considered execrably vulgar to talk business while eating.As supper was served promptly I postponed my questions and attended to a gummy fish soup and to my host and fellow guests.Slose was a frail, youngish person, with unusually light, bright eyes and a muted, intense voice; he looked like an idealist, a dedicated soul.I liked his manner, but I wondered what it was he was dedicated to.On my left sat another Commensal, a fat faced fellow named Obsle.He was gross, genial, and inquisitive.By the third sip of soup he was asking me what the devil was I really born on some other world what was it like there warmer than Gethen, everybody said how warm?"Well, in this same latitude on Terra, it never snows. ""It never snows.It never snows?"He laughed with real enjoyment, as a child laughs at a good lie, encouraging further flights."Our sub arctic regions are rather like your habitable zone; we're farther out of our last Ice Age than you, but not out, you see.Fundamentally Terra and Gethen are very much alike.All the inhabited worlds are.Men can live only within a narrow range of environments; Geth en's at one extreme...  ""Then there are worlds hotter than yours?""Most of them are warmer.Some are hot; Gde, for instance.It's mostly sand and rock desert.It was warm to start with, and an exploitive civilization wrecked its natural balances fifty or sixty thousand years ago, burned up the forests for kindling, as it were.There are still people there, but it resembles if I understand the Text  the Yomesh idea of where thieves go after death. "That drew a grin from Obsle, a quiet, approving grin which made me suddenly revise my estimation of the man."Some subcultists hold that those Afterlife Interims are actually, physically situated on other worlds, other planets of the real universe.Have you met with that idea, Mr.Ai?""No; I've been variously described, but nobody's yet explained me away as a ghost. "As I spoke I chanced to look to my right, and saying "ghost" saw one.Dark, in dark clothing, still and shadowy, he sat at my elbow, the specter at the feast.Obsle's attention had been taken up by his other neighbor, and most people were listening to Slose at the head of the table.I said in a low voice, "I didn't expect to see you here, Lord Estraven. ""The unexpected is what makes life possible," he said."I was entrusted with a message for you. "He looked inquiring."It takes the form of money some of your own  Foreth rem ir Osboth sends it.I have it with me, at Mr.Shusgis' house.I'll see that it comes to you. ""It's kind of you, Mr.Ai.He was quiet, subdued, reduced a banished man living off his wits in a foreign land.He seemed disinclined to talk with me, and I was glad not to talk with him.Yet now and then during that long, heavy, talkative supper party, though all my attention was given to those complex and powerful Orgota who meant to befriend or use me, I was sharply aware of him: of his silence: of his dark averted face.And it crossed my mind, though I dismissed the idea as baseless, that I had not come to Mishnory to eat roast blackfish with the Commensals of my own free will; nor had they brought me here.He had.9.Estraven the Traitor  An East Karhidish tale, as told in Gorinhering by Tobord Chorhawa and recorded by G. A.  The story is well known in various versions, and a 'habben' play based on it is in the repertory of traveling players east of the Kargav.LONG AGO, BEFOREthe days of King Argaven I who made Karhide one kingdom, there was blood feud between the Domain of Stok and the Domain of Estre in Kerm Land.The feud had been fought in forays and ambushes for three generations, and there was no settling it, for it was a dispute over land.Rich land is scarce in Kerm, and a Domain's pride is in the length of its borders, and the lords of Kerm Land are proud men and umbrageous men, casting black shadows.It chanced that the heir of the flesh of the Lord of Estre, a young man, skiing across Icefoot Lake in the month of Irrem hunting pesthry, came onto rotten ice and fell into the lake.Though by using one ski as a lever on a firmer ice edge he pulled himself up out of the water at last, he was in almost as bad case out of the lake as in it, for he was drenched, the air waskurem ,*  Kurem, damp weather, 0 to  20 F.   and night was coming on.He saw no hope of reaching Estre eight miles away uphill, and so set off towards the village of Ebos on the north shore of the lake.As night fell the fog flowed down off the glacier and spread out all across the lake, so that he could not see his way, nor where to set his skis.Slowly he went for fear of rotten ice, yet in haste, because the cold was at his bones and before long he would not be able to move.He saw at last a light before him in the night and fog.He cast off his skis, for the lakeshore was rough going and bare of snow in places.
