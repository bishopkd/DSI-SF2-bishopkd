They were only a few minutes from West Fallbrook and Bob's place.The Mysterious Stranger seemed to watch the scenery for a few moments.Then: "I really wanted to get a head start on things today, but if you insist on hard evidence" He gestured and something flashed in the air between them.Normally that indicated that data had been passed."Take a look at those references.And here's proof that I was largely behind the breakthroughs described. ""I'll take a look and get back to you. ""Please don't take too long, Professor.What your merry crew is planning is dead on arrival without your prompt help.And I need that if I am to help you. "His car turned onto Honor Court and slowed to a stop just beyond Bob's house.It wasn't even 4:30, but the ocean haze had moved in and things were getting dark.Little clusters of children were playing here and there along the street.God only knew what they were seeing.Robert stepped into the chill air and  there was Miri pedaling a bicycle up the street toward him.They stared at each other awkwardly.At least, Robert felt awkward.Normally they didn't see each other except with Bob or Alice.In the old days, I never would have felt an instant's discomfort for blasting this child .But somehow the concerted anger of Bob and Alice  and Miri's own stiff necked courtesy  made him very uncomfortable.I can't stay here, owing children who should owe me .Miri slid off her bike and stood beside him.She was looking into the car.Robert glanced at the departing vehicle.He could see Sharif still sitting in the backseat; maybe she could too."That's Zulfikar Sharif," Robert said, rushing into explanations like the guilty soul he was."He's interviewing me about the old days. ""Oh. "She seemed to lose interest."Hey, Miri, I didn't know you had a bike. "She walked the bike along beside him."Yes," she replied seriously."It's not good for transportation, but Alice says that I need exercise.I like to ride around Fallbrook and game out the latest realities. "Thanks to the miracle of Epiphany, Robert could guess what she was talking about."In fact, it's not really my bike.This is Bob's, from when he was younger than I am. "The tires looked new, but  his eyes traveled over the aluminum frame, the peeling green and yellow paint job.Lord .Lena had insisted they buy this bike for the boy.Memories of little Bobby came back, of when he was trying so hard to learn to ride.He had been such a nuisance.They walked the rest of the way to the door in silence, Robert lagging a bit behind his granddaughter.16    The Front Bathroom Incident  Winston Blount called a couple of times during the next few days.His cabal was very anxious to talk further about "what we talked about. "Robert put him off and refused to talk privately.He could almost hear Winnie's teeth grinding in frustration  but the guy gave him another week.Robert had several more interviews with the real  well, he could hope it was the real  Sharif.They were a heartwarming reminder of the Good Years, and totally unlike his encounters with the Mysterious Stranger.The young grad student gushed semi intelligent enthusiasm, except that sometimes he seemed fond of science fiction.Sometimes.When Robert mentioned this, Sharif looked stricken.Ah .The Mysterious Stranger strikes again.Or maybe there were three entities animating the image of Zulfikar Sharif.Robert began to track each word, each nuance.Juan Orozco's compositions had blossomed.He could write complete sentences intentionally.The boy seemed to think that this made Robert Gu a genius of a teacher.Yes, and someday soon there will he chimpanzees who look up to me .But that thought did not escape Robert's lips.Juan Orozco was working to his limits.He was doomed to mediocrity, much as Robert himself, and spreading the pain of such knowledge was not appealing anymore.The Mysterious Stranger stayed out of sight.Maybe he thought Robert's own need was the best salesman.The bastard.Robert returned again and again to the references the Stranger had given him.They described three medical miracles of the last ten months.One was an effective treatment for malaria.That was not such a big deal, since cheaper cures had existed for years.But the other two breakthroughs related to mood and intellectual disorders.They were not examples of Reed Weber's random "heavenly minefield. "Both had been commissioned by the customers they cured.So what ?Miracles happened in this modern age.What proof was there the Stranger could create them?He pulled up the documents the Stranger had given him.Their visual represention was as medieval letters of credit, envelopes sealed with wax.If one broke the metaphor, it was easy to look inside and see the lower layers, a few megabytes of encryption.Useless nonsense.But if you followed the metaphor from the top, then you found pointers to magic tools to employ the certificates, and other pointers to the technical papers that explained what these tools actually did with the underlying data.For three days now, Robert had been digging through those papers.The old Robert would not have had the intellect for this.God had taken away his true and unique genius, and perversely given him this analytical talent in return.Playing with protocols was fun.Okay, another couple of days and he would put it all together  and call the Stranger's bluff.Meantime, he was falling further behind in his work with Juan for Chumlig's composition class."Will you have time to work on my graphics suggestions?"Juan asked one afternoon."Before tomorrow, I mean. "That was when their current weekly project was due."Yes, sure. "The kid had been great about working to Robert's directions.He felt a sliver of shame for not reciprocating."I mean, I'll try.I've got this problem with some outside things"  "Oh, what?Can I help?"Lord ."Some security documents.They're supposed to prove that a, um, friend of mine was really involved in solving a game problem. "He made one of them visible to Juan.The kid looked at the wax and gilt and parchment."Oh!A creditat.I've seen certs like that.You  oops, yours has an outer envelope so only you can do all the steps, but see  " He grabbed the certificate and pointed where Robert should do what. "you gotta apply your own stamp first, and then you tear along the server line and you'll see a release like this. "Phantom transformations spread in the air around him."And if this friend of yours is not blowing smoke, you'll see bright green here and there'll be a written description of his contribution, backed by Microsoft or Bank of America or whoever. "Then Juan had to go help his mother.As he faded away, Robert studied the examples.He recognized some of the steps from the protocol descriptions, but, "How did you know all that?"Foolish question.The boy looked a little startled."It's just  it's just kind of intuitive, you know?I think that's the way the interface is designed. "And then he was completely gone.No one was home right now, so Robert went downstairs and fixed himself a snack.Then he played back the steps the boy had shown him.He had no excuse for further delay.He hesitated a moment more then applied the steps to each of the "creditats. "Bright green.Bright green.Bright green.The Mysterious Stranger didn't like to come visiting when Robert was indoors at home.Maybe the USMC was not as incompetent as the Stranger claimed.Robert began to look forward to his time away from home with anticipation and dread.Very soon he must decide.Was betrayal a price he could pay for a chance to be his old self once more?Days passed.Still no contact.The Stranger wants me ripe for the picking .When it finally happened, Robert was walking around the neighborhood, doing another interview with Zulfikar Sharif.The young man hesitated in the middle of a question and looked at him.Miri  > Juan: <sm>I'm locked out!</sm>  Juan  > Miri: <sm>Again?</sm>  Miri  > Juan: <sm>Yes again!</sm>  Sharif's earnest features took on the sly, greenish cast of the Mysterious Stranger."How is it going, my man?"Robert managed a cool response."Well enough. "The Stranger smiled."You look a bit peaked, Professor.Perhaps you'd be more comfortable sitting down. "A car slid to a stop beside them.The door opened and the phantom graciously waved Robert inside."This is more secure?"Robert said as they pulled away from the curb."This car is.Remember, I have powers far greater than your little friends. "He settled in the back facing seat."So.Have you convinced yourself that I can help you?""Maybe you can," said Robert, a little bit proud of how level his voice sounded."I checked your creditats.You don't seem to know anything about anything, but you have this knack for bringing the right people together and being around when those people solve serious problems. "The Stranger waved his hand dismissively."I don't know anything about anything?You are naive, Professor.Our world is overflowing with technical expertise.Knowledge is piled metaphorical light years deep.Given that, the truly golden skill is the one I possess  to bring together the knowledge and abilities that make solutions.Your Ms.Chumlig understands that.Schoolkids certainly understand.Even Tommie Parker understands, though he has one important detail backwards.In me," another elaborate gesture, his hand flattening against his turtleneck shirt, "in me, you have the far extreme of this ability.I am world class at 'bringing together to get answers. '"And with an ego to match.How does he get his way when he's dealing with the Einsteins and Hawkings of this era?Surely he doesn't have everyone by the short hairs ?The Stranger leaned forward."But enough of me.Winnie Blount and his 'Elder Cabal' are getting desperate.I'm not exactly desperate, but if you delay more than another few days, I cannot guarantee an acceptable outcome.So.Are you on board or not?""I  Yes.I am. "Twenty years ago, betraying Bob would not have bothered him.After all, the idiot was an ingrate.Now, no glib excuse rose to mind, but I'll do anything to recover what I lost ."What is this biometric information you want on Alice?""Some sonograms we can't take in public.A microgram blood spot. "The Mysterious Stranger pointed at a small box that lay on the seat between them."Take a look. "Robert reached down and his fingers touched something hard and cool.The box was real.That was a first for the Mysterious Stranger.He took a closer look.It was gray plastic without any openings or even virtual labels.Wait, there was the ubiquitous "no user serviceable parts within. ""So?""So, leave that in your front bathroom this evening.It will do the rest. ""I won't do anything to hurt Alice. "The Stranger laughed."Such paranoia.The point of all this is to pass unnoticed.Alice Gu is in public places several times a week.If ill were wished her, those would be the opportunities to take advantage of.But you and the cabal just need biometrics Any other questions?""Not just now. "Robert slipped the gray plastic box into his pocket."I just can't imagine that twenty first century military security can be duped by something as simple as a drop of blood and some sonograms. "The Stranger laughed."Oh, there's much more to it than that.Tommie Parker thinks he's covering the angles, but without my help you four would not even get into the steam tunnels. "He looked at Robert's stiff expression and laughed again."Think of your part as being the user interface. "He gave a little bow."And I am the user. "Robert made a point of taking the Stranger's gadget through the front hallway bug trap.The small box triggered no alarms he could see.So betrayal was as simple as walking into the first floor bathroom and setting the box down among the bags and aerosols and squeeze tubes that were already piled on the side counter.Modern bed and bath products were a bastion of old style physical advertising.After all, even the most modern folks had to take off their clothes and their contacts somewhere.But Alice and Bob had no style.They bought the cheapest commodity products they could find.The devil box fit right in.Robert took a long shower.It would be nice to feel clean.He heard no strange sounds, saw nothing strange through the frosted glass.But when he came out of the shower, he noticed that there was no mysterious gray box either.Even when he pawed around the counter, touching every object there  there was no sign of the intrusion.The bathroom door had been shut the whole time.Someone knocked on the door, happily following the family rules about not snooping through bathroom walls."Robert, are you okay?"It was Miri."Alice says it's dinnertime. "Dinner was a nightmare.It was always tense when the four of them ate together.Usually, Robert could avoid such get togethers, but Alice seemed determined to see him with the whole family at least once a week.Robert knew what she was up to.She was recalibrating, deciding if now she could lower the boom on her father in law.Tonight she was steelier than ever, and it didn't help that Robert had serious things to hide.Maybe she had some special reason to be suspicious.He noticed that Bob and Miri were doing all the running back and forth to the kitchen.Usually Alice helped with that.Tonight she sat herself down in her usual place, and grilled Robert in her merciless, casual way: how was school going, what about the project with Juan.She even asked about his "old friends," for God's sake!And Robert explained and smiled and prayed he was passing the test.The old Robert never had trouble stringing people along !Then Bob and Miri were sitting down to eat.Alice shifted her attention from her villainous father in law.She chatted with Miri in the same friendly, interested tones she had used with Robert.Miri replied with precision, a detailed summary of just who and what was good and bad at school.For a while Robert almost relaxed.After all, they were here to eat.Surely that couldn't give him away.But something was up, and it wasn't just his imagination.Bob and Alice got into a discussion of San Diego politics, a school bond issue.But there was an edgy undercurrent; some couples really argue politics, but this was the first time Robert had ever heard that from these two.And every so often Alice's clothing flickered .Around the house in the real world, Alice Gu wore a dumpy hausfrau dress that wouldn't have been out of place in the 1950s.When she flickered, it was virtual imagery, nothing like Carlos's old fashioned smart T shirts.The first time it happened, Robert almost didn't notice  partly because neither Bob or Miri reacted.Half a minute later  as Alice gestured emphatically about some outstandingly trivial election issue  there was another flicker.For an instant she was dressed in something like naval whites, but the collar insignia said "PHS. "PHS ?There were lots of different Google hits on the abbreviation.A minute or two passed, and she was briefly a USMC full colonel.That , Robert had seen before, since it was her true rank.Bob said mildly, "You're emoting, dear. ""It doesn't matter," Alice said curtly."You know that.The point is"  and she continued chewing on the school bond issue.But her gaze wandered around the room, eventually riveting on Robert.It was not a friendly gaze, and even though her words were unrelated to Robert Gu there was a sharpness in her voice.Then, for almost two seconds, she was wearing a civilian business suit with an old fashioned ID lanyard.The ID bore a familiar seal and the letters DHS.Robert knew what that meant.It was all he could do not to flinch back.She can't know everything !He wondered if Alice and Bob were silently coordinating all the scary signs, conspiring to panic him into confession.Somehow, he didn't think Bob was that adept.So Robert just nodded and glanced casually around.Miri had been quieter than usual.She was staring off into the distance, and looked as bored as a thirteen year old can look when she's trapped at home with her parents rattling on about Things Not Important.But this was Miri Gu, and this was not the twentieth century.Most likely she was surfing, though usually she disguised such absences when she was at the dinner table.Alice slapped the table, and Robert's eyes jerked back to her.She was glaring at him."Don't you agree, Robert?"Even Louise Chumlig couldn't glare more aggressively than that."Sorry.My mind wandered, Alice. "She waved her hand abruptly."It doesn't matter. "And then golden letters spread silently across the air.Miri  > Robert: <sm>Don't worry.She's not mad at you.</sm>  Miri was still gazing into nowhere.Her hands were in plain sight and motionless.She was that good with her clothes.Okay, but what in hell is going on here ?That was the message he wanted to send back, but short of finger tapping, the best he could do was give her a quizzical look.Alice rattled on, interrupted occasionally by Bob, but now Robert was not living in stark terror.He waited another three or four minutes, and then excused himself.Bob looked a little relieved."We don't have to talk so much about the bond issue, Robert.There are other  "  "No, that's okay.I'm the fellow with homework these days. "Robert pasted on a smile and retreated up the stairs.He felt Alice's rifled gaze following him every step.If not for Miri's silent message, he would have run up the stairs.And so far, Alice hadn't ventured near the front bathroom.He did have homework.Juan came over and distracted him for almost half an hour with his explanations of immersive outlines.Robert was supposed to have such an outline ready for tomorrow's progress report in Chumlig's class.Juan went away pleased.So was Robert; he had made up for several days of inattention.He fooled around with Juan's templates till he could implement everything.By God, we should be getting an A for cross support .The kid's prose had become almost serviceable  and this immersive he had constructed, it was beautiful.He was aware of Miri helping to clean up after dinner and then coming up to her room.Bob and Alice were just sitting in the living room.He set an activity alarm on the first floor, and for a while he forgot himself in the making of more and better refinements to his graphics.Lord !An hour had passed!He took a quick glance downstairs.Nobody had been to the front John.There was a pending message from Tommie Parker.The cabal wanted to know when or if he was going to come through with his contribution.He looked downstairs again.Strange.He couldn't see into the living room anymore.Normally that was on the house menu, but now it was as private as the bedrooms.He stood and walked over to the door, quietly eased it open half an inch, snooping the good old fashioned way.They were arguing!And Bob was white hot.His voice grew louder and louder, finally breaking into enraged shouting."I don't give a fuck if they do need you!It's always just one more time.But this time you've  "  Bob hesitated in midflame.Robert leaned forward, ear to the door.Nothing.Not even the mumble of circumspect speech.Son and daughter in law had taken their spat into ethereal realms.But Robert continued to listen.He could hear the two moving around.At one point, there was the sound of a hand slapping down like a pistol shot.Alice whacking the dinner table?There was half a minute of silence and then a door slammed.Vision returned a second after that.Bob was alone in the living room, staring at the door of the ground floor den.He stood there for a few moments, then circled the living room and dropped himself down in his favorite chair.He pulled a book off the coffee table.That was one of the three physical books downstairs  and even it was a just in time fake.Robert Gu quietly shut his bedroom door and returned to his chair.He thought a moment, then tapped on his virtual keypad.Robert  > Miri: <sm>What was that all about?</sm>  Miri was twenty feet down the hall.So why didn't he just walk a few feet and knock on her door?Or present virtually?Maybe it was the habit of staying out of her way.Maybe it was easier to hide behind words.Maybe he wasn't the only one hiding.It was almost a minute before a reply floated back.Miri  > Robert: <sm>They're not mad at you.</sm>  Robert  > Miri: <sm>Okay.But what is the problem?</sm>  Miri  > Robert: <sm>There is no problem.</sm> That was the whole message, but then Miri sent another.Miri  > Robert: <sm>Alice is getting ready for some new job.That's always hard on her.And then Bob gets mad.</sm> There was another pause.Miri  > Robert: <sm>This is Corps business, Robert.I'm not supposed to know about it.You're even more not.I'm sorry.EOR</sm>  EOR That was space cadet for "that's all she wrote. "Robert waited; nothing more came.But this had been more real conversation with Miri than he'd had in two months.What did that little girl do with her secrets?They were surely more significant than he had ever guessed.She had better communications facilities than all of twentieth century civilization, but her prissy standards kept her from sharing her pain.Or maybe she has friends she can talk to ?Robert Gu, Sr., didn't have any friends, but he didn't need any; tonight he had plenty of crisis and suspense to distract him.He kept an eye on the front bathroom, and another on the door to the den.Bob was still reading, every so often sliding a look of his own at the den."Is now a good time for us to talk, Professor?"The voice came from just behind his shoulder.The shock all but levitated Robert from his chair.He swung on the sound."Jeez!"It was Zulfikar Sharif.Sharif backed away, startlement in his face."You could have knocked," Robert said."I did, Professor. "Sharif sounded faintly hurt."Yes, yes. "Robert still hadn't figured out all the quirks of Epiphany's "circle of friends" feature.He gestured for Sharif to stay."What's on your mind?"Sharif did a creditable job of sitting on a chair without sinking halfway through."Well, I was hoping we could just talk. "He thought a moment."I mean, we might continue with my questions about your Secrets of the Ages"  Still no action downstairs.  "Very well.Ask. "So who is this ?True Sharif?Stranger Sharif?SciFi Sharif?Or some ungodly combination?Whatever, it was too much coincidence that he showed up just now.Robert sat back to watch and listen."um I don't know. "Miserably forgetful?But then Sharif abruptly perked up."Ah!One thing I'm hoping to get at in my thesis is the balance of worth between the beauty of expression and the beauty of underlying truth.Are they separate?"A question to be answered in cryptic depth .Robert paused significantly and then launched into flimflam."You should know by now, Zulfi, even if you can't create poetry yourself, that the issues can't be separated.Beauty captures truth.Read my essay in the Carolingian .  "blah blahblah  Sharif nodded earnestly."Then do you ever expect an end to one and therefore the other?Beauty and truth, I mean?"Huh ?Now, that was sufficiently bizarre to derail him.Robert parsed and reparsed the stupidity.Will you run out of beauty?And the answer for me is yes; I cant create beauty anymore .So maybe this was just Stranger Sharif jerking him around while they both waited for the little gray box to do its thing."I suppose there could be an end. "And then he thought about the other half of the question."Hell, Sharif, truth  new truth  ended long ago.We artists sit atop a midden ten thousand years deep.The diligent ones of us know everything of significance that's ever been done.We churn and churn, and some of us do it brilliantly, but it's just a glittering rehash. "Did I just say that ?"And if they're linked, then beauty is gone too?"Sharif had leaned forward his elbows on his legs, his chin cupped in his hands.His eyes were large and serious.Robert looked away.Finally, he choked out, "There is still beauty.I will bring it back. "I will regain it .Sharif smiled, mistaking Robert's assertion for some general faith in humankind in the future?"That's wonderful, Professor.This goes beyond your essay in the Carolingian . ""Indeed. "Robert sat back, wondering just what in heaven's name was going on.Sharif hesitated a moment, as if uncertain where to go next."At the UCSD library, how has your project there progressed?"Still no action downstairs.Robert said, "You see some connection between my art and the Librareome?""Well, yes.I don't want to intrude, but ultimately what you do at UCSD seems to be very much a statement about the position of art and literature in the modern world. "Maybe this was SciFi Sharif, trying to figure out what Stranger Sharif was up to.If only I could use one against the other .He gave his visitor a judicious nod."I'll talk to my friends about this.Maybe we can arrange something. "That seemed to satisfy whoever it was.They set a time for another chat, and then the visitor was gone.Robert turned off circle of friends access.No more surprise visitations tonight.And downstairs, there was still no action.He watched through the walls for almost fifteen minutes.That was certainly a productive use of time.Think about something else, damn it .He blew off the top of the house and looked across West Fallbrook.Un enhanced, the place was very dark, more like an abandoned town than a living suburb.The real San Diego had less skyglow than he remembered from the 1970s.But behind that real view were unending alternatives, all the cyberspace fun Bob's generation could have ever imagined.Hundreds of millions were playing out there tonight.Robert could feel  Epiphany could make him feel  the thrum of it, beckoning.Instead he tapped out a command Chumlig had mentioned; here and there across North County, tiny lights glowed.Those were the other students in his classes, at least the ones who were studying tonight and had any interest in what the others were doing.Twenty little lights.That was more than two thirds of the class, a special kind of belief circle, one dedicated to pushing up their cooperation scores as far as possible.He hadn't appreciated how hard these little third raters were working.Robert ghosted over the suburbs, toward the nearest of the lights.He hadn't tried Epiphany's "out of body" feature before.There was no feeling of air flowing past, or motion.It was just his synthetic viewpoint slewing across the landscape.He could still feel his butt on the chair in his bedroom.And yet he understood why the directions said to do this sitting down.The viewpoint swooped down into a valley with a speed that was dizzying.He drifted into a welcoming window.Juan Orozco and Mahmoud Kwon and a couple of others were gathered in a family room, marking out possibilities for tomorrow's exchange with Capetown.They looked up and said hi, but Robert could tell they weren't seeing much more than his icon hovering in the room.He could be present virtually, perhaps even look as "real" as Sharif usually did.But Robert just hung in the air, listening to the talk for a few moments and   Alarm notification!He cut the connection and was back in his bedroom.Downstairs, Bob had wandered out of the living room.He stood by Alice's door and knocked gently.As far as Robert could tell there was no answer.After a moment, Bob tucked his chin in and turned away.Robert tracked him up the stairs.The sounds of footsteps came down the hall.Bob knocked on Miri's door, the way he did most evenings.There was mumbled conversation, and Miri's voice saying, "G'night, Daddy. "It was the first Robert had heard her call Bob that.Bob's footsteps came nearer; he paused at Robert's door, but he didn't say anything.Robert watched him through the wall as Bob turned and was swallowed up by the privacy of the master bedroom.Robert hunched over his desk and stared into the downstairs.Alice hardly ever stayed up much beyond Bob.Of course, tonight was not your usual night.Damn.You screw your courage up to an act of family betrayal  and then fate dumps problems all over your dishonorable intent.But even if Alice camped out in the den, eventually she'd have to use the bathroom.Right?Twenty minutes passed.Alice's door opened.She stepped out, turned toward the stairs.Use the ground floor bathroom, damn you .She turned again and paced angrily around the living room.Paced?There was precision and power in every motion, like a dancer or a martial arts nut.Not like dumpy frumpy Alice Gong Gu, she of the mild round face and the shapeless dress.And yet this was the real view.It was her real face, even if it was tense with pain, and drenched in sweat.Huh?Robert tried to follow her gliding dance in close up.The woman was dripping sweat.Her dress was soaked, as if she had just finished a long, frantic run.Like Carlos Rivera.It couldn't be.Alice never got stuck in a foreign language, or in a particular specialty.In any one particular specialty.But he remembered the web discussion of JITT.What about the few strange people who could "train" more than once, who became ever more multitalented, until the side effects finally destroyed them?Where would such wretches get "stuck" if there were dozens of imprints to fall into?Alice's gliding dance slowed, stopped.She stood for a moment with her head bowed, her shoulders heaving.Then she turned and walked slowly into the front bathroom.Finally, finally.And now I should he overcome with relief .Instead, revelation bounced back and forth in his mind.This explained so many little mysteries.It contradicted several certainties.Maybe Alice hadn't been gunning for him.Maybe she was no more his enemy than anyone in this house.Sometimes things are not as they seem.It was very quiet.The old house in Palo Alto had had little squeaks and thumps, and sometimes Bob's PC playing stolen music.Here, tonight yes, there were occasional sounds, the house settling into the cool of the evening.Wait.In the utility view, he saw that one of the water heaters had kicked in.He could hear running water.Not for the first time, Robert wondered what kind of magic that little gray box was.It had not triggered the house watchdogs.Maybe it wasn't electronic at all, but nineteenth century gears and cogs driven by a metal spring.Then it had disappeared from Robert's own naked eyesight.That was something new, not a visual trick.Maybe the box had sprouted little legs and scurried off.But whatever it was, what would it finally do ?Maybe the Stranger didn't need a little blood.Maybe a lot of blood would suit him more.Robert sat stock still for a second and then bolted to his feet  and froze again.I was so desperate .Credibility is not important if the victim wants to believe so hard that truth must be what the liar claims.So the Stranger had mocked the notion that hurting Alice would be worth such hugger mugger.And I, desperate, smiled and was convinced .Robert was out of his room, and flying down the stairs.He dashed through the living room and pounded on the bathroom door."Alice!Al  "  The door opened.Alice was looking at him, a bit wide eyed.He grabbed her arm and dragged her into the hallway.Alice was not a large woman; she came easily in his grasp.But then she turned, taking him off balance.Somehow his feet got tangled in hers and he slammed into the doorjamb."What!Is it?"she said, sounding irritated."I  " Robert looked over his shoulder, into the brightly lit bathroom, then back at Alice.She was dressed in a robe now, and her short hair looked as though she had washed it.And everybody is still in one piece.No pools of blood except maybe where my head hit the doorjamb ."Are you okay, Robert?"Concern seemed to rise above her irritation.Robert felt the back of his head."Yeah, yes.I'm pretty robust these days. "He thought about how he'd come down the stairs.Even when he was seventeen years old, he had never skipped four steps at a time."But  " Alice began.Clearly she was more concerned about his mental state than anything else.It's okay, Daughter in Law.I thought I was stopping your murder, and now I find it's a false alarm .Somehow he didn't think that would be a satisfactory explanation.So why was he down here in the middle of the night, pounding on the door?He looked into the bathroom again."I, um, I just needed to use the John. "Her sympathy frosted over."Don't let me keep you, Robert. "She turned and headed for the stairs."Are you okay, Alice?"Bob's voice, from the top of the stairs.Robert didn't have the courage to look, but he could imagine Miri's little face staring down, too.As he stepped into the bathroom and shut the door, he heard his daughter in law's tired voice."Not to worry.It was just Robert. "Robert sat on the can for a few minutes and let the shakes die away.Maybe there was still a bomb here, but if it exploded, none but the guilty would be blown apart.And neither did he have the little box that was the point of the comedy.When he showed up at the library, he would be empty handed.So ?After a moment, Robert stood, and looked into the real glass mirror.He favored his reflection with a twisted smile.Maybe he should just bring them a fake; would Tommie even notice?As for the Mysterious Stranger, perhaps his spell had been broken along with all hope.His eyes strayed to the countertop.There, sitting away from the clutter, was a small gray box.It hadn't been there when Alice left.He reached down.His fingers touched warm plastic.Not an illusion.A greater mystery than all the flash and glitter that he was just becoming accustomed to.He slipped the box into his pocket and quietly returned to his room.17    Alfred Volunteers  Gnberk Braun and Keiko Mitsuri: They were top officers in their respective services.Vaz had tracked these two since their college days.He knew more about them than they would ever guess.That was one of the benefits of being very old and very well connected.In a sense, he had guided them into their intel careers, though neither they nor their organizations suspected the fact.They weren't traitors to the EU or Japan, but Alfred understood them so well that he could subtly guide them.So he had thought, and so he still hoped.And yet his two young friends' remorseless efforts to help had become the greatest threat to his plans.As today:  "Yes, yes.There are risks," Vaz was saying."We knew that from the beginning.But letting a serious YGBM project escape detection would be much more dangerous.We must find out what's going on in the San Diego labs.Plan Rabbit can do that. "Keiko Mitsuri shook her head."Alfred, I have contacts in U. S.  intelligence that go back years.These aren't my agents, but they would not tolerate a rogue weapons project.On that, I would trust them with my life.I say we should contact them  very unofficially  and see what they can learn about the San Diego labs. "Alfred leaned forward."Would you trust them with your country's life?Because that's what we are talking about here.In the worst case, there is not only a YGBM research effort going on in San Diego, but it is supported at the highest levels of the U. S.  government.In that case, your friends' best efforts would simply alert their superiors to our suspicions.The evidence would disappear.When it comes to investigating a threat this serious we simply must do it ourselves . "In one form or another, this was an argument that dated from their Barcelona meeting.Today's installment could be decisive.Keiko sat back and gave a frustrated shrug.She was presenting in more or less her real appearance and location, a thirty year old woman sitting at her desk somewhere in Tokyo.She had transformed one side of Vaz's office with her minimalist furniture and a picture window view of Tokyo's skyline.Gnberk Braun was less prepossessing.His image simply occupied one of Alfred's office chairs.No doubt Gnberk figured that the EU swung enough weight that he could afford a mild disposition.Gnberk might be the real problem today, but so far he was just listening.Okay.Alfred spread his hands."I truly think the course we set in Barcelona is the most prudent one.Can you deny the progress we have made?"He waved at the biographical reports scattered around the table."We have hands and minds on the scene  all deniable, and ignorant of what is manipulating them.In fact, they totally misunderstand the significance of this operation.Do you doubt this?Do you think that the Americans have any whiff of our investigation?"Both youngsters shook their heads.Keiko even gave him a rueful smile."No.Your SHE based compartmentalization is truly a revolution in military affairs. ""Indeed, and our releasing those methods  even to sister services within the Alliance  shows how seriously we at the EIA view the current necessities.So, please.If we delay more than one hundred hours, we might as well start over.What is your problem with giving the final go ahead?"Gnberk glanced at his Japanese counterpart.She made an impatient gesture for him to go ahead."I assume your question is rhetorical, Alfred.The problem with Plan Rabbit is Rabbit.Everything depends on him, and still we know almost nothing about him. ""And neither will the Americans.Deniability is the whole point.Rabbit is everything we could want. ""He is more, Alfred. "Gnberk's gaze was steady.For all his youth, Braun had the stolid aspect of a turn of the century German.He moved from point to point slowly, inexorably."In setting up this operation, Rabbit has performed miracles on our behalf.His ability demonstrates that he himself is a threat. "Vaz glanced at the results of Gnberk's latest investigation."But you have discovered critical weaknesses in Rabbit.However much he's tried to disguise it, you've traced all his certificate authority to a single apex. "Having a single CA apex was not unusual; that Gnberk had managed to discover Rabbit's apex was a triumph.For Alfred  given his own, ah, sensitive relationship with Rabbit  it was miraculously good news.Gnberk nodded."Credit Suisse.So what?""So if Rabbit turns out to be a nightmare, you could pull the plug on Credit Suisse and put him out of business. ""Pull the plug on Credit Suisse CA?Do you have any idea what that would do to the European economy?I'm proud of my people, that they ferreted this secret out  but it's not something we can effectively use. ""We should have dropped Rabbit after that first meeting in Barcelona," said Keiko."He is too clever. "Vaz raised a hand, "Perhaps, but how could we know?""Ja ?Forgive me, Alfred, but we wonder if you know more about Mr.Rabbit than we. "Damn !"Not at all.Honestly. "Alfred leaned back in his chair and took in the nervous postures of his colleagues."You've been talking behind my back, haven't you?"He gave them a gentle smile."Do you think Rabbit is really American intelligence?Chinese?"They had spent a lot of time investigating those possibilities.But now Keiko shook her head."Then what is your theory, my friends?""Well," said Gnberk, sounding a little embarrassed."Maybe Mr.Rabbit is not even human.Maybe it's an Artificial Intelligence. "Vaz laughed.He glanced at Keiko Mitsuri."And you?""I think AI is a possibility we should consider.Rabbit's talents are so broad, his work is so effective  and his personality is so juvenile.That last was one of the features the U. S.  DARPA thought would be characteristic. "She saw the incredulity on Vaz's face."Not every threat is a cult or conspiracy. ""Of course.But AI monsters?That's a bogeyman out of the twentieth century.Who in the intelligence communities takes that seriously?Ah!That's Pascal Heriot's hobbyhorse, isn't it?"Alfred's tone became low and serious."Have you been talking to Pascal about this project?""Of course not.But AI is a threat that's been totally overlooked in recent years. ""Correct, because nothing ever came of it.Before the Sino American war, we know DARPA spent billions on the Little Helper Project.It was almost as much a fiasco as their Space Access Denial initiative. ""Space Denial worked . "Vaz laughed."It worked against everybody, Keiko, the Americans most of all.But you're right, SAD is not a proper comparison.My point is that some of the smartest people in the world tried to create AI and failed. ""The researchers failed, but surely runnable code survived.The Internet is not the cramped toy it once was.Maybe pieces of DARPA's Little Helper are out there, growing into what it could never be in the low tech past. ""That is science fiction!There was even a movie  "  "More than one, actually," said Gnberk."Alfred, I don't agree with Keiko that programs from years ago could self organize just because decent resources are available now.But here at the IB, we have been tracking the possibilities.I think Pascal Heriot has a point.Just because most people have dismissed the possibility doesn't mean that it is not real.We are certainly past the crossover point when it comes to computer hardware.Pascal thinks that when it finally happens, it will arise without institutional precursors.It will be like many research developments, but rather more catastrophic. "Just another way humankind might fail to survive the century."Whatever the explanation," said Keiko, "Rabbit is simply too competent, too anonymous I'm sorry, Alfred, we think the operation should be shut down.Let's approach our American friends on this. ""But equipment is in place.Our people are in place. "She shrugged."With Rabbit managing things?That could leave Rabbit with whatever we discover in San Diego.Even if we agreed with you, our bosses would never go along. "She was serious.Alfred glanced at Braun.He was, too.This was bad."Keiko, Gnberk, please.Just balance the risks. ""We are," said Keiko."Rabbit loose within this grandiose scheme is a cosmic sized un safety!"She could be quite full of modern Japanese bluntness.Vaz said, "But we could arrange things so Rabbit receives operational information just in time as the action evolves. "Fortunately, Gnberk shot that down immediately: "Ach, no.Such remote micromanagement, it's a guarantee of disaster. "Vaz hesitated a long moment, tried to look as though he were thinking hard, making some hard decision."Maybe, maybe there's a way we can have everything  the, uh, 'grandiose scheme' and minimal risk from Rabbit.Suppose we don't supply Rabbit with the final details in advance.Suppose we put one of our own people on the ground in Southern California the night of the break in?"Mitsuri and Braun stared for a second."But what about deniability then?"said Keiko."If we have our own agent breaking in  "  "Think, Keiko.My proposal risks tipping off the Americans, which is something yours guarantees .And we can keep the risk low.We simply put our own agent nearby, in a well planned position with essentially zero latencies.What the Americans call a Local Honcho. "Gnberk brightened."Like Alice Gong at Ciudad General Ortiz!""  Yes.Exactly. "He hadn't been thinking of Alice, but Gnberk was right.It had been Alice Gong on the ice at Ortiz, almost single handedly discovering and stopping the Free Water Front.Maybe the Front would have failed anyway.After all, no one had ever tried to scale a Saturday night special up to three hundred megatons.But if the bomb had successfully detonated, their "statement of principle" would have poisoned the freshwater mining industry off West Antarctica.Gong remained unknown to the outside world, but she was something of a legend within the intelligence communities.She was one of the good guys.Thank goodness, neither Braun nor Mitsuri seemed to notice Alfred's discomfort at her name."Inserting a Honcho now would be difficult," said Keiko."Are we talking a credible tourist, or cargo container roulette?"Truly black insertions looked like WMD smuggling; they were hair raising operations for all concerned."None of my agents in place are rated for this operation.It will take a special person, special talents, special clearance. ""I have some good people in California," said Gnberk, "but none of them are at this level. ""It doesn't matter," said Vaz, his voice filled with steely determination."I'm quite willing to go, myself. "He had surprised them before, but this was a bombshell.Braun sat for a moment, openmouthed."Alfred!""It's that important," Vaz said.He gave them each his most direct and sincere look."But you're a desk jockey like us!"Alfred shook his head.Today he would have to let a little bit of his background story come unglued.Hopefully, it wouldn't all tear apart.Alfred had spent years "fitting in" as a midlevel bureaucrat at the External In telligence Agency.If he were unmasked, then at best he'd end up like the prime minister, forced back into high level political hackery.At worst at worst, Gnberk and Keiko might figure out what he was really up to in San Diego.Vaz  > EIA Inner Office: <sm>Clear Biographical Package 3 for joint intelligence viewing.</sm>  Aloud, he said, "I do have field experience.In the U. S.  in fact, in the early teens. "Braun and Mitsuri both had a long stare.They were busy browsing.BioPack 3 would show them the operations.It was all consistent with what they had known before, but revealed new depths to their Indian pal.Gnberk was the first to recover."I see. "He was silent for a moment, reading more."You did well.But that was some years ago, Alfred.This will be a heavily network technical assignment. "Alfred nodded at the criticism."True.I am not a young man. "Mitsuri and Braun thought he was in his early fifties."On the other hand, my specialty here at the EIA is network issues, so I'm not really out of date. "A surprised grin flashed across Keiko's face."And you do know this operation better than anyone.So by being on site you can supply the critical pieces without giving them to Rabbit  "  "Correct. "Gnberk was still unhappy: "And yet this is an extraordinarily dangerous operation.We Great Powers compete, that is true.But when it comes to the threat of Weapons, we must stand together.This is the first time in my career that that covenant has been broken. "Alfred nodded solemnly."We must find out the truth, Gnberk.We could be wrong about San Diego.Then we'll thankfully and silently disengage.But whatever the source of this weapon, we must discover it.And if that turns out to be San Diego, the Americans will very likely thank us. "Mitsuri and Braun looked at each other for a long moment.Finally they nodded, and Keiko said, "We'll support the insertion of a Local Honcho, presumably you.I'll put planners on fallback strategies in case you are exposed.We'll provide network and analyst support.It'll be up to you to manage critical data on the ground  "  "  and keep Mr.Rabbit from taking over the whole thing!"said Gnberk.Alfred sat in his office for some minutes after his friends departed.That had been too close a thing.When the stakes are highest, the threats always multiply.Plan Rabbit was the most sensitive operation that the Indian government had ever (knowingly) been a part of; getting the prime minister's support had not been easy.Today Keiko and Gnberk had almost shut him down as thoroughly as the PM could have.As for Rabbit  well, AI might be fantasy, but Rabbit was just as much a threat as Gnberk and Keiko feared.Alfred relaxed slightly, allowed himself a smile.Yes, the threats had multiplied like, well, like rabbits.But here today he had collided some of those threats and neutralized them.For weeks he had been plotting his Local Honcho role.In the end, Gnberk and Keiko had provided him with the natural excuse to be present on the ground in San Diego.18    The Myasthenic Spelunker Society  The cabal still met on the sixth floor of the library, but that was a very different place now.Robert came up in the elevator, avoiding the Hacekeans and their Library Militant.Nevertheless, sticking to reality was difficult.Theodor Geisel still held the lobby, but the administration was franchising mind and touch space everywhere else.Scooch a mouti characters had infested the basement.H.  P.  Lovecraft's were said to lurk in the farther underground, in what had been noncirculating storage.And the sixth floor was empty, stripped to the bare shelving.From the elevator entrance at the middle of the floor, Robert could see through skeletal shelving all the way to the windows.The book shredders had come and gone.In the southeast corner, the conspirators were hunkered down like twentieth century socialists plotting empire in the midst of their obvious ruin."So what's held up the Library Militant invasion?"Robert said, and waved at the stark reality of the empty stacks.Carlos replied, "A delay in finding the newest haptics is the official explanation.In fact, it's politics.The Scoochi partisans want this floor for their universe.The Library Militant is resisting.The administration may disappoint them both and make this floor a simulation of what libraries were like when they were real. ""But with fake imagery of the books, right?""Yup. "Tommie was smiling."What do you expect?Meantime we still have the floor to ourselves. ""We are not defeated, gentlemen. "Winnie's face was stern."We've known for weeks now that this was inevitable.We've lost a major battle.But it is only the first battle in the war. "He glanced at Tommie.Parker pointed at the LED on his computer."The deadzone is in place.It's time to resume our seriously criminal conspiratizing. "He was smiling, but his gaze swept across them, catching each in the eye."Okay.I've done my research.I can get us into the steam tunnels.I've even arranged festivities that will get the lab staff out of our way.I can get us to the shredda containers, and I have the aerosol glue.We can cause the Librareome Project and Huertas in particular a whole lot of pain.Of course, it won't stop progress on this sort of thing, but it will  "  Winnie gave a grunt."We've already agreed that a permanent stop is impossible.But if we can block the jerks who use the most destructive methods  well, that will have to suffice. ""Righto, Dean.That's exactly what we can do.It's all set up, just missing one critical ingredient. "His gaze slid across to Robert.Such is the power of common sense that Robert hesitated almost a third of a second.Then he reached into his pocket and retrieved the plastic box the Stranger had provided."Check this out, Tommie. "Parker's eyebrows went up."Hey, I'm impressed.I expected a paper napkin or something. "He glanced at his laptop's display and then picked up the box."This looks like a biosample kit. "In fact, the box was now showing colorful labels announcing just that function."How did you do it?"Yes, how?Robert couldn't think of truth or lie that would make any sense.Tommie mistook his silence."No, no don't tell me.I should be able to figure it out for myself. "Tommie smiled down at the box for a moment.Then he slipped it into his pocket."Okay.We're all set then.Now we've got to decide on a time. "Rivera leaned forward."Soon.There's too much lab construction between quarters. ""Yup.And there are other constraints.You wouldn't believe the prep I've had to do.I'm netted to consultants up the yinyang.Don't worry, Dean, none of them see more than a small part of what I'm doing.I'm getting to be a real expert at affiliance. "Tommie was having a hell of a good time."I can make this work, guys!Hey, it will be like the good old days  well, maybe not for you, Carlos; you weren't even born back then. "He grinned at Winnie and Robert.Robert had gone on those hikes underground often, but they'd been impressive enough, trekking through hundreds of feet of tunnel and then popping up in buildings that were dark and empty and largely unfinished.Sometimes there had been stairs in the stairwells, and sometimes not.Winnie Blount was smiling a little now, too."Yeah, the Myasthenic Spelunker Society. "He frowned, remembering more."We were lucky we didn't break our necks. "That comment was from the side of the desk where Winnie had lived most of his life, the administrator with nightmares about liability and litigation."Yup.It was more fun than gaming, and a lot more dangerous.Anyway, that was back before computers  at least as we understand the term now.Today things are way different, but with my research and this bioprofile from Robert, I can get us past all the watchdog automation.At least, if we get the timing right. "He typed briefly on his laptop."Okay, here's the latest.There are three short time slots in the next six weeks when all the security holes line up. ""When is the first?"said Winnie."Real soon.A week from next Monday. "He spun his laptop around so the others could see."We'd go in through Pilchner Hall. "He launched into an extended discussion of how he would manage the adventure.  "And here is where the tunnel forks off campus.Once we get past that, we can walk almost half a mile, out under the old General Genomics site. ""Huertas's labs are just north of that," said Rivera."Yup.And ten to one odds we can get in there and do our stuff  and maybe even get out!"Neither Rivera nor Blount seemed discomfited by this prospectus.After a moment, Winnie said, "We really can't postpone things.I vote for a week from Monday. ""Yeah, me too," said Robert."Wo tongyi .Yes. ""Okay then!"Tommie spun his laptop back and made a notation."Come wearing, but I'll supply new clothes and all necessary electronics.I  "  Winston Blount interrupted: "There's one other thing, Tommie. ""Uh, oh. ""It's not a big thing, but it could get us the right publicity. ""Hmm. ""I propose that we bring along a remote presence, that Sharif fellow. ""That's insane ?"Tommie hopped to his feet and then abruptly sat down again."You want a remote presence?Don't you understand?You won't even be wearing down there. "Winnie smiled cajolingly."But you'll be bringing electronics, Tommie.Couldn't we support his presence through that?"Parker gargled on his indignation."How do you think remote presence works, Dean?""um, it's just a kind of overlay. ""As far as display goes, that's true.But it's not local.Behind the pretty imagery, there's high rate comm and forwarding through ambient micro lasers.There are no random networks down in the tunnels.Everything I've planned depends on us being very quiet, in particular not using any lab nodes.What you want is  " He shook his head in disbelief.Robert looked at Blount."I don't understand either.Just a couple of weeks ago we shut Sharif out as a security risk. "Winnie's face reddened, just as in the old days when Robert nailed him in a faculty meeting.Robert raised his hand."I'm just wondering, Winston.Honest. "After a second, Winnie nodded."Okay.Look, I was never down on the guy.We've met him in person, right here at the library.He appears to be a sincere student.He's honestly interviewing you, right?"When he's not the Stranger or Mr.SciFi, yeah .Robert realized that just a word from him now and the whole scheme might be abandoned.He had not imagined that betrayal could be such a full time job: "Yes.His questions are often foolish, but they're very academic. ""There you are!My point is that if things do not go one hundred percent our way, we want an outsider to present our view, ideally someone who has seen exactly what we're doing.It could mean the difference between going silently to jail  and making an effective moral statement. ""Yes," said Rivera."You're a security genius, Professor Parker.But even the best laid plans can go awry.If you can accommodate Sharif, that would be a a kind of safety net. "Tommie pounded his head gently on the table."You guys don't know what you're asking. "But for all the histrionics, Tommie had not said no.After a moment, the little guy sat up and glared at them."You're asking for a miracle.Maybe I can do it and maybe not.Give me a day to think. ""Sure, Professor. ""No problem. "Blount was smiling with relief.Tommie shook his head and hunched down behind his laptop.He seemed just as happy when the other gang members adjourned the meeting and wandered off toward the elevators.Usually, there was an elevator waiting by the time they got there.Ap parently Tommie's deadzone had left even the elevator software in the dark.After a moment spent staring at closed doors, Carlos reached over and punched the ground floor button."The virtue of maintaining antique controls," he said with a weak smile.Winnie was grinning, but it had nothing to do with the elevator."Don't worry.Tommie will come up with a solution. "Robert nodded."He always has, hasn't he?"" 'Yup,'" said Winnie, and they all laughed.And suddenly Robert understood why Winnie and Carlos wanted Sharif on board.As the elevator doors opened and Rivera and Blount stepped in, Robert said, "Catch you later.Maybe I should see the Library Militant again. "Winnie rolled his eyes."Suit yourself. "And they were gone.Robert stood for a moment, listening to the sound of the departing elevator.Beyond the stairway door on his left was the descent into the virtual library.There had been no more faux earthquakes, but the Librarians Militant still played with heavy amplifiers.He could hear the sounds of creeping masonry, louder now than the elevator.The floor under his feet trembled to the tune of Jerzy Hacek's fantasies.He waited a moment more, and then  instead of heading down the stairs  he walked back around the sixth floor to Tommie Parker.Tommie was leaning forward, his nose still buried in his computer.His deadzone LED was still lit.In a very concrete way, he looked like a wizard with a book of ancient lore.No virtual realities needed here.Robert slid into the opposite chair and watched.It was quite possible the guy hadn't even noticed his arrival.He really could get totally absorbed by games and puzzles and cracking schemes."I am everywhere, and I appear however I wish, to produce the results that I wish . "That was the Mysterious Stranger's brag.After last night, after the miracle in the front bathroom, Robert was willing to believe that whatever the Stranger was, he might be nearly as powerful as he claimed.I wonder what he has on Winnie and Carlos ?Finally, Robert broke the silence: "So, Tommie, how badly have we screwed up?"Blue eyes appeared over the top of the laptop.Tommie's expression seemed to say what are you doing here ?His gaze turned back to his computer."Dunno.I just wish you guys would make up your minds. "A quick glance back Robert's way."But you didn't push for this change, did you?""I have mixed feelings about it. "Now the Stranger would be on site next Monday, proving again his claim of ubiquity."I've always believed in letting you tech geniuses get the job done your own way. "Tommie bobbed agreement."Yup. "Actually, the old Robert had never cared about technology one way or another.Now things were very different."I remember you were always good at pulling miracles out of your hat, though.Are we asking too much this time, Tommie?"Parker sat up and gave Robert all his attention."I I just don't know, Robert.In the old days, there's no way I could swing something like this.I could design super ASICs.I could hack protocols.I could do a dozen things outside my narrow academic specialty.But that doesn't count for so much now.It's that  "  "It's that you're working on problems bigger than any set of specialties. ""Yes!How did you know that?"Ms.Chumlig told me .Aloud, Robert said, "Nowadays, you deal with completely unrelated specialties. ""Right.Some of my core skills are still important.In those I'm as effective as I ever was.But by the time I retired, I was almost an embarrassment to my department.I was good in certain niche courses, but when I tried to teach the new integrative stuff  well, all my life I'd been way ahead of the students, even in new courses.But toward the end, I was floundering.I got through my last semester by assigning weekly projects, and then having the kids critique each other. "He looked seriously embarrassed.Nothing like this had ever happened to the old Robert  but I could always define what quality and performance meant ."Anyway, after I retired, I went back to school  at least inside my head.There's a whole different way of looking at problem solving if you want to solve large problems fast .It's like learning to use power tools, except that nowadays your tools aren't just Google and symbolic math packages, they're also the idea boards and future speculations and  "  "And dealing with people?""Yup.People were never part of my equations  but that doesn't matter anymore.There are design bureaus that specialize in handling the nicey nice. "Tommie leaned forward, confiding."Since I started working on this project, everything has come together!Getting into the tunnels would be useless if the staff were still in the labs.So I've turned the political maneuvering between the Hacekeans and the Scoochis into the most spectacular media distraction  a clash of belief circles.It'll be so cool!I've found a design coordinator who understands what I'm after.I make the overall concept and he farms it out all over the planet.The detailed plans just grow into place!"Tommie sat back, his frustration swept away by this vision of his new powers."And look at my computer!"His hand passed lovingly across the device.The cabinet was nicked and scratched.It looked like it had hosted generations of burglars.The LEDs along the top were set in little pits hacked into the metal.OF Tommie didn't believe in "no user serviceable parts within. ""Over the years, I've replaced everything inside.Too often the changes were to satisfy new standards and the damned SHE.But now in the last couple of months, I've put a revolution inside this box.It subverts nontrivial parts of the Secure Hardware Environment.I swear, Robert, I'm hotter than DARPA and CIA ever were in the twentieth century. "Robert was silent for a moment.Then he said, "I'll bet you will figure some way to get Sharif in. ""Ha.That would be the frosting on the cake.The obvious trick is straight out of the twentieth century: We just lay our own cable.That would support decent data rates  enough for Sharif, anyway  and we'd still be all dark and quiet. "He glanced at Robert and apparently took his silence for incredulity."I know, it's a long walk, and the tunnel security will be mostly live.But there's a kind of slimclad optical fiber or there will be after I get done with my design coordinator. ""Yes.Your design coordinator. ""I am everywhere, and I appear however I wish, to produce the results that I wish . "The new world was a magical place, but there was a hierarchy of miracles.There was what Juan and Robert could do.There was what Louise Chumlig was trying to teach.There was what Tommie had taught himself.And somewhere above it all, there was what the Mysterious Stranger could do.19    Failure Is an Option  At Fairmont High, final exams were spread across several days.There were some similarities with what he remembered of childhood.The kids were distracted by the upcoming holidays.Worse, the Christmas movie season was something that was beginning to pervade the various shared worlds they lived in.But finals were different in one profound way from his experience in high school.For Robert Gu, these new exams were hard .It was not a foregone conclusion that he would max the tests and outdo everyone around him.The only similar situation from his past was in undergraduate school, when he had briefly been forced into real science courses.In those classes, he had finally met students who were not automatically his inferiors  and he had also met teachers who were not impressed by his genius.Once past the mandatory science curriculum, Robert had avoided such humiliation.Until now.Math and formal common sense.Statistics and data mechanics.Search and analysis.Even the S&A exam limited one's opportunity to go out on the net and use the intelligence of others.Though she taught collaboration, Chumlig had always droned about the importance of core competencies.Now all her mismatched platitudes were coming together in one hellweek of testing.Right after the "common sense" exam, the Mysterious Stranger manifested himself.He was just a voice and a greenish glow."Having trouble with the exams, my man?""I'll get by. "In fact, the math had actually been interesting.Miri  > Juan, Xiu: <sm>He's talking to someone again.</sm>  Xiu  > Juan, Miri: <sm>What is he saying?</sm>  Miri  > Juan, Xiu: <sm>I don't know.Local audio has gone private.Juan!Get out there.</sm>  Juan  > Miri, Xiu: <sm>You're not the boss of me.I was going to talk to Robert now anyway.</sm>  The Stranger chuckled."At Fairmont High, they don't give automatic A grades, or even automatic passing grades.Failure is an option, but you  "  Relief was in sight.He saw Juan Orozco coming out of the class building, heading his way.The stranger continued,"  and Juan Orozco are not certain F's.You're on a simplified curriculum.You should see the exams they're planning for your granddaughter. ""What about my granddaughter?"If the slimeball brought her into this   But the voice did not reply.Juan looked around questioningly."Were you talking to someone, Robert?""Not about school things. ""Because I didn't see anybody. "He hesitated, and letters coursed across Robert's view.Juan  > Robert: <sm>It's really important not to collaborate outside of the rules.</sm>  "I understand," Robert replied out loud."Okay. "Clearly Juan didn't think Robert could pass all the tests.Sometimes it seemed like the poor kid was trying to protect him ."See," Juan continued, "the school uses a real good proctor service.Maybe there are some kids who can fool it, but there's a lot more who only think they can. "And then there's the Mysterious Stranger, who seems to have no trouble at all with security .The Stranger was so powerful, yet he still got pleasure from taunting Robert.Could it be some old enemy  someone a good deal brighter than Winnie Blount?"Anyway, I think we have a chance for an A in our semester demo, Robert. "The boy launched into the latest plans for using his writing together with manual music and Robert's network algorithms.It was the blind leading the blind, but after a few moments Robert was absorbed in it.Things were very tense around the house, and it had nothing to do with final exams.In point of fact, Robert's midnight fracas at the front bathroom amounted to a physical assault.Never mind that he'd been trying to protect Alice  that was scarcely something he could claim.This time there were no threats, no showdowns.But Robert could see an uneasiness in Bob's eyes that hadn't been there before.It was the look of a fellow who begins to wonder if the snake he's been keeping might actually be a black mamba.That conclusion would get Robert shipped to Rainbows End faster than any mere boorishness.Miri gave him a clue as to why this hadn't happened.She caught up with him one afternoon as he wandered around West Fallbrook hoping for contact with some friendly form of Sharif.Miri rode her old bike along beside him for a few paces, matching his speed, and wobbling wildly.Finally she hopped off and walked the bike.As usual, her posture was schoolmarm straight.She looked at him sideways for a moment."How are your finals going, Robert?""Hi Miri.How are your finals going?""I asked first!Besides, you know my finals don't start till after the break. "Her ebullient bossiness seemed to collide with diplomacy."So how are you doing?""It looks like I'm going to get a C in math. "Her eyes widened."Oh!I'm sorry. "Robert laughed."No.That's good news.I wouldn't have even understood the problems, back before the Alzheimer's. "She gave him a sickly smile."Well, that's okay then. ""Hmm.A friend of mine told me that the kids in your classes are really good at these things. ""We know the tools. ""I think I could be a lot better in math," said Robert, almost to himself."It might even be fun. "Of course, if his real plans for the next few days worked out, he would have his poetry back and none of this would matter.This time Miri's smile was happier."I'll bet you could!You know I could help you on that.I really like math, and I have all sorts of custom heuristics.Between semesters I could show you how to use them. "Her voice slipped into leader mode as she planned out his vacation for him.That's the Alice in her , thought Robert.He almost smiled."Hold on, there's still finals to get through. "And he thought about Juan's latest demo plans.The boy was doing okay.It was Robert who was having trouble with his part, the graphics and the interfaces."That's where I really need help. "Miri's face snapped around, "I will not help you cheat, Robert!"They both stopped and stared at each other."That's not what I meant, Miri!"Then he thought about what he had actually said.Christ.In the old days I insulted people all the time, but I knew when I was doing it ."Honest.I just meant that finals are a problem, okay?"Lena  > Miri, Xiu: <sm>Be cool, kiddo.Even I don't think Robert's messing with you.</sm>  Xiu  > Lena, Miri: <sm>This is a first for you then.</sm>  Miri glared at him for a second more.Then she made a strange sound that might have been a giggle."Okay.I should have known a Gu would not cheat.It's just that I get so mad at some of the kids in my study group.I tell them what to do.I tell them not to cheat.And yet they are always chiseling at the collab protocols. "She started walking again, and Robert followed along."Actually," she said, "I was just making conversation.I have a mission, something I should tell you. ""Oh?""Yes.Bob wants to send you out of state.He figures you tried to beat up Alice. "She paused, as if waiting for some defense.But Robert only nodded, remembering the look in Bob's eyes.So Rainbows End was too close by."How long do I have?""That's what I want to tell you, not to worry.You see  " It turned out that his rescue came from an unlikely source, namely Colonel Alice herself.Apparently, she hadn't felt the least bit threatened by him."Alice knew you were just desperate, I mean  " Miri made a verbal dance of avoiding insult and gross language: Basically, Alice already thought he was a crazy old man.Crazy old men have to go to the bathroom all the time; they get overly focused on that problem.Furthermore, Alice didn't regard his manhandling of her as assault.Robert remembered how sore his head was after he tripped over her feet and slammed into the doorjamb.Black belt whatever must be one of Alice's myriad JITTs.Alice was the dangerous one.Poor Alice, poor Bob.Poor Miri."Anyway, she told Bob that he was overreacting, and you really need your schooling here.She says you can stay as long as your behavior is" Her voice dwindled into silence, and she looked up at him.
