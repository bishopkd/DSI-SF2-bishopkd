Hes out of danger.Youll need to take him to Therrod to have the limbs regrown, but Ive done some of the prep work, and they should grow back fairly easily.Two weeks, said the Nilter woman, impassive.As though it wasnt the first time something like this had happened.Cant be helped, said Strigan, answering something I hadnt heard or understood.Maybe someones got a few extra hands they can spare.Ill call some cousins.You do that, said Strigan.You can see him now if you like, but hes asleep.When can we move him?the woman asked.Now, if you like, answered Strigan.The sooner the better, I suppose.The woman made an affirmative gesture, and she and the girl rose and went into the infirmary without another word.Not long after, we brought the injured person out to the girls flier and saw them off, and trudged back into the house and shed our outer coats.Seivarden had by now returned to her pallet on the floor and sat, knees drawn up, arms tight around her legs as if she were holding them back and it took work.Strigan looked at me, an odd expression on her face, one I couldnt read.Shes a good kid.Yes.Shell get a good name out of this.A good story to go with it.I had learned the lingua franca that I thought would be most useful here, and done the sort of cursory research one needs to navigate unfamiliar places, but I knew almost nothing about the people who herded bov on this part of the planet.Is it an adulthood thing?I guessed.Sort of.Yes.She went to a cabinet, pulled out a cup and a bowl.Her movements were quick and steady, but I got somehow an impression of exhaustion.From the set of her shoulders perhaps.I didnt think youd be much interested in children.Aside from killing them, I mean.I refused the bait.She let me know she wasnt a child.Even if she did have a Tiktik set.Strigan sat at her small table.You played two hours straight.There wasnt much else to do.Strigan laughed, short and bitter.Then she gestured toward Seivarden, who seemed to be ignoring us.She couldnt understand us anyway, we werent speaking Radchaai.I dont feel sorry for him.Its just that Im a doctor.You said that.I dont think you feel sorry for him either.I dont.You dont make anything easy, do you?Strigans voice was half angry.Exasperated.It depends.She shook her head slightly, as though she hadnt heard quite clearly.Ive seen worse.But he needs medical attention.You dont intend to give it, I said.Not asking.Im still figuring you out, Strigan said, as though her statement was related to mine, though I was sure it wasnt.As a matter of fact, Im considering giving him something more to keep him calm.I didnt answer.You disapprove.It wasnt a question.I dont feel sorry for him.You keep saying that.He lost his ship.Very likely her interest in her Garseddai artifacts had led her to learn what she could about the events that had led to the destruction of Garsedd.Bad enough, Strigan continued, but Radchaai ships arent just ships, are they?And his crew.It was a thousand years ago for us, but for himone moment everything is the way it should be, next moment everythings gone.With one hand she made a frustrated, ambivalent gesture.He needs medical attention.If he hadnt fled the Radch, hed have received it.Strigan cocked one gray eyebrow, sat on a bench.Translate for me.My Radchaai isnt good enough.One moment an ancillary had shoved Seivarden into a suspension pod, next shed found herself freezing and choking as the pods fluids exited through her mouth and nose, drained away, and she found herself in the sick bay of a patrol ship.When Seivarden described it, I could see her agitation, her anger, barely masked.Some dingy little Mercy, with a shabby, provincial captain.Your face is almost perfectly impassive, Strigan said to me.Not in Radchaai, so Seivarden didnt understand.But I can see your temperature and heart rate.And probably a few other things, with the medical implants she likely had.The ship was human crewed, I said to Seivarden.That distressed her furtherwhether it was anger, or embarrassment, or something else, I couldnt tell.I didnt realize.Not right away.The captain took me aside and explained.I translated this for Strigan, and she looked at Seivarden in disbelief, and then at me with speculation.Is that an easy mistake to make?No, I answered, shortly.That was when she finally had to tell me how long it had been, Seivarden said, unaware of anything but her own story.And what had happened after, suggested Strigan.I translated, but Seivarden ignored it, and continued as though neither of us had spoken.Eventually we put in to this tiny border station.You know the sort of thing, a station administrator whos either in disgrace or a jumped up nobody, an officious inspector supervisor playing tyrant on the docks, and half a dozen Security whose biggest challenge is chasing chickens out of the tea shop.Id thought the Mercy captain had a terrible accent, but I couldnt understand anyone on the station at all.The station AI had to translate for me, but my implants didnt work.Too antiquated.So I could only talk to it using wall consoles.Which would have made it extremely difficult to hold any sort of conversation.And even when Station explained, the things people were saying didnt make sense.They assigned me an apartment, a room with a cot, hardly large enough to stand up in.Yes, they knew who I said I was, but they had no record of my financial data, and it would be weeks before it could possibly arrive.Maybe longer.Meantime I got the food and shelter any Radchaai was guaranteed.Unless, of course, I wanted to retake the aptitudes so I could get a new assignment.Because they didnt have my aptitudes data and even if they did it was certainly out of date.Out of date, she repeated, her voice bitter.Did you see a doctor?Strigan asked.Watching Seivardens face, I guessed what had finally sent her from Radchaai space.She must have seen a doctor, who had opted to wait and watch.Physical injuries werent an issue, the medic of whatever Mercy had picked her up would have taken care of those, but psychological or emotional onesthey might resolve on their own, and if they didnt, the doctor would need that aptitudes data to work effectively.They said I could send a message to my house lord asking for assistance.But they didnt know who that was.Obviously Seivarden had no intention of talking about the station doctor.House lord?asked Strigan.Head of her extended family, I explained.It sounds very elevated in translation, but it isnt, unless your house is very wealthy or prestigious.And hers?Was both.Strigan didnt miss that.Was.Seivarden continued as though we hadnt spoken.But it turned out, Vendaai was gone.My whole house didnt even exist anymore.Everything, assets and contracts, everything absorbed by Geir!It had surprised everyone at the time, some five hundred years ago.The two houses, Geir and Vendaai, had hated each other.Geirs house lord had taken malicious advantage of Vendaais gambling debts, and some foolish contracts.Catch up with current events?I asked Seivarden.She ignored my question.Everything was gone.And what was left, it was like it was almost right.But the colors were wrong, or everything was turned slightly to the left of where it should be.People would say things and I couldnt understand them at all, or I knew they were real words but my mind couldnt take them in.Nothing seemed real.Maybe it had been an answer to my question after all.How did you feel about the human soldiers?Seivarden frowned, and looked directly at me for the first time since shed awoken.I regretted asking the question.It hadnt really been the question Id wanted to ask.What did you think when you heard about Ime?But maybe she hadnt.Or if she had it might have been incomprehensible to her.Did anyone come to you whispering about restoring the rightful order of things?Probably not, considering.How did you leave the Radch without permits?That couldnt have been easy.It would at the very least have cost money she wouldnt have had.Seivarden looked away from me, down and to the left.She wasnt going to say.Everything was wrong, she said after nine seconds of silence.Bad dreams, said Strigan.Anxiety.Shaking, sometimes.Unsteady, I said.Translated it had very little sting, but in Radchaai, for an officer like Seivarden, it said more.Weak, fearful, inadequate to the demands of her position.Fragile.If Seivarden was unsteady, she had never really deserved her assignment, never really been suited to the military, let alone to captain a ship.But of course Seivarden had taken the aptitudes, and the aptitudes had said she was what her house had always assumed she would be: steady, fit to command and conquer.Not prone to doubts or irrational fears.You dont know what youre talking about, Seivarden half sneered, half snarled.Arms still locked around her knees.No one in my house is unsteady.Of course (I thought but did not say), the various cousins who had served a year or so during this annexation or that and retired to take ascetic vows or paint tea sets hadnt done so because they had been unsteady.And the cousins who hadnt tested as anticipated, but surprised their parents with assignments in the minor priesthoods, or the artsthis had not indicated any sort of unsteadiness inherent in the house, no, never.And Seivarden wasnt the least bit afraid or worried about what new assignment a retake of the aptitudes would get her, and what that might say about her steadiness.Of course not.Unsteady?asked Strigan, understanding the word, but not its context.The unsteady, I explained, lack a certain strength of character.Character!Strigans indignation was plain to read.Of course.I didnt alter my facial expression, but kept it bland and pleasant, as it had been for most of the past few days.Lesser citizens break down in the face of enormous difficulties or stress and sometimes require medical attention for it.But some citizens are bred better.They never break down.Though they may take early retirement, or spend a few years pursuing artistic or spiritual interestsprolonged meditation retreats are quite popular.This is how one knows the difference between highly placed families and lesser ones.But you Radchaai are so good at brainwashing.Or so I hear.Reeducation, I corrected.If shed stayed, shed have gotten help.But she couldnt face needing the help to begin with.I said nothing to agree or disagree, though I thought Strigan was right.How much can reeducation do?A great deal, I said.Though much of what youve probably heard is greatly exaggerated.It cant turn you into someone youre not.Not in any useful way.Erase memories.Suppress them, I think.Add new ones, maybe.You have to know what youre doing or you could damage someone badly.No doubt.Seivarden stared frowning at us, watching us talk, unable to understand what we were saying.Strigan half smiled.You arent a product of reeducation.No, I acknowledged.It was surgery.Sever a few connections, make a few new ones.Install some implants.She paused a moment, waiting for me to answer, but I didnt.You pass well enough.Mostly.Your expression, your tone of voice, its always right but its always always studied.Always a performance.You think youve solved the puzzle, I guessed.Solved isnt the right word.But youre a corpse soldier, Im certain of it.Do you remember anything?Many things, I said, still bland.No, I mean from before.It took me nearly five seconds to understand what she meant.That person is dead.Seivarden suddenly, convulsively stood and walked out the inner door and, by the sound of it, through the outer as well.Strigan watched her go, gave a quick, breathy hm, and then turned back to me.Your sense of who you are has a neurological basis.One small change and you dont believe you exist anymore.But youre still there.I think youre still there.Why the bizarre desire to kill Anaander Mianaai?Why else would you be so angry with him?She tilted her head to indicate the exit, Seivarden outside in the cold with only one coat.Hell take the crawler, I warned.The girl and her mother had taken the flier, and left the crawler outside Strigans house.No he wont.I disabled it.I gestured my approval, and Strigan continued, returning to her previous subject.And the music.I dont suppose you were a singer, not with a voice like yours.But you must have been a musician, before, or loved music.I considered making the bitter laugh Strigans guess called for.No, I said, instead.Not actually.But you are a corpse soldier, Im right about that.I didnt answer.You escaped somehow or are you from his ship?Captain Seivardens?Sword of Nathtas was destroyed.I had been there, been nearby.Relatively speaking.Seen it happen, nearly enough.And that was a thousand years ago.Strigan looked toward the door, back at me.Then she frowned.No.No, I think youre Ghaonish, and they were only annexed a few centuries ago, werent they?I shouldnt have forgotten that, its why youre passing as someone from the Gerentate, isnt it?No, you escaped somehow.I can bring you back.Im sure I can.You can kill me, you mean.You can destroy my sense of self and replace it with one you approve of.Strigan didnt like hearing that, I could see.The outer door opened, and then Seivarden came shivering through the inner.Put on your outer coat next time, I told her.Fuck off.She grabbed a blanket off her pallet and wrapped it around her shoulders, and stood, still shivering.Very unbecoming language, citizen, I said.For a moment she looked as though she might lose her temper.Then she seemed to remember what might happen if she did.Fuck.She sat on the nearest bench, heavily.Off.Why didnt you leave him where you found him?asked Strigan.I wish I knew.It was another puzzle for her, but not one I had made deliberately.I didnt know myself.Didnt know why I cared if Seivarden froze to death in the storm swept snow, didnt know why I had brought her with me, didnt know why I cared if she took someone elses crawler and fled, or walked off into the green stained frozen waste and died.And why are you so angry with him?That I knew.And truth to tell, it wasnt entirely fair to Seivarden that I was angry.Still, the facts remained what they were, and my anger as well.Why do you want to kill Anaander Mianaai?Seivardens head turned slightly, her attention hooked by the familiar name.Its personal.Personal.Strigans tone was incredulous.Yes.Youre not a person anymore.Youve said as much to me.Youre equipment.An appendage to a ships AI.I said nothing, and waited for her to consider her own words.Is there a ship thats lost its mind?Recently, I mean.Insane Radchaai ships were a staple of melodrama, inside and outside Radchaai space.Though Radchaai entertainments in that direction were usually historicals.When Anaander Mianaai had taken control of the core of Radch space some few ships had destroyed themselves upon the death or captivity of their captains, and rumor said some others still wandered space in the three thousand years since, half mad, despairing.None I know of.She very likely followed news from the Radchit was a matter of her own safety, considering what I was sure she was hiding, and what the consequences would be for her if Anaander Mianaai ever discovered that.She had, potentially, all the information she needed to identify me.But after half a minute she gestured doubtfully, disappointed.You wont just tell me.I smiled, calm and pleasant.What fun would that be?She laughed, seeming truly amused at my answer.Which I thought a hopeful sign.So when are you leaving?When you give me the gun.I dont know what youre talking about.A lie.Manifestly a lie.Your apartment, on Dras Annia Station.Its untouched.Just as you left it, so far as I could tell.Every one of Strigans motions became deliberate, just slightly slowedblinks, breaths.The hand carefully brushing dust from her coat sleeve.That a fact.It cost me a great deal to get in.Where did a corpse soldier get all that money anyway?Strigan asked, still tense, still concealing it.But genuinely curious.Always that.Work, I said.Lucrative work.And dangerous.I had risked my life to get that money.The icon?Not unrelated.But I didnt want to talk about that.What do I need to do, to convince you?Is the money insufficient?I had more, elsewhere, but saying so would be foolish.What did you see in my apartment?Strigan asked, curiosity and anger in her voice.A puzzle.With pieces missing.I had deduced the existence and nature of those pieces correctly, I must have, because here I was, and here was Arilesperas Strigan.Strigan laughed again.Like you.Listen.She leaned forward, hands on her thighs.You cant kill Anaander Mianaai.I wish to all thats good it were possible, but its not.Even with even if I had what you think I have you couldnt do it.You told me that twenty five of these guns were insufficient  Twenty four, I corrected.She waved that away.Were insufficient to keep the Radchaai away from Garsedd.Why do you think one would be anything more than a minor irritant?She knew better, or she wouldnt have run.Wouldnt have asked the local toughs to take care of me before I got to her.And why are you so determined to do such a ridiculous thing?Everyone outside the Radch hates Anaander Mianaai.If by some miracle he died, the celebrations would last a hundred years.But it wont happen.It certainly wont happen because of one idiot with a gun.Im sure you know that.You probably know it far better than I could.True.Then why?Information is power.Information is security.Plans made with imperfect information are fatally flawed, will fail or succeed on the toss of a coin.I had known, when I first knew I would have to find Strigan and obtain the gun from her, that this would be such a moment.If I answered Strigans questionif I answered it fully, as she would certainly demandI would be giving her something she could use against me, a weapon.She would almost certainly hurt herself in the process, but that wasnt always much of a deterrent, I knew.Sometimes, I began, and then corrected myself.Quite frequently, someone will learn a little bit about Radchaai religion, and ask, If everything that happens is the will of Amaat, if nothing can happen that is not already designed by God, why bother to do anything?Good question.Not particularly.No?Why bother, then?I am, I said, as Anaander Mianaai made me.Anaander Mianaai is as she was made.We will both of us do the things we are made to do.The things that are before us to do.I doubt very much that Anaander Mianaai made you so that you would kill him.Any reply would reveal more than I wished, at the moment.And I, continued Strigan, after a second and a half of silence, am made to demand answers.Its just Gods will.She made a gesture with her left hand, not my problem.You admit you have the gun.I admit nothing.I was left with blind chance, a step into unguessable dark, waiting to live or die on the results of the toss, not knowing what the chances were of any result.My only other choice would be to give up, and how could I give up now?After so long, after so much?And I had risked as much, or more, before now, and gotten this far.She had to have the gun.Had to.But how could I make her give it to me?What would make her choose to give it to me?Tell me, Strigan said, watching me intently.No doubt seeing my frustration and doubt through her medical implants, fluctuations of my blood pressure and temperature and respiration.Tell me why.I closed my eyes, felt the disorientation of not being able to see through other eyes that I knew I had once had.Opened them again, took a breath to begin, and told her.10   I had thought that perhaps the mornings temple attendants would (quite understandably) choose to stay home, but one small flower bearer, awake before the adults in her household, arrived with a handful of pink petaled weeds and stopped at the edge of the house, startled to see Anaander Mianaai kneeling in front of our small icon of Amaat.Lieutenant Awn was dressing, on the upper floor.I cant serve today, she said to me, her voice impassive as her emotions were not.The morning was already warm, and she was sweating.You didnt touch any of the bodies, I said as I adjusted her jacket collar, sure of the fact.It was the wrong thing to say.Four of my segments, two on the northern edge of the Fore Temple and two standing waist deep in the lukewarm water and mud, lifted the body of Jen Taas niece onto the ledge, and carried her to the medics house.On the ground floor of Lieutenant Awns house, I said to the frightened, frozen flower bearer, Its all right.There was no sign of the water bearer, and I was ineligible.Youll have to at least bring the water, Lieutenant, I said, above, to Lieutenant Awn.The flower bearer is here, but the water bearer isnt.For a few moments Lieutenant Awn said nothing, while I finished wiping her face.Right, she said, and went downstairs and filled the bowl, and brought it to the flower bearer, where she stood next to me, still frightened, clutching her handful of pink petals.Lieutenant Awn held the water out to her, and she set the flowers down and washed her hands.But before she could pick the flowers up again, Anaander Mianaai turned to look at her, and the child started back and grabbed my gloved hand with her bare one.Youll have to wash your hands again, citizen, I whispered, and with a bit more encouragement she did so, and picked up the flowers again and performed her part of the mornings ritual correctly, if nervously.No one else came.I was not surprised.The medic, speaking to herself and not to me, though I stood three meters away from her, said, Throat cut, obviously, but she was also poisoned.And then, with disgust and contempt, A child of their own house.These people arent civilized.Our one small attendant left, a gift from the Lord of the Radch clutched in one handa pin in the shape of a four petaled flower, each petal holding an enameled image of one of the four Emanations.Anywhere else, a Radchaai who received one would treasure it, and wear it nearly constantly, a badge of having served in the temple with the Lord of the Radch herself.This child would probably toss it in a box and forget about it.When she was out of sight (of Lieutenant Awn and the Lord of the Radch, if not of me) Anaander Mianaai turned to Lieutenant Awn and said, Arent those weeds?A wave of embarrassment overcame Lieutenant Awn, mixed a moment later with disappointment, and an intense anger I had never seen in her before.Not to the children, my lord.She was unable to keep the edge out of her voice completely.Anaander Mianaais expression didnt change.This icon, and this set of omens.Theyre your personal property, I think.Where are the ones that belong to the temple?Begging my lords pardon, Lieutenant Awn said, though I knew at this point she meant to do no such thing, and the fact was audible in her tone.I used the funds for their purchase to supplement the term end gifts for the temple attendants.She had also used her own money for the same purpose, but she didnt say that.Im sending you back to Justice of Toren, said the Lord of the Radch.Your replacement will be here tomorrow.Shame.A fresh flare of anger.And despair.Yes, my lord.There wasnt much to pack.I could be ready to move in less than an hour.I spent the rest of the day delivering gifts to our temple attendants, who were all home.School had been canceled, and hardly anyone came out onto the streets.Lieutenant Awn doesnt know, I told each one, if the new lieutenant will make different appointments, or if shell give the year end gifts without your having served a whole year.You should come to the house anyway, her first morning.The adults in each house eyed me silently, not inviting me in, and each time I laid the giftnot the usual pair of gloves, which didnt yet matter much here, but a brightly colored and patterned skirt, and a small box of tamarind sweets.Fresh fruit was customary, but there was no time to obtain any.I left each small stack of gifts in the street, on the edge of the house, and no one moved to take them, or spoke any word to me.The Divine spent an hour or two behind screens in the temple residence, and then emerged looking entirely unrested, and went into the temple, where she conferred with the junior priests.The bodies had been cleared away.I had offered to clean the blood, not knowing if my doing so would be permissible, but the priests had declined my assistance.Some of us, said the Divine to me, still staring at the area of floor where the dead had lain, had forgotten what you are.Now they are reminded.I dont think you forgot, Divine, I said.No.She was silent for two seconds.Is the lieutenant going to see me before she leaves?Possibly not, Divine, I said.I was at that moment doing what I could to encourage Lieutenant Awn to sleep, something she badly needed to do but was finding difficult.Its probably better if she doesnt, the head priest said, bitterly.She looked at me then.Its unreasonable of me.I know it is.What else could she have done?Its easy for me to sayand I say itthat she could have chosen otherwise.She could have, Divine, I acknowledged.What is it you Radchaai say?I wasnt Radchaai, but I didnt correct her, and she continued.Justice, propriety, and benefit, isnt it?Let every act be just, and proper, and beneficial.Yes, Divine.Was that just?Her voice trembled, for just an instant, and I could hear she was on the edge of tears.Was it proper?I dont know, Divine.More to the point, who benefited?No one, Divine, so far as I can see.No one?Really?Come, One Esk, dont play the fool with me.That look of betrayal on Jen Shinnans face, plainly directed at Anaander Mianaai, had been obvious to everyone there.Still, I couldnt see what the Lord of the Radch had stood to gain from those deaths.They would have killed you, Divine, I said.You, and anyone else they found undefended.Lieutenant Awn did what she could to prevent bloodshed last night.It wasnt her fault she failed.It was.Her back was still to me.God forgive her for it.God forbid that I may ever be faced with such a choice.She made an invocatory gesture.And you?What would you have done, if the lieutenant had refused, and the Lord of the Radch ordered you to shoot her?Could you have?I thought that armor of yours was impenetrable.The Lord of the Radch can force our armor down.But the code Anaander Mianaai would have had to transmit to force down Lieutenant Awns armoror mine, or any other Radchaai soldierswould have to have been delivered over communications that had been blocked at the time.Still.Speculating about such things does no good, Divine, I said.It didnt happen.The head priest turned, and looked intently at me.You didnt answer the question.It wasnt an easy question for me to answer.I had been in pieces, and at the time only one segment had even known that such a thing was possible, that for an instant Lieutenant Awns life had hung, uncertain, on the outcome of that moment.I wasnt entirely sure that segment wouldnt have turned its gun on Anaander Mianaai instead.It probably wouldnt have.Divine, I am not a person.If I had shot the Lord of the Radch nothing would have changed, I was sure, except that not only would Lieutenant Awn still be dead, I would be destroyed, Two Esk would take my place, or a new One Esk would be built with segments from Justice of Torens holds.The ships AI might find itself in some difficulty, though more likely my action would be blamed on my being cut off.People often think they would have made the noblest choice, but when they find themselves actually in such a situation, they discover matters arent quite so simple.As I saidGod forbid.I will comfort myself with the delusion that you would have shot the Mianaai bastard first.Divine!I cautioned.She could say nothing in my hearing that might not eventually reach the ears of the Lord of the Radch.Let her hear.Tell her yourself!She instigated what happened last night.Whether the target was us, or the Tanmind, or Lieutenant Awn, I dont know.I have my suspicions which.Im not a fool.Divine, I said.Whoever instigated last nights events, I dont think things happened the way they wished.I think they wanted open warfare between the upper and lower cities, though I dont understand why.And I think that was prevented when Denz Ay told Lieutenant Awn about the guns.I think as you do, said the head priest.And I think Jen Shinnan knew more, and that was why she died.Im sorry your temple was desecrated, Divine, I said.I wasnt particularly sorry Jen Shinnan was dead, but I didnt say so.The Divine turned away from me again.Im sure you have a lot to do, getting ready to leave.Lieutenant Awn neednt trouble herself calling on me.You can give her my farewells yourself.She walked away from me, not waiting for any acknowledgment.Lieutenant Skaaiat arrived for supper, with a bottle of arrack and two Seven Issas.Your relief wont even reach Kould Ves until midday, she said, breaking the seal on the bottle.Meanwhile the Seven Issas stood stiff and uncomfortable on the ground floor.They had arrived just before Id restored communications.Theyd seen the dead in the temple of Ikkt, had guessed without being told what had happened.And they had only been out of the holds for the last two years.They hadnt seen the annexation itself.All of Ors, upper and lower, was similarly quiet, similarly tense.When people left their houses they avoided looking at me or speaking to me.Mostly they only went out to visit the temple, where the priests led prayers for the dead.A few Tanmind even came down from the upper city, and stood quietly at the edges of the small crowd.I kept myself in the shadows, not wanting to distract or distress any further.Tell me you didnt almost refuse, said Lieutenant Skaaiat, in the house on the upper floor, with Lieutenant Awn, behind screens.They sat on fungal smelling cushions, facing each other.I know you, Awn, I swear when I heard what Seven Issa saw when they got to the temple I was afraid Id hear next that you were dead.Tell me you didnt.I didnt, said Lieutenant Awn, miserable and guilty.Her voice bitter.You can see I didnt.I cant see that.Not at all.Lieutenant Skaaiat poured a hefty slug of liquor into the cup I held out, and I handed it to Lieutenant Awn.Neither can One Esk, or it wouldnt be so silent this evening.She looked at the nearest segment.Did the Lord of the Radch forbid you to sing?No, Lieutenant.I hadnt wanted to disturb Anaander Mianaai, when she was here, or interrupt what sleep Lieutenant Awn could get.And anyway, I hadnt much felt like it.Lieutenant Skaaiat made a frustrated sound and turned back to Lieutenant Awn.If youd refused, nothing would have changed, except youd be dead too.You did what you had to do, and the idiots Hyrs cock, those idiots.They should have known better.Lieutenant Awn stared at the cup in her hand, not moving.I know you, Awn.If youre going to do something that crazy, save it for when itll make a difference.Like Mercy of Sarrse One Amaat One?She was talking about events at Ime, about the soldier who had refused her order, led that mutiny five years before.She made a difference, at least.Listen, Awn, you and I both know something was going on.You and I both know that what happened last night doesnt make sense unless She stopped.Lieutenant Awn set her cup of arrack down, hard.Liquor sloshed over the lip of the cup.Unless what?How does it make sense?Here.Lieutenant Skaaiat picked up the cup and pressed it into Lieutenant Awns hand.Drink this.And Ill explain.At least as much as makes sense to me.You know how annexations work.I mean, yes, they work by sheer, undeniable force, but after.After the executions and the transportations and once all the last bits of idiots who think they can fight back are cleaned up.Once all thats done, we fit whoevers left into Radchaai societythey form up into houses, and take clientage, and in a generation or two theyre as Radchaai as anybody.And mostly that happens because we go to the top of the local hierarchythere pretty much always is oneand offer them all sorts of benefits in exchange for behaving like citizens, offer them clientage contracts, which allows them to offer contracts to whoever is below them, and before you know it the whole local setup is tied into Radchaai society, with minimal disruption.Lieutenant Awn made an impatient gesture.She already knew this.What does that have to do with  You fucked that up.I  What you did worked.And the local Tanmind were going to have to swallow that.Fair enough.If Id done what you didgone straight to the Orsian priest, set up house in the lower city instead of using the police station and jail already built in the upper city, set about making alliances with lower city authorities and ignoring  I didnt ignore anyone!Lieutenant Awn protested.Lieutenant Skaaiat waved her protest away.And ignoring what anyone else would have seen as the natural local hierarchy.Your house cant afford to offer clientage to anyone here.Yet.Neither you nor I can make any contracts with anyone.For now.We had to exempt ourselves from our houses contracts and take clientage directly from Anaander Mianaai, while we serve.But we still have those family connections, and those families can use connections we make now, even if we cant.And we can certainly use them when we retire.Getting your feet on the ground during an annexation is the one sure way to increase your houses financial and social standing.Which is fine until the wrong person does it.We tell ourselves that everything is the way Amaat wants it to be, that everything that is, is because of God.So if were wealthy and respected, thats how things should be.The aptitudes prove that its all just, that everyone gets what they deserve, and when the right people test into the right careers, that just goes to show how right it all is.Im not the right people.Lieutenant Awn set down her empty cup, and Lieutenant Skaaiat refilled it.Youre only one of thousands, but youre a noticeable one, to someone.And this annexation is different, its the last one.Last chance to grab property, to make connections on the sort of scale the upper houses have always been accustomed to.They dont like to see any of those last chances go to houses like yours.And to make it worse, your subverting the local hierarchy  I used the local hierarchy!Lieutenants, I cautioned.Lieutenant Awns outburst had been loud enough to be heard in the street, if anyone had been on the street this evening.If the Tanmind were running things here, that was as things must be in Amaats mind.Right?But they Lieutenant Awn stopped.I wasnt sure what she had been about to say.Perhaps that they had imposed their authority over Ors relatively recently.Perhaps that they were, in Ors, a numerical minority and Lieutenant Awns goal had been to reach the largest number of people she could.Careful, warned Lieutenant Skaaiat, though Lieutenant Awn hadnt needed the warning.Any Radchaai soldier knew not to speak without thinking.If you hadnt found those weapons, someone would have had an excuse not only to toss you out of Ors, but to come down hard on the Orsians and favor the upper city.Restoring the universe to its proper order.And then, of course, anyone inclined could have used the incident as an example of how soft weve gotten.If wed stuck to so called impartial aptitudes testing, if wed executed more people, if we still made ancillaries  I have ancillaries, Lieutenant Awn pointed out.Lieutenant Skaaiat shrugged.Everything else would have fit, they could ignore that.Theyll ignore anything that doesnt get them what they want.And what they want is anything they can grab.She seemed so calm.Even almost relaxed.I was used to not seeing data from Lieutenant Skaaiat, but this disjunction between her demeanor and the seriousness of the situationLieutenant Awns still extreme distress, and, to be honest, my own discomfort at eventsmade her seem oddly flat and unreal to me.I understand Jen Shinnans part in this, Lieutenant Awn said.I do, I get that.But I dont understand how how anyone else would benefit.The question she couldnt ask directly was, of course, why Anaander Mianaai would be involved, or why she would want to return to some previous, proper order, given she herself had certainly approved any changes.And why, if she wanted such a thing, she didnt merely order the things she desired.If questioned, both lieutenants could, and likely would, say they werent speaking of the Lord of the Radch, but about some unknown person who must be involved, but I was certain that wouldnt hold up under an interrogation with drugs.Fortunately, such an event was unlikely.And I dont see why anyone with that sort of access couldnt just order me gone and put someone they preferred in my place, if that was all they wanted.Maybe that wasnt all they wanted, answered Lieutenant Skaaiat.But clearly, someone did at the very least want those things, and thought they would benefit from doing it this particular way.And you did as much as you could to avoid people getting killed.Anything else wouldnt have made any difference.She emptied her own cup.Youre going to stay in touch with me, she said, not a question, not a request.And then, more gently, Ill miss you.For a moment I thought Lieutenant Awn might cry again.Whos replacing me?Lieutenant Skaaiat named an officer, and a ship.Human troops then.Lieutenant Awn was momentarily disquieted, and then sighed, frustrated.I imagine she was remembering that Ors was no longer her problem.I know, said Lieutenant Skaaiat.Ill talk to her.You watch yourself.Now annexations are a thing of the past, ancillary troop carriers are crowded with the useless daughters of prestigious houses, who cant be assigned to anything lower.Lieutenant Awn frowned, clearly wanting to argue, thinking, maybe, of her fellow Esk lieutenants.Or of herself.Lieutenant Skaaiat saw her expression and smiled ruefully.Well.Dariet is all right.Its the rest Im warning you to look out for.Very high opinions of themselves and very little to justify it.Skaaiat had met some of them during the annexation, had always been entirely, correctly polite to them.You dont need to tell me that, said Lieutenant Awn.Lieutenant Skaaiat poured more arrack, and for the rest of the night their conversation was the sort that needs no reporting.At length Lieutenant Awn slept again, and by the time she woke I had hired boats to take us to the mouth of the river, near Kould Ves, and loaded them with our scant luggage, and my dead segment.In Kould Ves the mechanism that controlled its armor, and a few other bits of tech, would be removed for another use.If youre going to do something that crazy, save it for when itll make a difference, Lieutenant Skaaiat had said, and I had agreed.I still agree.The problem is knowing when what you are about to do will make a difference.Im not only speaking of the small actions that, cumulatively, over time, or in great numbers, steer the course of events in ways too chaotic or subtle to trace.The single word that directs a persons fate and ultimately the fates of those she comes in contact with is of course a common subject of entertainments and moralizing stories, but if everyone were to consider all the possible consequences of all ones possible choices, no one would move a millimeter, or even dare to breathe for fear of the ultimate results.I mean, on a larger and more obvious scale.In the way that Anaander Mianaai herself determined the fates of whole peoples.Or the way my own actions could mean life or death for thousands.Or merely eighty three, huddled in the temple of Ikkt, surrounded.I ask myselfas surely Lieutenant Awn asked herselfwhat would have been the consequences of refusing the order to fire?Straightforwardly, obviously, her own death would have been an immediate consequence.And then, immediately afterward, those eighty three people would have died, because I would have shot them at Anaander Mianaais direct order.No difference, except Lieutenant Awn would be dead.The omens had been cast, and their trajectories were straightforward, calculable, direct, and clear.But neither Lieutenant Awn nor the Lord of the Radch knew that in that moment, had one disk shifted, just slightly, the whole pattern might have landed differently.Sometimes, when omens are cast, one flies or rolls off where you didnt expect and throws the whole pattern out of shape.Had Lieutenant Awn chosen differently, that one segment, cut off, disoriented, and yes, horrified at the thought of shooting Lieutenant Awn, might have turned its gun on Mianaai instead.What then?Ultimately, such an action would only have delayed Lieutenant Awns death, and ensured my ownOne Esksdestruction.Which, since I didnt exist as any sort of individual, was not distressing to me.But the death of those eighty three people would have been delayed.Lieutenant Skaaiat would have been forced to arrest Lieutenant AwnI am convinced she would not have shot her, though she would have been legally justified in doing sobut she would not have shot the Tanmind, because Mianaai would not have been there to give the order.And Jen Shinnan would have had time and opportunity to say whatever it was that the Lord of the Radch had, as things actually happened, prevented her from saying.What difference would that have made?Perhaps a great deal of difference.Perhaps none at all.There are too many unknowns.Too many apparently predictable people who are, in reality, balanced on a knife edge, or whose trajectories might be easily changed, if only I knew.If youre going to do something that crazy, save it for when itll make a difference.But absent near omniscience theres no way to know when that is.You can only make your best approximate calculation.You can only make your throw and try to puzzle out the results afterward.11   The explanation, why I needed the gun, why I wanted to kill Anaander Mianaai, took a long time.The answer was not a simple oneor, more accurately, the simple answer would only raise further questions for Strigan, so I did not attempt to use it but instead began the whole story at the beginning and let her infer the simple answer from the longer, complex one.By the time I was done the night was far advanced.Seivarden was asleep, breathing slow, and Strigan herself was clearly exhausted.For three minutes there was no sound but Seivardens breath accelerating as she transitioned into some state closer to wakefulness, or perhaps was troubled by a dream.And now I know who you are, Strigan said finally, tiredly.Or who you think you are.There was no need for me to say anything in reply to that; by now she would believe what she wished about me, despite what I had told her.Doesnt it bother you, Strigan continued, didnt it ever bother you, that youre slaves?Who?The ships.The warships.So powerful.Armed.The officers inside are at your mercy every moment.What stops you from killing them all and declaring yourselves free?Ive never been able to understand how the Radchaai can keep the ships enslaved.If you think about it, I said, youll see you already know the answer to your question.She was silent again, inward looking.I sat motionless.Waiting on the results of my throw.You were at Garsedd, she said after a while.Yes.Did you know Seivarden?Personally, I mean?Yes.Did you did you participate?In the destruction of the Garseddai?She gestured acknowledgment.I did.Everyone who was there did.She grimaced, with disgust I thought.No one refused.I didnt say that.In fact, my own captain had refused, and died.Her replacement had qualmsshe couldnt have hidden that from her shipbut said nothing and did as she was told.Its easy to say that if you were there you would have refused, that you would rather die than participate in the slaughter, but it all looks very different when its real, when the moment comes to choose.Her eyes narrowed, in disagreement I thought, but I had only spoken the truth.Then her expression changed; she was thinking, perhaps, of that small collection of artifacts in her rooms on Dras Annia Station.You speak the language?Two of them.There had been more than a dozen.And you know their songs, of course.Her voice was slightly mocking.I didnt have a chance to learn as many as I would have liked.And if you had been free to choose, would you have refused?The question is pointless.The choice was not presented to me.I beg to differ, she said, quietly angry at my answer.The choice has always been presented to you.Garsedd was a turning point.It wasnt a direct answer to her accusation, but I couldnt think of what would be a direct answer, that she would understand.The first time so many Radchaai officers came away from an annexation without the certainty that they had done the right thing.Do you still think Mianaai controls the Radchaai through brainwashing or threats of execution?Those are there, they exist, yes, but most Radchaai, like people most places I have been, do what theyre supposed to because they believe its the right thing to do.No one likes killing people.Strigan made a sardonic noise.No one?Not many, I amended.Not enough to fill the Radchs warships.But at the end, after all the blood and grief, all those benighted souls who without us would have suffered in darkness are happy citizens.Theyll agree if you ask!It was a fortunate day when Anaander Mianaai brought civilization to them.Would their parents agree?Or their grandparents?I gestured, halfway between not my problem and not relevant.You were surprised to see me deal gently with a child.It should not have surprised you.Do you think the Radchaai dont have children, or dont love their children?Do you think they dont react to children the way nearly any human does?So virtuous!Virtue is not a solitary, uncomplicated thing.Good necessitates evil and the two sides of that disk are not always clearly marked.Virtues may be made to serve whatever end profits you.Still, they exist and will influence your actions.Your choices.Strigan snorted.You make me nostalgic for the drunken philosophical conversations of my youth.But these are not abstract things were talking about here, this is life and death.My chances of getting what I had come for were slipping from my grasp.For the first time, Radch forces dealt death on an unimaginable scale without renewal afterward.Cut off irrevocably any chance of good coming from what they had done.This affected everyone there.Even the ships?Everyone.I waited for the next question, or the sardonic I dont feel sorry for you, but she just sat silent, looking at me.The first attempts at diplomatic contact with the Presger began shortly afterward.As did, I am fairly certain, the beginnings of the move to replace ancillaries with human soldiers.Only fairly certain because much of the groundwork must have been laid in private, behind the scenes.Why would the Presger get involved with Garsedd?Strigan asked.She could certainly see my reaction to her question, nearly a direct admission that she had the gun; had to knowhad to have known before she spokewhat that admission would tell me.She wouldnt have asked that question if she hadnt seen the gun, examined it closely.Those guns had come from the Presger, the Garseddai had dealt with the aliens, whoever had made the first overture.So much we got from the captured representatives.But I kept my face still.Who knows why the Presger do anything?But Anaander Mianaai asked herself the same question, Why did the Presger interfere?It wasnt because they wanted anything the Garseddai had, they could have reached out and taken whatever they wanted.Though I knew the Presger had made the Garseddai pay, and heavily.And what if the Presger decided to destroy the Radch?Truly to destroy it?And the Presger had such weapons?Youre saying, said Strigan, disbelieving, appalled, that the Presger set the Garseddai up in order to compel Anaander Mianaai to negotiate.I am speaking of Mianaais reaction, Mianaais motives.I dont know or understand the Presger.But I imagine if the Presger meant to compel anything, it would be unmistakable.Unsubtle.I think it was meant merely as a suggestion.If indeed that had anything to do with their actions.All of that, a suggestion.Theyre aliens.Who can understand them?Nothing you can do, she said, after five seconds of silence, can possibly make any difference.Thats probably true.Probably.If everyone who had I searched for the right words.If everyone who objected to the destruction of the Garseddai had refused, what would have happened?Strigan frowned.How many refused?Four.Four.Out of?Out of thousands.Each Justice alone, in those days, had hundreds of officers, along with its captain, and dozens of us had been there.Add the smaller crewed Mercies and Swords.Loyalty, the long habit of obedience, a desire for revengeeven, yes, those four deaths kept anyone else from such a drastic choice.There were enough of your sort to deal with even everyone refusing.I said nothing, waited for the change of expression that would tell me she had thought twice about what she had just said.When it came, I said, I think it might have turned out differently.Youre not one of thousands!Strigan leaned forward, unexpectedly vehement.Seivarden started out of her sleep, looked at Strigan, alarmed and bleary.There are no others on the edge of choosing, Strigan said.No one to follow your lead.And even if there were, you by yourself wouldnt be enough.If you even get as far as facing Mianaaifacing one of Mianaais bodiesyoull be alone and helpless.Youll die without achieving anything!She made a breathy, impatient sound.Take your money.She gestured toward my pack, leaning against the bench I sat on.Buy land, buy rooms on a station, hell, buy a station!Live the life that was denied you.Dont sacrifice yourself for nothing.Which me are you talking to?I asked.Which life that was denied me do you intend I live?Should I send you monthly reports, so you can be sure my choices meet with your approval?That silenced her, for a full twenty seconds.Breq, said Seivarden, as though testing the sound of the name in her mouth, I want to leave.Soon, I answered.Be patient.To my utter surprise she didnt object, but leaned back against a bench and put her arms around her knees.Strigan looked speculatively at her for a moment, then turned to me.I need to think.I gestured acknowledgment and she rose and went into her room and shut the door.Whats her problem?asked Seivarden, apparently innocent of irony.Voice just slightly contemptuous.I didnt answer, only looked at her, not changing my expression.The blankets had marked a line across her cheek, fading now, and her clothes, the Nilter trousers and quilted shirt under the unfastened inner coat, were wrinkled and disheveled.In the past several days of regular food, and no kef, her skin had regained a slightly healthier looking color, but she still looked thin and tired.Why are you bothering with her?she asked me, undisturbed by my scrutiny.As though something had shifted and she and I were suddenly comrades.Fellows.Surely not equals.Not ever.Business I need to attend to.More explanation would be useless, or foolish, or both.Are you having trouble sleeping?Something subtle in her expression communicated withdrawal, closure.I wasnt on her side anymore.She sat silent for ten seconds, and I thought she wouldnt speak to me anymore that night, but instead she drew a long breath and let it out.Yeah.I I need to move around.Im going to go outside.Something had definitely changed, but I didnt know quite what it was, or what had caused it.Its night, I said.And very cold.Take your outer coat and gloves and dont go too far.She gestured acquiescence, and even more astonishingly, put on her outer coat and gloves before going out the two doors without a single bitter word, or even a resentful glance.And what did I care?She would wander off and freeze, or she would not.I arranged my own blankets and lay down to sleep, without waiting to see if Seivarden came back safe or not.When I woke, Seivarden was asleep on her own pile of blankets.She hadnt thrown her coat on the floor, but instead hung it beside the others, on a hook near the door.I rose and went to the cupboard to find she had also replenished the food storesmore bread, and a bowl on the table holding a block of slushy, slowly melting milk, another beside it holding a chunk of bov fat.Behind me Strigans door clicked open.I turned.He wants something, she said to me, quietly.Seivarden didnt stir.Or anyway theres some angle hes playing.I wouldnt trust him if I were you.I dont.I dropped a hunk of bread in a bowl of water and set it aside to soften.But I do wonder whats come over her.Strigan looked amused.Him, I amended.Probably the thought of all the money youre carrying, observed Strigan.You could buy a lot of kef with that.If thats the case, its not a problem.Its all for paying you.Except my fare back up the ribbon, and a bit more for emergencies.Which, in this case, would probably mean Seivardens fare as well.What happens to addicts in the Radch?
