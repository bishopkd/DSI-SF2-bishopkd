Scile said.CalVin indicated a chandelier above us, tugging itself with slow grace into the darker areas of the room, extruding and reabsorbing tendril end lights.Biorigged stuff, of course, they said.You know that.Youve seen it in Bremen, too.A lot of our food.And some gems and bits and pieces.Like most Embassytowners I was rather vague on the details of the barters they were describing.And gold.They were on duty, but CalVin hosted well, that first party.Scile stood by the table of delicacies, human and Ariekene, waiting.Fraternising with the locals, at last?Ehrsul had come quietly up behind me.She spoke suddenly, made me start and laugh.Hes so well behaved, I said, nodding in Sciles direction.Patient, she said.But then, you dont have to be, youve already met the Hosts.She was only passing through, she said, supposedly on some upgrading errand.She swivelled and rolled past Scile with a whispered word, and he greeted her and watched her go.You know what CalVin told me?he said quietly to me.He gestured with his glass towards Ehrsuls retreating form.She can speak it.It sounds flawless.All the Ambassadors know exactly what shes saying.But if she tries it with the Hosts, they dont get a word.He met my eyes.Shes not really speaking Language at all.He continued his effort to cover his impatiencehe was, at least, not rude about it.CalVin made sure to introduce him to those Staff and Ambassadors present he didnt know.And of course, finally, when they arrived, with that usual shift in the room, to the Hosts.It was the first time for thousands of hours Id seen them so close.There were four.Three were in prime, in their third instar, and their tall outlines quivered with whiskers.The last was in finisits dotage.Its abdomen was massive and pendulous and its limbs spindled.It walked firmly but was mindless.Its siblings had brought it as a kind of charity.It followed them under instinct, by sight and chemical trail.It was an evolutionary strategy on Arieka shared by more than one phylum that an animals last incarnation was as a food store for the young.They could gnaw at the nutritional swathings of its abdomen for days without killing it.Our Hosts had done so, in their early history, but they had given the practice up generations before as, we inferred, a barbarism.They mourned when their fellows entered their penultimate form, when their minds died, and respectfully shepherded the ambulatory corpses till they fell apart.The undead thing bumped the table, upsetting wine and canaps, and HenRy, LoGan, CalVin and the other Ambassadors laughed politely as if at a joke.Please, CalVin said, and brought Scile forward, towards the honoured indigens.I could not read Sciles face.Scile Cho Baradjian, this is Speaker and then in Cut and Turn at once they said the lead Hosts name.It looked down at us from its jutting coralline extrusion, each random bud studded with an eye., CalVin said, together.Only Ambassadors could speak Host names.Waving on a stalk throat by its neck, its Cut mouth terribly like human lips, the Host muttered: and at the level of our chests, where its body swelled, its Turn mouth opened and coughed, emitting little rounded vowel sounds, tao dao thao.It wore the organs of tiny animals coiled about its neck.Something wound between its stiletto feet, a companion animal.One accompanied all the Ariekei but the brain dead old timer.It was the size of a baby, a grub thing with stump legs and filigree antennae, its back punctuated with holes, some ringed with inlaid metal.Its locomotion was between a scamper and a convulsion.It was a zelle, a biorigged battery beast, into which leads and wires could be slotted, and out of which, depending on what its owner fed it, different power would flow.The Ariekene city was full of such sources.stepped forward on four legs a little like a spiders, long, too jointed, dark haired, and extended its wings: from its back its auditory fanwing, in many colours; from its front, from below its larger mouth, its limb of interaction and manipulation, its giftwing.We would like to shake your giftwing with our hands, CalVin said in Language, and Scile, his face still closed to me, only pursing his lips a tiny bit, held out his hand.The Host clasped my husbands hand in a greeting that would have made no sense to it, and then it clasped mine.So Scile saw Language spoken.He listened.He asked quick questions of CalVin between their exchanges with the Host, which they, to my surprise, put up with.What?Is he insinuating that you couldnt agree...?No, its......more complicated than that.Hold on.Then CalVin would speak together., I heard them say at one point; they were saying please.I got almost all of it, Scile told me afterwards.He was very excited.They shift tenses, he said.When they mentioned the negotiations theythe Ariekei, I meanwere in present discontinuous, but then they shifted into the elided past present.Thats for, uh...I knew what it was for, I assured him.Hed told me already.How could you not smile at him?Id listened to him with affection, if not always with interest, over hundreds of hours.Does it ever occur to you that this language is impossible, Avice?he said.Im, poss, ih, bul.It makes no sense.They dont have polysemy.Words dont signify: they are their referents.How can they be sentient and not have symbolic language?How do their numbers work?It makes no sense.And Ambassadors are twins, not single people.Theres not one mind behind Language when they speak it...Theyre not twins, love, I said.Whatever.Youre right.Clones.Doppels.The Ariekei think theyre hearing one mind, but theyre not.I raised one eyebrow and he said, No theyre not.Its like we can only talk to them because of a mutual misunderstanding.What we call their words arent words: they dont, you know, signify.And what they call our minds arent minds at all.He didnt laugh when I did.You have to wonder, he said.Dont you?What it is they doStaff I meanto make two people think theyre one.Yeah but theyre not two, I said.Thats the point about Ambassadors.Thats where your whole theory falls down.But they could have been.Should have been.So what did they do?Unlike monozygots, even doppels fingerprints were moulded and made identical.On principle.Every evening and morning Ambassadors corrected.Artmind microsurgery found whatever tiny marks and abrasions each half of each pair had uniquely picked up over the preceding day or night, and if they couldnt be eradicated, they were replicated in the untouched half.Scile meant that, and more.He wanted to see the children: young doppels in the crche.He could still scandalise me with stuff like that.Not that such requests got responses.He wanted to watch how they were raised.STAFF AND AMBASSADORS went into the city regularly, but only the young or gauche would ask for details.As naughty children we hacked communications and found pictures and reports we thought were secret (that of course werent very), that gave us insinuations of what occurred.Sometimes, CalVin told us, they call us in for what we call moots.They chantnot words, or words we dont know.And when theyre done, one by one we take a turn, singing to them.Whats it for?I asked, and simultaneously CalVin replied, We dont know, and smiled.Everyone was in his or her best again, for another event.Very different from any previous.I wore a dress studded with oxblood jade.Scile wore a tuxedo and white rose.The flyer that came for us was a biorigged mongrel, Ariekene breed techniques but its quasi living interior tailored to Terre needs, and piloted by our artminds.It had been a huge shock to us when CalVin had told us we could accompany them.This wasnt a party in the Embassy.We were going into the Host city, to a Festival of Lies.Id spent thousands of hours in the immer.Id been to ports on tens of countries on tens of worlds, had even experienced that travellers shock we floakers called the retour, when after preparations for the alterity of a new world, one walks a quite inhuman capital and stares at intricate indigens, and starts to suspect that one has been there before.Still, the night Scile and I dressed to go into the city, I was nervous as I had not been since I left Arieka.I watched through boat windows as we flew over the ivy and roofs of my little ghetto city.I breathed out when we crossed over the zone where the architecture went from the brick and ivied wood of my youth to the polymers and biorigged flesh of the Hosts, from alley tangles to street analogues of other topographies.Building things were coming down and being replaced.Construction sites like combined slaughterhouses, puppy farms and quarries.There were about twenty of us: five Ambassadors, a handful of Staff, and we two.Scile and I smiled at each other through our masks and breathed in the exhalations of our little portable aeoli.Quickly, very quickly, we were touched down on a roof, and followed our companions out and down and into an edifice, in the city.A complex, many chambered place the angles of which astonished me.Everyone who had ever talked about my poise would have laughed to see me literally stagger backwards in that room.Walls and ceilings moved with ratcheting mechanical life like the offspring of chains and crabs.A kind Staff member steered Scile and me.Our party walked without Ariekene chaperone.I wanted to touch the walls.I could hear my heart.I heard Hosts.Suddenly we were among them.More than Id ever seen.The rooms were alive, cells rainbowing as we entered.Ariekei were speaking in turn, and the Ambassadors sung in alien politeness.Through a swallowing corridor, several Hosts in their final instars milled in dignified mindlessness.A bridge whistled to us.For the first time in my life I saw Host young: steaming nutrient broths effervesced with elvers.Further off was the fightcrche, where the savage little second instars played with and killed each other.In a hall crisscrossed with walkways on tendons and platforms on muscular limbs were hundreds of Ariekei, giftwings extended, fanwings pretty with inks and natural pigments, gathered for the Festival of Lies.FOR HOSTS, speech was thought.It was as nonsensical to them that a speaker could say, could claim, something it knew to be untrue as, to me, that I could believe something I knew to be untrue.Without Language for things that didnt exist, they could hardly think them; they were vaguer by far than dreams.What imaginaries any of them could conjure at all must be misty and trapped in their heads.Our Ambassadors, though, were human.They could lie as well in Language as in our own language, to the Hosts unending delight.These eisteddfods of mendacity had not existedhow could they?before we Terre came.The Festivals of Lies had occurred almost as long as Embassytown had existed: they were one of our first gifts to the Hosts.Id heard of them, but never expected to see one.Our Ambassadors went among the hundreds of whickering Ariekei.Staff, Scile and Iwe who couldnt speak herewatched.The room was punctured with ventricles: I could hear it breathing.Theyre welcoming us, Scile told me, listening to all the voices.More.Its saying that, uh, theyll see, I think, miracles, now.Hes asking our first something to step forward.Its a compound, wait, uh...He sounded tense.Our first liar.How do they make that word?I said.Oh you know, he said.Sayer of things that are not, that sort of thing.Furniture was extruding in the room as it self organised into a vague amphitheatre.Ambassador MayBel, elderly, stylish women, stood before an Ariekes, which raised what looked like a big fibre trailing fungus in its giftwing.It inserted the dangles into the sockets of the zelle jigging by its legs, and the mushroom thing made a sound and glowed quickly changing colours, cycling to a nacreous blue.The Host spoke.It says: describe it,  Scile whispered.MayBel answered, May in the Cut, Bel the Turn voice.The Ariekei stepped up and down, a sudden unanimity.A tense excitement.They tottered and chattered.What did they say?I said.MayBel?What did they?Scile looked as if in disbelief at me.Theyre saying Its red.MayBel bowed.The Ariekene hubbub continued while Ambassador LeRoy took their place.The Ariekes stroked its zelle, and the object attached to it changed shape and colour, altered into a great green teardrop.Describe it, Scile translated again.LeRoy glanced at each other and began.They said: Its a bird,  Scile said.The Ariekei muttered.The noun was shorthand for a local winged form, as well as meaning our Embassytown birds.LeRoy spoke again and several Ariekei shouted, out of control.LeRoy says its flying away, Scile said into my helmet.I swear I saw Hosts crane their eye corals up as if the lifeless plasm might have taken off.Le and Roy spoke together again.They say...Scile frowned as he followed.They say its become a wheel, he said, over the strange pandemonium of the audience.One at a time every Ambassador lied.The Hosts grew boisterous in a fashion Id never seen, then to my alarm seemed intoxicated, literally lie drunk.Scile was tense.The room was whispering, echoing the furore of its inhabitants.It was CalVins turn.They declaimed.And the walls are disappearing,  Scile translated.And the ivy of Embassytown is winding about our legs...Hosts examined their limbs....and the rooms turning to metal and Im growing larger and the room and I are becoming one.Thats enough, I thought, and someone must have agreed, and whispered to CalVin.They bowed and stepped away.The Ariekei slowly calmed.I thought it was over.But then, as we stared, a few Host came forward.Its a sport, said Cal, or Vin, who approached, sweating, as they saw my surprise.An extreme sport, said the other.For oh for years now, theyve been trying to mimic us.A few are getting not too bad at it.I watched.What colour is it?the Ariekes holding the target object asked the competitors, as it had the Terre.One by one each Host would try to lie.Most could not.They emitted croons and clickings that were effort.Red, Scile translated.The bulb was red, and the speaker double whined in what I presumed was disappointment.Blue, said another, also truthfully; the object changed each time.Green.Black.Some made noises that were only noises, clicks and wheezes of failure, not words at all.Every tiniest success was celebrated.When the object was a yellow, the Host trying to lie, an Ariekes with a scissor shape on its fanwing, shuddered and retracted several of its eyes, gathered itself, and in its two voices said a word that would have translated as something like yellow beige.It was hardly a dramatic untruth, but the crowd were rapturous at it.A group of Hosts approached us.Avice, Cal or Vin said politely.This is...and they started to say names.I never saw the point of these niceties between the likes of me and Ariekei.Understanding only Language speakers to have minds, they must have thought it odd when Ambassadors carefully introduced them to speechless amputated half things.As if an Ariekes insisted on one politely saying hello to its battery animal.So I thought, but it didnt turn out that way.The Ariekei shook my hand with their giftwings when CalVin asked them to.They had cool dry skin.I shut my mouth to obscure whatever emotion was rising in me (Im still not sure what it was).The Ariekei registered something as the Ambassadors told them my name.They spoke, and Scile quickly translated into my ear.Theyre saying: This?he told me.This is the one?Latterday, 3  THERE ARE WAYS to tell Hosts apart.Theres the fingerprint unique patterning on each fanwing (any observation of this fact was generally followed by the tedious mention of the fact that Embassytown was the only place where Terre fingerprints were not all unique).There are subtleties of carapace shading, of spines on limbs, of eye antler shape.These days I rarely bothered to pay attention, nor with a few exceptions did I learn the names of the Ariekei I met.So I couldnt say if during that first or any later visit to the city, I had previously met any of the Host delegation that joined us all those kilohours later, in Diplomacy Hall, to greet EzRa, the impossible new Ambassador.So far as I could tell all were in middle age, in their third instar, and therefore sentient.Some wore sashes indicating incomprehensible (to me) rank or predilections; some were studded with ugly little jewels where their chitin was thick.The most senior of the Ambassadors, MayBel and JoaQuin, were walking them slowly through the room, giving each of them a glass of champagnecarefully rigged to be palatable to them.The Hosts held them daintily and sipped with their Cut mouths.I saw Ez watch them.Ras coming, Ehrsul said.What do we call him?I said.What are he and Ez to each other?Theyre not doppels.Wherever in the room he was, and with whom, Scile, I knew, would be as tense at the strangeness of all this as I.  Ez and Ra approached each other, changing how they held themselves, getting into another mode.How could it have happened?All those structures in place, for all those thousands of hours, years.Embassytown years, the years I grew up with, long months named in silly nostalgia for an antique calendar, each many dozen day weeks long.For almost an Embassytown century, since Embassytown was born, structures had been in place.Clone farms had been run; careful and unique child rearing had raised doppels into Ambassadors, with the skills of governance they would need.It was all under Bremens aegis of course: they were our home power; our public buildings all displayed clocks and calendars in Charo City time.But so far out here in the immer, everything should have been under Staff control.CalVin once told me that Bremens original expectations of Ariekas reserves, of luxuries and oddities and local gold, had been over optimistic.Ariekene bioriggery was valuable, though, certainly.More elegant and functional than any of the crude chimeras or particle spliced jiggery pokery any Terre I knew of had ever managed, these Ariekene things were moulded from fecund plasms by the Hosts with techniques we could not merely not mimic, but that were impossible according to our sciences.Was that enough?In any case, no colony is ever wound down.How and why had Charo City trained this impossible Ambassador?Id heard, like we all had, the story of the experiment and the freak result, the empathy reading spiking off the Stadt scale.But even if these two random friends did have such a connection, for whatever contingent psychic reason, why would they become Ambassadors?Wyatts excited, Ehrsul said.They all are.Gharda had approached, her music shift over, her instrument folded away.Why wouldnt they be?she said.Ladies and gentlemen.Augmens relayed JoaQuins voices to hidden speakers.JoaQuin and MayBel went into encomia to their Ariekene guests.When that was done, they welcomed the new Ambassador.Id been to comings out when Ambassadors came of age (strange, arrogant, charming young doppels greeting the crowd).But this of course was nothing like those appointments.JoaQuin said, This is an extraordinary time.We find ourselves with the task......the enviable task, the strange task......of coming up with a new kind of welcome.Perhaps some of you had heard that we have a new Ambassador?Polite laughs.Weve spent a good deal of time with them over the last few days......got to know them, and they us.These are unusual times.Hear hear, said RanDolph.Its a privilege to be here, at an event I hope you will indulge us......if we describe as history.This is an historic moment.Ladies and gentlemen......Hosts......all our guests.Its our very great pleasure to welcome to Embassytown......Ambassador EzRa.As the applause died, JoaQuin turned to the Hosts who stood beside them, and said our new Ambassadors name accurately, in Language., they said.The Hosts craned their eye corals.Thank you, Ambassador JoaQuin, Ez said.He conferred quietly with Ra.Its a great pleasure to be here, Ez continued.He said a few standard, gracious things.I was watching the other Ambassadors.Ras self introduction was brief, little more than his own name.We want to stress what an honour this is for us, Ez said.Embassytowns one of the most important outposts of Bremen, and a vibrant community in its own right.Were more grateful than we can say for your wonderful welcome.We look forward to becoming a part of the Embassytown community, working together for its future, and working together for Bremens.There was applause of course.Ez waited.We look forward to working with you, Ra said.Some Staff and Ambassadors were trying to hide nervousness.Some, I thought, eagerness.We realise that you must have questions, Ez said.Please dont be shy about them.We realise were an...anomaly, for now...He smiled.Were happy to talk about it, though to be honest we dont really know why or how we can do what we do, either.Were a mystery to us as well as to you.The laugh he waited for and got was brief.Now wed like to do something weve trained very long and hard to do.We are an Ambassador Im very proud to say thatand we have a job to do.What we would like to do is to greet our gracious Hosts.This applause seemed genuine.The vespcams swarmed and wallscreens showed images, from scores of angles, of Ez and Ra coming together, ushered by their new colleagues toward the Hosts.The Ariekei stood in a semicircle.Ive no idea what their conception was of what was happening.If nothing else, they knew that this was an Ambassador and that it was called .EzRa conferred together like any other Ambassador did, whispering, preparing their words.The Hosts craned their eyes.Every Terre in the room seemed to lean in, to hold her or his breath.With great theatre, EzRa turned and spoke Language.EZ WAS THE CUT, Ra the Turn.They spoke well, beautifully.I had heard enough of it to tell that.Their accent was good, their timing good.Their voices were well suited.They said to the Hosts that it was an honour to meet them., they said.Good greetings.That was the moment everything changed.EzRa looked at each other, smiled.Their first official pronouncement.If it hadnt been an absurd faux pas I think we would all have clapped.Im sure many people hadnt really thought them capable.We were busy listening to them speak, and gauging their abilities.We didnt notice everything change.I dont think any of us at that moment noticed the reactions of the Hosts.Part Two  FESTIVALS    Latterday, 4  WE WERE ALL WATCHING the new Ambassador.Ez hunkered down into a slightly pugnacious pose.He opened and closed his fists.I could tell he enjoyed what he was doing.He looked up at the Hosts from below a gathered brow.Ra watched them sidelong.He pulled himself up, so tall and straight that he seemed to teeter slightly.The two of them were so absurdly distinct it was like a joke that erred in overdoing it.I was reminded of Laurel and Hardy, of Merlo and Rattleshape, of Sancho Panza and Don Quixote.When they were done speaking, a wave of something went through all of us in Diplomacy Hall so palpably it was as if it rippled the ivy.I turned to Ehrsul and raised my eyebrows.We all knew this had been momentous, but there were perhaps a full five seconds before any of us realised that anything bad had happened.THE HOSTS were swaying as if they were at sea.One spasmed its giftwing and its fanwing, another kept them unnaturally still.One opened and closed its membranes several times in neurotic repetition.Three were plugged into their zelles by flesh skeins that bled in chemicals or energy, and by I suppose feedback the untoward behaviour of the Hosts infected their battery beasts.The little ambulatory generators staggered, emitted sounds unlike any Id heard them make before.In very slow and unnerving unison, the Ariekei emerged from their trance.Their eye corals drooped toward us, and at last focused.They straightened and unstiffened their legs, as if coming out of sleep.EzRa were frowning.They whispered to each other, and spoke again.Are the bodies and/or brains of our Hosts troubled by invading biological entities or an allergic reaction to an environmental factor?they said, I later learnt.That is they said, Has something happened to make you suboptimal?They said, Are you alright?Their words sounded as if Ez said some stuttering poem while Ra mimicked birds.As they spoke the Ariekei jerked again, again in that ugly simultaneity, the linked zelles snapping back with them.They were lost back to their glaze.This time one made a noise, a moan from its Cut mouth.JoaQuin and MayBel conferred in agitation.MayBel approached the Ariekei.The Hosts came gradually again, very gradually, out of what had taken them.CalVin saw me.We stared at each other, across the room, for the first time in some time.I saw in their eyes nothing but fear.STAFF RALLIED, Ambassadors stepped in, bustled and led the Hosts away.As the Ariekei woke from whatever this was, they started declaiming, talking across each other, loud and chaotically.They were asking for the new Ambassador.Where is?they kept saying.Where is?I understood enough Language to know that.Ladies and Gentlemen, please, one of JoaQuin said.Someone from Staff must have spoken to the musicians on duty, because their playing started again.Id not even realised they had stopped.Waiters recirculated.I saw security officers going somewhere, Simmon among them, controlled but in obvious urgency.Excuse us, ladies and gentlemen, JoaQuin said.Our guests, the Hosts, have been...JoaQuin paused and conferred.Theres been a small misunderstanding......absolutely nothing to be concerned about...I saw LoGan, CharLott, LuCy, AnDrew crowding the Hosts away.Nothing at all important and entirely our own fault...The two of them laughed.Were rectifying things now.Theres absolutely no reason to concern yourselves!The party continues.Please join us in raising your glasses.Many locals were eager to be reassured.Newcomers and temporary guests didnt know how concerned they should be.We raised our glasses.To the captain and crew of the immership Tolpuddle Martyrs Response...said JoaQuin, ...to our most welcome immigrants, new citizens......and above all, to Ambassador EzRa.May they have a long and happy career here in Embassytown.To EzRa!We all said it.The recipients of our toast raised their own drinks in reciprocation.They looked at the door through which the Hosts had been taken.It was to the credit of Staff that the party didnt die.Within ten minutes most people were behaving more or less as they had been before.What the fuck was that?I said quietly to Gharda.No bloody idea, she said.I couldnt see Scile.There were several Ambassadors still in the room, along with Staff.I approached EdGar, but to my shock they turned away from me.I said their name in such a way that they couldnt pretend not to have heard, and they glanced and said, Not now, Avice.You dont even know what I want, I said.Really, Avice.Not now.They interspersed their words with smiles of greeting to those who passed them.The crowd parted a moment and as if by plan revealed Cal or Vin.He still stared right at me.I was so startled I stopped moving.I couldnt see my watchers doppel.The party concealed him again.Gharda reappeared, with the pilot on her arm.She saw me and hesitated, looked a query at me.I waved, by all means.It mattered not at all how much more travelled I was than my citys rulers, how airily Id given them knowledge, how eagerly theyd received it.As EdGar walked away, I was nothing.It was they and the other Ambassadors who would, in closed session, decide what had happened, and what would happen now.They made law.Formerly, 3  A LONG TIME AGO I performed a strange unpleasant ritual in the shell of a restaurant.For that I was, Ambassadors and Staff had occasionally told me, feted by the Ariekei in my absence.That had meant nothing until the moment in the hall, at the festival, after the lying, when the Hosts discovered who I was.They spoke rapidly, craned their eye corals.They spoke me every day, Scile told me afterwards.That was what they said to CalVin.I do not know, one Host said to CalVin, about me, how I did without her, how I thought what I needed to think.Her?This was the question that we called the Tallying Mystery: did the Hosts consider each Ambassador one mind, double bodied people?And if so, did they think the rest of us half things, irrelevances, machines?A city full of the Ambassadors marionettes?When they knew me as simile, they asked for me to come back, but I was never sure if I was guest, exhibit, or something else.When we went, the Hosts took care of us, whether or not they understood that we were people.I accepted their invitations because Scile could always come with me.A present to him, for which he was effusive, though I think he wanted to talk, to debrief, after the events more than I would.We would be ushered to the Hosts halls.There were usually Ambassadors and viziers and others there too, and these glimpses of secrets that had gone on all my life, the toing and froing of Staff in the Host city, were almost as disturbing to me as anything else that happened.Id keep spotting Ambassadors walking flesh corridors in conversation with Ariekei, places I couldnt imagine any human having a purpose.These events, to which they had no in, were titillations to most of my friends.A festival?Of lies?Gharda said at a party after the first one.The Hosts asked for you?They were all gathered around me demanding to know what the city was like, and I laughed because someone said Thats import!exactly as we had when we were children.My occasional presence in the city was troubling, I could tell, to the Ambassadors.They didnt like seeing me there.This was their mystery.Staff debriefed me exhaustively after each of these trips, asking what Id seen, what Id understood.The second time I entered the city, into another hall with a crowd of Hosts, I was left near a collection of obscure objects and anaesthetised Ariekene animals, and with four other humans, enzymatic lights bowing in the curves of their aeoli helmets.Two were Ambassador LeNa, who ignored me.The other two were young men, commoners like me.Hello, said one.He smiled enthusiastically and I did not smile back.Im Hasser: Im an example.Davyns a topic.Youre Avice, arent you?Youre a simile.NEITHER THIS, nor any of the other times I went in, was an event the same as the first gathering Id attended.They were more chaotic, and, I learnt, less focused.There had for a while been a vogue among the Hosts for what were, more or less, conventions.Celebrations of Language, with broader remits than just the rare lies.They would gather as many of us necessary constructed facts as they could in one place, as many enLanguaged elements as possibleanimate, inanimate, sentient and notand come to look at us, use and theorise us, without consensus.We sat polite through wheezing, stuttering, sung arguments around and about us.I found it less compelling than the devoted lying Id first seen.I was lulled by the roar and whisper of the Cut  and the Turn mouths, while Scile tried to translate.Hosts stamped back and forward, disagreeing in factions.Something like a polemic, I gathered, went on between those who thought me a useful figure of speech, and those who did not.It was a crippled, strange debate, I think.There were those Hosts who thought something better could have been said and better thoughts therefore thought, had I only been made to do other things than I had.That I could have been a better simile for those in need of one to speak precisely; to speak about those somethings other than me that I wasthey would have asserted like.But those critics of course couldnt say what those thoughts would have been, because they could not have them.But...said Scile.He was unhappy.They must be in the back of their minds, those thoughts, I said.Is that why theyre angry?Theyve been denied them.Hold on, he said.One of thems saying about you: Its a comparison, and...it is something new.I dont understand.I dont understand.Alright, my love, just...Hey, Scile whispered.Theyre using the other figures of speech.He indicated our Embassytown companions, at whom the Hosts stared.He turned his head in surprise.If I understand them...that man Hasserhe lied to us.Hes not an example: hes a simile, like you.Whatever the question marks over my efficacy, I must have had my uses: for the several weeks these events were in vogue, the Hosts kept bringing me back.SOMETHING SOURED between CalVin and me.For weeks during our sex Id teased them that I could tell the difference in the way they touched me: they probably knew there was a little truth to it.When wed first got together Id been immaturely excited that I was sleeping with an Ambassador.But that rather performed giddiness didnt last long.I remember the feel of them, the cool of their links in their necks, minimalist jewellery amplifying their thoughts into each other.I remember watching them touch each otherpeculiar, unique erotics.Afterwards, I might grin salaciously when I distinguished them, but it was an edgy game.Cal, I would say, pointing at one, then the other.Vin.Cal...Vin.They might smile, might look away.I could sometimes, especially in the mornings, see differences.The marks of night timea face imprinted by a pillow, particular bags below eyes.CalVin never left long before ablutions, locking the door to the correction chamber and emerging with all those tiny differences effaced or copied.They didnt like that I was being asked back to the conferences and conventions.But Staff would hardly turn down Host requests like that.Once one of CalVin told me in sudden fury, apropos of nothing Id noticed, that Ambassadors had no bloody power at all, that the other Staff and viziers and the rest made all the bloody decisions, that he and his doppel had less say than anyone.I argued with them, now, sometimes.After one really unpleasant altercation I swear I did not start, Cal or Vin stayed for seconds in the doorway staring at me, with an expression I couldnt read, while his doppel walked away.Perhaps I wouldnt have liked it if they could immerse, I supposed.I doubted I would have cared, though.Its not the same, I said to the one still there.You speak Language.I am it.THERE WERE HOSTS who favoured my simile above all others, and came to every event at which I was present.They extolled my uses, over all the allegories or rhetorical devices embedded in varying ways in men and women and other things present.You have fans, Scile said.These were my months of simile fame.I saw Hasser several other times; we would stand and wait while we were deployed in harsh arguments.There were Language dissidents, urging a reconception of what I and the other similes might have been.From the reactions of the other Hosts, this thought experiment was in bad taste.After one such, I asked Scile if hed heard the Hosts speak to Hasser, and if so what he was about.Scile understood Language as well as an Ambassador, but I dont know how you bloody things work, he said.I never see any relation between what you mean and what theyre talking about, what they compare you with and use you for.So are you asking what do they think with Hasser?Ive no idea.That isnt what I mean.You mean literally what does he mean?Right.Like, foundation fact, like I mean girl who ate...well, you know.Scile hesitated.Im not sure, he said, but I think it was, is...what they said was its like the boy who was opened up and closed again.We stared at each other.Oh God, I said.Yes.I cant be sure, so dont...but, yes.Jesus.In the corvid, being hauled back to Embassytown, I said to Hasser, Why didnt you tell me you were a simile?Sorry, he said.Overheard, then?He smiled.Its complicated.Its something I think about a lot, being simile.But I dont know how you feel about it...For some of us, if youre...If you want to talk about this stuff, and he sounded guarded but excited, there are a few of us who think its important.Similes?I said.You, what, hang out?Well.They knew other tropes and Language moments too, of course, he explained.But it was certain of the similes in particular who had found a community with each other.I despised them instantly he told me.I dont know how we missed you, he said.I know they say you, but how did the Hosts miss you for these events all this time?How did you miss us?I suppose being Language was never the main thing in my life, I said.I think I accidentally showed my contempt.If Id not learnt to immerse and hadnt got into the out, I reminded myself, I might have spent my days in the bars and halls and drink houses where these similes gathered.It must be a strange kind of life and notoriety, but it was something.I wanted to apologise for showing my sneer.I asked him what it all meant to him.After an initial guardedness, he said, To be part of it!Language.Latterday, 5  NONE OF US with any nous believed the party was really back to normal.Ehrsul.I whispered to her and made motions, but when, winding her long chassis precisely she pathed her way to me, it was to tell me she couldnt hack any coms to work out what was happening.I found a couple of the last Ambassadors in the room, MagDa and EsM.Whats going on?I said to them.Hey.MagDa.Please.We have to...one of EsM said.Its...Everythings under control.MagDa.Whats going on?Mag and Da and Es and M looked as if they were going to say something.EsM had never liked me, had a common Ambassador opinion of the returned outgoer, immerser, floaker, and so on, but still, they hesitated.To my great shock Scile appeared beside us.He met my eyes, either without emotion or hiding it.MagDa, he said.You have to come and talk to Ra.They nodded and I lost that moment.As the five of them walked away, I grabbed Sciles arm.I kept my face impassive, and he looked back at me similarly.It hardly surprised me that he was closer to whatever was happening than I.  Hed been working with Staff, hed been in cahoots with Ambassadors.Theyd always been so focused on using Language they werent used to learning about it, and as things had shifted in Embassytown, and it had become useful to think about such questions, they had, I understood, been fascinated with his theories.His work had made him useful.He had certainly been to more Staff functions than I had.So?I said.I was only slightly surprised at my brazen self.Floakers did what they had to.Whats going on?Avvy, he said.I cant tell you.Scile, do you know whats happening?No.I dont.Id a. ..I really dont.This isnt what I expected.Near us two people touched wine glasses like little bells.The musicians were drunk now and the music was veering.This was the single chance many locals would have to meet the immerser crew, and they were taking advantage.Seeing pairs and little groups leave the party, I remembered that borrowed sex appeal of immer.Id benefited from it myself on my return: it had been a heady few weeks.I have to go, Scile said.They need me.Es took one of his arms, M the other.They surely knew relations were bad between Scile and me, and perhaps even why.I doubt they were sleeping with him.Sciles assignations were brief and occasional.Though all Bremen marriages were legal in Embassytown, locals tended to invoke exclusive, property based models.I was jealous of Scile, of course, but at what hed become, and what secrets he knew.IT WAS HALF an hour to my flat.Ehrsul came with me.In a lot of countries Ive been in the populace all have personal vehicles.All but the largest streets of Embassytown were too narrow, and often too steep, for that.There were altanimals and some biorigged carriages to take certain routes, which switched from wheels or treads to legs where necessary, but most people went on foot.Embassytown was a small and crowded place, our population growth limited by the edge of the aeoli breath.It was surrounded by the Host city, except at the very northern point, where Ariekene plains started.Semilegal urban growth was tolerated, jury rigged rooms sutured to walls, looming over alleys like eaves, thrown up on roofs, always ready to be abandoned.Most Staff tacitly approved of such enterprising space maximisation.Here and there were half trained biorigged bits and pieces, some backstreet crossbred with Terretech and holding together through luck, tended aspects of domesticity.Arced over Embassytown was the Embassy itself, edging up to those plains.At something over a hundred metres it was the tallest building we had.A fat pillar, studded with horizontal boughs and landing pads, to and from which, even so late, bioluminescent corvids moved.Like something melted, the Embassy spread out at its base and became part of the streets that surrounded it.Staff neighbourhoods were half covered, as much the innards of the Embassy itself as alleyways.Ehrsul and I descended by panelled lift, through walkways, corridors that became things between corridors and streets, arcades half open, with unglazed windows, and then into the streets proper, and the breeze.God, its nice to get outside, I said.Were not, not really, Ehrsul said.Were all always in the aeoli breath.A room of air.It made me think about her, that she didnt leave Embassytown, though she could have.She wasnt programmed to be interested in the city, I supposed.I shied away from that.In my rooms I sipped more wine, and Ehrsul companionably made trid visions of a similar glass, made her trid head drink from it.She patched into my station but could find out nothing about the evenings occurrences on the localnet.Ill try again when I get home, she said.No offence but your machine...youd have more luck banging rocks together.Id been to her home several times.It was tiny, and sparse, but there were pictures on the walls, a kitchen, furniture for human and other guests (one beautiful, obscene looking Shurasi stool).Her flat and its tasteful accoutrements were perhaps for my and others benefits: her pictures, her coffee table, her imported rug elements of an operating system, designed to make her user friendly.These ruminations felt disgraceful.I wondered about EzRa.Formerly, 4  HASSER BUZZED ME.How did you get my number?I said.Please, he said.He didnt sound particularly intimidated, though I was deploying my best fuck you immerser swagger.Its not hard to track you down.Come and have a drink.Why would I come and have a drink?Please, he said.There are people you should really meet.The similes met in an amiably collapsing part of Embassytown, near our young ruins.I took a long route, walking for most of the morning, past many ignored and homeless automa.I even passed the coin wall and as I always did glanced at the door.There are slums on Charo City, and Ive spent more time than Id like in their environs.Many of the ports at which Ive docked are in or by such areas: its as if slumism is an infection carried by ships.When in the course of Embassytown parties, members of reformer factions started mouthing, I tended to interrupt them.Slums?Id say.Believe me, my friend, Ive seen slums.You know where Ive been?I know from slums.We dont have slums.In Embassytown there were no rag draped children playing with paper boats in stinking water, in potholes; no people selling themselves for food to immersers and people from the out, nor hawking bits of their DNA or flesh to bioccaneers; wattle and daub huts didnt shake as ships rose and descended overhead, didnt collapse every few landings.Our social graphs were pretty flat: differentials of money and power were minor.Excepting Staff, and Ambassadors.The wallscreens and projectors in our unkempt areas were on forgotten loops, their cycles degraded.Some advertised discontinued products, or luxuries from the out of which I knew there had been none left for a long time.Here as elsewhere in Embassytown the walls were overgrown with ivy and altivy, and specked with a local moss analogue, so the light from those advertisements and crude public art was dappled with leaf shadows.There were places where, pushed through the foliage, embedded in bricks and plastone, pipes siphoned information from or fed illicit and troublemaking opinions to the screens.I walked in the glimmer of hacked denunciations of Bremen, threats of violence to Wyatt and his small staff.A demagogic trid ghost muttered about freedoms, democracies and taxation.Even Wyatt would hardly have been very concerned about this half hearted radicals display, though Im sure he would have excoriated the constabulary for failing to take such graffiti offline.I was in a shopping street specialising in leather and altleather.I smelt tanning and guts by a shop where ripe purses were being harvested from a biorigged tree.The butchers cut them with skill, making a slit to which they would attach a clasp, scooping out innards and readying the skins for sealing.In the rear was a crop of immature umbrellas, silly luxuries weakly flexing their vespertilian canopies.The altleather goods were simple, mouthless, arseless things which couldnt have lived: the viscera that slopped in the shops gutter were vague and meaningless.At least a dozen similes were gathered in the wine caf called The Cravat, to where Id been directed.Its trid sign stalked endlessly in front of it, a figure failing to do up its neckpiece.I stepped through it (an unexpected flourish of tridware making it look up as if startled before reverting to its loop) and inside.Avice!Hasser was delighted.Introductions...Darius, who wore tools instead of jewellery; Shanita, who was kept blind and awake for three nights; Valdik, who swims every week with fishes.He went round the room like that.This is Avice, he said, who ate what was given to her.OF COURSE we were hardly all the similes the Ariekei spoke.Some were animal or inanimate: there was a house in Embassytown out of which, many years before, the Hosts had taken all the furniture, then put it back, to allow some figure of speech.The split stone, made so they could speak the thought, its like the stone that was split and put together again.Most, though, were Terre men and women: there was something in us that facilitated.Many similes, of course, were uninterested in their status.There were I gathered one or two among Staff.Even Ambassadors.They never came.They dont like being Language, Hasser said.It makes them feel vulnerablethey like speaking Language, not being it.Plus theyd have to hobnob with commoners.He spoke with the complicated amalgam of respect and resentment Id heard before and would again, many times.We talked about Language, and what it meant to be what we were.They talked: mostly I listened.I tried to keep the irritations their blather raised to myself.Id come, after all.A disproportionate number of the similes seemed, to varying degrees, to be independencers.They said this and that about Bremens benighted hand and ruthless agents.Having met Wyatt, this in particular made me snort.I dont see any of you turning down anything from the miab, I said.No, someone answered, but we should trade, instead of handing over bloody taxes and aid.Hasser gave me sotto voce information about my interlocutors as they spoke, like a vizier in the ears of an Ambassador.Shes just bitter because she doesnt get called very often.Her similes too recondite.Hes less a simile than an example, honestly.And he knows it.When I went home I was peppery about them all.I told Scile how ridiculous a scene it was.But I went back.Ive thought a lot about why I did.Which does not mean I could explain it.On my second trip, Valdik, who every week swam with fishes, told the story of his similification.He was an ongoing: his status depended not on something that he had done or had done to him, but on something he had to continue to do.Its like the man who swims with fishes every week, the Hosts might want to say, to make whatever obscure point it was, and to allow them that, it had to be true that he did.Hence his duty.Theres a marble bath in Staff quarters, Valdik said.Glanced up at me, back down.They shipped it years ago, all the way through the immer.They put little altfish in with me, which can take the chlorine.I swim every Overday.I suspected he spent the eleven days between each such trip preparing for the next.I did not know what efforts were made to ensure such activities were ongoing, the tenses of the Hosts similes accurate.I wondered if that was part of the Ambassadors slight unease with us: the possibility of a simile strike.When it was my turn, I told my new companions about the restaurant, and the things I ate, and it was unpleasant enough, what had happened, that I accrued some credibility.Some of them stared at me; one or two, like Valdik, were avoiding looking at me at all.Welcome home, said someone quietly.I hated that and stopped policing my expressions, made sure they could see that I hated it.And I hated that when he took his own turn, described terrible things done to enLanguage him, Hasser, who had been opened and closed again, modulated his voice and timed his delivery and turned it, true as it was, into a story.Latterday, 6  A CITIZEN WHO didnt spend much time at the Embassy might not have seen that anything was wrong: the checkpoints were manned; Staff and Staff apprentices were around; signs still appeared in trid and flatscreen glowing information.Disquiet, though, was palpable, since the party, to those who knew.No ship had ever left with such an unfocused valedictory as our last arrival.Of course sufficient pomp had been attempted.Soon enough after the Arrival Ball that some were still cheerfully dishevelled, the immerser crew had been seen off on their boat by a gathering of Ambassadors, Staff and people like me, Embassytowners holding their breath until, left alone, they could deal with whatever it was that was happening.In fact, they, we, didnt deal with it at all.There were those among the Staff, I picked up later, who had tried to insist that the ship not leave.I, Avice Benner Cho, immerser, first a lover then an ex of CalVin (some Embassytowners probably thought it a lie, that, but it was part of me and was also true), advisor to Staff on out business, had my entry to the state offices blocked by a nervous constable.In the end it didnt take much.A little floakingI think youve made a mistake, Officer, a moments But thats precisely why Im here, they wanted my helpand I was passed.I had no illusions about my real stock to insiders.But to have to go through that simply to get into the hallways?Inside there wasnt even a pretence at calm.I jostled past Staff whispering arguments with each other.I looked for EdGar, or someone I knew would talk to me.What are you doing here?said Ag or Nes of AgNes, her doppel shaking her head.They were rather grandes dames, and paid no attention to my muttered response.Id get going, girl.Youll only be......in the way.Others were less dismissiveRanDolph gave me smiles and mimed exhaustion, a high ranking vizier Id once got drunk with even winked at mebut AgNes were right, I was an obstruction.In a top floor teahouse, overlooking our roofscape and its segue into the outlines of the city, I found Simmon, from Security, and cornered him.After obligatory protestations that he knew nothing, that he couldnt tell me anything, he said, Ive not seen Ambassador EzRa since the party.I dont know where theyve gone.According to the original schedule they were due to be part of a meet and greet half an hour ago, but they never turned up.Mind you they werent the only ones.Plans have mostly gone to shit.Where in hell are the Hosts?Good question.Discussions of major issues between Embassytown and the Hostsmining rights, our farms, technology barter, Language celebrationswere only occasional, but every day, there were minutiae that had to be agreed.There were always a few Ariekei in the corridors, for one or other negotiation.The Embassy was toughly floored, to withstand their point feet.Theyre not here, Simmon said.He massaged the odd flesh of his biorigged arm.None of them.Weve had generations to compromise with them on what constitutes an appointment, so we know fine bloody well that several were supposed to be here this morning, and would normally have been, and theyre not.Theyre not returning any of our buzzes.Theyre not communicating with us at all.We must have offended them pretty badly, I said at last.Looks like it, he said.How, do you think?Pharotekton bloody knows how.Or EzRa knows.Neither of us said anything for a moment.Do you know someone called Oratee?he said.Or Oratees?No.Whos that?It hadnt sounded like an Ambassador: a strange name with no ghost stress halfway through it.I dont know.I heard CalVin and HenRy talking about them, sounded as if theyd know whats going on.I thought you might know them.You know everyone.It was nice of him, but I didnt have it in me to play that up.AgNes and a couple of other Ambassadors blame Wyatt for this, you know.For what?For whatever.For whatever it is that happened.I heard them.This is all down to him and Bremen, they were saying.We always knew they were undermining us, well here we are...Simmon made his prosthetic hand move open closed to show a talkative mouth.So they know whats going on, then?He shrugged.Dont think so, but.You dont have to understand something to blame someone for it, he said.Theyre right, anyway.This has to be a. ..manoeuvre, no question.EzRa...some Bremen weapon.What if AgNes were right?If so, and I played the particular last contact card I had, it would be, I supposed, a betrayal of Embassytown.CalVin and Scile came to my mind and I overcame any hesitation.I buzzed Wyatt.As I connected I tried to think strategically, to work out where and how he was professional, where likely to bend, trying to work out what to say that might actually gain me some insight, persuade him to divulge something.The payoff to all this skulduggery was sheer bathos.Avice, Wyatt shouted when I got through.Thank God you called.I cant get anyone to pick up over there.For fucks sake, Avice, whats going on?HE WAS MORE CUT OFF even than me.He and his few assistants had offices in the heart of the Embassy, of course, but some Staff blamed him, others wanted to keep him out of whatever was happening, and all agreed they should caucus without him.They managed to do so never quite breaching the law that placed him, their Bremen overseer, above them.They had circulated, as they were obliged to, a list of all that days many meetings.Wyatt had sent officers to all those in main halls, and had gone himself to one titled Emergency Organisation to discover that all these were sideshows, anxious extemporised discussions between mid level Staff over issues such as stationery acquisition.The real debates, post mortems on the party, hypotheses about the Hosts silence, had happened already, during the Any Other Business sessions of meetings of the Public Works Committee.Its a fucking outrage, Avice!he said.Thats exactly the kind of thing that has to stop, that is exactly the sort of thing weve been sent to put an end to.They have conspired to keep me out.Im their bloody superior!Not to mention what theyre doing to EzRathese men are their colleagues, and theyre ostracising them.Its a disgrace.Wyatt, wait.Where are EzRa?Ras in his room, or he was when I buzzed him.Ez I dont know.Your colleagues  Theyre not my  Your colleagues are freezing them out.Im sure theyd arrest them if they could.Ezs not answering, and I cant find him...The notion of an Ambassador having separate rooms, doing different things, still reeled me.Do they know whats going on?Dont you think theyd tell me?he said.Its not everyone here who tries to cut me out, you realise, just your bloody Ambassadors.Whatever it is theyre hatching...Wyatt calm down.Whatevers going on, you can see Staff arent in any more control than you.He must have known the Embassy had had no contact of any kind from the city, since that night.The Hosts arent saying anything.I think...I said carefully, I think EzRa...or we...must have accidentally done something that offended them...badly...Oh, bullshit, Wyatt said.I blinked.This isnt one of those stories, Avice.One moment of cack handedness, Captain Cook offends the bloody locals, one slip of the tongue or misuse of sacred cutlery, and bang, hes on the grill.Do you ever think how self aggrandising that stuff is?Oh, all those stories pretend to be mea culpas about cultural insensitivity, oops we said the wrong thing, but theyre really all about how ridiculous natives overreact.He laughed and shook his head.Avice, we must have made thousands of fuckups like that over the years.Think about it.Just like our visitors did when they first met our lot, on Terre.And for the most part we didnt lose our shit, did we?The Ariekeiand the Kedis, and Shurasi, and Cymar and what have you, pretty much all the exots Ive ever dealt withare perfectly capable of understanding when an insults intended, and when its a misunderstanding.Behind every Ku and Lono story, theres...pilfering and cannon fire.Believe me, he added wryly.Its my job.He made thieving fingers motions.It was because he would say things like that that I liked him.Theres always argy bargy, Avice, he said, and leaned toward the screen.Job like mine.Ive not shown bad form, have I?He said this suddenly almost plaintively.But this...Avice, there are limits.JoaQuin and MayBel and that lotthey need to remember what I represent.Bremen was a power, so always at war, with other countries on Dagostin, and on other worlds.What if enemies sent battleships in our direction?Kicked Bremen in the colonies?What, were we going to raise our rifles, our biorigged cannons, aim at the skies?Any comeback for a little genocide like that, which they could offhandedly commit, would have to come from Bremen itself, if it calculated it worth it.Mles in the vacuum of sometimes space, or terrible strange firefights in the immer.That threat, and Ariekas isolation in rough immerand, though it went unspoken, our lack of importancewere the deterrents against attacks at that level.
