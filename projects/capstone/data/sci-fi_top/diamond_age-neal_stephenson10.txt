"You are most perceptive, Princess Nell. ""Those messages came to Wizard just another Turing machine. ""Open the altar," said King Coyote, pointing to a large brass plate with a keyhole in the middle.Princess Nell used her key to open the lock, and King Coyote flipped back the lid of the altar.Inside were two small machines, one for reading tapes and one for writing them."Follow me," said King Coyote, and opened a trap door set into the floor behind the altar.Princess Nell followed him down a spiral staircase into a small room.The connecting rods from the altar came down into this room and terminated at a small console."Wizard is not even connected to the altar!It does nothing," Princess Nell said."Oh, Wizard does a great deal.It helps me keep track of things, does calculations, and so on.But all of that business up there on the stage is just for show just to impress the commoners.When a message comes here from the Cipherers' Market, I read it myself, and answer it myself."So as you can see, Princess Nell, the Land Beyond is not really a Turing machine at all.It's actually a person a few people, to be precise.Now it's all yours. "King Coyote led Princess Nell back into the heart of his keep and gave her a tour of the place.The best part was the library.He showed her the books containing the rules for programming Wizard 0.2, and other books explaining how to make atoms build themselves into machines, buildings, and whole worlds."You see, Princess Nell, you have conquered this world today, and now that you have conquered it, you'll find it a rather boring place.Now it's your responsibility to make new worlds for other people to explore and conquer. "King Coyote waved his hand out the window into the vast, empty white space where once had stood the Land Beyond."There's plenty of empty space out there. ""What will you do, King Coyote?""Call me John, Your Royal Highness.As of today, I no longer have a kingdom. ""John, what will you do?""I have a quest of my own. ""What is your quest?""To find the Alchemist, whoever he may be. ""And is there ... "Nell stopped reading the Primer for a moment.Her eyes had filled up with tears."Is there what?"said John's voice from the book."Is there another?Another who has been with me during my quest?""Yes, there is," John said quietly, after a short pause."At least I have always sensed that she is here. ""Is she here now?""Only if you build a place for her," John said."Read the books, and they will show you how. "With that, John, the former King Coyote and Emperor of the Land Beyond, vanished in a flash of light, leaving Princess Nell alone in her great dusty library.Princess Nell put her head down on an old leather bound book and smelled its rich fragrance.One tear of joy ran from each eye.But she mastered the impulse to cry and reached for the book instead.They were magic books, and they drew Princess Nell into them so deeply that, for many hours, perhaps even days, she was not aware of her surroundings; which scarcely mattered as nothing remained of the Land Beyond.But at some length, she realized that something was tickling her foot.She reached down absently and scratched it.Moments later the tickling sensation returned.This time she looked down and was astonished to see that the floor of the library was covered with a thick gray brown carpet, flecked here and there with splotches of white and black.It was a living, moving carpet.It was, in fact, the Mouse Army.All of the other buildings, places, and creatures Princess Nell had seen in the Land Beyond had been figments produced by Wizard 0.2; but apparently the mice were an exception and existed independently of King Coyote's machinations.When the Land Beyond had disappeared, all of the obstructions and impedimenta that had kept the Mouse Army away from Princess Nell had disappeared with it, and in short order they had been able to fix her whereabouts and to converge upon their long sought Queen."What would you have me do?"Princess Nell said.She had never been a Queen before and did not know the protocol.A chorus of excited squeaking came from the mice as commands were relayed and issued.The carpet went into violent but highly organized motion as the mice drew themselves up into platoons, companies, battalions, and regiments, each of them commanded by an officer.One mouse clambered up the leg of Princess Nell's table, bowed low to her, and then began to squeak commands from on high.The mice executed a close order drill, withdrew to the edges of the room, and arrayed themselves in an empty box shape, leaving a large open rectangle in the middle of the floor.The mouse up on the table, whom Nell had dubbed the Generalissima, issued a lengthy series of orders, running to each of the four edges of the table to address different contingents of the Mouse Army.When the Generalissima was finished, very high piping music could be heard as the mouse pipers played their bagpipes and the drummers beat their drums.Small groups of mice began to encroach on the empty space, each group moving toward a different spot.Once each group had reached its assigned position, the individual mice arranged themselves in such a way that the group as a whole described a letter.In this way, the following message was written across the floor of the library:  WE ARE ENCHANTED  REQUEST ASSISTANCE  REFER TO BOOKS  "I shall bend all my efforts toward your disenchantment," Princess Nell said, and a tremendous, earsplitting scream of gratitude rose from the tiny throats of the Mouse Army.Finding the required book did not take long.The Mouse Army split itself up into small detachments, each of which wrestled a different book from the shelf, opened it up on the floor, and scampered through it one page at a time, looking for relevant spells.Within the hour, Princess Nell noted that a broad open corridor had developed in the Mouse Army, and that a book was making its way toward her, seeming to float an inch above the floor.She lifted the book carefully from the backs of the mice who were bearing it and flipped through it until she found a spell for the disenchantment of mice."Very well then," she said, and began to read the spell; but suddenly, excited squeaking filled the air and all the mice were running away in a panic.The Generalissima climbed up onto the page, jumping up and down in a state of extreme agitation and waving her forelegs back and forth over her head."I understand," Princess Nell said.She picked up the book and walked out of the library, taking care not to step on any of her subjects, and followed them out to the vast empty space beyond.Once again the Mouse Army put on a dazzling display of close order drill, drawing itself up across the empty, colorless plain by platoons, companies, battalions, regiments, and brigades; but this time the parade took up a much larger space, because this time the mice took care to space themselves as far apart as the length of a human arm.Some of the platoons had to march what was, for them, a distance of many leagues in order to reach the edges of the formation.Princess Nell took advantage of the time to wander about and inspect the ranks, and to rehearse the spell.Finally the Generalissima approached, bowed deeply, and gave her the thumbs up, though Princess Nell had to pick the tiny leader up and squint to see this gesture.She went to the place that had been left for her at the head of the formation, opened up the book, and spoke the magic spell.There was a violent thunderclap, and a rush of wind that knocked Princess Nell flat on her back.She looked up, dazed, to see that she was surrounded by a vast army of some hundreds of thousands of girls, only a few years younger than she was.A wild cheer rose up, and all of the girls fell to their knees as one and, in a scene of riotous jubilation, proclaimed their fealty to Queen Nell.Hackworth in China;  depredations of the Fists;  a meeting with Dr.X;  an unusual procession.They said that the Chinese had great respect for madmen, and that during the days of the Boxer Rebellion, certain Western missionaries, probably unstable characters to begin with, who had been trapped behind walls of rubble for weeks, scurrying through the sniper fire of the encircling Boxers and Imperial troops and listening to the cries of their flock being burned and tortured in the streets of Beijing, had become deranged and had walked unharmed into the ranks of their besiegers and been given food and treated with deference.Now John Percival Hackworth, having checked into a suite on the top floor of the Shangri La in Pudong (or Shong a lee lah as the taxi drivers sang it), put on a fresh shirt; his best waistcoat, girded with the gold chain, adangle with his chop, snuffboxes, fob, and watchphone; a long coat with a swallowtail for riding; boots, the black leather and brass spurs hand shined in the lobby of the Shong a lee lah by a coolie who was so servile that he was insolent, and Hackworth suspected him of being a Fist; new kid gloves; and his bowler, de mossed and otherwise spruced up a bit, but obviously a veteran of many travels in rough territory.As he crossed the western bank of the Huang Pu, the usual crowd of starving peasants and professional amputees washed around him like a wave running up a flat beach because, though riding here was dangerous, it was not crazy, and they did not know him for a madman.He kept his gray eyes fixed upon the picket of burning Feed lines that demarcated the shrinking border of the Coastal Republic, and let their hands tug at his coattails, but he took no notice of them.At different times, three very rural young men, identifiable as much by their deep tans as their ignorance of modern security technology, made the mistake of reaching for his watch chain and received warning shocks for their trouble.One of them refused to let go until the smell of burned flesh rose from his palm, and then he peeled his hand away slowly and calmly, staring up at Hackworth to show that he didn't mind a little pain, and said something clearly and loudly that caused a titter to run through the crowd.The ride down Nanjing Road took him through the heart of Shanghai's shopping district, now an endless gauntlet of tanned beggars squatting on their heels gripping the brightly colored plastic bags that served as their suitcases, carefully passing the butts of cigarettes back and forth.In the shop windows above their heads, animated mannikins strutted and posed in the latest Coastal Republic styles.Hackworth noticed that these were much more conservative than they had been ten years ago, during his last trip down Nanjing Road.The female mannikins weren't wearing slit skirts anymore.Many weren't wearing skirts at all, but silk pants instead, or long robes that were even less revealing.One display was centered upon a patriarchal figure who reclined on a dais, wearing a round cap with a blue button on the top: a Mandarin.A young scholar was bowing to him.Around the dais, four groups of mannikins were demonstrating the other four filial relationships.So it was chic to be Confucian now, or at least it was politic.This was one of the few shop windows that didn't have red Fist posters pasted all over it.Hackworth rode past marble villas built by Iraqi Jews in previous centuries, past the hotel where Nixon had once stayed, past the high rise enclaves that Western businessmen had used as the beachheads of the post Communist development that had led to the squalid affluence of the Coastal Republic.He rode past nightclubs the size of stadiums; jaialai pits where stunned refugees gaped at the jostling of the bettors; side streets filled with boutiques, one street for fine goods made from alligators, another for furs, another for leathers; a nanotech district consisting of tiny businesses that did bespoke engineering; fruit and vegetable stands; a cul de sac where peddlers sold antiques from little carts, one specializing in cinnabar boxes, another in Maoist kitsch.Each time the density began to wane and he thought he must be reaching the edge of the city, he would come to another edge city of miniature three story strip malls and it would begin again.But as the day went on, he truly did approach the limit of the city and kept riding anyway toward the west, and it became evident then that he was a madman and the people in the streets looked at him with awe and got out of his way.Bicycles and pedestrians became less common, replaced by heavier and faster military traffic.Hackworth did not like riding on the shoulder of highways, and so he directed Kidnapper to find a less direct route to Suzhou, one that used smaller roads.This was flat Yangtze Delta territory only inches above the waterline, where canals, for transport, irrigation, and drainage, were more numerous than roads.The canals ramified through the black, stinky ground like blood vessels branching into the tissues of the brain.The plain was interrupted frequently by small tumuli containing the coffins of someone's ancestors, just high enough to stay above the most routine floods.Farther to the west, steep hills rose from the paddies, black with vegetation.The Coastal Republic checkpoints at the intersections of the roads were gray and fuzzy, like house size clots of bread mold, so dense was the fractal defense grid, and staring through the cloud of macro and microscopic aerostats, Hackworth could barely make out the hoplites in the center, heat waves rising from the radiators on their backs and stirring the airborne soup.They let him pass through without incident.Hackworth expected to see more checkpoints as he continued toward Fist territory, but the first one was the last; the Coastal Republic did not have the strength for defense in depth and could muster only a one dimensional picket line.A mile past the checkpoint, at another small intersection, Hackworth found a pair of very makeshift crucifixes fashioned from freshly cut mulberry trees, green leaves still fluttering from their twigs.Two young white men had been bound to the crucifixes with gray plastic ties, burned in many places and incrementally disemboweled.From the looks of their haircuts and the somber black neckties that had been ironically left around their necks, Hackworth guessed they were Mormons.A long skein of intestine trailed from one of their bellies down into the dirt, where a gaunt pig was tugging on it stubbornly.He did not see much more death, but he smelled it everywhere in the hot wet air.He thought that he might be seeing a network of nanotech defense barriers until he realized that it was a natural phenomenon: Each waterway supported a linear black nimbus of fat, drowsy flies.From this he knew that if he tugged a bit on this or that rein and guided Kidnapper to the bank of the canal, he would find it filled with ballooning corpses.Ten minutes after passing the Coastal Republic checkpoint, he rode through the center of a Fist encampment.As he looked neither right nor left, he could not really estimate its size; they had taken over a village of low brick and stucco buildings.A long straight smudge running across the earth marked the location of a burned Feed line, and as he crossed it, Hackworth fantasized that it was a meridian engraved on the living globe by an astral cartographer.Most of the Fists were shirtless, wearing indigo trousers, scarlet girdles knotted at the waist, sometimes scarlet ribbons tied round necks, foreheads, or upper arms.The ones who weren't sleeping or smoking were practicing martial arts.Hackworth rode slowly through their midst, and they pretended not to notice him, except for one man who came running out of a house with a knife, shouting  "Sha!Sha!"and had to be tackled by three comrades.As he rode the forty miles to Suzhou, nothing changed about the landscape except that creeks became rivers and ponds became lakes.The Fist encampments became somewhat larger and closer together.When the thick air infrequently roused itself to a breeze, he could smell the clammy metallic reek of stagnant water and knew he was close to the great lake of Tai Wu, or Taifu as the Shanghainese pronounced it.A grayscale dome rose from the paddies some miles away, casting a film of shadow before a cluster of tall buildings, and Hackworth knew it must be Suzhou, now a stronghold of the Celestial Kingdom, veiled in its airborne shield like a courtesan behind a translucent sheen of Suzhou silk.Nearing the shore of the great lake he found his way onto an important road that ran south toward Hangzhou.He set Kidnapper ambling northward.Suzhou had thrown out tendrils of development along its major roads, and so as he drew closer he saw strip malls and franchises, now destroyed, deserted, or colonized by refugees.Most of these places catered to truck drivers: lots of motels, casinos, teahouses, and fast food places.But no trucks ran on the highway now, and Hackworth rode down the center of a lane, sweating uncontrollably in his dark clothes and drinking frequently from a refrigerated bottle in Kidnapper's glove compartment.A McDonald's sign lay toppled across the highway like a giant turnpike; something had burned through the single pillar that thrust it into the air.A couple of young men were standing in front of it smoking cigarettes and, as Hackworth realized, waiting for him.As Hackworth drew closer, they ground out their cigarettes, stepped forward, and bowed.Hackworth tipped his bowler.One of them took Kidnapper's reins, which was a purely ceremonial gesture in the case of a robot horse, and the other invited Hackworth to dismount.Both of the men were wearing heavy but flexible coveralls with cables and tubes running through the fabric: the inner layer of armor suits.They could turn themselves into battle ready hoplites by slapping on the harder and heavier outer bits, which were presumably stashed somewhere handy.Their scarlet headbands identified them as Fists.Hackworth was one of the few members of the Outer Tribes ever to find himself in the presence of a Fist who was not running toward him with a weapon screaming "Kill!Kill!"and found it interesting to see them in a more indulgent mood.They were dignified, formal, and controlled, like military men, with none of the leering and snickering that were fashionable among Coastal Republic boys of the same age.Hackworth walked across the parking lot toward the McDonald's, followed at a respectful distance by one of the soldiers.Another soldier opened the door for him, and Hackworth sighed with delight as cold dry air flowed over his face and began to chase the muggy stuff through the weave of his clothing.The place had been lightly sacked.He could smell a cold, almost clinical greasy smell wafting from behind the counter, where containers of fat had spilled onto the floor and congealed like snow.Much of this had been scooped up by looters; Hackworth could see the parallel tracks of women's fingers.The place was decorated in a Silk Roadmotif, transpicuous mediatronic panels portraying wondrous sights between here and the route's ancient terminus in Cadiz.Dr.X was seated in the corner booth, his face radiant in the cool, UV filtered sunlight.He was wearing a Mandarin cap with dragons embroidered in gold thread and a magnificent brocade robe.The robe was loose at the neck and had short sleeves so that Hackworth could see the inner garment of a hoplite suit underneath.Dr.X was at war, and had emerged from the safe perimeter of Suzhou, and needed to be prepared for an attack.He was sipping green tea from a jumbo McDonald's cup, made in the local style, great clouds of big green leaves swirling around in a tumbler of hot water.Hackworth doffed his hat and bowed in the Victorian style, which was proper under the circumstances.Dr.X returned the bow, and as his head tilted forward, Hackworth could see the button on the top of his cap.It was red, the color of the highest ranks, but it was made of coral, marking him as second rank.A ruby button would have put him at the very highest level.In Western terms this made Dr.X roughly equivalent to a lesser cabinet minister or three star general.Hackworth supposed that this was the highest rank of Mandarin permitted to converse with barbarians.Hackworth sat down across the table from Dr.X.  A young woman padded out of the kitchen on silk slippers and gave Hackworth his own tumbler full of green tea.Watching her mince away, Hackworth was only mildly shocked to see that her feet were no more than four inches long.There must be better ways to do it now, maybe by regulating the growth of the tarsal bones during adolescence.It probably didn't even hurt.Realizing this, Hackworth also realized, for the first time, that he had done the right thing ten years ago.Dr.X was watching him and might as well have been reading his mind.This seemed to put him in a pensive mood.He said nothing for a while, just gazed out the window and occasionally sipped his tea.This was fine with Hackworth, who had had a long ride."Have you learned anything from your ten year sentence?"Dr.X finally said."It would seem so.But I have trouble pulling it up," Hackworth said.This was a bit too idiomatic for Dr.X.  By way of explanation, Hackworth flipped out a ten year old card bearing Dr.X's dynamic chop.As the old fisherman hauled the dragon out of the water, Dr.X suddenly got it, and grinned appreciatively.This was showing a lot of emotion assuming it was genuine but age and war had made him reckless."Have you found the Alchemist?"Dr.X said."Yes," Hackworth said."I am the Alchemist. ""When did you know this?""Only very recently," Hackworth said."Then I understood it all in an instant pulled it up," he said, pantomiming the act of reeling in a fish."The Celestial Kingdom was far behind Nippon and Atlantis in nanotech.The Fists could always have burned the barbarians' Feed lines, but this would only have plunged the peasants into poverty and made the people long for foreign goods.The decision was made to leapfrog the barbarian tribes by developing Seed technology.At first you pursued the project in cooperation with second tier phyles like Israel, Armenia, and Greater Serbia, but they proved unreliable.Again and again your carefully cultivated networks were scattered by Protocol Enforcement."But through these failures you made contact for the first time with CryptNet, whom you doubtless view as just another triad a contemptible band of conspirators.However, CryptNet was tied in with something much deeper and more interesting the society of the Drummers.With their flaky and shallow Western perspective, CryptNet didn't grasp the full power of the Drummers' collective mind.But you got it right away."All you required to initiate the Seed project was the rational, analytical mind of a nanotechnological engineer.I fit the bill perfectly.You dropped me into the society of the Drummers like a seed into fertile soil, and my knowledge spread through them and permeated their collective mind as their thoughts spread into my own unconscious.They became like an extension of my own brain.For years I laboured on the problem, twenty four hours a day."Then, before I was able to finish the job, I was pulled out by my superiors at Protocol Enforcement.I was close to being finished.But not finished yet. ""Your superiors had uncovered our plan?""Either they are completely ignorant, or else they know everything and are pretending ignorance," Hackworth said."But surely you have told them everything now," Dr.X said almost inaudibly."If I were to answer that question, you would have no reason not to kill me," Hackworth said.Dr.X nodded, not so much to concede the point as to express sympathy with Hackworth's admirably cynical train of thought as though Hackworth, after a series of seemingly inconclusive moves, had suddenly flipped over a large territory of stones on a go board."There are those who would advocate that course, because of what has happened with the girls," Dr.X said.Hackworth was so startled to hear this that he became somewhat lightheaded for a moment and too self conscious to speak  "Have the Primers proved useful?"he finally said, trying not to sound giddy.Dr.X grinned broadly for a moment.Then the emotion dropped beneath the surface again, like a breaching whale."They must have been useful to someone," he said."My opinion is that we made a mistake in saving the girls. ""How can this act of humanity possibly have been a mistake?"Dr.X considered it."It would be more correct to say that, although it was virtuous to save them, it was mistaken to believe that they could be raised properly.We lacked the resources to raise them individually, and so we raised them with books.But the only proper way to raise a child is within a family.The Master could have told us as much, had we listened to his words. ""Some of those girls will one day choose to follow in the ways of the Master," Hackworth said, "and then the wisdom of your decisions will be demonstrated. "This seemed to be a genuinely new thought to Dr.X.  His gaze returned to the window.Hackworth sensed that the matter of the girls and the Primers had been concluded."I will be open and frank," said Dr.X after some ruminative tea slurping, "and you will not believe that I am being so, because it is in the heads of those from the Outer Tribes to think that we never speak directly.But perhaps in time you will see the truth of my words."The Seed is almost finished.When you left, the building of it slowed down very much more than we expected.We thought that the Drummers, after ten years, had absorbed your knowledge and could continue the work without you.But there is something in your mind that you have gained through your years of scholarly studies that the Drummers, if they ever had it, have given up and cannot get back unless they come out of the darkness and live their lives in the light again."The war against the Coastal Republic reaches a critical moment.We ask you to help us now. ""I must say that it is nearly inconceivable for me to help you at this point," Hackworth said, "unless it would be in the interest of my tribe, which does not strike me as a likely prospect. ""We need you to help us finish building the Seed," Dr.X said doggedly.Only decades of training in emotional repression kept Hackworth from laughing out loud."Sir.You are a worldly man and a scholar.Certainly you are aware of the position of Her Majesty's government, and indeed of the Common Economic Protocol itself, on the subject of Seed technologies. "Dr.X raised one hand a few inches from the tabletop, palm down, and pawed once at the air.Hackworth recognized it as the gesture that well to do Chinese used to dismiss beggars, or even to call bullshit on people during meetings."They are wrong," he said."They do not understand.They think of the Seed from a Western perspective.Your cultures and that of the Coastal Republic are poorly organized.There is no respect for order, no reverence for authority.Order must be enforced from above lest anarchy break out.You are afraid to give the Seed to your people because they can use it to make weapons, viruses, drugs of their own design, and destroy order.You enforce order through control of the Feed.But in the Celestial Kingdom, we are disciplined, we revere authority, we have order within our own minds, and hence the family is orderly, the village is orderly, the state is orderly.In our hands the Seed would be harmless. ""Why do you need it?"Hackworth said."We must have technology to live," Dr.X said, "but we must have it with our own. "Hackworth thought for a moment that Dr.X was referring to the beverage.But the Doctor began to trace characters on the tabletop, his hand moving deftly and gracefully, the brocade sleeve rasping across the plastic surface."Yong is the outer manifestation of something.Ti is the underlying essence.Technology is a yong associated with a particular ti that is" the Doctor stumbled here and, through a noticeable effort, refrained from using pejorative terms like barbarian or gwailo"that is Western, and completely alien to us.For centuries, since the time of the Opium Wars, we have struggled to absorb the yong of technology without importing the Western ti.But it has been impossible.Just as our ancestors could not open our ports to the West without accepting the poison of opium, we could not open our lives to Western technology without taking in the Western ideas, which have been as a plague on our society.The result has been centuries of chaos.We ask you to end that by giving us the Seed. ""I do not understand why the Seed will help you. ""The Seed is technology rooted in the Chinese ti.We have lived by the Seed for five thousand years," Dr.X said.He waved his hand toward the window."These were rice paddies before they were parking lots.Rice was the basis for our society.Peasants planted the seeds and had highest status in the Confucian hierarchy.As the Master said, 'Let the producers be many and the consumers few. 'When the Feed came in from Atlantis, From Nippon, we no longer had to plant, because the rice now came From the matter compiler.It was the destruction of our society.When our society was based upon planting, it could truly be said, as the Master did, 'Virtue is the root; wealth is the result. 'But under the Western ti, wealth comes not from virtue but from cleverness.So the filial relationships became deranged.Chaos," Dr.X said regretfully, then looked up From his tea and nodded out the window."Parking lots and chaos. "Hackworth remained silent for a full minute.Images had come into his mind again, not a fleeting hallucination this time, but a full fledged vision of a China freed from the yoke of the foreign Feed.It was something he'd seen before, perhaps something he'd even helped create.It showed something no gwailo would ever get to see: the Celestial Kingdom during the coming Age of the Seed.Peasants tended their fields and paddies, and even in times of drought and flood, the earth brought forth a rich harvest: food, of course, but many unfamiliar plants too, fruits that could be made into medicines, bamboo a thousand times stronger than the natural varieties, trees that produced synthetic rubber and pellets of clean safe fuel.In an orderly procession the suntanned farmers brought their proceeds to great markets in clean cities free of cholera and strife, where all of the young people were respectful and dutiful scholars and all of the elders were honored and cared for.This was a ractive simulation as big as all of China, and Hackworth could have lost himself in it, and perhaps did for he knew not how long.But finally he closed his eyes, blinked it away, sipped some tea to bring his rational mind back into control."Your arguments are not without merit," Hackworth said."Thank you for helping me to see the matter in a different light.I will ponder these questions on my return to Shanghai. "Dr.X escorted him to the parking lot of the McDonald's.The heat felt pleasant at first, like a relaxing bath, though Hackworth knew that soon he would feel as if he were drowning in it.Kidnapper ambled over and folded its legs, allowing Hackworth to mount it easily."You have helped us willingly for ten years," Dr.X said."It is your destiny to make the Seed. ""Nonsense," Hackworth said, "I did not know the nature of the project. "Dr.X smiled."You knew it perfectly well. "He freed one hand from the long sleeves of his robe and shook his finger at Hackworth, like an indulgent teacher pretending to scold a clever but mischievous pupil."You do these things not to serve your Queen but to serve your own nature, John Hackworth, and I understand your nature.For you cleverness is its own end, and once you have seen a clever way to do a thing, you must do it, as water finding a crack in a dike must pass through it and cover the land on the other side. ""Farewell, Dr.X," Hackworth said."You will understand that although I hold you in the highest personal esteem, I cannot earnestly wish you good fortune in your current endeavour. "He doffed his hat and bowed low to one side, forcing Kidnapper to adjust its stance a bit.Dr.X returned the bow, giving Hackworth another look at that coral button on his cap.Hackworth spurred Kidnapper on to Shanghai....He followed a more northerly route now, along one of the many radial highways that converged on the metropolis.After he had been riding for some time, he became consciously aware of a sound that had been brushing against the outer fringes of perceptibility for some time: a heavy, distant, and rapid drumbeat, perhaps twice as fast as the beat of his own heart.His first thought, of course, was of the Drummers, and he was tempted to explore one of the nearby canals to see whether their colony had spread its tendrils this far inland.But then he looked northward across the flat land for a couple of miles and saw a long procession making its way down another highway, a dark column of pedestrians marching on Shanghai.He saw that his path was converging with theirs, so he spurred Kidnapper forward at a hand gallop, hoping to reach the intersection of the roads before it was clogged by this column of refugees.Kidnapper outdistanced them easily, but to no avail; when he reached the intersection, he found it had been seized by the column's vanguard which had established a roadblock there and would not let him pass.The contingent now controlling the intersection consisted entirely of girls, some eleven or twelve years old.There were several dozen of them, and they had apparently taken the objective by force from a smaller group of Fists, who could now be seen lying in the shade of some mulberry trees, hogtied with plastic rope.Probably three quarters of the girls were on guard duty, mostly armed with sharpened bamboo stakes, though a few guns and blades were in evidence.The remaining quarter were on break, hunkered down in a circle near the intersection, sipping freshly boiled water and concentrating intently on books.Hackworth recognized the books; they were all identical, and they all had marbled jade covers, though all of them had been personalized with stickers, graffiti, and other decorations over the years.Hackworth realized that several more girls, organized in groups of four, had been following him down the road on bicycles; these outriders passed by him now and rejoined their group.He had no choice but to wait until the column had passed.The drumbeat grew and grew in volume until the pavement shook with each blow, and the shock absorption gear built into Kidnapper's legs went into play, flinching minutely at each beat.Another vanguard passed through: Hackworth easily calculated its size at two hundred and fifty six.A battalion was four platoons, each of which was four companies of four troops of four girls each.The vanguard consisted of one such battalion, moving at a very brisk double time, probably going ahead of the main group to fall upon the next major intersection.Then, finally, the main column passed through, organized in battalions, each foot hitting the ground in unison with all the others.Each battalion carried a few sedan chairs, which were passed from one four girl troop to another every few minutes to spread out the work.They were not luxurious palanquins but were improvised from bamboo and plastic rope and upholstered with materials stripped from old plastic cafeteria furniture.Riding in these chairs were girls who did not seem all that different from the others, except that they might have been a year or two older.They did not seem to be officers; they were not giving orders and wore no special insignia.Hackworth did not understand why they were riding in sedan chairs until he got a look at one of them, who had crossed one ankle up on her knee and taken her slipper off.Her foot was defective; it was several inches too short.But all of the other sedan chair girls were deeply absorbed in their Primers.Hackworth unclipped a small optical device from his watch chain, a nanotech telescope/microscope that frequently came in handy, and used it to look over one girl's shoulder.She was looking at a diagram of a small nanotechnological device, working her way through a tutorial that Hackworth had written several years ago.The column went past much faster than Hackworth had feared; they moved down the highway like a piston.Each battalion carried a banner, a very modest thing improvised from a painted bedsheet.Each banner bore the number of the battalion and a crest that Hackworth knew well, as it played an important role in the Primer.In all, he counted two hundred and fifty six battalions.Sixty five thousand girls ran past him, hell bent on Shanghai.From the Primer, Princess Nell's return to the Dark Castle;  the death of Harv;  The Books of the Book and of the Seed;  Princess Nell's quest to find her mother;  Destruction of the Causeway;  Nell falls into the hands of Fists;  she escapes into a greater peril;  deliverance.Princess Nell could have used all of the powers she had acquired during her great quest to dig Harv's grave or caused the work to be done for her by the Disenchanted Army, but it did not seem fitting, and so instead she found an old rusty shovel hung up in one of the Dark Castle's outbuildings.The ground was dry and stony and veined with the roots of thorn bushes, and more than once the shovel struck ancient bones.Princess Nell dug throughout the long day, softening the hard earth with her tears, but did not slacken until the ground was level with her own head.Then she went into the little room in the Dark Castle where Harv had died of a consumption, carefully wrapped his withered body in fine white silk, and bore it out to the grave.She had found lilies growing wild in the overgrown flower garden by the little fisherman's cottage, so she put a spray of these in the grave with him, along with a little children's story book that Harv had given her for a present many years ago.Harv could not read, and many nights as they had sat round the fire in the courtyard of the Dark Castle, Nell had read to him from this book, and she supposed that he might like to have it wherever he was going now.Filling in the grave went quickly; the loose dirt more than filled the hole.Nell left more lilies atop the long low mound of earth that marked Harv's resting place.Then she turned her back and walked into the Dark Castle.The stain colored granite walls had picked up some salmon highlights from the western sky, and she suspected that she could see a beautiful sunset from the room in the high tower where she had established her library.It was a long climb up a dank and mildewy staircase that wound up the inside of the Dark Castle's highest tower.In the circular room at the top, which was built with mullioned windows looking out in all directions, Nell had placed all of the books she had gathered during her quest: books given her as presents by Purple, books from the library of King Magpie, the first Faery King that she had vanquished, and more from the palace of the djinn, and Castle Turing, and many other hidden libraries and treasuries that she had discovered or pillaged on her way.And, of course, there was the entire library of King Coyote, which contained so many books that she had not even had time to look at them yet.There was so much work to be done.Copies of all of these books had to be made for all of the girls in the Disenchanted Army.The Land Beyond had vanished, and Princess Nell wanted to make it anew.She wanted to write down her own story in a great book that young girls could read.And she had one remaining quest that had been pressing on her mind of late, during her long voyage across the empty sea back to the island of the Dark Castle: she wanted to solve the mystery of her own origins.She wanted to find her mother.Even after the destruction of the Land Beyond, she had sensed the presence of another in the world, one who had always been there.King Coyote himself had confirmed it.Long ago, her stepfather, the kindly fisherman, had received her from mermaids; whence had the mermaids gotten her?She suspected that the answer could not be found without the wisdom contained in her library.She began by causing a catalog to be made, starting with the first books she had gotten on her early adventures with her Night Friends.At the same time she established a Scriptorium in the great hall of the castle, where thousands of girls sat at long tables making exact copies of all of the books.Most of King Coyote's books had to do with the secrets of atoms and how to put them together to make machines.Naturally, all of them were magic books; the pictures moved, and you could ask them questions and get answers.Some of them were primers and workbooks for novices, and Princess Nell spent a few days studying this art, putting atoms together to make simple machines and then watching them run.Next came a very large set of matched volumes containing reference materials: One contained designs for thousands of sleeve bearings, another for computers made of rods, still another for energy storage devices, and all of them were ractive so that she could use them to design such things to her own specifications.Then there were more books on the general principles of putting such things together into systems.Finally, King Coyote's library included some books inscribed in the King's own hand, containing designs for his greatest masterpieces.Of these, the two very finest were the Book of the Book and the Book of the Seed.They were magnificent folio size volumes, as thick as Princess Nell's hand was broad, bound in rich leather illuminated with hair thin gilt lines in an elaborate interlace pattern, and closed with heavy brass hasps and locks.The lock on the Book of the Book yielded to the same key that Princess Nell had taken from King Coyote.She had discovered this very early in her exploration of the library but was unable to comprehend the contents of this volume until she had studied the others and learnt the secrets of these machines.The Book of the Book contained a complete set of plans for a magical book that would tell stories to a young person, tailoring them for the child's needs and interests even teaching them how to read if need be.It was a fearsomely complicated work, and Princess Nell only skimmed it at first, recognizing that to understand the particulars might take years of study.The lock on the Book of the Seed would not yield to King Coyote's key or to any other key in Princess Nell's possession, and because this book had been built atom by atom, it was stronger than any mortal substance and could not possibly be broken open.Princess Nell did not know what this book was about; but the cover bore an inlaid illustration of a striped seed, like the apple sized seed that she had seen used in King Coyote's city to build a crystal pavilion, and this foreshadowed the book's purpose clearly enough.Nell opened her eyes and propped herself up on one elbow.The Primer fell shut and slid off her belly onto the mattress.She had fallen asleep reading it.The girls on their bunkbeds lay all around her, breathing quietly and smelling of soap.It made her want to lie back down and sleep too.But for some reason she was up on one elbow.Some instinct had told her she had to be up.She sat up and drew her knees up to her chest, freeing the hem of her nightgown from between the sheets, then spun around and dropped to the floor soundlessly.Her bare feet took her silently between the rows of bunks and into the little lounge in the corner of the floor where the girls sat together, had tea, brushed their hair, watched old passives.It was empty now, the lights were off, the corner windows exposing a vast panorama: to the northeast, the lights of New Chusan and of the Nipponese and Hindustani concessions standing a few kilometers offshore, and the outlying parts of Pudong.Downtown Pudong was all around, its floating, mediatronic skyscrapers like biblical pillars of fire.To the northwest lay the Huang Pu River, Shanghai, its suburbs, and the ravaged silk and tea districts beyond.No fires burned there now; the Feed lines had been burned all the way to the edge of the city, and the Fists had stopped at the outskirts and hunkered down as they sought a way to penetrate the tattered remains of the security grid.Nell's eye was drawn toward the water.Downtown Pudong offered the most spectacular urban nightscape ever devised, but she always found herself looking past it, staring instead at the Huang Pu, or the Yangzte to the north, or to the curvature of the Pacific beyond New Chusan.She'd been having a dream, she realized.She had awakened not because of any external disturbance but because of what had happened in that dream.She had to remember it; but, of course, she couldn't.Just a few snatches: a woman's face, a beautiful young woman, perhaps wearing a crown, but seen muddily, as through turbulent water.And something that glittered in her hands.No, dangling beneath her hands.A piece of jewelry on a golden chain.Could it have been a key?Nell could not bring the image back, but an instinct told her that it was.Another detail too: a gleaming swath of something that passed in front of her face once, twice, three times.Something yellow, with a repeating pattern woven into it: a crest consisting of a book, a seed, and crossed keys.Cloth of gold.Long ago the mermaids had brought her to her stepfather, and she had been wrapped in cloth of gold, and from this she had always known that she was a Princess.The woman in the dream, veiled in swirling water, must have been her mother.The dream was a memory from her lost infancy.And before her mother had given her up to the mermaids, she had given Princess Nell a golden key on a chain.Nell perched herself on the windowsill, leaned against the pane, opened the Primer, and flipped all the way back to the beginning.It started with the same old story, as ever, but told now in more mature prose.She read the story of how her stepfather had gotten her from the mermaids, and read it again, drawing out more details, asking it questions, calling up detailed illustrations.There, in one of the illustrations, she saw it: her stepfather's lock box, a humble plank chest bound in rusted iron straps, with a heavy oldfashioned padlock, stored underneath his bed.It was in this chest that he had stored the cloth of gold and, perhaps, the key as well.Paging forward through the book, she came across a long forgotten story of how, following her stepfather's disappearance, her wicked stepmother had taken the lock box to a high cliff above the sea and flung it into the waves, destroying any evidence that Princess Nell was of royal blood.She had not known that her stepdaughter was watching her from between the branches of a thicket, where she often concealed herself during her stepmother's rages.Nell flipped to the last page of the Young Lady's Illustrated Primer.As Princess Nell approached the edge of the cliff, picking her way along carefully through the darkness, taking care not to snag the train of her nightgown on thorny shrubs, she experienced a peculiar feeling that the entire ocean had become dimly luminescent.She had often noticed this phenomenon from the high windows of her library in the tower and reckoned that the waves must be reflecting back the light of the moon and stars.But this was a cloudy night, the sky was like a bowl of carved onyx, allowing no light to pass down from the heavens.The light she saw must emanate from beneath.Arriving cautiously at the rim of the cliff, she saw that her surmise was true.The ocean the one constant in all the world the place from where she had come as an infant, from which the Land Beyond had grown out of King Coyote's seed, and into which it had dissolved the ocean was alive.Since the departure of King Coyote, Princess Nell had supposed herself entirely alone in the world.But now she saw cities of light beneath the waves and knew that she was alone only by her own choice."'Princess Nell gathered the hem of her nightgown in both hands and raised it over her head, letting the chill wind stream over her body and carry the garment away,' " Nell said.  "'Then, drawing a deep breath and closing her eyes, she bent her legs and sprang forward into space. 'She was reading about the way the illuminated waves rushed up toward her when suddenly the room filled with light.She looked toward the door, thinking that someone had come in and turned the lights on, but she was alone in the room, and the light was flickering against the wall.She turned her head the other way.The center span of the Causeway had become a ball of white light hurling its marbled shroud of cold dark matter into the night.The sphere expanded until it seemed to occupy most of the interval between New Chusan and the Pudong shoreline, though by this time the color had deepened from white into reddish orange, and the explosion had punched a sizable crater into the water, which developed into a circular wave of steam and spray that ran effortlessly across the ocean's surface like the arc of light cast by a pocket torch.Fragments of the giant Feed line that had once constituted most of the Causeway's mass had been pitched into the sky by the explosion and now tumbled end over end through the night sky, the slowness of their motion bespeaking their size, casting yellow sulfurous light over the city as they burned furiously in the wind blast created by their own movement.The light limned a pair of tremendous pillars of water vapor rising from the ocean north and south of the Causeway; Nell realized that the Fists must have blown the Nipponese and Hindustani Feeds at the same moment.So the Fists of Righteous Harmony had nanotechnological explosives now; they'd come a long way since they'd tried to torch the bridge over the Huang Pu with a few cylinders of hydrogen.The shock wave rapped at the window, startling several of the girls from sleep.Nell heard them murmuring to one another in the bunk room.She wondered if she should go in and warn them that Pudong was cut off now, that the final assault of the Fists had commenced.But though she could not understand what they were saying, she could understand their tone of voice clearly enough: They were not surprised by this, nor unhappy.They were all Chinese and could become subjects of the Celestial Kingdom simply by donning the conservative garb of that tribe and showing due deference to any Mandarins who happened by.No doubt this was exactly what they would do as soon as the Fists came to Pudong.Some of them might suffer deprivation, imprisonment, or rape, but within a year they would all be integrated into the C. K. , as if the Coastal Republic had never existed.But if the news feeds from the interior meant anything, the Fists would kill Nell gradually, with many small cuts and burns, when they grew weary of raping her.In recent days she had often seen the Chinese girls talking in little groups and sneaking glances at her, and the suspicion had grown in her breast that some of them might know of the attack in advance and might make arrangements to turn Nell over to the Fists as a demonstration of their loyalty.She opened the door a crack and saw two of these girls padding toward the bunk room where Nell usually slept, carrying lengths of red polymer ribbon.As soon as they had stolen into Nell's bunk room, Nell ran down the corridor and got to the elevators.As she awaited the elevator, she was more scared than she had ever been; the sight of the cruel red ribbons in the small hands of the girls had for some reason struck more terror into her heart than the sight of knives in the hands of Fists.A shrill commotion arose from the bunk room.The bell for the elevator sounded.She heard the bunk room door fly open, and someone running down the hall.The elevator door opened.One of the girls came into the lobby, saw her, and shrieked something to the others in a dolphinlike squeal.Nell got into the elevator, punched the button for the lobby, and held down the DOOR CLOSE button.The girl thought for a moment, then stepped forward to hold the door.Several more girls were running down the hall.Nell kicked the girl in the face, and she spun away in a helix of blood.The elevator door began to close.Just as the two doors were meeting in the center, through the narrowing slit she saw one of the other girls diving toward the wall button.The doors closed.There was a brief pause, and then they slid open again.Nell was already in the correct stance to defend herself.If she had to beat each of the girls to death individually, she would do it.But none of them rushed the elevator.Instead, the leader stepped forward and aimed something at Nell.There was a little popping noise, a pinprick in Nell's midsection, and within a few seconds she felt her arms becoming impossibly heavy.Her bottom drooped.Her head bowed.Her knees buckled.She could not keep her eyes open; as they closed, she saw the girls coming toward her, smiling with pleasure, holding up the red ribbons.Nell could not move any part of her body, but she remained perfectly conscious as they tied her up with the ribbon.They did it slowly and methodically and perfectly; they did it every day of their lives.The tortures of the next few hours were of a purely experimental and preliminary nature.They did not last for long and accomplished no permanent damage.These girls had made a living out of binding and torturing people in a way that didn't leave scars, and that was all they really knew.When the leader came up with the idea of shoving a cigarette into Nell's cheek, it was something entirely novel and left the rest of the girls startled and silent for a few minutes.Nell sensed that most of the girls had no stomach for such things and merely wanted to turn her over to the Fists in exchange for citizenship in the Celestial Kingdom.The Fists themselves began to arrive some twelve hours later.Some of them wore conservative business suits, some wore the uniforms of the building's security force, others looked as if they'd arrived to take a girl out to a disco.They all had things to do when they arrived.It was obvious that this suite would act as local headquarters of some sort when the rebellion began in earnest.They began to bring up supplies on the freight elevator and seemed to spend a lot of time on the telephone.More arrived every hour, until Madame Ping's suite was playing host to between one and two dozen.Some of them were very tired and dirty and went to sleep in the bunks immediately.In a way, Nell wished that they would do whatever they were going to do and get it over with fast.But nothing happened for quite some time.When the first Fists arrived, the girls brought them in to see Nell, who had been shoved under a bed and was now lying there in a puddle of her own urine.The leader shone a light on her face briefly and then turned away, completely uninterested.It seemed that once he'd verified that the girls had done their bit for the revolution, Nell ceased to be relevant.She supposed it was inevitable that, in due time, these men would take those liberties with her that have ever been claimed as angary by irregular fighting men, who have willfully severed themselves from the softening feminine influence of civilized society, with those women who have had the misfortune to become their captives.To make this prospect less attractive, she took the desperate measure of allowing her person to become tainted with the noisome issue of her natural internal processes.But most of the Fists were too busy, and when some of the grungy foot soldier types arrived, Madame Ping's girls were eager to make themselves useful in this regard.Nell reflected that a bunch of soldiers who found themselves billeted in a bawdy house would naturally arrive with certain expectations, and that the inmates would be unwise to disappoint them.Nell had gone into the world to seek her fortune and this was what she had found.She understood more forcibly than ever the wisdom of Miss Matheson's remarks about the hostility of the world and the importance of belonging to a powerful tribe; all of Nell's intellect, her vast knowledge and skills, accumulated over a lifetime of intensive training, meant nothing at all when she was confronted with a handful of organized peasants.She could not really sleep in her current position but drifted in and out of consciousness, visited occasionally by hallucinatory waking dreams.More than once she dreamed that the Constable had come in his hoplite suit to rescue her; and the pain she felt when she returned to full consciousness and realized that her mind had been lying to her, was worse than any tortures others might inflict.Eventually they got tired of the stink under the bed and dragged her out of there on a smear of half dried body fluids.It had been at least thirty six hours since her capture.The leader of the girls, the one who had put out the cigarette on Nell's face, cut the red ribbon away and cut off Nell's filthy nightgown with it.Nell's limbs bounced on the floor.The leader had brought a whip that they sometimes used on clients and beat Nell with it until circulation returned.This spectacle drew quite a crowd of Fist soldiers, who crowded into the bunk room to watch.The girl drove Nell on hands and knees to a maintenance closet and made her get out a bucket and mop.Then she made Nell clean up the mess under the bed, frequently inspecting the results and beating her, apparently acting out a parody of a rich Westerner bossing around some poor running dog.It became clear after the third or fourth scrubbing of the floor that this was being done as much for the entertainment of the soldiers as for hygienic reasons.Then it was back to the maintenance closet, where Nell was bound again, this time with lightweight police shackles, and left there on the floor in the dark, naked and filthy.A few minutes later, her possessions some clothes that the girls didn't like and a book they couldn't read were thrown in there with her.When she was sure that the girl with the whip had gone, she spoke to her Primer and told it to make light.She could see a big matter compiler on the floor in the back of the closet; the girls used it to manufacture larger items when they were needed.This building was apparently hooked up to the Coastal Republic's Pudong Feed, because it hadn't lost Feed services when the Causeway had blown up; and indeed the Fists probably would not have bothered to establish their base here if the place had been cut off.Once every couple of hours or so, a Fist would come into this closet and order the M. C.  to create something, usually a simple bulk substance like rations.On two of these occasions, Nell was outraged in the manner she had long suspected was inevitable.She closed her eyes during the commission of these atrocities, knowing that whatever might be done to the mere vessel of her soul by the likes of these, her soul itself was as serene, as remote from their grasp, as is the full moon from the furious incantations of an aboriginal shaman.She tried to think about the machine that she was designing in her head, with the help of the Primer, about how the gears meshed and the bearings spun, how the rod logic was programmed and where the energy was stored.On her second night in the closet, after most of the Fists had gone to bed and use of the matter compiler had apparently ceased for the night, she instructed the Primer to load her design into the M. C.'s memory, then crept forward and pressed the START button with her tongue.Ten minutes later, the machine released its vacuum with a shriek.Nell tongued the door open.A knife and a sword rested on the floor of the M. C.  She turned herself around, moving in small, cautious increments and breathing deeply so that she would not whimper from the pain emanating from those parts of her that were most tender and vulnerable and yet had been most viciously depredated by her captors.She reached backward with her shackled hands and gripped the handle of the knife.Footsteps were approaching down the hallway.Someone must have heard the hiss of the M. C.  and thought it was dinner time.But Nell couldn't rush this; she had to be careful.The door opened.It was one of the ranking Fists, perhaps the rough equivalent of a sergeant.He shone a torch in her face, then chuckled and turned on the overhead light.Nell's body blocked his view of the M. C. , but it was obvious that she was reaching for something.He probably assumed it was only food.He stepped forward and kicked her casually in the ribs, then grabbed her upper arm and jerked her away from the M. C. , causing such pain in her wrists that tears spurted down her face.But she held on to the knife.The Fist was staring into the M. C.  He was startled and would be for several moments.Nell maneuvered the knife so that the blade was touching nothing but the link between the shackles, then hit the ON switch.It worked; the edge of the blade came to life like a nanotech chainsaw and zipped through the link in a moment, like clipping a fingernail.Nell brought it around her body in the same motion and buried it in the base of the Fist's spine.He fell to the ground without speaking he wasn't feeling any pain from that wound or from anything below his waist.Before he could assess matters any further, she plunged the knife into the base of his skull.He was wearing simple peasant stuff: indigo trousers and a tank top.She put them on.Then she tied her hair up behind her head using strings cut from a mop and devoted a precious minute or two to stretching her arms and legs.And then it was out into the hallway with her knife in her waistband and her sword in her hands.Going round a corner, she cut a man in half as he emerged from the bathroom; the sword kept going of its own momentum and carved a long gash in the wall.This assault released a prodigious amount of blood, which Nell put behind her as quickly as possible.Another man was on guard in the elevator lobby, and as he came to investigate the sounds, she ran him through several times quickly, taking a page from Napier's book this time.The elevators were now under some kind of central control and probably subject to surveillance; rather than press the button in the lobby, she cut a hole in the doors, sheathed her sword, and clambered out onto a ladder that ran down the shaft.She forced herself to descend slowly and carefully, pressing herself flat against the rungs whenever the car went by.By the time she had descended perhaps fifty or sixty floors, the building had come awake; all of the cars were in constant motion, and when they went past her, she could hear men talking excitedly inside them.Light flooded into the shaft several floors below.The doors had been forced open.A couple of Fists thrust their heads out carefully into the shaft and began looking up and down, shining torches here and there.Several floors below them, more Fists pried another door open; but they had to pull their heads in rapidly as the ascending car nearly decapitated them.She had imagined that Madame Ping's was playing host to an isolated cell of Fists, but it was now clear that most if not all of the building had been taken over.For that matter, all of Pudong might now be a part of the Celestial Kingdom.Nell was much more profoundly isolated than she had feared.The skin of her arms glowed yellow pink in the beam of a torch shone up from below.She did not make the mistake of looking down into the dazzling light and did not have to; the excited voice of the Fist below her told her that she had been discovered.A moment later, the light vanished as the ascending elevator interposed itself between Nell and the Fists who had seen her.She recalled Harv and his buds elevator surfing in their old building and reckoned that this would be a good time to take up the practice.As the car rose toward her, she jumped off the ladder, trying to give herself enough upward thrust to match its velocity.She landed hard on the roof, for it was moving far more rapidly than she could jump.The roof knocked her feet out from under her, and she fell backward, slamming her arms out as Dojo had taught her so that she absorbed the impact with her fists and forearms, not her back.More excited talking from inside the car.The access panel on the roof suddenly flew into the air, driven out of its frame by a well delivered kick from below.A head popped out of the open hatch; Nell skewered it on her knife.The man tumbled down into the car.There was no point in waiting now; the situation had gone into violent motion, which Nell was obliged to use.She rolled onto her belly and kicked both feet downward into the hatch, spun down into the car, landed badly on the corpse, and staggered to one knee.She had barked the point of her chin on the edge of the hatch as she fell tjirough and bitten her tongue, so she was slightly dazed.A gaunt man in a black leather skullcap was standing directly in front of her, reaching for a gun, and while she was shoving her knife up through the center of his thorax, she bumped into someone behind her.She jumped to her feet and spun around, terrified, readying the knife for another blow, and discovered a much more terrified man in a blue coverall, standing by the elevator's control panel, holding his arms up in front of his face and screaming.Nell stepped back and lowered the point of the knife.The man was wearing the uniform of a building services worker and had obviously been yanked away from whatever he had been doing and put in charge of the elevator's controls.The man whom Nell had just killed, the one in the black leather skullcap, was some sort of low level official in the rebellion and could not be expected to demean himself by punching the buttons himself."Keep going!Up!Up!"she said, pointing at the ceiling.The last thing she wanted was for him to stop the elevator at Madame Ping's.The man bowed several times in quick succession and did something with the controls, then turned and smiled ingratiatingly at Nell.As a Coastal Republic citizen working in services, he knew a few words of English, and Nell knew a few of Chinese."Down below Fists?"she said."Many Fist. ""Ground floor Fists?""Yes, many Fist ground floor. ""Street Fists?""Fist, army have fight in street. ""Around this building?""Fist around this building all over. "Nell looked at the elevator's control panel: four columns of tightly spaced buttons, color coded according to each floor's function: green for shopping, yellow for residential, red for offices, and blue for utility floors.Most of the blue floors were below ground level, but one of them was fifth from the top."Building office?"she said, pointing to it."Yes. ""Fists there?""No, Fist all down below.But Fist on roof!""Go there. "When the elevator reached the fifth floor from the top, Nell had the man freeze it there, then climbed on top and trashed its motors so that it would remain there.She dropped back into the car, trying not to look at the bodies or smell the reek of blood and other body fluids that had gotten all over it, and that were now draining out the open doors and dripping down the shaft.It would not take long for any of this to be discovered.She had some time, though; all she had to do was decide how to make use of it.The maintenance closet had a matter compiler, just like the one Nell had used to make her weapons, and she knew that she could use it to compile explosives and booby trap the lobby.But the Fists had explosives of their own and could just as well blow the top floors of the building to kingdom come.For that matter, they were probably down in some basement control room watching traffic on the building's Feed network.Use of the M. C.  would simply announce her location; they would shut off the Feed and then come after her slowly and carefully.She took a quick tour of the offices, sizing up her resources.Looking out the panoramic windows of the finest office suite, she saw a new state of affairs in the streets of Pudong.Many of the skyscrapers had been rooted in lines from the foreign Feeds and were now dark, though in some places flames vented from broken windows, casting primitive illumination over the streets a thousand feet below.These buildings had mostly been evacuated, and so the streets were crowded with far more people than they could really handle.The plaza immediately surrounding this particular building had been staked out by a picket line of Fists and was relatively uncrowded.She found a windowless room with mediatronic walls that bore a bewildering collage of images: flowers, details of European cathedrals and Shinto temples, Chinese landscape art, magnified images of insects and pollen grains, many armed Indian goddesses, planets and moons of the solar system, abstract patterns from the Islamic world, graphs of mathematical equations, head shots of models male and female.Other than that, the room was empty except for a model of the building that stood in the center of the room, about Nell's height.The model's skin was mediatronic, just like the skin of the building itself, and it was currently echoing (as she supposed) whatever images were being displayed on the outside of the building: mostly advertising panels, though some Fists had apparently come in here and scrawled graffiti across them.On top of the model rested a stylus just a black stick pointed on one end and a palette, covered with a color wheel and other controls.Nell picked them up, touched the tip of the stylus to a green area on the palette's color wheel, and drew it across the surface of the model.A glowing green line appeared along the track of the stylus, disfiguring an ad panel for an airship line.Whatever other steps Nell might take in the time she had left, there was one thing she could do quickly and easily here.She was not entirely sure why she did it, but some intuition told her that it might be useful; or perhaps it was an artistic urge to make something that would live longer than she would, even if only by a few minutes.She began by erasing all of the big advertising panels on the upper levels of the skyscraper.Then she sketched out a simple line drawing in primary colors: an escutcheon in blue, and within it, a crest depicting a book drawn in red and white; crossed keys in gold; and a seed in brown.She caused this image to be displayed on all sides of the skyscraper, between the hundredth and two hundredth floors.Then she tried to think of a way out of this place.Perhaps there were airships on the roof.There would certainly be Fist guards up there, but perhaps through a combination of stealth and suddenness she could overcome them.She used the emergency stairs to make her way up to the next floor, then the next, and then the next.Two flights above, she could hear Fist guards posted at the roof, talking to each other and playing mah jongg.Many flights below, she could hear more Fists making their way up the stairs one flight at a time, looking for her.She was pondering her next move when the guards above her were rudely interrupted by orders squawking from their radios.Several Fists came charging down the stairway, shouting excitedly.Nell, trapped in the stairwell, made herself ready to ambush them as they came toward her, but instead they ran into the top floor and made for the elevator lobby.Within a minute or two, an elevator had arrived and carried them away.Nell waited for a while, listening, and could no longer hear the contingent approaching from below.She climbed up the last flights of stairs and emerged onto the building's roof, exhilarated as much by the fresh air as by the discovery that it was completely deserted.She walked to the edge of the roof and peered down almost half a mile to the street.In the black windows of a dead skyscraper across the way, she could see the mirror image of Princess Nell's crest.After a minute or two, she noticed that something akin to a shock wave was making its way down the street far below, moving in slow motion, covering a city block every couple of minutes.Details were difficult to make out at this distance: it was a highly organized group of pedestrians, all wearing the same generally dark clothing, ramming its way through the mob of refugees, forcing the panicked barbarians toward the picket line of the Fists or sideways into the lobbies of the dead buildings.Nell was transfixed for several minutes by this sight.Then she happened to glance down a different street and saw the same phenomenon there.She made a quick circuit of the building's roof.All in all, several columns were advancing inexorably on the foundations of the building where Nell stood.In time, one of these columns broke through the last of the obstructing refugees and reached the edge of the broad open plaza that surrounded the foot of Nell's building, where it faced off against the Fist defenses.The column stopped abruptly at this point and waited for a few minutes, collecting itself and waiting for the other columns to catch up.Nell had supposed at first that these columns might be Fist reinforcements converging on this building, which was clearly intended to be the headquarters of their final assault on the Coastal Republic.But it soon became evident that these newcomers had arrived for other purposes.After a few minutes of unbearable tension had gone by in nearly perfect silence, the columns suddenly, on the same unheard signal, erupted into the plaza.As they debouched from the narrow streets, they spread out into many pronged formations, arranging themselves with the precision of a professional drill team, and then charged forward into the suddenly panicked and disorganized Fists, throwing up a tremendous battle cry.When that sound echoed up two hundred stories to Nell's ears, she felt her hair standing on end, because it was not the deep lusty roar of grown men but the fierce thrill of thousands of young girls, sharp and penetrating as the skirl of massed bagpipes.It was Nell's tribe, and they had come for their leader.Nell spun on her heel and made for the stairway.By the time she had reached ground level and burst out, somewhat unwisely, into the building's lobby, the girls had breached the walls of the building in several places and rushed in upon the remaining defenders.They moved in groups of four.One girl (the largest) would rush toward an opponent, holding a pointed bamboo stick aimed at his heart.While his attention was thus fixed, two other girls (the smallest) would converge on him from the sides.Each girl would hug one of his legs and, acting together, they would lift him off the ground.The fourth girl (the fastest) would by this point have circled all the way round and would come in from behind, driving a knife or other weapon into the victim's back.During the half dozen or so applications of this technique that Nell witnessed, it never failed, and none of the girls ever suffered more than the odd bruise or scrape.Suddenly she felt a moment of wild panic as she thought they were doing the same to her; but after she had been lifted into the air, no attack came from front or back, though many girls rushed in from all sides, each adding her small strength to the paramount goal of hoisting Nell high into the air.Even as the last remnants of the Fists were being hunted down and destroyed in the nooks and corners of the lobby, Nell was being borne on the shoulders of her little sisters out the front doors of the building and into the plaza, where something like a hundred thousand girls Nell could not count all the regiments and brigades collapsed to their knees in unison, as though struck down by a divine wind, and presented her their bamboo stakes, pole knives, lead pipes, and nunchuks.The provisional commanders of her divisions stood foremost, as did her provisional ministers of defense, of state, and of research and development, all of them bowing to Nell, not with a Chinese bow or a Victorian one but something they'd come up with that was in between.Nell should have been tongue tied and paralyzed with astonishment, but she was not; for the first time in her life she understood why she'd been put on the earth and felt comfortable with her position.One moment, her life had been a meaningless abortion, and the next it all made glorious sense.She began to speak, the words rushing from her mouth as easily as if she had been reading them from the pages of the Primer.She accepted the allegiance of the Mouse Army, complimented them on their great deeds, and swept her arm across the plaza, over the heads of her little sisters, toward the thousands upon thousands of stranded sojourners from New Atlantis, Nippon, Israel, and all of the other Outer Tribes."Our first duty is to protect these," she said."Show me the condition of the city and all those in it. "They wanted to carry her, but she jumped to the stones of the plaza and strode away from the building, toward her ranks, which parted to make way for her.The streets of Pudong were filled with hungry and terrified refugees, and through them, in simple peasant clothes streaked with the blood of herself and of others, broken shackles dangling from her wrists, followed by her generals and ministers, walked the barbarian Princess with her book and her sword.Carl Hollywood takes a stroll to the waterfront.Carl Hollywood was awakened by a ringing in his ears and a burning in his cheek that turned out to be an inch long fragment of plate glass driven into his flesh.When he sat up, his bed made clanking and crashing noises, shedding a heavy burden of shattered glass, and a foetid exhalation from the wrecked windows blew over his face.Old hotels had their charms, but disadvantages too such as windowpanes made out of antique materials.Fortunately some old Wyoming instinct had caused him to leave his boots next to the bed the night before.He inverted each one and carefully probed it for broken glass before he pulled it on.Only when he had put on all of his clothes and gathered his things together did he go to look out the window.His hotel was near the Huang Pu waterfront.Looking across the river, he could see that great patches of Pudong had gone black against the indigo sky of predawn.A few buildings, connected to the indigenous Feeds, were still lit up.On this side of the river the situation was not so simple; Shanghai, unlike Pudong, had lived through many wars and was therefore made to be robust: the city was rife with secret power sources, old diesel generators, private Sources and Feeds, water tanks and cisterns.People still raised chickens for food in the shadow of the Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corporation.Shanghai would weather the onslaught of the Fists much better than Pudong.But as a white person, Carl Hollywood might not weather it very well at all.It was better to be across the river, in Pudong, with the rest of the Outer Tribes.From here to the waterfront was about three blocks; but since this was Shanghai, those three blocks were fraught with what in any other city would be three miles' worth of complications.The main problem was going to be Fists; he could already hear the cries of "Sha!Sha!"boiling up from the streets, and shining a pocket torch through the bars of his balcony, he could see many Fists, emboldened by the destruction of the foreign Feeds, running around with their scarlet girdles and headbands exposed to the world.If he weren't six and a half feet tall and blue eyed, he'd probably try to disguise himself as Chinese and slink to the waterfront, and it probably wouldn't work.He went through his closet and hauled out his big duster, which swept nearly to his ankles.It was proof against bullets and most nanotech projectiles.There was a long item of luggage he had thrown up on the closet shelf unopened.Hearing the reports of trouble, he had taken the precaution of bringing these relics with him: an engraved lever action .44 rifle with low tech iron sights and, as a last ditch sort of thing, a Colt revolver.These were unnecessarily glorious weapons, but he had long ago gotten rid of any of his guns that did not have historical or artistic value.Two gunshots sounded from within the building, very close to him.Moments later, someone knocked at his door.Carl wrapped his duster around him, in case someone decided to fire through the door, and peered out through the peephole.To his surprise, he saw a white haired Anglo gentleman with a handlebar mustache, gripping a semiautomatic.Carl had met him yesterday in the hotel bar; he was here trying to clear up some kind of business before the fall of Shanghai.He opened the door.The two men regarded each other briefly."One might think we had come for an antique weapons convention," the gentleman said through his mustache."Say, I'm frightfully sorry to have disturbed you, but I thought you might like to know that there are Fists in the hotel. "He gestured down the corridor with his gun.Carl poked his head out and discovered a dead bellboy sprawled out in front of an open door, still clutching a long knife."As it happens, I was already up," said Carl Hollywood, "and contemplating a bit of a stroll to the waterfront.Care to join me?""Delighted.Colonel Spence, Royal Joint Forces, Retired. ""Carl Hollywood. "On their way down the fire stairs, Spence killed two more hotel employees whom he had, on somewhat ambiguous grounds, identified as Fists.Carl was skeptical in both cases until Spence ripped their shirts open to reveal the scarlet girdles beneath."It's not that they're really Fists, you see," Spence explained jovially."Just that when the Fists come, this sort of nonsense becomes terribly fashionable. "After exchanging some more self consciously dry humor about whether they should settle their bills before departure, and how much you were supposed to tip a bellboy who came after you with a carving knife, they agreed it might be safest to exit through the kitchens.Half a dozen dead Fists littered the floor here, their bodies striped with the marks of cookie cutters.Arriving at the exit they found two fellow guests, both Israelis, staring at them with the fixed gaze that implies the presence of a skull gun.Seconds later, they were joined by two Zulu management consultants carrying long, telescoping poles with nanoblades affixed to the ends, which they used to destroy all of the light fixtures in their path.It took Carl a minute to appreciate their plan: They were all about to step out into a dark alley, and they would need their night vision.The door began to shudder in its frame and make tremendous booming noises.Carl stepped forward and peered through the peephole; it was a couple of urban homeboy types having at it with a fire axe.He stepped away from the door, shrugging the rifle from his shoulder, levered in a shell, and fired it through the door, aiming away from the youths.The booming stopped abruptly, and they heard the head of the axe ringing like a bell as it fell to the pavement.One of the Zulus kicked the door open and leapt into the alley, whirling his blade in a vast, fatal arc like the blade of a helicopter, slicing through a garbage can but not hitting any people.When Carl came piling through the door a few seconds later, he saw several young toughs scattering down the alley, dodging among several dozen refugees, loiterers, and street people who pointed helpfully at their receding backsides, making sure it was understood that their only reason for being in this alley at this time was to act as a sort of block watch on behalf of the gwailo visitors.Without talking about it much, they fell into an improvised formation there in the alley, where they had a bit of room to maneuver.The Zulus went in front, whirling their poles over their heads and hollering some kind of traditional war cry that drove a good many of the Chinese out of their path.One of the Jews went behind the Zulus, using his skull gun to pick off any Fists who charged them.Then came Carl Hollywood, who, with his height and his rifle, seemed to have ended up with the job of long range reconnaissance and defense.Colonel Spence and the other Israeli brought up the rear, walking backward most of the time.This got them down the alley without much trouble, but that was the easy part; when they reached the street, they were no longer the only focus of action but mere motes in a sandstorm.Colonel Spence discharged most of a clip into the air; the explosions were nearly inaudible in the chaos, but the gouts of light from the weapon's barrel drew some attention, and people in their immediate vicinity actually got out of their way.Carl saw one of the Zulus do something very ugly with his long weapon and looked away; then he reflected that it was the Zulus' job to break trail and his to concentrate on more distant threats.He turned slowly around as he walked, trying to ignore the threat that was just beyond arm's length and to get a view of the larger scene.They had walked into a completely disorganized street fight between the Coastal Republic forces and the Fists of Righteous Harmony, which was not made any clearer by the fact that many of the Coastals had defected by tying strips of red cloth round the arms of their uniforms, and that many of the Fists were not wearing any markings at all, and that many others who had no affiliation were taking advantage of the situation to loot stores and were being fought off by private guards; many of the looters were themselves being mugged by organized gangs.They were on Nanjing Road, a broad thoroughfare leading straight to the Bund and the Huang Pu, lined with four and five story buildings so that many windows looked out over them, any one of which might have contained a sniper.A few of them did contain snipers, Carl realized, but many of these were shooting across the street at each other, and the ones who were firing into the street could have been shooting at anyone.Carl saw one fellow with a laser sighted rifle emptying clip after clip into the street, and he reckoned that this constituted a clear and present danger; so at a moment when their forward progress had stalled momentarily, while the Zulus were waiting for an especially desperate Coastal/Fist melee to resolve itself ahead of them, Carl planted his feet, swung his rifle up to his shoulder, took aim, and fired.In the dim fire and torch light rising up from the street, he could see powder explode from the stone window frame just above the sniper's head.The sniper cringed, then began to sweep the street with his laser, looking for the source of the bullet.Someone jostled Carl from behind.It was Spence, who had been hit with something and lost the use of his leg.A Fist was in the Colonel's face.Carl rammed the butt of the rifle into the man's chin, sending him backward into the melee with his eyes rolled up into their sockets.Then he levered in another shell, raised the weapon to his shoulder again, and tried to find the window with his sniper friend.He was still there, tracing a ruby red line patiently across the boiling surface of the crowd.Carl took in a deep breath, released it slowly, prayed that no one would bump into him, and squeezed the trigger.The rifle butted him hard in the shoulder, and at the same moment he saw the sniper's rifle fall out of the window, spinning end over end, the laser beam sweeping through the smoke and steam like the trace on a radar scope.The whole thing had probably been a bad idea; if any of the other snipers had seen this, they'd be wanting to get rid of him, whatever their affiliation.Carl levered in another shell and then let the rifle dangle from one hand, pointed down at the street, where it wouldn't be so conspicuous.He got the other hand into Spence's armpit and helped him continue down the street.The ends of Spence's mustache wiggled as he continued with his endless and unflappable line of patter; Carl couldn't hear a word but nodded encouragingly.Not even the most literal minded neo Victorian could take that stiff upper lip thing seriously; Carl realized now that it was all done with a nod and a wink.It was not Colonel Spence's way of saying that he wasn't scared; it was, rather, a code of sorts, a face saving way for him to admit that he was terrified half out of his wits, and for Carl to admit likewise.Several Fists rushed them at once; the Zulus got two, the leading Israeli got one, but another came in and bounced his knife from the Israeli's knife proof jacket.Carl raised the rifle, clamping the stock between his arm and his body, and fired from the hip.The recoil nearly knocked the weapon out of his hand; the Fist practically did a backflip.He couldn't believe they had not reached the waterfront yet; they had been doing this for hours.Something prodded him hard in the back, causing him to stumble forward; he looked back over his shoulder and saw a man trying to run him through with a bayonet.Another man ran up and tried to wrench the rifle out of Carl's hand.Carl, too startled to respond for a moment, finally let go of Spence, reached across, and poked him in the eyes.A great explosion sounded in his ear, and he looked over to see that Spence had twisted himself round and shot the attacker who had the bayonet.The Israeli who had been guarding their rear had simply vanished.Carl raised his rifle toward the people who were converging on them from the rear; that and Spence's pistol opened up a gratifying clear space in their wake.But something more powerful and terrifying was driving more people toward them from the side, and as Carl tried to see what it was, he realized that a score of Chinese people were now between him and the Zulus.The looks on their faces were pained and panicky; they were not attacking, they were being attacked.Suddenly all of the Chinese were gone.Carl and Colonel Spence found themselves commingled with a dozen or so Boers not just men, but women and children and elders too, a whole laager on the move.All of them surged forward instinctively and reabsorbed the vanguard of Carl's group.They were a block from the waterfront.The Boer leader, a stout man of about fifty, somehow identified Carl Hollywood as the leader, and they quickly redeployed what forces they had for the final push to the waterfront.The only thing Carl remembered of this conversation was the man saying, "Good.You've got Zulus. "The Boers in the vanguard were carrying some sort of automatic weapons firing tiny nanotech high explosive rounds, which, indiscriminately used, could have turned the crowd into a rampart of chewed meat; but they fired the weapons in disciplined bursts even when the charging Fists penetrated to within a sword's length.From time to time, one of them would raise his head and sweep a row of windows with continuous automatic fire; riflemen would tumble out of the darkness and spin down into the street like rag dolls.The Boers must be wearing some kind of night vision stuff.Colonel Spence suddenly felt very heavy on Carl's arm, and he realized that the Colonel was unconscious, or close to it.Carl slung the rifle over his shoulder, bent down, and picked up Spence in a fireman's carry.They arrived at the waterfront and established a defensive perimeter.The next question was: Were there any boats?But this part of China was half underwater and seemed to have as many boats as bicycles.Most of them seemed to have found their way downstream to Shanghai during the gradual onslaught of the Fists.So when they arrived at the water's edge, they discovered thousands of people with boats, eager to transact some business.But as the Boer leader rightly pointed out, it would be suicide to split up the group among several tiny, unpowered craft; the Fists were paying high bounties for the heads of barbarians.Much safer to wait for one of the larger vessels out in the channel to make its way to shore, where they could cut a deal with the captain and climb on board as a group.Several vessels, ranging from motor yachts to fishing trawlers, were already vying to be the first to make that deal, shouldering their way inexorably through the organic chaff of small boats crowded along the shore.A rhythmic beat had begun to resonate in their lungs.At first it sounded like drumbeats, but as it drew closer it developed into the sound of hundreds or thousands of human voices chanting in unison: "Sha!Sha!Sha!Sha!"Nanjing Road began to vomit forth a great crowd of people shoved out onto the Bund like exhaust pushed out by a piston.They cleared out of the way, dispersing up and down the riverfront.An army of hoplites professional warriors in battle armor was marching toward the river, a score abreast, completely filling the width of Nanjing Road.These were not Fists; they were the regular army, the vanguard of the Celestial Kingdom, and Carl Hollywood was appalled to realize that the only thing now standing between them and their three decade march to the banks of the Huang Pu was Carl Hollywood, his .44, and a handful of lightly armed civilians.A nice looking yacht had penetrated to within a few meters of the shore.The remaining Israeli, who was fluent in Mandarin, had already commenced negotiations with its captain.One of the Boers, a wiry grandmother with a white bun on her head and a black bonnet pinned primly over that, conferred briefly with the Boer leader.He nodded once, then caught her face in his hands and kissed her.She turned her back on the waterfront and began to march toward the head of the advancing column of Celestials.The few Chinese crazy enough to remain along the waterfront, respecting her age and possible madness, parted to make way for her.The negotiations over the boat appeared to have hit some kind of snag.Carl Hollywood could see individual hoplites vaulting two and three stories into the air, crashing headfirst into the windows of the Cathay Hotel.The Boer grandmother doggedly made her way forward until she was standing in the middle of the Bund.The leader of the Celestial column stepped toward her, covering her with some kind of projectile weapon built into one arm of his suit and waving her aside with the other.The Boer woman carefully got down on both knees in the middle of the road, clasped her hands together in prayer, and bowed her head.Then she became a pearl of white light in the mouth of the dragon.In an instant this pearl grew to the size of an airship.Carl Hollywood had the presence of mind to close his eyes and turn his head away, but he didn't have time to throw himself down; the shock wave did that, slamming him full length into the granite paving stones of the waterfront promenade and tearing about half of his clothes from his body.Some time passed before he was really conscious; he felt it must have been half an hour, though debris was still raining down around him, so five seconds was probably more like it.The hull of the white yacht had been caved in on one side and most of its crew flung into the river.But a minute later, a fishing trawler pulled up and took the barbarians on board with only perfunctory negotiations.Carl nearly forgot about Spence and almost left him there; he found that he no longer had the strength to raise the Colonel's body from the ground, so he dragged him on board with the help of a couple of young Boers identical twins, he realized, maybe thirteen years old.As they headed across the Huang Pu, Carl Hollywood huddled on a piled up fishing net, limp and weak as though his bones had all been shattered, staring at the hundred foot crater in the center of the Bund and looking into the rooms of the Cathay Hotel, which had been neatly cross sectioned by the bomb in the Boer woman's body.Within fifteen minutes, they were free on the streets of Pudong.Carl Hollywood found his way to the local New Atlantan encampment, reported for duty, and spent a few minutes composing a letter to Colonel Spence's widow; the Colonel had bled to death from a leg wound during the voyage across the river.Then he spread his pages out on the ground before him and returned to the pursuit that had occupied him in his hotel room for the past few days, namely, the search for Miranda.He had begun this search at the bidding of Lord Finkle McGraw, pursued it with mounting passion over the last few days as he had begun to understand how much he'd been missing Miranda, and was now pressing the work desperately; for he had realized that in this search might reside the only hope for the salvation of the tens of thousands of Outer Tribesmen now encamped upon the dead streets of the Pudong Economic Zone.Final onslaught of the Fists;  victory of the Celestial Kingdom;  refugees in the domain of the Drummers;  Miranda.The Huang Pu stopped the advance of the Celestial Army toward the sea, but having crossed the river farther inland, it continued to move northward up the Pudong Peninsula at a walking pace, driving before it flocks of starving peasants much like the ones who had been their harbingers in Shanghai.The occupants of Pudong a mixture of barbarians, Coastal Republic Chinese who feared persecution at the hands of their Celestial cousins, and Nell's little sisters, a third of a million strong and constituting a new phyle unto themselves were thus caught between the Celestials on the south, the Huang Pu on the west, the Yangtze on the north, and the ocean on the east.All the links to the artificial islands offshore had been cut.The geotects of Imperial Tectonics, in their Classical and Gothic temples high atop New Chusan, made various efforts to build a temporary bridge between their island and Pudong.It was simple enough to throw a truss or floating bridge across the gap, but the Celestials now had the technology to blow such things up faster than they could be constructed.On the second day of the siege, they caused the island to reach toward Pudong with a narrow pseudopod of smart coral, rooted on the ocean floor.But there were very simple and clear limits to how fast such things could be grown, and as the refugees continued to throng the narrow defiles of downtown Pudong, bearing increasingly dire reports of the Celestials' advance, it became evident to everyone that the land bridge would not be completed in time.The encampments of the various tribes moved north and east as they were forced out of downtown by the pressure of the refugees and fear of the Celestials, until several miles of shoreline had been claimed and settled by the various groups.The southern end, along the seashore, was anchored by the New Atlantans, who had prepared themselves to fend off any assaults along the beach.The chain of camps extended northward from there, curving along the ocean and then eastward along the banks of the Yangtze to the opposite end, which was anchored by Nippon against any onslaught across the tidal flats.The entire center of the line was guarded against a direct frontal assault by Princess Nell's tribe/army of twelve year old girls, who were gradually trading in their pointed sticks for more modern weapons compiled from portable Sources owned by the Nipponese and the New Atlantans.Carl Hollywood had been assigned to military duty as soon as he reported to the New Atlantan authorities, despite his efforts to convince his superiors that he might be of more use pursuing his own line of research.But then a message came through from the highest levels of Her Majesty's government.The first part of it praised Carl Hollywood for his "heroic" actions in getting the late Colonel Spence out of Shanghai and suggested that a knighthood might be waiting for him if he ever got out of Pudong.The second part of it named him as a special envoy of sorts to Her Royal Highness, Princess Nell.Reading the message, Carl was momentarily stunned that his Sovereign was according equivalent status to Nell; but upon some reflection he saw that it was simultaneously just and pragmatic.During his time in the streets of Pudong, he had seen enough of the Mouse Army (as they called themselves, for some reason) to know that they did, in fact, constitute a new ethnic group of sorts, and that Nell was their undisputed leader.Victoria's esteem for the new sovereign was well founded.At the same time, that the Mouse Army was currently helping to protect many New Atlantans from being taken hostage, or worse, by the Celestial Kingdom made such recognition an eminently pragmatic step.It fell to Carl Hollywood, who had been a member of his adopted tribe only for a few months, to forward Her Majesty's greetings and felicitations to Princess Nell, a girl about whom he had heard much from Miranda but whom he had never met and could hardly fathom.It did not take very deep reflection to see the hand of Lord Alexander Chung Sik Finkle McGraw in all this.Freed from day to day responsibilities, he walked north from the New Atlantan camp on the third day of the siege, following the tideline.Every few yards he came to a tribal border and presented a visa that, under the provisions of the Common Economic Protocol, was supposed to afford him free passage.Some of the tribal zones were only a meter or two wide, but their owners jealously guarded their access to the sea, sitting up all night staring out into the surf, waiting for some unspecified form of salvation.Carl Hollywood strolled through encampments of Ashantis, Kurds, Armenians, Navajos, Tibetans, Senderos, Mormons, Jesuits, Lapps, Pathans, Tutsis, the First Distributed Republic and its innumerable offshoots, Heartlanders, Irish, and one or two local CryptNet cells who had now been flushed into the open.He discovered synthetic phyles he had never heard of, but this did not surprise him.Finally he came to a generous piece of beach frontage guarded by twelve year old Chinese girls.At this point he presented his credentials from Her Majesty Queen Victoria II, which were extremely impressive, so much so that many of the girls gathered around to marvel at them.Carl Hollywood was surprised to hear them all speaking perfect English in a rather high Victorian style.They seemed to prefer it when discussing things in the abstract, but when it came to practical matters they reverted to Mandarin.He was ushered through the lines into the Mouse Army's encampment, which was mostly an open air hospice for ragged, sick and injured discards from other phyles.The ones who weren't flat on their backs, being tended to by Mouse Nurses, were sitting on the sand, hugging their knees, staring out across the water in the direction of New Chusan.The slope of the land was quite gentle here, and a person could wade for a good long stone's throw into the waves.One person had: a young woman whose long hair fell about her shoulders and trailed in the water around her waist.She stood with her back to the shore, holding a book in her hands, and did not move for a long time."What is she doing out there?"Carl Hollywood said to his Mouse Army escort, who had five little stars on her lapels.In Pudong, he had figured out their insignia: Five stars meant that she was in charge of (4)5 people, or 1,024.A regimental commander, then."She is calling to her mother. ""Her mother?""Her mother is beneath the waves," the woman said."She is a Queen. ""Queen of what?""She is the Queen of the Drummers who live beneath the sea. "And then Carl Hollywood knew that Princess Nell was searching for Miranda too.He threw his long coat down on the sand and sloshed out Into the Pacific, accompanied by the officer, and remained at a judicious distance, partly to show due respect, and partly because Nell had a sword in her waistband.Her face was inclined over the pages of her book like a focusing lens, and he half expected the pages to curl and smoke under her gaze.She looked up from the book after some time.The officer spoke to her in a low voice.Carl Hollywood did not know the protocol when one was up to midthigh in the East China Sea, so he stepped forward, bowed as low as he could under the circumstances, and handed Princess Nell the scroll from Queen Victoria II.She accepted it wordlessly and read it through, then went back to the top and read it again.Then she handed it to her officer, who rolled it up carefully.Princess Nell stared out over the waves for a while, then looked Carl in the eye and said quietly, "I accept your credentials and request that you convey my warm thanks and regard to Her Majesty, along with my apologies that circumstances prevent me from composing a more formal response to her kind letter, which at any other time would naturally be my highest priority. ""I shall do so at the earliest opportunity, Your Majesty," Carl Hollywood said.Hearing these words, Princess Nell looked a bit unsteady and shifted her feet to maintain her balance; though this might have been the undertow.Carl realized that she had never been addressed in this way before; that, until she had been recognized in this fashion by Victoria, she had never fully realized her position."The woman you seek is named Miranda," he said.All thoughts of crowns, queens, and armies seemed to vanish from Nell's mind, and she was just a young lady again, looking for what?Her mother?Her teacher?Her friend?Carl Hollywood spoke to Nell in a low gentle voice, projecting just enough to be heard over the strumming of the waves.He spoke to her of Miranda, and of the book, and of the old stories about the deeds of Princess Nell, which he had watched from the wings, as it were, by looking in on Miranda's feed many years ago at the Parnasse.Over the next two days many of the refugees on the shore got away on air or surface ships, but a few of these were destroyed in spectacular fashion before they could get out of range of the Celestial Kingdom's weaponry.Three quarters of the Mouse Army evacuated itself through the technique of stripping naked and walking into the ocean en masse, linked arm in arm into a flexible and unsinkable raft that gradually, slowly, exhaustingly paddled across the sea to New Chusan.Rumors spread rapidly up and down the length of the coast; the tribal borders seemed to accelerate rather than hinder this process as interfaces between languages and cultures spawned new variants of each rumor, tailored to the local fears and prejudices.The most popular rumor was that the Celestials planned to give everyone safe passage and that the attacks were being carried out by intelligent mines that had run out of control or, at worst, by a few fanatical commanders who were defying orders and who would soon be brought to heel.There was a second, stranger rumor that gave some people an incentive to remain on the shore and not entrust themselves to the evacuation ships: A young woman with a book and a sword was creating magical tunnels from out of the deep that would carry them all away to safety.Such ideas were naturally met with skepticism among more rational cultures, but on the morning of the sixth day of the siege, the neap tide carried a peculiar omen up onto the sand: a harvest of translucent eggs the size of beach balls.'When their fragile shells were torn open, they were found to contain sculpted backpacks pierced with a fractal pattern of delicate louvers.A stiff hose extended from the top and connected to a facemask.Under the circumstances, it was not difficult to divine the use of these objects.People strapped the packs onto their backs, slipped on the facemasks, and plunged into the water.The backpacks acted like the gills of a fish and provided a steady supply of oxygen.The gill packs did not carry any tribal identification; they merely washed up onto the beach, by the thousands, with each high tide, cast up organically by the sea.The Atlantans, Nipponese, and others each assumed that they had come from their own tribes.But many perceived a connection between this and the rumors of Princess Nell and the tunnels beneath the waves.Such people migrated toward the center of the Pudong coast, where the tiny, weak, and flaky tribes had all been concentrated.This contraction of the defensive line became inevitable as the number of defenders was shrunk by the evacuation.Borders between tribes became unstable and finally dissolved, and on the fifth day of the siege the barbarians had all become fungible and formed into a huddle on the uttermost point of the Pudong Peninsula, several tens of thousands of persons packed into an area not exceeding a few city blocks.Beyond that were the Chinese refugees, mostly persons strongly identified with the Coastal Republic who knew that they could never blend into the Celestial Kingdom.These did not dare to invade the camp of the refugees, who were still armed with powerful weapons, but by advancing an inch at a time and never retreating, they insensibly shrank the perimeter so that many barbarians found themselves standing knee deep in the ocean.The rumor spread that the woman called Princess Nell had a wizard and adviser named Carl, who had appeared out of nowhere one day knowing nearly everything that Princess Nell did, and a few things she didn't.This man, according to rumor, had in his possession a number of magic keys that gave him and the Princess power to speak with the Drummers who lived beneath the waves.On the seventh day, Princess Nell walked naked into the sea at dawn, vanished beneath waves turned pink by the sunrise, and did not return.Carl followed her a minute later, though unlike the Princess he took the precaution of wearing a gill pack.Then all of the barbarians stepped into the ocean, leaving their filthy clothes strewn across the beach, relinquishing the last foothold of Chinese soil to the Celestial Kingdom.They all walked into the ocean until their heads disappeared.The rearguard was made up of the last part of the Mouse Army, which charged naked into the surf, linked up into a raft, and made its way slowly out to sea, nudging a few sick and wounded along with them in makeshift rafts.By the time the last girl's foot broke contact with the sandy ocean bottom, the end of the land had already been claimed by a man with a scarlet girdle round his waist, who stood on the shore laughing to think that now the Middle Kingdom was at last a whole country once more.The last foreign devil to depart from the Middle Kingdom was a blond Victorian gentleman with gray eyes, who stood in the waves for some time looking back over Pudong before he turned around and continued his descent.As the sea rose over him, it lifted the bowler from his head, and the hat continued to bob on the tide for some minutes as the Chinese detonated strings of firecrackers on the shore and tiny shreds of the red paper wrappers drifted over the sea like cherry petals....On one of her forays into the surf, Nell had encountered a man a Drummer who had come swimming out of the deep, naked except for a gill pack.This should have astonished her; instead, she had known he was out there before she saw him, and when he came close, she could feel things happening in her mind that were coming in from outside.There was something in her brain that made her connected to the Drummers.Nell had drawn up some general plans and given them to her engineers for further elaboration, and they had given them to Carl, who had taken them to a functioning portable M. C.  in the New Atlantan camp and compiled a little system for examining and manipulating nanotechnological devices.In the dark, motes of light sparkled in Nell's flesh, like airplane beacons in the night sky.They scraped one of these away with a scalpel and examined it.They found similar devices circulating in her bloodstream.These things, they realized, must have been put into Nell's blood when she was raped.It was clear that the sparkling lights in Nell's flesh were beacons signaling to others across the gulf that separates each of us from our neighbors.Carl opened one of the things from Nell's blood and found a rod logic system inside, and a tape drive containing some few gigabytes of data.The data was divided into discrete chunks, each one of which was separately encrypted.Carl tried all of the keys that he had obtained from John Percival Hackworth and found that one of them Hackworth's key unlocked some of the chunks.When he examined the decrypted contents, he discovered fragments of a plan for some kind of nanotechnological device.They drew blood from several volunteers and found that one of them had the same little devices in his blood.When they put two of these devices in close proximity, they locked onto one another using lidar and embraced, exchanging data and performing some sort of computation that threw off waste heat.The devices lived in the blood of the human race like viruses and passed from one person to the next during sex or any other exchange of bodily fluids; they were smart packets of data, just like the ones traversing the media network, and by mating with one another in the blood, they formed a vast system of communication, parallel to and probably linked with the dry Net of optical lines and copper wires.Like the dry Net, the wet Net could be used for doing computations for running programs.And it was now clear that John Percival Hackworth was using it for exactly that, running some kind of vast distributed program of his own devising.He was designing something."Hackworth is the Alchemist," Nell said, "and he is using the wet Net to design the Seed. "...Half a kilometer offshore, the tunnels began.Some of them must have been there for many years, for they were rough as tree trunks, encrusted with barnacles and algae.But it was clear that in the last few days they had forked and split organically, like roots questing for moisture; clean new tubes forced their way out through the encrustation and ran uphill toward the tide line, splitting again and again until many orifices presented themselves to the refugees.The shoots terminated in lips that grabbed people and drew them in, like the tip of an elephant's trunk, accepting the refugees with a minimum of seawater.The tunnels were lined with mediatronic images urging them forward into the deep; it always seemed as though a warm dry well lit space awaited them just a bit farther down the line.But the light moved along with the viewer so that they were drawn down the tunnels in a kind of peristalsis.The refugees came to the main tunnel, the old encrusted one, and continued moving on, now packed together in a solid mass, until they were disgorged into a large open cavity far below the surface of the ocean.Here, food and fresh water awaited them and they ate hungrily.Two people did not eat or drink except from the provisions they had brought with them; these were Nell and Carl.After they had discovered the nanosites in Nell's flesh that made her a part of the Drummers, Nell had stayed up through the night and designed a counternanosite, one that would seek out and destroy the Drummers' devices.She and Carl had both put these devices into their bloodstreams, so that Nell was now free of the Drummers' influences and both of them would remain so.Nevertheless they did not press their luck by eating of the Drummers' food, and it was well, because after their meal the refugees became drowsy and lay down on the floor and slept, steam rising from their naked flesh, and before long the sparks of light began to come on, like stars coming out as the sun goes down.After two hours the stars had merged together into a continuous surface of flickering light, bright enough to read by, as if a full moon were shining down upon the bodies of slumbering revelers in a meadow.The refugees, now Drummers, all slept and dreamed the same dream, and the abstract lights flickering across the mediatronic lining of the cavern began to coalesce and organize themselves into dark memories from deep within their unconscious mind.Nell began to see things from her own life, experiences long since assimilated into the words of the Primer but here shown once more in a raw and terrifying form.She closed her eyes; but the walls made sounds too, from which she could not escape.Carl Hollywood was monitoring the signals passing through the walls of the tunnels, avoiding the emotional content of these images by reducing them to binary digits and trying to puzzle out their internal codes and protocols."We have to go," Nell said finally, and Carl arose and followed her through a randomly chosen exit.The tunnel forked and forked again, and Nell chose forks by intuition.Sometimes the tunnels would widen into great caverns full of luminescent Drummers, sleeping or fucking or simply pounding on the walls.The caverns always had many outlets, which forked and forked and converged upon other caverns, the web of tunnels so vast and complicated that it seemed to fill the entire ocean, like neural bodies with their dendrites knitting and ramifying to occupy the whole volume of the skull.A low drumming sound had been skirting the lower limits of perceptibility ever since they had left the cavern where the refugees slumbered.Nell had first taken it for the beat of submarine currents on the walls of the tunnel, but as it grew stronger, she knew that it was the Drummers talking to each other, convened in some central cavern sending messages out across their network.Realizing this, she felt a sense of urgency verging on panic that they find the central assembly, and for some time they ran through the perfectly bewildering three dimensional maze, trying to locate the epicenter of the drumming.Carl Hollywood could not run as quickly as the nimble Nell and eventually lost her at a fork in the tunnels.From there he made his own judgments, and after some time had passed it was impossible to know how long his tunnel dovetailed with another that was carrying a stream of Drummers downward toward the floor of the ocean.Carl recognized some of these Drummers as former refugees from the beaches at Pudong.The sound of the drumming did not build gradually but exploded to a deafening, mind dissolving roar as Carl emerged into a vast cavern, a conical amphitheatre that must have been a kilometer wide, roofed with a storm of mediatronic images that played across a vast dome.The Drummers, visible by the flickering light of the overhead media storm and by their own internal light, moved up and down the slopes of the cone in a kind of convection pattern.Caught up in an eddy, Carl was transported down toward the center and found that an orgy of fantastic dimensions was underway.The steam of vaporized sweat rose from the center of the pit in a cloud.The bodies pressing against Carl's naked skin were so hot that they almost burned him, as if everyone were running a high fever, and in some logical abstract compartment of his mind that was, somehow, continuing to run along its own reasonable course, he realized why: They were exchanging packets of data with their bodily fluids, the packets were mating in their blood, the rod logic throwing off heat that drove up their core temperature.The orgy went on for hours, but the pattern of convection gradually slowed down and condensed into a stable arrangement, like a circulating crowd in a theatre that settles into its assigned seats as curtain time approaches A broad open space had formed at the center of the pit and the innermost ring of spectators consisted of men as if these were in some sense the winners of the enormous fornication tournament that was nearing its final round.A lone Drummer circulated around this innermost ring, handing something out; the something turned out to be mediatronic condoms that glowed bright colors when they were stripped onto the men's erect phalluses.A lone woman entered the ring.The floor at the absolute center of the pit rose up beneath her feet, shoving her into the air as on an altar.The drumming built to an unbearable crescendo and then stopped.Then it began again a very slow steady beat and the men in the inner circle began to dance around her.Carl Hollywood saw that the woman in the center was Miranda.He saw it all now: that the refugees had been gathered into the realm of the Drummers for the harvest of fresh data running in their bloodstreams, that this data had been infused into the wet Net in the course of the great orgy, and that all of it was now going to be dumped into Miranda, whose body would play host to the climax of some computation that would certainly burn her alive in the process.It was Hackworth's doing; this was the culmination of his effort to design the Seed, and in so doing to dissolve the foundations of New Atlantis and Nippon and all of the societies that had grown up around the concept of a centralized, hierarchical Feed.A lone figure, remarkable because her skin did not emit any light, was fighting her way in toward the center.She burst into the inner circle, knocking down a dancer who got in her way, and climbed up onto the central altar where Miranda lay on her back, arms outstretched as if crucified, her skin a galaxy of colored lights.Nell cradled Miranda's head in her arms, bent down, and kissed her, not a soft brush of the lips but a savage kiss with open mouth, and she bit down hard as she did it, biting through her own lips and Miranda's so that their blood mingled.The light shining from Miranda's body diminished and slowly went out as the nanosites were hunted down and destroyed by the hunter killers that had crossed into her blood from Nell's.Miranda came awake and arose, her arms draped weakly around Nell's neck.The drumming had stopped; the Drummers all sat impassively, clearly content to wait for years if necessary for a woman who could take Miranda's place.The light from their flesh had diminished, and the overhead mediatron had gone dim and vague.Carl Hollywood, seeing at last a role for himself, stepped into the center, got one arm under Miranda's knees and another beneath her shoulders, and lifted her into the air.Nell turned around and led them up out of the cavern, holding her sword out before her; but none of the Drummers moved to stop them.They passed up through many tunnels, always taking the uphill fork until they saw sunlight shining down from above through the waves, casting lines of white light on the translucent roof.Nell severed the tunnel behind them, wielding her sword like the sweep of a clock's hand.The warm water rushed in on them.Nell swam up toward the light.Miranda was not swimming strongly, and Carl was torn between a panicky desire to reach the surface and his duty to Miranda.Then he saw shadows descending from above, dozens of naked girls swimming downward, garlands of silver bubbles streaming from their mouths, their almond eyes excited and mischievous.Carl and Miranda were gripped by many gentle hands and borne upward into the light.New Chusan rose above them, a short swim away, and up on the mountain they could hear the bells of the cathedral ringing.
