"There's a week's room and board for a pesthry hunter," he said."Gone to waste. "He held out one for me to touch.The fur was so soft and deep that you could not be certain when your hand began to feel it.Our sleeping bags, coats, and hoods were lined with that same fur, an unsurpassed insulator and very beautiful to see."Hardly seems worth it," I said, "for a stew. "Estraven gave me his brief dark stare and said, "We need protein. "And tossed away the pelts, where overnight therussy, the fierce little rat snakes, would devour them and the entrails and the bones, and lick clean the bloody snow.He was right; he was generally right.There was a pound or two of edible meat on a pesthry.I ate my half of the stew that night and could have eaten his without noticing.Next morning, when we started up into the mountains, I was twice the sledge engine I had been.We went up that day.The beneficent snowfall andkroxet  windless weather between 0 F.  and 20 that had seen us through Tarrenpeth and out of range of probable pursuit, now dissolved wretchedly into above freezing temperatures and rain.Now I began to understand why Gethenians complain when the temperature rises in winter, and cheer up when it falls.In the city, rain is an inconvenience; to a traveler it is a catastrophe.We hauled that sledge up the flanks of the Sembensyens all morning through a deep, cold porridge of rain sodden snow.By afternoon on steep slopes the snow was mostly gone.Torrents of rain, miles of mud and gravel.We cased the runners, put the wheels on the sledge, and hauled on up.As a wheeled cart it was a bitch, sticking and tipping every moment.Dark fell before we found any shelter of cliff or cave to set up the tent in, so that despite all our care things got wet.Estraven had said that a tent such as ours would house us pretty comfortably in any weather at all, so long as we kept it dry inside."Once you can't dry out your bags, you lose too much body heat all night, and you don't sleep well.Our food ration's too short to allow us to afford that.We can't count on any sunlight to dry things out, so we must not get them wet. "I had listened, and had been as scrupulous as he about keeping snow and wet out of the tent, so that there was only the unavoidable moisture from our cooking, and our lungs and pores, to be evaporated.But this night everything was wet through before we could get the tent up.We huddled steaming over the Chabe stove, and presently had a stew of pesthry meat to eat, hot and solid, good enough almost to compensate for everything else.The sledge meter, ignoring the hard uphill work we had done all day, said we had come only nine miles."First day we've done less than our stint," I said.Estraven nodded, and neatly cracked a legbone for the marrow.He had stripped off his wet outer clothes and sat in shirt and breeches, barefoot, collar open.I was still too cold to take off my coat and hieb and boots.There he sat cracking marrowbones, neat, tough, durable, his sleek furlike hair shedding the water like a bird's feathers: he dripped a little onto his shoulders, like house eaves dripping, and never noticed it.He was not discouraged.He belonged here.The first meat ration had given me some intestinal cramps, and that night they got severe.I lay awake in the soggy darkness loud with rain.At breakfast he said, "You had a bad night. ""How did you know?"For he slept very deeply, scarcely moving, even when I left the tent.He gave me that look again."What's wrong?""Diarrhea. "He winced and said savagely, "It's the meat. ""I suppose so. ""My fault.I should "  "It's all right. ""Can you travel?""Yes. "Rain fell and fell.A west wind off the sea kept the temperature in the thirties, even here at three or four thousand feet of altitude.We never saw more than a quarter mile ahead through the gray mist and mass of rain.What slopes rose on above us I never looked up to see: nothing to see but rain falling.We went by compass, keeping as much to northward as the cut and veer of the great slopes allowed.The glacier had been over these mountainsides, in the hundreds of thousands of years it had been grinding back and forth across the North.There were tracks scored along granite slopes, long and straight as if cut with a great U gouge.We could pull the sledge along those scratches sometimes as if along a road.I did best pulling; I could lean into the harness, and the work kept me warm.When we stopped for a bite of food at midday, I felt sick and cold, and could not eat.We went on, climbing again now.Rain fell, and fell, and fell.Estraven stopped us under a great overhang of black rock, along in mid afternoon.He had the tent up almost before I was out of harness.He ordered me to go in and.lie down."I'm all right," I said."You're not," he said."Go on. "I obeyed, but I resented his tone.When he came into the tent with our night's needs, I sat up to cook, it being my turn.He told me in the same peremptory tone to lie still."You needn't order me about," I said."I'm sorry," he said inflexibly, his back turned."I'm not sick, you know. ""No, I didn't know.If you won't say frankly, I must go by your looks.You haven't recovered your strength, and the going has been hard.I don't know where your limits lie. ""I'll tell you when I reach them. "I was galled by his patronizing.He was a head shorter than I, and built more like a woman than a man, more fat than muscle; when we hauled together I had to shorten my pace to his, hold in my strength so as not to out pull him: a stallion in harness with a mule "You're no longer ill, then?""No.Of course I'm tired.So are you. ""Yes, I am," he said."I was anxious about you.We have a long way to go. "He had not meant to patronize.He had thought me sick, and sick men take orders.He was frank, and expected a reciprocal frankness that I might not be able to supply.He, after all, had no standards of manliness, of virility, to complicate his pride.On the other hand, if he could lower all his standards of shifgrethor, as I realized he had done with me, perhaps I could dispense with the more competitive elements of my masculine self respect, which he certainly understood as little as I understood shifgrethor..."How much of it did we cover today?"He looked around and smiled a little, gently."Six miles," he said.The next day we did seven miles, the next day twelve, and the day after that we came out of the rain, and out of the clouds, and out of the regions of mankind.It was the ninth day of our journey.We were five to six thousand feet above sealevel now, on a high plateau full of the evidences of recent mountain building and vulcanism; we were in the Fire Hills of the Sembensyen Range.The plateau narrowed gradually to a valley and the valley to a pass between long ridges.As we approached the end of the pass the rainclouds were thinning and rending.A cold north wind dispersed them utterly, laying bare the peaks above the ridges to our right and left, basalt and snow, piebald and patchwork of black and white brilliant under the sudden sun in a dazzling sky.Ahead of us, cleared and revealed by the same vast sweep of the wind, lay twisted valleys, hundreds of feet below, full of ice and boulders.Across those valleys a great wall stood, a wall of ice, and raising our eyes up and still up to the rim of the wall we saw the Ice itself, the Gobrin Glacier, blinding and horizonless to the utmost north, a white, a white the eyes could not look on.Here and there out of the valleys full of rubble and out of the cliffs and bends and masses of the great icefield's edge, black ridges rose; one great mass loomed up out of the plateau to the height of the gateway peaks we stood between, and from its side drifted heavily a mile long wisp of smoke.Farther off there were others: peaks, pinnacles, black cindercones on the glacier.Smoke panted from fiery mouths that opened out of the ice.Estraven stood there in harness beside me looking at that magnificent and unspeakable desolation."I'm glad I have lived to see this," he said.I felt as he did.It is good to have an end to journey towards; but it is the journey that matters, in the end.It had not rained, here on these north facing slopes.Snow fields stretched down from the pass into the valleys of moraine.We stowed the wheels, uncapped the sledge runners, put on our skis, and took off down, north, onward, into that silent vastness of fire and ice that said in enormous letters of black and white DEATH, DEATH, written right across a continent.The sledge pulled like a feather, and we laughed with joy.16.Between Drumner and Dremegole  Odyrny Thern.Ai asks from his sleeping bag, "What is it you're writing, Harth?""A record. "He laughs a little."I ought to be keeping a journal for the Ekumenical files; but I never could stick to it without a voice writer. "I explain that my notes are intended for my people at Estre, who will incorporate them as they see fit into the Records of the Domain; this turning my thoughts to my Hearth and my son, I seek to turn them away again, and ask, "Your parent your parents, that is are they alive?""No," says Ai."Seventy years dead. "I puzzled at it.Ai was not thirty years old."You're counting years of a different length than ours?""No.Oh, I see.I've timejumped.Twenty years from Earth to Hain Davenant, from there fifty to Ellul, from Ellul to here seventeen.I've only lived off Earth seven years, but I was born there a hundred and twenty years ago. "Long since in Erhenrang he had explained to me how time is shortened inside the ships that go almost as fast as starlight between the stars, but I had not laid this fact down against the length of a man's life, or the lives he leaves behind him on his own world.While he lived a few  hours in one of those unimaginable ships going from one planet to another, everyone he had left behind him at home grew old and died, and their children grew old...I said at last, "I thought myself an exile. ""You for my sake I for yours," he said, and laughed again, a slight cheerful sound in the heavy silence.These three days since we came down from the pass have been much hard work for no gain, but Ai is no longer downcast, nor overhopeful; and he has more patience with me.Maybe the drugs are sweated out of him.Maybe we have learned to pull together.We spent this day coming down from the basaltic spur which we spent yesterday climbing.From the valley it looked a good road up onto the Ice, but the higher we went the more scree and slick rock face we met, and a grade ever steeper, till even without the sledge we could not have climbed it.Tonight we are back down at the foot of it in the moraine, the valley of stones.Nothing grows here.Rock, pebble dump, boulder fields, clay, mud.An arm of the glacier has withdrawn from this slope within the last fifty or hundred years, leaving the planet's bones raw to the air; no flesh of earth, of grass.Here and there fumaroles cast a heavy yellowish fog over the ground, low and creeping.The air smells of sulphur.It is 12, still, overcast.I hope no heavy snow falls until we have got over the evil ground between this place and the glacier arm we saw some miles to the west from the ridge.It seems to be a wide ice river running down from the plateau between two mountains, volcanoes, both cappedwith steam and smoke.If we can get onto it from the slopes of the nearer volcano, it may provide us a road up onto the plateau of ice.To our east a smaller glacier comes down to a frozen lake, but it runs curving and even from here the great crevasses in it can be seen; it is impassible to us, equipped as we are.We agreed to try the glacier between the volcanoes, though by going west to it we lose at least two days' mileage towards our goal, one in going west and one in regaining the distance.Opposthe Thern.Snowingneserem*  *neserem:fine snow on a moderate gale: a light blizzard.No travel in this.We both slept all day.We have been hauling nearly a halfmonth, the sleep does us good.Ottormenbod Thern.Snowingneserem.Enough sleep.Ai taught me a Terran game played on squares with little stones, called go, an excellent difficult game.As he remarked, there are plenty of stones here to playgo with.He endures the cold pretty well, and if courage were enough, would stand it like a snow worm.It is odd to see him bundled up in hieb and overcoat with the hood up, when the temperature is above zero; but when we sledge, if the sun is out or the wind not too bitter, he takes off the coat soon and sweats like one of us.We must compromise as to the heating of the tent.He would keep it hot,  I cold, and either's comfort is the other's pneumonia.We strike a medium, and he shivers outside his bag, while I swelter in mine; but considering from what distances we have come together to share this tent a while, we do well enough.Getheny Thanern.Clear after the blizzard, wind down, the thermometer around 15 all day.We are camped on the lower western slope of the nearer volcano: Mount Dremegole, on my map of Orgoreyn.Its companion across the ice river is called Drumner.The map is poorly made; there is a great peak visible to the west not shown on it at all, and it is all out of proportion.The Orgota evidently do not often come into their Fire Hills.Indeed there is not much to come for, except grandeur.We hauled eleven miles today, difficult work: all rock.Ai is asleep already.I bruised the tendon of my heel, wrenching it like a fool when my foot was caught between two boulders, and limped out the afternoon.The night's rest should heal it.Tomorrow we should get down onto the glacier.Our food supplies seem to have sunk alarmingly, but it is because we have been eating the bulky stuff.We had between ninety and a hundred pounds of coarse foodstuffs, half of it the load I stole in Turuf; sixty pounds of this are gone, after fifteen days' journey.I have started on the gichy michy at a pound a day, saving two sacks of kadik germ, some sugar, and a chest of dried fishcakes for variety later.I am glad to be rid of that heavy stuff from Turuf.The sledge pulls lighter.Sordny Thanern.In the 20's; frozen rain, wind pouring down the ice river like the draft in a tunnel.Camped a quarter mile in from the edge, on a long flat streak of firn.The way down from Dremegole was rough and steep, on bare rock and rock fields; the glacier's edge heavily crevassed, and so foul with gravel and rocks caught in the ice that we tried the sledge on wheels there too.Before we had got a hundred yards a wheel wedged fast and the axle bent.We use runners henceforth.We made only four miles today, still in the wrong direction.The effluent glacier seems to run on a long curve westerly up to the Gobrin plateau.Here between the volcanoes it is about four miles wide, and should not be hard going farther in towards the center, though it is  more crevassed than I had hoped, and the surface rotten.Drumner is in eruption.The sleet on one's lips tastes of smoke and sulphur.A darkness loured all day in the west even under the rainclouds.From time to time all things, clouds, icy rain, ice, air, would turn a dull red, then fade slowly back to gray.The glacier shakes a little under our feet.Eskichwe rem ir Her hypothesized that the volcanic activity in N. W.  Orgoreyn and the Archipelago has been increasing during the last ten or twenty millennia, and presages the end of the Ice, or at least a recession of it and an interglacial period.CO2 released by the volcanoes into the atmosphere will in time serve as an insulator, holding in the longwave heat energy reflected from the earth, while permitting direct solar heat to enter undiminished.The average world temperature, he says, would in the end be raised some thirty degrees, till it attains 72.I am glad I shall not be present.Ai says that similar theories have been propounded by Terran scholars to explain the still incomplete recession of their last Age of Ice.All such theories remain largely irrefutable and unprovable; no one knows certainly why the ice comes, why it goes.The Snow of Ignorance remains untrodden.Over Drumner in the dark now a great table of dull fire burns.Eps Thanern.The meter reads sixteen miles hauled today, but we are not more than eight miles in a straight line from last night's camp.We are still in the ice pass between the two volcanoes.Drumner is in eruption.Worms of fire crawl down its black sides, seen when wind clears off the roil and seethe of ash cloud and smoke cloud and white steam.Continuously, with no pause, a hissing mutter fills the air, so huge and so long a sound that one cannot hear it when one stops to listen; yet it fills all the interstices of one's being.The glacier trembles perpetually, snaps and crashes, jitters under our feet.All the snowbridges that the blizzard may have laid across crevasses are gone, shaken down, knocked in by this drumming and jumping of the ice and the earth beneath the ice.We go back and forth, seeking the end of a slit in the ice that would swallow the sledge whole, then seeking the end of the next, trying to go north and forced always to go west or east.Above us Dremegole, in sympathy with Drum ner's labor, grumbles and farts foul smoke.Ai's face was badly frostbitten this morning, nose, ears, chin all dead gray when I chanced to look at him.Kneaded him back to life and no damage done, but we must be more careful.The wind that blows down off the Ice is, in simple truth, deadly; and we have to face it as we haul.I shall be glad to get off this slit and wrinkled ice arm between two growling monsters.Mountains should be seen, not heard.Arhad Thanern.Some sove snow, between 15 and 20.We went twelve miles today, about five of them profitable, and the rim of the Gobrin is visibly nearer, north, above us.We now see the ice river to be miles wide: the "arm" between Drumner and Dremegole is only one finger, and we now are on the back of the hand.Turning and looking down from this camp one sees the glacier flow split, divided, torn and churned by the black steaming peaks that thwart it.Looking ahead one sees it broaden, rising and curving slowly, dwarfing the dark ridges of earth, meeting the ice wall far above under veils of cloud and smoke and snow.Cinders and ash now fall with the snow, and the ice is thick with clinkers on it or sunk in it: a good walking surface but rather rough for hauling, and the runners need recoating already.Two or three times volcanic projectiles hit the ice quite near us.They hiss loudly as they strike, and burn themselves a socket in the ice.Cinders patter, falling with the snow.We creep infmitesimally northward through the dirty chaos of a world in the process of making itself.Praise then Creation unfinished!Netherhad Thanern.No snow since morning; overcast and windy, at about 15.The great multiple glacier we are on feeds down into the valley from the west, and we are on its extreme eastern edge.Dremegole and Drumner are now somewhat behind us, though a sharp ridge of Dremegole still rises east of us, almost at eyelevel.We have crept and crawled up to a point where we must choose between following the glacier on its long sweep westward and so up gradually onto the plateau of ice, or climbing the ice cliffs a mile north of tonight's camp, and so saving twenty or thirty miles of hauling, at the cost of risk.Ai favors the risk.There is a frailty about him.He is all unprotected, exposed, vulnerable, even to his sexual organ which he must carry always outside himself; but he is strong, unbelievably strong.I am not sure he can keep hauling any longer than I can, but he can haul harder and faster than I twice as hard.He can lift the sledge at front or rear to ease it over an obstacle.I could not lift and hold that weight, unless I was in dothe.To match his frailty and strength, he has a spirit easy to despair and quick to defiance: a fierce impatient courage.This slow, hard, crawling work we have been doing these days wears him out in body and will, so that if he were one of my race I should think him a coward, but he is anything but that; he has a ready bravery I have never seen the like of.He is ready, eager, to stake life on the cruel quick test of the precipice."Fire and fear, good servants, bad lords. "He makes fear serve him.I would have let fear lead me around by the long way.Courage and reason are with him.What good seeking the safe course, on a journey such as this?There are senseless courses, which I shall not take; but there is no safe one.Streth Thanern.No luck.No way to get the sledge up, though we spent the day at it.Sove snow in flurries, thick ash mixed with it.It was dark all day, as the wind veering around from the west again blew the pall of Drumner's smoke on us.Up here the ice shakes less, but there came a great quake while we tried to climb a shelving cliff; it shook free the sledge where we had wedged it and I was pulled down five or six feet with a bump, but Ai had a good handhold and his strength saved us from all careering down to the foot of the cliff, twenty feet or more.If one of us breaks a leg or shoulder in these exploits, that is probably the end of both of us; there, precisely, is the risk rather an ugly one when looked at closely.The lower valley of the glaciers behind us is white with steam: lava touches ice, down there.We certainly cannot go back.Tomorrow we shall try the ascent farther west.Beren Thanern.No luck.We must go farther west.Dark as late twilight all day.Our lungs are raw, not from cold (it remains well above zero even at night, with this west wind) but from breathing the ash and fumes of the eruption.By the end of this second day of wasted effort, scrabbling and squirming over pressure blocks and up ice cliffs always to be stopped by a sheer face or overhang, trying farther on and failing again, Ai was exhausted and enraged.He looked ready to cry, but did not.I believe he considers crying either evil or shameful.Even when he was very ill and weak, the first days of our escape, he hid his face from me when he wept.Reasons personal, racial, social, sexual how can I guess why Ai must not weep?Yet his name is a cry of pain.For that I first sought him out in Erhenrang, a long time ago it seems now; hearing talk of "an Alien" I asked his name, and heard for answer a cry of pain from a human throat across the night.Now he sleeps.His arms tremble and twitch, muscular fatigue.The world around us, ice and rock, ash and snow, fire and dark, trembles and twitches and mutters.Looking out a minute ago I saw the glow of the volcano as a dull red bloom on the belly of vast clouds overhanging the darkness.Orny Thanern.No luck.This is the twenty second day of our journey, and since the tenth day we have made no progress eastward, indeed have lost twenty or twenty five miles by going west; since the eighteenth day we have made no progress of any kind, and might as well have sat still.If we ever do get up on the Ice, will we have food enough left to take us across it?This thought is hard to dismiss.Fog and murk of the eruption cut seeing very close, so that we cannot choose our path well.Ai wants to attack each ascent, however steep, that shows any sign of shelving.He is impatient with my caution.We have got to watch our tempers.I will be in kemmer in a day or so, and all strains will increase.Meanwhile we butt our heads on cliffs of ice in a cold dusk full of ashes.If I wrote a new Yomesh Canon I should send thieves here after death.Thieves who steal sacks of food by night in Turuf.Thieves who steal a man's hearth and name from him and send him out ashamed and exiled.My head is thick, I must cross out all this stuff later, too tired to reread it now.Harhahad Thanern.On the Gobrin.The twenty third day of our journey.We are on the Gobrin Ice.As soon as we set out this morning we saw, only a few hundred yards beyond last night's camp, a pathway open up to the Ice, a highway curving broad and cinder paved from the rubble and chasms of the glacier right up through the cliffs of ice.We walked up it as if strolling along the Sess Embankment.We are on the Ice.We are headed east again, homeward.I am infected by Ai's pure pleasure in our achievement.Looked at soberly it is as bad as ever, up here.We are on the plateau's rim.Crevasses some wide enough to sink villages in, not house by house but all at once run inland, northward, right out of sight.Most of them cut across our way, so we too must go north, not east.The surface is bad.We screw the sledge along amongst great lumps and chunks of ice, immense debris pushed up by the straining of the great plastic sheet of ice against and among the Fire Hills.The broken pressure ridges take queer shapes, overturned towers, legless giants, catapults.A mile thick to start with, the Ice here rises and thickens, trying to flow over the mountains and choke the fire mouths with silence.Some miles to the north a peak rises up out of the Ice, the sharp graceful barren cone of a young volcano: younger by thousands of years than the ice sheet that grinds and shoves, all shattered into chasms and jammed up into great blocks and ridges, over the six thousand feet of lower slopes we cannot see.During the day, turning, we saw the smoke of Drumner's eruption hang behind us like a gray brown extension of the surface of the Ice.A steady wind blows along at ground level from the northeast, clearing this higher air of the soot and stink of the planet's bowels which we have breathed for days, flattening out the smoke behind us to cover, like a dark lid, the glaciers, the lower mountains, the valleys of stones, the rest of the earth.There is nothing, the Ice says, but Ice.But the young volcano there to northward has another word it thinks of saying.No snowfall, a thin high overcast.4 on the plateau at dusk.A jumble of firn, new ice, and old ice underfoot.The new ice is tricky, slick blue stuff just hidden by a whiteglaze.We have both been down a good deal.I slid fifteen feet on my belly across one such slick.Ai, in harness, doubled up laughing.He apologized and explained he had thought himself the only person on Gethen who ever slipped on ice.Thirteen miles today; but if we try to keep up such a pace among these cut, heaped, crevassed pressure ridges we shall wear ourselves out or come to worse grief than a bellyslide.The waxing moon is low, dull as dry blood; a great brownish, iridescent halo surrounds it.Guyrny Thanern.Some snow, rising wind and falling temperature.Thirteen miles again today, which brings our distance logged since we left our first camp to 254 miles.We have averaged about ten and a half miles a day; eleven and a half omitting the two days spent waiting out the blizzard.75 to 100 of those miles of hauling gave us no onward gain.We are not much nearer Karhide than we were when we set out.But we stand a better chance, I think, of getting there.Since we came up out of the volcano murk our spirit is not all spent in work and worry, and we talk again in the tent after our dinner.As I am in kemmer I would find it easier to ignore Ai's presence, but this is difficult in a two man tent.The trouble is of course that he is, in his curious fashion, also in kemmer: always in kemmer.A strange lowgrade sort of desire it must be, to be spread out over every day of the year and never to know the choice of sex, but there it is; and here am I.  Tonight my extreme physical awareness of him was rather hard to ignore, and I was too tired to divert it into untrance or any other channel of the discipline.Finally he asked, had he offended me?I explained my silence, with some embarrassment.I was afraid he would laugh at me.After all he is no more an oddity, a sexual freak, than I am: up here on the Ice each of us is singular, isolate, I as cut off from those like me, from my society and its rules, as he from his.There is no world full of other Gethenians here to explain and support my existence.We are equals at last, equal, alien, alone.He did not laugh, of course.Rather he spoke with a gentleness that I did not know was in him.After a while he too came to speak of isolation, of loneliness."Your race is appallingly alone in its world.No other mammalian species.No other ambisexual species.No animal intelligent enough even to domesticate as pets.It must color your thinking, this uniqueness.I don't mean scientific thinking only, though you are extraordinary hypothesizers it's extraordinary that you arrived at any concept of evolution, faced with that unbridgeable gap between yourselves and the lower animals.But philosophically, emotionally: to be so solitary, in so hostile a world: it must affect your entire outlook. ""The Yomeshta would say that man's singularity is his divinity. ""Lords of the Earth, yes.Other cults on other worlds have come to the same conclusion.They tend to be the cults of dynamic, aggressive, ecology breaking cultures.Orgoreyn is in the pattern, in its way; at least they seem bent on pushing things around.What do the Handdarata say?""Well, in the Handdara ...you know, there's no theory, no dogma...Maybe they are less aware of the gap between men and beasts, being more occupied with the likenesses, the links, the whole of which living things are a part. "Tormer's Lay had been all day in my mind, and I said the words, Light is the left hand of darkness and darkness the right hand of light.Two are one, life and death, lying together like lovers in kemmer, like hands joined together, like the end and the way.My voice shook as I said the lines, for I remembered as I said them that in the letter my brother wrote me before his death he had quoted the same words.Ai brooded, and after some time he said, "You're isolated, and undivided.Perhaps you are as obsessed with wholeness as we are with dualism. ""We are dualists too.Duality is an essential, isn't it?So long as there ismyself andthe other. ""I and Thou," he said."Yes, it does, after all, go even wider than sex... ""Tell me, how does the other sex of your race differ from yours?"He looked startled and in fact my question rather startled me; kemmer brings out these spontaneities in one.We were both self conscious."I never thought of that," he said."You've never seen a woman. "He used his Terran language word, which I knew."I saw your pictures of them.The women looked like pregnant Gethenians, but with larger breasts.Do they differ much from your sex in mind behavior?Are they like a different species?""No.Yes.No, of course not, not really.But the difference is very important.I suppose the most important thing, the heaviest single factor in one's life, is whether one's born male or female.In most societies it determines one's expectations, activities, outlook, ethics, manners almost everything.Vocabulary.Semiotic usages.Clothing.Even food.Women...women tend to eat less...It's extremely hard to separate the innate differences from the learned ones.Even where women participate equally with men in the society, they still after all do all the childbearing, and so most of the child rearing...  ""Equality is not the general rule, then?Are they mentally inferior?""I don't know.They don't often seem to turn up mathematicians, or composers of music, or inventors, or abstract thinkers.But it isn't that they're stupid.Physically they're less muscular, but a little more durable than men.Psychologically "  After he had stared a long time at the glowing stove, he shook his head."Harth," he said, "I can't tell you what women are like.I never thought about it much in the abstract, you know, and God!by now I've practically forgotten.I've been here two years...You don't know.In a sense, women are more alien to me than you are.With you I share one sex, anyhow... "He looked away and laughed, rueful and uneasy.My own feelings were complex, and we let the matter drop.Yrny Thanern.Eighteen miles today, east northeast by compass, on skis.We got clear of the pressure ridges and crevasses in the first hour of pulling.Both got in harness, I ahead at first with the probe, but no more need for testing: the firn is a couple of feet thick over solid ice, and on the firn lie several inches of sound new snow from the last fall, with a good surface.Neither we nor the sledge broke through at all, and the sledge pulled so light that it was hard to believe we are still hauling about a hundred pounds apiece.During the afternoon we took turns hauling, as one can do it easily on this splendid surface.It is a pity that all the hard work uphill and over rock came while the load was heavy.Now we go light.Too light: I find myself thinking about food a good deal.We eat, Ai says, ethereally.All day we went light and fast over the level ice plain, dead white under a gray blue sky, unbroken except for the few black nuna tak peaks now far behind us, and a smudge of darkness, Drumner's breath, behind them.Nothing else: the veiled sun, the ice.17.An Orgota Creation Myth  The origins of this myth are prehistorical; it has been recorded in many forms.This very primitive version is from a pre Yomesh written text found in the Isenpeth Cave Shrine of the Gobrin Hinterlands.IN THEbeginning there was nothing but ice and the sun.Over many years the sun shining melted a great crevasse in the ice.In the sides of this crevasse were great shapes of ice, and there was no bottom to it.Drops of water melted from the ice shapes in the sides of the chasm and fell down and down.One of the ice shapes said, "I bleed. "Another of the ice shapes said, "I weep. "A third one said, "I sweat. "The ice shapes climbed up out of the abyss and stood on the plain of ice.He that said "I bleed," he reached up to the sun and pulled out handfuls of excrement from the bowels of the sun, and with that dung made the hills and valleys of the earth.He that said "I weep," he breathed on the ice and melting it made the seas and the rivers.He that said "I sweat," he gathered up soil and seawater and with them made trees, plants, herbs and grains of the field, animals, and men.The plants grew in the soil and the sea, the beasts ran on the land and swam in the sea, but the men did not wake.Thirty nine of them there were.They slept on the ice and would not move.Then the three ice shapes stooped down and sat with their knees drawn up and let the sun melt them.As milk they melted, and the milk ran into the mouths of the sleepers, and the sleepers woke.That milk is drunk by the children of men alone and without it they will not wake to life.The first to wake up was Edondurath.So tall was he that when he stood up his head split the sky, and snow fell down.He saw the others stirring and awakening, and was afraid of them when they moved, so he killed one after another with a blow of his fist.Thirty six of them he killed.But one of them, the next to last one, ran away.Haharath he was called.Far he ran over the plain of ice and over the lands of earth.Edondurath ran behind him and caught up with him at last and smote him.Haharath died.Then Edondurath returned to the Birthplace on the Gobrin Ice where the bodies of the others lay, but the last one was gone: he had escaped while Edondurath pursued Haharath.Edondurath built a house of the frozen bodies of his brothers, and waited there inside that house for that last one to come back.Each day one of the corpses would speak, saying, "Does he burn?Does he burn?"All the other corpses would say with frozen tongues, "No, no. "Then Edondurath entered kemmer as he slept, and moved and spoke aloud in dreams, and when he woke the corpses were all saying, "He burns!He burns!"And the last brother, the youngest one, heard them saying that, and came into the house of bodies and there coupled with Edondurath.Of these two were the nations of men born, out of the flesh of Edondurath, out of Edondurath's womb.The name of the other, the younger brother, the father, his name is not known.Each of the children born to them had a piece of darkness that followed him about wherever he went by daylight.Edondurath said, "Why are my sons followed thus by darkness?"His kemmering said, "Because they were born in the house of flesh, therefore death follows at their heels.They are in the middle of time.In the beginning there was the sun and the ice, and there was no shadow.In the end when we are done, the sun will devour itself and shadow will eat light, and there will be nothing left but the ice and the darkness. "18.On the Ice  SOMETIMESas I am falling asleep in a dark, quiet room I have for a moment a great and treasurable illusion of the past.The wall of a tent leans up over my face, not visible but audible, a slanting plane of faint sound: the susurrus of blown snow.Nothing can be seen.The light emission of the Chabe stove is cut off, and it exists only as a sphere of heat, a heart of warmth.The faint dampness and confining cling of my sleeping bag; the sound of the snow; barely audible, Estraven's breathing as he sleeps; darkness.Nothing else.We are inside, the two of us, in shelter, at rest, at the center of all things.Outside, as always, lies the great darkness, the cold, death's solitude.In such fortunate moments as I fall asleep I know beyond doubt what the real center of my own life is, that time which is past and lost and yet is permanent, the enduring moment, the heart of warmth.I am not trying to say that I was happy, during those weeks of hauling a sledge across an ice sheet in the dead of winter.I was hungry, overstrained, and often anxious, and it all got worse the longer it went on.I certainly wasn't happy.Happiness has to do with reason, and only reason earns it.What I was given was the thing you can't earn, and can't keep, and often don't even recognize at the time; I mean joy.I always woke up first, usually before daylight.My metabolic rate is slightly over the Gethenian norm, as are my height and weight; Estraven had figured these differences into the food ration calculations, in his scrupulous way which one could see as either housewifely or scientific, and from the start I had had a couple of ounces more food per day than he.Protests of injustice fell silent before the self evident justice of this unequal division.However divided, the share was small.I was hungry, constantly hungry, daily hungrier.I woke up because I was hungry.If it was still dark I turned up the light of the Chabe stove, and put a pan of ice brought in the night before, now thawed, on the stove to boil.Estraven meanwhile engaged in his customary fierce and silent struggle with sleep, as if he wrestled with an angel.Winning, he sat up, stared at me vaguely, shook his head, and woke.By the time we were dressed and booted and had the bags rolled up, breakfast was ready: a mug of boiling hot orsh, and one cube of gichy michy expanded by hot water into a sort of small, doughy bun.We chewed slowly, solemnly, retrieving all dropped crumbs.The stove cooled as we ate.We packed it up with the pan and mugs, pulled on our hooded overcoats and our mittens, and crawled out into the open air.The coldness of it was perpetually incredible.Every morning I had to believe it all over again.If one had been outside to relieve oneself already, the second exit was only harder.Sometimes it was snowing; sometimes the long light of early day lay wonderfully gold and blue across the miles of ice; most often it was gray.We brought the thermometer into the tent with us, nights, and when we took it outside it was interesting to watch the pointer swing to the right (Gethenian dials read counterclockwise) almost too fast to follow, registering a drop of twenty, fifty, eighty degrees, till it stopped somewhere between zero and 60.One of us collapsed the tent and folded it while the other loaded stove, bags, etc.onto the sledge; the tent was strapped over all, and we were ready for skis and harness.Little metal was used in our straps and fittings, but the harnesses had buckles of aluminum alloy, too fine to fasten with mittens on, which burned in that cold exactly as if they were redhot.I had to be very careful of my fingers when the temperature was below minus twenty, especially if the wind blew, for I could pick up a frostbite amazingly fast.My feet never suffered and that is a factor of major importance, in a winter journey where an hour's exposure can, after all, cripple one for a week or for life.Estraven had had to guess my size and the snowboots he got me were a little large, but extra socks filled the discrepancy.We put on our skis, got into harness as quick as possible, bucked and pried and jolted the sledge free if its runners were frozen in, and set off.Mornings after heavy snowfall we might have to spend some while digging out the tent and sledge before we could set off.The new snow was not hard to shovel away, though it made great impressive drifts around us, who were, after all, the only impediment for hundreds of miles, the only thing sticking out above the ice.We pulled eastward by the compass.The usual direction of the wind was north to south, off the glacier.Day after day it blew from our left as we went.The hood did not suffice against that wind, and I wore a facial mask to protect my nose and left cheek.Even so my left eye froze shut one day, and I thought I had lost the use of it: even when Estraven thawed it open with breath and tongue, I could not see with it for some while, so probably more had been frozen than the lashes.In sunlight both of us wore the Gethenian slit screen eyeshields, and neither of us suffered any snow blindness.We had small opportunity.The Ice, as Estraven had said, tends to hold a high pressure zone above its central area, where thousands of square miles of white reflect the sunlight.We were not in this central zone, however, but at best on the edge of it, between it and the zone of turbulent, deflected, precipitation laden storms that it sends continually to torment the subglacial lands.Wind from due north brought bare, bright weather, but from northeast or northwest it brought snow, or harrowed up dry fallen snow into blinding, biting clouds like sand or dust storms, or else, sinking almost to nothing, crept in sinuous trails along the surface, leaving the sky white, the air white, no visible sun, no shadow: and the snow itself, the Ice, disappeared from under our feet.Around midday we would halt, and cut and set up a few blocks of ice for a protective wall if the wind was strong.We heated water to soak a cube of gichy michy in, and drank the water hot, sometimes with a bit of sugar melted in it; harnessed up again and went on.We seldom talked while on the march or at lunch, for our lips were sore, and when one's mouth was open the cold got inside, hurting teeth and throat and lungs; it was necessary to keep the mouth closed and breathe through the nose, at least when the air was forty or fifty degrees below freezing.When it went on lower than that, the whole breathing process was further complicated by the rapid freezing of one's exhaled breath; if you didn't look out your nostrils might freeze shut, and then to keep from suffocating you would gasp in a lungful of razors.Under certain conditions our exhalations freezing instantly made a tiny crackling noise, like distant firecrackers, and a shower of crystals: each breath a snowstorm.We pulled till we were tired out or till it began to grow dark, halted, set up the tent, pegged down the sledge if there was threat of high wind, and settled in for the night.On a usual day we would have pulled for eleven or twelve hours, and made between twelve and eighteen miles.It does not seem a very good rate, but then conditions were a bit adverse.The crust of the snow was seldom right for both skis and sledge runners.When it was light and new the sledge ran through rather than over it; when it was partly hardened, the sledge would stick but we on skis would not, which meant that we were perpetually being pulled up backward with a jolt; and when it was hard it was often heaped up in long wind waves,sastrugi, that in some places ran up to four feet high.We had to haul the sledge up and over each knife edged or fantastically corniced top, then slide her down, and up over the next one: for they never seemed to run parallel to our course.I had imagined the Gobrin Ice Plateau to be all one sheet like a frozen pond, but there were hundreds of miles of it that were rather like an abruptly frozen, storm raised sea.The business of setting up camp, making everything secure, getting all the clinging snow off one's outer clothing, and so on, was trying.Sometimes it did not seem worthwhile.It was so late, so cold, one was so tired, that it would be much easier to lie down in a sleeping bag in the lee of the sledge and not bother with the tent.I remember how clear this was to me on certain evenings, and how bitterly I resented my companion's methodical, tyrannical insistence that we do everything and do it correctly and thoroughly.I hated him at such times, with a hatred that rose straight up out of the death that lay within my spirit.I hated the harsh, intricate, obstinate demands that he made on me in the name of life.When all was done we could enter the tent, and almost at once the heat of the Chabe stove could be felt as an enveloping, protecting ambiance.A marvelous thing surrounded us: warmth.Death and cold were elsewhere, outside.Hatred was also left outside.We ate and drank.After we ate, we talked.When the cold was extreme, even the excellent insulation of the tent could not keep it out, and we lay in our bags as close to the stove as possible.A little fur of frost gathered on the inner surface of the tent.To open the valve was to let in a draft of cold that instantly condensed, filling the tent with a swirling mist of fine snow.When there was blizzard, needles of icy air blew in through the vents, elaborately protected as they were, and an impalpable dust of snow motes fogged the air.On those nights the storm made an incredible noise, and we could not converse by voice, unless we shouted with our heads together.On other nights it was still, with such a stillness as one imagines as existing before the stars began to form, or after everything has perished.Within an hour after our evening meal Estraven turned the stove down, if it was feasible to do so, and turned the light emission off.
