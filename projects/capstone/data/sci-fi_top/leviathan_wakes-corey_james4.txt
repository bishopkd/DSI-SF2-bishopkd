Muss leaned against his desk, waiting for him.Her arms were crossed, her eyes as bored looking at him as they had been looking at the corpse of Dos Santos pinned to the corridor wall.New asshole?she asked.Yeah.Itll grow closed.Give it time.I got us one of the murders.Mid level accountant for Naobi Shears got his head blown off outside a bar.It looked fun.Miller pulled up his hand terminal and took in the basics.His heart wasnt in it.Hey, Muss, he said.I got a question.Fire away.Youve got a case you dont want solved.What do you do?His new partner frowned, tilted her head, and shrugged.I hand it to a fish, she said.There was a guy back in crimes against children.If we knew the perp was one of our informants, wed always give it to him.None of our guys ever got in trouble.Yeah, Miller said.For that matter, I need someone to take the shitty partner, I do the same thing, Muss went on.You know.Someone no one else wants to work with?Got bad breath or a shitty personality or whatever, but he needs a partner.So I pick the guy who maybe he used to be good, but then he got a divorce.Started hitting the bottle.Guy still thinks hes a hotshot.Acts like it.Only his numbers arent better than anyone elses.Give him the shit cases.The shit partner.Miller closed his eyes.His stomach felt uneasy.What did you do?he asked.To get assigned to you?Muss said.One of the seniors made the moves on me and I shot him down.So you got stuck.Pretty much.Come on, Miller.You arent stupid, Muss said.You had to know.Hed had to know that he was the station house joke.The guy who used to be good.The one whod lost it.No, actually he hadnt known that.He opened his eyes.Muss didnt look happy or sad, pleased at his pain or particularly distressed by it.It was just work to her.The dead, the wounded, the injured.She didnt care.Not caring was how she got through the day.Maybe you shouldnt have turned him down, Miller said.Ah, youre not that bad, Muss said.And he had back hair.I hate back hair.Glad to hear it, Miller said.Lets go make some justice.* * *   Youre drunk, the asshole said.M a cop, Miller said, stabbing the air with his finger.Dont fuck with me.I know youre a cop.Youve been coming to my bar for three years.Its me.Hasini.And youre drunk, my friend.Seriously, dangerously drunk.Miller looked around him.He was indeed at the Blue Frog.He didnt remember having come here, and yet here he was.And the asshole was Hasini after all.I  Miller began, then lost his train of thought.Come on, Hasini said, looping an arm around him.Its not that far.Ill get you home.What time is it?Miller asked.Late.The word had a depth to it.Late.It was late.All the chances to make things right had somehow passed him.The system was at war, and no one was even sure why.Miller himself was turning fifty years old the next June.It was late.Late to start again.Late to realize how many years hed spent running down the wrong road.Hasini steered him toward an electric cart the bar kept for occasions like this one.The smell of hot grease came out of the kitchen.Hold on, Miller said.You going to puke?Hasini asked.Miller considered for a moment.No, it was too late to puke.He stumbled forward.Hasini laid him back in the cart and engaged the motors, and with a whine they steered out into the corridor.The lights high above them were dimmed.The cart vibrated as they passed intersection after intersection.Or maybe it didnt.Maybe that was just his body.I thought I was good, he said.You know, all this time, I thought I was at least good.You do fine, Hasini said.Youve just got a shitty job.That I was good at.You do fine, Hasini repeated, as if saying it would make it true.Miller lay on the bed of the cart.The formed plastic arch of the wheel well dug into his side.It ached, but moving was too much effort.Thinking was too much effort.Hed made it through his day, Muss at his side.Hed turned in the data and materials on Julie.He had nothing worth going back to his hole for, and no place else to be.The lights shifted into and out of his field of view.He wondered if that was what it would be like to look at stars.Hed never looked up at a sky.The thought inspired a certain vertigo.A sense of terror of the infinite that was almost pleasant.There anyone who can take care of you?Hasini said when they reached Millers hole.Ill be fine.I just I had a bad day.Julie, Hasini said, nodding.How do you know about Julie?Miller asked.Youve been talking about her all night, Hasini said.Shes a girl you fell for, right?Frowning, Miller kept a hand on the cart.Julie.Hed been talking about Julie.That was what this was about.Not his job.Not his reputation.Theyd taken away Julie.The special case.The one that mattered.Youre in love with her, Hasini said.Yeah, sort of, Miller said, something like revelation forcing its way through the alcohol.I think I am.Too bad for you, Hasini said.The Tachis galley had a full kitchen and a table with room for twelve.It also had a full size coffeepot that could brew forty cups of coffee in less than five minutes whether the ship was in zero g or under a five g burn.Holden said a silent prayer of thanks for bloated military budgets and pressed the brew button.He had to restrain himself from stroking the stainless steel cover while it made gentle percolating noises.The aroma of coffee began to fill the air, competing with the baking bread smell of whatever Alex had put in the oven.Amos was thumping around the table in his new cast, laying out plastic plates and actual honest to god metal silverware.In a bowl Naomi was mixing something that had the garlic scent of good hummus.Watching the crew work at these domestic tasks, Holden had a sense of peace and safety deep enough to leave him light headed.Theyd been on the run for weeks now, pursued the entire time by one mysterious ship or another.For the first time since the Canterbury was destroyed, no one knew where they were.No one was demanding anything of them.As far as the solar system was concerned, they were a few casualties out of thousands on the Donnager.A brief vision of Sheds head disappearing like a grisly magic trick reminded him that at least one of his crew was a casualty.And still, it felt so good to once again be master of his own destiny that even regret couldnt entirely rob him of it.A timer rang, and Alex pulled out a tray covered with thin, flat bread.He began cutting it into slices, onto which Naomi slathered a paste that did in fact look like hummus.Amos put them on the plates around the table.Holden drew fresh coffee into mugs that had the ships name on the side.He passed them around.There was an awkward moment when everyone stared at the neatly set table without moving, as if afraid to destroy the perfection of the scene.Amos solved this by saying, Im hungry as a fucking bear, and then sitting down with a thump.Somebody pass me that pepper, wouldja?For several minutes, no one spoke; they only ate.Holden took a small bite of the flat bread and hummus, the strong flavors making him dizzy after weeks of tasteless protein bars.Then he was stuffing it into his mouth so fast it made his salivary glands flare with exquisite agony.He looked around the table, embarrassed, but everyone else was eating just as fast, so he gave up on propriety and concentrated on food.When hed finished off the last scraps from his plate, he leaned back with a sigh, hoping to make the contentment last as long as possible.Alex sipped coffee with his eyes closed.Amos ate the last bits of the hummus right out of the serving bowl with his spoon.Naomi gave Holden a sleepy look through half lidded eyes that was suddenly sexy as hell.Holden quashed that thought and raised his mug.To Kellys marines.Heroes to the last, may they rest in peace, he said.To the marines, everyone at the table echoed, then clinked mugs and drank.Alex raised his mug and said, To Shed.Yeah, to Shed, and to the assholes who killed him roasting in hell, Amos said in a quiet voice.Right beside the fucker who killed the Cant.The mood at the table got somber.Holden felt the peaceful moment slipping away as quietly as it had come.So, he said.Tell me about our new ship.Alex?Shes a beaut, Cap.I ran her at twelve g for most of half an hour when we left the Donnie, and she purred like a kitten the whole time.The pilots chair is comfy too.Holden nodded.Amos?Get a chance to look at her engine room yet?he asked.Yep.Clean as a whistle.This is going to be a boring gig for a grease monkey like me, the mechanic replied.Boring would be nice, Holden said.Naomi?What do you think?She smiled.I love it.Its got the nicest showers Ive ever seen on a ship this size.Plus, theres a truly amazing medical bay with a computerized expert system that knows how to fix broken marines.We should have found it rather than fix Amos on our own.Amos thumped his cast with one knuckle.You guys did a good job, Boss.Holden looked around at his clean crew and ran a hand through his own hair, not pulling it away covered in grease for the first time in weeks.Yeah, a shower and not having to fix broken legs sounds good.Anything else?Naomi tilted her head back, her eyes moving as though she was running through a mental checklist.Weve got a full tank of water, the injectors have enough fuel pellets to run the reactor for about thirty years, and the galley is fully stocked.Youll have to tie me up if you plan to give her back to the navy.I love her.She is a cunning little boat, Holden said with a smile.Have a chance to look at the weapons?Two tubes and twenty long range torpedoes with high yield plasma warheads, Naomi said.Or at least thats what the manifest says.They load those from the outside, so I cant physically verify without climbing around on the hull.The weapons panel is sayin the same thing, Cap, Alex said.And full loads in all the point defense cannons.You know, except   Except the burst you fired into the men who killed Gomez.Oh, and, Captain, when we put Kelly in the cargo hold, I found a big crate with the letters map on the side.According to the manifest, it stands for Mobile Assault Package.Apparently navy speak for a big box of guns, Naomi said.Yeah, Alex said.Its full kit for eight marines.Okay, Holden said.So with the fleet quality Epstein, weve got legs.And if you guys are right about the weapons load out, weve also got teeth.The next question is what do we do with it?Im inclined to take Colonel Johnsons offer of refuge.Any thoughts?Im all for that, Captain, Amos said.I always did think the Belters were getting the short end of the stick.Ill go be a revolutionary for a while, I guess.Earthmans burden, Amos?Naomi asked with a grin.What the fuck does that even mean?Nothing, just teasing, she said.I know you like our side because you just want to steal our women.Amos grinned back, suddenly in on the joke.Well, you ladies do have the legs that go all the way up, he said.Okay, enough, Holden said, raising his hand.So, two votes for Fred.Anyone else?Naomi raised her hand.I vote for Fred, she said.Alex?What do you think?Holden asked.The Martian pilot leaned back in his chair and scratched his head.I got nowhere in particular to be, so Ill stick with you guys, I guess, he said.But I hope this dont turn into another round of bein told what to do.It wont, Holden replied.I have a ship with guns on it now, and the next time someone orders me to do something, Im using them.* * *   After dinner, Holden took a long, slow tour of his new ship.He opened every door, looked in every closet, turned on every panel, and read every readout.He stood in engineering next to the fusion reactor and closed his eyes, getting used to the almost subliminal vibration she made.If something ever went wrong with it, he wanted to feel it in his bones before any warning ever sounded.He stopped and touched all the tools in the well stocked machine shop, and he climbed up to the personnel deck and wandered through the crew cabins until he found one he liked, and messed up the bed to show it was taken.He found a bunch of jumpsuits in what looked like his size, then moved them to the closet in his new room.He took a second shower and let the hot water massage knots in his back that were three weeks old.As he wandered back to his cabin, he trailed his fingers along the wall, feeling the soft give of the fire retardant foam and anti spalling webbing over the top of the armored steel bulkheads.When he arrived at his cabin, Alex and Amos were both getting settled into theirs.Which cabin did Naomi take?he asked.Amos shrugged.Shes still up in ops, fiddling with something.Holden decided to put off sleep for a while and rode the keel ladder lift we have a lift!up to the operations deck.Naomi was sitting on the floor, an open bulkhead panel in front of her and what looked like a hundred small parts and wires laid out around her in precise patterns.She was staring at something inside the open compartment.Hey, Naomi, you should really get some sleep.What are you working on?She gestured vaguely at the compartment.Transponder, she said.Holden moved over and sat down on the floor next to her.Tell me how to help.She handed him her hand terminal; Freds instructions for changing the transponder signal were open on the screen.Its ready to go.Ive got the console hooked up to the transponders data port just like he says.Ive got the computer program set up to run the override he describes.The new transponder code and ship registry data are ready to be entered.I put in the new name.Did Fred pick it?No, that was me.Oh.All right, then.But  Her voice trailed off, and she waved at the transponder again.Whats the problem?Holden asked.Jim, they make these things not to be fiddled with.The civilian version of this device fuses itself into a solid lump of silicon if it thinks its being tampered with.Who knows what the military version of the fail safe is?Drop the magnetic bottle in the reactor?Turn us into a supernova?Naomi turned to look at him.Ive got it all set up and ready to go, but now I dont think we should throw the switch, she said.We dont know the consequences of failure.Holden got up off the floor and moved over to the computer console.A program Naomi had named Trans01 was waiting to be run.He hesitated for one second, then pressed the button to execute.The ship failed to vaporize.I guess Fred wants us alive, then, he said.Naomi slumped down with a noisy, extended exhale.See, this is why I cant ever be in command, she said.Dont like making tough calls with incomplete information?More Im not suicidally irresponsible, she replied, and began slowly reassembling the transponder housing.Holden punched the comm system on the wall.Well, crew, welcome aboard the gas freighter Rocinante.What does that name even mean?Naomi said after he let go of the comm button.It means we need to go find some windmills, Holden said over his shoulder as he headed to the lift.* * *   Tycho Manufacturing and Engineering Concern was one of the first major corporations to move into the Belt.In the early days of expansion, Tycho engineers and a fleet of ships had captured a small comet and parked it in stable orbit as a water resupply point decades before ships like the Canterbury began bringing ice in from the nearly limitless fields in Saturns rings.It had been the most complex, difficult feat of mass scale engineering humanity had ever accomplished until the next thing they did.As an encore, Tycho had built the massive reaction drives into the rock of Ceres and Eros and spent more than a decade teaching the asteroids to spin.They had been slated to create a network of high atmosphere floating cities above Venus before the development rights fell into a labyrinth of lawsuits now entering its eighth decade.There was some discussion of space elevators for Mars and Earth, but nothing solid had come of it yet.If you had an impossible engineering job that needed to be done in the Belt, and you could afford it, you hired Tycho.Tycho Station, the Belt headquarters of the company, was a massive ring station built around a sphere half a kilometer across, with more than sixty five million cubic meters of manufacturing and storage space inside.The two counter rotating habitation rings that circled the sphere had enough space for fifteen thousand workers and their families.The top of the manufacturing sphere was festooned with half a dozen massive construction waldoes that looked like they could rip a heavy freighter in half.The bottom of the sphere had a bulbous projection fifty meters across, which housed a capital ship class fusion reactor and drive system, making Tycho Station the largest mobile construction platform in the solar system.Each compartment within the massive rings was built on a swivel system that allowed the chambers to reorient to thrust gravity when the rings stopped spinning and the station flew to its next work location.Holden knew all this, and his first sight of the station still took his breath away.It wasnt just the size of it.It was the idea that four generations of the smartest people in the solar system had been living and working here as they helped drag humanity into the outer planets almost through sheer force of will.Amos said, It looks like a big bug.Holden started to protest, but it did resemble some kind of giant spider: fat bulbous body and all its legs sprouting from the top of its head.Alex said, Forget the station, look at that monster.The vessel it was constructing dwarfed the station.Ladar returns told Holden the ship was just over two kilometers long and half a kilometer wide.Round and stubby, it looked like a cigarette butt made of steel.Framework girders exposed internal compartments and machinery at various stages of construction, but the engines looked complete, and the hull had been assembled over the bow.The name Nauvoo was painted in massive white letters across it.So the Mormons are going to ride that thing all the way to Tau Ceti, huh?Amos asked, following it up with a long whistle.Ballsy bastards.No guarantee theres even a planet worth a damn on the other end of that hundred year trip.They seem pretty sure, Holden replied.And you dont make the money to build a ship like that by being stupid.I, for one, wish them nothing but luck.Theyll get the stars, Naomi said.How can you not envy them that?Their great grandkidsll get maybe a star if they dont all starve to death orbiting a rock they cant use, Amos said.Lets not get grandiose here.He pointed at the impressively large comm array jutting from the Nauvoos flank.Want to bet thats what threw our anus sized tightbeam message?Amos said.Alex nodded.If you want to send private messages home from a couple light years away, you need serious beam coherence.They probably had the volume turned down to avoid cuttin a hole in us.Holden got up from the copilots couch and pushed past Amos.Alex, see if theyll let us land.* * *   Landing was surprisingly easy.The station control directed them to a docking port on the side of the sphere and stayed on the line, guiding them in, until Alex had married the docking tube to the airlock door.The tower control never pointed out that they had a lot of armaments for a transport and no tanks for carrying compressed gas.She got them docked, then wished them a pleasant day.Holden put on his atmosphere suit and made a quick trip to the cargo bay, then met the others just inside the Rocinantes inner airlock door with a large duffel.Put your suits on, thats now standard ops for this crew anytime we go someplace new.And take one of these, he said, pulling handguns and cartridge magazines from the bag.Hide it in a pocket or your bag if you like, but I will be wearing mine openly.Naomi frowned at him.Seems a bit confrontational, doesnt it?Im tired of being kicked around, Holden said.The Rocis a good start toward independence, and Im taking a little piece of her with me.Call it a good luck charm.Fuckin A, said Amos, and strapped one of the guns to his thigh.Alex stuffed his into the pocket of his flight suit.Naomi wrinkled her nose and waved off the last gun.Holden put it back into his duffel, led the crew into the Rocinantes airlock, and cycled it.An older, dark skinned man with a heavy build waited for them on the other side.As they came in, he smiled.Welcome to Tycho Station, said the Butcher of Anderson Station.Call me Fred.The death of the Donnager hit Ceres like a hammer striking a gong.Newsfeeds clogged themselves with high power telescopic footage of the battle, most if not all of it faked.The Belt chatter swam with speculation about a secret OPA fleet.The six ships that had taken down the Martian flagship were hailed as heroes and martyrs.Slogans like We did it once and we can do it again and Drop some rocks cropped up even in apparently innocuous settings.The Canterbury had stripped away the complacency of the Belt, but the Donnager had done something worse.It had taken away the fear.The Belters had gotten a sudden, decisive, and unexpected win.Anything seemed possible, and the hope seduced them.It would have scared Miller more if hed been sober.Millers alarm had been going off for the past ten minutes.The grating buzz took on subtones and overtones when he listened to it long enough.A constant rising tone, fluttering percussion throbbing under it, even soft music hiding underneath the blare.Illusions.Aural hallucinations.The voice of the whirlwind.The previous nights bottle of fungal faux bourbon sat on the bedside table where a carafe of water usually waited.It still had a couple fingers at the bottom.Miller considered the soft brown of the liquid, thought about how it would feel on his tongue.The beautiful thing about losing your illusions, he thought, was that you got to stop pretending.All the years hed told himself that he was respected, that he was good at his job, that all his sacrifices had been made for a reason fell away and left him with the clear, unmuddied knowledge that he was a functional alcoholic who had pared away everything good in his own life to make room for anesthetic.Shaddid thought he was a joke.Muss thought he was the price she paid not to sleep with someone she didnt like.The only one who might have any respect for him at all was Havelock, an Earther.It was peaceful, in its way.He could stop making the effort to keep up appearances.If he stayed in bed listening to the alarm drone, he was just living up to expectations.No shame in that.And still there was work to be done.He reached over and turned off the alarm.Just before it cut off, he heard a voice in it, soft but insistent.A womans voice.He didnt know what shed been saying.But since she was just in his head, shed get another chance later.He levered himself out of bed, sucked down some painkillers and rehydration goo, stalked to the shower, and burned a day and a halfs ration of hot water just standing there, watching his legs get pink.He dressed in his last set of clean clothes.Breakfast was a bar of pressed yeast and grape sweetener.He dropped the bourbon from the bedside table into the recycler without finishing it, just to prove to himself that he still could.Muss was waiting at the desk.She looked up when he sat.Still waiting for the labs on the rape up on eighteen, she said.They promised them by lunch.Well see, Miller said.Ive got a possible witness.Girl who was with the vic earlier in the evening.Her deposition said she left before anything happened, but the security cameras arent backing her up.Want me in the questioning?Miller asked.Not yet.But if I need some theater, Ill pull you in.Fair enough.Miller didnt watch her walk away.After a long moment staring at nothing, he pulled up his disk partition, reviewed what still needed doing, and started cleaning the place up.As he worked, his mind replayed for the millionth time the slow, humiliating interview with Shaddid and Dawes.We have Holden, Dawes said.You cant even find what happened to your own riot gear.Miller poked at the words like a tongue at the gap of a missing tooth.It rang true.Again.Still, it might have been bullshit.It might have been a story concocted just to make him feel small.There wasnt any proof, after all, that Holden and his crew had survived.What proof could there be?The Donnanger was gone, and all its logs along with it.There would have to have been a ship that made it out.Either a rescue vessel or one of the Martian escort ships.There was no way a ship could have gotten out and not been the singular darling of every newsfeed and pirate cast since.You couldnt keep something like that quiet.Or sure you could.It just wouldnt be easy.He squinted at the empty air of the station house.Now.How would you cover up a surviving ship?Miller pulled up a cheap navigation plotter hed bought five years before transit times had figured in a smuggling case and plotted the date and position of the Donnagers demise.Anything running under non Epstein thrust would still have been out there, and Martian warships would have either picked it up or blasted it into background radiation by now.So if Dawes wasnt just handing him bullshit, that meant an Epstein drive.He ran a couple quick calculations.With a good drive, someone could have made Ceres in just less than a month.Call it three weeks to be safe.He looked at the data for almost ten minutes, but the next step didnt come to him, so he stepped away, got some coffee, and pulled up the interview he and Muss had done with a Belter ground crew grunt.The mans face was long and cadaverous and subtly cruel.The recorder hadnt had a good fix on him, so the picture kept bouncing around.Muss asked the man what hed seen, and Miller leaned forward to read the transcribed answers, checking for incorrectly recognized words.Thirty seconds later, the grunt said clip whore and the transcript read clipper.Miller corrected it, but the back of his mind kept churning.Probably eight or nine hundred ships came into Ceres in a given day.Call it a thousand to be safe.Give it a couple days on either side of the three week mark, that was only four thousand entries.Pain in the ass, sure, but not impossible.Ganymede would be the other real bitch.With its agriculture, there would be hundreds of transports a day there.Still, it wouldnt double the workload.Eros.Tycho.Pallas.How many ships docked on Pallas every day?Hed missed almost two minutes of the recording.He started again, forcing himself to pay attention this time, and half an hour later, he gave up.The ten busiest ports with two days to either side of an estimated arrival of an Epstein drive ship that originated when and where the Donnager died totaled twenty eight thousand docking records, more or less.But he could cut that down to seventeen thousand if he excluded stations and ports explicitly run by Martian military and research stations with all or nearly all inner planets inhabitants.So how long would it take him to check all the porting records by hand, pretending for a minute that he was stupid enough to do it?Call it 118 days if he didnt eat or sleep.Just working ten hour days, doing nothing else, he could almost get through it in less than a year.A little less.Except no.Because there were ways to narrow it.He was only looking for Epstein drive ships.Most of the traffic at any of the ports would be local.Torch drive ships flown by prospectors and short hop couriers.The economics of spaceflight made relatively few and relatively large ships the right answer for long flights.So take it down by, conservatively, three quarters, and he was back in the close to four thousand range again.Still hundreds of hours of work, but if he could think of some other filter that would just feed him the likely suspects For instance, if the ship couldnt have filed a flight plan before the Donnager got killed.The request interface for the port logs was ancient, uncomfortable, and subtly different from Eros to Ganymede to Pallas and on and on.Miller tacked the information requests on to seven different cases, including a month old cold case on which he was only a consultant.Port logs were public and open, so he didnt particularly need his detective status to hide his actions.With any luck Shaddids monitoring of him wouldnt extend to low level, public record poking around.And even if it did, he might get the replies before she caught on.Never knew if you had any luck left unless you pushed it.Besides, there wasnt a lot to lose.When the connection from the lab opened on his terminal, he almost jumped.The technician was a gray haired woman with an unnaturally young face.Miller?Muss with you?Nope, Miller said.Shes got an interrogation.He was pretty sure that was what shed said.The tech shrugged.Well, her systems not answering.I wanted to tell you we got a match off the rape you sent us.It wasnt the boyfriend.Her boss did it.Miller nodded.You put in for the warrant?he asked.Yep, she said.Its already in the file.Miller pulled it up: STAR HELIX ON BEHALF OF CERES STATION AUTHORIZES AND MANDATES THE DETENTION OF IMMANUEL CORVUS DOWD PENDING ADJUDICATION OF SECURITY INCIDENT CCS 4949231.The judges digital signature was listed in green.He felt a slow smile on his lips.Thanks, he said.On the way out of the station, one of the vice squads asked him where he was headed.He said lunch.The Arranha Accountancy Group had their offices in the nice part of the governmental quarter in sector seven.It wasnt Millers usual stomping grounds, but the warrant was good on the whole station.Miller went to the secretary at the front desk a good looking Belter with a starburst pattern embroidered on his vest and explained that he needed to speak with Immanuel Corvus Dowd.The secretarys deep brown skin took on an ashy tone.Miller stood back, not blocking the exit, but keeping close.Twenty minutes later, an older man in a good suit came through the front door, stopped in front of Miller, and looked him up and down.Detective Miller?the man said.Youd be Dowds lawyer, Miller said cheerfully.I am, and I would like to   Really, Miller said.We should do this now.The office was clean and spare with light blue walls that lit themselves from within.Dowd sat at the table.He was young enough that he still looked arrogant, but old enough to be scared.Miller nodded to him.Youre Immanuel Corvus Dowd?he said.Before you continue, Detective, the lawyer said, my client is involved with very high level negotiations.His client base includes some of the most important people in the war effort.Before you make any accusations, you should be aware that I can and will have everything youve done reviewed, and if there is one mistake, you will be held responsible.Mr.Dowd, Miller said.What I am about to do to you is literally the only bright spot in my day.If you could see your way clear to resisting arrest, Id really appreciate it.Harry?Dowd said, looking to his lawyer.His voice cracked a little.The lawyer shook his head.Back at the police cart, Miller took a long moment.Dowd, handcuffed in the back, where everyone walking by could see him, was silent.Miller pulled up his hand terminal, noted the time of arrest, the objections of the lawyer, and a few other minor comments.A young woman in professional dress of cream colored linen hesitated at the door of the accountancy.Miller didnt recognize her; she was no one involved with the rape case, or at least not the one he was working.Her face had the expressionless calm of a fighter.He turned, craning his neck to look at Dowd, humiliated and not looking back.The woman shifted her gaze to Miller.She nodded once.Thank you.He nodded back.Just doing my job.She went through the door.Two hours later, Miller finished the last of the paperwork and sent Dowd off to the cells.Three and a half hours later, the first of his docking log requests came in.Five hours later, the government of Ceres collapsed.* * *   Despite being full, the station house was silent.Detectives and junior investigators, patrolmen and desk workers, the high and the low, they all gathered before Shaddid.She stood at her podium, her hair pulled back tight.She wore her Star Helix uniform, but the insignia had been removed.Her voice was shaky.Youve all heard this by now, but starting now, its official.The United Nations, responding to requests from Mars, is withdrawing from its oversight and protection of Ceres Station.This is a peaceful transition.This is not a coup.Im going to say that again.This isnt a coup.Earth is pulling out of here, we arent pushing.Thats bullshit, sir, someone shouted.Shaddid raised her hand.Theres a lot of loose talk, Shaddid said.I dont want to hear any of it from you.The governors going to make the formal announcement at the start of the next shift, and well get more details then.Until we hear otherwise, the Star Helix contract is still in place.A provisional government is being formed with members drawn from local business and union representation.We are still the law on Ceres, and I expect you to behave appropriately.You will all be here for your shifts.You will be here on time.You will act professionally and within the scope of standard practice.Miller looked over at Muss.His partners hair was still unkempt from the pillow.It was pushing midnight for them both.Any questions?Shaddid said in a voice that implied there ought not be.Whos going to pay Star Helix?Miller thought.What laws are we enforcing?What does Earth know that makes walking away from the biggest port in the Belt the smart move?Whos going to negotiate your peace treaty now?Muss, seeing Millers gaze, smiled.Guess were hosed, Miller said.Had to happen, Muss agreed.I better go.Got a stop to make.Up at the core?Muss didnt answer, because she didnt have to.Ceres didnt have laws.It had police.Miller headed back to his hole.The station hummed, the stone beneath him vibrating from the countless docking clamps and reactor cores, tubes and recyclers and pneumatics.The stone was alive, and hed forgotten the small signs that proved it.Six million people lived here, breathed this air.Fewer than in a middle sized city on Earth.He wondered if they were expendable.Had it really gone so far that the inner planets would be willing to lose a major station?It seemed like it had if Earth was abandoning Ceres.The OPA would step in, whether it wanted to or not.The power vacuum was too great.Then Mars would call it an OPA coup.Then Then what?Board it and put it under martial law?That was the good answer.Nuke it into dust?He couldnt quite bring himself to believe that either.There was just too much money involved.Docking fees alone would fuel a small national economy.And Shaddid and Dawes much as he hated it were right.Ceres under Earth contract had been the best hope for a negotiated peace.Was there someone on Earth who didnt want that peace?Someone or something powerful enough to move the glacial bureaucracy of the United Nations to take action?What am I looking at, Julie?he said to the empty air.What did you see out there thats worth Mars and the Belt killing each other?The station hummed to itself, a quiet, constant sound too soft for him to hear the voices within it.* * *   Muss didnt come to work in the morning, but there was a message on his system telling him shed be in late.Cleanup was her only explanation.To look at it, nothing about the station house had changed.The same people coming to the same place to do the same thing.No, that wasnt true.The energy was high.People were smiling, laughing, clowning around.It was a manic high, panic pressed through a cheesecloth mask of normalcy.It wasnt going to last.They were all that separated Ceres from anarchy.They were the law, and the difference between the survival of six million people and some mad bastard forcing open all the airlocks or poisoning the recyclers rested on maybe thirty thousand people.People like him.Maybe he should have rallied, risen to the occasion like the rest of them.The truth was the thought made him tired.Shaddid marched by and tapped him on the shoulder.He sighed, rose from his chair, and followed her.Dawes was in her office again, looking shaken and sleep deprived.Miller nodded to him.Shaddid crossed her arms, her eyes softer and less accusing than hed become used to.This is going to be tough, she said.Were facing something harder than anything weve had to do before.I need a team I can trust with my life.Extraordinary circumstances.You understand that?Yeah, he said.I got it.Ill stop drinking, get myself together.Miller.Youre not a bad person at heart.There was a time you were a pretty good cop.But I dont trust you, and we dont have time to start over, Shaddid said, her voice as near to gentle as he had ever heard it.Youre fired.Fred stood alone, hand outstretched, a warm and open smile on his broad face.There were no guards with assault rifles behind him.Holden shook Freds hand and then started laughing.Fred smiled and looked confused but let Holden keep a grip on his hand, waiting for Holden to explain what was so funny.Im sorry, but you have no idea how pleasant this is, Holden said.This is literally the first time in over a month that Ive gotten off a ship without it blowing up behind me.Fred laughed with him now, an honest laugh that seemed to originate somewhere in his belly.After a moment the man said, Youre quite safe here.We are the most protected station in the outer planets.Because youre OPA?Holden asked.Fred shook his head.No.We make campaign contributions to Earth and Mars politicians in amounts that would make a Hilton blush, he said.If anyone blows us up, half the UN assembly and all of the Martian Congress will be howling for blood.Its the problem with politics.Your enemies are often your allies.And vice versa.Fred gestured to a doorway behind him and motioned for everyone to follow.The ride was short, but halfway through, gravity reappeared, shifting in a disorienting swoop.Holden stumbled.Fred looked chagrined.Im sorry.I should have warned you about that.The central hubs null g.  Moving into the rings rotational gravity can be awkward the first time.Im fine, Holden said.Naomis brief smile might only have been his imagination.A moment later the elevator door opened onto a wide carpeted corridor with walls of pale green.It had the reassuring smell of air scrubbers and fresh carpet glue.Holden wouldnt have been surprised to find they were piping new space station scent into the air.The doors that led off the corridor were made of faux wood distinguishable from the real thing only because nobody had that much money.Of all his crew, Holden was almost certainly the only one who had grown up in a house with real wooden furniture and fixtures.Amos had grown up in Baltimore.They hadnt seen a tree there in more than a century.Holden pulled off his helmet and turned around to tell his crew to do the same, but theirs were already off.Amos looked up and down the corridor and whistled.Nice digs, Fred, he said.Follow me, Ill get you settled in, Fred replied, leading them down the corridor.As he walked, he spoke.Tycho Station has undergone a number of refurbishments over the last hundred years, as you might guess, but the basics havent changed much.It was a brilliant design to begin with; Malthus Tycho was an engineering genius.His grandson, Bredon, runs the company now.He isnt on station at the moment.Down the well at Luna negotiating the next big deal.Holden said, Seems like you have a lot on your plate already, with that monster parked outside.And, you know, a war going on.A group of people in jumpsuits of various colors walked past, talking animatedly.The corridor was so wide that no one had to give way.Fred gestured at them as they went by.First shifts just ending, so this is rush hour, he said.Its actually time to start drumming up new work.The Nauvoo is almost done.Theyll be loading colonists on her in six months.Always have to have the next project lined up.The Tycho spends eleven million UN dollars every day shes in operation, whether we make money that day or not.Its a big nut to cover.And the war well, were hoping thats temporary.And now youre taking in refugees.That wont help, Holden said.Fred just laughed and said, Four more people wont put us in the poorhouse anytime soon.Holden stopped, forcing the others to pull up short behind him.It was several steps before Fred noticed, then turned around with a confused look.Youre dodging, Holden said.Other than a couple billion dollars worth of stolen Martian warship, we havent got anything of value.Everyone thinks were dead.Any access of our accounts ruins that, and I just dont live in a universe where Daddy Warbucks swoops in and makes everything okay out of the goodness of his heart.So either tell us why youre taking the risk of putting us up, or we go get back on our ship and try our hand at piracy.Scourge of the Martian merchant fleet, theyll call us, Amos growled from somewhere behind him.He sounded pleased.Fred held up his hands.There was a hardness in his eyes, but also an amused respect.Nothing underhanded, you have my word, he said.Youre armed, and station security will allow you to carry guns whenever you like.That alone should reassure you that Im not planning foul play.But let me get you settled in before we do much more talking, okay?Holden didnt move.Another group of returning workers was going by in the corridor, and they watched the scene curiously as they passed.Someone from the knot of people called out, Everything okay, Fred?Fred nodded and waved them by impatiently.Lets get out of the corridor at least.We arent unpacking until we get some answers, Holden replied.Fine.Were almost there, Fred said, and then led them off again at a somewhat faster pace.He stopped at a small inset in the corridor wall with two doors in it.Opening one with the swipe of a card, he led the four of them into a large residential suite with a roomy living space and lots of seating.Bathroom is that door back there on the left.The bedroom is the one on the right.Theres even a small kitchen space over here, Fred said, pointing to each thing as he spoke.Holden sat down in a large brown faux leather recliner and leaned it back.A remote control was in a pocket of the armrest.He assumed it controlled the impressively large screen that took up most of one wall.Naomi and Amos sat on a couch that matched his chair, and Alex draped himself over a loveseat in a nice contrasting cream color.Comfortable?Fred asked, pulling a chair away from the six seat dining area and sitting down across from Holden.Its all right, Holden said defensively.My ship has a really nice coffeemaker.I suppose bribes wont work.You are all comfortable, though?We have two suites set aside for you, both this basic layout, though the other suite has two rooms.I wasnt sure of the, ah, sleeping arrangements  Fred trailed off uncomfortably.Dont worry, Boss, you can bunk with me, Amos said with a wink at Naomi.Naomi just smiled faintly.Okay, Fred, were off the street, she said.Now answer the captains questions.Fred nodded, then stood up and cleared his throat.He seemed to review something.When he spoke, the conversational facade was gone.His voice carried a grim authority.War between the Belt and Mars is suicide.Even if every rock hopper in the Belt were armed, we still couldnt compete with the Martian navy.We might kill a few with tricks and suicide runs.Mars might feel forced to nuke one of our stations to prove a point.But we can strap chemical rockets onto a couple hundred rocks the size of bunk beds and rain Armageddon down on Martian dome cities.Fred paused, as if looking for words, then sat back down on his chair.All of the war drums ignore that.Its the elephant in the room.Anyone who doesnt live on a spaceship is structurally vulnerable.Tycho, Eros, Pallas, Ceres.Stations cant evade incoming missiles.And with all of the enemys citizens living at the bottom of huge gravity wells, we dont even have to aim particularly well.Einstein was right.We will be fighting the next war with rocks.But the Belt has rocks that will turn the surface of Mars into a molten sea.Right now everyone is still playing nice, and only shooting at ships.Very gentlemanly.But sooner or later, one side or the other will be pressed to do something desperate.Holden leaned forward, the slick surface of his environment suit making an embarrassing squeak on the leather textured chair.No one laughed.I agree.What does that have to do with us?he asked.Too much blood has already been shed, Fred said.Shed.Holden winced at the bleak, unintentional pun but said nothing.The Canterbury, Fred continued.The Donnager.People arent just going to forget about those ships, and those thousands of innocent people.Seems like you just crossed off the only two options, Chief, Alex said.No war, no peace.Theres a third alternative.Civilized society has another way of dealing with things like this, Fred said.A criminal trial.Amos snort shook the air.Holden had to fight not to smile himself.Are you fucking serious?Amos asked.And how do you put a goddamn Martian stealth ship on trial?Do we go question all the stealth ships about their whereabouts, double check their alibis?Fred held up a hand.Stop thinking of the Canterburys destruction as an act of war, he said.It was a crime.Right now, people are overreacting, but once the situation sinks in, heads will cool.People on both sides will see where this road goes and look for another way out.There is a window where the saner elements can investigate events, negotiate jurisdiction, and assign blame to some party or parties that both sides can agree to.A trial.Its the only outcome that doesnt involve millions of deaths and the collapse of human infrastucture.Holden shrugged, a gesture barely visible in his heavy environment suit.So it goes to a trial.You still arent answering my question.Fred pointed at Holden, then at each of the crew in turn.Youre the ace in the hole.You four people are the only eyewitnesses to the destruction of both ships.When the trial comes, I need you and your depositions.I have influence already through our political contacts, but you can buy me a seat at the table.It will be a whole new set of treaties between the Belt and the inner planets.We can do in months what Id dreamed of doing in decades.And you want to use our value as witnesses to force your way into the process so you can make those treaties look the way you want them to, Holden said.Yes.And Im willing to give you protection, shelter, and run of my station for as long as it takes to get there.Holden took a long, deep breath, got up, and started unzipping his suit.Yeah, okay.Thats just self serving enough I believe it, he said.Lets get settled in.* * *   Naomi was singing karaoke.Just thinking about it made Holdens head spin.Naomi.Karaoke.Even considering everything that had happened to them over the past month, Naomi up onstage with a mic in one hand and some sort of fuchsia martini in the other, screaming out an angry Belt punk anthem by the Moldy Filters, was the strangest thing hed ever seen.She finished to scattered applause and a few catcalls, then staggered off the stage and collapsed across from him in the booth.She held up her drink, sloshing a good half of it onto the table, then threw the other half back all at once.Whadja think?Naomi asked, waving at the bartender for another.It was terrible, Holden replied.No, really.It was truly one of the most awful renditions of one of the most awful songs Ive ever heard.Naomi shook her head, blowing an exasperated raspberry at him.Her dark hair fell across her face and, when the bartender brought her a second brightly colored martini, foiled all her attempts at drinking.She finally grabbed her hair and held it above her head in a clump while she drank.You dont get it, she said.Its supposed to be awful.Thats the point.Then it was the best version of that song Ive ever heard, Holden said.Damn straight.Naomi looked around the bar.Wherere Amos and Alex?Amos found what Im pretty sure was the most expensive hooker Ive ever seen.Alex is in the back playing darts.He made some claims about the superiority of Martian darts players.I assume theyre going to kill him and throw him out an airlock.A second singer was onstage, crooning out some sort of Vietnamese power ballad.Naomi watched the singer for a while, sipping her drink, then said, Maybe we should go save him.Which one?Alex.Why would Amos need saving?Because Im pretty sure he told the expensive hooker he was on Freds expense account.Lets mount a rescue mission; we can save them both, Naomi said, then drank the rest of her cocktail.I need more rescue fuel, though.She started waving at the bartender again, but Holden reached out and grabbed her hand and held it on the table.Maybe we should take a breather instead, he said.A flush of anger as intense as it was brief lit her face.She pulled back her hand.You take a breather.Ive just had two ships and a bunch of friends shot out from underneath me, and spent three weeks of dead time flying to get here.So, no.Im getting another drink, and then doing another set.The crowd loves me, Naomi said.What about our rescue mission?Lost cause.Amos will be murdered by space hookers, but at least hell die the way he lived.Naomi pushed her way up from the table, grabbed her martini off the bar, and headed toward the karaoke stage.Holden watched her go, then finished off the scotch hed been nursing for the past two hours and got up.For a moment there, hed had a vision of the two of them staggering back to the room together, then falling into bed.Hed have hated himself in the morning for taking advantage, but hed still have done it.Naomi was looking at him from the stage, and he realized hed been staring.He gave a little wave, then headed out the door with only ghosts Ade, Captain McDowell, Gomez and Kelly and Shed to keep him company.* * *   The suite was comfortable and huge and depressing.Hed lain on the bed less than five minutes before he was up and out the door again.He walked the corridor for half an hour, finding the big intersections that led to other parts of the ring.He found an electronics store and a teahouse and what on closer inspection turned out to be a very expensive brothel.He declined the video menu of services the desk clerk offered and wandered out again, wondering if Amos was somewhere inside.He was halfway down a corridor he hadnt seen before when a small knot of teenage girls passed him.Their faces looked no older than fourteen, but they were already as tall as he was.They got quiet as he walked by, then burst out laughing when he was behind them, and hurried away.Tycho was a city, and he suddenly felt very much like a foreigner, unsure of where to go or what to do.It was no surprise to him when he looked up from his wanderings and discovered hed come to the elevator to the docking area.He punched the button and climbed inside, remembering to turn on his boot mags just in time to avoid being flung off his feet when the gravity twisted sideways and vanished.Even though hed only had possession of the ship for three weeks, climbing back onto the Rocinante felt like going home.Using gentle touches on the keel ladder, he made his way up to the cockpit.He pulled himself into the copilots couch, strapped in, and closed his eyes.The ship was silent.With the reactor off line, and no one aboard, nothing was moving at all.The flexible docking tube that connected the Roci to the station transmitted very little vibration to the ship.Holden could close his eyes and drift in the straps and disconnect from everything around him.It would have been peaceful except that every time hed closed his eyes for the past month, the fading ghost lights behind his eyelids had been Ade winking and blowing away like dust.The voice at the back of his head was McDowells as he tried to save his ship right up to the very last second.He wondered if hed have them for the rest of his life, coming out to haunt him every time he found a moment of quiet.He remembered the old timers from his navy days.Grizzled lifers who could soundly sleep while two meters away their shipmates played a raucous game of poker or watched the vids with the volume all the way up.Back then hed assumed it was just learned behavior, the body adapting so it could get enough rest in an environment that never really had downtime.Now he wondered if those vets found the constant noise preferable.A way to keep their lost shipmates away.They probably went home after their twenty and never slept again.He opened his eyes and watched a small green telltale blink on the pilots console.It was the only light in the room, and it illuminated nothing.But its slow fade in and out was somehow comforting.A quiet heartbeat for the ship.He told himself that Fred was right; a trial was the right thing to hope for.But he wanted that stealth ship in Alexs gun sights.He wanted that unknown crew to live through the terrifying moment when all the countermeasures have failed, the torpedoes are seconds from impact, and absolutely nothing can stop them.He wanted them to have that same last gasp of fear hed heard through Ades mic.For a time, he displaced the ghosts in his head with violent vengeance fantasies.When they stopped working, he floated down to the personnel deck, strapped into his cot, and tried to sleep.The Rocinante sang him a lullaby of air recyclers and silence.Miller sat at an open caf, the tunnel wide above him.Grass grew tall and pale in the public commons, and the ceiling glowed full spectrum white.Ceres Station had come unmoored.Orbital mechanics and inertia kept it physically where it had always been, but the stories about it had changed.The point defenses were the same.The tensile strength of the port blast doors was the same.The ephemeral shield of political status was all theyd lost, and it was everything.Miller leaned forward and sipped his coffee.There were children playing on the commons.He thought of them as children, though he remembered thinking of himself as an adult at that age.Fifteen, sixteen years old.They wore OPA armbands.The boys spoke in loud, angry voices about tyranny and freedom.The girls watched the boys strut.The ancient, animal story, the same whether it was on a spinning rock surrounded by hard vacuum or the stamp sized chimpanzee preserves on Earth.Even in the Belt, youth brought invulnerability, immortality, the unshakable conviction that for you, things would be different.The laws of physics would cut you a break, the missiles would never hit, the air would never hiss out into nothing.Maybe for other people the patched together fighting ships of the OPA, the water haulers, the Martian gunships, the Scopuli, the Canterbury, the Donnager, the hundred other ships that had died in small actions since the system had turned itself into a battlefield but not you.And when youth was lucky enough to survive its optimism, all Miller had left was a little fear, a little envy, and the overwhelming sense of lifes fragility.But he had three months worth of company script in his account and a lot of free time, and the coffee wasnt bad.You need anything, sir?the waiter asked.He didnt look any older than the kids on the grass.Miller shook his head.Five days had passed since Star Helix pulled its contract.The governor of Ceres was gone, smuggled out on a transport before the news had gone wide.The Outer Planets Alliance had announced the inclusion of Ceres among official OPA held real estate, and no one had said otherwise.Miller had spent the first day of his unemployment drunk, but his bender had an oddly pro forma feel.Hed descended into the bottle because it was familiar, because it was what you did when youd lost the career that defined you.The second day, hed gotten through the hangover.The third, hed gotten bored.All through the station, security forces were making the kind of display hed expected, preemptive peacekeeping.The few political rallies and protests ended fast and hard, and the citizens of Ceres didnt much care.Their eyes were on their monitors, on the war.A few locals with busted heads getting thrown into prison without charges were beneath notice.And Miller was personally responsible for none of it.The fourth day, hed checked his terminal and discovered that 80 percent of his docking log requests had come through before Shaddid had shut his access down.Over a thousand entries, any one of which could be the only remaining lead to Julie Mao.So far, no Martian nukes were on their way to crack Ceres.No demands of surrender.No boarding forces.It could all change in a moment, but until it did, Miller was drinking coffee and auditing ship records, about one every fifteen minutes.Miller figured that if Holden was the last ship in the log, hed find him in about six weeks.The Adrianopole, a third gen prospector, had docked at Pallas within the arrival window.Miller checked the open registration, frustrated again at how little information was there compared to the security databases.Owned by Strego Anthony Abramowitz.Eight citations for substandard maintenance, banned from Eros and Ceres as a danger to the port.An idiot and an accident waiting to happen, but the flight plan seemed legitimate, and the history of the ship was deep enough not to smell new minted.Miller deleted the entry.The Badass Motherfucker, a freight hauler doing a triangle between Luna, Ganymede, and the Belt.Owned by MYOFB Corporation out of Luna.A query to the public bases at Ganymede showed it had left the port there at the listed time and just hadnt bothered to file a flight plan.Miller tapped the screen with a fingernail.Not exactly how hed fly under the radar.Anyone with authority would roust that ship just for the joy of doing it.He deleted the entry.His terminal chimed.An incoming message.Miller flipped over to it.One of the girls on the commons shrieked and the others laughed.A sparrow flew past, its wings humming in the constant recycler driven breeze.Havelock looked better than when hed been on Ceres.Happier.The dark circles were gone from his eyes, and the shape of his face had subtly softened, as if the need to prove himself in the Belt had changed his bones and now he was falling back into his natural form.Miller!the recording said.I heard about Earth cutting Ceres just before I got your message.Bad luck.Im sorry to hear Shaddid fired you.Between the two of us, shes a pompous idiot.The rumor Ive heard is Earth is doing everything it can to stay out of the war, including giving up any station that its expecting to be a point of contention.You know how it is.Youve got a pit bull on one side of you and a rottweiler on the other, first thing you do is drop your steak.Miller chuckled.Ive signed on with Protogen security, big company private army bullshit.But the pay is worth putting up with their delusions of grandeur.The contracts supposed to be on Ganymede, but with the crap going on right now, who knows how itll really play out?Turns out Protogens got a training base in the Belt.Id never heard about it, but its supposed to be quite the gymnasium.I know theyre hiring on, and Id be happy to put in a word for you.Just let me know, and Ill get you together with the induction recruiter, get you off that damned rock.Havelock smiled.Take care of yourself, partner, the Earther said.Keep in touch.Protogen.Pinkwater.Al Abbiq.Small corporate security forces that the big transorbital companies used as private armies and mercenary forces to rent out as needed.AnnanSec had the Pallas security contract, and had for years, but it was Mars based.The OPA was probably hiring, but probably not him.It had been years since hed tried to find work.Hed assumed that particular struggle was behind him, that he was going to die working the Ceres Station security contract.Now that events had thrown him out, everything had an odd floating feeling.Like the gap between getting hit and feeling the pain.He needed to find another job.He needed to do more than send a couple messages out to his old partners.There were employment firms.There were bars on Ceres that would hire an ex cop for a bouncer.There were gray markets that would take anyone capable of giving them a veneer of legality.The last thing that made sense was to sit around, ogling girls in the park and chasing down leads on a case that he hadnt been meant to follow up on in the first place.The Dagon had come into Ceres just a little ahead of the arrival window.Owned by the Glapion Collective, who were, he was pretty sure, an OPA front.That made it a good fit.Except the flight plan had been put in just a few hours after the Donnager blew, and the exit record from Io looked solid.Miller shifted it into a file he was keeping for ships that earned a second look.The Rocinante, owned by Silencieux Courant Holdings out of Luna, was a gas hauler that had landed at Tycho just hours before the end of the arrival window.Silencieux Courant was a medium sized corporate entity with no obvious ties to the OPA, and the flight plan from Pallas was plausible.Miller put his fingertip over the delete key, then paused.He sat back.Why was a gas hauler going between Pallas and Tycho?Both stations were gas consumers.Flying from consumer to consumer without hitting a supply in the middle was a good way to not cover your docking fees.He put in a request for the flight plan that had taken the Rocinante to Pallas from wherever it had been before, then sat back to wait.If the records were cached in the Ceres servers, the request shouldnt take more than a minute or two.The notification bar estimated an hour and a half, so that meant the request was getting forwarded to the docking systems at Pallas.It hadnt been in the local backup.Miller stroked his chin; five days of stubble had almost reached the beginning of a beard.He felt a smile starting.He did a definition search on Rocinante.Literally meaning no longer a workhorse, its first entry was as the name of Don Quixotes horse.That you, Holden?Miller said to the screen.You out tilting at windmills?Sir?the waiter said, but Miller waved him away.There were hundreds of entries still to be looked at and dozens at least in his second look folder.Miller ignored them, staring at the entry from Tycho as if by sheer force of will he could make more information appear on the screen.Then, slowly, he pulled up the message from Havelock, hit the respond key, and looked into the tiny black pinprick of the terminals camera.Hey, partner, he said.Thanks for the offer.I may take you up on it, but Ive got some kinks I need to work out before I jump.You know how it is.If you can do me a favor, though I need to keep track of a ship, and Ive only got the public databases to work from, plus which Ceres may be at war with Mars by now.Who knows, you know?Anyway, if you can put a level one watch on any flight plans for her, drop me a note if anything comes up Id buy you a drink sometime.He paused.There had to be something more to say.Take care of yourself, partner.He reviewed the message.On screen, he looked tired, the smile a little fake, the voice a little higher than it sounded in his head.But it said what it needed to say.He sent it.This was what hed been reduced to.Access gone, service gun confiscated though he still had a couple of drops in his hole money running out.He had to play the angles, call in favors for things that should have been routine, outthink the system for any scrap.Hed been a cop, and theyd turned him into a mouse.Still, he thought, sitting back in the chair.Pretty good work for a mouse.The sound of detonation came from spinward, then voices raised in anger.The kids on the commons stopped their games of touch me touch you and stared.Miller stood up.There was smoke, but he couldnt see flames.The breeze picked up as the station air cleaners raised the flow to suck away particulates so the sensors didnt think there was a risk of fanning a fire.Three gunshots rang out in fast succession, and the voices came together in a rough chant.Miller couldnt make words out of it, but the rhythm told him all he needed to know.Not a disaster, not a fire, not a breach.Just a riot.The kids were walking toward the commotion.Miller caught one by the elbow.She couldnt have been more than sixteen, her eyes near black, her face a perfect heart shape.Dont go over there, he said.Get your friends together and walk the other way.The girl looked at him, his hand on her arm, the distant commotion.You cant help, he said.She pulled her arm free.Gotta try, yeah?she said.Podra intentar, you know.You could too.Just did, Miller said as he put his terminal in its case and walked away.Behind him, the sounds of the riot grew.But he figured the police could take care of it.* * *   Over the next fourteen hours, the system net reported five riots on the station, some minor structural damage.Someone hed never heard of announced a tri phase curfew; people out of their holes more than two hours before or after their work shifts would be subject to arrest.Whoever was running the show now thought they could lock down six million people and create stability and peace.He wondered what Shaddid thought about that.Outside Ceres, things were getting worse.The deep astronomy labs on Triton had been occupied by a band of prospectors sympathetic to the OPA.Theyd turned the array in system and had been broadcasting the location of every Martian ship in the system along with high definition images of the surface of Mars, down to the topless sunbathers in the dome parks.The story was that a volley of nukes was on its way to the station, and the array would be bright dust within a week.Earths imitation of a snail was picking up the pace as Earth  and Luna based companies pulled back down the gravity well.Not all of them, not even half, but enough to send the Terran message: Count us out.Mars appealed for solidarity; the Belt appealed for justice or, more often, told the birthplace of humanity to go fuck itself.It wasnt out of control yet, but it was ramping up.Another few incidents and it wouldnt matter how it had started.It wouldnt matter what the stakes were.Mars knew the Belt couldnt win, and the Belt knew it had nothing to lose.It was a recipe for death on a scale humanity had never seen.And, like Ceres, there wasnt much Miller could do about that either.But he could find James Holden, find out what had happened to the Scopuli, follow the leads back to Julie Mao.He was a detective.It was what he did.As he packed up his hole, throwing out the collected detritus that grew over decades like a crust, he talked to her.He tried to explain why hed given up everything to find her.After his discovery of the Rocinante, he could hardly avoid the word quixotic.His imaginary Julie laughed or was touched.She thought he was a sad, pathetic little man, since just tracking her down was the nearest to a purpose in life he could find.She dressed him down as being a tool of her parents.She wept and put her arms around him.She sat with him in some almost unimaginable observation lounge and watched the stars.He fit everything he had into a shoulder bag.Two changes of clothes, his papers, his hand terminal.A picture of Candace from back in better days.All the hard copy of Julies case hed made before Shaddid wiped his partition, including three pictures of Julie.He thought that everything hed lived through should have added up to more, and then changed his mind.It was probably about right.He spent one last day ignoring the curfew, making his rounds of the station, saying goodbye to the few people he felt he might miss or might miss him.To his surprise, Muss, who he found at a tense and uncomfortable police bar, actually teared up and hugged him until his ribs ached from it.He booked passage on a transport to Tycho.His bunk ran him a quarter of his remaining funds.It occurred to him, not for the first time, that he had to find Julie pretty damn quick or find a job to support him through the investigation.But it hadnt happened yet, and the universe wasnt stable enough anymore to make long range planning more than a sour joke.As if to prove the point, his terminal chimed as he was in the line to board the transport.Hey, partner, Havelock said.That favor you needed?I got a bite.Your package just put in a flight plan for Eros.Im sending the public access data attached.Id get you the good stuff, but these Protogen guys are tight.I mentioned you to the recruiter and she seemed interested.So let me know, right?Talk to you soon.Eros.Great.Miller nodded at the woman behind him, stepped out of line, and walked to the kiosk.By the time a screen was open, they were calling final boarding for the Tycho transport.Miller turned in his ticket, got a nominal refund, and spent a third of what he still had in his account for a ticket to Eros.Still, it could have been worse.He could have been on the way before he got word.He had to start thinking about it as good luck, not bad.The passage confirmation came through with a chime like a gently struck triangle.I hope Im right about this, he said to Julie.If Holdens not there, Im gonna feel pretty stupid.In his mind, she smiled ruefully.Life is risk, she said.Ships were small.Space was always at a premium, and even on a monster like the Donnager, the corridors and compartments were cramped and uncomfortable.On the Rocinante, the only rooms where Holden could spread out his arms without touching two walls were the galley and the cargo bay.No one who flew for a living was claustrophobic, but even the most hardened Belt prospector could recognize the rising tension of being ship bound.It was the ancient stress response of the trapped animal, the subconscious knowledge that there was literally nowhere to go that you couldnt see from where you were already standing.Getting off the ship at port was a sudden and sometimes giddying release of tension.It often took the form of a drinking game.Like all professional sailors, Holden had sometimes ended long flights by drinking himself into a stupor.More than once hed wandered into a brothel and left only when they threw him out with an emptied account, a sore groin, and a prostate as dry as the Sahara desert.So when Amos staggered into his room after three days on station, Holden knew exactly what the big mechanic felt like.Holden and Alex were sharing the couch and watching a newsfeed.Two talking heads were discussing the Belter actions with words like criminal, terrorist, and sabotage.The Martians were peacekeepers.It was a Martian news channel.Amos snorted and collapsed on the couch.Holden muted the screen.Having a good shore leave, sailor?Holden asked with a grin.Ill never drink again, Amos groaned.Naomis comin over with some chow she got at that sushi place, Alex said.Nice raw fish wrapped in fake seaweed.Amos groaned again.Thats not nice, Alex, Holden said.Let the mans liver die in peace.The door to the suite slid open again, and Naomi came in carrying a tall stack of white boxes.Foods here, she said.Alex opened all the boxes and started handing around small disposable plates.Every time its your turn to get food, you get salmon rolls.It shows a lack of imagination, Holden said as he began putting food on his plate.I like salmon, Naomi replied.The room got quiet as people ate; the only sounds were the clack of plastic chopsticks and the wet squish of things being dipped in wasabi and soy.When the food was gone, Holden wiped his eyes, made runny by the heat in his sinuses, and leaned his chair all the way back.Amos used one of his chopsticks to scratch under the cast on his leg.You guys did a pretty good job setting this, he said.Its the thing on my body that hurts the least right now.Naomi grabbed the remote off Holdens armrest and turned the volume back on.She began spooling through the different feeds.Alex closed his eyes and slid down on the loveseat, lacing his fingers across his belly and sighing contentedly.Holden felt a sudden and irrational annoyance at his crew for being so comfortable.Everyone had enough of sucking on Freds teat yet?he said.I know I have.What the fuck are you talking about?Amos said, shaking his head.Im just getting started.I mean, Holden said, how long are we going to hang around on Tycho, drinking and whoring and eating sushi on Freds expense account?As long as I can?Alex said.You have a better plan, then, Naomi said.I dont have a plan, but I want to get back in the game.We were full of righteous anger and dreams of vengeance when we got here, and a couple of blowjobs and hangovers later, its like nothing ever happened.Uh, vengeance kinda requires someone to avenge upon, Cap, Alex said.Case you aint noticed, were lackin in that department.That ship is still out there, somewhere.The people who ordered it to shoot are, too, Holden said.So, Alex replied slowly, we take off and start flyin in a spiral until we run into it?Naomi laughed and threw a soy packet at him.I dont know what we do, Holden said, but sitting here while the people who killed our ship keep doing whatever it is theyre doing is making me nuts.Weve been here three days, Naomi said.We deserve some comfortable beds and decent food and a chance to blow off steam.Dont try to make us feel bad for taking it.Besides, Fred said well get those bastards at the trial, Amos said.If theres a trial, Holden replied.If.It wont happen for months, or maybe even years.And even then, Freds looking at those treaties.Amnesty might be another bargaining chip, right?You were quick enough to agree to his terms, Jim, Naomi said.Changed your mind?If Fred wants depositions in exchange for letting us patch up and rest, the price was cheap.That doesnt mean I think a trial will fix everything, or that I want to be sidelined until it happens.He gestured at the faux leather couch and huge wall screen around them.Besides, this can be a prison.Its a nice one, but as long as Fred controls the purse strings, he owns us.Make no mistake.Naomis brow crinkled; her eyes grew serious.Whats the option, sir?she asked.Leave?Holden folded his arms, his mind turning over everything hed said as if he was hearing it for the first time.Saying things out loud actually made them clearer.Im thinking we look for work, he said.Weve got a good ship.More importantly, we have a sneaky ship.Its fast.We can run without a transponder if we need to.Lots of people will need things moved from place to place with a war on.Gives us something to do while we wait for Freds trial, and a way to put money in our pockets so we can get off the dole.And, as we fly from place to place, we can keep our ears and eyes open.Never know what well find.And seriously, how long can you three stand to be station rats?There was a moments silence.I could station rat for another week?Amos said.It aint a bad idea, Cap, Alex said with a nod.Its your decision, Captain, Naomi said.Ill stick with you, and I like the idea of getting my own money again.But I hope youre not in a hurry.I could really use a few more days off.Holden clapped his hands and jumped to his feet.Nope, he said.Having a plan makes all the difference.Downtimes easier to enjoy when I know itll end.Alex and Amos got up together and headed for the door.Alex had won a few dollars playing darts, and now he and Amos were in the process of turning it into even more money at the card tables.Dont wait up, Boss, Amos said to Naomi.Im feeling lucky today.They left, and Holden went to the small kitchen nook to make coffee.Naomi followed him in.One other thing, she said.Holden tore open the sealed coffee packet, the strong odor filling the room.Shoot, he said.Fred is taking care of all the arrangements for Kellys body.Hell hold it here in state until we go public with our survival.Then hell ship it back to Mars.Holden filled the coffeemaker with water from the tap and started the machine.It made soft gurgling sounds.Good.Lieutenant Kelly deserves all the respect and dignity we can give him.It got me thinking about that data cube he had.I havent been able to hack it.Its some kind of military ber encryption that makes my head hurt.So   Just say it, Holden said with a frown.I want to give it to Fred.I know its a risk.We have no idea whats on it, and for all his charm and hospitality, Freds still OPA.But he was also high ranking UN military.And hes got a serious brain trust here on the station.He might be able to open it up.Holden thought for a moment, then nodded.Okay, let me sit with that.I want to know what Yao was trying to get off the ship, but   Yeah.They shared a companionable silence as the coffee brewed.When it was finished, Holden poured two mugs and handed one to Naomi.Captain, she said, then paused.Jim.Ive been a pain in the ass XO so far.Ive been stressed out and scared shitless about eighty percent of the time.You do an amazing job of hiding that fact, Holden replied.Naomi nodded the compliment away.Anyway, Ive been pushy about some things that I probably shouldnt have been.Not a big deal.Okay, let me finish, she said.I want you to know I think youve done a great job of keeping us alive.You keep us focused on the problems we can solve instead of feeling sorry for ourselves.You keep everyone in orbit around you.Not everyone can do that, I couldnt do it, and weve needed that stability.Holden felt a glow of pride.He hadnt expected it, and he didnt trust it, but it felt good all the same.Thank you, Holden said.I cant speak for Amos and Alex, but I plan to stick it out.Youre not just the captain because McDowell is dead.Youre our captain, as far as Im concerned.Just so you know.She looked down, blushing as if shed just confessed something.Maybe she had.Ill try not to blow it, he said.Id appreciate that, sir.* * *   Fred Johnsons office was like its occupant: big, intimidating, and overflowing with things that needed to be done.The room was easily two and a half square meteres, making it larger than any single compartment on the Rocinante.His desk was made of actual wood, looked at least a hundred years old, and smelled of lemon oil.Holden sat in a chair that was just a little lower than Freds, and looked at the mounds of file folders and papers covering every flat surface.Fred had sent for him and then spent the first ten minutes after hed arrived speaking on the phone.Whatever he was talking about, it sounded technical.Holden assumed it was related to the giant generation ship outside.It didnt bother him to be ignored for a few minutes, since the wall behind Fred was entirely covered by a bleedingly high definition screen pretending to be a window.It was showing a spectacular view of the Nauvoo moving past as the station spun.Fred spoiled the scene by putting the phone down.Sorry about that, he said.The atmosphere processing system has been a nightmare from day one.When youre going a hundred plus years on only the air you can bring with you, the loss tolerances are stricter than usual.Sometimes its difficult to impress the importance of fine details on the contractors.I was enjoying the view, Holden said, gesturing at the screen.Im starting to wonder if well be able to get it done on schedule.Why?Fred sighed and leaned his chair back with a squeak.Its the war between Mars and the Belt.Material shortages, then?Not just that.Pirate casts claiming to speak for the OPA are working into a frenzy.Belt prospectors with homemade torpedo launchers are firing on Martian warships.They get wiped out in response, but every now and then one of those torpedoes hits and kills a few Martians.Which means Mars starts shooting first.Fred nodded and then got up and started pacing the room.And then even honest citizens on legitimate business start getting worried about going out of the house, he said.Weve had over a dozen late shipments so far this month, and Im worried it will stop being delays and start being cancellations.You know, Ive been thinking about the same thing, Holden said.Fred acted as though he hadnt heard.Ive been on that bridge, Fred said.Unidentified ship coming on you, and a decision to make?No one wants to press the button.Ive watched a ship get bigger and bigger on the scope while my finger was on the trigger.I remember begging them to stop.Holden said nothing.Hed seen it too.There was nothing to say.Fred let silence hang in the air for a moment, then shook his head and straightened up.I need to ask you a favor, Fred said.You can always ask, Fred.Youve paid for that much, Holden replied.I need to borrow your ship.The Roci?Holden said.Why?I need to have something picked up and delivered here, and I need a ship that can stay quiet and run past Martian picket ships if it needs to.The Rocinante is definitely the right ship, then, but that didnt answer my question.Why?Fred turned his back to Holden and looked at the view screen.The nose of the Nauvoo was just vanishing from sight.The view turned to the flat, star speckled black of forever.I need to pick someone up on Eros, he said.Someone important.Ive got people who can do it, but the only ships weve got are light freighters and a couple of small shuttles.Nothing that can make the trip quickly enough or have a hope of running away if trouble starts.Does this person have a name?I mean, you keep saying you dont want to fight, but the other unique thing about my ship is that its the only one here with guns.Im sure the OPA has a whole list of things theyd like blown up.You dont trust me.Nope.Fred turned back around and gripped the back of his chair.His knuckles were white.Holden wondered if hed gone too far.Look, Holden said, you talk a good game about peace and trials and all that.You disavow the pirate casts.You have a nice station filled with nice people.I have every reason to believe you are what you say you are.But weve been here three days, and the first time you tell me about your plans, you ask to borrow my ship for a secret mission.Sorry.If Im part of this, I get full access; no secrets.Even if I knew for a fact, which I dont, that you had nothing but good intentions, I still wouldnt go along with the cloak and dagger bullshit.Fred stared at him for a few seconds, then came around his chair and sat down.Holden found he was tapping his fingers on his thigh nervously and forced himself to stop.Freds eyes flicked down at Holdens hand and then back up.He continued to stare.Holden cleared his throat.Look, youre the big dog here.Even if I didnt know who you used to be, youd scare the shit out of me, so dont feel the need to prove it.But no matter how scared I am, Im not backing down on this.Freds hoped for laughter didnt come.Holden tried to swallow without gulping.I bet every captain you ever flew under thought you were a gigantic pain in the ass, Fred said finally.I believe my record reflects that, Holden said, trying to hide his relief.I need to fly to Eros and find a man named Lionel Polanski, and then bring him back to Tycho.Thats only a week out if we push, Holden said, doing the math in his head.The fact that Lionel doesnt actually exist complicates the mission.Yeah, okay.Now Im confused, Holden agreed.You wanted in?Fred said, the words taking on a quiet ferocity.Now youre in.Lionel Polanski exists only on paper, and owns things that Mr.Tycho doesnt want to own.Including a courier ship called the Scopuli.Holden leaned forward in his chair, his face intense.You now have my undivided attention, he said.The nonexistent owner of the Scopuli checked into a flophouse on one of the shit levels of Eros.We only just got the message.We have to work on the assumption that whoever got the room knows our operations intimately, needs help, and cant ask for it openly.We can leave in an hour, Holden said breathlessly.Fred held up his hands in a gesture that was surprisingly Belter for an Earth man.When, Fred asked, did this turn into you leaving?I wont loan my ship, but Ill definitely rent it out.My crew and I were talking about getting jobs, actually.Hire us.Deduct whatevers fair for services youve already rendered.No, Fred said.I need you.You dont, Holden replied.You need our depositions.And were not going to sit here waiting a year or two for sanity to reign.Well all do video depositions, sign whatever affidavits you want us to as to their authenticity, but were leaving to find work one way or the other.You might as well make use of it.No, Fred said.Youre too valuable to take risks with your lives.What if I throw in the data cube the captain of the Donnager was trying to liberate?The silence was back, but it had a different feel to it.Look, Holden said, pressing on.You need a ship like the Roci.Ive got one.You need a crew for her.Ive got that too.And youre as hungry to know whats on that cube as I am.I dont like the risk.Your other option is to throw us in the brig and commandeer the ship.Theres some risks in that too.Fred laughed.Holden felt himself relax.Youll still have the same problem that brought you here, Fred said.Your ship looks like a gunship, no matter what its transponder is saying.Holden jumped up and grabbed a piece of paper from Freds desk.He started writing on it with a pen snatched from a decorative pen set.Ive been thinking about that.Youve got full manufacturing facilities here.And were supposed to be a light gas freighter.So, he said as he sketched a rough outline of the ship, we weld on a bunch of empty compressed gas storage tanks in two bands around the hull.Use them to hide the tubes.Repaint the whole thing.Weld on a few projections to break up the hull profile and hide us from ship recognition software.Itll look like shit and screw up the aerodynamics, but we wont be near atmo anytime soon.Itll look exactly like what it is: something a bunch of Belters slapped together in a hurry.He handed the paper to Fred.Fred began laughing in earnest, either at the terrible drawing or at the absurdity of the whole thing.You could give a pirate a hell of a surprise, he said.If I do this, you and your crew will record my depositions and hire on as an independent contractor for errands like the Eros run and appear on my behalf when the peace negotiations start.Yes.I want the right to outbid anyone else who tries to hire you.No contracts without my counteroffer.Holden held out his hand, and Fred shook it.Nice doing business with you, Fred.As Holden left the office, Fred was already on the comm with his machine shop people.Holden pulled out his portable terminal and called up Naomi.Yeah, she said.Pack up the kids, were going to Eros.The people mover to Eros was small, cheap, and overcrowded.The air recyclers had the plastic and resin smell of long life industrial models that Miller associated with warehouses and fuel depots.The lights were cheap LEDs tinted a false pink that was supposed to flatter the complexion but instead made everyone look like undercooked beef.There were no cabins, only row after row of formed laminate seating and two long walls with five stacks of bunks that the passengers could hot swap.Miller had never been on a cheapjack transport before, but he knew how they worked.If there was a fight, the ships crew would pump riot gas into the cabin, knock everyone out, and put anyone whod been in the scuffle under restraint.It was a draconian system, but it did tend to keep passengers polite.The bar was always open and the drinks were cheap.Not long ago Miller would have found that enticing.Instead, he sat on one of the long seats, his hand terminal open.Julies case file what he had reconstructed of it glowed before him.The picture of her, proud and smiling, in front of the Razorback, the dates and records, her jiu jitsu training.It seemed like very little, considering how large the woman had grown in his life.A small newsfeed crawled down the terminals left side.The war between Mars and the Belt escalated, incident after incident, but the secession of Ceres Station was the top news.Earth was taken to task by Martian commentators for failing to stand united with its fellow inner planet, or at least for not handing over the Ceres security contract to Mars.The scattershot reaction of the Belt ran the gamut from pleasure at seeing Earths influence fall back down the gravity well, to strident near panic at the loss of Ceres neutrality, to conspiracy theories that Earth was fomenting the war for its own ends.Miller reserved judgment.I always think of pews.Miller looked over.The man sitting next to him was about Millers age; the fringe of gray hair, the soft belly.The mans smile told Miller the guy was a missionary, out in the vacuum saving souls.Or maybe it was the name tag and Bible.The seats, I mean, the missionary said.They always make me think of going to church, the way theyre all lined up, row after row.Only instead of a pulpit, we have bunk beds.Our Lady of Sleeping Through It, Miller said, knowing he was getting drawn into conversation but unable to stop himself.The missionary laughed.Something like that, he said.Do you attend church?Havent in years, Miller said.I was a Methodist when I was anything.What flavor are you selling?The missionary lifted his hands in a gesture of harmlessness that went back to the African plains of the Pleistocene.I have no weapon; I seek no fight.Im just going back to Eros from a conference on Luna, he said.My proselytizing days are long behind me.I didnt think those ever ended, Miller said.They dont.Not officially.But after a few decades, you come to a place where you realize that theres really no difference between trying and not trying.I still travel.I still talk to people.Sometimes we talk about Jesus Christ.Sometimes we talk about cooking.If someone is ready to accept Christ, it doesnt take much effort on my part to help them.If they arent, no amount of hectoring them does any good.So why try?Do people talk about the war?Miller asked.Often, the missionary said.Anyone make sense of it?No.I dont believe war ever does.Its a madness thats in our nature.Sometimes it recurs; sometimes it subsides.Sounds like a disease.The herpes simplex of the species?the missionary said with a laugh.I suppose there are worse ways to think of it.Im afraid that as long as were human, it will be with us.Miller looked over at the wide, moon round face.As long as were human?he said.Some of us believe that we shall all eventually become angels, the missionary said.Not the Methodists.Even them, eventually, the man said, but they probably wont go first.And what brings you to Our Lady of Sleeping Through It?Miller sighed, sitting back against the unyielding chair.Two rows down, a young woman shouted at two boys to stop jumping on the seats and was ignored.A man behind them coughed.Miller took a long breath and let it out slowly.I was a cop on Ceres, he said.Ah.The change of contract.That, Miller said.Taking up work on Eros, then?More looking up an old friend, Miller said.Then, to his own surprise, he went on.I was born on Ceres.Lived there my whole life.This is the fifth?Yeah, fifth time Ive been off station.Do you plan to go back?No, Miller said.He sounded more certain that hed known.No, I think that part of my life is pretty much over.That must be painful, the missionary said.Miller paused, letting the comment settle.The man was right; it should have been painful.Everything hed ever had was gone.His job, his community.He wasnt even a cop anymore, his checked in luggage handgun notwithstanding.He would never eat at the little East Indian cart at the edge of sector nine again.The receptionist at the station would never nod her greeting to him as he headed in for his desk again.No more nights at the bar with the other cops, no more off color stories about busts gone weird, no more kids flying kites in the high tunnels.He probed himself like a doctor searching for inflammation.Did it hurt here?Did he feel the loss there?He didnt.There was only a sense of relief so profound it approached giddiness.Im sorry, the missionary said, confused.Did I say something funny?* * *   Eros supported a population of one and a half million, a little more than Ceres had in visitors at any given time.Roughly the shape of a potato, it had been much more difficult to spin up, and its surface velocity was considerably higher than Ceres for the same internal g.  The old shipyards protruded from the asteroid, great spiderwebs of steel and carbon mesh studded with warning lights and sensor arrays to wave off any ships that might come in too tight.The internal caverns of Eros had been the birthplace of the Belt.From raw ore to smelting furnace to annealing platform and then into the spines of water haulers and gas harvesters and prospecting ships.Eros had been a port of call in the first generation of humanitys expansion.From there, the sun itself was only a bright star among billions.The economics of the Belt had moved on.Ceres Station had spun up with newer docks, more industrial backing, more people.The commerce of shipping moved to Ceres, while Eros remained a center of ship manufacture and repair.The results were as predictable as physics.On Ceres, a longer time in dock meant lost money, and the berth fee structure reflected that.On Eros, a ship might wait for weeks or months without impeding the flow of traffic.If a crew wanted a place to relax, to stretch, to get away from one another for a while, Eros was the port of call.And with the lower docking fees, Eros Station found other ways to soak money from its visitors: Casinos.Brothels.Shooting galleries.Vice in all its commercial forms found a home in Eros, its local economy blooming like a fungus fed by the desires of Belters.A happy accident of orbital mechanics put Miller there half a day ahead of the Rocinante.He walked through the cheap casinos, the opioid bars and sex clubs, the show fight areas where men or women pretended to beat one another senseless for the pleasure of the crowds.Miller imagined Julie walking with him, her sly smile matching his own as he read the great animated displays.RANDOLPH MAK, HOLDER OF THE BELT FREEFIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP FOR SIX YEARS, AGAINST MARTIAN KIVRIN CARMICHAEL IN A FIGHT TO THE DEATH!Surely not fixed, Julie said drily in his mind.Wonder which ones going to win, he thought, and imagined her laughing.Hed stopped at a noodle cart, two new yens worth of egg noodles in black sauce steaming in their cone, when a hand clapped on his shoulder.Detective Miller, a familiar voice said.I think youre outside your jurisdiction.Why, Inspector Sematimba, Miller said.As I live and breathe.You give a girl the shakes, sneaking up like that.Sematimba laughed.He was a tall man, even among Belters, with the darkest skin Miller had ever seen.Years before, Sematimba and Miller had coordinated on a particularly ugly case.A smuggler with a cargo of designer euphorics had broken with his supplier.Three people on Ceres had been caught in the crossfire, and the smuggler had shipped out for Eros.The traditional competitiveness and insularity of the stations respective security forces had almost let the perp slip away.Only Miller and Sematimba had been willing to coordinate outside the corporate channels.What brings you, Sematimba said, leaning against a thin steel railing and gesturing at the tunnel, to the navel of the Belt, the glory and power that is Eros?Following up on a lead, Miller said.Theres nothing good here, Sematimba said.Ever since Protogen pulled out, things have been going from bad to worse.Miller sucked up a noodle.Whos the new contract?he asked.CPM, Sematimba said.Never heard of them.Carne Por la Machina, Sematimba said, and pulled a face: exaggerated bluff masculinity.He thumped his breast and growled, then let the imitation go and shook his head.New corporation out of Luna.Mostly Belters on the ground.Make themselves out to be all hard core, but theyre mostly amateurs.All bluster, no balls.Protogen was inner planets, and that was a problem, but they were serious as hell.They broke heads, but they kept the peace.These new assholes?Most corrupt bunch of thugs Ive ever worked for.I dont think the board of governors is going to renew when the contracts up.I didnt say that, but its true.Ive got an old partner signed up with Protogen, Miller said.Theyre not bad, Sematimba said.Almost wish Id picked them in the divorce, you know?Why didnt you?Miller asked.You know how it is.Im from here.Yeah, Miller said.So.You didnt know who was running the playhouse?You arent here looking for work.Nope, Miller said.Im on sabbatical.Doing some travel for myself these days.Youve got money for that?Not really.But I dont mind going on the cheap.For a while, you know.You heard anything about a Juliette Mao?Goes by Julie?Sematimba shook his head.Mao Kwikowski Mercantile, Miller said.Came up the well and went native.OPA.It was an abduction case.Was?Miller leaned back.His imagined Julie raised her eyebrows.Its changed a little since I got it, Miller said.May be connected to something.Kind of big.How big are we talking about?
