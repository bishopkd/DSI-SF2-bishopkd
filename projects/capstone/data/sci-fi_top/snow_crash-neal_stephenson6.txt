Hyponarx you can get at any Buy 'n' Fly, people call them rusty nails, they are cheap and dull.Supposedly the needles of poor black diabetics and junkies.Ultra Laminars and Mosquitos are hip, you get them around fancy Burbclaves, they don't hurt as much when you stick them in, and they have better design.You know, ergonomic plungers, hip color schemes.What drug were they injecting?Checkitout, Y. T.  says, and holds up one of the vials toward Ng.Then it occurs to her that he can't exactly turn his head to look.Where do I hold it so you can see it?she says.Ng sings a little song.A robot arm unfolds itself from the ceiling of the van, crisply yanks the vial from her hand, swings it around, and holds it in front of a video camera set into the dashboard.The typewritten label stuck onto the vial says, just Testosterone.Ha ha, a false alarm, Ng says.The van suddenly rips forward, starts heading right into the middle of the Sacrifice Zone.Want to tell me what's going on?Y. T.  says, since I have to actually do the work in this outfit?Cell walls, Ng says.The detector finds any chemical that penetrates cell walls.So we homed in naturally on a source of testosterone.A red herring.How amusing.You see, our biochemists lead sheltered lives, did not anticipate that some people would be so mentally warped as to use hormones like they were some kind of drug.How bizarre.Y. T.  smiles to herself.She really likes the idea of living in a world where someone like Ng can get off calling someone else bizarre.What are you looking for?Snow Crash, Ng says.Instead, we found the Ring of Seventeen.Snow Crash is the drug that comes in the little tubes, Y. T.  says.I know that.What's the Ring of Seventeen?One of those crazy new rock groups that kids listen to nowadays?Snow Crash penetrates the walls of brain cells and goes to the nucleus where the DNA is stored.So for purposes of this mission, we developed a detector that would enable us to find cell wall penetrating compounds in the air.But we didn't count on heaps of empty testosterone vials being scattered all over the place.All steroidsartificial hormonesshare the same basic structure, a ring of seventeen atoms that acts like a magic key that allows them to pass through cell walls.That's why steroids are such powerful substances when they are unleashed in the human body.They can go deep inside the cell, into the nucleus, and actually change the way the cell functions.To summarize: the detector is useless.A stealthy approach will not work.So we go back to the original plan.You buy some Snow Crash and throw it up in the air.Y. T.  doesn't quite understand that last part yet.But she shuts up for a while, because in her opinion, Ng needs to pay more attention to his driving.Once they get out of that really creepy part, most of the Sacrifice Zone turns out to consist of a wilderness of dry brown weeds and large abandoned hunks of metal.There are big heaps of shit rising up from place to placecoal or slag or coke or smelt or something.Every time they come around a corner, they encounter a little plantation of vegetables, tended by Asians or South Americans.Y. T.  gets the impression that Ng wants to just run them over, but he always changes his mind at the last instant and swerves around them.Some Spanish speaking blacks are playing baseball on a broad flat area, using the round lids of fifty five gallon drums as bases.They have parked half a dozen old beaters around the edges of the field and turned on their headlights to provide illumination.Nearby is a bar built into a crappy mobile home, marked with a graffiti sign: THE SACRIFICE ZONE.Lines of boxcars are stranded in a yard of rusted over railway spurs, nopal growing between the ties.One of the boxcars has been turned into a Reverend Wayne's Pearly Gates franchise, and evangelical CentroAmericans are lined up to do their penance and speak in tongues below the neon Elvis.There are no NeoAquarian Temple franchises in the Sacrifice Zone.The warehouse area is not as dirty as the first place we went, Ng says reassuringly, so the fact that you can't use the toxics mask won't be so bad.You may smell some Chill fumes.Y. T.  does a double take at this new phenomenon: Ng using the street name for a controlled substance.You mean Freon?she says.Yes.The man who is the object of our inquiry is horizontally diversified.That is, he deals in a number of different substances.But he got his start in Freon.He is the biggest Chill wholesaler/retailer on the West Coast.Finally, Y. T.  gets it.Ng's van is air conditioned.Not with one of those shitty ozone safe air conditioners, but with the real thing, a heavy metal, high capacity, bone chilling Frigidaire blizzard blaster.It must use an incredible amount of Freon.For all practical purposes, that air conditioner is a part of Ng's body.Y. T.'s driving around with the world's only Freon junkie.You buy your supply of Chill from this guy?Until now, yes.But for the future, I have an arrangement with someone else.Someone else.The Mafia.They are approaching the waterfront.Dozens of long, skinny, single story warehouses run parallel down toward the water.They all share the same access road at this end.Smaller roads run between them, down toward where the piers used to be.Abandoned tractor trailers are scattered around from place to place.Ng pulls his van off the access road, into a little nook that is partly concealed between an old red brick power station and a stack of rusted out shipping containers.He gets it turned around so it's pointed out of here, kind of like he is expecting to leave rapidly.There's money in the storage compartment in front of you, Ng says.Y. T.  opens the glove compartment, as anyone else would call it, and finds a thick bundle of worn out, dirty, trillion dollar bills.Ed Meeses.Jeez, couldn't you get any Gippers?This is kind of bulky.This is more the kind of thing that a Kourier would pay with.Because we're all pond scum, right?No comment.What is this, a quadrillion dollars?One and a half quadrillion.Inflation, you know.What do I do?Fourth warehouse on the left, Ng says.When you get the tube, throw it up in the air.Then what?Everything else will be taken care of.Y. T.  has her doubts about that.But if she gets in trouble, well, she can always whip out those dog tags.While Y. T.  climbs down out of the van with her skateboard, Ng makes new sounds with his mouth.She hears a gliding and clunking noise resonating through the frame of the van, machinery coming to life.Turning back to look, she sees that a steel cocoon on the roof of the van has opened up.There is a miniature helicopter underneath it, all folded up.Its rotor blades spread themselves apart, like a butterfly unfolding.Its name is painted on its side: WHIRLWIND REAPER.32  It's pretty obvious which warehouse we are looking for here.Fourth one on the left, the road that runs down toward the waterfront is blocked off by several shipping containersthe big steel boxes you see on the backs of eighteen wheelers.They are arranged in a herringbone pattern, so that in order to get past them you have to slalom back and forth half a dozen times, passing through a narrow mazelike channel between high walls of steel.Guys with guns are perched on top, looking down at Y. T.  as she guides her plank through the obstacle course.By the time she makes it out into the clear, she's been heavily checked out.There is the occasional light bulb on a wire strung around, and even a couple of strings of Christmas tree lights.These are switched on, just to make her feel a little more welcome.She can't see anything, just lights making colored halos amid a generalized cloud of dust and fog.In front of her, access to the waterfront is blocked off by another maze of shipping containers.One of them has a graffiti sign: THE UKOD SEZ: TRY SOME COUNTDOWN TODAY!What's the UKOD?she says, just to break the ice a little.Undisputed King of the Ozone Destroyers, says a man's voice.He is just in the act of jumping down from the loading dock of the warehouse to her left.Back inside the warehouse, Y. T.  can see electric lights and glowing cigarettes.That's what we call Emilio.Oh, right, Y. T.  says.The Freon guy.I'm not here for Chill.Well, says the guy, a tall rangy dude in his forties, much too skinny to be forty years old.He yanks the butt of a cigarette from his mouth and throws it away like a dart.What'll it be, then?What does Snow Crash cost?One point seven five Gippers, the guy says.I thought it was one point five, Y. T.  says.The guy shakes his head.Inflation, you know.Still, it's a bargain.Hell, that plank you're on is probably worth a hundred Gippers.You can't even buy these for dollars, Y. T.  says, getting her back up.Look, all I've got is one and a half quadrillion dollars.She pulls the bundle out of her pocket.The guy laughs, shakes his head, hollers back to his colleagues inside the warehouse.You guys, we got a chick here who wants to pay in Meeses.Better get rid of 'em fast, honey, says a sharper, nastier voice, or get yourself a wheelbarrow.It's an even older guy with a bald head, curly hair on the sides, and a paunch.He's standing up on the loading dock.If you're not going to take it, just say so, Y. T.  says.All of this chatter has nothing to do with business.We don't get chicks back here very often, the fat bald old guy says.Y. T.  knows that this must be the UKOD himself.So we'll give you a discount for being spunky.Turn around.Fuck you, Y. T.  says.She's not going to turn around for this guy.Everyone within earshot laughs.Okay, do it, the UKOD says.The tall skinny guy goes back over to the loading dock and hauls an aluminum briefcase down, sets it on top of a steel drum in the middle of the road so that it's at about waist height.Pay first, he says.She hands him the Meeses.He examines the bundle, sneers, throws it back into the warehouse with a sudden backhand motion.All the guys inside laugh some more.He opens up the briefcase, revealing the little computer keyboard.He shoves his ID card into the slot, types on it for a couple of seconds.He unsnaps a tube from the top of the briefcase, places it into the socket in the bottom part.The machine draws it inside, does something, spits it back out.He hands the tube to Y. T.  The red numbers on top are counting down from ten.When it gets down to one, hold it up to your nose and start inhaling, the guy says.She's already backing away from him.You got a problem, little girl?he says.Not yet, she says.Then she throws the tube up in the air as hard as she can.The chop of the rotor blades comes out of nowhere.The Whirlwind Reaper blurs over their heads; everyone crouches for an instant as surprise buckles their knees.The tube does not come back to earth.You fucking bitch, the skinny guy says.That was a really cool plan, the UKOD says, but the part I can't figure out is, why would a nice, smart girl like you participate in a suicide mission?The sun comes out.About half a dozen suns, actually, all around them up in the air, so that there are no shadows.The faces of the skinny man and the UKOD look flat and featureless under this blinding illumination.Y. T.  is the only person who can see worth a damn because her Knight Visions have compensated for it; the men wince and sag beneath the light.Y. T.  turns to look behind herself.One of the miniature suns is hanging above the maze of shipping containers, casting light into all its crannies, blinding the gunmen who stand guard there.The scene flashes too light and too dark as her goggles' electronics try to make up their mind.But in the midst of this whole visual tangle she gets one image printed indelibly on her retina: the gunmen going down like a treeline in a hurricane, and for just an instant, a line of dark angular things silhouetted above the maze as they crest it like a cybernetic tsunami.Rat Things.They have evaded the whole maze by leaping over it in long, flat parabolas.Along the way, some of them have slammed right through the bodies of men holding guns, like NFL fullbacks plowing full speed through nerdy sideline photographers.Then, as they land on the road in front of the maze, there is an instant burst of dust with frantic white sparks dancing around at the bottom, and while all this is happening, Y. T.  doesn't hear, she feels one of the Rat Things impacting on the body of the tall skinny guy, hears his ribs crackling like a ball of cellophane.Hell is already breaking loose inside the warehouse, but her eyes are trying to follow the action, watching the sparks and dust contrails of more Rat Things drawing themselves down the length of the road in an instant and then going airborne to the top of the next barrier.Three seconds have passed since she threw the tube into the air.She is turning back to look inside the warehouse.But someone's on top of the warehouse, catching her eye for a second.It's another gunman, a sniper, stepping out from behind an air conditioning unit, just getting used to the light, raising his weapon to his shoulder.Y. T.  winces as a red laser beam from his rifle sweeps across her eyes once, twice as he zeroes his sights on her forehead.Behind him she sees the Whirlwind Reaper, its rotors making a disk under the brilliant light, a disk that is foreshortened into a narrow ellipse and then into a steady silver line.Then it flies right past the sniper.The chopper pulls up into a hard turn, searching for additional prey, and something falls beneath it in a powerless trajectory, she thinks that it has dropped a bomb.But it's the head of the sniper, spinning rapidly, throwing out a fine pink helix under the light.The little chopper's rotor blade must have caught him in the nape of the neck.One part of her is dispassionately watching the head bounce and spin in the dust, and the other part of her is screaming her lungs out.She hears a crack, the first loud noise so far.She turns to follow the sound, looking in the direction of a water tower that looms above this area, providing a fine vantage point for a sniper.But then her attention is drawn by the pencil thin blue white exhaust of a tiny rocket that lances up into the sky from Ng's van.It doesn't do anything; it just goes up to a certain height and hovers, sitting on its exhaust.She doesn't care, she's kicking her way down the road now on her plank, trying to get something between her and that water tower.There is a second cracking noise.Before this sound even reaches her ears, the rocket darts horizontally like a minnow, makes one or two minor cuts to correct its course, zeroes in on that sniper's perch, up in the water tower's access ladder.There is a great nasty explosion without any flame or light, like the loud pointless booms that you get sometimes at fireworks shows.For a moment, she can hear the clamor of shrapnel ringing through the ironwork of the water tower.Just before she kicks her way back into the maze, a dustline whips past her, snapping rocks and fragments of broken glass into her face.It shoots into the maze.She hears it Ping Pong all the way through, kicking off the steel walls in order to change direction.It's a Rat Thing clearing the way for her.How sweet!Smooth move, Ex Lax, she says, climbing back into Ng's van.Her throat feels thick and swollen.Maybe it's from screaming, maybe it's the toxic waste, maybe she's getting ready to gag.Didn't you know about the snipers?she says.If she can keep talking about the details of the job, maybe she can keep her mind off of what the Whirlwind Reaper did.I didn't know about the one on the water tower, Ng says.But as soon as he fired a couple of rounds, we plotted the bullets' trajectories on millimeter wave and back traced them.He talks to his van and it pulls out of its hiding place, headed for I 405.Seems like kind of an obvious place to look for a sniper.He was in an unfortified position, exposed from all sides, Ng says.He chose to work from a suicidal position.Which is not a typical behavior for drug dealers.Typically, they are more pragmatic.Now, do you have any other criticisms of my performance?Well, did it work?Yes.The tube was inserted into a sealed chamber inside the helicopter before it discharged its contents.It was then flash frozen in liquid helium before it could chemically self destruct.We now have a sample of Snow Crash, something that no one else has been able to get.It is the kind of success on which reputations such as mine are constructed.How about the Rat Things?How about them?Are they back in the van now?Back there?Y. T.  jerks her head aft.Ng pauses for a moment.Y. T.  reminds herself that he is sitting in his office in Vietnam in 1955 watching all of this on TV.Three of them are back, Ng says.Three are on their way back.And three of them I left behind to carry out additional pacification measures.You're leaving them behind?They'll catch up, Ng says.On a straightaway, they can run at seven hundred miles per hour.Is it true they have nuke stuff inside of them?Radiothermal isotopes.What happens if one gets busted open?Everyone gets all mutated?If you ever find yourself in the presence of a destructive force powerful enough to decapsulate those isotopes, Ng says, radiation sickness will be the least of your worries.Will they be able to find their way back to us?Didn't you ever watch Lassie Come Home when you were a child?he asks.Or rather, more of a child than you are now?So.She was right.The Rat Things are made from dog parts.That's cruel, she says.This brand of sentimentalism is very predictable, Ng says.To take a dog out of his bodykeep him in a hutch all the time.When the Rat Thing, as you call it, is in his hutch, do you know what he's doing?Licking his electric nuts?Chasing Frisbees through the surf.Forever.Eating steaks that grow on trees.Lying beside the fire in a hunting lodge.I haven't installed any testicle licking simulations yet, but now that you have brought it up, I shall consider it.What about when he's out of the hutch, running around doing errands for you?Can't you imagine how liberating it is for a pit bullterrier to be capable of running seven hundred miles an hour?Y. T.  doesn't answer.She is too busy trying to get her mind around this concept.Your mistake, Ng says, is that you think that all mechanically assisted organismslike meare pathetic cripples.In fact, we are better than we were before.Where do you get the pit bulls from?An incredible number of them are abandoned every day, in cities all over the place.You cut up pound puppies?We save abandoned dogs from certain extinction and send them to what amounts to dog heaven.My friend Roadkill and I had a pit bull.Fido.We found it in an alley.Some asshole had shot it in the leg.We had a vet fix it up.We kept it in this empty apartment in Roadkill's building for a few months, played with it every day, brought it food.And then one day we came to play with Fido, and he was gone.Someone broke in and took him away.Probably sold him to a research lab.Probably, Ng says, but that's no way to keep a dog.It's better than the way he was living before.There's a break in the conversation as Ng occupies himself with talking to his van, maneuvering onto the Long Beach Freeway, headed back into town.Do they remember stuff?Y. T.  says.To the extent dogs can remember anything, Ng says.We don't have any way of erasing memories.So maybe Fido is a Rat Thing somewhere, right now.I would hope so, for his sake, Ng says.In a Mr.Lee's Greater Hong Kong franchise in Phoenix, Arizona, Ng Security Industries Semi Autonomous Guard Unit B 782 comes awake.The factory that put him together thinks of him as a robot named Number B 782.But he thinks of himself as a pit bullterrier named Fido.In the old days, Fido was a bad little doggie sometimes.But now, Fido lives in a nice little house in a nice little yard.Now he has become a nice little doggie.He likes to lie in his house and listen to the other nice doggies bark.Fido is part of a big pack.Tonight there is a lot of barking from a place far away.When he listens to this barking, Fido knows that a whole pack of nice doggies is very excited about something.A lot of very bad men are trying to hurt a nice girl.This has made the doggies very angry and excited.In order to protect the nice girl, they are hurting some of the bad men.Which is as it should be.Fido does not come out of his house.When he first heard the barking, he became excited.He likes nice girls, and it makes him especially upset when bad men try to hurt them.Once there was a nice girl who loved him.That was before, when he lived in a scary place and he was always hungry and many people were bad to him.But the nice girl loved him and was good to him.Fido loves the nice girl very much.But he can tell from the barking of the other doggies that the nice girl is safe now.So he goes back to sleep.33  'Scuse me, pod, Y. T.  says, stepping into the Babel/Infocalypse room.Jeez!This place looks like one of those things full of snow that you shake up.Hi, Y. T.   Got some more intel for you, pod.Shoot.Snow Crash is a roid.Or else it's similar to a roid.Yeah, that's it.It goes into your cell walls, just like a roid.And then it does something to the nucleus of the cell.You were right, Hiro says to the Librarian, just like herpes.This guy I was talking to said that it fucks with your actual DNA.I don't know what half of this shit means, but that's what he said.Who's this guy you were talking to?Ng.Of Ng Security Industries.Don't bother talking to him, he won't give you any intel, she says dismissively.Why are you hanging out with a guy like Ng?Mob job.The Mafia has a sample of the drug for the first time, thanks to me and my pal Ng.Until now, it always self destructed before they could get to it.So I guess they're analyzing it or something.Trying to make an antidote, maybe.Or trying to reproduce it.The Mafia wouldn't do that.Don't be a sap, Hiro says.Of course they would.Y. T.  seems miffed at Hiro.Look, he says, I'm sorry for reminding you of this, but if we still had laws, the Mafia would be a criminal organization.But we don't have laws, she says, so it's just another chain.Fine, all I'm saying is, they may not be doing this for the benefit of humanity.And why are you in here, holed up with this geeky daemon?she says, gesturing at the Librarian.For the benefit of humanity?Or because you're chasing a piece of ass?Whatever her name is.Okay, okay, let's not talk about the Mafia anymore, Hiro says.I have work to do.So do I.  Y. T.  zaps out again, leaving a hole in the Metaverse that is quickly filled in by Hiro's computer.I think she may have a crush on me, Hiro explains.She seemed quite affectionate, the Librarian says.Okay, Hiro says, back to work.Where did Asherah come from?Originally from Sumerian mythology.Hence, she is also important in Babylonian, Assyrian, Canaanite, Hebrew, and Ugaritic myths, which are all descended from the Sumerian.Interesting.So the Sumerian language died out, but the Sumerian myths were somehow passed on in the new languages.Correct.Sumerian was used as the language of religion and scholarship by later civilizations, much as Latin was used in Europe during the Middle Ages.No one spoke it as their native language, but educated people could read it.In this way, Sumerian religion was passed on.And what did Asherah do in Sumerian myths?The accounts are fragmentary.Few tablets have been discovered, and these are broken and scattered.It is thought that L.  Bob Rife has excavated many intact tablets, but he refuses to release them.The surviving Sumerian myths exist in fragments and have a bizarre quality.Lagos compared them to the imaginings of a febrile two year old.Entire sections of them simply cannot be translatedthe characters are legible and well known, but when put together they do not say anything that leaves an imprint on the modern mind.Like instructions for programming a VCR.There is a great deal of monotonous repetition.There is also a fair amount of what Lagos described as Rotary Club Boosterism'scribes extolling the superior virtue of their city over some other city.What makes one Sumerian city better than another one?A bigger ziggurat?A better football team?Better me.What are me?Rules or principles that control the operation of society, like a code of laws, but on a more fundamental level.I don't get it.That is the point.Sumerian myths are not readable' or enjoyable' in the same sense that Greek and Hebrew myths are.They reflect a fundamentally different consciousness from ours.I suppose if our culture was based on Sumer, we would find them more interesting, Hiro says.Akkadian myths came after the Sumerian and are clearly based on Sumerian myths to a large extent.It is clear that Akkadian redactors went through the Sumerian myths, edited out the (to us) bizarre and incomprehensible parts, and strung them together into longer works, such as the Epic of Gilgamesh.The Akkadians were Semitescousins of the Hebrews.What do the Akkadians have to say about her?She is a goddess of the erotic and of fertility.She also has a destructive, vindictive side.In one myth, Kirta, a human king, is made grievously ill by Asherah.Only El, king of the gods, can heal him.El gives certain persons the privilege of nursing at Asherah's breasts.El and Asherah often adopt human babies and let them nurse on Asherahin one text, she is wet nurse to seventy divine sons.Spreading that virus, Hiro says.Mothers with AIDS can spread the disease to their babies by breast feeding them.But this is the Akkadian version, right?Yes, sir.I want to hear some Sumerian stuff, even if it is untranslatable.Would you like to hear how Asherah made Enki sick?Sure.How this story is translated depends on how it is interpreted.Some see it as a Fall from Paradise story.Some see it as a battle between male and female or water and earth.Some see it as a fertility allegory.This reading is based on the interpretation of Bendt Alster.Duly noted.To summarize: Enki and Ninhursagwho is Asherah, although in this story she also bears other epithetslive in a place called Dilmun.Dilmun is pure, clean and bright, there is no sickness, people do not grow old, predatory animals do not hunt.But there is no water.So Ninhursag pleads with Enki, who is a sort of water god, to bring water to Dilmun.He does so by masturbating among the reeds of the ditches and letting flow his life giving sementhe water of the heart,' as it is called.At the same time, he pronounces a nam shub forbidding anyone to enter this areahe does not want anyone to come near his semen.Why not?The myth does not say.Then, Hiro says, he must have thought it was valuable, or dangerous, or both.Dilmun is now better than it was before.The fields produce abundant crops and so on.Excuse me, but how did Sumerian agriculture work?Did they use a lot of irrigation?They were entirely dependent upon it.So Enki was responsible, according to this myth, for irrigating the fields with his water of the heart. 'Enki was the water god, yes.Okay, go on.But NinhursagAsherahviolates his decree and takes Enki's semen and impregnates herself.After nine days of pregnancy she gives birth, painlessly, to a daughter, Ninmu.Ninmu walks on the riverbank.Enki sees her, becomes inflamed, goes across the river, and has sex with her.With his own daughter.Yes.She has another daughter nine days later, named Ninkurra, and the pattern is repeated.Enki has sex with Ninkurra, too?Yes, and she has a daughter named Uttu.Now, by this time, Ninhursag has apparently recognized a pattern in Enki's behavior, and so she advises Uttu to stay in her house, predicting that Enki will then approach her bearing gifts, and try to seduce her.Does he?Enki once again fills the ditches with the water of the heart,' which makes things grow.The gardener re joices and embraces Enki.Who's the gardener?Just some character in the story, the Librarian says.He provides Enki with grapes and other gifts.Enki disguises himself as the gardener and goes to Uttu and seduces her.But this time, Ninhursag manages to obtain a sample of Enki's semen from Uttu's thighs.My God.Talk about your mother in law from hell.Ninhursag spreads the semen on the ground, and it causes eight plants to sprout up.Does Enki have sex with the plants, then?No, he eats themin some sense, he learns their secrets by doing so.So here we have our Adam and Eve motif.Ninhursag curses Enki, saying Until thou art dead, I shall not look upon thee with the eye of life.  'Then she disappears, and Enki becomes very ill.Eight of his organs become sick, one for each of the plants.Finally, Ninhursag is persuaded to come back.She gives birth to eight deities, one for each part of Enki's body that is sick, and Enki is healed.These deities are the pantheon of Dilmun; i. e. , this act breaks the cycle of incest and creates a new race of male and female gods that can reproduce normally.I'm beginning to see what Lagos meant about the febrile two year old.Alster interprets the myth as an exposition of a logical problem: Supposing that originally there was nothing but one creator, how could ordinary binary sexual relations come into being?'Ah, there's that word binary' again.You may remember an unexplored fork earlier in our conversation that would have brought us to this same place by another route.This myth can be compared to the Sumerian creation myth, in which heaven and earth are united to begin with, but the world is not really created until the two are separated.Most Creation myths begin with a paradoxical unity of everything, evaluated either as chaos or as Paradise,' and the world as we know it does not really come into being until this is changed.I should point out here that Enki's original name was En Kur, Lord of Kur.Kur was a primeval oceanChaosthat Enki conquered.Every hacker can identify with that.But Asherah has similar connotations.Her name in Ugaritic, atiratu yammi' means she who treads on (the) sea (dragon). 'Okay, so both Enki and Asherah were figures who had in some sense defeated chaos.And your point is that this defeat of chaos, the separation of the static, unified world into a binary system, is identified with creation.Correct.What else can you tell me about Enki?He was the en of the city of Eridu.What's an en?Is that like a king?A priest king of sorts.The en was the custodian of the local temple, where the methe rules of the societywere stored on clay tablets.Okay.Where's Eridu?Southern Iraq.It has only been excavated within the past few years.By Rife's people?Yes.As Kramer has it, Enki is the god of wisdombut this is a bad translation.His wisdom is not the wisdom of an old man, but rather a knowledge of how to do things, especially occult things.He astonishes even the other gods with shocking solutions to apparently impossible problems. 'He is a sympathetic god for the most part, who assists humankind.Really!Yes.The most important Sumerian myths center on him.As I mentioned, he is associated with water.He fills the rivers, and the extensive Sumerian canal system, with his life giving semen.He is said to have created the Tigris in a single epochal act of masturbation.He describes himself as follows: I am lord.I am the one whose word endures.I am eternal. 'Others describe him: a word from youand heaps and piles stack high with grain. 'You bring down the stars of heaven, you have computed their number. 'He pronounces the name of everything created ...Pronounces the name of everything created?'In many Creation myths, to name a thing is to create it.He is referred to, in various myths, as expert who instituted incantations,' word rich,' Enki, master of all the right commands,' as Kramer and Maier have it, His word can bring order where there had been only chacs and introduce disorder where there had been harmony. 'He devotes a great deal of effort to imparting his knowledge to his son, the god Marduk, chief deity of the Babylonians.So the Sumerians worshipped Enki, and the Babylonians, who came after the Sumerians, worshipped Marduk, his son.Yes, sir.And whenever Marduk got stuck, he would ask his father Enki for help.There is a representation of Marduk here on this stelethe Code of Hammurabi.According to Hammurabi, the Code was given to him personally by Marduk.Hiro wanders over to the Code of Hammurabi and has a gander.The cuneiform means nothing to him, but the illustration on top is easy enough to understand.Especially the part in the middle:      Why, exactly, is Marduk handing Hammurabi a one and a zero in this picture?Hiro asks.They were emblems of royal power, the Librarian says.Their origin is obscure.Enki must have been responsible for that one, Hiro says.Enki's most important role is as the creator and guardian of the me and the gis hur, the key words' and patterns' that rule the universe.Tell me more about the me.To quote Kramer and Maier again, [They believed in] the existence from time primordial of a fundamental, unalterable, comprehensive assortment of powers and duties, norms and standards, rules and regulations, known as me, relating to the cosmos and its components, to gods and humans, to cities and countries, and to the varied aspects of civilized life. 'Kind of like the Torah.Yes, but they have a kind of mystical or magical force.And they often deal with banal subjectsnot just religion.Examples?In one myth, the goddess Inanna goes to Eridu and tricks Enki into giving her ninety four me and brings them back to her home town of Uruk, where they are greeted with much commotion and rejoicing.Inanna is the person that Juanita's obsessed with.Yes, sir.She is hailed as a savior because she brought the perfect execution of the me. 'Execution?Like executing a computer program?Yes.Apparently, they are like algorithms for carrying out certain activities essential to the society.Some of them have to do with the workings of priesthood and kingship.Some explain how to carry out religious ceremonies.Some relate to the arts of war and diplomacy.Many of them are about the arts and crafts: music, carpentry, smithing, tanning, building, farming, even such simple tasks as lighting fires.The operating system of society.I'm sorry?When you first turn on a computer, it is an inert collection of circuits that can't really do anything.To start up the machine, you have to infuse those circuits with a collection of rules that tell it how to function.How to be a computer.It sounds as though these me served as the operating system of the society, organizing an inert collection of people into a functioning system.As you wish.In any case, Enki was the guardian of the me.So he was a good guy, really.He was the most beloved of the gods.He sounds like kind of a hacker.Which makes his nam shub very difficult to understand.If he was such a nice guy, why did he do the Babel thing?This is considered to be one of the mysteries of Enki.As you have noticed, his behavior was not always consistent with modern norms.I don't buy that.I don't think he actually fucked his sister, daughter, and so on.That story has to be a metaphor for something else.I think it is a metaphor for some kind of recursive informational process.This whole myth stinks of it.To these people, water equals semen.Makes sense, because they probably had no concept of pure waterit was all brown and muddy and full of viruses anyway.But from a modern standpoint, semen is just a carrier of informationboth benevolent sperm and malevolent viruses.Enki's waterhis semen, his data, his meflow throughout the country of Sumer and cause it to flourish.As you may be aware, Sumer existed on the flood plain between two major rivers, the Tigris and the Euphrates.This is where all the clay came fromthey took it directly from the riverbeds.So Enki even provided them with their medium for conveying informationclay.They wrote on wet clay and then they dried it outgot rid of the water.If water got to it later, the information was destroyed.But if they baked it and drove out all the water, sterilized Enki's semen with heat, then the tablet lasted forever, immutable, like the words of the Torah.Do I sound like a maniac?I don't know, the Librarian says, but you do sound a little like Lagos.I'm thrilled.Next thing you know, I'll turn myself into a gargoyle.34  Any ped can get into Griffith Park without being noticed.And Y. T.  figures that despite the barriers across the road, the Falabala camp isn't too well protected, if you've got off road capability.For a skate ninja on a brand new plank in a brand new pair of Knight Visions (hey, you have to spend money to make money) there will be no problem.Just find a high embankment that ramps down into the canyon, skirt the edge until you see those campfires down below.And then lean down that hill.Trust gravity.She realizes halfway down that her blue and orange coverall, fly as it may be, is going to be a real attention getter in the middle of the night in the Falabala zone, so she reaches up to her collar, feels a hard disk sewn into the fabric, presses it between thumb and finger until it clicks.Her coverall darkens, the colors shimmer through the electropigment like an oil slick, and then it's black.On her first visit she didn't check this place out all that carefully because she hoped she'd never come back.So the embankment turns out to be taller and steeper than Y. T.  remembered.Maybe a little more of a cliff, drop off, or abyss than she thought.Only thing that makes her think so is that she seems to be doing a lot of free fall work here.Major plummeting.Big time ballistic styling.That's cool, it's all part of the job, she tells herself.The smartwheels are good for it.The tree trunks are bluish black, standing out not so well against a blackish blue background.The only other thing she can see is the red laser light of the digital speedometer down on the front of her plank, which is not showing any real information.The numbers have vibrated themselves into a cloud of gritty red light as the radar speed sensor tries to lock onto something.She turns the speedometer off.Running totally black now.Precipitating her way toward the sweet 'crete of the creek bottom like a black angel who has just had the shroud lines of her celestial parachute severed by the Almighty.And when the wheels finally meet the pavement, it just about drives her knees up through her jawbone.She finishes the whole gravitational transaction with not much altitude and a nasty head of dark velocity.Mental note: Next time just jump off a fucking bridge.That way there's no question of getting an invisible cholla shoved up your nose.She whips around a corner, heeled over so far she could lick the yellow line, and her Knight Visions reveal all in a blaze of multispectral radiation.On infrared, the Falabala encampment is a turbulating aurora of pink fog punctuated by the white hot bursts of campfires.All of it rests on dim bluish pavement, which means, in the false color scheme of things, that it's cold.Behind everything is the jagged horizon line of that funky improvised barrier technology that the Falabalas are so good at.A barrier that has been completely spurned, snubbed, and confounded by Y. T. , who dropped out of the sky into the middle of the camp like a Stealth fighter with an inferiority complex.Once you're into the actual encampment, people don't really notice or care who you are.A couple people see her, watch her slide on by, don't get all hairy about it.They probably get a lot of Kouriers coming through here.A lot of dippy, gullible, Kool Aid drinking couriers.And these people aren't hip enough to tell Y. T.  apart from that breed.But that's okay, she'll pass for now, as long as they don't check out the detailing on her new plank.The campfires provide enough plain old regular visible light to show this sorry affair for what it is: a bunch of demented Boy Scouts, a jamboree without merit badges or hygiene.With the IR supered on top of the visible, she can also see vague, spectral red faces out in the shadows where her unassisted eyes would only see darkness.These new Knight Visions cost her a big wad of her Mob drug running money.Just the kind of thing Mom had in mind when she insisted Y. T.  get a part time job.Some of the people who were here last time are gone now, and there's a few new ones she doesn't recognize.There's a couple of people actually wearing duct tape straitjackets.That's a fashion statement reserved for the ones who are totally out of control, rolling and thrashing around on the ground.And there's a few more who are spazzing out, but not as bad, and one or two who are just plain messed up, like plain old derelicts that you might see at the Snooze 'n' Cruise.Hey, look!someone says.It's our friend the Kourier!Welcome, friend!She's got her Liquid Knuckles uncapped, available, and shaken well before use.She's got high voltage, high fashion metallic cuffs around her wrists in case someone tries to grab her by same.And a bundy stunner up her sleeve.Only the most tubular throwbacks carry guns.Guns take a long time to work (you have to wait for the victim to bleed to death), but paradoxically they end up killing people pretty often.But nobody hassles you after you've hit them with a bundy stunner.At least that's what the ads say.So it's not like she exactly feels vulnerable or anything.But still, she'd like to pick her target.So she maintains escape velocity until she's found the woman who seemed friendlythe bald chick in the torn up Chanel knockoffand then zeroes in on her.Let's get off into the woods, man, Y. T.  says, I want to talk to you about what's going on with what's left of your brain.The woman smiles, struggles to her feet with the good natured awkwardness of a retarded person in a good mood.I like to talk about that, she says.Because I believe in it.Y. T.  doesn't stop to do a lot of talking, just grabs the woman by the hand, starts leading her uphill, into the scrubby little trees, away from the road.She doesn't see any pink faces lurking up here in the infrared, it ought to be safe.But there are a couple behind her, just ambling along pleasantly, not looking directly at her, like they just decided it was time to go for a stroll in the woods in the middle of the night.One of them is the High Priest.The woman's probably in her mid twenties, she's a tall gangly type, nice  but not good looking, probably was a spunky but low scoring forward on her high school basketball team.Y. T.  sits her down on a rock out in the darkness.Do you have any idea where you are?Y. T.  says.In the park, the woman says, with my friends.We're helping to spread the Word.How'd you get here?From the Enterprise.That's where we go to learn things.You mean, like, the Raft?The Enterprise Raft?Is that where you guys all came from?I don't know where we came from, the woman says.Sometimes it's hard to remember stuff.But that's not important.Where were you before?You didn't grow up on the Raft, did you?I was a systems programmer for 3verse Systems in Mountain View, California, the woman says, suddenly whipping off a string of perfect, normal sounding English.Then how did you get to be on the Raft?I don't know.My old life stopped.My new life started.Now I'm here.Back to baby talk.What's the last thing you remember before your old life stopped?I was working late.My computer was having problems.That's it?That's the last normal thing that happened to you?My system crashed, she said.I saw static.And then I became very sick.I went to the hospital.And there in the hospital, I met a man who explained everything to me.He explained that I had been washed in the blood.That I belonged to the Word now.And suddenly it all made sense.And then I decided to go to the Raft.You decided, or someone decided for you?I just wanted to.That's where we go.Who else was on the Raft with you?More people like me.Like you how?All programmers.Like me.Who had seen the Word.Seen it on their computers?Yes.Or sometimes on TV.What did you do on the Raft?The woman pushes up one sleeve of her raggedy sweatshirt to expose a needle pocked arm.You took drugs?No.We gave blood.They sucked your blood out?Yes.Sometimes we would do a little coding.But only some of us.How long have you been here?I don't know.They move us here when our veins don't work anymore.We just do things to help spread the Worddrag stuff around, make barricades.But we don't really spend much time working.Most of the time we sing songs, pray, and tell other people about the Word.You want to leave?I can get you out of here.No, the woman says, I've never been so happy.How can you say that?You were a big time hacker.Now you're kind of a dip, if I may speak frankly.That's okay, it doesn't hurt my feelings.I wasn't really happy when I was a hacker.I never thought about the important things.God.Heaven.The things of the spirit.It's hard to think about those things in America.You just put them aside.But those are really the important thingsnot programming computers or making money.Now, that's all I think about.Y. T.  has been keeping an eye on the High Priest and his buddy.They keep moving closer, one step at a time.Now they're close enough that Y. T.  can smell their dinner.The woman puts her hand on Y. T.'s shoulder pad.I want you to stay here with me.Won't you come down and have some refreshments?You must be thirsty.Gotta run, Y. T.  says, standing up.I really have to object to that, the High Priest says, stepping forward.He doesn't say it angrily.Now he's trying to be like Y. T.'s dad.That's not really the right decision for you.What are you, a role model?That's okay.You don't have to agree.But let's go down and sit by the campfire and talk about it.Let's just get the fuck away from Y. T.  before she goes into a self defense mode, Y. T.  says.All three Falabalas step back away from her.Very cooperative.The High Priest is holding up his hands, placating her.I'm sorry if we made you feel threatened, he says.You guys just come on a little weird, Y. T.  says, flipping her goggles back onto infrared.In the infrared, she can see that the third Falabala, the one who came up here with the High Priest, is holding a small thing in one hand that is unusually warm.She nails him with her penlight, spotlighting his upper body in a narrow yellow beam.Most of him is dirty and dun colored and reflects little light.But there is a brilliant glossy red thing, a shaft of ruby.It's a hypodermic needle.It's full of red fluid.Under infrared, it shows up warm.It's fresh blood.And she doesn't exactly get itwhy these guys would be walking around with a syringe full of fresh blood.But she's seen enough.The Liquid Knuckles shoots out of the can in a long narrow neon green stream, and when it nails the needle man in the face, he jerks his head back like he's just been axed across the bridge of the nose and falls back without making a sound.Then she gives the High Priest a shot of it for good measure.The woman just stands there, totally, like, appalled.Y. T.  pumps herself up out of the canyon so fast that when she flies out into traffic, she's going about as fast as it is.As soon as she gets a solid poon on a nocturnal lettuce tanker, she gets on the phone to Mom.Mom, listen.No, Mom, never mind the roaring noise.Yes, I am riding my skateboard in traffic.But listen to me for a second, Mom  She has to hang up on the old bitch.It's impossible to talk to her.Then she tries to make a voice linkup with Hiro.That takes a couple of minutes to go through.Hello!Hello!Hello!she's shouting.Then she hears the honk of a car horn.Coming out of the telephone.Hello?It's Y. T.   How are you doing?This guy always seems a little too laid back in his personal dealings.She doesn't really want to talk about how she's doing.She hears another honking horn in the background, behind Hiro's voice.Where the hell are you, Hiro?Walking down a street in L. A.   How can you be goggled in if you're walking down a street?Then the terrible reality sinks in: Oh, my God, you didn't turn into a gargoyle, did you?Well, Hiro says.He is hesitant, embarrassed, like it hadn't occurred to him yet that this was what he was doing.It's not exactly like being a gargoyle.Remember when you gave me shit about spending all my money on computer stuff?Yeah.I decided I wasn't spending enough.So I got a belt pack machine.Smallest ever made.I'm walking down the street with this thing strapped to my belly.It's really cool.You're a gargoyle.Yeah, but it's not like having all this clunky shit strapped all over your body  You're a gargoyle.Listen, I talked to one of these wholesalers.Yeah?She says she used to be a hacker.She saw something strange on her computer.Then she got sick for a while and joined this cult and ended up on the Raft.The Raft.Do tell.On the Enterprise.They take their blood, Hiro.Suck it out of their bodies.They infect people by injecting them with the blood of sick hackers.And when their veins get all tracked out like a junkie's, they cut them loose and put them to work on the mainland running the wholesale operation.That's good, he says.That's good stuff.She says she saw some static on her computer screen and it made her sick.You know anything about that?Yeah.It's true.It's true?Yeah.But you don't have to worry about it.It only affects hackers.For a minute she can't even speak, she's so pissed.My mother is a programmer for the Feds.You asshole.Why didn't you warn me?Half an hour later, she's there.Doesn't bother to change back into her WASP disguise this time, just bursts into the house in basic, bad black.Drops her plank on the floor on the way in.Grabs one of Mom's curios off the shelfit's a heavy crystal awardclear plastic, actuallythat she got a couple years ago for sucking up to her Fed boss and passing all her polygraph testsand goes into the den.Mom's there.As usual.Working on her computer.But she's not looking at the screen right now, she's got some notes on her lap that she's going through.Just as Mom is looking up at her, Y. T.  winds up and throws the crystal award.It goes right over Mom's shoulder, glances off the computer table, flies right through the picture tube.Awesome results.Y. T.  always wanted to do that.She pauses to admire her work for a few seconds while Mom just flames off all kinds of weird emotion.What are you doing in that uniform?Didn't I tell you not to ride your skateboard on a real street?You're not supposed to throw things in the house.That's my prized possession.Why did you break the computer?Government property.Just what is going on here, anyway?Y. T.  can tell that this is going to continue for a couple of minutes, so she goes to the kitchen, splashes some water on her face, gets a glass of juice, just letting Mom follow her around and ventilate over her shoulder pads.Finally Mom winds down, defeated by Y. T.'s strategy of silence.I just saved your fucking life, Mom, Y. T.  says.You could at least offer me an Oreo.What on earth are you talking about?It's like, if youpeople of a certain agewould make some effort to just stay in touch with sort of basic, modern day events, then your kids wouldn't have to take these drastic measures.35  Earth materializes, rotating majestically in front of his face.Hiro reaches out and grabs it.He twists it around so he's looking at Oregon.Tells it to get rid of the clouds, and it does, giving him a crystalline view of the mountains and the seashore.Right out there, a couple of hundred miles off the Oregon coast, is a sort of granulated furuncle growing on the face of the water.Festering is not too strong a word.It's a couple of hundred miles south of Astoria now, moving south.Which explains why Juanita went to Astoria a couple of days ago: she wanted to get close to the Raft.Why is anyone's guess.Hiro looks up, focuses his gaze on Earth, zooms in for a look.As he gets closer, the imagery he's looking at shifts from the long range pictures coming in from the geosynchronous satellites to the good stuff being spewed into the CIC computer from a whole fleet of low flying spy birds.The view he's looking at is a mosaic of images shot no more than a few hours ago.It's several miles across.Its shape constantly changes, but at the time these pictures were shot, it had kind of a fat kidney shape; that is, it is trying to be a V, pointed southward like a flock of geese, but there's so much noise in the system, it's so amorphous and disorganized, that a kidney is the closest it can come.At the center is a pair of enormous vessels: the Enterprise and an oil tanker, lashed together side by side.These two behemoths are walled in by several other major vessels, an assortment of container ships and other freight carriers.The Core.Everything else is pretty tiny.There is the occasional hijacked yacht or decommissioned fishing trawler.But most of the boats in the Raft are just that: boats.Small pleasure craft, sampans, junks, dhows, dinghys, life rafts, houseboats, makeshift structures built on air filled oil drums and slabs of styrofoam.A good fifty percent of it isn't real boat material at all, just a garble of ropes, cables, planks, nets, and other debris tied together on top of whatever kind of flotsam was handy.And L.  Bob Rife is sitting in the middle of it.Hiro doesn't quite know what he's doing, and he doesn't know how Juanita is connected.But it's time to go there and find out.Scott Lagerquist is standing right on the edge of Mark Norman's 24/7 Motorcycle Mall, waiting, when the man with the swords comes into view, striding down the sidewalk.A pedestrian is a peculiar sight in L. A. , considerably more peculiar than a man with swords.But a welcome one.Anyone who drives out to a motorcycle dealership already has a car, by definition, so it's hard to give them a really hard sell.A pedestrian should be cake.Scott Wilson Lagerquist!the guy yells from fifty feet away and closing.How you doing?Fabulous!Scott says.A little off guard, maybe.Can't remember this guy's name, which is a problem.Where has he seen this guy before?It's great to see you!Scott says, running forward and pumping the guy's hand.I haven't seen you since, uh  Is Pinky here today?the guy says.Pinky?Yeah.Mark.Mark Norman.Pinky was his nickname back in college.I guess he probably doesn't like to be called that now that he's running, what, half a dozen dealerships, three McDonaldses, and a Holiday Inn, huh?I didn't know that Mr.Norman was into fast food also.Yeah.He's got three franchises down around Long Beach.Owns them through a limited partnership, actually.Is he here today?No, he's on vacation.Oh, yeah.In Corsica.The Ajaccio Hyatt.Room 543.That's right, I completely forgot about that.Well, were you just stopping by to say hi, or  Nah.I was going to buy a motorcycle.Oh.What kind of motorcycle were you looking for?One of the new Yamahas?With the new generation smartwheels?Scott grins manfully, trying to put the best face on the awful fact that he is about to reveal.I know exactly the one you mean.But I'm sorry to tell you that we don't actually have one in stock today.You don't?We don't.It's a brand new model.Nobody has them.You sure?Because you ordered one.We did?Yeah.A month ago.Suddenly the guy cranes his neck, looks over Scott's shoulder down the boulevard.Well, speak of the devil.Here it comes.A Yamaha semi is pulling into the truck entrance with a new shipment of motorcycles in the back.It's on that truck, the guy says.If you can give me one of your cards, I'll jot down the vehicle identification number on back so you can pull it off the truck for me.This was a special order made by Mr.Norman?He claimed he was just ordering it as a display model, you know.But it sort of has my name on it.Yes, sir.I understand totally.Sure enough, the bike comes off the truck, just as the guy described it, right down to color scheme (black) and vehicle ID number.It's a beautiful bike.It draws a crowd just sitting on the parking lotthe other salesmen actually put down their coffee cups and take their feet off their desks to go outside and look at it.It looks like a black land torpedo.Two wheel drive, natch.The wheels are so advanced they're not even wheelsthey look like giant, heavy duty versions of the smartwheels that high speed skateboards use, independently telescoping spokes with fat traction pads on the ends.Dangling out over the front, in the nose cone of the motorcycle, is the sensor package that monitors road conditions, decides where to place each spoke as it rolls forward, how much to extend it, and how to rotate the footpad for maximum traction.It's all controlled by a biosa Built In Operating Systeman onboard computer with a flat panel screen built into the top of the fuel tank.They say that this baby will do a hundred and twenty miles per hour on rubble.The bios patches itself into the CIC weather net so that it knows when it's about to run into precip.The aerodynamic cowling is totally flexible, calculates its own most efficient shape for the current speed and wind conditions, changes its curves accordingly, wraps around you like a nymphomaniacal gymnast.Scott figures this guy is going to waltz off with this thing for dealer invoice, being a friend and confidant of Mr.Norman.And it's not an easy thing for any red blooded salesman to write out a contract to sell a sexy beast like this one at dealer invoice.He hesitates for a minute.Wonders what's going to happen to him if this is all some kind of mistake.The guy's watching him intently, seems to sense his nervousness, almost as if he can hear Scott's heart beating.So at the last minute he eases up, gets magnanimousScott loves these big spender typesdecides to throw in a few hundred Kongbucks over invoice, just so Scott can pull in a meager commission on the deal.A tip, basically.Thenicing on the cakethe guy goes nuts in the Cycle Shop.Totally berserk.Buys a complete outfit.Everything.Top of the line.A full black coverall that swaddles everything from toes to neck in breathable, bulletproof fabric, with armorgel pads in all the right places and airbags around the neck.Even safety fanatics don't bother with a helmet when they're wearing one of these babies.So once he's figured out how to attach his swords on the outside of his coverall, he's on his way.I gotta say this, Scott says as the guy is sitting on his new bike, getting his swords adjusted, doing something incredibly unauthorized to the bios, you look like one bad motherfucker.Thanks, I guess.He twists the throttle up once and Scott feels, but does not hear, the power of the engine.This baby is so efficient it doesn't waste power by making noise.Say hi to your brand new niece, the guy says, and then lets go the clutch.The spokes flex and gather themselves and the bike springs forward out of the lot, seeming to jump off its electric paws.He cuts right across the parking lot of the neighboring NeoAquarian Temple franchise and pulls out onto the road.About half a second later, the guy with the swords is a dot on the horizon.Then he's gone.Northbound.36  Until a man is twenty five, he still thinks, every so often, that under the right circumstances he could be the baddest motherfucker in the world.If I moved to a martialarts monastery in China and studied real hard for ten years.If my family was wiped out by Colombian drug dealers and I swore myself to revenge.If I got a fatal disease, had one year to live, devoted it to wiping out street crime.If I just dropped out and devoted my life to being bad.Hiro used to feel that way, too, but then he ran into Raven.In a way, this is liberating.He no longer has to worry about trying to be the baddest motherfucker in the world.The position is taken.The crowning touch, the one thing that really puts true world class badmother fuckerdom totally out of reach, of course, is the hydrogen bomb.If it wasn't for the hydrogen bomb, a man could still aspire.Maybe find Raven's Achilles' heel.Sneak up, get a drop, slip a mickey, pull a fast one.But Raven's nuclear umbrella kind of puts the world title out of reach.Which is okay.Sometimes it's all right just to be a little bad.To know your limitations.Make do with what you've got.Once he maneuvers his way onto the freeway, aimed up into the mountains, he goggles into his office.Earth is still there, zoomed in tight on the Raft.Hiro contemplates it, superimposed in ghostly hues on his view of the highway, as he rides toward Oregon at a hundred and forty miles per hour.From a distance, it looks bigger than it really is.Getting closer, he can see that this illusion is caused by an enveloping, self made slick/cloud of sewage and air pollution, fading out into the ocean and the atmosphere.It orbits the Pacific clockwise.When they fire up the boilers on the Enterprise, it can control its direction a little bit, but real navigation is a practical impossibility with all the other shit lashed onto it.It mostly has to go where the wind and the Coriolis effect take it.A couple of years ago, it was going by the Philippines, Vietnam, China, Siberia, picking up Refus.Then it swung up the Aleutian chain, down the Alaska panhandle, and now it's gliding past the small town of Port Sherman, Oregon, near the California border.As the Raft moves through the Pacific, riding mostly on ocean currents, it occasionally sheds great hunks of itself.Eventually, these fragments wash up in some place like Santa Barbara, still lashed together, carrying a payload of skeletons and gnawed bones.When it gets to California, it will enter a new phase of its life cycle.It will shed much of its sprawling improvised bulk as a few hundred thousand Refus cut themselves loose and paddle to shore.The only Refus who make it that far are, by definition, the ones who were agile enough to make it out to the Raft in the first place, resourceful enough to survive the agonizingly slow passage through the arctic waters, and tough enough not to get killed by any of the other Refus.Nice guys, all of them.Just the kind of people you'd like to have showing up on your private beach in groups of a few thousand.Stripped down to a few major ships, a little more maneuverable, the Enterprise then will swing across the South Pacific, heading for Indonesia, where it will turn north again and start the next cycle of migration.Army ants cross mighty rivers by climbing on top of each other and clustering together into a little ball that floats.Many of them fall off and sink, and naturally the ants on the bottom of the ball drown.The ones who are quick and vigorous enough to keep clawing their way to the top survive.A lot of them make it across, and that's why you can't stop army ants by dynamiting the bridges.That's how Refus come across the Pacific, even though they are too poor to book passage on a real ship or buy a seaworthy boat.A new wave washes up onto the West Coast every five years or so, when the ocean currents bring the Enterprise back.For the last couple of months, owners of beachfront property in California have been hiring security people, putting up spotlights and antipersonnel fences along the tide line, mounting machine guns on their yachts.They have all subscribed to CIC's twenty four hour Raft Report, getting the latest news flash, straight from the satellite, on when the latest contingent of twenty five thousand starving Eurasians has cut itself loose from the Enterprise and started dipping its myriad oars into the Pacific, like ant legs.Time to do more digging, he tells the Librarian.But this is going to have to be totally verbal, because I'm headed up I 5 at some incredible speed right now, and I have to watch out for slow moving bagos and stuff.I'll keep that in mind, the voice of the Librarian says into his earphones.Look out for the jackknifed truck south of Santa Clarita.And there is a large chuckhole in the left lane near the Tulare exit.Thanks.Who were these gods anyway?Did Lagos have an opinion on that?Lagos believed that they might have been magiciansthat is, normal human beings with special powersor they might have been aliens.Whoa, whoa, hold on.Let's take these one at a time.What did Lagos mean when he talked about normal human beings with special powers'?Assume that the nam shub of Enki really functioned as a virus.Assume that someone named Enki invented it.Then Enki must have had some kind of linguistic power that goes beyond our concept of normal.And how would this power work?What's the mechanism?I can only give you forward references drawn by Lagos.Okay.Give me some.The belief in the magical power of language is not unusual, both in mystical and academic literature.The KabbalistsJewish mystics of Spain and Palestinebelieved that supernormal insight and power could be derived from properly combining the letters of the Divine Name.For example, Abu Aharon, an early Kabbalist who emigrated from Baghdad to Italy, was said to perform miracles through the power of the Sacred Names.What kind of power are we talking about here?Most Kabbalists were theorists who were interested only in pure meditation.But there were so called practical Kabbalists' who tried to apply the power of the Kabbalah in everyday life.In other words, sorcerers.Yes.These practical kabbalists used a so called archangelic alphabet,' derived from first century Greek and Aramaic theurgic alphabets, which resembled cuneiform.The Kabbalists referred to this alphabet as eye writing,' because the letters were composed of lines and small circles, which resembled eyes.Ones and zeroes.Some Kabbalists divided up the letters of the alphabet according to where they were produced inside the mouth.Okay.So as we would think of it, they were drawing a connection between the printed letter on the page and the neural connections that had to be invoked in order to pronounce it.Yes.By analyzing the spelling of various words, they were able to draw what they thought were profound conclusions about their true, inner meaning and significance.Okay.If you say so.In the academic realm, the literature is naturally not as fanciful.But a great deal of effort has been devoted to explaining Babel.Not the Babel eventwhich most people consider to be a mythbut the fact that languages tend to diverge.A number of linguistic theories have been developed in an effort to tie all languages together.Theories Lagos tried to apply to his virus hypothesis.Yes.There are two schools: relativists and universalists.As George Steiner summarizes it, relativists tend to believe that language is not the vehicle of thought but its determining medium.It is the framework of cognition.Our perceptions of everything are organized by the flux of sensations passing over that framework.Hence, the study of the evolution of language is the study of the evolution of the human mind itself.Okay, I can see the significance of that.What about the universalists?In contrast with the relativists, who believe that languages need not have anything in common with each other, the universalists believe that if you can analyze languages enough, you can find that all of them have certain traits in common.So they analyze languages, looking for such traits.Have they found any?No.There seems to be an exception to every rule.Which blows universalism out of the water.Not necessarily.They explain this problem by saying that the shared traits are too deeply buried to be analyzable.Which is a cop out.Their point is that at some level, language has to happen inside the human brain.Since all human brains are more or less the same  The hardware's the same.Not the software.You are using some kind of metaphor that I cannot understand.Hiro whips past a big Airstream that is rocking from side to side in a dangerous wind coming down the valley.Well, a French speaker's brain starts out the same as an English speaker's brain.As they grow up, they get programmed with different softwarethey learn different languages.Yes.Therefore, according to the universalists, French and Englishor any other languagesmust share certain traits that have their roots in the deep structures' of the human brain.According to Chomskyan theory, the deep structures are innate components of the brain that enable it to carry out certain formal kinds of operations on strings of symbols.Or, as Steiner paraphrases Emmon Bach: These deep structures eventually lead to the actual patterning of the cortex with its immensely ramified yet, at the same time, programmed' network of electrochemical and neurophysiological channels.But these deep structures are so deep we can't even see them?The universalists place the active nodes of linguistic lifethe deep structuresso deep as to defy observation and description.Or to use Steiner's analogy: Try to draw up the creature from the depths of the sea, and it will disintegrate or change form grotesquely.There's that serpent again.So which theory did Lagos believe in?The relativist or the universalist?He did not seem to think there was much of a difference.In the end, they are both somewhat mystical.Lagos believed that both schools of thought had essentially arrived at the same place by different lines of reasoning.But it seems to me there is a key difference, Hiro says.The universalists think that we are determined by the prepatterned structure of our brainsthe pathways in the cortex.The relativists don't believe that we have any limits.Lagos modified the strict Chomskyan theory by supposing that learning a language is like blowing code into PROMsan analogy that I cannot interpret.The analogy is clear.PROMs are Programmable Read Only Memory chips, Hiro says.When they come from the factory, they have no content.Once and only once, you can place information into those chips and then freeze itthe information, the software, becomes frozen into the chipit transmutes into hardware.After you have blown the code into the PROMs, you can read it out, but you can't write to them anymore.So Lagos was trying to say that the newborn human brain has no structureas the relativists would have itand that as the child learns a language, the developing brain structures itself accordingly, the language gets blown into' the hardware and becomes a permanent part of the brain's deep structureas the universalists would have it.Yes.This was his interpretation.Okay.So when he talked about Enki being a real person with magical powers, what he meant was that Enki somehow understood the connection between language and the brain, knew how to manipulate it.The same way that a hacker, knowing the secrets of a computer system, can write code to control itdigital nam shubs.Lagos said that Enki had the ability to ascend into the universe of language and see it before his eyes.Much as humans go into the Metaverse.That gave him power to create nam shubs.And nam shubs had the power to alter the functioning of the brain and of the body.Why isn't anyone doing this kind of thing nowadays?Why aren't there any nam shubs in English?Not all languages are the same, as Steiner points out.Some languages are better at metaphor than others.Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek, and Chinese lend themselves to word play and have achieved a lasting grip on reality: Palestine had Qiryat Sefer, the City of the Letter, and Syria had Byblos, the Town of the Book.By contrast other civilizations seem speechless or at least, as may have been the case in Egypt, not entirely cognizant of the creative and transformational powers of language. 'Lagos believed that Sumerian was an extraordinarily powerful languageat least it was in Sumer five thousand years ago.A language that lent itself to Enki's neurolinguistic hacking.Early linguists, as well as the Kabbalists, believed in a fictional language called the tongue of Eden, the language of Adam.It enabled all men to understand each other, to communicate without misunderstanding.It was the language of the Logos, the moment when God created the world by speaking a word.In the tongue of Eden, naming a thing was the same as creating it.To quote Steiner again, Our speech interposes itself between apprehension and truth like a dusty pane or warped mirror.The tongue of Eden was like a flawless glass; a light of total understanding streamed through it.Thus Babel was a second Fall. 'And Isaac the Blind, an early Kabbalist, said that, to quote Gershom Scholem's translation, The speech of men is connected with divine speech and all language whether heavenly or human derives from one source: the Divine Name. 'The practical kabbalists, the sorcerers, bore the title Ba'al Shem, meaning master of the divine name. 'The machine language of the world, Hiro says.Is this another analogy?Computers speak machine language, Hiro says.It's written in ones and zeroesbinary code.At the lowest level, all computers are programmed with strings of ones and zeroes.When you program in machine language, you are controlling the computer at its brainstem, the root of its existence.It's the tongue of Eden.But it's very difficult to work in machine language because you go crazy after a while, working at such a minute level.So a whole Babel of computer languages has been created for programmers: FORTRAN, BASIC, COBOL, LISP, Pascal, C, PROLOG, FORTH.You talk to the computer in one of these languages, and a piece of software called a compiler converts it into machine language.But you never can tell exactly what the compiler is doing.It doesn't always come out the way you want.Like a dusty pane or warped mirror.A really advanced hacker comes to understand the true inner workings of the machinehe sees through the language he's working in and glimpses the secret functioning of the binary codebecomes a Ba'al Shem of sorts.Lagos believed that the legends about the tongue of Eden were exaggerated versions of true events, the Librarian says.These legends reflected nostalgia for a time when people spoke Sumerian, a tongue that was superior to anything that came afterward.Is Sumerian really that good?Not as far as modern day linguists can tell, the Librarian says.As I mentioned, it is largely impossible for us to grasp.Lagos suspected that words worked differently in those days.If one's native tongue influences the physical structure of the developing brain, then it is fair to say that the Sumerianswho spoke a language radically different from anything in existence todayhad fundamentally different brains from yours.Lagos believed that for this reason, Sumerian was a language ideally suited to the creation and propagation of viruses.That a virus, once released into Sumer, would spread rapidly and virulently, until it had infected everyone.Maybe Enki knew that also, Hiro says.Maybe the nam shub of Enki wasn't such a bad thing.Maybe Babel was the best thing that ever happened to us.37  Y. T.'s mom works in Fedland.She has parked her little car in her own little numbered slot, for which the Feds require her to pay about ten percent of her salary (if she doesn't like it she can take a taxi or walk) and walked up several levels of a blindingly lit reinforced concrete helix in which most of the spacesthe good spaces closer to the surfaceare reserved for people other than her, but empty.She always walks up the center of the ramp, between the rows of parked cars, so that the EBGOC boys won't think she's lurking, loitering, skulking, malingering, or smoking.Reaching the subterranean entrance of her building, she has taken all metal objects from her pockets and removed what little jewelry she's wearing and dumped them into a dirty plastic bowl and walked through the detector.Flashed her badge.Signed her name and noted down the digital time.Submitted to a frisking from an EBGOC girl.Annoying, but it sure beats a cavity search.They have a right to do a cavity search if they want.She got cavity searched every day for a month once, right after she had spoken up at a meeting and suggested that her supervisor might be on the wrong track with a major programming project.It was punitive and vicious, she knew it was, but she always wanted to give something back to her country, and whenever you work for the Feds you just accept the fact that there's going to be some politicking.And that as a low level person you're going to bear the brunt.And later on, you climb the GS ladder, don't have to put up with as much shit.Far be it from her to quarrel with her supervisor.Her supervisor, Marietta, doesn't have an especially stellar GS level, but she does have access.She has connections.Marietta knows people who know people.Marietta has attended cocktail parties that were also attended by some people who, well, your eyes would bug out.She has passed the frisking with flying collars.Put the metal stuff back into her pockets.Climbed up half a dozen flights of stairs to her floor.The elevators here still work, but some very highly placed people in Fedland have let it be knownnothing official, but they have ways of letting this stuff outthat it is a duty to conserve energy.And the Feds are real serious about duty.Duty, loyalty, responsibility.The collagen that binds us into the United States of America.So the stairwells are filled with sweaty wool and clacking leather.If you took the elevator, no one would actually say anything, but it would be noticed.Noticed and written down and taken into account.People would look at you, glance you up and down, like, what happened, sprain your ankle?Taking the stairs is no problem.Feds don't smoke.Feds generally don't overeat.The health plan is very specific, contains major incentives, get too heavy or wheezy and, no one says anything about itwhich would be rudebut you feel a definite pressure, a sense of not fitting in, as you walk across the sea of desks, eyes glance up to follow you, estimating the mass of your saddlebags, eyes darting back and forth between desks as, by consensus, your co workers say to themselves, I wonder how much he or she is driving up our health plan premiums?So Y. T.'s mom has clacked up the stairs in her black pumps and gone into her office, actually a large room with computer workstations placed across it in a grid.Used to be divided up by partitions, but the EBGOC boys didn't like it, said what would happen if there had to be an evacuation?All those partitions would impede the free flow of unhinged panic.So no more partitions.Just workstations and chairs.Not even any desktops.Desktops encourage the use of paper, which is archaic and reflects inadequate team spirit.What is so special about your work that you have to write it down on a piece of paper that only you get to see?That you have to lock it away inside a desk?When you're working for the Feds, everything you do is the property of the United States of America.You do your work on the computer.The computer keeps a copy of everything, so that if you get sick or something, it's all there where your co workers and supervisors can get access to it.If you want to write little notes or make phone doodles, you're perfectly free to do that at home, in your spare time.And there's the question of interchangeability.Fed workers, like military people, are intended to be interchangeable parts.What happens if your workstation should break down?You're going to sit there and twiddle your thumbs until it gets fixed?
