He needed to conserve his energy.He realized that he had dozed off.Opening his eyes and focusing, with some effort, on the screen, he saw that nearly an hour had passed since apogee.They were falling toward Earth for the last time.His phone rang.Held at arms length it was blurry, but some vestigial part of his brain could still recognize the smear of pixels as a snapshot of Bo, taken years ago.He swiped it on and answered it.We are being contacted by the Swarm, Bo said.Are we really?he answered.Suddenly he was awake.What does J. B. F.  want?Its not J. B. F.  Its someone named ...Bo paused.A ida.Or something.Two dots on the i.  Doob tried to place the name.Ada.He had a vague memory of her from his early days on the Cloud Ark.An Italian girl.Young.Arkie, not GPop.Socially a little weird.Hyperacute in a way that could be exhausting.Its pronounced I yeeda, he told Bo.Anyway, they send congratulations on the successful completion of our maneuver, and request a parley.Should I wake up Ivy?Ill be there in a minute, Doob said.Let her sleep.He hated to think this way, but the Swarmers well knew what time it was, and which shift Ivy slept on, and that she was sleeping now.Rousting her out of bed would send the wrong message, making the crew of Endurance seem overeager.Which might have been an excess of cautiona J. B. F.  style exercise of byzantine thinkinghe reflected, as he pushed himself up the middle of the Stack.This had become a dingy place, sort of yellowed and shiny with human exhalations, condensed on its ice cold walls and never really scrubbed off.He was glad he couldnt see it very well.They knew so little about the Swarm.From the straggler arklets theyd picked up over the last three years, they knew that J. B. F.  had moved swiftly to consolidate her power, exploiting the crisis of the first coronal mass ejectionwhich had killed something like 10 percent of the populationto set up her own version of martial law.From there the trains had run more or less on time, albeit with a steadily dwindling population, until about a year ago, when some Arkies had begun to rebel and the Swarm had divided into two Swarms, coexisting with each otheras they had little choicebut not talking.The people of Endurance had paid surprisingly little attention to matters Swarm related, because, in the end, it didnt really matter that much.The die had been cast on the day of the Break.Not so much on the level of politics as on physics.Those who had stayed behind on Izzy had committed themselves to following Doobs plan, his lifes work: the Big Ride.You were either aboard Endurance, simultaneously trapped and protected by her mass, or you werent.If you were, there was no getting off.If you werent, you had to find a way to survive as part of the Swarm, which meant moving to a completely different orbit and following a plan that was incompatible, on an orbital mechanics level, with the Big Ride.Once those orbits had diverged, the only way to reconnect was by effecting a big delta vee.That meant spending a lot of water that you were never going to get back.Less water meant less shielding from coronal mass ejections, limited food production, and hobbled maneuvering when bad rocks came at you.Getting a whole Swarm to agree on that course of action was impossible, and might actually have been a bad idea, since Endurance couldnt accommodate a lot of refugees.Her mission plan was predicated on her ability to absorb significant bolide strikes without taking serious damage.A bunch of naked arklets following in her wake would soon get beaten to death.So on a physics level alone, the Break had been irrevocable, even had the two groups badly wanted to get together.But apparently what was left of the Swarm had been watching Endurance.Biding their time, waiting to see whether she would win through.This Ada person must understand Doobs plan.She knew what was at stake now.If the remnants of the Swarm could rejoin Endurance in the next ten days, before she disappeared into the maelstrom of the debris cloud, they had a hope of reaching the comparative safety of Cleft.Otherwise they were condemned to circle Earth in some relatively clean and safe orbit as their population and their water supply dwindled.Doob swam into the Hammerhead.Three other people were in here: Bo, Steve Lake, and Michael Park, a former Arkie, a gay Korean Canadian from Vancouver who had found six different ways to make himself indispensable.Ada Ferrari, according to our records, Bo said, before he asked.A leader of the anti J. B. F.  faction.Sounds like J. B. F.  lost.Steve seemed busy.It was good to see him active.He had come down with some kind of long running bowel complaint, an imbalance in the bacteria that lived in his gut.He had kept the dreadlocks, but they were now bigger than he was.He must weigh less than a hundred pounds.But his fingers still flew over the keys of his laptop.Bo had already turned her attention back to the business of running the ship, but Michael explained, Steves getting a video feed going.No ones done it in years.He meant that no one had recently been doing it over the old school S band radios used for long range communication between space vehicles.Of course, on the short range mesh network that the Arkitects had set up to knit the Cloud Ark together, people did it all the time using Scape.But depending on where they were in their orbit, the remnants of the Swarm might be hundreds of thousands of kilometers away from Endurance, far out of mesh range, and so they had to use the same sort of pre Internet technology that the Apollo astronauts had used to send television signals back from the moon.Eventually Steve did get it going, and then they were treated to a full face image, in blocky pixels, of a dark eyed woman with a fine featured head that had been buzz cut a few weeks ago and little tended since.Once Steve did him the favor of throwing it up on a big screen where he could actually see it, Doob saw the obvious signs of malnutrition that had been affecting everyone on Endurance.He was mildly surprised by that.They had tantalized themselves by imagining the Swarm as a cornucopia of agriculture.But maybe it was low on water.The womans gaze was downcast, which, as everyone understood, meant that she was focusing on the screen of a tablet below the camera.Once she understood that the link was up and running, she raised her chin and seemed to stare directly into the Hammerhead with a pair of huge dark eyes.The low quality of the video made these seem pitch black, with no distinction between iris and pupil, and starvation had given them a sort of hot gleam.Ada, the woman said, by way of self introduction.I see you, Dr.Harris.She began to smile, offering a glimpse of bad teeth, then thought better of it.Her eyes changed direction momentarily to someone or something off camera, then came back to them.She raised her tablet up closer to the camera so that she could look at the feed from Endurance.Her hand passed briefly in front of the lens and they caught a glimpse of dirty, ragged fingernails, the frayed and shiny cuff of a sleeve.Faint murmurs in the background suggested that other people were in the same arklet with her, off camera.She was in zero gee, therefore, not part of a bolo.Her eyes were exploring the feed on her tablet, trying to make sense of what she was seeing.The Hammerhead had not existed at the time of the Break, so it was a new thing to her.Steve Lake, she muttered, as she recognized him.Bo, Bo said.Michael, Michael said.Who is in charge?Ada asked.Is Ivy ...Ivys still alive and she is still the commander as per CAC, Doob said.Shes off shift.We can wake her up if you need to speak to her urgently.No.Not necessary, Ada said, recoiling slightly and narrowing the eyes just a bit.The distance between her and Endurance introduced a time lag in the video, which made conversation halting and awkward.How many do you have?Doob asked.Eleven.Doob, accustomed to working professionally with extremely large numbers, couldnt quite process one so small.Eleven.One plus ten.A thought came to him.Do you mean eleven arklets?That would imply scores, maybe a hundred people.Ada looked amused.Oh no, of arklets we have many more.We have twenty six.Ah.So what is it you have eleven of?People, Ada said.Ada, Bo said, just to be clear.So there is no misunderstanding.You are speaking for the entire Swarm.And you are saying that, of the entire Swarm, there are eleven survivors.Yes.Plus one ...One what?A look of amusement came over Adas face.She broke eye contact.It almost seemed that she rolled her eyes a little.Doob was reminded, hardly for the first time, that the Arkies had been sent up as teenagers.It is complicated.Lets just say there is one more who might as well be dead.Those in the Hammerhead still could not quite process it.Something occurred to Michael: We know that the Swarm broke up into two factions.One led by J. B. F.  You were part of the opposing group?Yes.Ada laughed.Again she reminded Doob of a teenager going through the pretense of talking to a clueless parent about something they would never understand.Michael, a little wrong footed, went on haltingly: And so when you say that there are eleven ...plus one who is, I take it, in a bad way ...anyhow, are you referring just to the anti J. B. F.  faction?They were defeated a long time ago.Months.When you say that, do you mean that there was some kind of a conflict?A war?Doob asked.Ada shrugged.There was some fighting.She didnt see it as important.Call it a war if you wish.More like some brawls.The real battle was, you know, on the Internet.Social media.Silence ensued.Ada waited for them to respond.When no one did, she shrugged.What were we going to do?Smash our arklets into each other?There is no way to have, like, actual violence in this setting!So we just had a war of words.She held her hands up in front of her, making them into little pantomime mouths, aimed at each other, thumb jaws flapping up and down.Trying to, you know, persuade others to join our side.Trying to make the other side look bad.Just like the Internet always was.She chuckled, put one hand to her cheek, rubbed her eye.Look, it is very complicated and I cannot explain everything right nowhow it all came out.But you said that J. B. F. s faction was defeated, Michael said.Of all the people in the Hammerhead, he seemed most committed to the proposition that there was a reasonable and logical explanation for all of this.Her and Tav, yes.By which you mean, you defeated them with words.Ideas.A social media campaign.We were more persuasive, Ada said.I was more persuasive.Arklet by arklet, they came over to my side.The White Arklet held out for a while, then they gave up.What became of them?J. B. F.  is fine.Tav, not so good.Hes the one you mentioned.The twelfth one who might as well be dead.I am afraid so, yes.So getting back to the earlier question, Doob said, the number you quoted is for the entire Swarm.Both factions.Ada, finally seeming to understand what they were getting at, sat up straighter and got a more serious look on her face.Yes.There are no other survivors whatsoever.Of the eight hundred, eleven remain.There was a long silence as the four in the Hammerhead took this in.They had all harbored fears that the Swarm might go terribly wrong, but this was worse than anything they had imagined.Finally Doob raised his hands in front of him, palms up, and shrugged.What happened?Agriculture crashed.Ada turned her head and stared off camera for a few moments.I mean, I could say many things, but that is basically it.Between the CMEs, algae blights, lack of water ...very few arklets produce food anymore.What have you been eating?Ada snapped her head around, as if surprised by the question, and looked quizzically into the camera.Each other.Dead people, I mean.There was a long silence during which Doob, Bo, Michael, and Steve all exchanged looks.The terrible thing was that they had considered doing the same thing, many times.Every freeze dried corpse that they jettisoned was a big collection of protein and nutrients that, from a certain point of view, could seem mouthwatering.Seeming to read their minds, Ada went on: And you?You mean, have we resorted to eating dead people?No, Doob said.Tav started it, Ada said.He ate his own leg.Soft cannibalism, he called it.Legs are of no use in space.He blogged it.Then it went viral.No one had anything to say to that.After a few moments had gone by, Ada continued.But Endurance is better stocked with MREs and so on.Plenty of water.You would not have gone there.No, we did not go there, Doob said.He could tell from the body language of the others in the Hammerhead that they were too shocked to be entrusted with speaking at the moment.As for us, Ada said, you should also know that supplies were conserved.Even as people died and we lost arklets.We moved what we had into the arklets that survived.Our twenty six arklets are well stocked.With everything except food, Doob said.Yes.Do you have enough water to match our trajectory?Yes, Ada said.She was a beautiful young woman, Doob thought, with a fierceness about her that helped explain her success in the social media campaign against Tav and J. B. F.  We have performed all of the calculations.If we jettison mass and pack all we have into a heptad, we can make the rendezvous around the time of your next apogee.But we will need to know your exact params.We will discuss your proposal, Doob said, and make any necessary preparations.He looked over at Steve Lake, who severed the connection just as Ada was about to say something.THEY SAT IN THE BANANA AND DISCUSSED IT AS IF THERE WAS ANYTHING really to discuss.They all registered their rote shock and disgust at what the Swarm had been reduced to.It all sounded hollow to Luisa.Finally she spoke up.It was what Luisa did.They expected it of her.They relied on it.Seven billion died.Next to that, this is small.And God knows weve all thought about eating the dead, so lets not pretend to be shocked that they actually did it.The real reason were all freaked out by this is that our hopes have been dashed.We thought that the Swarm was going to contain hundreds of healthy people, lots of food, lots of good company.Oh, intellectually we knew it wouldnt be the case, but we were all hoping for it.Now we learn its eleven carrion eaters.Are we going to leave them to die?No.Were going to make room for them and for their heptad full of scarce vitamins.I am terrified of the woman Ada, Michael Park said.Luisa sighed.Let me throw out an idea, which is that youre terrified because you wonder, at some level, whether you could turn into Ada if you got hungry enough.Stillto let her on board Endurance And J. B. F.  too, Tekla said.She and Moira were sitting next to each other as they always did, hands clasped, fingers intertwined.I hoped I would never see Julia again, Camila put in.I know it is small and selfish of me, but ...I understand all of your misgivings, Ivy said, because I share them.The question, now, is whether those misgivings are going to have any effect on the decision we make.Are we really going to let one third of the surviving human race die because Adas creepy and we hate J. B. F. ?Obviously not.So, we transmit our params and our burn plan.And during the remainder of this orbit we make arrangements to accommodate some new arklets.THE REMAINDER OF THE ORBIT WAS BUSY INDEED, TO THE POINT where they broke out hoarded rations and upped their calorie intake to fuel their brains and their bodies.In the middle of that ten day stretch, however, was an intermission.Dinah and Ivy had wordlessly agreed to spend it together in what Doob had once called the Woo Woo Pod, and what they now called the Kupol.After the Break, when Rhys had reengineered Izzy and Ymir into a single moving sculpture of metal and water, he had moved this module to a different location in the Stack and then let the living ice flow around it, completely surrounding its inboard hemisphere and later building up in a protective brow that shielded part of its windowed half.It projected from the side of Endurance like an eyeball and gave people a place to go when they wanted to look at the universe.As such it had no legitimate function from an engineering point of view.In fact it was a liability, since it got hit by little rocks from time to time, depressurized, and had to be repaired.Anyone in it was getting directly exposed to cosmic radiation, and so it was a no go zone when they were passing through the Van Allen belts, which was often.But people loved it anyway, and kept patching it up when it was broken, and went there when they wanted to be alone or when they wanted to share some special time with another person.Putting it there had been one of Rhyss best moves as a designer, and Dinah silently thanked him whenever she used it.Doobs old term for it had begun to seem a little tasteless after the Hard Rain.For a little while, people had instead referred to it as the Dome.But dom had a different meaning in Russian, and so theyd settled on Cupola or Kupol, whose meanings in English and Russian respectively were not too far apart.In the latter language it carried a vaguely religious connotation, having to do with cathedral domes.Ivy and Dinah didnt have to worry too much about cosmic rays during the intermission, because they had so arranged it that the Kupol was on Endurances nadir side, facing toward Earth.And Earth was close enough to fill their view.Useless as the planet might be for the support of life, it still acted as a very effective cosmic ray absorber.Nothing was getting through that, short of another mysterious Agent that could pass all the way through a planet and keep on going.So, Dinah and Ivy hovered in the middle of the sphere, arms linked so that they wouldnt drift apart, and sucked bourbon from plastic bags, and looked at their old planet for the last time.In their six years of hurtling around this world, theyd grown accustomed to the steep angle that Izzys orbital plane made with the equator, and the views it afforded them of the high latitudes.Because of the changes they had lately been making to Endurances plane, however, they were now confined to a belt around the tropics.Not that it mattered a hell of a lot with Earth in its current state.The sky was still on fire, streaked with the bluish white incandescence of the Hard Rain.The ground, where they could see it through smoke and steam, was a mottled terrain of dully glowing lava: some of it the hot impact craters of recent big meteorites, some of it spewing up out of the Earths fractured crust.Oceans were dark at night, hazed with steam in daylight, their coasts difficult to make out, but clearly shallower than they had been.Florida was reaching out toward the Keys but being battered down and chipped away by bolides, and washed away by tsunamis, even as it did so.A year and a half ago, a big rock had torn the lid off the long dormant Yellowstone supervolcano.That had been cloaking most of North America with ash ever since then; glimmers of yellow light in the northern extreme of their view hinted at a vast outpouring of magma.A long suppressed habit told Dinah, absurdly, that she should go and turn on her radio in case Rufus was transmitting.This made the tears come, and that in turn made Ivys tears come, and so they spent the last half of the intermission, from perigee onward, gazing at Earth through water.It didnt really affect the view much.But Dinah tried to register the memories as best she could.Humans would not again look on Earth from such a close vantage point for thousands of years.The burning planet started to drop away from them.It would only ever get smaller from now.They needed to get back to work.But they found it difficult to let go of each other.Back in the old days, before Zero, theyd had the occasional heart to heart about their shared, secret fear that they werent qualified to carry out the missions for which theyd been sent up, at vast taxpayer expense.That theyd screw it up, fall on their faces, and embarrass a lot of people on the ground.By now, of course, they had long since put those fears to rest, or at least seen them overwhelmed and buried by much greater fears.Ever since the beginning of the Cloud Ark project, however, and especially since they had made the irrevocable decision to build Endurance and go on the Big Ride, it had frequently come back to them in a bigger and more dreaded form.What if they were completely getting it wrong?They could scarcely remember, now, the great civilization that had once spread across the planet below them.But the contrast between it and its orbiting residue was painful.The dirty, beat up kludge that was Endurance was an embarrassment to the human race.Could they really have done no better than this?And now, after a voyage of three yearsthree years that had been an unrelieved spiral of decline, punctuated by catastrophesthey were reduced to a maneuver, coming up in five days time, that seemed more and more desperate the more they thought about it.If they screwed it up, it would be their fault, more than anyone elses.Of course, no one would be left to blame them for it.They went through these crises of confidence frequently, but usually at different times, so that one could pull the other out of despair.Right now they were both feeling it together, and so they had to pull themselves out.Dinah was thinking about Rufuss last transmission: BYE HONEY DO US PROUD Okay, she said.Come on, sweetie.Lets get to work.WORK GAVE THEM SOMETHING TO DO DURING THE FINAL ORBIT OF the Big Ride besides worry about what was going to happen at the end of it.The huge burn that they would make at apogee, combining a final plane change with an acceleration into the fast lane where Cleft rolled around the world like a ball bearing in a tire, contained so many unfathomable chances that it beggared prediction.The new wrinkle, however, was this: since they would be moving into a stream of rocks moving faster than they were, the rocks would be coming at them from behind, where Amalthea had no power to protect them.Early in the mission Doob had dreamed of reconfiguring Endurance at the last minute, moving the vulnerable stuff around to the asteroids other side.With the manpower theyd had in those days, it might have been possible.As it was, reduced to a crew of twenty eight starvelings, it was out of the question.It took all the people they had to make accommodations for the Swarms heptad.They would dock it in the middle of the Stack, lock it in place with a few cables, and hope it stayed attached during the subsequent maneuvers.They would keep the hatch closed.The eleven members of Adas group would simply stay in their arklets until it was all over.The justification was that theyd be safer there.The true reason was that no one wanted cannibals in the shared spaces of Endurance.The big project for Dinah, and for the small remnant crew of robot jockeys who tended to work with her, was getting ready to dump Amalthea itself.On one level the idea seemed nearly unthinkable.They had, however, been planning to do it for a long time.Endurances final series of maneuvers would have to be accomplished quickly, deftly, in an environment where the rocks tended to be much larger than the ones that made up the Hard Rain.In a sense, the boulders up there were the mothers of the tiny fragments that had destroyed the surface of Earth.Every time two of them collided, a few chips exploded outward from the impact, and a fraction of those ended up falling into Earths atmosphere.The Hard Rain would continue until all of them had been reduced to sand and organized themselves into a neat system of rings.In any case, Amaltheas ability to protect Endurance from the impacts of baseball  or even basketball sized rocks was of little interest in a place where a rock the size of Ireland would be considered unremarkable.The entire ship, Amalthea and all, would be a bug on the windshield of such a thing.Their only way to stay alive, once they had entered the slipstream of the main debris cloud, was to maneuver around the big rocks and hope that they didnt get hit by too many little ones during their dash to Cleft.And that sort of maneuvering was impossible as long as Amaltheawhich weighed a hundred times as much as the rest of Endurancewas attached to her.In addition to Amalthea, Endurance was still burdened by a considerable mass of ice, which they had hoarded both as shielding and as propellant.It weighed a significant fraction of what Amalthea weighed.But unlike Amalthea, they could burn it.The basic plan was to split most of that ice into hydrogen and oxygen, then burn it during the final speed up at apogee.Over the course of a few hectic minutes, Endurance would expend most of her water weight by using it as propellant.Between that and the ditching of Amalthea, her total weight would drop by a factor of more than a hundred in the course of an hour.After that, she truly would be like a bug flitting around in heavy traffic, dodging big rocks and taking hits from little ones until she made her way to Cleft.In any case, they had anticipated all of this long ago.Dinah and the other surviving members of the Mining Colony had had three years in which to reshape Amalthea from the inside.Seen from the forward end, the asteroid looked the same as ever.Internally, however, most of it had systematically been whittled loose.In a sense the process had begun around Day 14, when Dinah had set one of her Grabbs to work carving out a niche in which she could stash her electronic parts.Since then it had proceeded in fits and starts.Theyd moved a lot of metal in order to make a storage bay for Moira Crewes genetic equipment, which in a sense was the raison dtre of everything else they had done in the last three years.Once that was safe they had begun tidying up, enlarging the pockets of protected space, breaking down walls, and joining them together into a cylindrical capsule scooped out of Amaltheas back, called the Hammerhead for the way it lay athwart the top of the Stack.Thanks to a lot of ticklish work by robots in the last couple of years, the Hammerhead was now separated from the rest of Amalthea99 percent of the asteroids bulk and massby walls of nickel iron that were only about as thick as the palm of a persons hand.This still made them extremely massive by the standards of space architecturemore than strong enough to hold in atmospheric pressure and to stop small bolides.But the additional tens of meters thickness of metal beyond those walls was now physically detached from the hand thick walls, and could be pushed away by a puff of compressed air.Or rather, given the disparity in masses, Endurance could be pushed away from it.Most of Amalthea would stay where it was, and the radically lightened Endurance would back away from it like a grasshopper springing off a bowling ball.When the time came, they would have to shatter the remaining structural links with demolition charges.One of Dinahs duties on the last lap, as they soared back up out of Earths gravity well toward their rendezvous with Cleft, was to go out in a space suit and inspect those charges, make sure they were packed in where they needed to be and wired up correctly.She was the only person remaining who knew much about explosives, and so she was the only person who could be sure.Just another of those duties that would have left her half paralyzed six years ago and now seemed routine.I KNOW THAT WE DONT NEED ANY MORE BAD NEWS, DOOB ANNOUNCED to the 25 percent of the human race seated around the conference table in the Banana, but heres some for yall.No one said anything.Nothing could make much of an impression on them at this point.Forty eight hours remained before apogee, the final burn, the ditching of Amalthea, the dash to Cleft.If Adas transmission of half an hour ago was to be believed, the remnants of the Swarm would rendezvous with them shortly before all of those things happened.Lets have it, Ivy said.Ive been keeping an eye on a certain sunspot, Doob said.Kind of angry looking.Well, about twenty minutes ago it kicked out a huge flare.Not the biggest weve ever seen, but pretty big.So, were expecting a CME?Ivy asked.Yeah.Somewhere between one and three days from now.Ill provide better estimates as soon as I have more data.They all considered it.Until recently, coronal mass ejections had been of little concern to them except insofar as they made them wonder how the people of the Swarm were getting along.As for the tiny faction that had split away on Red Hope, it was assumed that they had long since been wiped out by one or more of the hazards and calamities that had inflicted such a death toll on the Swarm.For the crew of Endurance, Amalthea and ice had provided plenty of shielding.Even the comparatively thin walls of the Hammerhead would protect anyone inside of it against the kind of radiation that would envelop them in a CME.But Endurances flanks were now exposed.Grabbs had been at work carrying away the last of the ice and feeding it to the splitters to be made into rocket fuel.They were storing the cryogenic gases anywhere they could now, pumping them into empty arklet hulls and disused modules.Parts of the Stack were seeing the light of day for the first time since the Break.Itll affect our operations, Ivy concluded.But this is a drill we know pretty well.Take amifostine.Get your space walks finished before it hits.We should make arrangements to accommodate all nonessential personnel in the Hammerhead.Some of us will have to be down farther in the Stack, but well have storm shelters ready.What about ...them?Michael Park asked.They are a problem, Ivy admitted.Theyre in plastic arklets.Theyre gonna get cooked.Even if they have any amifostine left, even if they have enough water to fill their storm shelters, theyre going to take damage.Ethically, we need to bring those eleven aboard Endurance and get them to safer places.The original plan was to send three people out on an EVA to lock down their heptad, make it fast to the stack, so that we could maneuver, said Zeke Petersen.Of all the crew of Endurance he looked the most similar to his pre Break appearance.He was skinnier, of course, with a bit of gray around his temples, but his health was still good, and hed managed to keep his electric shaver working, so he was beardless.After the deaths of Fyodor, from an accident, and Ulrika, from a stroke, Ivy had designated him Endurances second in command.He referred to the fact that Endurance was about to shed 99 percent of her mass, which meant that the same complement of engines, producing the same thrust, could make her accelerate a hundred times faster.The gee forces still would not be extremewell within the range that humans could toleratebut the maneuver would impose stresses on the ships frame the likes of which it had never experienced before.This was another of those eventualities that they had foreseen long ago and built into Endurance before covering her with ice.So most of Endurance came prerigged for higher acceleration.Provided that nothing had broken during the last three years, shed hold together, albeit with a lot of loose junk sliding around her interior spaces the first time they hit the throttle.They hadnt planned, though, for the last minute addition of the heptad from the Swarm.This was awkward.It would be connected to the Stack by a docking port, which wasnt designed to take a lot of mechanical strain.It was heavy, because Ada and her crew had crammed it full of supplies and strapped even more to the outside of it.For the same reason, Ivy didnt want to just ditch itthey could use those supplies.So the plan had been for three spacewalkers to greet the heptad and lash it into place with cables as soon as it arrived.Well just have to see what we can do with robots, Ivy said, looking toward Dinah and Bo.Just about everything we have out there is Grimmed, correct?So it can operate even in heavy radiation.Well get ready for that, Dinah agreed.As soon as the heptad docks, the robots get to work, Ivy said, locking it down as best we can.We open the hatch and get the eleven down through the hamster tubes as fast as possibletheyll have no protection whatsoever while theyre moving through those tubes.Well have storm shelters waiting for them.They can climb into those and ride out the rest of the journey.The flight crew will operate out of the Hammerhead.THE NEXT TWO DAYS REMINDED DINAH OF THE NEW CAIRD EXPEDITION, in that there was a lot to do but no way to affect the schedule.They were at the mercy of astronomical events.Part of her wanted to pull all nighters until this thing was finished, but she knew she had to be well rested and fed when it counted, and so she forced herself to eat and sleep on the usual schedule.When awake, she worked on preparations for the arrival of the heptad, pre positioning Grabbs near the docking port that it would use, connecting cables to suitable anchor points, tuning up the programs that the robots would execute when it came time to snap the other ends of those cables onto the heptad, rehearsing them to check for places where the cables might snag.The timeline gradually came into clearer focus.Ada sent out a sharp request for amifostine and water to fill their storm shelters.Of course, it was impossible for Endurance to comply.They had plenty of both, but they had long since cannibalized all of their MIV parts and so they had no way to transport them.Ada decided to roll the dice by committing all the water she had left to a large burn that would bring them to the rendezvous with Endurance a little earlier than theyd originally planned.Meanwhile Doobs space weather forecast was becoming more precise; he had a better idea now of when the radiation storm would break over them and thought that the timing was looking favorable.The heptad might arrive before things got bad.It might be okay after all to have some spacewalkers out there to cooperate with Dinahs robots.Dinah didnt know how to feel about that.The schedule had been accelerated, and now she had to take into account the vagaries of human spacewalkers.If Adas heptad docked soon enough, Doob pointed out, they might be able to transfer many of her heavy supplies through the docking port into the Stack and thereby reduce the awkward strains that all of Dinahs cables were meant to take up.Meanwhile Ivy and Zeke, the pilots, were addressing similar last minute convolutions in their mission plan.As they got nearer, they got better information about the part of the debris cloud that theyd be maneuvering through.They could clearly make out Clefts radar signature, as well as those of many other big rocks that traveled in its vicinity.A clutter of faint noise and clouds on the optical telescope gave them data about the density of objects too small and numerous to resolve.All of it fed into the plan.Doob looked tired, and nodded off frequently, and hadnt eaten a square meal since the last perigee, but he pulled himself together when he was needed and fed any new information into a statistical model, prepared long in advance, that would enable them to maximize their chances by ditching Amalthea and doing the big final burn at just the right times.But as he kept warning Ivy and Zeke, the time was coming soon when they would become so embroiled in the particulars of which rock was coming from which direction that it wouldnt be a statistical exercise anymore.It would be a video game, and its objective would be to build up speed while merging into a stream of large and small rocks that would be overtaking them with the speed of artillery shells.The details, the sudden distractions and improvisations, piled up and thickened in a way that made Dinah think of a sonic boom on Old Earth: the onrushing stream of air thickening and solidifying in the path of the airplane, turning into a barrier that must be broken through or succumbed to.They seemed to break through it at the point when Michael and two other spacewalkers pulled on their cooling garments, much patched and mended, and donned their space suits.Doob had the incoming heptad on radar, then on optical, and verified that it was on course to rendezvous with them.This meant, of course, that the heptad was on a collision course with Endurance; the difference between a collision and a rendezvous was the final burn of the heptads thrusters that would slow it down at the last minute and bring its params into nearly perfect synchronization with the larger ships.Endurance herself, still burdened with Amalthea and with many tons of stored propellant, had next to no maneuverability, and so it would all be up to Ada, or whoever was at the controls of her heptad.The reunion of Endurance and the Swarm began, as it turned out, with a collision.It was not a catastrophic high speed collision, but it certainly was no orderly and controlled rendezvous.Ada had the presence of mind to give them about thirty seconds warning.Until then it had all been going well.The heptad had approached, using its thrusters to kill most of its velocity relative to the larger ship, and executed some little burns intended to bring it home to the docking port.Then Ada announced, in a barely controlled tone of voice, that one of the thruster modules had run out of propellant and could no longer perform its function.Its too heavy, Zeke muttered.They loaded in too much cargo; the thrusters are eating too much fuel trying to push all of that crap around.The heptad came in too fast and at the wrong angle and crashed into Caboose 2, which was a module, recycled from the wreckage of the Shipyard three years ago, that they had plugged into the back of H1 to serve as the aft most thing in the Stack.They saw it happen on their screens, they felt it in their bones, and they heard the three spacewalkers exclaiming and cursing.A little storm of debris emerged from a hole that had evidently been torn in the skin of Caboose 2.C2 depressurized, Tekla reported.Sealed off from Stack.The debris cloud included one large object that had two arms, two legs, and a head.The limbs were flailing.Everyone watched silently.We lost Michael Park, one of the other spacewalkers announced.We need more people back there, Ivy announced to the crew in the Hammerhead.Ivys message was clear.Later we will mourn for Michael.Now we have other things to worry about.Moira, you stay, Ivy added.Moira hadnt even moved.She was accustomed to being treated, against her own will and instincts, like a cherished and fragile child.Maybe you could talk to Michael on the radio.Hell be alive for a while.Moira nodded, swallowed hard, and focused on her laptop, entering the commands needed to establish a private voice link to Michael.Dinah, you stay hererun the robots.We are going to have to do some improvising.Bo, go back.Steve too.Luisa, deal with Ada over voicefor me its too much stress and distraction.Stay in the Hammerhead and make that problem go away for me.Doob, stay here.Zeke, go back.Ivy looked around.If I havent mentioned your name yet, go back and see what you can do.Doob, youre the weatherman.Your job is to make announcements about the storm and when its going to hit.Half an hour, Doob said.But yes.I will do that.Moira, headphones on, had retreated into the quietest corner of the Hammerhead and was engaging in a murmured conversation with Michael.She was holding a cloth over her eyes to absorb tears before they broke loose in the cabin.Luisa had already gone into her assigned role and had been listening to a voice transmission from Ada.She says she is going to try again.I thought her thrusters were empty, Ivy said.She can transfer propellant from some of the other thruster modules to the empty one.Itll take a few minutes.She requests instructions on where to make the next attempt, since the docking port on Caboose 2 has been rendered unusable.With a bit of deliberation they agreed that the heptad should make its next attempt on a docking port in the old Zvezda module.Dinah, who had spent most of the last couple of days preparing for the docking to occur on Caboose 2, sent her robots scrambling forward along the outside of the Stack, bringing their cables with them.That caught her up in a stew of minor complications that more than filled the time it took for the heptad to get its dead thruster up and running again.They watched the second approach, and the docking, in silence.It took about ten minutes.Doob interrupted once to give an update on the approaching radiation storm.Unexpectedly, it was Moira who broke the silence.Dont let them dock, she said.What?!Ivy said.Its a trap.Zekes voice came over the PA: Positive docking achieved.Getting ready to open the hatch.Moira added, Michael figured it out.Fifteen minutes before the storm breaks, Doob announced.Dinah had entered into a state of intense focus on the problem to be solved, seeing through the eyes of ten different robots performing ten different tasks, occasionally blurting out terse requests to the two surviving spacewalkers, asking them to shake a stuck cable loose or pull a wriggling Grabb out of trouble.She tried to filter out the conversation between Moira and Ivy.What do you mean, its a trap?Adas heptad joined the mesh network as soon as it got within range, Moira said.If you check your email right now, or your Spacebook, youll see stuff flooding into it.Terabytes of old messages and posts that have been bottled up in the Swarm.Mailing list traffic thats three years old.So?Ivy asked.Michael saw some weird stuff just now, and drew my attention to it.Hes floating in space!Hes floating in space and checking his email.What weird stuff did he notice?Theyre cannibals, Ivy.We already know that.A few hours ago, Moira said, they slaughtered Tav and ate what was left of him.Dinah was having difficulty focusing on her work.They wanted to be well fed for today.The time was approaching when the spacewalkers would have to go to their airlocks and get indoors ahead of the storm.Dinah had to focus on them.There was nothing she could do about what Moira was saying.She began speaking to one of them but was interrupted when Zeke came over the PA again: Ten survivors aboard.Waiting for J. B. F.  to emerge from the hatch.Zeke, be on your toes, Ivy said.We have indications they may be up to no good.Get inside, Dinah said to the spacewalkers.Head for the nearest airlock.Stay away from the new people, we dont trust them.Ditching the rock, Ivy announced.A sharp hiss came through the walls as compressed air flooded the hair thin gap between the outer surface of the Hammerhead and the surrounding cavity of Amalthea.Plug your ears.Then, before anyone could comply, a shattering, sickening bang as Dinahs demolition charges went off, destroying the structural connections that joined Amalthea to Endurance.They felt a sharp jostlemore acceleration than they had experienced in three yearsas the Hammerhead sprang free, pushing the rest of Endurance along with it.Three minutes before the storm hits, Doob said.J. B. F.  is aboard, Luisa announced.She was on voice to Zeke and the rest of the crew aft, relaying what they said to the others in the Hammerhead.Her brow wrinkled.Somethings wrong with herI dont quite follow.Burning hard, Ivy announced.Meaning that they were near their apogee, entering the fringe of the main lunar debris cloud, and that all the surviving engines had just come on full force.She had inaugurated the big burn that would, with a delta vee of some twelve hundred meters per second, inject them into the debris cloud.Every loose object in the Hammerhead dropped to what was now the floor.At the same time they could hear all manner of percussion, from all over Endurance.Zekes voice came in over the voice link.We are in combat, he said.Combat?Ivy asked.They shot Steve Lake.We are now experiencing very high levels of high energy proton radiation from the CME, Doob announced.Everyone who is not in the Hammerhead should be getting into a storm shelter.Shot him?Ivy asked.With J. B. F. s revolver.I suggest you try to lock down the network, they are trying to backdoor it.After that, communications were hectic and confused for a minute, and seemed to suggest that adversaries in different parts of the ship were all trying to use the same channel.Then their communications went dead.The equipment still worked; theyd simply been locked out of the network.Ivy could still fly the ship, but none of them could talk to people outside the Hammerhead.They were startled by a metallic rapping on the hatch that sealed the Hammerhead off from the SCRUM.Dinahs ears soon read it as Morse code.Chocolate, she said.Thats kind of a code word between me and Tekla.I think we should open the hatch.They did so, not before arming themselves with whatever makeshift weapons they could find, and found Tekla, suffering from a knife wound to the hand; Zeke, looking flustered but unharmed; and a woman, barely recognizable as Julia Bliss Flaherty given that most of her hair was gone and she had both of her hands firmly clamped over her mouth.Tekla vaulted into the Hammerhead and pulled Julia along behind her.What is going on?Ivy demanded.Zeke held up both hands.I got this, he said.We have killed four of them already.Two more are casualties.We have them outnumbered.We just have to keep fighting.You need to get into a storm shelter, Ivy said.Tekla, unaccustomed to working in even weak gravity, had gotten her footing enough to drag Julia into a corner of the Hammerhead and sit her down on the floor.She then turned back toward the hatch.Dinah had never seen Tekla in this state before, and feared her greatly in that moment.Moira had a different reaction; peeling off her headphones, she lurched across the space and threw her arms around Teklas neck.It looked like a greeting but soon developed into something else as Tekla began dragging Moira toward the hatch and Moira began trying to prevent her from returning to the fray.Sweet one, Tekla was mumbling into Moiras ear, you want me to use wrestling moves on you?Then you should let me go, because I am going to kill that bitch Ada.Zipping into storm shelters is exactly what they wanted us to do, Zeke explained.Their plan was to take the ship as soon as we did so.Good thing you warned us.Tekla by now had peeled herself loose from Moiras grip and advanced toward the hatch with a full stride.Zeke, waiting for her, reached out with one hand.He was holding a small black plastic box.He pressed it against Teklas thigh and pulled a little trigger on its side.The device erupted with a sharp ticking, buzzing noise.Teklas leg collapsed and she floated to the floor, glassy eyed.Sorry, Tekla, Zeke said.You stay here.Get your hand fixed.Keep Moira companyshe needs you.And if you have a little boy, name it Zeke.Then, before any of them could respond, he slammed the hatch shut.In the silence that followed, a sharp crack resounded through the structure of Endurance.Everyone knew the sound: theyd just taken a hit from a bolide.Arent you supposed to be flying the ship?Doob shouted to Ivy.Wordlessly, Ivy went back to her screen.Dinah rounded on Julia.What the hell is going on?she demanded.Julias hair had been cropped.In the last three years it had gone silvery.Her hands still obscured the lower half of her face.Her eyes were clearly recognizable, though without benefit of cosmetics they seemed to be staring out of a face two decades older.Slowly she removed her hands.She was sticking her tongue out.It looked like a piece of metal was caught in her teeth.On a closer look, it was clear that J. B. F.  now had a pierced tongue.It had been done cleanly and professionally; there was no bleeding, no apparent signs of infection or discomfort.A stainless steel bolt about two inches long had been inserted vertically through the piercing, fixed in place with nuts and washers above and below the tongue.It was too long to fit into Julias mouth, so it kept her tongue stretched out.Above and below, the rod pressed against her lips.Oh Jesus Christ, Dinah said.Julia tapped at the bolt with one finger, then made screwing and unscrewing gestures with both hands.The nuts had been doubled, and torqued tightly against each other.Dinah took a multitool from a holster on her belt and unfolded its needlenosed pliers, then borrowed Ivys.By twisting gently in opposite directions she was able to loosen the nuts.Julia pushed her away and unscrewed the nuts with her fingertips, then gently extracted the bolt.Her tongue retracted into her mouth.She put one hand over her lips and leaned back against a bulkhead for a few moments, moving her jaw to work up some saliva and get limbered up.When she finally spoke, Julia sounded weirdly normal, as if delivering remarks from the White House briefing room.When we surrendered, she said, they took my gun, and they tortured Spencer Grindstaff until he spilled everything he knew about the IT systems here.All the passwords, all the back doors, all the details as to how it all works.Exactly what they would need in order to take the place over.Then they killed him, and ...Ate him?Julia nodded.They have a sort of hacker type among their group.When he came on board just now, he went to a terminal and began to execute this plan.Steve Lake tried to stop him.One of the others had the gunshot Steve to death.That was always part of their plan.They knew that only Steve could stop them.How many bullets are left in that thing?Im sure it is empty now.Most of them are using knives and clubs.They didnt expect a real fight, because ...Because they thought wed all be zipped up in our storm shelters, Dinah said, like lambs to the slaughter.THE BIG BURN LASTED FOR THE BETTER PART OF AN HOUR.BY THE end of it, theyd consumed so much propellant and made Endurance so light that acceleration made the blood fall out of their heads and pool in their feet.Ivy piloted the ship lying flat on her back, lest she lose consciousness.The journey was punctuated by a few terrific bangs, and those who could stand to watch Endurances status readouts could observe various modules turning yellow, then red, then black as they succumbed to damage.Dinah watched through the eyes of several cameras as a ten mile long piece of the moon tumbled past them, overtaking them and zooming by just a few hundred meters to their starboard side.Nor was that the last such encounter; but with Doob acting as her wing man, calling out the biggest threats, and with Dinah making such use as she could of Parambulator, Ivy was able to steer them clear of the big stuff.They had no way of knowing the progress of the combat aft.Zeke had spoken optimistically of their odds, but there was no telling how the damage theyd taken from bolides might have swung the course of the battle to one side or the other.Endurances automatic sealing off of damaged parts of the ship had now partitioned her into a number of separate zones between which movement was impossible.Zero gee returned, meaning that the engines had shut off.They were now traveling as fast, on average, as the rest of the debris cloud.Dinah had only just adjusted to the steady acceleration of the big burn and now felt a wave of sickness come over her as the inner ear readjusted.Her eyes closed and she sank into a sort of catnap, floating loosely around the Hammerhead, thudding gently against a wall every so often when Ivy used the thrusters to avoid a rock.Then she realized shed been fully asleep for a time.Part of her wanted to stay that way.But she knew that big things were happening, so she opened her eyes, half expecting to find herself alone, the last person alive.Ivy was the only person awake, her face lit up by her screen.And for the first time in a long time, it looked the way it had used to when shed been on the track of some fascinating science problem: alive, intent, fiercely joyful.Whys it so quiet?Dinah asked.For it seemed to her that it had been a long time since she had heard the crack of a bolide or sensed the thrust of one of Endurances engines.Were in the shadow, Ivy said.A new Cone of Protection.Cmere.She tossed her head.Dinah came around behind and hooked her chin over her friends shoulder.The monitor had several windows open.Ivy enlarged one of them to fill most of the screen.A legend superimposed at the bottom identified it as AFT CAMERA.The field of view was entirely filled by a close up image of a huge asteroid.Dinah was an asteroid miner.She had looked at many pictures of asteroids in her day.She had learned to recognize them by their shapes and their textures.She had no difficulty in identifying this one.Cleft, she said.Ivy reached out and touched the screen.Red crosshairs appeared beneath her fingertip, which she dragged across the big rocks surface until centered on a vast black crevasse that looked like it nearly split the asteroid in two: the canyon that had given this rock its name.She pulled her finger away, leaving the crosshairs in the middle of the cleft.I was thinking there, she said.How about a little below, where it gets wider?I dont think we want a wide place.Too much exposure.Go there, then, Dinah suggested, reaching out and dragging the crosshairs to a slightly different location.Then we can snuggle into the narrow part once weve gotten inside.You ladies enjoying yourselves?Doob rasped.Not as much as youre going to in about an hour, Ivy said.Ill try to hold out that long.THERE WAS NO PROBLEM GETTING INTO IT.IVY FLEW ENDURANCE into the great crevasse like a Piper Cub into the Grand Canyon.Within minutes the walls were reaching far above them.The bottom was still lost in shadow.Following Dinahs general suggestion, Ivy then nudged the ship toward a part of the canyon, several tens of kilometers distant, where the walls converged and the radioactive sky became a narrow, starry slit above.Still she kept pushing onward, occasionally scraping the ships outlying modules against the walls, until she reached a place where she could go no deeper.Looking both directions along the crevasse from this place, they could see spots where the sun was shining in.Here, though, they were protected from rocks and radiation alike.Ivy set Endurance down on the floor of the canyon.Clefts gravity was exceedingly faint, but it was enough to give words like that a little meaning, and it was enough to keep the ship lodged in one place until they decided to move it.Which they never would.Cleft  ON THE SURFACE OF CLEFT, A HUMAN WEIGHED ABOUT AS MUCH AS three pints of beer would weigh on Earth.Endurance weighed about as much as a couple of semi trailer rigs.Ivy lit the ships attitude control thrusters one last time and pivoted her tail up until it was vertical.Endurance was standing on her head, the torus aloft, iron Hammerhead nose down on the iron floor of the crevasse.Dinah sent out some Grabbs to weld the ship to the asteroid.Ivy shut down the thrusters.Endurance was no longer a ship but a building.From the Hammerhead, now one piece of metal with Cleft, the Stack ran straight up like the trunk of a tree.Various structures ramified outward from it like boughs.Its widest part was the array of eighty one arklets that had formerly made up the stern of the ship.These now projected upward like leaves.Or so they imagined.They couldnt actually go outside and look at it until they got out of the Hammerhead.During the battle, they had sealed the hatch.By the time they had brought her to rest and welded her down, the rest of Endurance had been quiet for a long time.Finally they opened the hatch and began to explore it one module at a time.They sent Buckies and Siwis out ahead of them to illuminate dark spaces and aim cameras into hidden corners.Tekla then went in, taking point, with Dinah and Ivy watching her back.They were armed with cudgels made from lengths of pipe.But they never had to use them.It was some combination of crime scene, battleground, and disaster zone.Only about half of the modules were still pressurized.Some of them had become completely isolated and could only be reached by a person in a space suit.It took days to get to them all.In one of them they found Ada, the only other survivor from the heptad.Two days had passed since she had eaten the last of Tavistock Prowse, so she was very hungry, but otherwise in good shape.After becoming trapped by a combination of combat and bolide strikes, she had holed up in a water filled storm shelter, then begun drinking its contents as she awaited rescue.The total number of living humans was now sixteen.Several had suffered injuries from combat or from the consequences of bolide strikes.Anyone who had not taken shelter in the Hammerhead, or in a storm shelter, was suffering from radiation sickness.The healthy ones patched holes, repressurized modules, got the torus spinning again, and turned it into a sick bay, which filled up immediately.Dinah managed to get Doob out for one last space walk.He had been failing for days.Once they got him into the suit, though, his energy flooded back.Dinah took him out on the floor of the crevasse where he could walk, light footed, with magnetized Grabbs latched onto his boots to keep him from floating away with every step.They rambled for about a kilometer, turning around every so often to look back at humanitys new home.Above the spinning torus, where Moira was even now unpacking her genetics lab, Tekla was inspecting the arklets on the top level, learning which were whole, which were beyond repair, and which could be patched up for future occupancy.On the floor of the crevasse, Grabbs and Siwis were at work, rooting Endurance to her final resting place with spreading cables and struts.Where they walked, it was dark most of the time.That was the price of being sheltered from cosmic rays and coronal mass ejections.Looking up, however, they could see sunlight gilding the edges of the crevasse above them.They talked about how to set up mirrors that would bounce sunlight downward onto the arklets, which could grow food and scrub air in their translucent outer hulls.Doob spoke of Endomement, the idea that, in time, a ceiling could be thrown over the top of the crevasse and walls built to keep in the air, whereupon a whole section of the valley could be given an atmosphere and turned into a place where children could go outside without the need for space suits.Then he walked home and died.They stored his body with the others, in a damaged arklet that would serve as a mausoleum until such time as they could cut a grave out of Clefts surface.That would take a long time, but the survivors all shared the conviction that, having sacrificed so much to make it here, they should be interred and not burned.Doob would share a grave with Zeke Petersen, Bolor Erdene, Steve Lake, and all the others who had died at about the same time.Some of those remained conscious long enough to relate the stories of what had happened to them during the conflict with the people who had come in from the Swarm, and Endurances final, hectic passage through storm and stone.Their accounts were recorded and archived.One day some historian would piece the story together, comparing it with data logs to figure out who had slain whom in combat and which module had gone dark when.Ada, of course, might have been their best source of information, had she felt like talking.But she didnt.She had sunk into a profound depression, emerging from it at seemingly random moments to chatter about whatever stray thoughts were flitting through her head.No one wanted to talk to her.When she talked to you, she watched you too carefully with those avid, penetrating eyes, as if she saw, or imagined she saw, too deeply.It was impossible to be the object of that gaze without thinking of what she and the others had done, and without imagining that you were being sized up as food.An epic tale was told by the three year backlog of email, Spacebook posts, blog entries, and other ephemera that filled up all of their inboxes as soon as the network of the Swarm recombined with that of Endurance.The general arc of the story seemed to be a growing detachment from reality that had afflicted J. B. F.  and some of her inner circle.Luisa likened it to the growth of spiritualism after the First World War.During the 1920s, many who had not been able to bring themselves to accept the loss of life in the trenches and the subsequent influenza epidemic had fallen prey to the belief that they could communicate with their lost loved ones from beyond the grave.They had, in effect, sidestepped grief by convincing themselves that nothing had happened.The analogy was a loose one.The loss of life in the Hard Rain had, of course, been much worse.And few of the Arkies had adopted spiritualist beliefs per se.But after a particularly severe coronal mass ejection had slain nearly a hundred Arkies, Tav had written a blog post about the journey he had made to Bhutan with Doob and the conversation that theyd had en route with the king concerning the mathematics of reincarnation.It was a meditative piece, a secular eulogy for those who had fallen, but in retrospect it seemed to mark an inflection point in the survivors thinking.The Swarm had always had a sort of quasi divine status to some, who had perhaps read too much chaos theory too superficially and were prone to believing that its collective decisions, lying beyond human understanding, partook of the supernatural.The mishmash of techno mystical ideation that had grown out of that one blog post was unreadable and incomprehensible to Luisa or to anyone else who read it after the fact, with a clear mind, but it seemed to have offered hope and comfort to many terrified young people trapped in arklets.Tav, to his credit, had backed away from any efforts to elevate him to prophetlike status.If anything, though, his modesty might have backfired.I have no idea, Luisa said, how anyone could read these threads and find hope in them.Or even meaning.But they did.Long enough to distract them from the real problems they were facing.And when Ada and the others finally came to their senses and began to push back against J. B. F.  and the others, the reaction was just that much more severe.Because things had gone too far by that point.The backlash had started in a two triad bolo where a number of like minded Arkies, including Ada, had called bullshit on the prevailing tone and substance of official statements emanating from the White Arklet and begun to denounce Tavistock Prowse as a puppet blogger for the regime.Dubbing themselves the Black Bolo Brigade, they had begun to spread their insurrectionist message to other arklets in the Swarm.That messagewhich made perfect sense, as far as it wentwas all about the need to face reality and to implement realistic, effective steps to address the Swarms problems.That included, if need be, throwing themselves on the mercy of Endurance.They had demanded that J. B. F.  open the books and provide a current and accurate account of all stocks of water, food, and other staples, and how those numbers were changing over time.Julia had resisted those demands until the data had finally been leaked by a turncoat on her staff.The food picture had turned out to be bleak.This had led to a variety of responses that had determined the history and politics of the Swarm ever since: among some, a further retreat into mysticism and wishful thinking, based on a belief that the Agent had been some sort of avenging angel sent by God, or by aliens so powerful that they might as well be God, to bring about the end of days and the merging of all human consciousness into a digital swarm in the sky; among others, a frank embrace of cannibalismin the sense not of killing people for food but of eating those who had died of natural causesas a stopgap measure until J. B. F.  could be toppled and replaced by people who knew what they were doing.The first group, the mystics, had tended to rally under Julias banner.The cannibals had ended up under Ada, who because of her intensity and her charisma had gradually emerged as the leader of the Black Bolo Brigade.The one Swarm had thus fissioned into two smaller ones, neither of which was as viable, and thereby worsened the same problems that had led to the split in the first place.From there the story had been predictable enough, and had led to the events of the last few days.Ada still wasnt talking, but Julia was.According to her, Ada and the other Black Bolo survivors had calculated, in the last weeks, that their turn to cannibalism would be so repugnant to the survivors of Endurance as to render them permanent outcasts.Rather than passively await the judgmentwhich they foresaw as extremely pious, sanctimonious, and punitiveof Ivy and her claque, they would seize part or all of Endurance, beginning with her network, and then negotiate terms from a position of strength.This explained, at least in a general way, everything that had happened, save possibly for the physical mutilation of both Julia and Tav.Asked for a theory as to that, Julia shrugged.We were criminals to them.Criminals need to be punished.Its hard to punish people who are already starving to death in a confined space.What is really left in the executioners tool kit, other than attacking the body?They wanted to silence me, and so they did.And they wanted to give Tav a taste of his own medicine by uploading his physical body into theirs.A WEEK LATER, WHEN THE LAST OF THE VICTIMS HAD SUCCUMBED to their wounds or to radiation sickness, eight humans remained alive and healthy.Ivy called for a twenty four hour pause to grieve and to take stock.She then called a meeting of the entire human race: Dinah, Ivy, Moira, Tekla, Julia, Ada, Camila, and Luisa.They did not know quite what to do with Julia and Ada.For years they had dreamed, in idle moments, of one day bringing J. B. F.  to justicewhatever that would mean.Then, at the last moment, she had been eclipsed by Ada.And now it all seemed a moot point anyway.Could six women put two women in jail?What would it mean to be in jail in a place like this?Corporal punishment was at least a theoretical possibility.But Ada had already gone there, with results that they all found sickening.J. B. F.  was a threat to no one.Ada still possessed an air of menace.But short of locking her up in an arklet, there was nothing they could do about that save keep an eye on her.And so they did, never letting her out of their sight, never letting her get behind them.They met in the Banana, sitting around the long conference table.To one side of it was death: the sick bay where Zeke, the last man alive, had given up the ghost a day and a half ago, after making a joke about what a shame it all was: being the only man alive, with eight women to choose from.They had scrubbed the place down with bleach and made the beds with clean sheets in the hopes that none of them would be occupied for a long time.To the other side was life: the series of compartments where Moira had been setting up her genetics lab.The meeting would later be known as the Council of the Seven Eves.For, though eight women were present, one of themLuisahad already gone through menopause.Ivy opened with a report on their general situation.From a certain point of view, this was surprisingly good.They had grown so inured to terrible news that she had to emphasize this more than once.Few places in the solar system were as safe as the one where they had come to rest.No cosmic radiation could touch them here.From coronal mass ejections they were equally immune.Sunlight for energy and agriculture could be had a short distance above them, high on the walls of the crevasse, where the sun shone almost all the time.In the meantime, their big reactor as well as four dozen arklet reactors were producing far more power than they could ever use, and would continue doing so for decades.Of water they still had a hundred tons left over.While melting and splitting the water theyd used for propellant, they had extracted from it many tons of phosphorus, carbon, ammonia, and other chemicals, left over from the dawn of the solar system, that had once cloaked Gregs Skeleton in a reeking black carapace.That stuff, as Sean Probst had well known, would be priceless as nutrients to support agriculture.They no longer had to worry, ever again, about the things that had been their obsessive concerns for the last five years: perigees, apogees, burns, propellant, movement of any kind.No bolide could touch them down here.Even if Cleft banged into an equally huge rock at some point, they would probably survive it.The vitamins that had been packed into every arklet launched up into the Cloud Ark had been intended to support a population of thousands.Even though many of these had been lost, what remained was still more than enough to keep a small colony in aspirin and toothbrushes for a long time.They were dependent, in many ways, on digital technology.They could not long survive without robots to do work for them and computerized control systems to keep the installation running.They had no ability to fabricate new computer chips to replace the old.But the Arkitects, anticipating this, had stocked them with a large surplus of spare parts that would last for hundreds of years if husbanded carefully.And they had plans for rebooting digital civilization later; they had tools for making tools for making tools, and instructions on how to use them when the time came.With immediate needs accounted for, the discussion turned toward the obvious problem at hand.All heads turned toward Moira.My equipment made it through perfectly unscathed, she said.The last three years have been boring for me.Ive been treated as a fragile flower.I have spent the time writing up everything I know about how to use that stuff.If I drop dead of something tomorrow, youll still be able to work it out.Obviously, were all women.Seven of us are still capable of having babies.Or, to be specific, of producing eggs.So, where can we get some sperm?Well, ninety seven percent of what was sent up from Earth was destroyed in the disaster on the first day of the Hard Rain.What survived, survived because it had already been distributed among ten different arklets.All ten of those later ended up going off with the Swarm.None of that material, however, seems to have made its way here.Ada interrupted.Staring across the table at Julia, she announced, I was in the Swarm, as you know.I can tell you that this fact of the samples in the ten arklets was forgotten.Never discussed.If anyone even knew they were there, they forgot about it soon.Julia was construing this as an attack on her record.We had eight hundred healthy young men and women from every ethnic group in the world.Had, Ada repeated.We had.The amount of effort required to keep a few sample containers deep frozen wasnt worth the Stop, Ivy said.If we can start making babies, their great grandchildren can pore over the records and make judgments and have debates about what should have been done.Now isnt the time for recriminations.I was in the meeting where Markus called bullshit on the Human Genetic Archive, Dinah said.She was mildly amazed to hear herself backing Julias side of the argument.We cant make the same mistake again, Ada said, of fooling ourselves.Believing in shit that isnt real.Ivy said, Had we known that it was going to come down, so suddenly, to seven surviving fertile women, we would have had every healthy male masturbating into test tubes for the last three years.Wed have looked for ways to keep it all frozen.But we never imagined it would come to this.Its not clear what the quality of the results would have been, Moira put in.Given the amount of radiation exposure, I probably would have had to do a lot of manual repair on the genetic material in those samples.Manual repair?Julia asked.I should put that in scare quotes, Moira said, reaching up with both hands and crooking her fingers.Obviously Im not literally using my hands.But with the equipment in thereshe tossed her head in the direction of the labI can isolate a cella sperm or an ovumand read its genome.Im skipping over a lot of details, obviously.But the point is that I can get a digital record of its DNA.Once thats in hand, it turns into a software exercisethe data can be evaluated and compared to huge databases that shipped up as part of the lab.Its possible to identify places on a given chromosome where a bit of DNA got damaged by a cosmic ray or radiation from the reactor.It is then possible to repair those breaks by splicing in a reasonable guess as to what was there originally.It sounds like a lot of work, Camila said.If there is anything I can do to ease your burdens and make myself useful, I am at your disposal.Thank you.We will all be working at it for months, Moira said, before anything happens.We have very little else to do.Excuse me, but what is the point of discussing this, since we have no sperm to work with?Ada asked.We dont need sperm, Moira said.We dont need sperm to get pregnant!This is news to me, Ada said, with a sharp laugh.Moira went on coolly.There is a process known as parthenogenesis, literally virgin birth, by which a uniparental embryo can be created out of a normal egg.Its been done with animals.The only reason no one ever did it with humans is because it seemed ethically dodgy, as well as completely unnecessary given the willingness of men to impregnate women every chance they got.Can you do it here, Moira?asked Luisa.Its not fundamentally more difficult than the sorts of tricks I was just describing in the case of repairing damaged sperm.In some ways, it would actually be easier.You can get us pregnant ...by ourselves, Tekla said.Yes.Everyone except Luisa.I can have a child of whom I am both the mother and the father, Ada said.The idea clearly fascinated her.Suddenly she was no longer the prickly, brittle Ada but the warm and engaged girl who must have charmed the powers that be during the Casting of Lots.It will take some tricky work in the lab, Moira said.But that is the whole point of having brought the lab safely to this place.They all pondered it for a bit.Julia was the first to speak up.Stepping into my traditional role as scientific ignoramus: Do you mean to say that you can clone us?Moira noddednot to say yes, but to say I understand your question.There are different ways to do it, Julia.One way would indeed produce clonesall offspring genetically identical to the mother.This isnt what we want.For one thing, it would not solve our basic problemthe lack of males.Camilas hand went up.Moira, clearly annoyed by the interruption, blinked once, then nodded at her.Is it really a problem?Camila asked.As long as we have the lab and can go on making more clones, would it really be such a bad thing to have a society with no males?At least for several generations?Moira silenced her with a gentle pushing movement of one hand.Thats a question for later.There is another problem with this version of parthenogenesis, which is, again, that all offspring are the same.Exact copies.To get some genetic diversity, we need to use something called automictic parthenogenesis.Look, its a long story, but the point is that in normal sexual reproduction there is crossing over of chromosomes during meiosis.Its a form of natural recombination of DNA.Its what causes your children to look sort of like you, but not exactly like you.In the form of parthenogenesis that I am proposing to use, there would be that crossing over.An element of randomness.And both boys and girls?Dinah asked.Thats harder, Moira admitted.Synthesizing a Y chromosome is no joke.My prediction is that the first set of babiesperhaps the first few sets of themwill all be female.Because we simply need to get the population up.During that time I can be working on the Y chromosome problem.Later on, I hope that some little boys will result.But these little girlsand later the boyswill still be made out of our own DNA?Ivy asked.Yes.So theyll be quite similar to us genetically.If I do nothing about it, Moira said, theyll be like sisters.Perhaps even more similar than that implies.But there are a few tricks that I can use to create a wider range of genotypes out of the same source material.Perhaps theyll be more like cousins.I dont know, its never been tried.Are we talking about the inbreeding problem?It sounds like it, Dinah said.Loss of heterozygosity.Yes.I happen to know something about it.Its why I was chosen as a member of the General Population.Because of your work on black footed ferrets and so on, Ivy said.Yes.This is a closely analogous problem.But the point I would like you all to keep in mind is that we solved that problem in the case of the black footed ferrets and we are going to solve it again.She said it with force and confidence that silenced the others for a few moments and left them looking at her for more.Moira went on.I think we all have at least an intuitive understanding of this, yes?That one was aimed at Julia, who looked mildly peeved, and bit off the following: My daughter had Down syndrome.That is all I will say.Moira acknowledged it with a nod, then went on: Everyone has some genetic defects.When you are breeding more or less randomly within a large population, theres a tendency for those errors to be swamped by the law of averages.Everything sort of works out.But when two people sharing the same defect mate, their offspring is likely to have that defect as well, and over time we see the usual unpleasantness that we all associate in our minds with inbreeding.So, Luisa said, if we follow the plan you have laid out, and begin, a few years down the road, with seven groups of what amount to siblings or cousins Its not enough heterozygosity, to answer your question, Moira said.If you have a genetic predisposition to any disease, for example Alpha thalassemia runs in my family, Ivy said.Thats a fine example, Moira returned.As it happens, Old Earth compiled vast databases on such things before its destruction.All of which are in there now.She gestured in the direction of her lab.We have a very good idea which defects, on which chromosomes, are responsible for alpha thalassemia.If you supply me with an ovum, I can find those defects and I can fix them before we begin parthenogenesis.Your offspring will be free of that defect.Barring some random future mutation, itll never return.Dinah raised her hand.My brother was a carrier of cystic fibrosis.I havent been tested.Julia raised hers.Three of my aunts died of the same form of breast cancer.Ive been tested.I know I carry that defect as well.The same answer applies in all of these cases, Moira said.If theres a genetic test for it, then it means, by definition, that we know which defects are responsible for it.And knowing that, we can perform a repair.A new voice joined the conversation.How about bipolar disorder?Everyone looked at Ada.She would live out the rest of her life, and go to meet her maker, without having a friend, or even a friendly conversation.So, no one was in a receptive frame of mind about her question.But the mere fact that shed asked it suggested a level of introspection they hadnt seen from her before.Moira considered it.I would have to do some research.I think that it does run in families to some extent.To the extent that it can be traced to particular locations on particular chromosomes, it can be treated like any other disease, Moira said.Do you believe it should be?Ada asked.Everyone looked automatically at Luisa, who nodded.We are long past the point of thinking of mental illnesses as somehow a lesser kind of disease than physical.Such disorders should, in my opinion, be addressed in just the same way.Do you believe it must be?Luisa colored slightly.What is the point of these questions, Ada?I have done research on it, Ada said.Some say that bipolarity is a useful adaptation.When things are bad, you become depressed, retreat, conserve energy.When things are good, you spring into action with great energy.And your point is ...Will you treat this condition in my offspring against my will?What if I want to have a lot of little bipolar kids?In the flustered silence that followed, Camila spoke.What about aggression?Everyone turned to look at her, as if unsure they had heard her correctly.Im serious, she said.She looked toward Ada.I dont mean to trivialize the suffering that your condition causes.But over the course of history, aggression has caused a far larger amount of pain and death than bipolar disorder or whatever.As long as we are fixing those aspects of the human psyche that lead to suffering, should we not eliminate the tendency to aggressive behavior?Thats different, Moira began.But she was interrupted by Dinah.Hold on a sec, Dinah said.Im aggressive.I always have been.I was on track to be an Olympic soccer player!Thats the only way Ive ever been able to amount to anythingby channeling my aggression into doing things.She nodded across the table at Tekla.Hell, look at her!How many times has she saved our asses by being aggressive?Tekla nodded.Yes.Dinah saved me by taking aggressive action against rules of space station.Problem is not aggression.It is lack of discipline.A person can be aggressiveshe nodded at Dinahand still be constructive in society if she controls her passions.And she threw a significant glare at Ada, who let out a little snort and looked away.So youre suggesting we breed people for discipline and self control?Ivy asked.Im not sure if I follow.I believe that Camila was merely saying that certain personality types, taken to an unhealthy extreme, are as bad as diagnosable mental illnesses per se.If not worse, Julia said.I dont want you to speak for me, Camila said.Please do not speak for me anymore, Julia.I am merely trying to be helpful, Julia said.But where the old J. B. F.  would have said it reproachfully, the new one merely seemed exhausted.Dinah broke in.Well, what I am trying to say is that I dont appreciate being labeled as a genetic freak that needs to be eradicated from the human future.No one would say that of you, Dinah, Ivy said.Camilas talking about the knuckle draggers who tried to kill her for wanting an education.And what is your opinion?Tekla asked Ivy.Similar to yours.Aggression is fine.It needs to be controlled.Directed.But the way to do that is through intelligence.Rational thought.That elicited a cackle from Ada.Oh, sorry, she said.I was thinking about the Swarm.Eight hundred people all carefully hand selected for intelligence and rational thought.In the end, all we could think about was how they tasted.None of us ate each other, Ivy said.But you thought about it, Ada said with a smile.Dinah slammed her palm hard on the table.She sat still for a moment with her eyes closed tight, then stood up and walked out of the room.I guess she is not disciplined or intelligent enough to control her aggression!Ada cracked.It is a form of self discipline, Tekla said.So that she would not kill you.You see, Ada, thinking about doing such things and doing are different.This is why greater discipline is a requirement.Sweetie, what do you mean when you speak of discipline?Moira asked.Im just trying to cash that word out in terms of genetics.I can find a genetic marker for cystic fibrosis.Im not sure if the same is true of discipline.Some races are disciplined.Is fact, Tekla said.Japanese are more disciplined than ...Italians.She gave Ada a stare that would have frozen most people to their chairs, but Ada just threw her head back and laughed exultantly.You are forgetting the Roman legions, but please go on.Men are more disciplined than women.Is just fact.So there must be genes for it.This produced yet another silence, eventually broken by Luisa: Im seeing a side of you I didnt know about, Tekla.Call me bad, call me racist if you want.I know what you will say: That it is all training.It is all culture.I disagree.If you do not feel pain, you do not respond to pain.And hormones.What about hormones, lover?Moira asked.Her affection for Tekla was obvious, and took some of the tension out of the room.We all know that when hormones are a certain way, emotions have big impact.Other times, not so much.This is genetic.Or maybe epigenetic.We really dont know, Moira said.Whatever, Tekla said.My point is that for people to live in tin cans for hundreds of years requires order and discipline.Not from above.From within.If there is a way to make this easier with your genetic lab, then we should do it.Luisa said, We never explored Ivys point that intelligence was key.Yes, Ivy said, with a glance at Ada.I was interrupted.Ada covered her mouth with her hand and sniggered theatrically.Ivy went on: If we are really going to open the door to genetic improvement of our offspring, then it seems obvious to me that we should look to the one quality that trumps all others.And that is clearly intelligence.What do you mean it trumps all others?Luisa asked.With intelligence, you can see the need to show discipline when the situation calls for it.Or to act aggressively.Or not.I would argue that the human mind is mutable enough that it can become all of the different types of people that Camila, Ada, and Tekla have been describing.But thats all driven by what separates us from the animals.Which is our brains.There are many different types of intelligence, Luisa said.Ivy gave a little shake of her head.Ive seen all of that stuff about emotional intelligence and what have you.Okay.Fine.But you know exactly what Im talking about.And you know it can be propagated genetically.Just look at the academic records, the test scores of the Ashkenazi Jews.Speaking as a Sephardic Jew, Luisa said, you can imagine my mixed feelings.We need brains, is the bottom line, Ivy said.Were not hunter gatherers anymore.Were all living like patients in the intensive care unit of a hospital.What keeps us alive isnt bravery, or athleticism, or any of those other skills that were valuable in a caveman society.Its our ability to master complex technological skills.It is our ability to be nerds.We need to breed nerds.She turned to look Ada full in the face.You ask for realism.Your complaint about hershe nodded at Juliaand the people around her was that they were holding out panaceas.Not facing facts.Fine.Im giving you facts.Were all nerds now.We might as well get good at it.Ada shook her head in derision.You completely leave out the human component.Its why you are a bad leader.Its why you were replaced by Markus, when wiser people than you were in control.And its why we are here.Here, safe and sound, Ivy said, unlike the people who followed you.All of whom are dead.So they are, Ada said, and I am alive, and I can see how its going to be: you are going to keep me locked up in an arklet making genetic freak babies and taking them away from me.And she broke down weeping.She has what I have, except worse, Julia explained.She sees many outcomesmost of which, given the circumstances, are darkthen acts upon them.What an unusual degree of introspection from you, Julia, Moira said.You have no concept of my level of introspection, Julia shot back.I have been clinically depressed for most of my life.I once used drugs to fix it.Then I stopped.I stopped because I decided they were making me stupid, and Id rather be miserable than stupid.I am what I am.Depression is genetically based to some extent.Would you like me to erase it from your childrens genomes?Moira asked.You heard what I said, Julia answered.You know, now, the decision I made.Which was to suffer for the greater good.Because society will go astray if there are not those who, like me, imagine many outcomes.Let those scenarios run rampant in their minds.Anticipate the worst that could happen.Take steps to prevent it.If the price of thatthe price of having a head full of dark imaginingsis personal suffering, then so be it.But would you wish that on your progeny?Of course not, Julia said.If there were a way to have one without the otherthe foresight without the miseryI would take it in a heartbeat.We only need a few people of this mentality, Tekla said.Too many, and you get the Soviet Union.I am forty seven, Julia said.I have one baby in me, if Im lucky.The rest of you can punch them out for twenty years.Do the math.It amazes me that we have already gone over to the competitive angle!Camila wailed.I am so sorry that I brought this topic up.A sharp rapping noise brought the room to attention.Heads turned toward the Bananas window.It was not largeabout the size of a dinner plate.For three years it had been buried in ice and forgotten about.But now it afforded a clear if somewhat dizzying view of their surroundings.Outside of it, carabinered to the spinning torus, was Dinah.She had put on a space suit and gone out through an airlock.Seeing she had their attention, she reached up and slapped a small object onto the glass.It was a lump of clay, some wires, and an electronic gadget.She depressed a button on the gadget and it began to count down from ten minutes.Ada screamed with laughter and clapped her hands.What on earth is she doing?Julia asked.Thats a demolition charge, Ivy said.Its going to kill us all ten minutes from now if she doesnt take it off the window.She turned to survey the room.Well, what is her point?Julia demanded.I think my friend is trying to tell us that if we cant settle this in ten minutes, the human race doesnt deserve to go on existing, Ivy said.They all sat silently for perhaps half a minute before Moira said: Hows this: every woman decides what is going to be done with her eggs.Hearing no objection, she continued: Oh, let me be clear.If its a real diseasesomething on the books, defined in the medical literature as suchthen I will fix it.With no distinctions made between physical and mental disorders.No matter how many of those conditions each of you may be suffering from, I will fix them all before taking any other action.However.And she smiled, and held up an index finger.Once all that is done, each of us gets a free one.Free what?Tekla asked.One alterationone improvementof your choice, applied to the genome of the fertilized ovum that will grow into your child.And your child only.You cannot force it on any of the others.So, Camila, if you think it would improve the human race to get rid of its aggression, why then, I will search through the scientific literature for a way to reach toward your goal genetically.And likewise for the rest of you, and whatever changes you happen to think will improve the human condition.Your child, your choice.They all considered it, glancing at one another from time to time, each trying to gauge the others reactions.Ivy glanced at the timer outside.Are there any questions?We have eight minutes remaining.Luisa said, I dont think we need eight minutes.Ivy looked each of them in the eye, then turned toward the window and gave a thumbs up.Dinahs eyes, seen through the glass of the window and the dome of her space suits helmet, pivoted to focus on that.She nodded.Moira smiled and put her thumb up.This too was noted by Dinah.Then Tekla.Then Luisa, Camila, Julia.All eyes were on Ada.She would not look back at them.She was, at bottom, very shy.Whatever, she mumbled.She needs to see your vote, Ivy said.Really?You mean that I could single handedly destroy the entire human race, simply by not putting my thumb up in the next seven minutes?Tekla pulled a folding knife from a pocket on her coverall and flicked the blade open.She kept it low, down in her lap, and pretended to clean a fingernail with it.Either that, Tekla said, or population of human race suddenly goes from eight to seven, and we have unanimous decision.Smiling, Ada thrust her hand out, thumb down.I pronounce a curse, she said.Luisa let out an exasperated sigh.This is not a curse that I create.It is not a curse on your children.No.I have never been as bad as you all think that I am.This is a curse that you have created, by doing this thing that you are about to do.And it is a curse upon my children.Because I know.I see how it is to be.I am the evil one.The cannibal.The one who would not go along.My children, no matter what decision I make, will forever be different from your children.Because make no mistake.What you have decided to do is to create new races.Seven new races.They will be separate and distinct forever, as much as you, Moira, are from Ivy.They will never merge into a single human race again, because that is not the way of humanity.Thousands of years from now, the descendants of you six will look at my descendants and say, Ah, look, there is a child of Ada, the cannibal, the evil one, the cursed one.They will cross the street to avoid my children; they will spit on the ground.This is the thing that you have done by making this decision.I will shape my childmy children, for I shall have manyto bear up under this curse.To survive it.And to prevail.Ada swept her gaze around the room, staring with her deep black eyes into the face of each of the other women in turn, then looked into the window and locked eyes with Dinah.I pronounce it, she said, then slowly rotated her hand until her thumb was pointed up.DINAH PEELED THE DEMOLITION CHARGE AWAY FROM THE WINDOW.She had no idea what Ada had just said.Nor did she especially care.It would be the usual histrionic Ada stuff.Several minutes remained on the countdown timer.She could have simply turned it off.But she felt like going for a walk.Whatever had just happened in the Banana looked unpleasant.She was tired of being cooped up with these peopleeven the ones she loved.She felt no great compulsion to rejoin them.She unclipped the carabiner and let go of the lazily spinning torus.Her momentum carried her toward the wall of the crevasse.Long accustomed to movement in zero gee, she timed a slow somersault and planted her feet on the wall to kill her speed, then turned on the magnets in her boots and began hiking up the crevasse wall.The weak gravity made directions arbitrary.Walking vertically up a cliff was little different from walking horizontally along the canyon floor.A tone sounded from the speakers in her helmet, alerting her that a voice connection had been made.It was Ivy.Going for a stroll?Yeah.Look, we just realized something.Oh?We all votedexcept for you.Mmm, good point.Dinah glanced down at the countdown timer.The screen was getting more difficult to read, since she was nearing the terminatorthe knife sharp line between sunlight and shadowand the bright canyon wall above her was reflecting from the screen.Tilting it for a better view, she saw that it was just about to drop through the sixty second mark.Its okay, I still have a minute to make my decision.Well, do you want to know what the rest of us agreed on?I trust you.But sure.Were all going to try to have babies just like you, Dinah.Very funny.Dinah crossed over the terminator, and the sun rose.She raised her free hand and flipped down the sun visor on her helmet.Moiras working on it now.Is that why Ada was being such a drama queen about it?Exactly.Thirty five seconds.What did you really decide?One free gene change for each mommy.Oh yeah?So what are you going to do?Make really smart little straight arrow bitches?Howd you guess?Just an intuition.What about you, Dinah?Dinah could hear the beginnings of anxiety in her friends voice.She looked down into the crevasse, saw humanitys cradle welded helplessly into place, imagined for a moment throwing the demolition charge down on it, like a vindictive goddess hurling a lightning bolt.She was thinking of Markus.Of the kids she should have had with him.What would they have been like?Markus had been kind of a jerk in some ways, but he knew how to control it.Reallyshe now understoodwhat had prompted her to slam the table and get up and storm out of the Banana a few minutes ago had not been Ada at all.Ada was provocative, yes.But more infuriating had been a slow burn that had started with Camila, and her remarks about aggression.Remarks that Dinah now saw as aimed not so much at Dinah as at Markus.She wished she could grab Camila by the scruff of the neck and sit her down in front of a display and make her watch the way Markus had spent the last minutes of his life.Markus was a hero.It seemed to Dinah that Camila wanted to strip humanity of its heroes.Shed couched what shed said in terms of aggression.But by doing so, Camila was just being aggressive in a different waya passive aggressive way that Dinah, raised as shed been raised, couldnt help seeing as sneaky.More destructive, in the end, than the overt kind of aggression.It was this that had made her so flustered that shed had to leave the meeting.Dinah?Ivy said.Im going to breed a race of heroes, Dinah said.Fuck Camila.Its going to be ...interesting ...sharing confined spaces with a race of heroes for hundreds of years.Markus knew how to do it, Dinah said.He was a jerk, but he had a code.Its called chivalry.She gave the demolition charge a toss straight up.Did you just vote yes?Oh yeah, she said, watching it dwindle against the stars.The red lights of the LED timer glittered like rubies.Were unanimous, Ivy said.Dinah understood that Ivy was announcing it to the other women in the Banana.For the first and last time, Dinah thought.The red light had shrunk to a pinprick.Like the planet Mars, she thought, except sharper and more brilliant.Then, silently, it turned into a ball of yellow light that darkened as it spread.Part Three  THE HABITAT RING CIRCA A+5000     FIVE THOUSAND YEARS LATER KATH TWO WAS STARTLED AWAKE BY PATCHES OF ORANGE PINK light cavorting across the taut fabric above her.A very old instinct, born on the savannahs of Old Earth, read it as danger: the flitting shadows, perhaps, of predators circling her tent.During the five thousand years of the Hard Rain, that instinct had lain dormant and useless.Here on the surface of New Earth, just beginning to support animals big and smart enough to be dangerous, it was once again troubling her sleep.Her shoulder twitched, in the way that it did sometimes when you were half awake, and not sure whether you were really moving or dreaming of it.She had thought of reaching under her pillow for the weapon.But coming fully to, she found that her arm had not really moved, other than the twitch.Through the thin padding beneath her head she could still feel the hard shape of the katapult.By then it had become obvious that the moving light on the tent had nothing to do with large predators.It was too dappled and volatile.Not even birds could move so.Its twinkling and swirling were mysterious, but its hue told her it was the first light of the day.This meant that she had slept a little too long and was in danger of missing the dawn breezes that she had hoped would bear her into the sky.She stumbled out of her little tent, feeling yesterdays hike in the muscles of her legs.That was surprising.She thought she had trained well.But even in the largest space habitat, you couldnt go downhill for all that long.On an actual planet, you could go on losing altitude for days.And, as it turned out, those long downhill runs were what really killed your legs.Yesterday she had shed almost two thousand meters, descending from a range of hills toward a blue, water filled crater thirty kilometers across.She had stopped a few clicks short of its rim, where the ground dropped away toward a swath of grassland between her and the shore.The break in the slope had been subtle, but Kath Twos throbbing knees had made it obvious enough.She had taken a dozen or so strides down it, gauging its angle in her blistered soles, sensing the airs currents with her lips, her hair, and the palms of her hands.Then she had turned around and trudged back up to an inflection point that would have been invisible had the low evening sun not been grazing it, casting a sharp terminator on the ground.Where wind streamed over bent ground, it stretched.The stretching had been faint in the dying wind of yestereve, but she had known that it would become more pronounced in the morning, as the sun rose and the air fled from its warmth.So she had dropped her pack and made her camp.The source of the dappled light, as she now saw, was sunlight sparkling from waves on the lake below, shooting rays through the branches of trees, perhaps a hundred meters down the slope from her, that were beginning to stir in the morning breeze, making soft noises, as when a sleeping lover exhales.She bent down, pulled the katapult out from under the sack of laundry shed been using as a pillow, felt it thrum as it recognized her fingerprint.After a short walk and a careful look aroundfor she did not actually wish to use the katapultshe squatted and urinated in the largest open space that was handy.Only in the last few decades had the ecosystem here matured to the point where TerReFormher employercould seed it with predators.And that was always somewhat hit or miss.On the mature ecosystems of Old Earth, predators and prey had, according to the histories, evolved to some kind of equilibrium.On the remade ones of New Earth, you never knew.You couldnt assume that all the predators around here were getting enough to eat; and even if they were, they might view Kath Two as a bit of tempting variety to add to their diet.Kath Two was Survey.Whether or not this made her military was a topic of almost theological complexity.But regardless of whether you considered Survey to be a purely scientific corps with ad hoc liaisons to the militarymerely for logistical convenience and situational awarenessor viewed it as an elite scout unit working hand in glove with Snake Eaters, its stated mission was to observe and report on the growth of New Earths ecosystem.Not to kill the animals that the human races had gone to so much trouble to invent and import.During her two week stint on the surface, she had grown used to the katapult and stopped seeing it as remarkable that she was carrying a weapon.But the awareness that she was going home today made her see all of this through the eyes of the sophisticated urbanites she might be mingling with tomorrow: habitat ring dwellers who would never believe that only a short time earlier Kath Two had been in a place where one did not pee without carefully looking around first, did not venture into the open without a weapon in hand.During the minutes since she had awakened, the sparkling light had warmed to brassy gold.Everything in the scene was a combination of exceptionally complex and unpredictable phenomena: the wavelets on the lake, the shapes into which the branches of the trees had grown during the century or so since this ground had been seeded by pods hurtling down out of space, tumbling like dice on jumbled ejecta from the myriad bolide strikes of the Hard Rain, finding purchase in crevices prepped by rock munching microbes.The branches and the leaves responded to the currents of the wind, which were themselves random and turbulent in a way that surpassed human calculation.She thought about the fact that the brains of humansor of any large animals, reallyhad evolved to live in environments like this, and to be nourished by such complex stimuli.For five thousand years the people of the human races had been living without that kind of nourishment.They had tried to simulate it with computers.They had built habitats large enough to support lakes and forests.But nature simulated was not nature.She wondered if humans brains had changed during that time, and if they were now ready for what they had set in motion on New Earth.And then, because she was a Moiran, she wondered if all that had to do with the fact that she had overslept.Her previous Survey missions had been quick insertions lasting a few days.And they had typically sent her to less developed biomes: the fringes of the TerReForm process, where the seeding of the ground had occurred more recently, and less complexity struck the eye, nose, and ear.This mission, however, had lasted long enough that she could feel it changing her.Eve Moira had been a child of London, fascinated by the natural world, but drawn to the city.So, Kath Two looked to the bright lights of the big city.Here that meant gazing up into the sky.Yesterday had been overcast, with little movement in the air.She might have been hard pressed to find and organize the energy she would need to get home.But matters had changed during the night.The air was moving.Not strongly enough, yet, that she could feel it on her face, but enough to stir the leaves at the tops of the trees and to wobble the heavy heads of the tall grass.Above, it must be moving more strongly, for yesterdays sheet of clouds had been shredded to tufts and tissues, purplish gray on the bottom and pink orange on their eastern faces.The sky between them, however, was perfectly clear, and still dark enough that she could see a few bright stars and planets.And, to the southfor she was in the northern hemispherean orderly ring of brilliant points erupting from the eastern horizon and arching across the vault of the sky until it plunged into the shadow of the world, off to the west.From here she could see nearly half of the ten thousand or so habitats in the ring.Far to the east, just above the horizon, was an especially big dot of light, like the clasp on a necklace.That would be the colossal structure of the Eye, currently stationed above the Atlantic.It was time to go there.She had pitched her little shelter on a flat lozenge of soft grass some distance back from the brow of the hill where the wind would soon be bending.She struck her camp, shouldered her pack one last time, and carried it a short distance to the break in the slope she had noticed yesterday.She popped the clasp on the hip belt and let it drop to the ground.Unrolling the deflated wings and the tail structure was as easy as giving each a swift kick.Smaller bundles had been stuffed between them: a foot operated pump and a hard sphere, somewhat larger than Kath Twos head.She devoted a few minutes to stomping the pump.The wrinkles began to disappear from the splayed runs of fabric, and it began to look like a glider.The sun had cleared the opposite rim of the crater.The tops of the wings began gathering its energy and feeding it to built in air pumps that would pressurize the wing and tail tubes beyond what could be achieved with muscle power.She got dressed.Which began with getting naked, and cold.She was glad she had worked up a sweat operating the pump.The hard sphere was a glass bubble with an opening at the bottom large enough to admit Kath Twos head.At the moment, though, it was stuffed with a roll of gray fabric.She withdrew this and kicked it out on the ground.It was as long as she was tall.Rolled up in it had been a semirigid funnel with straps dangling from its edge.Stuffed into the funnel were two packets.One of the packets was tiny, just a pill that would stop up her bowels for a day.She swallowed it.The other was a heavy and distressingly cold sac of gel.Kath Two bit off one corner and then smeared the gel all over herself, wincing at its chilly touch.It was an emollient, rumored to be very complicated, and it had an official name.But everyone called it Space Grease.The stuff would never be sold as a cosmetic; it lay heavy on her skin, and she could practically feel her pores clogging.The funnel and strap contraption was for collecting urine.She stepped into it, pulled it up over her pubic mound, and cinched the straps high over her pelvic crest.A short tube dangled from it, tickling her inner thigh.She then picked up the gray fabric thing.This was a one piece bodysuit whose only opening was at the neck.It was a mesh of nearly microscopic natssimple three legged robots that knew how to do very little other than hold hands with their neighbors.It would have been impossible to put on were it not for the fact that the nats, talking to each other in a simple language, could stretch and shrink those connections according to a shared program.She got both of her hands into the neck hole and pulled opposite ways.Recognizing the gesture, the nats relaxed, and the opening widened to the point where she could insert one foot, then the other.This required good balance, which Kath Two was fortunate enough to have.She was standing on a towel that she had spread out on the ground.The classic error was to lose ones balance and plant a foot in the dirt, or even fall down, and get covered with dirt and rocks and twigs that would stick to the Space Grease.But Kath Two got her feet into the suit without incident.Finding the leg holes, and then the individual toe holes, was, as usual, slapstick comedy.Once she got the suit pulled up over her buttocks she was able to sit down and manage this one digit at a time.Then she reached down inside the still baggy thighs and connected the urine tube to a fitting on the inside of her right thigh.Recognizing as much, the fabric drew tight, nearly trapping her hands inside.The tightness moved up in a wave from toes to knees to thighs to buttocks, pausing once it had noticed her waist.She shrugged the suits upper half on over her shoulders and got her fingers sorted into the gloves that terminated its arms.The suit, sensing what she was up to, grew tighter as she went, save at the neck.From the helmets orifice she detached a rigid collar with a hinge on one side and a latch on the other.She snapped it into place around her neck, then pulled the loose fabric of the suit up over it and held it in place as it shrank, forming a tight connection to the collar.From the hard collar down to her toes, she was now clad in gray material that fit her so closely she could see tendons in the backs of her hands, nipples reacting to the early morning chill, and the little valleys where her nails erupted from their beds.She hesitated to lower the helmet over her face.This would be her last opportunity for a while to breathe the fresh air of New Earth.The scientist in her was at odds with a deeper layer, common to all human races, that wanted to see beauty and purpose in the natural world.She knew perfectly well what Docor just about any other Ivynwould say to her, if he could read her mind.The water in that lake below you is there because we crashed comet cores into the dead Earth until it stayed wet.The air youre breathing was manufactured by organisms we genetically engineered and sprayed all over the wet planet, then killed once they had accomplished their task.And the sharp scent you like so much comes from vegetation that, for many years, existed only as a string of binary digits stored on a thumb drive on a string around the neck of your Eve.None of which changed the fact that she liked it.But the breeze was building, making the craft jostle and fidget.It was trimmed for minimum lift and unlikely to go anywhere, but a sudden gust might still carry it away.Unnerved by a sudden movement, Kath Two reached out and slapped the upper surface of the right wing, about an arms length in from the tip.Kath Two felt her own touch.A patch of skin on the back of her right forearm, a fingers length in from the wrist, thrilled as the suits fabric contracted over it: a configuration of puckers no larger than a fingerprint.But shaped, unmistakably, like a miniature handMoiras hand.Her skin and that of the glider had become joined in a common sensorium, mediated by the smart fabric of the suit.It never got old.She slid her hand out toward the tip of the wing and watched with a little grin as the hand shaped disturbance in her suit moved out toward her wrist.She lifted her hand from the wing and the pucker vanished.She dropped the helmet over her head and got it seated in the collar.Other than a padded brow band to support the weight of her head, and a sparse geodesic array of miniature speakers, the helmet was just a transparent bubble, mercifully free of heads up displays and other clutter.In the fuselage that joined the wings was a nest barely large enough to accommodate her.She straddled the nose, lifted one knee, and nestled it into a padded and insulated gutter that would support it and her shin.Then she followed suit with the other leg.She was kneeling in the cockpit now.Resting loose on the belly pad in front of her was a parachute folded up into a slim backpack.She picked this up, slung it over her back, and tightened the straps around her waist and thighs.She leaned forward and took her weight on her arms, then did a reverse push up, settling onto her belly.Then she made connections: the pee tube to a system that would drain it.Drinking water at her collar.She didnt yet need the tubes for incoming and outgoing atmosphere, but she connected them anyway, as well as a power cable.Then she reached back behind her, all the way down to her ankles, and found the handle for the zipper.She had no idea why it was called that.It was a linear closure, consisting of more dumb, specialized nats, that sealed her body inside the fuselage, snug under many layers of crinkly insulation.As she pulled it up she felt the gliders flexible top clamp around her buttocks and cleave together up the length of her spine until it had closed around the collar of her suit.Only her head bubble was now exposed.It had become the gliders nose cone.She extended her arms then to the sides like a bird spreading its wings, sliding them into insulated tunnels where they rested comfortably on inflated supports.For a moment she thought that some little stones had somehow made their way onboard and gotten trapped under her arms.Then one of them shifted a little, and she realized that this was the suit again, sensing the pressure of a rock on the underside of the wing and mirroring it.The insulation also helped to deaden sound, and so she could now hear almost nothing from outside.Which didnt mean she couldnt hear anything.She could hear the wind.A phrase that didnt really do justice to the soundscape now being rendered by the array of miniature speakers.The canid smelled the forest was a completely different sentence from The man smelled the forest, not because the words had different meanings, but because the canids olfactory apparatus was infinitely superior to that of the man.In a loosely analogous way, the real time, three dimensional sonic portrait of the wind generated by the gliders onboard systems and rendered by the helmets speakers was as far beyond what she could sense with unaided ears as the canids scenting of the forest was beyond the mans.For the vehicle had lidars pointed in all directions, looking out into the air to a range of several hundred meters and seeing its myriad currents, shears, and vortices.To convey all of that information in sound was impossible, but what came through was more than enough to tell Kath Two where she wanted to go: namely, where the energy was.And right now the symphony of tones, whooshes, crackles, and rustlings told her that her intuition yestereve had been more or less correct.The wind climbed the slope from the lake in a fairly continuous sheet, but as it molded itself over the brow of the hill, the wind higher up, on the outside track, had to go faster in order to keep up with the ground layer.There was a gradient in speed between the wind aloft and that at the ground.She could use it.Her eyes were busy too, tracking a pair of birds flying parallel to the slope, dipping in and out of the shear in the wind, sipping power.Far above them, the clouds were telling her a story about the conditions shed be facing in a few minutes time, but this was no concern of hers now.The wind gusted.The feeling of pressure beneath her arms increased and at the same time she felt the entire craft rising.She moved her feet and her hands in a way that the suit recognized and transmitted to the gliders control surfaces.Just that quickly, it was configured for lift.Biting suddenly into the wind coming up the hill, the craft sprang into the air; she could feel the knots of pressure vanish as the ground lost contact with the wings.Then the only sensations on the skin of her arms were caused by the wings reading the currents of air flowing over them.She let herself rise high enough to buy some margin of error, then dropped the nose and glided down the hill, trading altitude for velocity.The game shed be playing for the rest of the day was to build up a fund of energy by stealing it from the atmosphere.At the end she would trade it all for altitude, and spiral up to a place where the atmosphere failed.Closer to the shore of the lake, the meadow gave way to trees.This was one of the more mature forests on New Earth.It had been seeded only a few years after the First Treaty, about a hundred years ago.She pulled the nose up, skimmed over the highest branches, then dropped again until she was gliding over the blue water of the lake: the melted core of a comet, still coming alive with seeded algae and fish.With a voice command she caused the glider to drop a tube, no thicker than her finger, into the water skimming by a few meters below.On her first pass across the lakes diameter she collected twenty kilograms of water, which slowed the glider down somewhat.She found a thermal on the other side and rode it up a few hundred meters before rolling over and diving down for another, faster pass over the lake, and another long drink of water.This part of the journey was the most ticklish, so it was good that it came first, when she was still fresh.A glider that was light enough to carry around on her back was, by the same token, too light to store very much kinetic energy.Its lack of momentum placed limits on the maneuvers Kath Two could perform in the higher atmosphere; small twitches in the flow of air would bat it around like a feather.It needed to get a lot heavier.The way to do that was to scoop water out of a lake, as she was doing now.But it all happened at low altitude and low speed, where the margin for error was slender.The first few passes, when the glider weighed practically nothing, were the most delicate.So she took her time at each side of the lake to find good thermals and harvest their force.After an hour of that, however, she was dive bombing her way across the crater with terrific authority, carrying hundreds of kilograms of ballast in the belly and the wings.By then she had learned where to hunt for thermals that, as the morning wore on, bloomed with increasing vigor from the open meadows in the shoulders of the great crater.It was on her last pass, just as she was getting ready to pull up and skim over the tops of the trees that grew from the onrushing shore, that she saw the human.The human was not exposed on the shore, but standing back among the first line of trees, apparently watching her.He or shethe distance was too great to read genderwas dressed in clothing that blended in with the surroundings.Not the bright coveralls of Survey.But neither did it look military.Perhaps sensing that he or she had been spotted, the human immediately stepped back into the young forest.At the same moment, Kath Two was obliged to pull her nose up, lest she collide with the trees.So great had been her surprise that she almost did it too late, and felt a few thin branches whipping against the belly of the fuselage as she put the lake behind her for good.Directly ahead was a broad meadow, angled toward the sun, that she knew to be an excellent source of power.As she drew close enough for the lidars to read the air, and for her eyes to pick out the movements of the birds, she banked into the thermal.Her first approach was a crude guess based on what she was hearing, but as soon as she got into it and felt the fine grained currents of the air in her arms and her fingertips, she was able to use it as birds did.Half an hours climbing left the lake a blue disk far below and put her in sight of open country to the southeast, dotted with mushroom cap clouds that were a dead giveaway.Trading altitude for distance, she glided in a nearly straight line until she could pick up those thermals and recharge her store of energy.She had her eye on a range of mountains several hundred kilometers distant, rising up above the eastern shore of the Pacific Ocean.Above them, clouds were arranged in long folds, running parallel to the crest of the range.The photocells in the wings had stored up enough power now that she was able to send a burst of data up into space.Packets coming back a few seconds later told her when and where she could expect hangers along her projected route.It was too early to lock in on a specific plan, but useful to get a general picture.And it was good practice to let people know where she was and when to expect her.It looked like about twenty other surveyors were operating in the same general zone.She considered the number astonishingly high, and double checked it.While she was waiting for confirmation to come back, she scanned the skies around her and spotted two of them.After some thought, she sent a voice message to Doc.I want to talk to you when I get back.Not urgent.But important.Then she put such distractions out of her mind and attended to the problem at hand, which was stringing together enough thermals to get her into the mountain wave that awaited her downrange.Once she had stored enough energy in her glidermostly in the form of altitudethe thermal riding part of it became nearly automatic and she was able to doze off for stretches of twenty minutes at a time.In truth, there was no aspect of this flight that could not have been managed by a robot.Robot gliders were at this moment operating all over New Earth.But she was leery of letting her own powers dwindle by delegating them to machines, and so she liked to fly the glider at least part of the time.The algorithms worked, but they wouldnt get better unless humans gardened them; and to do that, you had to fly.A surge of acceleration awakened her from an early afternoon nap and she looked down to see the snow covered peaks of the mountains a thousand meters below her.She had found the mountain wave, a source of sustained atmospheric power that dwarfed anything that could be obtained from thermals.It was a ridge of rising air running from north to south.If she turned north from here, she could probably ride it all the way to the polar vortex, and take that up to where the atmosphere failed.But she had farther to go than wings could take her, so she banked south and trimmed the glider to slip sideways along the wave, skimming enough power from it to gain altitude even while screaming southward at three hundred kilometers an hour.She was a fly hitching a ride on a hurricane.Knots in the tapestry of sound told her of other solid objects above and below, left and right.She was able to pick them out visually as the setting sun lit up their fuselages and wingtips against the deep purple of the sky.Higher yetunfathomably far above, and yet only in low Earth orbitwere larger structures, moving more slowly, like the minute hands of great clocks.Linear constellations with fatter, brighter lights on their ends.One of them was sweeping across the sky directly south of her, and she knew she was already too late to catch it.But looking off to the west she saw another approaching, like a giant leg striding across the sky, its foot swinging downward, not yet planted.She didnt even need to check the params to know that this was the hanger for her.But she ran the calculation anyway, partly to confirm her guess and partly as a courtesy to other aircraft in this crowded space that might be aiming for the same one.Darkness fell before she reached it.The hangerit was a pun on hangar, a term from Old Earth aviationwas a big hollow pod hanging on the end of a tether that, just now, extended far up into space.At its opposite end, thousands of kilometers above, was another hanger just like it, serving as a counterweight.The two hangers formed a bolo, rotating around each other to keep the tether stretched tight between them.The bolo orbited the Earth just like any other satellite, the difference being that the height of that orbit, and the length of the tether, had been tuned so that on every rotationor, as it appeared from Kath Twos point of view, each long stride across the heavensthe hanger on the low end would swing down into the uppermost reaches of the atmosphere and seem to hover, almost still, for a minute.Somewhat analogous to the way that a runners foot will remain planted on the ground, unmoving, for an instant during each stride, even though the runner is traveling swiftly.In any case it came low enough and went slowly enough that a glider, pumped to great velocity and brought high into the atmosphere by the power of the mountain wave, could catch it and match it.Kath Twos eyes and ears told her of other vehicles converging on the same target.A few minutes prior to rendezvous, it became obligatory to hand control of the craft over to a version of the ancient program Parambulator, which managed the final approach.Kath Two could have stuck the landing without assistance, had she been alone.But coordinating her approach with the other vehicles was the sort of task best left up to a five thousand year old algorithm.At the time she ceded control, the hanger still seemed impossibly far away, but over the next few minutes it loomed out of the sky like a slow motion meteorite, studded with red running lights.It was shaped like a rugby ball, streamlined fore and aft, with stubby winglets that were finding traction in the thin air, adjusting their angles of attack to stabilize its flight.Kath Two and the other aircraft were converging on it from behind, overtaking it rapidly as it slowed almost to a stop.Most of the hangers aft end was a broad aperture that now irised open to reveal a spacious deck, brightly illuminated, like a magic doorway hanging in the sky.In front of her she could see the lights of other vehicles sidling into the queue ahead of her.The hangers bright orifice grew huge, like a chilly sun falling out of the sky.One by one the vehicles slipped into its lee and bounced and skidded to a stop on its deck.From a distance this appeared level.In fact it was angled slightly upward, so that the aircraft climbed a gentle ramp as they rolled into it.This helped them kill their excess velocity.Her glider bounced twice before the ramp took its weight.Then gravityreal and simulatedcame down like a fat hand on her back, and she felt a rush of blood to the head as the glider slowed sharply.Visually, she was at rest now.In truth, she was contained in a revolving object: one extremity of a bolo four thousand kilometers long.Even though its revolution, seen from a distance, had looked ponderous, the bolo as a whole was wheeling fast enough to produce two gees of simulated gravity.That plus the one gee of real gravity she was feeling from New Earth added up to a massive amount of down force pressing her into the water filled ballast sacs that made up the gliders belly.A human sized grabb, untroubled by the weight, dragged her glider off to the side, making way for other aircraft coming in for a landing behind.All told, the hanger collected eight aircraft during this pass.Besides Kath Twos, two others were piloted by humans.Each was of a different design; both were powered.The other five were robot gliders, looking similar to Kath Twos, but solid rather than inflatable.As soon as the last of these was stowed, the hangers tailgate constricted and closed behind them.Its stride complete, the hanger was already swinging back, gaining altitude heel first, rising back up toward space.It was much too large a volume to be pressurized.What little air it had scooped up during its dip into the atmosphere rapidly leaked out.So Kath Two was effectively in outer space now.Knowing this, the fabric of the suit had contracted against her skin to supply the back pressure that was no longer provided by the atmosphere.It was porous, and so the only thing really between her skin and the void was Space Grease.The combined effects of that and the nat mesh fooled her skin and muscles into believing that they were under a nice thick blanket of airthe way humans were meant to live.The only part of the outfit that was pressurized like an old fashioned space suit was the helmet.Dangling above the middle of the hangers landing deck were four flivvers of various sizes and designsthe latest iterations of a vehicle type that had been in existence since before the onset of the Hard Rain.During the series of landings just completed, these had been kept up and out of the way.As soon as the door of the hanger closed, one of thema medium sized, four passenger modelwas lowered to the ramp by winches.It came to rest about ten meters away.Incongruously for a space vehicle, it seemed to have wheels.It was, in fact, resting on a low, wheeled sled that was designed to roll up and down the ramp.Green lights beside the flivvers airlock door told her that all was well on the other side.Kath Two had about ten minutes to reach it.That would be plenty of time if she didnt pass out.She issued a command that allowed the gliders body to deflate.She felt rather than heard the air escaping and the water draining.The soft top of the fuselage parted over her shoulders, back, butt, and thighs.Meanwhile she was wriggling her arms in from the insulated sleeves where they had been spread like a pair of wings.This was good exercise, given that they weighed three times as much as normal.By the time that was all done, the glider was just a wrinkled cross of fabric, flat on the deck.Kath Two disconnected herself from its air scrubber and its urine collection system, then unplugged the power and data from her collar.She gathered her arms under her and began to belly crawl toward the flivver, sliding one knee, then the other forward along the deck plates, like a lizard.A big siwi corkscrewed out and kept pace with her, tracking her vital signs, ready to supply extra air or other forms of assistance if needed.But Kath Two made adequate progress.She probably could have crawled on hands and knees, as one of the other human pilots was doing, but she saw no need.Something strange caught her eye, and she went to the effort of rotating her head slightly just to verify it was real: the third pilot was actually walking upright.He was trudging along with short deliberate strides, carefully judging his balance and the loads he was placing on his joints, while somehow managing to keep enough blood in his brain to remain conscious.Kath Two could never have stood up, let alone walked, under three gees.The same was true of most of her race.This man, however, was a Teklan.That was obvious from his size, as well as his coloration and the shape of his head, which were visible through his helmet.It was hinted at by his musculature and by the style of the suit he was wearingheavier, partly armored, slung about with load bearing straps made to support various burdens.His scabbards, holsters, and bandoliers were vacant.Even without any of those clues, however, she could have guessed his race from the fact that he had chosen to perform the feat of walking when he could have more safely and more easily crawled.Had it not been for the racial bond that joined Moirans and Teklans, Kath Two might have rolled her eyes and muttered a joke about it.Teklans didnt need blood in their brains to keep dutifully trudging forward.Something along those lines.But that kind of stereotyping could just as well have been turned back on her.The Teklan had piloted his vehicle into the hanger under power.The thing had engines.Why not use engines if you belonged to a civilization that knew how to make them?Kath Two, on the other hand, had reached the same destination in an unpowered glider, using skill and wit to draw energy from the atmosphere.She could have turned pilots duties over to an algorithm anytime she wanted.Instead, she had chosen to do most of it herself.In its own way, this was no less an act of pointless bravado than what the Teklan pilot was doing right now.She had been testing and sharpening a set of skills that was important to her.Mutatis mutandis, this Teklan was doing the same.Kath Two got to the airlock with time to spare.Its floor was padded as a courtesy to people who, like her, were experiencing it through all the bodys boniest parts.She rolled heavily onto her back, slightly bumping the pilot who had reached it on hands and knees, and connected her air tube to a socket on the airlock wall.New air flooded her helmet.The Teklan entered and allowed himself to collapse onto a bench.The outer hatch closed and locked.The air pressure rose and the nat mesh reduced its fierce clutch on her body.It became no tighter than an athletic jersey as the pressure approached one standard habitat atmospherea thinnish concoction of gases similar to what humans of Old Earth had breathed in places like Aspen, Colorado.The inner hatch opened.Crawling now on hands and knees, Kath Two followed the others into the main cabin, where four acceleration couches were waiting.They climbed into three of them, strapped in, and made themselves comfortable.They were now lying on their backs, legs elevated.At some point their suits systems had found their way onto the flivvers voice networkshe knew as much from the fact that she could hear the other two breathing as heavily as she was.But no one said anything.Talking would become a lot easier in a few minutes.True to form, the Teklan, with a controlled exhalation, heaved his meaty arms up off the rests, grabbed his helmet, and pulled it off.He let its weight rest on his stomach and allowed his arms to thud back onto the couch.Kath Two got a vague peripheral glimpse of platinum hair and cheekbones, as expected, but didnt feel like turning her head.Instead she looked at a display screen mounted above her face, focusing as well as she could with her eyeballs flattened into their sockets by gees.They had entered the hanger in level flight, traveling at a hundred kilometers per hour.In the minutes since then, the centripetal force that had obliged her to crawl on the floor like a lizard had been accelerating them upward and forward, steadily pumping kinetic energy into them and everything around them, whirling them up to the immense velocities more typical of space travel.Compared to the baroque, fire breathing systems that their ancestors had used to the same purpose, there was nothing to it.The bolo was mechanically identical to the sling used by David to slay Goliath.The flivver was the stone nestled in its pocket.The bolo had made about a quarter of a revolution, so they were now traveling directly away from the surface of the Earthaimed toward the distant ring of habitats that they and the three billion other members of the human races called home.Seen on a video window in the display above, the hangers tailgate dilated, showing a disk of black sky.A tattoo of metallic clunks let them know that the brakes on the sled had been released.Driven down the ramp by centripetal force, it built speed all the way to the lip of the hanger deck and then stopped short with a sneeze from its shock absorbers.The flivver jerked free of the sled.From its occupants point of view, it seemed to fall off the edge of the deck and into space.En route it picked up a bit of a tumble, which was killed by quick firings of its thrusters.They became weightless.Kath Two took her helmet off but kept her head nestled in the couchs rest for a minute while her inner ear adjusted.Meanwhile she was groping in a compartment in her armrest for a varp, which was what people normally used in place of flat panel display screens when they wanted to interact with some kind of app.It was an old enough word that most people had forgotten it was an acronym for something like Vision Augmentation Retro Projector.Styles varied, but the baseline model looked like a heavy framed pair of glasses.Mounted in that frame were cameras that could see the way her hands were moving, a microphone that could hear her speech, and other cameras that could track her gaze.A number of glowing figments appeared in her peripheral vision as she slipped them on, and she was able to reach out and activate one of them to launch Parambulator.This gave her a schema of the flivvers situation in the universe: in the center, a blue disk representing New Earth, under a gray film of atmosphere.Well outside of that, the orbital track of the bolos center, the twin trajectories of its two hangers snaking around it.This was what they had just left behind.A blinking green dot showed their current location on their new orbit, a fat ellipse whose apogee coincided with the circle of habitats that hung above the planet at geosynchronous altitude.Over the next twelve hours they would coast up to that height, then strap back into the couches and use other means to effect a delta vee that would sync them up with whichever habitat they decided upon.The world in which essentially all three billion humans lived, as depicted from above (high over the North Pole, looking down on the whole system) was a hair thin ring some eighty four thousand kilometers acrossroughly seven times the diameter of the blue and white planet in its center.The objects that made up the ring, though they seemed big to the humans who lived in them, were evanescent particles compared to the rings overall scale.Imagine the thinnest possible jewelry chain, a nearly invisible trace of platinum around a womans neck.Make a perfect circle of that same chain ten meters in diameter, and that gives a picture of the rings thinness in comparison to its overall size.It was more easily viewed in artificial renderings like the one on Kath Twos varp, where the points that made up the ringthe individual habitatswere drawn as unrealistically large, color coded pips.Seen that way, the circle was chopped into eight arcs of roughly equal size, each subtending about forty five degrees.At long zoom, these were glinting and luminously iridescent, with much shorter gray arcsthe boneyards, they were calledsticking them together.At a closer zoom, the pointillistic nature of the image became obvious, and the system began helpfully to superimpose labels and numbered meridians.There were more than nine thousand active habitats distributed among those eight segments.The boneyards contained another several hundredmostly obsolete ones being cut up for scrapas well as unused fragments of the moon and the odd captured asteroid, there to serve as raw material for new construction.Any object that was not inhabitedbecause it wasnt finished yet, because it was abandoned, or because it was just a rockwas rendered as a gray dot.This accounted for the dull appearance of the eight boneyards.Sparkling with pure colors were the eight much longer arcs between them.Seen from a distance, each arc had a predominant color.Encoded in those colors was the history of their building, and in turn that of the human races during the last thousand yearsthe Fifth Millennium, the Millennium of the Ring.Prior to thatduring the first four thousand years of the Hard Rainspace had been so dirty that the human races had been obliged to hunker down in the shelter of massive nickel iron bodies such as Cleft, whose orbits were, of course, similar to that of the moon whose core had once comprised themnine times farther away from Earth than the habitat ring was now.As Dubois Harris had foreseen, the orbit of the former moon had been a fine placethe only place, reallyto restart a civilization, as long as hellfire was raining down on Earth.But to the extent that the human race, as a whole, was capable of having a plan, it was to return to Earth eventually.The Hard Rain diminished, gradually at first, and then, during the Fourth Millennium, more steeply as fleets of robots, issuing from their nickel iron fastnesses like bats from caverns, began to sweep the skies clean, policing the rubble cloud, herding specks and pebbles together, and spiraling them down into disciplined orbits at geosynchronous altitude.Most of the work was accomplished using the pressure of sunlight, a weak form of propulsion that took hundreds of years to have its effect.At the dawn of the Fifth Millennium, about a thousand years ago, the first new habitat in geosynchronous orbit had been constructed.It was called Greenwich because it was positioned above Old Earths prime meridian.In the way of neighbors, it at first had nothing but rubble and worn out robots.As soon as Greenwich was complete, however, construction of more habitats had spread outward from it.The human races and their robots had begun burning their way through the ring of raw material in both directions, consuming it like fire on a fuse.Greenwich had been a joint project of all seven human races.The same was true of its first neighbors: Volta, then Banu Qasim to the east, Atlas and Roland to the west, later more in both directions.All of these were, therefore, colored white in the display that Kath Two was seeing in her varp.Greenwich was one of eight equidistant points plotted around the ring.The other seven, proceeding west, acquired the names Rio, Memphis, Pitcairn, Tokomaru, Kyoto, Dhaka, and Baghdad.In due course, each of them was seeded with a new habitat as well as the production capabilities needed to manufacture more yet.As the centuries went by, their inhabitants likewise burned their way through the raw materials lying to their western and eastern sides, building new habitats at a pace to match the growth of their populations.It was self evident that if that process went on long enough, the arc of habitats reaching west from, say, Greenwich would make contact with that growing east from Rio.The increasingly narrow bands of unused material and recyclable junk between segments became the boneyards, and might have disappeared altogether had they not been so usefulin the early going, as materials depots, later as political buffers and as liminal zones, akin to frontiers, to which people could escape when they had learned that the close packed life of space habitats was not for them.The one halfway between Greenwich and Rio was called Cape Verde.Other boneyards, proceeding westward from Cape Verde, were Titicaca, Grand Canyon, Hawaii, Kamchatka, Guangzhou, and Indus.Completing the circle, the one between Baghdad and Greenwich was called Balkans.Some were bigger than others.Guangzhou, which formerly had separated the Adan and Camite segments, had been used up entirely as the populations to either side had grown.When pronouncing her Curse, Eve Ada had said much that was true.It had become clear within the first few generations after the Council of the Seven Eves that the seven races were going to be around forever.They were as permanent in the human picture as toenails and spleens.Though no official policy had ever been proclaimed to that effect, they had tended to vote with their feet.Rio had become predominantly Ivyn.Moirans had flocked to Memphis, and Teklans to the next one around the arc in that direction, which was Pitcairn.Baghdad, flanking Greenwich on the other side, had been settled by Dinans.Proceeding east from Baghdad, Dhaka had filled up with Camites.Adans and Julians had found a way of expressing their perpetual sense of alienation from the other races by opting for the Antipodean habitats of Kyoto and Tokomaru respectively; closing the ring, this brought the Julians, on their eastern end, up against the Teklans western extremity, separated only by the Hawaii boneyard, which was relatively large, if only because the Julian race was not numerous enough to make much headway in using its resources.The levels of racial purity varied.Greenwich had been founded by all of them together, and so it would forever be the most diverse part of the ring.Baghdad and Rio, flanking it, also tended to have a lot of residents who were not, respectively, Dinans or Ivyns.That three segment arc was, therefore, fairly cosmopolitan.The other races, in general, tended to be more inward looking, so their segments were not as thoroughly mixed.Anomalous outposts speckled the ring: a habitat containing fifty thousand Julians located spang in the middle of the Dinan segment, for example.Eve Moira had employed a color coding scheme to keep track of the lab samples from which all the races had spawned.It was purely the result of what shed had lying around in the way of office supplies: an assortment of colored test tube stickers and felt tipped pens.Nevertheless, it had become a universal convention.Blue: Dinah Yellow: Camila Red: Ada Orange: Julia Cyan: Tekla Purple: Moira herself Green: Ivy White: no particular race The same code was used to render the dots that made up the ring.So, a predominantly Dinan habitat would be colored blue, and so on.Because they were so tiny and so numerous, the dots all merged into an iridescent, sparkling arc on the screen.
