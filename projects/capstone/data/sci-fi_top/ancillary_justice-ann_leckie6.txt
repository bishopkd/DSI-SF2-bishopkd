Without speaking aloud she requested information from mea random sample of memories from that five year span that had so attracted her attention, above on the central access deck.Silent, expressionlessunreal, in a sense, since I could only see her exteriorsshe watched as my memories played out before her visions, in her ears.I began to doubt the truth of my memory of that other visit.There seemed to be no trace of it in the information Anaander Mianaai was accessing, nothing during that time but routine operations.But something had attracted her attention to that stretch of time.And there was that Invalid access to account fornone of Anaander Mianaais accesses were ever invalid, never could be.And why had I opened to an invalid access?And when one Anaander, in the Var decade room, frowned and said, No, nothing, and the Lord of the Radch turned her attention to more recent memories, I found myself tremendously relieved.In the meantime my captain and all my other officers went about the routine business of the daytraining, exercising, eating, talkingcompletely unaware that the Lord of the Radch was aboard.The whole thing was wrong.The Lord of the Radch watched my Esk lieutenants fencing over breakfast.Three times.With no visible change of expression.One Var set tea at the elbow of each of the two identical black clad bodies in the Var decade room.Lieutenant Awn, said one Anaander.Has she been out of your presence at all since the incident?She hadnt specified which incident she meant, but she could only have meant the business in the temple of Ikkt.She has not, my lord, I said, using One Vars mouth.On my central access deck, the Lord of the Radch keyed accesses and overrides that would allow her to change nearly anything about my mind she wished.Invalid, invalid, invalid.One after another.But each time I flashed acknowledgment, confirmed access she didnt actually have.I felt something like nausea, beginning to realize what must have happened, but having no accessible memory of it to confirm my suspicions, to make the matter clear and unambiguous to me.Has she at any time discussed this incident with anyone?This much was clearAnaander Mianaai was acting against herself.Secretly.She was divided in twoat least two.I could only see traces of the other Anaander, the one who had changed the accesses, the accesses she thought she was only now changing to favor herself.Has she at any time discussed this incident with anyone?Briefly, my lord, I said.Truly frightened for the first time in my long life.With Lieutenant Skaaiat of Justice of Ente.How could my voiceOne Varspeak so calmly?How could I even know what words to say, what answer to make, when the whole basis for all my actionseven my reason for existencewas thrown into doubt?One Mianaai frownednot the one that had been speaking.Skaaiat, she said, with slight distaste.Seeming unaware of my sudden fear.Ive had my suspicions about Awer for some time.Awer was Lieutenant Skaaiats house name, but what that had to do with events in the temple of Ikkt, I had no idea.I never could find any proof.This, also, was mysterious to me.Play me the conversation.When Lieutenant Skaaiat said, If youre going to do something that crazy, save it for when itll make a difference, one body leaned forward sharply and gave a breathy ha, an angry sound.Moments later, at the mention of Ime, eyebrows twitched.I feared momentarily that my dismay at the incautious, frankly dangerous tenor of that conversation would be detectable to the Lord of the Radch, but she made no mention of it.Had not seen it, perhaps, as she had not seen my profound disturbance at realizing she was no longer one person but two, in conflict with each other.Not proof.Not enough, Mianaai said, oblivious.But dangerous.Awer ought to tip my way.Why she thought this, I didnt immediately understand.Awer had come from the Radch itself, from the start had had wealth and influence enough to allow it to criticize, and criticize it did, though generally with shrewdness enough to keep itself out of real trouble.I had known Awer House for a long time, had carried its young lieutenants, known them as captains of other ships.Granted, no Awer suited for military service exhibited her houses tendencies to their utmost extent.An overly keen sense of injustice or a tendency to mysticism didnt mesh well with annexations.Nor with wealth and rankany Awers moral outrage inevitably smelled slightly of hypocrisy, considering the comforts and privileges such an ancient house enjoyed, and while some injustices were unignorably obvious to them, some others they never saw.In any event, Lieutenant Skaaiats sardonic practicality wasnt foreign to her house.It was only a milder, more livable version of Awers tendency to moral outrage.Doubtless each Anaander thought her cause was the more just.(The more proper, the more beneficial.Certainly. )Assuming Awers penchant for just causes, the citizens of that house ought to support the proper side.Given they knew anything like sides were involved at all.This assumed, of course, that any part at all of Anaander Mianaai thought any Awer was guided by a passion for justice and not by self interest covered over with self righteousness.And any given Awer could, at various times, be guided by either.Still.It was possible some part of Anaander Mianaai thought that Awer (or any particular Awer) needed only to be convinced of the justice of her cause to champion it.And surely she knew that if Awerany Awercould not be convinced, it would be her implacable enemy.Suleir, now Anaander Mianaai turned to One Var, standing silent at the table.Dariet Suleir seems to be an ally of Lieutenant Awn.Why?The question troubled me for reasons I couldnt quite identify.I cant be entirely certain, my lord, but I believe Lieutenant Dariet considers Lieutenant Awn to be an able officer, and of course she defers to Lieutenant Awn as decade senior.And, perhaps, was secure enough in her own standing not to resent Lieutenant Awns having authority over her.Unlike Lieutenant Issaaia.But I didnt say that.Nothing to do with political sympathies, then?I am at a loss to understand what you mean, my lord, I said, quite sincerely but with growing alarm.Another Mianaai body spoke up.Are you playing stupid with me, Ship?Begging my lords pardon, I answered, still speaking through One Var, if I knew what my lord was looking for I would be better able to supply relevant data.In answer, Mianaai said, Justice of Toren, when did I last visit you?If those accesses and overrides had been valid, I would have been utterly unable to conceal anything from the Lord of the Radch.Two hundred three years, four months, one week, and five days ago, my lord, I lied, now sure of the significance of the question.Give me your memories of the incident in the temple, Mianaai commanded, and I complied.And lied again.Because while nearly every instant of each of those individual streams of memory and data was unaltered, that moment of horror and doubt when one segment feared it might have to shoot Lieutenant Awn was, impossibly, missing.It seems very straightforward when I say I.  At the time, I meant Justice of Toren, the whole ship and all its ancillaries.A unit might be very focused on what it was doing at that particular moment, but it was no more apart from me than my hand is while its engaged in a task that doesnt require my full attention.Nearly twenty years later I would be a single body, a single brain.That division, IJustice of Toren and IOne Esk, was not, I have come to think, a sudden split, not an instant before which I was one and after which I was we.It was something that had always been possible, always potential.Guarded against.But how did it go from potential to real, incontrovertible, irrevocable?On one level the answer is simpleit happened when all of Justice of Toren but me was destroyed.But when I look closer I seem to see cracks everywhere.Did the singing contribute, the thing that made One Esk different from all other units on the ship, indeed in the fleets?Perhaps.Or is anyones identity a matter of fragments held together by convenient or useful narrative, that in ordinary circumstances never reveals itself as a fiction?Or is it really a fiction?I dont know the answer.But I do know that, though I can see hints of the potential split going back a thousand years or more, thats only hindsight.The first I noticed even the bare possibility that IJustice of Toren might not also be IOne Esk, was that moment that Justice of Toren edited One Esks memory of the slaughter in the temple of Ikkt.The moment IIwas surprised by it.It makes the history hard to convey.Because still, I was me, unitary, one thing, and yet I acted against myself, contrary to my interests and desires, sometimes secretly, deceiving myself as to what I knew and did.And its difficult for me even now to know who performed what actions, or knew which information.Because I was Justice of Toren.Even when I wasnt.Even if Im not anymore.Above, on Esk, Lieutenant Dariet asked for admittance to Lieutenant Awns quarters, found Lieutenant Awn lying on her bunk, staring sightlessly up, gloved hands behind her head.Awn, she began, stopped, made a rueful smile.Im here to pry.I cant talk about it, answered Lieutenant Awn, still staring up, dismayed and angry but not letting it reach her voice.In the Var decade room, Mianaai asked, What are Dariet Suleirs political sympathies?I believe she has none to speak of, I answered, with One Vars mouth.Lieutenant Dariet stepped into Lieutenant Awns quarters, sat on the edge of the bed, next to Lieutenant Awns unbooted feet.Not about that.Have you heard from Skaaiat?Lieutenant Awn closed her eyes.Still dismayed.Still angry.But with a slightly different feel.Why should I have?Lieutenant Dariet was silent for three seconds.I like Skaaiat, she said, finally.I know she likes you.I was there.I was there and convenient.You know, we all know well be moving some time soon, and once we do Skaaiat has no reason to care whether or not I exist anymore.And even if Lieutenant Awn stopped.Swallowed.Breathed.Even if she did, she continued, her voice just barely less steady than before, it wouldnt matter.Im not anyone she wants to be connected with, not anymore.If I ever was.Below, Anaander Mianaai said, Lieutenant Dariet seems pro reform.That puzzled me.But One Var had no opinion, of course, being only One Var, and it had no physical response to my puzzlement.I saw suddenly, clearly, that I was using One Var as a mask, though I didnt understand why or how I would do such a thing.Or why the idea would occur to me now.Begging my lords pardon, I dont see that as a political stance.Dont you?No, my lord.You ordered the reforms.Loyal citizens will support them.That Mianaai smiled.The other stood, left the decade room, to walk the Var corridors, inspecting.Not speaking to or acknowledging in any way the segments of One Var it passed.Lieutenant Awn said, to Lieutenant Dariets skeptical silence, Its easy for you.Nobody thinks youre kneeling for advantage when you go to bed with someone.Or getting above yourself.Nobody wonders what your partner could be thinking, or how you ever got here.Ive told you before, youre too sensitive about that.Am I?Lieutenant Awn opened her eyes, levered herself up on her elbows.How do you know?Have you experienced it much?I have.All the time.That, said Mianaai, in the decade room, is a more complicated issue than many realize.Lieutenant Awn is pro reform, of course.I wished I had physical data from Mianaai, so I could interpret the edge in her voice when she named Lieutenant Awn.And Dariet, perhaps, though how strongly is a question.And the rest of the officers?Who here are pro reform, and who anti ?In Lieutenant Awns quarters, Lieutenant Dariet sighed.I just think you worry too much about it.Who cares what people like that say?Its easy not to care when youre rich, and the social equal of people like that.That sort of thing shouldnt matter, Lieutenant Dariet insisted.It shouldnt.But it does.Lieutenant Dariet frowned.Angry, and frustrated.This conversation had happened before, had gone the same way each time.Well.Regardless.You should send Skaaiat a message.What is there to lose?If she doesnt answer, she doesnt answer.But maybe Lieutenant Dariet lifted one shoulder, and her arm just slightly.A gesture that said, Take a chance and see what fate deals you.If I hesitated in answering Anaander Mianaais question for even the smallest instant, she would know the overrides werent working.One Var was very, very impassive.I named a few officers who had definite opinions one way or the other.The rest, I finished, are content to follow orders and perform their duties without worrying too much about policy.As far as I can tell.They might be swayed one way or the other, Mianaai observed.I couldnt say, my lord.My sense of dread increased, but in a detached way.Perhaps the absolute unresponsiveness of my ancillaries made the feeling seem distant and unreal.Ships I knew who had exchanged their ancillary crews for human ones had said their experience of emotion had changed, though this didnt seem quite like the data they had shown me.The sound of One Esk singing came faintly to Lieutenant Awn and Lieutenant Dariet, a simple song with two parts.I was walking, I was walking  When I met my love  I was in the street walking  When I saw my true love  I said, She is more beautiful than jewels, lovelier than jade or lapis, silver or gold.Im glad One Esk is itself again, said Lieutenant Dariet.That first day was eerie.Two Esk didnt sing, Lieutenant Awn pointed out.Right, but Lieutenant Dariet gestured doubt.It wasnt right.She looked speculatively at Lieutenant Awn.I cant talk about it, said Lieutenant Awn, and lay back down, crossing her arms over her eyes.On the command deck Hundred Captain Rubran met with the decade commanders, drank tea, talked about schedules and leave times.You havent mentioned Hundred Captain Rubran, said Mianaai, in the Var decade room.I hadnt.I knew Captain Rubran extremely well, knew her every breath, every twitch of every muscle.She had been my captain for fifty six years.I have never heard her express an opinion on the matter, I said, quite truthfully.Never?Then its certain she has one and is concealing it.This struck me as something of a double bind.Speak and your possession of an opinion was plain, clear to anyone.Refrain from speaking and still this was proof of an opinion.If Captain Rubran were to say, Truly, I have no opinion on the matter, would that merely be another proof she had one?Surely shes been present when others have discussed it, Mianaai continued.What have her feelings been in such cases?Exasperation, I answered, through One Var.Impatience.Sometimes boredom.Exasperation, mused Mianaai.At what, I wonder?I did not know the answer, so I said nothing.Her family connections are such that I cant be certain where her sympathies are most likely to lie.And some of them I dont want to alienate before I can move openly.I have to tread carefully with Captain Rubran.But so will she.She meaning, of course, herself.There had been no attempt to discover my sympathies.Perhapsno, certainlythey were irrelevant.And I was already well along the path the other Mianaai had set me on.These few Mianaais, and the four segments of One Var thawed for her service, only made the Var deck seem emptier, and all the decks between here and my engines.Hundreds of thousands of ancillaries slept in my holds, and they would likely be removed within the next few years, either stored or destroyed, never waking again.And I would be placed in orbit somewhere, permanently.My engines almost certainly disabled.Or I would be destroyed outrightthough none of us had been so far, and I was fairly sure I would more likely serve as a habitat, or the core of a small station.Not the life I had been built for.No, I cant be hasty with Rubran Osck.But your Lieutenant Awn is another matter.And perhaps she can be of use in discovering where Awer stands.My lord, I said, through one of One Vars mouths.I am at a loss to understand whats happening.I would feel a great deal more comfortable if the hundred captain knew you were here.You dislike concealing things from your captain?Anaander asked, with a tone that was equal parts bitter and amused.Yes, my lord.I will, of course, proceed precisely as you order me.A sudden sense of dj vu overcame me.Of course.I should explain some things.The sense of dj vu grew stronger.I had had this conversation before, in almost exactly these circumstances, with the Lord of the Radch.You know that each of your ancillary segments is entirely capable of having its own identity, she would say next.You know that each of your ancillary segments is entirely capable of having its own identity.Yes.Every word, familiar.I could feel it, as though we were reciting lines we had memorized.Next she would say, Imagine you became undecided about something.Imagine some enemy separated part of you from yourself.Not what I had been expecting.What is it people say, when that happens?Theyre divided.Theyre of two minds.Imagine that enemy managed to forge or force its way past all the necessary accesses.And that part of you came back to youbut wasnt really part of you anymore.But you didnt realize it.Not right away.You and I, we really can be of two minds, cant we.Thats a very alarming thought, my lord.It is, agreed Anaander Mianaai, all the time sitting in the Var decade room, inspecting the corridors and rooms of the Var deck.Watching Lieutenant Awn, alone again, and miserable.Gesturing through my mind, on the central access deck.Or so she thought.I dont know precisely who has done it.I suspect the involvement of the Presger.They have been meddling in our affairs since before the Treaty.And afterfive hundred years ago, the best surgicals and correctives were made in Radch space.Now we buy from the Presger.At first only at border stations, but now theyre everywhere.Eight hundred years ago the Translators Office was a collection of minor officials who assisted in the interpretation of extra Radch intelligence, and who smoothed linguistic problems during annexations.Now they dictate policy.Chief among them the Emissary to the Presger.The last sentence was spoken with audible distaste.Before the Treaty, the Presger destroyed a few ships.Now they destroy all of Radch civilization.Expansion, annexation, is very expensive.Necessaryit has been from the beginning.From the first, to surround the Radch itself with a buffer zone, protecting it from any sort of attack or interference.Later, to protect those citizens.And to expand the reach of civilization.And Mianaai stopped, gave a short, exasperated sigh.To pay for the previous annexations.To provide wealth for Radchaai in general.My lord, what do you suspect the Presger of having done?But I knew.Even with my memory obscured and incomplete, I knew.Divided me.Corrupted part of me.And the corruption has spread, the other me has been recruitingnot only more parts of me but also my own citizens.My own soldiers.My own ships.My own ships.I can only guess what her goal is.But it cant be anything good.Do I understand correctly, I asked, already knowing the answer, that this other Anaander Mianaai is the force behind the ending of annexations?She will destroy everything Ive built!I had never seen the Lord of the Radch so frustrated and angry.Had not thought her capable of it.Do you realizetheres no reason you should ever have thought of itthat its the appropriation of resources during annexations that drives our economy?I am afraid, my lord, that I am only a troop carrier and have never concerned myself with such things.But what you say makes sense.And you.I doubt youre looking forward to losing your ancillaries.Outside me my distant companions, the Justices parked around the system, sat silent, waiting.How many of them had received this visitor both these visits?I am not, my lord.I cant promise that I can prevent it.Im not prepared for open warfare.All my moves are in secret, pushing here, pulling there, making sure of my resources and support.But in the end, she is me, and there is little I can do she will not already have thought of.She has outmaneuvered me several times already.Its why I have been so cautious in approaching you.I wanted to be sure she had not already suborned you.I felt it was safer not to comment on that, and instead said, through One Var, My lord, the guns in the lake, in Ors.Was that your enemy?I almost asked, but if we were faced with two Anaanders, each opposing the other, how did anyone know which was which?Events in Ors didnt come out precisely the way I wished, answered Anaander Mianaai.I never expected anyone would find those guns, but if some Orsian fisherman had found them and said nothing, or even taken them, my purpose would still have been served.Instead, Denz Ay had reported her find to Lieutenant Awn.The Lord of the Radch hadnt expected that, I saw, hadnt thought the Orsians trusted Lieutenant Awn that much.I didnt get what I wanted there, but perhaps the results will still serve my purpose.Hundred Captain Rubran is about to receive orders to depart this system for Valskaay.It was past time for you to leave, and you would have a year ago, if not for the Divine of Ikkts insistence that Lieutenant Awn stay, and my own opposition.Whether knowingly or not, Lieutenant Awn is the instrument of my enemy, Im certain of it.I did not trust even One Vars impassivity to answer that, and therefore did not speak.Above, on the central access deck, the Lord of the Radch continued to make changes, give orders, alter my thoughts.Still believing she could in fact do that.No one was surprised at the order to depart.Four other Justices already had in the last year, to destinations meant to be final.But neither I nor any of my officers had expected Valskaay, six gates away.Valskaay, that I had been sorry to leave.One hundred years ago, in the city of Vestris Cor, on Valskaay itself, One Esk had discovered volume upon volume of elaborate, multi voiced choral music, all intended for the rites of Valskaays troublesome religion, some of it dating from before humans had ever reached space.Downloaded everything it found so that it hardly regretted being sent away from such a treasure out to the countryside, hard work prying rebels from a reserve, forest and caverns and springs, that we couldnt just blast because it was a watershed for half the continent.A region of small rivers and bluffs, and farms.Grazing sheep and peach orchards.And musiceven the rebels, trapped at last, had sung, either in defiance against us or as consolation for themselves, their voices reaching my appreciative ears as I stood at the mouth of the cave where they hid.Death will overtake us  In whatever manner already fated  Everyone falls to it  And so long as Im ready  I dont fear it  No matter what form it takes.When I thought of Valskaay, I thought of sunshine and the sweet, bright taste of peaches.Thought of music.But I was sure I wouldnt be sent down to the planet this timethere would be no orchards for One Esk, no visits (unofficial, as unobtrusive as possible) to choral society meetings.Traveling to Valskaay I would not, it turned out, take the gates, but generate my own, moving more directly.The gates most travelers used had been generated millennia ago, were held constantly open, stable, surrounded by beacons broadcasting warnings, notifications, information about local regulations and navigation hazards.Not only ships, but messages and information streamed constantly through them.In the two thousand years I had been alive, I had used them once.Like all Radchaai warships, I was capable of making my own shortcut.It was more dangerous than using the established gatesan error in my calculations could send me anywhere, or nowhere, never to be heard from again.And since I left no structures behind to hold my gate open, I traveled in a bubble of normal space, isolated from everyone and everywhere until I exited at my destination.I didnt make such errors, and in the course of arranging an annexation the isolation could be an advantage.Now, though, the prospect of months alone, with Anaander Mianaai secretly occupying my Var deck, made me nervous.Before I gated out, a message came from Lieutenant Skaaiat for Lieutenant Awn.Brief.I said keep in touch.I meant it.Lieutenant Dariet said, See, I told you.But Lieutenant Awn didnt answer.15   At some point I opened my eyes again, thinking I had heard voices.All around me, blue.I tried to blink, found I could only close my eyes and leave them closed.Sometime later I opened my eyes again, turned my head to the right, and saw Seivarden and the girl squatting on either side of a Tiktik board.So I was dreaming, or hallucinating.At least I no longer hurt, which on consideration was a bad sign, but I couldnt bring myself to care much.I closed my eyes again.I woke, finally, actual wakefulness, and found myself in a small blue walled room.I lay in a bed, and on a bench beside it Seivarden sat, leaning against the wall, looking as though she hadnt slept recently.Or, that is to say, even more as though she hadnt slept recently than she usually did.I lifted my head.My arms and legs were immobilized by correctives.Youre awake, said Seivarden.I set my head back down.Wheres my pack?Right here.She bent, lifted it into my line of sight.Were at the medical center in Therrod, I guessed, and closed my eyes.Yes.Do you think you can talk to the doctor?Because I cant understand anything she says.I remembered my dream.You learned to play Tiktik.Thats different.So, not a dream.You sold the flier.No answer.You bought kef.No, I didnt, she protested.I was going to.But when I woke up and you were gone I heard her shift uncomfortably on the bench.I was going to find a dealer, but it bothered me that you were gone and I didnt know where you were.I started to think maybe youd left me behind.You wouldnt have cared once you took the kef.But I didnt have the kef, she said, voice surprisingly reasonable.And then I went to the front and found youd checked out.And you decided to find me, and not the kef, I said.I dont believe you.I dont blame you.She was silent for five seconds.Ive been sitting here, thinking.I accused you of hating me because I was better than you.Thats not why I hate you.She ignored that.Amaats grace, that fall it was my own stupid fault, I was sure I was dead, and if it had been the other way around Id never have jumped to save anyones life.You never knelt to get anywhere.You are where you are because youre fucking capable, and willing to risk everything to do right, and Ill never be half what you are even if I tried my whole life, and I was walking around thinking I was better than you, even half dead and no use to anyone, because my family is old, because I was born better.That, I said, is why I hate you.She laughed, as though Id said something moderately witty.If thats what youre willing to do for someone you hate, what would you do for someone you loved?I found I was incapable of answering.Fortunately the doctor came in, broad, round faced, pale.Frowning slightly, slightly more when she saw me.It seems, she said, in an even tone that seemed impartial but implied disapproval, that I dont understand your friend when he tries to explain what happened.I looked at Seivarden, who made a helpless gesture and said, I dont understand any of it.I tried my best and the whole day shes been giving me that look, like Im biological waste she stepped in.Its probably just her normal expression.I turned my head back to the doctor.We fell off the bridge, I explained.The doctors expression didnt change.Both of you?Yes.A moment of impassive silence, and then, It does not pay to be dishonest with your doctor.And then when I didnt answer, You would not be the first tourist to enter a restricted area and be injured.You are, however, the first to claim theyd fallen off the bridge and lived.I dont know whether to admire the brazenness, or be angry you take me for such a fool.Still I said nothing.No story I could invent would account for my injuries in the way the truth did.Members of military forces must register on arrival in the system, the doctor continued.I remember hearing so.Did you register?No, because I am not a member of any military force.Not quite a lie.I was not a member, I was a piece of equipment.A lone, useless fragment of equipment at that.This facility is not equipped, the doctor said, just a shade more sternly than the moment before, to deal with the sort of implants and augmentations you apparently have.I cant predict the results of the repairs Ive programmed.You should see a doctor when you return home.To the Gerentate.That last sounded just slightly skeptical, the barest indication of the doctors disbelief.I intend to go straight home once I leave here, I said, but I wondered if the doctor had reported us as possible spies.I thought notif she had, likely she would have avoided expressing any sort of suspicion, merely waited for authorities to deal with us.She had not, then.Why not?A possible answer stuck her head into the room and called cheerily, Breq!Youre awake!Uncles on the level just above.What happened?Your friend seemed like he was saying you jumped off the bridge but thats impossible.Do you feel better?The girl came fully into the room.Hello, Doctor, is Breq going to be all right?Breq will be fine.The correctives should drop off by tomorrow.Unless something goes wrong.And with that cheerful observation she turned and left the room.The girl sat on the edge of my bed.Your friend is a terrible Tiktik player, Im glad I didnt teach him the gambling part or he wouldnt have had any money to pay the doctor with.And its your money, isnt it?From the flier.Seivarden frowned.What?What is she saying?I resolved to check the contents of my pack as soon as I could.Hed have won it back playing counters.From the look on her face, the girl didnt believe that at all.You really shouldnt go under the bridge, you know.I know someone who had a friend whose cousin went under the bridge and someone dropped a piece of bread off, and it was going so fast it hit them in the head and broke their skull open and went into their brain and killed them.I enjoyed your cousins singing very much.I didnt want to reopen the discussion about what had happened.Isnt she wonderful?Oh!She turned her head, as though shed heard something.I have to go.Ill visit you again!Id appreciate that, I said, and she was out the door and away.I looked at Seivarden.How much did this cost?About what I got for the flier, she said, ducking her head slightly, maybe out of embarrassment.Maybe something else.Did you take anything out of my pack?That brought her head up again.No!I swear I didnt.I didnt answer.You dont believe me.I dont blame you.You can check, as soon as your hands are free.I intend to.But then what?She frowned, not comprehending.And of course she didnt understandshe had gotten as far as (mistakenly) evaluating me as a human being who might be worthy of respect.She had not, it seemed, come to the point of considering she might not actually be important enough for the Radch to send a Special Missions officer after.I was never assigned to find you, I said.I found you completely by accident.As far as I know, no one is looking for you.I wished I could gesture, wave her away.Why are you here, then?Its not groundwork for an annexation, there arent any more.Thats what they told me.No more annexations, I agreed.But thats not the point.The point is, you can come or go as you like, I have no orders to bring you back.Seivarden considered that for six seconds, and then said, I tried to quit before.I did quit.This station I was on had a program, youd quit, theyd give you a job.One of their workers hauled me in and cleaned me up and told me the deal.The job was crap, the deal was bullshit, but Id had enough.I thought Id had enough.How long did you last?Not quite six months.You see, I said, after a two second pause, why I dont exactly have confidence in you this time.Believe me, I do.But this is different.She leaned forward, earnest.Nothing quite clarifies your thoughts like thinking youre about to die.The effect is often temporary.They said, back on that station, that they could give me something to make kef never work on me.But first I had to fix whatever had made me take it to begin with, because otherwise Id just find something else.Bullshit, like I said, but if Id really wanted to, really meant to, Id have done it then.Back at Strigans shed spoken as though her reason for starting was simple, clear cut.Did you tell them why you started?She didnt answer.Did you tell them who you were?Of course not.The two questions were the same in her mind, I guessed.You faced death back at Garsedd.She flinched, just slightly.And everything changed.I woke up and all I had was past.Not a very good past, either, no one liked telling me what had happened, everyone was so polite and cheerful and it was all fake.And I couldnt see any kind of future.Listen.She leaned forward, earnest, breathing slightly harder.Youre out here on your own, all by yourself, and obviously its because youre suited to it or you wouldnt have been assigned.She paused a moment, maybe considering that issue of just who was suited to what, who was assigned where, and dismissing it.But in the end, you can go back to the Radch and find people who know you, people who remember you, personally, a place where you fit even if youre not always there.No matter where you go, youre still part of that pattern, even if you never go back you always know its there.But when they opened that suspension pod, anyone who ever had any personal interest in me was already seven hundred years dead.Probably longer.Not even Her voice trembled, and she stopped, staring ahead at some fixed point beyond me.Even the ships.Even the ships.Ships?More than just Sword of Nathtas?My the first ship I ever served on.Justice of Toren.I thought maybe if I could find where it was stationed I could send a message and She made a negating gesture, wiping out the rest of that sentence.It disappeared.About ten wait Ive lost track of time.About fifteen years ago.Closer to twenty.Nobody could tell me what happened.Nobody knows.Were any of the ships you served on particularly fond of you?I asked, voice carefully even.Neutral.She blinked.Straightened.Thats an odd question.Do you have any experience with ships?Yes, I said.Actually.Ships are always attached to their captains.Not like they used to be.Not like when some ships had gone mad on the deaths of their captains.That had been long, long ago.And even so, they have favorites.Though a favorite wouldnt necessarily know it.But it doesnt matter, does it?Ships arent people, and theyre made to serve you, to be attached, as you put it.Seivarden frowned.Now youre angry.Youre very good at hiding it, but youre angry.Do you grieve for your ships, I asked, because theyre dead?Or because their loss means they arent here to make you feel connected and cared about?Silence.Or do you think those are the same thing?Still no answer.I will answer my own question: you were never a favorite of any of the ships you served on.You dont believe its possible for a ship to have favorites.Seivardens eyes widenedmaybe surprise, maybe something else.You know me too well for me to believe you arent here because of me.Ive thought so from the moment I actually started thinking about it.Not too long ago, then, I said.She ignored what I had just said.Youre the first person, since that pod opened, to feel familiar.Like I recognize you.Like you recognize me.I dont know why that is.I knew, of course.But this was not the moment to say so, to explain, immobilized and vulnerable as I was.I assure you Im not here because of you.Im here on my own personal business.You jumped off that bridge for me.And Im not going to be your reason for quitting kef.I take no responsibility for you.Youre going to have to do that yourself.If you really are going to do that.You jumped off that bridge for me.That had to be a three kilometer drop.Higher.Thats thats She stopped, shaking her head.Im staying with you.I closed my eyes.The moment I even think youre going to steal from me again, I will break both your legs and leave you there, and it will be utter coincidence if you ever see me again.Except that to Radchaai, there were no coincidences.I guess I cant really argue with that.I dont recommend it.She gave a short laugh, and then was silent for fifteen seconds.Tell me, then, Breq, she said after that.If youre here on personal business, and nothing at all to do with me, why do you have one of the Garseddai guns in your pack?The correctives held my arms and legs completely immobile.I couldnt even get my shoulders off the bed.The doctor came heavily into the room, pale face flushed.Lie still!she admonished, and then turned to Seivarden.What did you do?This was, apparently, comprehensible to Seivarden.She spread her hands in a helpless gesture.Not!she replied, vehemently, in the same language.The doctor frowned, pointed at Seivarden, one finger out.Seivarden straightened, indignant at the gesture, which was much ruder to a Radchaai than it was here.You bother, the doctor said, sternly, you go!Then she turned to me.You will lie still and heal properly.Yes, Doctor.I subsided from the very small amount of movement I had managed.Took a breath, attempting to calm myself.This seemed to mollify her.She watched me a moment, doubtless seeing my heart rate, my breathing.If you cant settle, I can give you medication.An offer, a question, a threat.I can make himwith a glance at Seivardenleave.I dont need it.Either one.The doctor gave a skeptical hmph, and turned and left the room.Im sorry, said Seivarden when the doctor was gone.That was stupid.I should have thought before I spoke.I didnt answer.When we got to the bottom, she continued, as though it was logically connected to what she had said before, you were unconscious.And obviously badly injured, and I was afraid to move you much, because I couldnt see if maybe bones were broken.I didnt have any way to call for help, but I thought maybe you had something I could use to help climb out, or maybe some first aid correctives I could use, but of course that was foolish, your armor was still up, which was how I knew you were still alive.I did take your handheld out of your coat, but there was no signal, I had to climb up to the top before I could reach anyone.When I got back your armor was down and I was afraid you were dead.Everythings still in there.If the gun is gone, I said, voice calm and neutral, I wont just break your legs.Its there, she insisted.But this cant possibly be personal business, can it?Its personal.It was just that with me personal affected a great many others.But how could I explain that, without revealing more than I wanted to just now?Tell me.This was not a good time.Not a good moment.But there was a great deal to explain, especially since Seivardens knowledge of the past thousand years of history was sure to be patchy and superficial.Years of previous events leading up to this, which she would almost certainly be ignorant of, which would take time to explain, before I ever got to who I was and what I intended.And that history would make a difference.Without understanding it, how could Seivarden understand anything?Without that context, how could she understand why anyone had acted as they did?If Anaander Mianaai had not reacted with such fury to the Garseddai, would she have done the things shed done in the thousand years since then?If Lieutenant Awn had never heard of the events at Ime five years before, twenty five years ago now, would she have acted as she did?When I imagined it, the moment that Mercy of Sarrse soldier had chosen to defy her orders, I saw her as a segment of an ancillary unit.She had been number One of Mercy of Sarrses Amaat unit, its senior member.Even though she had been human, had had a name beyond her place on her ship, beyond Mercy of Sarrse One Amaat One.But I had never seen a recording, had never seen her face.She had been human.She had endured events at Imeperhaps even enforced the corrupt dictates of the governor herself, when ordered.But something about that particular moment had changed things.Something had been too much for her.What had it been?The sight, perhaps, of a Rrrrrr, dead or dying?Id seen pictures of the Rrrrrr, snake long, furred, multi limbed, speaking in growls and barks; and the humans associated with them, who could speak that language and understand it.Had it been the Rrrrrr who had knocked Mercy of Sarrse One Amaat One off her expected path?Did she care so much for the threat of breaking the treaty with the Presger?Or had it been the thought of killing so many helpless human beings?If I had known more about her, perhaps I could have seen why in that moment she had decided that she would rather die.I knew almost nothing about her.Probably by design.But even the little I had known, the little Lieutenant Awn had known, had made a difference.Did anyone tell you about what happened at Ime Station?Seivarden frowned.No.Tell me.I told her.About the governors corruption, her preventing Ime Station or any of the ships from reporting what she was doing, so far from anywhere else in Radch space.About the ship that had arrived one daytheyd assumed it was human, no one knew of any aliens anywhere nearby, and it obviously wasnt Radchaai and so it was fair game.I told Seivarden as much as I knew about the soldiers from Mercy of Sarrse who boarded the unknown ship with orders to take it and kill anyone aboard who resisted, or who obviously couldnt be made into ancillaries.I didnt know muchonly that once the One Amaat unit had boarded the alien ship, its One had refused to continue to follow orders.She had convinced the rest of One Amaat to follow her, and they had defected to the Rrrrrr and taken the ship out of reach.Seivardens frown only deepened, and when I was done she said, So, youre telling me the governor of Ime was completely corrupt.And somehow had the accesses to prevent Ime Station from reporting her?How does that happen?I didnt answer.Either the obvious conclusion would occur to her, or she would be unable to see it.And how could the aptitudes have put her in such a position, if she was capable of that?It isnt possible.Of course, Seivarden continued, everything else follows from that, doesnt it?A corrupt governor appoints corrupt officials, never mind the aptitudes.But the captains stationed there no, it isnt possible.She wouldnt be able to see it.I shouldnt have said anything at all.When that soldier refused to kill the Rrrrrr who had come into the system, when she convinced the rest of her unit to do likewise, she created a situation that could not be concealed for long.The Rrrrrr could generate their own gate, so the governor couldnt prevent them from leaving.They had only to make a single jump to the next inhabited system and tell their story.Which was exactly what they did.Why did anyone care about the Rrrrrr?Seivarden couldnt quite get her throat around the sound.Seriously?Theyre called that?Its what they call themselves, I explained, in my most patient voice.When a Rrrrrr said it, or one of their human translators, it sounded like a sustained growl, not much different from any other Rrrrrr speech.Its kind of hard to say.Most people Ive heard just say a long r sound.Rrrrrr, Seivarden said, experimentally.Still sounds funny.So why did anyone care about the Rrrrrr?Because the Presger had made a treaty with us on the basis of their having decided humans were Significant.Killing the Insignificant is nothing, to the Presger, and violence between members of the same species means nothing to them, but indiscriminate violence toward other Significant species is unacceptable.Not to say no violence is allowed, but its subject to certain conditions, none of which make obvious sense to most humans so its safest just to avoid it altogether.Seivarden made a breathy huh, pieces falling into place.So then, I continued, the entire One Amaat unit of Mercy of Sarrse had defected to the Rrrrrr.They were out of reach, safe with the aliens, but to the Radchaai they were guilty of treason.It might have been better just to leave them where they were, but instead the Radch demanded them back, so they could be executed.And of course the Rrrrrr didnt want to do that.The One Amaat unit had saved their lives.Things were very tense for several years, but eventually they compromised.The Rrrrrr handed over the unit leader, the one whod started the mutiny, in exchange for immunity for the others.But Seivarden stopped.After seven seconds of silence, I said, Youre thinking that of course she had to die, no disobedience can be tolerated, for very good reasons.But at the same time, her treason exposed the governor of Imes corruption, which otherwise would have continued unabated, so ultimately she did the Radch a service.Youre thinking that any fool knows better than to speak up and criticize a government official for any reason.And youre thinking that if anyone who speaks up to criticize something obviously evil is punished merely for speaking, civilization will be in a bad way.No one will speak who isnt willing to die for her speech, and I hesitated.Swallowed.There arent many willing to do that.Youre probably thinking that the Lord of the Radch was in a difficult spot, deciding how to handle the situation.But also that these particular circumstances were extraordinary, and Anaander Mianaai is, in the end, the ultimate authority and might have pardoned her if she wished.Im thinking, said Seivarden, that the Lord of the Radch could have just let them stay with the Rrrrrr and been free of the whole mess.She could have, I agreed.Im also thinking that if I were the Lord of the Radch, I would never have let that news get much farther than Ime.Youd use accesses to prevent ships and stations from talking about it, maybe.Youd forbid any citizens who knew to say anything.Yes.I would.But it would still spread by rumor.Though that rumor would of necessity be vague and slow moving.And youd lose the very instructive example you could make, letting everyone watch you line up nearly all of Imes Administration on the station concourse and shoot them in the head, one after the other.And, of course, Seivarden was a single person, who was thinking of Anaander Mianaai as a single person who could be undecided about such things, but then choose a single course of action, without dividing herself over her decision.And there was a great deal more behind Anaander Mianaais dilemma than Seivarden had grasped.Seivarden was silent for four seconds, and then said, Now Im going to make you angry again.Really?I asked, drily.Arent you getting tired of that?Yes.Simply.Seriously.The governor of Ime was wellborn and well bred, I said, and named her house.Never heard of them, said Seivarden.Thereve been so many changes.And now things like this happening.You honestly dont think theres a connection?I turned my head away, without lifting it.Not angry, just very, very tired.You mean to say, none of this would have happened if jumped up provincials hadnt been jumped up.If the governor of Ime had been from a family of real proven quality.Seivarden had wit enough not to answer.Youve honestly never known anyone born better to be assigned or promoted past their ability?To crack under pressure?Behave badly?Not like that.Fair enough.But shed conveniently forgotten that Mercy of Sarrse One Amaat Onehuman, not an ancillarywould also have been jumped up by her definition, was part of the very change Seivarden had mentioned.Jumped up provincials and the sort of thing that happened at Ime are both results of the same events.One did not cause the other.She asked the obvious question.What caused it, then?The answer was too complicated.How far back to begin?It started at Garsedd.It started when the Lord of the Radch multiplied herself and set out to conquer all of human space.It started when the Radch was built.And further back.Im tired, I said.Of course, said Seivarden, more equably than I had expected.We can talk about it later.16   I spent a week moving in the non space between Shisurna and Valskaayisolated, self containedbefore the Lord of the Radch made her move.No one else suspected anything, I had given no hint, no trace, not the faintest indication that anyone at all was on Var deck, that anything at all might be wrong.Or so I had thought.Ship, Lieutenant Awn said to me, a week in, is something wrong?Why do you ask, Lieutenant?I replied.One Esk replied.One Esk attended Lieutenant Awn constantly.We were in Ors together a long time, Lieutenant Awn said, frowning slightly at the segment she was talking to.She had been in a constant state of misery since Ors, sometimes more intense, sometimes less, depending, I supposed, on what thoughts occurred to her at a given moment.You just seem like somethings troubling you.And youre quieter.She made a sound, breathy half amusement.You were always humming or singing in the house.Its too quiet now.There are walls here, Lieutenant, I pointed out.There were none in the house in Ors.Her eyebrow twitched just slightly.I could see she knew my words for an evasion, but she didnt pursue the question.At the same time, in the Var decade room, Anaander Mianaai said to me, You understand the stakes.What this means for the Radch.I acknowledged this.I know this must be disturbing to you.It was the first acknowledgment of this possibility since she had come aboard.I made you to serve my ends, for the good of the Radch.Its part of your design, to want to serve me.And now you must not only serve me, but also oppose me.She was, I thought, making it remarkably easy for me to oppose her.One side or the other of her had done that, and I wasnt sure which.But I said, through One Var, Yes, my lord.If she succeeds, ultimately the Radch will fragment.Not the center, not the Radch itself.When most people spoke of the Radch they meant all of Radchaai territory, but in truth the Radch was a single location, a Dyson sphere, enclosed, self contained.Nothing ritually impure was allowed within, no one uncivilized or nonhuman could enter its confines.Very, very few of Mianaais clients had ever set foot there, and only a few houses still existed who even had ancestors who had once lived there.It was an open question if anyone within knew or cared about the actions of Anaander Mianaai, or the extent or even existence of Radch territory.The Radch itself, as the Radch, will survive longer.But my territory, that I built to protect it, to keep it pure, will shatter.I made myself into what I am, built all thisshe gestured sweepingly, the walls of the decade room encompassing, for her purposes, the entirety of Radch spaceall this, to keep that center safe.Uncontaminated.I couldnt trust it to anyone else.Now, it seems, I cant trust it to myself.Surely not, my lord, I said, at a loss for what else to say, not sure exactly what I was protesting.Billions of citizens will die in the process, she continued, as though I had not spoken.Through war, or lack of resources.And I  She hesitated.Unity, I thought, implies the possibility of disunity.Beginnings imply and require endings.But I did not say so.The most powerful person in the universe didnt need me to lecture her on religion or philosophy.But I am already broken, she finished.I can only fight to prevent my breaking further.Remove what is no longer myself.I wasnt sure what I should, or could, say.I had no conscious memory of having this conversation previously, though I was certain now I must have, must have listened to Anaander Mianaai explain and justify her actions, after she used the overrides and changed something.It must have been quite similar, perhaps even the same words.It had, after all, been the same person.And, Anaander Mianaai continued, I must remove my enemys weapons wherever I find them.Send Lieutenant Awn to me.Lieutenant Awn approached the Var decade room with trepidation, not knowing why I had sent her there.I had refused to answer her questions, which had only fed a growing feeling on her part that something was very wrong.Her boots on the white floor echoed emptily, despite One Vars presence.As she reached it the decade room door slid open, nearly noiseless.The sight of Anaander Mianaai within hit Lieutenant Awn like a blow, a vicious spike of fear, surprise, dread, shock, doubt, and bewilderment.Lieutenant Awn took three breaths, shallower, I could see, than she liked, and then hitched her shoulders just the slightest bit, stepped in, and prostrated herself.Lieutenant, said Anaander Mianaai.Her accent, and tone, were the prototype of Lieutenant Skaaiats elegant vowels, of Lieutenant Issaaias thoughtless, slightly sneering arrogance.Lieutenant Awn lay facedown, waiting.Frightened.As before I received no data from Mianaai that she did not deliberately send me.I had no information about her internal state.She seemed calm.Impassive, emotionless.I was sure that surface impression was a lie, though I didnt understand why I thought that, except that she had yet to speak favorably of Lieutenant Awn, when in my opinion she should have.Tell me, Lieutenant, said Mianaai, after a long silence, where those guns came from, and what you think happened in the temple of Ikkt.A combination of relief and fear washed through Lieutenant Awn.She had, in the moments available to process Anaander Mianaais presence here, formed an expectation that this question would be asked.My lord, the guns could only have come from someone with sufficient authority to divert them and prevent their destruction.You, for instance.A sharp stab of startlement and terror.No, my lord, I assure you.I did disarm noncitizens local to my assignment, and some of them were Tanmind military.The police station in the upper city had been quite well armed, in fact.But I had those disabled on the spot, before I sent them on.And according to their inventory numbers, these had been collected in Kould Ves.By Justice of Toren troops?So I understand, my lord.Ship?I answered with one of One Vars mouths.My lord, the guns in question were collected by Sixteen and Seventeen Inu.I named their lieutenant at the time, who had since been reassigned.Anaander Mianaai made the barest hint of a frown.So as far back as five years ago, someone with accessperhaps this Inu lieutenant, perhaps someone else, prevented these weapons from being destroyed, and hid them.For five years.And then, what, planted them in the Orsian swamp?To what end?Face still to the floor, blinking in confusion, Lieutenant Awn took one second to frame a reply.I dont know, my lord.Youre lying, said Mianaai, still sitting, leaning back in her chair as though quite relaxed and unconcerned, but her eyes had not left Lieutenant Awn.I can see plainly that you are.And Ive heard every conversation youve had, since the incident.Who did you mean when you spoke of someone else who would benefit from the situation?If Id known what name to put there, my lord, I would have used it.I only meant by it that there must be a specific person who acted, who caused it She stopped, took a breath, abandoned that sentence.Someone conspired with the Tanmind, someone who had access to those guns.Whoever it was, they wanted trouble between the upper city and the lower.It was my job to prevent that.I did my best to prevent that.Certainly an evasion.From the moment Anaander Mianaai had ordered the hasty execution of those Tanmind citizens in the temple, the first, most obvious suspect had been the Lord of the Radch herself.Why would anyone want trouble between the upper city and the lower?Anaander Mianaai asked.Who would exert themselves over it?Jen Shinnan, my lord, and her associates, answered Lieutenant Awn, on firmer ground, for the moment at least.
