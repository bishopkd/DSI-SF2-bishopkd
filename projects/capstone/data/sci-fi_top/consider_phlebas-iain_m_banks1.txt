 Consider Phlebas  Iain Banks  Idolatry is worse than carnage.The Koran, 2: 190   Gentile or Jew  O you who turn the wheel and look to windward,  Consider Phlebas, who was once handsome and tall as you.T.  S.  Eliot,  "The Waste Land', IV     Prologue  The ship didn't even have a name.It had no human crew because the factory craft which constructed it had been evacuated long ago.It had no life support or accommodation units for the same reason.It had no class number or fleet designation because it was a mongrel made from bits and pieces of different types of warcraft; and it didn't have a name because the factory craft had no time left for such niceties.The dockyard threw the ship together as best it could from its depleted stock of components, even though most of the weapon, power and sensory systems were either faulty, superseded or due for overhaul.The factory vessel knew that its own destruction was inevitable, but there was just a chance that its last creation might have the speed and the luck to escape.The one perfect, priceless component the factory craft did have was the vastly powerful  though still raw and untrained  Mind around which it had constructed the rest of the ship.If it could get the Mind to safety, the factory vessel thought it would have done well.Nevertheless, there was another reason  the real reason  the dockyard mother didn't give its warship child a name; it thought there was something else it lacked: hope.The ship left the construction bay of the factory craft with most of its fitting out still to be done.Accelerating hard, its course a four dimensional spiral through a blizzard of stars where it knew that only danger waited, it powered into hyperspace on spent engines from an overhauled craft of one class, watched its birthplace disappear astern with battle damaged sensors from a second, and tested outdated weapon units cannibalised from yet another.Inside its warship body, in narrow, unlit, unheated, hard vacuum spaces, constructor drones struggled to install or complete sensors, displacers, field generators, shield disruptors, laserfields, plasma chambers, warhead magazines, manoeuvring units, repair systems and the thousands of other major and minor components required to make a functional warship.Gradually, as it swept through the vast open reaches between the star systems, the vessel's internal structure changed, and it became less chaotic, more ordered, as the factory drones completed their tasks.Several tens of hours out on its first journey, while it was testing its track scanner by focusing back along the route it had taken, the ship registered a single massive annihilation explosion deep behind it, where the factory craft had been.It watched the blossoming shell of radiation expand for a while, then switched the scanner field to dead ahead and pushed yet more power through its already overloaded engines.The ship did all it could to avoid combat; it kept well away from the routes enemy craft would probably use; it treated every hint of any craft as a confirmed hostile sighting.At the same time, as it zigzagged and ducked and weaved and rose and fell, it was corkscrewing as fast as it could, as directly as it dared, down and across the strand of the galactic arm in which it had been born, heading for the edge of that great isthmus and the comparatively empty space beyond.On the far side, on the edge of the next limb, it might find safety.Just as it arrived at that first border, where the stars rose like a glittering cliff alongside emptiness, it was caught.A fleet of hostile craft, whose course by chance came close enough to that of the fleeing ship, detected its ragged, noisy emission shell, and intercepted it.The ship ran straight into their attack and was overwhelmed.Out armed, slow, vulnerable, it knew almost instantly that it had no chance even of inflicting any damage on the opposing fleet.So it destroyed itself, detonating the stock of warheads it carried in a sudden release of energy which for a second, in hyperspace alone, outshone the yellow dwarf star of a nearby system.Scattered in a pattern around it, an instant before the ship itself was blown into plasma, most of the thousands of exploding warheads formed an outrushing sphere of radiation through which any escape seemed impossible.In the fraction of a second the entire engagement lasted, there were at the end some millionths when the battle computers of the enemy fleet briefly analysed the four dimensional maze of expanding radiation and saw that there was one bewilderingly complicated and unlikely way out of the concentric shells of erupting energies now opening like the petals of some immense flower between the star systems.It was not, however, a route the Mind of a small, archaic warship could plan for, create and follow.By the time it was noticed that the ship's Mind had taken exactly that path through its screen of annihilation, it was too late to stop it from falling away through hyperspace towards the small, cold planet fourth out from the single yellow sun of the nearby system.It was also too late to do anything about the light from the ship's exploding warheads, which had been arranged in a crude code, describing the vessel's fate and the escaped Mind's status and position, and legible to anybody catching the unreal light as it sped through the galaxy.Perhaps worst of all  and had their design permitted such a thing, those electronic brains would now have felt dismay  the planet the Mind had made for through its shield of explosions was not one they could simply attack, destroy or even land on; it was Schar's World, near the region of barren space between two galactic strands called the Sullen Gulf, and it was one of the forbidden Planets of the Dead.1.Sorpen  The level was at his top lip now.Even with his head pressed hard back against the stones of the cell wall his Dose was only just above the surface.He wasn't going to get his hands free in time; he was going to drown.In the darkness of the cell, in its stink and warmth, while the sweat ran over his brows and tightly closed eyes and his trance went on and on, one part of his mind tried to accustom him to the idea of his own death.But, like an unseen insect buzzing in a quiet room, there was something else, something that would not go away, was of no use, and only annoyed.It was a sentence, irrelevant and pointless and so old he'd forgotten where he had heard or read it, and it went round and round the inside of his head like a marble spun round the inside of a jug:  The Jinmoti of Bozlen Two kill the hereditary ritual assassins of the new Yearking's immediate family by drowning them in the tears of the Continental Empathaur in its Sadness Season.At one point, shortly after his ordeal had begun and he was only part way into his trance, he had wondered what would happen if he threw up.It had been when the palace kitchens  about fifteen or sixteen floors above, if his calculations were correct  had sent their waste down the sinuous network of plumbing that led to the sewercell.The gurgling, watery mess had dislodged some rotten food from the last time some poor wretch had drowned in filth and garbage, and that was when he felt he might vomit.It had been almost comforting to work out that it would make no difference to the time of his death.Then he had wondered  in that state of nervous frivolity which sometimes afflicts those who can do nothing but wait in a situation of mortal threat  whether crying would speed his death.In theory it would, though in practical terms it was irrelevant; but that was when the sentence started to roll round in his head.The Jinmoti of Bozlen Two kill the hereditary ritual  The liquid, which he could hear and feel and smell all too clearly  and could probably have seen with his far from ordinary eyes had they been open  washed briefly up to touch the bottom of his nose.He felt it block his nostrils, filling them with a stench that made his stomach heave.But he shook his head, tried to force his skull even further back against the stones, and the foul broth fell away.He blew down and could breathe again.There wasn't long now.He checked his wrists again, but it was no good.It would take another hour or more, and he had only minutes, if he was lucky.The trance was breaking anyway.He was returning to almost total consciousness, as though his brain wanted fully to appreciate his own death, its own extinction.He tried to think of something profound, or to see his life flash in front of him, or suddenly to remember some old love, a long forgotten prophecy or premonition, but there was nothing, just an empty sentence, and the sensations of drowning in other people's dirt and waste.You old bastards, he thought.One of their few strokes of humour or originality had been devising an elegant, ironic way of death.How fitting it must feel to them, dragging their decrepit frames to the banquet hall privies, literally to defecate all over their enemies, and thereby kill them.The air pressure built up, and a distant, groaning rumble of liquid signalled another flushing from above.You old bastards.Well, I hope at least you kept your promise, Balveda.The Jinmoti of Bozlen Two kill the hereditary ritual thought one part of his brain, as the pipes in the ceiling spluttered and the waste splashed into the warm mass of liquid which almost filled the cell.The wave passed over his face, then fell back to leave his nose free for a second and give him time to gulp a lungful of air.Then the liquid rose gently to touch the bottom of his nose again, and stayed there.He held his breath.It had hurt at first, when they had hung him up.His hands, tied inside tight leather pouches, were directly above his head, manacled inside thick loops of iron bolted to the cell walls, which took all his weight.His feet were tied together and left to dangle inside an iron tube, also attached to the wall, which stopped him from taking any weight on his feet and knees and at the same time prevented him from moving his legs more than a hand's breadth out from the wall or to either side.The tube ended just above his knees; above it there was only a thin and dirty loincloth to hide his ancient and grubby nakedness.He had shut off the pain from his wrists and shoulders even while the four burly guards, two of them perched on ladders, had secured him in place.Even so he could feel that niggling sensation at the back of his skull which told him that he ought to be hurting.That had lessened gradually as the level of waste in the small sewercell had risen and buoyed up his body.He had started to go into a trance then, as soon as the guards left, though he knew it was probably hopeless.It hadn't lasted long; the cell door opened again within minutes, a metal walkway was lowered by a guard onto the damp flagstones of the cell floor, and light from the corridor washed into the darkness.He had stopped the Changing trance and craned his neck to see who his visitor might be.Into the cell, holding a short staff glowing cool blue, stepped the stooped, grizzled figure of Amahain Frolk, security minister for the Gerontocracy of Sorpen.The old man smiled at him and nodded approvingly, then turned to the corridor and, with a thin, discoloured hand, beckoned somebody standing outside the cell to step onto the short walkway and enter.He guessed it would be the Culture agent Balveda, and it was.She came lightly onto the metal boarding, looked round slowly, and fastened her gaze on him.He smiled and tried to nod in greeting, his ears rubbing on his naked arms."Balveda!I thought I might see you again.Come to see the host of the party?"He forced a grin.Officially it was his banquet; he was the host.Another of the Gerontocracy's little jokes.He hoped his voice had shown no signs of fear.Perosteck Balveda, agent of the Culture, a full head taller than the old man by her side and still strikingly handsome even in the pallid glow of the blue torch, shook her thin, finely made head slowly.Her short, black hair lay like a shadow on her skull."No," she said, "I didn't want to see you, or say goodbye. ""You put me here, Balveda," he said quietly."Yes, and there you belong," Amahain Frolk said, stepping as far forward on the platform as he could without overbalancing and having to step onto the damp floor."I wanted you tortured first, but Miss Balveda here"  the minister's high, scratchy voice echoed in the cell as he turned his head back to the woman  "pleaded for you, though God knows why.But that's where you belong all right; murderer. "He shook the staff at the almost naked man hanging on the dirty wall of the cell.Balveda looked at her feet, just visible under the hem of the long, plain grey gown she wore.A circular pendant on a chain around her neck glinted in the light from the corridor outside.Amahain Frolk had stepped back beside her, holding the shining staff up and squinting at the captive."You know, even now I could almost swear that was Egratin hanging there.I can" He shook his gaunt, bony head. "I can hardly believe it isn't, not until he opens his mouth, anyway.My God, these Changers are dangerous frightening things!"He turned to Balveda.She smoothed her hair at the nape of her neck and looked down at the old man."They are also an ancient and proud people, Minister, and there are very few of them left.May I ask you one more time?Please?Let him live.He might be "  The Gerontocrat waved a thin and twisted hand at her, his face distorting in a grimace."No!You would do well, Miss Balveda, not to keep asking for this this assassin, this murderous, treacherous spy, to be spared.Do you think we take the cowardly murder and impersonation of one of our Outworld ministers lightly?What damage this thing could have caused!Why, when we arrested it two of our guards died just from being scratched!Another is blind for life after this monster spat in his eye!However," Amahain Frolk sneered at the man chained to the wall, "we took those teeth out.And his hands are tied so that he can't even scratch himself. "He turned to Balveda again."You say they are few?I say good; there will soon be one less. "The old man narrowed his eyes as he looked at the woman."We are grateful to you and your people for exposing this fraud and murderer, but do not think that gives you the right to tell us what to do.There are some in the Gerontocracy who want nothing to do with any outside influence, and their voices grow in volume by the day as the war comes closer.You would do well not to antagonise those of us who do support your cause. "Balveda pursed her lips and looked down at her feet again, clasping her slender hands behind her back.Amahain Frolk had turned back to the man hanging on the wall, wagging the staff in his direction as he spoke."You will soon be dead, impostor, and with you die your masters" plans for the domination of our peaceful system!The same fate awaits them if they try to invade us.We and the Culture are "  He shook his head as best he could and roared back, "Frolk, you're an idiot!"The old man shrank away as though hit.The Changer went on, "Can't you see you're going to be taken over anyway?Probably by the Idirans, but if not by them then by the Culture.You don't control your own destinies any more; the war's stopped all that.Soon this whole sector will be part of the front, unless you make it part of the Idiran sphere.I was only sent in to tell you what you should have known anyway  not to cheat you into something you'd regret later.For God's sake, man, the Idirans won't eat you "  "Ha!They look as though they could!Monsters with three feet; invaders, killers, infidels You want us to link with them?With three strides tall monsters?To be ground under their hooves?To have to worship their false gods?""At least they have a God, Frolk.The Culture doesn't. "The ache in his arms was coming back as he concentrated on talking.He shifted as best he could and looked down at the minister."They at least think the same way you do.The Culture doesn't. ""Oh no, my friend, oh no. "Amahain Frolk held one hand up flat to him and shook his head."You won't sow seeds of discord like that. ""My God, you stupid old man," he laughed."You want to know who the real representative of the Culture is on this planet?It's not her," he nodded at the woman, "it's that powered flesh slicer she has following her everywhere, her knife missile.She might make the decisions, it might do what she tells it, but it's the real emissary.That's what the Culture's about: machines.You think because Balveda's got two legs and soft skin you should be on her side, but it's the Idirans who are on the side of life in this war "  "Well, you will shortly be on the other side of that. "The Gerontocrat snorted and glanced at Balveda, who was looking from under lowered brows at the man chained to the wall."Let us go, Miss Balveda," Amahain Frolk said as he turned and took the woman's arm to guide her from the cell."This thing's presence smells more than the cell. "Balveda looked up at him then, ignoring the dwarfed minister as he tried to pull her to the door.She gazed right at the prisoner with her clear, black irised eyes and held her hands out from her sides."I'm sorry," she said to him."Believe it or not, that's rather how I feel," he replied, nodding."Just promise me you'll eat and drink very little tonight, Balveda.I'd like to think there was one person up there on my side, and it might as well be my worst enemy. "He had meant it to be defiant and funny, but it sounded only bitter; he looked away from the woman's face."I promise," Balveda said.She let herself be led to the door, and the blue light waned in the dank cell.She stopped right at the door.By sticking his head painfully far out he could just see her.The knife missile was there, too, he noticed, just inside the room; probably there all the time, but he hadn't noticed its sleek, sharp little body hovering there in the darkness.He looked into Balveda's dark eyes as the knife missile moved.For a second he thought Balveda had instructed the tiny machine to kill him now  quietly and quickly while she blocked Amahain Frolk's view  and his heart thudded.But the small device simply floated past Balveda's face and out into the corridor.Balveda raised one hand in a gesture of farewell."Bora Horza Gobuchul," she said, "goodbye. "She turned quickly, stepped from the platform and out of the cell.The walkway was hoisted out and the door slammed, scraping rubber flanges over the grimy floor and hissing once as the internal seals made it watertight.He hung there, looking down at an invisible floor for a moment before going back into the trance that would Change his wrists, thin them down so that he could escape.But something about the solemn, final way Balveda had spoken his name had crushed him inside, and he knew then, if not before, that there was no escape.by drowning them in the tears  His lungs were bursting!His mouth quivered, his throat was gagging, the filth was in his ears but he could hear a great roaring, see lights though it was black dark.His stomach muscles started to go in and out, and he had to clamp his jaw to stop his mouth opening for air that wasn't there.Now.No now he had to give in.Not yet surely now.Now, now, now, any second; surrender to this awful black vacuum inside him he had to breathe now!Before he had time to open his mouth he was smashed against the wall  punched against the stones as though some immense iron fist had slammed into him.He blew out the stale air from his lungs in one convulsive breath.His body was suddenly cold, and every pan of it next to the wall throbbed with pain.Death, it seemed, was weight, pain, cold and too much light  He brought his head up.He moaned at the light.He tried to see, tried to hear.What was happening?Why was he breathing?Why was he so damn heavy again?His body was tearing his arms from their sockets; his wrists were cut almost to the bone.Who had done this to him?Where the wall had been facing him there was a very large and ragged hole which extended beneath the level of the cell floor.All the ordure and garbage had burst out of that.The last few trickles hissed against the hot sides of the breach, producing steam which curled around the figure standing blocking most of the brilliant light from outside, in the open air of Sorpen.The figure was three metres tall and looked vaguely like a small armoured spaceship sitting on a tripod of thick legs.Its helmet looked big enough to contain three human heads, side by side.Held almost casually in one gigantic hand was a plasma cannon which Horza would have needed both arms just to lift; the creature's other fist gripped a slightly larger gun.Behind it, nosing in towards the hole, came an Idiran gun platform, lit vividly by the light of explosions which Horza could now feel through the iron and stones he was attached to.He raised his head to the giant standing in the breach and tried to smile."Well," he croaked, then spluttered and spat, "you lot certainly took your time. "2.The Hand of God 137  Outside the palace, in the sharp cold of a winter's afternoon, the clear sky was full of what looked like glittering snow.Horza paused on the warshuttle's ramp and looked up and around.The sheer walls and slim towers of the prison palace echoed and reflected with the booms and flashes of continuing fire fights, while Idiran gun platforms cruised back and forth, firing occasionally.Around them on the stiffening breeze blew great clouds of chaff from anti laser mortars on the palace roof.A gust sent some of the fluttering, flickering foil towards the stationary shuttle, and Horza found one side of his wet and sticky body suddenly coated with reflecting plumage."Please.The battle is not over yet," thundered the Idiran soldier behind him, in what was probably meant to be a quiet whisper.Horza turned round to the armoured bulk and stared up at the visor of the giant's helmet, where he could see his own, old man's face reflected.He breathed deeply, then nodded, turned and walked, slightly shakily, into the shuttle.A flash of light threw his shadow diagonally in front of him, and the craft bucked in the shock wave of a big explosion somewhere inside the palace as the ramp closed.By their names you could know them, Horza thought as he showered.The Culture's General Contact Units, which until now had borne the brunt of the first four years of the war in space, had always chosen jokey, facetious names.Even the new warships they were starting to produce, as their factory craft completed gearing up their war production, favoured either jocular, sombre or downright unpleasant names, as though the Culture could not take entirely seriously the vast conflict in which it had embroiled itself.The Idirans looked at things differently.To them a ship name ought to reflect the serious nature of its purpose, duties and resolute use.In the huge Idiran navy there were hundreds of craft named after the same heroes, planets, battles, religious concepts and impressive adjectives.The light cruiser which had rescued Horza was the 137th vessel to be called The Hand of God, and it existed concurrently with over a hundred other craft in the navy using the same title, so its full name was The Hand of God 137.Horza dried in the airstream with some difficulty.Like everything else in the spaceship it was built on a monumental scale befitting the size of the Idirans, and the hurricane of air it produced nearly blew him out of the shower cabinet.The Querl Xoralundra, spy father and warrior priest of the Four Souls tributory sect of Farn Idir, clasped two hands on the surface of the table.It looked to Horza rather like a pair of continental plates colliding."So, Bora Horza," boomed the old Idiran, "you are recovered. ""Just about," nodded Horza, rubbing his wrists.He sat in Xoralundra's cabin in The Hand of God 137, clothed in a bulky but comfortable space suit apparently brought along just for him.Xoralundra, who was also suited up, had insisted the man wear it because the warship was still at battle stations as it swept a fast and low powered orbit around the planet of Sorpen.A Culture GCU of the Mountain class had been confirmed in the system by Naval Intelligence; the Hand was in on its own, and they couldn't find any trace of the Culture ship, so they had to be careful.Xoralundra leaned towards Horza, casting a shadow over the table.His huge head, saddle shaped when seen from directly in front, with the two front eyes clear and unblinking near the edges, loomed over the Changer."You were lucky, Horza.We did not come in to rescue you out of compassion.Failure is its own reward. ""Thank you, Xora.That's actually the nicest thing anybody's said to me all day. "Horza sat back in his seat and put one of his old looking hands through his thin, yellowing hair.It would take a few days for the aged appearance he had assumed to disappear, though already he could feel it starting to slip away from him.In a Changer's mind there was a self image constantly held and reviewed on a semi subconscious level, keeping the body in the appearance willed.Horza's need to look like a Gerontocrat was gone now, so the mental picture of the minister he had impersonated for the Idirans was fragmenting and dissolving, and his body was going back to its normal, neutral state.Xoralundra's head went slowly from side to side between the edges of the suit collar.It was a gesture Horza had never fully translated, although he had worked for the Idirans and known Xoralundra well since before the war."Anyway.You are alive," Xoralundra said.Horza nodded and drummed his fingers on the table to show he agreed.He wished the Idiran chair he was perched on didn't make him feel so much like a child; his feet weren't even touching the deck."Just.Thanks, anyway.I'm sorry I dragged you all the way in here to rescue a failure. ""Orders are orders.I personally am glad we were able to.Now I must tell you why we received those orders. "Horza smiled and looked away from the old Idiran, who had just given him something of a compliment; a rare thing.He looked back and watched the other being's wide mouth  big enough, thought Horza, to bite off both your hands at once  as it boomed out the precise, short words of the Idiran language."You were once with a caretaker mission on Schar's World, one of the Dra'Azon Planets of the Dead," Xoralundra stated.Horza nodded."We need you to go back there. ""Now?"Horza said to the broad, dark face of the Idiran."There are only Changers there.I've told you I won't impersonate another Changer.I certainly won't kill one. ""We are not asking you to do that.Listen while I explain. "Xoralundra leant on his back rest in a way almost any vertebrate  or even anything like a vertebrate  would have called tired."Four standard days ago," the Idiran began  then his suit helmet, which was lying on the floor near his feet, let out a piercing whine.He picked up the helmet and set it on the table."Yes?"he said, and Horza knew enough about the Idiran voice to realise that whoever was bothering the Querl had better have a good reason for doing so."We have the Culture female," a voice said from the helmet."Ahh" Xoralundra said quietly, sitting back.The Idiran equivalent of a smile  mouth pursing, eyes narrowing  passed over his features."Good, Captain.Is she aboard yet?""No, Querl.The shuttle is a couple of minutes out.I'm withdrawing the gun platforms.We are ready to leave the system as soon as they are all on board. "Xoralundra bent closer to the helmet.Horza inspected the aged skin on the back of his hands."What of the Culture ship?"the Idiran asked."Still nothing, Querl.It cannot be anywhere in the system.Our computer suggests it is outside, possibly between us and the fleet.Before long it must realise we are in here by ourselves. ""You will set off to rejoin the fleet the instant the female Culture agent is aboard, without waiting for the platforms.Is that understood, Captain?"Xoralundra looked at Horza as the human glanced at him."Is that understood, Captain?"the Querl repeated, still looking at the human."Yes, Querl," came the answer.Horza could hear the icy tone, even through the small helmet speaker."Good.Use your own initiative to decide the best route back to the fleet.In the meantime you will destroy the cities of De'aychanbie, Vinch, Easna Yowon, Izilere and Ylbar with fusion bombs, as per the Admiralty's orders. ""Yes, Qu " Xoralundra stabbed a switch in the helmet, and it fell silent."You got Balveda?"Horza asked, surprised."We have the Culture agent, yes.I regard her capture, or destruction, as of comparatively little consequence.But only by our assuring the Admiralty we would attempt to take her would they contemplate such a hazardous mission ahead of the main fleet to rescue you. ""Hmm.Bet you didn't get Balveda's knife missile. "Horza snorted, looking again at the wrinkles on his hands."It destructed while you were being put aboard the shuttle which brought you up to the ship. "Xoralundra waved one hand, sending a draught of Idiran scented air across the table."But enough of that.I must explain why we risked a light cruiser to rescue you. ""By all means," Horza said, and turned to face the Idiran."Four standard days ago," the Querl said, "a group of our ships intercepted a single Culture craft of conventional outward appearance but rather odd internal construction, judging by its emission signature.The ship was destroyed easily enough, but its Mind escaped.There was a planetary system near by.The Mind appears to have transcended real space to within the planetary surface of the globe it chose, thus indicating a level of hyperspatial field management we had thought  hoped  was still beyond the Culture.Certainly such spaciobatics are beyond us for the moment.We have reason to believe, due to that and other indications, that the Mind involved is one from a new class of General Systems Vehicles the Culture is developing.The Mind's capture would be an intelligence coup of the first order. "The Querl paused there.Horza took the opportunity to ask, "Is this thing on Schar's World?""Yes.According to its last message it intended to shelter in the tunnels of the Command System. ""And you can't do anything about it?"Horza smiled."We came to get you.That is doing something about it, Bora Horza. "The Querl paused."The shape of your mouth tells me you see something amusing in this situation.What would that be?""I was just thinking lots of things: that that Mind was either pretty smart or very lucky; that you were very lucky you had me close by; also that the Culture isn't likely to sit back and do nothing. ""To deal with your points in order," Xoralundra said sharply, "the Culture Mind was both lucky and smart; we were fortunate; the Culture can do little because they do not, as far as we know, have any Changers in their employ, and certainly not one who has served on Schar's World.I would also add, Bora Horza," the Idiran said, putting both huge hands on the table and dipping his great head towards the human, "that you were more than a little lucky yourself. ""Ah yes, but the difference is that I believe in it. "Horza grinned."Hmm.It does you little credit," observed the Querl.Horza shrugged."So you want me to put down on Schar's World and get the Mind?""If possible.It may be damaged.It may be liable to destruct, but it is a prize worth fighting for.We shall give you all the equipment you need, but your presence alone would give us a toe hold. ""What about the people already there?The Changers on caretaker duty?""Nothing has been heard from them.They were probably unaware of the Mind's arrival.Their next routine transmission is due in a few days, but, given the current disruption in communications due to the war, they may not be able to send. ""What" Horza said slowly, one finger describing a circular pattern on the table surface which he was looking at, " do you know about the personnel in the base?""The two senior members have been replaced by younger Changers," the Idiran said."The two junior sentinels became seniors, remaining there. ""They wouldn't be in any danger, would they?"Horza asked."On the contrary.Inside a Dra'Azon Quiet Barrier, on a Planet of the Dead, must rank as one of the safest places to be during the current hostilities.Neither we nor the Culture can risk causing the Dra'Azon any offence.That is why they cannot do anything, and we can only use you. ""If," Horza said carefully, sitting forward and dropping his voice slightly, "I can get this metaphysical computer for you "  "Something in your voice tells me we approach the question of remuneration," Xoralundra said."We do indeed.I've risked my neck for you lot long enough, Xoralundra.I want out.There's a good friend of mine on that Schar's World base, and if she's agreeable I want to take her and me out of the whole war.That's what I'm asking for. ""I can promise nothing.I shall request this.Your long and devoted service will be taken into account. "Horza sat back and frowned.He wasn't sure if Xoralundra was being ironic or not.Six years probably didn't seem like very long at all to a species that was virtually immortal; but the Querl Xoralundra knew how often his frail human charge had risked all in the service of his alien masters, without real reward, so perhaps he was being serious.Before Horza could continue with the bargaining, the helmet shrilled once more.Horza winced.All the noises on the Idiran ship seemed to be deafening.The voices were thunder; ordinary buzzers and bleepers left his ears ringing long after they stopped; and announcements over the PA made him put both hands to his head.Horza just hoped there wasn't a full scale alarm while he was on board.The Idiran ship alarm could cause damage to unprotected human ears."What is it?"Xoralundra asked the helmet."The female is on board.I shall need only eight more minutes to get the gun "  "Have the cities been destroyed?"" They have, Querl. ""Break out of orbit at once and make full speed for the fleet. ""Querl, I must point out " said the small, steady voice from the helmet on the table."Captain," Xoralundra said briskly, "in this war there have to date been fourteen single duel engagements between Type 5 light cruisers and Mountain class General Contact Units.All have ended in victory for the enemy.Have you ever seen what is left of a light cruiser after a GCU has finished with it?""No, Querl. ""Neither have I, and I have no intention of seeing it for the first time from the inside.Proceed at once. "Xoralundra hit the helmet button again.He fastened his gaze on Horza."I shall do what I can to secure your release from the service with sufficient funds, if you succeed.Now, once we have made contact with the main body of the fleet you will go by fast picket to Schar's World.You will be given a shuttle there, just beyond the Quiet Barrier.It will be unarmed, although it will have the equipment we think you may need, including some close range hyperspace spectographic analysers, should the Mind conduct a limited destruct. ""How can you be certain it'll be "limited"?"Horza asked sceptically."The Mind weighs several thousand tonnes, despite its relatively small size.An annihilatory destruct would rip the planet in half and so antagonise the Dra'Azon.No Culture Mind would risk such a thing. ""Your confidence overwhelms me," Horza said dourly.Just then the note of background noise around them altered.Xoralundra turned his helmet round and looked at one of its small internal screens."Good.We are under way. "He looked at Horza again."There is something else I ought to tell you.An attempt was made, by the group of ships which caught the Culture craft, to follow the escaped Mind down to the planet. "Horza frowned."Didn't they know better?""They did their best.With the battle group were several captured chuy hirtsi warp animals which had been deactivated for later use in a surprise attack on a Culture base.One of these was quickly fitted out for a small scale incursion on the planet surface and thrown at the Quiet Barrier in a warp cruise.The ruse did not succeed.On crossing the Barrier the animal was attacked with something resembling gridfire and was heavily damaged.It came out of warp near the planet on a course which would take it in on a burn up angle.The equipment and ground force it contained must be considered defunct. ""Well, I suppose it was a good try, but a Dra'Azon must make even this wonderful Mind you're after look like a valve computer.It's going to take more than that to fool it. ""Do you think you will be able to?""I don't know.I don't think they can read minds, but who knows?I don't think the Dra'Azon even know or care much about the war or what I've been doing since I left Schar's World.So they probably won't be able to put one and one together  but again, who knows?"Horza gave another shrug."It's worth a try. ""Good.We shall have a fuller briefing when we rejoin the fleet.For now we must pray that our return is without incident.You may want to speak to Perosteck Balveda before she is interrogated.I have arranged with the Deputy Fleet Inquisitor that you may see her, if you wish. "Horza smiled, "Xora, nothing would give me greater pleasure. "The Querl had other business on the ship as it powered its way out of the Sorpen system.Horza stayed in Xoralundra's cabin to rest and eat before he called on Balveda.The food was the cruiser autogalley's best impression of something suitable for a humanoid, but it tasted awful.Horza ate what he could and drank some equally uninspiring distilled water.It was all served by a medjel  a lizard like creature about two metres long with a flat, long head and six legs, on four of which it ran, using the front pair as hands.The medjel were the companion species of the Idirans.It was a complicated sort of social symbiosis which had kept the exosocio faculties of many a university in research funds over the millennia that the Idiran civilisation had been part of the galactic community.The Idirans themselves had evolved on their planet Idir as the top monster from a whole planetful of monsters.The frenetic and savage ecology of Idir in its early days had long since disappeared, and so had all the other homeworld monsters except those in zoos.But the Idirans had retained the intelligence that made them winners, as well as the biological immortality which, due to the viciousness of the fight for survival back then  not to mention Idir's high radiation levels had been an evolutionary advantage rather than a recipe for stagnation.Horza thanked the medjel as it brought him plates and took them away again, but it said nothing.They were generally reckoned to be about two thirds as intelligent as the average humanoid (whatever that was), which made them about two or three times dimmer than a normal Idiran.Still, they were good if unimaginative soldiers, and there were plenty of them; something like ten or twelve for each Idiran.Forty thousand years of breeding had made them loyal right down to the chromosome level.Horza didn't try to sleep, though he was tired.He told the medjel to take him to Balveda.The medjel thought about it, asked permission via the cabin intercom, and flinched visibly under a verbal slap from a distant Xoralundra who was on the bridge with the cruiser captain."Follow me, sir," the medjel said, opening the cabin door.In the companionways of the warship the Idiran atmosphere became more obvious than it had been in Xoralundra's cabin.The smell of Idiran was stronger and the view ahead hazed over  even seen through Horza's eyes  after a few tens of metres.It was hot and humid, and the floor was soft.Horza walked quickly along the corridor, watching the stump of the medjel's docked tail as it waggled in front of him.He passed two Idirans on the way, neither of whom paid him any attention.Perhaps they knew all about him and what he was, but perhaps not.Horza knew that Idirans hated to appear either over inquisitive or under informed.He nearly collided with a pair of wounded medjel on AG stretchers being hurried along a cross corridor by two of their fellow troopers.Horza watched as the wounded passed, and frowned.The spiralled spatter marks on their battle armour were unmistakably those produced by a plasma bolt, and the Gerontocracy didn't have any plasma weapons.He shrugged and walked on.They came to a section of the cruiser where the companionway was blocked by sliding doors.The medjel spoke to each of the barriers in turn, and they opened.An Idiran guard holding a laser carbine stood outside a door; he saw the medjel and Horza approaching and had the door open for the man by the time he got there.Horza nodded to the guard as he stepped through.The door hissed shut behind him and another one, immediately in front, opened.Balveda turned quickly to him when he entered the cell.It looked as though she had been pacing up and down.She threw back her head a little when she saw Horza and made a noise in her throat which might have been a laugh."Well, well," she said, her soft voice drawling."You survived.Congratulations.I did keep my promise, by the way.What a turn around, eh?""Hello," Horza replied, folding his arms across the chest of his suit and looking the woman up and down.She wore the same grey gown and appeared to be unharmed."What happened to that thing around your neck?"Horza asked.She looked down, at where the pendant had lain over her breast."Well, believe it or not, it turned out to be a memoryform. "She smiled at him and sat down cross legged on the soft floor; apart from a raised bed alcove, this was the only place to sit.Horza sat too, his legs hurting only a little.He recalled the spatter marks on the medjel's armour."A memoryform.Wouldn't have turned into a plasma gun, by any chance, would it?""Amongst other things. "The Culture agent nodded."Thought so.Heard your knife missile took the expansive way out. "Balveda shrugged.Horza looked her in the eye and said, "I don't suppose you'd be here if you had anything important you could tell them, would you?""Here, perhaps," Balveda conceded."Alive, no. "She stretched her arms out behind her and sighed."I suppose I'll have to sit out the war in an internment camp, unless they can find somebody to swap.I just hope this thing doesn't go on too long. ""Oh, you think the Culture might give in soon?"Horza grinned."No, I think the Culture might win soon. ""You must be mad. "Horza shook his head."Well" Balveda said, nodding ruefully, "actually I think it'll win eventually. ""If you keep falling back like you have for the last three years, you'll end up somewhere in the Clouds. ""I'm not giving away any secrets, Horza, but I think you might find we don't do too much more falling back. ""We'll see.Frankly I'm surprised you kept fighting this long. ""So are our three legged friends.So is everybody.So are we, I sometimes think. ""Balveda," Horza sighed wearily, "I still don't know why the hell you're fighting in the first place.The Idirans never were any threat to you.They still wouldn't be, if you stopped fighting them.Did life in your great Utopia really get so boring you needed a war?""Horza," Balveda said, leaning forward, "I don't understand why you are fighting.I know Heidohre is in "  "Heibohre," Horza interjected."OK, the goddamn asteroid the Changers live in.I know it's in Idiran space, but "  "That's got nothing to do with it, Balveda.I'm fighting for them because I think they're right and you're wrong. "Balveda sat back, amazed."You" she began, then lowered her head and shook it, staring at the floor.She looked up."I really don't understand you, Horza.You must know how many species, how many civilisations, how many systems, how many individuals have been either destroyed or throttled by the Idirans and their crazy goddamned religion.What the hell has the Culture ever done compared to that?"One hand was on her knee, the other was displayed in front of Horza, clawed into a strangling grip.He watched her and smiled."On a straight head count the Idirans no doubt do come out in front, Perosteck, and I've told them I never did care for some of their methods, or their zeal.I'm all for people being allowed to live their own lives.But now they're up against you lot, and that's what makes the difference to me.Because I'm against you, rather than for them, I'm prepared " Horza broke off for a moment, laughing lightly, self consciously. "Well, it sounds a bit melodramatic, but sure  I'm prepared to die for them. "He shrugged."Simple as that. "Horza nodded as he said it, and Balveda dropped the outstretched hand and looked away to one side, shaking her head and exhaling loudly.Horza went on, "Because well, I suppose you thought I was just kidding when I was telling old Frolk I thought the knife missile was the real representative.I wasn't kidding, Balveda.I meant it then and I mean it now.I don't care how self righteous the Culture feels, or how many people the Idirans kill.They're on the side of life  boring, old fashioned, biological life; smelly, fallible and short sighted, God knows, but real life.You're ruled by your machines.You're an evolutionary dead end.The trouble is that to take your mind off it you try to drag everybody else down there with you.The worst thing that could happen to the galaxy would be if the Culture wins this war. "He paused to let her say something, but she was still sitting with her head down, shaking it.He laughed at her."You know, Balveda, for such a sensitive species you show remarkably little empathy at times. ""Empathise with stupidity and you're halfway to thinking like an idiot," muttered the woman, still not looking at Horza.He laughed again and got to his feet."Such bitterness, Balveda," he said.She looked up at him."I'll tell you, Horza," she said quietly, "we're going to win. "He shook his head."I don't think so.You wouldn't know how to. "Balveda sat back again, hands spread behind her.Her face was serious."We can learn, Horza. ""Who from?""Whoever has the lesson there to teach," she said slowly."We spend quite a lot of our time watching warriors and zealots, bullies and militarists  people determined to win regardless.There's no shortage of teachers. ""If you want to know about winning, ask the Idirans. "Balveda said nothing for a moment.Her face was calm, thoughtful, perhaps sad.She nodded after a while."They do say there's a danger in warfare," she said, "that you'll start to resemble the enemy. "She shrugged."We just have to hope that we can avoid that.If the evolutionary force you seem to believe in really works, then it'll work through us, and not the Idirans.If you're wrong, then it deserves to be superseded. ""Balveda," he said, laughing lightly, "don't disappoint me.I prefer a fight You almost sound as though you're coming round to my point of view. ""No," she sighed."I'm not.Blame it on my Special Circumstances training.We try to think of everything.I was being pessimistic. ""I'd got the impression SC didn't allow such thoughts. ""Then think again, Mr Changer," Balveda said, arching one eyebrow."SC allows all thoughts.That's what some people find so frightening about it. "Horza thought he knew what the woman meant.Special Circumstances had always been the Contact section's moral espionage weapon, the very cutting edge of the Culture's interfering diplomatic policy, the elite of the elite, in a society which abhorred elitism.Even before the war, its standing and its image within the Culture had been ambiguous.It was glamorous but dangerous, possessed of an aura of roguish sexiness  there was no other word for it  which implied predation, seduction, even violation.It had about it too an atmosphere of secrecy (in a society that virtually worshipped openness) which hinted at unpleasant, shaming deeds, and an ambience of moral relativity (in a society which clung to its absolutes: life/good, death/bad; pleasure/good, pain/bad) which attracted and repulsed at once, but anyway excited.No other part of the Culture more exactly represented what the society as a whole really stood for, or was more militant in the application of the Culture's fundamental beliefs.Yet no other part embodied less of the society's day to day character.With war, Contact had become the Culture's military, and Special Circumstances its intelligence and espionage section (the euphemism became only a little more obvious, that was all).And with war, SC's position within the Culture changed, for the worse.It became the repository for the guilt the people in the Culture experienced because they had agreed to go to war in the first place: despised as a necessary evil, reviled as an unpleasant moral compromise, dismissed as something people preferred not to think about.SC really did try to think of everything, though, and its Minds were reputedly even more cynical, amoral and downright sneaky than those which made up Contact; machines without illusions which prided themselves on thinking the thinkable to its ultimate extremities.So it had been wearily predicted that just this would happen.SC would become a pariah, a whipping child, and its reputation a gland to absorb the poison in the Culture's conscience.But Horza guessed that knowing all this didn't make it any easier for somebody like Balveda.Culture people had little stomach for being disliked by anybody, least of all their fellow citizens, and the woman's task was difficult enough without the added burden of knowing she was even greater anathema to most of her own side than she was to the enemy."Well, whatever, Balveda," he said, stretching.He flexed his stiff shoulders within the suit, pulled his fingers through his thin, yellow white hair."I guess it'll work itself out. "Balveda laughed mirthlessly."Never a truer word" She shook her head."Thanks, anyway," he told her."For what?""I think you just reinforced my faith in the ultimate outcome of this war. ""Oh, just go away, Horza. "Balveda sighed and looked down to the floor.Horza wanted to touch her, to ruffle her short black hair or pinch her pale cheek, but guessed it would only upset her more.He knew too well the bitterness of defeat to want to aggravate the experience for somebody who was, in the end, a fair and honourable adversary.He went to the door, and after a word with the guard outside he was let out."Ah, Bora Horza," Xoralundra said as the human appeared out of the cell doorway.The Querl came striding along the companionway.The guard outside the cell straightened visibly and blew some imaginary dust off his carbine."How is our guest?""Not very happy.We were trading justifications and I think I won on points. "Horza grinned.Xoralundra stopped by the man and looked down."Hmm.Well, unless you prefer to relish your victories in a vacuum, I suggest that the next time you leave my cabin while we are at battle stations you take your "  Horza didn't hear the next word.The ship's alarm erupted.The Idiran alarm signal, on a warship as elsewhere, consists of what sounds like a series of very sharp explosions.It is the amplified version of the Idiran chest boom, an evolved signal the Idirans had been using to warn others in their herd or clan for several hundred thousand years before they became civilised, and produced by the chest flap which is the Idiran vestigial third arm.Horza clapped his hands to his ears, trying to shut out the awful noise.He could feel the shock waves on his chest, through the open neck of the suit.He felt himself being picked up and forced against the bulkhead.It was only then that he realised he had shut his eyes.For a second he thought he had never been rescued, never left the wall of the sewercell, that this was the moment of his death and all the rest had been a strange and vivid dream.He opened his eyes and found himself staring into the keratinous snout of the Querl Xoralundra, who shook him furiously and, just as the ship alarm cut off and was replaced by a merely painfully intense whine, said very loudly into Horza's face, "HELMET!""Oh shit!"said Horza.He was dropped to the deck as Xoralundra let him go, turned quickly, and scooped a running medjel off the floor as it tried to get past him."You!"Xoralundra bellowed."I am the spy father Querl of the fleet," he shouted into its face and shook the six limbed creature by the front of its suit."You will go to my cabin immediately and bring the small space helmet lying there to the port side stem emergency lock.As fast as possible.This order supersedes all others and cannot be countermanded.Go!"He threw the medjel in the right direction.It landed running.Xoralundra flipped his own helmet over from its back hinged position, then opened the visor.He looked as though he was about to say something to Horza, but the helmet speaker crackled and spoke, and the Querl's expression changed.The small noise stopped and only the continuing wail of the cruiser's alarm was left."The Culture craft was hiding in the surface layers of the system sun," Xoralundra said bitterly, more to himself than to Horza."In the sun?"Horza was incredulous.He looked back at the cell door, as though somehow it was Balveda's fault."Those bastards are getting smarter all the time. ""Yes," snapped the Querl, then turned quickly on one foot."Follow me, human. "Horza obeyed, starting after the old Idiran at a run, then bumping into him as the huge figure stopped in its tracks.Horza watched the broad, dark, alien face as it swivelled round to look over his head at the Idiran trooper still standing stiffly at the cell door.An expression Horza could not read passed over Xoralundra's face."Guard," the Querl said, not loudly.The trooper with the laser carbine turned."Kill the woman. "Xoralundra stamped off down the corridor.Horza stood for a moment, looking first at the rapidly receding Querl, then at the guard as he checked his carbine, ordered the cell door to open, and stepped inside.Then the man ran down the corridor after the old Idiran."Querl!"gasped the medjel as it skidded to a stop by the airlock, the suit helmet held in front of it.Xoralundra swept the helmet from its grasp and fitted it quickly over Horza's head."You will find a warp attachment in the lock," the Idiran told Horza."Get as far away as possible.The fleet will be here in about nine standard hours.You shouldn't have to do anything; the suit will summon help on a coded IFF response.I, too " Xoralundra broke off as the cruiser lurched.There was a loud bang and Horza was blown off his feet by a shock wave, while the Idiran on his tripod of legs hardly moved.The medjel which had gone for the helmet yelped as it was blown under Xoralundra's legs.The Idiran swore and kicked at it; it ran off; The cruiser lurched again as other alarms started.Horza could smell burning.A confused medley of noises that might have been Idiran voices or muffled explosions came from somewhere overhead."I too shall try to escape," Xoralundra continued."God be with you, human. "Before Horza could say anything the Idiran had rammed his visor down and pushed him into the lock.It slammed shut.Horza was thrown against one bulkhead as the cruiser juddered mightily.He looked desperately round the small, spherical space for a warp unit, then saw it and after a short struggle unclamped it from its wall magnets.He clamped it to the rear of his suit."Ready?"a voice said in his ear.Horza jumped, then said, "Yes!Yes!Hit it!"The airlock didn't open conventionally; it turned inside out and threw him into space, tumbling away from the flat disc of the cruiser in a tiny galaxy of ice particles.He looked for the Culture ship, then told himself not to be stupid; it was probably still several trillion kilometres away.That was how divorced from the human scale modern warfare had become.You could smash and destroy from unthinkable distances, obliterate planets from beyond their own system and provoke stars into novae from light years off and still have no good idea why you were really fighting.With one last thought for Balveda, Horza reached until he found the control handle for the bulky warp unit, fingered the correct buttons on it, and watched the stars twist and distort around him as the unit sent him and his suit lancing away from the stricken Idiran spacecraft.He played with the wrist set for a while, trying to pick up signals from The Hand of God 137, but got nothing but static.The suit spoke to him once, saying "Warp/unit/charge/half/exhausted. "Horza kept a watch on the warp unit via a small screen set inside the helmet.He recalled that the Idirans said some sort of prayer to their God before going into warp.Once when he had been with Xoralundra on a ship which was warping, the Querl had insisted that the Changer repeat the prayer, too.Horza had protested that it meant nothing to him; not only did the Idiran God clash with his own personal convictions, the prayer itself was in a dead Idiran language he didn't understand.He had been told rather coldly that it was the gesture that mattered.For what the Idirans regarded as essentially an animal (their word for humanoids was best translated as "biotomaton'), only the behaviour of devotion was required; his heart and mind were of no consequence.When Horza had asked, what about his immortal soul?Xoralundra had laughed.It was the first and only time Horza had experienced such a thing from the old warrior.Whoever heard of a mortal body having an immortal soul?When the warp unit was almost exhausted, Horza shut it off.Stars swam into focus around him.He set the unit controls, then threw it away from him.They parted company, he moving slowly off in one direction, while the unit spun off in another; then it disappeared as the controls switched it back on again to use the last of its power leading anybody following its trace away in the wrong direction.He calmed his breathing down gradually; it had been very fast and hard for a while, but he slowed it and his heart deliberately.He accustomed himself to the suit, testing its functions and powers.It smelled and felt new, and looked like a Rairch built device.Rairch suits were meant to be among the best.People said the Culture made better ones, but people said the Culture made better everything, and they were still losing the war.Horza checked out the lasers the suit had built in and searched for the concealed pistol he knew it ought to carry.He found it at last, disguised as part of the left forearm casing, a small plasma hand gun.He felt like shooting it at something, but there was nothing to aim at.He put it back.He folded his arms across his bulky chest and looked around.Stars were everywhere.He had no idea which one was Sorpen's.So the Culture ships could hide in the photospheres of stars, could they?And a Mind  even if it was desperate and on the run  could jump through the bottom of a gravity well, could it?Maybe the Idirans would have a tougher job than they expected.They were the natural warriors, they had the experience and the guts, and their whole society was geared for continual conflict.But the Culture, that seemingly disunited, anarchic, hedonistic, decadent melange of more or less human species, forever hiving off or absorbing different groups of people, had fought for almost four years without showing any sign of giving up or even coming to a compromise.What everybody had expected to be at best a brief, limited stand, lasting just long enough to make a point, had developed into a wholehearted war effort.The early reverses and first few megadeaths had not, as the pundits and experts had predicted, shocked the Culture into retiring, horrified at the brutalities of war but proud to have put its collective life where usually only its collective mouth was.Instead it had just kept on retreating and retreating, preparing, gearing up and planning.Horza was convinced the Minds were behind it all.He could not believe the ordinary people in the Culture really wanted the war, no matter how they had voted.They had their communist Utopia.They were soft and pampered and indulged, and the Contact section's evangelical materialism provided their conscience salving good works.What more could they want?The war had to be the Minds" idea; it was part of their clinical drive to clean up the galaxy, make it run on nice, efficient lines, without waste, injustice or suffering.The fools in the Culture couldn't see that one day the Minds would start thinking how wasteful and inefficient the humans in the Culture themselves were.Horza used the suit's internal gyros to steer himself, letting him look at every part of the sky, wondering where, in that light flecked emptiness, battles raged and billions died, where the Culture still held and the Idiran battle fleets pressed.The suit hummed and clicked and hissed very quietly around him: precise, obedient, reassuring.Suddenly it jolted, steadying him without warning and jarring his teeth.A noise uncomfortably like a collision alarm trilled violently in one ear, and out of the corner of his eye Horza could see a microscreen set inside the helmet near his left cheek light up with a holo red graph display."Target/acquisition/radar," the suit said."Incoming/increasing. "3.Clean Air Turbulence  "What!"roared Horza."Target/acqui " the suit began again."Oh shut up!"Horza shouted, and started punching buttons on the suit's wrist console, twisting this way and that, scanning the darkness around him.There ought to have been a way of getting a head up display on the inside of the helmet visor to show him what direction the signals were coming from, but he hadn't enough time to familiarise himself completely with the suit, and he couldn't find the right button.Then he realised he could probably just ask."Suit!Give me a head up on the transmission source!"The top left edge of the visor flashed.He turned and tipped until a winking red dot positioned itself on the transparent surface.He hit the wrist buttons again, and the suit hissed as it evacuated gas from its sole nozzles, sending him shooting away under about one gravity.Nothing appeared to change apart from his weight, but the red light went out briefly, then came back on.He swore.The suit said:  "Target/acquisition "  "I know," Horza told it.He unslung the plasma pistol from his arm and readied the suit lasers.He cut the gas jets, too.Whatever it was coming after him, he doubted he'd be able to outrun it.He became weightless again.The small red light continued to flash on the visor.He watched the internal screens.The transmission source was closing on a curved course at about point zero one lights, in real space.The radar was low frequency and not particularly powerful  all too low tech to be either the Culture or the Idirans.He told the suit to cancel the head up, brought the magnifiers down from the top of the visor and switched them on, aiming at where the radar source had been coming from.A doppler shift in the signal, still displayed on one of the helmet's small internal screens, announced that whatever was producing the transmission was slowing down.Was he going to be picked up rather than blown apart?Something glinted hazily in the magnifiers" field.The radar switched off.It was very close now.He felt his mouth go dry, and his hands shook inside the heavy gloves of the suit.The image in the magnifiers seemed to explode with darkness, then he swept them back to the top of the helmet and looked out into the starfields and the inky night.Something tore across his vision, pure black, racing across the backdrop of sky in utter silence.He jabbed at the button which switched on the suit's needle radar and tried to follow the shape as it passed him, occluding stars; but he missed, so there was no way of telling how close it had come, or how big it was.He had lost track of it in the spaces between the stars when the darkness ahead of him flared.He guessed it was turning.Sure enough, back came the radar pulse."Ta "  "Quiet," Horza said, checking the plasma gun.The dark shape expanded, almost directly ahead.The stars around it wobbled and brightened in the lens effect of an imperfectly adjusted warp motor in cancel mode.Horza watched the shape come closer.The radar switched off again.He switched his own back on, the needle beam scanning the craft ahead.He was looking at the resulting image on an internal screen when it flickered and went out, the suit's hissings and hummings stopped, and the stars started to fade away."Sapping/effector/fi re" said the suit, as it and Horza went limp and unconscious.There was something hard under him.His head hurt.He couldn't remember where he was or what he was supposed to be doing.He only just remembered his name.Bora Horza Gobuchul, Changer from the asteroid Heibohre, lately employed by the Idirans in their holy war against the Culture.How did that connect with the pain in his skull though, and the hard, cold metal under his cheek?He had been hit hard.While he still couldn't see or hear or smell anything, he knew something severe had occurred, something almost fatal.He tried to remember what had happened.Where had he been last?What had he been doing?The Hand of God 137!His heart leapt as he remembered.He had to get off!Where was his helmet?Why had Xoralundra deserted him?Where was that stupid medjel with his helmet?Help!He found he couldn't move.Anyway, it wasn't The Hand of God 137, or any Idiran ship.The deck was hard and cold, if it was a deck, and the air smelled wrong.He could hear people talking now, too.But still no sight.He didn't know if his eyes were open and he was blind, or if they were shut and he couldn't open them.He tried to bring his hands up to his face to find out, but nothing would move.The voices were human.There were several.They were speaking the Culture's language, Marain, but that didn't mean much; it had grown increasingly common as a second language in the galaxy over the last few millennia.Horza could speak and understand it, though he hadn't used it since since he had talked to Balveda, in fact, but before that not for a long time.Poor Balveda.But these people were chattering, and he couldn't make out the individual words.He tried to move his eyelids, and eventually felt something.He still couldn't think where he might be.All this darkness Then he remembered something about being in a suit, and a voice talking to him about targets or something.With a shock he realised he had been captured, or rescued.He forgot about trying to open his eyes and concentrated hard on understanding what the people near by were saying.He had used Marain just recently; he could do it.He had to.He had to know.   "goddamn system for two weeks and all we get is some old guy in a suit. "That was one voice.Female, he thought."What the hell did you expect, a Culture starship?"Male."Well, shit, a bit of one. "The female voice again.Some laughter."It's a good suit.Riarch, by the look of it.Think I'll have it. "Another male voice.Tone of command; no mistaking it.   ""No good.Too quiet."They adjust, idiot. "The Man again.   "bits of Idiran and Culture ships would be floating all over the place and we could that bow laser and it's still fucked. "Woman, different one."Our effector won't have damaged it, will it?"Another male; young sounding, cutting across what the woman had said."It was on suck, not blow," the captain said, or whatever he was.Who were these people?  "of a lot less than grandad over there," said one of the men.Him!They were talking about him!He tried not to show any sign of life.He only now realised that of course he was out of the suit, lying a few metres away from people probably standing around it, some with their backs to him.He was lying with one arm underneath his body, on his side, naked, facing them.His head still hurt and he could feel saliva dribbling from his half open mouth.   "weapon of some sort with them.Can't see it, though," said the Man, and his voice altered, as though he was changing position as he spoke.Sounded like they had lost the plasma gun.They were mercenaries.Had to be.Privateers."Can I have your old suit, Kraiklyn?"Young male."Well, that's that," the Man said, his voice sounding as though he was getting up from a squatting position, or turning round.It seemed he had ignored the previous speaker."A bit of a disappointment maybe, but we did get this suit.Better get out now before the big boys show. ""What now?"One of the females again.Horza liked her voice.He wished he could get his eyes open."That temple.Should be easy meat, even without the bow laser.Only about ten days from here.We'll do a little bit more funding up on some of their altar treasures and then buy some heavy weaponry on Vavatch.We can all spend our ill gotten gains there. "The Man  Krakeline or whatever his name was  paused.He laughed."Doro, don't look so frightened.This'll be simple.You'll be thankful I heard about this place, once we're rich.The goddamn priests don't even carry weapons.It'll be easy "  "Easy out.Yeah, we know. "A woman's voice; the nice one.Horza was aware of light now.Pink in front of his eyes.His head was still sore but he was coming to.He checked out his body, consciously calling on the feedback nerves to gauge his own physical readiness.Below normal, and it wouldn't be perfect until the last effects of his geriatric appearance had faded away, in a few days  if he lived that long.He suspected they thought he was already dead."Zallin," the Man said, "dump that weed. "Horza opened his eyes with a start as footsteps approached.The Man had been talking about him!"Aah!"somebody cried nearby."He's not dead.His eyes are moving!"The footsteps suddenly halted.Horza sat up shakily, narrowing his eyes in the glare.He was breathing hard and his head swam as he raised it.His eyes focused.He was in a brightly lit but small hangar.An old, weather beaten shuttle craft filled about half of it.He was sitting almost against one bulkhead; near the other stood the people who had been talking.Halfway between him and the group stood a large, ungainly youth with very long arms and silver hair.As Horza had guessed, the suit he had been wearing lay prone on the floor at the feet of the group of humans.He swallowed and blinked.The youth with the silver hair stared at him and scratched nervously at one ear.He wore a pair of shorts and a frayed T shirt.He jumped when one of the taller men in the group, in the voice Horza had decided was that of the captain, said, "Wubslin," (he turned to one of the other men) "isn't that effector working properly?"Don't let them talk about you as though you aren't here!He cleared his throat and spoke as loudly and as determinedly as he could."There's nothing wrong with your effector. ""Then," the tall man said, smiling thinly and arching one eyebrow, "you should be dead. "They were all looking at him, most with suspicion.The youth near him was still scratching his ear; he appeared puzzled, even frightened, but the rest just looked as though they wanted rid of him as quickly as possible.They were all humans, or close to; male and female; mostly dressed in either suits or bits of suits, or T shirts and shorts.The captain, now moving through the group, closer to Horza, looked tall and muscular.He had a mass of dark hair combed back from his brow, a sallow complexion and something feral about his eyes and mouth.The voice suited him.As he came closer Horza saw that he was holding a laser pistol.The suit he wore was black, and its heavy boots rang on the naked metal deck.He advanced until he was level with the young man with the silver hair, who was fiddling with the hem of his T shirt and biting his lip."Why aren't you dead?"the Man asked Horza quietly."Because I'm a lot fucking tougher than I look," Horza said.The Man smiled and nodded."You must be. "He turned round and looked briefly back at the suit."What were you doing way out here in that?""I used to work for the Idirans.They didn't want the Culture ship to catch me, and they thought they might be able to rescue me later, so they threw me overboard to wait for the fleet.It'll be here in about eight or nine hours, by the way, so I wouldn't hang around. ""Will it, now?"the captain said quietly, raising his eyebrow again."You seem very well informed, old man. ""I'm not that old.This was a disguise for my last job  an agatic drug.It's wearing off.A couple of days and I'll be useful again. "The Man shook his head sadly."No you won't. "He turned and started back towards the other people."Dump him," he told the youth in the T shirt.The youth started forward."Now wait a goddamned minute!"Horza shouted, scrambling to his feet.He backed against the wall, hands out, but the youth was coming straight at him.The others were looking either at him or at their captain.Horza swung forward and up with one leg, too fast for the young man with the silver hair.He caught him in the groin with his foot.The youth gasped and fell to the deck, clutching at himself.The Man had turned.He looked down at the youth, then at Horza."Yes?"he said.Horza got the impression he was enjoying it all.Horza pointed to the now kneeling youth."I told you  I can be useful.I'm pretty good in a fight.You can have the suit "  "I've got the suit," the captain said drily."So at least give me a chance. "Horza looked around them."You're mercenaries or something, right?"Nobody said anything.He could feel himself starting to sweat; he stopped it."Let me join.All I'm asking for's a chance.If I louse up first time, dump me then. ""Why not dump you now and save the hassle?"The captain laughed, spreading his arms wide.Some of the others laughed too."A chance," Horza repeated."Shit, it isn't much to ask. ""I'm sorry. "The Man shook his head."We're overcrowded already. "The silver haired youth was looking up at Horza, his face twisted with pain and hate.The people in the group were smirking at Horza or talking quietly to each other and nodding at him, grinning.He was suddenly aware that he looked like just a skinny old man in the nude."Fuck it!"he spat, glaring right at the Man."Give me five days and I'll take you on anytime. "The captain's eyebrows went up.For a second he might have looked angry, then he burst out laughing.He waved the laser at Horza."All right, old man.I'll tell you what we'll do. "He put his hands on his waist and nodded at the youth still kneeling on the deck."You can fight Zallin here.You feel up to a rumble, Zallin?""I'll kill him," Zallin said, looking straight at Horza's throat.The Man laughed.Some of his black hair spilled out of the back lip of his suit."That's the idea. "He looked at Horza."I told you we're already overcrowded.You'll have to produce a vacancy. "He turned round to the others."Clear a space.And somebody get this old guy some shorts; he's putting me off my food. "One of the women threw Horza a pair of shorts.He put them on.The suit had been lifted from the deck, and the shuttle rolled a couple of metres sideways until it clanged against the hull on the far side of the hangar.Zallin had finally risen from the deck and gone back to the others.Somebody sprayed anaesthetic on his genitals.Thank goodness for non retractables, Horza thought.He was resting against the bulkhead, watching the group of people.Zallin was taller than any of them.His arms seemed to reach to his knees and they were as thick as Horza's thighs.Horza saw the captain nod towards him, and one of the women walked over.She had a small, hard looking face.Her skin was dark, and she had spiky fair hair.Her whole body looked slim and hard; she walked, Horza thought, like a man.As she got closer Horza saw she was lightly furred on her face, legs and arms, which the long shirt she wore revealed.She stopped in front of him and looked at him, from his feet to his eyes."I'm your second," she said, "whatever good that's supposed to do you. "She was the one with the nice voice.Horza was disappointed, even through his fear.He waved one hand."My name's Horza.Thanks for asking. "Idiot!he told himself.Tell them your real name, that's it.Why not tell them you're a Changer as well?"Yalson," the woman said abruptly, and stuck her hand out.Horza wasn't sure if the word was a greeting or her name.He was angry with himself.As though he didn't have enough problems, he'd tricked himself into giving his real name.Probably it wouldn't matter, but he knew too well that it was the small slips, the seemingly inconsequential mistakes, that often made the difference between success and failure, even life and death.He reached out and clasped the woman's hand when he realised that was what he was supposed to do.Her hand was dry and cool, and strong.She squeezed his.She let go before he had time to squeeze back.He had no idea where she came from, so he didn't read too much into it.Where he came from that would have been a fairly specific sort of invitation."Horza, eh?"She nodded and put her hands on her hips in the same way as the captain had done."Well, good luck, Horza.I believe Kraiklyn thinks Zallin's the most expendable member of the crew, so he probably won't mind if you win. "She looked down at his slack skinned paunch and rib skinny chest, and her brow furrowed."If you win," she repeated."Thanks a lot," Horza said, trying to suck in his belly and push out his chest.He gestured over to the others."They taking bets over there?"He tried to grin."Only on how long you'll last. "Horza let the attempt at a grin fade.He looked away from the woman and said, "You know, I could probably get this depressed even without your help.Don't let me stop you if you want to go and put some money down. "He looked back at the woman's face.He could see no compassion or even sympathy in it.She looked him up and down again, then nodded, turned on her heel and went back to the others.Horza swore."Right!"Kraiklyn clapped his gloved hands together.The group of people split up and moved around the sides of the hangar, lining two of them.Zallin was standing glaring at Horza from the far end of the cleared space.Horza pushed himself away from the bulkhead and shook himself, trying to loosen up and get ready."So, it's to the death, both of you," Kraiklyn announced, smiling."No weapons, but I don't see any referees, so anything goes.OK  begin. "Horza made a little more room between himself and the bulkhead.Zallin was coming towards him, crouched, arms out like a pair of oversized mandibles on some enormous insect.Horza knew that if he used all his built in weapons (and if he had them all; he had to keep reminding himself they'd taken out his venom teeth on Sorpen), he could probably win without too much trouble, unless Zallin landed a lucky blow.But he was equally sure that if he did use the only effective weapon he had left  the poison glands under his fingernails  the others would guess what he was and he'd be dead anyway.He might have got away with using his teeth somehow and biting Zallin.The poison affected the central nervous system, and Zallin would have slowed down gradually; probably nobody would guess.But scratching him would be fatal for both of them.The poison contained in the sacs under Horza's nails paralysed muscles sequentially from the point of entry, and it would be obvious Zallin had been scratched by something other than ordinary nails.Even if the other mercenaries didn't regard this as cheating, there would be a good chance the Man, Kraiklyn, would guess Horza was a Changer, and have him killed.A Changer was a threat to anybody who ruled by force, either of will or of arms.Amahain Frolk had known that, and so would Kraiklyn.There was also a degree of human basic revulsion reserved for Horza's species.Not only were they much altered from their original genetic stock, they were a threat to identity, a challenge to the individualism even of those they were never likely to impersonate.It had nothing to do with souls or physical or spiritual possession; it was, as the Idirans well understood, the behaviouristic copying of another which revolted.Individuality, the thing which most humans held more precious than anything else about themselves, was somehow cheapened by the ease with which a Changer could ignore it as a limitation and use it as a disguise.He had Changed into an old man, and that legacy still lay with him.Zallin was getting very close.The youth lunged, using his huge arms like pincers and making an ungainly grab for Horza.Horza ducked and jumped to one side, faster than Zallin had anticipated.Before he could follow Horza round, the Changer had landed a kick on the youth's shoulder which had been aimed at his head.Zallin swore.So did Horza.He'd hurt his foot.Rubbing his shoulder, the youth came forward again, almost casually at first, then suddenly swinging one long arm out, hand fisted, and very nearly catching Horza's face.The Changer felt the wind of the scything swing on his cheek.If the blow had landed, it would have finished the fight.Horza dummied one way, then leapt in the other direction, pivoting on one heel and lashing out again with a foot aimed between the youth's legs.It landed, but Zallin just smiled painfully and grabbed at Horza again.The spray must have deadened all feeling.Horza circled the youth.Zallin was staring at him with a look of intense concentration on his face.His arms were still bowed out in front of him like pincers, and at their ends his fingers flexed every now and again, as though desperate for the feel of Horza's throat.Horza was hardly aware of the people standing around him, or the lights and fittings of the hanger.All he could see was the crouched, ready young man in front of him, with his massive arms and silvery hair, his frayed T shirt and light shoes.The shoes squeaked on the metal deck as Zallin lunged again.Horza spun and flicked out with his right foot.It caught Zallin across his right ear, and the youth pranced away, rubbing his ear.Horza knew he was breathing hard again.He was using up too much energy just staying at maximum tension, ready for the next attack, and in the meantime he just wasn't hurting Zallin enough.At this rate the youth would soon wear him down, even without coming at him.Zallin spread his arms again and advanced.Horza skipped to one side, his old muscles complaining.Zallin swivelled.Horza leapt forward, pivoting again on one foot and swinging the other heel at the youth's midriff.It connected with a satisfying thump, and Horza started to jump away, then realised his foot was caught.Zallin was holding it.Horza fell to the deck.Zallin was swaying, one hand down at the base of his ribcage.He was gasping, almost doubled up, and staggering  Horza suspected he'd cracked a rib  but he held Horza's foot with the other hand.Twist and pull as he might, Horza couldn't loosen the grip.He tried a sweat pulse in his lower right leg.He hadn't done that since single combat exercise in the Academy in Heibohre, but it was worth a try; anything was, if it had a chance of loosening that grip.It didn't work.Perhaps he had forgotten how to do it properly, or perhaps his artificially aged sweat glands were incapable of reacting that fast, but either way he was still trapped in the youth's grip.Zallin was recovering now from the blow Horza had landed.He shook his head, the hangar lights reflecting on his hair; then he took hold of Horza's foot with his other hand.Horza was walking on his hands round the youth, one leg gripped, the other hanging down, trying to take some weight on the deck.Zallin stared at the Changer and whipped his hands round, as though trying to twist Horza's foot right off.Horza read the motion and was throwing his whole body round even as Zallin started the manoeuvre; he ended up back where he'd started, his foot held in Zallin's hands and his own palms crabbing across the deck as he tried to follow the movements of the youth.I could go for his legs; sweep in and bite, Horza thought, desperately trying to think of something.The instant he starts to slow down I'd have a chance.They wouldn't notice.All I need is  Then, of course, he remembered again.They had taken those teeth out.Those old bastards  and Balveda  were going to kill him after all, in Balveda's case from beyond the grave.As long as Zallin had his foot like this, the fight was only going to go one way.What the hell, I'll bite him anyway.He surprised himself with the thought; it was conceived and acted upon before he had time really to consider it.The next thing he knew he had pulled on the leg which Zallin held and pushed as hard as he could with his hands, flinging himself between the youth's legs.He fastened his remaining teeth into the boy's right calf."AAH!"Zallin screamed.Horza bit harder, feeling the grip round his foot slacken slightly.He jerked his head up, trying to tear the youth's flesh.He felt as though his kneecap was going to explode and his leg would break, but he worried the mouthful of living flesh and punched up towards Zallin's body with all his might.Zallin let go.Horza stopped biting instantly and threw himself away as the youth's hands came slamming down towards his head.Horza got to his feet; his ankle and knee were sore, but not seriously injured.Zallin was limping as he came forward, blood pouring from his calf.Horza changed tactics and pounced forward, striking the youth square in the belly, beneath the rudimentary guard of his huge arms.Zallin put his hands to his stomach and lower ribcage and crouched reflexively.As Horza went past he turned and brought both hands down on Zallin's neck.Normally the blow would have killed, but Zallin was strong and Horza was still weak.As the Changer steadied and turned he had to avoid colliding with some of the mercenaries lining the bulkhead; the fight had traversed the hangar, from one end to the other.Before Horza could get ill another blow, Zallin was upright again, his face contorted with frustrated aggression.He screamed and rushed at Horza, who sidestepped neatly.But Zallin stumbled in his headlong rush, and by pure luck his head thumped into Horza's stomach.The blow was all the more painful and demoralising for being unexpected.Horza fell and rolled, trying to send Zallin straight over the top, but the youth fell on him, pinning him to the deck.Horza wriggled, but nothing happened.He was trapped.Zallin raised himself up on one palm and drew the other hand up behind him into a fist as he leered at the face of the man beneath him.Horza realised suddenly that there was nothing he could do.He watched that massive fist go up and back, his own body flattened, his arms pinned, and knew it was over.He'd lost.He got ready to move his head as fast as possible, out of the way of the bone splintering punch he could see would be unleashed at any moment, and tried again to move his legs, but knew it was hopeless.He wanted to close his eyes, but knew he had to keep them open.Maybe the Man will take pity.He must have seen I fought well.I was just unlucky.Maybe he'll stop it  Zallin's fist paused, like a guillotine blade raised to its highest point, just before release.The blow never fell.As Zallin tensed, his other hand, taking the weight of his upper body on the deck, skidded; it went shooting out from under him as it slipped on some of the youth's own blood.Zallin grunted in surprise.As he fell towards Horza his body shifted, and the Changer could feel the weight pinning him lessen.He heaved himself out from underneath Zallin as the youth rolled.Horza rolled in the other direction, almost into the legs of the mercenaries who stood watching.Zallin's head hit the deck  not hard, but before the youth could react Horza threw himself onto Zallin's back, locking his hands round his neck and bringing the youth's silver haired head back.He slid his legs down either side of Zallin's body, straddling him, and held him there.Zallin went still, a gurgling noise coming from his throat where Horza's hands held him.He was more than strong enough to throw the Changer off, to roll on his back and crush him; but before he could have done anything, one flick of Horza's hands would have broken his neck.Zallin was looking up at Kraiklyn, who stood almost right in front of him.Horza, too, lathered in sweat and gulping air, looked up into the dark, deep set eyes of the Man.Zallin wriggled a little, then went motionless again when Horza tensed his forearms.They were all looking at him  all the mercenaries, all the pirates or privateers or whatever they wanted to call themselves.They stood round the two walls of the hangar and they looked at Horza.But only Kraiklyn was looking into Horza's eyes."This doesn't have to be to the death," Horza panted.He looked for a moment at the silver hairs in front of him, some of them plastered with sweat to the boy's scalp.He looked up at Kraiklyn again."I won.You can let the kid off next place you stop.Or let me off.I don't want to kill him. "Something warm and sticky seemed to be seeping from the deck along his right leg.He realised it was Zallin's blood from the wound on his leg.Kraiklyn had a strangely distant look on his face.The laser gun, which he had holstered, was lifted easily back out of its holster into his left hand and pointed at the centre of Horza's forehead.In the silence of the hangar, Horza heard it click and hum as it was switched on, about a metre away from his skull."Then you'll die," Kraiklyn told him, in a flat, even voice."I've no place on this ship for somebody who hasn't the taste for a little murder now and again. "Horza looked into Kraiklyn's eyes, over the motionless barrel of the laser pistol.Zallin moaned.The snap echoed round the metal spaces of the hangar like a gunshot.Horza opened his arms without taking his eyes off the mercenary chief's face.Zallin's limp body tumbled slackly to the deck and crumpled under its own weight.Kraiklyn smiled and put the gun back in its holster.It clicked off with a fading whine."Welcome aboard the Clear Air Turbulence. "Kraiklyn sighed and stepped over Zallin's body.He walked to the middle of one bulkhead, opened a door and went out, his boots clattering on some steps.Most of the others followed him."Well done. "Horza, still kneeling, turned at the words.It was the woman with the nice voice again, Yalson.
